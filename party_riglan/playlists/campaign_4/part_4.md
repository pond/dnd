### Closing Titles

> *(A clear, starlit night, a touch of light on the horizon, colours giving an impression of dawn. There's a tent. A dwarven snore can be hard from within and a tiefling tail pokes out from under a side flap. A metal dog sits on guard and, lying nearby in the grass on their backs, a firbolg and a halfling gaze at the stars. The halfling speaks - "It's good to know that they're all up there. Really, actually there... **somewhere**. Do you think we'll join them some day?" The Firbolg smiles. "I'm sure of it. We might travel there at different times, but we will eventually be reunited, forever among the stars")*
