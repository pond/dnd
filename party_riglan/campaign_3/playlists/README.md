# Campaign Three

Introducing firbolg druid Riglan Leafseeker, halfing rogue Temo Smoothhands, dwarven artificer Maireagh Silveraxe and tiefling sorceress Nethza.



## Part 1
### Wanderer

Through chance encounters and defence of those in need, the party of firbolg Riglan, halfing Temo, dwarf Maireagh and tiefling Nethza form. New friends are soon drawn into a search for missing family, believed lost in places of legend.



## Part 2
### Shepherd

The overall campaign arc is a heavily adapted variant of the Lost Mine of Phandelver. By the end of the campaign, our party, successful in securing and restarting the forge at Wave Echo Cave, has travelled to Yartar. Mysteries are discovered but things become overwhelming and, in the end, we elect to travel South; this campaign ends as we depart for new adventures.
