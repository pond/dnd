# Riglan: Part 20
## DAY 103

We wake up in the now-more-or-less-emptied Temple of Black Earth - now at level 9. Riglan has had an idea about conjuring a dragon spirit, but needs Maireagh to engrave a platinum trade bar with a dragon, and she's happy to do that. Temo thinks he has one or two spell ideas. Nethza has come up with some ways to evade grappling, restraint or similar. Maireagh has had some powerful new magical ideas.

We decide that tackling the upper temples of air or fire might just be dealing with lower level characters. If Unrayle has descended to try and bring forth elementals, then perhaps the others have too. It's a difficult choice mostly made of guesswork, but the divination vision from the previous night was compelling. We will descend.

All of us, Ruk included, get to the top of the stairs. Riglan perception 11+9; a strange shimmering field is visible, covering the entrance. We all make the hand shape that we know the earth cultists make, while facing the shimmering wall. Nothing happens. Riglan asks Ruk if Ruk has any ideas - and Ruk just walks through the field, so Riglan follows. Nothing seems to happen so the others come along too.

There's a very soft, dim light for only a few feet but then total darkness. Temo pulls on his goggles and Riglan casts Darkvision. Riglan's very close to an edge! He moves sideways quickly before falling. There's a free-hanging stone walkway that connects the warded entrance to this room, to a set of stairs wrapping around a natural stone obelisk. The stairs turn through right angles, like the ones we descended to get to the Temple of Black Earth from the monastery.

Riglan nature 12. He's never seen rock like this before; very unusual to him. Temo nature 17, doesn't know either.

We start to descend. The stairwell seems to have been carved into a space that would otherwise perhaps have been a very large natural shaft of some kind, but there are artificial aspects. It seems like it should be natural but everything Riglan sees gives him a feeling that it's somehow constructed; an alien feel.

After a while, Riglan starts to get more of a feel for how things change. The surface of the rock has many planes, as if jagged/naturally irregular, but those planes are individually very flat - if there were light here, they'd be reflective. He mentions that to Temo so Temo briely lights his light ring. This floods a 10ft radius area around us with colour. The column is pure, shiny black. Similar to obsidian, but not that. Riglan is reminded of the strange monolith that had appeared in Thundergrove Bastion, left with Reidoth all those weeks ago, but obviously very much larger. It's hard to imagine how this got here, other than being grown or naturally occurring in the manner of veins of metal ores or crystals.

Temo gets a better look (nature 18+3). He realises that the rock seems to be a monolith; whatever it is, it's not built from blocks, but seems to be a continuous piece. He notes that the surrounding rock is nothing like it; just "normal" rock. The stairs descend well beyond our sight and are, themselves, again just "regular" stone, even though it wraps around the obelisk. There are touch points where it's somehow connected, as if stairs were carved out of rock encasing an obelisk, yet there's a cavern/column of space around them; none of it makes sense. Maireagh confirms that the stairs are Dwarven, but the obelisk is not and the cavern is indeed a mixture of natural and Dwarven-carved.

Temo puts out the light and we carry on.

After a few more flights, the cavern around widens out. There seem to be a few tunnels or hollows around the sides; it looks more natural here, obelisk and stairs aside! Further down, the cavern bends sideways so the stairs start to hit the cavern walls and we cut through into it. The stairs open out a bit, longer stretches between the 90 degree turns with it moving away from the obelisk briefly; some alcoves spied off to the sides sometimes; there's a phosphorescent glow appearing, some kind of lichen. It looks like people may have lingered at times around the alcoves, or in this general area; the stones of the stairs are more worn and smoothed out. More traffic for a long time.

Ruk encourages us to keep moving.

The stairs wrap back into their closer proximity to the obelisk, but still a little wider than before - they don't anchor to the obelisk in this section; instead they seem attached to the outer wall of the shaft. We get to an area where Ruk signals that we should be quiet and careful - sneak. Riglan casts Pass Without A Trace through his staff.

Not long after, we emerge out of the strange column cavern; the cavern just gets larger and larger until the stairs reach another free-hanging walkway that links the staris lining the cavern wall to the continuation of the stairs, again up against the obelisk. The obelisk itself here is also much wider and now perfectly square - clearly carved - the stairs wrapping around twice more before getting to the cavern floor.

It's maybe 80-100ft in diameter. There is an irregular, natural floor. The Dwarven architecture here seems to give away; things look more natural around us. It's still fully dark. At the bottom of the stairs we see no exits, but as we walk around the obelisk base on the cavern floor, we see two exits that lead to passageways that lead at directions about 90 degrees different from one another. They again look natural; maybe 12ft high; but inset not far into the tunnel are doors, the stone kind with a central pillar, like at the Mud Sorcerer's lab.

Riglan: Perception 14+9. There are some natural bits of overhanging rock here here and there, with a very faint purple glow on the underneath as a very thin film of the same luminescent lichen seems to grow. It only seems to be on the underneath.

We have no idea what true North is so decide to call the stairway exit direction North, meaning the doors are South and West. Ruk tells us that he needs to sneak around to find the little passages that lead to his village. We elect to follow our "keep right" strategy that'll mean the West door. Ruk was thinking of that too - head there then maybe try to go North as he has a feeling that there's an old mine out that way someway. The passages are haunted, so he'll have to hide and sneak around.

As quietly as we can, we push open the "west" (kinda) door.

We more or less immediately enter a cavern. There is evidence of Dwarven stonework in parts. A pair of ancient ore carts rest on the remnants of rails, running roughly North-South. Some sections are partly collapsed so the rails head under rubble. It opens up. There are maybe three tunnels heading off in different directions that we can see and which seem to be intact (there are indications of many more but they're blocked by various degrees of collapse). **Ruk stops us and hugs the wall, thanks us with a hand gesture. We beckon a sentiment in kind. We see him press against the wall - and kind of seem to disappear.** Very strange. Further along, there's a tiny tunnel about 1ft high and we just about make a little puff of dust going up from there, before it settles.

Given that we suspect the elemental temples are connected as a quadrilateral and given that we've reason to believe all connect to this lower level in some way, albeit possibly not by vertical shafts; yet given that from the monastery, we did go more or less directly down all the way; and finally, given that the monastery is kind of in the North-Eastern corner of the connected temples; we think we're probably in a North East corner of this complex. It sounds like if we were to continue West and try to get through the body of the Fane of the Elemental Eye along the Northern edge (more or less), we might eventually reach an area populated with air cultists. However, to do so, we have to get past a bunch of wraiths, spectres and the like and possession by ghosts doesn't sound like much fun. That said, if we were to go back to the South door we have no idea at all what's through there and it could be the same or worse.

Right now we seem to be going for Unrayle, but we suspect all three remaining cult leaders may have people here doing bad stuff, so we press on Westwards - we'll try to find our way towards where the air cultists might be. We do so with as much stealth as we can muster (Pass Without A Trace providing +10)

* Riglan: adv., 23
* Temo 38
* Nethza 18
* Maireagh 21

Riglan perception: 1+9, boo. We're following around the wall, biasing Northwards, similar to how Ruk went. We pass the 1ft opening, then a North wall tunnel which is also very small - maybe only 3-4ft high - then at the North West approach where the railway goes into a collapsed other tunnel. At this, Temo grabs Riglan's hand - his sling is warning him. Temo is quick (flat initiative check - 19+5). Riglan wisdom saving 4+9. Riglan freezes and Temo manages to pull us back from the collapsed tunnel (and his sling calms down).

Temo, seeing people looking confused, points at his sling then points at the collapsed tunnel. We'll have to try another way. So now, we venture out into the middle of the cavern, trying to (once again, really) get sight of the Western wall. We do eventually notice a door directly opposite the one we came into, but on the other side of the cavern. The wall there looks carved - straightened. This makes it stand out. The rails head Southwards. We quietly figure that this might lead all the way, Southwards, eventually up to the water temple - collapsed sections and bad creatures notwithstanding. If we're in a rough North-East, and so is the earth temple above, we know the water temple would've been roughly South-East, so that fits. North West would be fire cult above and South West would be air, by elimination.

We'll keep along this edge for now and since we can see the far door (West wall) then we head for that. To get more of an idea of how far things go, Riglan calls a fey familiar bat. It flies south. The cavern narrows down eventually to a passageway along which the railway continues, with another door in the South wall off to the left (facing South). There's also a smaller passageway, again only a few feet fall, to the right (facing South). The bat explores the northern 3-4ft tall tunnel. It is a narrow mining tunnel that seems to carry on beyond Riglan's 100ft range, so he calls the bat back for now. No change in the "plan" - West wall door. It's another one of the Dwarven rotating centre pivot doors; but Ruk had said the architecture down here wasn't Dwarven - so maybe he didn't go here. There's a small 10ft square entryway, again Dwarven. Stairs, properly carved, lead to the right (North) heading away and up 30ft, apparently leading to a room towards the West and with a light from that shining against the wall at the top, which looks like a fire.

Riglan opened the door - stealth only 16, even with PWOT. The bat ventures up the stairs. There's a 60ft or so wide room E-W, 40ft N-S, but very irregularly shaped. A large, low brazier full of hot coals with other things thrown on seems to be doing duty as a light source and strange kind of camp fire. There's some kind of very large creature sat in front of the fire and another smaller creature nearby. The bat can't see more without going in the room, but it listens - adv. perception 19+1. There's grunting and heavy breathing. Then there's a strange language being growled in a low guttural voice, sounds almost like bellows, followed by a higher voice answering in what sounds like the same language. He understands neither.

Riglan indicates via hand gestures what's going on, so Temo takes of his goggles, dons his helm and uses it to Comprehend Languages. Riglan moves up a stair or two so Temo will still be within PWAT range and Temo sneaks up just to the top of the stairs. Stealth total 40! In a burst of daring he even pops his head around the corner of the doorway as there are shadows he can use to stay undetected.

There's a cavern here, festooned with dozens of gruesome things hanging on the walls - hooks with chopped off, burnt hands and claws hanging on a string. An iron brazier is full of coals. A large sleeping mat of furs is on the South, with a hulking minotaur sat on it. In front of him is a large iron coffer out of which he seems to be making piles of coins. "Ugh. Stupid! Why is not stand!" - he's angry and the coin piles falling over. "Emberhorn. Emberhorn minotaurs not bring me enough. Only trophies for the wall" - he beckons. "Zegdar want _gold_. Zegda want _things_ - treasures. Better. Better than burned hands as trophies. Emberhorn minotaurs silly, stupid and primitive. Dishonourable. Not worthy of Zegdar as a chief!"

The large minotaur has a very ornate chainmail hauberk and lots of regalia, including an adornment of a massive, red-stained fur cloak or shawl of sorts. He has a huge greataxe, massive horns and seems to be sat very close to the brazier with no ill effects from its heat. At one point he puts his hands towards the brazier to rearrange the coals and yet none of his fur is singed.

Then Temo spots a small Nothic - we recognise these psychic creatures from under Deepgarden Keep way back - "You are. You are wise! That is why Vanifer has gifted you Wicks as an advisor. Wicks is a special gift only for special leaders. Very important to Vanifer. She only keeps the worthy and mighty by her side, to rule!" - so, fire cult, which explains the lack of singeing.

Temo: Intelligence saving: 17+7. The moment he sees the Nothic he tries to make his mind black. The Nothic *almost* detects him. Temo comes back down the stairs, gestures that we should just step outside the door into the cavern and we quietly shut the door. We figure we can cross the cavern OK right now so go back to the stairs to talk and Temo brings us up to speed. Nothic! Bad news, we didn't enjoy that one the first time around at all. For now, we elect to try that Southern door of the stairwell and be a bit combat-shy until we've got a better idea of the strength of forces here and who might be most important.

We push the door but it's quite stuck, implying it might not have been opened for a while; unclear why. It opens with a bit of force. We enter a clearly very Dwarven room; it opens in staggered increases of width, that appear to be decorative, into a square room with other decorations that seem to be symmetrical. There are some alcoves but again they seem decorative. The ceiling starts at about 6ft up, rising at 45 degrees but meeting in a flat section rather than a point. Everything looks perfectly measured. Decorative runes are all over the place! In the middle is a 3-step raised dais with a sarcophagus in the middle. Curiously, with all the symmetry, the sarcophagus is not centred - the dais starts in the middle of the room but extends depth-wise to stretch to the far wall and the sarcophagus on there is itself not centred, but more towards the front. It's about 40ft away; the room is maybe 60ft wide.

Riglan asks Temo to keep a sharp eye on his sling! We creep forwards into the room. A worn frieze circles the dais steps about 4ft up, on the 2nd step (2ft each) but it's badly worn. Riglan asks Maireagh if she can make anything of it all, without getting in too far or close. She calls our attention to the walls - worn and quite old, are relief carvings of scenes of battle. Screw it - we go to the carvings first, looking up close; maybe it'll let us know if we should expect danger near the sarcophagus. Different depictions:

* A mighty dwarf slaughters demons and other monsters
* A mighty dwarf slaughters grimlocks - Temo arcana 13+3; grimlocks are humans that have been tempted into the underdark by mind flayers and now live there to worship them; psychic servants
* And on it goes - more scenes follow this same dwarf in various heroic stances fighting various underdark creatures, all the way around the room
* Underneath in a script of Besilmir (Dethek runes), is a description Maireagh can read of mighty battles; when they were, who they were against; the years are inevitably from the time of Besilmir
* All of the dates are, though, within a 3-4 year period only; the heroism was short-lived but the hero was nonetheless very busy!

Given this apparently encouraging sign of good acts, we approach the frieze around the dais. It's very worn and hard to read. More Dethek runes though; and on the lid, the name - translating to **Hendrel Foebreaker**. Underneath is a Dwarvish saying - "Bow your head and remember valour". Maireagh reads it out.

Riglan looks around and looks at her and it's such a strange place to find down here, and apparently unspoiled; he suggests we do as it asks, as a sign of respect because nobody else is likely to around here! Maireagh's face softens a little. She moves into a particular position and follow her actions - she bows her head, bends the knee and places her hand on her knee, thinking.

We feel a spread of light, soft, extending from the sarcophagus, illuminating all of the runes in the room with a soft yellow-orange glow. Riglan hears a soft, whispering voice, emanating from all around; it's not from his staff; it asks, or suggests perhaps - "Curious visitor; are you aligned to good? I cannot tell." Riglan answers as best he can - "I've been told I'm somewhat neutral, but I do fight to preserve those things that people consider good". At this, the light seems to be brighter.

Temo doesn't hear anything. He doesn't seem the runes brighten - to him, it's already bright - he raises his goggles. Maireagh likewise, in fact for her she comments on how bright it is. Nethza doesn't react in any obvious way. Riglan asks her if she can see runes glowing. "Yes, can you not? It's quite bright in here!"

Riglan explains briefly how things had appeared to him. It seems that bright runes are a good thing!

There's a sense of peace and calm washing over the group. There's some kind of spell active; perhaps active the whole time, but now affecting us. Religion & Wisdom checks for Temo & Riglan are low rolls; no answers! We ask Maireagh - she casts Identify. A few minutes later, our answer; a **permanent Hallow spell**:

* No celestials, elementals, undead; perhaps the lack of elementals has kept the cultists away.
* If we were charmed, frighted or possessed, that would be dispelled if we were able to be brought here.
* Dead bodies in this area cannot be turned undead either.
* Teleportation or inter-dimensional travel be used to cannot enter this room.
* There is bright light which darkness spells cannot hide and nobody could be frightened if someone tried to do that in the room.

Maireagh points out that this is a very "good" Hallow spell. It can be cast with any of the effects reversed for evil effects, so we might need to watch out for that. The spell here is permanent and very, very old; it would've taken a lot of magic to pull this off.

(In addition, we're affected by a 5th level Aid spell, so we all get 20 points added to our max HP until the next long rest - but Maireagh's dog gains no benefit; it's a construct with no alignment).

Best. Room. Ever.

At this point, we notice another well-concealed door that means, technically, the left-right symmetry we noticed is a little imperfect. One of the alcoves is a door, on the West wall. We close the entrance door, then go through this new one. It is again quite stuck; we close it behind us.

There's a 60ft hallway in front - more Dwarven stonework, but about 40ft along is a collapsed wall on the left that looks like it leads to some kind of natural passageway. At the end of the hallway is another door. We cautiously move about 30ft along, then Riglan asks everyone to halt there for a moment, pulls the bat back to this plane and asks it to scout out the natural passage way.

It seems to go along for about 30ft, then descends. Strange steps - apparently natural - seem to have rounded curved ridges on the end. Almost as if you took ripples in the sand and tilted it. 30ft down, the bat finds itself in a big cavern. It's very irregular. The bat hangs on the roof above the steps before the cavern opens up and listens (adv perception 15,17+1). Very faint movement *above* as if on the ceiling and above. At this position, that area seems to be about 20ft up. The cavern bottom is very irregular, all ledges, holes, overhangs and so-on, on a several-foot size scale; indications of water having dripped for centuries in one place. Almost no two parts of the cavern floor are at the same level. Riglan hears the movement through the bat, and asks it to really squint hard with sonar and see if it can see anything that way - sadly now the perception roll is only 4+1. It can't see anything. The bat does hear dripping too. Riglan asks it to fly around the cavern quickly while staying in the 100ft telepathic range to see if he can see the far end; it can; it's a kind of kidney shape with the concave section on the West, 100ft N-S, 50ft E-W. Exits *roughly* in all remaining compass points; East, West, South. The Western one is quite close to the entrance off the stairs. The Southwards passage is at the farthest extent and the Eastern one is about half way along. After a while, the sound of distant water is perceived too; flowing; not just dripping, at least 150ft away.

Riglan suggests we creep forward and Temo with his goggles tries to move into the cave stealthily and see if he can see what's on the roof. Temo stealth: 25, after an awful roll of 2 - thank goodness PWAT is still active! It's slippery. He notices light up ahead; the cavern is lit with a phosphorescent glow that matches the lichen we saw, purple, but also a new, green glow. He creeps down and hears the dripping water and once he gets a proper view of the cavern he sees clearly the matrix of shallow, water-hollowed "craters", each with a small pool of water. Some areas are a bit muddy or boggy. The sides of the cavern is lined with ledges/shelves with more pools and giant toadstools and puffballs; some of the mushrooms glow. The bright flourescent green is from bands of smaller, 10-20cm layered mushrooms (similar to those that grow out of upright but rotting tree trunks sometimes). There are even more puffballs on the ceiling. He spots a movement in the shadows. Temo perception 10+3, sadly. He sees what looks like tendrils. He tiptoes back and shrugs - Riglan might have to try it!

Riglan "creeps" in... Adv.stealth - 7,17+0+10 (PWAT) - 27. He looks at where Temo told him. Another shit roll; perception 4+9, 13 *again*, FML. But definitely seems to be tendrils hanging down. Nature check only 14. The other two creep down too. Riglan asks Temo to try and lure it out... Mage hand... We back up to the entrance and he uses the mage hand to tug a tendril. Descending from the ceiling, a giant brain! 18 tendrils flailing. It has a strange beak. It bats at the mage hand. It flops into the middle of the cave, rotates around as if looking, flings out the tendrils as if it is feeling the room, smacks a puffball which bursts, then floats to the ceiling.

We retreat back up the stairs a little and whisper to each other trying to figure out what the hell that was, but none of us have ever seen anything like it before. It seems like it might be some kind of guard; feels similar to weird creatures in the other temples we've seen that are just there to catch the unwary, or were already here and are just left to their own devices. That said, Riglan nature: 19+7. The creature's behaviour made him think that this was its habitat. It might simply live there, and behaves like an ambush predator might. It's some kind of strange aberration. It would not belong on the surface, but does belong here. Riglan survival: total 23. He noticed evidence of footfall in patches of mud, but they were in specific paths; hugging the ledges and shelves along the wall. There are ways past, if one if stealthy enough.

After some discussion we elect to give it a try. Weapons ready, with the PWAT spell still up, we creep around, Riglan leading, following an intermittent set of footprints that hug the Eastern wall.

* Temo: 34
* Riglan: 28
* Maireagh: 16
* Nethza: 19

We reach the half way point and the sound of water is louder. This ties in with what we almost expect, if the water temple is "related" to this corner of the Fane. We venture into that Eastern passageway, towards the noise. A tunnel extends another 80ft or so to the SE; the noise of water getting louder. Sounds like rapids. Taking care, we arrive in a natural cavern that snakes along, carved out by a river. There are a few bits of rapids; water is flowing from right (South-ish) to left (North-ish) with the sound of a distant waterfall to the left. The waterfall is relatively close by but falls through a quite narrow hole that muffles the sound of where it plunges - sounds like it is quite a big fall. There do seem to be steps along the side of it, though.

We figure that maybe this might be a way to a node? Like Marloss' one from the divination vision. With the water cult taken out, it might be dangerous but not fatal so we investigate. The steps are inevitably slippery but descend following the walls of the waterfall-carved hollow. The circle around and spiral downwards, going actually behind the waterfall. We descend. Lower down, the slippery stone means we have to move much more slowly and carefully. After quite a few minutes, we get to the plunge pool. The cavern here is very wide and large. Most of the sound of the waterfall is muffled because it plunges into what amounts to a lake - 120ft x 70ft we estimate via bat - that fills this cave. The stairs descend into the water. NEish and NWish exits. There are little spots of light under the water, moving; bioluminescent creatures. There's no way to reach those exists without swimming, so Riglan spends 10 minutes on his Water Walk ritual.

We step onto the water. There's a strong current - swimming would have been hazardous. We select - more or less arbitrarily - the NE exit.

**Floating above us is a strange sphere of water.** It seems to be just flowing in on itself; a small ball of water trying to hold its shape. It's big - about 7ft in diameter.

We've no idea what this means and proceed to the NE exit. It's all water. It descends a little, turning East and South sharply. Maybe 200ft. Riglan sends the bat ahead another 100ft to see if there's anything interesting and it does in fact enter another water-filled cavern with another waterfall descending further to the South. To the east, land rises a little out of the water, but only 2-3 ft at an angle, leading NE. Unable to determine anything we go back to where we saw the weird ball of water. As we go, Riglan (perception 19+9) can hear multiple waterfalls and rapids all over the place. Some hundreds of feet away, some close.

Going through the NW exit, it's very twisty. After about 80ft we reach a narrower cavern that has a small rock outcrop in the middle, which splits the waterway. Another waterfall to the south. We carry on in the direction that isn't a waterfall! Sort of West, at this point. Waterfalls start to sound more distant. We enter a much quieter cavern. This one is large and very irregular. There are small rock islands dotted around. Riglan perception only 2+9. Stalagmites jut out of the water, some going up 10-15ft to a ceiling that's much higher here, maybe 25 feet up. There are nets set up between some of the stalagmites and between those and the walls. Fishing nets. We hear clattering of hard shell against rocks. Crabs or something? It's more than 200ft from one end to the other so we can't see that far.

The bat tries to make some sense of the room. There are several large creatures here - much larger than the bat, somewhat larger than any of our party. They clatter around on ledges. More nets are draped across various places. The north edge of the cavern seems to have no exits. The only thing we've seen that's very odd is the sphere of water so on second thoughts we decide to go back and see if Maireagh can identify it. There's some dry land for Water Walk again if need be as time is getting on.

There's a form of levitation being cast on an otherwise normal ball of water. The middle of the ball of water is a remnant of magic; itself some kind of mild levitation of some kind, with a hint that the water could levitate something by transferring that magic from within itself.

We've been down almost an hour, so we get onto the stairs and have a think, expecting to need another water walk ritual maybe. Riglan is asked to Wisdom Save, but only rolls 3 for 12 total. Temo only 9 total. Maireagh and Nethza low too. **Essentially, everyone fails.**

* A powerful probing presence envelops Riglan's mind. He sees a vision - a cavern covered in slime and in the middle of the cavern is a sort of plaza and temple. It looks ancient; an unknown architecture. Behind a precession of grand stone arches at the entrance is a pair of stone doors, carved with a large circular sawtooth maw - like a shark or similar.

* Temo sees a different thing. An altar of smooth stone in a room lined with columns. An open air temple, surrounded by water. The ground itself is covered in a thin layer of water too. The altar rises out of it. Standing behind the alter is a kind of fish person (!) (technically, race is Kuo-Toa) who raises a trident as others of its kind bring a squirming human onto the altar, who is then sacrificed.

The visions then just end. Riglan's used to having visions so doesn't immediately realise that everyone else did until he sees their expressions. He describes his and Temo says that his was different. We compare notes:

* Maireagh was shown dwarves being dragged by fish people in chains towards a cave that has water flowing into a circular hole, almost like a whirlpool/drain in the middle, with the dwarves thrown into it. They were calling to her, by name, for help.

* Nethza sees a vision of slaves in pens being dragged underwater and fed to a black, inky thing in the depths of the dark that she couldn't really see; it would reach out a tentacle, wrapping around a cage full of slaves before a large circular mouth full of teeth would emerge, then another circular layer of teeth inside, would devour the whole thing.

Riglan notes that this sounds like the temple in his vision. He also notes, though it might not be significant, that he saw only something unusual and ancient, but not specifically compelling or scary. Just unnatural and evil. He points out that everyone else seemed to see a vision that really would trigger them somewhat into wanting to take action; to rescue, to halt what's going on. The visions were tailored to people - at least Maireagh for sure, by name, but Nethza and slaves is too big a coincidence. And that makes it feel like a huge trap! It's like someone goading you to rush in somewhere dangerous, by giving you visions that are intended to provoke rash action.

Another water walk is cast. There's about 6 hours of darkvision left, PWAT has expired, 2 hours of bat. We head back to the small cavern on the way to the big one with the strange nets, which seemed to have no exits via what the bat saw, and this time follow South, but the waterfall here has no steps. Between Maireagh and Nethza we're able to get flying for a few minutes, so we fly down the ~25 foot drop of the waterfall. It's another large cavern, the water flowing away Southwards. A thick mist is here, obscuring the roof, some stalactites piercing through. The surface of the water undulates with waves leading Southwards too, towards another waterfall. The cavern is 60-70ft across and we can hear the far waterfall but not see it. We can't see any other exits and the waves are weird so we fly just above the surface towards the distant waterfall noise.

This one drops further than we can see; we fly down and it drops around 180ft!

We can't see much here; it's a very tall space and we just don't have enough vision to see much. We can hear another waterfall dropping to the right, though. There looks like a Southward continuation but we "keep right" for a change and since we can fly temporarily at least we fly up the waterfall. As we go, we notice that the water is slimy! At this Riglan gets a *very* bad sense of _deja vu_ from his vision. At the top, it opens out into another cavern and - surprise, surprise - there are columns rising out of the water, in fact there seem to be possibly two such sets of structures. Riglan, as tallest, is first to catch a glimpse of the columns from that vision. **It's a real place** and what's more there is a psychic pressure; a sense of something vast, ancient and evil, extremely powerful. The presence feels like it fills the cavern ahead.

Wisdom savings again; Temo 3 (!), Riglan 10 (!!) - truly awful rolls. Temo gets a sudden sense of urgency and his attention is drawn to his left, towards a set of columns rising out of the water to the left near the edge of his sight. He feels a pull in this direction. Riglan thinks he sees movement in the water, it's rippling around him, as eyes appear under the water looking and blinking. He feels the presence of elemental force closing in on him.

Riglan wants to retreat, but Temo starts to dash off and Riglan tries to grab him. He gets only 13 on Athl., which Temo easily exceeds for Acrobatics. So Temo runs off, Riglan shouts and we fly after him. He flies towards the pillars. He reaches the area, hovering; we all sense a presence that feels as large as the cavern.

Initiative:

* Temo: 18
* Maireagh: 18
* Riglan: 11
* Nethza: 8

Temo acts first, but before he does, he needs to try and regain his senses. He fails badly (rolls a 1 then 3). So instead of doing anything aggressive, he runs into the temple. He realises that there's actually no sacrifice though and tries to figure it out (intelligence-based perception roll but rolls a 2, FFS, so only 9), so can't reconcile it and keeps looking. He runs in a bit deeper. The rest of us can see him kind of flailing around, as if trying to interact with things that aren't there.

Maireagh shouts after Temo to try and get his attention, but can't. She flies over to him in the temple area and attempts to grab him. Temo finds this moment to roll a 17, so acrobatics 26, Maireagh clearly can't do it. She tries again; Temo acrobatics total 18; Maireagh has a flash of genius after his first dodge and manages to grab a hold of him (she rolled 9+6, +5). He is, in essence, grappled and pulls him sideways to try and get him away from the strange temple area.

Riglan can see the strange ripples on the surface and the eyes he thought he saw give way to some large rising creature's shadow; eyeless, rounded, row-rows-of-teeth-first. Ethereal strange pseudopods extend out below, fading into the deep, so Riglan doesn't know how long they are. He shouts, "Look at the middle! There's a huge evil creature coming, long tentacles, keep your distance and watch out!".

Riglan doesn't mess around - new toys. L5, calls forth a gem dragon! He chooses to share its psychic damage resistance, just in case. By the time the dragon appears and Riglan drops in his bear totem, the creature is almost breaking the surface but not quite there. **A cone of radiant energy blasts** out to the creature, 2d6 damage max potential rolled 7, dex 19 save required; it doesn't save. It doesn't seem unusually hurt, but we see the water boiling a bit and see some damage scored.

* HP 15
* AC 19
* Fly 60, swim/walk 30

The horrifying creature now fully emerges. We sense a strange psychic sweep as it "looks" around somehow, despite being bereft of eyes. It moves to within 10ft of the dragon, which is hovering just over the water and reaches up to attack with *three* tentacles. One miss. One hit. One miss. The hit deals 15 damage, but the dragon gets coated in a strange mucus. Dragon con.save 19+3; it shrugs off whatever the effect is. Riglan (medicine 11+5) sees where the slime is shrugged off onto the water, notices that it's like a strange, disease-ridden petri dish spot. He shouts, "watch out, if it touches you there's some kind of weird slime that the dragon had to fight off - something diseased, really nasty!"

Nethza moves to within 30ft and throws her hex blade's curse at the foul creature. She throws eldritch blasts. The first misses (16) but the second hits (21) for d10->10 :-) plus 5+4, 19 total. This makes it angry and it has some kind of reaction out-of-order - it whips something previously unseen that looks strangely tail-like out of the water, flinging it at the nearby dragon, which hits for 10. Nethza shouts "sorry!" and Riglan says "it's good, we have to keep on it!"

Worse yet, emerging from the end of the columns the temple door opens and a Kua-toa emerges. Maireagh franticly shakes Temo to try and get him to wake, but he doesn't manage to break free (rolls a 6 and 7, despite Maireagh being allowed to give him advantage). The perception roll is only a 5(+4+3), but Maireagh uses a flash of genius which with all modifiers considered does finally get him free of the effects (total ends up at 17 (5+4+3+5)). He looks confused and frightened, but Maireagh can see he's at least awake and she can't do anything else but can pull him away to comparative safety, by the rest of the party. She moves forward closer to the creature.

Riglan pulls his lightning wand out and throws two charges (9d6). The creature does not dodge (dex 15) and so it takes a full 40damage. The lightning illuminates the creature which has no bones, and we can see multiple tentacles a good 30ft down below. It's huge. Seeing this, Riglan - slightly pointlessly perhaps - activates his staff! He commands the dragon to attack with full might.

The dragon misses once and hits once, doing only 6 damage; mucus splashes off the creature but it misses the dragon and Riglan shouts "Watch out Maireagh! if you hit it up close it'll spray you with that mucus!" as the dragon uses the breath. It only does 3 damage.

The creature (technically an Aboleth) whips its tail around again, hitting once again for a huge 17 damage. It then goes for Riglan, which gives the dragon an opportunity to attack and hits for 8. But the creature is now right in Riglan's face - well, 10ft away. Three tentacles swing out to hit him. The first just misses, the second matches AC to hit and the last misses, so amazingly only one hit; 9 damage. DC 14 con save for Riglan, he rolls low (because of course he does) and gets only 12 but Maireagh burns yet another flash of genius and he manages to spin and let the cloak take a lot of the slime rather it getting on his skin. We'll need the cleaning stone if we survive this! Riglan almost loses concentration but remembers to use his cloak (doing double duty) to keep the spell up.

Now another Kua-toa appears from the temple; it looks like some kind of priest. In our minds, we hear it screaming! There is a concept of "LEAVE THE GOD ALONE OR PAY THE CONSEQUENCES". Whatever this thing is, it's no god, even if it might yet turn out to be as powerful as one. Then the annoying priest casts a healing spell on the creature. Dammit. It heals for a huge 15. In response, the creature, annoyed at Maireagh being in the way of Riglan, swipes at her with its tail; fortunately, this time it misses.

Nethza moves around Riglan to the other side of him. Nethza's only got one spell left and torn about what she can best do, then figure outs that the priest is a problem - it healed the creature and helped it attack. **She casts Darkness in the area where the Kua-toa emerged** and heads in that direction. We have to take out the priests to truly take out the creature.

The aboleth manages to hit Maireagh with its tail, for 18 damage. She's within 5 feet and is within the range of the mucus puddle around it; she manages to make her save. We realise we need to hover above the water surface.

Temo's frightened and angry; he holds his ground, aims and fires. He needed the advantage - rolled a 5 and then 17, so 27 to hit. He gets middling damage - 30 total, including sneak damage. Maireagh sees Temo's magical bolt strike true. She's over playing with this awful creature; it seems to need huge damage; drops her Fly spell to rely on the water walking rtual spell from Riglan, casts L2 branding smite, has to not worry about the mucus, moves around to try and draw it away a little from Riglan and Temo and attacks at direct melee range. She attacks once and hits, doing 21 damage. As the hit strikes, she uses Arcane Jolt and life energy arcs to the dragon, healing it for 6. The saves against the disease effects, then hits again for 10 damage. Sadly the dog misses despite advantage.

The aboleth is quite injured - and very annoyed. It attacks Maireagh with the tail and hits once more for 18 damage; she continues, somehow, to resist whatever this mucus is.

We hear more sounds in the darkness at the temple end and deduce that more people have arrived.

Riglan: Perception 5+9, 14. The creature looks as angry and frustrated as something with no face can look and is injured, thrashing around. Psychic screams to its followers seem to be calling out. He levels his lightning wand for an even stronger blast (10d6, 3 charges) - the creature critically fails the dex save, taking 41 damage. The creature might even be on the edge of death. Riglan calls to his dragon to attack then uses Hidden Step and vanishes!

The dragon attacks with its breath weapon, doing 9 damage. This is enough to do it! The creature seems to die and sinks back under the water. Like a skin on boiling milk, the mucus on the water surface seems to adhere to it and is dragged down as the creature descends.

Pushing out of the darkness, a Kua-Toa emerges, yelling out in a language we don't understand; it raises its spear and appears in great distress; it draws its own spear across its chest, bleeding; the priest runs out too - both ending up partly swimming as they fall off the edge of the temple; it kills (!) the Kua-toa next to it with its sceptre and darkish green inky tendrils leach out towards the sinking body. The body sort of sucks it up and movement begins again. It was healed by the sacrifice. Nethza ralises it never truly died as she got no healing from the hex and shouts out a warning to that effect.

Netzha then tries to attack the priest, but unfortunately both blasts miss. At this, another Kua-toa, previously unseen from the darkness spell, starts to emerge from the darkness.

Temo, seeing this mess happening, aims and fires at the priest Kua-toa now. He does hit but for only 27 damage. Maireagh's up! She runs closer, grabs a small handaxe off her belt, wields and throws it - with Conjure Barrage. Multiple axes fly out. Potential damage 14; dex save 18; we hear no less than *five* thuds (save fails) and one sound of something glancing off (save success). SIX people? We can only see two! The dog runs up to the recently-emerged Kua-Toa, hitting and taking it down straight away.

At this, one more Kua-toa emerges from the darkness, attacking the dog but missing. A different looking Kua-Toa appears too, behind the priest. It has no weapons; its slimy skin has fins and pulsing dots of light, like an electric eel. It pushes forward and attacks the dog, swiping unarmed twice, hitting once for 5 (but there's a flash of electricity, doing another 4 damage) and missing once. It tries to bite the dog but fails. Another one shows up and throws a net at the dog, and succeeds! The dog is restrained.

Riglan can see the creature coming back up so readies his wand for a single charge blast. He tells the dragon to attack the Kua Toa, focusing on the priest. It flies up over Maireagh and hits all four visible Kua-Toa with the breath weapon. Potential damage 9; two of the "low level" Kua-toa die outright; there is strangled cry in the darkness area; the electric Kua-toa seems to take all of it; the priest likewise. The dragon swings round and does two rake attacks on the priest. It hits twice but both d6 rolls are 1; it hits for 10 damage total as a result.

Riglan sees that blood from the dead Kua-toa is flowing into the aboleth and devouring the energy. He shouts a warning to everyone and suggests that we might need to consider a strategic withdrawal!

The aboleth now reappears, right next to Maireagh - closer to the temple. It seems to be reaching for its two worshippers. Riglan fires with his wand, but it's a tight shot to not hit anyone else and the aboleth finds it easier to dodge. It manages to fail the save but a low roll means only 25 damage. Riglan shouts, "It's trying to consume its followers for energy!". The creature targets Maireagh with some kind of psychic attack; she clutches at her head. She fails her save! She seizes up and the aboleth drains her (3d6 psychic damage -> 11) and heals that much itself.

The priest raises its sceptre and casts mass cure wounds; everyone heals for a whopping 16.

Nethza drops the now-unneeded darkness spell. She throws eldritch blasts at the aboleth. Neither hit. She does at least do Maddening Hex for 5 damage.

Temo aims and fires at the priest. He crits! But shit damage rolls, 38 total (12d6+6!).

Maireagh tries to shrug off the attack. She makes it - phew - but she had to use a flash of genius. Only one left. That's all she can do.

The dog is dodging, freed of the net after the low-level Kua-toa fell; the monitor (electric) Kua-Toa runs past to attack Nethza and the dog *does* get in an opp attack, just hitting for 10. The monitor Kua-Toa attacks Nethza, both hit, as does the bite; very not good; a big 23 damage. She's electrocuted and sort of stunned, so her reactions are dulled for a while.

Riglan feels he has no choice and risks his last charge of the wand at the priest. He only hits for 26 damage (8d6) but it's enough to take down the priest, and fortunately the spent wand is not destroyed. The aboleth psychically screams and we see the strange rivulets of green blood dissipate - we realise that the priest was *actively* channeling energy to the creature.

Before Riglan can ask the dragon to do anything, the aboleth tries to damage the monitor Kua-toa to actively pull life energy and stay up itself. It deals 16 damage, healing for the same.

Riglan shouts, "Dragon! Slimy creature!" - the dragon moves into position and tries for all 3 attacks. Gets 9 off the breath, misses with one swipe but gets 8 with another swipe. Riglan shouts, "and pull back!"  - the dragon moves out of melee range; the aboleth uses its attack of opportunity with its tail, but misses. That's exactly what Riglan was hoping for. "Good work dragon!" shouts an enthused Riglan.

Now the aboleth gets to act for real. It tries to enslave the dragon! The dragon would have failed its save (8+2) but the attempt acts in a similar manner to charming and the dragon is simply immune. It pursues back into melee range and hits twice, for 15 and 8. It manages to avoid the mucus on the first hit, but the second diseased hit seems to stick. Riglan shouts a reminder warning to everyone as he is alarmed to see the infection taking hold.

Nethza has the monitor Kua-toa in her face; she attacks twice with the Lightbringer mace, no tricks or extras available. At least both hit, for 10 and 8 respectively. She also manages to deal another 5 psychic damage to the aboleth, but it now sucks some psychic energy from the still-up Kua-toa monitor, dealing (and thus healing for) 9. The Kua-toa monitor falls to one knee, almost dead.

Temo aims and fires at the aboleth. He hits for 34 damage. The aboleth sinks beneath the surface. He shouts, "Keep at it, it might not be dead!". Maireagh moves around and uses Lightning Lure on the stricken monitor Kua-toa, which can't resist (fails strength save) and is pulled to melee range - 2d8 lightning damage which it surprisingly does not resist; this takes it down.

Nethza notices that she's healed a little - she thinks the aboleth is actually dead. Riglan thanks the dragon for its valour and sends its spirit back to the fey before its disease gets worse. Riglan casts L3 Conjure Animals for two under-water creatures of CR1, telling them to attack and confirm the aboleth's demise. His psychic connection shows that the creature is sinking; the hunter sharks that materialised ask how far they should follow. It looks like there's a hole or tunnel in the cavern base. Riglan thanks them and asks them to come back up to the shallows; he suspects that the aboleth will return one day, but possibly not for a while. At least the strange psychic creepy feeling has gone - a kind of low hum we'd heard the whole time we were here, but were not really even aware of until it went.

Temo knows that there's a just-under-water pathway that leads past the columns; the double doors to the temple stand over. Riglan sees that the cave water, while still fouled, is starting to look clearer; this is just a big cavern. There must be water jetting up from below which feeds the water.

We advance to the temple, sharks swimming either side of the raised shallow area. It looks ancient and alien; the language is unrecognisable, but Temo uses the helm and with Maireagh helping on the rather literal translation - "...what? There must be some kind of civilisation of the Kua-toa down here; the stonework down here is hundreds of years old; not quite 1000 years old but not far off". There's a natural stone altar in the middle looks even more old, thousands of years; the pillars and decorations around are the more recent. Temo gets the name - "Yngukulub The Devourer - well hopefully won't be devouring anyone else soon!" - an ancient being, apparently. He reads more from writing scribed on the walls which, over time, we believe to be a higher, but older form of Undercommon. "Woah! These people are crazy! None of this makes much sense; it's about 'worshipping live and death, giving blood and children and minds, giving our sanity to the Devourer'" - we realise they were all just controlled by the creature.

Investigation roll while he does this - 19+11, a good roll. We all notice while this happens that the water around us is beginning to settle and not flowing much; in fact, it's lowered a bit so the temple floor is now exposed. Lots of slime, but a mosaic is revealed that climbs up the walls and some internal columns as well as all along the floor. Elves, dwarves, humans, halflings, gnomes and more, are shown all descending on a spiral into the large double-row of teeth maw in the middle of the room. It's shown with tentacles on the side and a total of six eyes, which are formed from gem stones. We worry if it's right to take them, until Nethza reveals that - given her vision of slaves and consumption - we should tear the place to the ground. This whole thing should _never_ return; it was an abomination, all evil.

* 2x Blue sapphires
* 2x Fire opals
* 2x Black opals
* Mounted at the end of the altar are two magical weapons. We bag them up to identify later.

We also find many bones; rusted remnants of armour, weapons; four heavily rusted chains and manacles hang off the altar too. We smash those off, but can't do too much damage to the rest of it - that said, if the aboleth is gone, at least for a while then the existing Kua-toa may well reevaluate their religious choices.

Nethza borrows Maireagh's war hammer and spends a while communing with it to use as a hex weapon; then she smashes the mosaics on the ground. There's not much sign of anything organised cult-wise here and we're ill-equipped for the terrain; we're in part only alive through luck and spending a lot of spells and abilities. We just have enough fly time to get out to the waterfall steps, so we elect to leave rather than going in any further.

Maireagh's out of high level spells. Nethza can get her, Maireagh and the dog to fly; Riglan changes into a giant eagle and Temo is just about able to ride on his back. It's clumsy flying around with big wings in the space but it's big. As we're leaving we see more receding water; the temple is big - a lot of it was submerged.

We get to the side; there's no longer a waterfall. The lip of the cave is almost a foot above the water now. We fly over and get a sense for how truly huge this space is; this large area of waterfalls is far bigger than we ever expected to find. Nethza says, "Temo, do you still have the pyrotechnics wand? Would you light up the centre of the cavern?" - he does so. It's very loud! But it's also very bright.

The cavern is enormous. Two other massive waterfalls, over 100ft high, plunge down into a lake at the bottom of this 200+ft wide and deep (but irregular) space with a very high, domed ceilings. As the pyrotechnics start to fall down lower, we see smaller islands in the lake and, in the centre, three huge wrecked galleons. Free hanging small waterfalls hang down, dropping in one case onto one of the ships.

We continue up and out. Behind us, something moves in the water - looks like a water elemental starting to form; it doesn't seem to act, perhaps because we're leaving the space. It watches us leave.

At the stairwell base, by the waterfall, Maireagh says "well that was fun, can we go now?!" and we climb up. Riglan casts PWAT again through the staff, using its last charges, for stealth past the "brain cave" - at least we know the route along the fungi on the cave edge.

* Temo 27
* Riglan (adv) 28
* Nethza 20
* Maireagh 16

We make it; the creature is not disturbed. We sneak back into the sarcophagus room, and elect to wait out the night, taking watch turns as usual. Temo does some reading from the unknown mage's spell book to pass time; everyone else is a bit too beaten up. We eat and are able to relax.

### (2300 XP)



## DAY 104

We awake at the sarcophagus. We pay our respects, in genuine thanks for the safe and well-rested night. The Aid spell kicks in as a result.

Temo gains a clarity of thought. He'd awoken feeling guilty and foolish having run off and nearly - in his mind at least! - almost caused us all to be killed. Maireagh and Nethza had pointed out that it was a charm; he wasn't himself and it wasn't his fault; Maireagh succumbed briefly too after all, and we did a good thing. We freed everyone of that influence. With the Aid spell and this room, Temo can't be charmed here; he realises it, recognises the effect and his spirits lift.

After a while, we're good to go. Riglan suggests that perhaps we actually tackle the minotaur. He's in no hurry to deal with a Nothick again, but we survived a lot yesterday and at least this is on the periphery - assuming they're still there - rather than exploring deeper in the complex and perhaps getting caught off guard and overwhelmed by people running in from all sides, a bit like we almost were at the grand hallway entrance of the earth temple above.

We head back across the mines to the Western door again. As we go, Riglan, Perception 15+9. He gets a sense that there's something different this time. It's as if his senses are sharper somehow? Perhaps an effect from sleeping overnight in the sarcophagus room... He sees four spectres hovering at the edge of his vision near the collapsed rail tunnel to the North. They hold spectral chains that are drawn tight around the whole room. Pressed up against them, trying to push through, are spirits - they seem to be dwarves, as if trying to escape the mines. Riglan recalls the pictures from sarcophagus room of Grimlocks; the spectres are those creatures. The chains branch out in a strange fractal way and it seems that they're responsible for holding this strange cage in place. It feels like something that's been going for ages.

Riglan asks, "Maireagh, are you seeing this?!" "Sorry, no, what?! I thought you couldn't see in the dark?" and Riglan remembers to cast Darkvision - but could see it anyway. In low quiet tones he quickly explains what he sees... It's interesting with Darkvision how he now sees that the cave and chains don't entirely correspond; a different plane.

Riglan says, "so, umm, spectres - not sure - tricky I'd guess - attack? Set them free?" but he'll have to tell Maireagh where they are. Riglan suggests directing her for Faerie Fire, getting as close as he dares to the spectres to point out the area. It's quite a difficult thing to see apparently; neither Temo nor Nethza can see them. It'll be hard to fight things we can't even see. Maireagh gives it a try, casting as an artificer via her tools. Initiative immediately! It draws their attention.

* Nethza 22 (very alert!)
* Temo 21 (nervous and ready to spring into action)
* Maireagh 14 (a bit busy with the spell)
* Riglan 8 (entirely distracted by trying to direct the spell)

Before battle starts, the Faerie Fire takes effect, but only two of them are easily visible.

Nethza shouts, "Well, I can see two of them now!" and casts Hex on one of them. She moves forward as far as she can get and still be able to have a moment to attack; eldritch blasts fire out. She hits twice - 11 and 9 damage - hoping to take out one of the spectres, but it stays up; Nethza is surprised - her Hex has no effect. "It can't be cursed!" she shouts, and pulls out Lightbringer which glows brightly.

Temo fires at the other one he can currently see, his aim made easy thanks to the Faerie Fire spell. He hits, only managing 25 on a low roll, but it's enough; the spectre expires, blinking out of visibility and vanishing. He backs up a little into a nook and with Riglan helping hide his movements, tries to keep out of view; stealth total roll 31.

The visible remaining spectre attacks Nethza, with some kind of life draining effect; she manages to squirm away from its grasp, holding Lightbringer forth to try and keep it at bay. Maireagh is concentrating on the spell, "How many did you say there were?!" "Four!" and tries to describe very roughly where they are, but all Maireagh can do for now is swing at the visible one on Nethza; she hits for 13 and this takes it down. But there are two more! She runs forward where Riglan indicates and swings wildly, hoping to hit something; but does not connect. The dog goes next to Riglan and stands guard, ready to dodge an attack. Maireagh drops her now-useless spell.

Suddenly, appearing right next to her, is a chosen-to-be-visible spectre which attacks, catching her by surprise and getting in contact. It drains life for 14 damage, but she shrugs off any worse effects. Riglan runs around and tries to use his lighting wand to take out the one Maireagh can't see - it's right next to her, and he shouts a warning - but not only does the spectre dodge the weapon, it also seems to not take much harm (37 halved to 18 halved again to 9, resistance). He shouts "sorry, that didn't work very well!" and activates his staff in case of melee.

The spectre Riglan had hit flies *through* the cave and attacks Riglan. It *just* misses as a surprised Riglan reels back, the spectre being unable to get through the innate magic of the dragon hide hauberk. Nethza says, "Oh no you don't!" and runs to flank Riglan's aggressive spectre, attacking with the mace with flanking advantage. She hits twice. Finally, Lightbringer is being used for its true purpose; hex didn't work, but Lightbringer's radiance does. 14 and 16 damage respectively cause the spectre to fall. Riglan sees that the network of chains now starts to crumble and fall, huge holes appearing.

Temo aims and fires. He does hit, but an even *worse* damage roll leads to only 23 damage. The spectre stays up. Temo curses as the spectre goes for Maireagh again. Temo's too far for Silvery Barbs; the spectre does hit. She takes another 7 damage but *just* manages to resist worse effects. She attacks immediately in retaliation; the first misses in her anger, but she focuses and the second connects, for 11 damage, taking down the spectre.

Riglan sees the whole network of chains collapse. The spectre dwarves all start to move past. In every direction, platinum stairs appear. The spirits start to ascend. A shining apparition of a stern dwarf warrior in brilliantly shining gold armour walks out of the door behind us - the sarcophagus room - nods to each of us in turn, reaching Maireagh last. It walks up to her, draws its warhammer and lays it at her feet, kisses her forehead and walks towards one of the stairs, then sort of fades away in a cloud of gold dust or light.

Riglan stutters after a moment of quiet - "*please* tell me you all saw that?!" - but Maireagh is, for perhaps the first time, speechless. At her feet lies a *real* warhammer. Or rather, *THE* real warhammer. He was trapped too by these spectres. On a hunch, Riglan returns to the sarcophagus room; it's just a room now. The magic is gone. Riglan walks to the sarcophagus, lays his hand on it, says "thank you", then returns to the group.

Temo, Riglan, Nethza and the dog congregate a short distance away, giving Maireagh some room. Riglan puts his arm around Nethza and hugs her and puts a hand on Temo's shoulder. The dog is close by, pushed up against Riglan's leg as if it were a real pet dog.

We spend a while as Maireagh figures out what the hammer can do. She has to attune to it so we go back into the now-normal sarcophagus room and rest. Maireagh elects to allow herself to be a little more vulnerable (AC 19 not 20) by treating her repulsion shield as a regular shield for now; she carefully stows her longsword in her magic bag. Now she will use her warhammer, which gives her some much-wanted extra options for ranged attack.

Eventually, we head back. The mines are quiet and feel safer to us now. We go through the Western door and approach the stairs, heading up to the chamber where we previously saw the minotaur and Nothic. Riglan decides to call his friendly bat to just make sure the room isn't full of new minotaurs or something, so it flies up and hangs near the entrance to get a look inside.

Previously-seen minotaur Zegdar is there, apparently in some kind of angry conversation with two other minotaurs that seem deferential. The two start to leave and he follows; the Nothic is there too, but seems to want to avoid the two newcomers. They leave the room, walking out along a natural passageway at the opposite end to the bat. The bat flies after them, reaching a circular large cavern where one large section is just a gaping hole that descends down and above as far as the bat can make out. A lot of heat seems to emanate. A strange stone disc appears to hover in the shaft. A humanoid is on the disk. The two minotaurs stand aside and Zegdar moves forward; the Nothic crawls forward in front of the stone disc, being careful near the edge (important safety tip!) and the Nothic speaks in broken Common, interspersed with other words Riglan can't figure out.

"Guard", "Beware", "Has fallen", "Strengthen forces", "Let none pass"; the Nothic turns and speaks to Zegdar in a native tongue Riglan can't understand. The hooded humanoid throws back a hood looks on closer inspection - as best as bat sonar will allow - is a woman. Seems to shrug in annoyance, "Very well, fine. *Fine*." Zegdar barks out something. The two minotaurs run out and come back with three more. The new arrivals kneel at the edge of the shaft and then step back. Some kind of gout of flame seems to come out of her hands at the three minotaurs who yelp in pain, but then the heat seems to be absorbed into them. "You are blessed. You have the blessing of Imix. Now do your job!" - the grovelling Nothic does kind of grovelling things; there's a response in a strange, crackling language that almost sounds like fire; then, "Very well, one secret. *ONE*." - the Nothic stands forward and seems to be engorging itself on something somehow - nothing visible - before the stone disk sinks. Zegdar and the Nothic leave by another passage, one of two other passages leaving the chamber. The three that were singed walk down the second passage and the two originals remain in the chamber.

We realise suddenly that we never did find the entrance to the lower levels for Unrayle, but we're here now and we know where *this* is and we did figure that we'd stay at one level at a time.

Riglan pulls back the bat, explains the situation and we creep up the stairs heading towards the "shaft cavern". We'll try to draa those two minotaurs out towards us, rather than fight in such a hazardous room. Temo and Riglan go through the chamber where we first saw the Zegdar and near the opposite tunnel, then use Druidcraft and Minor Illusion combined as a "Hay!" yell and flash of light to draw attention. The bat is used so Riglan can see if the minotaurs are coming. Temo uses Silent Image a bit further back, giving the impression of a clear bright image of Riglan running away; since he's trying to deceive, he rolls deception for total 17. He overlays Minor Illusion for footsteps. Riglan shows off and uses Druidcraft as a followup for a puff of wind in their direction, so maybe they'll think we were attacking or casting some spell.

The others position themselves further back in the room, with Nethza activating her armour and Riglan his staff (while watching through the bat's sonar vision).

The minotaurs hear the Druidcraft shout and look over; they are fooled by Temo's deception. Riglan via the bat sees the minotaurs approach and warns the party. Initiative:

* Temo 25 (nat 20!)
* Nethza 18
* Maireagh 17
* Riglan 17

Temo runs up the corridor and stealth (nat 20 again?!) isn't seen (the Riglan illusion masks him). He fires at the first minotaur he sees, with advantage. Nat 3 then nat 20 a third time... Total damage roll of 12d6+6 is 48. He hastily retreats back to the cavern as the minotaur roars, probably thinking that Riglan did that - Temo shouts, "Riglan, I think he's annoyed at you..."

Annoyingly it turns out the minotaurs move quickly (40ft) and surprises Riglan by managing to get all the way down the corridor at right up against him - it charges recklessly, but the dog interferes a little as it approaches. Despite the surprise of its speed, the minotaur manages to miss - Temo's fading illusion ran "through" the real Riglan off to the side a bit. It roars very loudly, which doubtless will cause more creatures in the area to come to its aid.

Nethza runs around to get a line of sight past Riglan and transfers her hex (which she still has from the spectres) to the minotaur. It's just far enough away to try eldritch blast, but people and walls provide half cover. Despite this she gets two good hits. 11, 16 damage. It's badly hurt but still up.

The minotaur roars again - Riglan and the dog need to make con saves; we fail; but only take 1 fire damage each, from strange hot embers that the creature is breathing. Riglan remembers what the hooded figure did earlier.

Maireagh swings her new hammer. She hits for 14 with her first swing, killing the creature. She drags the creature out of the tunnel entrance and pushes in front along with the dog to provide some blocking against more foes running in.

Riglan sees no more enemies so backs away a bit and readies Frostbite. As soon as he sees anything coming around the corner he'll release the spell.

We hear distant sounds of shouting and guttural speech, then stomping of feet. It takes a while for them to get louder but eventually another minotaur appears and Riglan releases his spell; it fails to avoid the effects, taking 7 cold damage (and its first weapon strike, if any on its turn, will be at disadvantage).

Temo is up. Aims and fires, simple. He hits for a middling 23 damage. We hear the sounds of more movement from the far corridor.

Nethza moves her hex again and moves in behind the dog for a better view; still blocked a bit with half cover; eldritch blasts are thrown; both do again hit, yay; 15 and 14 damage.

Maireagh wants to try throwing her hammer but once again the minotaur is in her face so she just has to use melee attacks, hitting twice for 15 and 10. This is enough to take this minotaur down, which seems to have been a bit less hardy. This time the dog pulls away the body. She and the dog reposition to give Nethza a better look down the corridor and perhaps give Maireagh a chance to throw her hammer.

Riglan is again faced with nobody visible, so just has to do the same thing and hold another Frostbite back until he sees someone. Soon enough, a third minotaur appears and the spell is released. It fails and there's the same damage roll again too - 6+1 - 7; deja vu! More shouts and noises from this one and we see another minotaur rushes in behind.

Temo runs behind Maireagh to get a look down the corridor and uses her to hide (18!+13) - the minotaurs simply can't see him at all, so he fires with advantage and the leader. Nat 20?! on the first roll again. Nice to have the nat 20 but the damage roll is very bad; 36 damage.

There are distant thudding and shouting noises. The minotaur in front lurches forward a bit; we guess that even more are trying to push through behind. Seeing this, Nethza transfers her hex and fires two blasts now with a clear line of sight. Both hit, for a total 35 damage; it falls, partially blocking the corridor.

Now it's Maireagh's turn to have to ready an attack - she starts spinning her hammer in readiness to throw. Riglan has to do the same as well with yet another Frostbite cued up. We're both ready.

A lead minotaur runs over the body of the other; Riglan casts his spell as it's not quite in range for Maireagh, but only for 4 damage and **Maireagh throws her hammer for the first time. Natural 20!** - 4d8+8 and does 33 damage; the minotaur finishes its charge nonetheless and recklessly attacks Nethza; it looks like it's going to hit, Temo tries to distract with Silvery Barbs, but it doesn't help (in fact the creature rolled 19 and after Silvery Barbs rolled 20, but has to take the lower roll). It hits Nethza for 4d8+4; she takes 27 damage. She loses her armour, but in turn the minotaur takes 10 damage. She gets pushed back and knocked prone. Now the minotaur breathes hot embers out, hitting, Maireagh, Temo and the prone Nethza; Temo dodges easily and takes no damage (dex save -> not half). Maireagh and Nethza manage to dodge and squirm out of the way respectively, and would take 7 damage each but have fire resistance, so both only take 3 in practice.

Temo sees this go down and has to be brave; he risks aiming and firing, holding his ground; he hits well, for 30 damage. This minotaur is hardy and while very badly injured now, it's still up. At this moment, another minotaur looms up behind the injured one.

Nethza gets back up and moves the hex onto the minotaur. She hits twice with an eldritch blasts and takes the creature down. Now Maireagh has a clear line of sight to the newest arrival minotaur in the corridor; she throws her hammer and hits for 12 damage, then throws again, hitting again for 13 damage. She gets the dog to pull the minotaur body clear. Afterwards the dog runs forward, guarding the corridor.

The low damage of the frost spell is countered by the distractions it is providing; Riglan uses it again, and once again it takes effect and pleasingly for a maximum 12 damage this time. He casts a L1 healing spell for Nethza too, healing for 10; Riglan also shouts, "Don't forget Zegdar and that Nothic! Keep your eyes peeled!"

On cue, we see, crawling along the *ceiling* of the tunnel is the Nothic. The dog and Nethza are within range of its glare. Netzha is attacked with an attempt to gain insight; she rolls a 12 for 17 deception against the Nothic's high roll of 18+4, so it gets into her head. It says, "That one! That one! Not fire, but everything else, yes! Very afraid of herself...?" - and it casts Rotting Gaze. She resists its effects easily, though (con save 19+4) and avoids any damage.

Now the hulking Zegdar appears, pushing over the body of the fallen minotaur in the corridor and apparently barking orders in the language we don't understand. We get the gist of it! The minotaur in front suddenly seems to be filled with fire - its eyes light up, its breath blazes and embers start to rise off its body.

Temo aims and fires at the Nothic's eye, given that it got into Nethza's head. He hits for a total of 30 damage. It shuts its eye and moves before being blinded but is still badly hurt. It falls from the ceiling, in between the minotaur and Zegdar; the first minotaur seems almost repulsed by this and pushes it away.

The lead minotaur can't wait to get further away from the nothic! It doesn't have room to charge, but walks up and tries to push the dog out of the way, which it does easily. This gives the minotaur a way to squeeze into the room and it now breathes fire at Riglan and Temo. We knew our line would be breached sooner or later! Temo dodges fine, but Riglan completely fails to avoid the blast; dex save 8+0, taking 11 damage.

Nethza transfers the hex to the Nothic and hits with two eldritch blasts. She hits for 11 and 15 - which kills it! Meanwhile, Maireagh attacks the fire-breathing minotaur that's now next to her and hits twice, for 9 and 14 damage. The dog runs around as she does this, flanking and getting in a good bite for 10 damage.

Riglan tries once more with frostbite to counter the fire breathing. It can't resist the effects, takes 9 damage and falls. That's good, but now we're facing down Zegdar.

Zegdar picks up the nothic, looks at it - almost looking sad for a moment - but then tosses the body over his shoulder! He roars and we see, as with the other minotaur, flaming eyes, embers and so-on; it recklessly charges at Nethza. Temo tries to distract and it's just enough to cause a miss; he gives the advantage to Nethza. Now Zegdar breathes fire, hitting Temo (who saves, taking no damage) Nethza and Maireagh (who both save and take half-then-half damage of 6d6 23->11->5). Nethza continues to hold her hex (as with any prior damage - all were rolled even if not noted).

The recklessly enraged Zegdar lifts his great axe above his head and roars; Temo can see an opening as Zegdar's chain mail lifts when he raises his arms. Temo fires and his bolt hits for a big 34 damage - doesn't even need to aim. Temo backs away a little to try and keep a bit further from fire breath range.

Nethza is right next to Zegdar, so she pulls Lightbringer out and taking advantage of his recklessness swings at Zegdar. She does only hit once, but does 17 damage. Maireagh is far enough to throw her hammer; she manages to hit with both of two throws, for a big 20 and decent 17 damage. The dog squeezes in and takes its turn, hitting too, for 7 damage. Zegdar isn't close to falling, but he certainly looks injured.

Riglan tries to increase his damage and runs up for poison spray. It takes effect but only for 11 damage (2d12). He backs away as far as he can, to try and keep away from the fire breath.

Zegdar attacks recklessly again, the dog trying to distract but he hits Nethza regardless. He does 22 slashing and 7->3 fire damage (but again she holds the Hex). No fire breath this time; it seems the flame in his throat hasn't entirely rekindled.

With Zegdar focused on Nethza and a failed attempt to breathe fire, Temo uses this distraction to his advantage and fires. He hits for 25 damage - right into Zegdar's mouth, almost by chance. Zegdar turns to look at Temo with a surprised expression - then the fire sputters out and Zegdar falls.

We moment of tense waiting and listening - anything else? Nothing seems to be coming.

Riglan drops the unicorn spirit and casts L1 healing for Nethza, 10 with everyone getting 9 from the unicorn. During the rest, Nethza and Maireagh chat. We aren't encountering many undead now, so Maireagh suggests Nethza try the longsword for a bit. Nethza suggests that Riglan carry Lightbringer as backup weapon - he's got plenty of carrying strength and finds a place he can stow it for quick access from behind his pack.

Temo investigates the room and bodies (9+11). He discovers that the **flaming greataxe of Zegdar came from a pair of gauntlets that Zegdar wore, not the axe itself**. They seem to need atunement, so for now, we stow them in Maireagh's bag. There's a chest at the foot of Zegdar's bet which is easily unlocked; it contains an equivalent of 220gp in various coins along with a potion which he manages to identify by himself, just about, that it's a **potion of fire breath**.

Suddenly, Nethza explains, "Oh! Dammit!" and points out that she totally forgot she has the flying wing cloak from the manticore and didn't need the spell on herself when were at the water node. Oops! Doggie could've flown. One to try and remember next time!

Well, that's genocide done for the day (!) - Emberhorn Tribe, probably all of them? Scary stuff.

### (1375 XP)

We drag the bodies all into this room and into a corner, then follow the passage to the "shaft cavern". It's a huge hole that goes both up and down. The floating disk isn't here - it's presumably stayed down low. There's a kind of platform that extends maybe 10ft from the edge, probably for access to the floating disk; this is where the Nothic had been grovelling. Two other narrow passages lead away, as we already know. The emberhorns seemed to have come from the middle passage, so thinking that maybe that's just a barracks or something we head there. It does look like living quarters; bed rolls and furs, that kind of thing. Looks like it'd house 5 around a small urn with coals. Two more exits, both heading down stairs as well, heading roughly South-East and South-West. We think the South-West stairs go to the same chamber as the other exit that we'd seen Zegdar use in the shaft cavern so we go that way to investigate that room first.

We descend from a natural cavern but down carved stairs. They're not Dwarven make, though; curved, smooth and rounded. They descend only around 15ft over a 20ft stretch, opening out into a chamber that is again a constructed room rather than a natural chamber. It's roughly circular, dressed and finished inside whatever cavern was here (or carved out) in a rather (in Earth terms) Art Nouveaux motif decorated stone. The ceiling is elaborate but looks unfinished. Writing on the walls looks almost elven; Riglan suspects Drow and asks Temo to use the helm. Riglan provides some light from his shoulder-mounted continual flame.

As Temo reads, he sees that the script flows down the walls all across the floor, though much of it is rubbed out from footfall. There are several overlapping circles each containing concentric rings with a rune in the middle. The flowing script from the walls surrounds the circles. Temo arcana 18+3. These are old, but no longer complete (due to damage) and functional, circles of binding or control. Each ring is a different spell. The central ring would summon demons. It looks like the surrounding circles then try to capture or control them; they wouldn't be able to pass beyond. The scripts around are incantations in whatever language this is. Certainly seems related to Elven, quite old; the helm helps him read it, but not identify its nature.

Maireagh thinks the room must be over 1,500 years old, at least, given all the footfall wear and tear. The writing, says Temo, calls the room "The Conjury". We feel lucky that it's not in working order.

There are the two exits we already know of; there's also a dark alcove that looks like it might have initially just darkness but as we approach with light we see it's a *wall* of darkness, like a spell. The light doesn't pass through. Riglan puts out the light, Temo puts on his goggles and Riglan calls back the bat to have it fly in and see if its blindsight echo location can discern anything.

The bat flies through about 15 feet of strange darkness then seems to emerge. Even its echo location sight does not work - it's lucky to fly in a straight line and not hit anything! Bat perception 14+1 (no advantage; "sight" only check). The chamber it is in looks similar in style to the one we're in. It's big - maybe 90ft long, somewhat irregular, so the ends aren't in sight, with a tall ceiling maybe 40-50ft at the peak. Towards the back within sight range is some kind of building that is maybe 20ft tall with a pointed roof and pointed sides. Riglan doesn't recognise it from visions though it might look similar somewhat to some of Riglan's earlier dreams; Elven leanings again. Riglan religion 13-1; he recognises enough to recognise that it's a tomb, though it resembles a temple. It is a crypt.

The bat listens (perception adv. only 12,13+1). It doesn't hear anything much, which is almost strange in itself. Even air doesn't seem to move around much here. The bat feels uneasy in here; the air feels really stale. We have a brief conversation and given that this place looks important but it's literally too quiet, we wait a few minutes, with Riglan listening intently through the bat. After a few minutes, perception 12,15+1, there's maybe almost a very faint sound of movement? In addition along the Southern side of the cavern there is the continuation that goes beyond sight but at the edges of vision there seems to be something flowing or moving; something that sounds like flames maybe, but the bat notices no heat.

Riglan asks the bat to brave some movement in, to land on the temple/crypt roof. There's quite a clear picture of the northern part of the cavern and not much behind the crypt building. Then it cautiously flies south to get a better look there. The strange flame-like sound gets a bit louder. There's another small cavern alcove leading to a tunnel towards the South that's alongside whatever these strange surface movement flame things are.

Riglan pops the bat back and we decide we kind of have to proceed; we're alert because of the known movement in there, potential hidden attackers, Temo keeps his hand on his sling. 

Temo creeps through the 15ft and tries to get into the cavern and keep close to he wall in hiding in the dark - maybe. Stealth 25. He can't see much though; perception only 12. There's a strange blackish red light here from low flames dancing on a pool of liquid off to the left. Oily maybe. Not much heat. Riglan follows. Everyone else comes in.

Riglan perception total 27 - looks for threats. He is more confident in the similarity to old dreams now. There are incomplete carvings around smoothed parts of cavern walls. Carvings on the floor too, lots of ancient wards around the crypt, lines which we think must have arcane significance; the crypt bears on the portico all four elemental symbols surrounding an upside-down ziggurat with a vertical slit eye engraved. But this is not the temple of elemental evil, it's something else. It's maybe 20ft high and 30ft x 40ft footprint, so not that big.

Riglan fires up his innate Detect Magic. Perception - nat 20 + 9. Most of the runes are old and warn, except for one solid ring that encircles the entrance of the crypt. This ring is magical - the crypt itself is not - and forms a still-active barrier that forbids any Drow from entering. It's tuned specifically to Drow! Riglan also detects a spike of magic coming from a dark corner where some kind of humanoids are hiding with invisibility.

Riglan whispers to his party, "runes guard the door and prohibit Drow from entering. There are some humanoids hiding with invisibility in the dark corner to our right... I doubt they want to be friends..." - insight 15+5 - whatever is hiding there, given where we are, must know we're here.

Riglan says louder, "Show yourselves; we will only fight if we have to defend ourselves". Nothing happens. Temo tries to turn on the charm - tries to get them to appear or at least speak - persuasion 16+12 (!).

A figure emerges from the corner and walks forward. We recognise a studded-leather wearing, male Drow. He walks elegantly, guarded with a shield; he holds a hand crossbow and carries a short sword, currently sheathed. He keeps to the shadows, away from the strange flame light. Confident but wary, saying nothing.

Riglan tries, "We met someone called a Quori once and learned something of what that means to Drow culture" - perception 20+9 - a flash of hateful spite at that word, almost an instinctive hatred at the concept of a Drow that is that way, quickly masked - "yes I'm aware of what a Quori is", it answers and points its finger at the tomb and says, "You come here, to seek this Quori?" Riglan goes, "well, we could tell that you were not of that nature youreslves" "of course not, I am true Drow - we are descendants of Lolth, the one and only true goddess of all Drow. We do not worship demons disguised as false gods." Riglan says, "Yes, it is very troubling that some would worship the Elemental Eye or its elemental princes. We come here to investigate such mistakes. Does such a Drow lie within that crypt?"

The drow looks puzzled. "What are you doing here?" Riglan shrugs and says, "Attempting to stop worshippers of elemental princes from bringing them through to this plane". "But why are you *here?*" and Riglan says, "We are exploring this area; this crypt looks like a temple I saw in a vision, but is not that temple. I seek understanding."

Insight 20+5. So many nat 20s today, weird. It says, "The temple  you seek is that way" - points South, and this is truthful - but there's something it omits. Riglan repeats, "And what of this crypt, who lies within?" Out of the darkness steps a second male Drow. This one is dressed in black plate of some kind, higher ranking, skin jet black/purple covered in cobweb design tattoos of blood red colour, a topknot of piercingly white hair. It strides elegantly but forcefully towards Riglan. In stuttering Common - "You have stumbled into something far beyond your comprehension! Within this is something we do not know; that we cannot know; all we do know is that Vizeran DeVir *is*."

Riglan asks, "And what if one of our kind entered?" The two converse in another language. Undercommon, perhaps. The first one answers, "That great knowledge is lost to us for all eternity. We know not with wisdom the solution you seek." It's hard to understand the exact meaning with the language barrier (insight 7+5). They then continue to converse in another language. The captain moves back into the shadows. The other says "We take our leave of you now. Your path diverges in darkness from ours" and he leaves too.

All we can guess is that maybe this Vizeran DeVir perhaps is in this crypt or related to it and is probably Quori. Whether or not the temple is dangerous or safe was a deliberately dodged question. Riglan figures he could not himself know if this means it's safe for them and would give them knowledge the Drow cannot access, or dangerous and the Drow want them to go to their doom.

Before he fully leaves, Nethza, recognising that perhaps the language barrier is an issue, steps forward - Temo knows what's coming and pops on the helm - and in Undercommon, Nethza says - "Wait! Wait... Let's try with more respect with your people. We will speak your tongue" - the captain turns, looking spiteful - "We do not consort with devilfolk or demonkind!" "You are mistaken. I am neither demon nor devil and, besides, I am merely the translator hired by these people. You do not need to engage with me, but I will relay their wishes and yours as the conduit of conversation."

They their best but there's a deep-seated hatred of Tieflings too - so they either hate the language or hate the translator. We sort of repeat our enquiries. We eventually discern that they're still dodging the question of the crypt. They believe that Vizeran DeVir has *something* to do with the temple, but Riglan thinks they're not actually sure perhaps if this person - a Quori - is in the temple or still alive; they seem incredulous that we don't know any of this too, we're just bumbling fools to them - DeVir created the weapons of elemental power 900 years ago (like Drown the trident). They sometimes seem to halt as if they're unsure they should tell us, but at the same time, the Captain seems to just say things in a "what harm can it do" kind of way - if we act on anything, they think we'll die; we're clearly doomed so it doesn't matter. At times it certainly sounds like they're trying to goad us into entering the crypt, but they don't know what's in it.

But Nethza asks, what are *they* doing here, hiding in the corner? Riglan insight 10, Temo insight 2-1. It's one of those frustrating things - we roll a lot of nat 20s, but come away not really any wiser about anything in detail. We did however gain one big insight - Vizeran DeVir is a quori, an outcast of the Drow, who came here hundreds of years ago and created the elemental weapons. These elemental weapons appear to be quite important. They seem critical in some way. So it might be that either the weapons can be used against the princes or by them, and/or are perhaps needed as part of helping to bring the princes through.

Riglan remembers how the "prophets" had descended on vision quests and received a weapon that they believed signified their divinity. Gar had Drown, Marloss had the spike that he dragged which he wrote about in his journal and we saw in action messing up the floor and calling forth an earth elemental when we met him at his sanctum. Drown was a sliver of Olyhdra, given the way it behaved when destroyed and how it talked to Riglan. Perhaps these other weapons contain similar slivers.

So that ends up being the epiphany. It's not the people that are the threat - they don't hold "the" power - it's the weapons. The people are agents through which the weapons act.

It's odd that anything the say about Vizeran DeVir, despite differences in opinion they have about whether it was 600 or 900 or whatever years ago, was *after* the fall of Besilmir. Vizeran appears to be responsible for the *current* cycle but why did he do that and is he still alive? It also means that this "plot" started centuries ago. Why don't Vizeran or whoever entombed him want the Drow to know what's in there?

The captain eventually asks point-blank: Are we going in or are we wasting their time?

Riglan walks through ward and pauses. The party follows and Riglan motions for them to stay back for a moment. He walks up the stairs slowly to the door. He beckons the party to walk forward within the ward a short distance, then pushes the door open while watching the Drow carefully. They're in turn watching us very carefully; they seem expectant. Riglan looks inside.

It's a dark long room, just under 30ft wide, 40ft deep, with a slightly-bigger-than-a-person stone sarcophagus raised on a dais. There are all manner of drawings of demons and other infernal things all around. The sarcophagus itself has the words "Vizeran DiVere" looped around (Temo reads this with the helm) and on the top is the symbol of just the elemental eye, with nothing else around. Then we hear shouting outside; Nethza says they want to know if the body is in here. OK, so Riglan cautiously shifts the stone slab to the side at one end nearest the door. There's nothing inside. He leans in and uses his light to double check; not even sand or dust or anything. Empty.

Temo yelps. His sling buzzes wildly at him. Above us, in the ceiling, we see the stones moving! Something small drops down - it's a grick. Then a much larger one drops down. Then what we thought was a sort of roof structure detaches - it had been almost rib-like - and now this massive bone serpent cracks out.

Riglan says to Nethza, "...uuuh, let's tell them in person?!" and turns to run out. Temo runs first, shouting, "It's empty, but there's all kinds of bad shit trying to kill us now! Some help maybe?!" but as he starts to descend the steps he is narrowly missed by a hand-crossbow bolt fired by the younger Drow solider. The Drow captain has his sword drawn and emerging from the shadows, holding a small crackling ball of lightning, is a Drow mage. Temo shouts a warning back at the party but keeps running - we need space if we're going to have this fight.

Nethza's next out with Riglan just behind, then Maireagh and the dog. As Riglan gets past the door to the top of the stairs, he notices that the runic ward guarding against the Drow has broken. So *that* was they were goading us to go inside! When we walked in, we wore out enough of the runes on the ground to break the circle. He glances over quickly and clearly sees the Drow mage from the bright magic glow, realising that it's not even been 10 minutes and he still has Detect Magic going. Initiative:

* Temo 21 (dodged a crossbow bolt so is *well* aware!)
* Nethza 15 (just in front of Riglan phyiscally)
* Maireagh 8 (at the back, starts still inside the doors)
* Riglan 7 (distracted by the mage and wards)

The lower-level warrior Drow pulls his short sword, runs up to melee range of Temo and attacks. The first misses but the second would hit for 9 piercing + 7 poison => 16 damage, but at the last minute Temo dodges a little and only takes 8 total. The drow mage is about to cast a spell but Temo has a chance to act. He risks an opp attack (which misses) to run without disengaging and hides behind a pillar so the mage can't see him (stealth 30). He attacks the mage who is just at the very edge of the range of his darkvision goggles. He decides to risk a miss by pulling the bow back harder, less accurate but more force (sharpshooter feat - -5 on attack roll for +10 damage) since mages are often squishy and he has advantage. Nat 20 + 10 - 5; the feat allows this as a critical hit, regardless of the -5. He rolls 5+1+6 -> 12 piercing, 22 + 20 on the crit sneak and +10 for sharpshooter, for a ridiculous **64 damage in a single attack**. The mage throws up some kind of magic shield, but the luck of the attack bypasses it totally; the mage crumples to the ground, too weak to stand, but still alive, just barely. He misty steps and vanishes. We have no idea where he's gone.

Nethza is on the stairs and close to the drow solider that just attacked Temo. She transfers her hex and throws two eldritch blasts; the first just misses (16), the second sadly misses too. It's a slippery character - it dodges while apparently unfazed, Matrix bullet time stylee. She pulls out the longsword and closes in to melee range.

Back in the temple, the smaller grick creeps along the wall, drops down and attacks Maireagh in the doorway but its tentacles miss as she notices and dodges out the way.

The captain starts yelling something. Temo's got his goggles on not his helm so doesn't understand. Nethza doesn't know the language either. The captain runs up within about 10ft of Nethza, pulls a whip out and lashes it at her, hitting for 7 damage. He then barks some sort of presumed command because the adjacent solider reacts quickly, trying to attack but missing. Then he radiates some kind of darkness around himself, enveloping himself, the soldier and Nethza.

Maireagh shouts that she's going to try and block the door for us, and attacks the small grick; she hits twice for 24 damage total. The dog hits for 9, which is enough to kill the creature. The dog runs alongside her to try and block the door. She urges us to get out - we kinda already are... The bone naga moves in across the ceiling and drops to the floor in front of Maireagh. It powers up to shoots a bolt of lightning and Maireagh calls a hasty warning. The bolt through Maireagh, Riglan and Nethza (who it hits by luck as she's in darkness). Surprisingly Riglan rolls a 19+0 on his dex save; Maireagh makes her save too; Nethza ducks when she hears Maireagh's warning, so we all only take half of what might have happened. We all take 12 points of lightning damage.

Riglan can't see Nethza, the two drow there, or the mage who suddenly vanished despite the Detect Magic spell. He activates his totem - uses the Hawk this time. He tries to find the mage; the hawk aids; 15+9 perception; he can see a lot of the cavern within a 60ft Darkvision radius; he sees the mage trying to hide from Temo, tucked into a corner. He tries Frostbite since the mage looks very injured and it might be enough; the spell's power gives it the potential to deal 7 damage. The mage can't make the Con-19 save and takes the 7 points. Riglan's sight line is bad enough that he's not sure if the mage is actually down. He heads down the steps to clear out of the lightning bolt line, hopefully! He shouts to Nethza to make sure she makes a noise when she's going to attack.

In the crypt, the large grick creeps to where the small grick was - perhaps a baby?! - and attacks Maireagh. It seems enraged... Yeah. Baby. Oh boy. It reaches with its tentacles and hits (4d8+4, but only) 13 damage. Its beak closes in too, hitting again for 19 damage; and its tail tries to constrict her, and as she reels from the first two attacks does hurt her for another 10. She shouts, "Fuck!" and Riglan realises she's in trouble, since grumpy as she is, that's not her normal language at all.

The Drow solider hears a command barked from the commander and suddenly dashes away; Nethza shouts, Riglan reacts and encourages the hawk totem to help, cancelling disadvantage; she uses the opportunity to use the weapon with Booming Blade enabled (Warcaster feat). She hits and the booming blade immediately activates as the Drow is running, dealing a total of 27 damage (it's hexed too). Not bad for an opportunity attack! It runs full bore (maximum range) and reaches the mage, as if protecting him or administering aid. Riglan can't see that far.

Temo can't see much, just that Drow, sheltering the mage. He uses his missile wand and hits for only 11 damage. We're all about to learn that the mage wasn't killed and Riglan should've used his lightning wand... The mage walks out looking like he'd just taken a healing potion. He casts a spell and walks into the dark region. The spell is carefully positioned and hits everyone except the captain. A poisonous yellow-green fog spreads out; the area is heavily obscured and the gas feels like it's burning on skin contact.

Temo realises what this is (burning a reaction to check arcana - 17+3). He shouts to Riglan, "they're using magic. All of this is magic. It can be countered. It can be dispelled."

Nethza is in the dark *and* in the smog. She is affected badly and takes 28 damage (very high roll - 58d -> max 40). She just clings onto her hex spell. She shouts, "is anyone outside?!" and there's just lots of coughing as we're all in the area. She staggers in a random direction trying to get out. By chance, it gets her clear, on Temo's side of the crypt. She shouts, trying to get people to head towards her or away. She's able to throw eldritch blasts at the hexed Drow soldier who helped the mage; she hits twice for 13+13 damage. Suddenly she's enveloped in darkness; the captain has run up and is attacking her. She's hit twice for 14 + 28 (!) poison and is nearly down as a result. The drow captain is yelling other commands but we can't see anything.

Maireagh resists some of the smog taking 7 damage, as she's got Dwarven poison resistance. She tries to disengage from the creatures and run towards Nethza's call from earlier. She is unlucky enough to run just out of the smog cloud, but straight into darkness from the captain. She gets the dog to follow. It attempts an attack in the dark from Maireagh's guess at Nethza's location and the sounds of battle, and despite disadvantage it finds the Drow captain and deals 10 damage. At the sound of this connecting, Maireagh uses its Arcane Jolt to restore some health to Nethza (2d6 -> 10, bringing her up to just 22). Surprisingly, the darkness falls; it seems the dog's hit was enough to break concentration on the spell.

Riglan thinks something move past him, but can't see enough to know that it's the Bone Naga, blindly travelling forwards through the fog. Riglan takes 14 damage, and staggers backwards emerging out of the smog. He runs sideways to try and see what's going on from all the noise and immediately spots the mage, revealed after darkness fell; Riglan draws the wand and fires. He fries the mage with 37 damage and smog dissipates. Riglan also shifts his totem nearer the now-moved main group.

Now the grick emerges into the fray; it attacks Temo. The tentacles miss the slippery halfling so the beak can't act, but the tail hits hard for 16 damage.

Now the irritating Drow solider, still up, casts darkness around himself. FFS. It doesn't quite envelope Nethza and the captain, though. Temo runs out and seeing Nethza in trouble, attacks; he does hit, but has a bad damage roll, only 23.

Nethza is about to attack and Riglan reacts, using his hawk totem to help guide her. She actually chooses to attack the solider Drow in the darkness; Riglan's hawk spirit guides her to negate disadvantage. She hits for a big 32 damage; this takes down the Drow; she pulls the soul of the Drow as a spectre and transfers the hex to the Captain. She turns to face him and take out her sword, then commands the spectre to attack. It hits, doing 13 (3d6, not bad) damage but the Drow captain resists any other effects.

The captain now acts in response. He disengages and backs away, then levitates! He rises up about 20ft up.

Maireagh's up. She ignores the captain and turns to look at the Bone Naga, throwing her hammer twice. Both hit; 14 and 14 damage; then she runs towards the levitating Captain, but can't make it all the way there. She uses another Arcane Jolt to help transfer some of the life energy back to Nethza, healing her for 7. The dog is commanded to run up to the large grick and attack that one and it does manage to hit, but only for 5 damage as the grick's slippery and thick skin deflects much of the bite.

The bone naga still has its sights set on Maireagh. It tries to hypnotise her and hold her in place (technically Hold Person); she *just* saves against its effects.

Riglan's up. It's overdue time for animals, so he Conjures Animals (L3) for 2x CR1 and two brown bears appear. He moves the totem closer to the Drow. His bears act immediately; the first attacks the bone naga, hitting with claws for 10; the second attacks the grick, both attacks hitting for a total of 21 damage (10+11). The grick retaliates but amazingly, the tentacles *just* miss so the beak is out too; it swipes with the tail, which does hit, for 11 damage.

Temo is within sight range of the drow captain so aims and fires. Crit! A total of a big 58 damage. The drow captain's spell fails and he softly falls back to the ground.

Nethza is angry. She adds hexblade's curse to the current hex on the Drow captain and attacks, hitting twice - second is a crit as well. Wow. So many crits this battle? It's crazy. The first hits for 24, high by itself, the crit disappointing, but still, 25. The captain still stands despite all this damage; but now the spectre acts, hitting and dealing 12 damage. The captain falls! The hex blade's curse in return gives 14 health back to her (she's back to 44).

Riglan shouts, "Nice work, but, uuuh, some big creatures over here!"

Maireagh risks an attack of opportunity and backs away from the bone naga, wanting to throw the hammer as it's more effective. The naga tries to bite but misses. Maireagh throws twice and hits twice, albeit only just on the second time. She deals 13 and 14 of damage, low rolls but enough to bring down the bone naga. She tells the dog to attack the grick again; it flanks against the bear and gets advantage, but it can't get in a hit.

Riglan throws flame, hitting for 12 damage. He calls at the bears to attack. The first bear runs in and attacks - it crits but a terrible roll gives only 9 damage, and crit fails the second. The other bear has flanking advantage, it crits but still a poor roll with only 12 damage; the second attack misses despite advantage. The grick retaliates and hits for 22 damage, bites for 13 damage and this kills the bill. The tail hits the other for 11.

Temo aims and fires; he hits for 27, average to bad rolls, but this is enough to take down the grick.

We're in really bad shape and retreat to the crypt to try and rest. Temo presses a greater healing potion into Nethza's hand and says, "no arguments, drink this!"; she heals for 4d4+4 -> 18. Later, after a short rest, some healing spells, another potion or two and some hit die, we're in better shape, but certainly far from fresh.

We question the spectre - why did the Drow want to know what was in the temple? It resists answering for a while, but Nethza, no love lost between her and these Drow, uses persuasive but harsh words and gets a compelled reply. **They are seeking Vizeran DeVir** - since his house fell to their house (Baenre), they've been tasked with killing the last of the DeVir bloodline. Otherwise, if he survives, it could topple a political status-quo which has the House of Baenre currently elevated in status. They thought they'd eliminated everyone from the DeVir house but then learned of the Quori outcast. So all of this was just some petty political squabble? Oh no, not so - in Drow society, house standing is everything. The house hierarchy is a matter of life and death to them. They've been tracking rumours of his existence for a long time and, through asking around various places, discovered that he was involved in seeking out some of the ancient Quori - from a few thousand years ago - who had separated / turned form Lolth to worship false gods - elemental gods - a pure evil elemental eye. They're lawful evil; the eye is chaotic; the interests are not aligned.

They've been searching for almost a century. Old writings, rumours, spies above ground all led them here; the eye is on the move again, they know (but appear to not care); they broke into the Tower Of Magere and found some of his old writings. They figured out it's close to "where those ridiculous Besilmir Dwarves built their kingdom". They learned that he'd created the four elemental weapons and was using them to advance his plan. Then they heard from a captured Quori Drow that DeVir was dead, or so he swore; the house was dead, no surviving heirs; they learned of the crypt near the Elemental Eye temple, having lived out the last of this days near there. They had to get conclusive evidence. If his body was dead and in the catacomb, that would have been the end of it. Their house's victory would've been secure.

"You don't realise this but the fact that his body isn't in there, should worry everyone - including the surface dwellers."

The drow knew that the Besilmir Dwarves had dug down and found the temple. They meddled in powers here and things didn't go well - we know a little of this from the princess' journals. Notes left behind by Vizeran show that he found much evidence of the wreckage caused to Besilmir; that the Besilmir dwarves had done *something* here to cause it and Vizeran had, in turn, studied it. He had to restore what they'd inadvertently destroyed before he could contact the Elemental Eye. Vizeran was annoyed; he had written that the dwarves had unleashed an earthquake that caused serious damage to the conduit of power to the other plane, undoing centuries of work (from our perspective, that's probably a good thing). He wrote that anyone other than "thick-headed Dwarves" would've done it deliberately, but they must've done it by accident for "who would be foolish enough to sacrifice a kingdom just to collapse a temple?".

We may never know. If they understood the powers beneath, they might even have sacrificed themselves to protect the world above.

### (3540 XP)

We aren't in terrible shape and while it's more risky with some spells blown, we elect to press on. It sounds like we're close to the temple, though we don't know what we could do there.

Nethza asks the Drow if there are any particular dangers it knows of within the temple? It hasn't been in there, it says. The "surface dwellers" (cultists) have been fighting each other often at the "Hall Of Battle", east of the temple, apparently some game where "whoever manages to defeat the others holds the entrance to the temple and their prophet will occupy it". The Drow understands that they are trying to contact the Eye, offering sacrifices on the ziggurat and suchlike. **Apparently they don't quite understand how their magic weaponry is meant to work**. The Drow says that they rarely stray this "close to the surface" but the surface dwellers have been interfering with elemental energies and opening nodes on the layers below where we stand now, opening routes to the elemental planes; this required investigation. They still seem to be wasting time as far as the Drow are concerned and that's fine; the Drow kingdoms will be ready when they figure it out and bring things through. The spectre knows that they'll bring whatever it is to the surface; the Underdark kingdoms will not fall.

Riglan sends the bat Southwards, in the direction indicated for the temple. Another 10-15 ft of darkness; the strange burning water extends along this way and into the next cavern which is really huge. There are some steps down and then a further downwards slope, maybe 20ft. The bat flies around to try and get a sense of scale. 100ft ceiling, a ziggurat going up about 30ft or so with an altar at the top. There are various beings around, but the bat isn't close enough to sense any details.

The bat pops back. Given the scale, what do we even do? We can fight the people and maybe there's one of the elemental prophets there, but would that make any difference? The weapons are the power, so how does the temple fit into it? The Drow is unconcerned with such things and does not know, so we ask what the nature of the original damage was that got repaired. Apparently the journal said DeVir made multiple visits and used great magic to restore it as the whole level in which we currently stand had been collapsed, the kingdom above having crumbled down and collapsed into it by the earthquake. So all of this was buried - not so much damaged, as inaccessible.

We figure there's not much we can do right now against the temple itself, then, but we just have to tackle the people trying to use it. Even an earthquake sounds like it might not be enough to cause the scale of damage described.

All we can do is fight on, really, but ideally we'd have some idea of who we're fighting and perhaps even some kind of plan. The bat gave a decent indication of layout, but that's about all we'll have. It would be easy to overthink things. We perhaps just need to head through the dark patch and keep against the wall, hoping we have a brief moment to see what's up before being spotted.

We have a short rest; Maireagh tinkers and unattunes from her fire protection ring, swapping it for something she thinks might be closer to whatever the air cult bring to bear.

Riglan thanks the bat. It's time to swap. He calls an owl, which has good range darkvision and sends it through, asking it to fly low and straight through the dark then land immediately after and observe.

It only rolls and 11 and 1 on adv. perception, so only total 12. The room is lit through various fires. There's movement on the ziggurat, including people moving around. Larger and smaller creatures on the top, hard to make out though. It's maybe only 40ft from the edge of the dark tunnel to the edge of the ziggurat, but maybe 90ft straight across up to its top from where the owl rests. It thinks it sees two large things, that maybe even have wings; roughly 3-4 smaller creatures moving around.

We probably need some way to move faster than normal, maybe even fly. Suppose we were trying to get to the top of the ziggurat during a fight; it'd need a full speed run to just about make it there within maybe 12 or seconds (at normal 30ft). Riglan thinks it would be useful to call flying creatures to try and help us get there more quickly.

Riglan casts L3 conjure animals and uses his Valhalla charm to get 8 giant bats. It's a calculated risk to have a lot of distracting air support and he lets them know that it's probably a suicide mission, but they're Valhalla bats and fully gung-ho. He tells the bats to attack anything, preferably flying things! There's our party, a spectre and 8 giant bats and Riglan drops in the bear totem amongst us all to boost our changes even further. Now he sends the 8 bats ahead two by two through the dark corridor. Nethza activates her flying cloak. Temo says he'll run in to find a place to skulk, but at this Maireagh realises she can help out and makes him invisible - Temo is delighted, because now he can go ahead and spy on things with his own eyes which is much more fun that Riglan's dodgy narration of "owlvision".

In Temo goes. He emerges after the dark tunnel and shuffles to the right hand side, hugging the wall, to get a better view of the ziggurat. Perception total 19. There are lights leading up the ziggurat steps on various sizes. A huge altar of black granite sits atop a stone ziggurat. Fresh rivulets of blood trickle down the steps. On all sides of the cavern, flames dance on the strange pools of oily water, scattered here and there. Main pools seem to be focused on the west. Strange gusts of wind moan and howl through fissures high in the cavern walls. It's clear that this cavern was particularly badly damaged with lots of rubble pushed to the sides, some of it heaped into pools of the oily water, flames licking around soot-stained blocks.

A giant vulture and a wyvern are perched atop the ziggurat. The vulture snaps at a body tied and bound on the altar, struggling. Standing over is a female elf dressed extremely ornate, gossamer shimmering, silvery silk with a high collar and a tiara almost, dripping with gems. Very beautiful with flowing black hair with strings of pearls. She holds a very long spear, standing a distance back, observing what's going on. Two other humanoids are holding down the ropes and look as if they're preparing to conduct this sacrifice. The elven lady looks halfway between a noble and a wizard. The weapon, looking closer, is a silver spear which looks extremely ornate; the head looks like it has been made as jewellery, with some kind of wind-like metalwork shapes and dark gems embedded. There are two other humanoids; one holds the reins of the wyvern and the other seems to be singing (!) to the apparent amusement of the elven noble. Looks almost like a bard; studded leather armour, also elven, but holding a small harp and playing.

Temo goes back and relays the information. We agree that there's most likely the air elemental prophet Aerisi Kalenoth and this strange bard singer is probably a powerful magic user too. We can't really deduce anything about the other three. The wyvern and vulture are likely to be hardy and difficult, but obviously the magic users are a primary concern, especially the prophet.

Air does give us some pause for concern regarding the use of flying creatures as a main means of distraction, since they're easily thrown about in bad wind, but ultimately the reasons for bringing those forth remain and the decision, already made though it is, seems reasonable. At least the bear totem might help with that.

Everyone's ready; the bats are lined up. Riglan tells them to go through first taking Dodge and causing distractions. Temo is still invisible... We decide to go in order of initiative and just rule that people emerge through the dark zone at the start of their turn, for simplicity.

* Giant bats 22 dex 3 (which is a very nice roll - nat 19+3 - fits the story idea of them flying out first!)
* Spectre 22 dex 2 (nat 20 + 2)
* Temo 21 (nat 16 + 5)
* Riglan 19 (nat 14 + 5)
* Maireagh 11
* Nethza 9

Netzha's cloak is activated, so she's flying. The bats fly in and spread around, two or three of them going further than just dodging. The spectre advances with Temo dashing in close behind; he is invisible so uses the advantage to fire at the mage. It's a good hit for poor sneak damage, with a total of only 22. Perception: total 15. She turns around; extremely pale skin, pointed ears but even sharper than usual features, black hair tied back with an almost crown-like piece of jewellery; huge, glittering wings too.

Characters on top of the ziggurat see all the bats fly in. One of the sacrifice's rope holders lets go and starts leaping down the ziggurat's 5ft block edges, rather than wasting time on the stairs; he gets close to Temo. Close up, he looks monk-like, very light on his feet, but clearly a magic user. Thunderwave is cast, hitting Temo and a bat; both save against the worst of it, taking 5 damage, halved to 2.

Riglan runs in and is thinking of Ice Storm, but sees the sacrifice right in the middle. He lines up the bard and elf person and shoots a lightning charge instead, but it's a low damage roll at 24. The bard is hit because the elf pushes him in the way! (She saved, he didn't). Not only does the elf appear to save from the spell, but the part of the bolt that strikes does less damage than expected; resistance? He brings in his totem to cover some of the bats and party, then moves out of the way of the door, shouting to the bats "attack the bad guys!".

We hear commands shouted in a language we don't speak. The wyvern takes off and flies off to attack a nearby giant bat attacking with claws - crit! - 4d8+4 -> 22 - all of its natural hit points - then swings its stinger around; hits again, 2d6+4 -> 11; con save failed; the bat is killed outright. The wyvern flies further towards us to engage another one of the giant bats that had flown further out.

The elf Aerisi shouts out - "Ridiculous! What is this interruption? What fools, what brigands and thugs; to attack, instead of parley! Do you have no social upbringing whatsoever? Lay down your weapons instantly and call off these beasts, and I shall spare your life. There is far more to be gained in serving a common cause than to pit yourselves against the hurricane that will devour all. You'll throw your lives away. Pitiful. Lay down your weapons, this very instant! I command you!" and her wings extend. Riglan, perception 24; he is surprised to see that the shining light and the wings are all an illusion. She's an elf, but the stranger pointy features - an appearance of an ancient flying elf - is also an affectation. She's not even pale blue, just light beige; Riglan recognises a moon elf.

Riglan shouts in response, "Well if you're willing to cease all elemental cult activities and leave this cavern, the caverns below, and never return, then we'll consider it!" She responds - "Ha! Oh. You're one of *those*. Ah, now, I remember - someone sent out a concerned message that some meddling adventurers had wandered down here. Ha! You may have bested that simple-minded oaf Shatterkeel, but Aerisi is far beyond *your* meddling."

A bolt of lightning shoots out - chain lightning - hitting Riglan and 3 bats within 30ft. Riglan and the bat to his left fail to dodge, but the other two manage it. 10d8 damage! FML. 46 lightning damage, half for the bats that saved. The bat taking full damage is taken out immediately. Riglan uses his mind sharpener cloak to hold his spell.

Aerisi commands her minions - "Take them down! Insolent children!"

Now the strange bard acts. He sets his eyes on Temo. He picks up his harp and plays a discordant melody (casts Dissonant Whispers). Temo rolls a nat 2-1 for his save, taking 10 damage and is forced to retreat in reaction. The bard turns around and says, "My queen, no harm shall befall you - Windharrow shall be your shield" - giving bardic inspiration basically.

Maireagh runs in, sees us already looking quite badly injured & does what dwarves do - just full tilt runs at the ziggurat, reaching the bottom stairs. The faster dog gets a little further up them. She's then suddenly hit (for 14 damage) by a crit hit but we can't see what hit her; then another hit, for 10.

The guy that spoke commanded the wyvern earlier, moves in front of the dog and tries to cast a lightning bolt through both the dog and Maireagh. The dog dodges but Maireagh has to react with a flash of genius as she sees the dog move first, in order to avoid the worst of it. The dog takes 14 damage but Maireagh only 7 as she picked the right kind of damage for her upgraded ring. Nethza flies in and is obviously alarmed at what she sees; we're not doing well - she's just in time to see the lightning bolt fired at Maireagh and the dog. She transfers her still-up hex at the caster that saw doing it and throws two eldritch blasts, both hitting; 13 and 13 damage.

The giant vulture takes to the sky, flying around behind the dog that's engaged with the mage (pack tactics -> advantage); talons surprisingly miss, but the beak crits - 4d4+2 -> 11 damage.

The second of the two that had been holding the sacrifice's ropes runs down to attack Maireagh; the dog gets an opp attack as he runs past and just manages to hit, for 9 damage. The Hurricane casts Thunderwave at Maireagh and Nethza. Both make their saves and Nethza holds her spell; half of 2d8 -> 10 halved to 5 each.

Aerisi shouts, "Stop this nonsense at once! You clearly see that you're outnumbered and overpowered! Lay down your weapons and I promise you that with your potential, you will do well among my ranks."

The bats act. Bat 1 rescues the sacrifice. The injured bat 2 flies in behind the vulture, which is distracted with the dog and tries to bite; adv. 17,8 + 4 -> 21; 1d6+2 damage -> 7. Bat 3 does a similar trick with the second thunderwave guy in front of Maireagh, landing to flank and *just* matches AC for a bite; rolls a 6 for 10 damage. It lifts up to try and avoid being in the way and draw fire; but this causes two opportunity attacks, because it didn't notice the Skyweaver (stronger mage) up at the top. The mage the bat attacked misses, but the Skyweaver gets hit for 5. Bat 4 attacks the bard from above, but misses. Bat 5 gone, bat 6 also goes for bard from above (but not flanking, because up high) but also misses. The last bat, 8 - because I fucked everything up - doesn't realise it's next to a wyvern not a bat, and gets hit by an opportunity attack for 6+15 (at least it makes a save). Badly injured. It lands near the elf and at least has a try for an attack. It manages to hit for 9 damage.

The spectre flies up to the wyvern, just at the edge of its movement range and tries to attack but misses.

Temo recovers from Dissonant Whispers. He aims and fires at the bard, who is engaged with two giant bats. Hits for 25. Seems to have caused a fair bit of damage. The hurricane (first of the two Thunderwave guys) runs up to Temo and casts Gust Of Wind (at the start of Temo's next turn we'll find out if that's been effective).

Riglan moves his totem further into the mess and wildshapes into a giant eagle, moving to the right to try and keep everyone spread out. The wyvern moves away from the spectre towards the bat that's attacking the elf. The spectre tries an opp attack and fortunately hits, dealing 13 damage but with no other ill effects; the wyvern is a little injured but still goes on to hit the bat with claws for 12. It also hits with the stinger for 11 and takes down the bat. It then flies around to have a go at another one.

Aerisi moves back, beside the wyvern; she casts Storm Sphere - it hits Maireagh, Nethza, one of the bats and even one of her underlings. Despite totem advantage, bat 3 fails a strength save; it takes 9 damage. Nethza also fails despite advantage but holds her hex. Maireagh fails too - 6 D20 rolls, all falling at or below 10 total including modifiers - tho the D20 rolled for Nethza was high. Aerisi now calls lightning from the sphere, aiming it at bat 3 and hitting for 16 damage. This kills that bat.

The bard Windharrow steps back without leaving the threatened area and casts Thunderwave at the two bats. Bat 4 fails its save, bat 7 succeeds. Bat 4 is pushed into the storm sphere, taking 5 damage; bat 7 takes only 2 damage. Windharrow now moves next to the elf, allow 7 to take an opp attack - the bat hits, surprisingly, with max damage too - 10 points. Windharrow is looking super rough.

Mareaigh knows there's something near her and shouts out that effect - the blindsight bats can now see some strange apparition in melee range, but only they can see it; but they'll be disadvantaged for attack within the sphere. Maireagh tries her luck with Swordburst. The invisible creature avoids it and takes no damage; the hurricane monk guy takes 4 damage. She moves out of the storm sphere, but unwittingly triggers an opp attack from the hidden creature; but it misses despite its invisibility advantage. She commands the dog to attack the Skyweaver mage in front of it. It hits, dealing 8 damage.

Nethza sees Maireagh's confusion; taking the opportunity to try, she swings out wildly with booming blade, hoping to hit something; despite the disadvantage she manages to connect (rolled 19, 15 before modifiers). The initial damage is 15, plus 9 as the creature is moving away out of her area. It's moved behind Maireagh and hits her twice for a high 11 and 15 damage.

The Skyweaver mage now acts, casting yet another lightning bolt, at the dog and Maireagh - it's unaware that Maireagh's invisible aggressor is in the line of fire too. Similar to last time - the dog avoids it and this gives Maireagh a flash of genius to avoid the worst. The dog takes 13 damage, Maireagh (thanks to her newfound lightning resistance) takes 6.

Nethza now gets a chance to fully act. She flies up above the storm sphere using her cloak and says, "Very well, Aerisi - your pride will be your downfall!" and uses her Psychic Lance at Aerisi. Surprisingly, she fails the DC17 intelligence saving throw. Seeing this, the bard Windharrow tries to counterspell but fails (his max L4, her max L5, but he rolls a d20 -> 4; he's too injured and weak to counter it). Aerisi is thrown back and stunned, with (due to L5) 8d6 -> 32 damage; then falls back, off the top of the pyramid. Nethsa realises that **this has killed Aerisi** because the storm sphere collapses! Nethza calls out, "Focus on that bard, in case he tries to bring her back!"

The vulture turns and attacks the bat which attacked it (bat 2). Surprisingly, both of its attacks miss. The hurricane mage near Maireagh runs past her towards bat 7, Maireagh having already used her reaction on a prior save, and casts Thunderwave upwards, trying to push it away. The bat is caught by surprise and flung back 10ft and up another 5ft. It's 10ft up above the top of the ziggurat now; it takes 2d8 -> 13 damage. The mage keeps running towards Aerisi; the dog gets an opp attack when that happens and does hit, dealing 7 damage.

Seeing this, bat 1 flies in and tries to attack the monk. It misses badly (nat 2). Bat 2 is engaged with the vulture still; misses (nat 5). Bat 4 flies around and also tries the monk; misses (nat 6). Bat 6 is above the bard so takes a swipe; just hits, for max 8 damage. Windharrow falls! The bat stays flying at about 5ft up.

The spectre is *just* able to fly back again and reach the monk harassing Temo. It tries to attack, but misses. Temo now has to fight against the gust of wind - the totem helps him - rolls 11,17-1 - he digs his heels in, faces into the wind and doesn't shift. He disengages and runs to get a view of the big wyvern that we've not really hit much so far. It's in melee range of a bat, so is distracted. He rolls total 14 and this does actually hit, for a whopping 35 damage (1d6+6+5d6, 6,5,5,5,4,4!). The Hurricane monk he just ran from is still holding his gust spell and runs around to try and throw Temo off again; the spectre gets an opp attack and does hit, doing 9 damage. The monk tries to strike Temo twice. Both hit, for 7 and 5 damage. For his bonus action he brings the wind back around against Temo.

Riglan:

* EAGLE: AC 13 HP 25 Speed 10 ft., fly 80 ft
* Beak: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.
* Talons: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

...flies to attack the giant vulture as Maireagh is kinda surrounded. He manages to hit with the beak and just with the claws, dealing 6 and then a maximum 15 damage. The vulture falls!

The wyvern is on the ground (top of ziggurat), attacking the 5ft-in-air bat 7. The bite crits. 18 damage to bat 7, which is almost down. The stinger attacks and hits, sadly taking out bat 7. at least the bats are taking damage that the party would've otherwise taken. It flies up to engage with bat 1.

Maireagh is still in the same mess. She tries to peel away, potentially risking opportunity attacks - certainly, the "invisible stakler" has one and hits for 2d6+3 -> 10. The Skyweaver mage tries to hit her too, but misses. Maireagh throws her hammer at the just-in-range wyvern and just hits once, then again, for 14 and 16 damage. She uses an arcane jolt as she's feeling pretty beaten up and heals herself for 2d6 -> 11. She now asks the dog to attack the Skyweaver; and it hits, yay, for 9 damage. This takes down the mage! Good doggie. It runs up and engages the remaining Hurricane monk.

The invisible stalker chases after Maireagh and attacks twice. It would hit but Maireagh expects that the attack will be coming and as it starts to connect, brings up a magic shield, which deflects both.

Nethza transfers her hex to the monk that's near Aerisi and hits once with an Eldritch Blast, for 13 damage; that's enough and the monk falls.

With the monk down, Bat 1 attacks the wyvern. Nat 1. Bat 2 flanks the wyvern and tries its luck. It rolls a 16,20 with advantage! Yay. 2d6+2 -> 5,2+2 -> 9 damage. Bat 4 comes in and has a go as well, but without flanking; rolls a 5, misses.

The spectre once again flanks the monk on Temo, but once again misses despite advantage. Temo does in turn manage to avoid being throw back. He disengages, runs towards the ziggurat and fires his bow back. He *just* hits the monk, rolling only a 4+10 -> 14, enough. Total damage is 26. To Temo's surprise the monk dodges at the last minute, only taking 12 damage; however it does lose concentration on its wind spell. In return it starts to run after Temo; the spectre deals 6 damage on an opportunity attack; the monk attacks, but Temo's ready for it and avoids both unarmed blows.

Not far below, Riglan flies down and attacks the monk in a flanking position. Shit rolls; misses with the beak, does hit with the talons but rolls minimum possible damage, only doing 5; the monk does not fall.

The now-airborne wyvern hits bat 1 with claws for 17, then tries its stinger doing 14 damage; it saves against the worst of the poison damage, taking 12. It has 1hp left!

**Suddenly the wind in the cavern ceases. The lights dim slightly. There's a strange noise of clanging - Aerisi had a grip on Windvane, her staff; but she's let go of her staff and it's fallen to the floor. She's gone.** (Failed 1st death save, nat 1 on 2nd death save, we'd dropped people who might've healed her early enough).

Maireagh attacks the wyvern again. She hits for 18 damage, heals herself again for 12 (2d6 -> 12! Great roll) and hits again (despite disadvantage from the unseen assailant), which deals 17 damage and the wyvern dies too. It falls out of the sky and slumps over the stepped walls of the ziggurat. She knows her unseen attacker is close by, so she gets the dog to run up and try; but the dog misses (disadvantage - rolls a 4 and 20, argh! 4+9 -> 13 is not enough). The invisible stalker is now once again attacking, hitting twice for 10 and 9 damage.

Nethza throws eldritch blasts at the monk that Temo and Riglan tried to drop; she hits twice and takes it down.

The bats suddenly notice the one remaining creature attacking - without the storm sphere, their blindsight shows them the invisible attacker clearly. Bat 1 attacks with flanking advantage. It hits for 7. Bat 2 comes around and flanks on the other axis; it manage to hit for another 7. Bat 4 is left; it attacks from above without advantage and does manage to hit, but for minimum damage - only 3. The spectre can *just* reach, but can't see anything and misses. Temo aims to avoid his friends, firing into the middle of the mess; he does manage to hit, for 23 damage.

Eagle-Riglan flies over, turns back into himself and tries L4 Wither & Bloom into the space, mentally choosing the unseen aggressor as target. The effect hits fully (failed DC19 con save) but the damage roll is very bad - 4d6 -> only 10, for a L4 spell! - but Maireagh is able to heal a little, for 7.

Maireagh swings into the gap and with flanking cancelling her disadvantage hits twice, for 11 and 12. She uses Arcane Jolt once again, her last one, this time to deal damage to this unseen creature - actually a wholly invisible air elemental - dealing a further 2d6 -> 6 damage; then she gets the dog to do the same thing, which does a further 11 damage. The wind noise from nearby disperses - it's down.

**The battle is over.** We all agree: Chain lightning is not fun. Lightning bolts in general aren't either.

### (2500 XP)

Riglan looks around. What a mess. He walks over and looks down, with no small amount of sadness, at the body of Aerisi. Her illusion has faded and he sees her as she really is. This one all just feels like a waste. It's strange, because these people were responsible for the death of the delegation, which Riglan took very hard and felt personally. But clearly, revenge doesn't work for him.

He looks up and sees the rescued sacrifice over in a corner. He runs over. Medicine check only 3+5. Perception 6+9. Sigh. It's been an up-and-down kind of day. It's a human female who looks like she was once quite regal but is now very badly injured, gaunt and dehydrated. With a shock, Riglan suddenly recognises - from what feels like a very distant memory - **Deseyna Norvale, a Waterdavian noble who was travelling with the delegation**. Riglan yelps and calls everyone else over, casting L2 Healing Word for 12 healing.

She opens her eyes slowly, coughing. "Who... Wait! I know you? I know you!" and she raises her hand and Riglan can see cut and bleeding marks on her wrists. She touches his face. "You're real. Wait! Have I been saved?!" and she passes out.

Riglan stays to look after her. Temo investigates with Maireagh's help. Investigation: 19+11, 30! He starts with Aerisi, now clearly a moon elf, but still beautiful and regal. Hard to tell her age but well into the hundreds. Now, the weapon; called Windvane, not that we know that until Maireagh casts Identify and learns its name.

"It is called Windvane. It is *very* evil and powerful. *Nobody* wield this weapon, no matter what! It is too powerful. It has a piece of Yan-C-Bin in it, the prince of Elemental Air" - I suppose we aren't too surprised, given that Drown had a piece of Olhydra in it and what we heard from the drow earlier today. Evil it might be, but beautiful it is also; silver, glittering, dark gems embedded and what seems to be a swirl of air caught in it.

**Maireagh and Temo discuss how tied the staff is to the elemental node. Temo, arcana 19+3. The piece of the prince in this plane is linked somehow to the node. If we're at a node, he might be able to investigate further - but it would need to be the air node.**

We will wrap it, bag it and take it. Maireagh at first reaches for Unrayle's big tapestry from the bag, but Temo objects loudly! Instead we use bundles of many robes we've collected over time to make sure it can't puncture the bag or be touched by skin. Maireagh notes how light it is as we wrap it up.

We also find:

* Aerisi's crown, rings, bracelets and necklaces combined are worth 180pp we think.
* Windharrow has a harp, which is of course magical; it is a cittern not a lute. Temo tries to play a tune to see if it's any good, playing well (performance 12+8), but he takes 2d4 -> 7 psychic damage (!) and it sounds really awful to everyone else. Even Temo has a headache... He gives it to Maireagh to put in her bag, declaring, "Never again!".

Mairegh decides to try and harvest the wyvern. Riglan notices, and with Deseyna stable he comes over to help. Nature 10+7. Maireagh and Temo are instructed on how to extract the wyvern poison - we saw first-hand how much damage that does. Mareaigh is confident (dex check total 15) and we manage to extract a vial of the stuff. Very lethal! If we don't use it ourselves, **Aneeria at Wallheim's would probably be delighted**.

**So we're at the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye itself**. We don't know what it's for. The ziggurat contains various channels and divots and holes, all stained in blood, leading down to holes in the stone, perhaps to feed something below.

Riglan shrugs and tries Detect Magic. The whole area is strangely _devoid_ of magic with everyone here dispatched and things packed away. The temple itself is not magical. Riglan insight 11+6; Riglan realises that this whole thing is designed to look gruesome and be ceremonial. It's there for someone to put on a show, elevated but visible to everyone around, the flaming oil and so-on. It's theatre.

The structures aren't magic and there's (probably) nothing hiding - the magic comes from people conducting rituals here - well, as the drow said - most of it comes from the weapons.

We decide to retrace our steps all the way back to the sarcophagus room, even though it's no longer magical - it's safe, relatively speaking. Riglan uses his last charges on his staff to cast Pass Without A Trace again and we all manage to get back without incident. Maireagh, to our surprise, casts a spell (L3) that makes food and water, in large amounts. It's more than we need, and not amazing but better than rations, Maireagh adds some flavouring and we have apples too. Riglan tries to wake up Deseyna and we get some food and drink into her, being careful not to have too much at once.

Between mouthfuls, she relays how **herself, Teresiel and Rhundorth were taken** she recounts how they were attacked by monks wearing stone masks, then taken onto boats run by pirates and she calls some strange trade where many of their belongings were taken; the pirates had a strange castle/keep with its own harbour or port; from there, they were marched along the hills above the river, roughly Northwards. While cresting a hill, they were attacked in turn by giant vultures and - "I *swear* I saw lord Mowbray's son riding one of them - from Waterdeep! - he's a well respected landholding noble who travels in good circles" - well, that's one of the Feathergails that we dispatched. "They looked like they were game hunting, hunting for sport..." - she talks about being brought to the tower above a canyon, where the witnessed others being thrown over the edge. In the middle of one night they were hurriedly tied and carried on the backs of the flying beasts up to a strange hole in the mountainside, marched down a huge number of stairs, eventually reaching a Dwarven city... She apologises for a hazy memory, but it seems very good to us! Then Aerisi was taunting them and the bard was apparently very sycophantic but she suspects the bard wasn't loyal; they were refused food or water.

She doesn't know what happened to Teresiel. Some kind of fire-wielding warriors raided them and Teresiel got taken. She lost sight of Rhundorth for a while. Later, there was a big raid from earth cultists and maybe he was taken too; nobody saw him after.

Riglan knows that we saw a pile of belongings down in the chasm and Riglan had seen bodies too, looking like the right number, but only through a bat's sonar. He feels a burning sting of guilt actually, for having given up them; he'd thought they were dead, yet they were actually so close by. Nethza's words about how they'd all follow him in there are still ringing in his ears though, to a degree; they would surely have perished given the might of the cult that we've just experienced.

Riglan briefly explains how everything she's described, incredible though it might seem, is indeed true. The earth cult is largely defeated as she saw it but still has strength underground. The water cult and pirates are fully vanquished and there interference locally has been resolved. We did in fact give chase and encountered the earth monks first; took a while to realise that the trail actually led to the air, due to the attack / "snatching" from the earth cult; Riglan gently tells her that Mowbray's son was sadly deeply corrupted by the elemental evils at work and was killed in battle, which is probably the battle that precipitated their sudden movement from the tower to the underground. Riglan isn't sure if that helped them or made it worse, but suspects they'd have been thrown off the tower otherwise. We've been pursuing the cults ever since, and the delegation was really how it all started in earnest. But for that chance encounter in Beliard, we might never have got embroiled and never have staged the rescue - late though it may be.

We finally realise that after all this time, **the air cult's pile of bodies was a deception to try and get us to leave them alone**.

We take a long rest, while pondering how we can get Deseyna to safety.



## DAY 105

We decide to get Deseyna out as quickly as we can; up the staircase right through to the monastery, then use the boat to get to Riverguard Keep ASAP.

Riglan calls a bat to watch ahead (-> perception rolls with advantage) and after some food (continuing from Maireagh's feast of the prior night) we head off. Riglan: Perception 5,20+9 -> 29. Riglan is able to scout ahead with the bat's aid. Without PWAT, stealth to get an idea of our general noise:

* Riglan 5!
* Temo 20
* Nethza 17
* Maireagh 11

With a DC set at 10 we're kind of OK, but Riglan's scurrying up and down with the bat trying to scout ahead can a bit noisy, even with the Boots Of Elvenkind.

We manage to get up the stairs to the earth temple, past the old forge and Etin, to the main gates and up the ancient stairs heading towards the mines beneath the monastery. There - Riglan, perception 18+9: We encounter some Duergar who are headed down. Riglan hurriedly pulls people into a kind of alcove, but it's not big (bad survival roll!) and Temo has to use a minor illusion of a cave-in to hide us. Duegar intelligence check against Temo's spell, DC 15; nonetheless, all four pass without noticing us. They have tools and work bags, headed down.

Once they've gone, verified by bat, we head out of the mines and monastery. A powerful ward is placed on the Eastern side, almost a field; we assume Renwick; he clearly is bolstering defences and does not want more refugees or disturbance - he probably had further trouble after we left. **Perhaps the deep-down node-based earth cult is mobilised more? That's a worry if so. Retaliation for Renwick's perceived help of our cause?** Temo - Arcana 18+3. A powerful form of a prismatic wall - several layers of different coloured light, each layer seeming to have a particular magical effect. Someone might have the skill to get past some, but getting past _all_ of the effects is likely to be very hard. Temo believes that getting through requires knowledge of the order of layers, so that counters can be deployed in that order; discerning the order is very difficult because the colours appear jumbled. Temo thinks it must have been a serious incursion to require such measures.

If we come back to chat again, we'd better bring some good books or artefacts with us that he may find interesting.

Onward, down the track to find our boat. It's still there, and while not as well hidden as the first time we did it, it's not been left as long either and the twigs/branches we used aren't as dried out. The going is good and by mid-afternoon we're at Riverguard Keep.

There's a little bit of activity. A small barge ahead of us has, coming from further downstream, pulls into the keep. We reassure Deseyna that it's safe - clearly, she's nervous about being back to somewhere that has such terrible memories. We look for Adbar Trading Coster and find a Guard Captain. It's set up with proper bedding and rooms for travellers now. There's even a small shop and beginnings of a tavern via the old dining room & kitchen.

Deseyna is keen to just get back to Waterdeep, so we ask the Captain of the Guard what his recommendations are for travelling that way as safely as possible. He recommends we talk to someone called Morana who runs the dining hall, since she talks to the traders a lot. The Quatermaster called Hera maybe too - the Captain just received a requisition request from her for a literal boatload of armour and weapons as there's been a run on them. Something's going on for sure.

We start with Morana. We head to the mess hall and we're asked if we want anything. There's some soup and we have a small amount of ale but we don't want to waste too much time. Morana is a hill dwarf, wearing a chain mail shirt. Temo flags her down and briefly explains that Deseyna had been kidnapped by bandits, we were fortunately able to help and we're looking for a safe way to get to Waterdeep. "Am I to understand we have nobility in the house today, m'lady?!" asks Morana - "In a manner of speaking" says Deseyna, "but please don't make a fuss". Morana offers a very good room if Deseyna wants it.

**There have been reports of mercenary groups accompanying traders with trouble afoot in Beliard. Sightings of a cloud giant** rumour has it - (Temo, Persuasion nat 20! + 12 -> 32) - that Hera sold out of all her weapons a day ago as a group of mercenaries were headed up that way at the request of some distressed mastica bean merchant up Beliard way and some young ranchers, because the cloud giant apparently moved towards Beliard, leading a procession of a rag-tag group of people and some with placards on them, hands bound, marched over Stonebridge into Beliard; all very strange. That's why the mercenaries were headed that way.

She also gets even _more_ conspiratorial - "m'lady - I'd just stay off the roads completely - Red Larch, my my! Have we heard some things about what's going on there. A sympathisers stronghold, they say! There are reports of people needing to avoid the town entirely because the town council has voted 'for the safety of the citizens' to acquiesce and ally themselves to some powerful group that apparently are trafficking in people..." - Nethza bristles. "No-one has ended up coming all the way to us but there are reports of them being taken to an old keep on a hill in the middle of the woods North of here" - this sounds like Scarlet Moon Hall to us, so now we possibly have two reasons to tackle them next. Slavery and maybe Teresiel.

We're pointed at some people who might be headed to Waterdeep themselves, from Beliard but heading South, probably with the latest news and maybe people with whom to travel. We thank her and head over to the group. Riglan recognises them for sure! Perception 26. These people ran the Mastican bean stall in Beliard. They were nice. Riglan introduces us and politely enquires what brings them here. They remember us too and we tell them briefly what brings us here. "It didn't quite work out - we're escaping! Running back for the safety of Waterdeep. You think it'll be romantic living out in the country away from the madness of the city, but it doesn't always work out that way... Sometimes the safety of the city is just what you need." Temo asks what happened - something about a giant? Persuasion 24. "Yes, hmm, well we left quickly and in the middle of the night! Yesterday evening this cloud giant turned up with a large group of people, very strange mix... Humans with crab shields, jagged swords, spikes on them, blue and white feather-caped poncey people too, stranger still was the cloud giant; they called him Hakon or Hakion or something? He seems to be leading them - they called him 'The Punisher'. There were 20-something of these people with huge signs on them, placards, 'I have failed. I atone. I am weak and must be punished'. They were being marched through and others were throwing rotten vegetables at them. They started looting. The poor innkeeper! They took over her inn. We couldn't stay there." The wife speaks up - "I long for the safety of the trade quarter. It's smelly and noisy but you can wander the streets at night. It's safe; the city watch is there. None of this nonsense... I don't know what the world has gotten to..."

Temo makes comforting noises and agrees that Waterdeep would be safer for the moment. Deseyna asks about getting passage down South. The ex-Beliard Waterdavians are amenable, so long as Deseyna is happy to travel with the common folk! Deseyna is coming to terms with the amount of time she has been away - almost 2 months - and steps away for a moment. Riglan Perception 22; she's trying to get his attention. Riglan excuses himself and wanders away a distance so that Deseyna can come speak to him while it looks "natural"!

Deseyna has a favour to ask. "I find myself in most unusual circumstances, where I'm afraid I don't have access to my family's resources. Everything I had was stripped from me. But I assure you that we will repay you... Would it be possible to arrange a short loan to impose upon your graciousness and generosity such that I could arrange my passa - " she's interrupted by Riglan who is chuckling and apologises and says "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to seem rude, but when you started talking about your family wealth and things - my mind went to 100 places about what you might ask - and all you then wanted is some money. Down below, we found more than we know what to do with - of _course_ you can have anything you like, with no need to repay".

Deseyna of course insists that she would pay back - it's loan. She'd only borrow as much as she requires to get down safely. With these two people too, get them there. She asks for a loan of 200gp, to repay with interest, secured under the circumstances only by her good word. After some inevitable further to-and-fro, she's sure that's the amount, insists on Hera the Quatermaster documenting it as a loan and so-on. It's all signed and we have that contract.

**Riglan tells Deseyna that she repays her "social" debt of rescue by helping the couple of Beliard. Deseyna says that she does it in part hoping that *we might meet again in Waterdeep*, perhaps with Teresiel, to catch up. Riglan notes that as she's had a bit of time now, some of her confidence and nobility - the flowery language! - is returning.**

Later, Deseyna asks about any other books or journals we might've found. In particular she asks about a short document in a strange language, which we find folded together (3 pages) inside one of the journals - in fact one of the ones we'd found here, at the tower with the water elemental who'd escaped - it wasn't in one of the very secret books from Mirabar. Temo tries his helm but it doesn't help - the language seems to be some kind of code. Deseyna asks if she can have it back - that was her charge, when she was in the delegation. Of course! She thanks us then notices Riglan's pin... "Ah, you've met with our allies? The druids and rangers of the emerald enclave? I wish I had some insignia to show you myself!" - instead, she runs her fingers over a sequence of signs and codes on the document; a line of them changes. She holds the document up and we can see the symbol of the Lord's Alliance watermarked on each page, faintly. "I'm carrying these documents on behalf of the Lord's Alliance and I had to take them back to Waterdeep. There have been conferences amongst the old - well, reasonably recent when you think about it, the last year - alliances; but, well, yes, politics! There was a point of failure, of weakness, within the alliance and I was to take this document from a meeting where some decisions were made, back to Waterdeep, for the great lady Leirol Silverhand herself. That is why, when your work is done, please come to Waterdeep. What you've rescued here... We would love to tell you the impact of what you've done in saving this document from falling into the wrong hands."

At this Temo mentions paper birds, but learns that those can be intercepted. Later, Riglan writes a short message for the Water Baron, explaining that we make good progress but retaliation is always a risk; strong cult forces still at work; Beliard is in trouble, Red Larch may have capitulated; definitely be on alert.

We say our goodbyes and head to the shop (!) for some trade, picking up their only potion of healing - Greater, in fact, for Temo - some incense, some rations and a refresh of Riglan's painting kit. We're also able to sell the plate mail from Helmdorm's chamber, for a decent price of 750gp along with a small but valuable piece of jewellery - Yarsha's "6 obsidian flakes tied onto a platinum bracelet", for 150gp.

As we get back to the boat, Riglan has a moment to reflect. The sun is noticeably lower for the time of day now, summer on the wane. It's a clear sky, warm, refreshingly "normal" weather; after all that time underground - sunlight and the outdoors are underrated! Grass and trees and a river.

We head back upstream. Temo reads on the boat and gets a bit further with the unknown mage's spellbook (3 out of 10 now). It's almost sunset by the time we get to the monastery. Survival 16 for hiding boat; not a great hiding place once again, but solid enough. We make a bee line for the monastery and the route through the mines and down. Riglan calls his bat and once again scouts head for danger as we go.

Riglan perception total 22. Depressingly, patrols are back in the earth temple. We manage to avoid them, get to the warded stairs, make the appropriate hand symbol and get down to the sarcophagus room. It's around 7pm. Maireagh does the food thing again, then tinkers for a while. Nethza and Riglan chat. Temo carries on reading, encouraged by his growing understanding and progresses well (4 of 10). He realises he can cross reference some things with one of the other arcane books we have and starts to understand some other bits of the writings in those other books - they're spells.

Nethza's concerned about the fire cult activity and asks if Riglan's equally concerned. She thought that we might've gone to Red Larch to investigate. Riglan says he considered it, but the news of the disturbances above ground curiously focused his mind on the importance of shutting things down here. Without that, anything you fix up above just breaks again - in fact the patrols in the earth temple are a decent example. "How are we going to get that thing to work, that floating stone?" Riglan says, "Don't know; we might just have to blow spells and fly, but maybe we can figure it out or see if there's anything in the books that might help?" Temo shouts over, apparently reading and listening in at the same time - "if only there was a way we could divine it!"

Riglan sets up the ritual, telling people that if the smoke is a problem, blame Temo... He asks the question, "How do we make the floating disc that provides access to the fire elemental node below or the fire temple above, convey us either of those two locations, at our choosing?"

The smoke from the incense is almost not responding this time. It's strange. There's not much smoke, but (Riglan perception 11+9) it seems to form a thin layer. Riglan realises it's showing a disc. The smoke shimmers and the smoke disc kind of rises; the burning incense brightens into embers and as the disc falls the embers turn into ash and swirl around; as the disc rises, the ash lights back into embers. It oscillates this way for a while. Then Riglan's staff speaks to him - "These are command words; do you understand?" - and Riglan realises that "ash" and "embers" are the words. He's not sure if that's in Common; we'll just have to try.

Later, we pack down ready to sleep. We set watch. The dog helps as usual.

* Maireagh (spends some time un-attuning from her shield and attuning to her ring of fire resistance)
* Nethza 19
* Temo 10
* Riglan - wisdom saving 11+9.

Riglan is asleep. He "feels" as if he keeps waking up, but isn't really; each time he's looking through the eyes of an animal or bird, or listening through leaves of a tree. He feels himself connected to all the people and things he's met. He feels himself running on all fours, proud of the six young pups running alongside him as they corner down an old, somewhat frail stag that's fallen behind a fleeing group of deer by a river. He feels himself leaping from a small wet pond in the middle of a trunk on a tree onto a big leaf, uncertain and slipping off, falling to one below, as other frogs croak to lead him back up to the hollow. He feels himself being stroked by the rough, scaly, padded hands of a large Tortle down on the ground, before being released into the clear and strangely-lit lichen water of Shadowtop...

...He jumps from rooftop to rooftop in a town with a square where there are a number of people wearing more 'official' looking clothing accepting a small delegation of tall, almost cleric or druid like individuals in dark crimson robes, with goggles on their heads and with long flowing kind of tails as if the googles were part of a headdress; swords carried in sheaths; one stands in front of villagers, draws the sword which starts to burn; people cower, others come forward, kneel and offer bowls half-filled with various coloured coins, others bring out plates of food. Someone is dragged against their will and presented / given to the delegation, hands bound; the red-dressed people take hold of the rope, kick a plate of food back that they deemed unworthy and drag the woman away. There's a feeling of the eyes that Riglan "sees" through narrowing as he slinks back onto the roof and gracefully pads his way along, jumping from roof to roof...

...now he's circling above a beautiful stone bridge spanning a river. Campfires on the horizon. Campfires? Yes? Several. He gets closer. A massive giant is sat, being entertained and attended to by 30-odd humanoids who have set up camp fires in the fields of an old ranch. Nearby is a small hamlet of 8 or 9 buildings. Flying by, Riglan sees a tall pole, almost like a maypole; tied to it are dejected people, sat on the ground, all wearing sandwich boards with words painted on them; other people come by and occasionally whip one or two - at which all the sandwich board people willingly stand up and offer their hands to be whipped. The cloud giant watches and is occasionally brought a full cart of food which he devours, soaring towards the south...

...outside of a keep near a river, watching through the senses of an owl, flying toward the tower section; a window sill; the lady Desenya knees at a window, hands clasped in prayer, tears running down her face; but seems perhaps not sad but relieved and happy; the prayer is inaudible, perhaps a prayer of thanks; then taking wing back up into the night sky.

Then Riglan wakes up in himself and looks up to a sleeping Temo, his hand on an open spell book. That's what perception 10 gets you! Riglan perception 1,3+9 -> 12, not great but he stays awake. Distracted by the dream. He is once again unsure if this was a dream or vision of what's real; he's seen dreams that turned out to be at least a close approximation of real before in due course, only this time he saw through the eyes of many different creatures.
