# Riglan: Part 17

## DAY 91

We are in the Temple of the water cult, technically an adopted town that became part of Tyar Besil. Gar Shatterkeel's spectre guarded overnight. In the morning, he has gone.

Riglan blesses Temo; Maireagh uses aid; he tries his scroll. Rolls awfully, only 3; but bless gives D4 -> +3 on top, +5 from Maireagh and +3 from his own Arcana pushes him up to 14, just above the DC. He sends a message to the Yartar Water Baron warning her of the danger and to *not* open the case if the orb is found. After a delay, there is a short reply - the Water Baron says, "**Good Sir, Smoothhands, Thanks. Shall Dispatch Agents Immediately. Will Keep You Informed. This Advance Word May Be The Difference Between Death And Survival**". We certainly hope the latter.

That's our last way to contact the outside world.

We open the double doors and push the bodies of the Shiver and Gar up onto the top of the curve of the bridge. Riglan is given the trident by Maireagh - he uses gloves! - and he stands at the top of the bridge so he can be seen from the marketplace via the alley between the buildings. Temo is going to use his wand of fireworks to make a loud display above us to draw attention - but we see that there's already commotion in the marketplace. Confusion and panic; there looks like there's been a fight, weapons drawn surrounding a few, some cowering; two trolls are roaring.

Temo says he'll sneak up to get better look and we can retreat back to the safety of the doorway. Without asking, Maireagh casts Invisibility on Riglan and says, "You're better at hearing things!" - OK then...

Riglan sneaks up trying to listen to the market commotion. Perception: 9+8. Two factions are facing off. On one side, there's Thuluna with her trolls. Various lizardfolk surround her. She's snarling across the courtyard at a group of humans on the other side. Lying at her feet is the dead body of a one-eyed Shiver. Ah. She did the job for us... A dagger is stabbed in his throat. Euw.

We surmise that the hag is trying to seize control. She must have know Gar was killed, or expected it and moved anyway. She's eliminated the competition and is trying to take control of the cult.

"For too long we've allowed weakness to rule in this cavern. Look around you! This is not your dominion. This is the dominion of the creatures of the deep - those you deem lesser and ugly." - the humans are standing off with weapons drawn - "Gar Shatterkeel is *dead* and Morbeoth is also *dead* - I am the next in line; I should have been the leader from the start. I shall wield Drown and lead us to the victory that we deserve. We shall bring all of the creatures of the deep to the surface with the rising tide and wash the world clean of all its fake beauty and conceit and vanity. I will lead you, but you *must *acknowledge our primacy - that the humans are but the lesser race; that you will serve, not lead."

She raises her arms up and screams some strange arcane language. Out of the lake behind the market emerges a massive head, which swings forward and takes a bite out of the group of people. Dragon Turtle, folks. People start to scatter. Some lay weapons and bow.

She turns and starts to walk our way. We run back to the temple and close the doors and warn everyone - **get ready**!

We just have time to take positions, Temo using some dash bonus work and Riglan only just having time to conjure animals. Crocodiles again! We try form a ring around the entranceway, attempting to keep wider to avoid area attacks, but a 30ft radius would get us all (because the spirit totem could).

Initiative rolled. Temo 15+5, Riglan 1, oh no!, crocs only 7. Running in are no less than 6 lizardfolk, two looking a bit different - one with a larger shield and another looking like a shaman. The hag is behind them and an ogre squeezes in behind her. Riglan can see another ogre and two trolls behind on the bridge.

Temo is hiding behind a pillar. The crocs give the lizardfolk half cover but he sees the shaman and just gets a hit (7+9). Dreadful damage roll (5d6+6, only 15 - 1,1,2,2,3!). The shaman turns into a large crocodile too! This pushes the other lizardfolk forward and the shield bearer backwards, next to the hag, just to make room. Five crocs, confusing...

"What is this nonsense?!" asks the sea hag. "You've dispatched Gar! I'm in charge now! Hand me the trident! Be done with this chicanery!" - Riglan says, "Leave this place now and live..." - she responds with, "No! You do not understand the predicament you're in" - **and she assumes her true form**. This is horrifying. Any human who is within 30ft of the hag and can see her, can avert gaze but gets disadvantage, else roll a DC11 Wis Save at start of turn; if failed, frightened for 1 minute. You can reroll each turn but if you can still see the hag you're disadvantaged.

Maireagh fails and becomes frightened; she runs. No choice. The dog however holds its ground and dodges (Maireagh can't command the dog).

The shield holder attacks croc 1 with two attacks (morningstar & spike shield). Miss, hit for 8. The ogre looks around and decides to throw a rock - the dog is in range, but the dog is dodging; the rock hits though (9+6, matching the AC) for 10 damage. (NB: Some tracking issues with these numbers here, lizardfolk and/or croc numbers may be incorrect) One of the lizardfolk attacks croc 2 twice, hit, hit, 10 total. A distant ogre is too far back. A lizardfolk by the dog attacks, miss, hit, 4 damage.

Croc 1 tries for shaman croc. Rolls 6+4, misses. Croc 2 retaliatory attack, rolls only 8+4, hits tho., only 5 damage (tracking issues, this gets lost; perhaps went to Shaman as croc, we aren't sure?), croc 3 goes for the one that attacked the dog, 15+4, hits, only 7 damage, croc 4 also for shaman croc, 18+4, only 4 damage but (for all hits) grappled.

Nethza casts hex on the shaman croc (hag out of range, but that means no fear effect either) and throws two Eldritch Blasts at it; first is crit. Total damage 18, at which point the croc turns back into the shaman; the second hits for 10, and this kills the shaman.

Another lizardfolk also attacks croc 2; miss, hit for 7. Croc 2's getting rough.

A troll manages to somehow push past the ogre, shaman and shield lizardfolk guy and stands where the shaman was. It has three attacks! Claws croc 1 hit for 12 woah, croc 4 hit 14!, bite miss croc 4. The last lizardfolk to act attacks croc 3, dealing 8 damage in total.

Riglan comes forward to try and throw flame at the troll, but misses wildly. He misty steps back to try and keep clear and hold his animal spell.

Temo focuses on the troll, not looking at the hag, throws a fire bolt at the troll hitting (19+7) for good damage roll, 2d10 -> 17. He hides behind the pillar, only nat 8+11 stealth.

The hag tries to find Maireagh and taunts, but can't see Maireagh behind the pillar. No death glare for her (!). Riglan and Nethza can see a weird toxic kind of mist or something emanating from her eyes. The hag tries to attack croc 4 but can't reach it around the corner of the recessed door.

Maireagh manages to recover from her fear, at the end of her turn. Can't command the dog tho so it still dodges.

The ogre throws another rock at the dog, hitting again for 12. One of the lizardfolk attacks Croc 3 (out of order? Problems with tracking lizardfolk numbers) for 11. A grappled lizardfolk doesn't manage to hit croc 2.

Croc 1 manages to hit the troll (12+4). Max damage! 12 (d10+2). Croc 2 lets go and attacks the troll too; rolls 5,7 misses. Croc 3 has a lizardfolk in its jaws, drops it to also focus on the troll. Croc 4 too. Amazingly, the D20 rolls are 1, 2, 3, and 4, insane, so all miss. This is like the previous battle - so far, near-continuously awful rolls on our side with only the occasional roll above 10, super weird.

Nethza throws two Eldritch Blasts at the troll but both miss.

Two more lizardfolk hit twice, dealing 13 damage to croc 2. The troll gets a hit and miss with claws and a bit hit, 10 damage + 6 damage, both to croc 1; only 1hp left. Riglan tries Wither & Bloom on the 4 LF and troll, but damage is only 5 total; various saves are made; at least croc 1 regains 7+5 hp. Troll 2, LF 3 2, others 5.

Temo tries to hit the troll with fire but rolls nat 2, **WTH** is going on, misses, rolls stealth to hide, nat 4, FFS, total only 15 then.

Maireagh runs forward, finally, to attack LF1, hitting twice for 18, taking it down. She gets the dog to heal itself (for 14) and runs into the space where the LF fell. The ogre promptly throws a rock at her; despite cover, rolls 24 so would hit but Marieagh casts Shield.

LF2 attacks Maireagh twice but misses; likewise LF4. Good use of shield. The grappling croc holds the troll while 2 and 3 get bites in for 5, 10 damage but 4 misses (again, out of 6 die, 11 and 15, then everything else below 6).

Nethza gets one Eldritch Blast in on the troll for 14 and moves close enough to use Maddening Hex on it and the four around - troll, LF3&4, hag, LF scaleshield guy. But now the troll goes; it heals for 10 and once again attacks croc 1 but with disadv due to grapple. Miss, miss, bite also misses! They can roll low D20s too.

LF4 tries for Maireagh but misses due to the shield.

Riglan risks running forward & throwing a flame at the troll. Nat 20! Finally. The damage roll is very low (4d8, 1,2,3,8) but that's enough to take down the troll.

Temo tries to hit LF2, with aim, but only rolls a 2 and 5, missing. FUCK.

The hag moves forward over the dead troll, clawing at Croc 4, hitting for 6. Maireagh hits LF3 once for 14. The dog goes for LF2 but misses.

The scaleshield LF hits croc 1 once for 8. 5hp left. The ogre pushes forward and also attacs croc 1 killing it. LF4 hits croc 3 twice for 7. Another ogre pushes into the room; LF2 tries for the dog, hitting once for 8 damage.

Croc 2 misses badly. Croc 3 tries for the hag, 11+4 - hits! Only 5 damage. Croc 4 also goes for the hag now, hitting but again only 5 damage.

Nethza hexes LF4. She attacks LF2 and takes it down. She moves forward to near the dog, keeping her gaze averted.

LF3 attacks croc 3, miss & crit - Temo Silvery Barbs (adv. Maireagh), turning it into a hit for 2, taking down the croc.

Riglan tries L3 Wither & Bloom, rolling 3d6 -> 13. LF3 goes down. So does 4. Scaleshield fails for 13. Even the hag fails. The ogre fails too! Best spell Riglan's ever cast, possibly?! The healing goes to croc 3 and another very good roll - max hp restoration, d10 -> 10+5.

Temo retreats to a safe distance from the hag and hits her with Magic Missile for 14. She shouts, "Don't be ridiculous!" and tries to swipe at croc 3, grappling her. She misses though. We see her shooting her deathly gaze at Maireagh, but Maireagh seems unaffected. Nethza keeps averting her gaze.

Speaking of Maireagh, she moves forward and attacks the hag (with Silvery Barbs advantage). Hits for 10, hits (just barely) again for 8 - the hag goes down! Maireagh swipes her head clean off, thanks to the grapple. "Die!", says Maireagh. The dog tries for the shield LF, but misses; it retaliates at Maireagh, hitting once for 8 damage.

The ogre starts to push past the shield LF but croc 4 gets an opp attack and hits! 16+4! 7 damage. It can't move where it wanted to so instead now atacks the croc. With disadv it still hits for 8 damage. The other ogre is frustrated, since it's still blocked in the entrance.

Croc 4 drags the ogre to croc 3, but croc 3's with-adv rolls are again awful and it misses. Unfortunately this opens up the doorway a bit.

Nethza moves the hex to the grappled ogre and hits just once with eldritch but only gets 9. Riglan throws fire; only rolls 8 but is enough at 8+9 to hit, for 12 damage. Temo aims and just hits the ogre for 23 damage despite some cover and this takes it down.

A troll pushes past the other ogre (!) and squeezes around the shield LF to threaten Maireagh and the dog. Maireagh attacks the shield LF first; misses first, but then hits for 9. The dog does the same but misses. The scaleshield LF retaliates, hitting Maireagh once for only 4.

The final ogre pushes in and throws a rock at Nethza but misses. Croc 3 attacks the scaleshield LF, nat 1, misses. Croc 4 only rolls a 4. Misses too.

Nethza moves the next to the troll. She hits twice with El Blast, for 15 and 8. Riglan tries to get fire on it and does hit, for 2d8 -> 15 fire damage, good damage roll. Temo also does well, aiming and hitting the troll for a big 29 of damage.

The enraged troll smashes at the dog, but misses twice with claws but does get in a bit for 7 damage. Maireagh is unimpressed. She continues her assault on the shield LF, but misses first, then just hitting for 9 damage and taking it down. She moves alongside the dog to directly confront the troll. The dog tries to get in a hit, but misses (another nat 1).

The last ogre attacks croc 4, hitting for 13, killing it; it moves forward. Croc 3 tries for the ogre but obviously it's a shit roll (4) since something universally fucking weird is going on and misses.

Nethza at least has a go with the maddening hex psychic damage thing, getting both troll and ogre. She hits the troll with E Blast for 17 total. That's enough; the troll goes down. She hits the ogre next for 11.

Riglan runs up right next to Maireagh and creates flame, which he puts directly onto the troll to prevent regeneration. Temo takes aim at the ogre (same cover situation as the other ogre) and fires his bow; hits but only 18 damage on a fairly poor roll.

Maireagh has a go too. She hits twice for 22 total. Finally, after numerous misses, the dog crits; 16 damage takes the ogre down.

That's it. Tough battle.

We take a moment to assess - all four (two shivers, Gar and hag) of the potential leaders here are now gone. We don't believe there are any others; the spectre didn't tell us of any.

Maireagh marches out into the middle of the square with the head. She throws it into the square. "Your leaders are all dead. It is time to home. Leave this place!"

She's not charismatic, but her stubbornness wins out; especially when Nethza comes up, covered in ice. Maireagh continues - "If you don't, we'll do to you what we did to the others. Gar has fallen, Telhuna is gone, we have the trident."

With this, people start to retreat. Temo and Riglan join the group in the market. We see two large warehouses - Temo looks in them. Both are full to the brim with all the food and goods that were pillaged from ships harassed at Yartar.

There are many boats moored here - **but they're moored on the dragon turtle's side of the lake**. We'll have to figure out a way to drag them out or move them around to a safe area.

With everything fleeing, we are free now to check out the hag's quarters. We don't know about the shiver yet. Temo investigates. Maireagh helps. Temo only rolls 8 and 9 (because getting above 10 today is apparently mostly forbidden) , but with +9 that's enough. The hag has a lot of beautiful fabrics but they are damaged. There's a beautiful ornate gilded mirror, but the glass is smashed. A small wooden chest stands open on the table, with two potions and a bag of coins equal to about 10 platinum. Tucked under her bed, wrapped in leather, is a warm, glowing dragon bone sword. Maireagh investigates. After a few minutes - one is a potion of hill giant strength, another a potion of fire resistance. The sword has no name that we recognise; it's written in draconic. It amounts to a +1 longsword made of dragon bone with a dragonwing leather grip. The pommel and hilt have rubies set in them. The sword glows warm & the rubies glow when it's within 120ft of any dragon. We are really not far away from that dragon turtle!

Next we try to find the other Shiver's quarters (**Morbeoth**). Riglan doesn't do well - Survival 2+8! - but Temo does very well, Investigation 17+9. It's by a now-abandoned guard house in the south-eastern corner, near an entrance from another part of the tunnel network seems to be. There's a guard post and rail tracks, though doors. It's similar to the one we saw in the other corner. There's another landing with boats; it looks like goods used to be transported here then carted away on the tracks. It looks like it used to contain maybe giant lizard stables, or similar. Markings indicate that this leads to another section; we talk to some of the people who are still packing up to leave; we find out that this used to connect to the Royal Castle, but this is now the space that the air cult have now taken. The guards were there to stop attack forays by those cultists.

So now we think that this passage connects reasonably closely to that other temple - a few hours, rather than days.

**Morebeoth has a lab**! He was experimenting. Large glass tanks contain what we discern, in some cases, holding a small Water Elemental - a Water Weird (Maireagh - Arcana 25 total!). He's been trapping small fragments of elementals into these tanks. Maireagh figures she can release the elemental energy, but it has to be released into water and dissipates, else it would attack us. We spend some time doing this.

She finds some journals of experimentation and his own personal journal. We discover that he needed Drown, the trident, to draw upon the greater power of the Elemental Node for his experiments. But "that meddling hag and the delusional druid are in my way" - he clearly hates them both and we learn about a long-game play to poison Gar and use the underground network of cultists to rise up against Thuluna (the hag) and her monsters.

His notes are an unpleasant read. There are "drowning tanks" and people there can be brought back as an undead army. This is a real thing in a different part of the cave - near we came in originally, in fact. Riglan is tempted to go and try and kill the ghouls!

We spend an hour reading through letters on his desk. He's running a spy network with the aim of **destabilising a number of settlements - Red Larch and up the Long Road towards Triboar - with the aim of breaking the grip that the air cult has around Yartar**. Taking out or destabilising Yartar would be a blow to the Air Cult, that use it as a base of sorts. Red Larch is his spy network's centre. **We even find descriptions that appear to be** ***us!*** Morbeoth was going to try and distract Gar using us, so that he didn't notice Moreboth's machinations.

We also find a potion of poison resistance, potion of gaseous form and 480gp.

**In reading all this stuff, we deduce that we can undo the drowning pool by dispelling the magic of the power of the runes carved therein**. Shit roll on Arcana though - D20 -> nat 1, but plus bless D4, Maireagh flash of genius +5 ("don't cast it on the *pools*, cast it on the *runes*!"), spell mod +5 -> 15 total for a DC of 15. This releases the spirts trapped in the ghoulish drowned corpses. We know where the ghouls that Riglan encountered back at the keep came from now!

Everyone's leaving except perhaps some of the monsters - we might convince them to leave, or leave them to own this place as a relic. The dragon turtle is probably too dangerous and cunning to leave around, as it might be able to restart the cult or otherwise arrange for new followers to cause trouble.

We don't speak Draconic. Riglan tries divination - is there something in the cavern that will allow him to speak to the dragon turtle, given that we don't speak draconic? The answer is no.

(DM fiat) L4 spell conjure woodland beasts, one CR 2 sea hag, try with that - perhaps the sea hags speak a common language (**side note:** we find out soon that actually, even without FM fiat it turns out they both speak Aquan - see below). With that, we head over back across towards the market square and the water where the dragon turtle is. Riglan also casts Water Breathing as a ritual, just in case. The sea hag tells us we should go down to see the turtle, so we needed Water Breathing anyway it turns out.

It's a deep lake, with a deep cave. It's a large (technically "gargantuan"), if we think young, dragon turtle. We recall that its name is Bronzefume. A giant turtle, big pyramid shell bumps, mostly turtle-like but a very draconic looking head with sweeping back bone structures leading to elongated ears - and fangs. We've no idea what kind of breath/water weapons it might have (we don't know it but an ancient dragon turtle is kinda Full Kaiju; this is scary, but not "eats a whole ship" scary!).

It speaks, we learn, Aquan to the sea hag, who translates.

We do manage to convince the DT that the gods here were false and it was brought under false pretences. It likes old, forgotten realm things; magic items; it wants tribute and a new lair if it is to move. So we agree. **We gift it the tree-destroying battleaxe that we were going to destroy in the Forge**. It likes this as it likes, in essence, old-world magic from when the world was much younger. It also likes lairs with:

* Coral reefs
* Caves
* Underground rivers
* Big lakes

...so we part on those terms and will need to find it somewhere else. It prefers places with more life than this - it was only here because there was life around. As it grows, it exerts its influence on living things in the area that end up subservient to it and it feeds on them. If there's nothing to eat and nobody to serve, it has little interest. This is perhaps why it's so amenable to our approaches - it must've noticed people were leaving. (Creatures and animals are fine; doesn't have to be people). We learn that it's too young to migrate to the ocean.

It's interesting. Riglan senses that this creature is ***neutral***. **So we have a big problem, but this is a surprisingly upbeat outcome. The High Forest might be a good bet - he'll have to check in with the elves / druids though.** After the dragon war, perhaps there are many lakes and other places that are vacated.

After that, back on the surface, Nethza does some intimidation of the last few fleeing cultists to find out what else is here. She asks about the double doors and rails near the silo that we found - another part of the city lies beyond; they have an uneasy truce and have sent goods that way, where the Medusa Prince presides over the Cult of Black Earth. The tunnel goes North and down. The other went West. Ancient writings indicate that we're in the corner of a square here and the closest to the surface of Tyar Besil. That's why this is - or was - such a trading hub.

(Fast forward) - by the end of the day we've got boats together and managed to ferry all the stolen things up to Rivarguard Keep. We find that there are people there who were looking for other food, after we'd sent back the boat of rescuees earlier. They'd come with more boats, so...

**## DAY 92**## 

...by the next morning the ferry train back to Yartar is established and we know that the food is in good hands. This should alleviate the food shortage problem in Yartar (and removed Morbeoth's destabilising influence, of which the food shortage was part - weaken the Water Barron).

**After various XP bumps from fights prior, we get 1450 XP here -> exactly reaches level 8**.

We use our small underground boat to sail across the river and land closest to an access to towards Summit Hall. We walk from there and - Riglan intends attempt to get in contact with High Forest druids regarding Bronzefume and we will ask the Hall if they are able to securely look after some of the very dangerous / high value books that we have found.

We ought to reach Summit Hall around early afternoon, tho we will be quite hungry as we didn't have breakfast or lunch and it was busy day yesterday (to say the least!) and a busy morning sorting out logistics. Riglan's been watching various birds with a funny feeling and suddenly realises - he can do that too! He tells the party that he's going to give flying a go (!) and turns into an eagle, helping the party find the way more easily. After about 3 hours, Riglan can see Summit Hall nestled in the gap between the hills - but also several tents pitched outside near the entrance. Strange. Riglan flies back down and turns into himself rather than rushing off ahead, and tells them what he's seen. It didn't look like there were fires or signs of battle, just people camping.

About an hour later we're approaching on foot, but cross-country from the West rather than the N-S road. We drop down from an elevated position as a result and see number of knights on horseback patrolling. The gates are shut and guards are stationed outside. We count seven tents now, ramshackle; no consistent style or design. Various people milling around - one or two carts but these aren't merchants; similar to the displaced families we've seen travelling here and there.

We approach the guards at the door - we're politely told they're not accepting anymore "pilgrims" right now due to "what's going on in the area". The people outside aren't really refugees he claims, but are in fact pilgrims. We ask entry to speak to Lady Ushien. He says "She hopefully knows us, my name is Riglan and these people are - " and Temo interrupts, "The Fabulous Five!"

Ushien is fetched, greets us warmly and we enter. The Hall is too full to offer lodging but we are offered late lunch and happily accept. We explain about the rising cults, in particular the water cult and how we'd found the Mirabar books - which turn out to be much more dangerous and valuable than expected. Ushien takes us to the 30ft long and 15ft wide treasury room, which isn't really used for much these days as it's not that kind of Hall/Keep anymore. Alternatively, the books could be kept in Samilar's Crypt. This seems like a better plan, as it's deeper in the Hall and protected by superstition, rather than attracting the greedy.

Ushien offers to contact the Mirabarian scholar in Waterdeep. We have to think about that as we're no longer sure of anyone's intentions. Ushien asks if we think the Hall might be at risk holding the books; we certainly can't so no; we do not know who is watching us. They decide to deliberate and we agree to stay for a while while they do so.

**Riglan heads to the orchard, finds a bird, and uses Animal Messenger upcast to L4 to ask it to look for Moonan at Shadowtop** (with some idea of the best way to fly there, via fey paths) and ask "Hello. This is Riglan. Young neutral dragon turtle Bronzefume causing trouble near the Dessarin. Looking for new home. Wonder if High Forest can accommodate?" and the bird flies off.

We find a spot to make camp and consider our next move. Temo and Riglan go to chat to families while Nethza and Maireagh keep setting up camp.

Perception, Riglan to see who is interesting: Nat 1 + 8. They don't want to talk - scared of the big Firbolg! Temo has a go (14+2) and spots a small child who entices to come forth with a minor illusion. Adv. persuasion: 16+10. In fact, three kids who were watching come over to watch the display. It's an illusion of the dragon turtle, shrunk down; they're intrigued. He explains what it is. One child says they saw it in the river at the end of spring. Temo asks if anyone believed him? They said it was just a turtle. The child disagrees - it was as big as a boat. Temo explains that it was likely real and is now living in a cave.

Temo asks why they're here. "We're friends now, because we've all been here for about six days now" - some shorter, random kid discussions happen - "...the knights can protect us. Mum says the road north is very dangerous, with many wild animals and other monsters wandering around and attacking travellers. We don't really know if we can go north - we were heading to Triboar and going to cross the stone bridge but don't know if we can now..." - they're from the South. One says that one of his other friends had gone South to Goldenfields. They're being displaced by hill giants coming down and stealing livestock. They believe that there's nothing left down south... Triboar is protected, but is large. The main roads are OK but the hill roads are dangerous.

Trouble is, they're pinned here. It's too dangerous to go further north. The knights here can at least patrol for them. We ask to see their parents and introduce ourselves briefly and say that we've come from Riverguard Keep where bandits have been removed and stolen supplies liberated, leading to a lot of well guarded river traffic moving North to Yartar. If they want, they can accompany us on the half day to the river, we can get them across by ferry boat and they can sleep at the keep before taking a boat up. It's the safest option outside of staying here, which seems OK but doesn't work for the long term.

We're asked to come with them to speak with Ushien and see if they might be allowed an escort, or food, or carts, or something; so, this is arranged. The Hall can give a day-worth of food for the road and they'll even provide an escort of four knights with some carts to at least get to the river (the boats can take over from there), assuming that we'll be ferrying people. She does say that she could spare a couple of knights if they wished to be escorted to Beliard, tho they'd have to get their own way from there and we don't know the condition of the village.

They decide to go for the boats, so arrangements are made. We offer additional food so that not too much needs to be taken from Summit Hall.

The evening comes around and dinner is laid out. We let the families take that and run off our own resources that night, so we help the knights watch the tents.

Ushien asks us in for a chat. Some fruit bread and honey is left over, which Temo is happy to see. The cleric says he's already finished diving - asking Torm for advice. They believe it will not bring danger, so they are willing to hold the books. Given Riglan's recent experiences, he's inclined to believe that answer. We thank them a great deal and hand over the books, encouraging them to resist temptation to read them.

The kitchen is busy making new bread for tomorrow. We offer to help but the kitchen is OK. Ushien and the cleric want to know more about the Elemental threat though, so we all walk and talk.

We tell them about the Orcs driven by the fire cult to the East and subsequent abandonment of farms. We describe how the general destabilising force is responsible for the unusual animal activity - one way they can protect things is just to keep an inward eye and meditate to maintain their own calm and order, as there will be temptations towards chaos arising in unexpected ways as the elemental threat grows (they will work more in pairs or larger groups, schedule more garden times and so-on). Accordingly, there may be a tendency for more bandits to attempt approach, so while avoiding paranoia about guests, security will be important (they acknowledge, and will change patrol routes - especially focusing on the north-south pipe). They don't have the resources to secure Riverguard Keep, so the river route isn't too helpful; but if Yartar can get a garrison and a trading coster down to the Keep then that would be a good way to avoid future recurrence of bandits capturing the Keep and therefore the river.

On the issue of orbs of destruction, they ask if we have knowledge about that to help them arm themselves. We share all the literature and verbal information we can. By about 10:30pm, people are getting tired; all the bread is baked; we all head to bed - before he does, though, Riglan finds an owl and uses Animal Messenger L4 one last time, asking it to fly and seek the Water Baron, the message: "Due to increasing unrest, Summit Hall advises one garrison and trading coster presence to secure Riverguard Keep against future bandits if you can spare it" - though he realises it's a long shot as she might be hard for an owl to reach when indoors.

**Riglan: Wisdom saving shit roll (we're still here, with very shit rolls) 4 + 8. He only gets snippets of a dream he can remember**. Something is calling to him while he's asleep. He wakes up - "Riglan! I'm here! I'm here!" - the voice goes to Maireagh's bag. "I can't breathe in here!" - Riglan opens the bag and senses a wave of power flooding out of the bag and engulfing him; as if he'd jumped into a  cold pool of water. "Riglan! Riglan! We can make a difference. Rescue me. Let me free. Let me free! You and I - we were meant to be together. You had rescued me. But I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe!" - and he *actually* wakes up.

**## DAY 93**## 

We awake at Summit Hall on the morning of ferrying sort-of-refugees to Riverguard Keep ready for boats up to Yartar.

Riglan discusses the dream with the other. He can't remember much at all. Insight 10+5, only. Riglan opens the bag... Something is talking to him. Drown, the trident? Maireagh pulls out the trident. "Do you want to risk it...?" - she asks. We're still at Summit Hall; they have priests; Temo says he'll run if need be - so Riglan tries it. We uncover the trident and Riglan grasps it. The same sense as the dream, except this time it's more like being lifted on a geyser of water. There is a feeling of power and elation - he can sense all water around him and the ability to command it. The voice from before is in his head - "Thank you! Thank you for letting me out. This is meant to be. This was always meant to happen. You and I, were are meant to be together". Riglan asks, "do you consider yourself good, neutral or evil?" - it answers that these are states of mind with no meaning; power can be used in any number of ways. "Consider this. You use power to wash away animals that are threatening a farm; livestock. From the perspective of the farmers and sheep, you've used your power for good. For the wolves, you've used it for evil, denying them food. Were you to use the power to wash away the farmers and farms, restoring the land, to the farmers you would be evil; to nature and the wolves, you would be good."

Riglan asks what Drown can do. "I harness the power of water. I protect you from the frost and the freeze. I am at home in winter, for I am strong when others are weak. I command the loyalty of the beings of the plane of water, for they all contain a piece of me and through it I exert my will." Riglan says, "OK, just one minute..." - and I puts down the trident. Wisdom saving: 8+8. Riglan decides not to put it down, just in case someone else wants it.

Riglan says, "It isn't heavy. I think I shouldn't put it down. Maybe I should hold onto it. It might overwhelm the rest of you."

Nethza looks concerned-otter. She says "Really? Hmm. Do you think I could try holding it, perhaps? Could I hold it for a moment?" - Riglan refuses. Nethza takes a step back and says, "...interesting". Maireagh says, "Well, what about if you put it back in the bag, then nobody would be able to - well - there's no risk..." - and she holds the bag item.

Riglan is uncertain so he asks the staff, "What do you think?" - there is no answer. The trident answers instead, "I can't breathe in there!" - so Riglan says, "but it can't breathe in there!" - Wisdom saving only 9+8. Maireagh, in a flash of inspiration (+5 on throw - was a DC 20), just throws the bag over the trident! Riglan hears a scream from it, but Riglan's staff pushes back and starts yelling, trying to be louder than drown's laugh. Riglan drops the trident; it goes silent.

The others figure out a way to wrap it back up and we leave it in the bag.

"Uuuh... So you said it woke you up and spoke to you in your dream?" - Riglan says, "Well, yes, but this is hardly a novelty for me is it?!" - Maireagh asks if we've got time to get to Wave Echo Cave, like, right now!

Nethza suggests - maybe Renwick? Worth asking.

So, we spend the morning travelling to the river with the families. It takes a good hour and half to ferry everyone over, helped by other boats that we can use at Riverguard Keep. Eventually everything is set up, so we get our little ex-underground boat and pole-push our way upstream. It's about 4pm - the autumn sun is hanging low in the sky - as we reach a place to pull the boat up and head to the monastery.

Riglan scouts ahead in his new favourite eagle form. He sees no movement, so lands; looks around into windows; he sees just a few wild animals that have taken up residence now. There are some vultures and scavengers picking at the remains of humanoids which were not there when we last left - he thinks Renwick has been true to his word about not wanting visitors! Riglan flies back - "It's kind of gory, but the coast is clear" - and we all walk up.

There are (relatively) fresh signs of skirmishes in the halls. We get to the main hall and see scorch marks all along emanating from the door that is another way to get up to Renwick's tower. Piles of dust/ash blow away in the breeze as we open it. We head in, loudly calling for Renwick - "It's Riglan! Don't shoot!" - perception adv. 19+8. Riglan sees a lizard with unusually unlizard-like mannerisms looking down. Riglan looks up - "It looks convincing, but you don't act convincing - I have the same problem with spiders!" - the lizard blinks, then suddenly starts acting lizard-like and runs off. Nearby, a door unlocks itself and swings slightly ajar.

We walk in; Renwick is inside. He's in his usual place in his tower, just using that one area by the desk. Nothing else has moved - cobwebs and dust everywhere.

"Ah! There has been more activity here than I bargained for... I really would rather not be involved in battle, it's nasty business - fireballs and the like." We mention that we've been dealing with various cults, in fact, and he asks if it's all more than the conjecture and here-say - we talk for a while, and he detects the presence of the book lent from Irrasil. If we let him read it overnight, he will owe us. He's surprised to see the book in person and we explain briefly about the fire cult orb of destruction, High Forrest attack and so forth.

There is talk of a way to get to or from Wave Echo Cave. Is there any way he can help us get there? He needs something from it - we have the ingot. He agrees to help us in the morning. It's a one-way trip, though, so we'll have to make our own way back. He doesn't have the time or materials to make e.g. a scroll to help us do the same thing in reverse and we'd probably not be able to use it.

It's a long, long way back but it stands a good chance of throwing the cultists off our tail for a while. We set up to sleep while Renwick reads his book and prepares the spell.

Riglan: Wisdom saving: 7+8. The now-familiar calling interrupts his sleep again. Drown is telling him she can't breathe, she's stifled and dying and he simply must let her free. Riglan's mind is filled alternately with snapshots of both past and future; of mistreatments, of other memories which aren't his, interspersed with things that Riglan has experienced but seen from another perspective, where people around him are constantly chipping away at him. Danain, for example, always wanting a share of what he doesn't deserve; Temo eating food that he doesn't need; he's greedy - Riglan is bigger and should surely be eating more than Temo. Nethza has the ring of protection that Riglan should really have - she has a shield. That's enough. Why does Maireagh carry the bag? Why doesn't Riglan? All that kind of stuff. Everything just twisted a bit, viewed differently. Future scenes - Riglan has used the power of Drown to wipe the farms and loggers and settlements of Sungift off the map; the Lurkwood forest recovers and returns to its glory. Nature restores, wildness coming back. Traders and fishermen clogging up rivers and oceans are pushed down into the waves. Things return to a more primal, natural state.

## DAY 94

We're at Renwick's tower at the earth cult monastery.

Riglan wakes up not having benefitted from a long rest. Temo says, "OMG, you look rough!" and Riglan before he can stop himself says "well at least I'm not getting fat from eating too much!". Everyone has a sharp intake of breath moment. Nethza is sharp enough to realise and say that it's the trident speaking. Riglan in response says, "That's easy for you to say when you know it's harder for me to get me own back thanks to that ring you're wearing that you don't even need!"

**Nethza says, "you are right, I don't need it. I don't" - she takes the ring off and puts it on Riglan's finger. She looks him in the eye. She's not angry or sad; she's just got a look of understanding - care and love. She holds his hand. "You hold onto this."**

We see how Renwick's got on. He's been listening. "By the sounds of it you had an interesting sleep - you were talking..." - he hands us the book. "I am ready when you are. The only spanner in the works is that I need to hold onto this ingot to cast the spell - you'll have to come back here to get this back!"

Riglan just looks awkward and embarrassed as he's not sure why he's acting this way, but he knows Renwick - "We'll be back for a chat," says Riglan.

"Are you ready?" asks Renwick? We are. He draws a circle in the dust, just to show us where to stand. We do so. "When I say so, you need to let go of my hands because I'm not coming with you. This is very important!"

He casts the spell.

**POP!**

We appear in the foundry room of Wave Echo Cave. This understandably surprises various dwarves, gnomes and humans who turn around and ask, "What is this?!" - a wind pushes out from us as we arrive, displacing air - a voice shouts, **"MAIREAGH?!" - it's Gundren**. He runs up and gives us hugs - before warning us that we've materialised in a dangerous place, just in front of the furnace. 2ft further back and we'd have materialised inside it!

We explain our presence - finding dangerous items, need melting. Riglan first presents the Hellfire Longsword. Maireagh jumps in and insists that we go to the forge straight away - because the *other *thing needs to be taken. Riglan considers not going, but can't resisit (D6 - high, goes, low stays - rolled 6). Temo is quite distracted after what Riglan said and doesn't really notice what's going on, but Maireagh and Nethza are exchanging glances.

On the way to the forge, Maireagh reaches into the bag and pulls out Tharden's boots, saying to Gundren - "They've been great, and really useful for me, but I've got faster thanks to them and I don't think I need them any more. If there's anyone who would appreciate holding onto them more, it would be you." "Something to remember him by?" "Yes, that's what I thought".

Maireagh looks at Riglan as we get to the forge. "I think we should put the trident in first. Would you like to do it, or one of us?" - Riglan doesn't want to touch it again and thinks it'd be a bad idea. Nethza offers. She pulls it out and places it in the forge, saying, "Start it up!"

Riglan: Wisdom 13+8. Competing voices suddenly start calling out. A frantic Drown "they want to injure me! They are taking what is rightfully yours! What is rightfully *ours!*" - and his staff, trying to get louder and drown out the voice - whispers and sounds of druids. Suddenly there is a bang and, in one burst of strange blue light amongst the green glow of the furnace knocking everyone back except Riglan braced against his staff, he sees the trident melting in the forge and sees, in its heart, a writhing core of elemental water that's screaming in his head, shielded only by his staff, and at the heart of the three prongs is a piece of Olyhdra herself. She had imbued herself into the weapon - a piece of very, very old magic. As the tether between this and the magic is burned away, the noise just gets louder and in Riglan's mind's eye, the staff voice echoes shouting and the last bit of weave of magic in the staff connects to the closest thing of ancient magic nearby - and the voices quieten...

...Riglan stands on a large lily pad in the middle of a lake. Either side are two elven druids; their advice is in part forming the echoes he hurt. One is the druid who asked him to choose in a prior dream between staff and sickle. Another is the one who brought him into the treetops to see the lake/flower ceremony. Then Riglan sees a third too, shimmering with an almost translucent outline, looking like an Uthgardt tribe member in reincarnated form; then he becomes aware of a fourth, last elf, a feeling of presence but not quite really there. Riglan can't quite place who it is but doesn't recognise them, it's just recognising the feeling of who they are.

They look to Riglan and say as one, "The world is once again under assault from the forces that don't belong here. Primordial forces whose time has long passed, but are unable to move on. We have always played a role in maintaining that balance, because without us, without a measure of care and understanding, the primal state is chaos. The material plane is that chaos, brought into form; just as there is a balance between good and evil, there is also a balance between chaos and order. Do you understand, young Firbolg?" - Riglan understands, though isn't sure if he agrees if it's true. "We have been the custodians of Ilpharn and Phelorm for thousands of years between us and we've approached it from different angles. What is your approach? is it..."

* First one says - "to nurture life, to create abundance?" - this is the druid that showed him the vast forests in some of Riglan's earliest dreams and shows Riglan the ability to create rapid, verdant growth.
* The second says - "or are you a fiery defender of nature, do you fight to protect and preserve?" - this is the one who offered the staff or sickle; shows him the ability to turn into a primary warrior.
* The third says "are you about the history and foreverness of everything?" - and shows a cycle of gods and creatures cycling and forever teaching and watching over new generations; a vision of Valhalla
* The fourth says, "do you observe and step in only to save?" - Riglan now realises that this is Reidoth, a piece of spirit that it seems has been reincarnated again and again, so Reidoth is not the first incarnation. He fades in and out because he only intervenes when things are going badly wrong, else he just observes. Balance maintained without interference.

"You do not need to pick the thing closest to you; perhaps pick the thing that will provide *you* with balance."

Riglan thinks for what feels like too long. He has parts of all of that. He has to acknowledge that he's done the second thing the most lately - he tends to rush in and fight. But he's also wanted to help preserve nature by nurturing life; as best he understands it so far, and it's very early days, one way to stop people encroaching more on forests and other land is to help them get more out of what's around them without just wasting space. Abundance; nurture.

The first druid nods to the other three. The fourth walks forward and places a spirit form of the pendant the real Reidoth already gave him; but this in spirit form and warps around the staff. The three then disappear, as the first one now steps forward, puts a hand on Riglan's shoulder and says "Right, let's return to your time" - and suddenly he's back in the forge about to fall over. Nethza is rushing forward to catch him. In front of him, he sees the last moments as the trident melts, Olhydra's spirit is burned away and the magic within is drawn into Riglan's staff. The voice of the first druid says, "You can always come and talk to me if you need balance for your thoughts and ideas. I will always be here". The staff thickens and grows older in Riglan's hand; the small twigs and leaves at the top extend further down. It looks more like a tree branch.

Without saying anything, Maireagh throws in the hellfire sword - it audibly to everyone screams and sizzles as trapped spirits shoot away, freeing them up; magic is released in violent. Riglan backs away.

Nethza looks at Riglan, straight in the eyes. "We all got thrown back. You didn't. You fell forward and that's when I raced over to catch you. I get a feeling something more happened than what we saw?" - and Maireagh points and says, "And your staff looks different!" - Temo comes and says, "Riglan? Riglan is it you?"

Riglan takes off the ring and hold it out to Nethza. She asks, "Are you sure?" and he says, "I don't think I deserve this after what I said." "You know that we're family and family can always say things to each other? We will always be here, even if you push us away." She takes the ring and puts it on, giving him a hug.

Riglan, "Thank you, and it wasn't really me talking I think, but I still feel foolish for how I behaved..." - Maireagh says, "ha! Welcome to my world. Shall we get out of here?" and starts to leave. Gundren is walking off too and Nethza follows.

Riglan looks at Temo and says, "It's interesting that I fell forward - the staff was holding me up, but I think I might have jumped in after that trident given half the chance... Yes, it's me." Temo jumps up and tries a hug. Riglan puts him back down and tries to apologise for his comments. Temo reckons he'll be OK, it'll pass with time. "Thank you for being my friend... It's really hot in here and the forge is scary. Let's go."

We head off after the others. Everyone catches up a bit on the walk out. The forge has been doing very well, going better than they hoped. They managed to find a lot of people interested in coming to help get things going again. They've even been building the rails above the tree roots that'd been talked about - it's nearly done, though it's taking a while. But it makes it a lot easier to get to town, as a lot of it can be done that way. People tend to do a week on and four days off (though some dwarves perhaps stay down longer out of choice!).

He shows us around. Many parts have been restored/rebuilt. Cave-ins have been cleared. Some furniture is in and lights are set up. The water channels are running. There are bridges and stone steps to help get into or over the chasms. Wreckage at the true main entrance has been cleared and stone steps restored. Security is reasonably good with guards at all guard posts, with the cave back door (where we'd come in originally) properly secured now with sturdy doors.

Gundren offers us a ride on the new rail system to the swamp edge, and hasn't been in town for ages so says he'll come along. He heads off for a bit then comes back with his new boots on and a chest strapped to his back. We follow him to the main entrance, which we see is quite grand and is being beautifully restored - a dwarf and a gnome are carved, 10ft high, either side - one restoring stoneworker says, "Well, I'll be damned. Gundren? Are you actually leaving?!" Banter ensues. The stonemason gives Gundren a hastily written list of things to get. A gnome runs up with a sheet of paper - a similar deal - another list of things to get. Maireagh takes that on.

We head down the stairs to a small station with a platform and little rail carriages either side. Gundren gets into a carriage with a compartment behind for cargo, we follow, he pulls various levers and it starts to roll. "It's powered by stuff we've mined ourselves" and winks at Maireagh, showing her a crystal that's been fitted inside. Maireagh is very enthusiastic - this is her design, made real. They get into a technical conversation while we watch the swamp speed by. It's disarmingly fast!

Riglan is pleased to see that the track is raised and doesn't interfere with the roots. It scares the animals a bit but they'll hopefully get used to it. We finally pop out of the swamp and there's a makeshift platform here where we can disembark. It takes only around 25 minutes instead of hours.

After that, we all walk into town. There are plans to extend the railway further in future. Even as-is, we get to Deepgarden Keep in the early afternoon.

Gundren needs to go and see Sildar, and we say we'll go with him as we need to check on Owlbear Keep's progress. We also should keep him up to date on the issue further South. On arrival, Gundren opens the chest and pulls out a stack of *four* platinum trade bars - "as promised, this is your share!" - and hands them to us. A bit of a speechless moment. 50pp ea equivalent! He says, "We're starting to kick into proper production so this should improve in time."

Riglan asks SIldar how things are going at Owlbear Keep. He points out that the money has run out now, and we should go to see what we think should be spent next. Maireagh also shows him the official document from Yartar. Sildar will get a copy made for their records. It's fully official now - Maireagh is a liege!

Gundren insists on taking the list from Maireagh and says we should get over to the tower, so he'll take care of the miners' shopping! We'll head to the tower, and Sildar says he'll come along - he has his own horse but is able to requisition some for us from the garrison. He can't find a warhorse for Riglan, but we reckon if we ride and gallop we can get there in 3 hours. Riglan therefore says that it's OK but he can do without.

Before we leave, we give him a brief rundown on things happening South so he's aware of security issues - they have noticed a curious rise in crime and hadn't thought much of it (wandered indeed if the Redbrands were back) - but have been able to take of it so far. The Zhentarim had been a bit more active and drawing his attention too as he tries to counteract their influence. He's deliberately been holding back the town economy to make it look less economically attractive - a smart plan. It's why Gundren always comes to see Sildar; people are less likely to notice the amount of money being pushed in from the forge.

We mention a boat south; Sildar works with us to get Lion Shield Coster to kit one out for when we return. Lion Shield Coster is happy to be paid for passage as they can also ship down some goods that they wanted to get going quickly but hadn't been able to justify the shipping costs for. Estimated distance is estimated at 80 miles, at 1spp per person per mile - 8gp each. 32gp. We have the loyalty card, and ask what it'd take to - and we'll pay extra - have the ship keep moving both day and night. Turns out it does anyway as they want things there quickly anyway. So we don't bargain and pay the 32gp.

We also advise that we'll head out of town first and meet him a distance out, since if the Zhentarim are more active, they might be relating our whereabouts around the network given that we know the elemental cults are looking for us. It would be a shame to portal up here covertly only to be spotted on the open road with Sildar and end up putting him and the town at risk.

Riglan wildshapes as a giant eagle for the journey. It's fun!

There is significant progress at Owlbear Keep. Some outbuildings have been rebuilt, which were barely more than foundations. Stairs up into the tower have been restored. We chat to the builders and get shown around. There's a store, quarters and even a meeting/dining hall built via the outbuildings of which the tower is the centrepiece. That main hall is particularly impressive.

Maireagh is happy that things are being restored wherever possible; they haven't touched ancient things, and have focused on building outbuildings on existing foundations, with more or less nothing done in the tower itself other than clearing rubble and fixing the stairs for access. It's been weatherproofed with a temporary roof to help stop things degrading, and Maireagh agrees that having a proper roof put on would help with that more.

Sildar mentions that people who pass through often want to study the ruins; he could hire someone to start cataloging things ready for when Maireagh is able to take up that mantle in person. We agree we'll pay for that. We also think that an outbuilding made to be a sort of library / study area would help there. We're shown onto the now-accessible second floor of the keep, and in fact it looks like this was once a library. Once someone has catalogued enough of the tower, then this could be used for that purpose and in the mean time the store room is mostly empty and would be a good place to keep paper / books dry and away from wind etc.; some kind of stables would be useful for everyone too.

They show us that they found what look like old stonework of a waterwheel room, with all the wooden parts long rotted, but it looks like it used to be able to perhaps used for milling or something. That's one which would need cataloguing for historical records first if it were to be restored.

We end up back in the main hall, restored based on the ground pattern of the lower walls, which had a fair bit remaining. There's confidence that this used to be a main hall and dining area originally. They have some temporary tables but recommend that we get something built some time. They point out an unfinished fireplace; it looks like there would've been quite a grand hearth there at one time. We agree that this is a good idea.

There's the question of stonework - trying to look like the designs and ornamentation in the tower, or keeping something simple? The general feeling is to having a clear distinction between the original old stonework, and new clean stonework; Maireagh wants it strong and watertight! It doesn't need decoration - just good stonework. Match the quality, don't match the decorations.

The foreman slightly sheepishly mentions the question of pay... It works out at 180gp/mo for the four of them. There are material costs too.

We elect to pay for a three month spell with a hefty float for materials since they might get into more woodwork etc. which might get more expensive due to needing more tradespeople. **With that in mind, Riglan says that 200gp/mo seems like a nice round number he remember for them since they're doing a good job and it's heading into winter so less fun, so 600gp for 3mo and materials they say would probably need about 500gp, so we give 600gp so they've got headroom and say we trust them to get good bargains but not skimp on quality either. The tower roof would be a special case needing scaffolding and that'd be another 200gp or so on top. 1400gp in total.** They're happy to have this administered via Sildar in escrow, as it's far too risky to have all that money on site. So, 1400gp goes to Sildar.

Hands are shaken to seal the deal.

We consider staying, but we'd only be drawing attention to Owlbear Keep and Sildar wants to head home. Maireagh just wants a bit of time, though, to spend some time in the tower. She's very taken by the place; looking at things, dusting them off, checking stones; the promise of discovery. Nethza and Riglan try not to break anything, though Temo is more hands-on and inquisitive. After about half an hour, Maireagh sort of snaps to and says, "Alright! Shall we go?" - she walks out of the tower, looks back for a moment and smiles, and jumps onto her donkey. We say goodbye to the workers and head back.

It's dark on arrival. 7:30pm ish. Sildar carries on over the bridge but we stop off at the Alsweir Steading farm. The shop is closed, but we know our way around and knock on the house door. Silhouettes move around inside an a head peers out from the glass, look surprised and the door is unlocked - Celline is very surprised! "Carp! Carp!" - he runs up - "TEMO!" - he runs to the door and jumps up at Temo. There is much merrymaking.

She says there's nobody in the cottage and offers to let us stay - we're happy to do that (we'll drop off the horses). We all head over to the cottage. Riglan can use magic to get the fire going quickly, tea is boiled, Carp sits on Temo's lap. Temo shows off a bit with his new tricks.

Riglan pulls out the lantern and explains what it's about, but says he can't tell them too much about the festival yet because it's not happened yet. Carp is delighted - he's never had a lantern - but he's not allowed to play with fire... So, Maireagh casts Continual Flame on it! Even better.

We talk more about some of the things we've done, though focus more on the positive stuff than the murder hobo things - Yartar, the High Forest, and so-on. Eventually, Celline points out that Carp has finally managed to tire himself out and fallen asleep on Temo. And at that point, we notice that Temo has also fallen asleep.

Celline quietly and gently disentangles Carp from Temo and heads back to tuck him into bed. She comes back with a bundle of cloth wrapped around half a loaf of bread. "You remember where everything is! You can probably make a bit of vegetable soup; there are carrots at the back of the house if you want any, help yourself. I'll see you in the morning!" and she heads off.

We make a bit of food with minimal carrots - which are very good - so it's a good soup of carrot, grain, some stuff we still have left. Maireagh's very good at this kind of thing. It's around 9:30pm. Before bed, Riglan heads out and takes the horses back to the garrison.

## **DAY 95**

We get up early, pay for the room even though Celline told us not to, ask if there any apples left despite being autumn - and indeed there are some late harvest. Sweeter than the earlier ones. So we buy those. ***_LOOK BACK FOR PRICES_***

We hurry over the bridge, and see if Blackfinger Forge has anyone there; it's the end of the day for Koza, Mareaigh's sister-in-law, but we pop in for a quick chat. She eventually says to Maireagh, "You know, I did manage to get my hands on some - I refined the ore myself - if you wanted any..." - she pulls out a block of Adamantium. "I don't really know what the market value of this, but why don't we say, like, a trade bar?" - it's an easy unit to deal with and the exchange is made. We also hear stories of what happens at night (since that's when they work) - bandits, people a bit more suspicious of each other that lingers, furtive glances. At least Sildar seems to be keeping on top of it as best he can.

We say our goodbyes as Koza heads off to bed. We nip over to a bakery, buy a new loaf and a few pastries (1ep) and quickly nip back to Alsweir Steading to drop of the bread and say our proper goodbyes there. Carp of course is full of ideas and things we could all do together, and Celline wishes us well.

Before we leave, we ask if there are any small objects from this place - turns out there are some small painted stones under the oak tree and we can take one. Celline knows the spell! She also says Riglan should get to know it - a curious comment. Riglan does so; it's an old oak that wasn't felled when the tree was created. There are a handful of others around that are younger.

It's time to go. We head to the bridge, follow the river along a short way to a dock and get onto the barge. There is a small room with two bunk beds that'll mean we can all sleep together, even if cramped.

We're on our way.

Riglan: Perception 11+8. Riglan notices differences; an energy, a feeling that's not quite right within the environment itself. It's less obvious on the river than on land, as if a degree of calm settles over the river somehow. The air is buzzing though and the weather is still unsettled. Days seem to cold yet nights too warm.  Listening in on conversations on the ship, we learn that some surrounding farms, after a seemingly 2-year long winter,finally got a summer but crops started to fail getting closer to Autumn for no good reason.

The river is quiet - in fact we pass nobody going North. The Captain tells us that the rivers just haven't been safe enough for much traffic; both pirates and beasts. Fortunately though we encounter no trouble; we take supporting watch at night and, again, nothing.

## DAY 96

It's strangely cool, the sun shining through a bit of a mist or haze, offering less warmth than it might for this time of year - but we realise we're alongside the Evermoors now. Everyone is on edge, watching the banks; visibility becomes poor. We do eventually sail out without issue, but notice a queue of people apparently walking away from the road, queueing perhaps? With a spyglass, Riglan sees that they're headed towards a small structure on the edge of the trees; they go in, come back out a short while later and walk back towards the road. Temo has a look - he thinks it's the well, the wishing well we'd been to the once, except the queue looks much longer. Times are tough; people are searching for answers.

Up on the hills as we continue, we see various tents; camps being set up. It's late, and we recognise that this is the camp we stayed at where we first encountered the earth cult. There are more boats now too. We're close to Yartar.

By about 6:30-7pm we see that lanterns have been floated on the river. As we approach, we see that the Morning Spire is lit up as are most towers and parapets along the walls. We see that houses along the riverside have houses hanging off long poles in many cases - we mention the festival to the Captain by means of explanation, but of course they already know of it. That's part of why they wanted to get the shipment down quickly, because it's a very busy time of year. As we get close to dock we can see it's very busy and they recommend we take a rowboat skiff to shore and tie it up, as it might take them a long time to get sorted out.

**We get in the boat, row to shore and, that's it - we're at Yartar**.

A torch is lit on the Morning Spire. There is singing. It's very busy; families with children line the river, some of them releasing lanterns. We learn that it's in memory of people who have passed. We wander up to the Morning Spire; various services are being given - thanks, remembrance. As we cross the docks, we see up the streets into town small processions here and there.

We even recognise some of the people we saved unloading a ship, being greeted by various people! Riglan, perception: Total 22 - Temo is trying not to get underfoot! - Riglan notices in the docks area, a familiar face; the Water Baron is here, with armoured guards that help unload and sort out food as it is unladed. Riglan points it out and we go and say hi.

She thanks us for finding the food and people, but talks about "that other thing" **(the orb) - not tracked down yet**, and believed to be somewhere in the city. Are we coming or going, she asks? Well, we could stay a day or two... We're invited to meet here at the Water Barron's tower later for chat, in around an hour. We agree. She turns and is distracted again by the work at hand, so we head off.

We're on Evermoor Way heading into the city now. We see behind that scaffolds over the bridge have high wires with numerous colourful lanterns in lines right across.

We decide we need a place to stay and head towards the White Winged Griffon. It's very busy - we might end up in tents outside the city wall. Temo leads the way, finding back routes and quick ways to get through the crowds. Temo: Wisdom saving: 17. The market is full of things - it's the busiest we've ever seen. All kinds of stalls. Temo manages to avoid it though, saying, "We'll come back! We'll come back to the market", so we get there quite easily.

It's very busy. A makeshift extension to the dining room occupies most of the foyer. The two owners are busy carrying trays of plates and food, looking a little harried. We nervously enquire about rooms - if we're not fussy, they have a 2 bed room left with some roll-out cots which we could squeeze into. Temo shrugs and says, "no problem". Maireagh asks if it'll hold her weight - apparently, they're robust.

"More secure than a tent!" says Riglan, and asks to pay for the night. They apologise because it's more expensive - 2gp for the tiny room, rather than the large family room with balcony from last time. After thinking for a moment, Riglan decides to pay for 2 nights (4gp). There's only one key, which we give to Nethza to look after - Riglan realises that he's a bit clumsy, Nethza and Maireagh are very responsible and will be all good and Temo can unlock the door without a key anyway!

We head upstairs. The room is on the middle of the 2nd floor and not hard to find. 2 beds, a small table, a little chest and no bathroom - it's shared, at the end of the hall.

We want to visit Wallheims but we'll do it later - Temo is itching for the market, so we head out into the chaos. We quickly encounter stalls extending well up the road, even past the Happy Hall. Every fourth hall is a lantern stall.

Surprising Riglan for a moment, Temo loses focus for a while and just sort of spends a bit of time dawdling around at a lantern stall distracted by them, despite all the food. Eventually the smells reach his nose - a weird mixture. "Euw!" shouts Maireagh - "are those insects on sticks?" - and indeed they are. Riglan tries some. They're crunchy, but perhaps not too exciting. They're not bad tho, so Riglan gets a few more for later, much to Maireagh's disdain.

One stall sells little tarts with bright yellow custard designed to look like little lanterns (floating tea lights). There are various clearly out-of-towners, a myriad of racers including a gnomish stallholder selling various kinds of jewellery, charms and so-on. There's a beer/booze stall (of course) with barrels piled high. A small halfling family have a colourful sign of "Meadery - Waterdeep's finest".

Riglan notices that Temo isn't buying anything and points at back the little lantern tarts and he agrees, so we head back that way only find Nethza walking towards us - we hadn't even noticed she'd gone, eek! - holding a box of them. "Look what I found! These look great." We have them and they're good. Temo looks at Riglan - "It's not because of what happened with Drown... I'm just waiting for something that feels right. These are great though, for sure."

We see a half-orc-like guy with a sandwich board. "Brave the worm at the water well, limited time only!" - and Temo says, "See? Something that feels right" and runs up to enquire, to the bafflement of the rest of the party.

There are sounds of cheering and encouragement; we see there are 12 tables outside the Waterwell - signs everywhere - including a picture of a cartoonish worm looking angry and bursting out of a bottle". There are bottles of firey-looking liquid with a worm inside, some yellow, some green, some orange. Some flagons have several worms. People are getting tiny little shots of the worm drink, setting on fire and drinking the shot. It doesn't look safe! The prices are of course insane - 5sp per shot.

Temo sees the others looking reluctant and sees the prices, but says, "we have too much and want to give some of it back, remember?" - and does Puss In Boots eyes. We've no idea why he wants this but go along. There are so many options! Group prices and so-on, very confusing.

We find space at the end of the table and end up with a shot each at 5sp -> 2gp, rather than any of the complex drinks. "FOUR RED DRAGONS THANKS!" shouts the server over to a bar man and a kid runs over with a tray, deftly avoiding people, the server makes a show of laying them out and laying them on fire and starts changing "BRAVE THE WORM!" and gathering a crowd.

We knock them back - con saves all round! Temo: Nat 20! "Not the first time I've braved the worm!" he says, with a glint in his eye - ah, he must know something. Riglan: 13+3, so he does OK too. Maireagh: 6+6, so it's clumsy but she gets it down alright. Sadly Nethza only gets 4+4, gets into a coughing fit and the drink comes out - "Oh that is *disgusting!*" - people come around patting her on the back and making light of it. Good thing she's resistant to fire!

The kid comes back up and puts down 4 glasses of water and a small tray with some nibbles - "Happy lantern festival!" and walks away. We see that on his shirt is written, "If you haven't wormed you haven't lanterned! - 1490" - with the "0" crossed out and a "1" written in.

Temo looks cheered up. "This takes me back to my college years in Luskan. But I'll tell you what - the stuff we had back there was clearly watered down, because this is way stronger...!"

We finish up and leave, managing to avoid being dragged into the various items of worm merchandise (!). Back in the main market, we see some very ornate stalls including a few caravans that take up certain market spaces in small circles, as if in little camps. They look exotic. Not from these parts.

We happen across some Amnian traders with black stallions tied up nearby that have clearly travelled a long way. There are scents of incense, perfumes and spices, with lots of jewellery and exotic clothing, rare metalwork pieces, even some weaponry. We find we are able to trade out gems and art pieces easily there and convert many of our awkward stones at decent prices. Many of the Thurl's jewellery from Feathergail Spire has on distinct marking and is valuable in and of itself. Some things we hold back, as Maireagh suggests a museum (e.g. the Dwarven silver ewer from the elemental water temple). In a self-proclaimed  "Bazaar Of Wonders" we even find a few healing potions, sold by Calorshite merchants.

Temo is feeling bogged down by all his kit. He wonders if there are any bags that might be a bit like Maireagh's and help a little with his carry-weight issue. Investigation: 13+9. He sees some mercenaries in a weapon's area, and wanders over with the rest of us in tow. One has on display a set of small leather armour. They explain that it was recovered in the Far North during excavations in a glacier cave, as a thank-you for saving someone they found trapped in the ice. It's magical but doesn't fit them so they're looking to sell.

Pockets on the armour emanate a strong dimensional magic, but it's quite expensive - **5000gp - and would require attunement, so he'd have to have his crossbow, sling or war mage wand left behind. There's also another choice - a rather large handy haversack, but it's a bit big for Temo to carry; and finally, over at the Bazaar, we spot an object with an otherworldly presence - a pair of elegant, silvery-blue bracelets that almost shimmer as if partly there yet not  there. We ask what those are. They are from a plane-travelling adventurer; from an entirely different world, rumoured to allow those who have mastered the power of illusion magic to create even more illusions than would normally be possible. They bear the markings of a House from that other plane - but again, very expensive. 6000gp**. Nethza is keen but not sure about cost. The merchants are here for the whole festival, so we can sleep on it.

It's time to go the Water Baron's tower - we're right next to it, so in we go.

She offers us joining her for food, so we gratefully accept. We go to a dining hall in the tower and, over food, we relay the story. She did get the bird's message about a trading coster and garrison; Adbar Trading is very interested. We caution against going down deeper into the underground river; the entrance should be guarded. **We will of course have to coordinate with people there if the dragon turtle is to be brought through**.

We ask about the orb. The Water Baron has to be pragmatic, avoiding favouring groups and throwing things out of balance. Compare with Baldur's Gate with over-attacked criminals just driven underground instead, or Neverwinter where too light a touch lets them operate too freely and visibly for her tastes within the city proper. Besides, Yartar isn't that wealthy.

With that in mind - she reveals that she has informally engaged with the criminal elements of the city in search of something as powerful as the orb. The Hand confirmed that the Orb was in the city. A third party is holding an auction for it - "not again!" exclaims Riglan - but not on the Grand Dame. It's believed to be in one of the drinking halls, but she doesn't know which one. There are four interested parties but don't know who they are; if any intended to use it in Yartar, they'd be powerless to stop them.

**The ideal situation would be to take the orb out of play entirely,** then have it release its energy "somewhere safe" rather than have it just detonate at random, which it is likely to do given time.

"There is someone who has been across all of this with me" - she turns and the Captain of the Guard comes in, who we had not noticed. He sits, "I apologise for the subterfuge; I just needed to make sure that we could talk about this with you and that you weren't judging the Water Baron for her choices in how she runs the city."

He unfurls a document. "We've talked about this with my council advisors and tacticians, trying to understand - based on what you've said and what we know about these cults - what we think. The worst case scenario for us (best for them) - and the timing is no coincidence - we believe they plan to unleash it during the lantern festival. If their intent is to cause death and destruction, this is surely the most efficient way to do it! If they intend to hold the city to ransom - well..." - the Water Baron cuts in - "We would be willing to pay anything to save the lives of all of these people in Yartar right now." (It had been too late to cancel & would've caused panic by the time they learned of the orb).

The Captain says, "Now I know you don't owe us anything, but if you were able to help us out - to neutralise this for us and remove that threat, however it is that you have to do it - we would be willing to compensate you for your troubles. I'm authorised by the Water Baron to turn a blind eye to your activities in the city and help you however we can to achieve your aims. We can't openly be seen to come in conflict with any of the factions, **but we are able to pay you 250pp for your trouble.**"

Riglan shrugs and says, "well do what we can; I don't know if investigations were ever our strong point, but we certainly want to find it, just as much as you do."

They know it's in one of the "underground" (open secret) watering holes where nefarious activity happens, but just not which one.

* One Foot In The Boat
* Winter Winds

We thank them and head off, wondering what to do next. May as well get a chore out the way and see a friend at the same time - Wallheims. Even Wallheims has lanterns hanging; in houses around we see what look like busy family gatherings. A friendly vibe, gift exchanges. Some kids set of tiny little rockets, illusions - Temo at that, says, "Ah-ha! At last!" and pulls out his Wand Of Pyrotechnics, shouts, "Look at this one!" and lets off charge straight into the air. The super loud, bright fireworks are much more than we expected but very impressive - after a brief moment of still, the children go crazy with excitement and mob Temo a bit, forcing parents to intervene to calm them down.

The light is on, but there's a big "closed" sign on the door, one in the window and others taped over various places. Doesn't want visitors at a busy time! We knock politely and say, "It's Riglan and company, is it OK if we pop in?" - some confused noises - "...The Firbolg!" - we hear thumping down stairs. She opens the door and goes "ugh! You smell like you've killed a hag!" - she's delighted to hear of Thuluna's demise. Before closing the door she sticks another Closed sign on the building.

"Why are you - this is the worst time to be in Yartar! What are you doing here..." - we explain about the orb. "I guess I should go into hiding for a while until all this blows over. I have a back door to get out of Yartar if everything goes South. I like the four - the five (!) of you - if everything starts to go really wrong, just run here right away and I"ll get us out."

We thank her, but then enquire about the manticore cloak. A glint in her eye - "ah, yes!" - she pulls out this gruesome looking cloak which still has the leathery wing with barbed ribs look, fashioned into a cape. She puts it on. "Look at it!" - it looks wicked, almost evil. It's obvious what the creature used to be, but is well made with a clasp made out of bone from joints. She's very proud of those! The top around the neck has bone work covered in hide, which looks almost ribbed; there's a slight pop to the collar. "A very classic design!" - it's a dark red, like old blood.

"It took a lot of magic to make this, but I'm willing to trade for anything magical that you have as well..." and we start pulling things out of Maireagh's bag. Aneeria shows particular interest in the dragon-detecting sword and we're open to a trade. She values it in terms of trade of 400gp. The cloak would be about 2450gp, but we supplied the wings and she says that it'd be about 1200 as-is. 800gp overall if we traded the sword. She's also interested in a potion of resistance, and since some of us have natural fire resistance anyway, we trade that for 150gp leaving only 650gp for the cloak.

It turns out it lets the wearer fly!

We decide that it's best for Nethza. It's a bit big for Temo or Maireagh (and would separate Maireagh from the dog for a while, too) and Riglan has recently found he can wildshape into a bird for flight. It's also very on-brand!

We realise that if Riglan were a giant eagle, he could carry the dog and if Nethza cast Fly at L4 on Temo & Maireagh, we could as a party get 10 minutes in the air (longer, for Riglan and Nethza of course).

"It seems that since we read Morbeoth's diary," says Maireagh to Riglan, touching the amulet around her neck, "maybe I shouldn't hold onto this? Maybe you should wear this instead?" - it's protection against detection and tracking. It stops people locating you using magic. Riglan counters with "but we were all mentioned in the writings"; we are undecided. She also tells Temo that we could enchant a hand-crossbow if he's OK carrying a case of crossbow bolts, as an option if you wanted to be able to attune to something yourself."

We thank her and, as heading out, we're reminded to keep an eye out for any magic items - especially if from another hag.

On the way back, out of the blue, Riglan remembers Maireagh's reaction to Old Owlbear tower and asks her about it - insight 19+5, yay - she pauses for a moment, as if unsure how much to reveal. It's clearly something of a vulnerability thing; outwardly she portrays stoicism, but like all of us, there are more complex things within. At Owlbear, she had a look of - "this could be home". After a pause she reveals that there's something about the tower's permanence, age, it's isolation; the possibility that it might actually be the place she could see herself rebuilding what she lost. She hasn't always been on the run. Every time she goes somewhere she sets down roots in some way, previously; we recall her quirky, very "her" workshop at Verrunsgard. She's careful not to get attached though, because of the constant risk of having to flee. It would be crushing to have to abandon a place that felt like a true home. But despite her best efforts, she always fails to do so. She cannot help herself and lets her guard down, falling in love with the place. She imagines the future, being somewhere for 100 years or more, making it home. "I'm never going to have a family, I'm not kidding anyone, I'm too old for that now. But I can still have a family of sorts. And that place is - you - I don't know - I mean, I can just imagine a space for each of us there. Even a nice dry room for doggie so he doesn't rust, a high vantage point room for Nethza, a workshop and library for me, a decorated art and music studio and perhaps a performance area in the woods for Temo; all the trees and animals for Riglan.

Temo says, "I understand. I've been thinking about it too... I think I like Celline. I think I like Celline a lot."

Riglan realises that Temo's distraction with lanterns was because they'd reminded him of Carp.

We head back to our room and bed down.

TEMO'S CONVO ABOUT CELLINE (below)

(--------
"Riglan..." says Temo, tentatively.

Riglan looks up, head tilted to the left a little, right ear raised. Temo's tone is odd - he seems nervous; unsure.

"I think... I like Celline. I think I like Celline a lot."

Riglan laughs and smiles. "I think Celline likes you a lot, too."

Temo looks awkwardly at the floor, scuffing at it with his boot. "But, I mean, really? I don't know what to do about it. *Obviously* nothing when we're on the road, but one day... I mean, I dunno..." - he tails off.

Riglan is given reason to pause. He hadn't been thinking very far beyond the rest of today, never mind a future beyond wandering. Such a time could be a great many years away given his lifespan - perhaps accompanied by Temo's great, great grandchildren by the sounds of things! Riglan isn't sure how to respond.

Temo watches Riglan think; various emotions pass over his face but they're hard to read, and his long Firbolg ears raise and lower, sometimes together and sometimes separately, as if some kind of emotional antennae that Temo decides he should learn to read from one day.

"Well," says Riglan eventually, "I can't speak much about the far future; I'm not even sure of tomorrow. But there will surely be a time when we choose to leave our adventuring days behind us, or at least find - and of this, I'm certainly very hopeful! - long, happy moments of peace in between all of the excitement. I'm particularly fond of Celline and Carp and I'm particularly fond of *you* - so for what it's worth, I think the two of you could be a most striking and formidable couple. Not much would stand in your way, that's for sure! Anyway, the only way to know if it's something that can work is to ask her."

"And just how am I supposed to do that without fumbling over my words and sounding like a proper fool?"

"You're asking the wrong person about relationship advice! I'm younger than you in Firbolg years, and didn't even know that most of the things we've seen even *existed* until I left my forest just a few short months ago. It does, however, strike me that I've yet to see you at a loss for words..."

Riglan pauses for a moment, thinking; Temo still looks unsure.

"Look at it this way," says Riglan. "We trust each other, you and I, on our travels. We are friends, we've helped each other out of danger many times and we're each confident in the abilities of the other. Put that same confidence in yourself and trust your instincts. Just be you - since if, as I suspect, Celline likes you as much as you like her, then it's *you* to whom she'll be most happy talking - not whatever person you think that perhaps you ought to try and be instead. And no matter how much you might fumble words, she'd no more ever take you for a fool than any of us would, Temo Smoothhands, because she's no fool herself and certainly sees as much of your abilities as we do."

Riglan stands, and heads towards the door. "I'm going to see if Maireagh and Nethza are finished with the repairs. I hope that one day I'll be as lucky as Celline and Carp would be, to have someone like you as part of their family."

Now it's Temo's turn to laugh. "I know you don't quite mean it like this, Riglan, but you already have quite a few people like me as part of your family. And you always will."

RIGLAN'S RARE HERB BREW: 5 HOURS SPREAD OVER TWO DAYS.

NB: **Day 96 roughly should be start of Harvest Lantern Festival in Yartar**.

Riglan considerations: CHANGE TO FIRE Black Earth were responsible for a lot. Whatever else the wind and fire cults might've done, they will have to wait; likewise, water cult, despite our suspicions about their role in problems with Yartar's food supply. Sort out the orb, then get to the monastery, catch up with Renwick and go down those stairs.

- Day 94+ Manticore cloak (possibly) - paid for already

Plans:

* Take out guards somehow, e.g. Temo invisible, Riglan hidden step & looks like one of the guards, knock them out, Maireagh disguise like the other; done at e.g. toilet
* Somehow talk to him, e.g. message scroll, to try and convince him not to trust the people he's with; are the guards to protect him or imprison him
* Perhaps agree on a switcharoo, using disguise self, "accidentally" bumping into him and leaving a dup in Disguise Self with Quori himself hidden temporarily by minor illusion.

Spur of the moment actions:

* Try secondary deception, e.g. Druidcraft, but that's deception roll so high risk.
* Can stop someone shouting via an attempted grapple - contested strength - muffle their mouth; Maireagh can perhaps help (Flash Of Genius) via reaction if she knows what you're doing.

Options for persuasion:

* Persuasion roll
* Insight into their motivations
* Ask what it would take to get a result
* Bribery
* Ways to ask DM: Enquire if others in party would have skills related to the problem, or even if my character might have ideas (even though I don't as a player)
* For things like perception checking, instead of saying "I want to look around to see if there's anything strange" as it sounds like a cheat code. But if I were to say, "are we observant enough to see if anything looks out of place in this room?".
* Can also go for a very long form "We study the room in detail. Can you please tell us what we see?"

Temo considers a tattoo of masquerade; Nethza, of ghost step, maybe one day of life ward; Riglan thinks that perhaps one day a tattoo of Shadowfell, or a barrier but it would need to be quite a high level one.
