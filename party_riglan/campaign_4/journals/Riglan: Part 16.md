# Riglan: Part 16

## DAY 89 (continued)

We are in Riverguard Keep, having emptied it out and said goodbye to the people we rescued, who are sailing upriver to Yartar on Shoalar's ship. We intend to head down underground. Riglan's cast Water Breathing for everyone.

We go down to the under-keep dock and push off in the boat we've "borrowed". Temo's panther and weasel are present until tonight. Riglan's hawk and wasp have long since been thanked and departed back to Fey planes. We load a small amount of extra food, mostly for the panther!

Riglan uses his permanent flame, Temo uses his light ring and wears his goggles for good measure. We don't expect to stealth our way in, and want to try and spot any hazards as quickly as we can.

The current is quite slow; it's not always wide enough to row; so we use a poll. About 50ft down, we encounter another gate - ah! That must be what the rusty keys are for. Riglan (perception 3+9) doesn't see key holes; Temo investigates (17+9) sees hinges, but sees no lock or lock mechanism above the water. Riglan and Nethza don't mind getting wet and have water breathing! So we dive down. The light doesn't go out under water.

Two dead bodies :-/ - not ghouls fortunately - and a lock, so that's probably why the Fathomers always came along. They could turn into water serpents and use the (rusty) keys. We manage to get the gate open after some time and effort. We're paranoid about bad things escaping into the river so we **shut and lock the gate** after the boat is through.

Riglan perception: 19+8. The cavern walls are damp but don't look like they've been wet at the top. Looking at the cavern below the water line - smoother walls than above - we figure that the water level here is quite constant. There are changes in flow speed from time to time; we sense a decline. No rapids though.

After an hour (!) Maireagh is feeling restless. Temo too. Nethza is just keeping an eye out. Riglan survival: 2(!)+8, so he's not sure how long they've gone. Nethza guesses a couple of miles. Riglan insight 18+5 - it doesn't feel like there's a repetition, a pattern that might indicate illusion, a subterfuge/trap of a looping section of river or similar. Things are samey for sure but not identical. Riglan does notice that for a while there were fish, but then none for a patch. Now, there's a different presence of life; a different ecosystem.

We push on (literally). Another half hour passes and then we sense a bit of a change. The sound alters up ahead - an echoing. We try shutting off lights for a minute and letting eyes adjust. There are some reflections on the water up ahead, maybe 300ft; lights. **We stop pushing and drift quietly, but we drift backwards! Somehow, the current direction changed.** We don't know when. So we have to push the boat, and just try to be quiet.

The underground passage starts to open up into a much, much larger cavern. We're about 60ft from the mouth of it and can see into the space. It looks almost like a lake, but with structures on it; walls rise up. There are steps, moorings and landings; ornate columns and even roof-like areas. The cavern roof rises 50-60ft above the surface. Directly ahead is a corner wall, with decorative carvings that give it a fortification appearance. The water gently laps at it. We approach with a choice of left or right; we head right, with buildings extending to the right, built almost out of the cavern wall itself there (Dwarven buildings). Immediately on the right, as we emerge properly, we see a proper boat landing on the right. A boat is moored there. Torches are held in old stone sconces next to some kind of pier.

Riglan looks around to see if he can see anyone (Perception 14+8). It's clear that people are moving around in buildings and around the canals. We pull up onto the rightmost landing; in a nearby passageway we can see around five figures! Temo - int. based stealth, 6+9; even with 15, he doesn't think we can really hide, there's just not enough cover. So Temo says, "can't hide, gotta bluff". Temo - int. based deception, 12+3; a Fathomer comes down here with captives.

So Temo is a captive. Nethza & Maireagh are going to be there because of the dog, also captive but we'll say they're guarding. The panther can slink around the back behind us. It can try and keep out of sight. Riglan most recently remembers Reash, so has a go at Disguise Self & a Reash impersonation if need be; and with that, we get out of the boat, and walk confidently out hauling the dog and Temo as if captives.

The five people notice us and step out onto the dock. Four reavers and a Fathomer. Riglan just says, "More captives." "Oh. Is this all you've got? They're not worth putting into the drowning pools, are they?" "Nah, not worth drowning." One mentions ghouls and the metal dog not turning into one, "Maybe chuck them in a cell until we've figured out if they're useful." - Riglan, adv. deception 12,20 (yay!) - 1. Maireagh chimes in - "Look, we're just told to bring them down here, I've not been here before, you could at least be helpful" - a Flash Of Genius reaction - to add +5 to the roll, so total 24. They say, "Fine. Whatever. Go along here... I don't know what Gar wants to do with more of these captives! They're useful as bodies for the ghoul army but beyond that I don't know. Maybe he's keeping some of his own near the temple... I dunno... Go down this way. Ask someone else."

So off we go, pretend-marching the captives. We round a building near where we docked, which appears occupied. A building opposite seems unoccupied but is locked, so Temo tries to unlock it with mage hand (SOH 17). he realises It's just a latch on the inside - this is an exit-only kind of door. Whoever latched it might still be inside, e.g asleep or something. Temo sneaks inside quietly (Stealth: 15+11). It's dark; he pulls down the goggles, perception 17+2. He first notices an acrid, musty smell; damp and mouldy. There are bars along two walls, with what looks like cells in them; they seem to contain only manacles on the ground or chains hanging loose. Nobody here. He finds another door on the opposite end that opens to a larger road. Everyone creeps inside and we pull the back door to, latching it again. The front door is also locked. Riglan now sends a fey bat to scout.

It moves to the main "road" we'd seen at the alley end. The cavern arches up about 50ft providing flying room, but there are rock columns supporting the ceiling. Distant movement. The canal we saw is part of a system; there are various building sizes and even some kind of open air market square like place, over the bridge; many different beings, of different kinds there; about a dozen. Small lakes connect the canals. Luminescent lichen is present here and there; the bat senses the patches, and we realise from the radar "shape" what the lights we'd seen ourselves were. Riglan spends a while getting a feel for the place and basically it's confusing, especially in the middle. A confusing area North where the canals change into something else, which seems interesting so we decide to go back to the alley and head into the north-east corner first, to try and investigate the region.

Heading out the back, we spot (Riglan: Perception 17+8) some reavers leaving a building and also a knight standing on a shark cruising up the canal northwards. We wait a second for the coast to clear, but notice the door not shut where the reavers exited. Going past, we hear grumbling and spy within what appears to be barracks.

We continue. The road basically is a "U" around this building. We end up more or less at the same E-W position as before, heading N, and to the right now is the cavern wall but with strange parking spots - bays - for wagons/carts, we notice old rails in the road and on  the left is a building with a strange big set of big doors that look like they rotate. Maireagh notices - "Grain silos" above it in old Dwarven. Riglan tries to push them open - Ath 16+6; the door rotates around the middle. Maireagh says she's heard about these but not seen them. It's fortunately smooth and quiet. Riglan and Nethza have to duck - the entrance is only about 5.5ft tall. We rotate the door closed behind. It's completely dark, so Riglan calls back the bat to look for it for a while. There are two silos that drop 50ft down. Stone steps circle around to the bottom. A space in the middle, maybe 10ft wide, separates them. A service pathway basically. The silos are empty and in fact everything looks like it hasn't been used for a long time.

Maireagh examines the walls. The grain wasn't for eating - Dwarves don't eat grain - it was for the Thunderhammer Brewery. So this part of wherever we are - we assume, another fringe of Tyar Besil - was the Thunderhammer Clan, who've taken pride in the area here and carved histories of the rise of the brewery into the wall. Indeed, the market-square-like area we saw used to be exactly that. The Thunderhammer Clan was perhaps the biggest of all, but spent their money on building the brewing infrastructure entirely, then opened this section of the city to all, for anyone interested in the trade. This whole area used to be breweries, store rooms and waterways, channels and sluices that control a spring that they found in the area, to power the machinery and provide pristine water for brewing. The history shows that the clan went into a noble marriage with Besilmir, and absorbed into the city proper. Tyar Besil then used Thunderhammer Clan's market town, in which we now stand, as their main export hub for everything coming in and out of Tyar Besil along the underground canal and Riverguard Keep into the Dessarin.

Riglan gives Maireagh some paper and Temo uses his light ring to help her start transcribing things. Riglan then looks around and we can only see our own footsteps in dust on the floor, so it seems this really is unused and that gives us some breathing space. It's also a bit of trap, but Riglan can pop the familiar up outside the door to check if the coast is clear.

If this was a major export route, it should have good connections to the main city. Follow the rails, find the city maybe?

Riglan goes to the far corner of the silo to keep in range with the bat while it looks at the target area - the weird canal / waterworks area. It does note the rails leading into a rather grand entrance with many carvings and dwarven runes on the Northernmost edge. The way on to Tyar Besil perhaps.

Following the canal, though, it turns out that at the vision limit there's a tunnel throwing out water onto an ornate area to form a sculpture waterfall of sorts. It seems to be the canal water source. There's a bridge here which goes up and over, like the others, but not down again; this bridge terminates at double doors with ornate carvings.

After much discussion we can't figure out many better ways than to just approach it by the walkways and bridges, bluffing our way through. We head out of the silo and walk South, to the bridge; it's by the barracks doors. We walk boldly as if marching Temo & the dog. We cross. We get over, nobody around fortunately; as we reach the other side we reach a t-junction, with northwards a cul-de-sac of sorts, so we have to go even further south. We reach a courtyard with a broken once-ornate fountain in the middle. Carvings are not dwarves; humanoid on top, holding tridents and spears, with fish tails. Two are broken, a third is complete. There are various doors but the path exit leads west, so we follow. Riglan: Perception 13+8. He gets an uneasy feeling but can't tell what it is. Stairs zig-zag up a bridge over a canal; hmm, OK, so we cross. As we do, something leaps out of the water and knocks us all off into the water (3 extremely low dex save rolls from Riglan, Temo, dog). There was a greenish blue scaly rough skin.

Riglan manages to grab the dog which immediately started to sink. Temo can't find a way out. A bit of a confused start, but initiative is rolled now.

On Temo's turn, he looks for a way out. He sees a quay/landing about 100ft north of where he is he shouts to the party "I'll head for that", but only gets about 30ft. Swimming not his forté. Maireagh shouts, "it's a troll!"

Maireagh calls for where the dog is; Riglan has it. Maireagh casts Levitate on Riglan, so he lifts out of the water with the dog and Maireagh then pulls him onto the quay up on the side we started from. "Thanks!" says Riglan but is terribly concerned for Temo. Maireagh sees the dog is still functional and puts it on guard.

We're all watching the water closely but can't see much. Nethza already used her Armour Of Agathys in the morning, so she runs around closer to Temo but can't see the troll and can't do much else. (Dodge action).

Temo: Grapple save only 2+8, FFS; disadv of water negates nimbleness. He's grabbed by the ankle. Tries to wriggle free, Athl 11+8. Just manages it, avoiding the troll's bite. It tries again with its other hand but doesn't get a grip. He's underwater - but can breathe, at least.

Riglan casts L3 conjure and gets two CR 1 giant frogs! They appear in the water; one swallows Temo, leaps up, spits him out then jumps back in. The other attacks but misses. Temo takes a punt on which of two objects he perceives is the troll - gets it right. 25 to hit, sneak damage 27. Maireagh, Nethza and the dog run across the bridge since they see the troll is busy. The troll tries to swim away and the giant frog opp attack -> nat 1, FFS. The troll leaps out and lands on the middle of the bridge, cutting Riglan and Temo off. It sees the two of us and moves towards us. It roars. Shit.

Riglan backs off a bit, and throws a flame onto the troll for 13 damage. We see it can't heal from this. The toads leap out and try to block its way off the bridge. Temo risks taking aim, hits and gets an amazing damage roll - 33 total (6,6,6,5,4+6). Maireagh is *just* able to run back up and get into melee range, attacking twice with her longsword, hitting twice for 21 total. This takes down the troll, but it's a troll, so... The dog runs up and guards in case it comes back up. Nethza runs up as well but has no fire to hand. The troll doesn't regenerate though, because of Riglan's fire damage.

Riglan pushes the troll back into the water. At that point, we hear a voice from behind us - "Well. Aren't you just so rude. You kill one of my trolls and you don't even come and say hi!" - we turn and, in the courtyard, is a hideous looking slimy, scaly, wart and boil covered, dark green hag with rotting seaweed for hair and bits of barnacles, mussels and so-on stuck to her; slugs seem to crawl under her skin. She bears an ornate looking, twisted, driftwood staff with a scull on the top. Moving in behind her are two ogres.

Riglan tries to bluff about being on important duty taking prisoners to the temple but deception (12-1) doesn't really let it happen. He's not too surprised!

"Get off that bridge and come talk to me like civilised people. Your disguises are terrible."

Riglan just gives up and lays it on the line - he's actually truthful. Maybe this hag is on the temple's side, maybe not. Various emotions cross the hag's face but Riglan can't gain insight (8+5). She says that if we're going to kill Gar Shatterkeel, go for it! We don't know why but she gives us permission to cross so we go over - aware that our disguises aren't the best... Disguise Self has worn off.

We find a quiet corner & check again via bat; there are two options. Straight through the busy square; or along the river. The bat senses quite a few people in the square; it flies up high, almost to the 50ft roof and looks down (Blindsight 60ft) but there are no other bats around and its Stealth is only 11+2. Around a dozen assorted moving creatures. Riglan (bat in range of seeing-through-it) Perception 12+8. The party is huddled close, unsure. They are preparing for a fight. Brave but weakened and tired. Now's not the time.

Riglan casts Pass Without A Trace & re-casts Disguise Self. He instructs the frogs to swim via canals to roughly where the grain silo dock was. We try and return there ourselves via the land route, but give up the pretence after what the hag said & try to stealth it - cling to walls, use the bat to check for clear coast along open runs and so-on. Of all our stealth rolls, thanks to PWAT the lowest is 17, then >= 20 up to a rather crazy 36 for Temo. It takes at least 30 minutes to get back, due to stopping and waiting a lot.

At one point, Riglan (perception 11+8) notices two reavers nearby and one turns just as Maireagh, dog & panther tripped over each other. Riglan tries druidcraft to distract the reaver in another direction hoping that we can use that secondary distraction to escape, but only rolls deception 2-1. **Roll initiative**.

Temo gets the panther to run up and it manages to bite for 5. He uses this to try and get an arrow in, but rolls 2+9 on the attack and misses wildly. Nethza runs up and hits with her mace - a hit and, yay, a crit for 9+14 damage, taking the reaver down. Nethza then looks over and points at the other one, who's turning around having heard the commotion.

Riglan sees he's about to shout - brings down the bear totem for strength and advantage, hushed whisper to Maireagh "we can't let him alert people!" & runs up to grapple & silence him. Advantage only gives Athl 3,7+6, but Maireagh does something to give a +5 ("flash of genius" - says "Riglan, put your hands over his mouth! & Riglan pretty much just fumbles his way to kinda covering his whole face in furry furbolg hands). This muffles him - he can't shout - he rolled 11+4, so without that +5 it'd have been game over. He tries to wriggle free - total 17 - Riglan finally gets a good roll in contest, though, 16+6 -> he holds the guy in place.

Maireagh casts Branding Smite while trying to knock the wind out of the reaper with her sword's pommel. She hits for a total of d8+6+2d6 -> 17, goes again, hits again, and this takes the guy down. Grisly.

We stage a scene of a fight over money - take some of the gold and gem bags off one, stuff in pockets of another, bring them close & look like they stabbed each other. We sneak our way back, avoiding two more patrols - **we make it to the grain silos**. Riglan checks for the frogs at the dock but can't find them and suspects they may have met a sticky end.

Stealth does not really work in this space! It's very busy and there are few hiding places. The river is very hazardous too.

From the comparative safety of the bottom of one of the grain silos, Riglan casts Divination as a ritual - "What is the best way to get to the doors of the temple undetected?"

The embers glow and play light tricks across the smoke, making almost a shadow play on the silo walls. Movements of lots of people - a courtyard, over a bridge; it coalesces into the door that is the goal; smoke fairies appear, fly around looking at the shadow things, talking to each other; they fly over to Riglan, merge into one and it says: "You seek a path to these doors, undetected... The answer is there are none" - and they dissipate. One small one lingers a little longer, throwing a small ember, almost spear-like into the air - "but this, this creature could get you there; the costs - are they worth it? - for she is not to be trusted" and flits away. It's an outline of the hag.

We eat, then have a rather nerve-wracking long rest at the bottom of a pit. Temo is curled up against the belly of his panther, with the weasel sleeping on his shoulder. Before sleeping, Riglan re-casts Breathe Water for everyone.

Riglan: **Wisdom saving - 17+8. He dreams, and remembers clearly**. A little fairy flies up to him as he sits next to a stream. It's idyllic, sunlight glinting, large pebbles near his feet. Bunnies and chipmunks nearby are playing. The fairy says, "I've been looking for you! We're not meant to do this! You asked the wrong question, but I thought I knew what you meant!" - it draws the doors on the sand near the stream. "You asked us how to get to these doors" - then she doors two little holes next to it with streams of water coming out. "But you can get into these... You don't need the doors... Oh! Oh no! I think they're looking for me!" - and she flits away. She's circled both of the pipes in the sand.

## DAY 90

The hag or the pipes... Suspect we take out main guy and hag will jump in. We could go for hag preemptive but getting there is tricky; using chaos from taking out main guy might be better & we'll be able to assess our condition to see if we want to fight on. Certainly need to take out both "bosses" as Riglan is confident that one will just take over where the other left off otherwise.

With Water Breathing cast the night before, Riglan does a ritual for Walk On Water & we'll walk to the pipes if we can, then he'll wildshape to a giant lizard, with rope in mouth, climb up & the rope assists everyone else. Disadvantage - he's up front, checking for traps as a lizard; we'll have to risk it.

Time to go.

Riglan first, Maireagh & Dog, Nethza, Temo checking the rear. We get down to the dock; Riglan (perception 12+8) notices that the canal is a bit more turbulent than it looked yesterday, flowing faster; we wait a moment studying the water and notice no signs of life immediately around. We risk it and step on the canal. A little disconcerting, been a while since we did this. After a while we start to get the hang of it.

We reach the corner; Riglan perception 14+8. Approaching quite fast are two knights standing on sharks. Insight, 14 (again) + 5. It's a patrol. We won't be able to hide. Even so, Temo gives it a go - we crowd up in a corner and Temo uses Silent Image to try and make it look like the walls are in front of us (bad guys Investigation check against his spell save DC 14). We prepare to fight though and wait very nervously as they approach, watching intently. They round the corner, but the one nearest brushes the fake wall, revealing the illusion (his investigation was 17). 

Initiative! Riglan & Temo 20+0, 20+5. Weird time to get two crits, kinda wish I was saving those for later but a good start anyway.

Temo strikes the closest knight (which hasn't at that instant seen through the illusion) with his shortsword (adv. 5,12+8), for 23. Riglan activates his staff and takes a swing at the one behind who'd seen through the illusion, but misses wildly (nat 1). That knight then swings about and gets its mount to try and engage Riglan. It tries to bite. Hits, for 8 damage; the knight tries its lance as Riglan is distracted (sneak attack damage, shit). The first misses but the second hits for another 12. The other knight was surprised and doesn't act too quickly.

Nethza says to Maireagh - "Maireagh, you've got Riglan, haven't you?!" - "Uh, yeah, sure...?" - so Nethza turns to the first knight and draws the mace, attacking twice. Both hit, for 14 total. The knight looks injured, but certainly not edge of death. Nethza now moves in front, trying to block the way. Now Maireagh's up. She moves between the two sharks, holds up her shield, does something with it and a swirl of spectral blades appears around her. She's trying sword burst again, to try and hit everything in the area - sharks and knights. Only the knight attacking Riglan avoids it (makes the save) - 2d6 rolled for 12 damage, max possible. Now the dog the harmed knight up front to try and take it down; it hits for only 4 damage. Temo's back up - he strikes again, hitting for 24, killing the knight despite the knight's attempt to uncannily dodge. There's still a shark though! Not worth the dagger; Temo's thinking of his wand, so nothing more for him to do.

Riglan still has a problem. The shark's let go but the knight is still there. He gets in a hit, albeit for only 8 damage, but it dodges to only take 4. Mirroring Nethza, Riglan moves around behind the shark; no opp attack from shark as melee throughout, neither Knight since lance has 10ft range. The knight retaliates - the shark attacks Riglan. It has blood frenzy but surprisingly misses (adv., but very low rolls). The knight repositions and attacks once with its lance, the dog acting to impose disadvantage, leading to another miss.

The knight's dead and its shark doesn't have the same rapidity of movement, so Nethza gets to act first; she pulls back, happy to risk an opp attack from the shark (which misses) and throws eldritch blasts which both hit. Unfortunately rolls only a 1+4 and 2+4, for 11 damage only. The shark moves forward, opening up an opp attack from Maireagh which hits for 8; then it tries to bite Nethza, but misses. Maireagh flanks the knight and attacks, hit and crit - 14+19; it dodges the first hit, for 7+19 taken (26). The dog attacks and hits for only 4 (lots of 1s being rolled on damage lately). Temo hits the shark with his shortsword and does enough to take it down (21 damage).

Riglan attacks the shark, since Maireagh flanks it. Crit! Only 2d8+5, only a 6 and 2, so 13 damage. The shark is still drawn to Riglan and this time its bite finds its mark, for 16 damage. Riglan's messed up, at only 24 of 60. The knight once again tries its lance, but the dog again distracts it, but it still hits for 18. Only 6hp left and we're in the first 10 minutes of the day. Very much gone to shit.

Nethza throws blasts at the knight, getting in one hit for 9 damage. Maireagh attacks the knight too, hitting twice; 9, 10 and takes the knight down. Just the shark. The dog attacks it, hitting for 10; Temo runs up and stabs for 23 damage, taking it down. The bodies slowly (and fortunately) start to sink.

Riglan tries a healing potion but only gets 5hp from it. Blows Goodberry, all 10. Another healing potion this time for a full 10; Maireagh cures wounds for 13, and he gets a few more out of a cure spell on himself (2d4 only 1 each tho, awful rolls again, 7 total).  He's at 51, that'll have to do and we're wasting time.

We press on. We hug walls on the market side, trying to avoid detection; there are no more patrols in the short journey left to the pipes. It's still odd to Riglan that there are no other fish etc. swimming around - something is clearly keeping them frightened away. We get to the first pipe (rightmost), Riglan turns into a giant lizard, takes rope in his mouth and heads up. There about 10 ft of tunnel, then ahead he sees an ornate kind of archway with water flowing towards him; there's a decorated stone wall to the right; to the left there appears to be 2-3 feet of wall out of the canal and then a platform. It enters a wider space leading to the left; there's a current coming from a hole in the ground on the right. It's only about 2ft deep. Riglan quickly investigates; it goes into a natural but small cavern, and another short tunnel that he wriggles through. It's dark, but the lizard has darkvision (30ft). Water is emerging from all kinds of small holes in the ground - it's a natural spring source. Difficult to reach; only that small hole. Nothing much here except several chests on a dry area raised up above the 30-40ft pool where water emerges, on the right is a ledge that perhaps was once for tools or other dry storage. No other exits, just chests, probably a safe room of some sort.

Riglan hurries back to drop the rope down. Swimming back, perception 8+8, he senses and can hear movement in the room; light too. He can't really warn his party in lizard form so just heads back to drop the rope. As lizard, Athl only 7+5, 12 not enough to help; so Temo tries to use it as a guide to hop up (Acro only 7+8). Not quite enough but Maireagh helps him up (flash of genius - hushed whispers to help him find a handhold he otherwise didn't see). Nethza makes it up, with more help from Maireagh; and so-on. We do eventually get up but Maireagh blows 4 of her 5 inspirations. The rope is wet and slippy, with an uncertain anchor from the lizard.

In the end, Nethza, Temo, the dog and Maireagh are squeezed into the 10ft run of roughly 10ft wide 5ft high tunnel through the thick walls, squished up a bit by the roof curvature. Riglan skulks barely below the 2ft deep water just into the main area past the walls and peeks into the chamber. He sees two reavers, someone in priest's robes but with the usual chain shirt armour, another in a very different style of clothing with no visible armour and another similarly un-armoured but very unusual looking. Looks almost like a corpse. Like a victim of drowning. Crusty barnacles on one side of his face and bits of chitin attached to him, with one arm almost claw-like. He carries a very heavily decorated trident, that looks like it's maybe steel with bronze barnacles.

We don't think there's anywhere to hide and can't see how we could really surprise them, but a nearby pillar affords a dim corner for Riglan to help Temo out over the 3ft ish wall to try and get out of the water. Temo Stealth - 9+11, we're not told if it's successful. Maireagh comes up behind to help up the dog and Nethza is close behind. Riglan steps out (as himself) and is near the pillar but fully visible (Temo still hidden). He looks at the one he hopes is Gar and says loudly, "Gar Shatterkeel, I presume?"

The reavers turn, swords drawn. The one Riglan guessed was Gar has turned and says, "COME OUT! Who's calling me?" Riglan steps out. "My name is Riglan..." and sort of tails off. Behind him, the mage who turns have an iced over crystallised look to one side of his face. The furthest away starts to head away towards a distant door. "What do you want? Why are you here? Why should I let you live?" - he raises hit trident and water arounds him starts to surge and take form.

We say we've maybe helped him out by getting rid of the earth and fire cults (we don't mention air). He says, "Oh, you're here for a reward. How predictable! Shiver, get them a bag of gems" - the other guy is Shiver. He throws a bag of coins onto the ground in front of us. But Riglan, after a moment of surprise then recomposure, replies, "I was hoping we could persuade you to leave before we do the same thing here?" - in response, Shatterkeel calls a *very* big water elemental.

Initiative is rolled! (Unfortunately, really quite low for the entire party).

Gar moves back behind Shiver, towards the rear of this church, or temple, or whatever the strange space used to be. He directs the water elemental to crush us - "Leave none alive! More for our army!" - ugh, the ghouls we guess. He sweeps his trident and a tidal wave sweeps in from the conduit we were previously swimming through, aimed at everyone except the still-hidden Temo.

Dex save DC 16, but everyone fails :-/ so 4d8 -> 19 damage and we're all prone. Riglan's already down to 32 of 60. Now the water elemental moves next to Riglan and tries to engulf him. DC 15 strength save, another bad roll 4+3 -> massive failure. 7 more damage and grappled. One reaver runs backwards to protect Shiver and Gar. Riglan is forced to bring in his bear spirit early then tries to break free; only rolls 7+3 and 2+3, but Maireagh shouts "Roll! Roll!" (her last Flash of Genius) and so he just manages to break free. He risks an opp attack and moves away to try and get some distance / create more targets. But it hits, for another 14 damage. He only has 23hp and no temp.

Another reaver comes, heading for Riglan, sword drawn. Shiver casts a spectral ice kind of armour. Temo aims and fires, hitting but with a crappy damage roll of 5d6+6 -> only 18.

Nethza centres a big area spell in a way that tries to catch as many cultists as possible while avoiding the party; through her piece of Shadowfell, throws out a sort of bioluminescence which looks similar to that which we saw at Shadowtop, but here it forms a kind of Sickening Radiance that spreads out. She then moves behind the water elemental.

The fleeing priest at the edge of Nethza's area spell fails a con save., taking 4d10 of radiant -> 20, and it suffers a level of exhaustion, glowing with a strange green luminescence. It throws a Chill Touch at Nethza, but misses. It runs out of the room through a side door - damn. It'll raise the alarm.

Maireagh clambers to her feet, particularly grumpy; the dog is commanded to do the same. She runs up to the elemental near Nethza, the dog running to Nethza's other side, and attacks, hitting twice for 23 damage. The dog gets in a bite for 6 more.

Gar has to roll a con save too. Succeeds; no damage at all. He calls down an ice storm into the area where most of our party is battling, but is forced to hit his own elemental in part. Temo dodges for no damage, Maireagh dodges too for half damage (the elemental too) but the dog and Nethza take the full brunt - the total is 4d6+2d8 -> 21. Nethza at least does hold her spell.

We notice that the elemental freezes and solidifies a moment when hit by the ice; it's slowed. The elemental succumbs to Nethza's spell before it can act further, too, taking 24 radiant damage and a point of exhaustion. It can only move 10ft, but still tries to pursue Riglan since those were its most recent orders. This triggers three opp attacks - Nethza, who uses her mace to wrap it in thunder and does hit (Booming Blade) for a total of 12 damage (and if it moves more it'll trigger the next stage of damage); the dog hits for 6; Maireagh hits too, for 12. The elemental still tries to move forwards triggering the booming blade for 9 damage - and that's enough. A thundererous wave of shattering ice makes it disintegrate out into a spray of water.

The reaver that was defending Shiver and Gar runs forward and throws a javelin at Nethza, but misses.

Riglan has no choice but selfishness. If he conjures animals in the sickening radiance area they'll be affected. He remembers a Potion Of Heroism and drinks it (10hp + Bless) plus L3 Healing Word (average dice roll, 4d4 1,2,3,4! + 5 for 15), so he's not great but away from immediate danger maybe. Maireagh calls him over so he runs to his party.

The reaver nearest the group succumbs to the sickening radiance and actually dies, there and then. The Shiver saves though, and looking perhaps a little panicked, throws a spell at Nethza. It misses, and Misty Steps to get clear of the sickening radiance spell area. It's almost a stand-off; we're all working at 60+ft range and nobody wants to run through the middle.

Nethza asks the party if anyone can hide or block us from attack. We can't, but Temo realises he has a fog cloud scroll so she tells him to drop it towards where the Shiver is and running priest went (she thinks that guy is coming back), so it obscures that area and hampers their attacks while we focus on Gar. She's at great range so all she can do is throw Eldritch Blast at him. A hit and a miss, for 7 damage. Not much but it's the first time we've got anything on him.

Temo reads his scroll and casts the fog cloud, then hides behind the nearby pillar (stealth 18+11). We hear yelling coming from the adjoining room - he must see the fog cloud coming into the room there.

Maireagh moves in front of Riglan, turns to him, tells him to hold up his hand (which he does) and casts Warding Bond. The dog is brought forward to the edge of the sickening area and mends (heals) itself (for 2d8+3 -> 14).

Gar fails his saving throw, but uses a legendary resistance to succeed. He eyes up Nethza, reaches out a hand and casts Hold Person, but Nethza (just) saves. Gar runs backwards, out of the sickening region.

The remaining reaver now fails to hold itself steady against the sickening region, taking 16 damage; it runs out and tries to attack Nethza directly but misses.

Riglan casts Coujure Beasts; 4 giant wasp appear. Gar is at the very edge of range but can be surrounded; Riglan keeps one high up to avoid opp attacks that he can move over to the priest later if need be.

The reaver by Nethza once again tries to hit her but misses (Temo's high stealth hide roll means that he's not noticed). The shiver runs up close to Gar, clearing the fog cloud and keeping out of the sickening radiance region, and he's got a distressingly good line of sight to everyone! He looks at Riglan and casts Chill Touch. Riglan is a strange choice as he's partially hidden by a pillar, unlike other party members; the Shiver must have noticed that Riglan brought the wasps in. Because of the cover, his spell attack misses.

Nethza attacks the reaver with mace, hitting twice for 17 total. Temo tries to get the Shiver with a fire bolt but misses (nat 5+7 attack). He decides to not hide this time - he stands his ground.

The priest runs in again from the door where he'd gone to hide; sees the fog and curses. He stumbles around and (by dice roll) sadly doesn't stumble into the radiance. He casts some kind of spell but we don't know what it is. We hear someone else running in from the same area and complain about the fog too.

Giant wasps! All four roll well below 10 on attack (I mean, statistically, WTF) and miss wildly.

Someone *else* is heard running into the fog cloud. Meanwhile, Maireagh attacks the reaver, just hitting and taking the reaver down. She suggests to Nethza that it's time to take down the sickening radiance region and gets the dog to self-heal. We hear even *more* people on the far side of the room - Riglan suggests that maybe we do still need the radiance after all! (Four unknowns now, plus priest).

Gar sees that he is surrounded by the wasps, takes some steps back and gets two opp attacks which AGAIN both roll below 10 and miss. He does Thunderwave and all 3 wasps in range roll again below 10 and fail, taking 7 damage each. He comes closer to the group, skirting the edges of the Sickening Radiance region.

Riglan has little he can do, cantrips Frostbite but Gar saves. Riglan moves a little to have a bit of cover from a nearby pillar, instead of being in direct line of sight.

The Shiver now casts Thunderwave again! All wasps fail with yet again very low rolls, 14 damage, killing two immediately. At least Nethza now manages to get close enough to Gar to get a hex on him, then casts two Eldritch Blasts. One hits for 17, the other hits for only 11. Temo tries with Firebolt and hits, but only rolls damage of 3.

The priest finds his way out of the fog cloud and calls to the others to follow. He comes alongside the Shiver. He casts Blur on himself. One of the unknowns succeeds against the sickening radiance and makes it out of the fog. The wasps - con save for the one in radiance; 2. WTAF is going on; that kills the wasp. The other wasp tries tries to attack Gar, rolls only 3 and misses, so it's just ridiculous.

Another unknown wanders into the radiance but (of course) succeeds the saving throw.

Maireagh ponders options. Across the diameter of the 30ft *radius* radiance region, she's outside 60ft so can't even do anything with available ranged spells. All she can do is reposition and casts Cure Wounds on herself. She again suggests that Nethza drops the radiance region - Temo is forced to concur.

In the far corner, the remaining two unknowns make it out of the fog cloud.

Gar looks at Nethza and throws down an ice storm over the whole area we are in. All 5 of the party are covered. Dex saves all round. Temo succeeds, Riglan hopelessly fails (rolls 3). Nethza just succeeds, Maireagh too but the dog fails. The total damage (halved for Nethza and Maireagh, Temo taking none) is 2d8+4d6 -> 26. Riglan only takes 13 because of the warding bond, meaning Maireagh gets the full 26 and is not in great shape at all. Nethza holds her spell.

Riglan tries again, getting giant crocodiles via conjure; very awkward space, can't place them well.

The Shiver is up. He throws Ray Of Frost a crocodile but surprisingly misses.

Nethza drops Sickening Radiance. She runs closer & throws Eldritch Blast at Gar; hit and crit for 16 and 20 damage. As a bonus action, she teleports (!) right up into Gar's face. Temo runs forward and JUST hits Gar for 30 damage. He then hides back behind the pillar - rolls 1, rerolls 20! - stealth total 31.

The priest moves forward. He throws a high level ice knife at Maireagh. The dog and Riglan are in the shatter radius. He just misses Maireagh, but the shard explodes for 4d6->13 damage. Thanks to Warding Bond and prior potion, Riglan makes his save - 10 + d4->3 + warding bond 1.

Croc 1 bites the Shiver and gets it, for 8 damage and grapple. The second croc attacks therefore with advantage, for 12 damage. Croc 3 misses Gar but Croc 4 hits, grappling and doing 8 damage. This takes down Gar! It plops over the ledge and drags Gar's body into the water, holding it there. It starts to munch on his arm, like a dog with a bone. Nethza pulls out Gar's spirit, to convince it to do the right thing! "We need to talk! You need to tell me what's going on and why you've done all this." (Spirit rolls high initiative - 20; NB the wasps and crocs both got a total of 9 for theirs).

A reaver runs up and attacks croc 1, but misses. Another reaver is lost in the fog. Maireagh gets close enough to the priest for Thorn Whip. She does get a hit, pulling the priest right up to her and doing 8 damage. The dog runs up and attacks too, hitting for 10 damage.

Another reaver runs around and attacks croc 1, hitting for 8 (no extra die due to croc's natural armour). The remaining unknown (actually a priest) stumbles around and does find a way out of the fog; he also skirts around to where the other reavers were and casts Hold Person on Nethza - DC13, +5 modifier - she fails! The Spectre surprisingly is up next and flies over to the Shiver, hitting thanks to grapple advantage. Life drain - 3d6 necrotic - rolls 10; plus DC10 con save, succeeds.

Riglan steps out from around the pillar, casts Dispel Magic on Nethza, which has immediate effect, then steps back. The Shiver Misty Steps, escaping the croc grapple. He throws Ray Of Frost at the dog, hitting for 10 damage. Nethza decides the priest who held her is a danger and Psychic Lance at him. He fails his save so it's 7d6 (!) -> 23 damage. The priest is incapacitated too. She runs up behind the Shiver.

Temo tries to hit the Shiver but only rolls a 5 -> 14, misses. He hides again, nat fucking 20 what a total waste, 31 again on that hide.

The priest in front of Maireagh casts Hold Person on her. She fails her save and is held. The priest backs away.

Croc 1 tries to attack a reaver, nat 1, misses. Croc 2 attacks another reaver and hits for 11, grappling. Croc 3 moves in a bit closer to the Shiver and 4 squeezes into a space where it can flop the body of Gar onto the bank.

The reaver on Croc 1 hits again but only for 3 damage. The grappled reaver tries to wriggle free but fails. Maireagh can't do much, since she's held - she tries to break out again but fails a second time. The dog breaks free of its freeze restraint and moves into the space between priest and Maireagh.

The lost-in-fog reaver falls into the water in that part of the room! The other priest is incapacitated so can't do anything (his unknown-to-us plan to cast Sleet Storm is scuppered); the spectre flies around avoiding opp attacks by going *through* one of the rock pillars and attacks the incapacitated priest with advantage for a total of 9, the priest making his save. Riglan throws flame at the other priest for 11 total, trying to break its concentration; it doesn't work. He casts L2 Healing Word for Maireagh, rolling max possible with the staff's extra D4 for a total of 19. He hides back behind the pillar for some cover.

The Shiver turns and casts Thunderwave at Nethza and the Croc 4 and Nethza. Croc 4 fails con save by a mile, so does Nethza. They take 13 damage. Nethza doesn't lose focus though, and is worried about that other priest, so throws two Eldritch Blasts since it's no longer incapacitated. She hits twice for 11 damage. She moves up against The Shiver again. "Temo! We're counting on you!"

Temo throws 4 charges of magic missile, so 6 in total, 3 each for the mages. The one by Maireagh gets hit for 11, the one further away for 9. This takes them both down.

Croc 1 moves around to flank the troublesome reaver and hits, grappling for 5. Croc 2 crits, for 20 total damage! 8+10+2. It eats the reaver!

Croc 3 pushes in front of Croc 4, space having been made thanks to Thunderwave. Attacks Shiver. Rolls 17+4 to hit! Only 7 damage, but the Shiver is grappled. Croc 4 is allowed (DM permission) to squeeze between Nethza and the Altar, but this puts it in fog. Its advantage of Shiver is nullified and it misses. At least it's hidden from the Shiver for opportunity attacks!

The reaver grappled by croc 1 attacks at disadv but does hit for 4.

Maireagh runs up the Shiver. Attacks - Crit! Dodgy rolls but still, 16 damage - this kills the Shiver, who falls, slumped over the platform edge, partly in the water. She runs into the fog - Temo gets the hint... The reaver in the water is just splashing around.

The spectre attacks the reaver grappled by Croc 1, hitting for 11. Riglan takes the dodge action and keeps an eye on the main entrance.

Temo drops the fog and runs up towards the revealed-lost-in-water reaver. Nethza throws Eldritch Blasts, hitting twice for 11 and 6.

Croc 1 can't quite get a bite on the last reaver, but croc 2 crits and eats the reaver. Gory. Croc 3 dodges. Croc 4 splashes into the water and gets up to the reaver but misses (nat 6+4). Maireagh uses her whip and pulls the reaver out and up in front of her, dealing 6 damage, which is enough to take them down. That's everyone gone.

We're beaten up. 8 rounds of combat, a lot of high spells blown and low HP for many of us. But, we did defeat the people in charge here. We're aware of likely attack of the Hag - and the Hag may not be the only person who wants to grab control of this strange place.

We investigate Gar. Most people need to short-rest, but Temo's OK so he checks things out. Investigation 12+9, starting on the room - entrances and exits; there are the main double doors to the south, magically warded; the pipes we used; the side door the priest used has another large room behind it, which seems to be personal quarters for the two priests and various reavers. The area seems to be repurposed as a general gathering area; T-shaped main room, with two doors  on the southern side, one to the priest's quarters and another that goes to a long snaking tunnel. He scurries down to see where it might exit. It turns a couple of times but reaches a collapsed part; next to there is an ornate stone door, after about 120ft down the corridor. Two eternal flame sconces light it either side. He makes a note to tell the others; the door is clearly of significance.

Priests quarters: investigation only 5+9. Mainly personal effects. There are books, scrolls and writings that they seem to own. He checks the scrolls and books; various personal writings, logs of events; two large journals which he brings back for Maireagh - 600 pages each, no time to read now! There's one transcribed spell scroll which he also collects - arcana 10+3 is just enough to recognise a spell of Mirror Image.

He gets back and Riglan describes the tunnel to the 'treasure room'. He gets up onto the ledge with the 3 rusty chests and an area which seems to be sat in quite often (the ground is smoothed off); on one side there are scratches as if something was dragged along. It goes back into the water.

He uses mage hand to check one; nothing is triggered; he lifts the lid. He checks others. Two are just full of coins - silver, copper and gold; at a guess there's **around 820 gold pieces here**. He goes back and gets the Bag Of Holding, goes to the treasure chamber and fills his boots, so speak. The third chest has an **ornate silver ewer** with Dwarven runes on it. It does not seem magical. There are **two waterproof leather satchels and a waterproof, wax coated scroll case**. He brings it all back to the dry main room. He gives the ewer to Maireagh - she sees that it is very old; maybe original, from this place. The runes are kind of ceremonial/religious in nature.

The spectre comes over - we found his hiding spot; he doesn't value them but kept them for a "rainy day". Trading value and helps keep semblance of control. Riglan mentions the hag - the spectre agrees. Anyone else? "There is my second in command, who the hag would most likely want you to despatch of too - **Morbeoth**. He is a Shiver and I had very tenuous control over him. The sea hag, **Thuluna**, I had almost no control over at all. She resides in an area of her own, with her own small army of misfits and monsters. She has never sat well with me being in charge for I was just a druid and just a human. Neither of them really control **Bronzefume** - the **dragon turtle** that lives in the lake." He explains that the turtle was drawn here by the power of the cult magic and influence but isn't part of the cult. It set up a lair at the bottom of the lake a few months ago (off to the side of the market close to where we are now).

The spectre looks to Riglan. "The grip has been released, and I can see now what has happened..." - Nethza tries to persuade him to open up more, but rolls a 1, founders and Temo steps in - 19 + 10 - and Riglan tries to understand, Insight 19+5. **The spectre has some magic and creates scenes out of fog and ripples in the water**:

* He's just a poor boy, Gar, born in a fishing village in the Ilanthar Isles off the Sword Coast
* The lsands survived entirely from fishing trade with passers-by and Neverwinter markets; a subsistence life
* The Sahuagin slaughtered lots of them - Gar ran and hid
* A merchant ship passed by; he ran up for help after several weeks alone, as an orphan, found another orphan and the two of them looked for help but the merchants enslaved them
* They lived at sea, chained in the ship for years
* One night pirates attacked and during the fighting Gar, still chained to the ship, sank with the ship; he thinks everyone else drowned; but Gar clung to some wreckage that floated up
* Sharks attack - that's where he lost his arm
* A powerful current carried him many miles; he awoke eventually on a beach, later discovering this was the Sword Coast - something or someone had saved him
* He learned to commune with the sea; he's a druid of the sea and believes in its power - he devoted himself to the study of this, learning water magic
* In time he learned to grow a new arm - but a crab arm
* His heart had been hardened by his troubled life; he know only brutality and treachery, trusting nobody
* He found other castaways and people who were rejected by society and gathered them into a small cult
* He started having visions and dreams for years, eventually leading him up the Dessarin River where he stumbled upon the underwater entrance below an abandoned keep - Riverguard
* He went down some steps (points down the tunnel Temo found) called by a vision; drank and ate nothing for weeks; came upon eventually a hidden cavern temple, upon which there was an altar with a **powerful magical trident**

* The **trident is called Drown**. It is imbued with all the power of Olhydra, the princess of elemental water. Ever since he grasped it, he had been made whole; he felt the power of it; she had been calling to him the whole time - she's the one who gave him person, but he lost himself in this
* It is a very powerful weapon, but he warns against harnessing its power because the power can corrupt
* He still has no belief in humanity or civilisation, but at least he is now free

"I fear the things - the hatred - that has been set in motion, is not going to end simply with my death. **Whatever happens, you must not let either Morbeoth or Thuluna get their hands on drown.**"

He offers to guard the double doors for us, to allow us to long rest, if we wish to do so.

We wrap the end of the trident in cloth to stop it spearing the bag and put it into the bag of holding. "As long as you keep the trident out of the hands of the others, then no more Devastation Orbs of water can be created - but there are already three in existence. **One has already been sent to the surface, with agents of the Temple of Elemental Water - to Yartar.**"

The waterproof satchels contain twelve old leather-bound books written in ancient Besilmir Dwarven script. They bear clasps and protective wrappings all in the **royal family cloth of Mirabar. More of the books that were taken**. These twelve volumes describe the excavations of a previous expedition into the kingdom of Besilmir - this area we are in *has* been explored before and books were written. A conundrum, then; the Mirrabaran Dwarves insisted that this knowledge did not exist and had not shared it with anyone. We don't know, then, if they were going to share this with Goldenfields. They did definitely insist that nobody knew how to get to Tyar Besil.

We spend more time on these with Maireagh's help. One volume describes how the old kingdom, as they dug down, discovered inadvertently a very ancient evil underground temple that had been created by renegade Drow, who worshiped the Evil Elemental Eye. This was far, far more ancient than anything else around. Another book describes how the kingdom of Tyar Besil, after retreating from the surface, created fortifications sufficient to withhold against a surface attack indefinitely - they could even grow food underground, after a fashion. So how did the kingdom fall? The speculation is that it fell from within - or below.

The deep, ancient temple complex is described has four elemental "nodes" (areas) of pure uncontrolled elemental energy. In the middle is what looks like the Fane Of The Eye from the descriptions.

Another volume describes the Veil Of Dancing Water, another enclave of the Besilmir Dwarves - they worshipped nature. It describes how to get there from the river. A further one gives a description of an expedition under the Halls Of The Hunting Axe, in which the king of Besilmir *is* buried with all of his ancestral weapons, magic items and so-on. Knowledge of this would be very dangerous - it'd be a blood bath treasure hunt; power all in the wrong hands. So much wealth and power hidden currently and, overall, best left there. The Mirabar archivists have kept this hidden.

The scroll case has two spells which only Riglan seems to be able read (L6 Find The Path, L4 Control Water).

On the altar and the Shiver we also find various gems which Maireagh estimates to be about 225gp in total.

It takes about four hours or so to get all this done. Gar then warns us that a demon guards the stairway down - it'll ask a series of riddles, things about the elemental water cult. We should be able to answer based on the above. It seeks answers specific to the cult and its teachings - the cult believes the Olhydra is the one true princess of elemental evil. She will cleanse the world and wash it clean.

We talk about going to Yartar or warning them. Temo has a scroll of sending, but has to roll DC 13 arcana. Maireagh's out of aids, so she advises we long rest first.
