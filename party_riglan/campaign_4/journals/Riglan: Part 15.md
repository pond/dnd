# Riglan: Part 15

## DAY 86

We awake in our favourite Yartar inn, the Griffon. Today we intend to use a requisition order to get a boat and head downstream to investigate the water cult or, at the very least, see if we can alleviate the food supply issues.

It's early - about 7am. We check out and head towards the Morning Spire and bridge. The market is already busy; people at the Spire are going about their normal routine. At the docks, fishing vessels are returning with an early catch. The bridge is busy with, we surmise, the people who work in ways that keep the city running. We get to Shield Tower, wondering if it's too early. It's manned with guards but the gates are shut. Riglan politely asks a guard if it's too early to deal with the requisition order (showing the paper) - we get taken in through the gate by the guard and through to the keep, where we're handed over to someone else; an older looking dwarf.

The dwarf squints at our requisition order through glasses, and quizzes us a bit about the boat - we don't, after all, know how to sail! The order asks for just two oars and a boat, but he says it's early enough that he's got time to add in a sail and another pair of oars for us. We're led down to an underground store room where it turns out there's a dock, too - shades of Riverguard Keep. The dog (he calls it "golem", Maireagh counters with "Robbit") is tricky; he picks it up, weighs it and figures that its between Temo and Nethza.

We're asked how long we'll be, but we don't know; we're unlikely to go further than Bargewright Inn but it might be further, e.g. Goldenfields. In the end, he gives us a boat that fits 6, no cabin, just a single deck - lighter and easier to deal with. We pull into land overnight. At a push, we could even perhaps carry it. "That sounds perfect", says Riglan.

We're shown a rowboat, that's only slightly longer than a normal rowboat really but it's sailable with a simple tiller to aid steering. A shallow keel makes it easier to row back on the inside of bends where the current is weaker but water depth much less. He almost literally "shows us the ropes", Temo watching intently. We're told to get in and give it a try; he'll walk with us in the underground dock as we head to the gate, just to make sure that we're not completely useless!

Riglan: Athl. 12+6, Maireagh total 19. Temo leads at the bow, Riglan rowing and following Maireagh (since those two face backwards), Nethza & the dog in the stern to balance it and steer. The boatman is happy & we're off! Away on the river. Temo stand at the prow and proclaims himself the master of the high seas with a minor illusion of a parrot on his shoulder.

Maireagh suggests summoning dolphins or turtles to pull us along though the current is doing a good job and we just need to steer mostly but we row for speed from time to time, without working too hard; we can have longer days that way, so we get down more quickly. There's a wind from the north after a while (D8 roll 1), so we try the sail. Temo's onto it with the ropes, Riglan assisting for anything up high or heavy and Maireagh staying on oars (Temo: Dex 13+8). We make good speed as a result. There's some traffic, few boats heading to Yartar and most heading South.

At around midday, Nethza and Temo swap around and Riglan goes back on oars to give Maireagh a break. The wind swings around from the East so it only useful in short patches, but at least doesn't work against us and we can keep the sail up. By 4pm we're deep into the hills (D8 roll 3). From time to time we can see the riverside track we took a few weeks ago (we sail on the right of the river as we head Southwards). In the last few hours, the wind improves (D8 roll 2, lucky!) and our progress picks up again, with less effort.

By the time we're thinking of stopping, we decide to cross over so that we're not on the track side of the river. Temo lowers the sail and Riglan (athl. 9+6) and Maireagh (athl. total 12) row across. It takes some time; by 8pm we're able to pull the boat up but it's dark. As promised, we find that the four of us can lift it and we just carry it a short way into scrub so it's more hidden from the river. We camp nearby. Riglan: Survival nat 2 :-/ + 8. Not the best spot but it'll have to do, around 80ft from the river's edge. We set up tents and do start a fire to make tea and prepare food.

We'll be on fair alert tonight; we know that there's trouble on the river and we're not well hidden. We keep weapons handy by beds and Maireagh will sleep in armour, Riglan likewise his hauberk. Watch is Maireagh, Nethza, Temo, Riglan with the dog throughout. It goes quietly - but before his watch, Riglan dreams...

As he falls asleep, he has a sense of calm. Yartar was productive and it was nice to be there but being out in the woods and hills always makes him feel more at ease.

He sees a village being rebuilt in harmony with the forest; the he sees it replicated, scaled up; spread out developments, spaced out to avoid overtaxing surrounding land. There is balance. The societies grow; some of the small villages decide to start harnessing magic on a more grand scale. Towers and spires are pushed up and out; beautiful gardens climb up the sides of trees. Despite the beauty, there is a corruption amongst the decadence. He hears a warning; a familiar voice; that of Moonan, explaining that - "It is part of the cycle of civilisations, peoples, cultures, kingdoms to grow and fall. No kingdom has thus far successfully achieved true balance, even if they start off that way; inevitably, forces beyond their control lead them down other paths. Who are these forces? Are they innate, a part of the nature of sentient beings? Or are they external?" - Riglan feels himself being shaken awake by Temo for watch.

As has become customary, Temo rolls up in the warm part of bedroll left behind by Riglan, rather than going back to his own colder bed.

In the last hour of watch, Riglan watches the sun rise slowly. Perception: 14+8. Weird - there's no dawn chorus. The odd bird, but it's strangely quiet. There is a bird nearby enough to ask why it's so quiet. Apparently, a lot of birds have migrated away. There are rumours of monstrosities - monsters - around; the weather is messed up too. Hearing this, Riglan tries to convey the location of Summit Hall as it has good gardens and is more protected.

## DAY 87

Everyone wakes up as dawn breaks. Riglan mentions the strange interaction with the bird, while Temo digs around in Maireagh's bag - looking for pastries. He does manage to find one half loaf of bread. That'll do. He asks if there are any berries so Riglan looks. Survival 19 (!) + 8. A thick blackberry patch full of autumn blackberries, so he gathers plenty and brings them back for Temo who just sort of mashes it into the bread. Riglan gives it a try; surprisingly good...

We pack up and get the boat to the water. In view of the birds' comments about monsters, Riglan summons a fey Quipper to swim and chat to any fish it can find as we float around above; he can keep in range (100ft) and find out if they have any unusual stories. So we get going and Riglan tries to find fish to speak to. Wind: D8, 8. Another lucky roll, following wind. We can use the sails.

The fish are a bit scared by the fey creature but do eventually get persuaded to talk. They don't like it up north - lots of fish have been taken by hunters. (We surmise Yartar is overfishing to compensate for lack of other food). Nothing much odd otherwise; commotion downriver, more food than usual is available so that's a preferred place to be. It's not vegetables but we don't quite know what it means by that, but take note anyway. Riglan thanks the fish and thanks the familiar, dismissing it.

We exit the hills, onto the plains. We're expecting the wind to start cutting across but surprisingly its direction keeps constant (D8: 8). The river straightens here too which helps. It's a beautiful day - a few high, white clouds else clear. A little colder than yesterday - the clear night let heat escape perhaps. Riglan: Perception 19+8. Temo wants to "play captain" & pulls out the spyglass, through which Riglan sees in the distance a reasonably large caravan of around 6-7 horses on a road to his right - the exit of the river track from the hills - heading North. Carts look laden, as if they're bringing food or similar northwards. Unusual to be on that road rather than the main Westbridge-Triboar route. They're about 2 miles away. Riglan ties a note to a fey bird to tell them to be on their guard for monsters & maybe not stop until the tributary that flows from the West.

There are a couple of boats downriver with sails out too. Too far away to make out details. The sails are painted - one is greenish with red stripes or a pattern of some kind, the other a faded off-blue. Most of the boats yesterday did not have painted sales but a few did, so we're not immediately alarmed.

Later on, the wind does swing around a bit more (D8: 7), coming off the Sword Mountains perhaps. Slower going. We plan to stop a bit sooner having got caught out a bit late last night, but we think we can make it under Stone Bridge, which is in sight already, and just about find camp before darkness this time. Since there's no worry about being very close to a track/road here, we stay on the right hand (Western) side of the river. Survival 6+8. We find the hills here surprisingly familiar, actually. We pull into an eddy and pull in near some bushes and trees that let us hide the boat pretty well. We are able to worry less about camping next to it as a result, so climb up a little to find an area tucked up against the hillside with some natural shelter - rock outcrops - which also provide a place to light a fire that won't be visible from the river. It does mean that whoever is on watch needs to sit atop the "ridge" of sorts between fire and river.

Riglan hunts and despite the failing light is able to find a couple of rabbits. Between that and some cheese we have left, we don't need rations; Riglan can easily enough find some green things that go with it.

Same watch order. Maireagh: 19, Nethza: 13, Temo: 16, Riglan: 20+8; thank heavens for perception advantage from the dog!

Oh Riglan's watch, he notices a low light camp fire just slightly downriver. It's died down a bit but he can see it. Spyglass: A couple of silhouettes against the fire. No features visible. At least three tents, maybe more are pitched around it. It's quite close to the river's edge. Lucky we didn't run into them; they'd see our fire if they had the right vantage point, but they don't have that as far as we know. It's about 5am. Riglan calls an owl to investigate and come back to report; it has to fly out to the camp around 500ft away, but can keep distance (120ft darkvision) to avoid arousing suspicion. 5 tents, 2 boats. Slightly bigger than ours. Two people on watch, one poking the fire with a stick. The is standing up and walking around. Humanoid.

Riglan decides to get closer, so he can look through the owl's eyes. He wraps his woollen cloak around him as it's dark/brown and muffles sound and sneaks over. He considers using the Drow cloak, but that needs atunement. He casts Disguise Self to become a smaller-looking Drow in black clothing, so he's well hidden. He tries to stealth up. Despite advantage, rolls 4 and 9 - the owl flies ahead; Riglan watches through its eyes sometimes so bumbles around a bit! At about half way, the two people on watch suddenly turn around having presumably heard us.

Riglan makes the owl swoop down, as if hunting, then fly out and around out of sight, back around and eventually back up behind him. He decides to cast Pass Without A Trace to get closer. Stealth, adv: 11, 1 (!) + 10, thanks to the spell. He gets within 150ft of the camp; edges a bit closer, gets the owl to the edge of his spell's range & watches through it (owl stealth: 16+3+10).

He sees a stack of crates. One of the guards is now playing with a dagger, leaning against the crates; seems very bored. The crates look as if they have trade marks on them but can't easily be made out. There's some kind of tarp covering a few. The boats are more obviously cargo now; barrels and very large sacks are on them. The barrels are open-topped. Riglan gets the owl to fly "the long way around" to fly in and get a closer look. The barrel is full of fruit; there are maybe 5 others or so, mostly covered by a tarp. Owl back to tree. Riglan overhears one guard asking the other to throw him something - the one with the dagger levers open one of the crates, reaches in and pulls out a pineapple, throwing it to the other guard. Unfortunately Riglan can't make out any recognisable logos/branding or anything (perception only 5+8). He does note that only one of the two boats is laden. The other is a thinner design, looks laden with weapons; guard duty perhaps. The cargo boat has a motif that looks like rows of hills on the side, or perhaps waves; on the prow, a sun. Hard to tell in black and white and in the the dark.

Riglan asks the owl to alert him if this group starts to move; he heads back to his camp to finish watch.

## DAY 88

Nethza is the first up, then Temo and Maireagh. They're quite loud at first, but he tells them to keep it quiet! He warns them of the nearby group - but then the owl comes back and tells him that the camp there is packing. So, we leave our camp as-is and head over. We try to be stealthy to start with, so Temo goes ahead to scope it out. Temo: Stealth 7+11. Perception: 6+2. He estimates 8-9 people, not the best count. They're loading the crates onto the otherwise-empty boat. The "not-cargo" boat is dark brown with no obvious markings; the sail is brownish too. The cargo boat has a rolled up greenish sail and is painted green with the presumably-is-actually-hill motif with layers of yellows and oranges above as if a sunrise, to the bright yellow front sunburst.

Temo: History 11+3. One of the boats (green/yellow) is the same as we saw through the spyglass. The other is not. Temo runs back to us as we're cautiously still moving forward. Indicates that the brown boat *might* be bad guys, since it was not accompanying the green boat yesterday and they're loading some of the blue boat cargo onto it. Seems odd to be moving cargo between boats in the middle of the day.

We continue to approach, but now with caution. We keep trying for stealth for now. Lowest is Maireagh at 6 - clankclankclank!- Riglan 14, Nethza 18, Temo 19. Riglan: Perception 7+8. He recognises 3 people in leather armour, two of them from the night before. Others are wearing a different kind of armour and weapons; one has ornate robes - blueish-green water motif, directing others who are pushing along a couple of people with hands bound. The robes are familiar from the encounter at Scarlet Moon Keep. He has a metal staff.

9 people - 3 in leather armour; 3 wearing slightly different, more decorated uniform; 2 others with longbows in armour; 1 mage/priest/whatever in robes; 3 captives.

Our stealth is good, Nethza gets her armour spell and Riglan gets in a Call Lightning to hit the mage and two near the captives for 3d10->16, but they hear him casting - roll initiative. Nethza 3, Maireagh 22, Temo 25, Riglan 14.

Temo decides to try his bag of tricks - but pulls a badger (!) with 3 hit points. Even so, he sends it over to a nearby longbow scout and it harries him; Temo runs as far forward as he can and *just* at the edge of his range, scrapes a hit with advantage (5+9 attack). Manages a great damage roll and gets 30 damage, so he kills the scout outright!

Maireagh runs alongside and casts web into the midst of the camp. Three are entangled. The dog dashes up to the remaining longbow scout. One of the plain leather armour guys takes a shot at Temo with a crossbow but misses. One of the stuck guards tries to get free of the web but fails.

The mage, who didn't get trapped by the web, pulls free onto clear ground; he clearly sees Temo and Maireagh, who are in full view as they run forward, with Riglan and Nethza still a distance away in the trees and bushes. He raises his staff and chants some spell, throwing a sleet storm down. The spell's range is so great that it also comes down top of everyone in the party. Problem.

Another one of the stuck guards does free itself but can't see through the sleet storm so is actually confused and runs towards the fallen longbow scout rather than trying an attack on our party. A guard attacks the dog but misses; the remaining longbow scout steps back to try and attack with its bow (allowing the dog an opportunity attack that hits for 9) and fires two bolts, one hitting for 6 damage. A uniformed guard that was in the web area but not trapped makes it outside, then runs up to the dog itself but doesn't have time for an attack.

In the sleet storm, Riglan is basically screwed; falls over, just about holds onto his spell but can't use it (can't see), can't misty step (can't see), can't move far (difficult terrain), can't judge direction (can't see). Between getting up and moving max range in the direction he was already facing, he inches "four squares on the map" and has *at least* two more rounds of combat before he even gets out of the effect and might be able to think about doing something. If only he'd remembered that he *does have* Dispel Magic in his head...

Another guard fails to get out of the web. Nethza doesn't fall over in the storm, but can't get to the edge either. Temo makes it out, just, and manages to take down one of the nearby guards trapped in the web (but doesn't think to use magic missile on the mage); he doesn't have time to shout instructions to his badger, which hides behind the dead scout.

Maireagh stays on her feet and holds her web spell. She uses her full movement to run forwards and emerges from the spell right next to the dog; she gets it to attack and it just scrapes in a hit, taking down a previously injured enemy. Now it's the turn of the crossbow guy who attacked Temo last time - he fires again, more accurate this time, misses all the same. The remaining guard that was attacking the dog now moves around, seeing Maireagh there, trying to attack her; the dog distracts him, causing a missed attempt. Now the caster throws a spell at Temo - an ice knife comes his way. Nasty! Recognises it from Riglan's play book and this gives him time to react; both the knife and its shards cause him no injury.

The guard that was checking the dead scout now finally gets with the programme, running up to Temo with scimitar drawn. Temo's already squirming around to avoid the ice knife and the scimitar misses, but he's so busy doing this that he doesn't have time to react to help Maireagh who's hit by one of two bolts shot by the remaining crossbow scout. The last webbed guard gets free.

Riglan finally gets a clue and blows his L4 Dispel Magic to get rid of the sleet storm (Arcana 8-1 so he doesn't know if needs to be that high level, so just does the most powerful thing he can to try and guarantee success - which works). He moves a little to get a clearer view of what's going on. Nethza is also freed by this; she can now see too. She throws an eldritch curse which Riglan realises is actually visible, as he sees it streak across the battlefield; it hits the mage and it seems to do serious harm (26 psychic damage and incapacitated for a turn). Running forward, she also puts her hex blade curst on the mage too.

Temo disengages and runs next to Nethza; he tries to help Maireagh out with the guard near her, but he misses (only a 3 + 9). Maireagh next swings and crits on the first hit, though misses on the second; the dog then hits as well; but the guy is still up.

Mr Crossbow now tries to hit Nethza. He does, just! Only 6 damage.

Another guard runs up to Maireagh but doesn't hit. The guard that had been harrying Temo runs up and tries again, right in front of Nethza. Still can't get a hit (15 vs AC of 17). Longbow scout sees that and joins in - both longbow bolts hit; he dodges the first and takes 9 damage total. Riglan sees the longbow and mage side by side so hits with lightning; this takes down the longbow (fails save, 19) but the mage dodges (which makes sense, he was trying to fight weather with weather himself; this magic isn't alien to him) taking 9. Almost down - but not quite. Nethza really wants to finish that job, so she moves away (opportunity attack from the guy who ran up next to her in order to attack Temo - misses); she throws two Eldritch Blasts at the mage; one misses, one crits for 17. Mage down. She moves back in to harry the guy on Temo.

Temo disengages and attacks - hits (14+9), a whopping 31 damage; takes that guard down. His damage rolls this combat have been extremely high throughout.

Maireagh swings twice once again at one of her aggressors, hitting with one of the two attacks and taking that guard down. The dog attacks the other one that's next to her, for 8; it's looking quite rough. A fair way over camp, one almost-overlooked soldier now runs for his boat (while another tries to hit Maireagh but fails); Riglan calls lightning down on the boat guy for 21, it fails its save and 21 is enough to take it down. The boat is at risk of drifting away as the attempted-escaper had been pushing it into the water. Maireagh finishes the job with that one last guard.

Nethza runs over to free the captives, untying them and checking that they're OK. Riglan checks that Maireagh and the dog are OK; they're fine and start investigating the camp. Temo investigates the bodies, starting with the mage. Riglan then makes sure that one boat doesn't sail off, then he'll talk to the captives.

Temo: Investigation 17+9, and Maireagh: total 19. Temo realises that the spellcaster is a priest, not a mage; priestly vestments and a holy symbol made of steel, shaped like an X but with the bottom part closed off. He recognises it from the "fourth tattoo" on the Drow at Irrasil. He has a pouch of beads, which he senses are faintly magical. Everything else is very "of the iconography" of the water cult, it seems; colours are similar to the other three that were more uniformed rather than armoured. It's strange that they had wooden shields that have a vague boat-like shape, but no armour. They just have these uniform-like robes. They do have, it turns out, a couple of very slender steel-tipped wooden javelins each and jagged, shark teeth-like swords.

The longbow holders are dressed rather more traditionally, like archers and scouts. No markings, unlike the priest and the three "warriors"/stabby people. Likewise, the other three bandits in leather armour (including the crossbow guy) have no markings in general, but some motifs/colours on their bracers; and we find on them some more of the metal symbols. Perhaps there is a mix of bandits for hire working with the cultists; who knows, since chaos is on the rise generally.

Riglan and Nethza ask the ex-captives about their experience. They say that they were two boats originally, two goods barges full of food, that had reached the docks at Goldenfields. They were bringing it to Yartar. We learn that the blue-sailed ship was unfortunately sunk - they put up a fight but didn't make it. The barges were travelling together with guards on board as the river troubles are by now well known. They have to pull up on shore to rest at night when going upstream, but the guards were all on one ship while actually on the water - they expected an attack while camping, not afloat - but learned that these people were proficient at ship to ship combat. Grappling hooks and so-on.

This all happened quite far North, not far from where we are - this end of the Sumber Hills, not at Riverguard. The battle was upstream from where we are; they drifted down and the bandits came into shore at the camp we eventually saw. The captives were told they'd be taken somewhere and put to work.

They'll be able to take the boat up from here, with almost all of the cargo. They take just one tent as they've lost quite a few people. They'll probably have to travel slowly and carefully up, but we'll keep an eye on their tail. They say they'll actually try and get help from Beliard. The road is busy and well-patrolled. Perhaps they'll get a horse or mule and have it pull the barge from the track along that way.

They head off. We come up with a plan:

* Take the water cult boat down to their keep with left over crates
* There are 5; we empty one into the bag of holding so the dog can go in it
* We take 2 sets of the stabby people robes for Nethza and Maireagh, hoods up, Maireagh rowing so she's sat down to hide height
* Riglan will dress as the priest and can use Disguise Self on top of that
* Temo hides and will use a silent image of the 3rd warrior stabby guy, plus minor illusion for speech
* We'll try to get to the docks in the guise of unloading the crates and make it up from there
* We pack up the camp, bury the bodies to hide evidence without smoke, pack up our own camp and do our best to pull our boat up further and hide it well.

It's mid-ish morning, maybe 9am. Anyway, time to go to Riverguard Keep with the bad guys' boat. Probably a full day away even downstream. Chances are we'll encounter more cultists; will be a good test of the disguise. Temo will keep watch downriver with the spyglass, but first needs to figure out how to use the sails. Intelligence-based insight: 20+3! He gets lucky; the rigging is a bit bigger but basically the same as our own boat.

Wind: D8->4, so in the end the sails aren't so useful so we row. It's a wide boat, so one oar each, meaning Riglan has to match Maireagh's stroke length all the more carefully. For a while, he struggles in the first section (Marieagh Athl. good, Riglan only 2+6). In the end she offers the oars to just Riglan since he's very tall; when he needs to rest, Temo and Nethza coordinate and they're weaker but work together reasonably well with Maireagh steering.

Temo focuses his attention on watching downstream with the spyglass (perception 13+2). A large boat/ship, with large sail, is spotted soon enough, sailing downstream also. Nondescript sail, milky white, quite clean; white/blue painted hull. Looks like it has a cabin on deck.

It's a little warmer today, drier, moderate breeze. With the wind pushing upstream, the big ship downstream struggles. We're catching up slowly; about 2 miles between us. We figure we'll reassess at 1 mile. That afternoon, the wind shifts a bit but is still head-on (D8->6). Sails remain furled. We swap around; Temo and Nethza row. Riglan on spyglass.

Riglan perception: only 2+8, but at least we're getting closer to that big ship. Riglan calls a hawk as it blocks the view further downriver; for the next 3 hours the hawk doesn't see anything alarming.

It reaches around 5pm. Riglan: Survival 18+8. He starts to see familiar things in the landscape. We're actually quite a way off Riverguard Keep; in fact, probably nearer the monastery. He sees what's probably the valley in which it lies via spyglass. We decide to drift from here, to rest in advance of what lies ahead.

It starts to go dark, so Temo puts on the goggles & Rigan casts Darkvision. We keep tight to the rightmost bank for visibility. We use lanterns too as we're not trying to hide the boat and it'd be suspicious to arrive fully dark.

We get close and look out for the dock entrance. The disguises go up; Temo on cantrip for the 3rd guard; Riglan Disguise Self as the priest.

Riglan: Perception 14+8. We see the keep, under repair; an old castle overlooking the river. A tower close to us juts out from a rocky cliff; a tall wall rises above, extending over the water. There's a portcullis at where it meets the river. A much taller tower runs down to the banks and is partly based in the water. They both peak to the same height, just different starting points. The wall runs between them.

Secondary check for dim light: Perception 11+8. There is movement atop the wall; at least two figures guard on patrol. Then the gate opens and a boat, maybe 40ft long, emerges. It sails downriver. The open portcullis is maybe 500ft away. As we get close, Riglan waves the lantern as if to signal. 

Deception rolls: Riglan with adv. only 13-1; Temo using int. modifier: 13+3. Nethza and Maireagh both roll natural 2s => Nethza 2+4, Maireagh 2-3 -> -1! Maireagh has decided to "avast, ahoy, lower the gates m'lad" at the guards; Nethza joined in... Oh dear. They ask who we are and Riglan tries to bluff in using the priest's voice, "can't you see we've been attacked? Let in you fools" - rolls 11-1 deception; they ask who we are; he puts the lamp by his face "It's me!" - one of the guards recognises him and the portcullis is re-raised. Riglan can't tell how that's done.

As we get in, we see crumbled walls. The portcullis is less solid than we thought; it could probably be battered through. The wall has big gaps around the base too; it's very run down. They do have guards atop though.

Inside the wall are several buildings. It's not a cavern; it's open to the sky. Perception Riglan disadv., 11, 14 + 8 -> 19. There's a strong current of water here, which appears to flow *into* the keep; tugging at the boat. In the distance we can just make out another opening in a distant cliff face, the water flowing into it.  Not far off, a couple of boats are moored to a very basic landing with stairs leading up; on the other side, a much larger boat with two decks is parked up on a more substantial formal dock.

Above the small dock is some kind of courtyard leading to maybe a chapel. Two more towers distant, but one much bigger; perhaps a house or rooms inside; three storeys high. The walls joining things are about two storeys. The chapel and other buildings are about 1-2 stories.

We aim for the small landing. Someone comes to help tie the boat. "Oh! What happened to you?" "Bigger guard than expected. Had to sink the ships but got the crates." He asks if we want to go to our quarters or unload into the keep first. We say keep and he releases the ropes, so we figure we have to follow underground as we realise the river flows under the keep there.

So under we go. The current is largely created because the river is being squeezed into a narrow channel, rather than because of e.g. some waterfall, rapids or drop. It opens into a cave, with four boats along a long landing up against an artificial shore of sorts that services as a dock. Small torches provide some light; there is a doorway. The river carries on after the landing, this cave really being part of a longer river tunnel that looks like it might widen again further in. Riglan, survival 19+8: This is clearly not a small stream, it's a full underground river.

There's a moment of quiet - Riglan gives Temo the elvenkind boots and Temo hides (stealth adv. 14, 18+11). Riglan stands up front to shield Nethza and Maireagh a bit - Maireagh has the dog crate. Nethza ties the boat. The guy comes along. He goes and gets some crates himself and tells us dinner is probably finished; he takes a crate up past the doorway and up. We can see him in the direction of what we think is a store room. While he's there, we sneak up and go the other way. A side door on the side of the keep - servant's entrance. We look out over a rubble-strewn courtyard with building materials and construction. It's now clearly a chapel that is on the left; the other side, barracks and mess hall. Run-down stables beyond with no horses.

Temo investigates (4+9), can't see too much. He finds a main doorway to the keep along with some stairs leading up the side up onto the wall.

Maybe we can hide in the stables briefly? Riglan: Perception 9+8. Misc stores in the stalls, one with a few animals; one at the very end has rubble and straw but nothing else. We hide in there for a moment. Riglan calls the fey spider and sends it back in and towards the store room along the corridor ceiling. See where it leads and what's there. It's too far to keep "in range" at any distance but it can watch the corridor to see where the crate guy is at.

After a while he does not reemerge for any more crates, so we advance forward back through the servant's door to a (relatively) safe space and while the others keep an eye out, Riglan looks through the spider & gets under the door and into a store room. It's maybe roughly 30ft x 30ft ish, full of crates and other things and no people. Spider perception total 13, 60-80 crates very roughly - 3-4 large boat loads full. From the roof, there are stairs leading up on the other side of the room. The spider follows up and reaches a small landing and a closed door. So at least we know how to get up into this keep. Just within range, the spider can get under that door too. Light on the other side - a well lit hallway, two doors left and right, and carrying on ahead. It opens up to a larger space ahead. Peek under the left door. Nobody there; some benches and stools; more food; shelving with pots and pans. Kitchen and larder/pantry. Now to the other side - under the rightmost door. Stealth (spider) 11+4, it's OK. About 7 people here. Small bundles of clothing, rags; some sleeping arrangements; low light. The people here look sad and raggedy; tired, not well fed. Not chained, though. Women, teenagers and older men, but no men of fighting age. The room is self-contained; just two small windows.

Back into the hallway; ceiling; along to the open area; ceiling ends & the spider is now up on a wall, looking up. Heraldry, but rotting; grand things that adorn the wall, but very old. It's lit by an askew hanging chandelier. Large long tables. A throne-like area. Feels like a great hall / dining hall. Two storeys high.Either side of the entrance the spider came through, stone stairs lead up one storey. There are a few people here and someone sat on the throne looking bored. A couple of teenage boys are trying to clean up and are being harassed; a kind of viking feel; this leads Riglan to think that maybe the other room was other servants.

The spider heads up the right hand stairs and eventually gets to the third floor. More rooms. One is a store room with assorted boxes and crates. General store, rather than food. Another room - a small sleeping area. Four tired people here, young/middle aged and under fed. Last room; one bed, two people. One sat on the bed, one at a table carving something. Leather armour. Rack of weapons near the door. Looks like it can accommodate more people. Maybe 10.

The spider heads out back towards the above-hall stairs and is on the wall as it sees the king guy walking across the hall. There are still the four people harassing the two servers below. The king guy is going onto the other stairs; spider follows at a distance. Spider stealth 15+4, doesn't get spotted. We reach level 3, which has a landing and kind of an internal balcony. He goes to the room at the end. Other rooms to left and right. Left: small, bunk beds, someone sat on a bed and someone lying down. Upper bunks empty, two people sat sparring with daggers. Not the downtrodden type. Weapons rack nearby. Right room: Larger, dark, very large desk in the middle, small bureau against one wall. Bookshelf lining all of one wall. Scroll cases here and there. Open books and sheets of paper on the table; maybe a map.

Spider now creeps *just* under the door of the king's room. Stealth 10+4. Seems good enough; spider is not seen. King guy is leaning over a desk against the wall & starts writing. Nobody else here. Spider heads back out to the great hall. Only two fighters remain.

Riglan thanks the spider & leaves it there for a moment. He comes back to his senses to find **Temo drawing a moustache on his face with a pen. Hmm**.

RIglan talks to his party for a while, coming up with odd ideas for plans. He checks in with the spider. The two who were left downstairs are headed up. The main keep doors open and someone in robes comes in. Not the same style as the priest before. The spider sneakily creeps around a corner to see where the mage person is going. It pauses by the library door, turns into a water form and flows underneath!

Plan:

- get upstairs
- use totem to guide animal conjure to get crocodiles to attack king
- marieagh webs the corridor and maybe stairs to slow down any guards
- deal with water guy as best we can (hence crocodiles) -- ABANDONED WHEN MAP DRAWN - 5ft WIDE 25ft LONG CORRIDOR ONLY JUST FITS PARTY OF 5 ON EVERY SQUARE ANYWAY
- fighty fighty and try to clean out the keep first, to see if we can at least get a safehouse of sorts for these captured people
- then move on to see what else we need to clear out so they are free and so that some supplies might be recovered
- investigate library in particular for plans etc
- see if there are any underground-leading passages etc. c.f monastery, or maybe we just follow the big river if we can't find anything else
- don't leave main area until we've tried to free these captives
- **always try to encourage people to see sense and not fight to death but instead just aid and seek redemption at Yartar**.

We reckon it's 11pm now.

We go down to the store. Temo unlocks it easily (SOHand, 15+11). Most crates in there have already been opened and presumed check. Many are fruit, others are large things like gourds or pumpkins; many sacks of grain and so-on. The exit door is opened quietly by Temo (stealth 9+11). Coast is clear, he signals, so we are about to come up. At that point a head pops out of the kitchen - one of the teenagers from before. Temo manages to persuade him (13+10) to chat in the kitchen. He's unsure until Riglan lets him "feel" where his head really is - he looks shorter - it's a magical disguise. We learn that the "king" is Captain Jolliver Grimjaw. They're afraid, with their men taken "down below" - he indicates the way we came, so perhaps that underground river. Dozens have been taken. Pretty much everyone here is bad, particularly Sholear, captain of the big ship we saw in dock. The others are mostly bandits, many hired. Bugbears in a tower too. Droznin - priest; Reash - in her tower. The one we saw turn into water - Urshnora - very nasty. Reash is the same deal & they don't get along! Riglan, insight 15+5: The kid is really opening up from some pretty basic prompting; he's weak, but he's smart and calculating - honest tho - but is omitting somethings. He's in survival mode.

He does tell us one last thing - Jolliver is a wereboar! "Don't let him bite you!"

We sneak into the hall and up the stairs. It helps that the keep is dwarven stone; no creaking wood. Group stealth roll just gets by - Riglan despite no boots of elvenkind, on loan to Temo, rolling nat 19. Really only Maireagh is clattering around a bit. We get up to the corridor on the top floor, with the guard room and library left and right, then ahead at the end, the king's room. Riglan realises that having spent so long with the spider before visiting this area, he'd lost his sense of scale and it's actually quite tight - 5ft wide, maybe 25ft long, barely enough to fit the party in. Fitting in one end with the other webbed isn't an option, nor really is range attack or keeping away from a wereboar.

Riglan keeps just around the corner, Temo at the end waiting for a shot at the king if he arrives. Maireagh takes the guard room door, Nethza the library door. Riglan uses the spider to see into Jolliver's room & pulls in the crocodiles. All four hit and he's grappled. Nethza has to smash the door into the library and runs in towards the mage there. This alerts the guard room; a door opens and an angry guard attacks Maireagh with a longsword, with one hit, but Maireagh throws up a magical shield. The guard starts yelling, "To arms! To arms" and banging. Sigh. Another tries to shove Maireagh out of the way, but fails; then tries to grapple, but doesn't manage to. She retaliates by trying to push back, but even with advantage on the contested strength check she can't make it happen. She tries again! This time it works, pushing the guard back and giving her room to get inside and have the dog guard the door.

Jolliver can't reach his maul - so instead shapeshifts into a hybrid wereboar form. He escapes the grapple, but that's all he can do for now.

Maireagh is in amongst four guards. One crits! Not too bad damage fortunately.

Riglan tries going in to help Netzha. He sees the mage, with aqua green/blue and  white robes with a serpentine motif. He tries a flame cantrip and surprisingly it seems to work, at least while she's human-looking. He steps back out of the way. Temo tries to take a shot at guards through the door at an angle but misses.

Now the mage transforms, turning into what seems to be a serpent made of water - and hexes Nethza. Despite Nethza having brought up Spirit Shroud to slow it, it's easily able to flow *through* a table and get beside her.

A fourth guard attacks Maireagh; she brings up shield again since she's surrounded. Both attacks *just* miss as a result. The crocodiles are going again; all four get hits, so Jolliver is grappled again. One crits but damage (d10+2) is only 2+2+2.

Netzha attacks the water serpent with the Lightbringer mace. Two attacks. One miss, one crit. Between the alright damage from the mace plus the shroud, it's a decent 23 damage dealt.

More attacks on Maireagh. The first guard misses, thanks to dog and shield. Meanwhile, Riglan (perception 11+8) hears distant footsteps and shouts out a warning - more people are coming. More misses on Maireagh; good shield use. Now it's her turn. She gets the dog to step back (opp. attack from guard triggered; misses) and then casts a new thing, Swordburst. All four fail dex saves! 2d6 damage, 7 total (but that's 7x4 overall). She looks around and notices that they don't seem to be hurt much... She calls and asks if we can help!

Jolliver decides to try and hit the grappling crocodile; with only AC12 it's not hard and he gets 13 damage on the first attack, con save 14 and not paralysed. Second attack misses tho. Jolliver remains grappled. We all hear him roaring and stomping, presumably to expedite aid that we already hear is on its way. Time is of the essence.

Maireagh is about to get hit yet again and, since she's surrounded, brings up yet another shield. Meanwhile Riglan prepares his new Wither & Bloom spell knowing that the mage is about to attack Nethza, waiting for his moment. Temo once again tries to shoot inside the door but misses (rolls 4).

The serpent changes colour, an inky, putrid look; it swings forward at Nethza to try and encircle her. It does hit (3d6 necrotic; 10 rolled). She still has temp HP so it's not quite what Riglan had in mind but as soon as he sees the damage, he triggers his spell, for 8 necrotic damage (failed save).

More attacks on the shielded Maireagh; then the crocodiles are up. Again, all four hit, one critting for 11 damage; the last one bites only for 3, and this brings down Jolliver but he resists somehow - some kind of death ward (technically: Relentless).

Nethza attacks twice again with the mace. Crit, but awful damage! 3x1s. Only 12. Second hits for - more 1s! - only 10. Serpent is still up, albeit badly injured. She now uses the hexblade curse in return (if she'd done it sooner she'd have a bonus action thing she could've done that might have finished off the mage, but just didn't remember).

More hits on Maireagh, unfortunately one crit so it does hit but only for 8 damage. (Riglan can now hear footsteps in the main hall). Two more misses on Maireagh thanks to shield. Maireagh retaliates, now with the longsword - one at a time it is. Hits twice. 19 damage total. Dog attacks another and (just) hits for 7, then climbs around onto a bed but does get hit by an opp attack, taking 5 damage. It can help Maireagh better inside and gives Temo a clearer line of sight by moving out of the doorway.

Jolliver continues to attack; escapes his grapple and does hit the grappling creature again for 8, but con save (nat 18) is fine.

One final attack from guards this round, which, shield now down, hits her for 9. The second attack misses with the dog helping with disadvantage.

Riglan tries to hit the serpent with flame. It does hit but seems to do less damage (half damage) - takes down the serpent. It reverts to human form. He rushes out into the corridor.

Temo runs into the corridor and tries another shot. ANOTHER miss, nat 5. He stows his crossbow and, intending to go to melee, steps into the room, disengaging to prevent attack and jumps back onto a nearby bed to help draw fire from Maireagh (acro 15+8) and moves to flank a guard.

More attacks on Maireagh. One would hit, but silvery barbs from Temo stops it (Maireagh gets advantage). Second also hits for 10 damage.

The first crocodile takes down Jolliver. One nearest the door moves next. The other three manage to fail to bash down the door until the last one, but it's unable to move further. Riglan sees it in the doorway and shouts, "Ah! The crocodiles are coming to help!". Nethza emerges from the library and can just about see into the guard room, so throws some eldritch blasts. The target has cover, but both manage to hit for 17 total. 

People emerge on the stairs near Riglan. "They're heeeere!". In the lead is a guard holding a shield and jagged shark-toothed longsword. It doesn't seem to be wearing armour.

The guard Nethza attacked moves out into the corridor (Maireagh holding her reaction back) and attacks her, but misses on both swipes. Another guard back in the room tries to move away; Temo's used his reaction earlier, so can't do much but the dog does get an opp attack, but misses; but the guard's own attacks don't land either.

Maireagh gets in a hit thanks to Temo's spell advantage from earlier. 10 damage dealt. Second attack hits for 11 too. The dog's turn - just misses. The guard responds, hitting Maireagh as she's flanked but *now* Maireagh uses her last shield, which deflects that and the next hit too.

Riglan retreats into the library to keep the corridor free, calling his crocodiles; he warns his party again that people are coming; he has to use his action to avoid opportunity attacks from the guard engaged with Nethza.

Temo jumps forward, attacks the guy flanking Maireagh and hits but poor damage roll on 5d6+5 for 20 total, then disengages and backflips back onto the bed to create some space again. Acro 15+8. One in the corner runs forward and tries to hit Temo. First hit misses, second hits for 8 damage.

The crocodiles are squished in the room; one makes it out and attacks the guard on Nethza, but gets 11+4 -> 15 so doesn't get a hit, but it flanks the guard so Nethza gets advantage and this yields a hit on her attack for 12 and, again, a second attack due to advantage for 13. She moves sideways into the library, standing in the doorway in front of Riglan. (We're treating diagonals into doorways in this as cover in this case, so triggers an opp attack but it doesn't hit).

The one on the stairs ran up and tried to attack Nethza but missed. The guard she'd been attacking turns around and gets two hits on the crocodile, for 20 total, which isn't quite enough to bring it down but it's hurt. The guard now moves out of the way and the croc's opp attack misses. Another guy runs up the stairs into view behind the first; others behind. We realise they're from the other side of the keep, which is how they got here so quickly.

Back in the guard room, more attacks on Maireagh miss. She retaliates against an injured guard, taking one down in her first attack with 9 damage; now turns to face the one Temo's flanking on the bed and gets a hit there due to advantage for 7. The dog tries for the same guy and does hit for a good roll of 10 damage.

Riglan tries to throw flame through the doorway, hitting a guard for an average roll of 8 damage. It seems to have no fire resistance. He shouts to encourage his crocodiles.

Temo attacks the guy in front, but shit rolls yet again, despite advantage 4,7 so misses (AC 17). FFS. Getting really annoying. At least the retaliatory attacks by the guard miss. The crocodiles shuffle around a bit; one tries to attack but narrow space disadvantage -> 19, 3 -> miss.

Nethza tries to attack but has trouble (rolls 1, 4!) and misses both; it retaliates and gets a hit. It only does 3 damage and she realises that her armour is helping a lot by negating effects that the jagged sawtooth might otherwise have had. She makes her con save to hold the spirit shroud.

A guard tries for Maireagh, missing; another crits but Temo casts Silvery Barbs (adv. to Maireagh) and the distraction causes a miss; the guard's second attack misses too. Maireagh turns and retaliates. Hits thanks to advantage for 9, taking that guard down. Then she goes again for the one Temo flanks, with advantage there, getting a crit! Big damage too, 21 (8 & 7 on the D8s). The dog tries its luck on the same guy and hits, for 11! Max roll. STILL doesn't take it down.

Riglan gets in another fire hit on the new guard that was challenging Nethza, for 11 damage (good roll). Temo attacks and hits finally, on the very injured guard - for a rather pointless high damage roll of 28. It's down.

Croc manages to get a hit onto the guy on Nethza, 11, 13 roll, so 11+4 -> 15, hits the un-armoured character and 8 damage takes it down. Starts eating! Clears the space & Nethza moves into it to start to attack down the corridor. First misses (nat 1) but second hits for 11 damage. That lower level guard tries to attack but misses. One around the corner tries to attack with in effect cover, but can't get even close to Nethza's AC.

A remaining guard in the guard room with Maireagh stands its ground and attacks but misses both times. Maireagh retaliates and gets in one hit for 10 damage. She tells the dog to start pulling bodies out of the way of the crowded and rather macabre room. Riglan now moves and gets an angle through the door on the stairwell and hits one for 8 damage. Temo runs around to try and get the last guard, but AGAIN an awful roll (4) and misses. The crocs can't do much as everything is blocked; one eats a nearby dead guard. Netzha finishes off the lower level guard in front and runs forward, swinging at the next but missing; it misses in retaliation too.

Back in the guard room, the last guard has a go at Temo but can't hit the slippery halfling, bouncing around on a bed... Meanwhile on the stairwell, javelins start getting thrown but they're throwing over the heads of their comrades and miss... Maireagh finally takes down the remaining guard with a critical hit. She runs out behind Nethza and the dog runs through into the library.

Riglan can't do much but can heal; L1 Healing Word for Maireagh, for 11. Temo is a bit stuck, so stows his sword, disengages and runs through everyone's legs (well, pushes past Maireagh) and down the stairs, skidding to a halt a short distance from the tail of the queue of bad guys.

Crocodiles - nothing...

Nethza attacks the next guard on the stairs in front, hitting twice for 18 damage (including spirit shroud) which doesn't quite take it down. Her second attack does the job. It retaliates and tries to hit but can't get to her AC. Another on the stairs throws a javelin this time at Temo but misses wildly (rolls 1).

Maireagh is at a short distance away, so gets creative with Thorn Whip. It does manage to hit the creature in front of Nethza and she yanks it past and through (Nethza's buffeted, "Oi, watch out with that! Ha!") so that the bad guy is between her and Nethza; the dog gets in and does 7 damage.

The guard at the tail of the stairs runs in an attacks Temo but misses. Riglan meanwhile can see the character Maireagh pulled in and takes it down with a thrown flame. Down the stairs, Temo is in melee again, but this time goes for Magic Missile, hitting for 11 damage. He stands his ground, clutching the wand.

Crocodiles - nothing... The lead is being well fed, eating the guard that everyone just taken down, partially cooked thanks to Riglan. Nethza runs down and attacks the guard twice, hitting both times for 12 and 13, taking down the guard. She runs down to flank the guard on Temo. Maireagh runs in after. Temo's now attacked, but the guard once again misses. 

Temo pulls his sword and attacks with advantage thanks to Nethza and Maireagh. He *just* makes the hit, for 22, and takes down the last guard.

Riglan sends the crocs down; two will stand just inside the great hall door, one blocking the hallway up from down below and one just milling around. Now we take some time to investigate and clean up. Temo starts in the Jolliver's room. Maireagh heads to the library. 

Temo: Investigation 17 total. Grimjaw's still in hybrid form. Riglan thinks he's definitely dead; medicine 9+5, 14 total. Riglan ties the hands and feet just in case!

* On Jolliver, a large rusty iron key around his neck
* The water cult emblem, made of coral; not magical but presumed cult significance
* In a chest, there's treasure! Equivalent of 160gp, 450el, 600sp

Riglan checks some letters on the desk. It amounts to various reports; log books writing down numbers, weights, crates and so-on. It seems to be an account of what was taken. "Wagon load flour near B" and so-on. Looks like codes, we can't really figure out what they might mean. They aren't sequential. We take the logs anyway to pass on to authorities to try and help them redistribute stuff. There's also a report of some caravan traffic and an unsigned folded up letter with weird handwriting mixing cursive and block letters, which says "band of troublemakers, can't miss them, one 8ft, one 6, one 5, one 3 and a metal dog; take down, GAR (in capitals for whatever reason) wants them dead." It's a mystery. GAR is at least probably initials based on what we saw elsewhere, so perhaps the other letters are initials too, of people or places.

In the library, Maireagh has laid all kinds of things out but we don't find much due to another series of really bad rolls (e.g. Temo, 1 then 3). Riglan is bored so starts looking around. Perception 11+8. He notices that a book he moves has a lever, which leads to a secret door behind the bookshelf that leads to Jolliver's quarters. Had he not been pinned by the crocodiles, he could've escaped this way. Lots and lots of books! Nothing groundbreaking, normal value - maybe 25gp each - we find 10 worth selling:

* 10 books worth 25gp ea worth selling
* 2 scrolls - Temo recognises one as a scroll of Haste, the other Riglan finds is a scroll of Wall Of Water
* In a silk pouch, the mage has 6 jaspers of various colours, excellent quality
* A beautiful but small diamond worth 300gp - revivify.

Riglan has dragged the king's body down to the hall when he sees the kid emerge from a side door and look startled by the crocodile - he shouts and says "Don't worry! They're friendly! You can ride them!" and gets it to back out of the corridor so they can enter the hall. Some of the women run upstairs asking for help to unlock a door, so Temo unlocks it (dirty 20 SOHand - the guards have the key, but maybe one got eaten...) and the husbands are found there. They'd been locked in the whole time.

Everyone gets down to the hall and we discuss options. Nobody seems to be coming from down in the main area within the walls, so we decide to trust the people around us and sleep without watch. Temo's sling would alert him to sculduggery (not that the others know about it) and the dog will be on guard too. Riglan knows the crocodiles don't have much longer so wants to let them swim; he heads down to the dock area so they can go for a swim.

The plop into the water and immediately come back up - to warn us of a row of 6 undead ghouls submerged in the water. As if guarding the deeper-in entrance. But they're up for the fight! Wut?

Riglan runs back up, tells the group, runs back down with Maireagh shouting after him, "It's always another thing with you, isn't it?!" and he wildshapes into a crocodile and dives in. He'll have to hang back to start with tho, for fear of losing concentration - he can't cast spells or use his cloak totems to help.

All crocs hit and grapple, but two get paralysed by attacks in retaliation. Another ghoul attacks and hits, while the last hits Riglan but he holds concentration. The two unparalyzed crocs get more hits, as does Riglan. One ghoul is down. Another ghoul on a paralyzed croc kills the croc and is freed. More hits from ghouls, but no more paralysis. The fight goes less well from there, with a lot of paralysis; eventually Riglan has to exit the water, turn back into himself and re-cast Conjure. For fresh water, only crocs can live so again he gets the same thing. The fresh crocs take down the by-then four remaining ghouls, one very close to death anyway.

He returns to this party and explains, then they bed down. We don't set watch, taking people as true to their word.

## DAY 89

Just before 7am, we are woken. The game is afoot. It's just getting light. Riglan's experience the night before makes him decide to memorise Lesser Restoration rather than Create Or Destroy Water. We tell the servants to head upstairs and take cover. The boy from last night has found a crossbow and bolts but looks conflicted. Some of the men go for weapons too... In the end we agree that the ruse of them not knowing this was happening is over, but them fighting at the front line isn't great, so we ask them to keep quiet, keep safe upstairs and lie in wait - if we need help we'll holler.

We lie the body of the king on the table closest to the main entrance and scatter around the room in strategic areas. Temo insists on sitting on the throne! We wait. Riglan calls a hawk to outside the keep; it perches on the roof, observing. Temo finds the throne too big, so pulls from his bag of tricks - gets the weasel. It sits on his shoulder. He tries again - panther! So we've a hawk, a weasel and a panther... One more weasel and I think it might remind me of a film...

There's a changing of the guard from watch towers to barracks. As barracks people switch over, one walks towards the shrine/chapel, someone joins them from there, so 5 in front and 2 behind in the end, and they head towards the keep front door. Six look like the robes/shield/javelin type, one looks like the priest from other morning, but the six don't have shields with them. They're all heading to the doors.

Riglan conjurs animals. He almost gets giant goats but manages to coerce the spell effect a little given the space constraints, getting four giant wasps instead. We wait to attack as we hear them at the door. It's flung open, and they declare "good morning, breakfast time! Wake up you lazy - wuuuh?!"

Temo stands up on the throne - he's waited his who life to do this - "**THE KING IS DEAD! LONG LIVE THE KING!**"

There's a moment of confusion! Will they try to fight us or flee? One says - "They killed Jolli! Jolli's dead! The slaves have revolted! There's a big cow in the room! There's wasps, go run! Get help!" - rolling for initiative. Riglan and wasps very very low unfortunately (2, 5). Temo super high tho (25). He takes aim and fires at the closest person - nat 20! - 35 damage, killed instantly.

Maireagh runs up to them, just outside the keep and tries Thorn Whip but misses. The dog has a go, trying to grapple; it succeeds. The priest runs up and calls for reinforcements, then looks towards the door to see Maireagh running out and casts Hold Person. She fails, but uses her inspiration from Temorah's temple in Yartar and succeeds on the re-roll.

Three of the reavers (all had the same initiative roll, despite being rolled separately) act. One runs to get help; Maireagh gets an opp attack and hits for 11 damage. He runs off. One near the dog tries too, but the dog is grappling so can't react. The one grappled by the dog fails to escape. A fourth runs in, since he saw the priest attacking; tries to attack the dog but glances off the metal plating.

Nethza complains about people leaving and Riglan says, "well wait for them to come in!" but she says "no!" and runs to the door; she casts hex on the attacking reaver and throws eldritch blasts; hit, miss. 18 damage.

It's the wasps. The first gets a hit on the grappled guy. The second crits on the mage and does good damage; the third would hit, but the mage is now ready and throws up a shield. The fourth tries to attack and misses; but the running guy triggers two opp attacks and the fourth wasp gets its hit then (tho another misses). Riglan vaults over one table and jumps onto the next to get a view outside; he brings down the bear totem again and throws a flame at the one reaver who'd attacked, hitting and taking him down. Mage wasn't visible.

Temo runs out and continues his astonishingly awful rolls with a 4, missing the mage. The panther manages to get to the grappled guy with the dog and hits, but only for 4 damage. Maireagh runs forward and tries to get another one of the running reavers with Thorn Whip. Misses unfortunately.

The priest, with two wasps in melee, casts Blur. He then tries to run - two opp attacks but both disadv and both miss. The dog-grappled reaver manages to shake free and gets up. He's yelling! "Get them off me!" (the dog, the panther, a wasp...) - he tries to run for it. The panther swipes but misses; however, the wasp fells him. The remainder are scattering out of range in different directions and we realise we can't really stop them, so we have to regroup. Nethza has presence of mind to transfer her hex to the priest. She needs to hold back her remaining spell so tries for eldritch blast; first misses, but second, despite Blur, does find its mark for 18 damage. A wasp flies in and even at disadvantage also hits; this is enough to take down the priest, surprisingly!

The other people feeling are too far gone and we elect to regroup in the keep. A wasp notices a nearby lower guard that hasn't been fast enough to run and manages a crit! Takes it down. The others give chase hoping for opportunity attacks. Riglan shouts, "Let's fall back to the keep!" and heads back inside.

Temo thinks he has a shot, tho - firebolt. He grabs his warlock wand and goes for it. After all the terrible rolls, a very poetic crit! Damage 4d10 is only 22, kinda in the middle, and that's just enough. Temo blows the end of his wand, Western gun stylee! Maireagh isn't happy either and can just about reach the remaining runner with Thorn Whip; JUST hits (6+8) and pulls it back a little, doing 7 damage. The guard tries to run, so the wasp nearby gets an opportunity attack but misses. Unfortunately, then, he's escaped. One got away.

Temo shouts to Riglan, "hey, we should just chase them and keep people away from the keep, maybe even convince them to leave!" and sends his panther in to watch the dock passage and main door. Riglan concedes and asks the hawk to sit above the keep and fly in to alert him if anyone makes a move on it.

We give chase; the guy is headed to the barracks. Netzha tells Riglan to send the wasps behind and above her, as we're going to try and intimidate them into fleeing. She moves into the barracks and shouts - "The time has come! The king - the false king is dead! Leave your posts now or suffer the same fate as those bodies, those slavers, in the courtyard. Denounce your false teachings of your false god!" - and she throws a ray of frost at the cowering guard who had run (Temo creates a silent image of his panther snarling and drooling behind Nethza too as backup). Nethza hits; he freezes; she pulls on his spirit as a spectre. Very nasty. But at least he gets true chance of redemption, which is more than the others we had to kill. She pulls the spectre into visibility for all to see. "Renounce your false god and I shall set you free to enter the afterlife". Intimidation with adv.: 18+7 - 25! "Don't anyone *dare* pick up weapons against us."

The mercenaries are over it. The king's dead, no more money; they hastily pick up their things and retreat. This leaves 6 reavers in the room, indecisive. Temo steps forward - we all do, brandishing weapons - Temo intimidation adv. also, 17+4 - and says "It's over, your false king is dead, there's no more money, no more anything!" but the six don't leave. They're eyeing up weapons.

Nethza has a spell ready. Temo has aimed at one. Riglan has his wasps ready to fly in. Maireagh is prepared to run in and block people from reaching anyone else - she's being defensive. They reach for weapons! Nethza reacts but misses; Temo's aim is good tho, hits takes one down; Maireagh runs in super agro; and that's surprisingly enough - giant wasps hovering above - one died in a single arrow hit - they drop their weapons. They ask if we'll give them safe passage. Riglan says yes, if they immediately leave and go via the Dessarin. We follow. People are jumping into boats or out the front gates.

We know we have two significant problems left - the boat, the temple; we probably have to find some bugbears too.

We run for the big boat at the dock. We need to go up and along the parapets so we can climb down onto it. There are some pockets of resistance - guards on the walls don't know the story down below and stand their ground. They take shots at us. One manages to hit Temo for just 3 damage. Others are too far away, on the far side of the "quad" and are running round our way but they're a distance off. We get onto wall.

Nethza moves the hex and tries to take out a guard, hitting twice with Eldritch Blast - immediately taken out. Temo hits another with firebolt for 12 damage - Riglan takes the hint and throws flame, hitting for 10 damage - this takes down the other guard too, who falls over the wall and into the river. We run towards the big dock and boat. There's a wooden walkway that drops *down* slightly from dock to deck. There's someone on deck - "We've got company, boys!" - a halfling with a longsword (!) in chain mail. Someone runs on deck - "What is it, Pike? What's going on? Intruders!" - he's in leather armour with a heavy crossbow. He fires at Riglan, rolling 16 to match the AC and hit for 1d10 -> 10, but he easily makes the con save to hold his wasp spell. We see him start to reload the crossbow.

A door to a cabin at the rear bursts open - "What's the meaning of this?! Ah! I've heard about you - well you've decided to attack the wrong people today!" - the captain, we presume. Greenish-blue in colour with glistening skin. Black hair looks wet but waves around. He wears ornate pirate-captain-like clothing, but shimmers - mage armour. He holds a scimitar, but sheaths it; he looks at us and throws a acid splash in our direction. It aims for Temo and Riglan; both fail to dodge and take 5 damage; Riglan has to react with his cloak to keep his spell. The captain leaps to a bar jutting out of the mast; he's 30ft up (boat's about 50ft long, mast 60ft tall).

Riglan throws flame up - hits for 11 damage. Nethza moves the hex to the strange halfling with the longsword and throws eldritch blasts his way. Crits on the first, hits (19) on the second; 24 and 13. Wow. It's down. Temo runs onto the boat and throws a fire bolt - the mast in the way, the wand negating the cover - gets a good hit (17+7) for a not-great 9 damage. Two wasps fly up and the second flanks, and would hit but the captain throws up a shield. The other two flank the remaining deck hand; the first hits before the second arrives despite no advantage, then the second hits with flanking advantage too, doing a fair amount of damage. Maireagh tries to use Thorn Whip and gets close, but the shield blocks the attack. The dog runs up alongside.

A fourth person pops up right into the midst of the wasps! It attacks one with mace, hitting once out of its two attacks for 8 damage. The guy who'd already been hit drops his crossbow on the deck, pulls a mace and hits twice for 12.

Now the captain acts again. He jumps down, both wasps missing opp attacks. He lands on his feet and runs behind Temo, throwing a lighting bolt through the dog, Maireagh, Temo and two wasps. Temo saves (no damage due to feats). Dog fails, Maireagh fails, one wasp fails. **Total damage is 34!** Ouch. He kills his own guy even though he'd save. Both wasps are taken out.

Riglan throws fire in response, hitting for 12 damage.

Nethza transfers the hex onto the Captain (Shoalar). She hits with an eldritch blast, for 12 damage. Temo tries magic missile but he throws shield - a wasted turn, blew 3 charges too (I forgot about the shield until just after I rolled and even though I then remembered wasn't allowed to change since I'd rolled).

Maireagh and the dog attack the other guy on deck, getting some hits but not quite taking him down. It retaliates with the mace against the badly lightning-damaged dog, hitting twice for 10 damage; the dog's very low indeed. 

Another round for captain. He looks around at us scattered around the ship and bank. He pulls a spell out of the water, causing a wave of water to splash up and slam into Riglan, Nethza and one wasp. Everyone fails, taking 20 damage. Awful rolls all round mean Riglan falls into the water along with the wasp; Nethza's prone and hanging on.

Riglan misty steps up to the gangway, runs to the mast and tries to throw flame but another bad roll (2) and he misses badly. Nethza has a feat that lets her get up with a bonus action right behind him and hits once with Lightbringer for 16 damage.

Temo aims and fires. Rolls attack, 10 then 20! Gets 36 damage and takes him down. Makes up for the magic missile mistake! Maireagh takes out the last guy. Temo quickly runs through to check the rest of the ship for anyone else (investigation 15+9). There's nobody else on board. He sees a locked chest in the Captain's quarters. He digs around on the body to find a key, but finds a potion of healing instead, along with the key and 3 small malachites. The chest has about 125gp worth of coin.

There are 6 casks of ale, 4 barrels of salted fish and 12 large bundles of various animal pelts (worth about 40gp per bundle, we later estimate). No time for that now, but we'll be back!

We head around on the wall aiming for the chapel. There are two reavers inside. We try talking them out of attacking, but they draw swords. We all attack at once; Temo takes one down with a sneak attack (contested perception vs stealth failed by bad guys); Nethza and Riglan are swiped at by both but surprisingly they miss. Nethza gets in one hit in retaliation, likewise Riglan throws flame and hits; Maireagh and the dog have their turn, but one still stands. Temo fires as the last one swings at Riglan but surprisingly again misses; Temo's arrow lands true.

It's a small chapel, very spartan. Water symbols everywhere. Rusty iron chains and manacles that look like they're designed to weigh people down - drown them! A few books in a small priest's room at the back contain mostly cult ramblings, the creeping, patient assured victory of the cult of elemental water; inevitable like the rising of the tide. Wash the world clean, that kind of stuff. There is also some writing about the local power play; the two mages wrestling for influence over Jolliver Grimjaw. He claims to have weakened/corrupted even the other cults by offering services as being the ferrymen/bandits of the river; they transported captives etc.; they feel as if the other cults rely on them. However, they particularly don't like the fire cult but think the others could be turned against fire. Closest to earth, especially given the relatively close proximity of the monastery.

**One journal taken as example/evidence**. Priest's name was **Drosnin**.

Riglan remembers that Reash was in one of the corner towers, so we head there next. This is the one that looks the tallest, going all the way down to the water; accessible only from walkway. The guards that were there have pulled back and are guarding outside the tower.

Riglan asks Nethza if she wouldn't mind doing the scary talk-out-of-it thing, but they're loyalists ("the DC is very high") so they stand ground. As the discussion - well, argument - unfolds, followed by battle with the four reaver guards, we see Reash; he throws a few bolts of ice at us, in various magical forms, but at the last moment of battle, Reash changes into a water serpent and escapes into the river, leaping from the tower. From the tower, we see across at another tower the bugbears watching from the arrow slit; we see them descending and leaving.

In Reash's private chambers, we find a leather saddle bag containing a key that's identical to the rusty we already have. We don't yet know what this opens. Rusted again. There are also 12pp and 13 agates of various colours. In the bookshelf, there are various arcane texts; not full of spells, more mysticism or religion. **There are 3 larger, more ornate books... Maireagh comes over to look and identifies them as being books from the Mirabaran archive**. So this completes the set.

Reash also has a journal, which is particularly salty; thinks Jolliver has no vision, should be uncovering other treasures of Besilmir, not just using it as a staging ground and hosting a temple there. Reconstruct the city, raise an empire for the worship of the cult. **We take this journal too**. The mechanism for the portcullis is here too.

Nethza is keen to return to the keep. On the way, we see the bugbears have departed, swinging the front land gates wide open. They left on foot.

We get to the keep. People are there, nervously waiting. Everyone catches up. For the rest of the day, we sweep for other cultists then spend time with the books and the captives; who else has been here, where are they, and so-on.

* A lot of men have been sent downstairs and never came back up - the believe they get loaded onto boats, but don't know where they go from there. It's always one of the Fathomers (mages, Reash or "that other one" - name forgotten!) who goes with them. Perhaps they had to be there to get past the ghouls.
* Two families are reunited in a group, but others are incomplete; people lost down below. They think they will scavenge and pack, search the grounds for clues to see if they know where the may have gone, patch up the ship after the lightning etc. - we help with mending and so-on.
* They shut the front main gates and post watch and start gathering things together. Everything they and we can lay their hands on is loaded. We even fetch the second boat from the under-keep dock, which hadn't been used by escapees, and set it up as a life boat on the main ship.

By mid-afternoon, the boat is packed and ready to go. We see them off and wish them well, handing one who is saying they're going to Yartar a note we sign to take to the Water Baron who will hopefully help them find their feet.

With the day not done, we have a conversation and decide to strike while the iron is hot and is water is cold and head down.

As a ritual, Riglan casts Water Breathing.
