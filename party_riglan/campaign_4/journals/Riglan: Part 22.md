# Riglan: Part 22
## DAY 107

We are outside Scarlet Moon Hall, having met the druids and sent them to monitor various important cult or locally-affected-by-cult locations. We are able to realise all of the feelings we had about being more capable (full level 10) in the morning, too.

Both Temo and Riglan only roll d6 -> 1 for minimum wand recharges. Riglan thus has already still got 2 charges used out of 7 on his lightning wand and Temo has 1 still used on his magic missiles.

Maireagh has reinforced and strengthened her armour. She decides that she might be able to make some boots that let her fly, which given Riglan's divination vision seems more useful than a lot of other options. She has to attune to them, so we put the Stone of Good Luck back in her bag for now.

Today, we must descend deep down and tackle the fire cult in their greatest stronghold. We pack everything up and start our way back down via Scarlet Moon Hall, retracing our steps from the day before.

Riglan is a bit distracted (perception 4+9) and realises that he's not really paying attention so calls a fey lizard, thinking it might be a bit happier in the warm. It tends to scuttle along walls. It doesn't help - Perception nat 2! We do fortunately get down into the main temple; no hobgoblins; they really did leave. Once down, we collectively use our eyes and ears, avoiding areas we think might be repopulated. The hobgoblin barracks open back to the main corridor that lead to the forge. It seems quiet; we remember that Bastian was meant to look after it. It's quiet and inactive. Low flows of lava do still come through. We sneak through to the disc chamber and Riglan says, "Ash". We wait a fair few minutes, knowing how long it took to get us up here. After about ten minutes, though, nothing has happened. We have a look down the shaft; the open column is there; the glow is way down below, a few hundred feet. Riglan tries shouting! "Ash!" - nothing happens. He tries "Embers", to see if he needs to ask the disc to rise up to here first. Two minutes later it appears - what a waste of time!

So once again we crowd onto it. Temo acro 19, Riglan athl., nat 2 again, only 9! He starts to fall; Maireagh tries Lightning Lure, Riglan strength save - he wants to fail this anyway - nat 4; what's with these rolls?! - but this is good, as she grabs hold of him. He does of course take 9 damage. Ouch. Better than falling! Now we try "Ash" again. The disc descends down to the fane, but we want to press on, so "Ash" once more. **Here we go...**

...it gets warmer and warmer. The disc drops a long way - our guess is of the order of 600ft. We eventually emerge out of the shaft into a huge cavern, full of lava flows from lava tubes, filled with a lake of lava. North/North East ish, is another lake connected via a small stone tunnel. "Ours" is about 180ft by 100ft; we're towards the Southern portion. We see a series of stone steps, maybe 4ft apart, that need to be jumped to get across. The pedestals/pillars are about 3ft wide. Riglan perception: Natural 1. Well, this is quite bizarre. 10 total. He can't see much. Temo is surprised by Riglan's lack of attention and (perception 16+3) as we're going down that there are three tunnels that lead away from the cavern that are on solid ground. The hoppy stones lead to the middle one. At each of the other two are guards - **and both of them have spotted us**. Temo calls a quiet warning to everyone. We're about 50ft up.

A mage to the North, a priest to the West; the middle uncovered. The Northern one has that very burned skin look. Temo aims for burned-looking mage and fires. Very low damage though - 22. The priest throws a fireball!

Initiative:

* Maireagh 19
* Temo 18
* Nethza 17
* Riglan 11 (another low roll! Nat 6)

Fireball damage potential: 8d6 -> 38, extremely high roll. Riglan rolls another 6 for the dex save, so fails very badly. Temo passes very easily (nat 19+9) - his unbroken fireball dodging streak continues. Maireagh saves, but Nethza and the dog do not. Maireagh blows a flash of genius to help Nethza out. From the noise of it, another person runs out; the plate armour and burning heart - a Razorblast. He starts to glow and pulls out a spear that starts to burn.

The disc gets to ground level. Maireagh flies towards the priest, getting close enough to throw her hammer while instructing the dog to go as far as it can towards the Razorblast. Only one hits (the other is a nat 1, FML). 18 damage. The dog runs full tilt, deftly traversing the rock pillars and gets right up to the Razorblast.

Temo is really annoyed at how badly the previous hit went so tries again, aiming and firing at the mage once again. This time it's a much better hit - 37 (despite only a nat 1 from the 1d6 of the piercing damage; sneak was a very high roll).

Nethza looks around, intending to use her hex spell; all three enemies are in range; perception roll is good, notices that the priest is weaker but the mage is more injured. She hexes the mage. Two eldritch blasts streak out; both hit for 20 and 20 again, very close to maximum! It's not enough though - the Flamewrath is still up. She starts to jump over and makes it about half way across the stone pillars.

The Flamewrath mage retaliates. It does a strange gesture that sweeps his hands outwards in a circle, then together and up. Lava and flames are pulled upwards in a 30ft cube, corners reaching from the disc to Nethza to Maireagh - we're all caught in it. The whole cube is filled with crazy diffracting lights and colours - then vanishes... Wisdom saving throws:

* Temo: 9 (Maireagh uses her second flash of genius - "Hypnotic pattern! Close your eyes!")
* Riglan: 9+9 (that's enough to save)
* Maireagh: 15+0 (saves)
* Nethza: 14+6 (saves)

Seeing that the spell failed, the Flamewrath activates his fire shield and bursts into flames.

Riglan calls forth 2 creatures of CR1 (Conjure Animals L3). Two giant hyenas appear, a first for us. One flanks for the dog behind the Razorblast, the other behind the priest for Maireagh (would be flanking but isn't since she flies). Hyenas are at initiative 6, but lower dex than the priest, so the priest acts 1st. Riglan drops the bear totem (though the unicorn is tempting) in a place that gives the entire extended party an additional 15 temp HP. Riglan certainly needs that right now.

The priest now acts, considering Expeditious Retreat, but the tunnel behind is blocked by the hyena and house rules say that enemies can't move through each other's square. Cursing, the priest turns around and casts Burning Hands at the Hyena. Dex save nat 6+2, FML. 4d6 -> 16 damage. It pulls a dagger which bursts into flame.

Hyena A manages to get a hit on the Razorblast, dealing 11 damage (thanks to flanking; nat 1, then nat 19). Hyena B tries to attack, nat 7, misses. WHAT IS WITH THESE ROLLS. At least it heals back to full health at the end of its turn (new Riglan feature).

The Razorblast attacks three times - once at the dog, twice at Hyena A. It hits the dog and the hyena twice, with one of them a crit; the dog interferes; the crit becomes a regular hit for 10 damage (the crit roll was 19); other attack deals 8. Dog damage 11. Maireagh is really worried about the dog but stays focused and throws her hammer twice; critical miss, then a hit for 2d8+8 -> 17. An arcane jolt adds only 2d6 -> 4. With a bonus action, she tells the dog to self-heal, mending for 2d8+4 -> only 11.

Temo shouts, "Nethza, you've got that guy, right?!" and this time aims at the priest and fires. He gets a nat 1 for piercing again, but the sneak damage is once again good. 33 damage; the priest falls.

Nethza throws two eldritch blasts; the first misses, second hits for 18 damage, which is enough to take down the mage. She transfers the hex to the Razorblast and runs over next to the dog. As she does so, Temo shouts "remember that 10ft radius blast!".

Riglan tries Frostbite, but the Razorblast saves. He's a fair distance away; he can't see that he can do much except get in Temo's way on the steps, so instructs the hyenas the keep the attack going. Hyena A is already flanking, and with advantage hits for a decent 12 damage (and heals to full). Hyena B can't see a way around to the Razorblast so runs back along the tunnel it's at, reaching a nexus and using its sense of smell to figure out how to run back. It can't reach the Razorblast but gets behind the other hyena. Not much it can do.

The Razorblast attacks everyone around it. The dog reacts to stop a hit against Nethza. The Razorblast also misses the dog; but it hits the hyena for 8 damage.

Maireagh flies over and says, "watch out, Nethza!" and lightning-lures the Razorblast, hoping to pull him off the ledge. The Razorblast fails its safe - it is yanked into the air, hovering above the lava now, taking 10 lightning damage in the process. She then drops the Razorblast, that drops into the lava. It's bizarre to see this creature sinking slightly, but being otherwise unharmed. At least it's very hard for it to move - and Temo uses this advantage to aim and fire. Crit; 45 damage, not high rolls but the crit did lift things. It looks over in horror at Temo, having been caught by surprise. Nethza throws two eldritch blasts; one hits; 14 damage; she psychically shocks for another 5. Riglan tries Frostbite again but once more the creature saves (rolled dirty 20 for DC19, same as last time). Riglan now starts to move towards the tunnel.

The hyenas can't do anything at this point. The Razorblast tries to swim to a place to get out of the lava; but fails to do so (rolled nat 2). While the Razorblast isn't taking damage, it seems to be painful and the armour and clothing, which has been remarkably resilient until now, finally starts to give way and melt or smoulder. Nethza flies over at range, hits with one eldritch blast for 16; the Razorblast explodes, with us all at some range. There isn't metal shrapnel with the armour having partly melted; more a lava bubble.

We all reach the ledge outside the middle tunnel. Maireagh spends a moment repairing the dog, Riglan drinks a potion of healing and casts a self-healing low-level spell (coming to 60 out of 87 plus 15 temp).

Riglan: Wisdom total 18. We have entered a very dangerous environment; these people are expecting us to come down; guards are on alert. He sends the lizard down the tunnel, scurrying past the hyenas and beyond. He watches through its eyes. It reaches a junction (the hyena had seen this before but Riglan didn't know that). A little further along is a bigger cave, with a jet of flame in the middle. Lizard perception nat 2-1. It's warm. There's an upper ledge. It can't see what's up there. It is at least able to climb up the ledge and peek over the edge. There's another section to what is quite a tall and large chamber, it turns out. There's a small pool of dripping lava flowing down a rock pillar. Sat on either side is a Razorblast and a Fire Giant. They're not speaking, just sat there, but glance around occasionally to the main chamber; they seem to be watching it. Riglan pops the lizard back into the fey to avoid it being seen.

He tells the party what he's seen. While the pillar of fire might afford some protection, it seems unlikely that we'd all be able to sneak past and besides, where then, and how to get out afterwards?

Riglan pops the lizard back near us and asks it to sneak back to the junction, then around the first right-hand tunnel to see if there are any other exits; nothing. It just curves back to us. Temo can at least access the leftmost tunnel safely so goes to investigate the body of the priest; dirty 20 investigation. He finds a holy symbol of the fire cult, priest's robes - a full outfit - and a tradable gem worth about 25gp (says Maireagh later). We give the holy symbol to Maireagh, who's still wearing the earth cult one we realise (!) so she swaps them. We offer the priests robes to Nethza - it might at least give people pause, especially with her being a tiefling since we know Vanifer is as well. Riglan uses Disguise Self to look like Basitan - seems a bit bold, but why not. Temo can as usual hide behind the party along with the dog - we can always try to say they are there as our prisoners. We push the priest body into the lava so it will sink out of sight.

Riglan asks the lizard for one more favour - the fourth tunnel. He asks it to explore and come back with a report as it's too far away for telepathy. Riglan waits nervously. After a minute or two, it gets back into range and Riglan gets some mental impressions of the tunnel exiting into a land bridge over the lava - an uneven causeway - with lava falls further up, that come from very near the top of the cavern. This second chamber is the one we caught a glimpse of on descent. The causeway peters out on the Eastern wall in a narrow tapering ledge that seems to just stop there, with no obvious exit. There is a long gong hanging on stout chains near the western tunnel entrance. There is a structure rising out of the lava that you would step onto in order to hit the gong.

As the lizard comes back into range, we see a change. The Razorblast has come into the lower chamber and is sat cross-legged on a small mat in front of the jet of fire. It's as if it is a camp fire! Some food is on skewers, being roasted. The fire giant is laid down and curled up on the upper ledge. There is maybe an opportunity to try and tempt the Razorblast into the tunnels and engage it here, like we just did with the others. The battle we just did didn't seem to attract their attention - there's a lot of noise down here. Rumbles and hisses and occasional booms. The leftmost tunnel (West) is the longer, we're in the middle with hyenas; perhaps we try to pull it to the left.

- We'll head down the leftmost tunnel, leaving the two hyenas and lizard behind
- Temo will try to get the Razorblast down that tunnel
- Block his escape with hyenas
- Engage at close quarters

Behind us, the disc starts to lift up. Maireagh confesses doubts about the complexity of the plan and the time taken; we might have visitors coming from behind us soon on the disc. She prefers to just get on with it (or hide), so we sort of shrug - well then, let's just wade in.

So we head towards the Razorblast and the sleeping giant. Temo tries to sneak around the corner to get a shot at the Razorblast, but Temo gets seen. The guy shows, "Hay!".

Initiative:

* Temo 21
* Riglan 20
* Nethza 18
* Maireagh 16
* Hyenas 9

Temo acts immediately, saying "Hey!" cheerily, aiming and firing. He hits for 27. Hearing the noise Riglan hurries out and all he can do is try Frostbite, which takes effect for 9 and slowing down the Razorblast a little (disadv. next attack). He activates the staff. Nethza runs alongside and hexes the Razorblast, then throws two Eldritch blasts that hit (just) for 11 and 13. Maireagh runs out and gets one hammer miss, one hit for 20. The dog runs in and tries to attack but misses.

The fire giant stirs and begins to stand. "Oh... Oh! We have intruders!" - it reaches behind and picks up a great sword, stands and starts to move our way. The hyenas run up; one scrambles and falters trying to get up the ledge (bad athl roll) but is able to help the other by jumping *on* it so the second hyena gets up to the edge.

The Razorblast attacks Maireagh (the dog gets an opp attack but misses), but all three misses - she's ready. It calls to the giant to "get down here and help me!".

Temo is hidden behind Riglan around the corner a bit, but can clearly see the giant even if it can't see him. While the injured Razorblast is a tempting target, the giant is very dangerous so he fires. Hits but not great damage; 25. The giant certainly sees Temo now! "Tiny mouse? Tiny mouse you dare to attack Karnak? I will make you pay!"

Riglan tries Frostbite on the giant but it saves; very hardy indeed, unsurprisingly. He backs a bit further into the tunnel!

Nethza says - "Sorry, this might be very painful for you all..." and attacks the Razorblast, even though we're all in close quarters. Crit and miss. Very poor damage roll - only 18. She adds another 5 via psychic blast, but is annoyed to not have taken down the enemy. Maireagh tries to push the Razorblast away so she can get some throwing in with the hammer. Annoying the rolls match, which means he saves and doesn't pushed - she has no choice but to just hit with the hammer, for 12 damage. He Razorblast explodes. Maireagh and the dog save from the worst, only taking 8 but hyena A is caught by surprise, taking a full 16 (a fortunately low damage roll). She runs up, along with the dog; both *just* make it onto the ledge, but it takes all their remaining movement to do so.

The giant does a huge swing of his greatsword at Maireagh. Temo sees it coming but is too far away to help with Silvery Barbs... But Maireagh's hardiness now (AC 22) causes the blow to glance off the shield. Instead, it tries to swat her off the ledge - she goes flying off the ledge, landing close to where she was fighting the Razorblast, but does manage to land cleanly and not hurt herself.

The first hyena tries to snap at the giant from below the ledge but misses. The second manages to dance around and narrowly flank via the dog - crit! - 17 damage. Temo runs up behind the first hyena and uses it to hide, then fires. He hits and manages to get 27 damage. That's the second time the little mouse has made the giant roar!

Riglan runs in front of Nethza to get a line for his lightning wand; the giant doesn't damage, taking 31 damage. The giant is a little singed and visibly injured, but there's a long way to go. "What? Why are you attacking me! Why would you attack me? This makes no sense!" and Riglan remembers that he looks like Bastian. Riglan shouts, "The gods of fire demand payment for the incursions that we have suffered from the infidels above!" - deception 12. It's not convinced! But it's confused, which is something.

Nethza transfers her hex; she throws two blasts, with both hitting (second one, only just) for 25 across the two. Maireagh shouts, "You don't push a dwarf! These are *our* halls! You don't push a dwarf around, you lunk!" - she throws her hammer, with both attacks just hitting; 21 and 17, good round. That's enough - to Riglan's personal astonishment, he discovers that you really shouldn't piss off a dwarf in their home, as the fire giant falls, still with the surprised and confused look on its face. Marieagh's already ordered the dog to attack so it jumps on the body to savage it. Ugly!

Riglan: Perception only 4+9; doesn't see anything unusual. Temo investigates up on the ledge; investigation 13+11 -> 24. Riglan comes up to keep an eye on Temo in case of anyone attacking. He spies behind the basalt pillar, high up on the wall, some kind of hidden passageway. Crude handholds in the rock lead up like a ladder. Meanwhile, Temo sees, next to the giant's sleeping area, a strange satchel made of chainmail. Inside is a big pouch of no less than 25 bloodstones and potion of invisibility, which Temo adds to his collection.

Riglan heads the sound of echoey voices, from the tunnel behind us. Someone's coming. He whisper-shouts to the party below, to get them to scurry up on the ledge and we struggle to move the giant into a rough sleeping position (Marieagh helping; but Riglan rolls a 5 twice!) - he calls the hyenas to help too - everyone's at it, so Temo jumps back down and peeks down the tunnel to see who is coming. Stealth nat 20! 33 total. He sees the floating disc descending in the distance. As he waits, he also notices a strange lever set into the stone, near the main entrance. It's in an "up" position. Remembering how well it went for Riglan pulling strange levers back in the Monastery all that time ago - i.e. very badly - chaotic Temo shrugs, and **pulls the lever down** to see what'll happen!

The stone steps sink beneath the lava. Score! That might slow them down a bit. The disc starts to emerge from the top of the tunnel. As it lowers he eventually sees a flame priest. "Hail the heart of fire!" shouts the guy on the disc; Temo gets the hint and pushes the lever back up and uses Message to Riglan - get down here and bluff this guy! Temo runs down another tunnel and hides. Riglan looks down the tunnel and can see the glowing steps - the priest is waiting for them to call. The priest hails him and Riglan responds in kind. "Where are the other two?"

Riglan says, "We had trouble above. The hobgoblins have abandoned their posts!" "Yes, Lizzy's been killed as well! The priests don't know what to do!"

Riglan says, "Yes. Vanifer instructed me to come down and bolster defences here. The others are deeper in the complex laying an ambush." "I need to speak to her immediately! As soon as these stones cool enough!" Riglan says, "No. The priests *must* defend the temple. If Lizzy is truly dead, it stands defenceless without you. It could be invaded by this brigands and raided, defiled! You should not be down here. You must defend the temple!" "But we're running out of money!" "I will give you all you need" - Riglan risks the still-hot, but cooler steps and hops over close enough to the priest, pulling out some of the bloodstones; five, saying "this is enough, but..." - and five more, "this should surely ensure your ability to defend the temple. Go now!" "Hmm. You've become very proficient at jumping over those stones. Maybe you should spend less time down here and more time up with us! Very well! Embers!" he floats up.

Riglan scurries back, making a mental note of the 1-ish minute cool time and pats Temo on the back - "good work!" - and Temo pulls the handle to lower the pillars. We go back up and let the rest of the part know about the handle, the cooling time, the hand gesture and "hail heart of fire" - if we're in disguise, that sounds very important.

The party starts to rest. Riglan sends his fey lizard to the strange passage that he spotted. It's a small tunnel, maybe 6ft in diameter; if Riglan were to go, he'd have to be bent right over or crawl. The lizard crawls along at a fairly steep rise, maybe 30 degrees, but for only about 25 feet - then it opens into a chamber, the floor a domed mound - convex - within this strange, domed chamber that looks like it's carved to form almost ribs. All the walls are lined with around 400 humanoid sculls, most of them scorched and charred, stuffed into niches in the walls. Many burn with flames of different colours; the whole chamber is illuminated in a strange, flickering, multicoloured light. The chamber is wide, maybe 40ft across both ways. Riglan asks the lizard to venture in and investigate further.

Perception: Only 12 for the lizard. The patterns seem random; only a handful are not on fire. It starts up a "rib" upwards. It starts to feel funny - DC15 con save; 19 result; but then it dies. **Riglan realises the air up there is bad, but it was OK lower down where it entered.**

Riglan tells the party; Maireagh says she has some poison resistance, so is willing to have a look; Riglan doesn't know if it's important so he agrees - no short rest after all, it seems. Maireagh ventures up. Temo heads up so he can relay information, but has to keep a long way back. He says he can use Message again.

Maireagh gets to the chamber - it turns out the air itself is poisonous. She has to use a Flash Of Genius (only two left) to take half-then-half, 5 poison damage; she has a moment to quickly look around. "The air in here is poisonous; it's thicker higher up; it's pooling in here". She says there's another passage out; another Flash of Genius (only 1 left); 5 more damage. Investigates - pulls a lever! Vents at the top of the room open and the air starts to clear, but she still has to breathe in one more time. 5 more damage without another Flash of Genius. She calls for Riglan for magic detection, so we scurry in and Riglan uses Detect Magic.

The air is non-magical poison... All of the sculls do have Continual Flame though. Four of the sculls stand out as much more strongly magical from all schools. Perception: 10+9; the magic is familiar. This is very similar to the flaming scull that we saw at the Forge Of Spells in Wave Echo Cave. They're all facing down at something on the other side. Riglan risks it, walks around, intending to turn to the sculls and make a fire symbol to maybe prevent attack; but there's a clicking sound, as the vents start to close! Temo notices the lever starting to click back to place. Temo quickly pulls it down. We realise that the fumes etc. from lava are all flowing in and pooling here. Riglan sees a small chute, with a ladder; Nethza arrives, carrying the dog on her back! We fill her in and Riglan apologises for not helping with the dog.

There's a chain ladder down the shaft that Riglan sees. Intense heat and light radiates from down below but Riglan can't see enough; it's only about 4ft in diameter, descending maybe 30ft on the ladder. Maireagh elects to stay up and stand by the lever with the dog. "You three get down there!" - yikes, is hot. Riglan decides to go 1st because this whole thing is fucked up and there's magic everywhere so he wants to be able to see what the magic signatures are. He heads down, making haste as it's so hot.

**He sees a circular cave at the bottom of the shaft. It gets hotter and hotter. Con save only 14, 24 fire damage. He shouts a warning up, then hurries as best he can just to get a look inside. Another 24 damage. There's a ring shaped wall of fire. It's magical. He drops down, 26 more damage. Riglan only has 1hp. He casts L5 dispel magic. D20 roll is only 4, plus spell cast modifier, only 9. Nothing happens; he falls. Fails death saving.** Nethza sees this and shouts to Temo to get out immediately, so he does. She drops down next to Riglan, grabs Riglan and casts Dimension Door to get out of the room. He fails a second death saving throw. Maireagh casts Cure Wounds... He heals for 12. Alive - just.

So she says, "Right, so it's very hot down there and you need to protect yourself against fire! We need to get out of here." Temo moves over to the lever while she's doing this to keep an eye on it.

Riglan says, "I don't know how we do it but nothing other than something surely of enormous importance could be hidden behind all this. That wall of fire is strong magic. There MUST be something there. I just don't know how we get to it." Nethza insists we stop. We withdraw from the poisonous air at least, making our way back down to the giant. Riglan says, "this whole thing's been a mess since we arrived, but -" and Maireagh slaps him! "It's not a mess. Everything has gone alright. Just what happened in there we were unprepared for. So we just have to be prepared. I can cast a spell to protect you. But we're too injured and tired. There's no reason for us to carry on to do something good if we're all going to just die. We need to be smart."

Temo jumps down and pulls the lever for the stone steps. He comes back to Riglan, says, "come on, big cow. You need to take some time out." A minute later, he's stood and has called for the disc. Temo hops back to the tunnel while waiting in case anyone comes down on it. It comes down empty; we crowd onto the disc and get back up to the Fane. Temo makes the call to try for the sarcophagus room; it might be dangerous down here, but we know the fire cult are strong above and we don't have a safe space there. Maireagh uses Invisibility makes her and Temo invisible. By scouting ahead we avoid anyone and make it to the sarcophagus room.

We are forced to take a long rest, even though it's early. Riglan is sat down and very quiet. Temo sits up, leaning against him and reads his spell book again. After a minute or two though, he looks up at Riglan and thinks for a bit, then pulls out his Message scroll and borrows Riglan's pen and ink. He writes:

"Fire cult very strong. Divination indicates prisoners need rescue. With apologies, please return to scarlet keep, to guard entrance and escort survivors to safety if necessary." - rolled 19 on Arcana, so the spell works, but the scroll is used and we have no means left to contact the outside world remotely. "We will make haste to return" comes as a response.

Reading progress is good - he finishes and has a flash of insight (Riglan Caster: Wizard). By the end of the day, he has been able to copy Tenser's Floating Disk and Leomund's Hut over from the other book, the gnomish notes helping him via his helm to understand things; he got Maireagh to help with crushing four of the bloodstones into some of Riglan's ink. He also now understands Detect Magic, Find Familiar - he's been watching Riglan, which has helped - and also Illusory Script, but realises he'll have to do Riglan's trick of a ritual to make those work; he finds that his own innate abilities don't quite let him do it. He practices a bit; his spellcasting focus - his ring - but he does need some bits for Find Familiar; happily, we've plenty of charcoal. Temo is a bit off-put because he things some of the charcoal he finds used to be bits of Riglan...

## DAY 108

Riglan is quiet and introspective. He doesn't think Tidal Wave is useful; Protection From Energy is in hindsight more useful. He doesn't know why he didn't think of using the fire/chill shield when going down into the hot chamber; just thought he could be quick and figure it out, had Detect Magic up, just a bunch of mistakes. Wither & Bloom isn't as useful as he expected and things are rough here; time for Blight instead. Low level attacks are tricky, and since Thunderwave's not been useful, he goes back to his old friend Ice Knife. The giant was hardy; in fact quite a few things seem to be; but those larger creatures seems less dexterous.

Riglan is apologetic. He was so sure that something important must be hidden, some artefact or key to things that required such protection as four flaming sculls (which he presumes we'll have to deal with at some point) and a powerful wall of fire and just went for it, not realising just how hot it was. And it could yet be nothing; a red herring - a trap, but we're more prepared and, if we can get back there without too many fights:

* We'll stay in disguise - we know the greetings and hand symbols now
* Maireagh swaps Haste for Disguise Self so she can do that too
* Maireagh can cast Guidance to help Riglan
* Riglan can use his Protection from Energy
* Once again he can attempt Dispel Magic once or twice; if it just doesn't work, we have to move on

We figure there's no time like the present; disguises are set. Riglan is Bastian again, Marieagh disguises as one of the priests. She gives the physical fire cult symbol to Nethza who wears this along with the mage robes we had. Temo and the dog can just be "prisoners" / treasure / hiding / whatever! Temo takes the time to try out his new familiar; he uses Riglan's example from yesterday and calls a lizard, but Riglan and he are surprised to see, expecting Fey, that it has a Celestial aspect. Temo hides it away for now. Riglan tells him to think of a name.

As we start to leave, Riglan halts for a minute and is a bit choked up, and thanks everyone for saving his life. That's the closest he's ever been to the brink.

"This is what you've been doing for us all along," says Nethza, "of course there was never any question. I'm just glad that I could step through the Shadowfell and bring us out of there instantly before you burned any more" - but Riglan won't ever forget that she had been quite injured herself in the process.

We creep out and head for the floating disk. Our confidence and presence in the corner where the fire cult tends to reside means we have no issues; some cult members are present near the conjury, apparently cleaning up something; they hail us with the now-familiar symbol and we return that. We walk to the disc and confidently call "Ash" first, and it's a little disconcerting to see the disc rise - so we know more people have headed down there during the day. "Embers". Down we go. The pillars are not out as we start to descend. Nethza calls out, "Hail the heart of fire!" and a lever is pulled. The columns rise; we wait for a moment; eventually we step out, greet the guard - two mages now present at each other tunnel - and walk in. There's a lower level cultist standing at the fire jet, where the Razorblast had been; again, we greet each other; we get up to the ledge. The giant's body is gone. We walk to the back of the chamber and glance around to see if anyone's looking. As we go up, the cultist politely asks if we're taking "that prisoner" (Temo) up to the "fire prison" - tells us we'd need to talk to Vanifer to get the wall raised or lowered. It's interesting; everyone is just assuming that we know where things are this time.

**Fire prison!** Riglan heard that loud and clear.

As we get up into the tunnel, Maireagh points out that maybe pulling out all the prisoners right now would be a pretty bad idea. Perhaps we deal with everything *else* first, before bringing them out into danger. There are guards everywhere, fire cultists up above; getting them out will not be easy.

Riglan can't argue really, as he'd already been concerned about that. We'll have to try the other exit from the chamber. So, as we approach, Maireagh casts Guidance on _herself_ to get into the chamber safely. She gets affected by the foul air, but only for 5 poison damage overall. She pulls the lever and the air clears. Temo scouts ahead down the other corridor. He pops his head into the entrance. VERY warm. Heat radiates up from below; heat blasting from inside there. He looks back; he already feels the heat; we don't know of any other route, though. Riglan casts Protection From Energy (fire) for fire resistance and Maireagh stops Temo from drinking his only potion of fire resistance, instead casting one of her two L3 spells to give him Protection From Energy (fire) too.

Temo heads down and finds it drops down onto a wide, grated metal walkway. Whatever the metal is, it's very resilient - but also heat. The heat overall is extreme - it's only about 30ft above pool of lava. The catwalk is suspended from the ceiling and appears to connect to another column on the fire side, but in the centre is a stone column which it passes through. Temo, Maireagh, the dog, Nethza and Riglan make their way down. Temo notices slithering shapes in the lava underneath and points them out. Fire snakes? Then, salamanders. Four. They turn and see us. They squint and ready spears - Temo sees this, leans over, and makes an illusion that's similar to those from the prison - maybe this is the same salamanders? **Persuasion adv. 9,18+12 -> 30!**. He quickly puts on the helm. It seems that the salamanders, despite their experience at the forge, have accepted a new job! He hears them talking about that being the goblin - or gnome, there is some disagreement! - that freed them; a friend; but they should attack _anyone_ who isn't Vanifer; and they all agree to just turn the other way and dive back... The fire snakes breathe some fire and follow.

The other three look at Temo in astonishment as he (still with the helm on) hurriedly beckons them across to the middle pillar and beyond. At the pillar, nothing special, he carries on - but at the rear, Riglan notices that inside the column is a rock with a symbol of fire carved onto it, in an alcove. The rock is balanced above something. Could be a trap, so he waits for the others to have reached the other side before lifting the rock. A small, open-topped brass box is underneath. Four potions are inside. It gives the impression of being an emergency stash. Riglan quietly pockets the four vials and returns things as best he can to look exactly as they were, with the rock back in place, then hurries after everyone else.

He's already recognised three of the potions - one potion of healing, two of greater! - but the fourth is unknown; he shows Maireagh, but before she can say anything Temo recognises it (arcana 13+3) - a potion of flying! He'd looked at some in one of shops in Yartar after his casino adventure, flying above the hotel.

It's a curious situation; somehow, with this, we all end up with one regular and one greater healing potion. The only person who can't fly via magic or shapeshifting is Temo, so he takes the flying potion. If nothing else, it's a nice feeling to think that we've probably just pocketed Vanifer's secret escape stash.

About 20ft into the tunnel on the other side, Temo stops abruptly and signals us to shush. He tries Riglan's trick - pops his new familiar onto the wall and lets it scuttle forward to get a view through it of the cavern ahead. Temo almost falls over backwards and is steadied by Maireagh - it's very disorientating.

It's a large, circular cave, completely smooth sides, supporting a smooth, domed ceiling. The floor looks like it was molten but has set; a glass floor. Basalt pillars rise in a circle around the room, apparently supporting the room. The columns have niches carved inside, with dancing flames illuminating *copper* tapestries on the wall; each bears a fire cult symbol and a hellish like scene. On the other side of the room is a wide exit tunnel. Before that, is a dias and altar; two priests kneel near it and a third character is present in gleaming, glowing-hot armour - a Razorblast. There seems to be a side chamber with singed privacy curtains of some kind in front of it to the North; to the South, another chamber that looks well furnished and lavish. The lizard scuttles inside - **the Efreeti is here**! He did not stay in his fire domain after all, apparently. The decorations are extraordinarily lavish and, evidently, fire-resistant; magical, perhaps - from the Efreeti's plane. He reclines on a lounger.

The lizard starts to head to the chamber with the curtain. On the way round, it gets a clear line of sight out of the exit tunnel into a glimpse of a frightening, crazy room; a causeway across a truly giant pool of lava, lava waterfalls, other things he cannot make sense of. He's whispering what he sees and Riglan isn't sure but it sounds awfully like the vision, so he gets his own lizard and has it come alongside and looks too. Sure enough, it is the exact scene he'd seen in the divination vision. The shapes Temo couldn't recognise are the torso and elbows of the giant statue. He sends the lizard further in and now gets a true sense of scale.

It's truly huge. The causeway is at least 100ft long, terminating in a large altar with two huge curving structures that look like maybe giant bones or tusks framing it; the statue is about 30ft further in, surrounded by lava - it is a colossus in fact - is at least 160ft tall. The lava falling from its eyes and mouth isn't just a trip or trickle, these are rivers. They also run down its arms and pour from its elbows.

Riglan sees her. At the altar - Vanifer. She holds a dagger, gleaming white hot. Above the colossus, hanging in the air, seems to be a pulsing ball of fire. The flames sort of burn outwards and collapse back in as if dragged. No sign of the dragon though.

Riglan pops the lizard away for a minute, and realises he's actually backed away down the corridor a few steps inadvertently. Perception: 22; he's actually slightly on the causeway. He looks around to get his bearings as this is quite a shock (no handrails) and realises as he does this that the lava runs almost like rapids, flowing down like steps - there is movement - he sees a rock pillar maybe 150ft away amidst the rapids. There is a flap of wings. There, the dragon sits.

Can we tackle these things one at a time? Riglan insight: 22. Vanifer appears to be in the middle of casting a ritual; she is very focused; her attention is on the ball of fire. We ought to be able to perhaps fight in the Efreeti chamber area without her noticing given all the noise and heat around, but dragons are perceptive. Riglan does see its size; it couldn't squeeze in there, they're only narrow 5ft tunnels here, so if we don't just stupidly stand in entrance way and get a blast of fire breath, we should be clear of it until we choose to engage (whatever **that** battle might look like).

We have a whispered conversation. Nethza says, "The spellcasters will be dangerous but my main worry is the Efreeti. If we can concentrate our fire on that so that I can have a try at banishing it, then that can help us, but it'll need to be quite injured for it to have any chance".

So we take the pain from the priests and focus on the Efreeti, BUT if there's anything we can do to try and defuse some of their threat it would clearly help - fireballs are no joke. Temo does have his bag of tricks for at least one thing. In fact, he could just pull everything for the day. He can't do that in here, because the tunnel is too small; he can throw them into the room.

So this sounds like a plan? We have a plan. It's a bad plan, but it's a plan. Suddenly Nethza says - "Oh! I have a plan! I'll just cast Darkness on them, then you guys start hitting the Efreeti and try to injure it enough that I can try to banish it..." - well that's worth a try. Darkness is the better plan; that's the play.

We start out of the corridor - Nethza, Maireagh, the dog, Riglan and last Temo. As soon Nethza gets into the chamber...

...so we roll initiative:

* Riglan 23
* Temo 20
* Nethza 17
* Maireagh 13

...and stealth:

* Rigaln (adv. 14, 18)
* Temo 33 (nat 20!)
* Nethza 14
* Maireagh (disadv.: 5)
* Dog 14

Riglan runs in and tries Ice Knife - at L4. Nat 1; the main effect misses; dex save is 19, matching the spell save, so no damage at all. Boo. He activates his staff.

The Efreeti (initiative must be around 21-22) summons jumps up and summons a fire elemental right next to Riglan (initiative 19). Before it acts, Temo runs in hiding behind Nethza; he hits the Efreeti with his crossbow for 30; he tries to hide behind everyone (stealth 25). Now the fire elemental moves into the gap between the closely-packed Nethza, Maireagh and Riglan, explode into fire, then move back out next to Riglan - so the three of us get hit with fire. We take 1d10 -> only 2, halved for everyone; **but we also catch fire!** - we'll take 1d10 at the start of each turn until we extinguish ourselves. We hold our various spells. It swipes once at Riglan and once at Nethza; but both miss.

The Razorblast is distracted and hadn't noticed us coming in until now; it turns around in surprise. 

Netzha releases her prepared Darkness spell, enveloping the two priests and Razorblast (indeed, most of that half of the circular chamber - 15ft radius). She moves forward a little to consider how she might attack the fire elemental - not something we'd planned upon. She throws her Hex Blade's Curse onto the Efreeti too (bonus action).

Both priests were also surprised - especially now it's dark.

Maireagh runs along the inside of the chamber between Riglan and the wall, him shielding her from the fire elemental. The dog runs up into melee range while she attacks with her thrown hammer at a few extra feet of range. All hit! 24 for Maireagh's first - max possible damage - 21 for the next, still very high damage. The dog does 9 as well. An arcane jolt is thrown in for good measure, but it only gets 5 damage on top; still, that's 59 in one round. She does take another rounded-down 1 point of damage but holds her spell.

Riglan pushes past Nethza skirting around the fire elemental to line it up with the Efreeti and fires his lightning wand. Both the elemental and Efreeti fail to dodge. A decent set of damage too - 35 points to both. Riglan notes that both seem to take the full force of that damage too - perception total 21 - the Efreeti looks very nearly injured enough... Riglan shouts, "Nethza, we're really close!"... Riglan's on fire tho, so also 1 rounded-down point of damage; almost loses his spell and has to use a charge on his cloak.

...but it's now the Efreeti's moment to respond. It throws a wall of fire which hits the Dog, Maireagh and Temo directly towards the sides of the room, but with the burning side facing further inwards to hit Nethza and Riglan. Nethza curses - she feels she can't risk it, and Counterspells. She only has one spell left. Annoyed, the Efreeti moves into the room, next to the elemental, but keeping in melee range with the dog; it sees Temo when it does so, but Temo stands his ground, aims and fires, hitting for a high 32 damage.

The fire elemental acts, attacking Riglan twice. One miss and one hit, for 9->4 damage; Riglan continues to be on fire! Annoyingly he once again rolls a low save, he only needs a 7 as he's got at +3 but rolls only 4 and has used his reaction last time. Maireagh has to use a Flash Of Genius to assist.

The Razorblast runs forward trying to escape the darkness, but just runs full tilt into the fire elemental's space. Shame he's not hurt by it really. It steps back but is then trapped back in the darkness!

Nethza uses psychic blast - as an area effect, it hits the Razorblast, fire elemental and Efreeti for 5 damage each. She takes a look at the Efreeti (perception check) & decides that it might not be worth risking a failed banishing smite. She steps out, risking an opportunity attack from the fire elemental (which misses) then throws two Eldritch Blasts its way - both hit! With the curse up, it's a d10+9 each time - 16 and 17, 33 in total. It's not quite enough but the Efreeti is close to death. "Change of plans!" she shouts, "Maireagh! Take it down!"; but she's still on fire, taking another 4-2 damage. Spells stay up.

One priest (d8 roll for direction) goes sideways, walking into a pillar; the other comes forward and ends up alongside the Razorblast, bumping into the Efreeti this time - so by good luck and chance, both are still in darkness.

Now Marieagh's up to try again with the hammer. She hits for 17 on her first attack - and that's it! The Efreeti sort of disintegrates in a flash of fire and burst of smoke, like a smoke bomb; all the things it was carrying clatter to the ground. It's gone! This heals Nethza up to full, even though she's still burning. The fire elemental however is still there and is crazed. Maireagh tries her second attack in its direction, hitting for 19 damage there; she then takes 4->2 damage. The dog runs in to attack and hits too, for 9 more damage, but does take 1d10 fire damage in return - but only 1.

Riglan takes 2 more fire damage. This time he just barely holds his spell. He can't think of much to do in melee with pure fire; he tries Frostbite and it does have some effect but only for 5. He uses the opportunity to back away, risking an opp. attack; the elemental misses.

Temo doesn't waste time - aim, fire at the elemental. He hits easily but it's a very very low roll, only 20 total.

The elemental (by random roll) attacks the dog. The dog is actually the only thing in melee range, in fairness; both attacks hit, dealing 7 and 9 damage. Now the dog is on fire too.

The Razorblast figures out what's going on. It heads sideways and gets out of the darkness, running almost straight into Riglan, but Riglan is disguised as Bastian. Decp. adv., 15,19-1 -> 18 vs Razorblast insight 17. Riglan is momentarily pleased - but the Razorblast now sees Temo, who is undisguised and runs at him. The first attack misses, but the next two hit. Damage is 9 (max); Uncanny dodge halves it to 4. The second is 4+2 damage total. 10 in all. "Ouch! That's not happened in ages!" he shouts.

Nethza throws one Eldritch Blast at the elemental, hitting and one at the Razorblast, which misses. The elemental is hit for 11 and that's enough. It's gone. So now there "just" two angry magic users and an explode-y Razorblast. Nethza pushes next to Temo into melee range with the Razorblast and draws her Longsword. She takes 3->1 fire damage, but holds the Darkness spell.

The priest steps out and sees "Bastian". This time it's not so good - the adv. roll deception is (1,2)-1! Only 1 total. Riglan was saying, "Yes! Get it Nethza!". This probably didn't help. The priest casts Scorching Ray (L3), two rays to Riglan and two to Nethza. One of the two hit Riglan, for 2d6->8->4 damage, but holds his protection spell. Both of the two rays going towards Nethza miss.

Maireagh gets a little closer for range on the newly arrived mage and throws the hammer twice, hitting both times for 19 and 18 damage. She takes 3 damage from being on fire. The dog is instructed to run up and attacks too, flanking via Nethza; it hits (damage not noted). The dog takes 3 damage from being on fire now. Nobody realises that the other priest was right next to it, but it's in darkness so there's no opp attack. That priest now steps forward and finds himself in melee range of an angry dwarf. Burning Hands... A 15ft cone streaks out. It hits the immune-to-fire Razorblast, but does hit Maireagh, Nethza and the dog; Temo is just behind, out of range. All the party members avoid the worst of it; 5d6->19, so 9 damage for the dog, but only 4 for Nethza & Maireagh. Nethza keeps the spell.

Riglan throws a poison spray at the nearby mage, which takes effect and does 14 points of damage. He takes 1 more damage from the fire. He holds his spell once more.

Temo disengages, runs around, fires at the mage near Maireagh, and hits for a solid 32 damage. He runs behind a pillar for a bit of cover.

The Razorblast attacks Nethza. Two hit (despite the dog trying to intervene); 8, 8 damage (6 + 4->2 fire each time). She retaliates! She had held her darkness spell, but now drops it and hexes the Razorblast. She attacks twice with the longsword, aided by the flanking dog. Both hit, dealing 18 and 14 damage. Nethza's still on fire, of course; 4 damage; she *just* holds the spell.

The priest by Riglan now throws a fireball. It hits everyone in the party except Riglan. Dex saves all round. Temo dodges, as is his custom, taking no damage. Maireagh and the dog dodge but Nethza takes the full blast. The damage would be 31; Nethza takes 15 thanks to resistance but does hold her hex; Maireagh takes 7 from dodging and also holds her spell; the dog takes 15 more damage and is quite badly damaged now.

Maireagh is concerned. The spells are a problem. She runs around the nearby mage/priest, steps back risking an opp attack (which misses) and throws the hammer. She hits for 11 and again for 16. This is enough - the priest falls. The dog is instructed to continue attacking the Razorblast but can't get a hit despite flanking. 4 damage for her and 8 for the dog from fire; it only has 5hp left! Maireagh also *just* holds the spell.

Riglan tries poison spray one more time, since it worked well last time; the priest once again can't protect against it. 17 damage is enough and it falls. Riglan takes 4 fire damage, but holds his protection spell.

Temo (perception only 9) in his head mutters "Sorry Nethza and doggie" thinking it might be close to falling and aims and fires at the Razorblast. He hits for 26 damage. The Razorblast though isn't that badly injured, and it starts to run at Temo. The dog tries an opp attack but misses; Nethza attacks with Booming Blade. Crit! The crit hit gives a not-too-stellar 19 damage, booming blade does another 8 thunder damage, but the Razorblast is moving, so gets another 18 damage as that triggers. That takes it down and it detonates - Nethza and Temo are both in range. Temo dodges completely. Nethza shouts "Jump back!" to Nethza to help Nethza save to only take half, yielding 11 damage. She's only at 39 out of 90, but combat is - briefly perhaps - ended; Nethza takes the opportunity to pull the Razorblast spectre, which can aid us, even if only a little, in battle with the dragon and Vanifer.

Hurriedly, with some water and a lot of patting and rolling, we put out our flames.

Temo goes into the curtain-drawn room intending to cast his new ritual - his portable hut. It's just big enough. **It's Vanifer's room!** There's a risk she might come back and she's very close by, so he **goes to the Efreeti's room instead**. He takes out his book and begins the ritual casting through his spell focus ring. Riglan drags the two remaining bodies into the room and puts them onto the Efreeti's bed so that the main chamber is free. Temo simply chooses a dark black/red, looking like shadow.

Maireagh investigates. Inside the lair, we find a Potion of Speed and a copper tube containing a Scroll of Immolation. Temo can read that; we think Maireagh could make very good use of the potion, since it acts like Haste; she can move faster and get an extra hammer attack. There's a brass chest with a **full size ruby** in it too. Maireagh says that should be worth around 5000gp! There's a kind of rolled up contract scroll there and it seems that this is how its services were purchased. We're not sure that was worth the pay.

As the party starts to rest, Riglan drops in the unicorn totem and casts L1 Healing Word on Nethza giving her 9hp, but everyone also gains 10 more from the totem aura. Nethza also drinks a potion of greater healing for another 13. During the rest, we heal up fully via hit die; and Maireagh manages to get the dog mostly repaired (50 out of 57), but it can't take too much more punishment today. **Nethza prepares her Snow Leopard charm** from Valhalla, intending to use it when we go into battle. Seeing this, Temo thinks he might use his Arctic Fox; he was saving it for Unrayle, but it would only be useful if he was still alive to use it!

* Temo says he'll use his Valhalla arctic fox token, so gives Riglan his fire resistance potion
* Riglan drinks that
* Nethza uses her Valhalla token too and activates her flying wings - 60ft speed
* Maireagh casts L2 Aid, benefitting everyone else (in the form of small protective beads we put in our pockets, that she says provide an vitality aura of sorts) and activates her winged boots - 30ft speed - but she also risks taking the Potion of Speed just before we fight.

Temo decides to try his Bag Of Tricks. A badger! Well, not useful for offence, but could cause distraction.

Temo has an idea. We'll line up ready to head out of the tunnel, but leaving him a line of sight to Vanifer. He'll aim and fire, and that's how we'll start. He moves to get into position; Temo Stealth - Nat 1, then nat 2, so only 15! Unfortunately, Vanifer is just turning around at that very moment! She looks straight down the corridor at him. Initiative...

* Nethza: 22
  (Fire elemental)
  (Vanifer)
* Temo: 8,5 -> only 13
* Spectre 12
* Giant bats (see later) 9
  (Dragon)
* Riglan: 2 -> only 7
* Maireagh: 6

...Nethza sees Vanifer turning and reacts quickly, flying down the ~20ft of small exit tunnel and ending up about 15ft in the air out of the exit. She transfers her still-going hex to Vanifer and throws two Eldritch Blasts. The first hits; the second would just have got her too, but she throws up a magical shield. That one hit deals 14 damage.

(The heat outside is intense, to say the least).

Then, rising out of the lava behind the distant altar, appears a fire elemental. We hear Vanifer shouting directions at it, surprisingly in Common; "Incinerath! They seek to stop you from manifesting the Master. Destroy them!" - it gets up close to Nethza, but can't fly; it sits in the middle of the causeway, blocking much of the way out from the tunnel.

Vanifer now acts, casting a hypnotic cube centred near the tunnel entrance, which catches everyone in the party. Wisdom saves all round, except un-charm-able dog and spectre. DC16! Riglan *just* makes it. Maireagh is OK too. Temo fails despite advantage with 12, but once again Maireagh reminds him to close his eyes, just like last time; Flash of Genius. Temo makes it. Nethza only gets a 7, but adds a +3 for bless, and with a +6 for saving throws she *exactly* matches the DC! Wow, so thanks to Maireagh once again, we all make it. Vanifer curses. "What?! Halinaxus! Halinaxus! Defend the node!" - Riglan heads this down in the tunnel and *hopes* that she's calling for the dragon, lest there's something *else* to worry about.

Temo has a clear line just past the elemental; he aims and fires. He gets a hit despite Vanifer's shield, he hits, but it's only for 23. It's a long way away, it had to get through a shield and the target location was not ideal due to getting past the elemental.

The spectre flies out of the tunnel, hovering just above the ground, flying _through_ the fire elemental and attacking. Nat 1! Oh dear. Going through a fire elemental is clearly not quite as easy at it expected!

Suddenly, from around the corner where the main lava river flows out, appears the dragon. It gets within about 10ft of Nethza and attacks her, three times; a bite and two claws. A claw misses; the the next misses; but the bite gets her - 17 piercing damage. She does fortunately keep her hex. The dragon roars and snarls in Common, "Turn back now, or sacrifice yourself at the Altar Of Imix!"

Riglan is up; he finds his courage and runs to the tunnel mouth, enough to see the room. He hurriedly casts his L3 conjure spell and he, too, uses the last of his Valhalla gifts; he selects the creature. 8 giant bats! HP 30, AC 13, fly 60ft, initiative 9

1: Snow golem - 45
2: Yellow spirit statue - 45
3: Wings up wyvern - 45
4: Wings down wyvern - 45
5: Stag - 45
6: Horse - 45 
7: Upright brown bear - 30
8: Polar bear - 30

Five go to the dragon, two to Vanifer and one on the elemental alongside the Spectre. Riglan is able to drop in his bear totem to bolster everyone in the party except the two bats on Vanifer. He orders them to attack and for now, retreats back down the tunnel.

Maireagh drinks her potion and comes speeding out of the tunnel, then leaps and flies, heading out and up towards Vanifer, so she's quite high - about 15ft - and providing another distraction and angle of fire; she's just in hammer throw range. She calls the dog out to attack the elemental. Her Haste-driven hammer throw is deflected by another shield. The dog manages to get in 12 damage to the elemental, taking some fire damage in return - but only 1 point, this time.

Nethza strafes sideways in the air, pulling away from the dragon but triggering an opportunity attack but it misses (nat 1! The giant bats have confused the dragon...), getting close to Vanifer at about 20ft up and adds Hexblade's Curse on top of the hex. Two more eldritch blasts are thrown; both hit, getting past Vanifer's shield. 19 and 16. At least Vanifer looks somewhat injured, but still a very long way from going down.

The fire elemental attacks the dog and nearby giant bat. It misses the dog, but does hit the bat for 12 damage and the bat, though a sort of spirit, is corporeal and catches fire.

Vanifer's second shield falls and she springs into action again; she throws a fireball. It hits Nethza, Maireagh, bat 2, 6 and 7 and the spectre. DC16. The max potential damage is 10d6 -> 35. Maireagh saves (plus resistance => 8); Nethza saves (same => 8); the spectre fails (resistance tho => 17); bat 2 saves (17); bat 6 also saves (!!); bat 7 fails, so that's taken out - it had no temp HP. Poor thing never even got to attack, as they rolled a higher initiative than Riglan and had to wait an entire round. Vanifer moves forward a little, probably to get some range for a nasty spell... We can now see her weapon, which we've learned is called Tinderstrike. It's a very wicked looking, gleaming curved dagger with a white-hot look and sparks cascading off it.

Temo, if anything, now has a better view of Vanifer than before. Nothing fancy then; aim and fire. He gets a better hit; 31 damage. She's actually looking quite rough now!

The spectre tries to use the dog to flank this time and has another attempt at the fire elemental. This time it gets a hit, for 3d6 -> only 5 damage! Sigh.

The bats attack. 1 misses, 2 hits for only 3 damage, bat 3 misses, bat 4 hits but again for minimum possible damage of 3, bat 5 manages to hit too, this time for 6 damage. Bat 6 is on the elemental; it attacks but misses; bat 8 is on Vanifer and tries too, but misses too. Bat 6 does take a full 10 damage from being on fire after the elemental attack, but heals 5 from Riglan's aura.

The young red dragon now tries to withdraw, triggering attacks of opportunity from four bats, two of them with advantage. Amazingly, all hit - one even crits - for a combined total of 23 damage. But now the dragon shows its true form... Fire breath. Its cone of fire hits Maireagh, the dog, spectre and bats 2, 3, 4 and 5. DC17. 16d6 (!!) -> 51 damage. Wow. Maireagh and the dog fortunately save; so does the spectre, but 25 damage takes it down anyway. It disappears, perhaps to heaven, or at least to atone. Maireagh takes 12 due to dodging, but the dog does take the 25 despite its save, so quite heavy damage (it was still a bit damaged from before - 46 now, temp gone). Bat 2 succeeds, bat 3 just makes it, bat 4 succeeds also, but bat 5 does fail, which takes it out completely.

Riglan now acts; same kind of deal; he gets to the entrance, and tries to use his lightning wand. He uses only 1 charge and, annoyingly, Vanifer counterspells at the exact level needed. Riglan moves his totem a bit to help his bats heal up. Heads back in and has a think about his next move. Temo looks him and shrugs, "I know, right?" (at least Vanifer's reaction is used - no more shields this turn).

Maireagh doesn't waste time; she just throws her hammer - haste gives her 3 attacks. **The first hits for 20. That's enough! Vanifer falls!** Via her hex, this in turn heals Nethza for 15. It was a question, it later transpires, of several smaller hits of physical damage, not too much with saving throws, so no chances to resist. Maireagh now turns her attention to the dragon; she is able to fly within range and throws the hammer twice more. One **just** hits, one hits comfortably; 2d8+8 => 15 and 19 damage. She also uses another Arcane Jolt but only for 2d6 -> 4 more damage.

Maireagh doesn't want the dog to get more damage now, so asks it to dodge.

Nethza transfers her hex to the dragon, calls out, "Halinaxus!" - knowing its name, she can use her Psychic Blast even though she doesn't have a great view of it from where she is. 8d6 -> 24 potential damage, and it fails its intelligence saving throw; it takes the full damage and is both stunned, shocked and surprised, unable to act for a few moments.

The fire elemental attacks the bat and dog. The dog interferes to provide disadvantage on the bat; the elemental misses both times (D20 attack rolls 2, 3, 4, 5!)

Temo sees Vanifer is down and gives an excited shout to that effect to Riglan, but the fire elemental is still there and causing trouble, it's also stopping him or Riglan from easily getting out of the tunnel. He aims and fires at it, hitting for a solid 31 damage. Now the bats act! Bat 1 moves around and attacks the dragon from behind, but misses. Bat 2 flanks and gets a hit, but once again, minimum damage. Miss. Finally, bat 4 flanks and tries; but it misses too. Bat 6 is on the elemental and since it's on fire anyway, taking 2 damage, it attacks; it does get a hit, but only 4 damage... But it takes 7 damage from that hit, but at least it then heals 5. Finally, bat 8 is still up and able to reach the dragon, tries its luck and gets a hit at max damage - 8, heh. It's something! Good work, bats.

The dragon is incapacitated briefly, but as it recovers we see it open its mouth and a kernel of fire starts to emerge from its throat. It looks around and eyes Nethza with fury. We can tell that it got its flame breath back.

Riglan comes once more to the tunnel entrance. He tries the wand; the dragon dodges, but still takes 13 damage. Maireagh throws hammers. Hit, hit, hit; 19, 19, 20... And with that, the dragon drops out of the sky and towards the lava. The bats excitedly try to grab it - they're +2 STR and 5 of them on the dragon, so they bring across and drop it onto the causeway. Then they make a weird high pitched - to them, presumably, low pitched - squeaking noise, at which point from down in the tunnel Riglan shouts, "What? They're cheering! Did we do it?!", having momentarily completely forgotten about the elemental.

Nethza hasn't forgotten about it though! She transfers her hex, then hits with Eldritch Blast twice, for 14 and 16. She shouts, "Guys! We still have a problem here!" as the elemental attacks the bat, hitting despite the dog intervening for 12 damage; this takes down bat 6. It then tries the dog, but the dog is dodging and its attack misses. Temo sees the dog dodging and repeats what he does well; trope-y or not, aim and fire. He only does 21 damage, but that's enough - the elemental just sort of fizzles away. As he's looking that way, he sees Vanifer's body suddenly combust dramatically and turn to ask. A few other party members catch the end of it as there's a loud crackling noise. Her belongings are left behind.

Riglan runs out. He looks up at the ball of fire above the statue and shouts up, "Well done, for real, but I had an idea from that vision with Unrayle. Can any of you throw that dagger *into* that ball of fire, without touching it somehow?!" He also asks the bats to try and array themselves in the air as close as they can under the ball, between the statue, so that if the dagger just travels through and calls, they might be able to catch it.

Nethza agrees to hold the dagger using a cloth, fly above the sphere, drop the dagger and the bats will be ready beneath.

Tinderstrike falls into the portal, which collapses. **The entire cavern starts to collapse and the ceiling begins to fall!** Tremors shake the entire cavern. Riglan pops the bats out of the plane, and he and Temo start to run back into the cave; Maireagh swoops down, grabs the dog, lands and starts to run along with the dog. Nethza gets ahead, flying. Big chunks of rock behind us smash down into the lava which rises and bubbles. Parts of the cavern start to buckle and fold in. Across the metal bridge - Riglan athl 22; Temo stumbles (nat 3-1), tries Luck point (nat 2-1), can't keep up. He's got no protection against heat this time and the bridge is *very* hot. Nethza swoops down and casts Fly on the dog and on Temo to help them. Maireagh is trying to catch her breath as her haste wears off! We do manage to get to the bottom part of the tunnel up. Riglan rushes in, risks the poison damage (and resists the worst - only 4) and pulls the handle; shouts behind for someone to stand by on it. Straight down the ladder, he has fire resistance now; he gets to the bottom without being burned. Once in the room by the wall of fire - which is still up - he is immediately hit by it. He doesn't know it, but the dog has flown back to help drag Maireagh along; Temo and Nethza have caught up by flying.

Riglan takes another 11 fire damage. L3 Dispel Magic - *this* time it works. Huddled in the middle, Teresiel, arms around two others. Riglan shouts, "It's not a dream! It's us! But the place is collapsing, sorry about that, can you run?!"; Teresiel is OK, he gives his normal potion to one and is startled by Temo, who has come down while Riglan was casting, handing over the other. Temo is talking *fast* telling people to hurry! The ceiling here is now starting to give way. Nethza starts pulling one up with Fly, Temo likewise; the other two climb; we get to the chamber, Maireagh at the lever - "Go! Go!" and we head down the tunnel. Riglan jumps out and down at the end, Temo can fly and helps one person, Nethza is already helping the other, Riglan looks up to Teresiel and shouts "Jump!", she reaches out; Riglan athl 23, he catches her - "Very soft fur!" she says! - and we run. In the corner of his eye on the left Riglan sees some strange creature of long tentacles that's lashing at the gong in that area, seems enraged - Teresiel looks over - "THAT'S the thing! They sacrifice the prisoners!" - it's climbing onto the causeway as rocks start to fall. Riglan thinks it's some kind of roper.

Temo's at the front and goes to pull the lever, but it's already up; the steps are raised; however, we're going to need to fly people out of here. Temo's flying - the badger with him! - Nethza's flying, Maireagh's flying; the dog too; Riglan calls an L5 dragon, puts Teresiel and one random on it, then Riglan - who's only just remembered Temo's badger and seen it flying out of the corner of his eye - turns into a giant eagle. We all start to fly for the chimney that the disc uses; a tsunami of lava is rumbling down from the far end; the roper is reaching out for us but is far below; as we head up, the lava hits the chamber below us, destroying the floating disc. We keep going, up and up, all the way to the forge level. We can hear all sorts of bad noises from down below; the ground trembles and dust falls from the ceiling. Down the tunnel below, we see magma jetting up, some pouring out into the fane, but it doesn't reach the fire temple and we think that we *might* be far enough. As we get to the forge, Nethza starts throwing Eldritch blasts as there are some remnant cultists here. Temo, Maireagh and Nethza are just throwing down ordnance as we try to head out. We fly through the lava tunnels, with just about room for the dragon, eventually bursting out into Scarlet Moon Hall and outside.

The prisoners are set down. Riglan thanks his fey dragon and it curls up in a corner. "Bit of a waste - should've seen what Vanifer left behind... Sorry..." and at that, Temo grins and pulls out a diadem from his backpack. "She had this!" Maireagh investigates. It's a beautiful gold and platinum set diadem, looks like a tiara; there's a big ruby in the middle. Maireagh estimates a value of around 250pp as a single piece.

While this happens, Riglan, clothes smouldering a little, runs over to Teresiel and the two rescued prisoners. He produces some goodberries for them. Medicine check: nat 20+5; 25. They need water in particular. Temo is about to use his beads of refreshment but Maireagh creates water via a spell - 10 gallons equivalent! - we use various containers and tell them not to drink it too quickly.

"So," says Riglan, "Sorry we're so late. The fire cult were very difficult. I actually found the prison yesterday but was a bit hasty and nearly died trying to take down the fire wall - wasn't strong enough, had to try again today. Teresiel, we're so glad to see you alive - we thought the air cult had killed whole delegation until we stumbled across Desenya who was about to be sacrificed by the air cultists. She told us that you'd been taken by fire, so we prioritised that though we were barely prepared for what we found. I'm incredibly lucky to have this group of people at my side, and it looks like we just managed it."

"Thank you for getting us out of there. It's been a complete blur... I don't know what she wanted. She just seemed to be sacrificing people to some fire god of hers; it makes no sense... They were taking people three at a time and I'm pretty sure we were the last. If you hadn't arrived when you did, we wouldn't have been there to save..."

"But I'm sorry it took so long and so many were sacrificed."

"There were more that came. I don't understand. It looks like whatever they were up to down there, it's over?"

Riglan: Insight 12+5. Teresiel is looking at the pin on his cloak and a small smile appears on her face. She says, "ah, I hate to be so forward, but, you wouldn't happen to have any spare robes or anything would you?!" - he realises that all they have left are burned tatters of clothing. We make up some outfits from red cloaks, and some traveller's clothes from our combined sets to fit people.

Riglan says, "I asked some druid friends to head to Red Larch to try and solve the kidnapping problem there, but then we tried to message them to come back as we realised there were prisoners below; so I'm not sure where they are, but hopefully on their way."

With a flicker of annoyance, Riglan suddenly remembers that he'd intended to get the other sending stone but never did; we never checked the room either; he fishes out the sending stone from the bag and activates it and says, "You still there?" and waits to see if there's an answer. There isn't. This is a good thing. He says to Teresiel, "Yes, I think what they were doing is indeed over".

Teresiel thanks him, but something else is going on; Riglan looks to Temo and indicates with his hands that maybe Temo should chat. Temo wanders up and asks quietly, "It must have been really rough. Are you going to be OK?" "No, no. I'm fine." Temo takes that at face value, but asks "Is there something else though?" persuasion 14. She says "everything is fine. Thank you for rescuing us".

Temo goes back to Riglan and shrugs. Riglan remembers her looking at the pin, tho he'd been distracted by the subsequent request for clothes; maybe it's that; he goes back to try and persuade her to talk (adv., 6,19+3)...

* Side note: Riglan is still a Spring Warden, but now has a Renown of 2.

...she puts her hand on the pin. "A Spring Warden. I should have known that someone of your persuasion, abilities and beliefs would be one of ours. What do you understand of the reason for the attack and our abduction?" Riglan answers, "Very little; the cultist abductions have largely seemed random; although they did have a certain interest in the books you held, and by the way we think we've recovered more or less all of those, but they mostly seemed interested in books about Besilmir." "Ah. Well. Will you walk with me?" "Yes..."

We walk a short distance away. Riglan looks back to Temo and nods, sensing that Temo is curious and Riglan feels he should be part of it. A little lizard pops up at the back of his neck; Temo is there.

We get close to the tree line. Teresiel breathes in deeply and touches a tree. The colour of her skin seems to recover somewhat and the tree leaves rustle, apparently in response. "I've missed this... The delegation was a real mix of different forces. Despite recent alliances to tackle the rise of a threat from the underworld, our various, _somewhat_ secret organisations on the Sword Coast are still not great at open communication! Within the delegation were at least four entirely separate aims, travelling together. The Lord's Alliance had someone in our midst, I know that to be true - I can't tell you who - " Riglan says, "Desenya? Yes, she needed a document we recovered." "Ah! I see. The dwarves of Mirabar had their own reasons to take books away from Mirabar." Riglan asks, "Ah, because of the power and danger that it represents of the objects and wealth hidden, but in fact not actually lost, within Besilmir?" "That particular faction wanted to remove the temptation from the ruling nobles of the Mirabaran Court. They sought the wealth for themselves, thinking it was their right; and there is an Archivist there with his own agenda, who had frightening nightmares of forces calling out to him and he sought to hide information that would be useful to these creatures that were chasing him. I feel it is he who ultimately jeopardised all of our missions... I believe the forces that were seeking him out were the very cults that kidnapped us. His presence revealed our location, for he carried books that they wanted."

Riglan briefly mentions how we first bumped into them at Beliard, and reminds her how we had warned them that an earth cult faction were in pursuit and subsequently felt quite responsible for their kidnapping given that they left early at our encouragement, however, it was way before we even got to Yartar that we discovered something of Besimir, the dwarves carrying those books and learned that yes, indeed, those people - who we know now to be earth cultists - were following and seeking them. So, that seems to confirm your suspicions."

"Well I too am carrying a secret and it was imperative that I kept it hidden once were kidnapped." She parts her robe at the side and to Riglan's horror he sees a wound on her abdomen, which looks almost scarred over; she winces, braces herself, her fingers turn into claws (Riglan recognises Primal Savagery) and she scratches the wound open, and exposed is a small silken pouch that she'd buried within herself. She opens it. "I carry these for the Enclave. I need to get them to Goldenfields, for the Abbot there is next in line to be their custodian. These are the last seven seeds of the Ancient World Tree, which a faction of us in the Enclave are tasked with guarding. These seven, when planted in good soil at the right time, will grow into awakened tree ships - trees - living, sentient trees that can traverse the cosmos - " - literally, ships that are trees! - "They are the seeds of entire worlds! Well - that is the story, anyway. These are the last seven of the tree that seeded *this* world. We each get appointed custodianship of these seeds at the height of our powers for a century, before we must pass it to someone else. Only the long-lived races can be shouldered with this burden." 

(Meanwhile, Riglan has cast L1 Healing Word).

Teresiel explains that she thought travelling with the entourage/delegation would provide protection, but in fact it's been the reverse.

Riglan has to think; Red Larch might now be able to resolve itself, since the Fire Cult is decisively destroyed. Perhaps Varigo, Mahoon, Iniri and Fariya will be able to assist. Teresiel thinks she might rest at Summit Hall. Riglan explains that the books are there too, temporarily, in the crypt. Riglan writes a note, apologetic in tone, thanking Summit Hall for all their assistance to date and asking them to once more take in someone for rest, also explaining they're another person from the delegation from ages ago.

The other two rescued prisoners turn out to be traders, from Waterdeep who had been on a caravan up north and coming back on the Long Road through Red Larch when they found out with shock that Red Larch had become dangers. Their whole crew were kidnapped and sent to the temple. Some died early, some survived but were sacrificed. The two want to get back to Waterdeep and wonder what they should do. They're afraid of Red Larch, very reasonably. Perhaps they could travel towards Riverguard Keep as a group, but from there they might be able to find their way down further, e.g. on a barge. So, Riglan knows the Adbar Trading Coster captain's name and for them, writes a similar note, asking for them assistance. They are encouraged to hear that there is a trading Coster as their own names carry monetary weight. In any event Riglan gives them each 10gp, since they've lost everything and that should help them find safe travels to the South.

While we wait, we have food and drink, some foraging and hunting; it's good to be outdoors again, with the weather seeming a little less unstable in this area.

Towards the late afternoon, the four druids arrive back. We explain to Varigo, Mahoon, Iniri and Fariya what's happened and how we'd like them to convey Teresiel to Summit Hall, via Riverguard Keep to drop off the other two. A conversation is held to see if people want to move on today or to wait until tomorrow; there is a preference to just leave now, acknowledging that it's a big ask since the druids have travelled all day already. There's an agreement for dinner! Our own party figures we should set up tents since we're quite beaten up and we don't actually yet know the way down to the earth node.

With this, there is a moment of pause and a chance for the party to reflect. As the sun starts to dip low, the druids think it's a good time to go; the twilight provides some cover. Three of them turn into horses! They'll be able to travel fast. One turns into a wolf. Riglan resists the temptation to feed apples to the horses... Teresiel thanks us once more. "If it happens that the stars align, find me; if not at Summit Hall, then at Goldenfields" Riglan says, "We're not sure what our future holds for us, be it this plane or the next; but I've heard a lot about Goldenfields and am curious to visit it, so should the chance arise, I surely will go there." Teresiel says she's like to be at Summit Hall for at least a few days, resting & waiting to hear from the Enclave. If we take longer than that, she'll be on the road or at Goldenfields herself. She does take pains to tell the whole party that what they've done is very important - not saving her, but stopping the seeds from being destroyed or falling into the wrong hands.

And off they go. Riglan calls, "Farewell and good luck" after them.

Riglan goes back to the party and knows Temo's heard more or less all of it, but takes time to fill them all in and reinforce the sentiment that Teresiel conveyed - **we've done a good thing.**

### (7425 XP) -> Surprise 11 bump

We sleep...

...Riglan: Wisdom saving total 17. There's a strange tugging at the edge of his consciousness; a burning? This isn't a dream in which he feels immersed. In fact, it feels like something trying to contact *him* through a dream. It is indeed a fire, burning; Riglan finds he can walk to the "edge" of his dream. It's very strange. He looks across from his dream to something else - an infernal landscape. Pure molten fire. The recognises the prince / god Imix, hovering beyond; but Imix is unable to touch Riglan. He comes up to the strange boundary, angry, furious, he can't even talk; he's completely trapped. Magmin and fire imps nearby are gathered around the weapon Tinderstrike, intact but back in his plane. By throwing it through the node, we've closed it and left nothing of Imix left our material plane. Imix has no influence.

Behind Riglan, more and more space seems to appear as it grows; the essence of the fey wild, of nature, is reclaiming space lost when Imix had influence. Imix seems to be pushed away too, the boundary growing distant; it's quiet.

Standing next to Riglan in this fey wild area of a dream appear a number of large elk, horses, stags, buffalo, moose... Riding in fey spirit form, they are a procession. The old Chieftain of the barbarian tribe is there. Valhalla. "You have used our gifts wisely. Very wisely! You are worthy of the Stories of Old. We only have met your kind in summer days long gone by, when the sun would stay up and never set, or in the winters where it would never appear. **We renew our bond from centuries ago. I offer you my companion, or my tribe.** What is it that you would take as a token of our renewed alliance of the Tribes Of The North, wanderer, traveller and protector of the realms?" - on his shoulder is a huge snowy owl. Beside him are his retinue of barbarians. Riglan deduces that the offer is one of wisdom and insight, or the strength, the fighting of the tribes. There is a brief flash of back when Riglan was offered a choice between a sickle or a staff by the elf in his dream of long ago.

Riglan says, "I value this alliance more than I can readily express. And I value the offer of your whole tribe by my side. But while for now, it seems as if battle is my path, I hope that in due course we prevail and my role becomes more one of protector, and observer, where wisdom and insight will be my strongest tools. So I hope in this choice I do not take your companion from you, but I would choose the owl."

"Oh now, you don't take him from me! He is mine. I will simply give you a way to contact us. I am reminded of the role that your forebears played in the alliances of old; we can compliment each other. Us, as creatures of the wild, will claim the wild for nature once more." The warriors raise their battle axes in agreement, mount their various steeds and rise into the sky as the chieftain pulls his horn and blows on it, sounding as they travel into the starlit sky.

Later, Riglan wakes for his watch. Under his pillow is a figure of a Serpentine Owl.

(End of note - Part 23 next)
