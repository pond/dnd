# Riglan: Part 18
## DAY 97

We get up early intending first to head to Eskilindar's. It's very busy again, even early on. A few stalls sell exotic-looking breakfast food. Nethza picks up a few bundles - some fluffy kind of savoury cake and a pale yellow-white refreshing bean drink. Some drunken sailors go by, staggering home after a long night, with a few mothers shielding their children's eyes from the spectacle.

Eskilindar's is open early, capitalising on the busy conditions. The shop is busy. Tourist-y books are on show - festival history, guide to Yartar. He even has some lanters and kites on sale. Temo buys a kite - we suspect for Carp. It's a nice-looking sort of fold-out cubic kite with a hole in the top and bottom.

Eskilindrar spots us, and calls over - "Ah! You're back!". We ask if he has a scroll of sending, but he's all sold out. Instead, he offers us a small box containing some sheets of paper. He shows Temo how to fold the paper into a bird shape. 3d4 - 4,1,4 - there are 9 sheets in the box. It's a way to send 9 messages (**inventory, Temo: "Paper Bird"**) for 300gp.

We leave him to it after paying as the shop is being mobbed by incoming customers. He loudly bids us farewell to draw more attention to the shop, making us sound like important regulars after "powerful magics"!

The whole place outside has an interesting, busy large bazaar feel for most of the party, with even travelling merchants moving carts around as temporary stalls. Quite a strong city guard presence. "No vacancies" signs abound everywhere. Riglan sort of gets it, but this is the busiest he's ever seen anywhere and the old disconcerting feelings of being overwhelmed by it all are present again.

We cut slowly across, taking in sights, heading towards the inevitably-busy Morning Spire. The bridge and dock are quite packed. The Grand Dame is decorated even more than usual, adorned with countless lanterns. People busy themselves bringing things onboard and off. We have to queue into the Morning Spire, but do eventually manage to top up with incense for divination spells (75gp).

Our last morning chore is to visit Lanowin at the library and bring him up to date on some of what we've learned. The archives have an exhibit on, so it's even busy here. There's a book tour with one of the scribes offered and a children's corner contains colouring slates and large simple education posters describe the history of the lantern festival.

Temo looks but can't see him (investigation 2+9). After some time, Riglan spots him (perception 9+8), but it's taken about 15 minutes. We explain that we have various journals etc., but he's too busy with the festival on - we'd better catch up after.

We elect to have Nethza be made invisible, Riglan and Maireagh change to look like just everyday sailors and Temo to, well, skulk - ideally he'd dress down into something less conspicuous but instead he just wraps his cloak around him and considers it job done. Saves us fighting back across town to the Griffon, at least. We head down to the Three Rivers Festhall with plans to listen and observe, each of us to their best skill. The visible party members will do so openly, while Nethza and Temo have other options. We note in particular our prior experience with the side-rooms off the hall and Riglan can always call forth a spider or similar if there is reason to suspect that it would be worth listening into one.

We head in. Maireagh concentrates on keeping Nethza invisible; Nethza skulks around, lisening into conversations. Temo, to our surprise, dives into a ruse of being a server, grabbing a tray and starting to clear empty glasses (adv. Deception, total 15), aided by minor illusion cantrips. He seeks clues (investigation total 17). Riglan listens carefully (perception Nat 20+8, 28). Nethza perception only 8, she's too busy trying not be bumped into! We spend 2gp on drinks as we proceed with the ruse.

Maireagh looks over near the end of the hour; we know the spells are almost done. We head outside - Temo placing down a tray with a half-taken order, "it's the end of my shift, sorry, bye!" and runs off - and we use the noise of the crowd to cover our sharing of information.

* Maireagh didn't notice much but decided focused on helping Nethza and Riglan with keeping up the illusion as Riglan focused on eavesdropping.
* Nethza didn't discover much because it was too busy, but she snuck into a few private rooms successfully and found that there was *some* talk of some high-value "thing" being sold in an underground auction; most people didn't seem to know who was behind it; points to the Hand as best she could tell - she was fairly sure she was listening to Zhentarim at one point and they seemed like they wanted to acquire, not sell. They referred to it as a "useful negotiating tool for whenever we need one".
* Temo found a group of people who had been hired as muscle (mercenaries) for someone who figures they need escorts for a very high value, dangerous and contested tiny item. They want 6 people to help guard it. They're hoping to hear about it by tonight.
* Riglan overheard a table behind, talking about "the Kiss" and that "all bids to the Kiss" and we caught the name "Nareen"; Riglan hears that this is a member of the Hand and she is the bookkie coordinating bids for this item. It doesn't mean the Hand has it, they could just be facilitating; nor that the auction will be held at the Wink & Kiss. Riglan is pretty sure that the Hand is *not* interested in acquiring the item - they would like it out of Yartar, because Yartar is their home base and they've no interest in seeing it destroyed. They're anxious and jumpy about such a powerful item being in the city.

There are definitely four parties involved - Zhentarim and Hand for sure - we know from other bits overheard that there are two more, but we don't know who. Temo in particular wanted to know if Kesper Drylund was one of them, but couldn't get that; he thinks that the mercenaries he was listening to do represent another party. They'll know if they're needed for tonight, so that must be happening soon.

It's around midday. We consider our options and can't think of much better than presenting ourselves as a fifth party at the Wink & Kiss. So we head there, and use buying lunch as a way to start conversation. It's prepay and, when the order is taken, Riglan slips a gold piece onto the server's tray and suggests that perhaps they could be served in a private room. She says, "the private rooms are all accounted for I'm afraid" and Temo says, "well we were hoping to speak to someone about Nareen..." - she stops and looks over to the bar; the bar tender looks to someone sat in a corner in the shadows that we hadn't noticed; they all look back and she simply says, "I'll be back with your food".

She come back quickly with a hunk of cheese, some dry sliced bread and a plate of cold shaved ham. Could be worse. She suggests we might have a drink to calm the nerves - whispers, "I suggest a drink, you look very nervous!" - and we order 4 drinks. 3gp in all, steep even given the 1gp, uuuh, bribe... Riglan perception: 2+8; doesn't notice much. We eat and time passes. We get through most of it and about half way through the drinks when the server comes over and puts down what looks like a bill tray with a note on it. It says, "Who are you?". Signed with a hand print stamp.

It's blank on the back so Riglan scrawls on, "Riglan and party. We have achieved some notoriety of late. Interested in a forthcoming auction" and puts the note back. The server comes over once we've finished meat bowl ostensibly to clear that, picking up the paper with the bowl. As we finish the cheese and drinks, a guy hiding chainmail under an oilskin jacket with a hat and leather boots walks up to the table and says, "Follow me". We do so, walking towards the back. He opens the last door on the left of a corridor through there and ushers us in. He looks to us and says "No weapons". So Nethza makes her weapon disappear, Maireagh hands over the sword and Temo hands over the crossbow and dagger. He puts them into a box and we head into the room with a large circular table with a half-elven woman and two guards. She looks familiar. This must be Nareen. There are 6 empty seats, so we all sit opposite.

Riglan, "Nareen, I presume". "Yes. I don't know what it is you think you've come here to do, but I'm willing to hear you out. I know who you are."

Conversation goes to and fro. We get to saying that we want to be a 5th auction party. Riglan insight 12+5. Nareen is not hostile, she's just businesslike and busy. She's trying to guage whether or not we're worth her time because she has to make a choice about whether to spend the time with us or someone else. Her attention is drawn to Nethza now and again, even if Riglan's answering; it seems as if she's expecting Nethza to answer. The subject of bidding amount comes up and Riglan says to Nethza, "Nethza, you're all over the numbers." Nethza says, "I can do some talking if you like, but Temo would be better with the numbers! We are able to acquire various magic items and a substantial amount of funds; to prevent a substantial amount of back and forth, perhaps it would be quicker if you were to just tell us where we should start - because we *must* have this item."

Nareen says she's happy to represent us and is neutral, but merely wants the item sold and removed from Yartar. "It makes us very uneasy to have it this close to the city." An interesting turn of phrase. Temo says, "The same for us. And we intend to immediately take it quite some distance away." "Then our needs are aligned." "Yes."

Nareen now looks to Temo, judging him the treasurer of sorts from what we've said. "If I give you a number, I need to tell you how likely it is that you can secure this amount..." Temo nods. She picks up a quill, dips it into a vial of curious looking swirling ink and pushes it over to Temo. He looks at it, as it shimmers with a number "15000" and then dissolves. Temo looks up and says "that should not be a problem."

"Now here's the difficult part", says Nareen. "It's happening tonight and to secure your bid I need to turn up with your 20%". "No problem", says Temo, reaches into the bag, pulls out six trade bars and pushes them across the table. He's *always* wanted to do that. The two guards aren't able to hide their surprise at this. Nareen remains impassive - "that's what I like; right down to business". She looks to a person near the door; they give her a bag, she puts in the bars, shows us, draws it closed, and gives us an emblem. "Now, are there just the four of you? Is there anyone hidden, invisible, in another plane..." - and we say no, just us and the dog. She gives us four tokens. "You need these to gain access". Temo says, "Gain access to where?" and she hands us a rolled up map. "I will meet you at point A and I will take you from there".

We stand, nod in agreement and turn to leave as she packs up and heads out the back. We collect our weapons and head outside. The server and bartender nod respectfully to us in passing and we nod back. I guess walking out with weapons and lives intact was a good sign!

Temo outside is ecstatic, amped by the adrenaline and what he calls "the most money in the world" but we know we need to get to the Water Baron ASAP. We get to hall and find the 'secretary' and Riglan this time says, "With apologies, we are here an absolutely urgent matter of vital life and death importance and request to an audience with the Water Baron as soon as possible" - our mannerisms and Riglan's intonation convey the urgency well. We're told to take a seat in the waiting room, but 15 minutes later she comes back - "this is highly irregular! Wait here but I'll bring her out..." and the Water Baron comes in via a side door.

"What's going on? I don't have long as I've told them I'm going to the bathroom!"

We explain the minimum amount of 15,000 gp - but assert that we'll put in 5000 of our own, so it's "only" 10,000. Minimum tho. The Water Baron is shocked, but recovers and brings in a woman carrying a ledger and has a rather difficult conversation. We're asked when it's needed by - "tonight, and I don't imagine that denominations matter too much" - "you'd better not be fucking us over with this! Just don't lose it! The money or the orb!" - in the tiny pouch are 10 emeralds; 10,000gp value.

She reaches into her own coin purse and pulls out a small stack of 10pp. Well that's something - we thank her.

We don't yet know where this money is going to go - we don't know who the seller is, but from things Nareen said earlier, the orb was taken from the cult. We have to hope we're not about to commit to giving a whopping 15,000gp to someone ostensibly destructive.

We check the map; it has a location just outside the city in what appears to be an old cemetary - Kelemvor's Charnel House. The time written is 9:19pm. That's strangely specific. Meanwhile, Riglan digs around looking for more things to sell!

**For school of magic or Eskilindar:**
L3 scrolls - Erputing Earth 150gp, Wall Of Water 200gp.
2 x L1 scroll - Beast Bond, 80gp.

**For Aneera at Wallheims:**
Drow poison - 200gp.
2 healing potions - 100gp.

**Firelast:**
The Drow cloak of elvenkind, estimated 225gp.

**The Pipe**
We finally sell our long-held-onto jade statuette of a frog. It's a sad day, but we get 40gp.

We negotiate well and get the market value. It helps that it's a very busy time in the city and all the retailers have lots of money - and lots of customers that they can potentially charge _above_ market rates to.

995gp all-in, so that gives us some headroom coupled with our last dregs of funds and the 10pp from the Water Baron.

It's a somewhat nervous afternoon of selling stuff quickly but pushing, this time, for good prices; being aware of the amount of value we're carrying and that it isn't ours; the weight and importance of things resting on our success; and the unknown price to which the auction might ascend. We have around 3600gp ourselves, so could maybe put in another 3500 to leave 100gp to be able to buy some breathing room for making more maybe - so we've down-paid 3K, have 3.5K ourselves, 10.1K from the Water Baron - 16,600 is our ceiling.

We try and settle down and get some (cheap market!) food. It costs 1gp but then Temo hits up on the idea of a performance. Maireagh pulls the Maireagh face - but Temo's sure he sees a twinkle in her eye - Nethza gets out her fire sticks and, as the carnival atmosphere of the evening settles in, Temo manages to find a space at the market (he's done this before, many times!) and puts down his hat. Riglan lights the sticks and we get started. Maireagh knows she can do the light show.

Temo: Performance: 7+7 only 14
Riglan: Performance: 18-1+3 for 20(proficiency bonus on the horn)
Nethza: Performance: Nat 20! for 25

Coppers are thrown into the hat - we're not in Sungift anymore! - D100 -> 80, leads to rolling a D4+1 -> total 4; we end up with a total of 4 gold. Temo and Nethza are delighted - "You *never* get this! Never! A gold each?! That's unheard of" she says; Temo just says, "Best gig I ever played!".

We keep an eye on the clock tower at Happy Hall around 9pm start to make our way across to the East gate. Riglan perception only 5+8, but enough to notice as we approach that there is a change in the mood; it's less festive here. Something is keeping the party away; we suspect some kind of spell or perhaps an unseen build ushering people away, but don't know what it is for sure. It's mostly just through traffic at the gate. It's a little on edge; we don't recognise anyone.

We haed up to the tomb and graveyard area. We've not visited here before. It's a walled cemetery, with a few crypt buildings, various tombstones and the Kelemvor temple - a god who guides the dead into the afterlife. Riglan gets jumpy about undead. Nethza, religion 14+4: Kelemvor detests the undead, as they're a perversion of the domain, so we perhaps need not worry about undead surprising us here.

The area marked on the map is towards the western side of the temple. There's a tree with a couple of tombstones there, but also a dias for offerings and gifts of remembrance. (Terrible perception rolls) As we get to the tree, Nareen surprises us by appearing out of the shadows. "Oh my goodness, you guys would be *so dead* if I was an assassin! Keep your wits about you!" (FML). "Where next?" we ask. She points out that how it works is that we sit in the auction room and Nareen communicates with us through an old piece of parchment that works a bit like a short range paper sending stone. It's done to protect the identity of the participants. Boo. We were kinda hoping to get in a room with them!

We are led via a side door down into the Charnel House. She shows us where she'll be standing and bidding on our behalf; she'll tell us high bids and give us a chance to respond. Each round lasts a minute, so we need to have decided our bid within that time. She will wait 6 seconds for each answer and at the end of the minute it will be sold once nobody else bids within the minute. Things rarely exceed 2 rounds due to the sums of money involved. If we win, we'll be brought out of the room and the exchange made. We're warned not to barge into the other rooms!

We realise that there are four antechamber rooms off the main area - of course, the Hand was in fact not a fourth bidding party, they were just a facilitator. So there were only ever 3 groups in play to buy.

Our room looks like a priest's quarters. Sparse furnishings. The door is shut and locked. Nareen sends "are you alright?" on the parchment and we write back "yes". "We will start soon" comes back.

Time passes. Riglan calls a spider and sends it into the roof of the main crypt, leaving the others to keep an eye on the auction. He sees Nareen taking up a place next to our door. A different group walk in; Riglan perception total 17; they're well dressed, flowing velvet robes and, underneath, black leathers. Their cloaks have hoods, which are lowered. Two have long brown hair, one with it tied back; a third person, much shorter and looking like they maybe have some kind of blur spell, is with them. Following behind is a small flying snake - Zhentarim. They're shown into another room.

A couple of minutes later, a third group arrive. This group is dressed in robes too, crimson coloured, hoods up. Just two. Riglan doesn't recognise the clothing at first. There's some disagreement at the door, until a small glass orb is handed over to the person ushering them in, but seems very unhappy to do so. As they do so, their cowl falls back and we see them bald with tattoos on their head - Riglan suddenly remembers the red wizard they fought at Old Owlbear Tower (so we know it's Thay). The orb is put on a table next to the door & they huff, then walk into the room. Riglan assumes it is some kind of viewing or scrying device. The fourth room is already occupied. Riglan figures that the times were specific intentionally to stagger arrivals.

The auctioneer party (the Hand, including Nareen) take positions by doors. As this happens, Riglan scuttles across to the fourth door. There's a gap at the top, so the spider squeezes in there. It's strangely very humid and warm in here. Riglan wisdom saving: 11+8->19. He senses a pulse of psychic energy but does manage to avoid it; it's emanating from a very large wet-looking creature sat cross-legged in the middle of the room, flanked by what look like bodyguards. Riglan does not recognise the species. Amphibious/reptilian.

Riglan's been quietly reciting this to the party as things evolve. Riglan realises we won't be the only ones breaking the rules. He also points out that the slimy creature has very strong psychic powers, though the guards appear to be only guards; they were carrying the creature on a dais. It has tentacles, too, Riglan notices; very strange, and Riglan would wager, probably very dangerous to us given the psychic strength. There's also a young woman in a short tunic with a short skirt and leather boots who has the auction paper.

Riglan brings the spider back into the main room. We wait for the auction. We see bids being taken & the papers being read. "We have a leading bid, currently it sits at 15000gp; please let your charges know and give them the opportunity to respond."

We assume that it's us in the lead - Riglan whispers this to the party. Hand gestures and finger movements seem to convey information in the makeshift auction hall for a while; the one in charge nods.

"Right, next step. The bidding now stands at 15,200" and almost immediately we see that appearing on the parchment, followed by "increments of 100", so we bid 15,400 to show we're serious. "Thank you" comes back. A short while later, the fingers and hands and nodding resume.

"15,500 increments of 100" comes back. We offer 15,600.

"15,600 increments of 100" comes back. Perhaps everyone did the same. Fuck all of them. We offer 16,000.

There's a pause. "...OK" is written!

Riglan is satisfied, at least, to see looks of surprise in the hall in response! "16,000 is the highest", he hears and nothing is written back so we must be highest. More time passes. So tense! Two people hold up their hands in the hall now.

"16,200 increments of 200". 16,400 then. Nearly out of fuel!

We seem to be back in the lead. There's some discussion and we hear - "Very well, I'll make that exception..." - Riglan doesn't know what - then we get "Slight change, winning bid currently 16,500, increment of 100" - we offer 16,600, maxed out.

An eternity passes. Nobody raises a hand. Nods are exchanged and people move in front of their doors. There's a knock and the red wizards are shown out of their room, given their orb back and the scowl. They're looking around the room but get led out as they're doing so. Next is the room with all the humidity. The young lady comes out, bows, beckons forth the two guards carrying the dais carrying the creature, tentacles flowing over and writhing a little - it's quite cute - and it is carried away. Finally, the Zhentarim. The door is shut between each time so that it's unclear to departing parties which rooms are full or empty.

As they leave, the Zhentarim nod to the altar; Riglan can't see anyone there, but they seem to think that there is. Nareen looks up at the spider and says, "You can come down now!" - Riglan pops it back onto his shoulder. The door is unlocked and she comes in. "Well it looks like you won. I hope that wasn't a bluff."

Riglan says "Fortunately not, but it emptied us out completely. I should warn you that we strongly suspect things might get quite exciting quite quickly from here..." - she seems confused - he says "well, the cult might not take that too lightly..." - she doesn't seem to understand. But the guards stand to attention anyway.

We're led forward and we're brought to the altar. She pushes the back and a stone slab slides aside, showing the main priest's quarters. Sat within, with several guards, is the seller. We realise that the doorway leads to an apse (room behind the altar), with a beautiful rose window with scenes of glorious death and so-forth. Sombre but not morbid.

We don't know the seller. It's an older-looking, salt & pepper bearded man with hair tied back. Human, taller - 6ft - rough-looking skin. Probably used to be quite wiry but age has softened that. Wears chain mail. We at first think that this is just a more senior member of the Hand; we might never discover who the seller truly is; but the Hand are all women. So who is this? We try to remember all details that we can.

Nareen says, "Alright. 16,600" and puts down a velvet lined tray. She takes out the 6 platinum trade bars. We're told that we need to hold onto the emblems until we leave; they weren't shown on entry either - magical ward? Anyway, Riglan says "I hope you're not fussy about denominations..."

He lays out:

* The 10 sapphires
* The 10pp from the Water Baron
* 3500 of our own money in mixed up coins, but nothing smaller than electrum

We're left with about 170 gold equivalent *in total* in the party fund. Temo exclaims, "Huh! Look at that! We could've gone to 16,700 after all!" tho we don't think he's *too* serious!

A treasurer counts to make sure; everyone is satisfied. We are told to wait. He reaches into his pocked and pulls out an ornate tiny object that looks like a very small chest. He places it on his palm, closes his eyes, whispers something and lays it on the table. As soon as his hand moves away, in the blink of an eye it's a full sized chest. He opens it, removes a small box and places it down. He takes the tray of valuables, puts it into the chest and reverses whatever the spell was to shrink the chest down. He hides it away in his pocket. Nareen bows; Riglan: Perception 8+8; Temo gasps as the sling glows and Riglan shouts in warning immediately.

In the blink of an eye, there is a loud crash sound and the rose window explodes inwards. Smoke fills the room. Con saves: Riglan 18, Temo 16, Nethza 18+4!, Maireagh just 14, but in a flash of genius grabs out some strange object from her pocket and places it over her nose and mouth (DC 15, +5 effective added to Maireagh's roll).

As the smoke is clearing, we see an arrow with a string attached pulling the box with the orb attached out of the window - everyone else in the room has collapsed unconscious. We all give immediate chase, jumping out of the now-destroyed window hole. Nethza's off the mark quickly and activates her cloak and flies out. Riglan wildshapes into a giant eagle to follow, picking up Maireagh who clutches the dog and Temo in each claw.

We see a fast-looking person in a black shimmering cloak, hood fallen down, short black hair, with a longbow slung over their shoulder running *very* fast and cutting across the graveyards. Estimated range 90ft away, estimated speed around 90ft. Temo blows 3 charges of his missile wand, all 5 resulting missiles hitting for 18 damage. A pale female face turns to face us; suspect she's elven. We spy leather armour. She eyes up something and it looks like she's aiming for a crypt about 30 feet away from her, running towards it and sliding into the door of the crypt. By the time we reach the door we're maybe 60ft behind. Riglan has to turn back into his normal form and we all run inside.

We see stone stairs descending inside and chase down at fastest possible speed. We can hear her running ahead. Catacombs. The crypt is larger than it looks. Temo is in the lead now, as he's fastest on foot; he turns a few corners and gets into a larger room that seems to be some kind of tomb. In there is the woman and a priest standing next to her. A large Sahuaghin, all wet skin and half-lizard/fish face with fins and two fierce fighters stand by.

Initiative is rolled.

* Temo (adv.): 16+5 (21)
* Riglan: 20!+5 (25)
* Nethza: 9
* Maireagh: 4

Riglan runs until he can see down the corridor past Temo and into the room; he conjures four apes (initiative 15+2) and moves out of the way. Shelailagh on the staff. No totem yet, people are too spread out.

Temo moves out of the doorway and fires at the priest. 17 -> hits, but low roll for 18 sneak damage only. He keeps strafing sideways and slides behind the tomb (stealth 22); people probably know where he is, but they have no line of sight and he has cover.

Apes! There is much screeching of excitement. Ape 1 multiattack bow lady with flanking advantage. 18+5 and 19+5 so both hit, but D6 rolls 1 and 2 mean total damage is only 9. Ape 2 does the same thing. It hits once for 7 damage. Ape 3 goes for the Sahuaghin again with flanking, hitting for 6 damage and 9 (max) damage. Ape 4 is encouraged by this and goes for the same, doing 8 and 8 damage after hitting twice. Good round for the apes, with advantage making a difference but some consistently high rolls regardless.

Now the archer moves, rolling away from apes 1 and 2 who do get an opp attack. Ape 1 hits but for only 5 damage and ape 2 misses. She pulls out the longbow, spins around and fires at ape 2, hitting for only 4 damage but gets a high sneak attack roll too, for 14 - plus poison, 7d6 and tho it makes its con save the half damage finishes it off sadly. 

The Sahuaghin looks around and there's a burst of psychic energy. We hear it speaking to us in our minds. "The kraken society claims this orb. Lay down your weapons and we will recompense you for it. Resist and you will all drown under the power of the kraken. None would survive" and it pulls two short swords out.

Riglan shouts, "What do you intend to do with the orb?" - "The power in the orb will be added to ours. It is not any of your business what we do with it. Lay down your weapons and we will let you walk out of here with your lives. Resist and be slaughtered."

Riglan starts thinking about it, but seeing that,Maireagh shouts, "How about no you dipshit - and get out of my head! How about YOU resist and YOU die!" - she doesn't want Riglan's oft-grey nature to be swayed by such rhetoric.

"Don't say Gahld was not merciful on you!" and attacks apes 3 and 4. Ape 3 takes 12 damage. Ape 4 luckily ducks out of the way of a strange back-handed strike that would've counted as sneak attack, then tries to bite but misses too (rolls 1).

Nethza is up. She's still flying and gets all the way in until she's close to one of the warriors and the archer (albeit in the air!), shimmering with ice from her ice armour cast earlier while she was flying, and casts hex against the priest, firing two Eldritch Blasts. First hits for 17, second hits for 15.

The priest responds. It "speaks" in a thunderous screeching sound emanates out through all of the catacombs; an abyssal, infernal and primordial mixed psychic assault. We all see a picture in our mind's eye of 50 or more tentacles stretching out from the inky depths of the ocean, immensely large, frightening all of us.

DC 14 wisdom saves:

* Riglan: Good roll, 26
* Temo: 17! Rolls high (18-1)
* Nethza: Matches and passes with 14
* Maireagh: Rolls an 11, but in a flash of genius she starts pulls out the crystal that pops up the more recent of our two photos; this helps her focus and avoid the fear through trusting her friends.

Surprisingly and fortunately, none of us are scared.

The two attackers move. The first ignores the apes nearby, instead attacking Nethza with a heavy crossbow - but fortunately misses. The other one does the same thing - they're focusing fire on the more dangerous person. Amazingly, also misses. Maireagh finally makes it into the crypt and, from the doorway, casts Thorn Whip across underneath the flying Nethza at the archer. Rolls 21 to hit! Yay. 8 damage and the archer ends up 10 ft closer - right into Temo's line of sight from behind the crypt. Marieagh calls the dog up which runs into the room and has enough movement to reach the archer; the dog attacks, but misses.

Riglan runs up the corridor again to get a look into the room; he drops in the bear totem, boosting everyone with 13hp. He shouts, "Keep at it lads, great work!" to the apes, pops his head into the room, looks around and casts Water Breathing for the entire party, including apes.

Temo aims at the archer and fires. He hits for 25 total damage, injuring the archer/assassin badly but she dodges the worst of it (uncanny dodge) and is still up.

The apes go again. Ape 1 runs up to the archer and attacks with flank advantage. Only 4 damage on a first hit, and only 4 on the second (D6 rolls 1 both times). Apes 3 and 4 attack Gahld again. There are two hits, doing only 10 damage (again quite low D6 rolls - both 2, this time, still, the attacks were OK).

The archer looks around the room, quickly calculating options. She rolls back away from the dog, Nethza and ape. The dog gets a hit for 7 damage. The ape critically misses. Nethza uses the mace while casting Booming Blade, spell attack 15 just hits matching AC; initial damage is 17, and in fact that heavy impact is enough. Her momentum means she keeps rolling and the spell detonates, but she's already dead - even her uncanny dodge wasn't enough.

Ghald roars. "No! Now I am furious!" and pushes forward. Ape 3 swipes but misses; then ape 4 as Ghald keeps going and ape 4 hits but again only for 4 damage (d6 -> 1 again). Ghald ends up in Nethza's face and uses all of his 3 attacks on Nethza. The first shortsword hits for 11 damage; but Nethza's armour deals back 10 cold damage in response. The second attack hits too, for 9 damage. Finally he leans in for a bite, but her flight agility helps her dodge out of the way. She holds concentration on the hex spell on the priest fortunately.

Nethza looks at Ghald with surprising calm and says, "*Your* mistake, coming after us" and, with Hex Blade's Curse on Ghald, flies over the top and around to end up diagonally over from the ape, distracting screeching nearby (flanking) and attacks with the mace, hitting twice for 25 total damage. Ghald's starting to look rough.

The priest moves around past the apes (who've already reacted against Ghald) and casts (as a 20ft cube) a sudden weird uprush of water out of the water, with black tentacles emerging and flailing around trying to reach for people. "Very well. We gave you every opportunity! You will down in the unfathomable, endless depths of the kraken!"
 
The fighters are a bit constrained by this are effect, but one of them attacks Nethza with a crossbow. The other, very close by, drops its crossbow and attacks with a longsword, and surprisingly misses - *just* - with both attacks.

Maireagh needs to dex save against the spell and, surprisingly, makes it - 18+3, 21. She's not restrained or bludgeoned by the tentacles. She runs up to attack the priest, briefly considering a thorn whip to throw it into its own pool, but decides to keep it simple and swings twice, tho only hitting once for 10 damage. The priest keeps its spell up. The dog amazingly also makes its dex save (nat 19!), runs around to get advantage and hits for another 10, but the priest, despite being badly hurt, does keep up the spell.

Riglan dex save 11, but Maireagh shouts, "Just look at where you're trying to place your feet!" and blows her reaction to give a +5, for 16, saving. Riglan gets into a corner and throws flame at the priest. He hits for 9 damage, which takes the priest down! The spell fades. Riglan moos softly in Nethza's general direction (Healing Word), healing her for 8.

Temo can see Ghald clearly, takes aim and fires. He hits for 21 damage. Ghald's only just clinging on. Ape 1 attacks with advantage. Crit! 11 damage - and that's enough to kill him. Taken out by an ape! There's a gasp and scream in our heads, a *feeling* of surprise and then he's gone - we realise he'd been in our head the whole time but is now gone. The ape moves around to the warrior nearby and has another flanking attack, but it misses. The next ape almost gets in a hit, but does just miss; the last ape misses wildly.

Nethza, now fully healed due to the hex plus Healing Word, transfers the hex to one of the remaining warriors and attacks twice. Both hit, for 25 total damage. Meanwhile the other attacker, mostly surrounded, strikes out at ape 3. Somehow, it misses the first time - the ape squirms out of the way - but catches it on the return swipe, dealing 7 damage. The one Nethza had attacked pulls a short sword and now tries for 3 attacks. Nethza's outstanding armour and agility mean that, again very surprisingly, all 3 attacks miss.

Maireagh moves in and flanks the first attacker by being across from ape 3. She hits twice, for 26 total damage. The dog attacks, flanking across from ape 4, but misses. Riglan moves across and tries to hit the same one with a fire bolt; hits for 8 damage.

Temo runs out and fires at the second attacker. **Crit!** He hits for a total of 44 damage (10d6+6!) which very much takes down that individual.

Ape 1 starts celebrating and jumping up and down on Ghald's body. Apes 3 and 4 try to attack, both with advantage. All four fist attacks find their mark, one of them a crit again, for a huge 25 of damage - taking down the attackers. Success!

The apes go ape. Riglan joins in and is busy fooling around while Nethza flies down and grabs the orb. "Maireagh! Bag! Now!" and Maireagh runs up. Nethza carefully puts in the orb. "Temo! Search them!" and Temo shouts to Riglan, "Oi, quit messing with the apes and figure out where we're gonna take this thing!". People keep a close eye on other entrances to the catacombs before we run out. Temo investigation 11+9: Temo notices that the Sahuaghin Ghald and the assassin have both turned slightly shapeless, almost featureless - a pale milky white, as if melting jelly. Not a doppelganger, so we presume some kind of magical construct or a creature akin to a doppelganger but not the same.

As Ghald starts to rapidly kind of rot down, appearing next to it we see tentacles and as Temo undoes a cloak's clasp and the cloak is removed, humidity around it is dispelled and the skin starts to quickly dry and desicate. The priest has an amulet around his (its?) neck, with an amulet that swirls and looks like a portal to the deep ocean. This is where the pulse of psychic energy came from. It's the same feeling as the room for the auction, so we're sure it's related to that group. Temo finds a silk cloth pouch on the priest and, within, sees 16 emeralds - the 16000 they would've paid. Those go straight into Maireagh's bag. There's also one platinum trade bar. That goes in too. 16500 (16,500) gold pieces or thereabouts!

We can't be sure but as he changes back into a "normal" form, Ghald starts to look very like the creature from the auction, the two attackers were definitely the dais bearers and we hazard a guess from what we saw of her so briefly, that the archer was the same woman in their party too. Only the priest seems completely unfamiliar.

We figure a strange amulet, 16,000 in emeralds and a trade bar isn't a bad start, but on top of that we find a magical dagger on the assassin. We can detect that it has an aura but don't waste time determining its function - we just bag it and get out as quickly as we can.

"What do we do about the bodies?" asks Maireagh. Riglan: Perception 21. The two fighters are present and intact, complete with armour and so-on. The other three are turning into puddles of jelly. So we can just grab all their kit, bag it hastily and get it out to essentially remove any evidence of what happened here; we'll drag the two bodies out to the surface. The apes help! Yay.

We get back to the Charnel House. Everyone there is still passed out! Riglan: Medicine 18+5. They're unconscious, not dead. A Goodberry would revive them so he casts that and we force feed it to the people in the room. There is shock and confusion for a moment, before we briefly recount the events below, and point at the two bodies we dragged into the room as evidence.

The Hand apologise profusely - that's a turn up for the books! - "This has always been a *completely* secure place - there is an understanding that nobody attacks this... All trading must stop..." We learn that the Kraken Society were sent by **Lord Drylund.** Everyone is _very_ surprised.

Riglan very briefly summarises how the cults are acting and how it feeds chaos - to disrupt evidently not just the "good" but also the "criminal". To our surprise, we are forthwith handed back a lot of spare coins - 1,600gp worth - because they say that they were under instructions to not sell for less than 15000. Riglan thanks them but Nethza comes forward - "We nearly died for this. Nearly everyone in Yartar, yourselves included. You need to tell us who is buying. Protocol be damned."

In response - "This has nothing to do with the Hand", says the curious man we hadn't figured out. "This is to do with me. I'm simply a broker of the mystic arts and powerful artefacts. My name is Brother Unferth. I am a priest and I feel it is my duty to tell you who sold this to us... Please take a seat." (We do so). "This information might be useful for you, but I *beg* of you, do not under any circumstances pass this on to the Water Baron."

We agree. We don't have much choice!

"This came to me via a representative of the Lord's Alliance. The seller is an official representative of the City Of Triboar." Nareen explains the tension between the two cities and points out that the Hand only agreed to broker the sale in order to get the orb out of the city; they don't think this is official Triboar business by any means.

Riglan discusses options for triggering the orb "safely". Unferth says, "I'm about to suggest something you're very welcome to ignore and please don't take any offence. I know of an evil force living in Yartar who has the ability to safely dispose of this. She can be trusted to not harm the city due to a delicate, symbiotic and mutual need there. How comfortable are you in dealing with the darker side of the balance?"

Riglan looks at Temo and says "some of us would rightly have grave reservations, others in our party might consider it, but it could only be considered at all if the cost was known."

"It is my understanding that she has a way to release things into a pocket dimension."

Not quite what Riglan meant but an important answer in itself! The Hand say that they'll deal with all of the other costs. Neither them nor Unferth will profit, they'd rather just write it off.

Riglan wants to hand back 600 and says, "You'll need that to make it look like an auction actually happened - call it 15,600" but Unferth refuses, saying he's got it covered. It wasn't a small commission that they were paid. Temo wisdom save: 9-1, not high enough to be wise enough to disagree! So they write down an address and tell us to go there, ignoring the signs on the building.

One person runs off immediately to make sure arrangements are sorted by the time we get there. We thank everyone, sympathise with their position, note that we appreciate their understanding of balance within the city and are about to leave when Nareen says - "Hold onto those tokens we gave you. If you ever need to find us, you can always find one of us at the Wink and those tokens will get you an audience, no questions asked. And thank you for keeping Yartar's best interests to heart."

That's lawful evil for you.

We head out. The address it on Walled Street, quite nearby. We walk slowly, keeping a constant eye out for things around (Riglan adv. perception 22 - nothing out of the ordinary). We keep to the walls so that at least one side next to us is solid! It's ended up around 10:15, according to the distant clock at Happy Hall. We make our way slowly and carefully to the given address. We arrive outside Wallheims.

That's an interesting turn of events. We all look at each other. Oh.

We knock. "Hi Aneera, it's us..." - she opens the door. "What? Wait. Wait? Oh. Oh. You. Come on in. What *have* you got yourselves into?" We explain - she already knew about the orb - but she doesn't understand why we now *own* it and have the Hand liasing with her about it! Shrug. We follow her into a room full of very strange things - "weird shit" broadly - rune stones arranged in spirals, a broken mirror glued together with honey, all manner of vials and other glass containers with liquid. "Is it still in its box? Hand it to me in its box *very carefully*. A girl was *running* with this under her arm, you say? What a fool! Simply being shaken could trigger this."

We point out that she was uncannily smooth and fast. We learn that she was a changeling, a fey creature; but very rare. Temo looks a bit shifty - "Ah, well, I guess there are three less of them now... If they're rare..." and tails off. Aneera says "I'll shed no tears for creatures of the fey that cross into this realm and cause mischief - present company excluded!"

She tells us to shield our eyes and walks to the mirror, doing some kind of incantation. The honey turns into quicksilver and the mirror expands. She pushes her hands through into whatever lies behind and she kind of flicks the lid open to throw out the orb. The mirror starts to clear; we can see it starting drizzle, then rain, then pour down, torrentially heavy. Apparently it'll go for a full day. "It needed some rain in there", she says - as she pulls her hands back we see the water level rising up the mirror.

We thank her for her trouble and say we'd better leave her in peace, but then Maireagh remembers the amulet and says, "Hey, what's this?!" - Aneera is shocked, takes a cloth and covers it immediately, wraps it up and puts it into a box.

"You must not - you - where have you had it? That's the eye of the kraken!" - we've had it in the bag of holding - but she's really worried that the Kraken might've been looking when we pulled it out of the bag. "You need to go. Be on guard. If you hear voices that are not your own, do not listen to them! I don't have the power to destroy *that*" - we offer to take it away - "well, if you are ever somewhere far from *anywhere* - any civilisation, any tombs or any ruins, leave it there. Leave it where it can see nothing of importance and harm nobody." So we take it, wrapped in cloth and in a box and stow it in the bag of holding. "Thankfully it can't hear, but it *can* see."

We leave and step out thinking of where next. Bit late for the Waterbaron? We think we'll give it a try anyway and head to the Waterbaron's Hall. It's shut of course, but there are lights on. Nethza casts Fly and makes herself and Riglan fly. Riglan carries Temo and Maireagh says she's happy to stay, so Temo insists he stays with her for safety. The bag of gems etc. are given to Riglan to bring up.

So we fly. We look in windows with light in them and Nethza tells Riglan to just knock on it but not look inside. Riglan knocks and says "Hello? Hello? Sorry, I know this is strange but can you let us in please?" - and to our surprise, nailed it first time. The Waterbaron is there. We are ushered inside quickly! We are taken down to fetch the other two from downstairs and we fill in details to the Waterbaron.

We explain that we can give back the emeralds - albeit technically stolen goods - if she's keen; she wants to restore the treasury. So we give her 10 emeralds and 10pp.

She goes to a drawer. "Hopefully not too presumptuous but I had high optimism that things would work out" and gives us **5 trade bars, as originally agreed**. We're a bit speechless. "You have done Yartar a great service, but you may have just painted a target on your back." We agree, pointing out that we think we already have a target on us and think we'll spend one last night here and then head back south to continue tackling the problem at source - the underground temples. That way, the target on us isn't also a target on Yartar.

"Very well - thank you." We bid her goodnight. "Always a pleasure! I hope you are able to push aside some of the anxieties and worry and understandable paranoia to celebrate the good you have achieved and spend maybe some of your spoils; Yartar is, after all, a wonderful place" - and smiles wryly.

She mentions that if we wanted, we can go to the treasury to easily exchange the emeralds for other forms of payment should we so need.

As the main door opens and we stand just inside, the grand outdoor steps with their wide view of the city streets ahead, the Waterbaron stops us and gestures at the many festivities going on outside. A happy buzz of colour and life. **"You have just saved all of this from being destroyed. Thank you."**

We head out.

Battle; 2500xp; solving orb; 800xp. 

We stand on the edge of the busy road in a moment of quiet contemplation. Maireagh suddenly remembers something; she pulls out the magical dagger and spends a few minutes Identifying it. She gives it to Temo, explaining that it is a Dagger of Venom. He equips it in place of his regular dagger, carefully wrapping and stowing the latter in Maireagh's bag.

Riglan looks at the bag of emeralds and rattles it - "so, bracelets or armour...?" and neither Temo nor Nethza seem able to bring themselves to spend money. We decide to wander around in bazaar a while to soak up the atmosphere. Having mentally tallied up that our currency (or gem equivalent) has temporarily peaked just over a staggering 10,000gp now, Temo whispers to Riglan on the way - "Why don't we just start our own *town* now?!"

Just South of the market is amazing tent with a commotion around it. It appears that only certain people are being allowed inside to limit crowding. Temo: Arcana 16+3. He sees a being inside that he's only seen in books, from another plane; made from mainly air, it is a Djinn, who is the seller in this pavilion. Temo points him out - "Air. Might be able to help against the Feathergales?" - so we assess options for entry. There's a queue of only around 10 people so we join the back of it. The djinn is performing magic tricks; not illusory magic, but actual physical tricks, sleight of hand and so-on. Inside it looks like its mostly about luxury items - gems, jewellery and fabrics, generally exotic. Plenty of actual magic also going on in addition to the tricks.

Eventually we get in. There are helpers of various races, including a tabaxi, half-elf, Grung (frog person) to whom Riglan feels immediate friendship and approaches. It speaks telepathically. "You are a firbolg." Riglan thinks "Yes. You are a frog." "I am not a frog. I am Grung." "My apologies. I have not met a Grung before." "Ah, we are from the far South of the continent. I was approaching the lands of the Calimshan, where the old battles of genies and genasi played out **where I met [the djinn] Adjoubi**, who had renounced the military and struck out on his own. He'd built himself a small trading empire and suggested that we make the journey up here. We were actually headed to one of the Waterdeep festivals and after that thought we'd just head up the road to look at the lantern festival, as it's one of the bigger markets in this region. They say it's the biggest market between Silverymoon and Neverwinter!"

Riglan in response says, "Well, it's nice to meet you. We're just adventurers from further north. My name is Riglan." We're asked about what we might want; anything helpful for adventuring? There are inevitably many options. He offers to introduce us to Adjoubi. As we head over Riglan explains the mental conversation realising that the others hadn't heard any of it. Maireagh fends off customers who think the dog is for sale!

Adjoubi is performing a scimitar juggling and diseappearing act. We hear half of a conversation as he responds vocally to the Grung (who we learn is nameless, because telepathy obviates the need - you can just send a literal mental image). "Welcome!" he exclaims in our direction. "So, you are after things for adventuring - come, into this _other_ tent" - and he pulls back a silk curtain that partitions into a second tent, of equal size, but much less busy. He beckons us to take a seat and he floats over some things from the sides, including a thick, sweet, rose-scented tea for us to drink. He presents:

* A small ornate box with origami-like patterns on the side which contains a small stone. With a glint in is eye he looks at Temo - "I think *you* should hold this" - Temo reaches out and the stone is placed into his hands. It immediately takes the shape of a Abyssinian cat's head made of stone, but one of the eyes is an emerald. To Temo it looks like it just winked at him. "It's a stone of good luck, or the Luckstone."

* Next up is a tiny ring which he hands to Riglan. It's made of wood with a soft white fur on the inside that feels a bit like rabbit. On top are carved two white ferrets or foxes, curled around each other. "I brought this along because I heard it was cold up north - but ah-ha! It is not in fact cold at all! So I am happy to sell this" - it is a ring of warmth.

* He produces a very weird-looking object ("Don't worry about the size of it - it's because the Grung was wearing it last...") - it's a helm with pointy ears, a loose chain-mail back, a fin on its head and googly eyes inset on each other with a sweeping bit of bridge of nose and open mouth. Maireagh already has a helmet so Nethza tries it and, inevitably, it reshapes to fit her well. As the Djinn speaks in various different languages, Nethza is unaware that he's not speaking in Common. It's the Helm Of Comprehending Languages.

* "Now, *this*..." and he pulls out a very strange looking wand that seems to have a weather station attached to it! Various coloured orbs. He activates it and it whirrs, but it doesn't actually "fire" it as it's "kind of unpredictable". It is a literal Wand Of Wander. Temo gets *that* look. "It does require atunement..."

* There's one last thing. "This is not even from this continent." It's a tool of sorts, that looks partly like a screwdriver. Maireagh's eyes widen. "Is that..." she starts - "Ah! Madam. You recognise this gnomish creation." He hands it to her. As she presses small buttons on it, the tool changes into different forms, all of different uses.

Maireagh is clearly interested so we start by asking for the price. 1025gp (the All Purpose Tool). The Helm is 400gp, 1500gp for the luckstone, 350gp for the ring and finally the wand sells for 1200gp.

We chat briefly and definitely can see a need for the tool and helm. The ring is more difficult but since we can afford it, and maybe if there's a deal to be struck, we ask for the a price on those three. Temo thanks him for showing us the wand, because it's very exciting and interesting but just a bit too random and risky for us. "Hmm, perhaps I read you wrong, not so chaotic as might be thought at first glance..." - he pulls out crackling silver bolt from his head(!) and it solidifies into another wand, this one silver and crackling. "You are clearly not people for whom money is a problem. This is my most expensive item - 2500gp - a wand of lightning bolt." Well *that* is a powerful thing.

So we ask if there's a deal to be struck over the wand, helm and tool. Temo offers the assassin's dagger - poison not his style - and tries to persuade Adjoubi for a better price (17+10 -> 27). Leaves a balance of 3,200gp. The deal is struck (he accepts 3 emeralds and 200 gold).

He slides a potion into Temo's hand and gives him a wink. "I made this myself..." - it's a gift; a potion of invisibility. "I can smell that you've had a brush with a plane of existence that's in opposition to mine - beings from the plane of evil air." Temo nods ands says, "funnily enough that's what drew us in there, thinking we might find things to help fight them."

***(We're a little nervous that Maireagh has to un-attune from her amulet providing protection against scrying; if we ever settle down into one place, we'll have to make sure we remind her to attune back to that!)***

We head out of the side-tent and he wishes us well. We thank him and depart. "Don't take it lightly when a Djinn wishes you good luck! I don't give wishes out freely haha! Good night!" and off we go.

After a bit more wandering around we make our way slowly back towards the Griffon. A few young lovers on street corners hold hands, people wander past with lanterns; the buzz falls to a soft murmur as the streets quieten. At the Griffon, the room has been cleared down and the staff look tired but happy, three of them taking a drink. We wave a greeting and squeeze into our small room, but do set the dog on watch by the door and Temo keeps his sling close.

Riglan: Perception 11+8. He hears tapping on the window, but Temo is asleep and the dog undisturbed. Riglan checks the window, with a blackbird tapping on the window, head cocked to one side. Riglan opens the window and says "hello, are you from the druids?". The bird hops into the room and transforms into Dreena, the woman from Delmond Ranch! She puts out her hand as if to reassure Riglan that she's really herself and OK, but before she gets a chance, Riglan has already grabbed her and giving her a hug so tight she's barely able to breathe. Riglan was sure she must have been killed.

"It's OK, it's me - I mean you no harm - is there somewhere we can go and talk?" - we creep out into the hallway and head down into the now-empty dining room to avoid disturbing sleeping guests.

"First of all, I know what happened. I arrived back and people were gone... I wasn't expecting that obviously, and had elven help and it was kind of awkward that we had to turn back and there was no war, but no war is good! And I find my family. I went back to the High Forest afterwards and have been learning from some lovely people - you'll never believe where it was - I've been spending the last few weeks at, well, different parts of the High Forest but I just happened to be in Shadowtop when your message arrived. So, when they were looking for someone to bring a message to you obviously it made sense for me to do it because I know you and they have this very, very useful spell called Locate Person that pointed me to where you were. And I wanted to see you because I wanted to talk to you in case you were worried. Everyone's OK. They've relocated. It's been difficult but they're settling in. I've left the family though - they'll be fine without me - I'm training to be a druid now - I guess you figured that out because I was a bird and everything... Oh, er, no, ah, yes, ah, that's right, they say, the message - that's great - Moonan is particularly looking forward to meeting Bronzefume - so I'm to accompany you down there and I'll lead Bronzefume to the forest. But enough about me! How about you?"

After a long pause, Riglan says, "We did the best we could. It wasn't what we wanted. It was a dark time and difficult result. The orcs were being played, really, by cultists and there were too many to fight."

"If it's any consolation, I think you did the right thing by the cycles of life. You preserved the most life. I came back with an army of elves and it would've been a slaughter." (Riglan just shrugs). "The ranch is lost. That part of Feyrun I think is lost to us forever now. But we had a good run there, a few generations. That doesn't mean it's ours. Human generations are very short."

Riglan summarises how things had gone since then - the fire orb being perhaps a turning point - and how we'd tried to bring the fight to them after that. She asks to accompany us and of course we're fine with that. She's able to squeeze onto a bed roll on the floor, and we fall back to sleep.



## DAY 98

We awake in the Griffon after an otherwise quiet night and resolve to resume what passes for our campaign of action down south as soon as we can. Now that we've Dreena with us, our plans change a little as we'll go into Riverguard again.

Riglan, in fact, wakes to find the other three already stood around the still-asleep Dreena. Maireagh points at her and says, "Explain."

Riglan dutifully explains! He apologises for the lack of warning but didn't want to wake them up during the night. "You know, what *could* help if something like this happens in future is to leave a note for us...?" suggests Nethza.

We pack up, check out and head to the Fest Hall to try and find a ship going down South today upon which we can book passage. On the way through the market we stock up on rations (12, for 6gp), smoked fish as a top up, with some air-dried cured venison; Maireagh also buys some beans and so-forth that can be used for soups (10gp, 20 rations equiv). We buy some baked goods as treats (a large amount! - 2gp total).

We reach the Fest Hall. Temo Charisma-based investigation: Total 15. He finds a captain headed to Goldenfields, travelling down with an empty boat intending to pick up food. He'll give us passage since it's money for nothing, almost. Given that we're "self contained" and would just need space to roll out a mat - they have a few spare hammocks too, apparently - it's not too pricey, though we're warned that it's a barge so we're on deck all the time. 2sp each, bargain - dog travels free so 1gp.

We depart at **10am on the Fat Grouse**; so we take note of the dock location and hurry to complete any remaining business since it's already 9am.

We hurry to the Morning Spire to enquire about Greater Restoration. Riglan could cast it from scroll, but only well above his level so it'd be a tricky casting with no guarantee of success. There's some debate and the High Priest is consulted; usually it's an on-site service, not done via scroll. The spell requires 100gp of diamond dust and we're told there is indeed one scroll usually used as a backup, and that'd be 600gp - which includes the dust within the ink. Riglan doesn't hesitate and hands that over, thanking her profusely while apologising for the unusual request & that we're taking a "backup" of sorts.

* Must state clearly before casting what it is that the spell is to achieve. It can do many things - but only one of those at a time.
* Maireagh notes that she can understand the scroll too, so she could try to cast it as well. Riglan and her both would have equal chance of success (D20 plus spell mod 5, DC 15).
* Neither Temo nor Nethza can cast the spell.

We're at the docks and by the barge for 10am. Final loading and setup is happening. The Captain is pleased that we have (visibly!) so little kit. A few more little bits and pieces are loaded - other side-jobs apparently - but the boat does indeed have plenty of room.

We wait for 10 minutes or so until the harbourmaster indicates that we can depart via complicated flags and a coin thrown to someone on-shore. With that, we're away. We push out via pole to the main stream and there, a small sail is hoisted.

Sitting astern, we see Yartar with the sun rising over the mountains and High Forest to the East, casting beautiful long shadows over the city. Another day of the lantern festival is starting, most people unaware of the closely-averted catastrophe. Other barges and ships are docking as we leave, one or two with familiar faces and people waving. One shouts over, "No rest for the wicked, I see! All the best to you! You are doing good work and we thank you!" and they wave. We shout back thanks.

The city falls away into the distance.

As things settle down into a rhythm after the business of departure, we spend time speaking to the crew. There are strange goings-on around the region as far afield as the woods around Neverwinter - all along the Triboar Trail, things seem to be influenced. Giants are on the move in many places, and it's been a generation or so since they were last a problem in populous areas. Hill giants are mostly the issue, but even some fire giants. Hobgoblin, ogre and orc raids have been increasing. People seem to largely be blaming the dragon war, and some it might indeed be that, but of course we personally know of other causes.

Riglan feels a rising sense of alarm in fear of safety of his own home. He knows now that Lurkwood isn't really all that far north, against the rest of the continent.

Even down South, they wonder what is happening. A season of peace and respite from the prior turmoil had yielded a good summer and a sense of things recovering, but there scattered news reports indicate things perhaps going awry again already, as far south as Daggerford, starting to reach Goldenfields.

It seems the crew finds it easy to talk to us as we're clearly not nobles (!) from our clothing and there only seem to be two buckets; nobles or commoners. We're quite happy with that.

They note a big change in the last week or two on the river - and this for once is good news. It started with the barges taking the missing goods to Yartar and people started to venture out as they saw traffic, which became a self-perpetuating positive cycle. There's safety in numbers.

By the end of the first day, we're already nearly out of the Dessarin Hills. They don't run overnight so we end up mooring against pegs hammered into the riverside. We have the choice of sleeping on the boat or on the deck. We elect for the land, but close to the boat, knowing (but not voicing the worry) that there have been a lot of reports of monsters etc. but only on the land, not yet affecting the river, so there's a chance that the people from the crew on the bank might get attacked.

A watch is set up, two people per watch, which we join (along with the dog, at which they marvel once they get to know it - Maireagh is always happy to talk about her work and is soon helping out fixing a few things on the boat and even a pair of boots).

One of the crates is opened and a couple of bottles of ale are offered for sharing. We thank them and this seems a perfect opportunity to drink our two bottles of bubbly cider, since once opened they need to be finished else they'll go flat. Fresh bread baked from Yartar is brought out too. Good good and drink for the night - Riglan forages some greens to help things along too.

Maireagh and Nethza have a good watch, tho Temo finds himself quite sleepy. Riglan's a little better off but not much (we let Dreena sleep - she's not used to our watch schedule and we find it easier to get ourselves back into the habit sooner rather than later given the inevitable trials ahead).

It's a quiet night. Riglan notices during his watch some owls in the trees nearby, sitting, hooting and looking at us. Riglan says hello. The owl says, "What are you doing here?" "We are travelling and just spending the night here" "Where are you going?" "We are following the river - that way" (he points). "Are you going South?" "Yes" "South is good. We are thinking of going South too." "Yes, there are strange things happening here. We think it should be safe by spring." The owls that there are constant tremors; not the usual burrowing beasts. Something else. They don't like it. Apparently it's less bad South. Riglan suggests that if they decide later that they want to come back, they could try again in spring.

They hoot quietly and fly away to look for rats as the sky is lightening in the East and they've only got a short while left before bed.

Dawn breaks.



## DAY 99

There is a simple, hot breakfast that has something to do with oats and then we're back on the water. We ask them if it's OK to drop us on the Western bank just after the Stone Bridge - we'll show them where, since that's where last left our own skiff. The barge moves quickly and passes Stone Bridge at about 10:30am. Riglan (survival total 17) easily spots the location where we hid the boat and we're pulled over.

We jump onto shore. Maireagh and Riglan get their feet a bit wet but we're otherwise fine. Since Riglan is paddling anyway he lifts the dog ashore and we wave our thanks to the crew. "It's been great sailing down with you," says the Captain - "thanks for the cider and happy travels; see you back in Yartar!" and off they go.

It takes a while to dig out or boat from the now very-dried branches and leaves that were laid over it, but it is, luckily, very much still there. Maireagh remarks at how badly hidden it seems to be. It was better when the leaves were green!

We get aboard and start to make our way downstream. We elect to bypass the monastery for now since it's always good to have an excuse to make sure we get back and see Renwick properly some time - the ingot isn't urgent and is safe with him. That said, we do spot our boat from the underground river still tied up by the monastery dock so we pause briefly to tie it to ours and in the end Dreena uses it for practice, since she says she'll be leading Bronzefume upriver in one. With shock we realise that this means taking Bronzefume straight past Yartar - but of course, it's the only way that the creature could possibly get close to Shadowtop.

It takes the rest of the day to reach the exit of the Sumber Hills; we pull into Riverguard Keep at around 10pm, perhaps a little later than we'd hoped, but it's a nice feeling to go in there with the entrance open and knowing it's safe (ish!) place. There are lights on and people present. We head up to the small middle dock we originally used and tie up. We're greeted by someone who brings us up to date on recent changes; we they're chatting with us we see some dwarves around a bonfire on the courtyard who wave at us and Maireagh heads over to chat. It turns out that they're from the Adbar Trading Coster and want to finish fixing up Riverguard properly. They say that they've sent word North because they've recognised how important the Keep is to the dwarven people - we keep quiet about Tyar Besil, given that we know how dangerously powerful things are down there.

Nestra Rutheol (the Water Baron) had made a good point, they say, about this being about half way between Goldenfields and Yartar, with roads between Goldfields, Waterdeep and Daggerford under repair; they see a big future for this Keep as a keystone part of a higher capacity, faster trade route. A great stopover point which could be made a good safe-haven for travellers. We note an enthusiasm that reminds us of Maireagh at Owlbear Tower; it seems perhaps a dwarven trait to "see" a better future a place of stone and want to be a part of making it happen. Thinking back, Riglan realises he saw a bit in Gundren too, once the lust for coin and power were taken out of the equation, when we most recently saw him at the Wave Echo Cave mines with a clearer vision of its future potential.

We know there's space in the main Keep and it's got plenty of space, albeit tidied up - traces of the previous inhabitants, alive or otherwise, have been cleared. The kitchen is stocked and the dining room clearly in use, albeit empty at the current late hour. People had found themselves getting swept up with the minor tidying, then repairs, then it feels familiar, and days turn to weeks and suddenly it's home, or not too far from it.

We settle in for night.
