# Campaign Four

The ongoing adventures of firbolg Riglan, halfing rogue Temo, dwarven artificer Maireagh and sorceress tiefling Nethza.



## Part 1
### Ranger

New friends are taken on the road. The search leads us to strange elemental cults of both earth and fire. Following those encounters the party tries to reach the High Forest but is waylaid and becomes embroiled in a terrible last-stand battle between farmers and orcs that claim ownership of the same lands; it is unclear if anyone will survive.



## Part 2
### Druid

The overall campaign arc is a heavily adapted variant of the Lost Mine of Phandelver. By the end of the campaign, our party, successful in securing and restarting the forge at Wave Echo Cave, has travelled to Yartar. Mysteries are discovered but things become overwhelming and, in the end, we elect to travel South; this campaign ends as we depart for new adventures.



## Part 3
### Warrior

A dangerous artefact is destroyed, lest it destroy us instead. A plot to destroy Yartar leads us deeper into the mysteries of the elemental cults and underground, to strange temples and encounters with terrible creatures, in a search for people we believed had been killed long ago, but have since learned may yet live. Our limits are tested and we nearly fall; can we push further, or is it too late for any hope of rescuing those we seek?



## Part 4
### Family

Our world is threatened by the terrible elemental gods. Most are trapped in their planes, but our oldest foe has eluded us for long enough to bring one through. Let battle commence!
