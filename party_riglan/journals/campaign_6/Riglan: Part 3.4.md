# Riglan: Part 3.4
## Day 14 ("day" 11 in Shadowfell, day 10 of 15-day cycle)

In the morning, we figure Mid City and the Fair; start asking around, listening, looking for posters or acts that might give us clues about Nethza. We head out.

Riglan looks for posters and the like, while Temo chats to people, turning on the charm; Maireagh goes with Temo when the group is split. Riglan has his animals to call, if he gets in trouble.

Riglan, dirty 20 perception; doesn't see anything relevant. Quite a few businesses are closed anyway - nighttime places - but some are open, including the Fair(ground) itself - an open-air affair, with stages and a courtyard for gathering.

Temo, 31 investigation! 19+12. He gets a few leads, at least. It's not like a female purple tiefling is unique here, but the first lead he gets is one saying she was recently there looking for work - 4-5 days ago, a fire juggler/dancer - that fits. Had no work, so pointed her towards another place. And that has a similar story, and on, a chain of leads; Temo can imagine Nethza's desperation as she tries over and over to find work.

Eventually he gets a lead to a venue, **The Shadow Dancers** about 4 days ago. It's been about an hour for both groups and we'd agreed to meet back up after that. We compare notes and agree to look at that venue straight away (though Riglan says it'll probably be closed but might open later). The door is shut, but Riglan tries knocking! Investigation, only 17 this time. Temo's looking around. There's a side-entrance, a stone archway, that seems a service entrance. He calls over - "Let's try in here!" and disappears inside.

The archway opens into a courtyard, looks like it's for deliveries or similar, at the back of the building. Another door here - we try knocking again. If there are people inside, they might be towards the back of the building, rather than in the empty performance and bar areas presumably at the front. Indeed - it opens! A human man, a little portly, stands there; he has a handlebar moustache and a slightly scraggy, bushy, wiry beard. "Yes? What is it? What are you after?" he asks.

Temo launches into his spiel, adding that he'd be happy to recompense the man for any information. Temo also describes Nethza. He invites us in - "I wouldn't normally do this - but you look as desperate as Nethza was when she came here. I told her we couldn't promise anything, but in the end she did two performances that night; she was decent - but must've caught the eye of someone because the next night the whole space was bought out by a private viewer. I can't tell you who it is - not if I want to keep my head! We weren't even allowed to be here. Whatever her performance was that night, though, it must've left an impression. The next day an emissary came from the Inner City. I still don't know if it was the right thing to do... They paid us handsomely for exclusive rights to her performance; she agreed and went with them. They paid *hundreds* of gold. She gave them to me and said I was to deliver it to the soup kitchen as an anonymous donation. And I did! I did as she asked. I haven't seen her since and I still don't know if what I did was right... All I can tell you is that she's in the Inner City now. So you're not going to be able to find her. I'm sorry, my friend. Was she dear to you?"

We explain that it's an understatement.

"All I can say to help you is that the person who came to negotiate that transaction was wearing an amulet, with five stars..." - he doesn't need to finish the sentence. He sees the expression on our faces.

Riglan asks if there's anything else. "They went via the Griffon Gate. I'll give you this card..." - he fishes it out - his name and the name of the establishment. Writes a note on the back. "Take this to the Chapter House of the Order of Scribes. Hopefully they will show you *something* that might help you find her. In the mean time I'll have to live with this guilt. But I hope you do find her. She has a light in her... It's quite special."

Temo looks to him. He's sad more than angry. "We do what we must to survive. The money went to help people. It did good. She'll know that. She'll bear no malice. Neither do we. Be free of guilt. Your card will help us. Your story help us. You didn't turn us away."

It's complex, there are disparities in days and nights counted in the tales, but people don't remember things with perfection. The guy in front of us has the most recent memory and it was the day before yesterday that the trade was made and she left with this emissary, in the morning. So we're about 2-2.5 days behind. We're closing in, but she's in ever increasing peril, it seems!

We head out. Riglan looks at Temo angrily but he sees the look on Temo's face and sucks it up. "OK" says Riglan. "We've done plenty of impossible things before, so now we have to do an impossible thing again and get into that city. Let's take this card to the Order of Scribes. I'm sick of asking for directions; let's try to find a bookshop or mapmaker for a city map!"

While looking for an appropriate bookshop - we actually find the Chapter House first! Beautiful stone building, heavy wooden doors, big brass... knockers... Temo opens his mouth to speak and breathes in - and Maireagh just says, "No." Riglan says "Well, now it just feels *wrong* using these..." but knocks using the knockers.

Door opens. A younger person, short hair; "May I help you? Are you lost?" ("Are you lost" - fucks sake, we get that a lot!) - we show the card. He looks at it, then looks quickly left/right along the street, ushers us in quickly and shuts the door quickly. We're led down a beautiful tall storey, 2.5 storeys high - 20ft - a very beautiful building inside as well as out. Alcoves along this hallway have ladders and each is stacked full of shelves of books and scrolls.

It opens up into a room where a woman is leant over a circular stone table covered in open charts and scrolls. A middle-aged man is descending a ladder from an adjoining alcove of what amounts to an apse, central perhaps, long corridor carrying on ahead, shorter to the left and right. "Matron. They bear a card. You said that if anyone were ever to show up bearing this symbol you were to bring them to you..." - she checks. Looks surprised.

"I'm **Matron Bethany**. This is our young scribe **Benjamin**. This is **Tomas**, my assistant. You - how did you come upon this card?"

We relay a short version of the story.

She responds, "Alright. I think I know what you need. Whatever this is, it must be realm-shaping for him to invoke such an ancient pact between our orders..." - we're taken into a side apse and Tomas is sent up a ladder for various documents described by numbers. As he's doing that, Riglan says, "Realm-shaping? I suppose, could be more realm-ending. But isn't it always, in our lines of work?"

Tomas returns with a large scroll. Benjamin is sent off to make sure the front door is *locked*. Bethany lays down a compass in the middle of a table and taps it; it shimmers; a bubble/dome appears around all of us. Benjamin reappears, looking confused; we are hard to see; but he walks into the dome with us.

The scroll is unrolled. It is a map. We need to memorise directions, because we can't make a copy. It's a city map, so that's Temo's wheelhouse. Maireagh looks closely too, in case she needs to help him later. "This is the last known copy of an old service tunnel map that connects up different parts of the city underground." Riglan can't help but chuckle - "Now you're talking." "I don't know why you need this. I hope it has what you need!" - she shows us where we are, and the closest entrance.

She's no idea what lives down there now. Nobody uses the tunnels as far as she knows, not for decades. The map itself is around 120 years old! They're used by smugglers, perhaps - Riglan concedes that if anything, there's probably a criminal element that actively uses such things.

The inner city has a "secret police", Carpathian police, who have a great interest in controlling movement of people and information in and out of the Inner City. We will need to be very, very careful.

We continue to study the map. Inner City maps haven't been allowed for years, since its gates closed, but they do have some very old ones. Together, it is deduced from the historical records that certain exits - Bethany points them out - "are known; this is an old noble family's crypt; this is under what we believe the Library Of The Congress - the Carpathia; and this leads to a noble's estate; and this leads to what used to be a playhouse." "Like a theatre?" "Yes, I guess, like a theatre. And this last one leads to one of the few remaining gardens."

We guess that playhouse or noble estate might be a starting point. Assuming that whoever took Nethza wants her for her performance skills anyway.

Getting in via tunnels could work but remaining undetected would be difficult. The tunnels might be more useful for escape and reconnaissance, says Tomas, but then once we have a bit of inside knowledge, we can use that to back up a claim that we should be allowed within - by bluffing someone and **buying** our way in. We'd need to set ourselves up as a trade of some kind. If we had any support of Dukes or Baronesses out in the country it would help too.

* We'd need a trade that convincingly could create wealth.
* We'd need a trading empire.
* We have Carpathian talismans! We don't have anything from the Fahrlays.

We could:

* Say we're miners, of sorts.
* Enchanting items with magic - we carry numerous examples. We can even point to the dog as an example of talent within the trade.
* The mine - we have the first ingot, stamped, so we can prove our wealth and a reason for its origin - the material of the ingot is easy to verify.
* We caught the attention of the Inner City because of this rise in wealth and the artefacts it could produce; an emissary was sent, our presence was requested and the talisman was given as proof - after all, how else could one possibly have it?

The thing we need from reconnaissance is the *what* we will do once in the Inner City. We can't say yet. If we can find traders, shops or institutions we could name, saying we've been asked to head there, that might do it.

It's good enough for now. We thank the three. The scrolls/maps are rolled back up and the protective bubble comes down. Tomas heads to put them away and we're being taken towards the front door - when a chilling wind sweeps down the corridor. Candles and lights flicker. Just the wind...? Riglan tries Detect Magic. He detects the fading ward from the compass back down the corridor. We of course have several magic items. A few books have weak magic. Nothing else. Riglan says, "I don't know what that was. No magic I can see. Could just be the wind, but... Well, take care - keep your eyes open - be ready for weird stuff!"

Tomas finishes putting the scrolls away. **We change from the front door to the side entrance** and exit that way!

Riglan asks Temo if there's anywhere Temo can find that gives us a vantage point - a tower, a rooftop, or similar. Temo looks around - several local buildings are taller. Towers are all on the inner ring. But there is a tower about 5-6 storeys high not too far away in our section... We're not sure what it is. We head there. It's towards the west, in a mid-city manufacturing area. It's called "The Academy", we see upon arrival. Large double doors are closed; the tower is square, stone. Steps lead up to the doors and on either side are tall, rectangular windows. Riglan walks up and peers into the left-hand window; perception 19; wipes some soot off the outside first; seems to be a workshop *showroom* of some kind - lots of long tables, with equipment that seems on display. He calls to the others, "some kind of displays, or maybe a sales room?" and knocks on the door. Nobody answers. He tries the door handle and it opens; nobody's shouting at us; so we all go inside.

There are lots of pieces of equipment over around 8 tables, a central open area to stand in and a central hanging light, with plaques or cards describing what they are, with a string of numbers that might be date. Inside we realise there are very few windows - widely spaced - giving a lot of interior wall space for paintings, or drawings, that seem to be schematics. Maireagh can't quite figure out what they're for. She looks further and sees one thing; a large metal drill bit. We see stairs off to one side leading up with a small room tucked underneath, with a closed door. Temo knocks on that door. Footsteps! "Someone there?" "Yes, sorry, hope you don't mind, the door was open!" - the footsteps are coming down the stairs.

It's a strange-looking - actually rat-faced! - man, wearing loose hanging clothes, kaftan. He explains that this is an **engineering academy**. The front desk isn't manned on Thirdsdays and Fifthsdays, so he didn't hear the door; he's the caretaker. He wouldn't normally let people upstairs into the workshops unless they've business with the academy... Temo tries to be persuasive, and (dirty 20) he relents. He goes up with us as a chaperone, taking us to the top floor for a view. There's a roof access; he opens a trapdoor hatch of sorts, and we pop up onto the roof. There's a low ledge but no railing. We head up, he doesn't follow. Riglan calls down, "We'll be back in a minute, thank you!"

Riglan explains a few things - we'd bonded somewhat that time we got up on Owlbear Tower. It's a bit like that. And he should hate this place really; dying everything, undead everywhere; yet these people hang onto hope. Ezra. Somehow he's starting to like it; or at least the people. This kind of hope in the face of hopelessness.

The view tells us that there are a lot of much taller buildings but almost all of those are in the inner city. A few are now visible in mid city, and we realise the scale of things, too; this is probably a big - as best we can remember - as Waterdeep, from our brief visit. The inner city might be 6 by 6 city blocks or so. The tall wall between mid and inner cities hides a lot of the details there, we can only see the tops of things. What we *do* get is the impression that it's pretty much a city within a city. Some connection between the tunnel map and the scale of this in the real world is made.

We head back down, thanking the man who let us see the view.

### Roughly 1-2pm

We decide to try and enter the tunnels. Temo can't figure out an entrance here (history only 8) but we know there's one near the Order, because they told us, so we head back to that block and look around. He finds the right location, he thinks; from the street, on the side of a building, are cellar doors. We could open them and go down into the cellar, then from there, access the tunnels. The cellar doors are, though, in full view of the street.

There's a vague plan of a minor illusion of a barrel that needs to be rolled, but he can't do rolling so he'd have to move the illusion in time with Riglan pretending to roll it. Instead - D20 + spellcasting mod -> 12+3->15 - he decides to create a big stack of barrels so it looks like we're loading if anyone is watching. Maireagh goes down first, Riglan next, then Temo. Maireagh has a light up when we arrive.

A dozen large barrels are here on each side of the wall, some larger casks towards the back. Temo, investigation 22; he finds a hidden entrance! It's a lever that moves a cask. So we pull the lever, head inside, close the door behind us - Temo has to use Mage Hand to operate the lever again - and get lights up.

We're at the top of a flight of stairs, heading downwards as far as the eye can see. We realise we definitely need darkvision here, so Riglan casts it, Temo puts on his goggles and we cautiously start our descent. A corner; another corner; we've descended maybe about 20ft, nothing much more. It's a bit damp - actually, *humid* but cold. There is even some condensation on some stone at the tunnel side, which is lined with blockwork. It's well built.

Temo has a sense of direction as he's remembering the map better having come in from the 'studied' entrance now. History 15+4. Forward, first left, second right...

We're not rushing. We're listening for things, watching for things, and trying to be quiet while Temo focuses. Adv stealth:

* Temo 32!
* Riglan only 11
* Maireagh 8

...OK, so not very stealthy at all. Noises echo down the stone halls. Perception adv: Another crappy two rolls for Riglan; 2,8+9 -> only 17. Drips, occasional scuttling noises, wind whistling sometimes; hard to say if they're near or far, given the echoing hallways.

We've no idea if we've been heard, we might've been followed, we've no idea! But we certainly don't encounter anyone. There are no confrontations.

Temo stops. "Well, technically we should be here... I remembered the closest exit that we could find, but there are others." So, edge of the inner city. But how do we get up and get something like a spider out there, to look around?

There's a small alcove to our right that looks different to other parts of the tunnel. Riglan decides to go first, stairs to the right; he asks Temo to have a look and see if he can spot anything that might be a trap; perception is only 11+5, but seems OK. No marks for glyphs or obvious mechanical things. **This is a bit strange. Seems too easy.**

Cautiously, Riglan heads up what turn out to be two flights of stairs, doubling back on themselves. A stone wall is present at the top of the stairs! Riglan looks for something that might be some kind of mechanical option; a stone that looks like it might move, a lever, or anything. Perception 25; nothing, but the stone wall in front has a clear line, some kind of door it seems. Detect Magic. It is not a magical door. There's a general air of magic around though; a low-lying sort of baseline of necromantic magic, almost in the air. Similar feel to the Quiet Woods.

Riglan tries to push the door - firmly, but also smoothly and carefully. He doesn't want to tumble out into another room, or in full view in the street or something! Athl check, pointless nat 20! 27 total... But it doesn't budge. He has to put his shoulder into it and push really hard; there's a clunk and initial scrape - as if something was gummed up or trapped at first - not been used in ages - but fortunately after that it is smooth. It pushes away from him at first on all sides, but then swings on some kind of pivot at the left. He calls softly behind for the others.

There are *lots* of cobwebs. It looks like a cellar, but seems (very) disused. There are wooden curved forms that look like barrels would sit on them, but there are no barrels; there are what look like drainage channels carved in the floor, but they're full of dirt and muck. At the far end of the room is a ramp leading to a flat trapdoor, not bifold cellar-style doors but a smaller affair. That *might* lead up into another room. The trapdoor rests on a stone rim on all sides except the hinge; there's a small gap around the hinge - a small spider might squeeze through. No light either way.

Riglan calls the spider - small, fey, 6 hours. He holds it up to the hinge and asks it to take a look. He looks through its senses. It is in another cellar; this one has barrels - seems to be in use. It's underneath quite a large barrel - which means the large barrel is **positioned over the trapdoor**. Riglan quietly relays information (he figures he can Misty Step and try to move the barrel).

The spider ventures out into the middle of the room. It's larger; a main cellar. Various shelves. Some kind of cart or trolley. Crates with bottles near a ramp by one wall. More than half the room has barrels - the side we're on!

Riglan tries to *listen*. Perception with spider's stats; it moves up the ramp; natural 19+0. Up the ramp it can see a door, not a trapdoor or cellar door. It listens near there. It doesn't hear anything - this is surprising; perhaps this isn't a tavern? It should be around 3-4pm, so it would be quiet but not *empty*. A private residence cellar, of some expensive lord & lady perhaps? The spider is only about 20-30ft away right now, so it has a fair distance to travel before Riglan loses contact with it.

There's plenty of space around the draughty door. The spider sees dim light; it's at the end of a ~10ft long hallway; at the end is a corridor that seems to run left-right. On the walls, an unlit torch - perhaps used when someone comes down to the cellar? Riglan has the spider move to the ceiling for safety and proceed to the t-junction. It's not too stealthy (adv stealth 7,11+4->15) - it's enough - it flattens against the ceiling as someone dressed like a maid walks by, holding a big tub of linen.

The spider heads the other way (if she's carrying linen she's probably just going to a washroom). It pops out in a 20x20ft room. Long table in the middle. Some sinks along the side. Bench, cabinets, three people sat; one polishing things, one folding and ironing linen and another with some kind of ledger open. Perception flat 11, can't see what's in the book; someone else walks in too, to pick something up. All look like servants. They look harried, too, not happy. The one with the ledger says, "Where are they? Oh my goodness! It's so unreliable. If only we had access to more people that could just work on short notice for this goddamned gala tonight!" 

All four pitch in, in turns, sometimes talking more or less together... "Now calm down, you're making a huge fuss out of it - we've done this before. They'll be here - just running a bit late - besides, you know all the important jobs have to be done by permanent staff. They're only good at the simple things. We don't have time to train them. We just need the extra hands. How many do you have coming?" "I asked for as many as I could! They said they could only send eight." "Eight?! Are we only getting *eight* to help out today?" "Calm down, don't *you* start..." - and so it goes on.

This is an opportunity! We can be wait staff! We need to find a rear entrance or something to "make our appearance". Spider goes the other way, following where it saw the first maid going. Maybe there. This is, indeed, a wet room as expected. There's a well in one corner and various tubs. The linen has been dumped here. There's a door up a couple of steps - looks exterior. That's it.

There's the matter of the barrel. Riglan explains the plan; we're onboard; Maireagh has to put the dog in the bag of holding! Never done *that* before. It's not happy... But it does it. Riglan uses the spider eyes to see an empty space in the cellar above and uses Misty Step. Next, he tries to *quietly* push the barrel - by pulling/pushing at the "foot" on which the barrel rests - athl check and wut, **another nat 20** -> 27. The barrel moves easily! Huh? He lifts it up. Empty. Facepalm. He opens the trapdoor and everyone comes up; the trapdoor and barrel are returned to their prior position and Temo tries to make sure that there are no obvious scrape marks or lines in the dust on the floor by scuffing things around with his foot.

The spider moves into the hallway t-junction to keep watch; Riglan casts Disguise Self. He checks in with spider and, after a couple of minutes, the maid walks past with an empty basket.

Riglan uses the staff to cast Pass Without A Trace and we head out, hoping not to be heard in these echoey, stone corridors. We get to the external wooden door and open it; we're now in a courtyard. Can't see far! Linen hanging all around. Quietly close the door; we try to get a better look, in case anyone inside asks us "well how did you get into the courtyard!?" when we try to bluff our way back in as "the help". There are a couple of trees, a garden gate with a wooden door set into the wall of the courtyard. Looking back at the building, the part we're near is quite plain; bricks laid on top of a lower stone section. Either side and around it, we see the main, more impressive part - square, blocky stone columns, in-out-in-out size patterns, black and white pattern brickwork elsewhere in diamond shapes, gargoyles on corners of the building and, further set back still, beautiful, 10ft high chapel-like glass windows. And that's just the first floor! The second has more of the brick and column stuff, smaller windows, small Juliet balconies every 3rd window or so; finally, a third floor, tapered in a little, steep (French empire style) shingled roofs, concave curving upwards sharply, decorative wrought iron decorations on top. Then a flag.

Temo says, "Even for *me* that's a bit much..."

Riglan uses the spider to get onto the courtyard wall to try and figure out *where* we are relative to streets or other ways we might've come in. It's easy enough - just outside the garden gate, it's the street. A tidy sidewalk, cobbled street, beautiful wrought iron decorative street lamps, banners hanging off them. A carriage goes past, drawn by a grey horse with blinkers; the coachman has a short, brimmed hat - almost a top hat - and high-collar, white shirt with a navy riding coat.

OK, so that's that. The spider is brought back and we put on our game faces; Riglan knocks sharply on the door we just went through. He waits a moment then tries knocking again, louder. "Wait, hold on!" we hear from inside. Footsteps. The door opens. It's the ledger woman, middle-aged. "Um, oh, you're early... It's good... Where are the rest?"

Quick as a flash, Temo says "They found 3 more; very last minute; we got here early, the other 8 are coming." Deception - through desperation the DC is very low; good thing too, Temo only gets 11. Barely enough. We give our names are introduced as "**Remo, Tegan and Larry**".

We're given aprons and clothing is figured out - Maireagh has all her armour, Riglan's is hidden by Disguise Self and Temo's just fancy. We'll need white shirts - no problem, we have those. The aprons are dark for now, but tonight when we get changed we swap to the clean white aprons. For now we have to help with prep. We're needed most in the kitchen, but if we're better at moving furniture... Riglan/Remo figures that, but Temo/Tegan and Maireagh/Larry do the kitchen.

Riglan ends up in a large hall, from a servant's entrance. A grand foyer. People on ladders, banners going up, polishing chandeliers - seems all very last-minute - "James! James! Someone who can help you. This is *Bebo*". Riglan calls up, "James. Hi. I'm Remo, apparently." "We need help. Are you strong?" "Yes" "We need the tables in here taken over next door to the furniture store room; this space needs to be empty." "No problem" "And don't drag then!"

Riglan has easily enough strength to do this without any problem. Once it's cleared, carpets are rolled out. Riglan notes it's a bit worn. The furniture, too, is sturdy - but not fancy. A couple of people come in from outside via the main entrance with rolls of carpet too, wrapped in cloth, they untie them and lay those out. These are *beautiful*, so what they *own* isn't as fancy as what they're *hiring* - this is about keeping up appearances.

Riglan's trying to chat while he moves things around to ask about who the people that live there are, but all those nat 20s yield the universal balance of persuasion nat 1+3, for a grand total of 4. Stilted conversations yield nothing. One person says, "Look kid - best policy I've heard is to stick to your own business and get out from underfoot. The last thing we want to happen is being noticed by any of the guests around here, or to do something that makes you stand out."

Riglan continues to pitch in and help wherever he can. At one point he's taken outside. There's a huge crate, walk-in size, which seems to have been unloaded off a nearby *huge* wagon. More tables. They need to go inside; one is beautiful, ornate, "This is very heavy! The two us can try first but we might need extras. This is the centrepiece, it goes right in the middle above the central flower of the carpet."

Atl adv 24. "You're a lot stronger than you look!" - it's beautiful, really. Marble topped, brass cornered table with claw feet. I mean, a bit much, but the workmanship is undeniable. It's heavy but as he carries it Riglan just chats, as if the weight nothing, "Oh my usual day job is guard duty but they're calling in all the favours!" "I'm not one to look a gift donkey in the mouth. You're definitely helping me get on top of this today. There's always more work getting this place in shape than the lady realises..." Riglan risks asking, "Yes, some amount of 'keeping up appearances' it seems?" "It's the story everywhere, I'm pretty sure. I've worked for **Lady Ecrit** for 20 years, so I'm not sure what condition the other estates and manors are in - but you don't put your best out on the daily! I don't know why this always has to happen, but she puts on a fancy party every couple of months. Somehow her and her kids - *awful* people, just *awful!* - they somehow keep finding money. As long as they keep paying us, I'm not asking any questions!" "Amen!" answers Riglan.

The table is placed. A knock at the door. Someone calls, "Bonjour, le fleur? Flower? Flowers?" - well, whatever the equivalent of French is in D&D Shadow Fell! "Oh, bring them in!" calls James. An older lady with a high bun hair and glasses, a procession of younger men behind all carrying armfuls of flowers. They set up in the room, including in the middle of the table we just placed. It's all very beautiful but *completely* over the top.

Riglan keeps going until he's able to get free and head to the kitchen. It's a good hour or so - he's mindful, as his disguise might be wearing off soon! In the nick of time he tells Riglan to head to another room and he'll join Riglan there in a minute - he just has some paperwork to sign off. Riglan walks into the room - a parlour - and quickly re-casts (with a spell slot) Disguise Self. Here, the huge floor-to-ceiling glass windows are visible. In fact, they seem to be terrace doors as one is open out to a terrace onto the street. The whole house is slightly raised up on stair-step blockwork, maybe 3ft, above street level.

The parlour hasn't been started on yet. Looks like it needs dusting, ordinary-looking furniture to replace... So, same story here. Swapping furniture, cleaning stuff. There are even crates of books to be put on shelves for decoration only! It's a complete mixture of types, though there's a consistent beautiful design to spines - gardening, cooking, accounting, history, all sorts. And a harp is brought into the room, because of course it is.

Others have arrived to help now and Riglan sees a chance to slip away. He heads down to the kitchen to see what's what.

Maireagh has a scowl... She has a baker's hat of some kind on her and Riglan suspects that this much of the reason for her ire. She's also up to her elbows in dough and flour. She gives him a look and then looks sideways to a stack of trays that have to go into the oven. Temo is next to her - they're been making trays and trays of ridiculous-looking small canapes the whole time.

Temo says, "Riglan. Riglan! It's like I was born to do this. This is the *best* *day* *ever*!" - but Maireagh looks even more angry. She says to Riglan, "There is *no nutritional value* in these..." Riglan whispers to her, "Gods Maireagh, I'm so sorry, but this is for Nethza - we have to stick at it..."

It's getting on 6pm and probably not long until Riglan needs a *third* Disguise Self. Some of the other cooks arrive and say that it looks actually like they're caught up mostly thanks to Temo & Maireagh's help; they just a few more dessert canapes to make. They also say that there's *no main food* after all - just trays and trays of this stuff. Nobody sits to dine!

### 5:30pm

The matron comes in. She sees the three of us together and thanks us; we've got an hour break - back at 6:30, gala starts at 7pm. OK! So now we know it's 5:30pm. We say no worries, we'll be in white, see you in an hour. "And *please*, when you come back in, use the entrance you used before. The front is going to be *full* of guests." "No problem".

So we head out the back door. A few other workers head out too. We actually have an excuse to be here temporarily, so can wander the streets, maybe? Is it safe?

Once we're out of sight of workers who are still within the laundry (!) Riglan opens the door in the wall and drop his spell as he walks through. The other two follow. Riglan asks Maireagh to take the dog out of the bag too.

It's a wide street. Beautiful plane trees line it. It's a sort of decadent, gothic style of architecture; it's residential, with beautiful estate-like houses similar to the one we were in, interspersed with other beautiful, grand buildings that are almost municipal, or maybe academic. Perhaps this is a university district. Here and there is a bigger building, no gardens, courtyard or similar, made of stone and rising 60-80ft, a tower or cathedral-style building with a spire.

We wander a long for several minutes. It's encouraging that nobody has batted an eyelid, though nobody seems to walk on the street - most are in carriages. It seems a class division. As we travel, Riglan talks about how he hopes to overhear an institution, or business or similar that is related to our story of making magic items and is something we could use to bluff our way into the inner city. Temo and Maireagh stop short and Riglan carries forward a bit - turns around, "What?" "We're *already **IN** the Inner City!*" exclaims Temo.

Oh. Yes!

We reach a big square; a central building, lots of open courtyard all around, a brass statue of a girl with pigtails hugging a teddybear; various seats outside. Windows in the building are all recessed into stone alcoves. Stairs lead to front doors. Lanterns hang off the front. The inside has a beautiful, golden glow to the light. In fancy gothic block font above the door, a brass plaque reads, "Tummil's". First, the statue; any plaque or info? Yes, in the front. "Dedicated to Harold Tummil The First's granddaughter, who inspired all the toys." Ah, so it's a toy shop. But is it a magical toy shop?

Partly to test the waters on how we are treated, we elect to go in. Temo leads, in his bright clothing - we think this is a toy shop - Maireagh and dog behind, then Riglan.

There's a guy at the front door - a doorman - who looks us up and down. Temo persuasion only 6+13->19. The gentleman stops working. Looks at us curiously. "Good evening. Can I help you?" Temo says, "We were wondering about toys, especially any that might be of magical character." "Ah, of course. Is it a gift?" "Yes, I guess you could call it that - a gift which will also be a memento". "Well, welcome to Tummil's!"

We go inside.

Ceiling-mounted chandeliers run down the middle. Light sconces are set into the walls. There are isles of shelves that seem to almost have street lights between them here and there. The place is *packed* with toys. There's a store directory in the middle - types of toys via sections:

* Live animals
* Dolls
* Porcelain
* Mechanical
* Costumes
* Plush toys
* Lifelike toys
* Puppets and Marionettes
* Surprise Boxes
* Musical Toys

Costumes could be interesting - anything that might be a disguise? All children's sizes! And they're quite out-there; sort of fancy adult clothing in child sizes, or fairies, princesses and so-on. Hmm. No good.

We'll try Mechanical - upstairs. Next to Musical. Wind-up toys, jewellery boxes with ballerinas, dogs that walk, gilded cages with mechanical birds that sing. Musical toys? Some very over the top stuff. "The magical harp" - it plays itself. There's a flute which apparently can mimic bird sounds. There's a xylophone which says, "Try me!" so Temo tries it. Performance 25! Each key he hits sounds like someone screaming, or being choked, or drowning - it's horrific! Yikes. Not that! The flute might come in tho so Temo grabs that.

The last thing would be "Surprise Boxes". Back downstairs. We go past Puppets, Marionettes and Dolls to get there. Wisdom saving:

* Maireagh 13 - she freaks out as one of the dolls' heads turns to watch us! 
* Temo 19
* Riglan 24

The doll says, in a creepy voice, "Do you want to play?" and a few more in the shelf turn and start asking to be played with. "Play with us! It's play time!" and Riglan says, "Ah, right, yes, we *are* still in the Shadow Fell. Obviously, even toy shops, fucked up." One doll pulls of its own head and holds it forward. "Play with me!"

We leave at speed.

Suddenly "Surprise Boxes" seems less wise, but here we are. Beautifully decorated boxes, some with stars and crescent moons, some with rainbows, some with bats, some with tombstones. Suddenly, thinking about the xylophone, Temo worries about the noises the flute might make! He tries it. Relieved to find crow, owl, sparrow, duck; but he can't seem to control it. Arcana 14. The sound seems to come from a random location nearby, too. The flute is casting a restricted version of Minor Illusion. Well, it's a fun toy anyway. Could leave it at the school. Maireagh isn't keen on bringing things to "our world" - it could be possessed, who knows! She probably has a point, but it might come in as a gift. Temo, wisdom saving only 11; he presses the catch on a box. It springs open and a painted clown face on a spring bounces out, "You caught me! Hahahaha!" and illusory fireworks appear around us. Riglan says, "Well that's just weird!"

In case we need a distraction maybe the bats one might do something interesting. Temo presses the catch there too. It pops up. A purple cloud bursts out, then four or five bats appear to fly out of it, with lightning flashing the cloud; but in fact the bats are on springs and the cloud is an illusion. It takes all of us to push the bats back inside and close the lid - until Maireagh notices a handle at the back that's cranked to pull the bats back in.

So in the end, just the flute.

We look around. Riglan perception 13. There's nowhere obvious to check out. We return to the store directory and look around there. We feel a slight chill; we don't see a cashier, but see a spectre appear. An old man wearing an accountant's blazer. It hovers. "Would you like to make a purchase?" Temo says "The... The... Flute please?" - we're told 40gp. Temo isn't minded to bargain and hands it over. The money vanishes in the spectre's hand. "Is this a gift?" "It will be, I think" "Excellent" - and suddenly the flute is wrapped in a blue and gold box tied with a silver satin bow. "Oh. Thanks!" "Enjoy your gift. May it bring you favour!"

We exit. The doorman opens the door before we even reach it. "Ah. You found the perfect gift! Tummil's thanks you!" - Riglan perception 23. Riglan realises that the doorman is wearing a full doorman outfit with gloves, but when he speaks his mouth doesn't move. The neck and wrist are visible in between clothing a bit and are skeletal. We head away.

At a safe distance: "Well that was fucked" says Riglan.

We pass a beautiful art gallery. Probably horrific inside - paintings of dead people or something. A couture shop of some kind; probably sells possessed clothing. Hard to trust business at this point! Then we figure - what about inns, if we're going to stick around? Temo investigation, 12+8->20. He spots a beautiful white marble facade on a building about five stories high that looks like a hotel to his city-honed eye. It's very well lit, looks almost like a tall chateau. Beautiful decorations. Carved stonework along every divider between floors. A row of trees in front; marble stairs; a sign, "**Romanesco**". Riglan says, "I'm not sure even *we* can afford *that*"... But again we figure we could enquire at the front desk to see how we're treated.

A doorman, again. Presumably he's not used to seeing people arrive on foot rather than a carriage! On approach, Temo puts on his game face - persuasion 31! The door is opened immediately. "Good evening young sir. Welcome to Romanesco". He looks to Maireagh and Riglan; tone of voice changes. "Do you want me to take anything for your master?" (pah) "No, thank you".

Multicoloured carpet on a marble floor. Vine design. Front desk, marble. Two people stand behind and a bellhop. Dining room to one side, grand piano. Temo strides up to the desk. The bellhop runs up and hurriedly pushes up some small stairs in front! He stands top them and says, "A suite for the young sir and his helpers? ""I'm not sure if this is my style, but maybe it's my budget. How much for a suite?" "Are you asking for the price?!" "Yes!" "25gp" "Is that *all*?" says Temo; they answer "Per *night* sir...". Then suddenly someone steps out from a nearby water feature. An older-looking woman. A bob haircut. A short jacket. Velvet skirt. "I think you will find that there is no better hotelier than Romanesco! But perhaps young sir would like to have the regency suite? 40gp." Temo says, "That sounds more like it." "Ah! Perfect". She side-eyes the checkin cashier, glaring at him. Oh no! He's in trouble. "How many nights would you like to deposit? All incidentals can be handled at checkout. We require a minimum of a two night deposit." Temo says, "Two nights, fine. I'm not sure how long my business in this part of the Inner City will take, but it's probably at least a day." "May I enquire which other fair city the young sir has come from?" Temo looks surprised and feigns shock; deception 24; he says, "I mean no disrespect madam, but my travel plans both past and future are my private business." She apologises profusely, saying it was all because of his exotic dress! She asks for payment - prefers platinum, she says - this works well; Temo turns to Maireagh, "Please pay the woman!" and growling Maireagh hands over 8pp. She turns to the concierge, asks for the Regency Suite - but Temo mindful of time says, "That's OK, thank you, I assume the room is ready but we have urgent business and will return late" She looks surprised - "Ah, you are very busy; are you going to the gala?" "Actually, yes!"

We do at least take the room "key", which isn't so much a key as a flat-looking gold bar, with "The Regency Suite" on one side and "Romanescos" on the other, embossed.

So we head out and as we're going past the door, Temo mutters "40 a night. Slumming it. I knew we should have stayed in the other part of town..."

We bluff not taking a carriage as "these two will take care of it for me" (Riglan and Maireagh); but in reality walk back to the estate, to resume our subterfuge. Once we're inside the courtyard, dog back in the bag, Riglan recasts Disguise Self, benefiting from the rest we've had - with white shirt! - and we dig out white clothes that we've got for the other two. We use the cleaning stone, make sure we're all pretty, and head in.

(We notice many carriages outside, the soiree beginning outside but nobody allowed in yet).

At the back door, which is open, all sheets are taken in. A frantic mood inside. We make our way to the kitchen. We're given aprons. "Briefing in 5!"

A team of 12 people are there in aprons, 15 with us included. All ovens are going, trays of canapes coming out and transferred onto individual porcelain spoons and from there, onto big silver trays. A stack of folded, starched, ironed white napkins have to be carried too. The matron adjusts clothing and hair. Maireagh is given another hat... Oh dear. "Very dashing!" says Riglan, hopefully. Maireagh's face says it all!

They need three teams of five. We split up - gives us more ground to cover. Each team is told which tables and rooms; to remember where we are whenever we run out of food so we can get more then resume the route. It's basically just "pick up and go".

Two teams are on canapes, the third on drinks. Crates of wine filled from the cellar have been brought back up. Temo has to go for that team as the butler is telling us, "only those with the best balance should do drinks!"

It's ten minutes until doors open.

"Now about your pay. As always, you'll only be paid at the *end* of your shift. Anything you break is deducted from the pay. Is that understood? Have a good service everyone! Everyone, stations!"

So we do our things. As we circulate, each of us listens as best we can to anything - well, now, anything to do with new performers, fire dancers, or the general darkness. Perception rolls are rather low unfortunately:

* Riglan only 15
* Temo only 14
* Maireagh 16

In the first round of service, we just overhear general gossip and nonsense. People are drinking *heavily* though - the wine is the big thing, food less so - perhaps this'll loosen lips!

* Riglan only 12
* Temo only 14
* Maireagh 5

Fucks sake. Nothing of substance.

Riglan encounters a group who take food and look at him; most people look at his chest, since that's where his illusory head is - but this group look at the tray, then his chest for a moment, then his chest. He smiles. They smile back. Very sharp incisors. Vampires, must be able to see through illusions. Riglan says, "Simple illusions can help avoid stressing our more fragile guests." One responds, "It's fine. You don't have to explain hiding how monstrous you are - we all do it to some degree!" and the respondent's vampire eyes shine blood red as the fangs show. As he walks away, one is heard saying, "So, who do you think Madame Ecrit has in her sights tonight?" "I don't know. Pour souls get fleeced; I'm here for the free wine." "**Yes and maybe a sneaky feed on the side...**" - Ugh.

Temo is in the parlour; lots of people are gathered around one older looking woman with a very high bun, reeks of perfume and wears a tightly-corseted black silk dress with a huge wire skirt - **this is Lady Ecrit**. Two younger, early 30s people are sat next to hear looking very bored, also in black finery, lazily nursing a drink as she speaks to the enthralled crowd in an animated way; he hears names **Miranda** and **Edward**. "...We discovered we have ancestral title on these gem mines, out quite far, kind of in the hinterlands, out towards - mountainous area - I think it's called Darkhome or Darkon or something - you know, the country!" - she goes on to talk of diamond and sapphire mines - "...It's in the ground, it needs to come out; we don't need the money but it's a great opportunity to create a bit of wealth for someone else who wants to go in on this venture" - ears prick up - people are interested - this is *clearly a scam*, even with only insight 6 (doh) he knows Darkon isn't mountainous! She voices the amount of 50,000gp being put in by themselves and want to have that matched by someone coming in on the same venture. Lots of people seem to want to put up the money. Temo moves on. These people are dumb! We'll learn nothing from them.

On a 5, Maireagh is aware she is still in the manor and serving canapes `;-)`

* Riglan only 17
* Temo only 10
* Maireagh 15

Nothing again. This is at the end of the 1st hour (Riglan having sneaked off and re-cast his disguise).

Now Riglan is in the parlour. The older lady is no longer in the middle of the room (not that he knew that's what Temo saw, yet). Her aide is being consulted about financial arrangements. On the terrace, Riglan sees Lady Ecrit. Insight 2+9->11 (there hasn't been a roll for Riglan or Temo at 10 or higher in a long, long time). He's waved away as she doesn't want food but another person stops him and takes a canape... "...Now, now, Lady Ecrit, you did promise us that you would start to see shipments in the first year? Is there *any* news from the harbour?" "Oh you understand - there have been strikes, a shortage of labour; everything is ready to go; it's just waiting in port to leave. The moment it lands in Citeaux, you know the demand is through the roof! We'll be able to sell it for at least 50% more. You'll make your money back in no time. Patience!" "But I had to leverage my family's fortune - we had to provide liquidity - ..." "Oh, I feel so bad for you! My darling. But in business, one should never extend beyond one's means. Why don't you go and talk to Edward? He could extend you a line of credit if you're finding yourself momentarily short of funds."

Riglan takes careful note of the person that is over-extended. What he looks like, where he is. A mousey-looking human, maybe in late 30s, early 40s, well dressed but not particularly glamourous. Some means but probably roughing it a little! Stressed out. He heads back to find Edward. Riglan wants to stop him, but can't as he's a server and it would be totally irregular and blow the disguise. He follows him though, giving out food as he goes. The tray empties quickly; but he overhears Miranda saying, "Oh, look I mean it's just a rough estimation but maybe 400, 500% return in the first few years? It's a mine, so sometimes things are a bit delayed but you can never fail with a mine..." The guy Riglan's following goes to Edward, sheepish, asking about a line of credit; "I'm a business partner on the perfume import business..." "Ah, right... **Robert**, isn't it? **Robert Orin?**" "Yes! Yes, that's me!" The guy is offered *25%* interest (!) and asks for 2000gp, but isn't sure how long until the port receives the first shipment. Edward talks him up - 5000gp! Yikes.

Does Robert seem like a good guy to Riglan? 20+9->29 insight! Edward had asked if his staff could go on half pay and he'd bristled. He's worried. He's beginning to question if he's made a mistake.

As he moves away, Riglan waits for chance to fall in step alongside now that his tray's empty and says, "I know this is highly irregular... But I strongly recommend you seek out Mr Temo Smoothhands at Romanescos Hotel in the Regency Suite.... He can offer solutions that don't have such high interest rates!" - the guy assumes Riglan is an agent of a rival house to Ecrit and he goes with that. He seems like he might take up the offer.

* Riglan only 27
* Temo only 20
* Maireagh 5

Finally. Riglan and Temo find themselves in the same area of the same room, food and drinks, while Maireagh always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. From here, they're able to collude and look for different things; Temo investigation with luck point a strong 26 and Riglan a lucky insight roll 16+9->25.

On a landing, there are whispers in dark corners of the gallery. Not the loud business of the Ecrit. By a Juliet balcony, we see 3 people speaking in hushed tones...

* "Really, quite magnificent. She is a seemingly endless well of extremely potent, very pure, raw untouched magical energy; you have to taste it to believe it; it's truly astonishing; I've not seen this kind of pure, uncorrupted power in a very long time."
* "Really? And you found her where? In the slums?"
* "Yes! Yes indeed. In *mid* city. I had an agent tell me about this - I witnessed the performance myself. Just the sheer unbridled *shadow* energy coming off her is intoxicating!"
* "Oh my goodness. Really?! So what's the arrangement?" / "Yes, I'm very interested! Count me in! How do I book this - this session?"
* "Demand is very high but you're both great customers of mine. It's 250gp for one session. I'll arrange it. You'll have the room to yourself. She's kept magically unconscious so there's no harm. The dreams - whatever she's dreaming of at the moment - it's just emanating waves of the most delicious psychic energy... I tell you I've not witnessed anything like this before..."
* One of them baulks at 250gp. "Oh, I'm also working on something bottled! I found this creature out in the deep mirks which can syphon this psychic energy, and I'm finding a way to bottle it - something like 20 gold for a bottle - so just wait and see. Patience. I'm figuring it out. Really for the full experience you want a proper session."
* The one who can afford it? "Where do I go? How soon can you book me in?"
* "I have an arrangement. Come see me at **Madame Bela's** - it has all these private rooms; I can arrange for you - say that you're looking for the **Font Of Shadows** and I will take payment and arrange the booking for you."

Temo history 14; he realises we walked past that twice! The couture shop. Madam Bela's Couture. He kicks Riglan in the shins and mouths, "Maireagh" - so we go off to find her.

Maireagh has decided to stand in a corner with a tray with a few canapes! Temo heads up, trying to keep up appearances and says quietly, "Time to leave and leave fast."

So we empty the trays for appearance's sake, drop off at the kitchen, leave the aprons in the wet room - but we hear "Hold on! Wait! from the matron calling after us. She hands us each a gold piece! Riglan says, "We had to leave early and didn't think we'd be paid..." "It's fine, a shift is a shift. You worked all afternoon. I heard from James that you were fantastic and the Canapes, they look so good Tegan!" - she's looking at Maireagh. Pleasantries exchanged (!) we head out.

It takes a while for Riglan and Temo to explain to Maireagh. Temo's opening line is "I feel sick". We feel like we've been hit by a train. **We had no idea anything like that was happening to Nethza**. We explain that we know a contact at Madame Bela's to "see" - FSVO "see" - Nethza. But they're feeding on her, it's a psychic thing, they can see dreams and there's a damned good chance they'll see right *through* us.

Riglan also explains that before *that* revelation, he figured we might be able to help someone who is a victim of Ecrit's shenanigans and seems like a good person. Maireagh is sceptical.

### 10pm

We perhaps should scout out Madam Bela's, but we're not sure what good it will do - we're going in anyway. At least we could find exits, back doors, whatever; they'll be closed now; it's nearly 10pm so there's barely any time left with Riglan's spider. We get to Bela's and try to see if we can get around behind the building, looking for rear exits. There's a delivery door. The spider could go in but we're in the street, with no cover; we figure, enough's enough. We'll work it out tomorrow - for now, back to the hotel and hopefully a useful meeting with "Robert".

So we return and Temo takes the lead of course; as we head in, the concierge recognises us immediately. "Ah. Good Sir. Please come with me - I'll show you to the regency suite" "Thank you". We're taken to a kind of mechanical equivalent of a magical floating platform of some kind. It has big round buttons that seem to select a floor, and a crossed ironwork collapsing gate/door of sorts, painted white, that is pulled closed before the mechanism will work.

Top floor - floor 5. A door at the far end of the hall. We're brought to the door at the end. "I trust you have the key on you?" - Temo produces it - "oh you don't need to take it out; it just needs to be on your person". The door opens. We go inside; the concierge says "Lights!" and lots of mood lighting illuminates. Flickering sconces, but magical. He says "Water!" and soft flowing water starts moving in a water feature. "If you need anything, pull this chord to ring the bell. There's one on each floor."

Temo mentions that we might be visited by "Robert Orin" and, no matter the hour, if so please show him up (hands the concierge 1gp). Turns out there's a kind of sending stone on a wooden side table that'll be used.

It's a beautiful room. There's a foyer. A beautiful round table with a flower arrangement, a bell chord, a balcony with french doors opening out, a couple of soft armchairs looking out and a low coffee table; it's over two floors too, bathrooms above, delicate spiral stairs leading up, with the slate water feature running from the top to bottom over the two floors; a kitchenette and dining area off to one side.

Temo sees none of it.

He sinks into the nearest chair, and says, "They're... They're eating her" and just starts crying.

Maireagh heads over and gives him a long, smothering hug. "We know where she is now. This is the closest we've got. We'll *get her out*. This whole nightmare will be over." Temo says, "Maybe. I doubt it's that easy. But we'll get her out for sure. Or die trying. Is it agreed?" Riglan says, "Agreed. Rescue or dead."

We're quiet for a bit.

"I wonder if Robert will actually turn up? He might know something about this Madam Bela... Perhaps we should sleep in watches, so we can keep an eye on that stone thing."

Maireagh asks if we can have the french doors open if we're doing watches. Yes, of course. A moon, 2/3rds full; a reminder of the few days remaining before the next time shift. And then what?

The kitchenette has loose leaf teas and cookies. Decorated boxes of chocolates. For once, Riglan makes some tea and brings it to the other two, with cookies. Temo says, "I got so close to her, you see. With the schools. Really started to look up to her. I guess I never talked about it much. We really do need to find her, don't we? Not just for her - but we'll be stuck here..."

From our vantage point up here, we look out over this - superficially - beautiful city. Amazing architecture. Many things pointlessly illuminated. Many mature trees below us. But we also see a 20-25ft high wall, all around, separating people.

Riglan says, "There's more to this than meets the eye. The Raven Queen. This Azalin Rex." (We can see the palace very clearly from here). "The people who were chasing us; that figure in the gold and purple robes, the witherling gnolls. We don't know anything much yet, this whole time. The entire council - We need to rescue Nethza, because whatever *that* shit was they were saying back at the gala, it's every kind of awful. But we have to be strong and realise, that won't be the end of it. There's more to be done here and we have to make sure we're able to face up to it."

### 11pm

We start taking watches... Try to sleep. Temo says he can't really sleep, so Riglan goes second and Maireagh has the morning shift.

Temo, perception on watch: 22.

He's sat in the armchair overlooking the balcony, watching the moon move across the sky. He can tell easily, since he's in a city, how it moves against buildings and towers. Something's flying around out there; bats, owls, something else... Not sure. A mist starts to roll in. It sits low against the ground. The room faces the sea; it glitters distantly; the hazy mist rolls in from there but never enters the city. Temo hears the sound of people exiting carriages and talking before entering buildings. It goes quiet after a while. Every now and again, the light sound of conversations can be heard drifting up from below, moving around.



## Day 15 ("day" 12 in Shadowfell, day 11 of 15-day cycle)
### 2am

Temo's watch comes to an end, so Riglan takes over. Riglan gets a very bad roll! 3+9->12. He's preoccupied with the events of the night. Cloud cover has come over. It's darker, very quiet. Small wings beat in the sky nearby occasionally. He goes to the balcony but can't see anything; it's getting cold anyway so Riglan closes the french doors. By about 5am, a fog has rolled into the harbour. A low mist has settled on the ground in town, giving everything an eerie look. Street lamps flicker out at around 5am surprisingly; but someone comes around, relighting them. Once upon a time, when this was all designed, they expected the sun to be coming up by now.

### 5am

Maireagh takes over watch. Perception 19. At 8am, she starts making tea and digging around in the cookie tin. We all wake up. "I found more cookies! Surely, for 40gp, we're allowed to help ourselves?" Temo says, "Honestly, it's probably extra - but fill your boots." "They're pretty good actually; not freshly baked, but not old".

At around 8:15am, there's a strange bonging noise. The ceramic 'sending stone' glows softly. Riglan goes over and - shrug - tries touching it and saying "yes...?" A voice answers, "Sorry, Sirs; there is a Robert Orin to see you? I have instructions left here from the night porter that you wanted to be informed" and Riglan cheers up and says, "Yes! Excellent! Please could you see him up to our room?" "Yes, no problem. We'll do that right away."

So, Riglan helps Maireagh make a bit more tea but just a few moments later a bell rings above the door. Riglan asks Temo to answer because he's looking like a Firbolg and doesn't want to waste a Disguise Self on it and he doesn't want to scare Robert. Temo argues back and, while we're doing it, Maireagh opens the door! "Yes?" "Oh, this is the guest... For Master Temo" and Riglan calls, "Thank you! Thank you very much! Please come in" and Maireagh ushers in Robert.

He's changed, looks like he's been home and tidied himself up. He looks nervous; uneasy. He looks like he's not slept much. He stands just inside the room. Temo brings him over the coffee table area. He clutches a bag, even while sat down. Maireagh offers him tea by means of putting down the teapot and teacup.

Riglan lays out that we're independent, not allied to a family, and we've been looking for a friend but instead overheard shady dealings with Lady Ecrit. Riglan is offering to at least pay his immediate short-term debt to her, but can't help with the rest. To Riglan's surprise, Robert is very unsure at this point - had intended to offer some kind of deal - but thought we were another family or something. And highlighting the Ecrit's wrongdoing is very unsettling as they're very powerful and they could destroy his family easily if it was found that he was calling them out.

DC 25 to keep him in the room - Temo persuasion 24, but Maireagh adds a Flash Of Genius. "I'm good with books and you have a proposal; let's see it". He's 25K in the hole with them overall. His proposal to us was to sell shares in his investment to us in return for paying off the debt, *not* having it for free.

He made a mistake "betting the farm" on the one big deal - got greedy. Should've never got in so deep.

His family historically are ore traders. Work with the Mint here in Citeaux and that's what gives them a base of money. They're not "sophisticated, urbane, artistic or fabulously aristocratic types at all! My great-great-...-great? - well about 400 years ago! - grandfather established as an ore trader in the mid-city. We have industrial roots. My late father and I have noticed the downturn as things in the land started to change. The last year has been particularly difficult. This is why everyone *is* so desperate. This is - I'm not sure if you're aware of this, or picked it up last night - but none of the noble families in Citeaux are doing well. Fortunes are waning. Money doesn't flow into the city as it used to. We can see this as we're connected to the outside of it, but even those who deal exclusively in the pleasures and treasures of Inner Citeaux have felt the sting of the tightening by now."

He offers a trade. He can broker a deal for an ore, gems or metal if we have one, and take a commission. It doesn't need to pay his extended debt to the Ecrit familiy; it just needs to bootstrap things. We have Etherium ingots, but he doesn't know the metal or how to sell it. Maireagh, however, has an Adamantium ingot - and *that* he knows. It's rare and beautiful. Temo suggests that a rapid sale would help us all; adding a premium to his seller's fee for an expedited trade is fine! We also have a 1000gp-ish gem, so that's rolled in.

He leaves us the deed of shares in the perfume business - we don't want them - but they're security, since we're giving him things of value. They're in escrow. He is then able to take the ingot and gem; it's a trading day at the market, so he's hopeful to sell this very same day.

We do also ask about the shady characters we saw last night - not the conversation, just describing them. Madam Bela - a long lineage; vampires; but she might be a dhampir. We thank him for that. He also helps us by telling us the location of useful things in the city:

* The ore and gem market.
* Where the great library is.
* Where the council chamber are - city hall/parliament in essence.
* Where the Tower Of Secrets is; this is where the conclave of seers and mages meet. A secret society. The talisman we have has the symbol for this not-so-secret society; we learn that this is a *subset* of the council, so now we've narrowed it down.

Hands are shaken, the deal is done. He thanks us - "you will not be disappointed!" - and heads out.

Once he's gone, we turn our attention to Madam Bela. We need to get an "audience" with Nethza, but Bela can probably read our minds. Maireagh has the Intellect Fortress spell, handily, so that could help a bit.

We head downstairs. The dining room is apparently serving breakfast. Might as well find out what food is like at a 40gp/night hotel! Eggs, bacon, sausages, pots of strange pickled sour fish (but it's good), yoghurt, and tea. No mastica brew. It's good though!

### 9:30am

We walk out, now in a standard formation of Temo at the front and us side by side a "respectful" distance behind. Maireagh and Riglan have their armour and weapons, while Temo wears his fancy clothes.

Outside Madam Bela's, Maireagh casts Intellect Fortress on Temo, in the form of a small circlet she makes with her tinker's tools and places on his head. We've agreed that Riglan and Maireagh will keep a little over 30ft distance from behind Temo, ostensibly for privacy - and because Temo will overtly confess to not wanting "the help" to leak secrets!

In we go.

There are some steps at the entrance, and it's a strange rotating door. Temo gets through; Maireagh and Riglan (and the dog) get a bit more stuck but eventually make it inside. Beautiful diamond-shaped tiles on the floor in various patterns. Heavy curtains, currently drawn open. No clothing racks or similar in sight; it's just mannequins, posed in gala, dining, street, stepping out of a carriage, giving a speech - woah. There is even scenery/sets around them. It's... A lot.

"Everyday clothing" on this floor. "Gala and fancy dress" on stairs to the left. "Avant garde" on stairs to the right. At the back, behind internal glass windows, seems to be a workroom filled with long tables, sewing machines, bolts of cloth, patterns on parchment and various unfinished garments. Before that, there's some kind of main desk and someone stood or sat there. They look up. "Bonjour" (or again, whatever the Shadow Fell equivalent of 'French' might be!). Temo says, "Hello." "How may I help you?" It's a pale-skinned human, somewhat excessive-bordering-on-ridiculous dress; not someone we recognise. "I request an audience with Madam Bela please." "Ah, you have a fitting?" "It's a private matter." "Sorry but Madam Bela is not here yet - it is very early for her - not even 10am". Temo feigns frustration and is about to ask when she'll be here - but at that moment the door opens and in walks Madam Bela!

She walks straight past Maireagh and Riglan apparently ignoring them; she has a scrappy, hairless dog under her arm. She doesn't so much put the dog down as drop it (!), pushes up sunglasses - even though it's still fully dark outside - and calls, "Louis! I'm here!" and saunters up. Looks at Temo; down her nose a bit; "Good morning" she says and Temo says, "Ah! Madam Bela herself. Enchanted. Temo Smoothhands, at your service." Her eyes look at him, but they're kind of dead; strange; thin cold hands reach out to touch his. "They are smooth indeed!" she say.

* Adv wisdom saving; 18. A presence in his mind. She's exerting an influence. Temo resists this. It's a guile and charm she is trying to convey.

"Come! Come into my room!" she says; "Louis! I will have tea!" "At once Madam Bela" and Temo heads to the room. Louis looks to Riglan and Maireagh - "Do not touch anything!" and Temo looks over to them too, and motions with his hand for them to follow, but at a distance. Madam Bela sees this. "Your servants are joining you?" He answers, "Servants and bodyguards. They'll wait outside, but will answer if I call." "You are under no threat, I assure you! It is not that kind of business we do here."

We get into a room. With a flick of her wrist, a chair drags itself across the room; she sits, pretty much drops everything on the ground; she motions to another chair, and Temo hoists himself up. "Apologies. I was not expecting the small folk today!" she says. Temo answers "It's of no concern, I'm quite used to it." She lights a very long cigarette on the need of a long, metal holder. Temo says, "I won't beat around the bush. Word travels on the streets and sometimes the words are interesting to me. I'm not interested in clothes. I'm interested in" (quietly) "the Font Of Shadows".

She gasps and flickers her wrist; the door slams shut. She asks Temo to repeat himself. Temo repeats.

* Intelligence saving: 4,5+8 -> 13 -> luck point, still only 8+8 -> 16. He feels her probing his mind; looking for intent.

"Where did you hear this?" Temo answers, "Last night's gala." "Oh! Word does travel fast." Persuasion 2, luck point, 2 again! FML. 15 total. It's not great. "Hmm." she says. Sits back. "Interesting". She leans back in the chair. "You want the Font Of Shadows experience? I assume you are good for it?"

Temo explains that normally his servants handle such matters, but this is a conversation - as she astutely noted - best kept private. He pulls out not 25, but 30 platinum. Extra given his unexpected arrival - on the grapevine. She offers the "special service" for the extra. "Very well. For 30..." (she takes it, puts it on a tray and into a draw) "...I'll arrange it for you tonight. Strictly after hours. There's a back entrance into the workshop. I will have you meet me there." Temo says, "What time exactly?" "10pm" "And forgive me, but 'arrive at the back entrance in an alleyway at 10pm' has a certain..." but before he finishes, she's almost offended. "It is *not* an alleyway! And you can bring your bodyguards. You won't need them but bring them." "Most accommodating Madam Bela. Your reputation is justified." "There are some rules", she says. "No weapons. I do not want you harming the merchandise. You will follow the instructions given to you by the handler; and I do not want you to bring any strong fields in - no powerful magical fields in. I *know* you are under the protection of a spell!" Temo chuckles and says, "Of course, Madam Bela. We all have our secrets." "The subject is most precious to me... I will not have anyone magically interfering with it." "Very wise!" "If you do not show, your fee is forfeit. No refunds!" "We will be there."

Temo heads out and the "entourage" departs.

Once we're on the street, Temo says, "we're going to need a really, really good plan..." Maireagh asks what he spent, fearing he might've bought something too. "Only 300 gold. We need somewhere to talk that's private; I'm not even sure I trust the hotel. I think I can fit the Hut into the room?" - so we decide to try that. In silence, still in formation; get up to the room, cast the hut. Inside Temo catches everyone up.

Riglan thinks that the Bag Of Holding might fly under the radar; Madam Bela didn't seem to pay much attention to it, didn't prohibit him from bringing it. They might not even have "portable holes" to other dimensions here since it is, after all, meant to be a prison and perhaps something like that could form the basis of an escape route.

* We'll look for big trees close to Madam Bela's, especially the rear entrance; and trees by the hotel. Riglan saw a very big tree at the *front* of the Ecrit manor, so that could be a way to jump there, in order to reach the tunnels. Finally, we'll try to find one a long way away in the Inner City, in case we for any reason just need to put distance in between.

* While we'd be leaving the horses behind, there was the dying oak on the road way back, and another large tree that Riglan saw while we were tackling the Quiet Woods.

* Other than that, we've no idea what we're walking into. Weapons can go into the bag of holding; Temo figures he'll be told if anything he's carrying or wearing need to be left behind.

Very little can be planned, it seems. We'll have to think on our feet. This assumes we can even figure out how to get Nethza out - or even awake. The library seems like a good bet in the mean time:

* Find out more about this council subset, the mages
* Find our more about the council overall
* Lineage of the Bela family, since Robert said they went way back, one of the originals

We're greeted at the library at meet heavy resistance! They want to know our credentials - talisman, doesn't really sway them - and *who* we are - Temo bluffs with our "magical item manufacturer" story. Persuasion, DC30! And Temo by remarkable chance rolls 17+13. The trouble is, they recognise that we're travellers, not citizens and apparently non-citizens aren't allowed access to all areas.

Eventually we're given access but only if we can say exactly what we want. Temo goes for the mage council - but there's only one book on that. He asks if there's also anything about the mechanisms of government in general (ostensibly since we'll have trade dealings). It's a wild stab in the dark. The information we're told is not arcane, though. So we might not find much.

We start with that one book. Quite interesting actually. Author is **Aldous Alestair**. Appears to be paranoid, delusional ramblings by one person! Constant references to a "secret council". Perhaps not so delusional... But clearly not a factual book. The author expresses the belief that the council partakes in gruesome and grotesque rituals, kidnapping people off the streets, making people disappear; intricately interwoven into the political / power structure; nothing happens without their say-so. Really, the city is under *their* control.

There could be truth in that, though the author clearly sees eyes in the walls and hears voices keeping him up at night! It gives some *inkling* of the potential power and importance of this council, but nothing much else.

On to general governance and structure. We spend hours on this! The way it works has changed over the centuries and writing styles are not uniform; some writings contradict each other.

* The king is all-powerful; he can simply wish things to happen and through his magic, force of will, or whatever you want to call it, he can make things happen; change reality to suit his desires. He doesn't need to ask anyone else - he doesn't need to make commands.

* Instruments of government are not there to enact his will. So the council is created for the purpose of the population; Azalin Rex is "above" ruling a kingdom. He's no interest in that at all. He'd happily have let things fall apart, but the people invented the council as a way of ruling themselves.

* The domain in which Azalin Rex has been placed has facilitated this condition. He's not the ruler of any kingdom; he has no desire to rule; he simply doesn't care about the people at all. They just happen to be in the same cage as him. Perhaps at one point he craved this kind of power, but he's gone far, far beyond that now.

* The council meanwhile is politically controlled. It hasn't changed - the same families wielding power in Citeaux for generations - *until recently*. Within the last ten years, a new faction has arrived. This faction has created imbalance and instability (according to one author, at least!).

* In the process of this change, one old family ended up disgraced and all but wiped out from the political scene of Citeaux - the family of **Audmar**. The faction filling that vacuum isn't a family with a name; it seems more of a paramilitary group, "**The Guardians Of Night**".

* This faction was manouevred into power by resisting a rise in power of the Cult Of Ezra. The council represents mostly aristocratic vampires; the "cult" of Ezra has gained in popularity as difficulty has set in. This makes us realise that this change in the council wasn't what's caused the difficulties in the land - it was the difficulties that provoked the rise in Ezra, which in turn provoked the change.

* This group is considered quite rogue / unknown; violent methods, other families fear them. We form the theory - just a guess, but a good one - that our mystery aggressor (purple and gold robes) might be a Guardians Of Night member.

This means Guardians Of Night are more interesting so we ask our reluctant helper at the library about books on them. He actually perks up at this; "this is more recent, more modern... Certainly more relevant!" We say we're done with the books he gave us so that those can be tidied & locked up, then we're led to "Contemporary History / Current Affairs". Unlocks it, lets us in. Very different room - not full of books, but leather-bound folders full of gazettes. It's a newspaper archive! "**The Citeaux Daily Sun**" (that's not going to age well...).

Temo as usual leads the investigations, with us assisting; adv investigation total 27. The librarian had helped by pointing us to the volumes with the first references made to the Guardians. Not even 9 years ago. **There's an address! Article is "Establishment Of The Chapter House Of A New Guard For The City"** - they started out as (or prentended to be 'only') private, for-hire guards. The article talks about crimes against nobles being on the rise. So that was how they got in - play the fear card. "The city celebrates the arrival of proper guards with ideals aligned with those of the nobles, and there to serve the nobles".

* Articles on Chapter House growing
* "Unrest Grows" (people are unhappy...)
* "Rebellion Put Down" (...and the results were inevitable)
* "Unholy coven unearthed and revealed, brought to light, justice served" and so-on

The tone is consistently sensationalist and propaganda in constant favour of the Guardians, so was probably written by them or at their behest from the outset. About 4 years ago though the tone suddenly changes.

* "Guardians Of Night Storm into Private Noble's Estate, Seizes Assets"
* Indications of "the nobles" being afraid
* "**The Audmar Family Bids Citeaux Farewell**" - they moved their entire family out to a hillside country manor, leaving politics behind
* Are they the first family to fall, but not the last? Who knows! And so-on.

A prominent name appears - **Alcio Metus** - who apparently leads the group. Sometimes, the word "Baron" - *always in inverted commas* (Alcio "Baron" Metus) is put in front, yet there's also a gender reference to 'her'. Implication is that they like to go by the name or title "Baron" rather than their actual name.

We stumble across, by chance, a reference to **Madame Talaveris Ecrit** in a quarter-page spread; "Scandal Hits The Ecrit Estate". Angry creditors storming the front gardens, the "**Kargat**" is called - we realise that's a nickname for the Guardians - and they arrive just in time to *save* her from "embarrassment". So perhaps she hires them to quell dissent and hide the number of people she's actually screwing over.

Now we know the word "The Kargat" is referring to basically a secret police force within the Guardians Of Night, we find more references to which we'd not really paid attention before. They're seen as a menacing, oppressive force of arms; the only military power in the inner city. A lot of nobles seem to be quite afraid of them. Perhaps we should be too, if we're able to take Nethza away from captivity.

### 4pm

Thanking the librarian we head outside. Dark again, we've missed the few hours of daylight!

We might have to escape in a hurry. Riglan could take us to trees, but the ones he knows are a long way away. What about the horses? We return to the hotel, and speak with the conceirge. We're able to arrange that if we're not back to pay for more nights in the room tomorrow, he needs to arrange a "courier" of sorts to take the horses home. We over-pay both the concierge and for the courier in advance, **on trust**.

* We pay the concierge a whopping 3gp to buy that trust!
* There's 5gp for the job of actually taking the horses back.

We kill time after that; a nervous evening meal, the group's quiet, tension is evident. So it feels like forever, but also feels really sudden at the same time, when we're stood outside the back of Madam Bela's. Maireagh re-casts Intellect Fortress on Temo as a precaution. All weapons have been hidden in our Bag of Holding.

### 10pm

Someone is meant to be here to meet us - and indeed, the door opens a crack just moments after our arrival. "Come in!" says a hushed, furtive voice. In we go. A guard checks is over - yep, no weapons. Surely it can't be that easy... Riglan gets even *more* entrance.

We're in a service entrance area of some kind. We're brought to workrooms. Madam Bela is there. "Ah!" says Temo. "Excellent. I didn't think you'd be here in person." "Yes, of course I am! It is important. I need you to understand how things work. Please, come and take a seat before we begin."

Temo takes a seat and Riglan and Maireagh take up positions stood behind, as if on guard.

"You understand, there is no contract - none of this is in writing" continues Madam Bela "but there are some things you must not do. Do not touch the subject - do not touch the *dreamer*. The dreamer will amplify whatever it is you desire. It is not my fault, or my problem, if it doesn't go exactly as planned for you, the way have imagined. *You*. It is on *you* to control your own faults. Is that understood?" "Perfectly." "Right. My guard is going to check you again to make sure you have no weapons..." - and we all have to be searched again. Again, Riglan is surprised and nervous - we're given the all-clear.

We follow her to another room after that. "The guards" have to wait outside. She opens a door. Behind it are some wide spiral stairs, leading down. She heads down and at this point, all three of us can follow. A dark, long corridor; sconces on the wall; a door, in a stone wall of a presumed-stone room. Madam Bela fishes out a key, looks to Riglan and Maireagh, opens the door and says, "You have to wait outside" - we nod obediently - Riglan, perception only 16; he can't see in the room; he sees only the faintest movement at the end of the hallway we're in, as if there's something at the far end - a guard, a creature, *something*. Madam Bela steps inside. Temo walks in.

The room is quite dark. In the middle of the room is quite a comfortable looking, beautiful bed. **Lying on there is Nethza**. The room isn't large, but is clear; curtains hang up on the walls, hiding presumed-bare-brick behind. Dim lights hang from braziers up near the ceiling, oddly. Most disturbingly - there is a large creature without eyes here. It has several sharp rows of teeth. It looms, hovering over Nethza. It appears to notice our arrival, eyes or not. It's almost insectoid, with a series of translucent, almost crystalline spines along its back; colours play along them as it seems to sense us entering. Temo adv int saving - 24. A probing presence is in his mind, but Temo resists. Madam Bela must know that somehow and is surprised; "I thought you'd done this before! You must let the creature in for the experience to begin." Temo says, "I don't quite know how to say this - terribly embarrassing - performance anxiety - I don't suppose we could be alone, could we?" - deception adv., 23.

After a moment of pause for thought, Madam Bela apparently assessing the situation, she says - "Of course. Of course, it's not my place to judge! You may have your privacy... As paid for. You understand of course that if anything were to happen to my prized dreamer, I have my own guardian in the hallway who will know the moment that anything happens in this room, which is not supposed to?" - and she looks at him in a very direct way. Temo says, "Very clearly understood." "Very well. Enjoy your evening. I will take my leave and my guard will see you out at the end."

Off she goes. Maireagh and Riglan see her leaving, glancing towards the dark end of the hallway. She plays with one of her rings, which glows momentarily - then her amulet changes appearance, a greenish glow, as she walks away. Riglan sees a soft green light at the far end of the hallway. That's enough to see some large looming construct of some sort, apparently made of steel and flesh! It moves a little, then takes two steps forward and settles again.

Temo meanwhile casts Message to Riglan, saying "Netzha is here. Guardian in the hallway; if I do anything it will attack you; be prepared." Riglan says, "Oh, we see it alright!" and then out loud to Maireagh, casually says, "It's good to know our friend is OK in there". Hopes she'll understand. She looks nervous, annoyed; stressed and frustrated that she can't just run in there.

**Temo decides to risk letting the strange creature in his mind**; perhaps he can communicate with Nethza somehow.

* Temo senses his consciousness shifting awareness from the world around into some landscape. It feels like he's being drawn into it. Passing through an aperture.
* There's a weird, sickly, alien and quite parasitic presence connecting with him. It feels intrinsically **wrong** - his whole body screams out to say "no, don't let this happen!"
* He enters a room, full of shifting colours. Amorphous, as if this creature is trying to read his thoughts to understand what to display. He consciously tries to think about him and Netzha setting up the school. Adv history - 23.
* He's pulled into an *analogue* of that situation, but everything about it is slightly wrong. The opening day of the school. He feels a strange, selfish joy; like an artificially created emotion.
* The amorphous mist around him starts to take shape into the scene, but if he looks over a bit too quickly, especially out of the corner of his eye, he sees it unformed - only things in the front field of view are well formed.
* People behave exactly as *he* expects, which itself feels strange. Nethza - and this never happened - walks out from the school smiling; holds his hand; "Ah! The opening of a school! Yes. This is your dream."
* Temo answers, "And yours too - remember?" - persuasion flat, nat 2+13->15. She doesn't seem to acknowledge or register; but he out of luck thinks of something else to say (luck point) - personal things - persuasion now 27.
* For a moment, Nethza smile fades... In its place is a small, scared-looking young tiefling holding his hand, eyes wide open, struggling to breathe almost, realities shifting, reaching for him then as no longer holding his hand, reality shredding around her, then back to fake happy Nethza, then back... A version of Nethza, tired, gaunt, malnourished, grabbing out for him - "Temo! Temo!" - shifts again.
* Contested wisdom saving rolls with the creature, but at advantage thanks to Maireagh's spell. Temo, 19+1 -> 20; beats the creature's 11. He pushes the creature away. He reaches out and tries to grab Nethza who is starting to fall through a void as reality is shredded.
* He dives after her - acro nat 1 (but he can't roll that), then 17+10->27. He grabs her. She wraps her arms around him. Then we both *slam* into some kind of strange ground - psychic damage; 14. Temo is thrown back into reality.

**The creature looks up and shrieks. Screams! All its spines/spikes turn a violent orange. Outside, Riglan and Maireagh see the construct immediately lift up to full height and move to attack.**

Initiative:

* Temo 20
* Riglan 13
* Maireagh 7

Temo (bonus action) aims, aiming to try and fire along the line of the spines and shatter them; he fires at the weird creature, while shouting, "I'm going to need help in here!" as loudly as he can. 28, hits; total of 30 damage with sneak. Unfortunately the damage doesn't seem to do much to stop the creature knowing *exactly* where Temo is; it seems to sniff the air, then moves, looks directly at the door - it seems to know about Riglan and Maireagh too.

The creature twists its legs up and sticks itself to the ceiling. The head rotates to compensate and it clatters over to just above Temo. There's a "pulse" that emits from it - arcane, psychic; DC14 wisdom saving for anyone with spellcasting ability. Temo nat 20+1, success and immune; the creature looks confused; Riglan is in range, makes his save, 21 too. Maireagh 17, so she makes it as well. The pulse does not mark anyone and the creature doesn't have the advantage on us.

Even so, the hunter creature now flicks its tail to try and sting and grapple Temo. It'd hit but he throws up a magical shield which *just* deflect. It shrieks and tries a claw attack but that too deflects off the shield.

Riglan says to Maireagh, "meh, it's not *that* big, you got this right?!" and kicks open the door. Athl 14 -> OK. Oh! No staff, it's in the bag! He calls a draconic spirit that does radiant damage. It attacks the strange creature; both rend attacks hit for 13 and max 15 damage. The breath weapon works too for a near-maximum of 11 radiant - great rolls. Its crystals are glowing red.

Maireagh holds her ground against the construct. She pulls the dog and her hammer out of the bag - action. Bonus action, commands the dog to attack. The dog tries to go for the construct. Hits, dealing 7 damage. Maireagh also uses Arcane Jolt to add 2d6->4 more damage. She calls out, "Whatever this is, it's very hardy!" - Riglan hears!

The construct appears to self-repair and Maireagh calls out "OK, it self-repairs, this is a problem!" - Riglan hears *that* too - and it moves forward; thump, thump, thump. It tries to strike the dog with fists twice; both hit. 27 damage total.

Back to Temo. The creature is above him; he has to disengage to attack, moving to the corner of the room, away from the door. He hits and it's a very strong set of damage rolls; 35 total. He aims for the head and it just shatters! The creature falls from the ceiling. Riglan needs to make an athl check - *to grab Nethza* before it falls on her, putting his body on top of hers or maybe pushing her off the bed. Nat 2+7! Doesn't go well; he kind of headbutts the creature, but at least it lands off to one side. 8 points of damage for Riglan, but he holds onto his spell.

The lights on the spikes start to fade. Riglan's turn. He realises that strange tendrils he hadn't seen were attached to Nethza; they retract and release from her. Medicine 16+5->21; she's very injured, conscious but stable (0hp) kept there artificially. Bonus action: Healing Word. An emotional choice - he casts at the highest level he can - 6th level, for 21hp. She wakes up very groggy and confused and Riglan says - "it's not a dream. It's really us. We got here. We're rescuing you." She tries to speak, but coughs up phlegm and blood. Riglan says "Don't worry, don't try to to move, we're here. We'll get you out" and shouts to Maireagh, "We'll be out to help in a moment, we have Nethza" - and tells the draconic spirit to attack the construct outside.

It just about manages to make it outside - squeezing through the door. It's able to get past Maireagh and tries its rend attacks first. Sadly both miss, but the breath weapon works and the construct takes a full 10 points of radiant damage (just missing the dog). Maireagh tells the dog to disengage and retreat. She tells Temo that she'll drop her Intellect Fortress spell, instead switching to cast L3 Heat Metal on the construct. Parts of its steel structure start to glow red hot! It takes 3d8->12 fire damage. She picks up the hammer that she'd pulled out of the bag onto the floor; she calls "With me!" to the dog; it's a tight corridor and she's blocking the way. At this point Riglan's dragon can attack over her, but not with its breath weapon (unless it hits them too).

The construct heals 10gp and punches again - both at Maireagh, recognising her as the source of the heat spell and wanting to shut it down - but both miss. It looks above her, towards the dragon and does some strange thing where its mouth opens and a torrent of fire blasts out (a stored spell). The spirit fails its dex save. 5d8->16 damage.

Temo shouts "be right back Nethza!" and runs outside to see what's going on. He can see the construct; sharpshooter - no disadvantages. 22, hits. A max 12 main plus very strong 28 sneak damage, for 40, one of his highest ever non-crit damage rolls.

Riglan comes out and takes a look. He can't do much given all the clutter in the corridor - tries cantrip Frostbite, achieving 12 damage and also heals Nethza for another 12. The dragon is restricted to rend attacks now, so tries twice. It has a bad round - first is a miss, second is a crit but that's only 2d6+9 and it rolls only 4 for the 2d6 (13 damage). Well, it's *something*.

Maireagh uses her bonus action to re-trigger Heat Metal. A very strong 3d8->22 damage. She attacks twice with the hammer (melee). Hit and crit! The crit deals 14 damage, plus an arcane jolt within the crit; so 4d6 -> extra 17 damage. The other attack deals 11 damage...

...and that's *exactly* what was needed! The construct fails. 

Riglan says to Maireagh, "And *that's* why I don't wear metal armour". He runs in to pick up Nethza; he's easily strong enough. We collect in the corridor. "That was the easy part - now we've got get out".

We run back up the way we came. Lights are on. We dash. Maireagh asks Riglan, "have you got her?" "yes, I have her" - and she casts L2 Invisibility on him. Just in case! Temo follows suit, casing it on Maireagh. Riglan and Maireagh are now invisible, Temo relying on stealth... and rolls a nat 2, only 16. **Fucks sake**.

We hear a voice behind us. "Oh. Done already?" - it's Madam Bela.

Temo turns and says, "Not the experience I expected; but you did warn me. I guess I wasn't sure. It was certainly illuminating..." - deception check adv., 22 total. Madam Bela says, "Really? What do you mean, not the experience you expected?" and Temo says "I was aware that it wasn't real. There was a sensation of getting what I wanted, a sensation of pleasure, but it was somehow hollow. As if fake, or somehow misplaced. Hard to explain."

"Is that so?" she asks - CHA saving throw. Only 13... No spell advantage this time... She detects *something* is up, but can't quite put her finger on it because Temo's not lying per se. It's more something like - omission; yes, he's hiding something. "What are you not telling me? Did something happen?" and looks to head downstairs. Temo says, "That fucking crystal spiky thing is weird. The crystals on its back went red, I don't know what that means." - she looks shocked. "Red? Oh! Right. Did it attack you?" and Temo says, "I didn't wait around to find out!" Then she asks "Where are your guards?" - another deception nat 1, nat 1, nat 6 -> 11. Inevitable escalation. She says "stay right there, I'll be back!" and rushes towards the downstairs door.

Unseen, Riglan's stopped, waiting. Temo whispers, "we must protect Nethza - time to go!" and attempts to flee. He runs out as Lady Bela walks down the stairs. The rest of us follow, running full tilt.

We're outside, Riglan carrying Nethza. A very angry Madam Bela will surely not be far behind! There's a debate about going to the hotel or escaping the city via a tree, but just portaling into the rotting, vampire-infested wilderness seems somehow more dangerous than being in the Inner City with lots of people around.

Con save for Temo, 17+2->19, Riglan only 3+4->7, Maireagh 14. So Temo gets ahead, can't see his party, just runs full tilt to the lobby. Maireagh not far behind, but Riglan's struggling to keep up. At the lobby, Temo makes a bee-line for the concierge and says, "Sometimes, discretion in business is important. If anyone asks, regardless of rank, if I am here - I am *not* here, understood?" and is about to hand over 10gp - but then someone *else* says "Sir Temo!"

It's Robert. Oh boy, bad timing. "Ah, Mr Orin!" says Temo trying to regain composure. "Are you alright sir?" and Temo says, "Might have tried a business deal with the wrong person, back there..." "Do you want to go to your room?" "Yes!" and Temo hands the concierge 10gp after all - but just as he hands it over, he hears "STOP!" - it's Madam Bela with a City Watch guard running - "HIM! Him! That man was in my workshop! He damaged merchandise!"

Robert stands up, next to Temo. The guard runs up. "Which one? This one?" - pointing at Temo. "Impossible! He was with me doing business deals. We're about to go to his room. You, Madam Bela, must be mistaken. This is a different halfling!" - Temo turns to face them, casting Minor Illusion to make his face and front clothing look *slightly* different. Adv deception 21; it works! Madam Bela looks really surprised at first; then says, "wait, no, it - it must be him - it *is* him!" but the guard says that this person doesn't match the description. The concierge steps in, "Oh, I can vouch that Sir Robert and his guest have been here doing business dealings today" - and Sir Robert even pulls out the contract. "Look! This is proof" and the guard (now joined by another) runs up; but they say they "seem to have found the wrong person!" - and want to retrace steps, suggesting to Madam Bela that the suspect must have gone in the wrong direction. They're ushered out by the concierge, but he says "I strongly suggest making haste!"

Temo thanks the concierge. "Madam Bela has a rather unusual after-hours trade in people, and we happened to know one of them..." - it's a bit of an open secret, it transpires. Temo also asks the concierge to proceed with the "take the horses home" messenger plan.

Robert offers us a carriage; we say we don't want to get him into trouble, but he's "already in!" he says and insists. Do we have a bolthole? Well, sort of... Trade ring... At least for tonight. The concierge shows us a way out to the back, an alleyway; Robert gets a strange bird whistle and, to our surprise, a carriage pulls up. The driver wears a trihorn hat and apparently listened for the whistle. We all get inside.

"Horatio, questions later. Southern Gate, with haste!"

It turns out Robert had completed trading, but we weren't around - we were biding time in town, waiting to see Madam Bela. He wants to pay us 2000gp from his sale, after commission; Temo insists on 1900gp, with 100gp for his help right now.

Nobody seems on the look out for carriages; we do see some groups of guards hurrying, that *might* be looking for us. At the gate, Robert says, "I can go no further without drawing suspicion or attention upon where you go." "That's fine. Thanks for getting us this far." "It is has been a pleasure, and I wish you luck." Temo says, "Thank you - you helped save the life of one of my friends today."

Maireagh takes out a small ingot, an early cut from the mine, not full size; Mithril, in fact, maybe 200gp worth. She hands it to Robert, becoming visible as she does this. "Please. This is for you. For helping us, and helping a friend who you can't even see!" He responds after surprise, "My lady; I had a feeling you were good people and it feels right to be on your side. We do not know what the future holds; tomorrow brings what it brings. But today the fortunes of House Orin have been turned to align with yours. May we walk this path together, to each other's protection and benefit, until we meet again!"

So we pile out of the carriage, Riglan still invisible; Orin makes sure that the guards ask no questions by flashing a family insignia; we drop to mid city.

Riglan's very tired and invisibility is waning, so he wildshapes into a draft horse. He knees so Temo and Maireagh can get Nethza on his back, then Maireagh rides with her. Temo walks alongside and we make it down via alleys and passages - Temo's innate skills in towns are most useful - to the inn we found before. The others wait outside, while Temo goes in and asks for a room for the night, for four. "Across two rooms, I'm afraid". "It'll have to do, how much?" "Two rooms, for one night; 8sp". He pays - adding in one gold. "**That** is for if anyone asks about people who look like us, we're *not here*". She pushes it back! "That's included in your room price. We don't take well to authorities or mercenaries asking questions about our guests". Temo thanks her, heads out, tells everyone; well all carry Nethza up, but must pick a room. Temo insists on being in the room with Nethza. "But I'm better at protecting her!" says Maireagh. We look inside each room, they're across the hall from each other; small, spartan, two beds each. Temo says, "OK, we'll take this one - I'll go on a bed roll. Riglan, you're too tall anyway so you have the other room yourself to sleep. You can always call a bunch of animals if there's any trouble anyway!" and Maireagh offers him the dog too.

We all initially squeeze into one room to see how Nethza is. Riglan nature 18, Maireagh arcana only 13, Temo medicine only 6! Riglan at least figures out that something has *psychically* drained her. She's been kept on a cocktail of herbs that keep her weak. It's a condition, compounded with exhaustion. Riglan has enough energy left to try Greater Restoration. He casts; and it's like an aura of twilight sun, soft, surrounding her; then illusions of vines, leaves, flowers seem to flit across, wrapping around her and then fading away; and that's it.

Nethza had been a very unusually pale blue; at least her skin colour seems to pick up a darker tone, acquiring a little bit of its familiar purple too. **She opens her eyes**. Still clearly very tired, but looks like she can rest now.

"I saw you... I *saw* you!" she says, looking to Temo. "And Riglan, you were carrying me" - Maireagh says, "I was there too!" "Oh, yes. Maireagh. You are here! But - where am I?" Riglan says, "still in Citeaux. We didn't know how badly hurt you were and I didn't want to risk the open country, it's very rough out there as you know." "How many days until the full moon?" Riglan says, "About 3, from now, it's late at night; we're in the outer ring of the city." Marieagh says, "Lassie - you need to sleep. We can talk about this tomorrow." (Holds her hand) "I'm glad you're back. I'm glad you're back with us... We've been looking for you..." Netzha says, "You shouldn't have come in to the Shadowfell to find me! It's not safe here!" "Nonsense. Couldn't let you run off in here alone. Who's gonna help me with the housework at the Tower?!" and Temo says, "Who's going to teach the kids at the school?" Riglan says, "Besides, we could't let you have all the fun..."

Nethza suddenly remembers the children. "Oh no! ..." - but we explain that they're fine, then Maireagh sort of kicks us out. Riglan and Temo end up sat on the bed in the other room; Riglan says, "Wait, are you supposed to be in there?"

Riglan talks to Temo; How did he keep his composure, walking into that? And then convincing Bela to leave? Temo has impressed and surprised Riglan before, but this is far and above anything he imagined that his friend might be capable of. Riglan's not sure he'd have ever had the mental fortitude to avoid giving himself away and sure he would *not* have had the ability to deceive/persuade Madam Bela of his true intentions. "I know we haven't chosen to view things this way before, but I owe you one for that. Big time."

A while later, Temo sneaks back in to sleep on the floor. Riglan sends his fey friend spider over, so he can watch too. We sleep.
