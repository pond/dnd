# Riglan: Part 3.5
## Day 16 ("day" 13 in Shadowfell, day 12 of 15-day cycle)
### 8am or thereabouts

We awake in the Trade Ring inn, having narrowly escaped Madam Bela and rescued Nethza the previous night - but we expect her to be in hot pursuit.

Riglan wakes first and heads across the hall - his spider's gone by morning of course - he's suddenly anxious; knocks on the door; "it's me!" - no reply! - he tries to open it; it's not locked. The room is empty.

Riglan briefly panics, then checks the room for belongings. Their stuff is still there; they wouldn't leave it. The dog is with Riglan too. Riglan looks at the dog. He's never talked to the dog before, not as a command. He tires - "Dog. Lead me to Marieagh", but picks up as much kit as he can carry first.

The dog appears to respond; it starts to wander the hall, its head sweeping left and right, as if smelling the air. It then stops and sits in front of the bathroom - and at that moment the door opens. Maireagh, "What are you doing with all our stuff?!" and Riglan says, "FOR FUCK'S SAKE! Don't do that to me." "Do what?" "You all disappeared and didn't tell me!" Nethza pops her head out. "It's girl's stuff!" And Riglan retorts, "Where's Temo then?" and Maireagh says, "Where do you think? Getting food!"

Riglan puts the stuff back in the room (grumpily).

When Maireagh and Nethza come out and into that room, Maireagh gives Nethza some clothes she had grabbed at the last minute. Quite a lot of her clothes actually. As they're debating that Riglan cuts in. He explains how it was Maireagh and Nethza who were always there to catch Temo or Riglan. They always felt indomitable; undefeatable. It's hard to describe the emotions rushing through Riglan as we flee, carrying a barely-conscious Nethza, who seems so frail and defenceless. Riglan also can't quite imagine what Temo must've gone through alone in that room with the *thing* that was attached to Nethza, and Madam Bela.

So he says she must forgive him - but he might be a bit... Clingy for a while.

Netzha later explains that she wants to go somewhere safe; but she feels like she needs to be here; she wants to be here almost; her spirit shadow disappeared when she got here and she doesn't know where it's gone. Perhaps it didn't like Citeaux or something. She thinks that's why she made mistakes and got into trouble? "But you're here now. I don't know whether I should stay here... Whether this tug to be here is real? Whether there's something we're supposed to figure out. What I know is we *cannot* be here when the next hunt begins." Riglan asks, "Why?" "Because I don't know *when* we will wake up. From what I've seen, Citeaux changes a *lot*. So I don't know where is safe."

We explain what we know about Azalin, the extraplanar darkness and the Raven Queen. Nethza says that her shadow spirit was, she thinks, sent by the Raven Queen. BUT - she doesn't think that's her patron. She only came through with a book she was holding and her clothes when she was pulled in - and that was a book about the Raven Queen. But it's missing now. She had it on her when she went to the Inner City, but now it's gone - perhaps stolen, or discarded.

We also learn that Nethza has been here - well, this coming full moon is her fourth! She's been here more than 40-55 days or so.

Riglan mentions how we dived through the rift essentially ASAP; the teacher closed it behind us; Perception 21 - Nethza is now crying. He stops mis-sentence; "I'm so sorry! What did I - What's wrong?" "I can't believe you guys came through a *rift* to find me. You came after me. You had no idea what was here. I'm just afraid I've doomed you all!" Riglan thinks for a minute, then says, "If it had been Maireagh, or Temo, or me; would *you* have hesitated? This is who we are now. We don't leave anyone behind."

(Temo arrives part-way through this and sits quietly, listening)

Nethza sighs and changes topic. "The reason I don't think the Raven Queen is my patron is because I feel like she's been following me; watching over me with this shadow; and she has no other way of knowing what's happening. Whoever my patron is, has a direct connection to me. They'd know." "Ah. They wouldn't need a watcher?" "No, that's right. I don't think she's evil, but she's an enigma; not benevolent - not alturistic. But I don't know what my relationship with her is. Why she's following me. Why she's so interested."

Riglan says, "We met people on our own journey, including the Vestani..." and Nethza jumps in at this; "Yes, I encountered them but not for long; they seemed afraid of me?" and Riglan says, "Yes, we were luckier but in our dealings it became apparent that there's some power you have, or some connection to this domain you have, which makes you significant. I mean, it shouldn't surprise you to know that you were pulled here for a reason -" "I don't know why though!" "- us neither, but we suspect Azalin wants you. There are dark factions in the council in this time, and they know about the three of us; they tried to kill us; and they're operating well beyond the law" - and we explain more, as best we can; suppositions and all.

Nethza has a bit of an epiphany. She'd moved forwards and backwards between moons, but the jump back to the current time was the biggest jump she's ever made. She wonders if that's linked to us; a new entrant sees the future, then gets sent back in time. We talk more about our various journeys:

* Our night of the hunt at the abbey, where the Raven Queen tried to dissuade us from following
* The Gnoll Witherling attacks; the council member, probably in the palace, seems to indicate they or Azalin wanted to stop us for some reason
* Nethza has been trying to keep away from Citeaux but would have intense dreams and somehow ended up always on the path here, despite her best efforts
* We mention her noted departure from Quietsedge. She reveals that she's got gaps in memory - sleep-running! She didn't know what was happening; she'd wake up tired, "somewhere else"
* It seems she ran on her own two feet from Quietsedge, so that's probably what's going on
* She also finds the domain not so much tropey, though it is, but can almost predict what people will say before they do. As if, perhaps, this *is* a construct of her own mind; a waking nightmare

Nethza does not know what must be done in Citeaux. But she knows we need a safe place. The old oak tree Riglan could use is a couple of days away and probably too far if we want to continue investigations here. "In that case", says Riglan, "I'll let our horses know that they'll be taken home by someone else and we can do this on foot."

(So Riglan heads off, chats to the horses a while, lets them know that they'll be escorted home and lets the stablehand know to expect a messenger to that end in due course).

We decide to walk out, then, to investigate outside villages for some - well, chapel, abbey, something stone ideally, sturdy, defensible.

On the way out we ask the innkeeper if a larger room that might fit all of us is available tonight, but if not we'll keep the two smaller ones. She checks, then tells us that her cousin might have an answer. She'll tell us later.

(We ask about the theatre for whom Nethza danced; he didn't give her up really - he allowed her to give a performance to a high-ranking member of the Kargat, to get her a position in the inner city. He shouldn't feel guilty. Nethza doesn't know who the Kargat member was, but *he* was **Order Of The Rose** - he had a red rose insignia and the theatre director had described the order by name.)

Nethza suggests the soup kitchen might be a good place to start asking about bolthole churches! We head back there. We ask for our old friend, half-ogre Jamison. We're told to go around into a service entrance. We get through into the main room anywhere, with some kind of argument about the flow in the room as people come through "but it can't be changed, it'll confuse everyone!" then he spots us. "Oh!" says another; "Oh, miss! We haven't seen you in days! How've you been?" Nethza looks bashful - "I ran into a bit of trouble... But it's all OK now..." and then Jamison wants us to weigh in on his argument about flow. Nethza suggests that since everyone signs in, tell them "pick the shorter line, it's a new system to make it faster to serve food!" - Jamison seems vindicated.

We follow him back into the kitchen. He is surprised we don't want to be in the city - surely that's the safest place! - he tells us about one that's 3 hours ride away, or maybe 4 hours as a brisk walk. That sounds good. We want to help in return; we're expecting to help in the main room with service, but could help in prep now, actually. Nethza wants prep, not main room understandably - Riglan rescues Maireagh; "Why don't you join me in the main room?" so Temo is on prep too - already looking over-enthusiastic. "Might not be baking, this time, Temo!" warns Riglan.

The kitchen preps stew. They have a *cartload* of pork bones; Jamison can get "a pound of these for just 2 coppers!" - and then he boils them up in huge vats, to make a broth. Various vegetables, old mushy tomatoes, lentils etc. thicken things up, which all need preparation. It starts to come together pretty well; unwanted vegetables might *look* strangely shaped or whatever, but they still taste as good in a stew!

Riglan's asked "which ones need seasoning?" - perception 21; finds the right pots. Then Jamison opens - a seemingly prized - pouch; Arcana 16, looks like a magic spice bag of sorts! It helps add flavour. A bit of joy in an otherwise rather bleak world. He's liberal with the seasoning.

In the main room, it's all about tables and chairs again, shuffling things around for the new flow. Easy enough. Everything is set up, the food is ready, it's still pretty early; the pots now just simmer down for a few hours.

During conversations, Jamison recommends an abbey we should seek.

### 2pm

It would take us a while to get out to the abbey that was described, and back again; 4 hours each way, so it'd be late night. We figure that's now a "tomorrow" thing. We head outside and in the distance can see a procession of people coming down from the mountain pass. Just ahead of us, to our surprise, **we see someone leading Snow White, Brian and Slasher along**. Brian turns, looks to us. He brays. The other two turn to look too. More horse noises. Riglan says in horse, "Safe journey and thank you."

We get to the accommodation first, to see if the tiefling owner has any news for us. She does. A room for 4 with a cousin of hers; not in the trade ring, well, on the edge. She gives us the address and we figure we might as well head there. On the way over, Riglan proposes that maybe we just go to the old playbook. Find a busy inn, or merchant area, or something - Festhall-style - and listen. Just see what we can learn.

We're headed across town; the tiefling's cousin works at an inn on the manufacturing side (Blue rather than Red). Upon arrival we notice less distinction between trade ring and mid-city here; it's less run-down. Fewer homeless, for starters. People down on their luck, without education or skill, can often find menial work in trade, but manufacturing or performing is more skilled and can be harder to work within.

The inn is behind a carpentry workshop of sorts. Noise and smell during the day, though not at night; Riglan isn't too happy, the smell of chopped wood! But it's OK.

Rooms are a bit more expensive, understandably. For four, it sets us back 12sp - paid. We're shown to a room that's modest but not squalid (!) and has space. Comfortable beds, as two bunk beds. The room is maybe 15ft wide by 15ft deep - decent enough, though too small for Temo's hut spell. Maireagh has a new trick though - a private sanctum of sorts (level 13 feature, has L4 spells now). Sounds good, we'll use that.

We discuss sneaking back into the inner city. Nethza thinks it is high risk and will do it, if it's required now that we're all together. Riglan says, "nah, it's a shot in the dark. We've no idea what we don't know and we don't know how to fill in those gaps. It's just random, really, and while the inner city seems more likely to have higher level information like that, gossip can be revealing sometimes too. Overlooked, overworked servants with alcohol-loosened tongues!"

Surveying the area, there are four places.

* The Clockwork Gnome
* Soot & Sundry
* The Empire Tavern
* Liberty & Justice

Ugh. "Liberty & Justice", sounds awful, that's the one. If we're going to overhear bullshit anywhere... We head in.

Big signs, cursive, "Liberty", or heavy font, "Justice", adorn walls. The moment we open doors we can also hear that it's noisy, lively, bustling; someone plays a sitar (!) in the performance area. It's quite large. Long bench tables, which might help with our shameless eavesdropping, but there are smaller tables of 4 along the walls. A bar takes up one end opposite a performance stage. Double-doors next to the bar lead to a kitchen from which strong smells of grilling and frying emanate.

Someone shouts, "find some seats, you can get drinks from Liberty at the bar, and I'll take food orders from you" - so we go to the bar. Riglan says, "Nethza, allow me to buy you a drink" and puts his hand on her shoulder. "Sure. Of course." A woman with tusks on her lower jaw - orc, half-orc? - behind the bar, comes up to us. Long hair is tied back and braided. "Good afternoon! What can I get ya? You new here? I can recommend the house brew?" - Riglan tries a sample of house brew. Kind of crisp and spicy, almost oaty. "Nice! Thanks. I'll take one" (Temo says, "Me too!", Maireagh same) - Nethza asks about something lighter? Liberty has one that's made of wheat. Light. "OK!" - we ask for food too - she shouts to the kitchen. "Just! Just! Is the dinner ready?" and a gruff voice calls back, "Yeah, yeah I can take it out of the oven now - it's boar!" - 2gp all-in.

We look for space on the long tables, in the middle somewhere. Not too hard - about 1/3 away from the bar, which is handy as it gives some distance to the performer. We nurse drinks and listen... Perception:

* Nethza 19
* Temo 23
* Riglan 24 + d4->2 from Maireagh via Guidance -> 26

Riglan, in particular, focuses in on a group a few seats further away, close to the stage, shouting over the music. Temo hears them too.

* "How did it go in there? The thing you said you were doing?" "Oh, with the federation?" "Yeah, was that who it was? I thought you said it was one of the lords?" "Well yes, the lords basically *own* the trade federation!" "Oh. Right. But did it go OK?!"
* "I think so. We've secured another year's worth of contracts. I don't know where we'll find the labour but they want all of the ore that we can find - I'm not sure what they need it for, but they want to buy it raw." "Raw? But that'll upset the balance - what about - what about all of the smelters and the smiths in the outer city?" "Well it's an open market; if they want to meet the price of the federation, they're welcome to try. I mean - I've got a family to feed. I'd be a fool not to take this deal!"
* "Do they have room for more?" asks the other - "Well if you give me a good price, you can sell me your ore; for what they want it'll take more than two of us" - "So shall I bring my ore into Citeaux?" "Well, what if we came up with some kind of deal and I took over your operation?" "I couldn't do that. I don't think my dad would be happy with me doing that..." "Well think about it. You get a nice big payday, you don't have to worry and I'll look after your people." "Hmm - I mean - I don't know about that..." "I'm just saying, think about it. These sorts of offers - we don't know how long these lords what this ore for or what they want it for. You've gotta strike while the iron is hot!"

Another table, heard just by Riglan:

* "They're interested in silver! They want us to sell them as much as possible. It's crazy, as if they're hoarding it. I'm making a killing! Times have never been this good."

Nethza and Temo note shaking of hands and a deal going down at a table by the far wall. At that moment, on our table, a big, *very* furry - almost werewolf-like - guy, comes up. He's wearing an apron and chef's hat, holding a large tray of four meals. OK, so that's "Justice". We move things out of the way and the tray is dropped down. "Enjoy!". As he heads off, Temo sees something has gone sour with the deal at the table far away; he senses friction and animosity. He whispers, "Riglan!" and points; "Spider?"

Riglan goes with a common housefly instead! It buzzes over and sits on the wall nearby. He catches part of the conversation where the one who seems to be getting defensive is saying:

* "Wait, no, but we *agreed*..."
* "Well no! We were discussing something. I never 'agreed' and I'm definitely not going to agree to *those* terms. That's not what you said last time."
* "Are you being *difficult*? Because you know it's not in your best interests to be difficult with *me*..."
* "Are you threatening me?!"
* "I'm not threatening you. I'm just - warning you. Bad things might happen if you cross the Kargat."
* "Yeah but you're not Kargat, so, y'know - stop. Stop threatening me. This is a business proposition! The terms have changed and I'm not OK with agreeing to these modified terms. I can do better!"
* "You will *never* trade in the Trade Ring again if you turn this down. You might as well never come back to Citeaux."
* "What?! Who *are* you? You don't have the power to do that - my family has been trading in Citeaux for generations... Who are you?"
* "Me? I'm just an intermediary. But *you* are about to make the worst decision of your life. Now, I'm a reasonable and kind person. I'm giving you one last chance to back out of this corner you just put yourself in. And not just yourself! Think about your family - everyone who depends on you. This could be a sweet, sweet deal. You just have to send the shipments and not ask questions about them."
* "But... Well... But... I mean... What's in them? What is it that we're transporting?"
* "What part of 'ask no questions' don't you understand? We're paying you above market prices for a reason."
* "It's not dangerous goods is it?"
* "Again with the questions!"
* "I have to think about -"
* "No! This offer expires when I leave the table. You'd better decide - correctly - *now*. Now, y'know I wouldn't do this for just anyone, but you're an old friend of my family, so..." - he pulls out a bag - "...here is 100 gold up-front. You'll not get a better deal than this."
* The guy gives in... "All right, all right - you promise me we won't get in trouble for what we're doing?"
* "Oh, no - in fact you'll be working on the side of the law. You're on the side of the good guys now" - and hands the gold over.
* "Be there at 9pm tonight for your first pickup."
* "OK. Alright. OK..." - he finishes his drink, takes the bag of money ("Count it if you want, but I wouldn't take 100 gold out at a tavern if I were you!") - puts it in his bag and starts to walk away.
* "You're welcome, by the way."
* "What?"
* "You're welcome."
* "...OK. Thank you..."

Riglan whispers to Temo, "Follow the guy leaving, but don't be seen". Nethza out of nowhere creates some illusions, dancing, so Temo is able to slip away just as Maireagh makes him invisible! Riglan keeps watching the other guy, with the fly.

Dex save for the fly - nat 20! The guy left at the table looks up, picks up something and tries to swat the fly. The fly dodges and flies away, so Riglan has to let that one go.

Meanwhile, Temo follows - acrobatics check 20 - has to dodge lots of people to not break Invisibility. The guy steps outside, reaches for the bag of gold then changes his mind. He looks both ways on the street, crosses the road and starts walking to the right; he's heading further out from the centre. About a block and a half later, he enters an inn. Temo watches closely; modest; "**The Wagon Arch**". It's next to a wagon sales & repair outlet. Acrobatics 16; he *just* manages to slide in behind the guy before the front door shuts. The guy doesn't head for stairs; says "hi" to someone in a side office. "I won't be needing another night..." "Wait, but... I can't give you a refund, because it's after checkout!" "Oh. OK. Well that's... That's alright!" - and the guy moves on towards a corridor on that level. Temo assumes he's going to his room. Temo follows. The guy knocks on a door; it opens. Another young guy there. "What is it, **George**? You look - why do you look so worried?" "Well, there's a good news and bad news - but - get packed. We need to get the wagon. We've a pickup tonight. Do you trust me?" "Of course, you're my brother" "Alright. Let's do the pickup. We'll go get the horses and wagon and... I'll pick my stuff up from my room. Can you be ready in five?" "Yeah, I'll come get you from your room".

George goes to the next room; unlocks; Temo follows. George stops suddenly. "**Josh**?" and Temo says, "Please don't be scared, I mean you no harm!" - and Temo is visble. Temo says, "It was an invisibility spell. I didn't want to be seen by the guy you were dealing with at the tavern." Persuasion 28. "I have guards in the next room!" and Temo says, "fair enough, so you know I can't do anything to try and hurt you." "Yeah...? What do you know?"

So Temo gets into it - more interested in the *other* guy. And sounds like George had no choice but to take the deal and however shitty it is, it's probably best that he *did* take it. Temo encourages him to count the money now, since fiddling with that coin purse is *really* obvious! George counts - 100gp, for real. But he reveals that he's basically signed over his caravan company to this other dude; him and the brother still own it, but they can't really turn down any jobs and *must* transport whatever they want. Things need to be moved to It Kal itself - out, over through Kings Pass. That needs a royal permit; the other guy gave that to him and that's where disagreements start. George shows Temo a big pressed metal plate that is the "royal pass" that can't be forged.

In the end an agreement is struck. The caravan will be loaded just outside the Western Gate of the Inner City. Wow. *Loaded* there? "Yes, everything about this smells horrifically wrong!"

Deep in conversation Temo doesn't notice the door open - it's Josh - "Hey, George are you - wait, what?!" and Temo has to bluff. "Hey kid, I'm finalising details here! Beat it!" (deception only 15) and George gives him an "it's OK look" - "OK, I'll wait for you at the wagoneers George". Josh says, "And the crow flies at night" and George responds, "And the dog howls at the moon". Temo says, "That's the worst safety code ever. You need to work on that. I didn't want to drag your brother into anything; I'm worried I might have put you at risk as it is."

So, George finishes packing. Temo heads out. Outside, Josh nods to him as Temo leaves. Temo strides past confidently (as much as a halfling can) heading back quickly towards Liberty & Justice. The food's going cold.

He gets back and one meal is left - they eat fast! - so in between hurried mouthfulls he fills them in.

### 6pm

Soup kitchen helping!

### 8:30pm

By just before 9pm we're at the West Gate to the Inner City. It takes about 20 or so minutes to get across there. We intend to hide out and watch for the wagons, but it's an ornate, guarded gate. It's an open road, leading here; we figure Riglan's still-active fly can be used to watch what happens, then we might have to try and board the carvan *as it leaves* since the guards will be too all-over-it otherwise and we can't be inside *before* goods loading anyway.

Maireagh will make Nethza and herself invisible. Dog in the bag again, since it seems to now be a Thing (sorry dog). Riglan can become an owl or similar. Temo will use Major Image of a bolting horse that causes the caravan to halt, having it dash away again if anyone approaches to try and control it; with Nethza helping all three fly to get ahead of the caravan (Riglan can catch up as his flying wildshape self). That'll do. Temo will have to rely on stealth to get aboard. He will change into his darkest coloured clothing!

We're just about to put the plan into motion when Riglan stops a moment and says, "hey, look at us. All four again."

We wait... The caravan arrives. Josh and George are sat at the front. It's a covered wagon, just the one, but long. Two draft horses pull it. Quite impressive, all-in. The wagon is pulled up alongside the gate. Both get down and head to the guards; there is a brief discussion; they wait; the guards don't seem happy - they'll give them 10 minutes, no more, then the wagon must leave else be arrested! Only a few seconds later, the gates open from the other side and hand-pushed cards with large crates are visible behind. Someone wearing some kind of official-looking decorative red and black armour - painted, or burnished, looks almost like an insect carapace - with cape is present. They instruct the loading process. George and Josh seem to do most of the heavy work. Once everything is loaded - and there are, strangely, only 8 crates so the wagon is mostly empty - they lower the tarp, loosely secure it and jump back up.

Riglan perception 26. He notices that George has, a couple of times, very poorly and quite obviously looked around as if nervous and looking for someone or something - hopefully, us! The guy in the armour doesn't seem to care about what they're doing at all, though; seems more interested in just being officious - exerting authority on the guards and workers. George is kind of delaying; the guards say "You're loaded. You can go." George wants to wait. "You're loaded! Go now!" they insist. So George, looking slightly despondant, gets aboard. They ride.

The plan is on. We'd realised after much discussion that a really good place to do our plan is just as they're leaving the city - there's a single road there, no other routes. Netzha asks if we should fly now; only lasts 10 minutes, so might not be enough. We figure we'll run on foot first, so pursue, Temo using his city skills to navigate through back streets and alleys.

He tells us eventually that we're close to the city exit, a couple of blocks away. Nethza casts Fly; Maireagh casts Invisibility; Temo is ready with Major Image; Riglan turns into an owl. From here, we have to assume everyone is playing their part.

Temo flies up to get a good view of the gate and the cart; when the time is right, he flies in close enough to cast, keeping low, just above roofs and his horse illusion is brought into play. It works! The cart is slowed and stopped abruptly. The convincing panicked horse whickers and rears up, while Temo uses sleight of hand - 16+16->32! - to unite the tarp in a corner so we can get in; then retie; the horse is made to ride off. We hear complaints form the front. Josh, "Damned thing! It slowed us down for nothing!" George is fine; but Josh knows something's up. The two argue a bit about it. Riglan sends the fly down to sit directly in front of George. Josh shoes it. The fly lands again in front of George, basically dancing with its feet. Josh notices something odd about the fly. Will George figure it out? "Maybe it's not me" says George "who is skittish; maybe it's you."

But now, George has to tell Josh where he's going. "It Kal". Josh stops the wagon, *hard*. It skids, the horses complaining. The two now *really* argue. Temo gives up, sticks his head through the tarp at the front, and explains to Josh. Persuasion adv. because George backs him up - 2,nat-20+15 -> 35, mad. Their dad had said, before he died, "In this world, family is the only thing you know you actually have. You boys have to look out for each other, ahead of anyone else. You're all you've got." Josh is angry about secrets being kept.

The question about cargo arrives. We'd almost forgotten! Riglan, Detect Magic. The crates aren't magic, but contents are. Slightly different magic in each one - implication, artefacts. Temo wants to open one, since they're not magically warded, in a way that can be closed again. Thieves tools, proficiency yielding slight-of-hand advantage - nat 20 again! 36 total, insane. He opens them *all*.

(Meanwhile Riglan notes that Josh is quite smart, George is more trusting and hopeful, but perhaps naive - but is the elder brother.)

Each crate contains one small or medium-sized magic item, that is wrapped in silk and set amongst cotton padding. Different in each. We don't recognise what they are; one is a saddle, another a shield, another a beautiful, ornate helm with wings going up the side and a visor; there's a huge swirling crystal globe made of black crystal set on clawed feet; there's some kind of ornate mirror with an angel's face at the top, cherub's hands "holding" the sides - it's a bit much...

This sounds very like a contribution to Azalin Rex's hoard. Temo surmises that the reason they don't want people knowing what is being delivered, is because the value of these items must be in tens of thousands of gold, at least. Someone could just ride off with it all.

Temo goes up front and says, "Best you don't know what you're carrying, but it's not evil, it's not people, it's just stuff. But you're not supposed to know and if anyone read your mind to see if you'd looked, you'd be in trouble."

Well, it's an hour ride to It Kal. We settle in, and figure out how we're going to get *out* now, undetected, at It Kal - if we want to do that. More invisibility probably. Riglan can be a spider and just sit on a shoulder, becoming invisible by proxy.

At least we get a short rest!

### 10pm

Eventually the carriage approaches It Kal. Temo whispers to the two up front, "Try not to keep looking nervously around this time! We'll do our thing, just finish up, head away and assume we're not on board for your return journey."

We've crossed the bridge and head up the road that weaves up the hill to the palace. There's actually a small settlement established here, around the base of the hill. Some stables, an inn; looks like services for people who have business at It Kal for some reason but can't stay there. No buildings get close to the palace though.

As we head up, Riglan sees beautiful flowering trees around the hill. Riglan sees one or two that might be big enough for a portal...

Soon, it's definitely not wild. Things look planted now, a garden around the whole palace. It looms above. It seems half palace, half fortress; castle-like. Magnificent-looking circular towers rise up to a larger diameter "lump" of building on top, steep circular cone tiled roofs; gothic style. One is shorter and wider, one very much taller but a lot more slender. Very tall walls. Irregular shape; not a square/rectangle castle, much more complex.

The gate is close ahead. As we approach, Temo, peeking through the front canvas, notes a gatehouse near the gardens a short distance away. We're stopped. "Halt. What business do you have at It Kal?" - the brothers say, "Don't know, here to deliver things, didn't ask any questions"... They hand over the plate. The guard holds up a lantern. Temo thinks it might be magical but Arcana 3+4, he has no way of knowing; he doesn't recognise it. The guard pulls on a rope; after a moment of delay, the brothers looking nervous, there is the grinding sound of chains and a drawbridge is lowered from the other side. Temo hadn't been able to see that there was a moat. As we go over, peeking over the back, we realise it's not a moat; it's a cliff - a chasm. We'd seen the big earlier bridge from our hillside entry in the caravan before, but we weren't able to see this crazy drop. It's a very heavily defended castle. More or less impossible to reach with the drawbridge up, without scaling a cliff or magical - but obvious - flying.

The walls have gargoyles, looking down at us. It looks ominous and menacing. It's not a fairytale castle at all - clearly evil! The nearly-full moon sits behind from our perspective and casts things into deep shadows and silvery-blue highlights.

The caravan pulls through the gate and we suddenly feel a heavy, ominous, magical presence. An awareness. Riglan figures that *something* probably already knows we're here, but we'll roll with it. Then the caravan stops; it's a courtyard. We hear Josh and George loudly (thank you) asking people where to put their deliveries. The guards seem confused until some paperwork is handed over. The point out a particular door; stuff should be taken to that door and someone there will sign it off.

Riglan turns into a spider and sits on Temo's shoulder; Maireagh and Nethza are made invisible by Maireagh; Temo makes them invisible. As we slip past George, Temo whispers a quiet "thank you".

The courtyard has, looming up on all three sides except for the main gate, walls rising up about three storeys. The one in front is taller, maybe 5 storeys. Windows and balconies look inwards, over the courtyard. There's a door to our right, another further along on the same building; given its design and windows, might be quarters maybe? Doors are shut though. To the left is a door to which the goods are being taken, so not that one! Near the main gate, probably a stables; another door near, flickering light, maybe a furnace? Then there's the most obvious thing - beautiful curved steps leading to a grand main entrance, guards stationed on either side. We can see a guard walking on parapets above the gatehouse.

The stable doors are open and an exit further in is unlikely but we check it anyway (Riglan whispering instructions). A few horses here, but Riglan's a spider and can't talk to them. No exits, but if Riglan gets the chance, speaking to the horses could be useful. Next, we try to find a way in to the furnace. An alleyway next to the stables leads with steps *down* to a lower entrance door. Temo risks trying to open it. Unlocked, so he's still invisible. The door opens and it's immediately obvious, this is a smithy with a furnace.

Temo perception dirty 20. Two creatures. One is an ogre, working bellows. The other is a *very* pale-skinned dwarf. Ah - duergar. We saw them in the earth temple. The duergar stops and sniffs the air suddenly. Lifts goggles. Looks around, squinting with grey eyes; can't see anything though; lowers the goggles and goes back to bashing metal. Temo starts breathing again and closes the door - hoping the others came in! - and we go to a room at the back via an open doorway. It is full of ore. Huge amounts. Crates and crates, not smelted yet. It looked in the other room like they were making really links of a big chain. Each link would be a foot long on the long axis.

There's another side room to check out so (with appropriate quiet whispers) we head there - Stealth adv. all round, Temo bad roll, 7,7+16->only 23; Maireagh gets 20, not bad at all for her, but Riglan and Nethza only 15. Despite that, somehow we're not noticed and get to the other room, that seems to be at the front. There are racks of armour and pikes; halberds; spears. It's the sort of stuff we saw the guards wearing and carrying. There's a door at the very front. It'd lead out into the courtyard.

We'll have to sneak our way back out to the stables and come up with a new plan. We try to time it with hammer blows and manage to get out successfully.

We need a plan B! Perhaps none of the parts of the castle off the courtyard lead any deeper; it'd certainly make sense for security if they were all isolated with only the main entrance doors available as a way in or out.

Temo notices the guards are a bit lax. There's a drawbridge, it's up; they seem bored. Temo whispers, "The unloading finished - at that other door - so why would anyone hang around there? Let's try it - we'll time opening it for then guards aren't looking".

We head near the door and have to wait. D20->18, DM request. After an eternity of about 12 minutes, both guards nearby look up at a clock tower that hangs above the presumed-barracks area. It says "11", so it's 11pm. Late. They start walking towards the barracks; shift change; that's our chance. Temo tries the door. Locked! Damn! He's visible; sleight-of-hand to open it; nat 20+16->36. Phew. Takes only a second to get it open and we all sneak inside.

There's some kind of entry hallway with various boots and shoes along one side. Jackets and similar hang on pegs. To the right, slightly muddy footprints go down some stairs that way. Two sets. So much for taking off the boots. Ah! That'll be George and Josh. At this point Temo realises our own footprints might be there so uses the cleaning stone on the floor where we've stood and on our feet.

There's a short corridor leading to another room, or the stairs. Down seems interesting, so we sneak that way. Stacked on the left wall we recognise the crates from before. On the right, other crates of different sizes and styles; stacks of other items around. This looks like a holding area, not a stored hoard! There are stairs on the far side leading back up. Those would seem to lead towards the palace interior; we sneak up to check it out. A door.

Temo messages spider-Riglan to say "tap front feet for yes and back feet for no!" then whispers that he should check behind the door. All three of us lean forward and squint at this tiny spider tapping its - back? Front? yes, front legs. Riglan wanders down and squeezes under the door.

A very short hallway meets a corridor in a t-junction. Riglan moves to the roof and walks forward to the junction. It's quiet. Nobody around. He heads back and walks up the door to eye-level with Temo. Temo takes a while then notices him; "is it safe to go through?" - front legs tap. Temo tries the door; unlocked. We go through, invisible Nethza closing it quietly behind. Advance to the junction. Nobody. Light in both directions. To the left, it climbs a bit and towards the right it drops. Both sides appear to open onto rooms with soft, dim light inside. We think the right leads more towards the palace grand entrance so instead we head left, even though we figure catacombs are a goal, yet this is upwards.

We travel slowly, quietly and cautiously. We seem to be in a servant's walkway, and we've reached the side of a long gallery with oppressive-looking, 20ft tall windows set into stone directly in front, heavy curtains flanking each, looking out towards the lights of Citeaux. There's art, suits of armour, armchairs that look towards the windows; big tapestries; but there is nobody here. In the middle are tables with arrangements of crystals and objects. We don't know what they're for. Decorative? Who knows. Grand double doors are at the end of the gallery to our right. To the left, is a smaller, single door. Temo says, "Riglan?" - front legs tap - Riglan heads under. It's a kitchen, or an assembly room for one. He comes back out. "Safe to enter?" asks Temo and Riglan does nothing. Temo looks confused, then says, "No point entering?" - front legs tap. Riglan then starts to walk away from the kitchen door, then turns, looks at Temo, then turns apparently to walk to the wall! Temo cranes his head around the corner, to get a better look along the gallery, and sees two other doors on the side our little corridor enters that he hadn't seen before. He whispers to the others, "two more small doors". Riglan goes under the nearest.

That door leads to another dark hallway; this one has doors coming off it on either side. Rooms. Could be servants again; he wanders under the closest one on the right. A store room. On the left, a cleaning room. He comes back to Temo; signals "safe"; we proceed and everyone gets into the corridor. It's dark so Temo uses his goggles. We proceed along the corridor carefully; after cleaning room & store room, some kind of break/hang-out room next left and a wet room of sorts on the right. We vaguely entertain the whole "pretending to be servants" thing but can't see any uniforms. There's no door at the end of the corridor. Damn.

Turn around, head back to the door to the gallery; Temo asks Riglan to check the next side door along; so Riglan once again wanders out. He goes under the last single door off the gallery and sees a long corridor, no doors on the right, but given its proximity to the one we were just in, can't be much space for any sizeable rooms, so really it just goes all the way to the end and there are more doors. This seems to connect to more significant rooms. Riglan retreats, more front foot tapping, we sneak into that corridor; the first door we reach is on the left. Riglan checks that. Wood panels, a lot of books. Two-storey; a library, with ladders going up the bookcases. Big heavy dark wood tables are in the middle of the room. More double-doors in this one at the left. Riglan peeks under the double doors; it's the gallery from before. Ah, these connect. On the other side, double doors again, peeks under those; a strange space, marble floors; then he realises, it's *underneath* stairs, grand staircase that these doors open under part of their overhang. Probably the main atrium. Under the stairs is a small room; has look. Small door, under the door, it's just another store room. Dustpans, brooms and so-on. He returns all the way back to Temo and signals, in essence, "pointless", so, we have one more door in this corridor.

Riglan ventures forth under the door once more. Oh. *This* is the grand foyer, the entrance of the palace. Soaring. To the left, bottom of the stone steps, so he realises that the library did connect to this but was tucked away.

Well, it's *fairly* dark. Nobody else around. Riglan wanders out into the foyer. There's a massive chandelier, wrought iron with candles, a few are lit. Underneath is large, pentagonal stone table with etchings and runes along its edge. It is supported by just a single central stem leg. That's also pentagonal. There are lots of other doors; and Riglan realises the door he came through looks sort of hidden, by wallpaper on the door that blends it into the walls. That means he now notices other servant doors hidden similarly.

Above the stairs, are doors on either side of the staircase leading to parts of the second storey. On the edge close to the wall on our side seem to be a set of steps going down; it would be hard to see if one entered from the main palace doors as a well-placed statue seems to intentionally obscure it. That looks good.

He heads back. Signals "yes" to everyone. When we all get into the foyer, they're surprised but Temo puts Riglan on his hand and says "there's a path you want us to take?" front-legs-"yes" "We will follow" so Riglan scuttles along and the others follow to the stairs downwards. Temo Stealth 26. The others are invisible; so we're fine.

We descend the stone steps...

It's dark. Temo with Riglan lead, Nethza in the middle, Maireagh guards the rear. The stairs head straight down to a small landing, then turn left to descend further; but it opens out as they do this, to some kind of underground floor/layer, built into the rock. We appear in a room that's certainly not a basement - the ceiling is high, some 10ft, stone block walls. It looks as if the room is used often, despite it currently being dark and quiet. Two other exists are in the form of gates either side leading to other stone corridors, plus an archway over a corridor; wider than the others; leading away, opposite us. A simple cast iron lamp hangs from the ceiling (unlit), along with unlit sconces near each of the exits.

We head down and into the room, to see under the stairs; there's a very small square door, wooden. Temo tries it, SoH 21. It's a latch, not locked, not stiff or squeaky; inside, a broom closet of sorts; two butcher's aprons and an oilskin (outdoors coat). There are long spear-like implements but with small nooses at the end; it's obvious that these are tools for hunting - but the noose is more person-sized than rabbit sized. Probably for the grisly business of capturing gnolls, or worse, given the aprons. We close the door.

Facing the wider archway corridor at the end, we head right. We can see through the barred gate there; it's only a 10ft corridor, another gate, then a room. It's fairly big - Riglan's 30ft range can't see far into it; Temo's 60ft goggles can almost sense something. Perception nat 20+6. He sees the faintest flickering of shadow... He holds his hand up to alert everyone to stop. Points, then lowers spider Riglan to the floor.

Perception, 16+10->26. To his left, there's another room that goes off this one. There's a dim light - ah, a candle. A table. Someone works on something there; they have their back to the door. There's a creature on the table... Riglan gets into the corridor to approach the room, heads up the wall to the passageway ceiling, and tries to get a better look. He has to risk entering the room to see past this strange figure.

Smells! Chemical. Strange; burning, corrosion of flesh. A figure, humanoid-looking, lies on the table with surgical-looking hooks holding its abdomen and chest cavity apart. Fortunately (!) it seems to be dead. The person leaning over is wearing one of the aprons we saw before, along with goggles; they have a trolley alongside with numerous pieces of medical equipment; beakers full of liquids. Nature, dirty 20. Whatever is on the table isn't human; it has long claws, sharp rows of teeth, slight snout, a lot of unruly hair; clumps of it have been burned away. Werewolf; vampires hate werewolves, so perhaps trying to find ways to kill them? The whole place is a makeshift laboratory/morgue.

Spider Riglan tries to see the person more closely. Wisdom saving, 3+10! Senses peril and withdraws hastily. A mind is scanning the room! The person at the table puts down tools and stands up; looks around. Perception 12, while retreating; glances back; the person is wiping their hands; they take gloves off - he notices shadows moving!

Meanwhile, Temo perception 23. He sees suddenly different patterns to the shadows. He can sense movement. He readies his bow (knowing that the other two will see this), moves against the wall and peers around the corner to watch keenly.

Riglan's scuttling along the ceiling as quickly as he can (20ft). Footsteps behind; Riglan has to descend a bit to get 'under' the top of the gate. He makes it through the corridor, into the main room and sees Temo, but hasn't heard anyone behind opening the gate. He gets down onto Temo's shoulder. Temo is still looking in the corridor; stealth disadv a lucky 20,19 -> 35! He sees someone coming but isn't seen himself as he ducks back against the wall. He waits. 30 seconds. Nothing, no sounds of the gate, no person. Another 30 seconds. Nothing. Perception 28, no footsteps heard either. But that's odd; is someone stood there waiting? He motions a path for Riglan, to look "under" at the top of the gate. Riglan does it. Nothing! Did this person teleport?!

We park that for later! Temo shrugs, mostly for the benfit of the other two. We work our way around the walls, past the stairs and to the other gate. Riglan checks it out. It looks like a rough mirror of the other room, but this one is furnished. Basic, functional. There's a room that's the mirror of the laboratory on the other side; a wooden door, tight fit, Riglan - acrobatics 18+2->20 (spider dex) - he just manages to squeeze under. Two beds. The sound of breathing. Riglan scuttles up the door to get a better look. Two people are asleep, under the covers. The look probably human but it's uncertain in the dark and at distance. No weapons visible; small chests at the end of the bed. OK then.

Back in the adjoining room - looks like a common room. Stuff strewn about; a table that looks used for eating, reading and more. Heavily inhabited - living quarters.

Riglan heads back out. The usual "is it dangerous? Is it boring" kinda quiet questions from Temo and gestures from the spider. Yes - dangerous but yes boring! So we figure we'll check the big archway. Not far through there, is another room, not as wide but significant. Multiple alcoves line the walls, most containing large jars, but one on the right seems to miss such a jar. There is an open doorway on either side leading to more rooms. At the very end is a flight of stairs that look like they go further down. Temo investigates one; whispers for mage hand (spell is V,S), tries to lift the lid. Arcana 15. The lid seems sealed on the jar.

OK, same playbook yet again! More searching. Spider goes into the right-hand door. Two long corridors come off both sides. Investigating one - lots of cells; metal doors with bars, so Riglan investigates the first; investigation only 11; a pen, or prison of some kind. Riglan tries a quick walk along the corridor roof, to see if any of the ~8 cells each side are occupied. Some, maybe, but can't really tell what those things might be; occupants if present aren't standing or otherwise in full view. A quick glance at the opposite corridor looks like cells too; and then there's another row of them, too, which seem the same. There are a *lot* of these things here.

Riglan returns to Temo. Dangerous no, boring yes! Try the other side, quickly, since we've probably only 10-15 minutes of Invisibility left. For a few minutes, Riglan finds around 8 rooms with doors. All look like they're kinda basic. Desks, chairs, storage; a place people might work. All are empty.

We're forced to withdraw and make a hurried way back to the courtyard, but on the way realise we'd be stuck there. The gallery windows look over a sheer cliff; Temo asks if we can fly? There's nobody about; we check the windows; one can open. Invisibility fails; Nethza makes all three fly and Maireagh makes all three invisible. Easy. We fly out, close the window and down to the road near the lower village before it expires.

We can't be magically shielded from scrying as Maireagh's out of spells, so instead of going for an inn there, we stop, in the trees off the road and Temo says he can put up his Tiny Hit. It's around midnight anyway, and we can camp up inside there, hoping it's enough to hide us for now. After that, it's rations and sleep, but keeping 'watch' - listening, at least - within the hut.

We clear some ground as Temo's ritual runs; the hut appears and we set up inside it.

Riglan, perception 15. He's rolled out a bed, but then notices some moon through the trees above us. Nearly full now - wispy clouds - but one is moving! It's travelling, clearly, heading towards us. Riglan calls, "heads up - I think that strange character from the castle might be paying us a visit!"

A very thin layer of fog falls down, pools into the clearing, then comes back together into the form of the character before - tho without goggles and apron. Riglan says for the benefit of the others, "Yep! That's the one!"

The creature looks at the hut. "May I come in?" and Riglan says, "We'll come out" and we exit, but arm ourselves. "Oh please! Put those away!" he says, rather dismissively. Maireagh stands in front of Nethza - "if it's all the same to you I'll hold onto mine!"

A conversation ensues. The character is curious - do we have a death wish?! Over the course of it, insight, nat 20 (yay) + 10->30. He's done it because he's very curious, isn't interested in helping us in any way and seems to know everything we did after we encountered him. But why didn't we take papers, or scry, or whatever? He also seems totally unfazed by stories of the future - that almost everything is dead, probably including him. Seems highly intelligent; research most likely immoral; at least the creature - not a werewolf, something strange, an 'edge case' - was dead on arrival (hunters).

We do find out that something is *creating* these abominations. Riglan mentions the stag with the child found inside - that's why, says this person, he was dissecting this werewolf. No child but "foreign bodies" inside. How? How are they doing that? Stitching these things together? How is a creature that's not a werewolf able to harness and possess some of its abilities? But why did it lose its mind - it was rabid, they always are, they rampage. The council? If so, *VERY* dangerous - if the Kargat found out... Bad news. Riglan posits that the abominations do seem to get worse as you get further out - certainly the creatures with children inside were extreme examples. This seems to trigger a surprise in the creature, who writes it down. Riglan is asked to describe in detail. We do our best - both the stag and the tree.

This appears to placate the individual somehow. "Well, that answers the question of what to do with you. You were quite useful in your own way - so I shall leave you be. If you encounter anything else, I would very much like to know..." - he writes something in his book, rips out the page and hands it to Riglan. Then he pulls out a small bag of coins, but we stop him; we don't need money, we'd gladly let him know stuff. We are told to write to him! We can write, can't we...? ("For fuck's sake!" exclaims Maireagh).

We realise that he's written the name. "**Doctor Mersham** c/o It Kal". Agreed. Appreciate you not throwing us to the wolf that is Azalin Rex.

"It's a nice night. Alright. Have a good sleep!" - and he turns into a bat, flapping away.

Maireagh takes the paper and reads it out, scornfully! Puts it in her bag and stomps back into the hut. We follow. After a debrief consisting mostly of expressions of confusion, we finally sleep (with Maireagh on first watch).



## Day 17 ("day" 14 in Shadowfell, day 13 of 15-day cycle)

Riglan's watch is last. At the start, he hears something strange; he realises it is raining. He uses his shoulder light to look. The hut was built as a strange translucent dome in this case and he can see the rain, but it doesn't come in. It's like being under a window above your head, but it's this great big perfectly rounded dome that nobody could ever *build* and the effect is really quite strange. Later, it lightens to a drizzle, then stops.

By morning, the hut is gone and a strange round dry patch of ground is left. Since we're already out of the city, we figure we'll find the abbey that'll be our hoped-for safehouse. It's a fair distance - from here, we're actually kind of on the wrong side a bit, so 4.5 hours ish to get there, then 4 hours back.

We walk. Riglan, Survival 18. We get onto the road and head to the bridge over the river chasm. We're stopped there by some guards. A small caravan is coming the other way. More traders. We're allowed across after that. It's a surprise that the bridge isn't wide enough for more than one thing at a time.

We reach a crossroads. One sign says "King's Pass"; we need to find a branch off that road somewhere, so follow it for a while. After a while, we see a sign pointing in what looks like the right way; "The Shadewoods" - we take that road. We figure we could cut across hills and meadows instead of using the road and get there a fair bit quicker if wanted, though we might risk trespass on farmland or estate land. Clearly this area is a bit of a food bowl, but also it doesn't seem nearly big enough given the size of the city today. Too much is given up to country estates, for a start, instead of productive farmland.

Woods are visible on foothills. It climbs up the mountains a distance before turning into scrub. As we get closer, we can just about make out a building on a rocky outcrop that sticks out above the woods. That's probably the abbey. Getting closer, there seems to be a road going in the right direction, but it's not signposted. We take the road anyway, leaving estates behind. Scrub, remnant forest; the edge of productive land. The terrain gets more rugged around the road, which itself goes from cobbles to dirt.

We enter the woods. The road is still there, but not well maintained; plants nip at its edges, growing in; that said though, the top layer is a kind of finely-grained sand. So this is frequently used; not quiet and certainly not abandoned. It shrinks into a zig-zag track as it starts to climb the hill. Not cart-friendly! It ends up at the base of the rock outcrop with the abbey atop; someone here has carved a path that works its way up to a plateau at the back of the outcrop.

The entrance of the abbey doesn't face out over the view, it faces inwards, where the track approaches. The *back* of the abbey is visible from the land below. That's where its tower is constructed too. As we approach the door, we see a couple of people outside. There's a low stone wall around, encircling a small vegetable garden. There's no orchard, farm, vineyard etc.; more of a monastery feel. Secluded.

As we approach, the two people tending the garden put down tools, remove gloves and hats, tidy themselves up and walk towards us to greet us. "A lovely sunny day!" they say. Well, the sun *is* up, though this area is shadowed by the mountain. "Yes" we respond, then mention that Jamison told us about the place. This is **Shadewood Abbey**.

"Any friend of Jamison's is a friend of ours! I'm **Sister Harlick**. This is **Bruno**." They're "the caretakers". The abbey is to Ezra. We ask if they've ever heard of people who disappear to a different time after The Hunt. Yes! But we'd better speak to **Father Piguet**. Bruno leads us to him. We enter the abbey. It's heavily fortified, stone construction, surprisingly impressive. The windows on either side have thick stone walls, narrow and tall. The only grand window is a beautiful, leaded stained-glass rose window, high in the tower section.

We're taken to an office where Piguet resides. Bruno introduces us. Piguet is old; bald on top, thin long white hair around, vestments worn as if really just from tradition. He would've been strong once - the frame of a fighter - but he is frail in his older years. Father Piguet gets quiet excited at the thought that we are "Messengers", as he calls people who disappear when everyone else passes out (he thinks they ascend in some way).

More people join us. Late teens at most - Bruno is late 20s. With a shock Riglan realises that he's seen very few children even in Citeaux. None in villages, few in Citeaux. In particular, very few teenagers. Taken for war, in theory, by It Kal? We didn't see any of that in our brief excursion.

The teenagers say they've escaped from the army of It Kal; they're trained; they've escaped though! They've seen the light. **The army is stationed in barracks below It Kal, accessed from the village there**.

What is our message, we are asked? We say - that the future isn't fixed. It can be changed through action. One must not give up; try to make positive changes; they will echo through the ages.

We have a conversation about next steps. We could dive back into the city; more stress and danger; more poking around in the dark. We don't have a coherent idea of anything yet. We can learn from the people here instead, and we can hear of stories of abominations from people further afield perhaps; it's safe here, so we'll wait out the two days until the Hunt.

## Day 18 ("day" 15 in Shadowfell, day 14 of 15-day cycle)

And so it is. We help out, we talk, we listen and learn.

* The mists have been "unreliable". One young man, upon escaping It Kal, tried to trek all the way over King's Pass on foot, down the other side and tried to go home; he got lost in the mist instead, as the mist had cut off the road leading to King's Pass. So it's not just overall contracting year by year, it's got significant variability over short timescales. The only reason, we're told, this man is alive is because he stumbled across two armed, wandering clerics of Ezra; he'd tried to escape close to a full moon, and they were out looking for people at risk in the countryside and had risked venturing into the mists. They got out of the mist, hid in a barn and the next day, came here. Feeling he owes the order his life, he decided to stay.

* Rumours of strange creatures; abominations; unusual shape-shifters, running through the woods. They're joining the hunt and expanding it out in the country on the other side of the mountains; the claim that nights are getting dangerous out that way; packs roam woods on the outskirts of towns, waylay travellers; the hunt isn't just at the end of each month there. Clashes between small groups of Citeaux vampire and these strange, wilder, primal forces occur. Citeaux sends out a crack team of 3-4 hunters (vampires from the Kargat). That must be how Doctor Mersham came upon his grisly find. This kind of thing is attributed by people at the abbey to the general corruption of the land and is taken to indicate a need to turn to Ezra.

## Day 19 ("day" 16 in Shadowfell, day 15 of 15-day cycle)

It's the day of the hunt. The garden is harvested.

In the evening, a generous feast is put on; we contribute what we can. The four of us, six younger ones and the three permanent staff. Drinks are brought out, but then people are put on watch as mists roll out, down the mountains and *up* from the ocean. This is it. "The stories are, that those mists in the ocean swallow everyone that heads out there... Every now and then a shipload full of soldiers - navy - are sent out, but they never return. Whatever battle or war they're sent off to fight, not a single one comes back."

The mist surrounds the abbey. The full moon can be seen through the rose window. Howls are heard. Doors are barred and locked; the window design makes sense as they're too narrow to enter. Running sounds are heard, circling the abbey. People take up positions; up in the tower, *flying* creatures - large bat wings and claws - need fighting. Flames are used to illuminate the misty night and push things back.

We do our part. No Raven Queen spirits this time. Coming back down from the tower at one point, Riglan finds Nethza frightened. Sister Harlick is comforting her. "The voices! I hear whispers and voices" she says. Shadows around her flicker erratically. Riglan needs to help her out. Temo is called down to help while Maireagh and the dog continue with tower defence.

Then people realise it's getting quiet. They're getting tired. Bed rolls are put out near the fire. People tuck themselves into bed. The four us lie close, Nethza in the middle, almost a group hug, the dog at the foot. Maireagh holds her hand. The mists roil under the door in the sort-of-impossible way we saw before...

...and we sleep.

## Day 20 ("day" 17 in Shadowfell, day 1 of 15-day cycle #2)

We wake. The abbey is more worn. Cracks in the walls. "Damn", says Riglan quietly. "I was hoping we might have perhaps gone *back* just a bit further." Footsteps. A few peering faces around the corner of one of the side hallways where rooms are. More people emerge. Temo says, "Don't be afraid; we're messengers."

Lots of whispering and gossiping! An older, 50-ish guy with a walking stick half walks, half hobbles into the dining room. "Ah! Messengers. It's all right everyone..." - he reassures the kids - "...I've heard of these. A long time ago." One looks to Riglan. "Is he a were-cow?!"

"Welcome to the **Abbey Of Keeps**. I am **Father Orin**. You are safe here and you are welcome."

Riglan says, "Thank you Father. We knew a Robert Orin many years ago." "Oh you did? Really? A Robert? No. But that can't be..." "How many years?" "Robert Orin? Robert started the revolution. He is my great-great-great-great-great grandfather!" Riglan goes, "Wow, we have travelled a *long* way. Messengers sleep in one time and wake in another." "Oh! We heard of that but we never encountered them in my time here. And I have been guardian of this abbey for 40 years." Riglan nods. "I suppose there aren't that many messengers, and there are many churches or places they might use to weather the hunt, and many centuries over which they might awaken. We knew this as Shadewood Abbey?" "Ah, right yes. The Shadewood. I think that was the name of this wood once. It's called the Blightwood now." "Ah. Right. Yes, things do get worse. But they can be made to get better. The actions we take at any time can improve the future. It's not fixed."

We learn more about the revolution. Robert worked from within Citeaux until discovered; he had to fight his way out; came to the abbey and settled the family here and built the first keep. Hence, the Abbey of Keeps. "Come, perhaps you should prepare yourself..." - and he leads us to a side door that leads to the garden from his office. "I didn't think to ask, but maybe you have not seen our world at this time."

We are led outside. Much of the woods below does show signs of blight, but surrounding us, amongst remaining trees, is a village; three keeps are spread out across the hill and mountainside, defended; not large, but each with a small collection of huts and houses. A resistance; a revolution. **But what really catches Riglan's eye is that the sky is a dark black and *purple*, rent through with streaks of dark blue as if split apart - tears, in reality itself. The city of Citeaux in the distance is crackling with lighting; the palace of It Kal appears to be frozen in a moment of explosion, with parts of the castle impossibly hanging in the air, connected by crackling bolts of energy, churning portals.**

We stand for a brief moment in silent astonishment. "Wh - What *happened?* And *When?!* exclaims Riglan; his brain struggles to reconcile what he sees with anything that could possibly be real.

"Ah - so - you've never been here before?" "No. We've been earlier, with Robert, and even were inside It Kal briefly. And we've been much later, not sure how far, one or two centuries; just dark there, no sunlight; we never saw any of this strange stuff in the sky - but we were over the other side of the mountains."

"The explosion happened many years ago now. It has been like this for around a decade. At the time, all I saw - *felt* - was a huge shockwave and then we saw It Kal like that - frozen in time, in the midst of an explosion. Citeaux struggled to rebuild. It *has* rebuilt, but has oppressively taxed the regions to do so. By all accounts, the countryside is lost; some areas have not been seen since the explosion and we lose more each year - the mists are closing in." Riglan nods and says, "At the furthest future the mists were very close to the main road out beyond the mountains." "It changed the land. There was a rise in abominations that stalk the forests and hunt the innocent. People dare not travel." Riglan says, "ah, but that was already happening before. Back in Robert's time. Someone we met at It Kal - very evil, I'm sure, but they somehow were aligned with us - they were studying them, trying to find out the cause. We never found out before the Hunt and our change in time."

We're told Azalin hasn't been seen since the explosion. We point out that we were told he hadn't been seen for months before our earlier time period either. Perhaps he's not in control at all? Perhaps he's gone? Apparently many believe that here, now; chaotic magic roams the land. The abominations might be spells that have gone wrong, roaming the land, twisting beings with whom they contact. "People say there are kabals who have stormed the keeps and manners of the feudal lords and wrested them from their control. The kingdom is crumbling. Some say it has already gone. There's lawlessness. We protect who we can. That's why the followers of Ezra now have keeps and armies! We're not violent or militant people but we have no choice".

We talk more. Eventually he asks our names. Oh! We never gave them! How rude. Riglan, Temo - and he gasps. "The great philanthropist and businessman, Temo? Are you a descendant of his?" Temo is confused and asks if this is related to Robert. We're taken back inside and shown somethimg. "This is the *one thing* that Robert Orin left as a legacy, through our line." He pulls out a small tuning fork made of pure adamantium. Temo gasps. "This comes with a bequest, that the descendants of Temo are to be given this and it will lead them to the path home. He had this made and no-one understood this. Do you understand this?"

Temo (arcana 19+4); he figures it's a spell focus. Something to move between places. He says to Riglan, "This is I think like your trees - it's a... A destination." The Father continues, "It says here that this priceless thing is a relic that harks back to the first encounter that led him down a different path. That there was a piece of metal involved. And he was advised in a vision that he should seek out the person he sold it to, reacquire it and fashion this from it."

Temo's say down and looks kind of in shock and there are tears in his eyes. "I'm not descended from Temo. I *am* Temo." "How can that be?" "This is at least 250 years ago". Temo says, "Yes, and remember, we get pushed through time, we don't know how far or which direction until we get there, when everyone sleeps at the Hunt."

Temo tells the tale. And he says to Riglan - "Riglan... I never really fully believed that we could make a difference but *this*. This is huge. This entire way of life, these people, these keeps. *All* of this is because of our meeting and dealings with Robert. It's... It's mind-blowing."

**"If he did make this from the ingot we gave him then it's attuned..." begins Maireagh and Riglan exclaims "Wave echo cave! And our home!"**

Father Orin is crying. "If this is true... If this is meant for you and it sounds like you know what this, and I believe you... Then this closes Robert's legacy. This completes it. So many have tried to hide this artefact from Azalin's forces. Many have died protecting it and moving it from location to location. For whatever reason, he sought this particular artefact. For decades we've had to hide it."

Temo says, "Father Orin, we now owe you a debt and thanks that we can never repay. This object is - connected to our true home. Not here, a world beyond. With this, and the right magic, we can get back. We can leave. But - I'm not going to, until we've figured out what's happening here and helped. Helped *meaningfully*. This - order of yours, the keeps, that's just the start. There must be more we can do. This land should be able to be returned, where it came from before it was pulled to this dark place. I don't know if I can do that but I'm going to try. I feel I owe it to a *lot* of people now."

At that moment, the ground trembles. Oh. That can't be good! "This happens, don't worry" says Father Orin. A crash, off in the distance. "What is it?" "Give me a moment". Father Orin heads out. He shouts up to the tower. "Status report!" - Someone comes down. "It's a few miles away; no immediate damage that we can see this time. I will send scouts out to have a look." Orin asks, "Who can we spare?" "Us!" says Temo. "Well if you will go with our scout to protect him..." "Of course!" A direction is asked for. "Further along the mountain. It looks like a triangular piece fell." "Ah. I see. Did it shear part of the mountain?" "I don't know, Father. I only saw where it fell. I don't know damage it caused".

We ask if that's the sky or It Kal. The answer is - the sky! Pieces are falling apart. Sometimes it's the sky, sometimes the ground. Sometimes, the ground crumbles.

Riglan says, "We will depart as soon as your rider is ready. But we're on foot." There's a stables, but apparently it's through the forest and horses are unlikely to survive. We're asked if we're headed to the crash site; we'll need something called breathing masks?! The young kid asking gets us strange masks. "It's just in case. Sometimes the air can be quite foul."

Before we leave, Temo calls to Father Orin. "I didn't really fully believe Riglan. But he's right. What we do now changes the future. The harder we fight today, the better the tomorrow. **Ezra is right**." Father Orin smiles and puts his hand on Temo's shoulder. "If you are indeed the one who met my ancestor - and I believe you are! - then there is nothing that I can say which you do not already know, but I wish you a safe ride and we will see you later this afternoon, safely returned."

We walk out to the stables to meet the scout. He confirms that the fragment fell on the wrong side of the forest and we can't actually ride - walk only. Too dangerous.

Past the perimeter of the keep, the name Blightwood makes a lot more sense. Far more trees are afflicted. Not dead but sickly. Riglan asks for a minute of time. He tries to talk to one. "What ails you, friend?" The weakest response, barely perceptible. They're very, very sick. Both ground and air is toxic. The magic they used to use to protect themselves is failing and the sun hasn't risen in many years. After it set, the day of explosion, it never rose again. All Riglan can really say is, "Rest easy friend. Fight as best you can. We never know when things will get better; it might not, but all we can do is hope."

The ground is covered by tangled, thorny vines. They seem to be sustained by... Something. They're alien - the "feel" different. Not part of the forest. Nature 13; he accidentally pricks his finger on a thorn. To Riglan's surprise, the thorn *drinks* the blood. The vine almost moves as he withdraws as if to follow. Riglan says, "It's all like that tree with the kids; these vines; they're living off blood, or something. Whatever is under our feet, in the land below, must be - vampiric, or otherwise evil, and *extensive*.

Riglan stops wasting time. We follow the guide, who knows a path to avoid the worst of the vines. They seem to sense our presence, as we pass near any of them. They almost move slowly, creeping, towards us. Riglan points this out, and says, "Possibly, a hive mind. Might just be a plant mind, but they might be a tool for surveillance; we should assume we're being watched." The scout says "I find these useful!" and pulls out a vial. "This has been blessed. Don't tell Father Orin! I got this from an old childhood friend of mine who rides with Avacyn" - he pulls out a long dagger, speaks a word and the dagger lights with glowing redness as if hot. "They don't stand a chance against these!"

The scout needs to find his bearings. He climbs a sickly tree but steps on a bad branch, which breaks and falls as he scrambles up. Riglan examines the rotten branch - it's just rotten wood; at least *that* is normal. The scout looks around, clambers back down; says we went the wrong way a bit! But not much. We get back to the intended path. After about an hour of travel, we reach the location of interest.

Riglan perception 12 - he doesn't notice until the scout halts us. Nethza looks around - "Yes, I sense that too!" - "Just to be on the safe side, let's put our masks on" says the scout. We do; it makes it harder to see and breathe. We move forward and soon we're sure that we're in a cloud of *something*. A slight yellowish hue, that rubbing the mask's lenses/goggles doesn't clear. The scout says, "I think we're early enough that it's not attracted anyone else, but keep your wits about you."

We approach cautiously, keeping low, following the scout's lead. Maireagh struggles a bit due to her armour. Riglan perception 6+10->16. Over a rocky ledge, he peers down to a quite big impact crater, maybe 40ft wide. Embedded are shards of black - well, almost glass, but almost a foot thick. It's mostly one huge jagged piece but a few others, some shattered, are inserted around. In fact, the ledge we're on is, we realise, a displaced rock thrown out of place - and we have to be careful, it's not too steady. Some of the shards appear to be melting, or vaporising; they're causing fumes. The base of the crater, some 20ft below, seems to have some movement.

The guide thinks we should retreat; Riglan calls an owl. The owl glides in. Con save; 14. It feels sickly. It feels like the air around is toxic - which it is. If it stays too long it'll be poisoned so Riglan just asks for a fly-by. It notices creatures, with long limbs, walking on all fours but looking *almost* humanoid. Large chests, broad shoudlers, arms that seem jointed the wrong way, small hind legs. Bony tails. Thin; gaunt. There are remnants of tufts of hair on their back. The faces are like malnourished dogs; there's a hint of gnoll here. They sniff around and snap at each other if one gets too close to another. We don't know what they're looking for; then one looks up at the owl. Its eyes are hollow with a hint of light in the middle of the eye socket. It's spotted the owl! It howls. The others look up and howl too. There are five of them. We then hear a call from much further in the woods in reply. The gnoll-like things climb the shard to try and get closer to the owl.

Riglan asks the owl to fly away from us, and keep going in that direction as low as it dares. The gnoll-like creatures howl and chase it; at least for a moment, the crater is unoccupied. "Now's our chance" says Riglan; he says to the scout, "Stay low. Don't watch us. Watch your back, watch the forest and *shout*  if you see anything!"

We all scurry down. As we're going, Riglan is saying, "They were looking for something - let's see if we can spot anything different. Something that stands out, not glass." Riglan, perception 19; Temo, with Maireagh and the dog helping; investigation 15+14->29. The dog heads straight for where the gnoll-like things were and Temo follows. There are some different-looking shards, as if when the black glass broke, a series of *runes* were revealed! A network of runes, within the glass itself, embedded. The runes are glowing a bit. It looks like the creatures were *feeding* on this somehow; the glass is shattered, shards with runes broken up with saliva on. There's a strong sense of magic here. There seems veins within the large glass. Many small pieces don't have any, but some do.

Temo tries to grab one in a piece of cloth, but it seems corrosive; it fumes, like a solid acid; instead, we try to write a few in a notebook for future reference. Temo suggests - mage hand. Repeatedly, carry it that way; bag of holding is too high risk if it's corrosive. The bit of cloth we used is already burning away! We find the largest rune-chunk that we can, Temo "picks it up".

Meanwhile, Riglan, with perception 19; he's looking around, with Nethza. He realises he's been talking to her a while but she's not saying anything. He looks; she's standing in the middle of quite a few shards. Her eyes are glazed over, a shiny look to them; she gets that sometimes when in the thick of battle. She starts to float off the ground. Riglan grabs her, shouts, "Neth?" - no response and she rises further; athl 12+8->20; he's hovering too now! Shards nearby are also starting to rise and Nethza's hands start to lift; the shards lift too, some joining back together as if a jigsaw puzzle. There's a burst of shadow, tendrils, appearing around her; he's seen this before sometimes; at least he's stopping her lifting any further, but the reassembled shard now keeps going, quicker and quicker now, up into the sky. It ends up nearly fitting into a hole in the sky above...

...Temo - arcana 12; he has to recast mage-hand a few times because his shard is suddenly rising! He manages to catch it...

...Dex save, 5. We fall to the ground. Riglan's only a foot off the ground but he fumbles catching Nethza. She's out. She seems exhausted; he tries Greater Restoration. But now Temo and Maireagh have seen and are running over. Nethza wakes up. "What happened?" "We need to go *now* - we'll talk later - this is very dangerous indeed!" - we run back up the crater. The scout is there, mouth agape; Riglan says, "hey, I said *don't* look at us!" Maireagh grabs him. "Snap out of it! How do we get back? Hurry!" - and we start to run, with much less care than before. Acrobatics or athl all round:

* Temo 17+11 -> 28
* Maireagh 14
* Riglan 20+8 -> 28
* Nethza 11

Temo is helping Maireagh, struggling with her armour still; Riglan is helping the confused and tired Nethza, helping her up as she stumbles along. As we run, Riglan fills in Nethza on what happened. She remembers none of it. As we run, Riglan - perception 10+18->28 - he's watching Temo trying to run, help Maireagh and re-cast his hand spell; but the shard has almost entirely evaporated. The mage hand seems to be loosely holding a barely-contained glowing run. Riglan calls out to Temo, "*Do not* let that mage hand fail - look! Look at it!" - Temo, Arcana 14+4->18. The trouble is, the rune isn't tangible. As the last of the shard evaporates, the run falls through his mage hand and hits the ground. He stops abruptly; on the same perception roll, Riglan sees it hit the forest floor. Riglan stops too, his grip on Nethza's arm causing her to almost fly around as if on a rope! The rune falls between Temo and the scout. There's a pulse - not a shockwave - a soft pulse. **The trees on either side of it liven!** For the briefest moment, there's the sound of trees waking up in Riglan's ears. Just a few - maybe four - just for a moment, look healthier. Actual green leaves push through and burst out of buds; but then, it stops.

Riglan pauses in astonishment for about half a second, then says, "We *must* get to the abbey. Don't lose the scout!"

Nethza is saying, "wait, did that..." and Riglan says, "The rune *fixed* the land somehow. Repaired it. So, the runes are some kind of barrier, protection from evil perhaps; maybe a way to stop one evil spreading from domain to domain? Who knows. A source of magic either way. The fact you repaired part of it should not be considered bad at this time. I suspect the crack in the sky is Azalin's escape route - or was meant to be, if he's still here."

We get back to the abbey much faster, albeit (not quite technically) exhausted! We're tired. Short rest to avoid technical exhaustion. People have run out to meet us, everyone full of questions. Why were we running?! On the way past the keep the over-excited scout calls, "We may be followed! To arms!" - uuuh, a bit much, but can't hurt; and Riglan remembers his poor owl and dismiss it back to the Fey.

Once we've got our breath back, we explain what happened, for the benefit of all, including the scout. The scout gives his version of what he saw. He felt a tremor in the ground and scrambled over the edge to look; he saw Nethza with a corona of both light and shadow around her, the tendrils of shadow were lifting the pieces of sky up into the heavens, where they were being fitted together. He says he could *hear* a strange ringing sound the whole time, as if the air around was vibrating at a high frequency; then the shard flew up into the sky and the sound stopped. As it stopped, he saw Nethza fall. Pretty much what Riglan saw!

We give our theory that maybe these black shards and black shadows *aren't* evil. These domains were to *trap* evil. Perhaps the magic in the sky is good, in some way; we saw the shard rune *heal* this land, briefly.

**Sister Joni** - of whom we saw little previously, as she was always busy looking after the many young/teenage people in the abbey - reveals that she was a sage. She worked in the archives in the Inner City. "There are likely arcane tomes that might have some answers. If there's anywhere that such knowledge exists, that would be my guess..." - one of the older young group says, "Yes, or, the Vistani might know."

"The Vistani! Nobody has seen them for years. Even if you wanted to find them I wouldn't know where to start."

Riglan is reminded and exclaims, "Ah, by the hells. We never gave back the book. Volume 6, Raven Queen. The raven said we'd meet them again, but we didn't... Perhaps we have to meet them after another hunt..."

This surprises people who ask what he means. Riglan tells the story of the four were-ravens. A young girl says, "Oh! My father once told me about were-ravens. They... He says there's a 'kindness'..." (a group of were-ravens) "...in the library, which is where they congregate. They like to inhabit forgotten places of knowledge. My father says they collect; they find and hide objects of power that could be used to further evil." Orin figures that there might be a record. "There may be a way to figure this out..." - he goes to his office and comes back with 3 journals.

"In here are the journals - the diaries - that describe, amongst other things, how we kept Robert's bequest hidden through the decades. If you have the time, maybe you'd like to read through these and see if you can figure out if, at any point, whether they were in the custody of Kindness. It might help you find them."

We all look but...

* Temo: Investigation 12+14 -> 26.

...can't be beaten. He realises that a sentence which didn't make sense now does; he didn't know raven groups were called "a Kindness". The sentence he finds reads, "The Kindness at..." with an estate name: "at the old abandoned **Marbery Estate**". Orin knows that they were one of the old great families. They think an old estate would be out in the country, rather than the Inner City (along with a manor or villa in the city itself).

Order of the Scrollkeepers might know. Mid-city, if it still exists. Citeaux still stands, after all, and we might need to try and find the Grand Archive.

By now it's dinner time. **We will walk to Citeaux tomorrow, then.**

We're offered lodgings, which we accept gratefully. We sleep in a room in the abbey, but the night is punctuated with howls. The keeps are lit constantly with torches, the abbey essentially in the rough centre of the triangle they form. A constant watch is kept.

(END OF PART 3.5 - Part 3.6 next)
