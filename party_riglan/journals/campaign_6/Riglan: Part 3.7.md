# Riglan: Part 3.7
## Day 23 ("day" 20 in Shadowfell, day 4 of 15-day cycle #2)

We awake in Marberry House. The Kindness have packed together some notes, some rough directions, bits of a map, some lines drawn on; they're trying to help us find the Vistani - but we *must* cross the mountain if we're going to go there and the map tries to give us routes that people who made it managed that. Either ways over fully, or ways to climb it to reach King's Pass (the road is no longer there). There are places written that they last heard still existed on the other side.

They offer to send messages to the Raven Queen through the ravens. It's one-way but we could send something. Riglan writes a note; "Looking for ways to find Azalin Rex, defeat him and return him here instead of Nethza. All suggestions welcome!" and Temo tries to make it look friendly with a little smiley face - but they just read it to the raven, rather than sending it physically.

Temo suddenly realises he'd assumed something and never asked, given all the talk about never leaving the plane & magical knowledge being limited - so he asks, "So actually, do *you* have anything that would help us us leave? And maybe, fight Azalin?"

They have one thing they thought he would need - but he left the plane a different way anyway, in the end. He released a mana surge which cracked the runes binding him to the plane, and then they expected him to use a particular spell - "Plane Shift" - which is why he needed the metal fork Orin had made. Orin made it for us as an escape route, not knowing we didn't have that magic; but it's what Azalin needed. They think he still managed to cast Plane Shift, and just didn't need what they have - a scroll! **They give us a Plane Shift scroll**.

(There's a discussion about who should cast it. Netzha could cast it outright but says she shouldn't as it misses the point if she's staying; Temo would have to try his luck, but is (literally) lucky; Maireagh is the stronger caster and Riglan could enhance her abilities to make her as lucky as Temo perhaps... And Temo then just exclaims, "Look I *hate* this. We'll talk about it later. The whole discussion is based on Nethza not casting the spell. I hate this. I don't want to talk about it anymore" and he walks off. Maireagh calls after him but Nethza says, "Just give him time. It's not easy." - Maireagh sends the dog after him instead for protection.

Riglan asks for some time for one more ritual. He's decided it's the only little ways he can do any good here. He can't even heal the land like Nethza; he's feeling useless and redundant. So he goes to the little chapel while Nethza and Maireagh keep a distant on Temo and casts the spell to save time. He simply holds up the picture of the merchant, wife and children and says, "I need to let these children and the woman know that the man has died - where can I find them?", secretly hoping it's the way we're headed...

Smoke forms snapshots of a small town. Almost abandoned-looking. It's on a road by a bridge. There's a windmill - it is familiar; that's where the oak tree was, and Aiden, the miller's son, many years ago now.

He leaves and explains to Nethza and Mairegh.

We thank the Kindness and head off. We need to choose a route, but Riglan says we could air travel for speed and safety - we could just go over the mountains! First, though, he wants to see up King's Road and how far it goes. Tummil; it's the little things; all he has left. Can we find that house, or is it gone?

For now, then, we go on foot. We head back to the bridge and towers; takes about 90 minutes. Lots of people here - 12 or so - gathered around the guard tower and on the bridge. Guards. We head over, acting as if curious; "Halt! Security inspection. There has been an attack here. Perception 21; investigators in the tower, a palette on a cart, white sheet over, dead body discovered we presume. We say we're heading away from Citeaux, towards the hills. "I hope you've left means for your loved ones. But I can understand the fear. We'll let you cross over but we're keeping an eye on you! If you turn right, there'll be consequences".

We walk over, watched closely. We turn *left* and head away.

"I wonder if anyone that mattered saw my notes..." wonders Temo, out loud. We figure that a change of guard probably found the bodies, so there's a good chance. Riglan brings him up to date on the divination result and describes the town he thinks we might try to find.

We get back to the overgrown, unmaintained area. The overgrowth is dead, as we noted when we came from the abbey. It doesn't seem particularly worse in the few days since we came through this way. Ahead, a house a little distance off the road, matches Tummil's description; a few minutes off road, so Riglan says, "Tread lightly, in fear of worms!" and we head towards it.

We are on a once-cobblestoned path. It looks like people have dug some of them out! It would be impossible to get a cart along here now. As we get close, we see all the ground floor windows are smashed; open to the elements. Not too good. The gate has rusted shut so we jump the fence.

A nearby window with all glass fully smashed out looks like a point-of-entry. Ragged remnants of drapes blow in the window. We head in. Perception 19. Smells indicate that this was used by squatters, but it's faded; it has been vacant for a while. There's a wafting smell of rot - decay - from a nearby doorway. Riglan takes a look. A partially decomposed body, that looks ripped apart, is here. No head. Riglan waves his staff at the party, to indicate weapon, and puts his finger to his lips to indicate quiet. Everyone draws their respective weapons. He beckons Temo over; 29 investigation; Temo whispers, "pour soul; judging by the clothing and state of decomposition, they've been dead for weeks. The clothing looks very poor - no belongings - not an original resident." We also note a lack of furnishing, cabinets smashed open, shelves raided. It's been looted - stripped clean.

As we cautiously search rooms, Temo finds another body. Same fate.

Fairly quickly, we find a main hallway. Grand stairs are here, intact but perhaps not too solid as they've been exposed to the elements for what looks like a long time - debris, animal droppings, leaf litter and more. Above that, a *huge*, beautiful tapestry portrait is present - but it is in poor condition. It's on the first half-floor landing of the stairs. It's about 12ft high by 8ft wide! We *might* be able to get it into the bag of holding if folded or rolled, but it's in a frame; sections have been hacked off as it looks like people tried to free it and that's how we can tell it is a cloth tapestry rather than a painting.

It's quite a severe-looking woman, of middle age. She's stood next to a harpsichord or something that looks like it. "She liked music" says Riglan. "Tummil said. OK, so we have a few options; cleaning stone, perhaps, so it looks less ratty - and Maireagh, could you get one of those photo things of that? Or, we cut it out and roll it?" She answers, "We could cut it. I could mend parts of it, but I can't restore it." "I don't think he expects it to be in great condition, but it might be quite meaningful for him to see it at all." Nethza points out that this would mean telling him the state of the house and he perhaps doesn't realise this has happened. He's not left Citeaux in a very long time!

That's true, but at least we can rescue *this*. We set to work trying to carefully cut it down. Temo checks to see if the stairs are solid at that level - investigation 30; yep, no worries. With Temo on Riglan's shoulders, he can reach the top - but before we get to do our circus act, Maireagh orders us back, tutting. "I can't trust you to do anything. Stand well clear! I don't want to drop anything on you." So, we get clear.

She gets out various pieces of equipment and manages to levitate the whole tapestry off the wall; she moves it to try and find a place to bring it down. We catch it on the corners to stabilise it and it's lowered down. Nice! Next, it's easy to gently cut around the frame - Temo, SOH 21 - it is cleanly removed. Riglan sets to work with the cleaning stone while Maireagh works on mending what she can. The bottom right-hand corner is too damaged but the rest is OK. We first try to roll it on the 12ft axis; it ends up being a thick 8ft roll, which we gently tie with some rope. We try to hold open the bag of holding as wide as the neck allows and slot it in - it's a tight fit, but it *does* go in. It'll be tricky getting it out but should be doable! Does mean we have to return to Tummil before the "cycle" is out.

Onward. As we leave, in the distance, Riglan notices a pack of feral, wolf-like creatures snarling but wary to approach our group. The droppings are probably theirs. Riglan suggests "OK, how about the fast route now? When in Rome, do as the vampires do?" but Maireagh wants us to get a bit further away first, so we return to the main road.

### 11am

Riglan gets to try it - he says, "Never done this before, see how we go - Temo's memorised the map and thinks he can find the road on the other side, so, watch which cloud he turns into and follow it!"

He casts Wind Walk. It's quite a high level spell and Riglan does a kind of whole druidic green and brown glowing thing that surrounds him as he draws on the weave - he comments just as the spell is concluding, "Well the land might have no energy here, but the weave still does..." - and turns into a cloud.

Fortunately, it seems the clouds have a slight colour tint. Temo is a bit red and cyan, Riglan is greenish, Nethza is a lilac colour and Maireagh is just grey!

We travel very quickly (300ft) heading along the road with Temo leading towards where he remembers Kings Pass originally exiting the mountains. The countryside around us gets more and more abandoned. As we approach the mountain we see the problem clearly - the concussive force from the explosion at It Kal appears to have reached this far and caused a rock fall that crushed the zig-zag road descending from the exit of Kings Pass. Well, it's possible that a falling sky shard did this too - either way - we know from the Kindness's map that people have had to make their own way over the mountain either to the Pass or even over the ridge ever since. We can see a trail that pack animals might have been using, presumably because carts can't do that anymore. That cuts off the Citeaux basin even more.

Temo can see the exit of Kings Pass tunnel. Temo does *not* trust that the tunnel is free of bad things and is fairly confident he can pick it up on the other side, so we try for up-and-over.

Above the dead treeline, we realise we've never been up and over the mountains before. The peaks are quite majestic, even in this strange, dead vegetation world of endless night. Creatures roost in caves up here! Scaly-skinned, scaly-winged, griffon-like things, but without feathers. Deformed griffons perhaps. Not wyverns, for sure. Riglan can't identify them. Translucent eyes reflect moonlight - they must be able to see in the dark well. They don't seem to notice us drifting by!

As we crest the ridge, we see for the first time the other side.

The moon is low on the horizon. It looks nearly full - the Kindness did say it was always full here! Then Riglan realises that it always looked kinda like that whenever it showed up from Citeaux. It's just messed up.

The walls of mist here are giant. They seem to have "broken their banks" in places - long fingers of mist trail out, leaving isolated pockets, with a bit of river, or a glimpse of hills, or some old dead woodland, or old plain, or a bit of road... Almost everything else has been engulfed in the fog. That includes the entire stone town of Kings Pass on this side. Riglan figures that must be making it a lot harder for Temo to navigate - but also, if we'd gone through the tunnel we'd have emerged into it!

Riglan hopes that Temo is keeping an eye out either for the village he described, or for Vistani - or signs of them; it seems unlikely we have any chance of being able to traverse much ground reliably on foot. Temo, in fact, is focused on the problems with Nethza and wants to find the Vistani.

Temo, perception with luck point of 20, spots a thin column of smoke beyond the river and bridge. Riglan, meanwhile, perception 21, sees the windmill and realises that's the location. Riglan slows, but sees Temo carry on, with the other two - he tries to remember where he saw the windmill but can't say anything and doesn't want to be left behind so follows on. It's distressing; the windmill was in a soft of clear island surrounded by mist, so there's no way to walk to it.

Temo leads the way to the smoke. But it's much further than he thought - another hour! The smoke comes from a rise, that comes out above the fog line. A hill. There seems to be an old fort atop the hill. Smoke doesn't come from the fort, but from an encampment at the base of the hill, in an area still clear of mist. A number of bonfires or campfires release smoke, which is why it was enough to see at such distance in combination. Temo heads that way, descending - we all follow.

The fort is ruined. Looks like a huge battle was fought here. The walls are collapsed in, in a manner suggesting weapons damage - maybe huge boulders or something. A ring of caravans is situated across from a road leading up to the fort, sheltering below a small cliff. We drop right down. The semicircle of caravans "faces" the cliff wall, and Temo first thinks he might drop into the middle of it but then (d20->20, call it a wisdom check!) decides in fact to find a spot a distance away where we can "materialise" without causing alarm. He settles down on the ground and wills himself into his normal form; so, we do the same.

As we coalesce - it seems to take a minute! - we see people slowly advancing, weapons drawn. An older looking man grasps a bead necklace, chanting; others have raised collars; they surround us, weapons drawn. As soon as he can speak, Temo says, "We're not vampires! It's druid magic. Please, try holy water, crosses, sunlight, whatever you need!" Persuasion 25. "Hmm. He's very small to be a vampire..." and Temo says, "But also, look at my teeth!"

Suddenly one says, "Wait. Wait..." and then calls "**Clara! Clara!**"

A woman dressed almost in pirate clothing with very curly long hair arrives. "They are Travellers. Put down your weapons boys!" and Riglan steps forward, "Yes, you recognise us; you are surely the Vistani?" "We are... Yes. Well... Have you just arrived in our time?" "A few days stuck in Citeaux." "You'd better come into the camp! A lot has changed." "Thank you."

The camp is small. Only five caravans. "Where are the rest of you?" asks Maireagh. "We are all that are left behind. We've been left here to await the Travellers."

We show them some of the artefacts from our previous encounter. "We are the 'meddling' Travellers!" says Temo. They're surprised at the self-designation, but we explain why. Apparently, **we are the travellers unravelling the tapestry of this realm! But we can also put it back together**.

Clara warns everyone to be on their guard. Riglan nods, "Yes, trouble does seem to follow us..." "Yes. There's a faction that controls the Kargat that seems dead-set on preventing the loss of their power. You are the biggest threat to their power." Riglan answers, "But it's ridiculous; this land is lost. It's dead." "Yes! We know. We understand that they hope to kill the rest of you, and seize *her* for themselves."

Temo says without thinking first, "Over my dead body!"

"That *is* the idea."

She walks over to Nethza and reaches out her hands. "Sister. How are you holding up? What do you know? Of what have you been made aware? Surely, you *feel* what's happening?" - Maireagh is very protective, "Hands off her!" but Nethza says it's OK.

Clara fetches someone for us - **Cinta** - he is the Reader of the Cards. He will be quite worried now that you're here! But know that he means well. He's grumpy and old...

We're left alone for a moment. Nethza is looking around the caravan. Maireagh is watching her closely. Temo stares at his feet; Riglan... Doesn't know what to say.

Eventually an older man, maybe in his 60s, arrives. Silver hair is tied back in a ponytail; he has a goatee; he clutches a deck of cards wrapped in silk. "You must be she who was promised. What is your name, child?"

Clara says, "Cinta! She is *far* older than us!" Nethza contradicts her - "I'm in my 30s! My name is Nethza. These are my friends - my family - Maireagh, Riglan, Temo and that is..." but Cinta interrupts - "Yes, a metal dog. Great." (He sounds sarcasm).

He is generally grumpy for a while before pulling out a folding table, asking us to sit in the caravan elsewhere and asking Nethza to sit across from him.

"To think. All this fuss, for all these years, that I would be the one who gets to meet you. Life is funny. First, let's do a reading."

The card flipping starts. But he seems frustrated; "You haven't decided anything, have you?!" and Riglan explains that they don't know what to decide because they have questions to help us understand the *consequences* of the decisions.

We start asking. We learn a few things.

* One theory is that It Kal will rebuild itself around Nethza if she approaches; that's why she ought to be able to actually sit on the throne. The palace if observed closely seems to be constantly trying to rebuild itself - but it has nothing to rebuild around.
* The palace is designed to imprison.
* The Vistani can walk the mists, they know the paths, but they can't "leave the web"; they can't go where we come from, for example.
* The Raven Queen is everywhere - a realm which sits in the interstitial, between these prison kingdoms - the Vistani can move around between those kingdoms, granted as a boon because they respect and work with her messengers.
* They *traverse* the interstitial along known roads only.
* Cinta believes that Azalin Rex only "cared" about bringing Nethza to this domain because, if it completely collapsed, the Dark Powers would notice - the loss of life would draw their eyes. Nobody has ever seen them, but they *were* mighty enough to trap him in the first place.
* We ask what might happen if travelled using the fork. He can't tell us if we'd arrive before or after Azalin Rex in time, or even close to him on our plane. We'd need to find a sage who'd studied such magic. He doesn't know anyone who might be able to answer the issue of time. **Perhaps an old magic academy in one of the domains might help**. It's "merely a few weeks of travel" to get to one.

And then we get to the reason why that's asked. We want another way. Nethza does not deserve imprisonment. Is there another way? Even the slimmest chance? That, the cards can answer.

* The mirror, with the two faces looking at each other. It says that Riglan knows there's another way but refuses to accept it; looks for a third way.
* Riglan's super confused. The guy just gets hostile and seems to not make any sense; he insists that we're looking for *certainty* in finding Azalin Rex and using that as an excuse to not try. Temo tries to insist that no, we just want *any indication whatsoever* that using the Plane Shift spell would actually work, not 100%, just even 1% would be a start, but the guy isn't interested, says that we "clearly want to have a metaphysical conversation with a sage" and heads away.

Clara says, "I'm sorry, we've waited a long time, and that is all we can do for you. We have tried our best. You're welcome to stay the night."

"Is it safe for us to stay, for you and for us?"

"Well, there are many of us and our bloodlines are committed to protect you with our lives, as Children Of The Raven, that is our fate."

### 2pm

We head outside to debate.

It is difficult. Riglan and Temo share confusion at the rather black-and-white response; that they seek absolute proof, rather than just an iota of certainty above a punt. It comes down in Riglan's mind to a choice between potentially dooming people here, or dooming Nethza (and a failed fight against Azalin Rex would doom them all either way). He feels helpless - perhaps hopeless? - at least in part because of Avacyn. Temo is somewhat distraught. Maireagh points out that Nethza has made her choice to stay, but if we're going to leave and want to convince her to come, we should consider - what difference would it make if we arrived before or after Azalin? We'd have to find out how to tackle him either way. Riglan is torn and feels adrift. He understands that, ultimately, we were asking Cinta impossible questions - he said he can't answer the issues of Plane Shift and time, so what assurance could he have given either way? His best suggestion was to speak to a sage, after weeks of travel...

...Clara has overheard. "Hope is not certainty. Hope is not having something, or being convinced of its realism. Hope is the people that think Avacyn will make this world whole again - against everything they see. Murders, destruction. Do you think they will only have hope if they see certainty? What you describe is more than hope for others, and yet with you I see... Nothing. We were told the Travellers we have waited for were the ones who would rise, but I guess stories get taller in the telling over the years!"

Riglan chuckles. "Now then Clara, don't try to *guilt* me into things. I understand what you say. I feel the weight of the consequence of the decision. To potentially prove Avacyn wrong, not right; to pull Nethza away, to have Avacyn fall to despair and then, this land to final ruin. And we ourselves, probably, slain in the act of trying to defeat Rex. But I want to defeat Rex. I just wish I had the faintest idea *how*. Because once we cast that spell, that's the first thing we're going to ask. What now? How do we do this? And I wouldn't know where to start."

"Is your world poorer than this? Are these answers you think you can find here because you're unable to find them on your world?"

"It is a good point. Rex has ruled here for centuries. And the Dark Powers are better known here surely than anywhere... But our world is rich. As I think yours was before Azalin started to plunder it; and maybe there are people we can ask. Advice to seek, power to gain... People who can help. And perhaps that is my hope, right there. The hope that we might not be able to do it ourselves but we can find a way through the aid of others."

He turns to Nethza and says, "And *that* is something we've been quite good at. We have a lot of friends now, some connections, magical means to travel far and wide, wealth... So that might be enough for me to think we could do it. Together, the four of us, but with help. You don't belong here in a prison. That's not fair and it's not just and it's certainly not destiny - it is the twisted will of an evil creature. I think Clara is right; and Avacyn might not like it, but the way to save this world is not to put you on a throne, lose you, leave Rex free and call it a day. Would you travel with us, back home, and try? Try to defeat Rex?"

**"I *will* give it a try" she says.**

Temo is sobbing quietly - now, it seems, with relief. Riglan just hugs Nethza.

She adds, "I can't imagine saving this world and leaving ours and everyone that I know to perish."

"Yes, I'm not quite sure what his plans there are, but I suppose, not good. That's funnily not the reason tho - it's, well, it's for me, as much about saving this place now. I care about it" responds Riglan.

Clara looks to Riglan. "Somewhere along the way, you lost the belief in hope. You have so much more to have hope for than *anyone* here and yet you don't show it."

Riglan clears his throat and says, "Well, I think I know when. It was the divination, with Avacyn. She's about hope. She's about possibility. And yet, she just wanted Nethza to ascend. And that was so blunt, and so understandable, but so mechanical and cold..."

Clara laughs. "Now just a little thing to clarify! You've met Avacyn, I believe that. But she's the angel of vengeance created by the united beliefs of people here who are praying for hope. Avacyn is not hope; Avacyn is the fire of revenge. Ezra is hope. Avacyn is their angel of mercy."

(Riglan realises now what is going on here - these Vistani have been waiting *for our group*, that's *all*, it's been their sole purpose for over two centuries; we've been built into their own version of hope, yet here Riglan is, racked with doubt, us all indecisive, no clear path and apparently wanting *them* to answer all our questions in order to proceed; that must make them feel awful, like they've failed us somehow, yet we also fail them; it was unfair to ask, and he knows that now).

Riglan asks Clara if she can convince Cinta to speak to him one more time. She points him at Cinta's caravan.

(Temo's stopped crying and is holding Nethza's hand.)

Riglan knocks on the caravan door. The door's open so he pokes his head in. Cinta is sat, head in his hands saying something, as if speaking to someone. "I tried. I tried! You have to believe me. We stayed for nothing!" and Riglan clears his throat. "How long have you been standing there?" "Long enough to know that you didn't try and fail. You got through to me in the end... Just took a while..."

We discuss more.

* When Azalin broke the sky, the moon hovered at 2-days-to-full the entire time.
* Hunts no longer happen - not the ones we know. So we probably can't "travel in time" anymore, until the sky is fixed, but then we'd be trapped here.
* The runes are one-way! If the sky was fixed, we'd never be able to cast Plane Shift. You can enter this domain - as indeed, we did, through the rift created by we think now Azalin - but we can't depart. 
* He doesn't know about time in our world, but does believe at least - now that we talk about it - there's no relationship between time in this domain and time in other planes. So we've no idea "when" we might arrive back in our world, but it won't have a specific correlation to time here.
* Is there any way, in this domain or ours, to contact the Dark Powers? No. They're not an entity; they've never been met or spoken to. It's merely a concept and might not even exist. It's a "force" behind the creation of these domains. But what of the Raven Queen? Yes. He pulls out a talisman. "We are the Children Of The Raven and as such we answer her call. In return, she heeds ours".

He hands Riglan the talisman. "I can keep this?" asks Riglan - "Do you not need it?" "I will get another!" "Thank you. She may well be able to point us in the right direction from our world, either to Azalin or to things that might help us fight him."

"Don't underestimate your friend Nethza. She has a connection to the Raven Queen that is far more powerful than anything we have."

"I just don't want to push her - she doesn't have too much control and we're worried about her health and her sanity!"

"I understand, but you can only shield her for so long. There will come a time when she has to step up and stand in front of you, for that is what family does. I believe every culture has a rite of passage - for example, every powerful young Seer of the Vistani faces that day at some point in their lives." 

Riglan finally asks about the merchant, with the wife and child. It's early afternoon - would the Vistani take us there, rather than us waiting here? He cannot - the mists, now, are too dangerous for any but the Vistani. Things are too broken. But this is not a rare occurrence. **He takes the photo and says they will take it for us. He knows the village and will deliver the news.** Riglan says - "tell her that he fell in battle, but he fought well and is laid to rest."

We gather in the middle of the circle. **Then there's a cry - a call - from the lookout. "Riders! Riders, with torches. Riders of Avacyn! They charge at us!"**

"They're here for you" says Clara. "Run! Run up the hill!" and Riglan says, "We only need a few seconds to cast the spell and be gone!" "Get out of range, you must not be interrupted!" "Thank you! Be safe!" and we run! Clara shouts after us - "Don't give up hope. It lives in you. It's in there somewhere, I know it..." - and Riglan just has time to shout back, "Yes! And you helped me find it!"

So we run around the cliff base, away from the approaching riders, looking for a way up the cliff. There's a small path. We clamber up. Ath / Acro checks are good except for the dog, which Riglan grabs and carries. Nethza is using her flying boots. As we flee, Riglan says, "OK, so this is less chill than I expected, but Maireagh - gotta try that scroll - but I haven't got the spell to help you!" Maireagh says, "Temo! You're up!" and exclaims, "What?! No pressure..."

We reach a flatter area and stop. Temo pulls out the scroll. He looks to Nethza. "This commits us. We defeat Azalin. No other choice" and pulls out the tuning fork. "Thanks Robert!" and reads the spell.

Arcana with luck 4,10+4->14 -> he stutters the first time, Maireagh helps (+5) - 19. Enough.

Space around us starts to sort of fold in. Strange. A brief, momentary jolting sensation...

...foom!

We're on the edge of the woods, sun on our face, warm, sound - birds, trees, fresh air! It smells euphoric. We squint, blinded briefly. Behind us, snow-capped mountains. Familiar. Riglan points - "That's the spine!" then looks at the woods. "Wait. Those are *my* woods - **we're close to Sungift...**" - a short pause - "...ah, by the hells! In the excitement, we forgot to get the tapestry back to Tummil!"

### 10500 XP (!) all-round (LEVEL 14)

Riglan, survival - nat 20 + 10 -> 30. He realises that not only is this close to Sungift, it's very close to where he originally emerged from the forest on his old path. It's maybe 300ft away. That can't be a coincidence.

"Well, I guess we should at least go to the village and see if things seem normal and - if so - probably travel by tree to maybe Deepgarden Keep, let people know we're OK and start finding people who can give us answers."

Riglan leads the way; it's not all that far. We head towards Sungift. Riglan perception 15. It seems oddly bright, but Riglan wonders if that's from the Shadowfell. It's also very warm. Suddenly Riglan goes, "Wait! It should be winter!" - so now we know that either the weather is broken, or time has moved unexpectedly.

There are a few baby groves, with bushes and saplings growing here and there; plants that are at a particular stage of growth; Riglan nature 19; he checks carefully; "it's probably mid-spring. Let's hope it's not too many years past! The school must've assumed we have been lost; I hope they continued in our absence."

Curiously, we start to notice people tending to the groves. That's unusual. Riglan would expect farming here, not early, planted groves; it's the kind of thing he might have been trying to teach them to do, but hadn't got that far. At least, he didn't *think* so. Riglan approaches one of the farmers. They look up.

"Oh! Good afternoon to you." and Riglan says, "Good afternoon." "Are you lost?" "Well, a little. We know Sungift is near but - we were actually wondering about these groves; they weren't here last time I was in this area, it was farming." "How long ago was that?" "I'm honestly not sure - seems like a while..." "That's OK! There's a ranger just in the next field. Why don't we head over there? I'm just about done planting these tomatoes." - they're training the plants to go up the saplings. "Thanks, that sounds good" says Riglan. He's getting an uneasy feeling.

The next field, they're building a trellis with various things growing up it. Atop, a halfing - Riglan recognises the ranger he'd stationed here, from Goldenfields. "Hi! Wow, Tabatha! How are you?" "Yes, Riglan! How are you? I mean - wow - hold on..." (she jumps down) "...good to see you! These must be your friends!"

There are introductions. Eventually Riglan draws Tabatha out of earshot of the farmers and gives her a very, very quick summary of where they've been. **"It's been about 5 months!"**

Insight 27. Tabatha seems a bit nervous. Her eyes dart around towards the grove, studying his face intently to see how he's feeling about - the groves, maybe? Riglan says, "One of the reasons I thought it had been a longer time is because I was surprised at how advanced the Silverculture is..." and Tabatha looks scared, "I did use a *bit* of magic..." and Riglan says, "No, that's fine! If that's what helps, if that gets people on board, and it gets things started, well, that's why we have this kind of magic. What else would it be for?"

It turns out it went a bit further than that - starting in autumn, things of course didn't grow; people started to get disinterested, so the cleric staged a "miracle" but that got them into a bit of a hole and more magic was needed to keep it going..." - but Riglan is relieved. She didn't do it without worrying about the morality of it; it wasn't an easy choice; and he wasn't here to give guidance anyway.

She sees he's worried and Riglan explains briefly about Azalin Rex. She can't really do much; she hasn't heard any strange stories or rumours, but she doesn't live in town or visit there. In the end, she offers to introduce Riglan to the farmers, and he gratefully accepts. About 20 are "on board" now. The fields aren't really fields now; they're turning into gardens, and as they get more rich, it persuades more farmers that the approach is valid. There is both flora and fauna in abundance. The farmers seem happy too. There's confidence that the silverculture approach means that the burgeoning ecosystem self-supports, so provided there's rain - which seems reliable at the moment - the ground itself, despite years prior as monoculture fields, will easily sustain these groves without further magic. The plan is for grazing animals to eventually be introduced, but not yet - too early, needs to establish first.

Their next big step is to build the trellis structures to help jumpstart the formation of a bit of a canopy and self-support the faster growing plants until the slower growing trees get large enough in a few years. No fruit this year, but some soon enough - next year should be good. She even points out little flowers in the fruit trees, which is a good sign.

"Is there anything you need from me, that I can help with? Seems like you've got it in hand!" "I think we might be alright, actually! But if you're headed to Goldenfields, you can tell them the project is underway - don't tell them we cheated..." Riglan laughs. "Well if anyone *does* ask you can tell them that I am completely happy with the approach taken."

We end up catching a ride with "Toby" into the village. It's market day. We could do with some fresh food! We chat away as we head in. He is full of gossip and stories. More traders through, since they have food to spare now and can sell it. There's even talk that they might need to build store houses, "like they have down south! Granaries, windmills!" Riglan puts on a conspiratorial face; "Ah, but it's always stories of strange goings on from afar that are the most fun! Any of that?" Apparently some dwarves came through - rumours they might start a brewery.

It's quite strange being at the market. Temo says, "Huh. Yes. Where it started!" "Yeah" answers Riglan. "Nobody busking though." Children playing in that area. The village fares well, it seems, at least on a bustling market day. There's barter as well as coin payment. Twice as many stalls as last time, upbeat.

We fill our boots out with fresh fruit and vegetables - we check the chest of preserving, and try taking out some of the food, which had rotted in the Shadow Fell. It does wilt slightly, but not much. OK, so that's alright. 5gp completely fills the chest.

Temo checks the tavern to see if Briony is there, or still on 'maternity leave'. And she is! She's there with now-not-quite-baby Lucian, carrying the wriggling boy while trying to work! Temo says, "Hi! Briony!" "Oh. Oh! *Oh!* Mr Temo! You're back. Haven't seen you in a while. Town's changed. Do you like what happened?" "Very much!" - she continues wrestling with the tiny toddler then puts him down; he giggles and sort-of-runs behind the bar. He's a year old, we're told and very active for his age.

We figure we can at least stop for a drink. It seems rude to say "hi" and then just run off. We sit at the bar so Briony can keep an eye on Lucian. Ale all round, 2sp. We chat, general smalltalk; Nethza enjoys it a lot - "Haven't had anything like this in a long time!" happily sipping away; Maireagh is less impressed - it's almost lager, which is why Nethza likes it, but Maireagh prefers heavier ales. This particular beer reminds Nethza of being younger and travelling. A reward after a night's work - crisp, refreshing, light.

### 3pm

We finish up and turn our thoughts back to the task at hand. We're told it's 3pm. We thank Briony, say our goodbyes and Riglan says, "I know a tree! If it's still there..." and Maireagh says, "I know trees too!" "OK, your tree or mine?!" and we chuckle at the silliness. Nethza says, "Isn't it strange, it's 3-something? Look how bright it is. A couple of people nearby look at her as if that's a strange thing to say. Riglan says, "I thought the same..." and looks at Temo. Wisdom 15; he says, "Yes, it's just because of what we got used to. Nobody else here thinks it's strange because it's not - it's 3pm in spring! Fortunately, no strange weather, not like the elemental stuff."

Outside, Riglan looks to the mountains. "I could say hi to the tribe, but we should press on. If we do a good job, there'll be plenty of time to say hi later" and finds the large tree he's used before. Two children play on the tree. He looks to the group, "Deepgarden Keep or Owlbear Tower?" Nethza and Marieagh speak at the same time. Nethza goes Deepgarden, Maireagh Owlbear. Temo agrees with the idea of going to the school. Riglan says, "I won't vote because we don't want a tie. Sorry Maireagh! Deepgarden it is." "So long as we go to the tower after" "We'll try."

He stands at the tree - and then - turns, looking super embarrassed. "Uuuh - that cloud thing we did? Yeah, I had to learn that in the morning instead of the tree thing. There weren't any trees! We could cloud fly?"

Maireagh suggests just going in the morning. It'd take so long, even at cloud speeds, that it won't make much difference. Argh. True tho. For the same reason, going to see the tribe wouldn't really work.

Riglan says, "Perhaps we should just camp out? Rest? Or do you want to see if there's an inn these days?" - Temo has a spark in his eye! "Well how about that little alleyway? We can climb to the roof... Watch the sunset. If the roof is strong enough, I could put up the hut there and we could sleep in the same place."

Why not. It's only 3pm so a long time til sunset, so we spend time just walking around the village, chatting to people, more time browsing the market, more ale with Briony, and eventually have an early dinner at the tavern before sunset - hare stew. On the talking to people, Temo wants to find out as much rumour and outside news as he can, so does his best to persuade people to open up. A rather dodgy 9+15->24 persuasion.

* A third-hand-kinda tale from a tavern "off in the east", giants footprints found on the edge of a bog! "Like a march of giants!"
* "Did you know" - they think people are coming in and stealing food from the gardens at night. Strange-shaped small things, like some kind of gremlins that steal food. "Are you sure that's not just the children?!"

Meanwhile, Riglan perception 29. As all this is going on, one person sits by a window at a table by himself, in a dark-ish corner. In fact the only reason Riglan can really see him is from oblique late-evening light coming in from the window. He seems to be observing us while looking inconspicuous. Riglan stands up, walks over, sits down and says, "I'd offer to buy you a drink, but I'd rather buy information." "Well I don't drink!" "Information it is. You were observing us; I don't mean that in an eavesdropping way, I'm just curious about why." "I'm passing through. I find the behaviour of locals worth studying. Learning the customs." "Well, fascinating I'm sure; and by that study, you have of course deduced that we're not locals." "Well, but you seem to know the place! So I was puzzled." "We have been here before." Riglan asks about rumours about anything bad turning up - maybe a creature hiding; something like that... But he's not heard anything particularly nefarious. Political machinations down at Neverwinter. Old feuds between Baldur's Gate and Elturel renewed, though last I heard, "Duke Ulder Ravengard was about to ride to Elturel on a diplomatic mission." Whispers - as always! - of ancient forces in the East slowly manoeuvring with designs on the Sword Coast.

Riglan tries to ask what he does as a profession. Persuasion only 12; he's evasive, but says he's a kind of tracker, hunts things down. Between jobs at the moment. Riglan asks about maybe finding Azalin Rex, but he can't help; not enough to go on; but if bought dinner, he'll tell us where we should go to seek such information. In fact, he'll give us two options. Riglan buys dinner, and says, "One of these is going to be Candlekeep isn't it?" "Ha! Candlekeep *is* a treasure trove of information - *but* Candlekeep is not *current*. If this person you seek, this creature, has been here long enough, there's a high chance that something has been written."

A fair point. So the options he suggests are:

* A seer that lives on the edge of the **Anauroch Desert**. She is referred to as **V**. The letter. It's short for something! He doesn't know what. He gives Riglan a reasonably detailed idea of location, but it's not exact.

* The other option Luskan. Riglan says "Ah, heard of that - some town up north, near the spine?" "Yes, an old city. Used to be thriving, now a trading down. I've done work for people there who seem to know a *lot* of things. They wield powerful magic. One of those masters, that I met there at a place called the Arcane Brotherhood, was *very* skilled in the arts of divination."

Divination! Facepalm moment. Riglan thanks the guy, leaves him to his food and returns to the table where the others are - we have to leave for the sunset now! So we scuttle out, Temo leading the way, get to the alleyway; it's all as it used to be, so we clamber up onto the roof. We stand, atop the building, watching the sun setting towards the west; towards Luskan and the ocean, in fact. The majestic mountains to Riglan's right turn a deep blue as the sun leaves the lower slopes, a pale yellow-orange remaining on snow-capped tips. Then the sun reaches just the right point, below scattered clouds, to light up their undersides a bright orange. A vast view. "Not bad!" says Temo. Riglan asks Temo if he knows of a church or chapel in town. Just the one; Chauntaea - Riglan's been. He tells them about the conversation in the tavern, but says "divination" reminded him that it's an option. He's not expecting an answer to the question "where is Azalin Rex" because he can surely hide himself from that, but the question "how might I find Azalin Rex" could stand a chance of being useful. Worth a try.

We head over. There are no attendants there, as it is late and dinner time anyway, and Riglan doesn't feel too comfortable lighting incense in here without permission, except there's a sort of shrine area where that seems to be done often. So, he asks the others to keep watch and starts his ritual. He might buy incense from them afterwards!

At the completion of casting, the sweet smoke fills the interior of the temple. Riglan asks; "How might I find Azalin Rex".

The smoke swirls immediately, but doesn't form anything coherent; it swirls around him in strange streams. But then, Riglan hears whispering voices! That's new. "Seek! Seek! Seek what you desire. Search! Search! Search and you will find." One voice then gets clearer. "Ask another question! Ask us something we can answer." **Riglan asks, "*Who* could help us find Azalin Rex?" More swirls, whispering sounds. Then a gasp! Almost an excited noise; but then things flit away; the smoke stops swirling and now starts to coalesce. A huge, tree-like shape. A face appears in the tree. It speaks. "The answer to that which you seek lies in the mind of She Who Is Evil. Tread carefully. Do not lose yourself to the goal that you seek, or all will be lost. Guard against her evil and you will find your prize." The tree looks as if it catches fire! It returns to smoke, and the smoke dissipates.**

Maireagh encourages Riglan to write down the words as close he can remember them. The answer is ambiguous, which Riglan says is because he's not good at asking the right questions; but within the exact wording of the answer could be important clues. By writing it down, we won't risk forgetting.

At that moment, a side entrance door opens and the Priestess of Chauntea walks in, coughing. "Riglan! You're back! It's been a while! Did you do this?!" "Sorry about all the smoke. Divination. I might've overdone it! Don't suppose you have spare incense for sale?!" "It's one of our main streams of income!"

Riglan tops up his supply and pays, as we both talk about the issues they had starting up the groves. Eventually, we head back out and Riglan tells the others. "Who do you think it is? The Raven Queen? Someone we don't know yet?" Thing is, the Raven Queen would not "traditionally" be considered evil; at least not on *this* world. Enigmatic and not exactly *good* but not evil. Maireagh stops, deep in thought. "No... No, no. You didn't get the answer to the question you asked, but the more important question not asked that *was* answered - is that he is here."

Maybe. Some debate, it did "feel" as if the answers were not talking about other planes or "who is that" or "not in this world yet". Maireagh suggests that as we find out more, maybe it'll be worth asking again. It's always about the right question!

Lots of questions. An interesting day! Time to sleep. We head liked it on the roof; so we head up, quietly roll out bed mats and Temo casts his Tiny Hut, so we can watch the stars, but not be observed casually form the ground. Old habits die hard, and we don't know if anything from the Shadow Fell followed us out!



## Day 24 - however, roughly 5 months have passed - it is mid-spring

(Via con saves) Maireagh wakes up first. Riglan's not in the hut. Maireagh gets up; Riglan sends the dog to look; dog says he's just outside. He's sat on the edge of the roof, but hunched over and looks like he might be crying. Maireagh asks what he's doing, and he jumps and looks sort of guilty and embarrassed and surprised.

He confesses first to having, in a sense, given up on Nethza; going with Avacyn, to save that realm. It was really Maireagh in fact that talked him out of it! He doesn't know if she can forgive him.

Then he confesses that it's his fault. He saw Lady Ecrit conning Robert Orin and told Robert to meet Temo without asking. He didn't want to give Robert our money, so we had to give him the Adamantium ingot instead - which was from our world / our plane. And Riglan underestimated Robert's kindness; Robert made the spell focus from the ingot to help us get home. Azalin just killed lots of people, stole it and then could escape, tearing that plane apart - while being conveyed to *our* plane in the process.

Maireagh says this isn't the only truth. It's not the only way to look at it. It's a choice to make. But she points out that without the ingot, Rex planned to escape anyway. Sooner or later. Nethza might've ended up trapped on the throne forever, either way, odds are that and we wouldn't have any idea where he went - never mind where on our plane, but where in all of the planes across however many there may be. We'd possibly have no chance of ever finding him - or certainly, a much lesser chance than we do on our home world.

We kick things around. Eventually, Riglan stands and sniffs. "I don't think I'll ever escape the guilt of what happened int he Shadow Fell. But I appreciate your words. Thank you, Maireagh."

She answers, "I don't think any of us live without guilt. It's what we do with the guilt that matters. Don't imagine that any of us here live without guilt! But our built is our own. We are the only ones who can choose to let that go." Maireagh for the first time sees the child in Riglan, who in reality is very young - only just an adult by his own tribe's standard.

We wake the others; well, Nethza is up. Unclear how much she heard. Temo is snoring. We get breakfast and discuss next options - well, if nothing else, Deepgarden to let the school know and let Qelline know, and check on the Keep. We can close it down properly for our long journey - wherever that is.

We pack up and head to a big tree. Riglan has the right spell now. "Ready?" he asks... And then - "Oh, town centre or Owlbear?" "What's more important?" "Other people are more important than us. They'll be worried. Town centre."

And with that, the portal opens and we step through.


 
### Day 24, 8:30am - mid-spring due to time shift - Deepgarden Keep

Riglan takes us to a big tree in the garden at the base of the keep, near the old mines. The sun hasn't come up to illuminate the garden here, so we climb up. Flowers are out, smells sweet. We pass gardeners and say hello. They're surprised to see us!

The school gates are open, a good sign. In we go. It's very quiet. Almost no sound. Temo looks worried. The doors to the library and main hall are closed. What time is it? 8:30am, we think. We try to find Klaus, who'd held the portal open for us; nobody in the staff room. It's not abandoned but there's nobody here. Riglan's curious about the activity room, to check the portal did close properly so we peer inside. Similar story - not abandoned, but nobody here. There's visible patch-up damage to stonework that we think was from the portal but it's otherwise gone. A relief.

Next, we try the great hall. The big double doors are easy for Riglan to push open. There's a collective gasp! A room full of heads turn towards us. Klaus and the Principle are there - Klaus goes "SSSH!" - it's an exam! Doh. Unfortunately, the damage is done - excited students jump up. Temo, quick-witted, says "We'll tell you all about it - but only if you finish your papers first!" and we leave as Klaus beckons for us to leave the room.

"That could've gone better" says Riglan as we get outside. A moment later Klaus appears. "Your timing is terrible! It's their Preliminary Exams!" We apologise - we don't know the exact date (so he fills us in). We explain about the Shadow Fell time issues. Klaus hugs Nethza - "Are you alright, lass?!" "I think so!" Klaus casts some spell and mumbles something; Riglan recognises Message. Klaus hears from the principle that the students are settling back into their exams. We head to the garden.

To Riglan's shock, there's still a tiny purple sliver there. "Oh! It didn't close!" he says; Klaus says it's as good as he can get. Too small for things to get in or out, but it's left a kind of scar. Not too big! It'll be fine, we hope.

We've promised to tell the kids "all about it", so we'll wait an hour or so until the exams are over and then tell the story (without the gore!). In the mean time, we can check the library and find the location of the Anauroch Desert; there are no details, but we know where it is now. As for Luskan and the Arcane Brotherhood, Klaus does have a bit of info in the library, but necessarily sanitised for the kids! We learn it is indeed mixed gender, generally considered evil (as Maireagh had said earlier); we learn about the tower where they reside, and get an impression that it is *not* an easy thing to gain an audience.

Soon enough, it's time to do our part and tell the kids what happened. We give a kid-appropriate version - no children cut out of slain deer! - with minor illusions and music. Temo, performance 19. Not his best but it's always hard to do illusions *and* play.

One child asks if we were scared. Temo says, "I wasn't, most of the time, except when we actually found Nethza with that strange creature. That was very scary." "But how did you know what to do?" Temo goes quiet. Riglan says, "We just sort of had to guess and do our best. We've fought battles before, and some of us - just by nature of the kind of creature we are - have lived quite a lot of years, and that helps. But we did make a lot of mistakes." "But how were you able to overcome the fear of making the wrong choice?"

Now Riglan goes quiet for a moment and then answers - "well, for a while, I did get stuck. I was torn between two things. But I had my friends around me. And if you ever get stuck, ask your friends. They'll help you out. Mine did." So now one asks Nethza how she knew what to do when her friends weren't around! "Well I just had to trust my gut and make the best decision I could. You don't know if it's the right decision, but you think about it, weigh up your options, try to make the best choice you can and then make the best out of it."

"How did you know they'd come and get you?" "I didn't know. But I believed. I believed I'd find a way through." "...So you believe in fate?" "No; I don't believe in fate. I think we're the masters of our own fate. We can choose to believe in fate, which in turn makes it real and locks us into a cycle of feeling powerless; or we can choose to believe that we have an ability to change the world. And that is what I chose."

"So you're saying the key to life is to believe in yourself?" "Hmmm, no, not quite. You have to weigh these things up. There's no one answer to everything. The answer just is never that easy! Don't over-think it. Don't worry about things that haven't happened yet. Deal with it as it comes along or you'll always be worried about things that never happen." Riglan pipes up and says "It's true. And it takes a while. I'm still learning that one myself!"

"Always be prepared!" adds Maireagh. "I keep all my tools and everything on me. You never know when you might need them."

Things wrap up. It's around 11:30am. We bid farewell and go to find the mayor, Sildar, to let him know we're OK and back and did the Shadow Fell thing. We head over to the hall. He's easy to find.

"Ah! My goodness. I was wondering what happened. Did you go off on an adventure?" and we give him a very brief summary. He needs to check if this is "official" - **he can alert the Lords Alliance**. They can adopt a defensive posture. That seems very wise! We agree. "That gives me an excuse for the timing of what I needed to do anyway... I need to be away for a while, but I'm only about a month away from being recalled because our job here is done!" "Oh no!" says Riglan; "We'll miss you!" "And I you. But I feel like I'm able to be around a bit longer now, if that's happened; because it means that Deepgarden Keep is once again at the centre of something. Which, for a small town, is an unusual thing. It will never be big enough to be a member of the Lord's Alliance or to have a direct representative there - forever a vassal town, linked to Yartar."

He opens a chest and pulls out a small bag and an ingot. "This came for you, but what I will do is get them to deliver it directly to Owlbear Keep now." "Thank you!" "I have had to take some out of this, to give to the school." "Yes, that's fine. After all, that's been the administrative relationship. So if things do go to Owlbear, we need to make sure that the right fraction still comes here for the school. How long will you be away?" "Probably about three weeks to get there and back." "We don't know where we're headed next, but either way it looks like a longer journey than that. We probably won't be here when you return, unless you want us to wait?" "No. I imagine we all have things we need to do. Wheels to set in motion." "Yes. Here!" and he hands us the bag - 850gp plus a Mithril ingot! Wow. No idea what *that's* worth but it'd be good to make armour or similar, if we're ever somewhere that can do it (maybe Kaz could! We can ask.)

We wish Sildar a very safe journey; we're sure he knows how to message us. He also hands Riglan a pin. "In case you're ever anywhere where you need to speak to a member or emissary of the Lord's Alliance and they don't know who you are, this will get you an audience with the local representative". "Thanks!"

Temo is keen to visit Qelline next. He looks a bit bashful about it so Riglan suggests, for his benefit "Well, we might be short on time. So how about the three of us go to the market for supplies and lunch while you do that, and we'll meet back up wherever you want -  just message us!"

Temo runs off!

The rest of us go to the market. We fill the Chest Of Preserving to the brim! Then we get some lunch stuff on top and eat while we walk, with some saved of course for Temo. Riglan suggests talking to Kaz about the Mithril, so we head there, if nothing else to say hello. Maireagh and Kaz catch up; lots of stories, but some of it abstract as we don't want to alarm people about Azalin so don't talk about that.

As for the ingot, it's considered a significant quantity. An entire breastplate could be made, bit it's a bit tricky - we've all got various kinds of magical armour or, in Temo's case, flexible stud leather that lets him take advantage of his dexterity. We'd save weight, but otherwise be comparatively disadvantaged by switching to a non-magical breastplate, even though one made from Mithril would be rare and valuable.

On the other hand, it *is* still rare and valuable, especially to the right person; and could be enchanted by a new owner. So, we commission Kaz to make a general fit breastplate which we'll keep in the bag of holding and could be a bargaining chip. It'll take about a week. She asks about designs; we ask for traditional Dwarven adornments, so that it's very clearly of renowned Dwarven origin, but otherwise undecorated so a new owner could assign their own crest or similar. We're asked about size - as standard as it can be made with as much potential to adjust as possible.

Price is negotiated. Maireagh pays and says she can of course keep left-over mithril.

We haven't heard from Temo so start off towards the farm.

Meanwhile - Temo. He's run excitedly all the way there. The shop is open; he bursts in; there's a scream! "TEMOOOOOOO!" - a crash, apples roll everywhere, and Carp launches himself from a stool, running to Temo and jumping up into a hug. Athl 5+0; he's bowled over and knocked prone with Carp hugging.

Temo looks out from under Carp to Qelline standing over. "Uh... Hi!" Qelline removes Carp and Temo starts picking up Apples. Carp has ink on his fingers and ink stains - "Practicing writing?" asks Temo. "I was doing my homework!" "Good lad." Qelline meanwhile picks up a spilled ink pot.

Temo gives a brief summary - Nethza rescued, Shadow Fell, time differences, sorry it's been so long. Temo encourages Carp to finish his homework; "I've finished!"; insight 19+1; no way. Temo knees down to Carp's level. "Really?" "I promise I'll do it later." Temo says, "I've not come back all this way for you to break a promise. So, you're sure?" "Yes!" (16 persuasion) "OK".

Qelline flips the sign on the door to "Closed" and adds another, "Out for lunch". "Let's go to the cottage for tea and biscuits". As she walks, she reaches for Temo's hand, which he takes. There's a cloth-lined jar of warm biscuits. Temo says, "There's a chance I only like you for your biscuits, you know!"

We catch up.

By the time everyone else gets to the cottage - having seen the shop closed, but with a knocked over barrel of apples and what look like streaks of red and black on the ground (not knowing it's ink) - for a moment he panics, then realises; "I think Carp happened" he says and heads to the cottage - we're just in time to see Temo eat the last cookie.

"I suppose you won't need this lunch then!" says Riglan.

Carp loses it again, at our arrival! Carp offers Riglan a half-eaten cookie. "Wow! Thank you!" and Riglan takes it gratefully. "Good cookie" he says through the crumbs.

Carp sits on Temo's lap while there's more catching up. We do of course have to leave again, there's work to be done; 1:30pm; we all go back to the shop and finish cleaning up and getting rid of ink stains with the cleaning stone. Carp settles back into homework as promised.

Temo goes up to Qelline while everyone else is helping and says "I'm sorry I have to go again. I know you don't like it, you left the adventuring behind. But this one's important." "I know what it's like! I understand. But it was nice to see you. Thank you for coming here and letting me know you're OK. You know it means a lot to Carp to see you." Temo says, "Oh, I wanted to see you both, it was almost selfish to drop in only to tell you I'm leaving again..." "You know that Carp's fallen in love with you of course! You have a hard job now. You have to survive! You have to make it back." Temo sighs, "Riglan and the others taught me not promise things I can't be sure of. But I can be sure of this - there isn't a safer group I could travel with. We've got each other out of trouble often. We even escaped the Shadow Fell."

(Temo is, quite literally, inspired by meeting Qelline again and having that conversation).

We talk of futures, maybe stopping adventuring, but Qelline would never ask that. People stop when they want. Reidoth is mentioned; they were very close once. Temo clears his throat and looks over at Riglan, who looks back a bit confused; Temo says, just, "Reidoth?" and Riglan nods and heads outside.

**(Outside, Riglan calls bird and tries to convince it to fly out to the rather dangerous - at least on the ground - marshes towards the old village, for a message to Reidoth. He has some worms for bribery! Nat 1 animal handling. The bird eats the worms, and flies off. Riglan sighs and tries again, can't win 'em all! This time, 16. A blackbird. It is happy to take the message. Riglan thanks it and lets it fly off.)**

Eventually, it's time to leave. Old Owlbear Keep beckons. We could tree-travel with a L7, or we can try our luck with animal shapes... In the end we figure that it's a bit of a push to try and carry Temo and the dog on a giant owl via his figurine, with Riglan carrying both Maireagh and Nethza as a giant eagle - but fun to try! Riglan wildshapes; Nethza and Maireagh climb on his back, with Maireagh doing clever things with rope for safety. The dog's happier being carried in a claw leaving Temo to ride the owl. Off we go! It's a 3-4 hour flight at the normal owl speed, but it's good to see the land and changes of spring as fly over the familiar countryside.

### 6pm

On approach, we notice that the area around Old Owlbear Keep is shrouded in some low fog. That's unusual, even for early evening as the mid-spring sun starts to reach the horizon. It sits in a ring around the tower; Riglan pulls ahead of the owl and angles down and around to try and get a look in an arc following the ring. Nature, 10+10->20. It does in fact seem to be completely natural! The breathing effect of all the trees and other plants in the area coupled with the location of the tower itself produces the effect. He's never noticed it before. But unless someone knew, it means they might overlook the tower if travelling nearby - quite handy, in its own way.

Riglan flies back up to Temo on the owl, nods his eagle head and they fly in to land. A pack of wolves can be seen running towards our landing clearing, so Nethza and Maireagh dismount; Riglan returns to his normal form and howls "hello" in wolf! They run up, speaking and nuzzling his hand (he produces bits of sausage, other meats). They've been good, they say - kept the place safe! Riglan thanks them.

Near a thicket, six small faces pop out. Riglan gasps and runs over! "Puppies!" 6 little wolf pups. Too young for meat. They're quite playful, so Riglan kind of tumbles around for them for a while as the other wolves introduce the latest litter. Riglan says, "It is good that prosper in this land. I had hoped so."

They speak of a "near incident"; they looked after it... Some people were snooping, a group of 3, in the woods. They almost stumbled across the tower but the wolves managed to scare them off.

We're able to check in with the small group that were left here. A groundskeeper, one of the builders who'd first helped restore the tower; Maireagh's research assistant and two others. They've kept things in good order. Wages are brought up to date - and a chunk in paid in advance, since we're going to be headed off again for an unknown time. They ask if there's anything that needs to be done. One apprentice druid - not quite a druid yet! - in particular comes to Riglan. **Jordan Redwood**. Riglan thinks for a minute then says, "This might not seem important, but believe me, it's vital. I made a promise and a solemn one." - he pulls the seeds/acorns from the Shadow Fell from his pocket, from the trees he'd spoken to. "Would you like me to plant these?" "Yes" "I know just the spot!" Riglan explains briefly why it matters. Riglan thinks for a minute then hugs Jordan. "Sorry. Don't mean to be awkward. But this means a lot."

Jordan heads off with Riglan to show him a clearing in the woods where a big old tree fell, passing from natural causes. It's only a few minutes away. Over the winter, its trunk is breaking down now and small plants are starting to push up as nature regenerates. Joran shows Riglan where he thinks he'll plant the seeds. Looks good!

We stay as he plants them so Riglan can give them his blessing. The others arrive to witch. Riglan recites something he heard his parents recite for new life sometimes, but then says, "In the tradition of Sungift - sometimes it never hurts to cheat a bit..." and casts Plant Growth to help things along. It boosts the clearing. "Since we're doing *that*..." says Maireagh, "...stand back!" and casts Create Water, which, as we saw in the fire in the High Forest, can be used to cause rain to give everything a helping hand too.

Back at the tower, it's evening and food-o-clock and we discuss where next. The groundskeeper offers to cook for all. The fourth guy - a maintenance man - reports on things he's repaired, maintained, progress on other bits of rebuilding after archaeology is completed, that kind of thing. Maireagh's research assistant reports new findings too. It's nothing ground-breaking but all of interest.

Where next... Well, a big city. Yartar perhaps? There's a teleportation circle; Nethza can get us there. At least know of friends/allies there, so we could start with that and if we need bigger resource again, Riglan can use a tree to Waterdeep. Yartar seems like a good starting point - both for nostalgia and people who might help us with research, such as our archivist friend.

Riglan's considering sleeping here, but Nethza says we can go tonight if we want. Hmm. It's emotionally a little disappointing (!) but it makes sense, we don't know how urgent anything is, so if an opportunity arises to be quick, we should take it. The people here are doing a good job and don't need us around anyway. We make sure they've plenty of spare upkeep money and tell them that Deepgarden should be sending mining proceeds here directly in future. Maireagh's research assistant will look after that.

Well then. We're fed and watered. Nethza takes us to the recently-cleared upper room in the tower. Little piles of catalogued discoveries lie around with a nice empty space. Riglan looks out of the windows through the twilight, to take in the view; the mist has settled in and is triggering for a minute! An early-night howling from the wolves and mist. But this is our home, and all is well. A nearly full moon above. He chuckles at that. "Best teleport before the hunt happens!" he says, pointing out the window towards it. Nethza is drawing out the runes.

"Inside! Inside quick!" she says as they are completed; her chant is finished; and things around us "fold" in, as if we're pulling into a drain in the middle, as if water. There's a feeling of turning upside down, then the reverse happens; and then we're standing in a room, whiteish-grey stone, and an astonished-looking school teacher with a prefect alongside, mouth agape, in the doorway. Temo goes, "Woah! That was a cool portal!" as Riglan says, "Hi!" and Nethza says "It's OK! It's OK! We're allowed to be here" all speaking at once.

The teacher gathers herself. "Well, OK. Um, welcome to the academy... Best come out of the room! Is there anything we can help you with, or just using the portal? But I can't figure out, which one of you were students here once?" - we explain that we got the access via Llanowar, who we met here and helped with a family issue and terrible fire at their village in the High Forest. We hope it is OK to use the portal in this fashion; it's quite important... "Besides, I bought lots of things in the shop!" says Temo (and taps his wand holster).

We bluff our way out and spill onto the early-evening streets of Yartar. This part of town is quiet but across the bridge is activity as usual. The Grand Dame is already out and cruising - we can see it in the distance, downriver. The archives would be closed this time of night but Lanowin *might* be there if working late... It's cheeky, but why come here tonight at all if not to get things started? So we cross over and head there, since it's close by. The archive door is indeed shut, but Riglan, perception 18+10->28 is sure he sees lights on in upper room. "I'll be right back!" he says and turns into a crow to fly up to the window. The window is, fortunately, open. Inside are four people, sat around the table with books open, drinks and nibbles. They're talking excitedly. One is Lanowin. Riglan waits for what seems like a break in conversation before going "CAW!" and flying to the middle of the room, landing on the floor. He sees one of them roll a set of dice; it lands on the table; they gasp; two turn to the crow. "Oh! It's crow" and Riglan uses that opportunity to wildshape back, hoping not to have surprised them too much. They're playing a game of course.

Riglan "Hope I didn't startle you!" "It's games night." "Looks good! Temo might enjoy that... Lanowin, don't know if you remember us?" He remembers Riglan; we head downstairs to open the doors and let everyone else in. We head back up, so that the game can be continued to completion - shouldn't take long. Temo watches with interest; it's quite strange, there are dice and cards and they seem to be pretending to be other characters. It *sounds* interesting and they seem to be having a lot of fun.

They wrap up - time for food and drinks, they say. Half an hour. Off the other three go and we produce fresh food for Lanowin and then get into it - first of all, any information on Azalin Rex; appearance, known interventions in planes, etc.; he has a book detailing legends, that's all. That's a start. Next up, arcane brotherhood - if we wanted an audience, where would we start? How's it normally done? He can research that. Maybe get some names. He says they're not precisely *evil* but certainly self-serving. Last one is seers. Modern-day. V, the desert, female seer; any journals, anecdotes, that kind of thing. It'll take a few days to research. We're happy to pay and we're happy to wait. Plenty of other angles we can play.

The cost is the same as last time; 5gp per day, of which we pay 10 in advance now. There may be costs on top; we're good for it.

* Azalin Rex - well he can have the book for us tomorrow morning
* Seer could take 2-3 days
* Brotherhood would take a day

We decide Seer first, Brotherhood next & we'll come tomorrow for the books. His friends return, we bid farewell and leave them to their game.

And then, why not? Treat ourselves. It's been ages since we had anything *fun* - Halassa's Waterwell & Fine Wines, it's where we all found things we liked together. Between that and the market, we spend about 10gp on a really great night. Riglan feels the horrors of the Shadow Fell fade a little in his mind. Decorations are up because inevitably there's another festival coming! Equinox festival, tomorrow. Let's hope the equinox is nothing special for Azalin!

Finally, we head up to our "usual haunt", the White-Winged Griffon to see if there are rooms. We're in luck; two twin rooms. We'll take 'em! We book for 3 nights, 6gp (1gp per room per night). Riglan once again - and Temo - notice how things that not long ago felt very expensive are now just nothing. When they get to the room - and they're really nice, we'd almost forgotten! - Riglan and Temo once again get into their favourite topic about how to distribute wealth and what we do with what we have. More than we can sped. Riglan's reticence to spend a lot with Robert Orin might've had bad consequences and reminded him how addictive it is.

Perhaps we save for powerful artefacts, while adventuring; we don't know what we'll need. But afterwards, it's a different story.
