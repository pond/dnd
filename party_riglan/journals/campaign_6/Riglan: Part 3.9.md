# Riglan: Part 3.9
## Day 26, mid-spring, after equinox
### 3:30pm (Yartar)

We remember we were after a Scroll of Sending. We check with their Scrollkeeper. "A scroll of Sending?! Must be very important business. You are in luck, though; we have one, it's one of our Master scrolls..." and pulls out a beautifully made scroll "...very high level magic. This is a *third* level spell!"

(Temo realises he can cast it, but never hurts to have a Plan B, Riglan could cast it). The lady asks for 375gp. Temo is about to bargain - but then checks himself. This is a school. A school of magic. He has one of those. It's important.

To everyone's surprise, he doesn't bargain. He just says "Yes, no problem" and Riglan pays. They give us a very beautiful scroll case for the school too. It's had so much effort spent on making it beautiful! It's a one-use item... Yet, nonetheless, that's what they've done. This is also their highest level scroll, it transpires. The edges are even gilded, so rolled up the whole thing looks like a gold cylinder. The square wooden decorative case has rounded supports inside to keep the scroll secure and it's wrapped in a gossamer kind of cloth.

When we get outside, Riglan says, "Seems you're a proper wizard now, in the eyes of the school" and Temo tries not to show it but he's actually really quite pleased about that.

Town looks from here like it still reasonably busy - second day of the festival. First day after the full moon. A few ships catch our eye in the river; four are approaching the dock, with strange swept-back sails, almost like half of a swallow's tail. Temo looks and says, "I thought the Silverymoon thing was by magic - so - I don't think that's elves; shall we go and be nosey and find out who it is?" Riglan history 4+5, doesn't know either & agrees.

We cross the bridge. Others are moving the same way too - not the only ones being nosey! Riglan perception only 5+10->15; strange, maybe there's a good explanation for it; but they're super clean. We've seen boats in the water a lot. There's a certain look, a "patina" if you like, to ships that spend a lot of time in the water. These ships don't look like they've spent much time afloat at all - they could be brand new off the shipyard.

Temo gets closer to investigate; 10+14->24. Upon pulling into harbour, long slightly arched gangplanks are extended upwards then outwards - walkways, really, that extend all the way to the ground. They don't even need to dock at the outer piers as a result. Temo perception 16+6->22. The crew start to disembark, dressed in very bright colours with long flowy gowns, men and women alike, with sashes for belts. Thin, short jackets are worn over the top, brocaded satin, with cape-like cowls, which look like they have a wire in. Temo thinks they look *similar* to humans but the facial features look a bit different; a uniform light "milky coffee"-coloured skin, and uniformly delicate features. They also have quite fair hair, light reddish-brown. The men have it cut short, so Temo can see their ears are round, so not elves; the women have the hair cut just above the shoulder. There's a consistency which suggests a uniform - court, or military, or something, *but* the colours are varied, as if that's a personal choice and none of it is monochromatic. It's all bright.

(Quite a crowd has gathered.)

After that, come pairs of people carrying (in front and behind) beautiful ornate chests held by two poles. Each ship lets off about 8 people, including the four bearers of two chests from each ship. No hierarchy is evident.

From the last ship to dress comes someone looking different. This is a woman dressed in the same pearl-white colour as the ship sails, with the trim of the jacket, sleeves and hem of a skirt/gown a gleaming gold thread. They wear a diadem and choker necklace, other cuffs and rings; same hairstyle as the other women but a more striking makeup - think Hollywood portrayal of Cleopatra. They have a regal beauty and elegance but do not carry themselves in a haughty, regal way.

All seem friendly to the crowds around, smiling and acknowledging rather than ignoring, though moving on with the impression of having a job to do. The 'regal' person is much more interactive with the crowd, and as she passes down the walkway, two of the first to disembark who had stood to one side wait until she's passed and then follow, flanking behind, as if guards. They look strong, but nobody carries weapons visibly.

From what Temo can see, they seem to be headed to the Waterbaron's Hall. He says to the others, "Follow me! We'll beat them to the Waterbarons!" and darts off, soon using passageways, back alleys, darting between market stalls. But we're not alone - a messenger in front of us seems equally adept at navigating a city as Temo, running ahead, apparently to try and alert the Waterbaron too. Temo shouts ahead, "Messenger! Who are they?" and the messenger calls back over the shoulder, "Them? They look like they're from the East! I've never seen them before!"

Riglan is hurrying along but as he does he's sketched onto his favourite sheet of a paper a symbol that was on the ship sails. He's never seen it before. Temo notices the messenger carrying paper with the same thing drawn.

Riglan falls behind a bit as he suddenly thinks - ah! The Eastern Empires book! - and as he hurries after the group, he pulls out the book, but isn't able to actually check it as we're hurrying. We reach the Hall - we've no reason to be here, except this seems significant, so Temo just lays on the charm. Roll of 4 is low but Reliable Talent -> persuasion 10+15 -> 25.

A whirlwind of Temo charm is sufficiently disarming that the guards let us through before having a chance to realise that maybe, they shouldn't have!

Temo bounds up the stairs; we're trailing behind; we've soon caught up with the out-of-breath messenger at the top. The Waterbaron's secretary has already fetched the Waterbaron. The messenger stands up all, trying to hide being out of breath and holds up the picture of the symbol on the sails, explaining - "...Four very speedy-looking ships with triangular cream white sails, bearing this pattern, just arrived and delegates are headed here directly! Some 33 of them in all, I believe. They appear to be bringing chests." "My goodness. How long do I have?!" and Riglan, uninvited to speak `;-)` shouts "...about five minutes!"

A flurry of barely-concealed panic action ensues. Calls for tea to be made, finding a formal cloak, and seeing us the Waterbaron asks "Oh, do *you* have anything to do with this?!" "No!" "Do you know who they are?" and we flip through our book frantically. Temo, investigation 26. We have a minute to spare when we spot it.

"**Sembia**!" shouts Riglan, excitedly. "They're from **Sembia**, It's the Kingdom immediately to the East of Cormyr. They are... Uuuh... A republic, a collection of semi-independent cities with different representatives to a Senate of sorts. The symbol on the sails of these ships is from the City-State called **Saerloon**" (and Riglan spells that out in Common).

With only seconds to go, we're told not to leave but to "just stay and look like staff!" - we had practice of that at the gala at the Ecrit household in the Shadowfell! Hurried instructions to Nethza, and we retreat to corners of the room, trying to look like we're useful for... Something."

Just as the Waterbaron has got ready, in the nick of time, the doors open. The woman in cream walks in first; we assume now that she must be some kind of parliamentarian; not behaving like royals because it's not a Kingdom. She takes a step forward, greets the Waterbaron in full title and by name while bowing; the Waterbaron tries to formulate some kind of formal reply! "Greetings. Welcome to Yartar. It must be quite a journey from Sarlo - Searloon." Riglan sees the lady, coming up from her bow, smiling. "You are aware of us! I'm impressed. Not many have heard of our city-state. My name is **Ilithylia**. I am the Third Representative of Say-er-lunn" (a subtle pronunciation correction!) "...and it is my honour to visit the beautiful town of Yartar. It is a beautiful place, far more lively and vibrant and colourful than even the stories depict. It is our tradition to present an offering, as a token of gratitude and by way of opening diplomatic relations."

She steps to the side as the chests are brought forward. "May we please show you what we have brought?" and the Waterbaron is taken aback. "Well, OK, this is quite unusual - I'm afraid it is not our custom - but I'm certainly eager to learn more about yours" "Oh, there is no need for reciprocal gifts, because we come unannounced."

The four of us can see there's a bit of ritual here; some formalities on both sides, trying to seem polished, but both of them winging it a bit. The Waterbaron looks briefly worried - Riglan imagines she's worried about what might be in these unknown chests; either something bad or dangerous, or something very expensive and impossible to match in return. In fact, the first two are full of exotic fruit produce. The next is full of things made - fermented, cooked or baked. The last is full of crafted items - cloths, bags, beaded jewellery. It's nothing crazily valuable, no weapons, or gold bars or gems; it's just an insight into what *actually* comes from that land and that city. Very local, at a guess; grown and produced there; since the custom they describe seems likely that the intent is to have these things spread amongst the people in the government/court/area so that they leave an influence - they are remembered. Money or jewellery might just be put into a treasury, indistinguishable from others. This produce will be remembered; whether eaten or drunk, or worn or carried.

Ilithylia very quickly describes an overview of the contents during this presentation, then people carry the chests off to the sides of the room. They seem to be trying to make themselves scarce a bit since there's lots of them and don't want to appear to be in overwhelming numbers! Some are nodded to and, at that, exit the room. "May I approach?" she asks; the Waterbaron says, "Yes, and I'll approach you too" - they meet in the literal middle. There is a hand-on-shoulder greeting, Ilithylia apparently having studied something of customs in this area and mostly getting it right. Not a practiced diplomat, but clearly a fast study.

A few more niceties. It is explained that Yartar is indeed rather more busy and colourful right now as they have "arrived during one of our favourite festivals; you are seeing the city at its best". Ilithylia says they'd hoped there would be a courier, vanguard, to warn ahead; but it "appears something may have befallen them". (Yikes).

"I don't know if you're aware of this but there is a reasonably long history between the Kingdoms of the Dale Lands" (their general area) "more specifically the state of Sembia, and the old Kingdoms of the Desarin. I come with the full authority of the Senate of Sembia, to reestablish ties of old. For we believe now, more than ever, that the Kingdoms of Western Feyrun should seek to work in cooperation and unity. There have been too many threats that we all face alone and, united, we are stronger; we are safer; and we are better. We come - *I* come - with an open mind and open arms. We wish to share what we know and what we have learned and, in return, we hope to learn what you have and understand what you know."

As the Waterbaron is responding, there are two thoughts in Riglan's mind:

* The timing is suspicious. Are they trustworthy?
* If the timing is simply useful, should we engage with them about Azalin?

As he tunes back in - the Waterbaron is asking "...but please speak plainly; what has necessitated this?" - and realises she is thinking the same. Gifts, beautiful but vague values that are surely universal, but what do they really want? And Riglan wonders if she recalls our recent mention of the distant possible threat to the East, too.

Ilithylia: "Yes. Yes, I see I am talking a wise and perceptive woman; so yes, let's speak plainly. **There is trouble brewing in the East**. Those who are learned of such matters **think an ancient evil has returned**. We know not the exact nature of this thread, simply that *something* has emerged. We don't know; is it Thay? Is it..." (she lists a few other places) "...but it comes from East of us. We have spoken to Cormyr. They have never disarmed; they stand ready. We are not a militaristic state. We have focused most of our development and prosperity towards higher learning - development of art and culture. So, we rely on our allies."

Temo takes a moment where Ilithylia is breathing in (!) to Message the Waterbaron and simply says, "Uuuh, is now a good time to speak?!"

The Waterbaron says, "Ilithylia - yes. Have you brought advisors with you?" Ilithylia responds, "Well, I have my close confidants, who are as informed as this as I am." "Would you like to call them in, and I will call upon my advisors?" "Certainly! I had not presumed that you had the time to discuss this right away! I did not want to assume... But it appears that you are willing... Absolutely, I will bring them in!"

(Riglan's grinning ear to ear at Temo, having figured out what must've gone on)

As she goes to do that, the Waterbaron beckons at us to join her. Riglan whispers quietly, "Yes, quite the coincidence, isn't?"

Ilithylia returns, nods to us and introduces herself. We introduce ourselves back. "I have always as a young girl been fascinated by the cultures of the Far North. It gives me great joy to meet all of you and I hope, despite the circumstances, that we get to learn more about you and these lands with their deep history."

Riglan hopes to push past the smalltalk and says, "So..."

Ilithylia takes the hint! She takes out a notebook. "I don't want to get any of these facts wrong."

* It started in winter (no snow that far South though). They dismissed things initially.
* As spring came around, the farmers turning the soil discovered shallow graves of hastily-buried deformed animals. The council initially dismissed that too, as stories of countryfolk.
* But then came disappearances. It started to hit outskirts of cities further inland. Those towards the East.
* First, the firstborns in some small villages went missing.
* Then reports became too frightening to ignore. A "creeping death" was spreading out from somewhere. It wasn't constant and didn't hit everyone but where it did it, "it thoroughly".
* They've been trying to keep it quiet to avoid panic; scholars have been investigating; their conclusion so far, is an old evil has resurfaced.
* "It has aspects of the undead" and that's why they initially suspected Thay; opened diplomatic relations; Thay explicitly denied it and sages believed they were telling the truth.
* "And that's made this even more mysterious".

Riglan's kind of sick to his stomach. *Far* too close to a description of what we saw in the Shadowfell. He starts to tell the tale; he's not sure it's the same evil, but Ilithylia mentions their sages having found descriptions of similar things 5-6 centuries ago. It all matches up. When Riglan mentions Azalin's name, she's surprised and says this is Theskian for "Wizard King". At this, Riglan asks directly - "is Thesk a current kingdom in the East?" "It is. How to put this diplomatically... Both the only bulwark we have, but also somewhat a sacrificial border kingdom against the growing might of Thay. They are all that stands between Thay's Red Wizards and the rest of what you call the Eastern Empires." Riglan explains the rest; he's back, probably in old stomping grounds, might seek alliances with nearby undead strong partners (!) - Thay perhaps may be drawn in? - but most of all is looking for Netherese artefacts.

She explains that this would be why Rex's influence seems to spread West, as far as them; he could be following rumours to the Anauroch desert. Historians believe it wasn't always thus, and became such because this is where the Netherese empire fell. There are ruins out there, where such artefacts would live.

More information is exchanged. He asks how long their journey was; she seems reluctant to say at first; then decides to just let us know everything and reveals, 2 weeks. At this Temo realises - "The sail design - your boats can fly!" "Yes. Not high in the sky; we've not had that kind of magic since the fall of Netheril. But we can hover and glide swiftly. We call our ships Skimmers."

* They were only able to draw a pattern of events together because they're a coalition, spread over a wide area.
* The events also seem to show a slow spread towards the North-West; that heads to the Anauroch desert. But North-West of that, is North of the High Forest - and us. The Desarin valley.
* **We'd be next in line**. The destination of the scatter plot is quite a bit north of us, but Azalin might go through us to get there. We look at the map.
* **It's Deepgarden Keep.**

Riglan says, "Shit. They know where we live." Looks up, points at Deepgarden specifically and says, "He's coming here."

We wonder why; not Wave Echo Cave; Maireagh points out that the power there is a fraction of that of Netherese artefacts. And Nethza? Surely he doesn't care about the Shadowfell?

And then one of the advisors, who's heard about the lichdom, suggests that some beings are powerful enough to store part of their soul in a living person. They'd seek that if they were weakened, to rejoin and get back to full power... Not their phylactory; just another facet of their proven magical ability to move or split their soul. In a person... Given the right opportunity and access...

**...given Nethza.**

Temo just holds her hand, gripping it tightly. Ilithylia will return to her ship to try and get permission to share portal details. We ask if we can stay at the hall, out of the way, just to be able to be found easily; it's agreed and we're shown to staff quarters. The Waterbaron will use the Harper network to alert the Lord's Allaince.

Riglan suggests Temo use Sending to Sildar to warn him, but Temo reminds Riglan that Sildar is *already headed here* on horseback - slower than us. He'll probably arrive tomorrow or day after; too late, we'll be gone and the Waterbaron will fill him in anyway. Maireagh thinks Riglan should warn the Emerald Enclave; Druids will be able to spot corruption, if made aware, more easily. For sure. Especially near the High Forest. Oh my - Shadowtop Cathedral is in the North of the forest, closest to Azalin's projected path.

Riglan runs outside. He keeps running through the crowds until he's out the main gate and by the woods near the graveyard; he calls bird after bird, crows in fact, handing out every last worm or insect or other treat he has, showing his Emerald Enclave pin, asking them to seek others and warn them, giving brief details, specific focus to the High Forest.

Meanwhile, Temo wants to warn Qelline too. He's been reminded of Sending. "Ancient evil threatens Deepgarden Keep. Travel safely to Old Owlbear Tower. Seek assistance for refuge far from there with druid. All my love."

Then he looks Nethza straight in the eyes, takes a deep breath. "How do you feel?"

"I... Feel anxious. Worried. I feel like we're heading into something where we won't have time to stop and think and there'll be no turning back. But I also feel like after *days* of nothing but crumbs, we've been fed an absolute buffet. We no longer need to wait and wonder. And I'm not doing this alone - the four of us I mean are not alone - which is scary and confusing, but I dunno. Maybe it's just a false sense of security, but, we don't need to have all the answers."

"The soul thing. That's not you, right? That's just, maybe, stored. Or maybe not even stored, maybe they're wrong about it. But it's not *you*."

"I haven't had time to think about that. Either way, he can't have whatever he wants, whether it's true or not. I would sooner die than give him back his full power."

"We'll see it doesn't come to that."

"If my death has the power to stop him - to stop this *monster* from achieving his final purpose - that is a worthy sacrifice."

Temo leans closer. **"We'll see it doesn't come to that."**

(Riglan arrives back around now)

"It was bad enough when we could see his influence throughout that land. But the thought of it spreading unchecked through the entire of *this* world? That is unthinkable. It simply can't be allowed to happen. The Dark Powers have never let that happen..."

Riglan says, "We'll see it doesn't come to that", unwittingly parroting Temo but for a different reason.

Maireagh asks for help. She's laid a whole lot of equipment out. "I need to figure out exactly what effect (spell) is going to be most useful for us to have at the ready, always, and in ample supply. Is it healing? Is it the ability to see invisible things? Is it invisibility... It could be anything! Sticky strands? Blurring, mirroring yourself...?" and she has her book of designs open. It's how she's coping.

Riglan thinks a while and in the end suggests that, maybe, something that can help us fall under sway - be influenced. That seems a likely method of attack against us.

Temo, Sending, Ushien. "Emissaries from East are in Yartar. Threat confirmed. We will see you again in the lands of your forefather. Ride swiftly!"

### 6pm

All we can do is wait and fret. Dinner time comes around. We venture out to see what the food situation is; we can go out into town but the point was to be here, to be found. Temo asks a passing staff member; 25 persuasion via Reliable Talent; they point us to a kitchen which we can look at. There isn't "staff food" or any kind of dinner or whatever. Riglan suggests that we have plenty we can cook of our food but it's safer to heat things in a kitchen so we head there (and Riglan leaves a note on the bed to say where we've gone).

In the kitchen we make food using our own rations. It's not happened for a while. It's a moment of introspection and reflection. Riglan struggles with the latent guilt of being at least in part responsible for Azalin's arrival; and the closeness to home of Nethza and a threat to places like Shadowtop or, even worse, Deepgarden.

We chat while we eat. Nethza asks if we have wine. We dig around in various bags. In horror, we realise - no! No ale, no wine. Nethza suggests Temo run over to the market. He faux bows, "Anything for you, m'lady!" and runs off.

There's the Waterwell but it's expensive, thinks Temo, and what about something a bit more robust for the journey? Investigating the market (11+14->25) he finds a small, local vitner with various wines! They have stall here. Temo gets chatting. He's from the South-East and doesn't normally have a stall in town, selling to trade; it's a few days away. That's why we've not seen the name before.

On recommendation, Temo gets one bottle of rosé for now - 1gp - and four bottles of red for the journey, as it'll handle hot weather better. 2gp each for that. 9gp in all. Perhaps a deal could be struck, especially if we bought a sixth bottle? Persuasion 25; a bottle of a small sweet sort of dessert wine is added. Temo thanks him and pays the 9gp then, bottles packed in a box, makes his way with the heavy payload back to the hall. He doesn't know if it's any good, but the whole thing cost less than a single bottle of Elven wine. It's a good compromise between Nethza and Maireagh's tastes too.

On arrival at the kitchen, there's surprise at the number of bottles; he explains and produces the Rosé. "This is for now!" It's good, actually. Might not hit the highs of an Elven bottle, but it's unbeatable at the price. We clean up and head back to the room.

### 10pm

Hours pass. Still no news. A bit worrying. Riglan says "I hate bothering the Waterbaron, but she's used to us annoying her by now!" - and we go to enquire. She's not changed, had a simple meal by the looks of it. She's feeling a bit helpless; hasn't heard anything, and is feeling a bit helpless. Suggests we take them some kind of gifts as a pretext to asking, but wants to stay in the Hall just in case. We refuse money, but she gives us a bottle of aged ale that is from nearby but not found in town to get started.

We head to the market, meeting some kind of decorative basket for presentation and a variety of local foods and maybe trinkets. Temo is easily able to handle that and runs around from stall to stall gathering together what amounts to a hamper. It only comes to something like 5gp. We head to the dock. Riglan carries the hamper, his staff tucked in at an angle between his body and backpack.

The Grand Dame is out, but the four boats are there; afloat, slightly off shore. Temo asks Riglan if remembers which one Ilithylia came from. Riglan, perception nat 20 + 10; he's looking for marks or ordering to identify the boats, when he notices a shadow and ripples in the water. He sees - something. Someone. Climbing up the side of the boat. The same on two other boats. A body falls from one into the water! Riglan calls a warning to his crew, points at Ilithylia's boat - Temo tries to point at it, casts Message, "You are being boarded by assassins, protect yourself!" and says "We need to get to those boats, or fly to attack people or something!"

Maireagh and Nethza say they can fly. Riglan conjures creatures, trying to cast for creatures of flight at a fairly high level, expecting two; one for him, one for Temo and the dog. If we need to move between boats that's useful. Two giant eagles! Awesome.

Temo jumps on the back of one, which grabs the dog in claws. Riglan jumps astride another. We head for Ilithylia's boat directly, at great speed. Ilithylia's message response is, "What? Who is this - wait - we're under attack!". Sigh.

It looks like slimy, wet,*drowned people* have crawled up the side of the ship like spiders. Temo grabs his wand of pyrotechnics and fires it over the other three ships, hoping that will get the attention of a lot of crew and they'll notice their assailants. The light flickering on the decks show at least two slain guards. On our target boat the guard is in the moment of being killed as we're halfway across. Riglan tries Healing Word at distance, *just* in range, hoping to help the stricken fellow avoid death.

We can see that others have snuck below. We reach the ship, we're put down, Riglan commands the eagles - "Patrol the skies. If you see *any* of those creatures, attack them immediately!"

We run below, Riglan calling, "Run towards the sounds of battle!". Initiative!

* Temo 18
* Nethza 14
* Eagles 13
* Riglan 12
* Maireagh 9

Below decks (first initiative) we hear a scream as someone is attacked. Something is speaking, probably Undercommon. "Behind us councillor!" then "Get back, you foul dead thing!"

With a Luck point, Temo fires at and hits one of 3 undead below who is in combat; the councillor, handmaidens and two guards backed into a corner, two more dead. He deals a whopping 12+28->40 damage to it, but it's still up! The arrow sinks deep into the rotting, necrotic flesh of the creature; simultaneously, all three of them turn their heads to look at Temo. He shouts up "Big hits don't hurt them and they seem to have a hive mind; there may be someone in control; none of the good guys have weapons!"

The one of the two guards who was *not* in melee runs forward to tackle a nearby undead. He attacks in a strange way - moves *very* swiftly - and throws his hands out, his sleeves flying up his arms and there's a sort of series of roundhouse kick followed by two chops. It's a martial arts attack of a kind, but unarmed - none of them have weapons. Interestingly, when this one gets injured, the others do *not* react. Magical damage vs regular? Amount of damage? Dunno.

The other guard calls, "Advance no further you foul undead!" and tries his own repeated attack on the assailant Temo just hit. He seems to gather all of his effort into one very powerful strike. This hits, and that *does* get the attention of the other two. Temo calls "Big hits get their attention, small don't..." - but the guard is hurt himself where he hit, his hand freezing! - "...and if you hit them by hand they hurt you with cold! These things suck!" That said, it does seem to have an impact; all *three* seem somewhat set back by whatever happened.

The one that got hit, Temo notices, look different; two look similar with similar daggers and hand crossbows, but the one just hit looks larger and less nimble; it wields greatsword; its wet footsteps look almost like black squid ink, but the others do not leave such marks. When it was hit it seemed stunned and still does; the other two reacted similarly but only briefly.

Nethza flies in. Assesses things. Temo shouts, "Big one. THE BIG ONE!"

As a bonus action she puts the Hex Blade Curse on the big one. She draws her sword, touches her amulet and strange magical copies of the sword issue forth as three Eldritch Blasts - and all three hit decisively. 1d10+5 each +5 again for the curse -> 12+5, 10+5, 6+5 -> 43 total damage. *That* makes a difference. Temo sees the others react. "See? They react when the big one's hit!"

Riglan jumps down. "**Praise Amaunator!**" shouts Ilithylia - "They will not take us down, our allies have arrived!". Lines up two of them; one big one small; lightning bolt. The big one fails, 26 damage, little one takes 13. He drops in the bear totem and *all* allies are in range, gaining 19 temp HP and this seems to bolster everyone's resolve too. The bolt rips a hole in the ship though - Riglan shouts "Sorry!"

Ilithylia reaches into her pocket and pulls out a bead, throws it on the ground and, boom, a sphere of force appears, surrounding her and her two nearby handmaidens. They've even pulled one of the fallen soldiers into the globe and Ilithylia starts to tend to them, perhaps hoping to stabilise or even revivify if necessary.

Appearing from the shadows, slinking down from above and dropping onto deck between Nethza and Riglan, is a strange female creature who pulls a wickedly long shade blade from - somewhere! - and strikes twice. She attacks Nethza, hitting for the first and would hit on the second, but Temo tries Silvery Barbs; it's not enough and the second attack still hits; at least Nethza is bolstered with advantage for her retaliation, if she is still up. 7 piercing + 10 necrotic and 8 piercing + 10 necrotic; Nethza then seems to crumble somehow, as if she's being sapped of strength! **In mechanics terms her strength stat has plummeted to just three**.

Temo shouts to Riglan, "We've got to avoid being hit by that and help Nethza" and Riglan shouts back, "Yes I *know*!"

The shadow suddenly disappears into Nethza's shadow; it is effectively invisible. Temo and Riglan don't roll high enough perception to see it.

Maireagh is on her way down; "What's going on down there?" and Riglan calls back, "We're getting fucked up!" and as she lands Riglan calls, "There's a shadow hiding, it's *really bad*! It was between me and Nethza!" Maireagh tries perception; nope. She tries casting Faerie Fire into the whole area. It's a good notion; and happily the shadow fails its save and is illuminated; we see it is standing behind Nethza. The two smaller injured undead glow too. As a bonus action she calls for the dog to attack the shadow, but it can't hit (two nat 1s!).

The two handmaidens continue trying to treat wounds and help vocally if they can, but they're stuck inside the sphere. The injured smaller undead runs alongside the big one, can't attack the handmaiden nearby because of that same sphere; it goes for the guard - and very unfortunately hits once and crits once. First attack alone is significant; 5 piercing + 11 poison; avoids being poisoned; the crit is a horrifying 9 piercing + 20 poison and it fails con save. The guard falls, a strange blue rot upon it. The body starts to be covered in spreading ice!

The as-yet uninjured undead goes for the other guard, hitting once; for 5 + 9 poison, but the guard doesn't succumb to the rot. That's within the bear totem temp HP.

**The big one turns to look at Riglan;** and at this, the other two do too. He seems to be the focus of their attention. The big one advances to within about 15ft; suddenly, strange pieces of flesh peel off it like tentacles and a bizarre cloud of ink is injected into the air, creating a kind of shadow. DC15 con save for Riglan, Maireagh and the dog; Riglan only gets 13, Maireagh calling for him to "hold your shield up you oaf!" -> +5 -> 18; Maireagh herself just saves; the dog though can't resist the effect. It takes 27 necrotic damage and is blinded but is immune to the disease it would've taken; Riglan and Maireagh take half (13). We're not blinded. Riglan holds his creatures spell.

A tentacle is thrown at Riglan and matches AC to hit; another 10 necrotic damage, con save 15, so no HP max reduction. It attacks again, swinging the greatsword; Riglan just dodges. Riglan has to react and use the cloak to hold his spell.

Temo fires at the shadow. He just hits, doing a rather average 32 damage. It's *something* but it's still a serious threat. This creature is *close* - melee seems likely and he has a hand free - he casts Shadow Blade as a bonus action. At this range, he decides it's a better bet than the crossbow and stows it and then, for good measure, being brave and foolish in equal parts, advances behind the shadow to flank it with Nethza. The advantage isn't needed as long as the creature is illuminated by Maireagh's magic, but he thinks he might be able to get a couple of hits on it if he's still up and it gives the shadow another close target.

The bodyguard attacks the undead assassin again with another flurry of blows. The assassin looks very rough - still up but close to the edge.

Nethza's sword weighs nothing; it's entirely magical; despite such low strength, on willpower alone and drawing on her bond - she calls out (and we've never seen this before) - "**Mother of Ravens, lend me your strength and send this foul being back where it was born!**" - she stands back up, raises the sword and with her bonus action before, she casts Banishing Smite - then swings at the creature, with advantage. **CRIT!** A rift opens *and the shadow is pulled away*. If anyone who'd seen Nethza vanish into the Shadowfell saw this, they'd see something very familiar.

Nethza spins around and goes for the assassin recently hit by the bodyguard. Advantage again thanks to Maireagh. Hits for 8 damage.

Riglan channels his Primal Savagery. He rends at the creature, hitting for 16 damage. He takes 5 cold damage in return. He also tries to cast Healing Word on the downed guard in the corner, just in case it works; maximum power on that, 9 healing - if it worked!

Ilithylia seems to be trying to purge poison from the guard on the ground inside the bubble who is convulsing and spitting up bile - purging it - that seems to work. Riglan sees it and surmises that Lesser Restoration is probably needed to truly heal these people.

Maireagh's turn. She goes for the big guy Riglan just hit. Hits! The creature falls; and Nethza recovers some hit points as a result of the hex she held on it. Maireagh now throws her hammer with advantage at the illuminated guard, hitting thanks to the advantage for 16 damage. The other one tries to head to Riglan and this gives an opportunity for the other guard, who hits and takes it down.

There's the one left, near the handmaidens - and at that bad timing market, the globe falters and fails. Temo advances and throws the magical sword, hitting but it's a low roll of only 28. The creature is *still* up. The remaining bodyguard runs up and tries to attack; hits twice; *that's* enough. The creature falls.

Riglan doesn't say anything and just runs up immediately to the fallen guard, hands on, Lesser Restoration. Ilithylia comes over to thank us and Riglan says "We need to get to the other ships!" as we all run onto the upper deck. She shouts to the guards below, "Stay with the ship!" and she starts healing the poisoned guard up there which Riglan had tried to stabilise. The two handmaidens jump off the ship and *run over the water* to one alongside. Riglan calls the eagles; they've managed to defeat things - all ships cleared but several are down. Riglan asks to be taken to the first ship with people down.

Over time, we use a fair bit of magic to help injured and poisoned. Three are lost - it's been too long for Revivify for two and another was decapitated. Others may be injured, but will recover. We help all we can over the next 10-20 minutes before eventually meeting back up with Ilithylia. City guards have arrived on boats to offer help; pleading for them to come into town, the Waterbaron is there offering secure shelter on land.

With Maireagh's help, Temo's investigation check of 29 of the remaining people yields *something*. The armour and remnants of clothing give the distinct impression that these creatures have *travelled* here. Yartar investigators concur; nothing of what they wear is local. It's targeted. Riglan says, "Azalin probably knew you were coming to warn people" - but that said, Ilithylia's crew don't recognise the clothing either. She will get her advisors to study them though.

"Tonight was the first night we were ever on water. We considered resting in another lake along the way and considered sailing from upriver to Yartar, but it was faster to skim over land even though there was a risk of being seen travelling in that unusual fashion."

"So this could be the first opportunity these things could've had. But there is a question of how they got here; they're not local, but not fast either."

The advisors study the uniforms. "They're not from our part of the world either. These are from the Southern Kingdoms... The coast maybe..." - he names an old name for Daggerford. Riglan looks startled. "A coincidence perhaps but we met another Shadowfell traveller who was from Daggerford of a century or two ago..." "Ah, no, the ancient name - it fell nearly a millennia ago. This is *very* foul magic that has preserved these as Drowned. They're known as that. Kept undead by a desire for revenge. Cut down before their time in battle with much seething hatred for those who defeated them. But those people are long gone from this world, so their hatred is undirected and they cannot be released."

A very ancient magic, then, that would give someone control over the Drowned. Not known to people in "this day and age". Older than Azalin, probably. A magic dating from before the Pact Of The Dales.

A handmaiden pipes up. "I noticed something very unusual. Their leader had tentacles and octopus like ink" Riglan nods. He was at the receiving end! The advisors nod. Worth looking into. Very unusual. Riglan says, "We are supposed to travel to Silverymoon for arcane library access, we hope, tomorrow at sunset." Ilithylia says, "Ah! This is what I promised you... Who shall I give this to?" and has runes for the teleportation circle. Nethza takes the scroll and says, "Young warrior. Please guard this and keep it safe. It is a state secret of sorts!" 

They need to rest, but elect to repair their ships in the morning and head back to Sembia in the morning. It'll take two weeks. They'd hoped to travel further West to entreat with other cities but the Waterbaron describes the Lord's Alliance and says that "when you entreat with one, you entreat with all". Ilithylia is happy to hear this; she'd been advised that there was a belief of something like that, and the advice to go to Yartar first - as a nearby port of call - was indeed sound.

Security etc. is being arranged, but at this point Riglan - himself tired from expending so much magic in such a short time - suddenly notices how Nethza is barely standing. "Nethza! Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry..." and rushes over. He casts Greater Restoration, restoring her strength. She gives him a hug back. He sees a fire and confidence in her, and is surprised, but says, "Raven Queen, huh?" and she says, "Yes. She is on my side. She responded instantly to my call and pulled that shadow away into her realm. I would hate to know what she has done to it." Riglan chuckles.

Temo says, "Well, I don't know about you, but I've had enough boats for one night... If there's nothing we can do to help here, we'd better find somewhere to sleep - the griffon lodging is expired so unless we're lucky, we might have to camp, but I can do the Hut so we'll be safe." "If you don't mind putting bedrolls out, everyone's sleeping under guard in the Great Hall and might appreciate company?" suggests Ilithylia, so that's decided.

As we're seeing up the beds, someone comes and sheepishly asks for the "tall druid". It's a middle-aged ruin. She says "I saw you dropped this on the docks earlier and wondered if you wanted it back?" - she hands him the hamper. "Oh! Thank you. I forgot completely" - he thanks her and hands her a gold piece, but she refuses. After pleasantries are exchanged, Riglan goes over. He says, "Well, we were coming over to offer you this, as a small version of what you offered us..."

She almost seems embarrassed but eventually explains, "It's the small acts of civilisation are what make civilisation great. This act of courtesy and kindness is the very reason why we are alive. You thinking to bring this to us. This was the only reason you were there. I cannot thank Amaunator enough!" (We learn that Amaunator is goddess of the sun and knowledge). Riglan asks, "do your people drink alcohol?" "Yes! It is one of more important items of trade."

Temo moves to the middle of the hall, minor illusion, "Roll up roll up! Try some of the local red wine of this fine city. Made by a craftsman just a few days away" - and we break open all the bottles for everyone, including the sweet wine. Fresh food is shared. Bonds have been forged through battle and assistance; mutual survival.

We are witnessing the birth of a *real* new alliance.

Riglan mutters under his breath, "So, Clara. If Cinta sees this in the cards - *this* is what hope looks like". He hopes the Vistani survived.

"Whoever sent it, whatever they were trying to archive, I'm sure that this alliance just forged in the fires of battle is the *last* thing they wanted to happen" says the Waterbaron, raising a glass. Riglan raises one back.

Inspiration all round.

(The chapter concludes).

## Day 27, mid-spring, after equinox

Waterbaron **Nestra** is the first to wake. Her movement stirs Riglan, who sees her doing rounds, checking people are fine and offering Shipwrights to help fix the hole that Riglan put in the side of Ilithylia's boat! We start to pack up. She comes over.

"Crazy day yesterday...! I am at a loss as to how to thank you, but I fear that I - *we* - will need more from you yet."

Riglan says, "You don't need to thank us - this is our home-from-home, so you could consider our actions selfish! We have many friends here."

"I've not forgotten that you are amongst my 'landed folk', for you are vested in the running of an estate within the reaches of Yartar."

"Ah, yes. We're having to arrange for evacuation of that, so it'll be unoccupied for some time."

"I'm sorry to hear that..."

"Well, we hope it will be temporary!"

"Well, as a vassal of Yartar you are of course entitled to our military in defence of Old Owlbear Tower but I hope to appeal to your better nature that we not stretch our resources at this time."

Temo pipes up, "We wouldn't dream of taking soldiers or risking lives. Precious though the tower is, it's just a building. Lives are more important and there are far more at Deepgarden Keep who cannot move."

After some smalltalk, Nestra mentions that if it's not an inconvenience, she'd like to see us before we leave for Silvermoon. She's cooking something up but it's not quite ready yet. Of course, we agree.

Before we go, Nestra turns to Maireagh. "Please do not be offended by this question, but would you still have any connections amongst the descendants of the **Dulzoun**?" (The great North kingdom of the dwarves). "Ah, sadly not, no; I am not of such noble blood." "Well, it was just a shot in the dark! I think we'll need someone with at least *some* claim, if my understanding of Dwarven politics and protocol is still current, to bring the great Dwarven holds onboard. That will be difficult."

Maireagh explains that family names which sound like trades or objects - such as hers, "Silveraxe" - tends to indicate a descent of common folk, with ancestry probably not traced but considered not noble.

Once outside, Riglan sees if he can find a quiet space to call some wolves. It's still too busy in town for that, there's just nowhere, so he asks if everyone is OK going to the cemetery. As we walk, we overhear gossip - news has spread of the attack. This is a reminder. We discuss issues with what happened to Nethza. A new kind of enemy. We are ill-prepared. She and Temo can probably function at such low strength, but Maireagh or Riglan would be screwed.

We reach the graveyard; Riglan's swapped a summon spell; he calls a few wolves from Deepgarden Keep. As he does this, he wildshapes to a large alpha wolf himself - easier to speak.

Riglan, to wolves: "A danger approaches your home, from afar. We do not know when it will strike, but a creeping sickness will move across the land. All that grows and lives will fall under its sway. It cannot be hunted or slain. You must protect yourselves *and your cubs* for they are the most vulnerable. Our Keep will soon be evacuated. Once the people are gone, keep watch. Use all your senses. Watch for change. It is safe if there is no sign of sickness in the land or animals. If this changes, at the first signs of anything wrong, you MUST run strong and fast to the South or East, whichever way seems safer for you."

The will pass the message. It might be several months, but we know that there might be a way to go faster.

Given this, Temo, Sending to Qelline: "Sorry to frighten you. Danger approaches. Could be months, or less. Consult Keep druid, consider evacuation South or East. We've found strong allies. We'll prevail!"

**This time, Qelline replies. "We are prepared. Have been for a long time. On the road to distant family. Headed for Neverwinter."**

He relays it. Riglan smiles - "Always wanted to go there!" and more seriously - "She's strong. She'll be fine. We'll make sure Sildar does something to look after the farm and make sure it's not taken by someone else in her absence."

We return to town and head to the Archives. Our researcher friend Lanowin *has* completed detailed research on the Seer. "I did find *something*; it's loose, but possible. There are reports of two seers linked to deserts in modern times." He pulls out various papers and books from a cabinet; the results of the research. "There's an ancient tale of a magical place which is on the edge of 'dead lands', which could obviously be read as a desert, though it is possible that it means something else and is not near a desert. In this case, my extended research lines up with a suggestion of dead lands East of the Serpent Hills, in the old kingdom of the - well, there are ruins of ancient civilisations there. We have a name - there was a king, who ran a kingdom, a powerful oracle (the local dialect word for a seer)." (And he gives the name - see Gnog's party!)

"That doesn't align, then, with your query. Only one other reference does and then only vaguely. A prophet seer of **Savras**, a God of Fate And Futures. The only thing that makes me think it might be of interest is this missive here, but this is from a while ago and whether this seer still lives is dubious... This is from 50 years ago, where it was said that a 'young oracle was claimed by the temple of Savras to be the reincarnation of the Prophetess'. I don't know her name, but she *is* female. These are her initials on a letter - **V.S.** - this *could* be who you seek. Unfortunately, the only evidence I have is that there's a family, who is linked to this temple, but there have been no recent records from or of them. The name is **Sarnastum**. They are from further East, for that naming convention is more typical of Cormyr."

Lanowin produces a family tree. "Apparently about 70 years ago - now keep in mind that these records are very fragmented as very little survived the Cormyrin / New Netharil war - there is a scion of the Sarnastum family whose name was **Valinus**. Valinus Sarnastum certainly matches 'V.S.' on that other letter, but there are no other mentions of this person as a record of note. At least I do have a location for you! There is a secluded retreat for Savras on the Southern edge of the Anauroch Desert. It sounds like it's actually within the desert itself - very few know of it - it is not a place of pilgrimage. These worshippers of Savras apparently believe that isolation allows them to have clearer visions."

He hands us a roughly-drawn map. It narrows things down to within a 100 mile area. He also hands us copies of relevant passages and drawings from a travelling caravan, near death, headed for the Sea Of Fallen Stars (The Vast and the Forests of Cormanthor) but became lost crossing the southern Anauroch and would've perished had they not stumbled across this place. That's what they drew. The building is crazy looking! A cube that seems to stand on a *corner*.

We thank him; it's an excellent lead, and we can investigate more in the East, at least it's a place to start. Riglan flips him an extra gold coin - "It's festival time, go have fun! Thank you *very* much."

This adds to the Silverymoon list - protection from shadows, a better map. (We know Eskilindrar's has none, because we already tried to find some there the other day).

We head outside. Mid morning. Lively. Temo looks to Riglan; "You used that back-from-the-dead thing yesterday. The one that needs doing quickly..." "Revivify?" "Yes. But... Well, look, that shadow - if you go down, who else can do that? I can't. I don't understand it." Maireagh says she can do it too, using an artefact she built. That's a relief. We have some options. Riglan says, "And we know that very powerful clerics, if we can find them, who can even I'm told revive after a few *days*, though apparently it's not a pleasant process."

Clearly, we should never seek to die. But in combat, neither should be paralysed with emotion if one of us should fall.

### Mid-afternoon

We take advantage of the brief moment of calm to enjoy the lively town, before we have to leave on our long journey. We top up fresh and stored rations as we'll be in the desert. We stop to watch a play being staged in the market; a grand, live performance that involves audience participation. There are elements of comedy, drama and it's really quite good. After applause, things go back quickly to a market "feel" without fuss. It all just feels kind of easy, and enjoyable.

A young man comes over and approaches us. No special clothing. Ah! A performer; Temo realises; Temo says "Hello friend, an enjoyable performance." "Temorah be with you!" Temo 19+1->20 insight. He realises there is coded language, then recognises a pin on the guy's short cape; not Emerald Enclave. So he says, "I don't recognise the pin, but public space permitting, speak plainly." "Really?! You don't recognise the pin? Are you not Temo Smoothhands?" Temo, confused - "Yes! I am!" "You have been a good patron of the Happy Hall, have you not?" Temo says, "From time to time, though perhaps less than I should." "Do you not recognise my pin from chief ministrant there?" Temo chuckles and says, "Apologies, I did not realise your - order? - used such a thing, but did not know to look for it." "Well not to harp on about it..." - and Temo goes, "Aaaaah! I see." (Harper reference not too subtle!) - "...but we an order of loose tongues."

He continues, "My name is **Mathan**. I sense Temorah's blessings upon you; I sense that they are bountiful. You are protected by her." Temo thinks about that sideways for a bit - "Well, I have this" - an taps his luck stone pendant - "and do seem to err on the side of lucky more than most around me." "Yes! You seem to display remarkable luck." "Have you been watching me?!" "No. But our order has. In fact, you may be one of Temorah's favourites, I would say." He smiles. Not in a creepy way! "I have been told that you have dodged death many a time." "True, but always with aid of my friends here." "Yes, yes; although sometimes we operate alone we always return to the shelter and strength of our community... Now. I'm sure it comes as no surprise to you that we are aware of what is going on and your part in trying to put it right. Perhaps even some sense of your part in it." Temo says, "Well - admittedly, we are not blameless." "That is not what this is about. We need eyes and ears. We have very few where you are going." "So this is a recruitment speech?" "Would you like to visit Temorah for a bit before you go?" Riglan chips in - "We're free now!" - "I'll see you there then" and he heads off, catching up with his troupe.

Riglan goes down to one knee to be more at eye level. He taps his Emerald Enclave pin. "Things like this can weight heavy. But the honour counters the weight. You should consider carefully, but I would encourage you to consider in their favour."

Maireagh adds, "Well... The Waterbarons is on the way... We did promise Nestra we'd see her before we left this evening."

Riglan looks at the sun - it's later than he realised - maybe two hours. "OK. Let's go see Nestra, then Happy Hall."

It's *busy* at the Hall. The area has been mobilised; it seems there is a gala this evening, always hosted at the Waterbaron's Tower, we're told. Nestra greets us. "Everything seems fine with the Sembians. I trust your efforts at the archive bore fruit?" "It was helpful" "That's good. You're headed to Silverymoon I understand. Will you indulge me - come to my office briefly?" "Of course"

On the way up, she says to someone passing, "Please prepare the crates we spoke of" "They're already in your waiting room" is the response.

Up there, we find three nice-looking crates with Yartar Trade And Customs markings. "One is for you. And..." (points) "...these two, if you would not mind, please - this is a crate of our wine, for Silverymoon. And this here is something a little bit more, umm, confidential, to go to a specific person there. I was wondering if you would mind please seeking him out?" Then she produces a scroll. "If you could find the time while you are in Silverymoon - please - this is for a person of great importance. His name is **Taern Hornblade** but I think he sometimes goes by the somewhat whimsical name of **Thunderspells**. He is the High Mage of Silverymoon; not an easy person to reach, but this scroll and seal and this..." (hands us a letter) "...letter of introduction should do the trick. There's one more thing... Not required... But..." and she produces a clothing pin. "We are indebted to you. We understand that as landed gentry, I am within my power to offer you this, if you see aligned with your interests to be a representative of the Lord's Alliance. It does come with many responsibilities, an exclusive membership; we would need to know that, should you choose to accept, you would have the Lord's Alliances interest as your sole and primary concern."

Riglan thinks and says, "While I align with the Lord's Alliance, in my personal case the Emerald Enclavecomes first". Temo says, "I might be getting involved with the Harpers... Btu... Neither of us  clowns are as wise as Nethza or Mairegh?" Maireagh says "I wish to remain unaligned. I align only with knowledge. Nethza answers, "I could not in good conscience agree because my loyalties I fear are needed elsewhere. I believe I am, in a sense, a sbject of the Mother Of Ravens and her interests would have to be considered."

At that Temo clears his throat and says, "Well, I don't know how the Harpers and Lord's Alliance interact, but you did get to me first. And I do consider my future home to be Deepgarden Keep." So she puts it in his hand. "Well, if you choose to, Smoothhands, you may keep this. But if not, please leave this in that bag by my door. There will be no offence. I understand the complexity of what you go through. We do not offer this lightly. And therefore we do not expect a decision to be taken lightly. So take your time, what little there is, to think! Our relationship will suffer none should you refuse."

Temo shakes his head. "I understand my existing responsibilities. And I understand my past. And I have - *we* Have struggled with our wealth. With its escalation, with how or if we should share it. In my past, I might even hate what I am. With *this*, there is perhaps a way to effect change at a higher level. A way to be inside a system I previously viewed as impenetrable. I cannot refuse that opportunity, even if by my own failings I do not manage to make the best of it."

He takes the pin and clips it to his clothes.

"You understand this binds you to the law of the land?" and chuckles. Temo says, "All I can say is, I'll do my best!" - and she takes the Letter of Recommendation and tears it up! "You won't need this now." It seems she was confident that *one* of us would say "yes" because she produces a new letter, this one not sealed. "This is a letter of introduction from the Lord's Alliance with me as the representative of Yartar that recognises you as a Speaker of Yartar." "Very good" says Temo. "I'm quite good in cities; I'm sure we'll be able to find who we need to find".

She practically whispers, "good luck".

We need a cart. She looks to Temo, "Well, you could exercise your newfound powers!" and he raises his hand; "I hereby requisition a cart and horse for the next hour or two!" - but he needs to talk to admin staff for that, of course. As long as he has the pin, he's good.

Riglan is able to carry the wine case and the one for Thunderspells which has "Fragile! Do not shake! Keep away from magical fields!" is written on it, so Maireagh isn't confident carrying that. Maireagh takes "our" case but we're told we can go to a neighbouring room if we want to transfer the contents. We do that, bidding farewell for the last time - for now.

We open the case. Resting on top, a note above a pile of clothes. Riglan starts to read it. First word. "Temo." Riglan gets as far as reading that out, and Temo goes, "Dammit, she's so sneaky! And a good politician. How did she know?!" Maireagh says, "I don't think she did but she's a gambling woman and she knew her hand and perhaps yours to some degree."

There's a beautiful, luxurious looking set of clothes. These are far beyond anything we've had before. Noble. A hat, off-shoulder cape trimmed in fur (which is itself beautiful woven white with black dots), with a gold chain to hold it, a ceremonial-looking rapier, a belt with a gold buckle, and pair of beautiful looking boots. A velvet jacket too. It has the look of Firelast's all over it, but it's some of their best work. It is fitted for Temo already - they have his measurements from before of course.

Temo looks at it and steps back a bit shocked. "I can't - can I? I'm no lord, I'm noble and I never want to be!"

"It's for formal occasions I think..." and Riglan continues reading he note. "For the performance of state functions" it says. "So you look and feel the part. You want to effect change? It's stupid but clothes seem to matter to many of these people."

Riglan frowns at Temo. "Struggle not with conscience. You do this for the right reasons with a pure heart. And do not be afraid; you are braver than that. Change comes to us all. This change is exceptional, and gives you powers well beyond those of magic or weaponry. You just have to learn how to wield those powers."

Nethza is already unfurling the clothes and examining them. "These are *great!*"

We don't have time to try them now, but Temo packs them carefully in his own pack. He's quiet, but Riglan knows him well and suspects a quiet pride. Nethza giggles as she finds lower down in the chest, two folded silk hankerchiefs with "T.S." embroidered. Temo says, "NO. No. That's too much. I'll give those to Qelline, she won't stop laughing for a week!"

Below that is even more stuff.

* Six bottles of "the good wine". Riglan says, "Well, bag of holding, I mean, these are for *us* right?!".
* There's a thin book on affairs of state and etiquette (Temo groans, "Well if I'm having trouble sleeping...") - it has names of important current figures and heads of state; a political structure of the Sword Coast.
* There's a book on the history of Yartar. 
* There's a beautiful wooden box of what seems to be chocolates; local dried fruit and nuts, coated in confectionary. Temo's eyes widen. "That's more like it!"
* A beautiful hand-made Lute. Temo thinks for moment, then carefully takes his old busker's lute from his haversack. He stows it in Maireagh's bag, *very* carefully. He equally carefully puts the new lute in the haversack. Doesn't say a word.
* Another ornate box. Various coins are inside it - not local. Riglan picks up one and looks confused. "Huh? Gold? What's the point?" and Temo gets one, says, "Maybe they don't like Sword Coast gold in the East or something? These are from other places and I remember Waterdeep - they had weird names for things, like dragons and stuff, and that had to weigh everything. Wait! That's one, there. That's Waterdeep. So this is currency for certain cities. Just in case, I suppose?" Maireagh appraises it quickly, then whistles softly - "wow, there's about 1000 gold worth in here!"

Riglan - "next thing for you Temo - Harpers!" Onward, then, to Happy Hall. (We don't know yet that you can't be a Harper *and* a Lord's Alliance member).

Mathan is there. He sees Temo's pin and looks disappointed. Then perks up. "Ah, well, I see we were too late and too softly-softly." Temo says "Oh! I didn't know. I thought, both was OK?" "Well, no, because you really can't be divided in your loyalties, really. And I wouldn't jeopardise your position or status with the things that the Harpers ask for. They are often outside of the law." Temo says, "Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know; but in fairness, I suppose Qelline - a friend of mine - wouldn't be too happy if I'd stopped adventuring only to find a new way to keep doing it." Riglan pipes up, points at *his* pin and says, "I've no intention of stopping any time soon, but I suppose this is a conflict too?" "Yes, it kind of is. But that is no matter at all. You can, however, if you find it in yourself, do us a favour!" He hands us a stack of papers. Ten. Colourful. "Would it be too much to ask that you keep us appraised of any particular alarming developments while on your journeys? I would never ask for you to do this in a way which betrays your loyalties or the trust of those who are in your alliances. The Harpers do often find themselves aligned with those from the Lord's Alliance and the Emerald Enclave, although we rarely see eye-to-eye entirely. Our methods are not your methods." Temo recognises 10 paper birds.

Maireagh says, "That's fine. I can do that."

Riglan says, "This pin of mine, it doesn't bind me to a methodology. That's not quite how the enclave works. And in any case, I'm my own person. While my organisation is spread widely within nature, yours is spread widely amongst the worlds of men - the cities. As such, sharing information between the two organisations seems profoundly useful and important. While Temo might be bound to certain alignments or courses of action now, I can act freely, as can Maireagh. You can rely upon us. We might not be Harpers in name, but we can be Harpers in nature."

He answers, "If you find yourself in a bind with something outside the law? Here." He hands us a slip of paper with a name. "**Corunna Velaska**". He explains, "This is our only agent in Silverymoon... If you need anything there! We have no-one in Sembia. Once you get *there*, you're on your own."

The usual thanks and departures. Big steps, today. We head early to the Silverymoon meeting point and take a moment, as the sun starts heads to the horizon.

As we stand waiting for the Silverymoon contingent, Riglan looks to the group, then to Temo, and draws a deep breath, as he's been thinking of what to say for quite some time and thinks he just about has it sorted out now.

"So... I am the youngest of us, relatively. Yartar to me was a metropolis; I couldn't even deal with it at first - 100 years in my small corner of the forest with my small tribe was no preparation. And given my youth and leanings towards further adventure, I hope it does not seem hypocritical of me to say that what you did there, Mr Smoothhands, was perhaps the single greatest act of commitment to Qelline and Carp that you could give. Even marriage would not forego the rash impulses of an adventuring youth, but you seek to temper that. You let your head rule your heart. I believe in time your heart will thank you."

He continues, "This *does* change our friendship. The vast trees of Shadowtop seem ancient and unchanging, but everywhere around us here, there and in between, change is constant. A druid's ear hears the music of the growing leaves, blades of grass, animals and more; a song louder in Shadowtop than I have heard anywhere else. Those ancient trees were once just seeds, then vulnerable saplings; they grew, they changed, and they continue to change. That is the source of strength for all things. And so it is that our friendship changes; it deepens, it broadens and it becomes stronger."

"We might not be so quick to be the fools who rush in wildly with unwise acts, but I do not miss the person I was yesterday, nor tomorrow will I miss the person I am today. Nor should you. It is my honour and privilege to call you a friend, Temo Smoothhands, and that will never change."

Maireagh in the background hums and nods while noisily eating an Apple. It's incongruous and Temo can't help but laugh, which draws Riglan in. He just hugs Riglan's leg, which is all he can reach. Maireagh says, "Well that's very sweet boys, but we may as well climb the tower".

Temo's organised cart-and-horse arrived with the two crates a few minutes ago, so Riglan carries them up. Hard work. The academy tower is tall, but we know the way to the teleportation circle.

Riglan asks Nethza, "Why go to Yartar's circle, when we want to go to Silverymoon?" Nethza isn't sure. We get to the top and actually find various people already there, with things being finalised and agreed. Coming in this way, we realise that this teleportation room has permanent sentinels outside and wards on the door. We'd never noticed all of that before, in the confusion our unannounced arrivals had caused. There's an attendant too, all of them wearing clothes indicating *some* kind of shared organisation we don't recognise.

It transpires that for sake of secrecy and security, we go to specific rooms to cast teleportation spells, to avoid the chance of other people seeing the runes that lead to a location. Nethza makes a note to avoid perhaps being so obvious with Yartar's circle in future! 

Further, the room has a permanent partial teleportation circle - the "base spell" etched permanently in the ground - which just needs activating with certain runes that yield destination if travelling *out* from here. *That's* what Nethza has. It's quicker and more reliable than having to draw out the entire circle. We're told that the chalk used to draw the runes fades away once the circle is cast when a permanent circle is use, which further enhances security.

A representative from Silverymoon university is taking care of thank-yous, goodbyes, small gifts etc. with the Yartar institution. We're told that there are only a few seconds of time while the circle is open and have to move quickly because a lot of us are coming through this time. We check we are carrying all we need. They warn that walking into the active circle can be disorientating so Riglan asks for and is given permission to squeeze in from the get-go, not wanting to accidentally get confused and fall, breaking the crates he carries.

"Are you ready?" they ask. "Yes." A last rune is drawn.

The circle starts to grow. Rings rise and start to rotate and change angle, faster and faster, streaking around us. We've not seen this before; it's quite dramatic. The streaks of light suddenly show different things behind - Riglan is briefly seeing bits of both the Yartar room and another. Riglan takes the cue as others start to walk out, making space for others to come through, into a new room - the others follow, everyone making it through. Nobody saw the rune sequence, unfortunately.

### Just after sunset, Silverymoon

We look around. A beautiful, huge white marble room. Grand columns, great statues of scholars in robes in alcoves. It's 8-sided. "Wow!" says Temo. Above, a beautiful fresco is painted on the underside of a domed roof. The administrator/recruiter from the fayre outside the Waterbaron's Hall beams with barely-hidden pride. "Welcome to Silverymoon University. Please come this way".

A door in one of the 8 sides leads to a long, wide (~15ft) corridor. Bannisters wall one side. Creepers grow along them. Riglan estimates that we might be on a 3rd floor up. Below, there's a courtyard. We exited on a "corner" notionally, but his corridor is curved; it's a ring. A beautiful silver elm grows in the middle. Flowering bushes everywhere. Riglan listens closely to the plants... Insects, birds of twilight; we are a little further East he thinks; the sunset advanced by maybe half an hour or so.

"We are in the summer tower". She points out a few things; "This elm is as old as the university itself, making it about 600 years old". Riglan says, "It's beautiful." "We call her the Argent." "Why?" "Well, you'll see as we drop to the ground level!"

We're led to beautiful, curved stairs that follow the inside walls heading down. Once below the elm's canopy, Riglan sees that the underside of the leaves are a shiny silver. "I've not seen that species before. Quite striking."

"Yes! They say that the sapling was brought from Cormanthor itself - the Elven forests there. Now, most of the staff have probably left to go home, however I believe there will still be someone in the main hall. We will try to get you a room there, if you are thinking about staying in the university; of course you are free to wander into the city of Silverymoon as you please."

"Very kind of you. A room here sounds ideal and I'm sure we'd all like to explore tonight."

"Very well!" - and she shows us to a dormitory room, past an administrative building of sorts - a very beautiful stone building, where parts that are wood appear to be grown around old trees before yielding to sympathetically placed stone. We realise we're in a bit of a valley; sparkling waters of a river flow below and mountains rise either side. It's heavily forested, almost looking like it grew out of a forest; buildings sympathetically built around trees, hidden, or around roots, even though it looks like much of the city has to deal with steep geography.

Riglan says, "Now, *this* is a way to build and grow a city that works with nature - why can't humans get this right? Is that racist?"

The attendant smiles, "Well, I don't think so? Perhaps they just don't see the need. They are not as close to the forest and trees as we are. There are also so many more of them to house!"

Riglan nods. "That is true. I'm still working with them on that, but they do see the importance of nature if you can present it in a way that's meaningful to their everyday lives."

"And therein lies the challenge - they do live very short lives! So much needs to happen in 60-70 years; they struggle to see the reason to form a relationship with nature that is not exploitative and it is hard for them to think in nature's timescales."

Riglan hadn't thought of the problems in terms of time and lifespan before, really. It's a useful insight.

We are asked to sign in and we do so, using a provided, beautiful quill. As we write, there's some kind of magic that changes and sets the words cleanly and perfectly aligned. We're led to the dormitory area and up to a fourth floor.  She unlocks a room, hands us a key and suggests that there might be food in the student hall? We say we'll explore.

We know it won't happen today, but ask about the cases; she lets us know where to get to the High Council and we're warned of an administrative wait! Chambers open around 8am to sign in, but the council does not convene until 9am.

After the usual thanks, she departs.

We realise this is a big, full-on university. Numerous buildings, some obviously added later than others. It's modern Elven architecture; ornate but clean, smooth stonework, Elven lettering etched all over, many carvings in flowing, natural forms and many statues. There's a feeling of following the flows and forms of the many trees around us.

The room has four beds with small writing desks. No dining table but there's a small toilet adjacent. We drop down the crates. Riglan doesn't want to be alarmist, but wonders if we should try and put wards of some kind on the room in case of tampering - we're a bit closer to Azalin and while we don't *think* he's watching Silverymoon, we don't want to give a gift of a cast of poisoned wine either. Maireagh fortunately has Alarm so casts that and we head out.

As we head towards a signed main exit, Riglan notes, "We never found a map of this city" but Temo goes, "Eh, it's a city, how different can it be? All the fancy architecture but the basics are the same! And the verticality makes it easier to spot things from afar, and helps me keep my bearings."

The river and a silver arching bridge are a tourist draw. For no other reason that the apparent magic present, we head that way. Riglan quietly casts Detect Magic. To his astonishment, he sees a permanent powerful enchantment - a huge dome of magic covering the entire city. Abjuration qualities. He points upwards and tells the party - "We might not have needed that Alarm spell after all. What's powering *that*?"

Maireagh joins in with the detection. "Not sure. There's a strong magical presence; a vibration, a feeling in the area. It seems to be linked to *where* it is, perhaps powered by a combination of arcane and primal energies. The ancient forest itself."

Riglan says, "Drawing on the power of the *forest*? I'm not sure how I feel about that."

"It's natural magic. Enhanced by arcane enchantments."

"Yes, but it's unnaturally channelled. I suppose it shouldn't bother me any more than drawing on the nature of the Weave, though."

We head for the bridge. Along the way, we notice that - especially after Yartar - it seems very quiet and tranquil. No street performers, no night markets or food stalls; lights are in buildings and people walk around, but it's quiet. People nod greetings - it seems friendly - but we're left to our business. Vegetation everywhere, buildings not shoulder to shoulder. Getting his eye into things a bit more, Riglan notices a "restaurant", by its own admission on a sign. There seem to be a couple of cafés and other eateries, some open, some closed. Places to drink too, but it's all low-key.

Riglan says, "Odd. I should find this as close to a perfect city as it might be possible to achieve. In some ways, it seems to be. Yet, the lack of the street markets or performers - it's almost too quiet... As if something was missing. I can't put my finger on it."

Close to the bridge, a place called "River's View" catches Temo's eye. "What about there?" Maireagh complains about yet more stairs - as River's View seems set on the 2nd and 3rd floors of a building set into the river bank. Several large trees are anchored here and the buildings are formed around them, stairs following roots.

There is a green and orange painted motif style to this building. We open the door. Inside, soft, jovial conversation and low level violin music. A half-elven man strides towards us; "A good evening to you! Five for dinner?" - this surprises Riglan, but then he remembers the dog. "Ah! Thanks. Four, actually. The metal one doesn't eat." "Oh! I see. My mistake. Didn't notice that you had such a beautiful construct - I thought you had a fifth companion. Actually, if it's *four*, I have a table on the balcony if you want the evening air? If you prefer the music we have tables inside."

Temo says, "The music is nice, but we're new here, and the balcony and its views sound ideal."

More stairs. Maireagh's not happy about that but it's offset by the accidental compliment about the dog!

It's a long, wraparound balcony with three other tables full and one free with four seats. We sit. We're told someone will come to tell us about the food soon. Drinks? Wine maybe?

"We haven't had the budget or access, really, to good Elven wine for a very long time... It seems extravagant, but... Do you have that here?" asks Temo, almost bashfully. "Of course!" - he pulls out a leather and wood-bound drinks menu. He recommends a bottle, pointing at it, but really he's pointing out the price. He can't read the Elvish description but Riglan sees the name of a place, person and year. Temo doesn't flinch at the price. We're here once, possibly never again. The man assures us that he's recommended this not just on budget, it's really he thinks that's the finest vitner in Silverymoon.

After he leaves, Maireagh asks "How much was that?" Temo looks shifty, then mumbles, "25 gold". "What?! OK. This had better be good!"

Nethza looks around. "This place is very... I had no idea what to expect. I've never seen anything like this. It's curious. It's *nothing* like the Elven villages of the High Forest." Riglan hadn't even considered it, for exactly that reason! Yes, it's true; architecturally totally different. Rather than living in the trees, with the trees the highest things, here there are spires and towers above the canopy, and trees are obviously cleared in some areas.

"I think I prefer living *within* the trees. I do like being able to hear nature in the city though", she says. Owls hoot. Frogs croak. Riglan hears a song of growing plant life.

A lady arrives with a bottle covered in elvish writing, presenting it first to Temo. She opens it; a pop. Four glasses - beautiful, thin glass, but with pewter stems - are filled; the wine is lightly sparkling. Glinting in the light. We thank her and she heads away.

Riglan lifts his glass. Raises it at Nethza. Says, "I'm very, very glad we were able to rescue you. To the sounds of frogs in a city". We drink to the toast.

It's very smooth, beautiful flavour, light, but a 'cerebral' wine. We have to think about the taste, not just quaff it! Before they know it, Riglan and Temo have drained their glasses probably far too quickly and pour themselves another. The server returns, just after - "apologies!" she say - and refills Nethza and Maireagh's glasses too. We didn't know that was the protocol.

We're handed thick textured cards with menus written. "Is there anything you don't eat? Things you have objections to?" Riglan says, "Nothing animal unless killed out of necessity and killed swiftly." "How do you feel about fish from the river?" "Sounds good." We're invited to flip the menus over. Even Riglan doesn't understand some of the Elven words there - he can *read* them but doesn't know what they mean. Riglan apologises; Elven is not a first language... He'll take recommendations!

As we wait, Nethza spots a very large bird on a very large. Riglan sees it too. Nature 26. He gets excited, jumps up and leans over the balcony almost, trying to get a better look. "I've never seen one in the wild! Some kind of giant eagle. Beautiful!" we remember the spyglass. Riglan fishes it out and sees it's feeding chicks. "Amazing! You have to look!" and hands the spyglass around. We we're looking the attendant returns with a trolley and plates. "Ah! You can see the golden eagle! It's one of our favourite things to watch. What is that you have?" she asks, of the spyglass. It's a surprise that she hasn't seen it before. Riglan shows and explains - not magical, just clever glass. She is able to enjoy a closer view of the eagle too.

The first course arrives. A kind of lotus bud, filled with various "fresh spring flavours shaped into each petal and in the middle, honey and spring pollen from flowers that grow on the hillside here. It's all edible!"

Despite the pretty presentation, it's actually surprisingly *un*-fussy after all the fuss in bringing and describing it. It's very good, though quite a sweet dish in a fruit sense, not too savoury, which is quite different from many of the "first courses" in "posh" places we've visited around the Sword Coast. Some sort of twisted-bread buns are put alongside, also sweet; glazed, with raisins and some kind of sweet tree sap.

Next, soup with flower petals. Those are quite spicy - almost minty - with a savoury, salty soup that's delicious.

Third, spring leeks and other vegetables. Strong garlic and onion flavours and crispy root vegetables with it.

Empty plates are brought and, in the middle, a whole fish. "This is the first fish". Riglan sees that it's Perch. It sort of for show; around it are various vegetables which the attendant serves up to our plates, then we serve ourselves portions of the fish. Turnips, lotus root, watercress and more. We're asked if we want another bottle of wine. We enquire about contrasting recommendations; the waitress suggests her personal favourite, heavier, more heady, more aromatic. It's not as "revered" she says as the bottle we've had, but that's expensive and she thinks the alternative is just as good. Sounds great. "Only" 10gp.

The bottle is again beautiful but the glass of this is a kind of amber colour rather than clear. It's golden-coloured, rather than silvery-white and still. We're given different shaped glasses for this too. It's certainly aromatic! Honey, flowers, ripe fruit. It works particularly well with the richer flavours of the vegetables around the fish.

The "last of the savoury courses" is brought out. A river trout. "These are available really only for a few months of the year when they travel through on their way upstream. We call them rainbow trout, because of the colour" - and we can see the iridescent colours in the skin. It's been baked with a meatier flavour which again favours the heavier wine too. This comes with a salad to balance the intensity of the fish.

Riglan comments that the wine, while very different, certainly seems to sit on a par with the other bottle, they're just in different areas.

Finally, four small plates, new cutlery; a small bowl in the middle; dark, chocolate-colour, softly bubbling! Bowls of fruit are put nearby. Temo goes, "Oh I get it! We dip the fruit in there!" So we get stuck in. It's fun.

We're offered some drinks to finish - we opt for a minty tea. Once she's away, Riglan whispers to Maireagh, "It won't be as good as yours, but I'm being polite!" - Maireagh tries it when it arrives and says, "It actually is really good!"

Once the proceedings are done, we're left to our own devices. Two other tables have left, with a table at the far end where a couple of lovebirds enjoy the evening. The moon is up, lighting up the whole river.

"Silvery-everything" says Temo. Riglan groans.

We chew the fat about the vibe. Not hostile or aloof; but a university town. Many elves, but Maireagh points out that maybe only half the people we've seen are. The university is in theory open by merit alone, so, to anyone. We even see two people on the bridge that look - for want of a better description - like bipedal rabbits!

Eventually it's time to pay, go and rest. The bill arrives. The total bill is written out as 600 silvers. A strange notation. Riglan enquires, on basis of custom, if they require that denomination. It's just the way they give numbers here. They're happy with 6 platinum, so he pays.

We head back towards our University room. Everything's so - pretty here. Beautiful. Trees, ivy, decorative circular fountains with circular "squares" around them, all of the buildings seem to have impeccable stonework. Everyone's quiet, but there are plenty of them around - people in courtyards having food or so-on.

At the university it seems comparatively busy! It seems a "shift change" of sorts has happened - students abound, walking around, chatting, laughing, some play music, some play games. Temo pulls out his new lute - "I haven't tuned it!" - and sets to work as we walk. Soon he has it going and starts to play a happy tune. "It's very beautiful. A little stiff - very new - needs playing more!" The students seem friendly. We have a few random conversations on the way. The lute is a conversation ice-breaker.

Eventually we're back at the room. "That was quite possibly the most expensive meal we've ever had" says Maireagh "but I have to concede it was good!" Riglan agrees, but adds, "I don't know why, but that felt like a *really* big day" says Riglan. "I'm very tired."

We agree. Time to rest.

(END OF PART 3.9 - Part 3.10 next)
