# Riglan: Part 3.8
## Day 25, mid-spring, equinox - Yartar

A knock on the door wakes up Riglan and Temo. It's Nethza. "Temo! Remember! If we want to get good pastries we have to go early..."

They rush down to the market. There's already a long queue formed at the Gateway Bakery, but it moves quickly, as it always does. Before long, it's our turn. Temo grabs a basket on the left as he goes through the door and picks up pastries along the way. There's something new he sees, which is some kind of O-shaped piece of bread or similar with some kind of sugary coatings on top. Flaky pastries with chocolate in. Tarts and treats at the counter - he doesn't hold back! 3gp, judged by weighing the basket. Nethza's is only 1gp. Things are bagged up and we exit. The o-shaped new bread stuff was already selling out, along with some of the counter treats.

They head back to the Griffon; we're all awake. Everyone ends up in Riglan and Temo's room eating pastries. Riglan asks, "What did they call these strange O-bread things?" but Temo didn't see the name - he was focused on the bread. Neither did Nethza. Just saw a sign saying, "New!". They're quite sweet, which Temo likes but it's a bit much for others. We've got lots left over, so decide to visit the Waterbaron and leave some for her. Inevitably, there are already queues of applicants falling outside. Fortunately, it's short and we don't "do you know who I am?!" and just queue. Once inside, we show the insignia from way back that gets us an audience (as well as offering pastries). We're permitted access but do have to wait.

After about 15 minutes, two more come and join us. A short while later, the door opens and the Waterbaron's assistant comes out - recognises us straight away. "Haven't seen you in ages!" and we're invited in, offering pastries as we go.

"Oh! You've discovered the O-dough!" says the Waterbaron as we go in; "It's really quite popular. Apparently one of the bakers at Gateway Bakery invented it! He went on a long journey to the coast for a trading mission, apprenticeship or something, came back and stumbled across the idea. It's been drawing people here from the surrounding areas; it's a nice boost. Ingenious really."

We talk about Azalin. Sildar's on his way here; and yes, when she asks, we say the threat should be taken seriously. Not imminent (we think!) like the orbs were, but a lot of potential for bad.

On lighter topics, the celebration tonight is called the "Ides Of Spring". The symbol for it is a seed, though people tend to wear garlands (yes, of course, thinks Riglan; celebrate life by stringing a bunch of dead flowers around your neck!). The farmers get to come in and celebrate plantings. Sounds good. She says, "The official flower is I believe the iris"; Riglan - "Hard to find, in these parts?"; "Well, the flower meadows have been planting irises throughout the winter"; "Ah. I'll have to look at those."

We learn that things have been stabilised and improving over time since the weather settled, though the political situation continues to be somewhat perilous; the owner of the Grand Dame is still trying machinations, but at least some of those are being stopped. He can't be linked directly to criminal acts but they're aware that he funds a thieve's guild in town and is trying to shift balance of power to create an opening for himself. That knowledge and awareness helps them foil his efforts.

With that, we bid the usual farewells and well-wishes and head out. The clerk says goodbye; the queue is now rather large in the waiting room! 

As we head slowly - as it's still too early for 10am opening - towards the archives, Riglan muses that it'd be great to do divination at the Morning Spire but hasn't got the right question. Maireagh suggests he just asks for guidance. Riglan hadn't considered not worry about the right question, but in fact asking an ambiguous one and seeing what happened. To the spire, then.

The morning choral procession is descending the tower. Supplicants are invited up the tower. There's a ministrant who greets us. Asks what brings us here. Riglan explains briefly about his desire to try divination; is there a place? Yes. There's a room up the tower. We can sing, pray, anything much. At the alms box, he pauses briefly and Riglan drops in 1pp. The ministrant's mood improves further!

It's high up - 6 flights to the upper tier. Stone arches rise above a balcony that encircles the tower, looking out over the river and town. Many boats are on the water, most headed for the port. Garlands of flowers are visible, for the festival tonight. Singers are already up here, chanting and singing; we are invited to join in the chanting to **Lathander**. It's easy enough to listen to it and pick up, so we join in as best we can.

Riglan casts his divination spell, but the casting includes an indication that he does not know what question he should ask (technically allowing him to cast a form of Guidance). It's an insight role plus D4, with incense burned as with Divination. Temo helps with his prior inspiration, though (D20->10, then D20->3) Riglan can't quite grapple the spell very well. The D4 is good, +4; Maireagh rallies to the cause and helps with a flash of genius. We're all in it together, trying to find a spiritual connection. 10+10+4+5 -> 29. Just short of 30, but it's a lot. We hold hands.

The chanting around Riglan suddenly seems to be imbued with language, not just harmonies. A line repeats itself:

**"Look to the rising sun. That is where you should seek. The closer to the source of the heat, the nearer you get to what you seek."**

After a while that fades. Riglan pulls out the piece of paper he'd written the prior divination on and writes the sentence down. It seems aimed at us, not part of the chant, even though it could just as easily have been for the God Of Morning.

If taken literally, Riglan thinks that points to the desert, at least in its first two sentences. The last two? Not sure, might become obvious later. Well, with that in mind - focus research on the Seer.

The ministrant asks if we found answers we looked for. "Some clarity or direction?" Riglan smiles and says, "Yes, a direction, quite literally! Thank you." The ministrant says, "The answers are often in you, all along; we merely require a bit of reassurance and guidance to trust our heart. We're all created from the same matter and therefore we all carry within ourself a spark of divinity; we are connected to that which is divine. We hear a cosmic song and we hear it clearest at times like this, which is why we sing in the mornings, to hear the notes of creation once more."

### Just after 10am

Back on the ground, the archive is next, to pick up a book and let Lanowin know about the importance of the Seer. He's found the book - "Odd. There should be two copies of this book, but I can't find the other one. It just means you can't take this copy away. You're welcome to sit in the research room and read it?"

That looks like our day, then. Research it is. We're handed a very thick, old, leather-bound tome with frightening imagery embossed on the outside. It's strapped closed with sinew! OK, so this guy is worse than we thought...

Maireagh gets stuck into the book with Temo's help (history, 5,8+10->18). Meanwhile Riglan and Nethza realise that reading over-the-shoulder isn't productive and think a visit to Wallheim's could be in order; probably closed this time of day, but worth a look. Otherwise it might be down to random chance in the Festhall.

The book is a cover-to-cover thing, but Temo's interested in a few key things while he checks over it:

* What does Azalin look like, physically?
* How / when did the Dark Powers imprison him?
* Just what were Azalin's worst acts and powers at his peak - how powerful is he?

Well:

* There are some drawings but they're not great and quite different. Written descriptions of **The Wizard King Tyrant Of The Northern Kingdoms Of The Sea Of Fallen Stars** (Azalin) seem to be more consistent. A "light brown-skinned, quite exotic-looking middle-aged man" - implication, human! Caramel-olive skin. These seem to be from when he was alive (see below). Wears a "crown of jagged spikes", making him look much taller than he really is.
* He arrived on this plane from 'somewhere else', bringing with him a summoned army of Thralls (a kind of vampire), acting as a warlord in those northern kingdoms - we're surprised to read that this was only 600 years ago in our time; we thought it was a more ancient thing.
* The rein of terror and harassment of the surrounding kingdoms lasted for over a century. It's understood that he rose to the height of his powers here, on this plane, during which time **it is believed that he became a lich**.
* It is therefore possible that his phylactory and other things that 'power' his lichdom are **on this plane** - and so it seems even less of an accident that he had Nethza, from *this* plane, perhaps indeed hoping to get a material connection via her for Plane Shift.
* "Silence and death precede him, for his magic is one of cold, necrotic decay." Temo notes that the same thing apparently follows after him, too, given what was left of the Shadow Fell Domain after his escape.

The "wizard king" description seems literal; a true wizard, unafraid to wield power visibly and on battlefields. He doesn't hide and send out armies without him. He does not fear death, at least not anymore.

Temo asks Maireagh if that has anything to do with Thay. Is there an overlap? Is he a king there now, or something? We'd have to cross-reference records to figure out that, but Maireagh is at least sure that current ruling factions of Thay are far more recent than 600-500 years ago. It is possible though that he might be back there? Anyway, the Seer might help more, but everything so far is pointing East and towards the mighty deserts.

* His conquests were single-minded. Not looking to take more land, build an empire for power; just roll over a kingdom stood in his way, while he searched for **ancient Netherese artefacts**.
* This makes Maireagh nervous. We still don't know too much about the Netherese; Old Owlbear Tower is an old outpost, though, so she's been doing a lot of reading. She says, "From what I know, the Netherese were the last *truly* magical kingdom and empire on this planet; with the leaving of the elves, there isn't magic of that magnitude left. So, he's seeking extremely powerful sources of magic..."
* ...Things which the Arcane Brotherhood, we think, have no ethical issues seeking - which is why (We had learned after asking around) some call them evil, but others have disputed that; it's more that they're outcasts as "reputable" magical academies wouldn't touch things of such power and danger.

(We note of course that Gnog's party - several months back from Ravnica now - would immediately be *very* severely alarmed if they were to learn of this, most likely alerting the Ancient Dragon Council and flying East immediately, but they know nothing of it!)

* This desire for power, even back then, is why the "gods" stepped in. And thus, Azalin Rex passed into legend; a bogeyman to scare children.
* But this means very few people alive today have ever seen him. We'd be looking for a truly ancient dwarf, more likely an elf, or long-lived race mix, Treant perhaps, "or maybe a dragon!" adds Maireagh.

We have some more time and Temo suggests that finding out more about phylactories and lichdom, since it sounds important. And he mentions that while we don't know a friendly dragon, we do know a - sort of - friendly Lich...

Meanwhile - Nethza and Riglan have headed over, to see if anyone can open the door. As expected it's closed, with a sign saying, "We are closed!". Riglan knocks politely on the door and calls, "Hello Aneeria! It's Riglan and Nethza. Very sorry about the hour, but I wondered if you had time for a chat?"

Riglan unusual persuasion: Nat 20+4! Woah. There are shuffling and grumbling noises. The curtain twitches. Locks are withdrawn; the door opens. Aneeria is in pyjamas! "Ugh! It's bright outside. Get in here before I melt!" - we rush inside; "I'm so sorry, I hope we didn't wake you?" says Riglan. "Not at all - though I do sleep when the sun is out. The sun is hateful. It's very bad for my skin. But, well, what has happened? You wouldn't come and visit me socially!"

Riglan summarises. In particular, we wonder what she knows of seers. She can't really help given it's so vague, but Candlekeep might have books on it - maybe try there. Anauroch Desert. *Might* be considered evil and deceptive. Apparently that's surprising because usually seers are considered neutral. We might be reading the divination wrong; or it's just a warning on top of our prior warnings.

On finding Azalin, Aneeria has spells that can contact people - spirits usually - using things they owned. An object which connects. We mention that we did come back here in a rush, and brought back a couple of things from that plane; including Nethza's flute, for example. Aneeria figures she can cast the ritual on the flute, but isn't sure exactly who we'd be contacting - but what would we ask?

Ah. That again! We aren't sure. Aneeria says she can set up the spell and then *we* cast it from the setup, so she's not in danger and we get to speak. And have a chance to think.

Riglan thanks her - that's a great idea. He suggests we should pay her in some way, if we can, for her trouble; she'll happily take potions, as ever. Riglan searches around and in the end finds the perfect thing - a potion of Aqueous Form, which she is very enthusiastic about.

* We figure we probably won't get Azalin.
* If a rando, we'll try asking if they know Azalin is on "our plane" & where he is.
* If Tummil, try to get a idea of how long time it has been in his time since we spoke and so-on.

There's the question of 'where' too. Outside the city, in case of danger. Riglan wonders about the old archery area we first saw, on the main road; not in use outside of festivals; but Nethza reminds him of the graveyard where the auction was held. Grizzly but makes sense, more spirits and objects to confuse any spells coming at us, harder to figure out location - done deal.

We head out, thanking Aneeria, with the components she's given us and instructions. We grab some food for us and the other two and head to the Archives to catch up. It's busy - it's festival day! We go via the main square. We pick up four flower garlands too, for tonight! Tourist things. There's a "new drink" in town - "cane juice" - Riglan doesn't like the sound of that, "Canes are just wood, there's not much juice in them even if the wood is new!". It's pale green, Nethza thinks it looks interesting; tries it; mostly just sweet. How strange. Riglan points and asks the vendor, "I don't get it! Canes are just dry wood." "Not necessarily! I'll show you..." - he turns to a big basket behind him and shows us the process of making another batch. There's a machine that's basically just two steel rollers, a foot operated mechanism, and it squishes the cane flat as they're pushed in. Whatever the plant is, it's got quite a lot of this light green sweet liquid inside. "It's best at this time of year - very tender and soft, and sweet but not *too* sweet." Riglan tries some, and it's kind of what Nethza said! Riglan asks where it grows. "Sugar canes grow in warmer climates; we get most of our sugar canes from further south, or towards the east." "East? Caravans head out that way?" "They do. Long journeys, because there are no direct roads, but that's where I'm from. I'm from the east! I'm not from here." "Ah. We might have business on the edge of a desert, the Anauroch Desert." "I'm beyond that - a country called Cormir, on the western shores of a great sea - the Sea Of Fallen Stars." Riglan says he needs to get himself a map! "A bit of a journey though - it takes about 2 months to get here."

We chat a while longer. Riglan's fur will overheat him in the desert areas, but it'll stop him from getting burned by the sun. Riglan hadn't even considered that; so rarely a problem in a forest. We'll have to watch out for all of us. "I guess there must be special clothing that helps?" "Yes, you tend to just cover yourself with a big sheet!"

In the end, we spend about 1gp on the food and garlands and 4sp on the drinks, taking two up for Maireagh and Temo as well. We get to the archives and find them. They're just about finished; we give them the food and drink and catch up - though we're ushered outside for eating! Not indoors in the archive.

We catch up, in both directions, then head to cast the spell (as the outcome might inform us about books we need and Aneeria pointed out that Eskilinrar's can be surprising for that). It's busier, inns full, and even some tents in the archery area - good thing we're *not* casting the spell there, then. It seems that just about any festival ends up with the camp grounds being used as an overflow; a festival area, on the main road in. It's kinda nice in a way.

Continuing East, we reach the Charnal House & graveyard. It's surrounded by trees, crypts around, a couple of small mausoleums. One has a tunnel that leads a long way underground - maybe that's the safest? History rolls are low and it takes a while, but we do find the entrance and head down. We realise we haven't seen it in daylight before!

After the tunnel is the slightly bigger room. We set up lamps, so that we have non-magical light to keep our spells clear if we need them, and Riglan lays out the components - a circle of bones, Nethza's flute in the middle - and casts.

The bones on the ground start to tremble, then as the ritual completes they hover a bit off the ground, still trembling. Some smoke begins to fill the circle, sort of pouring down onto the ground from the hovering ring, filling the room with this greyish, heavy smoke. The flute ends up standing on end, rotating a bit in the middle of the bones. Riglan senses a presence...

...insight 17+10->27, it is not an entity. This isn't a single entity. The smoke continues to pour out, snuffing out the natural light eventually. It fills the room, very dark, misty... Familiar! Ah. It's *that*.

There is the sense of a consciousness. It speaks directly into Riglan's mind.

"Who dares to reach out and touch 'concept-of-our/my/both-at-same-time' mind?"

Riglan says, "My name is Riglan Leafseeker."

There's a sort of "whomp!" sound and then it gets very quiet. A presence in front of him. "Riglan Leafseeker. The audacity to reach into our domains and contact someone there! It is forbidden for anyone inside to have any contact with those in the outside world."

Riglan says, "It is also forbidden for Azalin Rex to escape his prison to our plane, but that's exactly what's happened. Are you aware?"

"SILENCE!" 'shouts' the entity. There's a feeling of it splintering again, now, the coherence lost, a strange noise as if many consciousnesses discuss.

"You speak the truth. He is not in his seat! Did you allow this to happen?"

"No, we failed to prevent it. He was planning for centuries, gathering power. And now he's *here* and we need to find out how to stop him and get him back!"

"Do you act alone?"

"I have three friends. And we hope to find more aid in this world, but our powers are limited."

The mist clears in front of him. "Then the four of you may approach." Riglan motions to the others; a door has appeared; we walk forward, opening the door, to see a barebones room.

"Approach!" say the still-splintered 'voices', but in unison.

We walk in. Definitely not our world, a shift, a feeling. A throne room, or temple, or something? A bare stone floor with the faintest inscriptions present. No mist, but in front what look like the lower legs and feet, and robed lower limbs, sat on chairs - thrones? - of beings on either side. Hard to tell how many. They seem to shift and merge and disperse, hard to focus. Training the eye in on one and holding there helps. The feet to knees, looks about 30ft high. Looking up, towering above, a cowled figure, grey robe, long, almost skeletal-looking hands - not bones, just thin. Monstrously large! Two points of blue light from under the cowl (hood) of the robe - that look like stars, not eyes, from the time we were in the Shadowfell domain. At least one other to the right, but they move and Riglan has to stop looking too closely or he'll fall over backwards!

"We are the Guardians Of All Worlds. We take those who have no place in worlds and trap them in mazes of their own creation. We turn powerful, evil minds against themselves; we harness their greed, their vices and use it against them; and in so doing, allow the worlds to continue life. We interfere to stop interference! We are the paradox that makes all life possible."

Riglan clears his throat, "Well, uuuh, we are just four people from - " (hesitates a moment and Temo says, "Toril!") - "Toril. One of us was abducted into the Shadowfell Realm by Rex. We followed through the fracture he used, and rescued her. We were only able to depart because he tore a path out of that domain."

As he's saying this, heads that were looking at him suddenly turn to look at Nethza. One points.

"She carries blood from our side of the veil. How is this possible? Child. You are both of this world and also of bear the mark of worlds of our creation! You are... As a daughter to us. Yet, you walk amongst the living."

Nethza looks fairly stunned, understandably. "I - I... I don't know. I am - I am just *me*. I have always been the way I am."

"Things that happen, we don't watch everything... Our eyes turn outwards, scanning for threats to the cosmos, but we know not always what transpires in the kingdoms we create. Some clever mice do escape their traps or find ways to do so." Another speaks. "It appears Azalin has plotted his escape long before you were born. **You birth was part of his plan**."

Riglan says, "There was a pact, when Nethza was born."

One asks, "Do you know the history of your blood?" to Nethza. "No, I don't... No. I know I respond to powers that I don't understand; I don't fully know where these powers come from." The answer, "Will you bleed for the truth?" at which Riglan (and Temo) move swiftly to her side and Riglan says, "We won't let you harm her!" but Nethza waves us away. "I've been walking in the dark for so long - I would like to know."

A hand moves down to the ground. Huge. 8ft across. A voice says, "Take this bowl" - and one sort of emerges from the palm. "Fill it with your blood". Nethza takes a deep breath, draws her hand up her blade and it bleeds into the bowl. Fairly quickly, Maireagh rushes over; "That's enough!" and casts a healing spell.

"We follow your story back" says a voice. Blood flies out of the bowl and streaks across the air in droplets, that turn into a long trail, which dances and changes as if filled with waves of music before settling into what amounts to a strange illusion - the droplets form a misty, strange picture.

It moves; it describes what Riglan thought he knew... But then things change.

* It confirms a pact was made, but it appears that a pact was made by Nethza's father, with a very powerful warlock, for the ability to save her mother.
* But the mother had made a pact with Levistus allowing him to temporarily inhabit her to temporarily be present in the world and escape his frozen tomb in the Nine Hells; in return he would give the child health. Nethza in the womb was struggling.
* The rude health that the mother exhibited and the abilities she manifested frightened the father so much that he sought the warlock, wanting the demon/devil pushed out of his wife. "What of the child?" asks the warlock.
* We see something new. The father was always trying to save the wife and was willing to sacrifice the child, we thought. But instead - he says, "She must live. They both must live!" "Then I must have something in return", says the **warlock, asking for the child on her 18th birthday to be given to him as an apprentice**. The father, in desperation, agrees - 18 years to solve the problem.
* This was a mistake as it bound Nethza to this warlock. But the competing forces of the warlock and devil killed the mother; she didn't survive; Nethza of course did.
* We are shown a battle - Levistus, enraged, feeling he was robbed of what was promised, went to attack Nethza but the father got in the way. The magic of the warlock protected Nethza but the father was mortally wounded by Levistus. He saw no option but to use his last bit of strength to reach the doors of a nunnery and leave Nethza there before he found a place to die.
* As it happens, when Nethza was around 13, the warlock was mortally wounded in a battle, before Nethza's 18th birthday and begged his patron for immortality to save him. We see the patron. **Unmistakable from the book we read - Azalin Rex**.
*In exchange for saving the warlock, Azalin says, "Then I take back this bond - this contract you have made with me; this pact - if you will apply this pact to the child and bind your contract to me - the arcane result is that her blood will be corrupted with mine". **Nethza wasn't born as a child of Azalin Rex, but was given to him in this way.**
* More revelations. The Dark Powers present in the room, also seeing this apparently anew, are aghast - they thought there was no way for Azalin to contact people outside the Shadowfell, so how did he grant power to this warlock? Did the warlock find a way to pierce the veil in, to find Azalin as his patron? The warlock is indeed saved, but Azalin just kills him straight after. He was just using the warlock - he now had what he wanted. Blood from the outside.
* This is the point where things go wrong for Nethza in her world.
* This happened in the Domains Of Dread, not her world; the Raven Queen saw what was happening and took an interest in this rising power and unusual connection. To stop Azalin's blood from thoroughly corrupting Nethza, the Raven Queen inserted a piece of herself into what was happening **as the bond was being created** - a piece of herself was thrown through a shadow into Nethza. That **is indeed her childhood friend Shadow that followed her ever since**.

The blood suddenly drops to the floor, splattering on the stone. The voices speak again.

"We will find him!"

One raises a finger and arm up, tracing a sigil. It hangs in the air but then fades and falters.

"What? He is hidden! He knows that we are searching for him and he has hidden himself... We cannot see him."

Riglan says, "If *we* find him - we are on his trail - how can we help you then stop him?"

"The first time we trapped him, he had to be weakened. We need you to weaken him, but you must not kill him! Whatever you do... If you kill him, he will simply be transported into his phylactory. Nobody knows where or what it is. He will have escaped and will bide his time; wait until we're all dead; then reemerge." They say that they finally successfully managed to trap him only about 100 years ago. About 500 years ago, they made the above mistake - their champion killed him and he just waited.

Riglan says, "Then it seems we are bound to the cause of finding, and somehow weakening, Rex. How, then, do we call upon you?"

One produces a black feather. Just a huge, black feather. "When the time comes, pull this feather out and write this..." - he shows a symbol, which Riglan hastily copies onto his at-hand paper - "...to call upon us" - it provides them with a conduit.

(We will all take a copy of this sigil later, so that any of us four can draw it with the feather, should we be standing when others have fallen).

Someone steps forward, takes the "pen", walks 'through' this strange shifting collection of apparitions, shrinking as it does - a strange effect, something getting closer but also smaller! It is a masked figure, without a hood; the mask is black and white with a sad looking face; extremely ornate carvings of porcelain that look like wide, black, sweeping feathers, reaching out and back; they bring the feather to us, by now about a foot long - looking like a quill. A very old/mature sounding female voice speaks; "Daughter, I have watched you through your life." She hands Nethza the feather and places a black lace-gloved hand on her shoulder. "Every tear that you shed, I felt it. Every broken heart, I felt it. Every time you fell, I felt it. But also, every smile, every joy, and every comfort that you could find; I felt those too. Know that I have always been here to watch over you." She touches the amulet that Nethza wears. "Funny. How did you know that it was me? Know that I love you and I have always loved you. **Your mother loved you for all her life and your father - you were everything to him. You were never unwanted. You were always loved.**"

She turns to us. "And these. Your new family. Whether they say it or not, I know they love you." Maireagh says, "No shit, we went to the Shadowfell for her!" "Ha. Yes! Yes, you did." She looks to each of us in turn, then says, "I had very little ability to help you within the domain of Azalin Rex, but now, on Toril, where you are, my powers can flow FREE!" - her voice getting louder and louder as she speaks the last few words; but there is an indignant anger too, someone is trying to manipulate and harm this "daughter" of hers. "**And they will know my wrath!** If you ever need of my power, call upon me." Nethza's amulet glows fiercely with newfound power.

Temo steps forward and just says, "Thank you for looking after her. The shadow helped us find and protect her." And suddenly, looking out from behind the Raven Queen is Nethza's childhood friend... It's Mark. Temo chuckles and waves.

We have to leave; the other voices are saying that we've been in the domain too long. The door cannot be left open. We thank them and withdraw. As we thank them, the Raven Queen steps back and there's a strange "long corridor zooming out" effect, as if the room and doorway are flying away from us, and we're back in the crypt; the mist dissipates; lamp light is restored surprisingly; the flute clatters to the ground and the bones just turn to dust in the air and fall as powder.

Another moment of stunned silence.

Maireagh walks up to Nethza. "Steady. Steady, girl..." and holds her arm. Nethza looks over to all of us. Sighs. "I'm glad we didn't do that in town!" "Yes" says Temo, "But I think I've had enough crypts for the day. Shall we surface?"

We walk, in silence, processing, afraid to be the first to break the quiet perhaps, along the corridor and into the sunshine. Riglan says, at that, "Well, at least it's roughly the right time of day. You never can be too sure."

He leans against a crypt wall, tired; she is holding the feather. "Maybe someone else should keep this?" and Riglan says, "Well, you'll be his main target. Temo might be at range?" so Temo takes it. And this is where we all take a copy of the sigil that Riglan noted down.

"Must be a relief" says Riglan; "Not actual Rex blood! Not a true descendant. It's all just trickery and lies, of course. Now all we have to do is find him. Are you OK?"

Nethza - "Uh, yeah, a bit more blood than I thought actually!" - she's shaky on her feet. "I am OK. I'm kind of angry. But not at anyone in particular."

Temo says, "Rex would be a good start - half the shit you've been through is on him. And, the Raven Queen was right to say your current family loves you. Though, we *do* tell you from time to time."

Maireagh remembers something important. "So... Why did the Raven Queen try to stop us from finding you? Or is that not what was going on?" Riglan goes "Huh, didn't think to ask, but yeah, that very first battle; we were *told* that was the Raven Queen's messengers; and they said not to follow. I don't get it. We might have to watch out for another layer or two of deception here. But it seems we got the basics in the vision anyway; I mean anything that surprises the Dark Powers themselves is probably coming from a source of truth - they don't seem easily fooled."

"No. But Azalin is clearly more powerful than we feared."

"Yeah. And I don't know how to beat that. 'Weakening' but not killing? No chance of killing as we stand right now; he'd wipe the floor with us I fear. First thing's first. We need to know where he is. And we don't know how long we've got, so we have to try and be quick."

We talk about liches and getting books, at which point Temo remembers Renwick Karadoon and suggests that. Riglan's heard worse ideas though it'd be good to take something of interest to him - he *might* like our Shadowfell artefacts or might just want books. Hard to say.

It seems like a trip to Eskilindrar's is in order. We can try for books on liches, anything on the practices of religion and beliefs of the people at Summit Hall.

### Mid-afternoon

It's a lively, festival afternoon. Workers of the land finish early, while inns, shops and taverns open late.

On a side road near the town gates, a group of people are in costume - some forty of them - being organised by someone standing on a crate. They're holding musical instruments. "A procession!" says Temo. Ropes are being put along the sides of roads probably to mark the way, but the people doing it are having trouble clearing revellers off the street. Riglan offers to help, as he could become a large creature that pushes people off the road; but they prefer persuasion. So, Riglan turns into a Dire Wolf, Temo jumps on his back and with the wand of fireworks and so-on, Temo manages to get attention and start calling for people to move aside and the ropes get put into place.

There are a few protests about it being busy, so why not be on the road? And at that moment, a loud fanfare and marching band outfit start up from near the town gates - the performers we saw. Riglan hastily changes back to himself and we keep off the road!

It seems that the forty-odd people we saw was just the *start* of the parade. Various groups come through, with different dancers, banners and tricks; representation of different guilds, professions and so-on. Some small groups carry signs - "Silverymoon" says one, with the group wearing blue and silver flowy robes, just a small group waving and creating little illusions. Some traders and smiths; "Three Boar Ale" (representatives from Triboar) - initially getting a bit of a cold reception given the competition between Yartar and Triboar but samples of ale to adults help warm things up!

The parade lasts some half an hour, eventually ending up outside the Water Baron's tower. She is there, in full regalia, to 'greet the people'. She stands with a mage next to her helping her amplify her voice via magical means as she addresses the "fine people of Yartar". She welcomes delegates from other towns and cities too. Then she declares the "weekend of the Spring Festival open!" to claps and cheers, with paper streamers thrown and music from random groups all over the nearby roads, squares and markets.

Riglan stands in the middle of it all; this crazy dance of society around him, almost detached. He looks to Maireagh. "You had to pull me away from here once; 'You don't do well in the city', you said. And it was true. I guess we've all changed a fair bit." Maireagh agrees but "still doesn't like the crowds", so, "how about a quiet bookshop?!" "OK!" - Eskilindrars, however, is busy. We've only ever seen a small handful inside before, but today, he actually has an assistant with a dozen people or more in the shop. He seems happy. We see some people leaving carrying the hand-made, leatherbound journals he makes himself.

There's a callout to a section of maps - Yartar in different time periods. Very tourist... But, on maps, we look for the desert. Eskilindrar has spotted us and comes over to help. He says "You're locals! I won't do you the disrespect of selling you a map of that which is not well mapped... It's not an area well explored and documented. But I can show you this..." - and he shows us one of the better ones, he thinks, for accuracy; but even that is very vague. Anauroch Desert, the grey peaks, the storm peaks; that's about it. The desert he says is huge - the name we have is not for a corner of it, it's the whole thing, bigger than the sword coast. We'll need to be more specific.

We ask then instead about Cormir, Thay, Netherese ruins? On the last - no information. Perhaps Silverymoon or other dwarven strongholds might have libraries with information, or perhaps human cities large enough might have a few - Waterdeep, Neverwinter perhaps, Baldur's Gate maybe. He thinks Silverymoon is the best bet. And we both know that people from there are in town right now. Handy.

At least on Thay and Cormir - the Sea Of Fallen Stars - interestingly view the Sword Coast as a new area, a 'wild west', the untamed area. They don't have the Lord's Alliance representative; they view that as a fledgling organisation, with their own cities far older and more established. He offers us a book; only thin, "really, it's for students in their late teens studying these subjects!" - "Primer On The Eastern Empires" and it even has a simple map. New names on there, to us - "Tethir", for example. A whole part of our world we've never even heard of - and yet, far older and more established than those around us.

We note that the desert separates those kingdoms from the Sword Coast; it runs north-south, with the Sea Of Fallen Stars further East. Really, on a large scale, the Sword Coast is just a small stretch of the Northern coast of the Western seaboard of the larger continent. Seeing a huge scale display-only map, makes us realise that even the Sea Of Fallen Stars dwarfs the Sword Coast itself.

The two months from Cormir mentioned by the sugar cane trader? Well, that one is the *Western*-most empire. The closest! Thay is on the far Eastern shore of the Sea OFS, with several other kingdoms in between.

"We're going to have issues with travel speed..." muses Riglan.

It gives context to the writings about Azalin Rex. He was active on the 'northern side' of the Sea OFS, and now we can see how many kingdoms are around there and get some feeling of the distances involved - thousands of miles. It also shows how nobody in the Sword Coast might have even had the faintest idea it was going on - they're months of travel away.

Onto our other enquiries, he has nothing on Summit Hall. He has a mythology book on phylactories - liches - and can't guarantee there are any facts! He tells us to check through it and see if we really do want to buy it first; we might want a more factual book from libraries perhaps. Temo, investigation 23; the lich section is - well, a page, rather than a section! It does tell us that a Phylactory is any object that's used during the complicated and high-level arcane rituals required to complete the change of a person to lichdom. It is usually a very secret and often hidden object, that is understood to be the source of the lich's immortality and has to be something, or related to something very dear to them. They rip their soul out and hide it in the phylactory, imbuing it with such great power that it is able to - over long periods of time, a year or more - slowly reform the physical vessel (body) that a lich possesses before their spirit and their mind is placed back into it. In the mean time, the trapped soul can't leave to the underworld - it's held there, intentionally trapped. This in turn means that the phylactory is usually stored in a very powerful chamber along with the magic needed to help reconstruct the body. That is the only way there's any chance of finding one - it could be very small, but there has to be room next to it for the body to reform. It's usually a specially-made chamber. We remember from Renwick that his phylactory is hidden in the wall behind the statue of his brother - because Riglan found it essentially by accident via the dreaming. The crypt back there is the place where Renwick would reform, but the phylactory itself is buried in the wall.

So in fairness, not a book we necessarily need!

Maireagh has wandered off browsing, so Temo tries his luck finding something Renwick might like. Perhaps *recent* history, since he's stuck in his tower. Investigation 12+14->26, he finds "The Dessarin Digest - A Year In Pictures, 1491". It's very well made and presented; meant for collection, it seems. The drawings are often cartoon-like, political or social commentary; captions talk about the related news event or similar. 25gp. The layout is chronological, across the calendar year. Some of it is celebratory; "Heroes Return!" from the war - and some of it is quite spiky - a Lord's Alliance member standing near a dragon's hoarde, a loaded cart and "My Share" written, then a tiny handout to a farmer, "Your Share" - "The Spoils Of The Dragon War Divided Evenly Along The Sword Coast!" He shows Riglan who likes it for a few reasons, not least it being his 100th birthday, and he flips through to try and find what happened on the day (as best can judge it) that he was at his tribe being sent out into the world.

It's interesting to see the book's description of strange events from when we were dealing with the cults. "Mountains Visible Again", for when the weather cleared; "Strange Rains", "Fire At High Forest!" - but nothing really too factual. It's an insight into how people that don't know what's really going on, but still the effects, interpret things.

Riglan pays 35gp for the first and last book and gives Eskilindrar an extra 1gp ("consider it a donation!") for being allowed to read the page. Maireagh has struck metaphorical (and spent 50 literal) gold - for two books, technical works mostly of engineering focus; one on constructing devices, another on rare metals.



### 6:30pm-ish

Outside, Temo asks - "Wait. So, if Renwick were killed, he'd reform right next to his brother? In the crypt?" Riglan muses - "Yes... But *in Summit Hall* and that would be very bad if discovered; the Paladins and Knights would surely detect that magic and immediately attack - very possibly dying themselves as a result, since Renwick's power is very strong."

When discussing money and spend, Temo gets withdrawn again. "It still bothers me - a bit - we have (and whispers) over 20,000 in there - how many families could that feed or help?" - we'll need to solve that, once this is all over and we know what we've got left. We still have no idea what kind of costs for magic items, magical transport or other things we might need.

It's going dark; sun has set, twilight. A balmy spring evening. Lights everywhere, people on the streets drinking and eating happily; the Grand Dame down on the docks is fully lit up and visible from very far away.

As is apparently traditional in festivals across the sword coast, "food on sticks" is popular. Ball-shaped meat, with various sauces. We put on the garlands - Maireagh is convinced only because it stops the garland sellers! 

We convince Temo that it's not burning someone else's future money (too badly) to visit Halassa's. There is inevitably a special drink prepared for the festival. There are large stands outside with bench seating and we sit there, amongst the crowds. Maireagh relents as long as we sit on a small circular table so we're just by ourselves! She pulls out a new book and starts to read.

Temo fetches four of the special drinks; light and bubbly. Large, cold, fizzy tankard full - 2sp ea is expensive but it's actually really interesting. There are leaves and herbs inside and, of course, it is garnished with flowers. Lemony, floral, minty. "Made Specially For The Spring Festival 1492" - there are, again, t-shirts. Déja-vu. Special commemorative mugs. Temo hesitates at those, but his hands are full with the drinks... Wisdom saving 17+1 - he realises the design is suspiciously similar to our existing mugs, just with a new date. It's not too surprising - that's the difference between a tourist and being a local!

Riglan says, "If we're doing stuff, like, in towns for fun, Maireagh - I know you come along to these things for us - but what can we do for you, sometimes? What would you do on an evening like this?"

"But we *do* what I like - often. We go exploring, delving into old ruins, finding things that have been hidden for ages. Old Owlbear Keep is my ideal situation! An excavation of an ancient Netherese treasury, of knowledge and findings. These are the things that I love. I travel with you and I discover new things and I learn... I'm just really into the accumulation of knowledge. Deepen my understanding of things. If we head to the East? That in itself is almost a worthy cause alone! The things we might see and learn... Who knows. Who knows what's out there!"

Riglan says, "Well, it sounds like we're going to be delving deeper into Netherese society and relics in particular. But I hope you know - if it were you, or indeed Temo who'd been drawn into that realm - the remaining three of us would've come running just as fast." Maireagh smiles and nods.

Yeah, we *all* know.

We discuss next steps. A Seer to find a Seer? We're interrupted by a lot of noise and cheering as this strange pedal-driven wheeled contraption is pulled out - where pedalling seems to both move this strange contraption, and cause beer to flow out of nozzles connected to barrels of beer. Lots more cheering.

Riglan looks at Temo. "Even after all we've been through - stuff like that is just weird. Does that make sense to you?!" "I guess so! I think it's just a very sort of... Unnecessarily involved way of drinking... I kind of feel like trying it out sometime..."

Riglan says, "OK, so, Maireagh - dwarven ale? Nethza, lager?" - but in fact all want the new special drink, so Riglan fetches the second round. Apparently half price for refills! Win.

We wander away - more food on sticks (1sp in total for both, it's cheap). As it gets late, since we have to return to the Griffon anyway, Riglan asks if we can go to Aneeria at Wallheim's. He brings a tankard of "special drink". It's not potion but she might like to turn it into one? Who knows. Food on sticks too.

We head up and see if it's open. The light's on but the sign isn't changed. Riglan knocks. "We're closed!" Riglan shouts, "It's Riglan again - social call this time!" and we're ushered inside. We thank her for the spell, an overwhelming success and offer gifts of festival things. She hasn't tried them but had wanted to - she kinda likes festivals she says, but can't go (she thinks) because of her appearance.

Food sticks first - she seems to enjoy them, though we do notice some rather fearsome, very real, very sharp teeth. The fizzy drink is nice too but she's not sure how to drink it ("Won't you just swell up?!") but once she learns that burping is OK, she's fine.

General chat. She doesn't live here; it's a physical manifestation of the pocket dimension in which she actually lives. It's part of the Fey Wild. "Fascinating place" says Riglan. "Never been directly, but always wanted to see it."

We talk about the spell again; how interesting it was, what we learned; the size of the desert. We're reminded of Silverymoon and want to head out, to find the Silverymoon people. Aneeria comments that it won't be easy but Temo says, "You have a me!" and figures he can find them.

We wrap things up, hope it won't be so long til another social visit - and we'll bring food and drink next time too, but for all of us so it's more inclusive! - thank her again and head outside. Temo muses about where they might be - probably staying in the Pipe, but that's too easy! - and, in the end, surmises that perhaps elves have left Silverymoon because they want things Silverymoon doesn't offer, or frowns upon. That actually leads him to things like gambling - not the highbrow places. Coin Toss perhaps. It ends up costing about 5gp in bribes with a 26 investigation - not the Coin Toss - but in fact, the Wink & Kiss. After some bribery - "I will tell you this - they *are* after a bit of excitement - but not in town! And they won't be back in town until close to sunrise." Ah. **They're on the Dame**. "Tomorrow will be very interesting for them though - have you not seen the stand they've set up outside of the Water Baron's hall for the Great Convocation? A sort of career day. They're here from the University of Silverymoon with a prospectus to sell the university."

Temo lights up - "Perfect!" he shouts. "Maireagh - you're the learned kind; if ever there was someone who want to study more about the Netherese at Silverymoon...!" And we've a school too. Student exchange, or post-graduate study... Many, many possible conversations that'll get them hooked in.

With that, we're done! It's late, we're tired, it's been a really good day and we crash out in the Griffon. We're lucky to have got the room in retrospect, given how full town is. Perhaps it being a bit further away from the hustle & bustle of Market and surroundings helped.

D20->10. Temo wakes up in the middle of the night, needing the bathroom. As he does so, he notices Maireagh is awake. "Are you OK?" She's sat watching Nethza, with the dog, in a chair. "I couldn't get back to sleep after I woke up. Why are you awake?!" "Bathroom!" "Ah. Well I started to get worried about Nethza. I kept thinking about when she would have these sleepwalking things. I dunno. I just got worried that she'd start sleepwalking again. But to be fair, she's never done it here. Don't worry about me." Temo gives a *short* hug - she doesn't like them - and says, "I'm sure she sleeps more restfully, with you watching over her" and heads to the bathroom.



## Day 26, mid-spring, after equinox - Yartar

Maireagh has slept in the chair. The rest of us wake up at similar times. Riglan notices Maireagh in the chair and looks like he's about to ask her about it, but Temo touches his arm, just shakes his head and whispers, "It's fine".

### 9am (Yartar)

Maireagh makes tea. They don't even have a kettle in the room, but we have the camping one and uses Prestidigitation to warm the water. While drinking, Riglan spends time recalling his Water Walk spell as we'll need that to cross the river. We figure we'll tree-travel to Summit Hall and cross from there. Meanwhile, Marieagh warms up some of the over-bought baked goods from yesterday, which livens them up nicely.

First, Silverymoon; later, the archives - there may be another day or two yet to wait; and of course, Renwick.

### Around 10am (Yartar)

With that all done, we head out to hunt for Silverymoon's stand. It's at the ad hoc compound set up near the Waterbaron's Hall. "The Fayre Of All Fayrun", declares a banner; 8 stands for 8 different places. Not *quite* all Feyrun! Triboar, Longsaddle, "Visit Nesmé", Silverymoon, Daggerford - huh, we remember *that* the Shadowfell; Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate and finally, Gauntlgrim - a little unusual but it makes Maireagh happier ("Newly Reclaimed!" says a sign). Riglan says to Maireagh, "You know, when this is all over, we should visit there." 

Silverymoon is set up like a tent, with a tall spire-like mounting at the front, with a shiny-looking silvery star. People outside beckon us in! It's full of potted plants. Riglan chuckles. He heads over to one. "Do they treat you well?" he asks one, as subtly as he can. "I did not like being moved here. It seemed like a long journey." Riglan asks, "Are you healthy or can I help with something?" "I like it outdoors. But we have been outdoors. I am OK."

There are 8 Silverymoon people here. Three are elves, a couple of half-elves and one gnome, two humans. Riglan approaches one of the elves. He can speak regular Elvish; high Elvish, after the High Forest adventures; or through his staff, Ancient Elvish. Insight 17+10. Their dialect is High. Sun elves? So Riglan chooses that. "Greetings. We have a scholarly insight in the Netherese, and believe you may be able to assist?" Maireagh casts Guidance as Riglan is trying to be persuasive. A very good adv persuasion roll! 19+4, +2 for Guidance -> 25. Riglan sees their confusion. "Despite my young age and race, I have had respectful and mutually beneficial interactions with royal Elves in the High Forest. I realise my question is a difficult one, but hope you can help."

The response is understandably somewhat aloof. "Ah, you've had dealings with royalty of the *wood* elves." Riglan nods, "Yes - and I understand." "But you misunderstand our confusion. It is the topic that you have very forwardly approached us with." "I apologise for my lack of protocol." "What makes you feel we deal or dabble in Netherese magic?" Riglan explains that it's not about magic, as Temo steps in, introduces himself, reinforces the *scholarly* insight that we're claiming to be after, and describes briefly that he and Nethza have a small school in Deepgarden Keep.

At this, they say that we might want to speak in fact to their colleague, a representative from Silverymoon's university. She is standing over by a small stand within the tent. "Learn magic from Feyrun's oldest academy of the Magical Arts, in Silverymoon!" says a sign. Temo nods and says, "Certainly, thank you". Nethza and Temo head over to that stand.

Riglan says, "Yes, so we are trying to study and find out more about the empire; where its artefacts might lie, not for ourselves, but because we know that people want to find them for nefarious means and we wish to intervene to stop them." "That is of course the *standard* story!" responds one. They explain that it's not salty! It's easy to be corrupted by that level of power. Riglan remembers falling under Drown's thrall. They say it's about ancient magic - but point to Riglan's staff and say he's no stranger to that! They ask how he came to own it. Riglan is happy to hand it over for them to examine, so they take it, make various chants; Riglan can hear it responding. At least this gains their trust, because the spirit of the staff spoke to him.

In the end, they offer to petition the council of mages on our behalf to be given library access to study this topic. It might not work, but they'll try.

"It is a humbling thing, to be reminded of and confronted of one's fallibilities; that I must not get close to such power again. And yet, you offer to petition on my behalf. How can I repay you?"

They say that "speaking" to the staff was reward enough. This "artefact" carries "a sliver of ancient songs that have not been sung in these lands for generations of our people. The last time those words and that melody played across the land, the sun was young." "It is perhaps an older thing that even I thought. Know then that if anyone at Silverymoon wishes to hear that song, they are welcome; it would be my pleasure, and the staff's too, I think."

"We depart back to Silverymoon at sunset tomorrow." "May we join you?" "Yes. Will you be ready to come with us? For we are not travelling by caravan..." "I think I understand - we'll have to be ready, so we'll make it work." "Then if you would meet us at this location?" - and they hand Riglan an address of Tower of Learning (the school). "Appropriate! We shall be there for sunset tomorrow."

Meanwhile, Temo and Nethza are chatting. Unaware that Riglan has done quite well, but also that university access is kind of important to *reach* the library, Temo does what he can. Reintroduces himself, talks about his school briefly. He can of course only speak Common to this recruiter, as he doesn't speak Elvish. Temo insight 19+1 -> 20 (!), he notices Nethza reacting the same as him; almost offended by the things being asked, until he catches himself and realises that it's not personal. Their choice of words can be very direct especially in a different language. (He thinks via Message to Nethza, "Take no offence; she speaks in words not of her native tongue, and as an elf, is simply very blunt").

With that, he does best to answer; to acknowledge weaknesses, thank her for insights - even negative ones - that might help us improve things for our students. Questions of learning, philosophy, entrance exams vs giving people a chance; in the end she says she'd like to visit one day. Temo's genuinely excited; and in turn, would like to visit her school. Adv persuasion is a whopping 31! We exchange details.

Her name is **Nivellin**, Admission's Officer.

She explains that the University is the umbrella organisation for all of the individual schools of arts, law, magic and so-on. So we thank her and at this point Riglan and Maireagh come over. Marieagh's actually quite cheerful - she's understood enough that the journey will be made and is very keen to visit. We catch up, and it's good - we have a possible way to the library, but if nothing else, definitely a way to the school.

**Learning this, Nivellin is even more enthusiastic. We can be shown around the campus, see what the entrance exams are like and be able to prepare our students - should we wish - to sending them up to Silverymoon as a "what next" step.**

Other people have been coming in and out during this time; it's not the most popular pavilion given its rather singular focus, but the more "bookish" types are definitely interested. A father and daughter; "Maybe some day you might go here!" - that kind of thing. Aspirations.

After about an hour, we head out.

Riglan says, "Well, I'm not sure that are too many ways that could've gone better! But we have to be here tomorrow at sunset, so we need to have wrapped up stuff in Yartar as best we can as I doubt we'll come back through here unless we must. And I can make sure I remember a tree up there so we can get back for your school stuff if need be."

Riglan hum's and ha's for a while, figuring out travel times. "I think we can do it... Today... We'd have to come back tomorrow morning... But we could get to Summit Hall and walk over the river to the monastery, catch up with Renwick, give our archivist friend a bit more time then pick things up that day and get ready for sunset departure. We'd not be using our 3rd night at the Griffon but that's OK."

Nethza points out that she has a teleportation circle here too, so we could get back the same day if we wanted. Not bad!

"To the trees!" says Riglan and marches off! We head to the Charnel House / graveyard, where there's a big elm near a crypt. Riglan whispers to it for a while, then it opens up in the freaky way they do and we step through, emerging in Summit Hall's garden - unannounced, of course.

### Around 11:30am (Summit Hall)

The young monks are very surprised! Riglan calls out, "Sorry, sorry, we're friends, we've been here before!" A monk runs off, presumably to fetch the Knight Commander.

Suddenly Riglan goes, "oh!" and looks surprisingly upset, or at least emotional; his eyes tear up a bit. "Wow. That hits hard... When we were last here, after Teresiel, collecting the books... Was the *end* of something. This brings it all back."

Lady Ushien arrives outside, a squire running behind her, trying to help her as she's hastily throwing on armour. "Oh my goodness! It's been - what?!" she says upon seeing us. Looks at the four of us, scowls at first! "Where have you been?!" then smiles and holds Riglan's shoulders, "WELCOME back! A very strange way to enter. I daresay you frightened the living daylights out of our young monks."

"Walk with me" she says. "You might find this interesting and illuminating!"

As we walk she asks what's happened and Riglan summarises. By the end, we're up on parapets (and invited to lunch!).

"The Knights Of Samilar are dying a slow death. The death of Restful Sleep - there is nothing left for them to do. They don't have a purpose. I am not getting any younger. It is getting increasingly difficult to hold this order together, for they have no holy mission. And what are paladins, without a holy mission? We are attracting monks; those looking for a reclusive escape from the world; and I've never been against that - for decades, it kept us alive. But without a fire in the hearth, the halls grow cold."

The TL;DR is that they need a crusade, and they'll align with ours. They will head east and rest at Cormyr. We will get Scrolls of Sending to contact them.

"Well, whatever your perspective Lady Ushien, from mine, this means the world. I consider myself in your debt."

She smiles and says, "Thank you. We serve the same tenets of justice and divine righteousness!" Riglan just nods.

Riglan sees almost a new lease of life in her; it's interesting; her whole demeanour has changed; she's thinking hard about how to prepare. Riglan laughs, and says, "Even though the adventures of the road can be very dangerous, I cannot deny the delight of commencing an adventure anew."

We reach the dining hall. A humble lunch - which is of course amazing, everything grown in the garden. And at this very lunch, Lady Ushien makes the announcement.

"Old allies, dear friends, have come bearing tidings of clouds gathering on the horizon. We known not what these clouds will bring. We only know that we rally to the call, as we have in times gone by. **But the Knights Of Samilar heed the call of the worthy and the needy.** I require **six knights and six squires** to embark upon the **Fifth Crusade Of Samilar** under the banner of Karadoon. I shall lead this crusade. Who shall come with me? We head to the East; we ride towards the sunrise, to the lands of our forefather, towards the birth countries of the Sword Coast. I cannot guarantee that all will return, but I guarantee this - that your blood will be filled with the fervour of youth; that you shall feel purpose like you have never felt before; that you will forge, in the fires of battle and hardship, bonds of brotherhood and family which form the very basis of our order."

Around the table, one by one, young knights stand. "Knight Commander, I shall ride with you" - "And I" - "I too!" - "We shall ride with you as well" - a cascade. It takes mere seconds for a full compliment of twelve.

The room is filled with an expectant spirit of adventure to come; Ushien smiles knowingly at us. People head off to duties or to prepare for the new crusade. Ushien comes to us. "You mentioned you had other things you needed to do. I will not hold you. But I look forward to hearing from you." "It may be some weeks." "Yes! It will take us time to get there. Ah! To see the outside world once more - to see how much it has changed; what lies in wait for an old Knight on the road?"

Temo pulls out his Bag Of Tricks. He explains it briefly and hands it over. "But this is precious to you!" she says. **He answers, "So are you."**

We depart, marching out of the gates with newfound hope. A sweet smell of spring flowers in the hills fills the air. Riglan leads us towards the river by the most direct route he can find.

### Some time after midday

We reach the banks. The day is clear and it's easy to see a distance up and downriver, as well as across. Small waves from gentle wind. No ships in sight; Riglan casts Water Walk. Off we go, marching nonchalantly across the water! The other shore is quickly reached.

It's been around a year since we were last here, although we skipped through a few months of that in the Shadow Fell - yet in some ways feels like a lifetime ago. In practice the territory is very familiar and we make good time.

### 2pm (old Earth Cult monastery)

The monastery looks *significantly* abandoned now. It's not tidy and swept; it shows the onset of disrepair and weeds have grown up already, including some grasses already growing between the flagstones and a year's worth of ivy climbs calls. Animals have found their way in; birds and lizards mostly. The main doors are at least shut. Temo tries the main front door; it doesn't yield to a push, so Riglan leans a shoulder in (athl 15) and between us we get one side open. Plants have grown in the hinges! They're rusting already, too.

A couple of pairs of eyes glint from shadows in the sun, then something scurries away. Small mammals of some kind. We push the door back shut and make our way to the corner with Renwick's tower, hoping he still resides there. At Renwick's tower, there is the familiar door; it's lock of course; Temo tries pointing his finger up at the room where Renwick normally is and casting Message. D20 for luck; 14; the spell seems to work. Soon after, a croaky thought responds...

"Ugh. What? This is unexpected! I'll get the door!..." - the door creaks open; dark inside - "...come in!" and we head inside.

Two flames light up in sconces, probably magical. Riglan thanks Renwick for the light. Sat in a chair, in the dark, is Renwick. He doesn't seem to be doing much - not at his desk upstairs. "Sorry if we are interrupting anything" says Riglan. "I was just lost in thought!" responds Renwick; draws a sigil in the air with a skeletal finger; "...it appears I have been in thought for a while; what can I do for you? Why have you come to seek me?"

Riglan says, "well two things. It is I admit not a social call, but we did also wonder how you were; if you enjoyed the peace and quiet with the cult gone; and we brought you a book!"

He slowly gets out of the chair, "I haven't moved in a long time..." and as he gets up, a bone breaks! He reaches over sideways and a beautiful carved ebony wood staff flies across the room into his hand. He fiddles with the staff a little and an aura of magic cascades over him; he looks rejunvinated! Rags seem to knit and stitch together and his body fills out. Bones mend. He seems to breathe as he lets out a gasp of relief and dust flies out of his mouth. Two blue lights appear in the hollows of his eyes as his face fills out. It takes about 15 seconds.

"Yes. It's been a while - I haven't moved for months! I was lost in a thought experiment; you've brought me something, you said?"

Temo produces "The Dessarin Digest - A Year In Pictures, 1491".

"I haven't seen one of these in an extremely long time!" he says. "They still do these? Interesting. I didn't think anyone would read these anymore. Thank you! I guess I should be hospitable...?"

He waves a hand around and unseen servants bring things out. "Yes. You're all still alive; you need sustenance!" and Riglan chuckles. Tea and drinks appear. "I don't have anything for you to eat; it would've spoiled by now!" "Oh, this is fantastic, thank you". He looks at the book a while and we sit, drinking tea as he spends some time.

We get down to business, telling him about Rex and asking what questions we can think of.

* Finding the phylactory and/or destroying it would be harder than tackling him directly. There's no magic to detect it.
* He's essentially immortal; any lich is; as long as the phylactory exists, he can always returns.
* His powers in undeath will depend on his powers in life beforehand.
* The process of becoming a lich is complex, very expensive, difficult and requires great sacrifice. Only those of great strong character and constitution survive it intact.
* It can wreak havoc on someone's mind, but not all liches are highly intelligent; some are acquire power by other means; study - Renwick says he did it that way - others, experimentation; some are gifted the process; some turned against their will. Renwick learned about the process himself *after* he was turned.

"I'm afraid that if you came here to defeat a lich, I must disappoint you; there is likely no-one who can tell you that! But I do have something that might be helpful; 'lich' is a term given by those who are alive. **It is used to describe any of a very complex and unrelated set of conditions** which can be achieved by very different means and possibly don't bear that much arcane resemblance to each other. It is merely a term that has been given by those trying to understand and categorise a set or series of phenomena. The only commonality that I believe is true, based on what I have learned - and this is but one opinion and one point of view only - is that all liches have a phylactory. But even that may not be true."

* We are reminded that severing one's immortal soul and hiding it in an object is the basis for the phylactory and Renwick thinks it likely that all liches share this, though again he reminds us that this is only his opinion.

"Thank you for the tea. You are a lich; undead; and I am a druid; I should consider you unnatural, an abomination. But instead, what I see sitting in front of me is a friend."

"You are it seems not aware there are lich druids? As I said, there are many paths to lichdom. **Perhaps observe the nature that you work with more closely and more broadly.** Even in our corner of the world, there exist at least four plants of which I am aware, and two insects, that are in a sense immortal. They undergo in their lifecycle a form of rejuvenation; of rebirth. That is not too different from lichdom; most of the magics that we practice are influenced by what we see and the most readily available source of inspiration is surely our natural world. Some plants propagate by cloning themselves, so to speak, as a new vessel, well before the old vessel dies. On the surface, it simply looks like one plant eventually dies and another has grown. In reality, under the ground, some of these plants are the *same* plant that has continued to exist and has not in fact died. Not at all."

"Such a plant would be fascinating to converse with. We should leave you in peace I think."

"It is always a pleasure to have company - to discuss and talk about things. But, yes, I understand; time is precious to you because it is a finite resource. I appreciate that which you have spent with me. Thank you for the book and good luck with find your quarry. If I remember anything, or stumble upon anything about this Azalin Rex of whom you speak - **though I suspect they probably went by another name!** - I will make a point to notify you. Would you like that?"

"Most surely."

"Do you trust me?" He uses Mage Hand to pull a small vial. "If you trust me, put a small amount of blood in this vial and I'll be able to contact you through it."

Riglan doesn't hesitate - he complies. A tiny etching of Riglan's name is magically placed on the vial - "...so I remember whose this is!" and it is sent back to a chest full of other small vials.

"Neat trick! Thank you. Until next time."

And with that we head out. Behind us, Renwick has sat back down, pulled the book over; he waves, the lights dim, the door shuts and plants seem to immediately grow back over it, making it look as if unused for many years.

"Curious conversation; one to continue one day, if I live! Nethza, time to portal?"

"I don't feel comfortable doing it here! Can we go outside? I feel like - all of 'this' - is sort of his house. Is there anything else you wanted to do while you were here?"

Riglan humm's and haa's for a while but can't think of anything. He'd like to see the Summit Hall ride-out but we don't know when that's happening and it might very well be days away!

Nethza casts her spell and takes us to, as yet, her only known circle; we're back at Yartar, in the magic school. There is, once again, a certain degree of chaos! More apologies, excuses and explanations are required, but eventually we're downstairs.
