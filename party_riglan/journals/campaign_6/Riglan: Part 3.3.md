# Riglan: Part 3.3
## Day 9 ("day" 6 in Shadowfell, day 5 of 15-day cycle)

We wake up at the inn near Chateau Fahrlay, after an unexpected and revealing encounter with the vampire duke and his human wife.

Riglan tries again to remember the piece of clothing that he saw in the vision; when was it last seen?! History - nat 1! So total 5; nah. No idea. This might risk becoming of an obsession, since the inability to remember it makes it seem more significant than it truly might be.

Anyway, we haven't much choice. We get breakfast at the inn to avoid pull on rations too much - but the innkeeper doesn't charge us; they've heard we were "guests" of the Lord and Lady and are suddenly very polite and deferential. We thank them very much and double-check, surely we should pay? They say His Lordship was looking after it and he wished us a safe journey and good fortune on our path.

Wished a safe journey by a vampire? Good thing Riglan met Renwick and managed to get *some* semblance of perspective on the possibilities of positive interactions with undead, or he'd be headed directly to therapy.

Maireagh has her riding cloak on. It's colder. Riglan's OK, he's furry but Temo agrees with Maireagh and puts on a heavier cloak too, all our fine clothes are of course put away and we're in our usual adventuring kit. We get the horses and continue on the road to Citeaux.

We might not be too far behind the Vistani, we elect try a gallop for an hour, though Slasher moans a bit at the idea and does fall behind so Riglan has Snow White ease up. After an hour we slow right down but hopefully closed some gap.

### The sun eventually rises; that makes it by our estimation around 10am

There are some gnarly-looking orchards around. Old trees, not in great health but it looks like they at least probably bore fruit this season. People work fields of wheat and barely. Occasionally, there are somewhat skinny - though not skeletal - farm animals grazing. The road eventually moves away from the river and starts to climb a rise, into low but somewhat rocky hills with occasional craggy steep edges, eventually finding a contour line route to a saddle and then begins a gentle descent again. We're entering a wooded area; the hills probably deter the farmers. A mist hangs in the depressions and dips, mostly sitting in pockets below the altitude of the road.

Out of pure curiosity, given that there's some wind yet the mist sits still, Riglan tries Detect Magic. There is indeed a moderate, lingering yet pervasive aura of necromancy, kind of hanging in the air; like a field, blanketing everything, omnipresent. Within the range he can see via his spell, it stretches out. No wonder crops do poorly. He mentions it to the others. Maireagh says, "That explains a lot. I've been feeling dour for the last couple of days, not my usual cheerful self! Just kind of tired; I'd put it down to the lack of sunlight."

Temo reminds us that yes, it does promote a feeling of hopelessness. It seems like a first line of defence, a magical way of preventing opposition.

Riglan perception 14. We go through a thick patch of mist and Riglan is feeling uneasy. It feels like eyes in all the shadows. We stop. He scrutinises the darkness of the woods; perception again, but disadvantage from the dark - yet very good rolls - 15,16+9->24. Watching a while, he thinks it's just the breeze, making the mist move, making the shadows shift and play. There's no obvious movement other than that and it can't be discounted, but there are no tracks.

Actually, even more curious, this road itself has no tracks. But it's a road - *the* road to Citeaux.

"Whatever is going on, whatever this feeling is, it's either paranoia or there's magic afoot - no tracks, no movement, yet no tracks on the road either. And I'd expect plenty. It's as if they were cleared."

Temo, flat intelligence; 14; looks behind us. "We're not leaving tracks either!"

Riglan L1 Detect Magic. Is there stronger magic than he observed before? Looking specifically at the road behind us, where fresh tracks should surely be; **there's a permanent enchantment of some kind.** Something to do with time! As if time is paused, or looped, or rewound before or after we arrive. Unsure. When disturbed, it's like this area resets itself. As for the woods, staring closely at the moving mists; the woods somehow seem to **obfuscate themselves from Detect Magic**. Wut?! A distinct absence of 'sensation' emanating from there. There's a magical silence of sorts, and now Riglan thinks about it, an animal silence too. The whole place is - paused. *That* is why he feels so uneasy.

He relays that. It's weird because the sound is dead. No tracks, ahead or behind, no animal sounds, anechoic sounds from our own travel only, almost muffled by the mist.

We figure there's little chance of us having the skills or knowledge to solve this. Maireagh wants to get out of here - yeah, agree!

About an hour later, we leave the woods. We are *very* relieved. It could be that this strange effect was another magical barrier, a deterrent perhaps to travel that way. We see a small hamlet. There are a few miles of view from here - the road descends into rolling plains. Yet, no Vistani caravan is visible. We pause for a moment. Riglan wildshapes into a hawk, in the last moments of sunlight as it casts a golden glow on the sides of buildings. Adv perception total 28, very strong roll; there are two rivers, in fact, which eventually meet up ahead, the odd pond, small stands/groves of trees but no more woods, mostly plains. A few buildings distant; towers, maybe from small churches; the odd house; and far, far ahead a number of roads meeting. There could be a caravan very distant there; a string of wagons, that *might* be the Vistani - a fair distance ahead. A good 9 miles or maybe even more.

As the Riglan hawk rises even further it hits the bottom of thick clouds. Out of curiosity once again, Riglan tries to climb much higher. No updrafts aid his flight here; has to flap hard; seems strange, a uniform thick layer over the whole of the sky. Flying into it... Wisdom saving throw! 17+9; he senses he might be leaving the plane and immediately drops back down. It's the mist! A plane boundary. He catches himself in time, just brushing the edges and bailing immediately. He dives back down, thankfully emerging close to where he entered.

So reconnaissance is difficult in this land; altitude is limited. And if the mists close in over time, perhaps the sky closes in too as the future years approach.

Coming back down, Riglan gets a better look at the nearer hamlet. Others he saw were quite - uuh - pastoral while this closer one has more stone. It even has a watchtower. Perhaps this is a safe place to take a break. He gets back to the party and suggests that - we'll ride in there, take a break, then perhaps push on after the caravan but it's perhaps unlikely we'll catch them.

A couple of shops, one for wagon repair and some leatherwork and carpentry; another is a small supply shop (very small). Around 8 houses plus the watchtower and some kind of small community hall with noticeboard. Riglan dismounts and walks up to the noticeboard. "Quietsedge Community Hall" at the top. There's a notice for exchange of baskets for wagon wheel grease! Another says that help is needed with loading and unloading, one day a week. Riglan hears sounds from inside so we tie the horses and enter.

Inside, there's a mostly bald, quite short, stocky man trying to pull a table to move it, so Riglan rushes over to help. "Oh, oh thank you! Yes, over here, I've been trying to get it over here..." (athl adv 24) "...oh! Thank you, that was so much easier. I've been wanting to move this for the last few weeks but it's very heavy, it's solid oak! The old baking sale table. You're travellers?" "We're making your way to Citeaux" "You going *to* Citeaux? You mean you came through the quiet woods?! They're very quiet. Legend has it that a sorceress, who was driven mad by spirits harassing her, whispering at her all hours of the day - a long time ago of course - went into the woods, set herself up in there and cast a powerful silencing spell over the woods every day for a year. Now it's permanent!"

Riglan asks, "Does the legend say anything about the sorceress' appearance?" "No, not really. She was one of those lightning storm sorceresses, used to have a temper, she'd bring storms and legend has it that one of the storms she brought struck and burned down a school full of a children. She's been haunted by their spirits ever since, so wracked with guilt; we don't think the spirits haunted her, so much as her own mind plaguing her with guilt. That's why she ran into the woods. She can't still be alive, the story has been passed down for generations. Some even say that a long, long time ago, she might have been one of Azalin's lovers! But I take no stock in that. He must've been a very amorous man, when alive!" - and suddenly we're talking about how undead might have sex ("...but there's no blood...") and as Temo and Riglan are both about to give good ideas, Maireagh stops us `;-)`.

Talk turns to what we're doing - looking for a friend. At this, the man says, "Oh, wait a minute!" - goes to a stairwell in the corner, pulls a lever that opens a hatch, goes up and rings some kind of bell, loudly, for quite a long time. It draws villagers, asking "**Patrick!** What's going on, why are you ringing the bell?!" He explains - and we are asked to describe our lost friend. We do so; and they all recognise her! She came through here maybe last week (so she got here really quickly somehow, or was already on this side of the woods when the time shift happened perhaps).

They say she was quite kind and helped them move things around (seems a common problem!) so it was a "Fourthsday", he says, so 5 days ago. Ah! Right after the timeshift, by our reckoning. She was in some kind of trouble and had to leave very early in the morning; one says she looked frightened? "Who saw her?" (murmers) "Jemamie?" "Yes, I think so" answers presumed-Jemamie; "I thought she was running from something. She kept looking over her shoulder as she ran out of town. She was on foot. It was odd, but 5 in the morning." She'd told another that she was following "a darkness; a calling, a voice drawing her towards the capital, but she was resisting it. She had been actively trying to go in the opposite direction."

We explain how we're headed there too; the darkness is real, it seems to be the reason for crops failing and so-on. As we say this, from behind the group an old man's voice - "I told you so. We're all going to die. This is land is dying. We're all going to die with it. No point. Everyday we roll further down the hill towards oblivion. That's what is awaiting us. All you can do is try and roll back up. But we're all boulders! Eventually, we'll make it to the bottom of that hill, all together, and all die."

Riglan explains that he thinks life and death are indeed natural and a cycle; we don't fight death; yet this strange death of the land is spreading from the centre, from Citeaux. Insight 27; he says, "I knew it! You're a rebel. You want to rise up against our undead masters!" - but he's *excited* by that. He's trying to play it safe and act like that's bad. Tow the party line in case spies are amongst us!

We explain that we're not necessarily against the *rightful* rulers. Balance, even if undead. But that's no longer the case. The influence that spreads is from something else. Some*where* else. THAT is what we intend to fight. We don't know what it is, but it certainly knows about us and has already tried to kill us! So we discuss it openly, since we're already "known".

Eventually people filter out, but we stay speaking to the old man. He has a story and we want to hear it. His strange manner is borne of frustration; of people not listening. He confirms much of what we figured. There used to be a ruling class; a balance; but not anymore. Trading caravans talk to them, in frustration; they have conflicting information, conflicting *instructions* as if no one person was really in charge anymore at Citeaux. Factions, flexing, applying different policies; the same way that known warlords have more recently vied for power and fought.

"We here, on the other side of this forest - some of the baronies have tined into fiefdoms of their own that don't even swear fealty to the crown anymore. That's something this land does not need! One ruling tyrant that everyone can oppose is one thing. A land made up of dozens of tyrants? What do you do with that?"

Riglan says, "You help that original ruling tyrant regain control by figuring out how they lost it in the first place."

He responds, "Or - or we *destroy* the patriarchy entirely and give the power back to the people!" - a nostalgic air, a mantra, something he believed when young but hasn't said in a long time. He chuckles. "That's what young people believe."

Riglan says, "I'm young. I'm only 100. And I know what you mean; ruling councils, voting, people having a say; it's not perfect, and a single ruler, who is competent and not corrupt, kind and clear of mind, can do better. But when there's just one ruler, it's too easy for things to go wrong. That's what happened here. So maybe, yes, if it came to it - if the way stop the rot was that - then that is what we would do."

The conversation wraps up. Riglan goes quiet for a bit. Patrick comes back in; "you alright?"

Riglan tries to explain; we're not from here; we experience changes in time; things *do* get worse; but we know we can make a difference, can make it better. Riglan wrestles with tackling those quiet woods - there's *something* there - or chasing Nethza. That's why he was quiet.

In the end, he resolves his quandrary. We've had the first positive, reported sighting of Nethza since the abbey (and they even remembered her name during the conversation we had with the villagers) - and that's good - yet she fled in fear - which is bad; *but* she's alive, she's moving and we're sure now that she heads to Citeaux. She has somehow gained ground on us and or all we can do, we'd always be behind her. Meanwhile, there is a chance to do good, to help people perhaps, make a brighter future, delay or damage the plans perhaps of whatever the blight upon this land might be? Does it work that way? If there's a chance - and there is a chance - then we must take it. Nethza surely knows we're coming. She'll surely hold on... we hope... and in the mean time, we can't just let people hang. We couldn't leave a dry well, or fail to rescue children, or any of the other things. And Riglan, in particular, can't just leave a whole woods/forest forced into magical silence without at least *trying* to do something.

Our plan is to ride back, about half an hour into the road - roughly central - then try some detection magic; like Commune With Nature, or similar. His staff was fully recharged at the start of the day so it has the power to conduct that spell.

So - that is exactly what we do. We leave the horses for safety with Patrick. We walk back up the road, judging the half way point; takes about an hour (it's fully dark); Riglan places the bottom edge of the staff on the ground just off the road and casts the spell. A minute later, the questions have formed in his mind:

* Prevalent people in these woods: no humans in these woods at all; very few animals sadly - a few ravens and crows, a few rodents, no large game animals; most seem to live near the edges of the spell range.
* Powerful fey, fiends etc. - Riglan **detects two undead** - one powerful, another much less so; Arcana 14+0; not a vampire, not a ghost; a strange form of undead; almost a magical life force - really quite magical in fact, slightly untethered feel to the magic forces he senses; the two seem to be related - he suspects one is the offspring of another.
* Influence from other planes - influence is detected, but is strange. The link seems to extend from more powerful undead outwards like tendrils of a plant, as if a creeper, searching for - something, something to hold onto. That might be related to the untethered feeling. It seems to mainly reach to Citeaux but is attached to nothing.

He doesn't know what most of it means - but he knows the location. Other side of the road, about a mile in; they appear to be in a dell, a little lower down that we are. We walk in.

It takes about half an hour. Riglan has cast Darkvision and Temo uses goggles. The sense of unease increases; the quietness seems to become even *more* oppressive. We can still speak to each other but it sounds very noticeably more muffled now. We wonder if magic will even work normally; Temo gives Mage Hand a go, which has verbal components and it works - but if silence became total, it would not. Next he tries something more complex; Message to Riglan. Works. It's much louder and clearer than voice, Riglan says. Finally he tries a minor illusion, which requires no verbal components. That's easy.

We figure that this is going to be akin to having a short-range Silence spell cast upon us, if the effect becomes complete.

This is unsettling. We think for a while about what Riglan and Temo can cast without voices. Just about nothing - a couple of spells each out of our entire litany. Riglan could do Primal Savagery and Ice Knife; nothing high level. Temo has Minor Illusion, Nathair's Mischief and Illusory Script. Oh dear.

We get to the edge of the misty dell where Riglan thinks the creatures reside. Our voices are muffled. Temo tries Mage Hand again. It works. That's something. Riglan says, "OK, let's try it..." and steps forward, into the misty dell.

Mist wraps around him. He hears muffled sounds, like scratching on the ground. Then we all hear in our minds, jarring - a booming voice! "WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY WOODS?" and Riglan answers, thinking loudly as well as speaking, "We heard that silence had descended upon these woods and wondered if this was something that whoever lived here might want to change; if so we come to help." But the voice repeats its question, more impatient. Riglan tries again, yelling as loudly as he can. "WHY WOULD YOU REMOVE MY PEACE?" Riglan asks, "But why would you bring silence upon the land?" "TO QUIET THE VOICES" "Did it work?" "I HAVE PEACE."

At this, the mist in front thins enough to see, standing in front of us, a shrivelled husk of what was once perhaps a very fancily-dressed, velvet embroidered cloak-wearing woman, but it all is rotting and falling apart; remnants of presumed thick locks of black hair, gaunt face, sunken eyes, pupils replaced by a pinprick of blue light hovering in the middle of the eye sockets. One skeletal hand appears to have waved a gesture that parted the mist. The other holds the hand of a young girl; pallid, sallow, sunken features, maybe 8 or 9 years old, who grasps an old, somewhat ragged/damaged doll by the arm. The child has the same sunken eyes with the blue lights. Both undead.

We see her mouth move. Sounds given her degraded physical condition aren't words, just sort of rattling. It's the telepathy that gives the message. "What are your intentions here? Speak while I have patience."

Riglan starts to talk about the "very sad story" of the sorceress who retreated to the woods after a calamity; her eyes flare, wind starts to swirl, bits of earth start to lift; Temo tries to smooth it over but persuasion 4+13 -> 17 doesn't do anything. Suddenly a tree uproots, gale force winds tear at us, swirling like a cyclone. Riglan insight 26; he thinks she has been doing everything in her power to come to the woods and get away from whatever it was that had been destroying her. She'd found a place that was hers, controlled the environment - and we've brought what she was running from into her space.

Temo tries shouting through the storm, "You don't have to exist away from people. You don't have to hide. You can't run from your past, you must confront it. Nobody gets through life without mistakes. Tell us your story."

"YOU DON'T KNOW! YOU WERE NOT THERE!" and a lightning bolt slams into us! "HOW DARE YOU COME INTO MY WOODS AND DO THIS TO ME!"

Riglan dex save 8+0 (doh), Temo 18 (and he has Evasion - no damage), Maireagh nat 20. Riglan takes 33 damage, Maireagh takes 16.

Temo shouts again. "Then tell us! You say we do not know; tell your story. Confront your past! It is the only way to truly escape it! You and your daughter can have a brighter future!" - it is to no avail. In fact if anything (Riglan insight 17) **it's just pushing her further into fury**.

Initiative!

* Temo 17
* Riglan 16
* Maireagh 14

Temo feels he has no choice but to attack. Too much wind for arrows; he still somehow wants to avoid an all-out battle, there's a mother *and child* even if undead; he tries Hold Person, Wis DC15 - she fails! She's held, briefly. He calls out, "I'm sorry, we don't want to fight, please, just talk to us!" and then darts to one side, to try and hide behind a log. Stealth only 19.

Riglan now acts too. He wants to give them other things to focus upon; L5 Conjure Animals, four of CR1, hoping to avoid flight creatures given the wind but he'll take whatever he can get given the frightening and sudden escalation before him! The casting is complete and, partially surrounding the two undead on the opposite side of them to us, appear four giant spiders. That seems appropriate for this domain! He drops in the bear totem in the middle, 17 temp HP all round for the spiders (34 given his Mighty Summoner feat, plus 17).

Riglan calls to the spiders that he wants to avoid bloodshed; they throw webs. The first misses the child but the other hits and restrains her. Another web hits the woman so the fourth needs take no further action. The undead mother tries to save from Temo's hold spell but fails. Maireagh runs up to about 20ft range with the dog, and prepares an attack action in case she succeeds!

The child shakes her mother's hand and her eyes flare brightly as she mouths some incantation. She dispels Temo's Hold Person spell. She looks around, her hands being held a bit with the web; she tries to throw a bolt of sickly blueish-green energy from her mouth instead, aiming at the person she can see closest - Maireagh. She misses, though, due to the web's disadvantage.

The storm has died down a little. Temo tries to persuade her again, but his weapon is drawn defensively and she's surrounded; it comes off as intimidating. And with a roll of 5, total 10 for intimidation, it fails. She isn't having any of it and shouts back in rage about how *we* are the intruders. It's true, but we're in this and the woods are kinda screwed as-is... Temo fires, with advantage from the web; hits, 26 damage and she loses concentration on her storm spell. All manner of chunks of tree, leaf, stone, even small boulders fall to the ground, fortunately mostly outside of the area we're in as we'd moved within the radius.

Riglan says, "We don't want to do this!" and lowers his staff, but it doesn't work either (persuasion nat 1!), she rants again and he elects to use the lighting wand. DC15 dex, disadv., but she makes it anyway (just). Terrible damage roll anyway, 19->9 damage. Riglan has miscalculated though - he burns his own web; but the spiders are next and he shouts "try to take down the mother". Two spiders move in and bite, for 9 and max 11 damage; a third for 7; the fourth tries another web, hitting her once more.

The enraged mother grabs hold of her daughter - and disappears with Dimension Door.

Riglan knows they can't be *too* far with that spell. He asks the spiders to search and meanwhile casts Speak With Plants to ask the trees, asking them to pass on a message and see if any know where they are.

Spider perception rolls - 13, 3, 14, 17.

Within the 10 minutes that Riglan's spell lasts, the plants give an indication of where they are; a full 500ft away, one spider also finding their location - a small stone hut. We can pursue. "I didn't want it to go this way but I feel it must be finished one way or another" - and we head towards them.

Shortly thereafter, we're close. Temo heads around one side but can't see them. Riglan heads another, using Misty Step; he calls out the location and once again says, "We are sorry, we do not want to keep fighting, will you not talk to us?"

This time - persuasion is only +3, but it's nat 20.

"STOP ATTACKING ME THEN!" she shouts.

Riglan calls back, "I promise. As a show of good faith, I will dispel the giant spiders". Riglan turns, thanks them, and ends the spell.

Her and the daughter walk out. "Very well. Speak. Why have you intruded onto my woods?"

There is some to-and-fro. Rightly, they are worried about people rising up against them in fear. Especially the "abomination that is my child". So we discuss options; bunnies and meadows? No! Riglan suggests frightening things. Yes - ravens, crows; bats, snakes; maybe giant spiders, even wolves. That way the people are scared of the woods for conventional reasons but less likely to be curious, as we are. But there is a compromise - nobody has ever been hurt on the road along the woods; scared, but she never attacks. With the introduction of wild beasts, there's a chance of a lone traveller falling to harm.

That is balance; that's nature. It's bad, of course, but it's the way things are. Riglan's neutrality shines.

She removes a talisman from her neck and pulls out a wand made of walnut wood. "Spread this news to Quietsedge: That you found my bones and I passed peacefully. That you have interred me, and said last rites; and here is the proof..." (she hands him the talisman and the wand) "...may I pass into memory and disappear quietly from the world." She says she has transcended past the need of wands or talismans. Riglan asks that he feels there's something we should do for her in return; she simply reiterates that we should honour our part of the deal. Convince them that there's nothing to look for her. "Let us live in peace." Of course, Riglan agrees, pledges to do it.

We trudge off, ultimately none the wiser, but the woods will have at least life of a form. We understand her now. Seen too much to ever trust people and we can't argue against her points. We head back to the road and then on to Quietsedge.

It's mid-evening. 6 or 7pm. Maireagh says, "It's a very strange feeling. To feel like we've achieved something and yet I have to ask myself what have we achieved in light of what we aimed to achieve? We did actually do *something*."

Riglan says he's perhaps let his ego grow too much. Felt he could solve anything. Didn't even have a clear idea of outcome.

Temo is quiet. Insight 18+1. Riglan looks older. In a wise way. Holds himself a bit differently somehow.

At Quietsedge, we relay the story and thank them for looking after the horses. They encourage us to sleep in the town hall rather than travelling further tonight. Once again, they turn to talk of changing the name of the woods or the town! Wild Woods? Fearsome Woods? Woods Of Death?! They kind of settle on Dark Woods, and Darksedge? "No, even better!" exclaims one. "Why not Last Light?" - nice ring to it, positive and friendly. Why not.

We set up camp rolls in the town hall and eventually people head off to their houses; we sleep.

### 2000XP each



## Day 10 ("day" 7 in Shadowfell, day 6 of 15-day cycle)

Four D20 rolls requested: 9, 17, 19, 9.

We awaken. It's still dark but there's activity outside; the hamlet is waking up. We pack ready for departure. It's still strange to be getting up in the dark, under the half-moon, being wished "good morning!"

Off we go. The terrain is familiar for a while, since Riglan has seen it from overhead. After the river, about half way through the day as the sun rises, there's an architectural change in the buildings. Best way to describe it? More money. Nicer estates, now we're a few miles away from the woods. 15 miles from Quietsed - uuh - Last Light, we start to see little chapels, with orchards, or hop gardens, or similar. There's still some decay evident in growth, but that said, it's not the sparsely populated countryside of earlier. More people around. Every few miles now, there is another small hamlet; each looks like it is 2 or 3 streets wide, a few houses, a bigger central building, chapels on the outskirts.

The road improves too. By the end of the day, we'd prefer to find a camp site - something outside, where we couldn't be seen - to set up the Tiny Hut, but here, there are just fields and streets and houses. We are fortunately able to find one abandoned building, though and set up the hut there.



## Day 11 ("day" 8 in Shadowfell, day 7 of 15-day cycle)

Towards the day's end, we reach a larger settlement. It's one of the biggest we've seen in this strange land - bigger than Chateau Fahrlay, for sure. The town is called **Miyiteri**. A decent inn, stables for the horses with fresh feed, good cooked food, comfortable beds and baths. We even go to a local tavern, which is polite and civilised. Some here work trades or service jobs, rather than working the land. Quite a change of pace.

People seem less - hopeless. But there's still an air of difficulty. It's not long until we pick up bits of conversation; "...it'll pass; the difficult times will pass, just you see. Things happen in cycles. This has happened before! We'll be fine" - and so-on. We socialise a bit - casual chat to different groups. There are two camps. The "this will be fine" group and another who think the "central government" (at Citeaux) don't know what they're doing - distrust; these people often have stories from further afield about how bad things are getting. They're more in touch. A "second year of crop failures" and so-forth.

4gp across inn and tavern.



## Day 12 ("day" 9 in Shadowfell, day 8 of 15-day cycle)

Another uneventful journey. This is another bigger town, beautiful stone buildings, built into the side of a mountain, roads climbing up in terraces and buildings climbing the slopes. "**King's Pass**". It seems like there's only one road, a mountain pass, is the only way to go to Citeaux and this runs through the fortified, guarded gates of the town. You *have* to travel through.

It takes a moment for us to *be* surprised at seeing dwarves here. It's a normal sight for us, but not since we entered the Shadow Fell; here, there had been none until this first sighting at King's Pass.

Inside, we have an option of a fine, moderate or modest inn. It seems the higher-end people are more out of touch, so we go with modest. We hope to overhear more in-touch views. Cheaper, too! Stables and room, only 2gp including animal feed. Same choice for taverns. We stay on our tier - modest - tradespeople; farmers; and, as we hoped, they have stories. People here a friendly despite us being strangers and Riglan's unusual (around these parts) appearance.

We ask about that. "We're all suffering under the yoke; if we can't find a place to all come together, then what hope is there? We're friendly because we know we're all the same - all suffering under the same oppressive rule as the next person." The say that the government is really made up of warlords and only represents rich houses... The landed gentry! Rich trading families, old city families aspiring to a high station; that kind of thing. Azalin is just a constitutional monarch - he has power but not really enough. The **Kapathia** really controls government (the council - but they refer to them warlords, or at least acting no different from that).

We hear stories that are similar to others; those who follow Avacyn. Freedom fighters; self-determination, hope. The light fighting back against the dark. People who "liberate unfair taxes" - sounds like Temo a year or two ago! 



## Day 13 ("day" 10 in Shadowfell, day 9 of 15-day cycle)

There is a queue of people - wagons, horses and more - getting ready in an excited rush to head through the pass. But we overhear other people saying there's no hurry, because we're last in the queue after the middle and upper tiers of the town.

We might be delayed by that, but at least this is a nice atmosphere to be in. People are helpful. Helping with wagons, offering to help share rooms at expensive inns on the other side, sharing dreams and so-on. After a while though the optimistic air falls a bit as people are waiting longer.

**"So much would have to happen for these dreams to come true!"** - and that's the best opening line for a song Temo could hope for. Off he goes! Nat 19+9 -> 28 performance on the lute. A few others chime in. Others improvise bawdy lyrics a couple of verses in - mostly men! - female travellers half-jokingly tell them to cut it out and clean it up.

It passes enough time for a shout from the front, as the gates are opening and things starting to move.

There are tall watchtowers built into the mountainside when we finally get to the top gate. A grand tunnel, somehow blasted through the solid mountain itself, continual flame lights along the side and quite wide - two lanes, but using a one-way system, allowing people to move alongside wagons. It takes about 20 minutes to go along this tunnel - must be a mile long! - even Maireagh is impressed. She's sure it's a dwarven feat of engineering.

The road spills out and starts to twist down the other side of the mountain in a series of switchbacks. There's no town or village here, but there are fortifications; mostly watchtowers, occasional barracks. The road is held in place by big stone walls with buttresses. We ask people nearby exactly *what* is being watched for here! "You're in the King's Land now. We're technically within the boundaries of the city of Citeaux. These are for protection! Highwaymen and the like."

It's a good vantage point, up here; the sun has risen slightly and distantly, we observe a sea. The city is built on the coast. There seem to be cliffs and low areas, the latter hard to see - probably harbours and so-on - with most of the visible stuff built on some kind of plateau. Off to the right, separate, is a hill with a big chateau - pretty much palace.

We've no idea where to go in the city (except, generally, "the palace" in the end - but it's huge) so we'll have to do our usual "fumbling around in the dark until we figure it out" routine. For now, we keep going.

After about four hours of travel we're down off the foothills and onto the plateau/mesa on which most of Citeaux is built. A river is following and starts to descend via a series of small waterfalls that carve a gorge. That's what eventually separates the palace from the main city. A stone bridge connects city to palace.

The King's Road becomes more of a King's Highway; no more dirt, gravel or cobbles; paving slabs, high quality and well maintained. Buildings around increase in size and construction quality; far more stone as well as well-painted old wooden buildings, exterior tile cladding that looks very expensive (and decorative) and even painted tiled roofs. The mountains kind of curve around in a chain that encloses Citeaux and surrounding farmlands. Some 20 mile radius or so. Low cloud or mists on the distant peaks closer to the sea flows over.

Farms here seem productive but there are fewer and fewer as we get close to the heavily-developed city. There were remnant woods at the foothills of the mountains and some that looked planted - forestry - give way to gardens. Managed plantings. Some beautiful old trees, but no big stands or groves. Riglan feels a bit like he did seeing Waterdeep; he appreciates the city and its scale and facilities, but can't really bring himself to like it - the cost of construction in nature is too great.

At junctions and crossroads, we start seeing signposts routinely. It's actually called the "**King's Way**". A spur leading to the palace (called the "**It-Kal Palace**") is signed off to one side.

As we've been riding Temo has been making enquiries about places to hear gossip. Stories of underground comings and goings. The seedy underbelly! Charisma-based investigation, 12+13 -> 25. We're told that this is best out where the caravan is headed anyway; it's called the "Trader's Ring" (Riglan starts to giggle, barely suppressing it; Maireagh rolls her eyes; Temo tries to ignore them and keep up the charm offensive). Heading down to the dock district too - "Trader's Dock" - could be interesting. Different parts of it would apply to what we're looking for.

We ask about performance - artistry. If Nethza was trying to get by, she'd perhaps rely on those talents for money. "Trader's Ring - the red quarter" we're told; we're entering via the green quarter.

* Trader's Dock is one quarter - **import/export**
* Green (**primary industry**) is produce
* Red is entertainment, art - **services** of all kinds, social stuff
* The fourth is the Blue Quarter, which is for things that are made - **manufacturing** - armour, weapons, furniture, smelters. Scribes and booksellers are there too.

If Nethza is performing - and if she's clever - we're advised she might do that in Mid City, the next ring in. It has similar functions to the adjoining Trader's Ring, but at a more - uuuh - refined financial level. It's more permanent businesses than caravans. Middle class in essence. If she's a good performer (and we think she is!) then she's likely to be at a theatre, tavern stage or inn stage at Mid City Fairgrounds - the area's known colloquially as "The Fair". Probably the most cosmopolitan and open-minded of all of the Mid City.

Hopefully she's kept her head down; otherwise she might have attracted the attention of the Inner City. They can't tell us anything about that. They've never been there.

There's no stabling in Mid City, so we head towards Trader's Red (outer ring) to find an inn and stables. We bid farewell to our travelling companions who are all headed to Green - "we might bump into you there" they say, "it's definitely the most fun part of the city!" and we says, "We owe you drinks for your advice!" and we part ways.

It's a rough part of town for sure. Buildings are in a noticeably worse state of repair. It's more crowded. Streets are kept clean but only minimally maintained by the looks of them. Temo is good in cities. Investigation 27. He wants somewhere safe for the horses - we don't want them stolen! - with anything much basic for us. He finds somewhere along the way to mid city, not too hemmed in in case we need to get away quickly and without any significant barriers - gates etc. - between us and the main road. Not too noisy either. Close to a few similar places which, if people are looking for us, might cause useful confusion. Better yet, there are travellers' and performers' stables just across the road - it's called "**Alfonso's**". So if someone is looking for our horses, they won't find our inn at the same.

Outstanding. Riglan now owes Temo a drink for that!

We head into the inn. We're greeted by an older tiefling woman. Deep red skin. Slightly cracked in places, as if she overheated! Her horns are quite high and upright - nowhere to hide those! - and they're very decorated. She wears what looks like a courtisan or entertainer's bodice and a gypsy-style skirt. She has a basket full of sheets.

We ask if there's a room. She has good insight - smells danger is following us "but danger follows us all" - we promise that if we believe anyone has found us, or if there's a fight that comes our way, we'll leave immediately and never put anyone else here in danger. Mindful of the phase of the moon - we think we have *four* nights until the shift - we ask for five, to keep it simple. It's quite cheap for a shared room and we pay 4gp.

She gives a room key to Maireagh and has one more; Temo takes it. We're led to the third floor. The room we're allocated looks out over the back, an alleyway, not the street. It's spartan; three beds, along each of three walls of the room, with a small table in the middle and four chairs. There's a wash basin in the corner; toilet etc. is down the hall. "Perfect" says Riglan, "this is great".

We risk asking about Nethza - she hasn't heard anything but can ask around. We do make sure she doesn't put herself in danger as we're not sure what trouble Nethza is in, but it's definitely *something*.

She does tell us about a mission, or something, a group of people who'll give out food but you have to listen to their stories - gathers a crowd - maybe our friend will be there. Worth a shot.

### 4pm (ish)

We head out and arrange stables for the horses. 1gp per day including feed. 5gp for 5 days, given the 5 nights at the inn. Riglan says goodbye to each of them, and says he hopes to come and check on them every day.

We go onto the streets to investigate. The sun set some time ago; lamp lights are everywhere; a soft orange glow from most doorways and windows. It's even busier than it was before. A small group of sailors goes past. Sailors know a good tavern! We follow them. They wander into one of the larger, well-signed taverns. "**The Minx and Mouse**". It's a rather beautiful, two storey building. The facade is painted in a burlesque, art nouveau style against a white background of dancers with cat faces dancing with little mice.

In we go. The sailors seem quite excited. Saloon doors with stained glass separate an entrance area to the main room. Music playing. Lots of tables; banquette seats all around the sides; and in the middle, a big stage, white curtains behind. Against the right hand side is the bar. Stairs to the left head to a mezzanine floor, overlooking the stage too. There was a playbill outside but nothing inside, so Temo quickly pops out to check it.

* Dancers around poles with swords and fire; "Double Trouble - Citeaux's Best Twin-On-Twin Action" - but there's no time, just a date and we don't know what the date is.
* "Ramblings Of A Quiet Mind" - another date.

Temo flags down a passer-by. He feigns drunk. "What's the date?" "It's Fivesday! Double Trouble tonight. Fivesday!" and as they leave they shout back, "Don't forget your wallet!"

Inside, Riglan and Maireagh had been told to pick a table. They chose the mezzanine and Riglan has been watching for Temo, calls down to him. The table is near the bannisters, with a good view. We can see the sailors have found a table downstairs and have already ordered drinks. A server comes up to our table; a youngish man with unusually thick facial hair that goes down his neck and connects to the head hair; slightly pointy, big ears but not quite an elf. An almost bestial aspect. We have various options presented and end up (somewhat randomly) with three cold local ales and three soups, with bread.

We seem to have arrived relatively early; it's not quiet inside, but certainly plenty of empty spots - but they're filling up quickly.

Our ales and (thick, warm) soup arrive - 12sp. We pay. We tuck in. Surprisingly, the weird local cold ale is actually quite good, although not too flavoursome; it's crisp. It's served in a huge stein too - almost 2 pints. We sit, listening to conversations.

Riglan perception 23. Temo only 8 - distracted by the giant stein of beer. Lots of rowdy stuff below, which seems to fill up first. Four on a table near us seem quite introverted and talk quietly - can't hear what they're saying over the noise.

Eventually, upstairs is full too. The stage seems to be being prepared with various props. An evening menu is written on a board - "Fish stew, Venison chunks, Sausages with mash and peas, cabbage" - Riglan can't help himself and out of sheer curiosity flags down a server for a venison chunk. It's size is indicated as quite large so we just order one, but with cabbage. Maireagh orders another ale and pays for all the food.

It's literally just a chunk of carved-off venison, which seems to have been slow-cooked and finished off in a pan to sear the outside. It's actually really good. The cabbage is just a chopped half of cabbage that looks like it's been slow-roasted.

Keeping an eye on time, thinking we'll leave around 5:50; it gets more and more rowdy; the quiet four near us finish up. They thank their server and head off, but stop by at the stage - apparently they know the performers; as they leave, a performer also calls after them, "Break a leg!". Temo, thinking they might be performers themselves, runs after them - catches up just outside, perception 15; as one turns, their cape moves in a strange way; a hint of a tail underneath. They're humanoid but not human, half-something. Temo thought they might have been carrying packs underneath but reassesses now.

He asks about where they are headed. They're performing at **The Guided Cage**. One produces a flyer. "Here. It costs money to go in, but we promise, we are very good!" "What time do you start?" "I think the show itself starts at 8." Temo says, "Thank you. We'll be there!"

Temo returns to the group and fills them in. "We're seeing a show at 8!" Maireagh is initially a bit grumpy. "But it's all I've got... Maybe they know something... I mean... We've got to find her..." - Temo is a bit choked up, Maireagh realises. The loss hits us all at different times. Maireagh investigates the flyer. "The artistry of mimicry; elegant acrobatics; a show for the senses; you won't believe your ears" etc. - the entry fee though is steep - 2gp each. Riglan rechecks the location, since that sounds more mid-city. There's a street address but we have no map; maybe there'll be time to find one later.

They're doing final setup by the time we leave, following the same protocol of thanking the server as the others did. Then we head over to the "missionary" area. It's in a clean-looking building with a banner outside: "Food for the hungry. All welcome" - and an orderly queue is gathering outside. We figure we'd better queue. All kinds here. A mother with two young children. Older people, alone. Younger people, alone or in couples. All are very civil. Doors open and a kindly-looking, pale-skinned middle-aged woman wearing an apron and a kind of WWII nurse's hat style headpiece invites people in.

When it gets to our turn as people file past a table for taking names, we explain that we don't need food and are happy to help/donate; but we're looking for someone; we're ushered behind the table to keep things flowing. Before we know it, we're given aprons and some instructions for the stations to which we are each assigned - by large pots of food, some steaming and even still bubbling from internal heat in one case.

The main room is a big hall with long tables. Volunteers move along tables speaking to people. For about 20 minutes we're serving food non-stop, Riglan helps occasionally moving large pots since it's pretty obvious he's big and assumed-strong, and that's it for quite some time. Over the course of this, we learn about what these people represent (Riglan dirty 20). It becomes obvious fairly quickly that there's a kind of script; ask how people's day is, how they're feeling and if anyone talks about a difficult day, they start to say that you can't give up hope. "You're still here, you've made it through another day, you're here, there's food and you're warm - don't give up hope" - and so-on. **They're trying to convince people to believe in Ezra.**

Eventually we find out that there's someone called **Jamison** who is in the kitchen but is kind of over everything - knows a lot of the people, the stories, the overall picture of what's going on. A half-ogre! Large. Bad skin, perhaps a skin condition or something. No hair, just a few tufts.

We talk about our experience with Mother Elodie and Azalyn. The ogre is sceptical, understandably, but understands for sure that this gives us belief in this domain's Ezra. We describe Nethza; they see several tieflings, but can certainly check - they take names in the guest book after all. We're offered them to check.

Temo takes a while (investigation 17). The third book he checks has "Nethza" in the clerk's handwriting. He asks when that entry is from. A few days ago - perhaps only 3 or 4 nights. There's a good chance she's still in the city. No other entries, so Middle City is a strong theory.

As far as donations go, they don't need money. They need food! All we know of is Chateau Fahrlay, which is a long way away, but was doing OK and had occasional caravans exporting food. Perhaps try them.

We're told where the Guided Cage is. We head off, waving to new friends.

Mid City, then, but fortunately not beyond any security gates - instead, there's an archway with guards posted that watch us closely as we pass. Temo finds the location quite easily once inside, given Jamison's directions. It's *not* in the Fair. It's a "proper" theatre. Well, we were warned it was fancy! The building looks like it used to be an old stone church, stained glass still present. Outside is a sign, wrought iron, wrought iron painted golden cage hanging off it, with a metal plaque inside - "The Guilded Cage". There's a bouncer at the door. Yeah. Good luck with that.

6gp paid - more than five nights at the room at the inn.

We're shown to a shared table inside (there being only 3 of us, not enough for our own table). We're told where the main stage is, due to start soon; we can get a drink. Maireagh orders for us. A strange green drink made from mushrooms! Soon after, the show starts.

The four we saw earlier come on stage and bow. One stands atop a ladder, does a leap-dive down, and then unfurl feathery black wings. They hover above the ground. They're covered in black feathers all over! There is applause. More acrobatics happen, and then they start to throw their voices; interesting mimicry. Creaky doors, church bells, leaves rustling in the wind. A strange cacophony of atmospheric sounds. No music is being played, or needed. A trapeze element comes next, with all four eventually hanging off a single trapeze and singing in harmony, but their voice throwing makes it sound like the origin of the sound is moving around the room.

Then to our surprise they mimic speech patterns and voices of random audience members. Riglan listens carefully. No Nethza in there. It was worth a try.

Next, a cloth is pulled off a crystal ball - someone adjacent to us asks if it's our first time and says, "this is really cool!" and at that moment, the same speech is heard from another part of the room via the performer's rapid mimicry. They change shape somewhat; ravens, humans, something else we can't figure out or halfway between the two. Were-ravens?!

The platform holding the crystal ball raises up with the four performers, giving a clearer view. Initially, at least, it seems like classic performer hokum - asking careful questions, careful ambiguous answers, classic fortune teller schtick. This is Temo's turn to roll his eyes. Then at one point there's a question that catches Temo off guard, as he can't figure out how they'd know to ask exactly that and the audience member is reacting as if they understand it. Perhaps there's more to this act after all. At one point, a deceased love one is heard speaking; just mimicry and voice throwing? Yet **the audience member recognises the voice**. By this point Temo is stood up and at the balcony, looking surprised. Maireagh asks, "How did they do *that*?" and Temo just shakes his hand; "I actually don't know."

There's just that one thing, then more dancing and intermission.

Temo is quiet. Maireagh asks if she's alright. After a pause, he says quietly, "If they can do that, maybe they can talk to Nethza...?" "Might be worth sticking around until the end then!"

The next act is different, but more of the same, so to speak. Once again, the crystal ball section defies explanation as the question become more and more specific. A voice again speaks; this time, a younger child; how could they do that? She sounds *scared* too; the grieving mother in the audience tries to comfort her. It's actually rather disturbing.

There's one last feat of acrobatics and then the show closes. They bow, rapturous applause and they head off stage. Riglan turns to Temo to suggest we find a way to get to talk to them, only to see that Temo is already heading away - Maireagh and Riglan chase after. We see the mother of the deceased child being helped outside, she's very distressed, as we pass downstairs.

There's security outside the dressing room. "Sorry. Performers only." Temo tries but is told we'd only be allowed inside if one of them comes *out* and asks for us. Temo backs away a bit, then risks trying Message. He says, "We met outside the Minx and Mouse earlier. Crystal ball act astonishing. Can we talk? We mean no harm" - a reply - "We'll come out. Pretend to be fans. It'll help if you have flowers or something!" so Temo uses Minor Illusion. Deception 18; the flowers appear; the door to the dressing room opens and the guy emerges. "It's our superfans!" he says. "You did make it. Great!" and the bouncer, somewhat bewildered, has to let us in.

We get into conversation. They're were-ravens. They're here to try and thwart evil, is the TL;DR - like us, they know about the evils here. Eventually they cast some form of anti-scrying spell; outside a shell of influence it sounds like there's general chit-chat, but inside is just us.

They say that they believe Azalin is preparing something; something big, and doubtless evil. They know a full story but need longer to talk. We'd need to come to their "lair" where we can talk more freely. Many of their kind came here a month ago looking at kidnapping, murders and thefts of some of the most powerful evil magical artefacts of the land - stolen from vaults, dungeons, libraries, everywhere! A large acale heist that was surely coordinated as all went missing within days of each other, hundreds of miles apart. From giant's homes high in mountains, to elves in deep woods, to dwarves deep underground, to shadow dragons in their lairs; things hidden over the centuries. All of this group's divinations traced things back to It-Kal - the palace. "We think Azalin is up to something; we do not know what - why he would need all of this power. In his preoccupation, another cancer seems to have grown in the halls of the council. It is rotting the land. We're not sure if it is a negative force emanating out from this place, or as a result of neglect and drawing of energy from the plane itself. But the dead are crying to us. They can sense impending doom. **The dead!** The dead, in the spirit realm, should fear nothing! But they can see the dome of the sky in the spirit realm cracking, pieces falling. Terrible omens. If your friend is linked to this, she is in *grave* danger. Forces are beyond comprehension. Azalin *is* this realm. This is his prison."

A nasty realisation sets in. Perhaps Azalin isn't trying to defend this realm from someone else. It's not "his realm", his kingdom; it's *his prison*. Is this a prison break? **Does he intend to destroy this entire realm to escape?!**

We are handed a book - "**The Book Of The Raven**". We're told, "Do NOT lose this. I want it back." It's apparently "volume 6, the tale of Azalin Rex". We will hand it back when we see them next - "for I will need it back then; the next time you see me will be the last time you see me." The others look sad. We're told that she's foreseen her own death. The next one to go.

The ward is failing; we have to go. We tell them where we're staying before it falls, just in case.

A sudden change in tone and mood as the ward drops - "Well thank you for the gifts! You can catch our next show in a few weeks!" as she opens the door. We head out to a suspicious bouncer. "Really nice group, always liked their work!" we say and stride off.

"Straight home" says Riglan; "We have some reading to do!"

On the way back, approaching 10pm, we see that Mid City streets are quieter. Not many people out walking, but sounds from buildings. There are patrols and carriages, but few regular people on foot. The guards dispassionately watch us as we approach and pass through the Mid City archway to the outer ring. Just after we're through, some other people are coming up, trying to enter Mid City, but they're stopped and asked questions. We don't hang around, don't want trouble!

The Trade Ring is more lively on the street; no guards; people look after themselves. It feels a bit out of control in places - charged atmosphere - as if fights might break out at any moment.

### 10pm

We get back just after ten in our quieter part of the outer ring. The inn is quiet in the halls but we hear voices from various rooms. We elect not to eavesdrop; there might be interesting news overheard but it's a long shot and the book is too valuable.

Maireagh makes some tea, heating a pot magically, while Timo and Riglan get out the book. We read as a group once tea is prepared. History checks with advantage - Riglan, Temo both get 2,19+3 (!) -> 23, Maireagh offering flashes of genius as we go, lifting our total to 28.

* Azalin Rex is from another world. As in, *another* world. Not ours. Not the world we know... So - there are others... Wow. Anyway, it's called **Greyhawk**.
* It has raised and created, according to the book, some of the most feared names - including **Vecna**, apparently another evil entity that is referenced in another volume of the Book Of Ravens.
* Azalin is - was? - a wizard king. Nobody knows his real name.
* He ruled with sheer magic. He was ruthless and merciless.
* He subjugated neighbouring kingdoms and put the citizenry through misery for the gain of more power.
* He raided any of the great libraries and attacked great cities in order to acquire (steal) items and tomes, ever amassing more knowledge and more power.
* He learned how to walk between worlds (so that is *also* a Thing - wow, again).
* The book says it was, by legend, on his rampage through a *fifth* world that the Dark Powers managed to corner him with guile and trickery.
* They basically *consumed* the city from which he was ruling, drawing it all into the mists of the Shadow Fell.
* In the beginning he was brought into a different Shadow Fell domain called **Barovia** which the book says was originally prison for the first - "the original" - vampire imprisoned in the Domains of Dread.
* When he first arrived he was asked how he was; he answered in Greyhawk tongue, "Az-Lin" - Wizard King. That's how he ended up being called Azalin.
* Rivalries between the wizard king and vampire broke into war. Azalin was so powerful that he managed to expand and conquer a section of Barovia and pushed the mists back. Some say his own imagination was able to create missing lands, pulled in from various worlds he had conquered, pulling in the inhabitants too.
* Eventually the Dark Powers cut him off from the other worlds and Barovia itself, encompassing his own domain with the mists.
* The Dark Powers thought that this would serve two purposes in one - **Strahd**, the vampire, would ultimately diminish each other, whittling each other down; but Strahd was *too powerful for Azalin, not the other way around, which is why Azalin elected to conquer outwards, pushing away, to gain resources.
* That's why the Dark Powers were forced to cut this off, but **in the process they trapped almost an entire nation's worth of people and land forever**.
* Azalin fashioned himself its king. He grew the city that he had originally conquered into what is now known as Citeaux. His wizard's tower was turned into the palace of It-Kal.
* The palace is the seat of his political and magical power alike.
* He's a lich king. His powers were gained through great sacrifices of his subjects. **He's akin really to a risen undead god.**

So nobody's managed to take him down before. Even the Dark Powers couldn't kill him, and imprisoned him but not very well initially and with great sacrifice subsequently.

Riglan voices the opinion that the Vistani might be a risk - since they can move through the mists between domains, perhaps Azalin intends to harness that power somehow. He might have designs on them of which they're unaware.

Eventually, we go to sleep - or at least, try to!

(END OF PART 3.3 - Part 3.4 next)
