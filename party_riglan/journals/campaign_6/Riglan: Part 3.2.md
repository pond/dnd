# Riglan: Part 3.2
## Day 6 ("day" 3 in Shadowfell)

We wake up at the inn, next door to the rather hateful - if in a strange way, somewhat now understood - Anna. Our mood is somewhat subdued and apprehensive. It's still dark outside. The moon is visible from the window; it has risen. If it was a sun, it'd be as late as 10am maybe; but it's not a sun.

"No time like the present" says Riglan. We get our stuff together, and go next door. Riglan knocks. The guards answer. Not quite so hostile today, unsurprisingly. Anna shouts that she's ready to go now - "Let's get this done with, so I can get away from this oppressive place".

We had out as a group and get to the manor. We knock on the main door and are welcomed this time and brought inside. We wait, as before - "for your turn to receive an audience". Looking more closely now, we notice that while this is a well-kept place, it's not perfect. There are signs of wear. Edges of tapestries that are a bit frayed. Dusty areas. Bits of rust on suits of armour that have not been polished.

Fading glory. Like everything else in this land, it's in decline.

Anna sits in stoic silence. She gives the impression of impatience. Sometimes she walks to the double doors at the hallway edge, to try and see if she can peer through the stained glass to the space beyond. Eventually her impatience boils over - she thinks we're forgotten! She goes to a side door and opens it - there's an immediate protest, "Madam! Please sit and wait for your turn!" - Anna insists nobody else is waiting, but we're told our turn will come soon.

Riglan starts to get a sinking feeling that things might not end well for Anna.

Suddenly, the double doors open apparently of their own accord. The way to the next chamber is, it seems, now available to us. It's a windowless space, but much decoration, cornices, statues, carpet; a raised dais, three steps, two thrones either side. Another step up and a grander central throne.

A voice says, "Enter!"

Riglan, Temo and Maireagh (with dog) head in. Anna trails, the two guards further behind still. Floating down from a gallery room either side - levitating - are three, very well dressed men. They settle gently into their seats. The one in the middle looks a bit older, middle-aged; long silver hair pulled back, pale skin, almost looks like eyeliner and pale red lipstick but it's just the natural colouring. Hard to say. Purple velvet coat, embroidery. Fitted pants, boots... Maireagh's words echo in Riglan's head. "Tropes". The two either side are in their 20s. Very handsome. One has what seems to be a strange wig maybe, pompadour style. Slender, angelic face, leather jerkin and white folded collar, the whole deal. The other is blonde, and this one *does* seem to be wearing makeup in a blush kind of style; the skin is a darker in colour overall, almost olive tan, in any case. A bit stronger built, dressed in knave's clothes but high society - a knight without armour.

"You have a petition for me?" says the one in the middle.

Anna clears her throat. Strides forward, confidence regained. "My lords, I come to report a crime..." - and she launches into it. But there are interruptions; where is she from; where *is* Easling; what does it provide?! "Crops. Crops? We're - we're a farm..." - she's a bit thrown, but ploughs on.

Through all this, along with Riglan's brief explanation of rescuing the children - in abstract terms - we learn (according to the vampires) that the "tithes" - children - are given to Citeaux. They are "lords of this land" they claim, but have pledged allegiance to a Duke who in turn pledges to the King.

We try to make it clear that we acted alone (kinda true!) and they ask us to leave while they deliberate.

As we're leaving, Riglan - with inspiration blown, perception 20 - overhears "...that's not great, is it? If this gets out, do you think they'll find out we're skimming..." and the door swings shut. Riglan sends a spider straight away into the room. He misses some of the conversation but hears "...do you think it'll come back to bite us?" "It better not! If they looked carefully at our books; if the duke looked carefully; he'd find all the discrepancies. I mean, how long has it been? We've been keeping a child for ourselves out of every, what, four shipments? That amounts to a lot - I don't think that's forgivable. It'd be war! They'd wage war against us!" "We can't survive that. Our forces are weak and we're neonates. You're the only full powered Lord here... I mean, how powerful are you?" "Powerful enough. But not against the Duke's forces. This can't get out! We have to nip it in the bud somehow, or find a way to cover our tracks." "So how should we decide? What do we tell them? Do we let them go, or do we send them to the duke? Let the trail go further up the chain? Who knows, maybe the duke has been skimming his share too?!" The older one thinks, then, "Right! I've decided." The doors open. "You can come in now!"

Spider is popped away. In we go. They confirm the well is working? They require triple the crop offering as penance then think no more of it. No more kids for now, after all.

As for us, "We charge you with going to the Duke. We will prepare documents for you to show him. And we will leave your fate in his hands. This mercy that we show you today, should not be taken for granted. Do not come back to our lands, meddling, causing trouble. Is that understood? You are forbidden to return!"

Riglan says there was a 1-in-4 chance of us not returning anyway... fucking with them a bit. He tries to ask about Trapper's Rest; why take so many? This throws them a bit a younger one gives away that it's the Duke's quota. "The old lord hisses at him - fangs bared! - and Riglan tries his luck. "Ah, so our quarrel is not with you anyway. Well, there's a 3 in 4 chance that it isn't anyway..." - and **Wisdom save**, 22 for Riglan; the older one is in his head, telling him to count his blessings that he's leaving alive! But to everyone else, there are just some formalities; go to the inn; we'll be contacted with paperwork.

As we leave, Riglan pops out the spider again. There's some dispute between the three because of the one talking out of turn but it's OK; they walk out - not fly, that was for show - into a side room, sparsely furnished. The foyer's decorations are for show too apparently. They have some wine and start massaging the older one's shoulders. We leave.

Back at the inn, Anna and the other guards depart. Some RP with one guard; he's thankful we came and helped; we note Anna didn't throw the 8 rescued children "under the bus"; he's worried for our safety with the duke. It's another step along the way. They leave.

Not long after, a knock on our door; a scroll is delivered as promise. Temo decides to risk it - tries to use thieve's tools to pry open the wax seal. With some insight from Maireagh, 14+14+5 -> 33 sleight of hand - we manage it.

**"My most beloved Duke Fahrlay; these three have been brought to me reportedly finding and releasing children who the village had previously given as tithes, and who we had dutifully sent your way. We do not see this as a matter of justice for us, for our role is completed. If anything they have stolen from you, my Duke. I leave it to your tender mercies to decide their fate. Forever and obediently yours, Lord Dakkon."**

"Wanker" says Temo. He carefully rolls it back, seals it, bit of heat gently from a candle - good as new.

"So we're in the shit if we see this lord, but we *could* drop the vampires in it regarding the skimming."

Maireagh says, "So do we kill them? The vampires?"

Riglan is torn. On the one hand, we can just dob them in to the duke as leverage and *he'll* do that. Also, they would most likely just be replaced anyway and the replacements might be even worse. And is any of this even real? Or current? But - Riglan fears he is being a coward. Is he going back on his word to the hunters from Trapper's Rest? It seems the children went to the duke, but these vampires facilitated it.

Temo opines, "You like nature analogies, right? It's rot. Do you try and chop off every edge bit that's rotting, or find out the source and cut that?"

Riglan sighs. "It's certainly easier to get to the next step alive, than dead. And true. Dealing with this at the highest point is more likely to succeed - their increased quotas, ugh, are coming from the duke and probably the king beyond that. OK, so, waste no more time here. We'll avenge Trapper's Rest at the source. And if that doesn't feel enough, we can always come back and finish the job here!"

It's not even midday. We're not sure where the duke lives so we ask the innkeeper. "Chateau Fahrlay". He looks freaked out. Riglan says, "Take heart. We're not dead yet and we don't intend to be any time soon. We're stronger than we look." The innkeeper says we should perhaps call in on Ezra along the way. He tells us that there's an abbey on the road to Fahrlay. It's on a hill, surrounded by vineyards.

The innkeeper recommends we join a caravan, but we'd rather avoid the liability/responsibility. For horses, though, we're told to go to a place just outside town and ask for **Elandra**; tell her that **Tompkin** sent us. We thank him and don't waste time - we head out.

We head back along the road and get beyond the manor walls. Thank fuck.

There's a building that looks like stables, with a pen next to it and a horseshoe hanging, to ward off evil spirits (!). Temo calls, "Elandra?!" "Who wants to know?" "Temo Smoothhands" "Don't know him!" "Tompkin sent us!"

We ask about horses and are shown a big white draft horse and we look at a few others but it's a Shetland pony (style wise) and a donkey that seem to catch the eye of Maireagh and Temo. Maireagh instantly takes a liking to the donkey who we are told is called Brian. Temo likes the pony; not named; Riglan thinks the horse is cool - "Snow White" (huh, less cool now) - so what about price, with some bags of oats in case grazing is scarce? Snow White is 40gp, the pony is 25gp and Brian - not normally for sale, been a faithful animal; 10gp. Oats (we'll put some in the bag of holding) - 3 days for free. Grazing should be OK but it's a standby.

Riglan pays *80*gp and explains "I think Brian might be a bit insulted if he's only 10gp, but I think he'll like it if I we paid 15."

Elandra insists we take good care of the horses. It's clear she likes Brian a lot. Riglan is sincere in reassuring her that we will. Indeed, we'd defend them with our lives - not for the first time - if it came to a fight.

We ride off.

The animals are well behaved and in good condition. As we go, Riglan starts by talking to Snow White. It's a "he". Riglan says hi. Very well spoken for a horse; Snow White seems of great pedigree! "Ah. Well acquainted. Where are we headed?" "There's apparently some kind of duke about three days down road. Not a nice guy, by all accounts, and the road may have dangers, but we will protect you." "I count on it, thank you. And I will do the same for you in return. I will lead the other animals nobly." "Thank you! Do you know the name of the pony?" "Slasher!" "And the donkey?" "Brian."

So, **Snow White**, **Slasher** and **Brian**.

On the road again - if not in the way we ever might have imagined.

### 2500XP each for resolving the village issue with the vampires

Riglan: Survival 23. The odd smaller road branching off. A lot of forests, either side. The odd farmhouse; mostly inhabited, one seeming abandoned. About 3 hours in, after a fourth farmhouse, a light drizzle sets in. Maireagh grumbles! Temo says, "This is the bit where have to keep our spirits up - right!?"

"There's no shelter" says Maireagh. True enough. She asks if it'll continue, so he checks via Druidcraft; D20->7; DM says it'll stop. We press on, expecting things to get at least no worse. An hour or so later, the drizzle does indeed abate. Happily, the sort-of-sunrise has happened, the sun showing now a short way above the horizon. It is probably at its zenith. Not all bad here!

Condensation lifts off the ground around us; the trees breathe; Temo remarks that it's strange, we're in the Shadowfell but it looks with the sun up like anywhere else he knows, really. It's not "strange" as expected.

Riglan perception dirty 20. As we travel on, the sun starts to set, 6 hours of travel. A few lights come on, dotted around the hills. We seem to be reaching more obvious larger hills, clearly defined valleys with at least one or two rivers - or at least, *once* rivers? - we see they're just dry riverbeds now. We cross a low stone bridge over one. Some hills are bare, rather than wooded; Riglan is disappointed to see a lot of cleared areas. Vineyards, orchards, plantations; even just gardens. Houses are further back from the road and bigger. Old estates? More wealth is implied. Still no other towns.

Up a hill ahead, a light; it's dark now, but Temo - perception nat 20+5->25 with goggles - sees vineyards around. A small building at the base of the hill, a winding road leads up and quite a beautiful stone church or similar at the top. "That must be it" he says, "the abbey". It's a detour - 20 minutes we estimate. We go for it.

Riglan leads, as it is now dark, with his shoulder light exposed. Temo and Maireagh ride side by side behind. Temo keeps his goggles on. We reach the small building - more of a gatehouse; an arch, entranceway. Once there was perhaps a wall around the base, as remnants are present, but it's mostly gone leaving a rather pointless arch - just decorative, except for the name; "**Abbey Of Hope Eternal**". There's candlelight inside the gatehouse and as we get close a middle-aged man with a raised cowl - "Travellers in the night? Are you seeking shelter?" "We're seeking Ezra - and shelter" "Always welcome." (he looks closer) "You are a... Special group?" "These are, yes, our - true forms." He welcomes us.

The vineyard isn't well tended. Some missing vines, some dead. Another place that's fading. Towards the top, we get close to this abbey and see another couple of buildings - wooden - one probably a grape press room of some sort, another as a winery (or once was). Here, there's a low stone wall around the compound with no gate, just a gap for the road. Some older trees and vines. Just a handful. One, behind the abbey, looks like it would be big enough for plant transport; so Riglan dismounts, heads over, studies it a while - just in case we need it. A beautiful old tree, but not in the best health, regrowing from damage here and there. A lone tree, battered by the elements. It's a cypress. Riglan says hello, politely. It responds to his touch. Once he's got to know the tree, we get back onto the horses and get to the abbey proper.

The front doors have already been opened; our approach noticed, clearly. Two people stand there, one with a crossbow (not levelled). Riglan calls out, "We are seeking Ezra, and perhaps shelter; not combat." The unarmed person, a woman dressed like a nun - white and dark blue habit, silvery/grey details, steps forward. "Greetings traveller. Surely you are not stopping and heading back out tonight?" "We could camp if we had to."

It seems there's no need. **Charles** (crossbow) is told to show us to the stables. He refers to her as **Mother Elodie** and shows us the way. Two other horses. Riglan checks in with our horses - "play nice!" - Slasher is a bit temperamental (animal handling 12), so goes on the far end, then Snow White then Brian. There's some hay and we give them some of the oats and water.

Mother Elodie back the main gate hands us towels. We realises we're still wet - "Thank you! Very thoughtful." We're invited in. Muddy boots off! Strange soft padded shoes are offered. Riglan uses the cleaning stone on the metal dog's feet.

Four others inside: One woman and three men. We introduce ourselves by name; they do in turn:

* Younger-than-Elodie **Imogen**
* Monk **Jasper**, with brother **Marvon**
* Similar garb to Charles with a Tricorn hat, **Horvath**

We tell our story and find that these people know about a world beyond the mist, people being pulled in or stepping in. "We know where we are in the lands of darkness. We've seen the truth. And that is why we're needed."

They believe in Ezra. Ezra is not a person or a being; "Ezra is merely the only embodiment of hope. Ezra is the only light in the darkness. And it requires faith; it requires the passionate firey belief that the end is not inevitable, as everything in this land moves inexorably towards darkness."

We learn that Horvath and Imogen are like us - not from this place, so they continue across time jumps. Horvath knows that this area *is* just another facet of many different 'faces' of the Shadowfell. He travelled with the **Vistani** - a wondering people who seem to be the only ones that crossed the mists between the "reams of the dread". He followed them crossing from the land Horvath first had wandered into, on the "other side" of the mists, across to here.

Elodie thinks that there are no gods left, they've forsaken them, but there's Ezra for faith. We could pray or seek the Vistani. Charles disagrees; he thinks a host of angels will cleanse the world, restore things. Elodie's face lights up in hope for a while, but it fades; she's a pragmatist.

We finish the soup and help clean the bowls. We're actually given a room - threadbare but better than a tent, with two beds. Riglan will use a bed roll.

First, there is the matter of prayer. For Riglan, this starts as the equivalent form of Commune With Nature through his staff. Within 3 miles:

* Prevalent plants are grape vines, people are Vistani, animals are crows
* Some relatively powerful undead are present and, within the same rough are as the Vistani, quite powerful fey
* On influence from other planes of existence, there *is* something; a pervasive and all-encompassing, spreading influence from another plane that feels as if it comes from the direction of Citeaux and spreads out from there

Next, Riglan buys incense from the abbey - they have plenty, and he feels obliged to pay even though they offer it for free - and casts Divination. He asks a question of the *concept* of Ezra, since it is not a specific deity. This might not work...

* **"Within the next 7 days, if we continue following the paths as we have - by simply following them as they seem to lead us - will we find Nethza?"**

Mother Elodie helps guide the prayer. Incense fills the room. Riglan senses, above the altar where the incense burned, a different kind of warmth. A soft, glowing figure appears to hover above the altar, with six wings! They spread out. Looks like some kind of angel! Everything seems made out of pure light, so detail is hard to determine. Then it speaks, surprisingly, in a clear, bell-sounding quiet voice.

**"Pilgrim. Continue on your path. Have faith. What you do and where you go, ever closer it will bring you to she who is lost."**

Riglan feels the head turn to face him. It wasn't quite "looking" at him before, but is now.

**"She needs you now more than ever. All of you. She is not only lost, she is losing herself; but you are the hope that she has prayed for. Know that your prayers are not alone."**

In a bright flash of light, it is gone. Mother Elodie is holding onto a chair, shaking. Riglan says, "Did you see it? Her? Them?!" - she turns to him, tears down her eyes and awe on her face. "We will help you however we can. We will help you!" - she heads to the door - "Avacyn! It is Avacyn! Avacyn has appeared to them! Their mission is a holy one! I saw her with my own eyes! She appeared in this very room. She *appeared!*"

The others have run in, hearing the shouting, looking differently at us now. Hanging back, Horvath nods at us. Riglan says to Elodie, "I prayed to the *concept* of Ezra. If Avacyn answered, then Ezra's concept is sound and this faith you have is real."

A faint hope, manifested.

"I have prayed and prayed for a sign for so long - this is the clearest sign of hope that I have seen yet - you must be in great need.". Riglan answers, "I cannot thank you enough; without your faith and without this place, I might never have made such a connection."

Brother Jasper says, "What *do* you require, pilgrim?"

After some discussion - all roads lead to Citeaux, it seems, and vampires; they offer to start a smelter to help make protective silver collars. They'll need about 1lb of silver for each collar, which is about 50sp. So we'd need 150sp. Hand-wavey as we didn't track specific coin types that accurately, but we have enough money by far - we say yes, we have that. The "payment" is made. The smelter is started.

Imogen has gone to bed. The Brothers work on the collars. Horvath is free to talk, back in the prayer room. All three of us file in. He asks us to sit and we do.

"You bring with you uncertainty, chance; I can see that. I can see the effect you have on the fabric of this world. You cause ripples. You are potentially capable of changing it. Have you encountered much on your short journey so far?"

We describe more of our journey and on the bits we'd covered before, we describe in more detail. Horvath says:

"Ah. You are perhaps pulling things towards you. Not so much a ripple as a vortex..." "What would that mean?" "I am unsure. But there are things about this world which I was going to tell you, but now I'm not so sure are necessarily true! You see, I as a general rule do not reveal to the others what I have seen in the future. Especially not the followers of Ezra." (We nod in agreement). "I fear that it would only accelerate things, or change things. I don't know if *I* have the ability to change things, which is why I try to be very careful in what I do. Yet things are drawn to you like moths to a flame! I sense that it is your purpose - your role here - *to* change things. I don't know what that means for this realm. Can you describe to me the person that you are looking for? But what I hear you encountering has only happened in my knowledge to one other. And there are stories of *her* throughout the ages. She, who is also a vortex."

"Describe" is a wide world. He starts with the physical. Not too remarkable in *this* realm. Next, Riglan describes Nethza's birth, from her recounting and his recent dream; the pact, the patron; the influence of devils (Levistus in particular) is why she's a Tiefling, but not the source of her warlock magic. We don't know who her patron is. It's a little tangential, but we describe the manner of her entry into this realm, in as much detail as we can. He responds, "Curious; all mentions of this person in this realm say she does not travel alone. She has a companion." - yes, could be that shadow. Finally Riglan describes *her*, in very emotional terms, choking up at terms. He misses her terribly now. These aspects, Horvath says, are the very things that this realm seems to need to balance it, yet this realm in turn seems designed almost specifically to crush that spirit.

This is about as far back as Horvath has gone, so this is as far back as Nethza or we have ever gone too. Her story, then, echoes down the ages. **A difference can be made. The future isn't necessarily fixed.**

"I have a fluttering in my heart to hear about someone for whom you care so much." He reaches to his neck and pulls a talisman, a kind of upside-down obsidian triangle with a tiger's eye in the middle and a crow's feather hanging off, on a black leather cord. "I feel you will need this more than I. That is my sense. I feel that is why I am here - to give this to you..." He puts it in Riglan's hand. "This will get you into a Vistani camp. They don't let anyone who is not their own travel with them, but I travelled with them after fighting alongside them and saving one of their own. It was the only time I ever intervened in events happening around me because my conscience dictated that I have to. I think that's why I did it, so it'd bring me here, to this moment, now."

Wow. "Thank you" is an understatement.

He's now "floating in the same river" as us; stuck in this realm. "It appears you and your friend who you seek are the only ones with oars!" Riglan chuckles. "Yes, and we intend to paddle everyone to the calm and bountiful waters." He smiles. "I will take my leave and the first watch." "OK. Let us know if we're needed to help with watch."

Overnight, we occasionally wake, hearing the clanging from the smelting room.



## Day 7 ("day" 4 in Shadowfell, day 3 of 15-day cycle)

We are presented with the collars! We thank them most sincerely. We need to get moving; get ourselves to the Duke before the "month" ends. Riglan notices on the way out that there's iconography he hadn't seen the previous night, above the door of the abbey; a stone carving of Avacyn, who wields a flaming greatsword. A paladin perhaps? This helps explain why that vision was so significant to the people here.

Charles fetches our horses, many thanks again and off we ride. Two more days to Chateau Fahrlay!

Riglan survival 16+9->25 for first half of the day. We pass over a large stone bridge at one point, with a small stream flowing underneath. Must once have been a far larger river. Willows cling to either side. Riglan instinctively pulls his cloak around him as the temperature seems to suddenly drop; a wind howls down the river valley, cold and damp. Looking up the valley, it's just a valley, with foothills then misty mountains stretching away. Scraggly trees here and there, forming the edge of a bit of forest; carrying on, there are a few more wind-blasted, twisted trees are present. It seems like a step change to a more grim area.

The sun has risen but it's cloudy. Daylight, but no sunlight. As we continue, we see remnants of low woods on the right. No farms here on this side, but there are occasional buildings that we're not sure are in use or abandoned. The road starts to descend; a windmill stands on an outcrop to our left, blades rotating slowly, but rotating nonetheless. We decide to look in there, perhaps to find out more about this area; why does it seem so much worse, on crossing the bridge? The detour is only small.

There are some fields around the outcrop that look like they might once have had crops, but now it's mostly bare earth and dried grass. A soft, low light shines from a window to the side of the windmill's front door. It creaks and groans. Riglan dismounts and knocks.

The grinding stops and the blades slow; someone asks who's there; we say "travellers". "I'll be there in a moment". Then the grinding continues and the blades turn a while longer until eventually the door opens. A shaggy, scrawny-ish middle-aged guy with sunken eyes, but very tall! 7.5ft, almost at eye level with Riglan. He wears warm clothing without sleeves, with an off-white workshirt underneath. Pants are tied with a rope.

He introduces himself as **Aiden** after showing us a place to tie the horses. "I'm the miller's son - well - I mean - I'm the miller." Perception dirty 20. He has a grindstone and is grinding flower, but there are few bags of grain - just a tub.

We get into conversation. Not enough people to grow crops; crops won't grow anyway; people are afraid and tired; he has not enough grain to go around. It's the Lord and Lady's land. They get by, day by day. There are no children, but not through tithes - they give half way they grow, if anything - but for children, neither wives nor animals have had children for years. A curse of baron-ness across the land. Something affects people. He heard from a nearby town that some mothers did get pregnant but babies were stillborn. The wailing could be heard from miles around.

Eventually we take our leave, doing what we can to bolster his hope. It's not all over. Just before we go, Maireagh stops, reaches into her bag and pulls out a round of cheese. Riglan smiles. "Aiden, I'd like you to have this" she says. He protests but she insists. He smiles warmly and takes it. She shakes off the smile she returns him, the brusque exterior returning and mounts the donkey. We don't say anything. "Right. Lets get out of here" she says. Riglan nods and says, "Let's find a tree to talk to; see if it has any idea where this blight originates. Hopefully, it's the manor."

Riglan finds a big, gnarly tree. "It saddens me to see how hard it is to grow here. How are you faring?" "I cling on. My roots go deep. I sip at the reserves, cold water, deep in the ground. The strong, drying wind is somehow fungal and damp, alternating between bitter cold and decaying mist. I still stand, though my siblings have fallen to the axe." "Do you have a theory about the origin of this blight?" "It *is* a blight. It is a blight that is a cascade. There are no bees to pollinate our flowers. No seeds, no saplings. The land grows colder and more bare every season. The people leave or they are taken. Beware! Beware the spirits of the night, who come and snatch away the life of the unborn. They come from the castle over the hills. They devour everything... Will you... Will you touch my bark? And tell me - am I dying?"

Riglan complies. "Yes, great tree. I am sorry, but that is true."

"Can you see a hollow, half way up my trunk?" "Yes" "I asked a squirrel years ago, to hide one of my acorns. I know it is still there." Riglan finds it; it is viable. "Will you take it where there is sun, for me?" Riglan says, "I have met other trees. I have other seeds. There will a grove. Many, who can talk, have offspring and grow into a new woods. The area from which I come, and to which I shall return, has sun, warm winds, summers and winters, water aplenty." "And warm rain?" "Yes, warm rain too. This acorn will flourish. I shall see to it. You have my word." "Thank you, my friend. You are only a few hours behind others with good hearts - they passed this way only a few hours ago, a long caravan of them." "Maybe we shall meet them. Perhaps we shall be able to help this land before your time is over; but if not, know that your offspring *will* grow. Farewell great tree, and good luck." The tree shivers in response.

Riglan steps away. He's crying, he can't stop it. He's never been there talking to tree so close its end before and helpless to stop it. The blight is supernatural and stems from either the manor of the Duke, or perhaps literally the castle of the king? The "castle on the hill". "We have to - I think we somehow have to kill them. Stop them, end this curse..." - and then Riglan says, "Hang on, I have to go look for something" and turns into hawk. Best possible eyesight. Flies up. Looks for a castle on a hill, or something that might pass for that if you're a tree. Perception is of course a fucking nat 1, so 10 overall, hopeless. Nothing seen. By a river about 8 miles ahead is a camp site with caravans. Well, *they* might recognise the castle description. He flies back turns into Riglan and says - "let's press on, with speed. A caravan has camped ahead, we should join them."

Within 2 hours, now well into the dark, we approach. The caravan has camped between a few remaining trees. Hay is laid down for the horses. Nothing to graze here. There are five caravans, parked in a circle. A small fire; not much dry wood around. Two people on horseback ride out to us. "Halt!" "We are travellers" says Riglan, "hoping to join you tonight for safety in numbers. A tree spoke highly of you."

"You are welcome to camp by the river with us, but we would ask that you keep your distance if your intentions are good." They are darker-skinned, blonde braided hair, both male. Colourful clothing. Riglan, insight 27. Mannerisms and ways of speaking seem alien to this place. Inflections sound foreign. Penny drops.

Riglan says, "Ah! I see. We will honour your wishes, but we were given this by one who travelled with you I think - perhaps this helps you understand our intent?" and shows the talisman. "His name was Horvath."

"We do not personally know this Horvath. He must have travelled with a different caravan. But that which you wear is worthless to anyone but us. Nobody would think to steal that off a dead body... Please, come this way."

**We've stumbled across the Vistani.**

We introduce ourselves. Riglan starts to explain, but is stopped; "No disrespect; but save your story for **Imelda**". Some of them introduce themselves in turn, but then lead us to a caravan. There are blankets outside and a hammock hanging. An older lady is there, all wrapped up in blankets and cushions. "**Mother Imelda** - we have guests."

"You're late!" she says. "I expected you on the previous moon. But you are late only for this meeting."

We are invited to sit. She insists on sharing bread and soup. We add things to the soup pot from rations and stores. Cured meats. We ask about our chest of preserving and the way things rot immediately if removed; "Ah, yes. Interesting. You never know in each period if the time is in the future or the past. You can try..." - so we try and remove one item of fruit. It stays intact. "Seems we're far enough back..." - so we can share a couple of ration's worth of salted meats too and divide up some fresh fruit. We have spare oats from the abbey stay last night so we can share those with their horses too.

Imelda wants to know everything. "Leave nothing out, especially inconsequential details - in fact, leave everything out *except* those!"

In a satchel, she pulls out a massive stack of large cards and starts rifling through them. So with a deep breath, Riglan steps back all the way to the school and night of disappearance. She gives occasional instructions about the cards; now and then she flips one, laying them in a pattern.

* The shadow/spirit travelling with Nethza might be a friend, or might be deceiving her into thinking it is a friend. The cards show this as The Fool
* The spirits that attacked that night in the abbey started by trying to tell us not to follow Nethza. There's a Queen in the cards for this. Something that follows her, very powerful, trying to **protect** her? But *not* the shadow / The Fool.
* "Turn back now! Do not go further along this path. She must walk it alone. You cannot save her. She belongs to us", it said (history 14+4) at the start of combat. A card shows **The Queen Of Ravens**.
* Nethza has a book about that. Temo knows something of it. Riglan goes out on a limb; "Could that be her patron?" "It could be. It could be protecting her, which would take a *lot* of resources from the Raven Queen. For although she lives in the Shadowfell, she has very little pair within any of the Captive Domains of Dread. These are like little kingdoms in the mists. Each one ruled by a despot or despots condemned to live out their worst punishments for eternity."
* Imelda does not know why Avacyn would indicate that Nethza needs our help, while the Raven Queen - if it is indeed her - used a spirit to try and dissuade us from following.
* The cards indicate a *third* force in play. The Raven Queen; Avacyn; who is the third? A card is flipped. Blank. "I see" she says, then rubs the card. "It is an empty throne. Are you thinking of heading to the castle, by chance?" (Yes, we are.) The meaning is unknown.
* Only one card left. The hanged man, of course. "The future is uncertain. The hanged man does not represent death. **It means the end of a road. Beyond that end, I cannot see; my sight does not penetrate.**"

It turns out the spirits we fought were the Shadar-Kai, because Imelda describes them and we recognise what we fought in that description. So we've inadvertently already tackled the Raven Queen's forces and since we're not going to abandon the search for Nethza, we're continuing to go against what the Raven Queen apparently wants. Our faith, it seems, is in Avacyn, even though we don't know what Avacyn might want for Nethza either.

Riglan asks, "It seems as if changes we make here - now - *can* affect the future. What happens to the future we saw, to our memories, if our actions in this past time cause it to change?"

"Vistani are the river that flows through all of the Shadowfell - the domains of the Ravenloft. We connect them all, the tissue that binds. We don't change things but we help those who do. Our story can never be front-and-centre. That is the pact that we have made that allows us to freely move between these domains. Were we ever to break that pact, we risk losing that ability."

"So, if you help those who do, we want to find our friend. And we'd ideally like to halt, or even reverse the rot upon these lands; this - influence, from some other plane..."

"I can understand that desire. It is not easy on anyone to live like this."

Riglan says, "Sometimes, especially so, when all someone yearns for is something as simple as warm rain, and you can't even give them that. Is there anything you know about the Duke and Lady ruling these lands that might help us defeat them - either in battle, or in negotiation?"

Imelda starts collecting her cards back together. "Is there a form of that question that the cards can answer?"

Riglan asks if the cards can predict, were we to travel to the manor and fight the vampires there, if we would be defeated; or victorious; or at least see if the future therein is not determined.

* Imelda finds a card of the tower (rook). "You are travelling there".
* Next card; a card of the night. "You will find conflict, but you will meet the decorum; you will meet propriety. Statecraft. Knighthood. This is what this card represents. You will not be met with open battle. You will have to spar in their arena.
* Next card. "You will be helped..." The card is that of a sleeping princess. "...hmm. You will be helped by something or someone who doesn't perhaps even know that they are doing so, unconsciously. But you will meet obstacles. You will be challenged. The thing you will have to overcome..."
* Another card; she yelps! Looks startled, steps back; yells out, "Alert everyone! Alert! Eyes!" - the camp looks confused.

Riglan perception only 14. He sees the card; it is a swarm of bats. The ground underneath us starts to tremble; we draw weapons; Riglan activates the staff. Riglan perception again only 15, still trying to figure out what the card means; Temo 19; Maireagh nat 20. Calls doggy over. "The ground!" she shouts. There's a scream from a caravan as people jump up onto them, some on the ground yelping, ones around the campfire seem to be fighting things with blades. Grasping hands! They burst from the ground as **ghouls pull themselves up and out**.

Temo pulls down his goggles. Maireagh points up to the sky, "In the sky as well! From both skies!" and Riglan sees **bats silhouetted against the moon**. Temo sees them too once goggles are on. He notices that two fly lower, towards the campground, as the remainder swarm the small campfire, to put it out; it goes fully dark. Riglan casts Darkvision. We hear shouts, people calling out over each other, general gist - "**DEFEND THE CAMP!**"

Initiative:

* Riglan 25
* Temo 25
* Maireagh 8

Riglan acts first. The two bats that broke away have touched down and transformed into large, 8ft tall, withered-looking gnolls. Mangy, almost wolf-like. Almost skeletal arms, slightly falling-apart robes. Is that the Lord and Lady? Insight 14, it's not like he knows much about them either way. He's caught by surprise; surely they wouldn't come here in the middle of the night to find us? We've made no significant ripples. Maybe it's Imedla they're after so he calls to his party, "Protect Imelda if you can!" and summons, once again but at L6 (so 60hp), his draconic spirit 10ft up between us and the gnoll (17 temp HP for all, including dragon). He also drops in his bear totem in the middle of our group to protect us and, for now, Imelda. We are surrounded by ghouls. Riglan moves next to Imelda and commands the dragon to attack.

The dragon breath hits the gnolls but both dodges the worst (1+6->7->3 radiant). Rend crits but only 1+2 on the 2d6, 13 damage for the left hand one, misses the right (d20->3) so tries again (d20->3 again), miss again. It stands its ground.

Temo aims at the nearest ghoul; he hits, doing a rather disappointing 25 damage. The ghoul surprisingly starts to collapse and fall into dust, disintegrating; they're old ghouls - only magic holding them together - reminiscent of our fights with the elemental cults a while ago. Perception 19+5->24, he realises all the ghouls are - children. Some are very young. 8-15yo maybe if humans. He calls out, "They're not hardly, but they're - children. Young children. I guess if we take them out, we release their spirits maybe?"

A ghoul runs up and attacks Temo in return. Claws miss. Another goes for Maireagh but also misses.

One of the gnolls, the one to the right of the dragon which the dragon missed twice, looks forward and emits cackling, hyena-kind of screeching laugh. DC15 wisdom saving from everyone with 120ft! Temo, Riglan and Maireagh are OK. The dragon is immune to fear. We see a few Vistani start to flee as they succumb. Next it moves forward, but then seems to be distressed in some way and it halts abruptly. Something is pushing it back. Then the nasty creature seems to sniff the air; again, something is putting it off coming near us. Then for some reason it glares at Riglan; it recognises him as the source of the dragon and its eyes glow a sickly green. Con.save for Riglan, but he rolls at nat 5->8, and he immediately feels a wave of sickness wash over him. He's poisoned! Riglan barfs, narrowly avoiding the hammock. A waste of good soup. Riglan shouts, "I'm holding back somehow but I don't know how. It's something on me, a smell or something."

Another ghoul goes for Temo but fortunately misses. Another runs up to Maireagh - we're beset now - but our luck holds and it misses too - but yet another runs from afar, getting behind Maireagh and flanking her, but doesn't have time to attack just yet.

The other gnoll acts. It too runs forward and stops where the other did, but *this* one focuses on Temo and Maireagh. It tries to push forward more but halts again, albeit one step closer. Fangs are bared and the eyes glow the sickly colour again; this time, Maireagh is the target. She is able to save against its effects.

Maireagh is surrounded. Ghouls to the left of her, ghouls to the right, there she is, stuck in the middle with Temo. They're all very close too; no hammer throwing seems possible from such close quarters combat. She attacks the most recent arrival behind her first; hits, maximum 16 damage; throws in an Arcane Jolt, adding 2d6->6, 22 total; it crumbles. She swings around to try and hit another in front of Temo and does hit, but this time for only 10 damage. She tells the dog to take a dodging posture; instead, she uses her shield to push into the one she just hit to try and shove it back a bit (bonus action). Contested athl., success; it is pushed diagonally away, ending up sandwiched between the closest gnoll vampire and another ghoul.

Imelda, next to Riglan, seems to have taken out some vials and is throwing them around her! Very strong smelling perfume. Riglan perception 14, she's blowing and fanning at it to try and make the smell move further. The gnolls recoil a bit.

Riglan is forced to self-heal, L2 Lesser Restoration. Commands the dragon to continue its attack. It withdraws 5ft to use a breath weapon (opp attack misses) and gets one gnoll and two ghouls. DC19 dex. All three fail to avoid it, taking 7 damage. Rend attacks next; the unhurt gnoll is its first target. Hits for 13, tries the other one again, hitting for 14 and then 13 points.

Temo disengages from the ghouls, backs away and hits the less injured gnoll, close enough to the dragon to be distracted by it, for 31 points. He goes wide; one ghoul runs after him but misses on its attack. Another tries for Maireagh but also misses.

The less injured gnoll vampire self-heals for 10, having not been hit by radiant damage recently. It rakes at the dragon with claws. Hits for 10 damage and manages to haul itself up on that claw to try for a bite, but that misses.

A ghoul goes for Riglan. Crit, but Temo uses Silvery Barbs and the crit 20 turns into a crit 1! Self-advantage for his next attack. One of the two ghouls near Maireagh tries to attack and misses; the other tries and would hit, but the dog intervenes and the disadvantage causes a miss.

The more injured gnoll vampire can't heal. It turns and leaps, trying claws and teeth against the dragon. Claws hit, 10 damage again (57 hp left). Teeth miss.

Maireagh retaliates against the ghoul that tired to hit her. She hits and with arcane jolt can't take it down; tries again, unnecessary crit; it is taken down with two high rolls. There's one left in front of her so she asks the dog to attack and it hits, for a maximum 12 damage.

Riglan hits the nearby ghoul with the staff and does 13 damage via a crit but only 1,7 on the 2d8 - it's enough; it goes down. He asks the dragon to hit both vampires with its breath. He moves his totem a bit closer to Temo.

The dragon knows what that means - two opportunity attacks. One misses but one does hit, using claws, doing 11 damage. It retaliates with the breath weapon on them both and even reaches the remaining ghoul near Maireagh. The less injured gnoll avoids the worst, the other does not; the ghoul also avoids the worst. The roll is terrible, 2+3->5, so 2 points damage or 5 points - but it stops them healing. It flies a little closer again and keeps going on the more injured gnoll. Three hits - a max 16, 16 (via crit but 2d6->3,3) and 11. The vampire turns into small bats, but then the bats fall, as they apparently struggle to move and die on the ground; it turns back into a vampire again, but then flesh turns to dust and it becomes a set of bones covered in rags. A couple of bats still flap miserably on the ground, next to it, then die.

Temo disengages from the ghoul and hits the remaining gnoll for 33 damage. The ghoul follows and attacks, hitting with its claws; 7 damage; with a luck point, he manages to avoid the effects of the paralysis (he pulls away from the claw *just* quickly enough and fights off the strange chill that seems to set into his bones almost immediately). The other ghoul tries to hit Maireagh but misses; but now the gnoll moves - right up to Temo. The dragon tries to hit as it leaves; the dragon gets an opportunity attack, hitting for 13 points, but the vampire is still up.

The vampire attacks Temo, first with a sickening gaze. DC15 con save. Luck doesn't help him this time - he's poisoned. Next it tries its claws, hitting for 10 then the bite; this hits too, 12 piercing and 8 necrotic (which reduces his HP max by that amount). Riglan is horrified at this, calling out "Temo!" in shock. Then it turns into a bat and tries to fly away! Temo misses his opportunity attack. The bat starts to fly away, about 10ft.

Maireagh sees this. She allows for an attack of opportunity from the nearby ghoul; it just misses; she gets almost underneath the fleeing bat and attacks with a hammer throw. She hits! 2d8->5,8+8->21 damage; arcane jolt on top, 6 more. The bat falls from the sky, flutters on the ground then bursts into jittering wings and bones. Weird.

No time to celebrate - two ghouls left. She has another attack and swings at the ghoul that's beside Temo (and now, her), hitting it for 15; it drops. The dog tries to attack the remaining ghoul but misses. Riglan runs up to that same one; hits *just*, for 8 points, exactly enough. It falls. He goes to Temo and casts L2 Lesser Restoration. He's not sure if the vampire bite means Temo will turn into a vampire, but knowing the spell will have made Temo *feel* better, he bluffs it and says, "There, that'll stop you turning!"

Imelda runs over. "Oh my! Oh my. Looks like things are more advanced than I had foreseen! Please, I will get incense to try and disorientate them, but it appears that they were sniffing something out. We must confuse them. I must tend to my people. But here..." - she hands us a bunch of incense - "...please camp with us tonight, such that we can put up wards to hide you; but if you have abilities to obscure yourself some way, please do." Riglan offers to help with healing magic. We walk around. Oddly, people were frightened - but only our group was attacked.

Riglan to Imelda. "Was that the Duke and Dutchess? Why us? We're not important!" "No. That's not the Duke and Lady. They're Gnoll witherling vampires - gnoll witherlings, outcasts amongst the gnolls that sought power somehow. Perhaps from the Duke and Dutchess. Clearly not that powerful, but frightening, as you can see! My people have iron wills but even they cowered in fear at the scream of a witherling."

"Hmm. But why us?" "Must be the path you walk. You are changing things. You are drawing attention. I don't know if that was even sent by the Duke and Dutchess." "Perhaps the Raven Queen?" "No. They are not minions of hers. She would have nothing to do with undead abominations such as these."

We could investigate the bones. So we do. Temo, investigation 21. There are talismans here, on gold necklaces. Seems unusual given the poor state of their clothes. They have a pattern; three narrow crescent moons with a leafless tree in the middle. Doesn't remind us of anything. We show Imelda. "Interesting. That is not the crest of the Fahrlay. Please... Come with me. Let's see if we can find something."

She shows us old scrapbooks in her caravan. Temo looks too; investigation 22. He finds a match; a little-known sigil that Imelda has some notes upon with question marks next to them:

* Order of scribes?
* Order of...?
* Linked to royal house?

"Huh. I think this links to some secret society from Citeaux. But how do they know you're here? Why would they send someone after you? Have you had a run-in with anyone in Citeaux?" "Not *yet*... Not that we know of."

We keep the talismans. Who knows, they might be helpful for something.

People settle to sleep. Temo casts Tiny Hut by ritual, as Imelda asks if there's anything we can do to help hide ourselves from searches - maybe that'll help. We sleep inside there.

Before he sleeps, Riglan says a sort of quiet prayer: **"Hang in there, Nethza. Hold on. We're coming to help as fast as we can."**



## Day 8 ("day" 5 in Shadowfell, day 4 of 15-day cycle)

We wake up some hours later. The fire is burning high. People in the camp are making breakfast. Temo dismisses the hut and we join in with breakfast, contributing some food. Baked beans and cornbread. The Vistani begin to pack up camp. Mother Imelda has sent for us, so we head to her caravan before we depart.

"Morning to you" she says. "I hope your rest was not plagued by worries and nightmares?" "Not too bad actually." "Good. I understand you are headed towards Chateau Fahrlay?" "Yes, we have a grievance there and it leads us in turn to Citeaux." She responds, "We are not welcome in the cities, but I've consulted with the cards and it appears that we are going to accompany you to Chateau Fahrlay - though you understand we can't be a party to what you're doing there, or risk breaking the pact." "That's great! We welcome the company." "Do you think you might be ready to go in about half an hour?" "Oh, we were ready to go round about now! So we'll wait."

Eventually, six caravans and our horse, pony and donkey are all headed away. We're invited to travel with Imelda's caravan, roughly in the middle. We chat as we travel.

"What happened last night is very unusual and has definitely piqued my curiosity about your - 'vortex'", she says (remember, we'd explained in detail about the goings on at the Abbey recently). "I believe we are meant to meet, and I believe we are meant to help you. I've seen in the cards the future of this land. There is an emptiness at the heart of it." Riglan says, "Yes, the future as we've seen it only goes one way and that way isn't good. We're hoping to change that, if we can." "What the cards tell me are only the clues, so we know that you have to survive if this hole - if this void, that is going to develop in the middle of this land, at the heart of it, in its soul - is to be stopped from devouring this very existence and its entirety. It is the absence of something. It's this card..." - she shows a card of an empty cup - "...something is missing, or will be missing. It appears that your role, for me, is confusing; I know that we have to defend you because of this..." - a card of a shield - "...this is our relationship with you. We have to shield you, to aid you. But *your* role is confusing; it runs parallel to the fate of this domain, but in one sense, if you are to achieve your goal, it would accelerate the deterioration. It would exacerbate this hole. So I do not know actually what's going on. Only these clues."

"My best guess would be that Nethza is connected to this land. And needs to be here for it to survive, or something like that, so if we rescue her which is our goal, then the land would deteriorate. That's one possibility. Or Nethza is supposed to aid the Raven Queen, and the Raven Queen is trying to fight whatever is killing this land."

"So perhaps your friend Nethza is in opposition to **Azalin** Rex, the leader of this land -" (Rex is the title) "- this domain is his nightmare and his cage." Imelda ties a string of charms to the talisman we were given by Horvath. "Wherever you are, whenever you are - **find my people** and show this to them. I will pass the message through stories, through our oral histories, so they will always know to help."

"Is there anything we can do for you in return?"

"Do not shun us in any time. You may hear things - stories - about the Vistani. Some may even be true. But know that you know us; you have fought with us. You know our heart and the kind of people we are. Do not fear us or push us away."

Riglan looks to Temo, who nods; looks to Maireagh; she nods; Riglan says, "You have our word."

Eventually, we pass into - for want of a better description - civilised lands. Farms that are producing. The rot has not affected the land despite spreading from Citeaux. They're not healthy, Riglan can see that, but they *are* alive. Riglan Nature, 23; the growth, farming here, is very heavily modified. That is to say, the farms add bags and bags of what looks like fertilisers. They eye the passing caravan with suspicion; it is not ignored. We are approaching a river, crossing lowlands into which we have descended.

There is the odd tower and other larger buildings. Large stables, inns. Then we spot it - a beautiful, fairytale castle/chateau, pennants flying on conical roofs. It's built close to the river, but not on the water's edge. "That's it, I suppose!" says Riglan, stating the obvious.

We reach a group of buildings at a crossroads. One leads towards the chateau, one goes straight ahead; Imelda says "we will not be stopping here; we must carry on to a place we can camp. They will not let us camp here in peace." Riglan says, "safe journeys. I hope we survive ours! But we must turn right, for the chateau. Thank you again and farewell." "Luck's blessing be upon you!" - waving her hands in a particular pattern; it seems ritualistic rather than magical, yet Riglan has a sense of protection (and as such, the three of us are able to reroll 1d20 of our choice, a bit like a Luck Point - only the living; the dog doesn't get it).

As the caravan departs, people stop, watching. Some peer out of windows. Some stand outside, arms crossed; others with brooms stop sweeping and wait. Indoctrinated by the vampires most likely.

### The time we estimate is around 3:30pm; the sun sets.

It's a small hamlet. There's even a general store. Hmm. Rations? A small farm shop; a carpenter. Riglan asks the horses if they want anything. Slasher wants a **rabbit** - not to eat, just as a pet! We tie them on a nearby post and head into the farm shop.

Crops are for sale. Vegetables, fruit, grain, oats. Prices are not low... We get another 3 days of oats for the horses (1gp) and 6 rations' worth of fresh food, including some fresh bread; would be 3gp normally, but 4.5gp here (not bad considering, it's Shadowfell!)

We head out, untie the horses and without further ado follow the road to the chateau. We reach a gate. Guards are posted outside; they stop us. We show them the scroll and say we've been told to come. Knocking on the gate - "Someone here, official business; they have papers with the seal from Darkon" - calls a guard. The gate is opened and we go through. We're told where to tie the horses, so we do. It's a sort-of-stables area, without individual stalls.

The chateau is made of stone, in creamy off-white squared-off blocks. The main keep is a similar colour but with a slight pink hue. Two outbuildings are attached in addition to the keep, which is connected too. The keep has two towers with conical roofs, one slightly higher than the other. The main house in the front is built in an actual house-like shape. Four storeys for the keep, with one tower carrying on a further storey, the other going up two more storeys. Walls around come up around 25ft.

We are shown towards a front door of the keep. More ornate. Beautiful, carved stone. Cathedral-like; "nested" archways, double doors below. Guards there allow us in when we give them the paperwork. We're told to clean our feet before going in!

Inside, a polished stone floor with runner carpets down the middle. Tapestries. No suits of armour. Riglan perception 15, wondering if this is more well maintained than Darkon (which on close inspection was getting quite run down). Stained glass in windows is all intact. Chandeliers hang down the central foyer and are fully intact. Tapestries are old but not at all moth-eaten or threadbare. It has money, and isn't as run down as Darkon, but is still not in its heyday.

A man in a rather ridiculous official hat of some sort comes to check our paperwork. "Ah. For the Duke's eyes only. Come with me. I'll show you to a place where you can sit and wait." We're shown to some sort of drawing room, with a view outside, looking out over gardens. Trimmed rose bushes, patterned hedges. Quite small though.

We sit in rather ostentatious, large armchairs waiting. After 20 minutes or so the attendant comes back. He apologises. The Duke has seen the letter, we're told, not sure if he's read it in detail but did break the seal, but "as it is nearly dinner time I'm afraid we will get no further progress today". "We have to come back tomorrow?" "Yes please. But if you let me know where you are staying I can send a messenger to get you when it's time." "I only saw one big inn in town." The attendant is quite deferential, thinks we're on "official business" due to the letter's seal - no idea of its content! "The Staff" (guards) know to expect us tomorrow so we don't need any other paperwork.

So we head back again. Maireagh's grumpy. We were kind of wound up for a fight! As we walk out, Riglan perception 24; smells something and turns towards it. Smells like *very* strong roses! He sees a stunningly beautiful but ageless-looking woman (indeterminate age), very beautifully dressed, high lace collar, braided hair piled high, diamond earrings and so-on. Riglan kind of nudges Temo with his leg. Temo sees her. "Ah, Lady Fahrlay I presume?" says Temo, in his poshest voice. (The attendant is horrified!)

She turns towards the group and nods. She's holding a slender steel and glass goblet with wine in it. "Oh... I'm at a disadvantage. And who are you?" We introduce ourselves by name, making a beeline towards her, the attendant now in pursuit. "We're of no particular importance, here on official business, but it seems we must return tomorrow." "Have you travelled all day?" "Yes" "Murray. Murray, why don't you set three extra places at dinner tonight? You'll say for dinner won't you?" Temo, all charm, "Very gracious of you, Lady Fahrlay! We certainly accept." "That's lovely! Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes, I think. Show our guests the dressing room, Murray; they wish to freshen up before the meal; then show them to the dining room. The Duke and I will be dining in the main dining room tonight... No! No, I changed my mind. We'll dine in the Hunting Room tonight..." (She's clearly sizing us up) "...yes, I think that's more your speed. I take it you're not particularly taken by delicate finery and maybe the power of the hunt is more to your liking?" Temo answers, "Very perceptive." She heads off.

Temo apologises, seeing Murray is very flustered - "I hope I haven't caused you any trouble!" - Riglan sees (insight 24) that Murray is more horrified and concerned, not worried about breaches of protocol. He's confident, polite, a no-nonsense kind of person and doesn't seem concerned for himself. He seems to pull himself together; shows us the dressing room. "I will... I will have a guard... Bring you to the hunting room when you are done. I have... I have preparations to do as the Duke and Lady are having their dinner there now." Riglan looks at Murray and says, "We're no fools, we know what this is - and we're stronger than we look, but we don't underestimate anyone." "Oh no, please don't get the wrong idea... Everything is fine! It's no trouble at all. You're perfectly safe! The hunting room is a lovely room." He heads off, muttering about all the chores he has to do to make the room ready.

We use the cleaning stone to freshen up. **Maireagh is digging through the bag, looking for proper clothes. Her shoulders slump. She pulls out a beautiful black and blue dress.** "Oh, shit" says Riglan. Maireagh sighs, folds it, sets it aside. Continues looking. Temo puts his hand on the black and blue dress. Maireagh looks to him. "She'll be fine. We'll find her." "Yes... It's why we're here. And it's why were going to do this. Even though I *hate* vampires."

If she's getting changed, Temo gets with the spirit of it - his old Grand Dame party outfit, and Riglan has some smarter kit. But we take care though to make sure that armour layers are still present and incorporated.

We open the door; a guard is there; we are led to another part of the building. Darker hallways. A heavier carpet. Through beautiful old oak double doors, we enter a hunting room. Riglan has to suppress a shudder. A high ceiling, enough for a mezzanine on one side, a massive, beautiful fireplace - but with mounted trophy heads all over the walls. All different animals. Hunting for sport, implied, not for need. Riglan doesn't even recognise some. There's even a dire wolf; and one that looks part humanoid, part wild animal. Some kind of hybrid. A heavy, dark wooden table is set with a linen runner down the middle. Five seats. We are shown to, and take ours.

Lots of cutlery. Many table decorations. Riglan has to check in with Temo about the cutlery ordering, he's not seen this kind of thing in a while!

A side door opens. Servants bring in food. A small suckling pig is laid down (and that's enough for at least 5 of us, but of course, tonnes more arrives) - a trout, a plate with two wood roasted wood pigeons, bowls of vegetables, some jellies and so-on. Riglan whispered that to Temo, "can vampires even *eat* real food like this?"

From the main doors, we hear a voice call - "Oh, I eat just fine!" - it's the Duke, arm-in-arm with the Lady, who chuckles. "You can't believe *all* the stories you hear about vampires! My darling husband is really quite civilised." Riglan says, "Oh, well, it's mostly a lack of experience; but we've seen enough to know that not *all* undead are bad."

The Duke looks in his late 50s. Streaks of grey in the hair, almost shoulder-length, pulled back and tied back. Ruggedly handsome thing going on. Salt & pepper beard. Perhaps a hunter himself once. He's in a dining jacket, very different vibe from Darkon Manor and quite different from the timelessness of the Lady. He takes a seat at the head of the table. She takes a seat to his right. We're on the other side. But then, we notice a small other placement and chair set at the opposite head - but it's a small chair, not pulled out. It doesn't have any of the other things the other five places have - no drinks poured, no bread. Wine is offered, mead, etc.; we politely accept things but don't drink much to keep sharp.

The Lady notices, of course. (In later conversation she says "call me Elizabeth"). They set an extra place for their long-lost son, apparently, whenever there is formal dining. He was killed in war, a few years ago. "I'm sorry about that", says Riglan. "This is how kingdoms are made" says the Lady.

We get into a few things about the lands here doing better than further away. The acknowledge that tithes from Citeaux have increased and it's hard. The Lady uses a lot of her powers to maintain the land locally. They say "at least we're not at war; I don't think we could survive another one so soon after the last". The Duke eventually asks if we want to eat before we get into more; sure, why not.

We mention that they must've noticed we're not "from these parts". The Lady agrees; she's reminded of a visitor, who arrived on a wagon with four werewolf heads! A good hunter, but dark. Seemed portentious somehow. A destiny, maybe; like she sees in us.

* We talk about the tithes - villagers thought reasonable at first, later less so
* We're asked what the villages thoguht they did with the children? We don't know
* The Duke and Lady thing - "they must think we're eating them?!"
* That was our impression - but clearly, not true; the kids we found and the devastated village finding a child inside a deer
* They tell us about a parliament at Citeaux. It rules by decree. It has prescriptions for a standing army, in times of war. They take all children when they turn 9 to train and educate them there; be given a place in the society and government, or in the army
* These needs have increased to unsustainable levels - not enough children left in the country (Riglan interjects, "there are *no* children left")
* Some say Citeaux is afraid that provinces might rise up against taxation, and does this to weaken them while strengthening itself.
* However... "Since the last war there have been increasing, very disturbing reports of these children - and entire patrols who are bringing them to the city - disappearing, without a trace. It is getting harder and harder as nights get longer. It appears that winter has set in, in the most unusual way; we've lost our seasons and that's why crops are suffering. It seems that every season that passes, a deeper winter sets in. Something is afoot. The lands are more dangerous. The needs from Citeaux increase every time a patrol goes missing. We're just not getting enough from further afield. I have four fiefdoms under me" - he looks Riglan straight in the eye - "please tell me truthfully. Is Darkon skimming?" Wisdom saving only 18. Riglan chuckles. He says "I feel that magic. And *this time* it worked. I hoped perhaps to not 'throw them under the bus' - but yes. And they're worried you'll find out."

Riglan insight 26, trying to figure out if they're legit - are they as "good" as they make out, or just playacting? Well they're not telling us everything and there's a game here but it isn't sinister. They're not toying with us.

At this thought, Riglan talks about the witherling attack and shows them the talisman. He sees Elizbeth briefly recoil from it! A momentary look of surprise and disgust; then concernl; then she recovers her composure. "Darling. It's - it's a council seal. Why would Witherling vamp... - and also, *who* would do that, that's not permitted?!" - the Duke answers, "No, last I checked it was not permitted to turn other races; that's tantamount to slavery. Someone is breaking the rules! Could this be to mislead? Could this be to make the council scapegoats?" Elizabeth considers it; "I can investigate that. Does anyone feel like dessert?" Temo says, "If the dessert is as good as the main course, for sure!"

After, she wants to run magic checks on a talisman at her study. We're even invited up. It's in tower, no windows, lots of books, a bit macabre in places due to the nature of spell components! There are also cages with things like bats in. There's a ritual, with a bowl; she takes a dove, seems to try to comfort it - but then slits its throat - she tries to continue to comfort it as it bleeds out and Riglan's about to act, but then the Duke is called to heal the wound and the weak, but living dove is put back into its cage with food and water. There are various powders added, a flash and some smoke; the talisman is put into the bowl, then she adds her *own* blood - ah, so she does have that! - and the Duke heals that too (in both cases, by *licking* the wound closed, weird). Eventually she pulls out the talisman, cleans it and dries it, hands it back to us.

She holds the bowl with its strange mixture, takes a spoonful of it and goes to a strange crystalline stand with a thin layer of liquid in a pool. She pours in the spoonful; various patterns; she seems to complete a spell. Temo recognises (arcana 15) some strange kid of divination arcana, but isn't sure what it is. It seems like old, old magic - clearly drew on life force, literal blood, rather than drawing from the Weave. Maybe something like Legend Lore.

Ghostly visions start appearing in flashes across mist that forms above the thin, shallow pool. She studies it a while. Riglan sees gnolls being starved, kept in cages; someone in heavy purple and gold robes, a couple of orc thugs at its side, hooded though, face not visible; as the gnolls are almost dying the figure goes in as if to bite the neck; offers a drink of its own blood; this is how they get turned.

Riglan is disgusted by the site - chilled to his core.

Visions shift. A warren of stone tunnels and underground rooms. A city scene; rain, wet streets; blurry street lamps. It is seen from the first person. Riglan's perspective is of this person; this is a Legend Lore spell, so this is a perspective of the person that originally wore this talisman - the perspective of a gnoll; other people yell and run away at the sight of "him". Abandoned farmhouses, barns; villages attacked and devoured, feasted upon.

A silhouette, seems to be burning almost, with horns on its head, stands in a doorway with a tail, forked. Demon-like, momentarily. Hard to tell if it's Nethza.

A piece of clothing; a leather wrap; **Riglan recognises this is *his***, a gnoll and its brother are sniffing; the visions fade. Riglan searches for the leather wrap - it's not there - can't remember when he last saw it! History only 12.

We've no idea *who* might be looking for us! We mention the Raven Queen but neither Duke nor Lady have heard of her and didn't know other gods could influence this domain. We explain what we know about that (the Shadar Kai) as well as a magical detection of a *third* influence above Citeaux.

(Along the way, we realise that the Lady is in fact not yet undead, though she thinks she might voluntarily be so, soon).

It's late. The Lady says she'd offer us a room, but doesn't think we'd be comfortable in their company! Well, actually, we're worried that *we* might bring things to the keep, if we're being hunted! The Lady is confident they are quite capable of defending themselves. We'd kinda like a change of scenery anyway.

We're seen out. Murray is relieved! We're free, we're told; not needed back tomorrow. The Duke looks to the sky. "Ah. Not quite a half-moon yet". As we head to the horses, he asks if we're going to Citeaux tomorrow. "I think we have to." "It's a week's ride; you should be able to get there before Full Moon". Riglan says, "Ah yes, The Hunt!" We'll pass through at least one other Duchy along the way.

We thank them, and ride off to the inn, paying for one night. It's a sleepy inn. 2gp, just for the room, but at least it's comfortable - not spartan. Enough beds for everyone. Even a small toilet on each floor.

Temo wants to set up the Hut inside the room, but it would be too big! We'll have to take our chances. Maireagh casts Alarm on doors and windows instead.

We chat for a while - what a very strange, very unexpected evening; at least we're not dead... Eventually, we sleep.
