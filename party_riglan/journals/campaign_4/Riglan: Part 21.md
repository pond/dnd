# Riglan: Part 21
## DAY 106

We awaken again in the sarcophagus room of the Fane, resolved to tackle the fire cult and try to find and rescue both Teresiel and as many other hostages as we can.

Riglan thinks about spells; he's not summoned fey in a while and water would be useful for the fire cult. He memorises Tidal Wave, allowing himself to forget Summon Fey for a while; he also doubles down on Revivify, so he doesn't have to rely on charges in his staff (can't remember what I swapped out for that! Oops).

We make our way back towards the floating disk via the minotaur caverns. Riglan lets himself be led by Temo initially to avoid needing Darkvision, as we head out and start our way across the mine area. We go through the door - it's bright light! Riglan perception 12+9. The cavern where the minotaur and nothic were hiding out is very warm as we approach. Temo creeps up to peer around the corner; stealth 8+13. The brazier in the room is brightly lit - virtually a small inferno - perception 14+3; no other creatures; the fire is not a natural fire (arcana 17) but he doesn't know more than that. Riglan, survival 20+9; this isn't the only way to get to the floating disc room.

We creep back into the mine and, having a rough idea of layout, head for the as-yet unexplored nearer Southward exit on the same rough side of the mine chamber, seeing if we can find an alternative route. Much more bioluminescence creates dim light. There's a carved tunnel; the railway terminates in some collapsed tunnel wall, but some of the rubble has been cleared leading to a snaking section that opens to a wider, natural tunnel. Eventually there's an alcove on the right with some stone steps - we realise it heads to minotaur barracks; we vaguely recognise the room; Temo creeps up - stealth 17+13 - the room is empty. Interestingly, the Emberhorns have not returned and the room isn't reoccupied. A small fire in the middle of the room has gone out. Temo has to use his goggles. When Temo comes down, his goggles let him see further along the tunnel through the very dim light. He spots another weird dark area and, curiosity piqued, investigates; perception 20+3. 

It's a strange chamber that is a kind of blob with tunnels leading off like octopus arms. It's dimly lit with a purple/blue glow. At the top, the cavern rises up in a strange mushroom shape. In the centre of the chamber, is a statue depicting a shape similar to the cavern itself - an amorphous body with thick tentacles - but part of it is reared up and hunched over, as if to feed on something in the middle. One eye, at the top of what might pass for a head, is a purple crystal that glows with purple light. The crystal is huge, bigger than Temo's head! He fetches the others. Religion check: 2+3. He has no idea! Riglan has been reading something of the area (History Of The Region 8 out of 10) but only gets 11-1 - no idea. Nethza knows! Religion 19+1 -> an ancient evil - **Ghaunadaur**. It is a depiction of a dark god, not worshipped in this realm as far as she knows. She's heard stories; it's an extraplanar, demonic-associated being from the Far Realms and considered the God of Oozes. Maireagh: Perception total 20. The chamber is not just old, it's *very* old - all of it is *thousands* of years old. It predates the ziggurat, so we're not sure but it could be the genesis of what became the Fane, or just from an earlier iteration of the cult, thousands of years ago.

She notes that the crystal has magic on it, but it isn't a gem; it's just glass, but imbued with magic. Nethza warns not to touch it! The name that she knows this God by, is actually a Drow name for "That Which Lurks In The Darkness". Looking at the "tentacles" we find that *every* arm terminates in a wall of darkness, like those we've already been through before. The whole thing is very strange! It seems totally out of place. Riglan survival 4+9 - that's just about enough - east/west, Ziggurat, water; this is close to the middle. If there was a centre, this might be it.

There being no evident or obvious "presence" / entity here, we head back and go up was we intended, to the now-empty Emberhorn sleeping chamber. We head to the disc room. It's not there! Riglan thinks for a moment and figures that maybe the divination vision's command words call the disc as well as move it. He says, "Embers" - because we want to ascend. We wait for a minute or two, growing more nervous as time passes - but after about a minute, the disc slowly appears. Phew. It was down below; lucky guess (but then, we think Vanifer is hiding out down there). Riglan picks up the dog and steps on. Temo and Maireagh manage to squeeze in around him and Nethza stands on too, virtually hugging Riglan - we do fit and, nervous though we are, the disc does not fall. **Riglan "Embers" again and the disc starts to rise**.

The disc keeps moving for a few minutes.It's very hot at first, but gradually diminishes. We finally stop at a 50ft wide gaping hole; above is darkness; above is the red glow; nearby we notice to the West a wooden extension of a stone platform close to where we are hovering, but it's a 10ft jump. Riglan ties a rope around his waist, gives Nethza the other end and jumps to the wooden platform. Riglan, Perception total 15+9; he can hear the sounds of what seems to be a foundry - there's a corridor that leads away to a t-junction. Riglan backs away onto the safety of the stone ledge, braces himself against a possible fall; Temo jumps and makes it - Acrobatics 19. A quiet landing. Maireagh throws Riglan the dog and comes over, the rope at hand in case needed; finally, Nethza, bringing her end of the rope, jumps and also - just! - makes it.

The lighting is relatively good here after the Fane. Flickering of flames. Riglan calls a spider and sends it down towards the foundry noises along the roof. It gets to the t-junction and finds that either side exits into a *huge* chamber, noisy, bright and very warm. At the far end, a stone wall has carved spouts fashioned to look like dwarves holding urns - and lava pours out of each into runnels that lead to some kind of forge, in the form of four workstations are at the end of each runnel; the lava obviates the need for heat. A couple of eternal flame guardians are wearing their usual goggles and armed. A strange-looking human is present, with ashen, spiked-up hair and full plate armour with a glowing, molten lava heart shape in the centre of his chest. There are 3 Azers - "dwarves made of fire"  - and a salamander, a fire elemental that looks rather like a flaming snake. They're each working one of the four workstations but seem to be taunted or at least "encouraged" to work. It's not sure if they're being coerced or just driven to work hard. Above it all is a flaming Efreeti, floating up, bright light. As Riglan watches through the spider, a whip of molten rock leaps out to the salamander, which seems to speed up in response.

This looks like the industrial heart of Besilmir - the chamber is maybe 100ft wide by 80ft deep from the wall we are behind, to the wall with the pouring lava statues. On the left/right sides are 20ft wide grand stairs that head up maybe 20ft, leading to other areas Riglan can't see via the spider.

Riglan, insight 17+5: He is pretty sure that the salamander is angry and resentful when whipped. The Efreeti is not an ally. It regards the guardians and armoured man with hatred.

Riglan pulls the spider back and briefly explains the remarkable situation beyond. We aren't sure if we should attack now or be stealthy as we don't know what's nearby. First thing - go to the right - spider heads up the 20ft wide stairs on the right hand side, from our perspective. A wide, long corridor ahead; some stairs leading up on the left and a long corridor with pairs of regularly spaced doors on the right lining both walls. The first few are stone and then there are bars.

* The spider sneaks under the first, stone, Southward door. They're of the rotating kind we're familiar with now, but there is a gap. Living quarters - a charred tapestry by the wall, a bed; and sat at a writing desk, a smouldering human that looks like all of its skin has been badly burned. Cracks in its skin show glowing underneath, like magma under a layer of cooling stone. No armour.

* Opposing, Northward door; empty room, but living quarters. Next Southern door, also solid; same deal; Northward opposing door is open with the same deal.

* Along down the corridor roof, looking into the barred door rooms. Salamanders occupy all four of the northern cells. Three of the four southern cells hold two azers each - six in total! The last is empty. The spider goes a bit out of range to see the far end cells but comes back quickly and can convey enough through telepathy / memory to get a feel for it.

Riglan thanks the spider and pops it back to investigate the other 20ft wide exit, heading South. The stairs open to a wide E-W corridor, that runs maybe 80ft in either direction; terminating in stairs on the right (West) and on the left (East) another t-junction. Stone and metal sconces are set in the walls, lighting the corridor clearly. There are three doors in the corridor South wall. All closed. Spider sneaks in the rightmost door first, over the top. Dex 14; it is just able to squeeze in. Lots of heat in the room - four hellhounds pacing around in a small chamber. Middle room - dex 10; it can't find a gap. Last (left) room - dex 20+2 - gets in easily. Dark, but visible; same style of room as the hellhounds; but piled up with, well, "things". No people.

The plan then: Temo sneaks around to the cells, wearing the helm. Uses cantrip illusions to try and convey the notion of opening the doors and attacking the guards / Efreeti. Maireagh has to use a L2 spell to make him invisible. Riglan can watch via the spider & once they're out, we'll come into the foundry room and try to surprise the guards & Efreeti in attack.

We start the plan. Maireagh makes Temo invisible and he tries to sneak around. Stealth: 3,10+13 -> 23. As he tries to get through the foundry, he steps on a bit of loose shingle on a step which shifts and makes a noise and a puff of falling dust. The plate armour guy is looking that way at the time and sees it. The spider notices the guard moving towards the steps. Temo perception 4+3, so he doesn't notice. He gets up the stairs and turns into the corridor; the spider gets to the junction with the corridor and looks at the guard. It has bent down to examine the stairs. Temo gets to the roughly the middle of the cells area, so there are scary salamanders and azers around. The spider doesn't know where Temo is, but watches the guard still; the armoured person walks up the stairs looking around, trying to figure out what's going on. Temo, perception 12+3, glancing around before he casts anything - he sees the guard get to the top of the stairs... Temo crouches down on the floor watching the corridor entrance waiting to see if the guard walks back. After a couple of minutes, the guard walks back; still looking around; on alert though. Temo gives it another minute, thinks for a second, then walks back to near the solid doors and makes himself visible by pushing the the ajar door, which moves, revealing his presence and breaks the spell. He walks cautiously up to where he was before.

He wants to convey that he's not an enemy when he appears thus - he makes eye contact with a salamander; persuasion nat 20+12, 32. It is cautious but does not otherwise react. He starts casting his minor illusions in rotation - closed cells, open cells, attack Efreeti. The spider observes this going on. How good are his illusions? He rolls a natural 2, FML. Only 9 total (intelligence-based performance). It's basically 2D, rather than the 3D thing he wants them all to see. He shows the salamander, persuasion total 15; the salamander leans forward - "Who are you?", distrustfully; Temo takes off the helm, points at the helm, points at his ears, the says, "Temo. Friend", but can only say that in Common, then puts the helm back on. Persuasion for next cell, dirty 25. The two salamanders quietly talk, unsure if it's a trick. This kind of trick has been played on them before. One says, "But we need to get out of here to go back down where we come from" then "But they are too powerful and the azers will report us for they are treacherous" - the azers hiss at them, accusing them of being bigots and racists! They're all slaves. Listening to this, Temo tries again with his imagery. Getting the hang of it now - performance 24. Same thing - open the doors, attack the Efreeti with the party, but then he also shows the shaft and disc, the exit, tries to convey that this is close by. "We have no need for that". One azer says, "Little gnome, how do you expect to get us out of here? How do you know we will not betray you?" A salamander asks, "What is in it for you?" so Temo tries to show Teresiel in a cage, then free; Vanifer as best he can imagine her, being attacked. They have not seen the first woman. Temo just shrugs; he takes the risk. He goes to the cage of the salamander that seemed to be arguing in his favour and tries to unlock it (mage hand) -> 24 sleight of hand. The salamander looks at him - "We need weapons if you need us to fight"; an azer says, "That cell at the end - they never put anyone in there..." - seems like a hint. Temo nods, he turns to the spider & points at the corner cell, then heads there - the far Southern cell; the spider can get close but can't follow all the way. It's not locked and Temo quietly goes inside. It's a cell. Investigation - 14+11; a trapdoor maybe, or something? Straw and dirt on the floor is swept clean in the middle, leading to the middle of the back wall. He notices a strange looking stone and a very, very well disguised door rotates, leading to an armoury! Hanging against the centre of the wall is a gleaming, beautiful, magic shield; but also racks of old weapons. Temo takes a javelin, and brings it back to the salamander; he points at the far cell.

Temo faces a choice - release everyone? Just the salamanders? The azers? There's no way to know. Temo shows an illusion of the salamanders being let free. Then he shows an illusion of the azers being let free after. "Let us out! Let us out!" insist the azers. He tries to show illusions indicating that if they fight each other, they'll just end up imprisoned again. Persuasion: Lucky roll, 26, but disadvantage as it's via illusions; 18. Everyone calms down a bit. Phew. Everyone eyes each other warily and Temos open all cages. The salamanders arm themselves. SOH check adv., 19+13 -> 32! They're all open within a minute. 

(Back behind the wall in the disc room, Riglan's demeanour has gone from very tense and a raised hand and ears that kept Maireagh and Nethza on alert, to suddenly more relaxed and almost chuckling, as he sees Temo work his magic with the locks).

The first salamander comes out with the shield, giving it to Temo! "You released us. This will keep you from dying." He can't wield it but can hold it and hide to give himself a bit of cover. It means he'll have a hand free for his crossbow, but if he wanted to use a wand he'd have to drop something or stow something.

Temo points to the door where Riglan said the strange fire guy was and uses a minor illusion to indicate a bad guy, hoping that the others understand that a foe lies beyond and may try to attack from there. Then he looks up at the spider and gives it a thumbs up, then shrugs, he indicates with his fingers that he'll follow the spider out. So Riglan whispers to his party that we're going to launch our surprise and the intention is that we'll come out into the forge at the same time as he tells his spider to come down the stairs.

3, 2, 1...

Initiative by group - flat D20s:

* Temo's group: Rolls a nat 1, so re-rolls, rolls a nat 2! Oh well... That's following the spider!
* Temo personally: 11
* Riglan's group: 16 (Riglan rolled 11, Nethza & Maireagh both got 16; we decided to keep it simple)

**We don't run this turn by turn for expediency.**

Riglan jumps in and sees that he can't use a tidal wave or he'll hit the forge workers. He casts Frostbite on an eternal flame guardian (9 damage). Nethza dons her cold armour and hexes the closest person to her. Maireagh throws the hammer at the next person and the dog runs up to attack.

Temo runs around the corner with the spider. He looks down the corridor away from the forge, to see if anyone else is coming. Quiet so far. He runs to the top of the stairs and looks down into the forge; he sees the dog attacking someone so fires at them with his crossbow but misses.

The hexed flame guardian looks around, sees Nethza and yells, "Get her!", drawing his sword, setting it aflame and running into attack. The second hits but Nethza resists the fire part of the damage. The flaming heart plate guy picks up a spear and joins the fray, taking a moment to whip at the Azers and shouting, "defend us, or your kin die!" (but they were actually so high in the initiative roll that they 'acted' - carrying on forging - before he says this, so they don't act yet). He throws the spear at Maireagh, who deflects it with her shield. Grabbing a second spear and grasping with both hands, he charges Maireagh and does some damage.

Running around the corner from the prison end, we see six Azers yelling something that Riglan doesn't understand (but Temo does, as he still has the helm - "We are freed! This... Dwarfling?... Has released us! We fight alongside him for our freedom! Toil no more under the whips of these false priests!"). From behind them slither out the salamanders, with various weapons, all starting to glow with red heat. They head straight for the Efreeti.

The guardian with the dog nearby, that Temo had just missed, shouts, "No! No, who let you out?!" and pulls out a whip that we see is made of a strange dark metal, and tries to whip at the salamanders (the dog misses an opp attack). The whip cuts them, but the salamanders appear to be very hardy and are largely unfazed.

The Efreeti looks around, sees Temo and hurls flame at him. Temo's caught completely by surprise (dex save nat 2! + 9) but Maireagh shouts, "He's aiming high!" giving him a flash of genius inspiration, so his save is 16, he makes it and is not hurt. Angry, the Efreeti curses - "What a waste!" - and brings his hands first up, then slams them down to the ground and a pulls up dripping strange magma from around him which forms into a flame elemental.

The forge salamander, overlooked somewhat by everyone, swings around behind the Efreeti and tries to grapple him but he's too big; tries to bite; they're tangling; the Efreeti manages to push the salamander away. The three forge Azers rush towards their friends who throw weapons towards them, which they catch. A united front forms.

Riglan sees an opportunity to hit the elemental. He could hit the Efreeti too but it'd hit the salamander in that case, and he doesn't know what Temo really understands of the arrangement, so he can't risk appearing to hurt theoretical allies. He just goes for the elemental, and does hit but only gets 22 damage. He activates his staff as this is all quite close-quarters. Maireagh, seeing this, also changes target and throws her hammer at the elemental, hitting twice and throwing in a Branding Smite at the same time. This means the dog can only dodge. Nethza, with a hex on, and engaged in melee with one of the guardians, attacks with the longsword, hitting only with the first as he dodges the second. She jolts him with some psychic damage too. Temo can see through all the Azers and Salamanders to the flaming heart guy (razorblast). He aims and fires, hitting for 28.

The eternal flame guardian attacking Nethza misses twice. Meanwhile, Temo notices the door in the cell corridor open and realises with shock that he'd totally forgotten to keep an aim on that for the mage-like, burnt person he knew was inside. He shouts a warning to the temporary allies in front. Temo sees the person emerge, spot him, and immediately cast Magic Missile, so Temo reacts with Shield. He sees no less than five missiles dissipate against the magical barrier. The guy then kind of explodes in flame, completely wreathed in it.

The razorblast charges at the azers, attacking three time with his spear. One is knocked clean off its feet. "Bring the tormenter down to his knees!" cries one of them and all of them jump onto him, pummelling him down to the ground through sheer weight of the five that were still on their feet. They get him down prone. The salamanders continue to target the Efreeti. They get close, but this gives the fire elemental an opportunity attack on one - but the salamander is totally unharmed and they just ignore the creature. It seems they're fully immune to damage. It works both ways though - the Efreeti seems to be immune to their attacks too, which they soon realise.

The first eternal flame guardian yells out, "Karon! Karon, we need you down here!" then with his flaming sword, runs towards Riglan. He attacks twice, but only hits once (6+3 damage).

The Efreeti suddenly grows in size, from large to huge - 10ft to 18ft tall! He sweeps his arm across and knocks back all of the approaching salamanders. He pulls out a scimitar off his back and slices at the forge salamander, which is badly injured. In retaliation it whips its tail trying to wrap around the Efreeti's leg to grapple it, and achieves this. The salamander burns even brighter with this contact but of course this causes no harm.

The three forge Azers now also pile onto the Razorblast, attacking, but then there's a big explosion of bits of metal, magma and stone fly out, cutting into all of the Azers and injuring them. The razorblast is dead, but it took 9 Azers to do it and its strange heart of fire exploded.

Riglan is now confronted by an eternal flame guardian nearby and realises he can line up the guardian and Efreeti so he uses his wand again. The guardian dodges, but it's a strong bolt of lightning - 16 to the guardian, 33 to the Efreeti who gets hit full-on. Riglan now has the Efreeti's attention - oops! - "What is that small creature there? Who dares attack *me?!*"... Maybe a tactical error! Riglan calls down his bear totem, considering the Azers and Salamanders to be allies. All of us gain resolve and strength except the most distant and unfortunately injured salamander. Maireagh now throws her hammer at the guardian in front of Riglan and both just hit; the guardian falls. The dog attacks the guardian that's on Nethza, hitting; Nethza hits once again too, with more psychic damage; this guardian falls as well.

Temo has to risk it. He shouts once again a warning about the strange flame mage and takes aim, firing. He hits for 27, but Temo is surprised to see that it doesn't seem to injure him as much as expected. This strange mage (flamewrath) is hardy - and now even more angry. He looks at Temo and grins, throwing a fireball! Temo has a flash of inspiration and rolls *forwards*, towards the mage slightly, flattening himself against the floor to miss the worst of it. There is a tremendous blast in the corridor T-junction and bits of rock and stone rain down; Temo is only caught on the very edge.

The Azers rush the fire elemental as a unit. They sort of run and leap in their attacks. The Azers are all aflame, brightly lit, hard to look at directly; but it's fire and fire, so we can't tell how effective this attack might be. The four prisoner salamanders now also work together, with their forge friend grappling its leg, two grapple the other leg. They yank at the Efreeti to try and get it to fall over; they get it down on one knee, with one hand down; the other two try to hold its hand down. The Efreeti is now really angry; a ring of fire and force blasts out creating a wall of fire at least 10ft tall. The fire is of no consequence but the force pushes some of them away. "Enough!" it cries - "Imbeciles!" - it looks at the fallen cultists and says, "I'm *done!* I'm going below!" - and he pulls open some strange *hole* in the fabric of reality itself; some of us can see through to a crazy, flaming plane that seems to have liquid fire falling from the sky; **he plane shifts away!**

Riglan heaves a big sigh of relief at that...

The injured forge salamander pushes through the wall of fire, looking for the Efreeti; it screams in frustration at the escape. The Azers continue to take down the fire elemental, doing basically no damage!

Maireagh sees the fireball and dashes up towards where Temo was - "Temo! Temo! Are you alright?!" - she sees the mage and throws her hammer twice, hitting both times for around 28 damage. She calls the dog up but it can't quite reach the mage yet. Riglan shouts to the Azers - but in only Common - "Get clear! Then I can throw magical ice at it!" - thinking Ice Storm, but for now all he can do is Frostbite - they're all over the elemental so he can't use the lightning wand. The elemental fails to dodge and Riglan does manage to get a decent hit, normally 10 damage; but the elemental is vulnerable and it takes 20, as parts of it freeze. Riglan is surprised and happy at the outcome.

Nethza does something Riglan hasn't seen before. She can see the elemental has been hit quite hard now. A strange ripple traces along her longsword, which looks strangely familiar to the way that the Efreeti had opened up its hole to another plane - the edges of the sword appear to be somehow between planes, or cutting through them somehow. The first attack of the sword hits, but seems to hit normally; on the second strike, though, she seems to be able to tear reality itself with her sword, causing a bright flash of yellow/red light as the elemental starts to implode in on itself and seems to suddenly be dragged back to its realm. Just like, it's gone! (Banishing Smite).

Temo hasn't got a choice. He has to try again, aims and fires; he sees Maireagh and the dog and trusts them. He shouts, "Gotta take him down!". 29 damage. Not enough to take it down but it's looking considerably more rough than it did before... And the mage responds in kind. It sees the characters arrayed in front of it and casts a huge spray of fire out, exploding forth from its hands (Burning Hands, but at a very high level). Temo doesn't even have a chance to shout a warning as he only has a chance to dive out of the way (dex save 27). The agile dog avoids the worst of it too, but Maireagh takes full blast - thank goodness she has some damage resistance (dog & Maireagh both take 11).

The Azers now gather and regard the Salamanders. The Salamanders in turn gather and look at the Azers... Oh dear...

Maireagh throws her hammer twice at the mage, hitting both times; this takes it down. Temo runs down the stairs, sees the standoff, positions himself between the two groups and starts casting illusions of more guards, being back in the prison, and motioning with his hands that they should just leave and not fight. We just don't want the noise, more than anything else! He points arrows towards the shaft. Performance roll is 16, persuasion is 16. The salamanders start to pull back, weapons still readied and retreat towards the shaft, then climb down. Temo steps aside to let the Azers leave. They look around, generally more aggressive, waiting for the salamanders. Then they look to us and one says, "Do not trust them. Do not trust them! It is they who are treacherous. We are of our word." They bow to Temo, run to the lava and jump in, disappearing.

Temo takes off the helm, sees everyone looking confused and Maireagh asks "What's that on your back?!" talking about the shield. Riglan, though, remembers the shout for Karon; insight 15. Riglan from context, given where the guard was looking when shouting, thinks it might've been the mage. He tells the party to keep alert but says he thinks Karon may be dead now.

We check all bodies before chucking everything into the lava and using the cleaning stone to clean up any blood, but with all the fire, there's not much. The fireball damage can't really be hidden. We'll the bodies, then the mage's room. Temo investigation: good roll, 27... But there's not much to be found. There are a few red crystal gems, not rubies, that Maireagh thinks are worth maybe 40gp and that's it. The expensive thing is on Temo's back - the shining shield. We examine it. Maireagh is quite excited by it; there's a strange gear on the front that she realises rotates about once an hour. Temo offers it to her immediately - it would surely be a useful upgrade for her and the timepiece on the front is very in keeping. Temo hugs Maireagh and thanks her sincerely for running to his rescue.

We figure that there's a good chance of this mess being discovered, so we retreat to the armoury. We close the prison-side door and between Riglan, using his spider, and Temo, using his mage hand guided by Riglan's instructions, we move some of the straw around to make it less obvious that the door was recently opened.

This room, we think, is kind of behind the shaft with the floating disc, which sits between us and the forge. We see that it has another door, which is clearly rarely used; there are cobwebs over part of it. For now, we figure this isn't the worst ever place to rest, so we take an hour. Temo investigates a bit (only 15); he notices that in the corner behind a stack of weapons, is a very worn-out, almost falling-apart boot. With shock he realises there's a body - well, a skeleton, very old - of some pour soul that just died there. The armoury must be very old. He finds a small journal, but will need some light and the Helm to read it, but Maireagh, who's helping, takes it and says she can read it. It's written in Dethek, a dialect of Dwarven spoken by surface dwarves of Besilmir. 

Apparently this individual was running the forge. He was promoted to head of an expedition that, when they were running low on fuel, found a lava tube; they then built the channels and mechanisms to direct the lava and use that as a heat source instead. The lava tubes were the reason for them exploration, but the journal alludes to discoveries through these tubes that divided the team he was leading in some way; "the king's subjects do not all agree that this is right, the *only* course of action. I have seen what is down there; I agree with the king; but there is nowhere else for us to go. I shall hope that at least we could hide in the sturdier parts of our stronghold. I may retreat to the armoury, built into solid stone. Perhaps we might survive long enough for rescuers to come and dig us out." - that's the last entry. Another sad account.

### (6039 XP) -> Surprise level 10 bump

> The XP comes from rescuing Deseyna, rescuing her, getting her to Riverguard Keep & arranging safe passage, getting back down mostly avoiding detection in both directions, scouting the area, finding the prisoner Azers & Salamanders, convincing them to fight for us, doing the battle.

Riglan learns Greater Restoration, since he thinks he has more L5 ability now (2 instead of 1). Could be useful for Unrayle. New cantrip, Primal Savagery. Decides to drop Summon Elemental in favour of Fire Shield. Temo learns Invisibility, new cantrip, Message; he drops Firebolt for Ray Of Frost. In terms of colour & story, we tried to have these all make sense - e.g. we're in a fire area, Temo's not used Firebolt for ages, sees Riglan's Frostbite & swaps; Message is just his style; Invisibility is so he's more independent instead of relying so much on others; and as for Riglan, he's been worried about petrification and Unrayle ever since learning about the medusa and remembering the strange procession & spectral ship he witnessed on our original first journey to Yartar; he's recognised that fighting two elementals is flawed, since each has vulnerability or immunity to the damage of the other; he also knows that he can easily get taken out by fireballs after Scarlet Moon Tower but had forgotten (more or less) right up until one was just thrown at Temo, so the shield is very useful.

(We don't play the rest of today with things that would normally require a long rest, e.g. spell swaps, but allow new spells learned from extra 'slots' due to L10).

We see the other exit and decide to go South, through that door, intending to keep right and think we should basically end up navigating all around the shaft with the floating disc and getting back to the forge.

The door is quite stiff. Maireagh + Riglan (adv. athl, total 19). There's some rubble on the other side; it looks like it's not normally opened this way. We push it shut after us and kick some of the rubble back so it looks less disturbed, just in case!

It's a strange triangular space. We're at one corner. It's quite dark, but perception disadv. nat 20,16 + 9 -> 25 -> there seem to be rows, some broken, some intact, of what were maybe stone bookshelves once, some with remnants of wooden parts but none with wood intact. Collapsed, ruined piles of books look like they're almost turning to mush. Clearly once a library, but long since decayed. In the most damaged areas there seems to be a brown-ish strange fungus that may be responsible for the damage, but it hasn't engulfed everything. It warrants more study perhaps but would require many hours to see if anything interesting was here. Riglan, nature check - Nat 27 + 7 - he recognises the family; we should stay well clear of it. It is actually quite powerful and can consume living tissue, not just dead tissue; while related to natural fungi, it is an unnatural mould.

We head along the long diagonal side to a Westward exit. After a short distance it turns left (South) and enters an intersection; we can continue South or continue West. Southwards there seems to be a strange chamber of an unusual curving shape. For now, we turn to the West - keep right - Riglan eventually recognises the corridor with the three doors where the hellhounds were. As we go along, around 100ft in we see the doors and the stairs down to the foundry. Ahead the corridor continues some distance - maybe about 100ft more. We know how that connects now, so we decide to stick to what we think is the Eastward edge of this temple now. We see that strange curving wall and head South towards it.

The room has two strange curving walls on two of the corners, with a statue in the middle. Riglan stumbles right in there - two armed guards, so have to fight!

Initiative:

* Temo 19
* Riglan 18
* Nethza 16
* Maireagh 7

These are guardians, with breastplates and longswords. One sets his sword aflame and charges at Riglan, attacking twice; despite being surprised and absent minded in his unguarded wanderings today, Riglan manages to block both attacks. He makes a mental note to use the spider more! Temo holds his fire to get a good aim at the other one, while Riglan reacts with a poison spray, which is effective but only 10 damage. He activates his staff. The Voice of Ilpharn activates and says, with a note of humour to the voice, "Not again?!"

Nethza transfers her hex to Riglan's aggressor and throws two Eldritch Blasts. Both hit, for 15 and 19. The guard is almost taken down by all of the sudden attacks, but not quite! As this happens, Temo sees his moment & aims, firing at the other guard's leg, saying "he's trying to run!". He hits, for a high 35 damage. Maireagh gets the hint and pushes past Riglan's attacker (opp attack triggered, but misses); she throws her hammer twice; she hits once and that's enough to take down the guard. She commands the dog to attack the remaining guard on Riglan, hitting for 10. This other guard falls.

Temo and Maireagh have no idea what the statue is but surprisingly, Riglan recognises it; it's not a Dwarven god; it's a spirit of nature. An old, fey, adopted-to-folklore naturalist worship of spirits vibe. Besilmir's above-ground connections perhaps? It's been deliberately damaged, though, quite recently.

Riglan now has a bit more caution and calls back his spider, asking it to walk along the roof through the exit the other guard had eyed up. A door to the left; stairs down. It finds a crack through the door to the left. It's a small room that looks T-shaped. Sleeping palates, enough for 4 people; apparently empty right now, though there's a further door, open, with movement beyond, and a second, but closed door. The open door is within range to approach more closely, so the spider gets a better look. Two more guards are here. The other closed door is harder to get into - spider dex 17+2 - it finds a way to squeeze in near the hinge. It's quite a big room that looks like it might have been well furnished once, but much of the furniture and tapestries are charred. There's a bed and large oak table in the middle on which is tied a muscular-looking human. Lying next to it is crab-shell shield and sawtoothed sword. A guardian from the water temple domain. "Questioning" this person is a female-looking humanoid, hair all burned off, the same heavily burned skin that we've seen before, wearing shimmering golden and red robes. There are two bookshelves at opposite corners of the room. Spider, perception 18+0: They're speaking common. "Stop lying to me! Stop lying! You're not escaping, running away! You're a spy. You're a spy for Gar Shatterkeel, that oafish druid that you call a leader. What is it you are *really* doing here. I don't believe for a second that your leaders have been killed. You're either a spy or a traitor and I don't know which is worse. You're not fooling us!" and she starts burning him with fire.

Riglan pops the spider back to the fey and quickly informs the party of what he saw; he is minded to rush in unwisely, we'll need some flame defence against the woman and some focus on the two guards. Riglan potentially could cover those; Temo could fire at range. Two fights in almost as many minutes! It's on.

Maireagh pushes open the door; a little noisy but they don't notice; Riglan creeps into the room (adv. stealth, 10,20 -> 20). Temo sneaks in too (stealth 30), hiding behind a bed; and then we decide to engage as it's too cramped for much of a plan. Initiative rolls are a bit low unfortunately:

* Nethza 16
* Temo 13
* Maireagh 13
* Riglan 6

Nethza gets in as far as she can, near Temo and the open door to the other two guards. Temo can clearly see a guard, so he fires from behind the bed unseen, hitting for 25; he ducks back and hides again (stealth 28). Maireagh outside hears - just! - the groaning from Temo's hit; she's able to run in and decides to go into the guard room, past Nethza; the dog follows.

In the room, the uninjured guard spins around and says, "You're not meant to be here! Intruders! Intruders!" - draws his sword and attacks Maireagh twice. She does get hit once, for 13 damage. Meanwhile, Riglan gets close to the door to the Flamewrath's room and holds, waiting to see if it opens, readying a poison spray.

Back in the far room, the injured guard moves in to attack Maireagh too, but misses twice. Nethza notices Riglan's stance and changes tactic, she runs to the door and pushes it open! She dashes straight in and hexes the Flamewrath. She shouts "Step away from him!" as Riglan is going, "Hey, I was waiting for her to - oh, never mind..." - and Nethza throws two eldritch blasts. The first hits, second misses; a low damage roll too; only 9. The Flamewrath narrows her eyes. "Big mistake! *You* might think that because you look like Vanifer that you have *any* control or power here - but you do not!"

Temo realises Maireagh is surrounded so jumps between the bunk bed layers then disengages to the corner of the room and fires at the previously injured guard. He just scrapes a hit and despite a low total damage roll of 25, he takes down that guard. Maireagh is now facing just the uninjured guard who hit her earlier; she tries to hit with her hammer twice. The first glances off his shield, the second hits for 14 damage. An arcane jolt deals 10 more. The dog runs around to flank, attacks and hits for 6.

In the Flamewrath's room, she says, "Who. Who *are* you anyway? It doesn't matter - you're not going to survive. You are *not* ruining my chances of being in charge!" and bursts into her flame form. From her staff, a strange imp appears; she whispers something to it and the imp disappears. Nethza shouts, "Guys? Um, Riglan, you know that spider thing you do? I think she's just done it with an imp... I think it's bad news..."

In the guard room, the guard now tries to attack; and once again, gets in a hit but only for 6 damage overall. It shouts, "Man down! Man down! Someone! Get Lizzy!" (who?!) "Protect Ignatia! They're trying to storm the barracks! It's short people!"

Riglan runs to the doorway that Nethza went through and looks through; he can see the Flamewrath. He shouts, "And just so you know, Gar Shatterkeel most certainly *is* dead and this fellow most certainly *would* have been running - the water temple and water node are both no more!" and fires his lightning wand... But she counterspells. "Lightning bolt? How quaint! What is this coordinated lying you're doing, you think I'm an idiot?!" and Riglan says "Nethza! That didn't work!" - then he uses his innate Hidden Step to go invisible, and gets into the room hopefully undetected, heading near to the bed.

Nethza looks at (we we might correctly guess is Ignatia, but could also be Lizzy) and says, "That was a mistake! Ha! Counterspell..." - and she throws a psychic lance, knowing it can't be countered. DC17 intelligence save; but the Flamewrath fails! 29 psychic damage; the sorcerer cannot act on her turn either.

Back in the guard room, Temo fires past the dog, hoping to hit but still be able to run. He gets a hit for 28 damage which takes down the guard. He runs all the way into the room and gets into the corner behind Nethza, shouting, "Maireagh! Follow me!"

Maireagh shouts, "I'm coming back for you" to the *cask of ale* in the room then gets all the way into melee range with her full movement; the dog likewise. "Where the fuck's Riglan gone?!" she shouts in exasperation. "What's happened to him? Has anyone seen him?" - Nethza says he just disappeared.

The Flamewrath can't act due to the headache, but then there's a portal that opens in the ground and another female mage pops into the room - Temo shouts, "Dimension door!" - and worse, she brings in what we think is a **Chimera** with her - a head of a lion, a goat and a *dragon*. Oh dear, that's not good. The new mage tries to get Ignatia to come to her senses - calling her name, so we know that the original Flamewrath isn't Lizzy, but maybe the new mage is. Ignatia regains her composure. "You did this?! You're not leaving here alive! There is no escape for you. No escape, I say!" - she looks at the Chimera - "Kill them all!"

Riglan reappears and gets a line of sight with the Chimera and the new mage. He tries his wand again; the chimera doesn't dodge, the mage does. The damage roll is dreadful, only 20. He can't really see anywhere to move in this now rather cramped room; he knows we're going to need healing; he calls down his Unicorn spirit.

Temo hears the sound of distant footsteps like they're in a hurry, getting closer. He shouts "More coming, think we might want to find another room to dance in!" - but Nethza runs in further, closer to Riglan, the runs in a full-on attack against the hexed Ignatia, attacking twice with the longsword. She's right up in the face of the other wizard and next to the Chimera, but it's a calculated risk; both attacks hit, for 15 and 10 damage; she adds in psychic blast too (which catches the adjacent mage too). Unfortunately she does in turn take some damage from Ignatia's wreathing fire-shield, but has some resistance; 5 damage.

The chimera looks around with its various heads and goes for Nethza straight-up. The claws would hit so Temo tries to distract with Silvery Barbs - this works; he passes advantage to Maireagh as part of the spell. The lion head comes in for a bit but misses, however as Nethza dodges that, the goat head's horn connect, dealing 14 damage (but Nethza holds the hex). In addition, it looks around and turns its dragon head towards Riglan... Oh bugger. It breathes fire. Riglan doesn't even come close to dodging (Dex DC15 with a +0 modifier, rolls nat 5), taking full damage - 7d8 - but it's a crazy low roll; only 15 so *very* lucky to get away that lightly.

Temo aims and fires at the chimera. He hits but another middling roll, 27.

Maireagh feels the confidence of the magical advantage conferred by Temo. She takes a step back, happy to take an opportunity attack; Ignatia takes it, but misses. Maireagh calls up a Branding Smite and throws her hammer. No crit, but a good hit; 19 damage plus 6 from another arcane jolt, then a second attack. This hits too; 20 damage; **Ignatia falls**.

The mage retaliates immediately, creating a wall of fire - everyone is caught in it except Temo over in the far corner of the room; to include Riglan, she even clips the chimera with it. This time Riglan dodges some of the damage, as do Maireagh and the dog; even Nethza manages. The 5d8 damage is 25, but halves to 12 (or 6 for Nethza & Maireagh). Unfortunately the chimera dodges too, but takes some of the damage all the same - in fact it looks as hurt as Riglan and the dog - no fire resistance maybe? The wall of fire shoots flames through about 10ft in our direction. Riglan realises with shock that the guy who was being questioned, tied to the table, must surely have perished in the conflagration.

Bursting through the door, one of the full plate, burning-heart guards walks in, apparently immune to the damage. He looks around and sees Temo; attacks 3 times with a spear, hitting twice; Temo tries Silvery Barbs, but it still hits; he tries to give himself attack advantage for when he responds. 9 and 7 damage, respectively.

Riglan casts Dispel Magic, not knowing the level so L5 - highest he can do. The wall collapses, to his relief. He stays in his corner of the room, trying to keep the party separated.

Another guard of the same kind runs in to try and tackle Maireagh; the third attack does hit, dealing 5 damage.

Nethza transfers her hex to the mage. She then studies her carefully and decides to attack, but takes a chance, using the Green Flame on her longsword. Luckily, she just manages to hit - the mage almost dodges, but can't quite move quickly enough, dealing 12 damage with the hex included. The green flame works well with maximum damage 1d8 -> 8 additional fire damage to the mage and the nearby Chimera takes 8+5. Nethza sees the fire working and shouts to let the party know - "These two don't have any protection against fire!"

The chimera attacks Nethza again. The bit misses but the horns once again hit; the claws do too, this time, with Temo busy with the new arrival guard and unable to distract. 14 + 8 damage. Her hex almost falters, but Maireagh shouts "Focus! Focus, we're nearly there!" (Flash Of Genius) and the spell is held. Riglan braces himself for more bad breath, but the chimera appears unable to do it.

Temo disengages, runs closer and fires at the chimera with his own magical advantage. He hits, but the damage is only 22 total (from 6d6+6 - so the upper end of half max).

Maireagh attacks the other new guard next to her, hitting twice; she can't throw the hammer though; she does 12 + 12 damage. It seems to do very little damage, surprisingly, though; the dog tries to attack but it misses.

The mage throws a fireball in the middle of the room, hitting *everyone*, even the chimera. Temo easily saves, so avoids any damage; Riglan only gets 11, but Maireagh shouts "Just put your shield up!" and he manages to avoid some of it. In so doing, she doesn't manage to dodge but the dog does. Nethza dodges too; the chimera critically fails. It is *not* expecting friendly fire.

We don't know it, but this a L5 fireball - 10d6. Potential damage is 35, which could be worse; so 17 to just about everyone, but only 8 to Nethza. The two plate guards are of course totally immune and unaffected. The one that had tried to attack Temo before runs out and tries again. Temo is squirming a lot; only one attack lands. 10 damage. He doesn't try to dodge but shouts "Riglan, we're getting a bit beaten up here..."

Riglan says, "...I know!" and just for fun, throws a poison spray at the chimera which succeeds but only for 11 damage. Riglan shouts to the chimera, "They aren't your friends, they're not on your side, they're hurting you and we're only defending ourselves - stop attacking us and we will stop attacking you". He's hoping it's a beast, but he sees no sign of recognition in its eyes. He casts Healing Word at L3 on Nethza specifically, healing her for 16, plus the aura heals the entire party for 10 - except the dog, unfortunately, which doesn't benefit from the healing.

The other razorblast guard attacks Maireagh, hitting twice; 20 damage total.

Nethza is getting increasingly unhappy with what's going on with the mage. She attacks with the longsword; crit success! 2d6 + 2d8 + 6 -> 27, good rolls. The mage falls - as it goes down, Nethza pulls the out her soul as a spectre. Nethza now turns to the chimera; "You need to be released from the bonds of this servitude!" - she swings once more and hits for 17. The chimera dies.

The spectre is sent over to the guard near Temo, flanking it; it hits, dealing 10 damage.

Temo was going to try disengage and run through to keep using the bow, but the spectre's flanking gives him another idea and he drops his bow on the floor (gently!), pulling the shortsword. Despite flanking, unfortunately he's a bit rusty and misses. The guard laughs - but Temo draws his dagger with his other hand and hits, crit! 2d4 + 10d6... 38 total. He shouts out, "Don't forget they kind of explode!" Meanwhile, Maireagh attacks the guard on her, missing the first time badly and just hitting the second time for 11 damage. Another arcane jolt adds 5 more. The dog flanks and tries its luck, hitting but only for 5 damage (d8 rolled 1).

The guard in front of Temo retaliates, but amazingly all three attacks miss (14, 13, 12!). Riglan comes up behind Temo and throws a poison spray over his head at the guard; however, it seems unaffected. He then casts another healing spell, this time aimed at Maireagh, L3 again, only 12 this time, but again everyone in the party gets 10 more on top of that.

Maireagh's aggressor now attacks her once more. It misses all three too, surprisingly, albeit only just on the last attack.

Nethza turns and Hexblade's Curses the guard on Temo; she throws Eldritch Blasts, crits on a 19 as a result, low damage rolls sadly, but even so, 28 damage. The second blast unfortunately misses. The guard is looking very rough. Temo once again shouts the warning about trying to keep clear of them when they go down. The spectre hits thanks to its flanking advantage, dealing 8 more damage.

Temo disengages and runs back, sheathing his sword as goes, then throws is dagger. He hits easily and manages to do 24 damage, but the razorblast still clings on. Maireagh continues her attack, now aided by the flanking of the dog. She is angry - L3 branding smite - hits, total 25 damage; another arcane jolt, for 10 more; she attacks once more, hitting for 12 more.

The more injured razorblast is very frustrated, spins around and attacks the spectre (which on both attacks had done its con-save-fail thing and lowered the total hit points both times). The non-magical damage has less effect than the guard probably wanted - one of two attacks do hit, but only for 3 damage; seeing this, it spins and throws the spear at Temo (disadvantaged by the nearby spectre); it hits Temo for 10 damage.

Riglan tries the same thing again. Poison spray. He saves again! Healing for Maireagh again; L2 Healing Word, but does well with the roll for 15 healing - everyone gets another 10 too. Riglan and Temo end up at exactly full normal health.

Maireagh almost gets hit by the guard, throws up a shield; second would crit hit and Temo spots this so distracts with Silvery Barbs; the last hits too, Temo can't help, but only 5 damage total. Nethza gains the attack advantage from the spell. She throws an eldritch blasts at the guard; 35 total damage due to one crit despite one miss. The guard falls - and the heart explodes. The radius is bigger than expected; the blast even hits the other guard. The spectre dodges some, the dog too, Temo avoids any damage and this time even Riglan manages to get clear. Good thing too, since it's 6d6 piercing; 21 rolled, halved to 10, but this damage actually kills the other guard, so now the dog, Maireagh and spectre are in range. Everyone succeeds except the dog. 21 damage again; so the dog takes 31 in total. Wow. Nearly destroyed. Everyone else takes 10 from one or two blasts, the spectre taking half of that in both cases.

Ouch. What an end!

Temo says - "Told you so."

### (2850 XP)

Temo tries to investigate but gets nowhere until Riglan helps (investigation 3+11, then with advantage, 19+11). In foot lockers, he finds some general cult clothing, Maireagh is annoyed to find out that the ale in the cask is sour, but there are about 65gp worth of general tradable gems or currency. In Ignatia's room there is an urn, which catches his eye; he suspects something is in there and indeed, under the ashes, finds a collection of **gem stones worth about 800gp** - in directly tradable sizes.

There are several books on the shelves, including a spell book; it's written in Arcane, but with notes written in Gnomish. Temo also finds a spell scroll and potion of healing, which we guess she never had a chance to reach for. He can't figure out the scroll (7+3) but Riglan looks over and realises he knows the spell; it's Wall Of Fire itself. Riglan says he could use it, not that it'll be much use against this group! It requires concentration though, so Riglan figures it might be worth letting Temo hold onto it for now.

We decide to hold up here for a while and short-rest, but someone needs to keep watch. Temo is in pretty good health thanks to the Unicorn totem, so he does that while the rest of the party rests. During this time, Maireagh mends the dog.

Riglan still has about half an hour left with the spider, so he sends it down the stairs that we haven't yet investigated. It's a really large room, perhaps once even an assembly ground. The ceilings are high. There are runic carvings and mosaics on the walls, which look to Riglan like they may be of interest to Maireagh. There are alcoves throughout the room and an exit East through a 10x10ft square corridor. It's empty though, so we venture out and head down into the room.

(Riglan: Perception 24 total, Temo: 19 total). A square-ish room but with two wide alcoves to the East and West; vaulted ceiling. The air quality here is very different. Smoke lingers. There's a smell of sulphur, especially in the Western alcove. The alcove on the East are almost terraced on the East, as if people could've sat on them; but the one on the West is full of bones, a musky smell - this is like a creature's lair. There are scorch and burn marks, holes gored into the wall as if by horns; claws along the stonework - adds up to a chimera. Looking closer at the East alcoves we see remains of seating in places. This was a parade area, perhaps; seating for dignitaries. A receiving ground, Maireagh deduces; she points to the exit tunnel and expects to find steps along it. Indeed, about 30ft along, there are steps heading up. Maireagh believes this would lead to the grand hall of the fort at the entry of Tyar Besil. In short, it would in theory lead us back to what had become the earth cult temple.

Temo sees a glitter of something in the makeshift lair. Investigation, 9+11. Broken bones, scraps of armour and clothing - grisly - he finds a tiny red silk pouch, with very fine magical sand. Maireagh identifies as Dust Of Disappearance. There's a Potion Of Diminution too. We're not sure if we'll ever use that, but we think it might be of interest at Wallheim's if all else fails. There's also apparently a bit of a collection of moonstones, for which this particular chimera must have had a fondness; no less 16 of them. Quite the haul. We realise this could be a safe bolthole, but Riglan and Maireagh have to go get the chimera body and tidy up some of the other mess else people will come looking. Ath. Riglan: Nat 1! + 7. It takes a good half hour to get the creature down. After that, not too hard to clean up everything else.

Riglan leaves one moonstone at the creature's side, below one of its front clawed feet.

The spectre, we learn, is indeed the Lizzy we heard called for. We ask who are the people of note, the people who are powerful here. "Well, for one, clearly myself! I have largely the area to the West. This area here is Ignatia's; it was her job really to tend to the chimera and guard against incursions from the earth cult. *My* task to the West was to guard against incursions from the air cult; the Howling Hatred. The Supplicant's Rooms were in that direction. Generally speaking, we left each other well alone! She had dominion of everything to the East of the fire temple; I had everything to the West. We had an uneasy truce. She was treacherous; she would probably have betrayed me if our plans had come to fruition; we were both interested in assassinating Bastian. Seems that you do not know who that is? Bastian is Vanifer's second in command. He rules everything to the north of the cavern, after the lava falls. He is responsible for the forge and guarding the entrance from above."

We ask about slaves and prisoners being brought to Scarlet Moon Hall. "Slaves? We don't need slaves; we have the ability to command the strength and labour of Elementals." She mentions that on her side, past "the mechanism room, down near the well", leading to the fire temple itself - "we always keep an eye on that stone bridge hovering over the chasm, over the lava flow leading to where Bastian has his forces. You would do well to watch your back there; you might have control over this portion of the temple, but you don't control the fire temple itself, nor the Supplicant's Quarters, nor Bastian's barracks."

We ask what defence strength is down there; she says she has many cultists and priests; it's the centre of worship. Obviously, priests mean magic and cultists driven by strong beliefs.

Even so, time is pressing. The spectre reminds us that Vanifer hasn't been on this level for days. We need to clear the area as quickly as we can and move on if Teresiel or any slaves are not here.

We have a conversation weighing things up:

* Maireagh thinks we should clear it all and get it into e.g. Dwarven ownership again
* Nethza is interested in freeing slaves and prisoners
* Riglan is again torn by the delegation's fate and protecting the world above
* Temo is focused on the world above and neutralising the cultist threat

Maireagh suggests that if it's not our job to fully vanquish all cults, just the threat of the Eye, then perhaps we should press on and get to the surface, then call the druids for more help. The spectre tells us that the lava tubes from here to Scarlet Moon Hall are clear and it'd take about half an hour to get to the basement there. We'd have to get through Bastion to do it, though. If we want to vanquish the Eye, we know that we need to destroy the weapons held by Vanifer and Unrayle.

To find out about Teresiel, **Riglan elects to try divination** - he performs his ritual and, when the time is right, asks: "Where is Teresiel being held captive?". Smoke forms. It clings to walls. Lizards, worms, spiders, bugs, bats... All those shapes form. Riglan realises that these are the creatures which may be helping look. Each in turn seems to spend about half a minute with its eyes open. Eventually the vision shifts

* A deep cavern which gives the impression of being 100ft high, base filled with lava; a statue rising in the middle with a narrow stone walkway leading out almost, but not quite, reaching the statue; the statue is a humanoid with its head turned up, mouth open in pain, hands up to its face, carved out of some kind of hardy stone; lava pours out of the eyes and mouth and back down into the pool far below.
* A well-dressed woman in a robe that seems to be dragon sales, hood down, horns curved back; a tiefling. Beside her, priests seem to be beckoning and giving orders for some kind of preparation being made around the area. The lava seems to coalesce into a strange unnatural shape; meanwhile, circling around is a young red dragon, which lands atop the colossus statue.
* The vision pulls back away to a small room a few caverns away. Some people are huddled together, chained, watched by hellhounds. The familiar moon elf Teresiel is in the middle, pushed forward, trying to push the captives back, as if to protect them from the hounds.

We all see this. Riglan turns to Nethza unsure if she understood; "did you see that OK?" - she did. So we want to:

* Get down to Vanifer evidently quite urgently, but knowing that there is a very strong force down there, not least of which is a dragon.
* Call for help, to suppress additional cultist activity down here. That needs us to go up.
* Bastian is in the way. We certainly can't tackle the fire node today; too many spells blown; so we're going to try and risk getting through Bastion and up in order to signal the druids on what we have left.

We aren't in amazing shape, noting that Maireagh in particular has few of her useful tricks left (e.g. flash of genius or arcane jolt), but we're alright if marginal on spells and time is pressing. We agree that it's a risk, but we're just going to have to try it. We will forego investigating the temple area with its priests and so-forth.

We consider going through the forge again to reach Bastian but there's also the lava bridge. We ask the spectre; the bridge is the most direct way; the forge would require us to go through hobgoblin barracks. We'll probably end up fighting them anyway but at least not straight away. So, scary bridge it is.

Temo sneaks ahead to make sure the coast is clear at each turn. Stealth: 17+13! He gets past the hellhound room. Just before the stars, he sees the door marked **"Machinery Room - Lava Control"**. He comes back and asks the spectre if there's any mischief we can get up to in the machinery room. Spectre doesn't know. We decide to sneak inside.

Gears - machinery, leavers, stone and metal. Maireagh's wheelhouse. There are long viewing tubes looking to the left and forward. Forward is a lava pool with channels cut, dropping into a reservoir leading to the four channels that spout out into the forge. On the left is a wide channel of lava coming down with a complicated series of stone walls that can be raised or lowered, coated in some strange dark metal which Maireagh thinks is probably Dark Steel or Adamantium, since it doesn't melt. We'd need to figure out which levers do what to divert the lava away from the forge without overflowing things.

Maireagh and Temo have a try at figuring it out, but both of them roll at nat 2! No progress. They're trying not to touch anything; Riglan suggests risking it and getting hands-on. Three levers can be pulled. Two are facing one way, one faces the other. We try moving that third lever. Riglan and Nethza watch from the viewing tubes. A huge wall lowers down, cutting off the inflow into the pool. We undo that action. We try the leftmost of the two levers not yet touched. In the distance, furthest away, a wall starts to rise into view. We wait to see what happens; the flow into the reservoir is decreased. We're not too sure what that did and reverse the action. The distant wall lowers again. The flow into the reservoir increases again. We try the final lever. This time we just hear noise; nothing visual changes; it has the same effect on the influx and the reservoir levels. Temo intelligence check nat 4, so no progress. We try moving the previous lever that made the wall raise; we pull that one too; the distant wall rises. The "river" flow to the reservoir now slows right down to a slow trickle. The level starts to drop quite quickly, then stabilises with four tubes visible that presumably lead to the forge output.

We make a mental note of how things were and leave it like this for now. We exit the room and continue along the corridor, up some stairs; a cross-junction, stairs carrying on ahead but down; to the left, we're told by the spectre - the Supplicant's room and then temple; to the right, a huge cavern and bridge. Temo creeps ahead to scope out the bridge and see if he can see any creatures or enemies. It's directly above the lava reservoir. Brightly lit. Temo: Perception 18+3. He does not see any obvious monsters, gargoyles, guards etc.; the bridge is about 120ft long and 10ft wide. Temo comes back and we rope up with the rope-of-mending just in case, except for Nethza who holds the rope and activates her flying cloak.. 10-20ft between each, and we'll go in single file - Temo, Maireagh, dog, Riglan, Nethza. We start across, about 10ft between us

Temo: Perception total 19. Near the end of the bridge, Temo can see several people standing in the room in front. He unties the rope and signals frantically to the others that they need to hurry across and get engaged in battle ASAP!

Initiative:

* Temo 24
* Maireagh 23
* Bears (see below) 11
* Riglan 9 :-/
* Nethza 8
* Spectre 6

Temo he casts Nathair's Mischief at maximum range; D4 -> 1 -> Apple pie smell; he runs up into the room to try and cause a further distraction. He dashes into the back of the room near a bookcase and shouts, "Hey, ugly people!"

Maireagh unties both herself and the dog, then runs forward; the dog follows. She reaches the end of the bridge, not quite into the room. Riglan is now tied to a rope with nobody else on it and Nethza holding the other end. Awkward.

In the room, one of the people turns around and shouts, "Intruders!" and runs across the room away from us, throwing a door open at the far end, shouting, "Bastian! The bridge! People are crossing the bridge! It's the ones Vanifer warned about! The temple must have fallen!"

Another turns and runs into another door, closer to Temo. "Get out here! Get out here and defend us!" - he turns and lights his flaming sword, then runs up to the dog.

Riglan shouts "Nethza, drop the rope!", runs up and casts L3 Conjure Animals; 4 medium size black bears appear, towards the edge of the spell range in the room; a worry, as they're not hardy at all; so he drops in the bear totem too. Everyone except the distant Nethza benefit.

Nethza now flies up and gets quite close to Maireagh. The spectre flies into the room through the rock.

On the enemy turn for charmed people: Temo thinks that maybe some of the enemies may be charmed, so he suggests that perhaps they "Don't you think we're better looking that Bastian? You should defend us instead!" - adv. persuasion, 25 - they don't draw weapons and look confused!

The spectre flies up to the nearer door that someone was shouting into.

Temo sees that Riglan's creatures have appeared in his spell range and there's nothing he can do to avoid any of them, so he's forced to drop the spell immediately. He aims and fires at the guard shouting for Bastian. He gets a good hit and excellent damage roll, 36. The guard falls to one knee, badly injured, dropping his sword from the surprise and sudden injury.

Maireagh runs around the nearby guard and bolstered by the bear totem tries to shove him off the edge of the bridge - and succeeds. Grisly! Maireagh... Goodness. The guard is gone. With her second attack, she throws her hammer at another guard and hits for 17 damage. The dog has a go too, using the bear for flanking; it hits for an additional 7 damage.

Bursting from the far door is a Fire Genasi, fully aflame. Bastian, we presume. It surveys the room and throws a fireball into the middle of the melee with all the bears, two guards, Maireagh and the dog... 8d6 -> 25. Bears 1 & 2 avoid the worst of it (12 damage, further away) but 3 & 4 take the full brunt. The dog takes full force too; Maireagh at least avoids the worst and with resistance only takes 6. Of the two guards, with fire resistance; one fails its save, so takes 12; one succeeds, taking 6.

Bastian shouts, "I recognise *you* - yes, *I* shall be the one to claim your heads and *I* shall claim Tinder for myself!"

Next, coming out of the *other* door but inadvertently getting swiped at by the spectre in passing - which hits for 13 - is a priest. It sees Temo and Nethza and casts Scorching Ray, two at each of us; Nethza is hit by one, taking 9->4 damage; Temo dodges both! Then to our surprise *another priest emerges*, runs out and throws another fireball, this time aiming for Nethza. He doesn't see Riglan but Riglan is caught, along with Maireagh; 8d6 -> 26, Riglan avoids the worst taking 13 damage and holding his spell; Nethza was busy dodging scorching rays and gets surprised by the fireball, also taking 13 (thanks to fire resistance); she holds her hex. Maireagh manages to use a moment of genius to avoid the blast and so takes 6.

The flame guardian that Temo hit, now stood next to Bastian, runs to a nearby bear (no.1) and attacks with flanking advantage, crit and miss - 18 damage total, leaving it with only 10 hit points left. The bear retaliates, but misses twice - even a 16 doesn't hit the guard. Bear 2 runs up to Bastian and tries its luck! Misses badly both times. Bear 3 tries to attack a guard it flanks; hitting both times for 7 and 6 damage respectively. Finally, bear 4 flanks a guard with the dog; it only gets 3 damage from its bite, but its claws strike perfectly (nat 20) for 13 damage. It runs back to confront one of the two priests/mages.

Riglan sees a chance - he turns into a giant eagle, flies up to Bastian and lands right beside him, next to the door. Nethza follows suit to a degree, flying into the room and transferring her hex to the first of the two priests that emerged. She throws Eldritch Blast. She hits twice, for 20 (of 21 max!) and 16 - the priest is still up, but only just.

The guardian currently flanked by two bears attacks each once. It misses bear 3 and crits for bear 1 for 18 damage - bear 1 goes, having suffered, now, two critical hits. The other one, now faced with a giant eagle next to it, attacks; it hits once, but badly, only doing 6 damage (eagle: 19 left). Riglan has to blow a charge of his cloak for that! Doh.

The spectre tries to take down the first priest, since it's so injured (even though it could have flanking advantage for the priest adjacent). It does manage to hit and with 11 damage it takes the priest down. Now the spectre moves to flank the priest against the bear.

Temo runs up to try and hit Bastian, but annoyingly misses. Waste of a turn. Could've (should've) aimed at the priest. He retreats (but can't hide - bonus action used to dash) behind a table, cursing.

Maireagh throws her hammer at the remaining priest, hitting twice - 13, 18 damage. She gets the dog to run up and try an attack too; happily it hits for a solid 11 damage.

Now Bastian acts. A 60ft wall of fire starts to cut directly through the giant eagle and spectre, trying to burn everything deeper into the room, but Nethza is just in range and is able to use Counterspell - it fizzles out. The eagle's feathers are only mildly singed! Now Bastian pulls his dagger and sets it on fire.

The remaining priest throws a fireball (29 max damage) - it gets everyone, except the spectre, bears 2 or 4. Bear 3 fails to save, Riglan manages it (14 - eagle only has 5 left) but holds his spell this time; Temo avoids any damage; guardian B fails, 14 damage; guardian A saves, 7 damage; Maireagh fails, the dog fails too. Maireagh uses her last flash of genius to save the dog, shouting an instruction to it at the last minute. She takes 14 damage via resistance; the dog takes 14 too, via *just* making its safe.

Bear 2 positions to flank Bastian with the giant eagle and attacks twice. It manages to just hit, twice, for 7 and 7 damage. Bear 4 flanking the mage attacks. It hits twice, for 5 - almost taking it down - then max damage with the claws, 10. The mage falls. The bear runs up to the remaining guard.

Riglan attacks Bastian, now flanked by his bear. He attacks Bastion and does hit, just for 6 damage with the beak; then again, for 13 with the claws. Bastian then flares up - "How dare you!" - in a hellish rebuke; dex save only 10+3, 3d10 fire damage -> 18 fire damage. The eagle vanishes and 13 points carry over. Riglan reverts to himself but holds the bears. He misty steps away, trying to draw fire further from everyone else.

Nethza flies up, gets within sight line of Bastian, lands, transfers her hex; she'd seen the Hellish Rebuke hurt Riglan - the rash, over-confident Bastian has used his reaction; she casts Psychic Lance with her last spell; potential 34 psychic damage. Bastian can't counterspell and fails to save; he takes the whole amount. She's been very, very useful with that spell!

Guardian A runs towards Nethza; bear 4 tries an opp attack but misses. The guard swipes twice, but just misses Nethza both times as she dodges his attempts. Guardian B moves up and tries the same thing, but also misses twice.

The spectre of Lizzy floats over to Bastian, flanking with the bear; it just gets a hit - 11 damage. This turns out to be *exactly* what Bastian had left. Lizzy's moment. "You! You LIED to get favour. Let's see you get out of this one, you deceptive fool - I'll take you to hell with me!"

Temo disengages from Guardian A, then tries his Magic Missile wand. Perception: 20 - he only needs 1 missile for Guardian A - he sends 1 missiles to the most injured (A) and 4 to the other (B), blowing 3 charges in total. He only gets 2 damage to guardian A, but that's enough; a high damage of 18 to guardian B, who also falls. Two for one.

It's over.

Riglan goes over to the Lizzy spectre. "Revenge isn't a good trait, but it certainly *feels* good". We start to investigate, led as usual by Temo: Investigation 25 total.

* We find Bastian's journal - there are some notes; a ledger of much he has to pay the hobgoblin mercenaries every week, who are in barracks, tasked with protecting Scarlet Moon Hall. 180gp a week to keep **one hundred** of them employed. The chief is apparently called Aloysius! Looking at the last few entries, Temo spots one that says - "Drat! I must have misplaced it. Where has my good luck stone gone?!"
* In the priest's room, 2 potions - one of Greater Healing (for Nethza) the other of Fire Breath (Riglan, since Temo has one and Netzha & Maireagh don't think they'd need it).
* Within the priest's quarters also - hidden under a bed is a small pouch containing 20 pieces of red quartz, which Maireagh estimates are worth maybe 10gp each - generally tradable as currency. Looking closer, Temo notices (arcana 12+3) magic on one of them so he hands that to Maireagh to investigate.

After a few minutes Maireagh identifies the unusual quartz piece as being a form of Stone Of Good Luck - Bastian's, we assume. Requires attunement; +1 to all ability checks and saving throws, including Initiative.

Temo discovers a secret door in Bastian's room; it opens to the lava tubes. We now have a route to the surface. Riglan now looking at the journal notes that this lets Bastian sneak up and down without Hobgoblin oversight, as he tries to amass his power base - he has dreams too - the eye calls out to him and he thinks Tinder Strike is rightfully his, not Vanifer's. She is a "vain and infernal impostor who has tricked her way into power".

Riglan asks the spectre if the hobgoblin chief is down here. Yep! In the barracks. We think Nethza's variety of persuasion is needed. She drags his whole body (!) to the barracks, asking for the bag of red quartz - 190gp - and Riglan throws in the moonstones too. It's only money.

We get to the nearby barracks. She holds up a hand and commands, "Stop!" as the hobgoblins start to approach - Temo uses some illusions of "fire and power" - "I want to speak to Aloysius". Lizzy points out where Aloysius is sat at a nearby table. Aloysius stands. "I am Aloysius. Who are you and why shouldn't we kill you? You've killed the person who pays our wages!" Nethza says, "Yes, so no more money" - she empties the bag of red quartz - "That is yours. More than a week's pay, to cover your next week. Consider it a holiday. You can head home victorious. You are released from your employment. There is nothing left to protect here. We have killed everyone". Intimidation: total 21. The hobgoblins exchange glances. Aloysius insight: 15. He believes her - certainly the spectre of Lizzy must help! - "All right. I will take everyone with me. May we leave at once?" "I would prefer that you do. Gather your kin. Head home. Buy something good to drink, some food, look after your women folk." - Aloysius picks up the bag of quartz; they gather their belongings and weapons; and leave. We see maybe 20 or more hobgoblins just here - good thing we didn't fight them! - they head up to Scarlet Moon Hall.

We follow behind. Nethza questions Aloysius - why were they here? Bastian hired them. There were about 10 prisoners taken from Red Larch; they were taken down below, but they don't know where they went. The hobgoblins don't descend that far. About half an hour later, we're at the Hall. Aloysius orders the lieutenants to pack up. With so many up here, the fire cult didn't keep more guards - around 70 or more were camping out! As they are packing, Aloysius looks to Nethza. "Do you have any objections to us taking things that are unsecured in the keep?" "Help yourself!"

It seems to be mid-afternoon. We see the awesome sight of around 100 hobgoblins matching west, towards their tribal lands.

So, we're up here in an unoccupied relatively safe keep with much of below cleared. Riglan climbs to the top of the keep. The view is amazing. He pulls out his scroll that he's had all this time. **He reads the specially prepared Sky Write spell.**

Druid ruins form in the sky, visible for miles aware. Perception: 17+9. Odd shaped clouds appear in the distance, mimicking the runes. The message is being passed by members of the informal circle we formed all those weeks ago is passed far and wide.

Nethza is next to him. "I guess now we wait? Shall we set up camp? Outside?"

Riglan checks the weather with Druidcraft. His staff changes shape and Ilpharn says, "Clear skies. A little chilly overnight." - Riglan says, "After all that fire - sounds perfect!" Nethza says, "Outside it is!"

We head down to the familiar hillside and set up camp outside, for the first time in a long time. "It's good to not be in tunnels", notes Nethza. Maireagh says, "You know what? This is fine, I guess. Absolutely fine." She starts to produce cooking utensils. We find some cured meat in the bag. Riglan forages for some mushrooms and carrots; even finds a few bulbs, some fruit too. We pull out some Dwarven ale - Maireagh insists after the sour ale down below! - and have drink our fill.

We drink a small celebration - at least for a short while, the entire city of Tyar Besil is for once free of cult leadership influence. Down below, very different... The spectre says, "Well, my priests are still..." - Maireagh interrupts - "quiet! The city is free".

Riglan comes up to the spectre. "In the morning, at sunrise, you shall be free and get to appeal to be let to a divine realm or a cursed one. You were perhaps an unwilling aide to us, but you did still help and you did dispatch Bastian..." - the spectre looks over Temo's shoulder to Bastian's journal. She'd had the same dreams. The realisation is setting in that they were all tricked equally by the eye; set upon one another - survival of the fittest; the eye wanted the victors only; she confesses as much. Riglan says, "...yes, well, I hope you fare well in the afterlife."

Temo and Riglan spend time reading. Maireagh has lots of ideas for crafting and infusions. Nethza talks to Lizzy. Riglan gets nowhere (nat 2!) but Temo does well (reading double-speed thanks to the other spell book - nat 20 and dirty 15, 3 successes equivalent).

Watch order - perception with advantage thanks to dog:

* Maireagh - total 17 
* Nethza - total 19
* Temo - 3,20 -> 23 (!)

As Temo is finishing his watch, he sees movement near the tree line. Initially he is alarmed, but then four gentle glowing lights appear and start to circle around an emerging half-orc with a bow, holding both hands aloft to show he is alarmed. Temo relaxes, recognising **Gaporska** from shadowtop - he sends the four lights into the sky and four giant eagles appear. They land and transform into Varigo, Mahoon, Iniri and Fariya, our friends from our first encounter here at Scarlet Moon Hall. Temo grins and hurriedly wakes Riglan, then heads to bed!

Riglan warmly greets his friends. They are glad to see him but concerned by the symbol. "It has been half a season - what has happened? We have come full circle and you have managed to keep this place clear?" Riglan chuckles and says, "no, actually, far more involved than that but the same outcome..." - and processed to quietly explain the situation, heading away from camp to avoid waking everyone; Gaporska says he'll keep an eye on the camp, so the rest of us head to the trees. Riglan sees Gaporska call on a fey companion panther. It curls up next to Gaporska, regarding the dog with a quizzical expression; the dog regards the panther equally.

Riglan: Perception 3+9. He does not notice until he feels a tug on both ears - then they are pulled back and tied together! - two giggling sprites pop up on either side. "Flix! That's so rude! No!" says a voice as Gariena comes up and helps untie his ears. Riglan laughs, it's fine; he's actually never had his ears tied before. She asks how he is; he says tired, but happy, there is progress, people we thought were lost may be actually rescuable, there is hope but much trial.

So now, Riglan gets into more of the full story, but focusing on the elemental evil threat, the nodes below - especially the two remaining weapons - pointing out that what we need is to secure the temples and the Fane above, so that we don't get a resurgence of the cult and have some protection from people above. We get into details about the creatures there that we think are live & let live (e.g. the etins).

We start to head back to the camp. Silhouetted against the hill line are 3 large stags with grand antlers. As we approach they trot down and change to the familiar small, stocky shapes of Comnall, Murcadh and Ragnad, again from the encampment that first night we came here. Hello! "We came as soon as we saw..." - Riglan realises he might be repeating this story often, but bit by bit everyone is up to speed. The sun starts to rise over the forest, striking the keep quite early; the rest of the camp wakes and at this moment, a halfling and human woman approach on pony and horseback via the road, riding up. It's Flameran and Dreena, from the Delmond ranch battle. Riglan greets them, says hello the horse and pony too - he recognises the draft horse, as it's the one we'd "loaned" that they'd used for their escape to the High Forest. It's good to see the horse safe.

A breakfast feast is soon rustled up.

Plans are considered. Gaporska, Dreena and Flameran will head to Beliard to try and assist with the giant and cult problem there. Varigo, Mahoon, Iniri and Fariya say they could guard here, or perhaps go to Red Larch to help. We suggest Red Larch, but if all is done there, to come back and guard as suggested. Gariena and the sprites will will keep an eye on the valley of the wind - make sure there's no resurgence of activity and keep an eye on the manticore. She can't fight but can report and we do strongly warn her that the temple just beneath is believed to be at close to full strength. Comnall, Murcadh and Ragnad ask where they should go and we suggest the monastery. We're worried about repercussions and retaliatory attacks on Renwick - to which they react quite badly, so it takes some convincing - they should keep away from that side of the monastery and the tower, but just watch out for cultists coming up and in particular report if they see an orb of destruction coming through since we know Unrayle is building one. Riglan assures them that the lich is very powerful and would be difficult to attack, possibly impregnable in fact, and not our focus at this time. Unrayle is the immediate threat to the region.

So, we all disperse. There are big gaps in our defence and monitoring but it's the best we can do.

(End of note - Part 22 next)
