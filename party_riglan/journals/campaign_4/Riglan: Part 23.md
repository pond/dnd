# Riglan: Part 23
## DAY 109

We wake up outside Scarlet Moon Hall having destroyed the fire node the day before and rescued three prisoners, including Teresiel.

It's one of those "everyone feels not just rested, but also stronger" moment.

* Temo gets more confident in his abilities and realises that he understands Mirror Image now.
* Riglan realises he can cast more powerful spells (gets 1x L6) and thinks can help bolster everyone's resolve through a special magical feast (Heroes' Feast), an idea started with Maireagh's ability to produce food for the group; he also has some unfinished but compelling ideas about faster travel for quick getaways after yesterday's narrow escape (Wind Walk) and, remembering how Celline had rather curiously told him to pay close attention to a particular tree outside the cottage, feels as if he might be able to form a connection with it through nature somehow (Transport via Plants).
* Maireagh has figured out how to imbue objects with forms of what the rest of the party considers spells, that can be released as a certain number of bursts of energy (10 charges of the same L1 or L2 spell) before the object would need to be "rebuilt" or recharged (which can be done at a frequency no higher than once per day) - she configures her tools so that she can use See Invisibility.
* Nethza thinks she can do something quite special - cast a third spell. Arcane magic seems to flow through her more strongly this morning. She's also figured out a magical way to perhaps suggest people do things en masse, to help us avoid having to chop our way through low-level cultists (!) and thus save lives (Mass Suggestion).

Everyone discusses their new found ability and Riglan also describes his dream.

Knowing the above-ground way to the monastery is several hours, we go back down to see if we can descend the ruined shaft from fire cult forge to the fane. On the way down, Nethza uses her persuasion skills to try and convince remaining priests and cultists that Imix is truly gone - and if they had any connection with him they can surely feel the loss - in fact the priests, it transpires, have actually lost many of their powers. They were gathered at the forge when we arrived, as it happens, trying to figure out what to do.

They say they were forsaken; lied to. Riglan suggests that they head to place of calm and study. A place they can trust, where they might find a new path; Nethza suggests that perhaps Red Larch would be a good place to start - set the wrongs right there. If they are able to undo the damage, they might find friends and purpose amongst people there, with little possibility of deception or abandonment.

People disperse to pack what few belongings they have. One dispels a protective ward that was held over the side of the temple. "If you seek any answers, we've already tried looking; but perhaps it would be different for you..." - they point to a room - "Vanifer kept some things there, though she was rarely in that room, spending almost all of her time obsessing down in the fire node, in the company of her elementals and the dragon, which we think ultimately corrupted her. Perhaps this is why we failed? Either way, we were led astray from the beginning." They give the impression of having woken from a bad dream. This is part of why we feel some sympathy to their plight, for all the bad things that they have done. They were not their true selves.

After a surprisingly short time, the halls are empty. Temo investigates the indicated room. Investigation 10+11, 21 (doesn't get to use his Reliable Talent because of a D20->10, LOL). He finds a notebook hidden in an alcove above where the bed would be expected to be located (though there isn't one). The room has many riches; beautiful drawings and tapestries - but carnal! - Tiefling men and women in, umm, adult circumstances; but much of it is scorched or damaged in some way. There are various figurines too, but nothing that we think we should really worry about taking for value. In a now-familiar copper scroll case, we find two scrolls; we determine that these are Wall Of Sand and Melf's Minute Meteors.

The notebook is the focus. **It looks like a young person's diary; it is wrapped in silk but is very old and rudimentary. We'll carry this and try to remember it for a short rest.**

We head back to the forge. Maireagh's looking around, lost in thought; Riglan has some vague ideas about what she might be thinking (insight 5+5) but isn't sure, so Temo tries to strike up a conversation (persuasion 10, yes 10 again, + 12 -> 22). "This forge really is quite something else. It's crazy that they've managed to harness the power of _magma_ to power the forge. It really must have been quite a sight, back in the day. This always looked unstable, though; I think I've figured out how those levers work. If the mechanism ever failed it might have been disastrous, flooding the city with magma from the river. When they came down here, this was the foundry for armour and weapons, but I doubt this was ever meant to be permanently inhabited. The dwarves of Besilmir always intended to return to the surface - they were only ever down here for a particular reason, but what the reason is, I don't know. Maybe we never will. I wish I'd know these dwarves and what motivated them; they're so unlikely the set-in-their-way dwarves of the halls of the North. I feel like I would've liked them. They were more open-minded to other ways of living."

Riglan says, "Well, when all this is over if we're all still standing, then we've got Owlbear Tower as a base, but it's not actually all that far, especially now with some ideas I have about travelling more quickly, to get back here. We know the ways down, we know the more dangerous and less dangerous areas, and there's a lot more to study. Even in just the books that we have, there's a lot of information that we haven't studied yet. I'd be very happy to come down with you here from time to time and try to find out more about what happened - it's more insight into how larger groups of people can live - civilisations exist - in harmony (or not) with the land around them, both above and below."

Nethza comes over. "Are you guys alright?" - we say we're fine, just being introspective. We're ready to go.

Maireagh activates her boots (using one of four charges); Riglan wildshapes into a bird; Nethza casts Fly on herself, Temo and the dog (so that she isn't using her once-a-day cloak). Down we go. It's quite a short distance via flight, maybe 200ft. As we look down, we see that the lava below has settled at a high level; maybe about 100ft down below the Fane level, with a crust across the top. We suspect below maybe ropers, salamanders, fire snakes, trapped fire sculls... Who knows what, but it's stuck down there for now. We kinda hope the salamanders are OK, evil or not.

We pop out at the fane and start to make our way across to the staircase we descended from the earth cult temple. It's dark that way so Riglan casts Darkvision and Temo uses his googles. From the staircase, with the sarcophagus door to the south, we examine exits and consider which we've used. We remember the sarcophagus room's other exit and go through there. It's a dwarven hallway. Down to the South of a t-junction was the "brain cave". We haven't gone straight along it, so we that now. By the time we've wandered around checking things and getting here, the Fly spell has worn off. Riglan sees some gaps around the door, so calls his spider to crawl through and have a look. 

It's a strange room; the spider can see reasonably well, in a dim violet light that seems to emanate from strange crystals on the walls, especially from to the North of what is a long room maybe 70ft North-South and 30ft East-West. Spider: Perception 14+0. Close to the South are two very large, well, maybe beds? Bed rolls, but much bigger than Riglan would normally expect to see and filthy. There are discarded bits of food, e.g. bones with still some bits of meat attached. There are barrels with the tops taken off, with fruit or hams and other things apparently present inside, but much is scattered around.

Looking North, the spider sees that the purple crystals are clustered in a particular area on the wall that looks like it might be split, almost as if surrounding a rift and closing the gap. In fact the whole room seems split and re-joined this way, but there's also a cluster around what looks like a gaping hole, maybe a gateway. The spider detects no creatures and does not seem to be unhealthy, so Riglan suggests we go in and have a look; he activates Detect Magic before we go in.

Walking in, there's no magic. The crystals seem to be a natural occurence. Riglan, perception 10+9. Something isn't quite "right" around the crystal area... And suddenly, a mass of the crystal separates and starts to walk towards us. Some kind of earth elemental made of crystals? The crystals that were forming the gateway form into it. There are strange noises. "What? Harumph" and other confused noises - and two hill giants emerge from the gateway.

Temo (history 19+3) remembers the earth cult greeting so makes the hand symbol and says "hello, brave protectors!" Deception 19+3. The giants pause for a moment, one going "huh?!" and the other one goes, "Oh!" and smacks the first one across the head. It points at us and grunts. Riglan hears, in Giant, "Look, it's them! They! Marloss said! Them!" the other one takes a moment but then they reach for their clubs. The elemental was heading our way anyway. Riglan says, "Um, yeah, didn't work! Fight time!"

It's going to be quite tight, trying to battle two giants and an elemental in a 30x70 room.

Initiative:

* Nethza: 19
* Temo: 16
* Riglan: 11
* Maireagh: 7

Nethza moves deeper into the room,throws a Hex Blade's Curse at the elemental then casts Cone Of Cold towards all three creatures (con save DC17 / 8d8 -> 44 cold damage). Surprisingly, all three creatures fail their saves and take full damage, displaying no resistance to the cold in the process. She forward to engage the elemental in melee and try to block its advance further towards the party.

The nearby giant roars in complaint about the cold and is well within range (10ft) to swing its club. It aims for Nethza and Temo, who are closest. It hits Nethza and Temo, who was expecting to have to dodge, is actually missed; but he misses his chance to try and distract the giant's swing on Nethza, which deals 19 damage. The giant moves sideways to let its companion towards us, and in giant, shouts "Karg! Karg, squash them Karg! They is all small!" 

Temo tries to hide behind Riglan (stealth via Reliable Talent total 23). The nearby giant loses sight of him. He fires his crossbow, hitting for 35 damage (sneak is up to 6d6 now). "Argh! Little things attack Maul! Squash them!" - Temo backs into corner of the room.

The earth elemental drops down into the ground, then re-emerges on the others side of the party, emerging next to Riglan and attacking him then Nethza. Riglan is hit for 16 but Nethza dodges. Riglan in retaliation shoots his lightning wand through the elemental and to the far giant, but can't hit the nearby one since it had moved sideways. He activates his staff too. The earth elemental is hit fully for 24 damage but the giant dodges and only takes 12.

Maireagh moves away from the nearby earth elemental, which takes a swipe at her but misses; at range, she throws her hammer, hitting and critting; 15 and sadly a very low set of rolls on the crit, only 17 damage. The dog moves in where she had been and attacks the elemental, just getting in a bite for 8 more damage.

The furthest hill giant (Karg) moves forward behind the earth elemental and can't get within range of most of the party as a result, but *can* hit Nethza; the first attack is on target to hit, but Temo uses Silvery Barbs and it misses. The second attack does still hit her though, dealing 15 damage. These are all quite heavy hitting creatures - it's just blunt force. Nethza retaliates, but does not target the giants - she throws Hex onto the adjacent earth elemental as it is more threatening and with her sword swipes; another crit; 25 damage, and it crumbles to dust at the impact (Nethza is healed for 16 by this). Now she steps forward in front of the two giants, attacking Maul and hitting for 11.

Maul tries to squash Nethza! He succeeds; she is grapped and prone, taking 25 damage. She hangs onto her hex at least.

Temo can't get a good aim at the prone giant so aims and fires at Karg instead. Dodgy rolls, does scrape a hit; 27 damage. Riglan drops in the Unicorn totem but this leaves him unable to find time for a healing spell just yet; instead, he uses Blight (L4) for the first time on the prone giant, DC19; it con saves for 18, so takes a full 45 damage; it's still flopped on top of Nethza, but now is protecting her as much as squishing her! Riglan retreats to the back wall, near Temo. Maireagh runs in front of him and gets one hit with her hammer, dealing 17 damage. The dog runs up and has a go, but the giant dodges out of the way. The giant throws a rock at Riglan and Maireagh; Riglan dex save 7, but Maireagh shouts at him to dive sideways (Flash of Genius) so he just makes it; she dodges too. 3d10+5 -> 18, halving to 9.

Nethza's making muffled noises from underneath the giant and is unable to get out from underneath it. Temo isn't strong enough to help, he figures, so he just keeps throwing crossbow bolts at the remaining giant. It hits for 32 damage and this last giant falls.

Riglan and Maireagh rush over to push the giant away (Riglan: Adv. str, 10,17+3 -> 20). We pull Nethza free. She's badly injured so under the Unicorn totem Riglan casts L1 Healing Word and heals her for 21; everyone else heals for 11. Temo doubts there's much of value here but investigates anyway, Investigation 5->10 (Reliable Talent) -> 21 total. He sees that next to the bedrolls is a lot of fruit and general food, about 12 ration's worth of quite fresh food. There are lots of small bags of semi-previous tradeable stones, worth at least 830gp! There's also a mummified human head, that looks extremely old. We don't know where it's from. As respectfully as he can, Temo wraps it and puts it in his bag; we'll try to bring it to a temple or similar.

In the room, there is also a huge chequers board etched out in stone on the floor. Temo thinks that Karg and Maul might've been using the stones to play some kind of game on the board.

We figure we need a rest, and while we could use the sarcophagus room, Temo's keen on using his magical hut, so ten minutes later that's set up in a matte gray and purple colour that kind of matches the stonework and light, in the far corner of the room. While everyone else rests, Temo reads the journal from Vanifer's room. It seems to be a young girl's journal.

* The very first record is Vanifer saying, "I have a book. I stole it from the market. I found it in Sascalim." Temo, History: 18+3 - it's a slum in Calimport. "It is mine! I have a thing that is just me. I shall use it and one day will people will know the story of Vanifer, the Tiefling Orphan who became a queen."
* She records people who bully her and people who have given her shelter.
* She was brought under the wing of an elder woman who was a fire dancer, who taught her those ways. She discovered that she was naturally resistant to fire and used that to her advantage, working up from the wine sinks in the labourer's district, to elegant chambers of the city's nobles because of her beauty.
* She started to develop fire-related magical ability. She ended up with two teachers who gave her access to magic resources.
* "I have brought the eye of The Pasha. He keeps bringing me beautfiul gifts and has asked me to move to his harem in his palace. I'm worried as he is not the kindest man but this is m only way out."
* It talks about her intrigue and mistreatment from elder concubines, mistresses and wives; how The Pasha took out his frustrations on them.
* "It was a grand, glorious retribution, but I must leave" - it talks of her fleeing, taking all "his gems"; she'll be a queen finally. She talks of setting fire to the palace and he'll never hurt anyone anymore.
* Paranoia becomes evident; she keeps moving on, thinking that agents of her old master are following her.
* Entries describe her spending time in Baldur's Gate, using her wealth in the underground and opening a school of fire dance. She became a leader of her students in this school.
* She started to get visions and dreams - more paranoia - her former masters were after her; she spoke to a "great and powerful being of flame" who offered her the riches & channels to the "city of brass" (a city of Efreeti in the elemental plane of fire). She struck up a deal with an Efreeti there.
* She soon found herself being led by this Efreeti to the Sumber Hills and led on a path through the old ruins of a monastery down into an ancient temple. She discovered Tinder Strike and when she first wielded it, her mind was set ablaze - she knew the truth - she had met Imix and He would make her a queen. She could punish all those who had ever thwarted her dreams.

Temo just sits quietly with the book until people are rested, then goes up to Nethza and hands it to her. "You should read this. It's how things can go wrong. It shows the person you might have been, instead of the person you chose to be. If you still have any doubts about your true nature, deep within you, then this should leave you with none."

He turns to the party, "I know this might sound strange, but when we're done here, I want to make sure that Vanifer's name is known. Not as a bad person, but as a wronged person; of beauty and determination, a queen in the end. That's how she should be remembered."

Maireagh is sceptical. Temo just says she should read the journal some time - like the priests who fled, she was misled. And although she wasn't perhaps good at the core, she wasn't that evil either. At least, not at the start.

It seems like there's no time to waste. It's mid to late morning, we think, so we head to the strange purple room and start down. Temo leads, sending his lizard ahead as a scout.

The purple/black light crystals extrude out from the walls, sometimes apparently forcing them to split apart. Everywhere is dim light, but in a strange, shadowless violet. Things start to look (and "feel") less and less natural. The tunnel starts to twist, switching back on itself sometimes. A good half hour passes as we wander this strange path, the lizard acting as Temo's eyes and ears ahead. It is the first to emerge, with us close behind, to a rough-walled cavern with a vaulted ceiling with stalactites formed from the strange violet crystals.

Several tunnels lead from here. This node looks likely to be maze-like. Throughout the room, we see strange small stone statues; towards the West, about 80ft away, there is a passage flanked by 20ft tall stone statues. We have entered from the East so this is directly ahead. To our right are small collapsed tunnels and things, overgrown with crystals. There's no way out that way though, so forwards it is. Temo sends his lizard ahead, scuttling along the wall. We come up to the stone statues; as we approach, they animate, starting to come to life; they change into what are as sort of set of stone blocks that rotate around each other. They slam down onto the ground in front of us. Temo makes the hand symbol of the earth cult with a hopeful expression on his face - unsurprisingly to no avail. From the tunnel, we see two black earth guards running in shouting, "they're here! They're here!"

Initiative: 

* Marieagh 22
* Riglan: 16
* Temo: 15 (distracted by his lizard and attempted hand signals!)
* Vultures (see below): 11
* Nethza 6

Maireagh curses, "These things *again?!*" - earth elementals, I guess, as we've not seen this animated statue thing before? - and throws her hammer twice at the left-hand elemental, hitting twice; 16 and 15 damage. She moves forward to partly block the advance of the other one while the dog runs up to block the one she's attacked; it adopts a dodging posture. One of the two guards running in reaches the cavern, pulls a morning star and runs past the dog heading for Temo. The dog takes an opportunity attack but misses.

The elemental up to which Maireagh ran tries to slam into her, but she deflects the attack. Suddenly it disappears into the ground and pops up right next to Riglan, attacking him instead; a fairly light 11 damage. (Technically Riglan's higher dex means he should've gone first but we realised after the attack and just went with it). Riglan casts L3 Conjure and two giant vultures appear, one on each elemental; he drops in his bear totem to bolster everyone's strength.

Now the other guard runs in and manages to get right up in front of Maireagh, brandishing its Morningstar. "You will not gain entry! Ogremoch *will* be summoned! All will bow before the moving mountain!"

The Elemental attacked by Maireagh (1) swings around to attack the giant vulture once and the dog once. It hits the vulture (1) for 15 but misses the dog.

Temo disengages from the guard and runs back away, firing at Elemental (2) and hitting for 34 damage. The vulture on elemental 1 does get in one hit with pack advantage for 6 damage, but all the other vulture attacks miss. Meanwhile, Nethza hexes and throws Eldritch Blasts at elemental 2 hitting twice for a total of 33 damage. She runs up to confront the first guard and draws her sword.

We hear some strange noises and, appearing out of one of the walls, is some strange construct of rock; polyhedral aspects, with legs and arms coming out of some of the polyhedral faces and some kind of double-ring toothed mouth at the top. Riglan, perception: Dirty 20. He sees this strange creature kind of sniff the air and turn towards him, and gets a sinking feeling as it starts to move towards him. "Uuh guys, I think that new thing's after me!" he shouts.

At this, Maireagh tries to shove the guard away so she has space to throw her hammer: Athl adv. unfortunately only 14; the guard rolls 8, but uses its reaction to be unyielding so Maireagh just attacks the guard instead of trying to attack the new creature. Unfortunately, her attack deflects off his stone armour. She strafes sideways to at least get into melee range with the new arrival creature while staying in range of the guard.

The other guard attacks Nethza twice with its morning star, but both attacks miss.

Elemental 2 tries to attack Riglan. The first attack would hit but Temo distracts with Silvery Barbs and it misses. Its second attack misses too. The elemental slides into the ground; the vulture is only about 5ft up, so by the time it is out of the threatened area, it's in the ground and the vulture can't get an opp attack.

Riglan runs back to re-engage and line up the elemental and weird new creature; he drops his staff into the crook of his arm and pulls his lightning wand. It deals 28 to the elemental but the further-away weird creature sees it coming and dodges, taking 14. Riglan (arcana Nat 20 - 1) suddenly realises that he's read about this new creature; it's an elemental, a Xorn. It's native to the elemental plane of earth - they sniff out gemstones and previous metals and tunnel through earth and rock to consume treasure. They live usually in the underdark, attacking miners and treasure hunters when minerals and gems are scarce. They're unnatural in the prime material plane. Riglan shouts, "I think I know what this is - it's going to keep chasing me, trying to get to gems in the backpack!"

Guard 2 moves forward to flank the moved-to-the-side Maireagh with the Xorn. It manages to get one of its two hits despite her AC 22 armour (attack matches AC), for 6 damage. Elemental 1 meanwhile attacks the dog twice, since the dog most recently dealt damage. It hits twice, for a middling 14 and a high 19 damage.

Temo disengages, steps back and fires at the elemental (#2) that Riglan just zapped. He hits, for a solid 35 damage; the elemental shatters into dust. Temo runs in front of Riglan to face down the approaching Xorn.

Vulture A once again attacks with pack advantage. It crits and hits - 12 and 7 damage, respectively. Vulture B flies up to the Xorn. It manages to get a hit wit its beak for 6 damage but misses with the talons.

Annoyingly, even more things arrive. A small goblin - what - stone melder? - in splint armour runs, cackling, down the corridor. It crackles with magic, brandishing a black earthen rod. It says "Gorx! Gorx, you have found more treasure! Come, Keltar will feed you more treasure!" and giggles maniacally. In its other hand, it rattles a bag that sound like they're full of gems.

Nethza transfers the hex onto the guard in front of her and attacks twice - but she misses twice (17, two times over; not enough for guard's AC).

The Xorn burrows and reappears in front of Temo, teeth gnashing. It seems to be speaking, but Temo isn't wearing his helm and doesn't understand (language is Terran). Maireagh looks at the newly-arrived obvious magic user and steps forward, still in melee range of the nearby guard, casting Swordburst, hitting both the guard and the goblin. Potential damage is 10; both creatures fail to avoid anything. Once again she asks the dog to attack Elemental 1, but it misses. She moves back to try and block the way through, risking an opportunity attack from the goblin; its attack misses.

The guard near Nethza attacks her twice again and one of the attacks finds its mark, dealing her 8 damage; suddenly, the cavern walls start to tremor and small pebbles of rock and dust fall from the ceiling. Some larger parts fall onto the Xorn and Temo; he deftly dodges it (nat 20 + 9 dex save - what a thing to crit on, LOL).

Riglan stows his wand and throws a poison spray at the Xorn over Temo's head; it takes 14 poison damage, which seems to affect it in full. No resistance. Lucky. He Misty Steps away and puts as much distance between himself and the Xorn and elemental as he can.

The guard on Maireagh moves to flank her with the guard on Nethza, then attacks Maireagh; thanks to the flanking advantage it hits both times, the second one crits. Temo can't see it to help, as the Xorn is in the way. Damage is 7 and 15.

Elemental 1 moves to hit Maireagh, triggering a pack-advantage opp attack from vulture 1 (which had risen to 10ft altitude for precisely that reason), which surprisingly hits, dealing 10 damage. The elemental attacks Maireagh, the dog intervening; the second attack misses. Temo disengages from the Xorn and runs sideways, seeing elemental 2 in melee; he fires; he almost misses but a moment of luck (Luck Point spent) means it moves sideways *into* the bolt and takes 34 damage.

Vulture 1 re-engages with elemental 2 and keeps up its attack. It hits twice! 7 and 9 damage. Amazingly, the talon strike causes the elemental to crumble to dust. Riglan's shouting "goblin" so vulture 1 flies to it and vulture 2 joins in, attacking; crit! 13 damage. It even gets the talons in, dealing a further 9 to the goblin. Both remain about 5ft in the air.

The stone melder goblin responds. It casts Shatter, hitting vulture 1, the dog and Maireagh for a potential 22 damage. Vulture 1 rolls crit! Madness; so it saves, taking 11 damage. Both Maireagh and the dog dodge the worst of it too. In reaction, Maireagh *absorbs* the damage, taking only 5 damage in practice, capturing some of the remaining energy in her shield which she channels into the hammer. Nethza, seeing the guard that had moved to flank Maireagh, flanks the guard between her and Maireagh in turn, attacking with flanking advantage - though even then, she only hits once and deals 16 damage. She adds 5 using a psychic shock.

The Xorn is sniffing the air and soon gets a bearing on Riglan again. It gets within about 10ft of him. It's not a pretty sight! It opens its mouth and points inside it... Riglan realises that **perhaps it just wants feeding, like a hungry pet dog**.

Maireagh is surrounded and doesn't want that. She risks opportunity attacks from both guards and steps back; one guard gets in a hit, but before it lands she throws up a magical shield to deflect the blow. She throws her hammer at guard 2 (the one on Nethza) - crit! 6d8+8 -> 33 damage. That takes the guard down. Her second attack just gets a hit on the remaining guard, dealing 16 damage and throws in an Arcane Jolt for an extra 2d6 -> 5 damage. She gets the dog to have a go - no flanking as the vultures are flying - sadly it misses.

Riglan pulls out throws 5 bloodstones into the mouth of the Xorn. It chomps them enthusiastically and sits, speaking in some strange language. Riglan calls to Temo, "try the helm?!". Riglan walks up to the Xorn and pats it on the side, trying to make friends. It doesn't attack but still has the mouth open, scary teeth facing upward. 

The guard between the two vultures attacks the more injured vulture 1, hitting twice with one crit, producing a total of 13 damage.

Temo dons his helm and catches something from the Xorn saying basically "thanks, delicious, agree, very nice, have more?" and calls "It's asking for more food" - then not being sure which to hit, knows for a fact that stone melder is still trying to kill them so aims and fires at him. Advantage only rolls 5,2 -> 15; he misses.

Vulture 1 attacks the guard in return. It hits twice, for 7 and 7 damage; the second hit is enough and the guard falls. Vulture 2 continues on the stone melder, for 9 and would hit with the talons but it throws up a magic shield to deflect the attack. The melder seems very distressed that its Xorn pet seems to be favouring someone else, wailing and calling to it - "Gorx! No, I have food too, don't leave me!", throwing gems on the ground from its bag. It sees Riglan standing alongside and casts L3 Erupting Earth. The ground churns and shakes, Nethza included too. Riglan and Nethza are both caught out, 3d12 -> only 6 damage, luckily. Riglan holds his spell; Nethza holds hers. Surprisingly, the Xorn is affected too. Temo hears, "Keltar! Oooh. You attacked Gorx? You is not my friend!"

Nethza throws two Eldritch Blasts at the melder, hitting once for 17 damage. On its turn, the Xorn looks around and moves away, falls through the ground and springs up next to Keltar. Temo hears it say, "Why did you attack me?" and starts to gobble up the gems that were thrown on the ground. Temo calls out "It's confused about the the gnome attacking and isn't an immediate threat!"

Maireagh, hearing this but still somewhat perturbed, moves around and throws her hammer under the flying vulture 2 to hit the gnome twice, for 12 and 17 damage. The stone melder falls. As it does, its bag of gems falls out of its hands and many gems scatter onto the ground the Xorn starts munching on them. It looks at Keltar and nudges the body, seems to sniff at it, then wanders back to Riglan and sits down in front of him. Temo translates as it says, "Bloodstone very tasty. One more! One more!" - Riglan feeds it one more.

It looks at Riglan. "Who are you?" and Riglan tries to say clearly "RIGLAN". "Rig-lan?" "Yes!" "Dangerous in there. Many many things. No food left. Tunnels. Many tunnels; earth moving earth everywhere. Beware. Crystals but cannot eat. Cannot eat - crystals bad. One tunnel - South - goes very very very far, Gorx come from that tunnel. Dark elves there. Drive Gorx from living place. Is food up that way?" looking at the way we've come. Riglan asks Maireagh if she has any idea where there might be seams of minerals or gems naturally around from what she's seen? She recommends down. We know it might come into conflict with people.

Nethza offers to channel her banishing smite, but to do minimal damage. It might work. Temo tries to convey via illusions that we want to send it to a gem-filled place, but shows a blast hitting it and shouts "ow!" - intelligence-based performance -> 24. Gorx says "follow please!" and we do so. In an adjacent chamber, there are two tunnels. Gorx "this way! East! East goes many many winding place with dead old things, very very old things that died, spirit there, quite scary. Then place where making magic, Gorx not allowed. After many paths and room, land of temple. Scary earth ball. Scares Gorx. Not go. Bad human. West, this way! Danger earth river. Do not enter river. Go over. Over! Stone bridge. Go to place, many bulettes. Keltar said 'stables'. Prayer room. Faster to temple but many people and bulettes very mean."

After a pause, Gorx unexpectedly explains what happened - he was just wondering around and stumbled across Keltar, who thought Gorx was proof of him being favoured by the stone god. He fed Gorx and was nice to him so Gorx stayed. He would ask Gorx to find if anyone coming down had gems; and didn't know what happened to them, but Keltar would eventually give Gorx food. But Keltar had been getting more crazy and unstable (the effect of the elemental evils, no doubt) and even attacked him.

"Gorx goes bye now."

With that, without being sent to its plane, Gorx disappears down into the ground.

### (3200 XP)

We retreat back to the main chamber for a moment to examine what's left. Temo nat 2 -> reliable talent -> 10+11 investigation, 21. Keltar has a *folded* scroll - it's L6, Investiture of Stone. We agree that Temo could use that, despite the difficulty of casting, with Maireagh standing by with Guidance when tries to read it in case he needs some help.

We do a bit of healing; Maireagh mends the dog, though it has no temp HP left. We're in surprisingly good shape, with both vultures having healed via aura too, so rather than waste it, we consider pushing on a bit. The bulette kennels sound bad as does the bridge over the scary mud river. Twisty passages that take longer don't sound quite so bad, despite the "many old dead things" - we do have Lightbringer - but it's a tough call.

Dead old things is to the right. That's our plan. With Temo's lizard once more scouting ahead, we travel in that direction. Riglan, Temo riding on the dog, Mairaegh, Nethza and the two vultures.

The tunnel winds, turning maybe 90 degrees to the left, with tunnel widths varying from 5-15ft, so the going is slow as the vultures have to squeeze through and can't fly, then more than maybe 120 degrees back on itself - and so-on. Lots of sharp bends and changes in tunnel size. Riglan: Perception 13. There are veins of the purple crystal that seem to be forcing its way through the earth. In some cases the veins bisect the channels and in some areas it looks like they've been chipped down to provide passage through. They don't seem to be dangerous but they're certainly unusual. Temo, Arcana 13+3; he knows they're not natural but they don't seem inherently magical. They have an innate magical aspect since they're not from this plane.

In some areas there is evidence of tunnelling up into the tunnel; in other places, rockfalls have been cleared. After about 200ft, it finally starts to open up to around 15ft wide and 20ft high. Suddenly, nearby a wall kind of swells and cracks, with thick black mud oozing and running to the ground - we avoid it.

There's another tremor, that seems to move from left to right as if something's tunnelling through. Riglan: Nature 23. It does not feel like an animal or creature; it felt more like a rolling wave of tremor, a low level earthquake of sorts. A wall ahead splits open and purple crystal protrusions just push up and out. They partly block the way ahead so we'll have to smash through them.

Riglan tries with Lightbringer, but only for 5 damage. It chips the crystal but not much. He gets the feeling his staff might do more; magical damage. Switching to his staff, he activates it and this time, 9 damage. A big crack forms and a section falls. Final hit - max damage (13). The rest of the crystal blocking the way crumbles down and the way is clear.

We get to a cavern, maybe 30ft high, that looks like a forest of glowing crystals. Many slender columns make it hard to judge the cavern's true size. Crystals grow off them, almost looking like foliage. In its own way, it's quite beautiful - except the floor is littered with weapons and pieces of broken armour. Slumped against one column is a dead human male, wearing a stone breastplate with an earth cult symbol. We halt at the entrance, and Riglan squints inside to see if he can spot what might have done this. Riglan: Perception 25. There's a bit of a mist hanging in the room, which seems unnatural; it has a slight purple glow itself. He passes this information back and at that, Maireagh comes up, fiddles around and gives Riglan some strange thing to look through - he's kind of got some gel smeared on his face! - he can see invisible things with this, she says, but he sees nothing there. It's just mist, but the mist feels significant. Temo can see it is magical too. Riglan asks a vulture to come up and it knows the dangers but agrees, since worst-case it just goes back to the Fey and vulture 1 ventures inside. It walks until it has headroom, then tries to flap and get into the air. The mist doesn't react to the airflow as it does this.

Wisdom saving: nat 1! The vulture becomes very confused and flies randomly, eventually bumping into one of the stalactites. It falls down, then stands, but does nothing much; then it looks around, falls over, stands up and starts to rush at us as if about to attack. Riglan: Animal handling, 19. He realises quickly that it's not in control of its mind and by that time, the vulture hits with its beak for 6 damage. It also gets him with claws (matches AC) for 5. Suddenly (wisdom save DC 10, 10+1) it seems to snap out of it. Riglan senses its confusion and realises that the mist doesn't move, but apparently seriously confuses people!

The layer of mist seems to go from about 5ft up to 15ft up. Riglan says he'll risk trying to crawl through, because we have to go that way; but out of interest Riglan throws flame up into the mist to see if it responds at all. It just fizzles on the far wall or ceiling. The mist does not react at all.

Riglan tries crawling in. He starts to feel the effects anyway - DC10 wisdom save. 27. He's OK, but he points out to everyone that it can't be crawled underneath. It created intense confusion briefly but that dissipated. He explains that to the group. The exit is maybe 35ft North and 20ft to the west of the far wall, so it's further than can be jumped with a Misty Step. Maybe 50ft from entrance to entrance. Riglan asks Temo if he minds having his hands and feet tied, so that Riglan could carry him across and if he falls under the spell it seems that after a period you recover, since the vulture did, so we could try that. Temo agree. So he's bound up like a Christmas chicken and Riglan carries him into the room. 11-1! He starts to squirm and Riglan says "no, no, it's just confusion!" and Temo is shouting, "I'm fine!" and we get him free. The other vulture decides to risk it. Unfortunately (nat 3) it becomes confused. It walks North East towards the exit, but goes into a pillar! Then surprisingly it acts normally, rolls a 16 and recovers. OK, that's not great but it got there!

Maireagh burns for the day an activation of Resistance. She puts her hand on Nethza and says, "Neth, go for it!" Nethza enters the chamber. She's OK and gets through, but this leaves Maireagh and the dog. Maireagh helps the dog (which we house-rule must also make this safe; it does have a wisdom score etc.) - nat 20! - it's metal, but if it could look nonchalant and like, "what's the big deal?!" it would. Finally, Maireagh gets through. It's taken a few minutes, but we're through.

There are a couple of bodies here, we realise, once we are walking through; they're strangling each other. This must be some natural effect, or placed here long ago by someone else since the cultists are literally at each other's throats. Temo investigates (16+11 -> 27!). One cultist looks like a mage; there is a beautiful ring which Maireagh things was worth 165gp. In its robe is also a brass statuette of an imp with onyx eyes that Maireagh estimates are worth 180gp. This was no low-ranking priest, it was someone high up.

The tunnel forks. One left, one right. "Go right rule". We've noticed a general trend to descend in the tunnels; this particular passageway continues a bit more steeply; we think we've maybe dropped at least 40ft overall and seem to head NE for around 100ft, then loops in a big arc and then there's a very sharp corner. Temo sends the lizard ahead since we can't see inside due to the sharp bend.

Another cavern, this one kind of narrow but deep. Lizard perception: 3-1! Oh dear. It doesn't see much at all, but when Temo makes exasperated noises Riglan calls his spider back to have a look. The spider can't help either (perception 7), it just seems really messy in there, so Riglan risks it and pokes his head around the corner. Perception 12+9. **He hears bloodcurdling screams!** ...They suddenly stop. Humanoid bones litter the cavern floor. Some skeletons are intact, but ribcages have been shattered by boulders that have fallen from the ceiling. Only one remains whole. It clutches an open-faced, steel helmet decorated with a golden circlet above the brow, from which 7 gold spikes project upwards. Riglan looks back to ask if everyone heard the screams and the expression on their faces says that they certainly did. He describes what he saw and hypothesises "dead things" - presumably Gorx wasn't affected by the mist in the other cavern, having not mentioned it (perhaps he travelled through the floor or something or just was immune).

Riglan tries Detect Magic (and he can still see invisible things, and has darkvision with the purple crystal's light allowing him to see a regular distance). He walks gingerly in. He's almost *blasted* with the brightness of the light coming off the crown. It's *incredibly* magical, shining very brightly indeed. The others see his reaction and are confused; he tells Maireagh to look, she misunderstands and uses the invisibility trick, but then he explains. Intense magic. Does she recognise anything of the style of it?

She suddenly takes in a sharp breath. "No! It can't be!" - she moves forwards towards it and just barely touches it and, at this, **rising out of the skeleton is a ghost**. It is a dwarf, looks like a Duergar in fact, shouting, "THIEVES! No! Even in death. The dwarves of Besilmir guard their fabled treasure! You'll never leave with it!" - **and four spectres appear,** lunging for us. Interestingly, the ghost reels back, pulling away from them. The spectres are clearly the spectres of Drow, not Dwarves; Riglan shouts, "target the spectres but protect the ghost!".

Initiative:

* Riglan: 23
* Temo: 18
* Vultures: 14 (immediately taking flight)
* Nethza: 10
* Maireagh: 4

Riglan tries to throw a javelin but misses; he knows he needs to avoid the life draining impacts and backs away hurriedly shouting, "we need to try and keep at range, and use magic damage only!" 

A spectre races up to attack Maireagh, *just* missing. Then another flanks but also misses. Temo takes the risk, stands his ground, aims and fires. CRIT! 58 damage. The spectre is obliterated. It vanishes with the same scream we heard earlier. Temo clearly sees the soul of an ancient Drow being released.

Vulture B flies in, flanks one spectre on Maireagh, land and attacking. It gets two hits in for 7 and 8 damage. The other flies in to attack as pack and goes for the same spectre but from about 5ft flying up, misses with the beak but gets the claws - 10 damage. That's enough and the spectre dissipates.

Netzha moves around to get a good view and transfers her hex, then throws two Eldritch Blasts (force damage) hitting both times - albeit only just, low rolls! - for 13 and 11 damage, which surprisingly is enough. These creatures are dangerous if they hit you but they're not hardy. There's only one left, but it's in melee range with Maireagh; she hits at close range twice for a maximum 16 and minimum 9 (!) - this spectre falls too.

The ghost is trembling! It says, "Have you killed them? Have you killed the dwarves? The dwarves are after me because I took it!" - Riglan says, "wait, they were Drow, not dwarves..." "What, Drow? No, I... Wait... What? No they're Dwarven spectres, the protectors because I took the crown - that's why they came and killed me - oh, oh no. Why am I here?" Temo comes up looking concerned and says, "Yes, Drow; you expected something else but I think you just got unlucky maybe? What can you tell us"? - pursusasion 19+12, *31*. He asks who we are and we briefly introduce ourselves. He's **Reulek**, a partner... ("in crime?" says Temo cheekily - "No, not crime! A partner...") with **Obratu** (an Oni - an evil spirit). It's treasure. He got to it first! "Look! It's the crown..." - he tries to pick it up but cannot. "I should never have taken it. The ancient dwarves guard their treasure, they killed me because I took it - I found it in the temple above us. I... I stole it. I stole it from the unworthy snake man; he would have worn it on his head of snakes. It does not belong to him. It belongs to *me*." - and he argues with himself a while. He was going to escape; but he came in here; he became trapped; there was a strange purple mist room, he got confused, ended up in here and the spectres killed him. "Did you say they were Drow? Not dwarves?"

The penny slowly drops. We explain that the person from whom he took it (Unrayle) did not deserve it at all; fully evil; the ghost starts wailing about being released, atoning. He insists that Maireagh returns it to the "king's tomb" - the hall of the hunting axe. "You! Old crone! Will you do that for Reulek?" - Riglan looks at Maireagh and says, "well, actually, we did consider going there, but we could only do it after we've finished all of this - just think Maireagh, we might find more information on those dwarves and how they lived..."

"Very well" says Maireagh. She is unimpressed. "Answer me truthfully *thief*. Is this cursed? Is this a trick?" "No! No, it is not a trick. I am tied to this plane" - and on he rants. Riglan insight only 8, he looks to Nethza and shrugs - insight 14 - "sounds like he's harmless but crazy?!" & Temo only 6, so **Riglan just decides to risk it. We agree**.

Maireagh picks up the crown and says, "all right, can you hold the bag open?!" and Riglan helps her store it there. It brushes his hands and a flood of memories come into his head, and he encourages Nethza and Temo to do the same. It's the **Lost Crown Of Besilmir**, so, it doesn't seem like this is a trick though it could still be cursed!

We take a short rest in this apparently-safe cavern, but keeping watch.

The space is "just another cavern" otherwise, with only one other exit, so we head that way, Westwards.

Along a wall in the tunnel that we enter, purple crystal pulses in the wall, as if growing. Riglan (Perception, 12+9) feels a kind of low rumble, almost as if going right-to-left (North to South). The tunnel itself turns North and continues a short distance before we see a branch, with a tunnel to the left descending towards us. It merges; we try to keep right and follow the tunnel we were already on. Riglan, Maireagh & Dog, Nethza, Temo guards the rear.

About 25ft ahead, the tunnel seems to end and open into a cavern. Riglan stops and sends the spider forward to look. When we're stopped, the rumbling and tremors are easier to perceive. It seems to move towards us from a distance, which is a worry! The spider crawls out into a large, but low-ceiling cavern - 15-20ft max - with maybe 10-15ft of floor that transitions into moving earth; a mud river, but more solid than mud somehow. It moves East to West, with a bubbling mud pool towards the right stretching almost to the cavern wall, but over the other side, there's a much longer cavern space - 70ft or more. Gorx warned us not to go in the earth river...

Standing in the middle of the mud pool, up to its upper calf maybe, is a medium sized elemental wearing (!) earth armour; it's tall, maybe 8ft, which seems to be studying the pool; it's not paying attention to anything else; spider perception nat 2, nothing obvious seems to be happening within about half a minute. Riglan risks waiting a little more - a few moments later, a bubble forms which the elemental seems to grasp and a small creature appears out of it, shaking mud off itself then flying up to the ceiling of the cavern. The spider pays more attention to that and sees other bits of mud flicking down. More of the small creatures.

Riglan's described this to the party. We figure that dispatching elementals can be tricky but holds no moral qualms for us and the main thing is to keep an eye on that earth river, because something might live in it, or we might try and get pushed in, so battle strategy would be to keep near cavern walls, to make it harder to get pushed in that direction. Maireagh activates her boots so she has a bit of protection from the river too.

We figure we'll sneak in to try and get into the room and within fighting range before being spotted. With that in mind, Temo goes first, then Riglan, Nethza and Maireagh's clanky armour last! Stealth:

* Temo only 16 - he sneaks in, albeit not his best work!
* Riglan 18,20 with advantage (two very good rolls) - follows, keeping close to the wall; we seem out of sight of the central cavern roof here
* Nethza 18 (anothergood roll) - no problems
* Maireagh 13+3, despite disadvantage - we all get in
* Dog 21 - wow

We're all in there, amazingly. Initiative:

* Nethza 21
* Maireagh 20
* Riglan 17
* Temo 16

Nethza gets a chance to sneak in an action. She moves her hex to the elemental and throws eldritch blasts (with the advantage of being hithertoo unseen). One hit, one crit! First only does 9 damage though, 18 for the crit (forgetting for a moment that she can do 3!). Maireagh flies into hammer range and throws, hitting twice - 18 and 18. The dog runs forward but to avoid river risk is kept away and dodges.

Riglan can't yet see the creatures on the roof and doesn't want to risk detection yet so throws Frostbite at the elemental. It takes effect, doing a solid 12 damage and slowing the elemental down slightly (disadvantage on its next attack). Amazingly, nothing else in the cave seems to have noticed this volley of attacks so Temo takes his chance to take his time and fire. He gets in a *very* strong hit (5,15+10, 1d6+6 max 12, 6,6,6,6,4,1 for the stealth - 41 damage!).

The injured elemental turns to face us and speaks - a strange voice, of grinding rock and rumbling earth. It's strange to see it wearing armour, which almost seems to be holding the elemental in shape. Out of the ground it pulls a huge maul and moves forward towards the closest assailant - Maireagh, who'd flown closer for the hammer. There's a strange thrumming as it swings the maul, which seems to be charging up somehow (Thunderous Strike) but Maireagh manages to dodge both blows, the first glancing off the armour (1 below AC) and the second going wild (nat 2). It makes a strange, loud, thunderous sound and from the cavern roof above numerous mud mephits descend.

One flies towards Maireagh but doesn't quite reach her; another heads towards Riglan; a third towards Nethza. Nethza strafes sideways to get a good view of the elemental and continues her attack on it - one hit, one miss; 14 damage - and that's enough! It crumbles and sinks into the earth river, the plate armour landing on the surface and slowly sinking; and we see that the flow is actually deceptively fast, as the armour moves rapidly towards the wall where it seems to exit. Nethza shouts, "Careful, I think these incoming mephits explode!" and, now remembering her newfound abilities, throws her third blast at her nearby mephit, hitting for 13.

Maireagh backs up, her closest mephit missing its opp attack and throws her hammer twice, hitting both times; 18, 17 damage - the mephit is destroyed, exploding harmlessly into sticky mud and small rock shards. At this, a fourth starts to fly down, again towards Maireagh. Riglan throws a firebolt at the one near him, which is effective and does a high (3d8, 6,7,8) 21 damage. Riglan activates his staff.

Temo looks around; he decides to aim and fire at the one near Nethza, as a balance of not too badly damaged but also not at melee. Crit! Dodgy damage rolls but total is 52... The mephit doesn't even get a chance to burst. It just dissolves into dust. Temo shouts, "Sorry Maireagh, I didn't want to risk that one right in your face..."

Two more fly out! They make a beeline towards Temo, side by side, but like Riglan he's at the back of the cave, so they're a distance away and can't reach him just yet.

Riglan's mephit comes up and belches mud out at him. DC11 dex save - Riglan nat 16+0, he dodges. The mud splatters on the ground and solidifies. Now the mephit tries to punch him! Riglan is so surprised that he fails to dodge and takes 4 damage.

Nethza transfers her hex to one of the two mephits heading towards Temo. Three blasts are thrown; all three hit; 13, 19, 11 damage. The mephit explodes, but one more is still coming Temo's way. Maireagh backs away once more - the mephit _does_ land its opportunity attack though, for 5 damage - the hammers fly in retaliation. Both hit; 18 and 22 damage, so that's another mephit down. She gets the dog to run over next to Riglan to help distract the mephit there. Riglan sees that and backs away from the mephit so he can throw another firebolt. The mephit misses its opportunity attack thanks to the dog's distraction. He *just* scrapes a hit and does 9 damage, which isn't much but does enough; the dog doesn't manage to dodge the mud that falls down, so gets temporarily stuck in place. "Sorry doggie!" shouts Riglan.

Temo aims at the incoming mephit and fires, hitting for 30 damage; the mephit explodes. We wait a moment - no more mephits - Maireagh comes over and cleans the dog. Riglan perception only 2+9; he notices nothing; but Nethza notices that we can squeeze around the edge of the pool, we don't need to cross over via flight or similar. It's a 3ft wide ledge but manageable. We walk sideways around it. As we do so, more bubbles emerge; as each pops, we see movement; each time a mud mephit forms, but is dragged down by the ooze around.

There are two exits on this side of the cavern. One is West, one North-West. Keep right! That's the north west exit. The ground rises; we climb. We get to a small, roughly circular cavern with a 20ft high ceiling, 20ft wide, an exit directly in front and one to the right. There seems to be nothing else in here. Temo (investigation 2+11) can't see anything untoward. The walkway ahead (West) dips, while the one to the right ascends; he sends his lizard to the right.

The lizard climbs along the right hand wall of the tunnel. While Temo is distracted, Riglan senses a tremor (perception 9+9) and notices parts of the ceiling start to fall! Dex saves all round - Riglan pulls Temo to avoid disadvantage. Temo dex 18, Riglan dex 10; Riglan gets hit by the rock that he's pulled Temo from. Maireagh is hit too, but Nethza and the dog dodge. Maireagh and Riglan both take 8 damage... We risk staying just a little longer, but Riglan's about ready to go chasing down the tunnel after the lizard if need be!

The lizard ends up after a while in a chamber with various alcoves and benches, and a few people. Lizard perception 19(!)-1 -> 18; Temo recognises some robed people, wearing earthen splint. Two stonemelder casters. There is slight movement in the shadows - three nothics! No chance of surprise here. There's a dwarf standing by some kind of foundy in the middle of the chamber near steam rising from a boiling mud puddle that seems to be powering a few things in the room. The dwarf is wearing tattered clothing, no armour, and is hammering away busily. The nothics seem to be just watching, not helping. The two Stonemelders seem to be busy making things.

Temo explains the situation and in particular mentions the dwarf, that given the clothing seems like might be a prisoner, nothics as guards. As we talk - Riglan, perception 11+9 - Riglan notices, looking around, that Nethza has gone! Her tail is last seen heading down the tunnel. We chase after! We see her walk into the room, wreath herself in fire and just stand there as she speaks in a remarkable, booming, voice, "YOU WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE AT ONCE! LEAVE US ALONE! FREE THE PRISONERS AND LEAVE THE CULT BEHIND. KEEP ON WALKING UNTIL YOU REACH THE SURFACE AND HELP THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE!" (Mass Suggestion, Wis save DC17). We just watch in astonishment. One stonemelder and all three of the nothics just simply start to leave! The other calls out after them in surprise.

Initiative:

* Riglan: 21
* Temo: 15 (despite advantage)
* Maireagh: 9
* Nethza: 5
* (Stonemelder: Nat 1!)

Riglan's seen Nethza using a big spell, so figures it's important. He pulls his lighting wand and throws lightning at the stonemelder; it doesn't dodge. 28 damage. One of the nothics has now left the room. Temo aims and fires at the stonemelder, hitting but for only 23 damage (low stealth damage roll). A second nothic scurries away. Maireagh moves forward and throws her hammer, but she's doing so at quite a distance (disadvantage); she hits once, for only 11 damage. The dog stands in front of her, guarding. The second stonemelder walks past Nethza, nodding politely and walks out of the room, accompanied by the last nothic. Nethza now throws three eldritch blasts at the remaining stonemelder, hitting twice; 7 and 16 damage. Low damage rolls for everyone - but that's enough. The stonemelder explodes! Shards of sharp metal and stone spray around but hit nobody.

Riglan: Perception 22. **He recognises the (very surprised!) dwarf; Rhundorth, one of the delegation members!** Riglan approaches. There's a moment; the dwarf seems to be stunned; then recognition and awareness slowly dawns... As if from another world away, he's seen us before. Riglan says, "Yes, I know it must be a shock, but it really is us."

"Oh! Wait? But it can't - oh my - but - why are you here?! It's been so long... I think we've met. I'm Rhundorth. I was travelling with a delegation on the surface..." - Riglan steps in and explains; yes, we know, we thought everyone was killed, later ended up tackling these strange cults and learning that in fact some had survived, which is why we're here. Rhundorth explains that his survival was by agreeing to provide smithing services for "the medusa" in exchange for safe passage of Teresiel, but he reneged, exchanging her with the fire people. "My sacrifice was for nothing." Riglan explains that by good luck, we had learned she was taken and did manage to rescue her, so his sacrifice - if nothing else - bought her just enough time.

"So what do you plan to do?" Riglan says - "we've no choice; we have to kill Unrayle - the medusa..." "How do you plan to do that?!" "Dunno, we usually make plans and they just go wrong so we'll kinda make it up and hope...!" "I don't suppose I could ask a favour?" "Of course!" "Would any of you happen to have a healing potion?" Riglan says, "one better" and casts L1 healing, which seems to help him a fair bit.

Rhundorth walks to a nearby bench and puts on a breastplate, then starts to armour himself and kit up fully. "Right. I'll show you the way. Are we going?!"

Oh! "Well, yes, but you might be at fair risk of death or being turned to stone" and we explain that if it gets sketchy, we describe the way back past the mud pool to at least Reulek's cave as a place he can hide and wait for us. But otherwise, we welcome the company. Riglan: Dirty 20 medicine check. Rhundorth is not fully healed. Riglan's a bit beaten up too, so **we decide to rest for a moment at least**.

Rhundorth explains that there's something called the Stone Cathedral, then a short tunnel and a weird place where Marloss hangs out with a strange floating rock. We explain in brief what that is and why it's important for us to get rid of Marloss and destroy the weapon he carries, but also Riglan does point out that this had quite dramatic consequences in the fire node and we should be prepared to run pretty quickly if it comes to it. Likewise, if anything comes *through* that portal while we fight, Rhundorth should flee as quick as he can to hopefully get to the surface to warn people.

While we rest, Maireagh uses a L3 spell to give Nethza, Temo and Riglan 10 HP increase via Aid. Riglan uses his staff to produce Goodberries for Rhundorth. (Riglan doesn't get around to dropping in the bear totem - we head a break, didn't remember and didn't retcon).

**Towards the end of our rest, the ground rumbles again, but this time it isn't a wave; it's a constant rumble, rising in intensity.** This gives us a sense of sudden and quite extreme urgency. "Are you ready? Let's go get this guy!" says Rhundorth and runs off, quite sure-footed on the unsteady ground, but the rest of us are finding it harder to keep upright.

We run through a short tunnel into the next cavern. It's too long for Riglan to see the far end due to the limits of darkvision - there's very little light here - but small spots of purple light here and there give the impression of a large cavern; this is the cathedral of which Rhundorth spoke, but Rhudorth is ignoring it and bearing rightwards towards another exit. Steps, carved roughly out of the earth, descend.

We enter a colossal cavern, like an alien landscape. The ceiling soars up maybe 120ft, carved with giant stone buttresses. Eight strange twisting columns of rock with globular growths along their length form a roughly ovoid shape. Veins and shards of purple crystal all over the cavern give it an eerie glow. The stairs continue, but look almost like extruded stone slabs, toppled like dominos, that lead up to the base of a giant stone monolith, with a familiar-looking sight - a strange ball of rock and earth drawing in earth from around it, spinning and folding. At the base of this altar is the now-familiar form of Marloss Unrayle, his iron spike held aloft, thunderous energy booming out in waves, thrumming with force as the ground starts to develop a strange kind of rhythm. The shape of the spinning ball is changing and starting to look something like Riglan's dreams; the cavern is growing as its walls are consumed, rock forming orbiting rings, collapsing and re-growing; emerging, a hand, then another hand, pulling the rock apart, widening an opening which keeps re-collapsing, then being pulled open again.

We're about 250ft away from the altar, running towards it. Nethza activates her cloak. Maireagh her boots, picking up the dog. Riglan turns into giant eagle and picks up Rhundorth; Temo jumps on his back (acro 17); he pulls on the feathers which is a bit painful but gets onto the back shouting to a surprised Rhundorth, "Just go with it, Riglan does this kind of thing!"

When we're around 100ft we're close enough to hear, over the din, chanting. A series of three shockwaves burst out from Marloss. Within 80ft, he turns and says, "Ha! I was wondering when you'd make it here. **Whatever you think, you're *far* too late!**" He throws back his hood and the snakes on his head writhe. He's dressed in some kind of ceremonial, priestly garb. Gargoyles break free from the stone around and fly towards us, but they get pulled into the orbit of the sphere... "...As I said, you're too late! Ironfang has pierced the veil. **I have fulfilled my destiny!**" - the ground suddenly stops shuddering; "I call forth the mountain of doom. **ALL SHALL FALL UNDER HIS DOMINION!**" and he slams the pick into the monolith base; it shatters and big chunks are sucked into the ball of rock, which then bursts open, a 50-60ft tall rock colossus emerging. Imix himself. There are no eyes. It forms a rough maw which opens and a deep grinding, rock sound opens as it speaks - "I sense the presence of the defilers! The dwarves who dare to take that which is mine! You imbeciles! INFIDELS! Harvesting from the earth. **I own everything in the earth!** You thieves will be wiped from this plane and all planes!" - it raises its arms.

Initiative rolls are not good:

* Temo: only 15
* Maireagh: 12
* Nethza: 12
* Riglan: 9
* Rhundorth: 7
* Vultures (see below): 6

Temo shouts, "we have to believe that we can close that rift if we focus on getting that pick!" and, from the back of the eagle, aims and fires at Marloss from about 80ft away. Hits but bad damage roll, only 23. Maireagh is flying too, trying to decide what to do; she flies out wide and down to drop the dog, then throws the hammer at high range (about 40ft) and without looking! Despite this, both attacks find their mark, for 18 and 15 damage with an arcane jolt added in for 5 more damage. She tells the dog to run right up to Marloss, reasoning that as an unliving construct, it cannot be turned to stone.

Nethza wants to transfer hex; she's within 90ft so can; she flies the opposite way around to Maireagh to keep the party dispersed and throws three eldritch blasts. Miss, crit, hit; 28 and 16. Riglan's up. He drops Rhundorth, turns back into himself so Temo tumbles to the ground - nat 20 acrobatics, risks looking at Marloss, uses his wand and throws a lightning bolt towards Marloss and the colossus. 31 potential damage. Both save, taking only 15 damage as a result. He runs sideways the same direction as Maireagh.  Rhundorth just runs in a straight line to get as close as he can to Marloss. So much for running back to warn people!

Ogremoch has now kind of fully formed. Crystalline protrusions emerge all over him, glowing; then it flares, outlining all creatures within 30ft (Faerie Fire style) - no saving throw. Ogremoch (initiative only 2) looks around, picks up a boulder, crushes it, does something that sounds a bit like a laugh and parts of him seem to tumble down to the ground as 3 earth elementals emerge around him (and their initiative is roll is only 3, which is just *above* so they have to wait a while to get a turn). Riglan notices that Ogremoch is slightly smaller as a result of conjuring the elementals, but if anything it's only the equivalent of very mild injury.

Marloss (initiative nat 1!) acts. Rhundorth is nearby, but his eyes are fixed on the ground in front of him. Marloss's snake hair writhes even more as he swings at the dog with Ironfang, hitting once for 13 damage. He steps forward, his snakes trying to attack Rhundorth; the dog intervenes, which causes them to miss as the dog yanks on Marloss' cloak, pulling him back a bit.

Ogremoch (equiv. lair action) causes violent tremors to shake the whole area of the cavern (120ft radius). Dex saves all round. Temo nat 20+9 saves, Riglan 17+3 saves, Rhundorth is OK too but the dog rocks over onto its side, somewhat embarrassingly. Nethza and Maireagh are in the air.

Temo shouts, "Rhundorth, you risk being in the way and you're in terrible danger, try to get clear!" and once more risks looking, aiming and firing at Unrayle. Crit! A whopping 64 damage, too, which is Temo's highest damage ever. The bolt goes straight through his - Marloss turns in surprise, all the snake heads looking at him, astonished - as the head just slides off sideways and the body crumples to the ground. Crikey. Temo just says - "...wait, what?" - **Temo killed Unrayle**. Temo then shouts, "Weapon! Portal! Weapon!"

Maireagh shouts, "Temo, WHAT? Oh, got to get it from the *middle of all those elementals and a god?! Great, fantastic...!" - she flies in to attack earth elemental 3, **crit** and hit. 28, 13 damage. She gets the dog to engage elemental 1 nearest to it; it does hit, for a good 10 damage. Nethza transfers her hex to elemental 3 that Maireagh tackled and attacks; sadly, only one hit for 12 damage.

Riglan runs up, casts L5 Conjure Animals for 4x CR1. By pure good luck, he gets 4 giant vultures; he was hoping for flying creatures to keep things mixed up; he also drops in the bear totem, catching all of them, Nethza, Maireagh, Rundorth and the dog, but not himself or Temo. He tells 3 vultures to attack and one to hold back, looking for the pick, to grab it if possible.

Ogremock creates a big earth tremor, which cause Rhundorth to fall over too; the dog is also on its side. He gets back up and takes a swing at elemental 3 in a rage. He attacks twice, hitting once for 7 damage.

Giant vulture 1 attacks elemental 1. Beak: Crit! But only 1,1,1,3 -> 6+2 -> 8 damage. Second is a crit *miss*. Vulture 2 surprisingly goes for Ogremoch since it has flanking advantage. It rolls well (including a 19) but misses everything. Vulture 3 sees this and elects to attack elemental 1 again (no flanking due to altitude). Misses both. Vulture 4 holds back as instructed, holding its action to swoop in and get the pick if an opening arises.

Now the elementals act. Elemental 1 slams down on the prone dog with advantage, hitting twice. 28 damage in total. Elemental 2 slides down into the ground - nearby vulture opp attack misses - emerging right next to Riglan. Elemental 3 attacks Rhundorth, getting in one hit with 14 damage.

Ogremoch erupts in light once more as another legendary action, marking everyone except Riglan and Temo in this strange light - all attacks against us at advantage. Then it's his turn. He picks up a boulder and hurls it at Maireagh (hates dwarves!). Temo is about to use Silvery Barbs, but Maireagh just dodges. Now Ogremoch makes a slam attack against the vulture 2 and of course hits, 4d10+8 -> a high roll of 31, but the vulture just hangs on. 

Now there's another lair action equivalent. Sink holes and fissures appear on the ground around us at the edges of the cavern; meanwhile, crystalline spikes start to break the ground nearby, the ground shaking in the area around Riglan; he becomes hemmed in by sharp spikes - he'll take damage if he moves or falls.

Temo aims at elemental 3, trying to create a path through for the vulture to swoop in, and fires. An iffy 26 damage. It's not enough. Maireagh attacks it too, hitting twice for 11 and 15. The dog gets up and moves back triggering an opp attack from elemental 1 which misses, to get alongside Rhundorth and elemental 3, then adopts a dodging position.

Ogremoch stomps the ground. Rhundorth falls but the dog stays up this time. Nethza yells, "Riglan, are you OK over there?!" "Yes - Misty Step!" - and after a moment of indecision from myriad possibilities, she sticks to the plan and throws two Eldritch Blasts at elemental 3 to be safe, taking it down, but also one more at elemental 1, hitting for 14 damage. She transfers Vulture 4 is triggered by elemental 3 falling - a path is open. It flies in, grabs the pick and flies back out triggering an opp attack from Ogremoch, which tries to slam it and hits for a huge 35 damage but the vulture just escapes death. Riglan shouts, "Vulture's got the pick!".

Riglan, realising that he can't misty step *and* do a decent attack, just tries his wand on the elemental right next to him. 36 damage is dealt. He holds his ground. He shouts to the vulture, "Give the pick to Nethza! Nethza! Try what we did before, if there's an opening, get the pick in there - we need to get Ogremoch to move..."

Rhundorth stands up and attacks the nearest elemental (#1 - he wants to help Riglan but can't get there after standing). Both hit; 15 and 8 damage. Seeing this, Ogremoch stomps again and of course, Rhundorth falls over - the dog too, this time.

Vulture 1 tries its luck attacking elemental 2. Vulture 2 has no choice and continues attacking Ogremoch with advantage, and actually hits (21). 7 damage. The claws hit too, but only for 5. Vulture 3 attacks elemental 1, hitting for 6 with the beak and missing with the claws. Vulture 4 flies up to Nethza and hands her the pick - but there's nothing wrapping it or protecting it. Nethza feels the pull of the weapon's effects on the mind and also succumbs, but Maireagh shouts "Nethza! Remember! You have to fight the effects of those things!" and via Flash Of Genius Nethza *exactly* makes the DC20 save. Then the vulture looks to Riglan, flies down but can't land due to the sharp ground and attacks elemental 2 without flanking. Misses all attacks by a lot, sadly.

Elemental 1 sees the prone Rhundorth and attacks, hitting twice for a total of 28 halved due to raging to 14. Elemental 2 attacks Riglan. Riglan's not glowing with Ogremoch's strange light and despite the sharp spikes around, he manages to awkwardly dodge both attacks.

Ogremoch throws another boulder at Nethza, seeing and hearing that she has the pick. Temo sees that the aim would be true and tries Silvery Barbs; that's enough; the bolder just misses. Annoyed, Ogremoch lifts up his arm and slams it down on vulture 2, hitting for 29 and taking the vulture down. It does another ground smash now, with a wider radius; Riglan avoids falling into the spikes (14+3), Temo too (but has to use a luck point).

Temo shouts, "Ogremoch, I presume? Not even so polite as to introduce yourself. Those pathetic earth tremors mean nothing to me; I can stand here and throw arrows at you all day long until you fall. You want me? Come and get me, you lazy creature." Intimidation, blowing his long-held inspiration for advantage: 19+4! "Ha! Small creature? You will be crushed! Ha!" is the response. Temo aims and fires. Adv roll 3 and 20! Poetic crit - 54 damage! A chunk of Ogremoch's face is briefly knocked off before reforming. He roars, "Insolent creature! Living on MY GROUND! You dare! Rargh!" - chunks of his body break off and a flying stone gargoyle appears.

Maireagh attacks elemental 1, hitting once with a radiant smite for 33 damage then hitting again for 20 more. Nethza meanwhile is flying around sideways to try and find a portal opening; she throws two Eldritch Blast bolts at elemental 1 and one at Ogremoch. Hit, hit, miss for 17 and a very high 20 damage; elemental 1 crumbles. She moves the hex to Ogremoch.

Riglan is still toe to toe with elemental 2, and since vulture 4 had to stay in the air, he can use his wand once more or could just try for Ogremoch. Why not? We want to try and goad the god to movement. So, he points at Ogremoch and zaps away. Ogremoch fails the save but uses a legendary resistance to do so. 18 damage (36 rolled). Riglan curses. He activates his staff, just in case.

Rhundorth once more gets to his feet. He runs towards Riglan and elemental 2 but the spikes are in the way; instead he hurls a small axe yelling, "COME AT ME!" but wildly misses.

Vulture 1 flies around to try its luck with the newly-appeared gargoyle. The beak hits for 7, talons too for a decent 11 damage. Vulture 3 flies around and can't flank but tries the same thing. Beak hits for only 5, talons miss. Vulture 4 continues trying to attack elemental 2, but misses both attacks.

Elemental 2 tries to slam the vulture once and Riglan once. The vulture takes 16 damage and Riglan takes 14, but holds his spell. The elemental 2 goes into the ground; opp attack misses; it reappears about 10ft from Temo. Now the gargoyle moves, flying towards Nethza. Both nearby vultures try to strike with talons. Crit (!) and dirty 20 for 16 and a high 12 for the second regular hit. The gargole is barely hanging on, but is still up; it attacks Nethza. Its bite misses but the claws crit and Temo is too far away to help. 7 damage. She holds her spell.

Ogremoch acts. Nethza's within 15 feet - which it turns out is within his reach. He slams at her twice, with advantage as she's still glowing (it just lasts indefinitely, it seems). Both hit. 27 - hex spell holds - and 20 - hex still maintained. As a lair action he targets Rhundorth, causing rocky earth around him to turn into sticky mud. Rhundorth sinks into it and is restrained.

Temo sighs and aims and fires, ignoring the elemental for now, at Ogremoch. His prior luck as very much run out - he misses completely, luck point, still misses completely.

Maireagh flies around near Nethza to attack the gargolye. She hits and takes it down. With her second attack she goes for Ogremoch, all of us now trying to goad him away; she *just* hits (AC20 matched) for 17 damage, with an arcane jolt for good measure.

Nethza tries some deception... "Riglan, I'm coming to you, you need to take the spike and get it away from here - like that time on the Grand Dame when <some reference>..." (to Riglan's confusion - insight 11+5; he recognises her reference to a deception Temo tried) and she stops short of him, not casting anything. Riglan perception 20+9 - she's holding out the pick, but in her other hand Riglan sees the glowing energy of a spell that she seems to be holding. Arcana check 18-1; he's seen something that looks similar before in a *dream* - feels like Dimension Door. She's reached out the pick towards him.

He shouts, "Yes, we must get it far away from here, it's our only chance now!" - Riglan reaches up gathering the tail of his cloak to grab the pick with the cloak hopefully shielding him from its mental effects. Wisdom save 27 (DC was lower). Both of us are now momentarily holding the pick. Riglan winks and watches Ogremoch keenly.

Rhundorth climbs slowly out of the sticky mud!

Vulture 1 flies to flank Ogremoch and tries to attack. Crit! 14 with the beak. Hits with the claws too. 9 more damage. Vulture 3 does the same. Beak JUST gets a hit, 5 damage; the claws miss. Vulture 4 flies to elemental 2 near Temo and attacks, crit again! Highest damage yet; 15. Misses with the claws though. The elemental moves forward to attack Temo; vulture 4 opp attacks with talons, crit again. Wut. Low roll but still 13 damage. The elemental now swipes at Temo, hitting twice for 14 and 12 damage.

Ogremoch releases another gargoyle. He looks to us and growls, "*No*"; he puts his hand into the ground and a wall of stone appears behind us, across the entire length of the cavern, 30ft high. It's between Riglan and Temo, Vulture and elemental, so those three can't see much anymore. Now he walks forward, crushing Marloss underfoot and narrowly avoiding the dog. The portal is visible.

Riglan whispers, "Now!" to Nethza. She releases Dimension Door. We both portal, and Riglan finds himself in the air above the portal. She lets go of the spike. Riglan shouts, "WATCH OUT EVERYONE!" and as Riglan falls, he tries to twist and throw the spike. Of all the times for a *nat 1*. Seeing Riglan fumbling, Maireagh shouts, "Twist! Twist your body!" and aids with a flash of genius. That's a total of 14, just enough (DC13).

Riglan *just* - clumsily and as unlike a hero as one could really be - tries to throw the spike but it's tangled in his cloak and instead, **finds himself falling into the portal** *with* the spike. He catches a brief glimpse of horror on Nethza's face.

He's falling into a bizarre environment. He's at a great height in the sky. Floating mountains, looking like two mountains stuck base to base, hover in the sky. Rings of stone seem to float. Gravity appears to have no meaning here; it's hard to tell what's ground or sky, though he falls anyway. The sky is a strange orangey-red, as if filled with dust and debris. Chasms, land, valleys, all sorts of strange features are all around. The pick comes in with him, but he gets the feeling that he might be able to step to the edge if he misty steps.

Wisdom saving, for speed with his magic; 8+9; 17, he misty steps to the portal's edge and grabs it, pulling himself out, like Ogremoch did. Dex save 16+0. He lands just about on his feet. The cavern is already starting to pull apart, all coming towards him at the portal. Ogremoch is screaming, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!" as pieces of him peel off, all hurtling towards the portal. Riglan's shouting "run run run run!" at this point as he runs, but the portal collapses with a huge thunderclap. Con saves all round:

* Riglan only 9
* Nethza only 7
* Temo 17 (saves)
* Maireagh 17 (saves)
* Dog 20 (saves)
* Rhundorth 19 (saves)

Riglan and Nethza were closest and are hit hard. 34 damage; everyone else 17. Riglan almost loses his spell and reacts without thinking via his cloak. Two vultures manage to survive, but vulture 4 is taken down.

The sinkholes start to fill by themselves, bizarrely; purple crystals around start to dissolve to dust; the tremors have stopped. It's fully dark, so Riglan uses his shoulder light. Temo uses his ring. It's a pretty bizarre sight with with all the chunks of earth and general mess. In the silence, we realise that a low-level rumble that we've been hearing for a day or two now has finally abated.

Riglan casts Mass Cure Wounds at L5, healing everyone except the dog for 22. It's a precaution. Temo investigates the squished remains of Unrayle, which is mostly just jam under some rubble now (investigation total 27). Nothing is left; Temo is confident that he had nothing of value on him anyway, just ceremonial clothes. The body is disintegrating and bits of dust start to fall from the ceiling. Temo shouts, "it's slower, but this place is starting to collapse - definitely time to run!" and we begin to run out, Riglan thanking his two vultures and sending them back to the Fey since they won't fit through some of the smaller tunnels.

As we do so, we notice that the ground is changing; the cavern was shaped, it seems, by magic and things bleeding from the elemental plane. The pillars are the first to go. Smoothed out shapes crack and crumble. The steps start to fall away but we get through. We see fleeing cultists as soon as we get to the now fully dark cathedral; a priest, clutching the earth symbol is trying to cast a spell, looking in despair. Temo, at this, walks up to him, lays a hand on his leg, and says, "You were led astray. Don't let this define you. Head to the surface and see who you can help there."

Some look fearful. Others look angry. The evil mental influence is gone and people are realising what's happened. Some advance on the priests - Temo shouts at them, "Just leave, no time for revenge!" (persuasion 26). We get swept into the exodus, ending up going a different way; a bridge over the strange earth river, which is solidifying into dust. Crumbled gargoyles disintegrate. We see hook horrors, now digging down into the sand as if trying to escape.

**At the main entrance, Riglan (perception dirty 20) sees a glint in an alcove. Gorx! He is watching everyone, looking puzzled. It waves at Riglan. Riglan waves back as Gorx chomps its way back down into the ground.**

The throng of people head up the stairs, rushing. We get as far as the Fane level and try to head off to one side to let the others flee and not get trampled.

It's done - the earth cult is gone.

Riglan checks in with Rhundorth, using the cleaning stone to get rid of some of the mud. "What now?" he asks Riglan. "Where is Teresiel?" "She said to find us Summit Hall if we got out quickly, else after a few days, Goldenfields. I'm not sure if we should head there directly, via the river, or if us five (gesturing to the party including dog) need to finish up some business with the air cult - their leader is gone, but otherwise they're strong and the portal there is still open, so there's a slim chance, even though we have the weapon, of some kind of resurgence. We also have a bit of a score to settle there. But maybe it can wait a day or two..."

Riglan elects to use the last incense for divination. He asks the question, "What is the air cultist ex-second in command doing right now?" and casts his ritual.

Riglan sees confusion in the smoke, until it coalesces to an image of a cloud giant, trying to bring people together but falling to a group of druids. Then Riglan sees what he thinks is the air node and a vortex within; it shows him Aerisi's weapon and the magic at its heart which we recognise from the destruction of Drown. He sees the huge cavern with ships and waterfalls and the water node, it seems, is gone from it. Destroying the weapon in the Forge destroyed the node.

Riglan relays this. With a catch in his voice, he says, "...I think we can go home. We'll keep our promise to Reulek soon enough, but for now, I think we can actually breathe a sigh of relief..." - and he offers to accompany Rhundorth to Summit Hall. There are hugs and hand shakes all around.

### (8888 XP (!) - plus 888 for Arcane Foundry, all eights today! - and 800 more for mud pool)

**Riglan takes a moment. It seems... Well. *We did it*.**

We start on the long climb up, sticking with the earth cult and cutting across to the monastery stairwell. We get to the monastery, seeing cultists scattering over the landscape around. On the way through the monastery, Riglan looks for any sign of Renwick; he is hiding in his tower. Temo sends a paper bird to let Renwick know that we Unrayle is dead and the cult disbanding; we thank Renwick again for his help and say we hope to meet again one day.

We head down the river and find our boat, still hidden in branches; we cross the river with it and hide away on the other side. We find the previously-used path back to the main road, with Rhundorth explaining what had happened at each place, as he was brought this way after the ambush. When we get to the place of battle we show him where we'd laid people to rest. He goes to the graves and says some kind of prayer, then thanks us for interring them into the ground - "for a few of these dwarves, the fact that they've been laid to rest here, in the land of old Besilmir, would mean a lot to them". As we continue, Maireagh starts chatting about what we've discovered with Rhundorth; how it wasn't a failed kingdom, that these dwarves didn't abandon the surface and were in fact *forced* down and under siege. The two debate for a while, Rhundorth somewhat incredulous. Maireagh explains that not all dwarves are the same; she loves the dwarven cities, but she loves the sun, trees and plants, fresh air and being able to see for miles. We hear her talking about liking towers, to see over trees and towards mountains. He concedes that he can see how some dwarves might feel that way, not be, well, scared without walls all around.

We talk for a while about how strange it was that we were all scattered in the battle, each fighting our own corners; how Riglan fell because the pick caught in his cape - and on it goes. Before we know it it's evening and we're at Summit Hall. It's autumn now, so the sun hangs lower at this time and Riglan notices suddenly that the leaves on some trees are already changing colour - he feels out of touch with nature suddenly. Smoke rises from a chimney or two at the hall and we become more aware of the chill in the air.

The guard watch at the tower calls out as we arrive and a rider emerges from the gates to meet us. We are recognised. Teresiel comes out a moment later and sees Rhundorth who runs up to her to see how she is. They're polite - there is still some decorum - but there is nonetheless joy at their meeting. They of course both start to chat quickly about what happened to each of them. At one moment, Teresiel manages to look over and make eye contact, nodding and smiling at us. We're all led inside.

Harvest is well underway from the main garden. The main fire inside is going and the keep is warm. The Knight Commander **Ushien** not in full armour for some reason, comes down from the stairs to greet us. "So, it is true - Teresiel said she felt a change in the earth. A silence descending upon the ground and she urged us to prepare a room and we did! But it looks like we should have prepared two perhaps?" (looking to Rhundorth) - he says, "Oh no, I don't need a room. Just a comfortable armchair by the fire with a barrel of ale and I'll be right as rain and happy as a lamb!" - at this, Maireagh pulls a cask of dwarven ale from her bag, to Rhundorth's delight.

Nethza drops her bag off upstairs and offers to magically heat the reservoir of water used for bathing so we can all have a hot bath.

Riglan and Temo wander off towards the back garden, now in quite deep twilight. A few squires are there, re-sewing some of the plants back for over winter and into next year.

Riglan says to Temo as we walk through the gardens and trees, "well, money doesn't last forever, but we have enough that if we're careful, it could last a lifetime for us. The world is yours Temo, to protect and nuture and do what you will." "What do you mean? Why are you talking like this?" "Oh, I'm not leaving or anything, at least, of course I'll go on travels and whoever comes with me, well, that'll be whatever it is, but that applies to us all. Maireagh's given us a home in Old Owlbear Keep. That's what she wants, and I'm happy to be there, but we've also got other places important to us - my tribe; and in your case, perhaps Celline...?" "It's too early to think about all this! We were just down in a dungeon a few hours ago. Is our work done? I can't remember what we were doing before all this?"

By now we're headed back inside. Riglan thinks for a minute and says, "well, yes, that's true, I suppose I've started to think in much faster terms than I used to. IT's been a blur these past few months. I think we came to Yartar to sign the paperwork for the keep mostly, which we did! Nethza comes down the stairs as we get to the main hall - she's in her fine clothes. Riglan says, "Well, Nethza, you look spectacular!" - she recommends the bath, so Temo heads up and Riglan has his turn (but waits til later as he's still not entirely used to clothes and excessive warmth).

Later, Nethza asks what we were talking about. Riglan explains; we have so many options now. Tremendous wealth, even if we *don't* sell half of what we found, especially a percentage in the forge. We can do almost anything.

Food is brought out. The night Captain has ordered almost a full feast. We contribute as much as we can - things are likely to be slim picking from the ground as autumn heads in, even with balance restored; it'll take a season or three to recover. "So, what's the plan now," asks the night Captain - "what are you going to do?" Teresiel says she's nearly recovered now, but within a day or two she should be at full strength. She thanks Summit Hall for sheltering her there and, indeed, thanks us for our rescue efforts. "I am headed down to Goldenfields. I think I'd like to go down by boat, so I'll get to Riverguard Keep - a safe outpost now, I hear - and perhaps we can get a boat down, Rhundorth, you and I?" "Hmm, well, I'll stay with you here but I've no interest in going to a farm! Waterdeep, I'm happy to head to; I do have some things to deliver..." We mention that Desenya is down there and urged us to seek her out one day.

Riglan says, "well, I was thinking of seeing Goldenfields but also we've been invited to Waterdeep. We do have boat still but only small, but if Teresiel doesn't mind roughing it we have good tents, a magical hut and we could certainly get to Goldenfields and see what lies beyond. However, Riglan is concerned that he'd like to destroy the Aerisi's spear "Windvane" at the Forge of Spells. Riglan points out that if she's not leaving for two mornings hence, he can get there and back here in that time. He can fast travel once a day now. Teresiel knows what he has in mind, so she agrees. Rhundorth is happy to keep her company for now; he is exhausted too (the waits are down to points of exhaustion for the ex-captives) but isn't keen on boats. He likes having solid stone under his feet! Crossing a river is one thing, but miles of travel is something else. He says he'll go down the Dessarin Road and through to Womford. Riglan agrees, and since Rhundorth is resting and will be here when we get back so we'll leave together at least.

Before bed, Temo writes a paper bird for the Water Baron at Yartar. "You've hopefully noticed things seeming more normal. We think we've sorted the problem below. Hope to be back in town one day soon" and sends it off.

As we wrap up, we head to the rooms and, finally, get to sleep somewhere safe.

Just before Riglan drops to sleep, there's a soft knock on the door and a whispering voice, "Riglan, are you there" - it's Teresiel. Riglan quietly sneaks outside. She invites him to walk with her, so he agrees. We head downstairs, Teresiel chatting. "Have you felt a change in the wind? Do you feel that nature is speaking to you?" Riglan confesses that he found it a bit jarring when he realised Autumn was falling and hadn't seen that change coming early as he normally would, due to being underground, but he's certainly aware of the undertone of unrest having gone from his mind. Teresiel says that the seasons were out of balance - the leaves turned colour yesterday, so he didn't really miss anything. It suddenly feels like things are "back on track". "I believe that whatever you did down there has restored the balance". As we walk through the gardens, Teresiel points out various plants and how things were different just a day ago. "It feels like a knot in the fabric of the world itself has been smoothed out, like energy is flowing again."

She asks what happened, wanting to understand more; she isn't sure why nature was out of balance. Riglan does his best to explain the evil below and how it had an influence on everything above that became quiet powerful and far reaching, with it building in fact over at least centuries, but that the nature or source of that influence is something we never truly understood other than it being a bleed-through of other planes. Those doors are now shut, except for the air node. Teresiel says that yes, things aren't *quite* right now and she'd assumed it might just happen over time, but it sounds like closing that node ought to solve it. "There are others of us, far older and wiser, spread across the forests and mountains, ancient swamps, forgotten coastlines, hidden islands - throughout this world - all tasked with protecting and nurturing life. Ever-vigilant against those who would enter from beyond. You have been to Shadowtop; I can sense that in you; **if you seek out the Horizon Walkers there,** perhaps you might be able to help them understand how they managed to miss this intrusion into our world so that it doesn't happen again. They may be able to find a way to prevent future incursions and increase our resilience... Do you... How *do* you feel, about taking a more active role in the Enclave?"

Riglan says, "Well, I'm not sure what my tribe had in mind with its concept of someone occasionally being 'a wanderer', but it seems that understanding the evolving world around us must be part of that and trying to protect my own forest, along with others if possible - not just forests, but nature overall - is surely what we aim for and why I was sent out. If taking a more active role helps, then, yes."

"Your kind is reclusive. But you have a great connection to nature, especially the forests. If you are interested in exploring beyond, the Enclave would be glad to involve you more. Feel no obligation, please, to do so; we need Spring Wardens just as much as other members for our network, spread far and wide, is always spread thin. We work independently, more of an organism than an organisation. I'm happy that you're coming with me to Goldenfields... I wish you wisdom and safety on your journey tomorrow. I look forward to your return. Thank you for this walk, Riglan." She looks up at the half-moon in the sky. "Those who worship Selune would say that better days are on their way; but we know that it's simply a cycle. Things go up, things go down. At the moment, up! And that feels good." - We head back into the keep.

Riglan sleeps soundly - no dreams.
