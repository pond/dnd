# Riglan: Part 14

## DAY 81

We awake at the start of our second full day at Shadowtop Cathedral. Riglan remembers no unusual dreams. Maireagh presents Riglan with his upgraded cloak and takes the signet ring back for future use. Riglan's super happy with this and thanks her profusely.

Breakfast is a similar affair to the previous day. While eating, Orihorn returns; we offer him a seat at the table but he's not hungry. Back at Irrasil, temperatures are normal, fires are out and the village is, while extensively and heavily damaged, certainly rebuildable. He intends to recommend that the refugees do so. He says that we could be useful helping them with plant growth.

Riglan's delighted to be able to help - we have to wait for Turlang but then we can definitely head that way. Orihorn then tells us that he'd seen Turlang on the move; headed back to his grove. Orihorn's headed off to meditate, so we find Aramais and ask a frog where Moonan is. Finding her at a pool, she offers us a slice of a cake made from pond weed and lotus root. Sounds a bit strange but worth a try. Not bad actually! Fresh and herby. Moonan's keen to come along, but is bringing a friend too who she goes and fetches. She first wraps up and packs the cake, then goes into the pond, emerging with a small bowl with two very brightly coloured young tree frogs - they're actually changing colour rapidly.  She wants to show them to Turlang.

We head off!

This time, Moonan suggests the dry route herself as she doesn't want to unbalance the pool water in the bowl of frogs. About half an hour later, we are in Turlang's wooded area once more. As we're arriving, Moonan says - "Oh! He's not here... Are you sure that he was going to be here?" We say that Orihorn said he was coming this way - perhaps we beat him to it. Moonan sits and offers her cake, so we spend time hanging out. Aramais is talking to another tree ent. Some very tall conifers grow here, alongside tall deciduous trees. A mixed wood. Riglan decides to chat to another tree - a nearby old oak has low hanging branches that should allow conversation without needing to climb, so Riglan says "hi" to one. How long as it been in the grove? Since it was born. It has seen a few hundred winters now. It offers Riglan an Acorn - "plant it wherever your home is, and a big oak tree will grow". Riglan things of Carp and Carp's mother's place - a good site. It turns out this tree is descended from The Grandfather Tree distantly, so this acorn will have quite a heritage. It asks about why we're here - Turlang. Apparently, it says, Turlang "awoke" about 1000 years ago, but it's unusual; Turlang is quite big. They usually wake up when younger and smaller, but he woke up late. The Oak doesn't know why. Riglan thanks the oak for the acorn, and lets it go back to dreaming. It does say, "Who knows? Maybe this oak will wake up a dream too."

Turlang arrives. He thanks us for waiting for several weeks (!) while he took time to find his memories in the caves. He settles his roots down into the soil - makes him feel good! - then Moonan shows him the frogs. Turlang says he can't see them - too small. Riglan offers to climb up to help with the spyglass, but Turlang asks instead to have the bowl brought up. Moonan can't really climb - shell gets in the way. Riglan obliges. Turlang seems impressed and after some conversation realises that these are a gift and he's quite happy - he's always wanted tree frogs, but doesn't have a water hollow. The bowl solves it.

Right. Of memories.

He has heard of the elemental evil cult before and is aware of them as the elves have talked about them. They were involved in the previous attempt to drive them back. The elves traced the cult to a Drow temple, but he doesn't know where it is. The temple was a summoning ground and a tending place, very deep underground. Maybe even far enough down to be considered the underdark. Turlang remembers elemental chaos, that had been building for months with quite widespread devastation threatening even the high forest. He recalls needing to help defend the high forest along with the wild elves that still lived there at the time. The very, very early ancestors of the Uthgardt Barbarians - ragtag bands of primitive humans living on the plains beyond the woods - came to help. The battle was within the woods of the time, but that'd be outside the borders now as the forest has receded many miles over that time. An alliance of these humans and learned humans assisting them - beginnings of a "higher society" of Netherese humans who had been nurtured by original kingdom of the elves that lived in the High Forest - worked with the elves. The Netherese were in part behind the rise then; some of their mages had been seduced by the cults; so that's why they rallied to wage war against them. Dwarves were involved too.

The war was fought on the surface, but the victory was achieved in the temple, beyond where armies could reach. So really the armies were just trying to hold back the tide and reduce the damage caused by the hoards of elementals unleashed upon the surface. Hundreds of them. He repeats the information about the four elemental princes.

* Air: Yan-C-Bin - prince of evil air; the shadow of the four winds and the howling hatred who lives in the dark places of the world, unleashing itself as storms and tempests
* Fire: Imix - the all-consuming fire, the eternal flame that seeks to devour everything
* Water: Olhydra - actually, a princess - the crushing wave; the well of endless anguish; seeks to drown everything in hopelessness, despair and sorrow
* Earth: Ogrémoch - the tyrant of black earth, the mountain of doom who wants to return the earth to its primal state, where nothing grows, no cities rise, no creatures live

They serve the Elder Elemental Eye. There are many other elemental princes across multiple elements, but they're not corrupted by the Eye's influence. The eye controls these four - they are all that it needs. **Last time, Ogrémoch never came through - he was defeated and banished back to the plane of eternal earth - so the other three came in and cause da lot of trouble, but with only 3 coming through, the Eye couldn't visit, the others weren't unified and not all was lost**.

Turlang says that this memory was from his earliest days; he has to search back a long, long way. Very few people today talk about it because very few people have any idea it ever happened.

The main thing is that the elements themselves aren't the real problem - it's the force that drives them out of balance. The Eye. It pits them against each other. Fire/Water, Air/Earth in particular. It spurs them to greater and more extreme acts, which unwittingly serves the Eye's greater goals.

Then Turlang has to *show* us something, asking us all to lie down and tells us not to be afraid. We lie down as requested, Aramais and Moonan included. The other Treants are called over. The ground shifts as their roots move around and all six of us start to sink into the loose earth. Micelial fronds and small fungi start to crawl over us, creating a latticework (DC13 saving throws made by everyone but Maireagh, who struggles but Nethza is allowed to calm her down due to rolling a 20).

Riglan starts to experience strange sensations - not visions, somehow; more glimpses of memories. That makes them immediately familiar to Riglan, because that's how his dreams often feel and the period he's seeing - their clothes and the "feel" - match many dreams he's had.

We all see it; lots of Drow, Drider (half-drown, half-spider) and giant spiders pouring out of fissures in the ground. **Strange prophets emerge too, leading battles in different areas** - the memories move around, jumping via relation of topic, not relation of time - **wielding very powerful holy weapons, levelling big sections of the battlefield. They seem to represent something more powerful and important than mere magic, in fact; opposing fighters sacrifice themselves in desperate attempts to rid the prophets of these weapons**.

We emerge back out of the ground. The sun is high in the sky, so we realise that a lot of time has passed - an hour at least. We thank Turlang - we will try to make use of these things we have seen, in whatever way we can.

He is tired and wants to feed in the sun. "**Maybe you will visit me again some time, or when the forest has need of you, you will respond to its call. When your quest is over, come back and see us, little Forest Giant, if you've found your place in the Enclave - we can talk more about what you have learned and I will hear what you want to do.**"

Riglan can't quite read between the lines there (insight 3+5) but will think on it more later and discuss it with the group and perhaps we'll figure it out together.

Before we leave, Moonan fusses with the other Treants to help them aid Turlang in looking after his new tree frogs!

We head back and find Lyrei and Anhearn. Later in the day, Orihorn finishes meditating and there's an agreement for how to get everyone back to the village, with extra supplies, seedlings, plants and animals to repopulate and help recovery. We all spend the day helping out with gathering, loading and so-on.

One more night of drumming! This time, the elves, spirits somewhat lifted and somewhat better rested, join in. Some will not return, preferring to go with Morgwai on her noble mission to reunite the elven tribes; she's agreed to also send assistance to the outpost to help with rebuilding if they join the alliance. We meet her, but only very briefly; she's very direct - neither particularly charismatic or friendly, but very regal - and focused on her mission to rebuild something with the elves. A close relationship with the Enclave arises from a new **fourth tenet that's being added as a new school of thought - world-altering great magics must be avoided at all costs to maintain balance**. Sounds like a good plan. It's encouraging to Riglan that this aligned Morgwai to that part of the Enclave.

"Once, when the High Forest was easily four times the size today, it was home to the elves. We had great elven cities built into - *grown* into these trees - indistinguishable from the forest itself at the height of our civilisation, the most glorious years of the elves. But it was not in balance. Power, magic, knowledge and ambition destroyed our civilisation like it does countless others and I want to rebuild this elven empire, but I don't want any of the corrupting influences to bring it down" - that's why it's about uniting elves to become one culture, without destroying anything; one culture, but this time retaining many points of view. A united alliance rather than a centrally ruled kingdom. She does not seek to rule herself.

## DAY 82

Everyone is gathered, Moonan and Aramasi included. The horses are laden, along with six elk too, so everyone is ready to leave. Aramais gives the elves some copies of his journals for their library. In the end, 3 of the elves went with Morgwai, about 17 remaining. There are four of us plus dog, and 5 Uthgardt barbarians from the Tribe of the Ghost Tree are coming to set up camp and help with defence until rebuilt. Morgwai will send half a dozen elven builders too.

Orihorn will lead the way, but once on the fey path, we walk it without him. He waves goodbye.

So, we follow the path. Riglan ends up front unexpectedly (Survival 17+8) and is surprised to recognise the path as - at least in the main - familiar after last time. We move quickly but it still takes around 6 hours. We don't bother to stop for a break, knowing the way and distance; we get to the village site around 2pm. The Uthgardt start setting up a perimeter already. It's a sad state for the elves as they pick through the remains, but they see more saved than they perhaps expected. The trees are resilient, with more surviving than expected.

As a priority, they start getting all the seedlings laid. Riglan eats heartily, in preparation for his spell. Eventually it's time to cast it. It's his favourite spell; it's exactly what he's about. To be able to directly help the ground repair itself is a truly amazing gift, and one he will always cherish.

The other elves and his other party members work on tidying and rebuilding.

Riglan's spell:

Hour 1: Easy
Hour 2, 3: Concentration check only 5+3, but DC was only 7
Hour 4: Nat 20+3 -> Hour 5 also
Hour 6,7: Nat 4! So uses his new cloak. He's getting distracted by the excitement to see the growth really kicking in now. It doesn't really "fire off" until the spell ends, but these grove plants seem to respond more.
Hour 8: Nat 7, sigh. So uses his cloak again! This is more because he's just tired.

The plants here have an undeniable signature from the grove, some plants even having a faint glow; they're large and lush, with new grass and soft green moss on the ground. The animals brought along take to them all immediately. Burned trees that still live have started to push out a new shoot or two - signs of life. Riglan knows that they should continue to grow at a good natural rate for another year, without much attendance. They'll also be good for food. After that, it'll be up to the elves to keep on top of nurturing things.

He's exhausted, but brought food. Riglan asks Maireagh to make some light drizzle rain down for a while, because it feels right - so he sits on the mossy grassy ground, eating his food, at 10-11pm at night, in drizzle - very, very happy. He realises there are some tree frogs here.

Some elves are going to mediate now; some of the Shadowtop aesthetic is here, with dwellings and walkways being lit via the lichen/moss lights we saw there and so-on.

Riglan drifts off to sleep. No dreams.

## DAY 83

We are entrusted with the Elemental Evil temple book for now, but asked to bring it back once done. We elect to make best speed back to Yartar, so wish the elves the best of luck, hope to visit them again and without wasting time on food head on our way.

As we're a distance away, Riglan takes a moment to thank Maireagh. The cloak was very useful. The dwarves helping the elves rebuild.

We reach the road in good time. It's got some activity but not too busy. It's actually quite windy and cold, autumn's grip clearly evident now, but dry. Looking back at the High Forest, Riglan realises he can see patches of it just starting to change colour now. Perception 11+8 - we pass a small caravan on the road after a while with about four wagons. They aren't carrying much; perhaps they're headed to try and sell what they have, though. Separate families it seems.

We get across the bridge and cut across country, like last time following the fey rabbit, to bypass Calling Horns for speed. We keep going and towards the last hour of our travel, we get the horses into a gallop (Riglan: Nat 20 animal handling); he realises we're close to the half way inn so push on a bit more. Maybe an hour away. However, there's a strange burnt smell (Perception 19+8). Riglan follows his nose; the wind blows from behind us, so we slow and he sees something that looks like smoke behind us, almost like a mirage on the road. It seems to be approaching. **Temo gasps. 3 hellhounds, with three handlers on horseback charging alongside them, headed in our direction. We think they may have been tracking us. They're about 200ft away**.

Riglan tells everyone to dismount and tells the horses to run clear off the road. We'll catch them later. Riglan, Temo and Nethza dismount easily enough, Maireagh takes a while longer, having to help the dog down too.

Initiative Riglan 8, Temo 18, Nethza 22, Maireagh 11. Once again, the low-rolling cow is last.

As they approach, one of the handlers raises a dagger and flames engulf it in what looks like some kind of magical armour. Nethza uses her equivalent and runs forward, cursing the fire guy. Riglan now recognises a fire priest and two eternal flame guardians - we've seen their kind before, at Scarlet Moon Hall.

A hellhound attacks Nethza using fire breath. 23 rolled, dex save made, halved to 11, halved via her fire resistance to 5. A guardian is running forward, lighting its flaming sword. It gets right up in front of Nethza too. Temo tries to hit the guy with a crossbow but fails badly (4+9). Maireagh gets close and tries Thorn Whip on the same guy. It pulls him close; the dog runs up and gets in one hit too.

Riglan brings down the bear totem and calls lightning, hitting two of the hellhounds and the fire priest, but only for 3d10->13 (at least all 3 fail their Dex 17 saves). One of those hounds runs up to flank Nethza but she evades its bite despite pack tactic advantage; the second guardian runs up and lights its sword as the final hellhound runs in and tries for Nethza yet again. This one hits (matching her AC) for 9 damage, but takes 10 damage itself from her armour.

Now the priest looks across at us and throws a fireball. Nethza counterspells! The angry priest runs forward to get a better look at what's going on. Nethza now acts again; she casts Spirit Shroud since she's surrounded by so many enemies. She pulls out the Lightbringer mace and swings at the hound in front of her. One good hit, for 14 (with 1d8 cold added by Spirit Shroud). The hound behind her then attacks but just misses; the guardian between her and Maireagh, having been caught by Maireagh's whip, attacks her back. He fortunately misses twice, thanks to armour.

Temo attacks the guardian near Nethza, getting a nat 20. Despite 10d6 (!!) rolled, he gets a very average roll and does 38 damage with +6 modifier. Meanwhile, Maireagh's attacking the guardian she's in melee with herself, hitting twice; the dog however can't get in a bite. Maireagh and the dog move closer to Nethza to protect her.

Riglan tries again with the lightning, but 3d10 only rolls 8. It's enough to get rid of the guardian that Temo hit, and one hellhound in range is hit again badly too but the other is ready for it. One hellhound now responds with a cone of fire, hitting Nethza, Maireagh and the dog - also one of the guardians, but it doesn't care.  Nethza saves, taking 18->9->4 damage (con save for spirit shroud, with advantage via War Caster - 1, then 20!). Maireagh likewise. The dog takes the full brunt; the guardian fails, taking 9 with resistance, and is almost taken out by it. Badly injured and very annoyed at the hellhound! The third hound perhaps saw this and attacks Nethza with bite but yet again, despite advantage, can't get past Nethza's 20 AC.

The priest, meanwhile, has seen Riglan - throwing five bolts of fire (scorching rays) at him. Miss, hit - 8 (con save), hit - 10 (con fail, use cloak), miss, miss. 18 damage, but the temp HP took a lot of it. Cloak to the rescue *again*. Best gift ever.

Netzha attacks the injured hound, crits (kind of a waste!) and takes it down. She turns to the next, hitting again for a decent 14 damage. The other one that's still up yet again can't get a hit. The injured remaining guardian sees that the kinda red-hot metal dog is looking damaged so attacks that to try and clear the field, doing 11 damage. Dog's a bit of a mess.

Temo uses his missile wand with two charges, but it is deflected by a shield. Well now we know he's got shield, but it'll have used his spells. Temo is unimpressed!

Maireagh takes down the remaining guardian and moves onto one of the hounds, dealing 11 damage to that as-yet uninjured hound. The dog comes around and tries to get in on the action but misses. Meanwhile, Riglan sees the mage stood out in the clear and, after being hit by the rays, throws lightning down. Very good roll this time, 25 damage and the mage fails the save.

The injured hellhound once again misses Nethza. The priest sees this and, unimpressed, throws a fireball down in the midst of Nethza, Maireagh and the dog. Oh crap. No counterspells left. The hellhounds are immune to fire. Fortunately, the roll is quite low - 8d6 for 21 only - Nethza's getting tired, can't dodge in time and takes 10; Maireagh same; the dog fails too, which is more serious; it's almost destroyed (4hp left only).

Netzha is over it, and risks attacks of opportunity from the hellhounds, running right up the mage. Overconfident from previous misses, both would in fact hit but the damaged dog saves the day in part by reacting to distract one of the two just before its bite connects. She gets injured but not as bad as it could be; keeps her shroud on; attacks the mage twice with her mace. He's got no shield ability left and both hit. This takes it down. Riglan shouts, "I don't suppose you want to grab its soul and see if it can tell us what the hell that was all about?!" - and she says, "Sure, why not!" - grabbing at the departing life force and capturing the soul. "Don't go yet, you're answering some questions..."

A hellhound takes down the dog. Temo attacks and hits it in response. Maireagh is infuriated and attacks the same one, swinging wildly on the first swipe but connecting on the second, taking it down. Riglan can't get the lighting down anywhere on the last hellhound that wouldn't hit his own party members, likewise an ice knife would put them at risk, so he tries frostbite but it doesn't seem to have an effect.

In a surprise move, the hellhound runs out and now tries to breathe fire at Temo. Temo shouts, "Yeah, evasion motherf*cker!" - the roll was crazy high, 6,6,6,6,4,4 (!) - but he has Evasion (recently, L7) *and* succeeded on his dex save, so gets no damage at all. Everyone - even the hellhound - looks amazed at this halfling rolling out of the way and back, standing back up in the same spot without a mark on him. Netzha swings in and takes down the remaining hellhound; job done.

Nethza has a pet soul now. It's been sent to hunt us by the fire cult; it was tracking the scent of the orb of destruction. Personal instructions from Vanifer - track it down and kill those who possess it. So it seems like they are unaware that it has been triggered. We realise we still have it - good thing we brought it with us! If we'd left it that'd be bad.

She releases the spectre. The orb is spent, so we elect to dump it in the river but realise that this flows towards Yartar. Burying is suggested, Temo saying we maybe bury all the bodies with the orb so it'll be a confusing thing if found. The hellhounds are ash, so there are three bodies. So, we drag them a fair distance away, dig graves, dump them in with the orb, Riglan later takes the wood case and burns that along with the hellhound ashes and we use the cleaning stone in case they *literally* meant "scent" of the orb, rather than a magical residue we can't do much about.

Temo searches the bodies before we dump them. The only the worthwhile thing is a small pouch with three small fire opals. Maireagh thinks they're actually worth maybe 100gp each. She's also been spending time with magic on the dog (she calls it repair!) and it's back working again - at least enough to walk with us.

By the time we catch up with the horses, we're already another half hour towards the inn anyway. Temo reveals a small coin purse found on one of the guardians that through happy twist of fate happens to have just enough money to pay for everything. The horses were hoping for more glowy food but unfortunately it's back to stables and hay these days.

Finally, we get to bed.

## DAY 84

We feel a fair bit better when waking up. We elect despite only light food last night to just get going and, as a result, get to the outskirts of Yartar in good time - around 5pm.

We say goodbye to them. Riglan says they were very brave and hope they enjoyed the forest (perhaps, in fact, they were a bit spoiled!). After 7 days, we get a fair bit back in deposit. Riglan worries that the horses may have tall tales to tell that the others don't believe, so he asks to go see the horses once stabled and makes a show of feeding each a little bit of glowing moss he had kept from Shadowtop as a goodbye, so the other horses know it's all real.

We get back to the Griffon and the owner insists that we pay per night, rolling, since we keep disappearing off! 2gp for our usual room which, surprisingly, remains free. It feels almost homely.

Riglan suggests re-feeding at The Boat then go to Halassa's. It's quite busy at The Boat, but there's a courtyard seat which we take. Riglan appreciates the cooler autumn air. We learn that some vegetables have come in, with a shipment having made it through - also, the Waterbaron opened the granaries. We focus on the fish, but eat well on a spread. We'll drink at Halassa's and there's a vegetable soup which means we're not drawing too hard on the town resources. 5gp. While we're all focused on food (very low perception rolls, all 3!), Maireagh (nat 17) draws our attention to nearby conversation. There's a new Dock Master and a new Ombudsperson. That's been helping things get back on track. But they're looking for adventurers, because the city guard can't be spared but the Waterbaron's Office is offering patrol rewards. The mood seems a bit more buoyant.

Funny - Riglan was thinking he'd head to Riverguard Keep next.

For now, all filed in back of mind; off to Halassa's. The market is surprisingly active as we cut across. Some stalls display beautiful lanterns - Riglan picks up conversation about a forthcoming Harvest Lantern Festival. He asks the others to hold on a moment and goes to a stall to ask about it. The Festival runs for a full week, starting in the 3rd week of autumn. About 12 days away. Most farmers will have harvested the majority of their crops and will be in town to celebrate and store the excess. The town will be very busy in that week.

Sigh. How much are the lanterns? A copper each for basic ones for kids. Ornate lanterns are 1-2sp each. A pack of ten for floating down the river costs between 2sp to 1gp. **Riglan asks for four ornate lanterns (he'll keep one for taking back to the tribe one day, the rest of the party gets to choose). He also buys a copper piece lantern for Carp**.

Halassa's, up the bar where we've been before. Nethza - lager; Riglan - fruit licquer mixed into a tall drink, layers of colour; Temo - Mirarbar Ale; Maireagh: Dwarven Brandy. Riglan raises a toast - "**To a village we didn't entirely save, but we partly did, and we totally helped rebuild it, and we definitely did a good thing.**" Maireagh remembers that we should return Llanowar's hummingbird pendant tomorrow.

Maireagh suggests refilling our booze tanks. 15gp refills the ale and 4 the brandy. Nethza didn't have light ale or later while we were on the water, so she gets 2 bottles of a bubbly cider as an alternative more travel-friendly thing for 1gp. By the time we've finished drinks & trade, it's just after 8pm.

It's a nice, clear night outside, if a bit chilly. We wander up the road towards Wallheim's. It's open! Riglan knocks politely then heads inside.

She got the note and after joking there was no money - reveals there was indeed the money we left. "People know better than to steal from me!"

She shows us a coiled, tan, braided whip made from the manticore tail. The spikes are woven in - looks pretty lethal. There's a handle with a wrapped leather grip. This is one for Nethza or Maireagh, who have proficiency in that kind of thing. The creation cost is 125gp, and we left 1 platinum before we departed Yartar before, so we owe 115gp. The wings are laid out for study, but not started yet; it's a workable project, so we offer to pay up front. Two options - each wing could be turned into a set of wingwear of sorts, for time-limited flight capabilities but that magic would fade over time. Both would be doable for around 150gp combined. Alternatively, they could be weaved into a single cloak, harnessing a different magical property; a protecting/abjuring kind of way; this magic would not fade, but attunement would be needed. Much harder to do so costs much more - 600gp. It's a lot, but the flight option mostly lets us descend and it's so specialised that we decide the cloak is the better option.

Conversation turns to barter. She'd give us 150gp for Elisar's metal Azer controlling emblem - but 500gp for the dangerous pipe held by Temo; mostly, for study. We're worried about what her intentions might be, but they mostly seem benign. She is after all quite powerful by herself anyway. She wants both as a set, so that she can defend herself with the emblem from anything accidentally conjured out of the pipe! Temo is in truth somewhat relieved to pass it on.

"I like those fire opals as well, though. If you give me one of those too, I'll give you a few of these things here" - she gestures at some tools that would augment his herbalism kit. She also offers a healer's kit. Easy "yes" to that; the deal is done.

We head back to the Griffon. It's 9ish. Riglan gets started with his new herbalism kit with some of the rare herbs he has collected. 2 hours today. He uses all of his 25gp eqiuv of rare herbs, mixing them up to let the gods decide on the outcome! Intelligence-based nature check, with proficiency added twice - herbalism and nature - Maireagh assisting, due to proficiency in nature. DC 10 for greater healing but it's a +11 already for Riglan, so he opts for the DC 15 mystery outcome! He rolls 11 + 11, so 22. Things are working well tonight - we'll finish up tomorrow. We're very impressed - Temo and Nethza were sat outside playing music, but on returning immediately open windows - it stinks...!

## DAY 85

The potion is settling and flecks of colour are starting to appear and disappear from time to time. Most unusual. Nethza's kind of fascinated by it. Outside, she notes that it's colder and cloudy.

Bright(ish) and early we put on smart, but cooler weather clothes and head to the Waterbaron's Hall. We head in an aroundabout way via the market since we think Temo will dive into the bakery, but surprisingly, he puffs out his chest and says, "Look at me, not going into Gateway Bakery!" (wisdom save 19-1). "Steel-willed Temo, they call me!" and he marches off past the building and over to the Hall, with us in tow.

We present our credentials on arrival and it's a bit early (not long after 8am, with her taking petitioners from 9) but she's there, and in fact is making some coffee. She offers us mastica, and we accept; very kind. We exchange information - a lot to process, but cautious optimism at least in understanding more about the threat and it's good to take a defensive posture at Yartar in view of this mysterious rising chaos.

We're given a requisition request. If we bring it to the guardhouse tower (Shield Tower) they'll provide us with a boat, sails and oars - we thank the Waterbaron and get out of her way.

Eskilindarar's is open - it seems they never sleep! - so we head in and ask about our previously ordered Scroll Of Fireball. It's ready! "Some of my best penmanship, I think, if I may say so myself...", he says. Yay. It is indeed particularly good penmanship - seems a shame to read it. We thank him - he notices Temo taking the scroll and looking excited. "Now, sir Wizard" - he says, knowing exactly how to get Temo's attention! - and shows him a beautiful scroll case, for 2gp. Riglan having initially eye-rolled at Temo being so easily led finds he wants one too! Riglan's is green, Temo's a deep black leather with a silver painted etching.

Now we head across towards the Morning Spire, looking for incense. We get a another few bricks.

Next, the Undertower. We head in ask if we can see the matron as we have something to return to a student. Persuasion 7+10 for Temo. Llanowar is on a break, apparently. Matron feels that they're always on some kind of break! So we head in and find Llanowar. It's a small common room with about 12 students in there. Llanowar sees us and calls out, running over enthusiastically. We greet with enthusiasm for show.

We bring him up to speed; the good news and the bad. After some back and forth, he shows us a tiny flame that he holds in his hand. It lasts a few seconds. He can also do four lights which he can move around. Cool! He eventually heads off to class, telling us we should catch up some time for coffee.

Nethza and Maireagh suggest we try our own coffee brew, so we go to get some beans and some kind of sieve.

Coffee shopping! We go to the cafe nearby that we've visited before. It has a tavern vibe, but coffee not alcohol. Strange combination. They sell stuff like beans in an adjacent unit to the main eating and drinking area. We get some beans, and thing that can be used to grind them up by hand and some filter muslin that we can reuse, along with a tall copper pot for brewing 4 cups. The kit is 5gp and the beans - 1lb does about 9 rounds of coffee (uuh, I mean mastica)  for 4 cups. 2gp. We have a cup each to drink while there so we are reminded of some idea what it is *meant* to taste like. 2sp total; student prices! A little weaker maybe too.

To the archives: We find Lanowin. We ask him what he's found. 

* Big gaps in knowledge and history; just not much written.
* He sent a message to colleagues via bird and got a reply just yesterday that helped.
* There probably really was a Drow settlement below the Sumber Hills, linked to other parts of the underdark. Cities of the underdark are all considered to typically be connected in some way or other.
* He's not discovered any entrances, the name, who lives there or who lived there in the past, but does have some information referring to the settlement so can at least confirm *something* is down there.
* It is most likely to be impossible to find because there's not enough information.

**So there is a very old Drow temple somewhere beneath the Sumber Hills, is not common knowledge with nothing written directly about it. It can be inferred from other references only, based on this archive or the archive Lanowin contacted. Finding it would be next to impossible**.

We take the few notes that there are and thank him, especially given the extra effort he went to.

He writes down names of a few other archives we could try, but it's hard to say for sure if any would have it. Candlekeep is the most obvious. Baldur's Gate has a decent library too. Lower down the list, the mixture of archives in Waterdeep. The last one would be the Silverymoon academy library, but it would be very hard to access that. Citadel Adbar's library could be particularly useful for the drow but, again, access is very difficult. Gauntlgrym, close to Luskan/Neverwinter, is getting copies of Adbar's books so that's possible too.

We return to the Griffon, and Riglan & Maireagh spend 3 hours on the potion while Temo reads but doesn't make headway (Intel., total 11). The potion ends up looking great (14+11). D6 to find out what it is - rolls 5. Maireagh starts an Identify ritual. We've made a Potion of Animal Friendship! Surprisingly appropriate, if morally slightly problematic.

Since it's getting late, we'll sort out the boat and head downriver in the morning rather than today. Thus, downtime.

Temo reads; 18+3, so 2 successes making up for his lack of headway previously. Riglan does less well (nat 1 - 1 => 0!). Nethza practices with her new whip. Maireagh tinkers, as ever.

Eventually, we head to bed.
