# Riglan: Part 12

## DAY 70

We're in the Delmond Ranch, in kind of a nightmare with assault on all sides. We awake at 7am. Nethza tells Riglan that we need longer to investigate. We need a cease fire.

We head out, waiting at the 250ft distance. After about 10 minutes, we see the company on the other side move forward.

"The Sarcaras clan asks for their champion back." - Riglan agrees and says, "We regret last night. We had to defend ourselves." "All clans have honour and pride; we do not control them. They are proud clan. Very powerful." Riglan says "Yes, I understand. And you did warn us." The chief asks, "Do you have answer? Do ranchers surrender?" 

We talk a while about the fire witches; that we don't know who to believe; that we intend to try and investigate. They agree to let us leave to investigate. They give us 3 days. Riglan asks if they wish to send anyone with us; they don't trust us that much! We have to bring back physical proof. "No Iceshield will travel with dwarves..." - Riglan laughs at that! - "...long is our rivalry." "I understand."

They say that they'll try to negotiate with the other tribe as we defeated their champion. But if more arrive, they might not have control. We'll have to do our best.

"Cease fire until the third sunrise."

We agree, and immediately head back to the ranch.

We've only got our two mules anyway. We get a crude map of the prior attack area. Only a half day; we get the mules, Riglan promises them pears if they run hard. The camp is distraught at the idea of us leaving, but Temo gets some good persuasion in. At 8:30am, we're ready to ride off. Riglan says, "I can only do this for three hours!" and turns into a riding hours. We gallop off, riding as fast as we can for as long as we can. We estimated distances of up to around 18 miles away for the furthest noted fire (North East). Directly North, about 15 miles, was another fire; North West, 15 miles, is the Nettlebee ranch and barrows there. We figure we'll head for the ranch and see if this undead story has any weight.

We reach the edge of the range land before midday, as Riglan's wild shape is wearing off. Riglan can smell old fires. Maybe half a mile to the house; via the spyglass, it looks intact. People are milling around outside and some sheep are being herded into a corral.

Riglan (perception nat 20+8) notices a number of fenced-in paddocks, lots of sheep, along with a few goats, chickens and ponies closer to the farmhouse itself. It's a mixture of brick and stone, 2 storeys. Thin smoke comes out of the chimney but that's not what he smells. Low rolling hills are around us, with a much larger hill maybe one mile to the east of the house. It's more prominent, with some rocky outcrops. Grass at the top is burned and there seem to be burned trees. We decide to head there first. Getting closer, we see that it's a barrow mound. There's an entrance to a barrow in the hillside facing to the South; we see it clearly on our arrival from the South-West.

There is burned grass and a circle of large, burned trees. They would've been old. Riglan is saddened. It feels cold as we approach, unnaturally so. Cold air flows out from somewhere. An earthen corridor can be seen, but in front of it is a large, heavy stone door that's been prised open somehow. We're not sure how. It doesn't seem to have been dragged open as the earth around its base is kind of undisturbed. It's monolith-like; a 15ft tall entranceway and maybe 15ft wide - a huge square stone slab that looks as if it must've been lifted and dropped somehow. There's light inside an a strong smell of ash. Looking inside, Riglan sees rows of lights along each side of the long earthen corridor.

Temo: History 18+3. He's read about this kind of thing - it's **Uthgardt barbarian** but the lights aren't right. They're continual flame spells. Uthgardts hate magic. We go deeper. The earthen and stone corridor heads in; a little curving here and there; Maireagh sees rough stone chiselling and thinks its a few hundred years old. The smell of ash gets strong; we keep walking. About 120ft in, we reach a chamber. Stone monoliths, 12-15ft high, stand lining the walls. All are carved and painted with tribal markings; Riglan sees a resemblance to a giant language, almost a prototype perhaps. It looks like some kind of story - a heroic epic, based on drawings. Apses are set into the three compass points after the corridor entrance. In the centre, on a stone plinth, is a broken and blackened skeleton. It someone has deliberately destroyed this tomb and tried to desecrate it. The burning looks recent - it's not hot but smells strongly of ash.

Temo investigates for anything "of interest" - investigation nat 20+9. Each apse/alcove has a carving, almost a picogram, depicting a different animal. To the West, a red tiger. North, an elk. East, blue bear. We surmise that these are the names of separate Uthgardt tribes - elk and red tiger at least, but Temo's never heard of blue bear. It looks like the altars used to have things that been burned or taken. Looks like this was a high ranking person buried here, they'd be buried with ancestral weapons and armour; there's none here.

Temperature drops further and frost starts to coat the chamber. The flames flicker and start to extinguish. A point of blue light appears over the middle, expanding into a faintly humanoid form. The bones there, as well as the antlers on the altar, stir then fly together. A pale human male stands before us, 8ft tall, darkly bearded, milky eyes burning blue in the middle, crowned in antlers, hench as fuck! In a strange northern tribal giant-ish accent: "I return from a warriors rest amongst the spirits to find my tomb burned and my bones desecrated. This must be paid in blood."

He looks at us: Wisdom saving throws. Everyone fails, Temo very badly, except Riglan (11+8). The voice says, "Hmm. I know the desecrators are not among you." - ah, it was ascertaining truth. Riglan looks to Temo, since this creature has insight into him, and asks Temo to explain. He gives a short version (we're trying to find those responsible!)

**He's Chief Javor.** He united the three tribes we see represented. He's been allowed to come here from Valhalla to avenge the desecration. Temo agrees - it's horrifying to him to see this done. "It will take a while for me to take my form, but I warn you that I sense the divinations, callings and dreams have been echoed out to the speakers of the tribes - they will be coming - the live ones, here. He urges us to hurry if we're going to right the wrongs. Yeah, no shit. He's taking the form of the vengeful spirit - the revenant. We see visions of the war bands riding this way. Not good. "You must find out who has burned this. I will be formed in a matter of hour and I will no longer be in control until vengeance is exacted". In short, once he forms, he can track the people who really did this. But he'll slaughter them.

**With that we head off with great urgency to the nearby farmhouse**.

As we approach, someone is leaving the farm. We ask to see the Nettlebee family if possible - it turns out he's one of them. We tell him there have been orc attacks, and Riglan was going on to explain more - but he talks over us. They've been attacked but not orcs; they've been attacked by the witches. "Much trouble! Much trouble indeed!" - they intended to send someone to the towns. We ask about the nearby barrow; they saw it was burning. Wigan found it and discovered - we ask permission to talk to him.

We are led into the farmhouse. We see three people in the kitchen; two more in the living area; then to an office. He knocks and waits a while. "Grandpa! Grandpa!". There's an answer and we are shown in. We thank him and go in.

(It's halfling-scale, the house so we have to crouch down). He tells us about how these witches burn things and brand their cattle. They've also desecrated the barrow nearby. He didn't see that but found it burning. He doesn't know where they come from; the mark is of the fire witches. He says Bertram his son was with him when they found the barrow. He offers to show us the branded cattle. He shows us his various cattle. It's a stylised flame with a scull and bone underneath; not something we recognise.

At the news about the barrow and approaching tribes, he insists everyone packs.  There are around 14 in the family in total. They're going to get to the road and head to town. They hurry. We do try to reassure them that we're going to try and help, but they don't hang around.

"The curse of the fire witch" is mentioned. We enquire. He says he has no time and must pack; Temo presses the issue (persuasion 15+10). A young boy - about 12 - Ignatious, his name! - tells us the story. They lived in the hills long ago and are evil, rising now and then, causing troubles, branding "cattle of good honest folk", etc.; just basically evil **invisible** witches. Very powerful. They must've come at night. A quarter of their sheep are branded! A girl, 19ish, packing sulkily, argues that it's nonsense. But then, she hates being on the farm entirely apparently. Temo asks Wigan which town he's going to; initially Beliard. And just like that they head off in carts and on horses.

Riglan has a yes/no kind of convo with the horses. We learn that it was the family itself that lit the fires and branded the horses that night. We run out, collect the mules, Nethza and Riglan run alongside and we give chase, catching up quite easily a little while later. We confront them about what we've been told. Riglan watches one of the young guys and the old guy together.

Riglan: Insight 17+5; the young guy is angry and confused. The old guy tries to discredit Riglan. Things get heated. Temo tries to persuade the old guy to stand down and help them (15+10 persuasion). Riglan observes (19+5). A few of the others do understand and see reason, but the old guy is unmoved. Bertrand moves in to guard his father. Temo tries now to implore others in the family to help. It doesn't get us anywhere. Riglan in desperation tries Detect Magic in case there's a residue; none of them are magical and there's not much in the way of magic belongings except for a bag held by the middle-age son Watson, Bertram's child, which looks like a bag of holding. Temo asks about it almost as a distraction / defuse thing; it's always been in the family. Nobody else seems surprised.

Straight-up wisdom check at this: Riglan, 19 + 5. The barrow creature will follow them to the end of the earth. Temo & Riglan have a faux discussion about abandoning this folly because we'll die with them. Temo manages to persuade them to at least not take trouble to Beliard; and Riglan, for the first time ever lies. He agrees to defend them. They turn around to the homestead; the whole thing is a total fucking train wreck. At one point the 19yo turns and rides away to Beliard; we let her go. Riglan asks if she'll be safe. Wigan ignores him.

The family returns, gets whatever they can to arm themselves and most go down to the cellar. They bring food etc. down. They are going to barricade themselves in. Wigan calls Bertrand; "Well, if we are defending, let's go and take the battle to this ghost". We agree to accompany them to the barrow. Bertrand goes to a library and gets a scroll. We enquire... "I was given this as a last resort to protect the farm" - he doesn't know what it is but was taught how to read it. We ask to take a look... Temo takes a look. It summons some kind of elemental (but arcana check is very low).

As we start to leave, Temo asks why they didn't bring this along when they packed earlier. He claims he was told it would protect the farm. We head up. Bertram claims that Watson discovered it. Riglan looks at Wigan to see his reaction - Wigan had claimed *he* discovered it. Bertram answered honestly, but was dodging the real question. Temo presses his question about who went up *before* the fire. Wigan gets angry but Temo tries again. Bertram insists that he didn't go up. Riglan realises he's lying. Watson went up; but Bertram went up first. We try to broach that topic, but Bertram doesn't budge. Wigan and he won't say a thing; we won't get any information from them.

We arrive at the barrow. The two halflings refuse to enter, so we go in while Bertram reads his spell. There's a conversation that doesn't help us. A moment later, the tunnel behind us collapses; an earth elemental has been cast and has destroyed the tunnel... And then the elemental emerges in the barrow!

(Riglan initiative 19+0, Temo 19+5). The elemental is not in melee range with our party; it's at the blocked part of the tunnel, about 30ft from Temo and 25ft from Maireagh and Riglan; Nethza is closest as she was at the end of the tunnel, 20ft away. Temo risks it - takes aim, fires. He can't hide or move away, but he figures we have to try and take it down ASAP. (Hits for 19 damage).

Riglan calls forth a fey spirit, going for a flying one, then brings down the bear totem. It flies out, tries to hit (sadly only 15), misses, comes back. Riglan backs away to try and avoid damage, so he can hold the spell. Nethza casts the hex blade's curse and moves in to try and block its advance, but first throws eldritch blasts. Crit+miss (21 damage). Maireagh runs forward and tries to dig in her feet, directly in front of it. Swings with the sword; two hits (20 damage). She calls up the dog and tells it to run near Temo and Riglan to defend us and activates Branding Smite on herself.

The elemental disappears into the ground and appears next to Temo. Tries to slam him, the dog trying to defend. Rolls 17 despite disadvantage, hitting. 19 damage. Uncanny dodge. It tries to slam again, which also hits. 15 damage. His turn again. He disengages, moves back towards Nethza and fires, hitting for 24. Riglan is in melee; he misty steps away, misses with a thrown flame, but the bird does get in a hit and gets max damage (8+7, 15).

Netzha flanks the elemental to flank to dog. Rolls arcana - nat 20! She pulls something from her amulet, wraps it around her flail and swings it (Booming Blade - trying to stop it vanishing into the earth again). She just hits (17) for 13 normal damage, 7 thunder damage which it's vulnerable to -> 14; and to our surprise, really, that destroys it outright. It crumbles to the ground as stones.

Maireagh runs up and heals Temo. Javor is now corporeal enough to start throwing rocks aside; he clears the tunnel. We can get through to outside. The halflings are gone, but 12 barbarians are there! 2 are mounted. One comes forward, with elk horns tattooed. She bows to Javor. "My daughter's visions were true. This one is the ancient one - he is one of us - he is our ancestor". She kneels and the others do too. "We come to see you avenged, ancient one!"

Javor nods and his face turns grim. "You are in time for blood - the desecrator dwells there!" - and levitates towards the house. The barbarians turn to us - "Who are you? Are you also worshippers?" - Javor tells them that we are allies; we are not to be harmed unless we get in the way. He gives us a questioning look. We ask if he can avoid killing the others, and he says we can do this only if we can give him the two that are responsible and restore the barrow.

"You are not in our visions. You are unknown! Why are you here?"

Temo gives them a very quick rundown of basically - we might need your help; something very odd is going on; might lead to war with the orcs. Javor has held the barbarians to a promise to only kill those who are not innocent; the rest are annoyed as they have bloodlust and want to raise everything.

Javor gets to the cellar and rips off the door. There is screaming below. He floats down; we follow; the barbarians don't really fit! We run in. The family is cowering. Bertram has his shortsword in a shaking hand. Watson, too. Javor points at Bertram and Wigan. "These two! Give them to me and I will spare the rest of you".

Temo gets there first. He says - "Watson! Did you pack your bag or did others put things in there?" - Watson says, "I did!" and empties it; just his stuff. Temo tries to implore Bertram and Wigan; "...all you can do now is try and save your family."

Wigan looks at us. "This is undead. You! You are a druid of nature. I will make it worth your while!" - tries to bribe Riglan. Riglan's ears are flat down on the side of his head and he's crying. And he sort of can't stop. He just says "this is awful. I can't do anything. I couldn't stop them if I wanted to, there are too many, we'd all die. I don't understand why you did what you did; I don't understand why you don't let us try and help".

At this, Bertram and Wigan's eyes blackened; they hold their palms forward, runes becoming visible on them, that match the branding. "I serve the Black Earth!" they shout. They attack Javor; Javor cuts both down with one swipe. He turns to us. "It is done". Riglan says, through tears, "yes, it is." - we are told, "Restore my barrow; or this ranch will be haunted by my spirit forever. Release me!".

Black Earth, then.

Temo tries to console the family, angry at Wigan and Bertram - "You saw their eyes; you saw the runes on them; they were not themselves". Watson reveals that they tried to make him go with them on a pilgrimage down south to a monastery, but Watson didn't go. Bertram's husband is distraught; she doesn't understand how she couldn't see it.

We agree that it's all awful; but we should search for the stolen items. Ignatious, the person who first met us at the ranch, says that "grandpa always spent a lot of time in his library..." - so we decide to start there. Riglan notices a chest in the room seems to have been moved in and out of a resting spot by a wall, as if moved often. Temo finds journals and letters; Temo uses Mage Hand to unlock the chest. He fails, despite an 18 - but Ignatious has a key...! So we unlock it with the key.

* An ornate leather, rope and bone helmet; sized for a large person. Elk horns, tiger jaw, bear scull.
* A massive greatsword - Maireagh recognises - it's of Besilmir make. The grip is marked with sequential notches; there are bear claws on the pommel; the mithril of the hilt and crossguard is intricately carved. There's a dark steel blade. Must be ancient; the leather grip looks to have been replaced several times.
* Four animal figurines; a bear, a tiger, an elk and a silver raven.
* Lots and lots of gold. We estimate hundreds of platinum, a few thousand gold, several thousand silver; gems; full.

I ask the family what's theirs; they aren't sure. The coins are modern day though. Riglan goes out and asks the barbarians if they'd accompany us back to the barrow to help us lay things down properly. We dig back inside and the barbarians try to re-form  the scattered bones into their proper place. They place the helmet on the chest area; cross its arms over the sword; wrap hides around them to cover it somewhat, as if a cloak. The lead barbarian takes off her own huge fur cloak underneath first, so his bones, as if he's wearing it.

We start using the cleaning stone to help, but they bristle at this; we apologise (they hate magic) and help clean by hand. The figurines go into the appropriate apses; the silver raven back on himself. At this Javor reappears in spirit form; he looks to everyone, "Daughter of Besilmir: May our long alliances hold strong forever. Young halfling: You are a guiding light for your kind. For each desecrator, may there be one of you to balance the darkness with light. (Riglan): It has been a long time since I've seen one of your kind, but we have worked together in centuries past. We have long memories, we Uthgardt. You may always call the elk, bear and tiger for aid to defend that which is of this world. (Nethza): Lady, pure of heart, you are brave and you are true; why are you so sad? I believe in the goodness in you. You showed it today. Do not be afraid of who you are." To the tribe, he starts a chant which they join; he dissolves away and the barrow temperature returns to normal.

The tribe turn to us. "Well, our paths shall cross again - " - and Riglan, almost interrupting, explains briefly the orc problem and asks for some help. Persuasion for Riglan is very low; 9-1; but they make no promises. They agree to travel to meet the orcs. Before we leave, Temo wants to investigate the journals and letters for a while. We head back to the farmhouse, where the family, afraid of the barbarians but aware they've been wronged, offer up their marked livestock as a peace offerings; the barbarians are surprised and agree. It basically pays off offences and debts on the sackings of the barrows locally.

Watson, now head of the family, agrees that they will have good access to the barrow and a closer relationship will exist. Riglan speaks to the ponies again to reassure them that they won't be hurt again and will be going with this strange new family.

Temo reads paperwork. Some of it in halfling... Wigan and Bertram were inducted a number of moons ago. Wigan had been to the monastery first, got inducted and was frustrated that Watson was slow to respond and didn't fall into line, but Bertram was lured in. They kept it a secret, but were trying to stir up trouble; "We have been informed by the **Mud Sorcerer** through great **Lady Helenray**, the Master Monk, that the Fire Cult was working through some orcs" - the plan was to instigate a war between the orcs and ranchers, to wipe each other out, and Wigan figured he'd get their land. He serves the cult by eliminating the "forces of fire" while paving his way to even more riches. It seems greed was the primary motivator that made him susceptible to the cult. We realise that the Mud Sorcerer's name is **Miraj Vizann** based on letters & handwriting. One letter says that the Temple of Black Earth may be under threat - the great prophet Unrayle, with his many eyes, has seen meddlers in the High Forest and instructed the hobbits to lure "them" into a trap at the range - bring proof of their demise and in return, they'll be permitted access down the Eternal Stair to enter the Temple of Black Earth. Maybe he means us?! It's a recent letter. Lure them with fires, mentioned; which is why they set all the barrows in fire. It was a trail to lead us here. The more we read the more we are sure they mean us.

**I guess this is all our fault** - we got embroiled at the earth cult monastery trying to find friends (and freeing slaves), have been watched since, the fires were to lure us in and were a way to also kick start this war of sorts between orcs and ranchers.

We might not show them the letters, but the journal we can certainly show them. The letters saying the suspect the fire cult is a question mark; do we reveal that?

The cults aren't just fighting each other; they're using other races as agents.

It's about 4pm. Fuck it - we go for it and decide to gallop out. Before we leave, Bertram's wife promises to make things right and run things honestly. Watson says he'll set the family back on the right track.

6 of the Beserkers go home with the animals. Four of the warriors and the two chiefs ride with us, weapons very much NOT drawn and we do say that we ought to lead and we should slow down when get to the orc lines.

A few hours later, we're approaching the ranch and orc encampments as the Wild Shape from Riglan fades. We slow down. As we get within sight, Riglan raises his hands to show that we're not fighting. We ride through to ranch. There's much excitement; we all come in and explain.

We make sure we take time to explain to people of importance - Delmond family leaders, the paladin etc. - what happened and who the barbarians are. We also explain to the barbarians what we hope to do with talking to the orcs (both the barbarian burial sites *and* orc sites were attacked; and that they witnessed the culprits being killed for the attack on their specific site).

We take the time for rest and food, everyone sharing with everyone else.

It's getting late, but we got attacked overnight last time from another clan. So the four of our party to start with head out to the mid point and wait to see if the orcs come to talk. Try to find same spot as last time - about 250ft out. Riglan: Perception nat 1 :-/ so we have trouble. It's too dark, between the dim torches of the ranch and the distant orc camp fires. Realising they probably can't see us either, we head back in to wait for morning and daylight.

We'll do the assisting on watch thing - Maireagh, Nethza, Temo, Riglan (with dog). No battles.

## DAY 71

First thing in the morning, maybe 8am?, we try again and ride out to the midway point. We wait to see if anyone comes, like last time. It took 10 minutes before, but after about 15 minutes there's nobody and Riglan sends a hawk with a note to try and search for the head orc. We realise the camp area where the orc had previously been is empty. Riglan: Perception only 5+8; we don't figure out much else except to note that the 25-30 orcs that were there before have now completely gone.

Riglan does his best to describe the clan markings to the hawk, and asks it now to circle and see if it can at least see the clan; then return and report. It does return; it did find them; we get an impression of direction, and after some faff and back-and-forth we head to the right place (back through the ranch, rather than risking circling around the outside; this causes some concern within the our camp) but eventually we get there and the hawk delivers the note.

This time, a larger group of 5 ride in towards us. We wait to greet them. They stop about 50ft away. Riglan tries to start with an opening to the conversation; but rolls only a 4+5 on insight. He's kind of excited and thinks this will be easy but realises quickly that things are by no means settled!

Temo comes forward with two letters; one connecting the two halflings to the monastery and one which is where the monastery talks about getting the orcs and ranchers to fight. Riglan doesn't help much (insight 8+5) but Temo is quite persuasive (15+10) but they are suspicious. We also talk about the barbarians, if the Orcs want to speak to them? At one point Maireagh thinks we're not getting anywhere, so Temo blows his horn to get the Uthgardt to come out. The Orcs bring six more warriors to match.

The two groups talk. They're speaking in some other language; another Common, I suppose; several minutes of back and forth happen. The tone seems to be getting more acrimonious, and suddenly Riglan has inspiration that he's been pursuing a specific outcome - his goals, not theres. Temo tries to step in and de-escalate a bit, focusing on finding out what it is that the orcs want at this point. What are their wants/demands.

The orc captain says, "What we want has not changed - we want the ranchers off our land, but we are not savages. We are willing to let these ranchers go." Riglan doesn't really have any choice with that; and says he'll try his best. The captain reveals that he doesn't really believe what we've presented, but doesn't want more fighting either.

So we head back to camp, thanking the Uthgardt who head off immediately. Difficult conversation ahead.

Riglan conveys the awkward outcome in the main house, to the head of the Delmond house and the paladin. We head outside to give them time to think about whatever it is they want to do. It's about 11am.

**Riglan realises that Deera never came back with his horse**. The hawk's nearly out of time, so he can't check with that. Riglan and Temo check on the two mules while Nethza and Maireagh "make themselves busy"... We wait.

At around midday, the house starts pushing out food; there's a change in the watch; a long table is brought out into the courtyard and food is laid out at it. As we see this, we head into the house and ask Delmond / Paladin what they decided to do. The Delmond family decision is that they can't defend it on their own, so if ranchers decide to leave, they're prepared to leave, but they can't decide the fate of the region for all. There'll be a town hall at lunch.

Not all families want to leave, so we have some convincing to do - Temo persuasion: 20+10, 6+10, 2+10, 6+10, 8+10. Unfortunately, since some do want to stay, the Delmonds say they'll stay. A family of ranch hands and two others. Four families in total stay.

Riglan: Insight 17+5; on the last two families, why on earth would they stay? Well, they have nothing left; their ranch was burned; all they have left is their land. The other family has had a bad run of luck with failed crops and owes money. They believe they can somehow get back to their ranch and claw out of debt - to the tune of 1000gp; they wish they'd given up the ranch to the loan sharks sooner, but just got in deeper.

Temo does try to convince them to maybe come to some arrangement with the Nettlebees, at least, those with no alternative. Persuasion 19+10. He is actually a farmer, after all. But still, these people are not in a good place, mentally; they'll come but feel super bad about it all.

We leave a note on the house for Deera. Maybe she'll find it. Some families head for the road, a few people with come with us heading towards the Nettlebees. At the Nettlebees, Temo & Riglan talk to Watson. They'll employ them, at least, so at least they've got something and maybe a roof in a barn for a while or whatever. Riglan takes the head of the family in debt off to one side, when nobody else is around, and hands over 250gp to get them started. Whether or not that'll really help, we'll never know.

We think we'll head to the forest. Headspace. Things are fucking grim here. But **the mules tell Riglan that they didn't like all the twisty trees and dense undergrowth, but do like the Nettlebee farm; so, we say goodbye to them, too**.

The usually boundlessly optimistic Riglan is, plainly, dejected. At least no more orcs or people died, but there was no justice on any side and the outcomes were pretty bad.

By the time everything is dealt with, it's about 8pm. We are told that we're welcome to stay in an outbuilding for the night, and do so. Temo and Maireagh spend some time looking back at the Earth Cult books, since they seem to still be featuring heavily in our lives - we find Unrayle writings condemning mines and farms that disturb the earth, perversions of primal state. Riglan could almost agree with that. But then, of course, they believe that the earth should consume all; everything should return to it; everything created must be destroyed and returned to the earth. Earth is the mightiest of all elements and must rule. 

## DAY 72

We need a pit stop. Or at least Riglan does. Yartar. The orb - and commerce.

In the morning, we bid our farewells letting them know that we're going to Yartar (if Deera is ever able to send word) and walk out immediately on the fastest route we can figure, cross-country. Riglan navigates. To get to Jundar's Pass: Survival 8+8. Easy enough. We can see the hills are wooded; hunting and foraging will be possible. Perception: 10+8. We find a fairly densely wooded area, suspecting underground streams and so forth yielding the more diverse and rich part of the hills. So we'll head in there.

We muse about the geology! Mining here because of there being many natural caverns and tunnels anyway; springs everywhere because of the redirection of springs and so-forth.

We get a fair way and eventually decide to camp; we want to go up to a hilltop for that for defence and a vantage point. The hilltop isn't bare; there are outcrops and scrub, the odd landslip, but also some trees. A few decades old maybe. We set up camp under a tree on the hilltop, where there's a break in the canopy. It's still quite dense, but we're able to set up a fire pit.

Riglan hunts a goat, leaving the head and hooves etc. behind but keeping the hide; we have a fair amount of spare meat. He finds berries etc. too and we cook.

Later, he uses the sending stone that goes to the orc leader - fire cult we think - telling them that the black earth were causing trouble. Message comes back, "you are fooling no-one; we know who you are; we are watching, you cannot hide from us; your day is coming soon." - Uh-huh. Riiiiiight.

Riglan climbs a tree that night. There's a slightly lighter glow in the direction where we figure Yartar might be, and if we did really well and push on, we could do it in a big day.

Watch is set up for the night. Decent rolls; uneventful.

## DAY 73

Early in the morning, Riglan encounters a small family of wolverines making their way back with quarry - someone had left a perfectly good goat head lying around... Riglan says hello. There's a brief chat. They head home.

We get up, go all fasted cardio about it and head in the direction Riglan saw. Maireagh eats some goat on the walk. Riglan joins in - a bit too distracted - survival 4+8, realises we need to fill up water and go down to a stream, then follow it a while but it's not quite in the right direction. A bit of a detour, then. We stop at around midday and Riglan looks for rare herbs - Perception 9+8. Finds 3d6 -> 7 herbs.

On we go. The detour means we're a bit late, plenty of food, nice in the hills so instead of going hard-out for Yartar seems less important suddenly. Riglan forages as he goes (only 5 more "units"/gp of rare herbs).

That night, we find a south-facing small cavern in the hillside and camp there. A bottle of wine is shared. Temo plays music - performance 17+7; Riglan joins in - performance, uuuh, less. Temo continues - 16(!)+7; Riglan - finally gets his ear in, first time in a long time; nat 20-1. Maireagh does light effects - "fireworks" of sorts - and Nethza borrows Temo's drum and joins in. We have a bit of the dwarven brandy too.

Eventually we head to bed and it's time for watch. Less good rolls! Too much alcohol before, perhaps...? Uneventful, fortunately, in any case. Riglan is very sleepy, but does meet an owl on its way home at the end of the night, with a rat that it has caught. They have chat. He asks it if all is well in the forest. It says things are strange in these hills; things are stirring. Hunting is good as rats are being driven out from underground but something is afoot. Things moving underground probably.

## DAY 74

Fortunately, there are bridges across the E-W running River Dessarin as we come to the Yartar outskirts, as well as a ferry. No need for walking on water spells! We head in, reaching the city wall by late morning. We'll stay at White Winged Griffon again, so head straight there.

Notes on things outstanding:

* Orb Of Destruction...
* Whatever happened to Deera?
* Did we stop the fire cult from emerging out of underground and if so for how long?
* Who really is at the other end of the orc's sending stone?
* Black Earth Cult - Unrayle's a medusa; back to the monastery & down the stairs? Speak to the good lich too? ***_Get mirrors_*** beforehand
* Emerald Enclave: Still haven't found anything / anyone in relation to that.
* What about the water cult at Riverguard Keep? Bad things on the river; maybe got books they shouldn't have.
* We found the city with the Feathergales inside, but never got in. What of that?

We sell a lot of jewellery at the Pearl Handed Pipe jewellers. Firelast's take - for the cloth, not as clothing items - the fine clothes and priest's gold vestments. Temo is uncomfortable with so much money - he prefers to give to the poor - so we go to Happy Hall, but spot an apothecary on the way. Riglan asks about his rare herbs from the Evermoors; useful as an anti-toxin (poison), or with a herbalism kit, brew potions, not healing potions - depends on the herbs really. Riglan buys 1gp of healing herbs so he can brew his own healing potion with the 24 others he already found.

We end up giving the two feathergale monk gold bangles and two beautiful rune stones we found in Helenray's quarters to Happy Hall. Temo gives 50gp too. Temo spins tales around how we got them; they are interested in items with stories and histories, where fate and chance were involved.

We also head to Lanthander's Morning Spire and donate the Thurl's cloak there; it's in keeping with their aesthetic and will be put to a more positive use. Temo asks about the vial from Wave Echo Cave with the scull ashes in - can they release the soul of spirit? They say they can. So we go on a procession up the spire. On the way, the person in the lead wears the ex-Thurl cloak. It fits with their colours; looks surprisingly well placed here. At the top of the spire, a brazier is lit (it always burns); they consecrate the ashes and pour them into the brazier. If there had been anything trapped, it's now released. They return the vial, filled with holy water - funny, that's how it started out. We're also able to pick up some healing potions here, having used a fair few "in the field" - everyone ends up with two regular potions, just regular ones, except Riglan who'll brew his second potion tonight with the extra herbs he purchased, to add to an older one that he still carries.

We quickly head to the smokers and drop off the goat for smoking, picking up various supplementary cured meats at the same time.

It's quite late for lunch - 2:30pm - bakery shut, so we go to One Foot In The Boat for lunch and to start listening for any clues. Then we "do the rounds" - Temo and Maireagh asking questions and investigating actively, while the more recognisable Nethza and Riglan just try and keep their ears open (a bit more "skulky"). We meet at Halassa's upstairs bar around 6:30pm.

24gp (10+10, 4+4 for middle-tier - Riglan - & underbelly - Temo - investigations). Temo investigation (lower class areas like the Coin Toss, Festhall etc.) 18+9 - gets 3 contacts. D100 -> 33, so no complications. We don't get direct info about the orb, but find out:

* **The Grand Dame schedules and parties have changed; parties have become more lavish and one night, it didn't go out at all.**
* **Open clashes are occurring between the two main Yartar gangs; someone innocent got killed on the streets as "collateral damage". The city guard are now far less tolerant of gang turf wars since they've spilled out, so the Waterbaron has had to act.**
* **There has been dissent / dissatisfaction amongst the market and dock workers, as some of the larger syndicates that handle payments have stopped paying out - the bursar has gone missing - and people aren't sure if they should even turn up; don't do so and risk being fired, do so and risk not being paid. They think that someone is moving against someone else, but don't know who.**

Riglan: Perception 19+8. D100 -> 35, no complications. So they also get 3 pieces of information:

* **There's a new "player" in town, someone very wealthy. They've been spending a lot of money. Rose to prominence during a recent fine art auction held on the Grand Dame, where they allegedly spent something like 20,000 gold (!) at the one auction. A "VVIP" at the Grand Dame now; the owner of the Dame (Lord Khaspere Drylund) has prepaid a suite at the Pearl-Handled Pipe to keep this person happy and encourage them to stick around at Yartar. The person moves around town in a covered carriage carried by hand, with curtains, mostly moving around only at night and they wear a wide hat and mask - costume-y - at night, so they're somewhat anonymous.**
* **The owner of the Grand Dame (Lord Khaspere Drylund) is making moves on the Waterbaron of Yartar's position, by accusing her of being unable to solve the crime / gang problems of Yartar.**
* **Wealthy families in Yartar are trying to get bylaws implemented to control prices because they see big price fluctuations arising from food supply problems - it's not getting into Yartar. Current bylaws set prices by the market and its bursars, but with a food shortage, they're trying to undo that so they can bid higher and outbid common people. **

By about 6:45 we're all at Halassa's comparing notes. Possible suspicions:

* A lot of food comes in from the south via Goldenfields. Hijacked by water cult probably.
* VVIP probably has something to do with the Orb.
* Grand Dame owner probably in league with gangs as a power grab over Waterbaron; impossible to know if that's connected to anything else.

We get to Wallheim's to see if the manticore tail and wings are of any interest. It's nearly 7 and the light is on but sign still says "closed"; we knock politely. We hear someone walking around and see someone at the window - Riglan waves. We're recognised and the door is opened and we're invited in. There's a catch-up chat, then we ask if she has any idea what could be made from the manticore wings and tail. The wings could be turned into a cloak that might have emergent magical properties, but either way might offer some resistance to damage. The tail becomes a magical whip, which would be quite dangerous. Nethza is interested in that; Temo or Riglan might find the cloak useful. We ask for the whip to be worked upon first. That'll take up to around 10 days, but check back in 5 and see how it's going.

We return to the Griffon for food, then back to our rooms to spend a bit more time studying the various letters and journals to see if we can at least sort of categorise some of them. Nethza suggests tomorrow asking for help at the Archive from sages there. Temo suggests a stay at the Pipe, as a way to be there so he can skulk into the rooms of the "VVIP" and see if we can find out anything about the person or the missing orb. While Riglan is keen to try and solve the river and food issue, Maireagh and Nethza both remind him to keep focused while in town (and that last time we were there, we didn't really know what to do and anyway, he said himself we really ought to try and stop killing everyone everywhere we go).

On the books front: Investigation check rolls all round as we Divide And Conquer. Temo: 1, then 2 (waaah) + 9 -> 11, Riglan 16 - 1 -> 15, Nethza 11 + 1 -> 12, Maireagh 7+8 -> 15. So Temo doesn't make much headway on the Nettlebee journal and Nethza makes little headway on cult books; both of them just find things we already know. Maireagh was looking into Besilmir texts and it seems that **Unrayle believes he has found the original entrance gatehouse and keep that's the doorway to Tyr Besil**. The city itself looks like it was abandoned. He claims to have cleared it out of giant spiders and other "foul creatures usually found in subterranean areas"; also **subjugated a small clan of Svirnefblin (deep Gnomes)**. Nethza bristles at that! Riglan focused on Elvish texts, since he can read them. He found an account about banned elemental cults from an elvish perspective; refers to their Dark Brethren, who "tend to the Fane" (Insight: 18 + 5), figures that it's the same Fane referred to in Unrayle's journal where he claimed to have discovered a "path to the Fane". But this elven text most likely refers to Drow; not Dwarves. The Drow are said to have been corrupted by the Fane's influence, and foul as they are they've become even worse; worshipping evil elemental princes who are exerting influence from their respective elemental planes and bringing their feuds into our plane of existence. Remember, this is an old text. It talks of the Drow being defeated - their plans to bring the prince masters to our plane were thwarted. They did this throught the might of the "old alliances" (Dwarves, Elves etc. presumably), because elementals were actually also working together (sort of) - serving the **Elemental Eye**. **We date this account to around 6,000 years ago**! Well before Tyr Besil.

## DAY 75

* Mirrors
* Room at Pearl
* Market trader conversations to find out more about the missing bursar etc.
* Find schedule for the Grand Dame
* Consult with Sages at the Archive

Temo insists on the bakery for breakfast. There's the usual queue. Temo, wisdom saving: 13-1 (DC was 13, argh) so he buys way too much - 5gp of baked goods! There's even a large cherry pie - we start on that as a weird breakfast. We sit by the market eating. Riglan: Perception 15+8. He notices there are fewer stalls than last time we were here. Everyone coming to buy things seem more stressed. At one stall, a minor disagreement breaks out - someone "always" buys two pumpkins, but can't have those today because there aren't enough to around and the stall holder is basically rationing it. Temo overhears this too and as the woman is leaving, he intercepts her and makes up some story about having over-bought and not being able to eat it all, does she need anything? Doing him a favour really - etc. etc., but she won't be persuaded (she has enough flour etc., needs veggies). She at least takes a croissant.

* **Barley, Rye, raw Wheat are short - most is imported; the trading costers buy all local produce as they pay better and export it, leaving the town to rely on imports!**
* **Fruit and vegetables are acutely affected.**
* **Dock issues - dock workers not being paid. Riglan pipes up and joins the conversation - "What does it pay to work at the docks?" - depends on being independent, or in the dockworkers guild - 2sp a day**.

Mirrors! We head to Lion Shield Trading Coster and show them the card. "Multipass". We explain the unusual requirements and they suggest steel mirrors. Discount for us with the pass, so we pay 18gp for four.

Now we head to the Pearl and try to book a suite or something, but realising we don't know the Grand Dame's schedule, we chat to the friendly doorman about it. Apparently it's a normal sailing tonight, but then Gala Of The Goose tomorrow night. Talk of the town! Some grand event. We don't know what. People coming into town for it. We head in, thinking we'll for book for two nights then. After some discussion we tip the doorman 5sp (!) because "us working class types need to stick together" and he takes us up to the front desk.

2 x individual rooms: 10gp ea per night. Family room 25gp per night. Suite 100gp per night. Middle one sounds about right. So go for that for two nights - 50gp. The concierge offers to procure tickets for the gala (!) so, well, sure. We get 4 keys. Turns out they want half of the 10gp each ticket price in advance for the gala; so we give 20gp too. The room faces away from the market into a courtyard area so it's quieter. It's maybe 3 times the size of the room at the Griffon. Later the bellhop comes back with a "welcome pack"; Nethza uses the opportunity to slip him an electrum piece and ask in hushed / awed terms about whether Khaspere Drylund will be bringing his honoured guest along, etc. - socialising questions - they leave the room late, midday, not returning until the middle of the night. They get quite loud at night.

Next on the list - sages at the Grand Archives, over at the castle. Riglan and Nethza haven't seen it before. Temo and Maireagh have been there, so they ask to speak to sages for assistance. We're trying to piece all this stuff together - from the journals etc - but our skills are a little lacking. Can they teach us do better, or help directly? Turns out they have a researcher free who can use their own archives and our own material to give that a go. We agree, pay a salary fee and leave behind appropriate journals and letters. It's 5gp per day and they'll take a couple of days over it. **The researcher is Lanowin**. He's a regional history specialist. We  thank him and head back out.

We figure it's early and we'll try and chance our luck at the Waterbaron's Hall to petition for an audience. Thanks to Old Owlbear Keep, we actually get a faster queue to try and gain the audience; we're in Knights And Estates (!) because we're *technically* vassals and indeed are paying for the restoration. The other much longer queue is peasants. It feels weird - we're acting like Lords and we're staying the Pearl. Hmm. Temo is uncomfortable but we understand the bigger picture.

Eventually it's our turn and we're asked why we're there. It's difficult to express what we want in a way that really works for their bureaucratic process. We'll come back at 4pm ish to see if anything's happening. Before leaving, Nethza puts 10gp down and tries to address different motivations (!) and the person there is persuaded to write a more convincing petition.

**The idea of going to see a show is raised; we're overdue some downtime** and the rather depressed mood in town isn't quite what we had in mind when we came back here. There's a small community theatre hall South of the market, close to the city walls. An afternoon matinée isn't far off starting, so we pay for tickets (1sp ea) and follow the queue in. It turns out to be a comedy / music affair; almost a variety show, but someone's tried to write some kind of plot arc to tie things together. Comedy is a mixture of slapstick, other parts witty dialogue or poking fun at current events and rich people / public figures - feels like different writers for different parts. We buy some toasted nuts in little paper cups (1cp ea). All in all it's decent. Temo and Riglan are interested most in the musicians, Nethza was impressed by sword juggling and a battle scene. Maireagh liked some technical aspects, such as a shadow puppetry affair behind foreground performers enacting part of a battle, which made it look like there were many more people fighting behind.

We head outside and it seems very bright outdoors. **Riglan and Temo feel quite inspired by what they saw**. It's nearly 4pm, so we head back the Waterbaron's hall. We find that 10gp buys (!) us an approved petition. Late morning tomorrow is available so we book in.

We return to the Pipe and remember to pick up the gala tickets. They're embossed, "Gala Of The Goose, 1490". Dress code is mentioned. Everyone's OK except Riglan... We're told Firelast's should be able to help at short notice. As we leave, Riglan notices (perception 20!+8) and leans into the the concierge; they're here to collect "Lord Quori's tickets" - from context and response we realise that this is the VVIP. It's a very well dressed young human male in a close fitting kind of suit, gloves, masquerade mask hung around his neck, with unusual long slicked back hair tied back. He carries a couple of shoulder bags. They also mention 2 tickets for his security. Says he'll deliver it "right now".

At this, Riglan calls a fey spider and brings it onto a shoulder bag. He nonchalantly follows, asking Temo to accompany him as Riglan says he's having a bit of trouble walking from "too much wine". We know we're on the same floor. As we get near our room, we're close enough for jumping in and out of range with the spider. The guy knocks on a door at the opposite end of the hall we're on - at our end there are two doors, left and right; at the other end, just one door - presumably a particularly large suite. We go into our room and fortune favours us - it's close enough, in the corner, to keep an eye through the spider.

There are some of the retinue inside, and two larger guards with weapons. The spider can't see Quori - the fussing members of his retinue are in the way. The guy hands tickets to the guards and walks into a bedroom. It's too far to walk in there and the spider can only see fuzzily at that distance. Riglan can hear what he's saying; a higher pitched, somewhat supercilious sounding person, spoken to as if he's quite old or frail / forgetful. We hear that he's probably going to go - "I'm bored - might as well go - **keep up the pretences I think**" - he's going to have a bath and then head out, but his guards "have the night off", rest of the people going. Sounds like the guards, at least, will remain in the room.

We eventually head back, Riglan telling the others that he's "feeling better now, should maybe just get some food" and we head outside, so Riglan and Temo can tell the others what happened. We decide to go straight to Firelast's as it's nearly closing time. We explain the situation, apologising for the late notice - equally swift for us, really. In keeping with the autumn/winter theme, but not too hot since Riglan has light fur anyway. They say they can have it ready by tomorrow afternoon.

On a whim we go to Eskilindrar's and ask about fireball scrolls. He can have one drawn up. We pay & head out.

Winter Winds for food. We end up on a table for four rather than a big communal table (there's a large dining hall and it's busy). Fish of the day all round, with a vegetable broth they have in lieu of full vegetables given all the shortages. There's also some oat bread.

On the plan to search the room:

* Temo to be invisible and flying
* Nethza, Maireagh, Riglan in the room, Temo flying around from balcony to balcony
* Use mage hand to open catch on bedroom window
* Blow horn if Riglan is to knock on door to distract guards somehow
* He decides that he'll disguise as the magistrate at Deepgarden & claim that he's heard some distressing noises from downstairs and is terribly worried, wonders if they heard anything too, they seem very strong, perhaps they could come with him and have look?

We go back to our room and Riglan calls the spider nearby and sends it along the corridor and under the door of Quori's room. It sees two people, but can't tell much else. On request, it stealthily crawls under the bedroom door (out of range) to look for people; comes back out and says there's nobody in there. Riglan thanks and dismisses the spider.

It's on! Time for Temo to be made invisible and fly out of our balcony. He heads out!

Intelligence 16+3, finds the window easily. At the window, he realises he can't use Mage Hand as casting it would give him away - verbal/somatic. So he tries to slide open the inner catch using his thieves tools (sleight of hand): 8+11. He opens the window quietly, gets inside and pulls it closed (but unlatched) behind him (Stealth 11+11). He's in. Goggles on. Perception, only 7+2. There is at least a writing desk to look at; it has various letters and journals piled up, but not open (he'd have to rifle through it). No books. Topmost journal is opened; a ledger; most recent dates are today. Numbers but no descriptions. Looks for more things, perception 6+2 :-/ - just doesn't want to touch things.

Change focus. Check chest for traps. Perception 9+2 FFS. Tries to unlock. SOH 17+11 - it's not even locked. Open and look inside. More of a trunk. Top layer, clothing; silks, satins, that kind of thing. Investigation 9+9. Two masks, small jewellery box, satchel containing various art objects, some potions in a beautiful potion case; doesn't recognise either, greyscale vision via goggles anyway, beautiful bejewelled dagger, encrusted with rubies - nothing resembling an orb really. It's quite a full trunk, but costume style clothing. It's not practical. Very near the bottom, a pair of worn boots and a thin leather tunic that look more like traveller's clothes. Returning items: Intelligence-based stealth (4+9), awful roll, puts them back as best he can.

Time to leave; out the window, thieves tools to hook latch back. Stealth 7+11. Goes to ground as he's not sure how long Fly will still last. Now he needs to sneak back in while invisible; stealth 19+11. Blows horn outside room door for Maireagh so she opens it, he comes in, closes the door and casts Mage Hand to make himself visible for fun.

After some discussion, he agrees to try again, investigating specifically the desk this time. SOH - 2 (!!) + 11, he's nervous!, takes a full minute, stealth to sneak in, 5 + 11.

Careful investigation on the desk - stealth 20 (where was that earlier!) + 11, investigation 10 + 9 (hmm). Letters referring to Quori, no other name. Instructions - e.g. one letter talks about "making it believable, stick around for a few more days, Lord Drylund will cover the expenses" - that fits in with "Keep up pretences" from what he said earlier - there are all sorts of bits of information for things in the past. Talks about "the transfer", "remember, do not open the box whatever you do - leave it closed and hand it over and then your job is done; we will deposit the funds to your family home, as we promised we'd look after them and we'll keep our word". "We understand you are concerned. Don't worry. It's nothing for you to concern yourself about. The box will be out of your hands soon and on its way to its target. You can rest with a clear conscience." They're all signed off with a stamp that looks like an octopus or similar. Puts things back - 10+9 - and checks the numbers journal again. Intelligence 15+3, a tally perhaps of expenses. Sees an item "10,000" and date of 9 days ago. He notes that even minor expenses are noted, for small amounts, which keys into the suspicion that perhaps Quori is actually quite poor in reality. Temo does realise he hasn't found any gold in the room. So where are his funds? On his person? He looks for discarded letters - some stuff is crumpled on the ground - investigation 18+9. He finds a couple of crumpled up notes of interest. One has a location & time in the past with a note saying, "Make sure you're not followed" and it's noted at the top, 'Final transfer", date's about 3 days ago. Another has a note saying, "This is the final payment for your services and this is your final allowance now that the job is done, but await instructions from Lord Drylund who may want you to stick around a bit longer." From other dates on the final transfer etc., Temo deduces that the orb was purchased by this group 9 days ago and handed to someone, perhaps Drylund, 3 days ago.

It's time to go. Stealth on the window: 5+11. Bit rushed. Closes it, latches it (SOH 7+11), has just about enough time to fly back this time and lands on the other balcony. He relays his findings and his inferences / guesswork.

Temo: DM asks for Wisdom Saving 7 - 1. Temo almost feels responsible for Quori now, and wants to help somehow. But what does "help" look like?

Maireagh asks why Lord Drylund is attached to any of this when the auction was held on his ship. If he wanted it, why go through a proxy? She's suggesting that it's less likely to have been handed to him, then, but instead, someone else. Drylund is perhaps just providing venue and cover, presumably for a price!

* Why more than one mask in the chest? No idea.
* Is Quori a title like job, or this person's name? No idea.

Just before we go to bed, there's a knock on the door. Someone is there with a trolley - "a pre-bed turn down for you?" - they fold the sheets back and leave a small tray of tea.

Riglan gets his healing potion brewing before bed.

We sleep. The beds are *very* comfortable. 

## DAY 76

In the morning, Riglan has a dream, the first for a long time. He only remembers tiny bits (wisdom saving 1, sigh, + 8). 

* A great hall, walls made of megafauna hides and a structure of bones. A large hearth in the middle with a fire, people standing around. A figure is stood at the end on a bone, wood and fur throne.
* He is talking to **Javor** (!) - still a chieftan. "Ah, yes, I was hoping to speak to you!" and other people gather around; Javor introduces Riglan to them - they are also chieftans - we walk out into a huge snowy plain with aurora skies, but no snow or storm, it's clear with stars. There are spirits of giant elk, polar bear, brown bear - large fey animal spirits - wandering around. "**Ah, I'm glad you could join me here, even briefly, in Valhalla**".
* Around 30 huge elk with barbarians riding them, blowing horns as they ride across nearby plains as if heading into glorious battle, go past.
* Stood on an iceberg next to a river, almost losing balance. Javor is still there & steadies him. "Walk with me, Firbolg". As we walk Javor introduces Riglan to the spirit animals that are walking with them.
* "**Thank you for your assistance. I was called back to the world because of the desecration; I'm glad to be back in Valhalla with my ancestors, descendants and peers. You are wrapped up in something - something big and ancient. It is something that is part of the cycle, but while some cycles are natural and meant to be, others are outside of the natural order. Evil cycles, looking for points of weakness. You are a warrior of the natural order, as are we... You and your family, when you need us, we will be there. I bestow upon you blessings. These are charms of the spirit world. *****Receive our blessings for your family*****.**"
* The giant spirit animals then kind of ride *through* Riglan and he feels - something - but then does not remember any  more. He wakes up.

In practice - **each party member has a spirit animal charm**:

* Maireagh: Polar bear - vitality. Using the charm acts like a Potion Of Vitality.
* Nethza: Snow leopard - heroism. Gains 10 temp HP for one hour and has effects of a bless spell, without needing concentration.
* Temo: Arctic fox - cunning. Advantage on saving throws against ALL spells and magical effects for one hour.
* Riglan: Animal world - **three** charges. One "Conjure Animals" each at L3, bringing forth spirit versions of the animals from Valhalla. Riglan will have greater control over the animal that arrives, as he's calling for them specifically.

First thing, we head to the archives for a couple of hours ish to try and research "Quori". Temo is onto it from the start (investigation 15+9). He figures we can split into two groups taking a section each. We figure it might be job title perhaps, so that's Languages. Perhaps it's a species or race title instead? That's Cultures. Temo & Riglan into Languages, Nethza & Maireagh into Cultures. Temo: Adv. investigation 7 and 6 + 9, so only 16. We find two books that might be related, where dictionaries for 2 languages have Quori in. Maireagh gets 10 and 19 +8, so 27 - very high. They come back with 2 books that might have a link, but they need someone who can speak / translate Elvish. They think they found references.

Riglan helps Temo look at the books Nethza & Maireagh found. On one book: Temo history 8+3, Riglan 4-1. Next one, Temo Arcana 16+3, Riglan 10-1 - better. We see in this second book information about another plane; Quori in that book is a manifestation of imbued magic, that has taken on a physical form; combined with the dictionaries, **we *****think***** that perhaps Quori is a race or a creature name, at least, for these other-planar beings that are manifestations of magic on their plane**. The history book is more difficult (well, lower rolls!). The word here is Q'ori, similar but not identical; but the dictionary translates this to a few variants, including Quori. A corruption of very old elven, no longer used above ground but perhaps still alive in the Undercommon - drow. **The "outcast and rejected" - bloodlines, or clans and families thrown out of Underdark society**.

We leave this kicking around in the back of our minds as it's time for the Waterbaron. As we leave, Temo pulls out some of his leftover pastries from Maireagh's bag.

It's the "late morning" session, which we learn is from 10:30-12. We show our stamped petition from the previous day and get led to a tiled waiting room on the 3rd floor. Four other groups are present. Eventually it's our turn, and we are introduced to the Waterbaron - **Nestra Ruthiol**. She's a late 50s human, salt & pepper longish hair pulled back and held in place with bone and jade combs. She (we notice later) wears a Lord's Alliance pin. We are given chairs and sit.

The conversation is affable and we get into some details, but no revelations; she's on top of everything. Riglan insight 17+5. She's very professional and guarded, revealing nothing much. Questions are asked by her because she wants answers, not just for smalltalk. On the issue of Lord Drylund - nothing is a surprise and there's nothing actionable right now. On Riverguard Keep - it's beyond her range / manpower and she's concerned by the impact on the city. If we were going to head there and do something concrete about it, that would be interesting. On the missing bursar - Riglan insight 19 (yay) + 5 - she uses a phrase which gives away to Riglan that the bursar is actually dead - "...the last thing I need is another faction on my streets". She doesn't want an all-out war developing in Yartar; it'd just cause suffering. She's clearly fully aware of the various factions in Yartar, but isn't shutting them down; we wonder who they are exactly? These gangs, who are they? Who are the power players? Temo is cheeky - and a rogue anyway - so he asks, politely, who are they? Who should we "avoid" (cough)? Persuasion 20 (yay!) + 10:

* **The Black Hand (Zhentarim) with their flying snakes**
* **Lord Drylund's group - hard to say who-where-what - it pays to ask around (she's very guarded here; "you never know who's listening"**
* **The Hand (not Black Hand) Of Yartar - an all-female thieve's guild; "I don't mess with them because I see them as a necessary part of the machine - this is my weak spot and how I can be taken out of power by those who would wield that information against me"**

Riglan pipes up on the last point, "presumably as a matter of balance"? - "As a matter of pragmatism. I don't believe that unless you have great military might or a police state, you can't control and surveil everything; so having a group with their own motivations to keep the city running, because a thriving city is important to them too, is useful. But I'm here to keep them in check; skimming off the top is one thing, robbing someone blind or killing anyone is something else entirely" (she refers to the recent death which we learn was between the Hand and Zhentarim).

She's certainly concerned about a possible magic item of great power! "Well, if you ware happy to pledge your assistance..." - **she gives us a coin roughly shaped like a letter H - a metal emblem - with the Waterbaron's crest on it**. "Don't abuse this! But if you need to have another audience we can meet outside of council-appointed times as Feudal Lord and Vassal. Just come straight in and look for my registrar." It'll be out-of-hours but hopefully at least on the same day! Maireagh looks after it.

We say our polite farewells and head out - straight back to the archives, to see if we can get any more insight into Quori. A line of research is chosen - D20 rolled, <= 10 is our less favoured option about the magic creatures, >= 11 is the drow line. Rolled 1! So we follow information from book to book on the magic side. Of the various investigation rolls, Maireagh not so good (blind alley), Nethza got somewhere, Temo 15+9, Riglan also bit of a blind alley (13-1). Temo & Nethza discover that Quori are tied to a particular wasteland on a particular plane. Then kind of magic that they are only exists on that plane. They're born / created there, but not elsewhere; so something happened there that resulted in the Quori - in fact it's another entire world, as far as we can tell, on the prime material plane.

Another hour of research - Riglan 14-1, Maireagh not so good either (total 12), Nethza a little off too (total 14). Temo though does well (19!+9). He finds a book suggesting that planar travel from that world to ours has been known to happen; it lists a few ways and one or two instances of apparent proof. Flying ships, specific races, but none of those races listed are Quori; another reference speculated that Quori are intricately tied to the plane they're created on so they can't travel.

This leaves us with Drow, or the whole thing is a red herring. Can Drow ever become "un-disgraced"? **Temo and Nethza both get nat 20s on investigation**! Lucky, too, since it transpires that there are only two books in the whole archive dealing with this aspect of Drow culture. Nethza finds two full chapters on this in a big tome. There are so many rules and ways to offend Drow society! Webs of obligations, numerous ways to be tripped up. It can be quite vicious - killing other families as a way up the ladder is apparently permitted - it's quite overwhelming. Sins are typically around the "showing weakness" / mercy area. There *is* a way back, each specific to the nature of the offence. "Regain the favour of Lolth" (Lolth - the Spider Queen of the Drow). So hundreds of ways to offend with corresponding ways to fix it. There are some common themes; brutal murder and sacrifices to Lolth feature heavily.

Temo's found the other book. A lot of Drow, it seems, are not part of the studied Drow society. The studied aspects are just the most visible - rich and powerful - but Drow have lots of other stuff going on - not all Drow are even necessarily evil. Quori, it seems, can be used to refer to all of these. Intended "outcasts", rather than people "sinning" / cast out. This perhaps then is the most likely explanation for our VVIP.

Riglan insight: 12+5. He notices that Nethza reacts to the information quite strongly - she almost sympathises with the Quori concept; because they're Drow, they won't be accepted in other societies on assumption of being evil. So where does that leave them?

We get to Firelast's to pick up Riglan's outfit. Trousers to match his armour top, hide belt with bone clasp (not metal!), graduating in colour to a dark green below, boots with a grey fur around the top; ties in various places again to match the armour (which he sewed after all); a green-brown kind of "sunlight on forest floor" oilskin-feeling outer, wool inner coat with white rabbit fur. Riglan is happy as it's fitting / in keeping, not too fancy etc., but smart and tailored. 15gp, which actually seems very cheap. He also brings a dark/light green alternating pattern scarf to wear with it - Riglan is very much more than warm enough, but it's winter soon, Firelast is very enthusiastic, it's "only" 2gp, so Riglan agrees and gets that too.

We head back to the Pipe. It's very busy! Staff are run off their feet. We ask what time the thing starts? No later than 6:30 to arrive for 7pm sailing. Ah! We'll be sailing.

We head upstairs to wait (other people are "getting ready" but we don't have anything to do really). Temo can gamble, he says, but it draws attention to you if winning or is expensive otherwise.

Outfits: Temo, Nethza 15, 15, Riglan, Maireagh 10, 10 rolls! So those two look decent, while the other two look passable. We're tidy but won't turn heads. That's actually not bad. We realise that we can't really bring backpacks but strip out non-essentials from the bag of holding and put backpacks in there in case of emergency. Riglan has his staff, Temo has to hide the crossbow but has his wand and a dagger, Maireagh likewise has to hide her sword. We likewise hide all three shields. Riglan feels uneasy at being so... Exposed.

**It's time to head to The Grand Dame**. Quite a few others heading there too from the Pipe. Near the ship people are milling around, tickets being checked; Temo presents ours in due course and they write our names down on a scroll. They want a group name.

**Temo says, "Temo's Fabulous Five"**.

There's a red carpet leading up the gang plank to the huge ship. Many crew around. It leads to the main deck, very grand, can be walked around the perimeter of whole ship; though there is another deck above that's inset with some slightly overhanging balconies. Three masts. Glass globes with fireflies strung up all over the place. Lanterns in the ship are filled with cold continual flame. It seems like more of the bustle and action is in a deck below the one we're on. Just as we're thinking of where we might go to keep an eye out for the VVIP, he arrives anyway at the dock in full costume with painted porcelain mask and medium-brimmed hat with sparkly gems on it and sequins and feathers. There's even a long, red velvet cloak and pointy-up shoes. Sparkles everywhere.

His arrival causes quite a stir! "That's Lord Quori!" they say - interesting, because we believe now that this isn't his name and it might even be sort of insulting. Only the two guards and Quori come up onto the ship. We blend in with the gawkers! We use Temo for cues (CHA-based stealth check - only 6, but plus 10) - use his charisma to *not* stand out. Someone comes with a tray of drinks so we all take one. Quori swishes around as he walks, to help in essence deliberately animate his costume. It's almost like a dancer; graceful; considering how he seemed maybe old or fail before, it's interesting. The grey/silver hair - Drow; not necessarily old; his tired-sounding voice - just over it perhaps. One guard in front, one guard behind. The guards are not complacent; they're clearly looking around carefully.

He heads straight towards the back of the boat, onto the stairs and upwards to the open area rather than the busy section downstairs. He's basically socialising and deliberately showing off - literally keeping up appearances, as he said. "Does the rounds", then pretty much does the circumference circuit on the main deck, then finally takes the grand, wooden, curving stairs down into the lower deck where the action is.

Riglan calls his spider and he sends it around the edges of the deck up to the captain's room on the deck above us, astern. We head down, following the VVIP. Ornate glass swinging doors push aside and the stairs sweep down to what looks like a grand ballroom. Riglan: Perception 10+8. Noisy! The doors had kept the sound inside quite well. Directly ahead, a large rug, almost like tapestry, and a small round table made of heavy oak with an ice carving of a goose, wings outspread. Servants to either side hold empty trays to take glasses. Some gaming tables to the left and right; smaller to the right, longer tables to the left. Dancers in the space in the middle. At the far end of the room a small band plays, with a small bar to one side. We see one gaming table alone in the middle of the room, which is fancier than the others. The VVIP isn't at it. It has a huge roulette wheel set into it. Close by on the left we see, in front of the gaming tables, a desk with a man standing there, small chests in pigeon holes behind - cashier. Temo, history 4+3; doesn't remember protocols etc. related to the cashier. He asks us to just hang back a moment while he observes others. He sees people exchanging *trade bars* for gambling chips.

Under the guise of enjoying the room & checking the different games out, we search for the VVIP. He's at a far table, guards sat either side, participating in a game. We move closer to observe. Temo intelligence-based insight: 2! + 3. He's too short! He asks if Riglan can see what's going on and explain it. Perception: 10+8. He sees a dealer handing out cards to people. Everyone gets 2 cards, then the dealer puts one on the table. People push their token things into the middle in differing amounts. Nethza figures out that it's quite a simple matching game; match colours or numbers, with numbers worth more than colours and higher numbers being worth more too. 5 seats, currently all occupied. You bet before the dealer puts down cards. At the end of the round, four are left and everyone gets another card; new bets are laid. Three left including the VVIP. More rounds. Riglan isn't really sure what constitutes "in" or "out" or why you'd bet high. Nethza explains that it's a guessing game; hiding your reactions, reading others, having "good" cards - higher numbers or a spread of colours. When people leave, they've decided they can't win and given up before having to bet any more. VVIP and one more left, big pile of chips. The hands are revealed - VVIP loses. Lower numbers than his opponent. He congratulates his opponent, bows to the dealer, wishes everyone good look - Temorah smile on you - and starts to walk away.

Temo manages to have a brief chat using Temorah as a hook but it doesn't go anywhere. The VVIP wanders between tables a while, then gets to a dice game table and hangs around a bit.

Riglan tells people he wants to briefly check with his spider; so we walk to a supporting pillar and can lean against it nonchalantly. The spider is in the captain's office, with a bed next to it. The room is dark. It's quite a small room - 15x15 ft. Desk with chair and lots of things on it - books, scrolls, papers, all sorts. Shelves, full of things again; a lot of belongings in here. The bed is unmade. A chest and a sack are present. The spider walks up to the bag. It walked up to it, then briefly into it and disappeared - or Riglan lost contact. It's not out of range. Riglan looks around the room we're all in; no obvious places to talk, so perhaps another deck. There's a spiral staircase going up and down in addition to the grand stairs. We try going up. Indoors, a smaller space, roughly at the level of the main deck outside but offset. It's a dining hall, various alcoves curtained off.

A Maitre-de appears and offers to lead us to a table; Riglan asks for a quiet corner; we're ushered into an upholstered alcove with a small round table. We squeeze around it. He asks if we want the curtains shut and we say yes, but she leans and shuts the curtains over the windows behind. Then also the privacy curtain. Someone will be along with food shortly. We draw the curtain open again for attention.

Suddenly there's a whistle noise and the sound of excitement and opening curtains, so we follow suit and open the window curtains too. We see that the ship is sailing - ah, right, it's 7pm. Then Riglan realises the spider is trying to contact him! Wisdom saving - nat 20 + 8. The spider says that Riglan went quiet when it was in the bag. Lots in there! Food, large fur coats, lots and lots of boots, a large wheel, a few beautiful sculptures. Riglan thanks the spider and pops it back to the fey. Ah. Just a bag of holding! Doh.

Hmm, so we have to kind of go through the food thing. There's a 3 course 9gp/ea set menu, or al a carte items between 1 and 4gp. We go for that - Riglan and Temo go for something fish-related; the other two agree too - fish in Yartar, after all - though Maireagh has crab. They have a huge drinks list and, specifically, Mirabaran ale for Maireagh - a gallon! - 8gp. It arrives in a pewter jug of sorts, complete with lid. Takes only about 15 minutes for the main food; it's very good, fortunately. Riglan: Perception nat 1 :-/ + 8. There's a change in conversation tone around us; people sound a bit more excited suddenly. Riglan pops out the spider on the curtain outside - the VVIP is here. He's ushered to a special table, some distance away from us in an area with its own sliding wooden door. We pull the curtain to get a closer look; perception 12+8. Quori is swishing across the room, guards behind, chatting to the maitre-de. The room has a table which looks like it'd seat 10; the two guards stand. The maitre-de serves Quori personally; the barman runs over with a bottle and glass; lots of fuss. The door is slid shut by the barman, with the maitre-de inside still. A little while later, the maitre de leaves.

Temo tries to knock on the door but the minute he gets there he's ushered away by the maitre-de, so pretends he wanted to find the bathroom. He goes, then comes back to us.

Riglan and Temo wonder who the captain is and where he or she might be. Lord Drylund wouldn't be the captain.

We have a few weird plans, none of them very good, but we wait around and play for time (via desserts, for example) to see what Quori does - e.g. go to bathroom, or to the gaming tables. As we finish desert, Quori is heading to the spiral stairs - no bathroom, at least not right now. We take what's left of our drinks, Riglan gives the maitre-de a gold - he seems very happy - and we head back down to the gaming floor. VVIP is there, at the roulette table this time. There's a bit of space next to him this time. We crowd around, but it's very public and busy again, so unlikely to provide conversation opportunities any greater than Temo's passing attempt before.

As we head to the table, we're intercepted! An older, slightly overweight, ostentatiously dressed man. Well combed hair, etc.; a fancy hat; loud, Sgt Pepper's kinda blazer/jacket. Carries a beautiful, ornate, ivory cane. A gem is clasped by what look like tentacles at the top. He says hi in a very florid way; "Lord Drylund, I assume?" says Riglan. Yep. After many faux compliments and talking-up of our obvious skills at gaming - uh-huh - he hands us a complimentary chip with 100 on it, and reminds us where the cashier is! We go there and ask about the 100; it's equivalent to silvers. Most tables, we're told, take minimum bids of maybe 10s, but 100 is a "standard", high value are 500. There are also "blanks", worth 1,000 and 5,000, that look a bit like unmarked trade bars. Riglan offers 9 platinum for 9 more standards, but the cashier actually gives us 8 of the standards and 10 of the smalls.

OK, so we have some chips. We go to the roulette wheel anyway to watch Quori for a while. He's ordered drinks for everyone there. Before Riglan can stop him, Temo grabs a small chip and (only just really able to reach the table) chucks it down - on, it transpires, Black 18. Nah. House wins.

Quori heads to a poker table - there's room - Temo sees space and *dashes* (dex 10+8) over there, getting an empty seat before others can make it there. The rest of us lumber over. There are 6 seats; we aren't next to each other but do more or less face each other. The table fills up. Quori changes mask; weird, different masks for different games; Riglan doesn't see anything at the changeover. It's too fast (perception 4, sigh, + 8). The new mask lets you see more of his face - perhaps to give no unfair advantages.

Minimum bet is a small, so we do that. We all get 2 cards. Our hand is poor. Temo easily gives that away (deception 5+4). Can't see much either (perception 5 again + 2).

Temo's cards 1, 3
                and  2, 7
Dealer 1st card    1, 9 (bet 1 small)
Subsequent card 1, 4 (bet +3 small)
-> almost no chance of any runs, so fold

LEFT IN POT

Riglan perception 15+8, Quori is certainly excited. Eyes may have eye shadow, perhaps to deliberately hide skin colour? Gives nothing away. Insight only 7+5. Quori seems excited but not too certain about his hand. He eventually raises to match a high bid on the table. Dealer draws the last card; 1, Jack. At this, perception 8+8, Quori is looking stoic; but another player briefly perhaps winces. Riglan realises he can't really see reactions for more than maybe 2 people at once as he doesn't notice what the 3rd player does. Quori starts betting higher now. The person who winced puts down a 500 piece but everyone matches; they look like they didn't expect it and had hoped others would fold. Everyone shows hands; the crestfallen person suddenly looks joyous as it turns out they have the best hand. The other two had poor cards all the way and we just bluffing.

Another round. Minimum 1 standard.

LEFT IN POT
1 standard

Temo's cards 2, 5
                and  2, 6! -> deception 15+4, so doesn't give much away
Dealer 1st card    3, 4 (bet 1 standard)
Subsequent card 4, 6 (minimum bet +1 std, but Temo does +2 & is matched)

Perception at this point, 14+2. Quori's eyes widen in excitement, two are inscruitable. One more bows out. The bid is pushed up by +2 again. Temo matches.

Last dealer card 1, 4 so two pairs, no runs. Perception 11+2, Temo doesn't notice much from people. Bet goes up by +1, Temo matches and again, +1, and finally +1 more. We meet it one last time. Quori, it turns out, nearly has a hand but not quite - the final card ruined it. Almost 4,5,6,7,8. Instead, 4,5,6,4,8 in mixed suits. Another player has a match of 3, but not two pairs like Temo. So, Temo won! Woah. 42 standard equivalent won, 1 tipped to dealer.

Quori wants one more round. He congratulates Temo. A conversation is starting.

Quori says, "why not!" and puts in another standard. We match.

Dealer adds 2 hearts. Well at least that's a pair by suit. Everyone raises by 1, but Temo goes up by +2 (bluffing based on what he did last time). It works! 3 people bow out, so 3 of us remain, including Quori.

Final card, 9 of hearts. Quori gets chatty, not really paying attention. The other person drops out. Temo tries to make a bit of smalltalk too. Riglan (insight 19+5) knows that we won't really get Quori alone for a quiet conversation, but this kind of environment, maybe just speak.

Quori surprisingly folds at this point, so Temo shows his hand - neither of us actually had anything! Quori says, "Looks like luck - or perhaps bravery? - that keeps you in the game tonight!" - 24 standard to Temo, with again 1 to dealer.

"How about it, Quori? One more?" - he wants to up the stakes to larges. Eeek. Temo says, "Not so sure about bravery..." - Quori waves down someone for a drink, but insight 14+5, other people just snap their fingers. He was more polite. Temo makes a comment about sometimes we have people around us that look as if they're there to protect us etc. - deception 15+4.

Temo talks about poker being like life up to a point, but at least in real life you can ask for help from friends around, but in poker you have to hide (deception 16+4). Riglan sees (perception 7+8), that Quori probably understood; but says that perhaps sometimes it's a bit too late and you just go through the motions. Bids one more large, as does everyone else.

Quori continues, "the key with poker is knowing when your hand is just not good enough rather than betting it all and losing".

Dealer, 9 diamonds.

More chat; Riglan (insight 17+5) picks up that Quori isn't a prisoner, the guards aren't stopping him leaving; he's saying that there's no reason for a rescue or breaking out of the thing he's in will help, but might cause more harm than good. So perhaps it's less about extracting the person and more about information.

Temo bids + 2 large (+10)...

Quori folds. Temo looks visibly disappointed. "I guess my money has gone to the High Forest!". 3 people left. Nobody has a hand! But one person had an Ace, and highest card wins.

New players arrive, and stakes come down to standards. Temo says, "one more for the road". Quori asks, "Ever been to the High Forest?" - he talks about the outpost of the Wood Elves, a relic of a bygone time. Says it's in a line on the North-Western edge, inhabited by human traders/diplomats and elves, seeking to revive old alliances and old ways (Phalorm/Ilfarn). Not everyone believes in the idea, he says; much bad blood between some cultures. "So some might act to create distrust or disruption?", suggests Temo. Quori agrees and says, "Are you familiar with elves?", brushing his hair back - a dark pointed purple ear briefly revealed.

Temo: 2 clubs, 8 diamonds
Dealer: Q hearts

Someone bids +3.

Temo mentions that we do have druidic connections via Riglan and could indeed meet elves at the High Forest. Quori basically tells us that it's none of the major players; an outside party; and given Temo's hints at that being "elementary", that it's not elementals either. Someone new; not the people who originally owned the orb (it was stolen from them), not the Hand (they were outbid), not the Zhentarim because he's aware that they still seem to want it, and clearly not Drylund because he facilitated its sale a few days prior. He doesn't actually know who the person he handed it to really is. But he does give away that he's actually working for Drylund - the *real* sale was to the person Quori handed it to. Drylund funded Quori to bid on the orb.

Dealer: 6 clubs.

Quori folds. Four players left, all stay in, raising by another 2 standard. Temo stays in one more time.

Temo's beaten by a pair of 10s for his pair of 2s. Boo! Quori: "Well, I think my luck has run out for the day, but I think I did what I came here to do. When the final scales are weighed, I hope it's enough." He bows and hands a Large to the dealer and starts to leave. Temo: "Nice talking to you, Quori."

We cash out - 235 gold equivalent. "Is this beginners luck I smell?!" asks the cashier - yes; yes, it is.

It's quite late, we go up on the top deck for air; the ship is headed back to Yartar. At around midnight it gets back in. Quori has kept up his act, winning and losing, throwing money around. We realise now that it's all Drylund's money anyway.

We do notice that underneath the practiced act, a lingering and enduring sadness. They're not living for themselves, but perhaps for someone else - his family perhaps, he has at least got a purpose.

The ship docks and guests depart. Drylund thanks people as they leave, including us.

We head back to the Pipe and go to sleep.
