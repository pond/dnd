# Riglan: Part 19
## DAY 100

We are at Riverguard Keep with Dreena. Today, we relocate a Dragon Turtle.

There were no strange dreams. Riglan sleeps through the night. He feels strangely safe within the Keep's thick stone walls, which is strange given how recently we were skulking around in this place which was owned by a force of evil. It feels unrecognisably different. There's still a wariness to the people here, too; they know this isn't really their place yet. It'll take a while to establish a true claim.

We take the underground boat back down the river. As usual, there's the hour or so and strange change of direction of current, then another hour or so "upriver" to get back to the cavern. It's quiet. At least it's not much darker, because many of the lights - if not all - were continual flames. We're uneasy though as the water is dark and still. Druids don't trust still, dark waters in underground temples to elemental evils.

Riglan thinks that we'll need our friendly to talk Aquan again, tho Temo will be able to use the Helm to listen in; but Nethza says she communed with her patron - Raven Queen, think - and can use a spell to communicate directly for herself or anyone else. Dreena meanwhile casts Dancing Lights for better illumination and they do illuminate a foot or two of water but still not much. Riglan meanwhile spends some time in the boat just before reaching the cavern working on his Underwater Breathing ritual and soon enough we all have that ability.

To avoid alarming Bronzefume, we head towards his lake but get out on one of the canal docks early and tie up the boat. Dreena checks that her lights work in the water! They do, so we explain that we basically just have to walk down into the lake and let ourselves sink, then say "haro Bronzefume - we're back".

We realise with a bit of a shock that we were meant to bring another magic item as a tribute, but fortunately Dreena is way ahead of us on that and has some kind of magic crown, saying that she was told about the preferences of Dragon Turtles and thought it would help smooth things over. It certainly will!

It's a crown of driftwood and coral, tied to the underground cavern they've found for Bronzefume at Shadowtop. When he takes possession of the crown, he'll be able to see the cavern if he wears it, and thus know (hopefully) that it suits him - but also keep an eye on his future home and hoard from a distance. This makes it a particularly desirable lair.

We head down underwater. It's no less strange than it was the first time we did this, despite our prior experience. Nethza says, "Who's going to talk to him?" and Riglan says, "Well, it's not an ego trip, but I was talking last because I had to work through sea hag I conjured, so maybe I start?" and so she puts a hand on Riglan, her eyes briefly swirl with blackness and she casts Tongues. Temo puts on the Helm so he can listen in.

We slowly make our way along the lake bed, trying to remember where Bronzefume might be. He finds us, we don't find him - very quickly, in fact. He looms large and frightening as he swims into the radius of the dancing lights. He settles to the lake bed, cranes his head and says, "Ah, I thought it was you - not many people would come down here and visit me. Most of the other creatures have left." "Most?" "Well, there have always been a few creatures down in the water here. The giant octopus in the main lake is quite happy staying, for a start."

Oooookay. Giant octopus we never knew were there.

A few lizardfolk have taken up residence in rooms here too. It's definitely a good idea to keep people out of this section in future, even though the dwarves will doubtless be tempted.

We introduce Dreena. Dreena speaks Draconic directly. She brings out the crown and presents it, then with permission places it on his head. He uses it to look in and explore his possible new home and seems quite pleased. "Ah. Well this will definitely do. I will need to move my things!" and we sense a pulse of thought and will expand out from him, at which various creatures appear around the lake floor - octopi, large sea horses and more. They swim off into the dark water beyond then a while later, return carrying his hoard. Things are slowly attached to his shell, until he's thoroughly adorned and declares himself ready to go.

Dreena explains that she'll be on a boat up ahead and will try to keep the way clear for him. If he could please try and swim near the river bed it would avoid alarm - we'll be passing boats and ships. He asks if he's allowed to inspect them? "No, not this time - I don't think this would be wise" - "But I really like looking at what's in them. It doesn't take much usually, you push on ones idea and most will empty what they're carrying". We point out that we don't want people to attack him because they're scared. This convincing takes a while. It's like trying to tell a dog to NOT fetch a thrown stick, but we do eventually get there!

Nethza and Maireagh are confused as it's been a long conversation but we quickly bring them up to date and we finally get moving. We'll go ahead once we're at Riverguard and make sure the waterways are cleared out of the Keep. Bronzefume is surprisingly graceful and agile though he does have to squeeze a few places through the narrow tunnel and remarks that it is perhaps no bad thing he's leaving now, lest he have become too big to ever leave at all. At the underground dock Dreena and Bronzefume wait while we go ahead to clear the way. As we attempt to explain without causing alarm, we cause alarm but at least people leave the water and the way is clear.

Dreena now pushes out with this large, dark shape fairly clearly visible below under the shallow waters here. There's a brief shudder in the structure as he brushes past part of the tower underwater. Dreena shouts back - "I forgot to say, Moonan sends her love! Come visit us some time! Bye!" and off she goes.

We have to make a final decision on where we go down to the lower levels. It took a few hours to get in and out so before we move on we definitely have a late lunch and rest. During lunch, Riglan suggests that perhaps Temo doesn't need to still have the helm on...

...and now we have to choose. It's about 2pm. Back down the tunnel, or down to the monastery and stairs? While the tunnel is tempting for safety, the monastery is tempting to continue to try and tackle cult activity and help unravel things.

Monastery it is, we decide. We pole our way upstream in the on-loan-from-Yartar boat, Dreena having used our underground river boat to guide the dragon turtle. We find it easy going and arrive just before 5pm, with the sun getting low. We find a place to pull the boat out and get it safely hidden. Riglan survival: 4+8, and the best he can do is about a 20 minute walk on the bank to find trees for hiding. We do the best we can to mark the location on a map and Riglan sketches a rough idea of the configuration of trees, really just relative sizes, so we have some idea of where it is.

We follow back along the river until the inland track and eventually we get back to the monastery. It's about 5:30pm and going dark. On approach, Riglan perception 10+8 - it looks quite different. The doors are shut and locked, so we go around looking for the old garden entrance we used before. In the end we resort to just trying doors and we find an unlocked side door - we go inside. There are lights on in the main building. Riglan calls a rat to scurry ahead and scout out.

Riglan sees through the rat while it's in range; it hears movement around corners and behind doors, but the rat can't fit under doors. It peeks around some corners. One humanoid is seen; other noises came from another direction, so there must be at least two. It's hard to tell much. Riglan asks the rat to try and run ahead to get past the individual for a look at their face (rat stealth only 8+0), which takes it out of range. Later, it comes running back - it had to dodge being hit by a staff as it was seen, but the person didn't have a mask that was seen.

This isn't telling us much, so we just decide to make a beeline for Renwick's tower, though this takes us through a main corridor. As soon as we turn into a corridor, we hear, "Hey, what are you doing in here?" and we turn to see a man in full plate armour and holding a spear. They have an aggressive stance. Riglan replies, "I could well ask you the same question - nobody is supposed to be here now."

The man starts shouting about intruders and yelling - "these are the people we've been looking for!" - and he starts to move up towards you. Riglan asks him, "what cult are *you* working for?!" - and he throws a spear. He seems angry at us. Riglan insight only 4+5. All Riglan can tell is that he doesn't seem to be the other three than Earth, so probably that? The spear just misses.

Riglan says, "We don't want to fight. We don't like taking people out. But we will if we're forced to. We've done it many times before." - the aggressor just glares and says, "then we know who you are!" and charges at us, drawing a longsword.

Initiative is rolled; Riglan first. He can hear a few more sets of footsteps, maybe four? (Perception only 4+8). Mostly he can hear things ahead and to the right. He shouts to the others that he might check the door to the tower behind us, but doesn't want to just let "the bad guys" in. He activates his staff and throws flames at the armoured aggressor, hitting for 7 damage.

From behind the armoured man, we suddenly realise we hear *extremely* fast, but very light footsteps. Riglan shouts "might be a monk or rogue on the way, watch out!". Maireagh meanwhile runs up to engage the aggressor. She gets in one hit for 14 damage. The dog runs up but can't get a hit against the plate armour. The aggressor moves to square up with Maireagh and tries to push her out of the way. Maireagh stumbles, expecting an attack not a shove; she falls over prone, the man swings his sword but the dog jumps in and manages to knock his swing wide.

Nethza sees Maireagh prone and casts Hex against the aggressor immediately. She gets one of two Eldritch Blasts on target for 18 damage, which takes the guy down. She runs up to Maireagh to try and help her back on her feet.

More footsteps and, emerging from the right is a Duergar - which goes straight past Temo, partly hidden in a corner and goes straight for Nethza. He enlarges as he approaches - until almost 9 feet tall, with a now-massive shortsword. He swings twice, but both attacks just miss.

Temo skips around the dwarf between his legs, draws his shortsword and with the duergar flanked, attacks. He hits for 23 damage. As he does this, another full plate human runs in at the far end, pulling out a morningstar.

Riglan tries to attack but rolls at nat 1. (It's another weirdly bad day for rolls, tho I'm doing them via D&D Beyond today so should be unbiased).

The quiet footsteps person arrives in the corner of the room - looks similar to how Helenray did, way back. Black robes; monk probably. Male. Sees Maireagh exposed & goes straight in for the attack. *Three* unarmed strikes. First misses, second would hit but Maireagh reacts with Shield, which then blocks the third attack. The attacker backs away into the corner.

Maireagh gets up! She's kind of surrounded, but decides to attack the duergar. The first attack hits for 8, the second attack just misses unfortunately. She gets the dog to run around to do the same, but this opens it up an opportunity attack from the other plate guy which does hit, dealing 9 damage; the dog then tries its attack and does hit the duergar, for 10 damage which takes it down. Good dog. It shrinks to its normal size after falling. The dog runs back around to her side again, then pushes forward to confront the new monk arrival.

Nethza moves the hex onto the remaining plate guy and throws two Eldritch Blasts. Both hit for 17 and 15 damage.

Temo drops his sword, runs out with his bow and goes for the monk. He rolls at 4 :-/ so obviously misses. Temo tries to hide in the corner. Nat 20, FML, what a waste! Total 31.

The plate mail guy misses Nethza twice. Riglan throws fire at him, rolls a 3. 13 total. Obvious miss, frustrating! The monk now runs up to attack Maireagh again; the first misses, the second would hit, so Temo throws Silver Barbs but it doesn't help (the magical advantage transfers to Nethza) doing 9 damage and pushing Maireagh back 5 feet. The third attack is at the dog, dealing another 9 damage and also pushing it backwards.

Maireagh runs back forward. She goes for the monk, just hitting twice for 10 and 13. The dog manages to get in a bite as well, for 4 damage.

Nethza draws her Lightbringer mace and continues attacking the plate armour guy twice. The first attack hits thanks to the advantage from Silvery Barbs for 15, but the second attack is wide - doesn't matter as the aggressor now falls.

Temo aims and fires. He does hit but for low rolls yield only 19 damage *potentially*; the monk does some fancy avoidance trick and takes only 8 damage. Temo notes that it looks like the monk was trying to catch it.

Riglan gets in a hit with fire (22 attack roll) but only rolls 3 damage (2d8), argh. The monk comes forward and tries to attack Maireagh again. The first and second miss, the third would hit but Temo uses Silvery Barbs once more and this time it's effective, causing the monk to miss; he gives Maireagh the advantage (unbeknownst to Temo at the time of casting, it would've been a crit hit). Maireagh strikes with a radiant damage spell mixed in, for 11 radiant and 10 regular damage. Maireagh strikes again, hitting a second time; she deals 13 damage and takes down the monk.

Riglan runs to the door and sees if it will open. It's locked. Temo tries to unlock it, but it's magically locked. Riglan tries banging on the door and shouting, "Hi Renwick, sorry, it's us, bit of bother outside, don't suppose you could let us in could you?!" - we wait for a moment, which feels like an eternity - the door swings ajar. We run inside and push the door shut behind us. Renwick is not sat at his table, but is actually at the stairs, having just emerged up from the crypt area. He beckons us down.

In the crypt, we see that there's been a battle. Someone had managed to get in through his defences. Riglan is concerned, "is everything OK?" - he's OK but there are more and more forces coming up to try and retake the keep. Renwick was too occupied with defences down below to keep the monastery clear.

We explain that it'd taken us a while to get back - at this Renwick gives us back the ingot - and he throws a few more layers of protection against the crypt doors, which will keep things safe for a while.

"Unfortunately, you're going to have to sleep down here. They've given up trying to break in here, but I think they're just trying to keep me busy and out of the main monastery. They're trying to retake their base. They're not in the mines; I don't sense them there anyway; they're storming the monastery."

We ask if he thinks we should continue down, or clear the monastery again. He says, "If you're headed down the stairs - and looking at you, I think you *are* ready now - then it would be good to cut the beast off at the head."

He creates a small "real" fire - warmth - on a flagstone, which has no smoke but keeps us comfortable. We ask if he eats or drinks and he doesn't. He says he wants to check on defences up above. They're coming in groups of 4 or 6. They don't linger in the monastery, more using it as a thoroughfare for now.

For now, we can long rest. An unexpectedly exciting entry to the monastery!



## DAY 101

We awaken in Renwick's crypt, ready to descend to the Temple of Black Earth. Temo is searching Maireagh's back in the morning - eventually pulling out the apples! He hands them around, but stops at Nethza who seems to be in a kind of trance; she's sat, gripping her glass shard, mouthing silent words. Temo sits next to her but she doesn't stir. He waits a few minutes, then tries going, "Nethza? Nethza!" and this kind of awakens her. "Oh. What time is it?" she asks. "I dunno, we're in a crypt..." "I was having a really in-depth conversation with whoever my patron is. I'm pretty sure it's the Raven Queen." "Oh! I'm sorry I interrupted..." says Temo, handing Nethza her apple.

"No, it's fine. It's quite rare to hear from her though - good thing it doesn't happen when we're in the middle of something." "What did she say?" "She's given me a task. But she won't tell me what it is. She'll follow us down there - looking though my eyes - and when the time comes, I'll know what to do. I'm not sure if she knows herself just yet but she's very interested in what's happening down there. She said something about 'not having had eyes down there in a very long time', but she did promise to keep an eye on us." "Well, that can't hurt - we're a bit stuck out on our own here...", responds Temo. Maireagh wakes up and Riglan stirs at the same time more or less.

We eat apples, some cured meats and a few last pastries. Then we pack up, and say goodbye to Renwick before cautiously, with his assistance, opening the lower door out of the crypt to access the mines.

It's dark so we illuminate our normal lights. Riglan: Survival 7+8. He thinks it's "this way", and leads us along passageways. Temo: History 7+3; he's not very helpful! It takes a while to find the correct tunnel and reach the locked gate.

Riglan digs Helenray's key out of his backpack and hands it to Temo to do the mage hand thing - but we find the padlock lying on the ground; the gate is unlocked - but not open. Riglan checks it with Detect Magic; there seems to be no magic on the gate or stairs. It's just a regular gate. Oh. Well, onward and downward.

We descend. For the first 10 minutes, Riglan is still able to "see" magic; there is none. Maireagh goes first, examining the dwarven stairs as we go. We can see they go down a long way. They're carved out of the rock but eventually follow a sort of squared-off spiral descent, but we're in basically a tunnel much of the time; usually, the core is solid with occasional moments where it opens up on the side into natural caverns. It seems like the stairs might've been cut into an area of rock full of natural spaces, making it easier to tunnel.

After at least 40 'rotations' around the squared-off spiral, 400ft down maybe, Maireagh notes that everything is in good shape. There are spaces for sconces at regular intervals but usually not filled and none lit. There's only a very slight smoothing on the stair base to give away wear and tear over the year. Maireagh makes approving indications about the quality of the work - these must be 1000 years old, give or take. Yet, it's a very long light flight and a long walk; we wonder what the monastery was originally for and how, and why, it was all connected. We don't know what part of Besilmir we'll be arriving into.

Suddenly she tells Riglan to put out lights; she can feel a change in the air ahead. We put the main lights out; everyone uses darkvision, with Temo on the goggles, and Riglan borrows his light ring, keeping close to the ground just to illuminate the steps, drawing up rear so his own party helps shield the light from anyone below.

Soon enough, we get to the bottom of the stairwell. It gets to a landing which turns into a corridor, widening out. Riglan can't see much, so Temo whispers (60ft darkvision) to describe the space. In fact after a while of waiting for eyes to acclimatise, there is very, very dim light; the cavern seems huge - several hundred feet across. We can't see the ceiling. Ahead is a stone bridge, about 10ft wide that rises slightly and follows two 90 degree turns, a sort of lazy zig-zag, before descending to some kind of large gates we can just about make out ahead. Looks like a grand, fortress-like entrance. On either side, the path falls away. Temo thinks he can see down just about to the base - but the fall is therefore around 60ft.

Temo investigates a little to see if there are other ways around (investigation, total 23). He sees that the sides slope down around the cave base; it's not sheer. But it's quite unlike anything he's seen before or can really draw a parallel to; the shape and nature of the cavern and rock, along with formations, are completely new to him. Riglan figures he'll need Darkvision so casts it, giving Temo back the light ring, with the light extinguished. Maireagh, Temo, Nethza then Riglan.

As we leave the alcove where we arrived, Riglan stops the party quite quickly and stops and listens carefully (perception 19 total). There's much more distance to the cave wall on the right than the left. We carefully proceed forward (stealth: Riglan 18, Temo 21, Nethza 11, Maireagh 10), looking and listening carefully. Riglan perception 14 total. He hears stone moving to his right and above him while about half way across and whispers loudly to the party - **"something's moving, probably coming after us - make a dash for the far side!"**

We hustle and get to the far side, just as Temo's sling warns of imminent attack. Temo yelps and Riglan hears a rumble as an Earth Elemental emerges out of the ground in front of us, blocking our path further; meanwhile behind we hear the sound of wings behind... Initiative time!

* Riglan: 24
* Temo: 19
* Nethza: 21
* Maireagh: 4 (she's very surprised by the earth elemental!)

Riglan looks behind and sees two gargoyles flying in, so he calls out a warning, still trying to keep it mostly just within party earshot. Unsure if any of his conjured creatures would necessarily be fly and, of those, if they could see in the dark, he remembers his newly acquired lightning wand; he lets his staff fall into the crook of his arm, draws the wand and fires. He hits one fully and another half damage for 24/12 (8d6). They're approaching fast so Riglan puts the wand back and readies his staff, moving alongside Temo so they're side by side on the edge of the bridge, not quite at the safety of the far ledge since the Elemental blocked the way.

Nethza pushes around behind Temo to face up to the gargoyles. She hexes the closest gargoyle and throws eldritch blasts its way. Both hit, dealing 12 + 14 damage.

Temo aims and fires at the elemental. Nat 20! Damage rolls are a bit middling but he manages 40 damage, which is still pretty good going.

The heavily damaged gargoyle swoops down at Riglan. Its bite misses but the claws hit, for 8 damage. The less damaged second gargoyle just reaches Nethza but misses both of its attacks.

Maireagh (and surprisingly, not the earth elemental - very low initiative roll!) is next. She tries to figure out its magic, but doesn't do so well on the arcana check and decides to just hit it with the longsword. First attack is a hit, the second a crit! 8 and 18 damage. She orders the dog to attack - wut, another crit - 14 damage.

Now the elemental finally responds. It wants to try and break through the ground and appear in the midst of the party to get to Temo, but by chance we're too closely packed. Instead, then, it decides to try and shove Maireagh and the dog off the bridge! Maireagh resists (just! needs a Flash Of Genius) and this angers the elemental, which changes tactic and smashes at her, hitting for 15 damage.

A third gargoyle starts to fly in.

Riglan activates his staff and attacks the close by gargole; he hits, taking it down. Nethza transfers the hex to her own close-by gargoyle, grabs her mace and, using Booming Blade to try and prevent it being able to move onto anyone else, attacks. Unfortunately, she misses!

Temo aims and fires at the elemental again, this time for only 19 damage.

The gargoyle by Nethza attacks her; the bite misses but the claws manage to hit critically, for 9 damage. Maireagh meanwhile is still toe-to-toe with the earth elemental and keeps swinging. She manages to hit twice, for 19 damage. The dog manages a hit as well, for 6 damage. The enraged elemental attacks Maireagh back, and would hit but Temo sees it coming and distracts with Silvery Barbs (giving Nethza the advantage as he can hear all the commotion behind). The second attack can't be deflected and hits Maireagh for 15 damage.

The third gargoyle reaches Riglan and attacks. Once again the bite misses but claws hit for 6. Riglan tries to hit back but misses. Meanwhile Nethza gets in one hit on the second gargoyle for 9 damage.

Temo sees the gargoyles closing in and the elemental looking pretty rough, so now aims and fires at the third one that's attacking Riglan. He hits for 22 damage.

The second gargoyle does manage to get in a claw hit on Nethza for 4 damage.

Maireagh hits and takes down the elemental, which slumps down into mud and kind of disintegrates into the ground. She spins around, pushes past Riglan and attacks the third gargoyle with her longsword backswing. She hits for 7 damage. The dog runs into the fray too, hits again, for 5 damage. That third gargoyle once again attacks Riglan, but the dog distracts its bits attack which misses. The claws once again hit - Riglan's no good at dodging those! - but only for 4 damage this time.

Riglan yet again misses with the staff. Nethza has trouble too, hitting only once for 12 damage. Temo once more aims and fires at the third gargoyle again. He hits for 19, not the best damage, but it's enough to take down that gargoyle. The second attacks Nethza, but misses both times. Maireagh turns, flanks it and attacks with the longsword; she hits twice and this takes it down too.

**We clear the bridge and approach the gate.**

As Maireagh pushes aside the bits of earth left by the elemental, she notices that the main gate doors are in fact derelict - once grand, now crumbled and broken. They were once 5ft thick, maybe 30ft high, stone and steel, but now pulled off hinges and collapsed. Ahead, a 50ft x 20ft room has two giant statues of dwarves with swords and lit torches above their head (but very dim), forming a sort of atrium. To the left and right we notice arrow slits. There are huge dwarven runes above the gates.

Behind, the party notices Maireagh getting visibly angry.

Temo investigates the arrow slits to see if he can see someone through them. Stealth 19+11! He hears people on the other side on the right, and can see movement behind the one on the left; there are lights on inside. He realises that they're not being manned, but also we need to keep quiet to get through undetected. He notices that they arrow slits are only about 5ft tall and barely 1ft wide; they could be blocked by an illusion.

He looks from one side of the room to the other arrow slit; he uses this to cast Minor Illusion so that anyone casually looking at the slit would see roughly what they expect of the room beyond. He tugs on Maireagh's sleeve and motions with his finger on his lips to keep quiet, and we back out for a moment to whisper. Nethza sees Maireagh's annoyance - "What's wrong?" "Well it's just dwarven arrogance - and desecration. The runes above the gates say, 'Tyar Besil - Jewel of Besilmir - gates never breached'. Someone has carved over bits of them with the earth cult symbols. Everything that has been written does say that Tyar Besil was never breached, so what happened here? It looks almost like there was an earthquake or similar. The doors don't look like they could've been breached from outside." Riglan says, "Well, we know there are spells that can do that, but they've been around for centuries so it seems strange that it took until recently for anyone to try it. Perhaps without anyone actually living here to defend it, the gates were easier to tackle and destroy."

Maireagh pulls us back onto the bridge. "Well, look at this. You see, this isn't a Dwarven bridge design. This looks... Well a dwarf would never leave the sides looking as rough or unfinished as these walls; it looks like parts of the cavern fell away, perhaps the same earthquake. But the stone isn't Dwarven. Someone built this."

Perhaps someone stumbled across this place after some catastrophe and realised they could bridge the chasm that had appeared, to reach the fallen gates.

Temo renews his illusions and we quietly move forward, past the statues.

Riglan (perception, 20+8) notices as we walk towards the fallen door that there is the sound of movement behind it. There's dim light ahead; Riglan motions to his party to hold for a moment, calls his fey spider and looks through it as it checks the room ahead. Stuff is strewn around; it looks like it used to be a kind of grand foyer, but now seems to be almost quarters, or a common room of sorts. There are four hobgoblins and a human in plate armour, holding a spear, riding a large naturally-armoured bulette. It's a big room, maybe 70x50ft, 6 columns down the middle holding up the almost 20ft high ceiling with dim light from a sconce on one wall. On the left is a door about half way along and at the far end a hallway leads into darkness, but a distant turn can be seen from a light somewhere further down after the corner. On the right, the first half of the wall is collapsed as if a cave-in happened. More evidence of an earthquake.

Riglan brings back the spider and draws in the dust on the floor four stick figures, plus a fifth that he makes look larger and more dangerous on top of a very Riglan stick outline bulette. Via hand motions, he indicates that he intends to call four creatures; the others think and then nod in turn, presumably planning; he counts down fingers, 3, 2, 1...

In Riglan's head, he's thinking that he might try to counter the battle early and see if they want to talk, but doesn't think he can start off light-touch because of the four hobgoblins and unknown threat from the bulette, so doesn't want to be caught off-guard with none of his spells running.

In the end, he changes tactic and thinks he's going to need something a bit more pokey and conjures two creatures. Giant eagles appear! They're popped into the middle of the room via and instructed to fly and attack the biggest thing in the room. He also drops in the bear totem to give everyone temp HP.

Initiative: Riglan 1+5, eagles 1+3 (sigh), Temo: 19, Nethza: 13, Maireagh: 21.

One hobgoblin is surprised; another is not, pulling out a longbow and attacking eagle 1 but in its rush, it misses (attack roll 10 against AC 13).

Maireagh and the dog run in, underneath the airborne eagles. The dog gets right up to hobgoblin 2 by dashing. Hobgoblin 4 is surprised; Temo runs in and tries to shoot #2, but just misses. The armoured human on the bulette is *not* surprised, and rides rapidly forward (40ft speed on bulette) next to Maireagh with the leading eagle just above it - in fact commanding the bulette to jump onto Maireagh! Even with advantage she can't save against it by brute strength, but in a flash of genius she realises she should roll quickly away, halving the 20+14 damage... Jeeze, still 17. The rider then tries to attack her with his spear, with *three* attacks. The dog interferes with the first attack which misses; this seems to throw it off a bit and the next two miss also.

Hobgoblin 3 is surprised too, luckily, so does not immediately act (initiative roll order is for Hobgoblins 1-2-4-3).

Nethza runs in and is within range of the bulette rider; she transfers the hex and throws eldritch blasts. One crit, one miss for 20 damage.

Riglan runs in and looks down the room. To his surprise he sees the bulette and rider along with two hobgoblins in a straight line - well, he knows how this works! - draws the wand, fires lightning for 25. Hobgoblin 1 is knocked out straight away, hobgoblin 4 dodges but is surprisingly taken out anyway, the bulette takes full damage and the rider (apparently a "Burrowshark", not that the party knows that) rolls 15 matching the save and therefore takes 12 damage. Riglan also moves his token closer to Maireagh while keeping the rest of the party in range, stows his wand and ducks behind a pillar.

The first eagle misses the bulette rider twice despite flanking advantage; the second eagle hits twice with advantage, but only does a total of 15 damage (low rolls).

(Stealth rolls: Temo OK, but Riglan nat 1, so unsurprisingly we'll have been heard and this battle's going to get a whole lot more tricky very soon).

Hobgoblin 2 uses martial advantage to attack Maireagh, dropping its longbow due to the close proximity of enemies and drawing a longsword, but surprisingly it misses. It hasn't had a chance to draw a shield yet (Hobgoblin 3, on the other hand, has both shield and sword). Maireagh responds by attacking back, hitting for 10 damage, hitting again for 8 damage and this takes it down. She turns back to face the bulette and rider again; the dog runs around for flanking advantage and does 6 damage to the bulette (it can't reach the rider) then runs back alongside Maireagh. 

Temo aims and fires at the bulette rider. Hits for a good 28 damage (needed the advantage too - first D20 was a 3! Second was 17 so +9 -> 26 -> hits). Very badly injured by this but still up - and now glaring at Temo.

The bulette runs and charges at Temo and Nethza. This triggers opp attacks from the eagles, Maireagh and the dog. The first eagle manages to hit the rider, and does 11 damage - killing it! The second eagle then goes for the bulette but misses; the dog misses it too; but Maireagh hits for 14 damage. The bulette is already on the pounce though, so it's bearing down on Temo and Nethza.

Temo does an amazing dex save (preferred over strength, despite totem advantage on strength saves, due to +8 vs -1 - in any case, rolls nat 20! Takes no damage and rolls to the side). Unfortunately, Nethza fails the save badly (wouldn't matter which she took, dex or str., rolling a 4 and 8 sadly) - taking a whopping 33 damage, but at least the bulette takes 10 cold from the armour. She is knocked prone and loses her hex spell.

Hobgoblin 3 runs up to attack Maireagh, hitting for 8 damage.

Nethza stands back up and, using the hexblade's curse on the bulette and attacks twice with the lightbringer mace. She hits once for 9 damage. Riglan, close to the bulette now, tries a poison spray; the bulette succumbs, for a whopping 19 damage (very high 2d12 roll). He backs away using the pillar as cover against a charge from the creature, but having seen Nethza injured, casts L2 healing word as a bonus action (tho roll is average, so only heals for 12).

At the far end of the hall, we hear a door opening and see someone running out dressed in cult robes with leather armour and scimitar, shouting, "Nartham! What is going on with all this noise?" - and then stutters to quiet as he sees the eagles in the room, one with Nartham in its claws. At this, the door closer much closer to where we came in smashes open and a Duergar runs out, carrying a war pick. It quickly assesses the room and runs in to attack Temo, while growing to a huge size - but misses, Temo squirming out of the way.

Eagle 1 tries to attack the bulette. The beak misses but the talons get purchase, for 11 damage; this kills the bulette. The other eagle flies around and tries for the duergar, coming up to 10ft altitude to go for its head; and does get a hit with the beak for a high roll of 9 damage, but misses badly with the talons (note that the eagles were previously flapping around at 5ft up, so able to move fast but within standard 5ft cube melee attack range; eagle 2 now at 10ft means that while it's above a side entrance doorway, it does not obstruct the door at all).

Now another character runs in from the far end door and starts shouting "Intruders! Intruders!". FML.

Maireagh hits and kills the hobgoblin, runs up and does another 8 damage to the duergar too. She sends the dog over to run at one of the newcomers at the far end of the room. It gets a hit, for a max 11 damage which takes the poor character down straight away! Gruesome. Temo meanwhile disengages from the duergar, runs a short distance away, spins and fires his crossbow, hitting for 24 damage and taking the creature down. He moves a little further to give himself clear sight of the open door (the one closer to where we entered, where the duergar came in); though at the *far* end, a third person comes through that door and attacks the dog, hitting with a scimitar for 3 damage.

A second duergar runs in, under the eagle over the door; it sees the creature, enlarges and attacks but *just* misses; at this a fourth cultist runs into the room at the far end (so there are 3 alive that way, and one enlarged duergar) - but just then, yet another duergar runs in, heads the other way to flank eagle 2 and attacks, unsurprisingly hitting; 13 damage (taking out the temp HP). TWO MORE run out. It's too cramped for them to enlarge, but both engage Maireagh below the the eagles. They both miss.

Nethza uses her last spell slot to bring back hex. She sees Maireagh being surrounded by lots of duergar. She throws hex on closer of the two the large ones attacking the eagle (which is also within range of Maireagh), then throws eldritch blasts at it; just one hits, but with the hex does 20 damage.

Running from the far corner, is a burrowshark - without bulette. It calls for something by name, then looks around as if confused and disappointed and runs further forward (Riglan insight - only 2+5, so he doesn't know what is going on). Now even *more* creatures arise; this one is in the black earth armour.

Riglan tries L3 Wither & Bloom, but only for damage 9 on a poor 3d6 roll. It's enough to take out one large duergar, the other large one takes full damage but isn't killed by it; the small ones both make their saves though so only take 4. Maireagh regains 9 hit points. Riglan also activates his staff. It's not quite what he wanted, but it'll have to do. 

Eagle 1 attacks the remaining big duergar, hitting it twice for 15 total damage. Eagle 2 sees a small duegar in front of it and decides to attack with flanking advantage; this one also hits twice and ends up with 15 damage total too, albeit by quite different rolls.

The dog is under siege somewhat from cultists. It gets hit for 5 damage.

Maireagh pushes in between the cluster of three duergar around her, under the eagle and attacks the injured large one; she hits and takes it down; she then attacks the small injured duegar and takes that down too. One small one remains behind her. She uses her bonus action to ask the dog to attack, and it gets in a hit on one cultist for 4.

Temo manages to get in a good hit on the last duergar, taking it down with 27 damage. He runs around to get a better look at the people deeper into the room, but uses a pillar as cover - stealth roll only total 14 though, so he's probably been spotted.

One cultist runs up close to our party and throws a dagger at Nethza (hitting for 3 damage), while another attacks the dog (but misses). Nethza spins around and before she sees the dagger-throwing cultist, she sees the burrowshark. She transfers the hex and gets one eldritch blast on target for 14 damage. In return it runs up and (while inevitably shit-talking, "I can't believe you killed Nartham - you will taste the blade of Dynath! Know the name of she who sends you to eternal doom" and using its spear in both hands attacks three times. The first hits for 9 damage, the second would hit but Temo uses Silvery Barbs (adv. to Nethza) and the third misses normally. She holds concentration on her hex.

The black earth armoured guy runs alongside and attacks Nethza too, with a morning star. Both attacks miss.

Riglan spots his chance. He runs out of the corner and has a cultist and the two attackers on Nethza lined up - lightning time. 32 damage total. The cultist doesn't stand a chance either way. The black earth guard takes the full 32 and is only just standing. The burrowshark fails too, so 32 there as well.

Eagle 1 flanks the burrowshark and **crits twice**, for 9 and 14 damage (not great rolls, but nice crits!)

Eagle 2 comes back down to 5ft, flying across the width of the room to flank a cultist at the far end near the dog. It **crit fails twice** on the first attack but the second attack does 10 damage and takes down the cultist. It flies up alongside the dog to harry the remaining cultist there.

Meireagh attacks the burrowshark for 8 on the first, but misses the second attack. She tells the dog to attack the cultist - it can use the eagle to run around and flank, hitting for 6 damage. Temo takes his chance to aim and fires at the black earth guard; he hits for a massive 31 points damage, way more than needed; that guy is down. On the far side of the room, the flanked cultist swings wildly at the dog but misses (nat 1). It's not good when these low level people get taken out.

Nethza says - "YOU are the one going to oblivion - but not before you give us some answers!" - she uses maddening hex for 5 damage which it can't resist; this kills it but she brings it back as a spectre. "ANSWERS!" she commands; then casually walks past everything and throws an eldritch blast at the cultist, critting for 22 damage and killing the poor guy.

(We surmise quickly after that the bulettes, which clearly have claws and ability to dig, can burrow in earth but not through stone; the disappointed burrowshark must've expected his mount to back him up, but it must be stuck beyond the doorway and unable to squeeze through, or perhaps just out of earshot?)

We investigate the various bodies. Temo: **Dynath**, total 20; **Nartham**, only 14. On Dynath, a silk purse with a few small gems and coins worth about 25pp all-in; quite a lot! The spectre of Dynath chimes in and tells us to take the amulet. "It could come in useful for you". It's a symbol of the black earth, but made entirely out of mithril. We think Maireagh should try that - dwarf, dwarven city, black earth; sellable, hopefully!

The Dynath spectre explains that they're the two burrowsharks stationed here at the temple. Riglan asks where her bulette might have got to; "I made a mistake. I chained it in the broken hall together with the other bulettes. It was being temperamental. He clearly didn't come to save me! None of this is really what we were promised." Riglan asks if the bulettes are faithful, like a dog, or wild, and might appreciate being freed. "Each of the bulettes here is attuned to one of us. There are four in total - three left, now. It's Ogremoch's power that allows us to control them; it's a deep bond, with telepathic communication, well beyond simple control of beasts." Riglan mentions the bond with the griffons/etc. of the Feathergails. The question is dodged; "They're just a cover for the temple of the Howling Hatred. They just attack us. They're the worst. We captured some of their people in the last raid here. We just need to reestablish a presence above ground to strike back at them. But my time is done - I was promised eternal life; clearly that's not happening." Nethza points out that we can save her from eternal damnation, unlike what probably happened to Nartham. The spectre shrugs; "We are just the more powerful of the servants here." Riglan asks "So who would we need to tackle if we we wanted to fight the leader, or people who would replace the leader?"

"Marloss Urnrayle, the prophet? Noone has seen Marloss in a week. He went into his quarters and has not emerged since. None may disturb him; his gaze can turn you to stone. All it's done since he went into hiding is allow Yarasha and Miraj Vizan to bicker openly. Miraj is, after all, the right hand of Marloss but Yarasha wields more influence because of the Miraj; she is a Mud Sorcerer; she hides in her laboratory most of the time and cares not for running things. Too obsessed with her magic."

Riglan asks, "So there's Marloss, Miraj as right-hand, Yarasha who might perhaps try to take Miraj's place. Anyone else powerful enough to run things here?" "No-one with the desire to. There is the Etin Droog-Nobb but they're usually too busy fighting amongst themselves and aren't really a member of the cult. And there's Xharva Deem - I would not mess with her - she doesn't get involved; she's beholden to Marloss; it is hard to explain. They have a contract. She makes the weapons. The duergar follow her - she brought them here." "If Marloss was gone, would she be free of the contract?" "I don't know."

Temo doesn't find anything interesting on Nartham; as he does it, Dynath says "Don't bother searching him. We're not supposed to carry wealth. My silk purse was a conceit - perhaps that was why nobody came to my rescue?" Temo says, "No, the rescue was a false promise. You've done right by the balance of the world by speaking to us now."

"You will find the broken hall through there - " and points to the big open passage at the end - "but the mud sorcerer's quarters are nearby. Our quarters are there -" points to the other side door they'd emerged from - "but nothing of value there. Yarasha's burrow is north of our barracks, behind the cave-in. And there are patrols wandering around these halls."

We look through the door closer to the grand entrance, the "duergar room". The eagles are on guard in the main area as the door would be a slow and awkward squeeze. We find barracks with an extended corridor down one end leading to the arrow slit Temo found beforehand; this was why he heard voices - echoing down, but didn't see silhouettes. We bring all the bodies in here, except the bulette which gets rolled down the slope off the bridge. Hopefully enough to pass causal inspection if not a detailed search. Blood everywhere, so we take time with the cleaning stone.

We do take a quick look into the barracks; we can see various doors from there to other parts of the complex as Dynath described.

Back in the main hall, Maireagh pulls out a rope and touches the end to her tools, then does something with those and her shield and the rope levitates up. There's a strange shimmering effect at the top, which just touches the roof 20ft up. She says to Nethza, "can you please get Dynath to watch the door just in case?" and positions the rope so we can see what's in the room. Riglan asks the eagles to hide outside the main broken doors, just in case we night to fight before their time is up. Maireagh then climbs up into a shimmering portal; asks for the dog to be handed up; we all climb in turn and enter a room with enough space for maybe 8 people, so the five of us fit easily. Her magic makes it look like her old fireplace. She pulls up the rope leaving just a small window we can see down out of looking into the main hall.

Very, very cool spell! (Rope Trick spell). It only lasts an hour but that's all we need. Riglan re-summons the spider to give it another 4 hours, since the rest will give him the ability back in due course; this means he has his friendly spy available for 3 hours afterwards, which could be handy to help avoid patrols. The spider thinks it's a good idea to go head on the roof of corridors, especially to help look around corners. Between that and Dynath's description of the rough lay of the land, we're in better shape than might have otherwise been the case.

We guess that it's probably only around midday.

We chat and think that probably heading towards this "broken hall" could be interesting since if we're going to tackle anyone, the sorcerer sounds difficult and is perhaps the first thing to clear, especially since it's relatively close by and we have a very good idea of how to get there.

Eventually we finish resting, descend the rope, Maireagh pulls it down from the roof and coils it away, Riglan gives his spider scritches on his shoulder and we head towards the large open corridor at the end of the hall, pretty much looking for a fight with Miraj. The spider scouts ahead on the roof, in particular looking at corners.

About 30ft down is a cross-junction. On the right is a short corridor and cave-in. Forward it continues on to what looks like a hall. To the left is a short corridor and ornate door, which looks like it pivots in the middle. Maireagh recognises the design.

Intrigued momentarily by this "broken hall" Riglan asks the spider to venture ahead. There's a pillar, with the entrance on one side with the hall extending far to the left. It's huge though. It's split down the middle by a big chasm - it spans beyond the hall, well beyond what the spider can see. Some pillars are intact, others are broken. Three bulettes are here. Two are tied to pillars on the near side and a third is tied on the far side, across the chasm, is tied to a third pillar. The chasm is about 30ft wide.

So, not wanting to make a tonne of noise fighting bulettes, we exchange looks, do the nod thing, and walk towards the ornate door.

Riglan helps Maireagh push the door open. Humid air rolls out. We all walk in. It's a 50x50ft chamber with the flagstones prised out of the middle revealing bare earth that's been turned into mud. All around the perimeter are huge structures that look like large statues; some are broken, others intact. They're dwarves, but 10ft tall. Standing in the centre is Miraj. She wears robes of purple, brown and blue. She's not levitating; she's stood right in the mud. She's in the middle of some kind of magic; strands are coming off her and connect with one of the statues.

She turns sharply seeing Maireagh in the lead with the amulet and says, "How DARE you come in here?! Who are you? You must be new. Rule number 1! Never, ever come into my laboratory!" - she flings a hand to one side and Maireagh is sprayed with mud. She is unimpressed! -  "They let anyone in now. Even cows!"

Riglan quickly looks around the room. He notices that the statues have maces or other weapons for hands. The ornate door had a similar carving - dwarf with what seemed to be maces rather than hands. Well, of those that are intact; two are completely crumbled. Some others look partially melted and one seems to be completely missing. The one that Miraj was working on was partly melting too.

She narrows her eyes... "Who sent you? Are you... Are you here to *kill* me?" and Riglan says, "well, if we believed you were leaving for good and definitely not coming back, there'd be no need." She says, "I knew it! You're one of Yarsha's peons!" and Riglan shrugs, avoiding answering but intentionally not denying it. **"You fools!"**

Initiative:

* Nethza: 21 (knew we were heading for a fight!)
* Temo: 15 (near the back but sling warning goes off)
* Riglan: 12 (too busy thinking about maybe getting Miraj to help attack Yarsha)
* Spectre: 7 (It's at the back, almost round a corner)
* Maireagh: 6 (distracted by the disturbing defaced and ruined statues)

Nethza transfers the hex onto Miraj, runs into the room and throws two eldritch blasts. Both hit for 12 and 19, big hits to start. Miraj responds, calling out some magical word - and one of the statues starts to move. Riglan thinks, "Yep, I knew it" - some kind of 10ft tall stone golem. Miraj pulls her staff apart somehow; it bursts into four mud mephits. Then she disappears! Invisibility spell, straight off.

Temo casts Nathair's Mischief. (D4 -> 1). He doesn't know if Miraj has been affected. He sees no visual effects and hears no giggles, so assumes charm; he says, "Come now, why not play nice, be visible and all hug each other?" - Persuasion 19 - the mephits *all* seem affected because they turn to look at each other, but there's no sign of Miraj yet; it might take a moment for her invisibility spell to drop? Temo shouts at people to avoid the mephits for now.

Riglan shouts, "I'll have to turn into a bat to find her" - wildshapes to a giant bat and sees Miraj just out of Temo's spell range. He flies over to the far corner of the room at 5ft to within melee range and flaps and squeaks a lot!

The spectre floats in and attacks the golem, but can't get a hit in.

Three of the mephits hug each other. But one flies over to Temo and to his annoyance, tries to hug *Temo* instead. Temo briefly hesitates then hugs it back. Awww.

The golem moves around the spectre and close to Maireagh. There's a strange pulse of energy that seems to tug at us like gravity, slowing us; the three mephits over the pool, the spectre and Maireagh all mostly strongly affected. Maireagh uses a flash of genius to resist; the spectre succumbs; two of the mephits surprisingly succeed, but the third is slowed. So now the golem moves forward and attacks Maireagh, but misses.

Maireagh moves around to look at where Riglan is flapping and casts Faerie Fire. She doesn't avoid it, so is visible and glowing. Riglan is in range too and rolls dex 16, which as himself would've failed but as the big, agile bat, he keeps clear and avoids inadvertently being an easier-to-hit lit-up target himself. The dog is called in to the golem and asked to attack - surprisingly it does hit and what's more, does so for its maximum 11 damage (d8->8 + 3).

Nethza shouts "thank you!" to Maireagh and maddening-hexes Miraj, causing 5 damage. She hits twice with eldritch blasts too, for 14 and 14 damage (but no crits).

We've been doing surprisingly well but now Miraj gets a moment to act in retaliation. She takes a step back - Riglan tries an opp. attack which does hit, but for only 4 damage. Miraj raises her hands and a great wide wall of stone rises up out of the ground, sealing up the whole of the back of the room.

Temo's magic changes to floating molasses - he shouts, "Oh, the mephits are on us again!", he disengages from his hug, runs and fires at the golem, hitting for 28 damage.

Riglan turns back into himself. He pulls out his Transmute Rock L5 scroll and manages to cast it. He targets the back half of the room including partly the golem (which is magical and thus unaffected); the statues, floor, and even the back wall and Miraj's wall start to slop down into mud, before Riglan hastily drops the spell. Miraj, thinking that the wall was going to fall on her, drops her own spell in defence, before things freeze again.

"You are a mud sorcerer as well? You're not one of ours!" she shouts. "Wait. No. Has Olhydra forsaken me too? Who do you serve?!" - Riglan insight 20! + 5. Miraj, for a moment, thought that *Olhydra*, water, as a *mud* sorcerer might have forsaken her. She's realised we aren't sent by Yarsha. Riglan points at the spectre and says, not that he expects to be believed, "As Dynath and Nartham can attest, you have been lied to by a false prophet. Unrayle has been fooled by the Elemental Eye, which seeks only for power for itself. We serve none of those false gods." "FALSE gods?! Ogremock and Olyhdra are not false gods. They are the source of my power. Clearly you, too, wield that power; and yet you are not one of ours. But you bear our symbol. And you have killed Dynath?"

Finally she realises. "YOU! You are the meddling fools that we've heard about! You're the reason why there's been no contact from the water temple! Ha. Marloss is expecting you. That's why he's gone into hiding." Riglan says, "Yeah, he ran away" "Yes, he's left us and abandoned us - I always knew that you have to rely on your own strength. Nobody else will look after you." Riglan repeats, "We cannot risk this temple or its cult being restarted under the influence of the Eye. If you vow to leave, you can practice your power anywhere else you like. Otherwise, we fight." "You don't understand. Without Olydra and Ogremok, I am *nothing*. NOTHING!"

She doesn't think she has a choice; so the fight goes on. At this, the spectre of Dynath moves to flank the golem and tries once more to hit, but once more can't quite get a hit.

Maireagh attacks the golem with advantage, hitting once for 14 points and critting but awful rolls so only 11 damage on the crit. The dog has another go at the golem and does hit, for 9.

Now the mephits start to act, but Temo's spell does slow them down. The first mephit manages to try and attack the spectre, using its mud breath, but this has no effect on the spectre. The next flies to flank and the third gets to Maireagh, again using its breath; Maireagh does not succumb to its effects though (DC11 saving). The final mephit flies in and attacks Maireagh with flanking advantage but misses.

Now the golem, unable to repeat its slowing effects, slams at Maireagh and hits but Temo distracts with Silvery Barbs; this makes it miss. Advantage to Nethza since she's about to attack next (top of round). Nethza uses her mace to attack the mephit closest to her, which is flanking Maireagh; she hits twice, for 9 and 7.

Miraj moves sideways, closer to the centre of the far wall to get a better look at the room and then, to our dismay, polymorphs into a giant grab, growing in the space to end up in melee range with Riglan.

Temo sees this just as his spell changes back to charm - only mephit 1 falls but he suggests they fly to the far corner of the room and hang out. Now he sees the crab, still it with Faerie Fire so fires his bow, hitting for 25 damage; Miraj holds her spell.

Riglan is point blank in the face of a giant crab; he recognises the spell, so casts L4 dispel magic in turn, to try and get rid of the creature. A bemused Miraj reappears! With his bonus action he activates his staff.

The spectre sinks into the floor, disappearing without anyone having a chance to get in an opportunity attack. It reappears by Miraj and attacks. It hits! 10 necrotic damage is dealt.

Maireagh is surrounded. She swings at the mephit 4 behind her (the one Nethza just went for) and hits for 12 damage, taking it down. A burst of sticky mud flies out. Nethza avoids it; Maireagh gets coated, but manages to break free (instead of having a 2nd attack).

Mephit 1 dutifully flies to the corner of the room! Mephit 2 flies around and attacks Maireagh, but misses despite flanking advantage. Mephit 3 also misses, surprisingly. The golem now tries to slow everyone again - the dog, Nethza and Maireagh are in range. Maireagh fails and is slowed, the dog succeeds and Nethza is also slowed. The golem now attacks Maireagh, hitting for 21 damage. Maireagh holds the Faerie Fire (nat 20 save).

Nethza is slow, but switches to a green fire blade on Lightbringer to try and at least do decent damage if she can hit anything. She hits a mephit and the damage spreads out dealing 10 to the nearby golem and 9 to mephit 2. She manages to shake the Slow spell.

Miraj is getting worried. She sees the spectre on top of her; she can't do much but decides to try and create some kind of escape route, casting maximum strength Shatter in the midst of the golem, mephits, Maireagh, Nethza etc. - con saves all round, DC 15, else 7d8 damage... But Nethza has her reaction back having shaken Slow, so tries to Counterspell. Maireagh is slowed so can't help. She uses inspiration from long ago at Happy Hall. Nat 20!

Miraj can't really believe it - the wall, the crab, the shatter... She tries to run, the spectre getting an opportunity attack (still with advantage), hitting for 12 - "No Miraj. This ends here. Are you not listening?" says Dynath, and sort of pulls her soul out of her body, saying "no - enough - *enough!*". Miraj's body falls lifeless to the ground.

Temo aims and fires at the golem. He hits for 24. Meanwhile, his spell no longer seems to be affecting anything. At this, the Golem shatters into small pieces of rubble on the ground. He's not sure if it was his hit, or the demise of Miraj.

Riglan: Perception total 24. He notices that as Miraj died and golem fell, the mephits suddenly look surprised or startled; then a maniacal attitude comes over them. Insight 7, he has no idea what this means. It's as if they snapped out of some control spell. He shouts, "watch out for the mephits, something weird going on there!" and throws fire at mephit 1 in the corner. He crits! Damage 16.

The spectre flies up behind a mephit 3 flanking Maireagh and attacks with his own flanking advantage, hitting for 13 damage. Maireagh, no longer slowed after the golem fell, asks the dog to attach mephit 2 behind her first; it crits! 17 damage, but it's still up. Maireagh swings at that mephit too, hitting and killing it; it explodes as before. Maireagh dodges this time but the dog and Nethza don't, getting sprayed with rapidly-hardening mud; Maireagh continues attacking though, hitting mephit 3 in front of her for 8 damage.

Mephit 1 flies in from the corner and attacks the spectre, hitting for 5 damage. Mephit 3 now retaliates against Maireagh but misses. Nethza transfers her hex onto the the less-damaged mephit and throws an eldritch blast - but it's two bolts, in a single attack, despite the restraint and despite the disadvantage this gives, deals enough damage to take down both mephits. The hilarious end to the battle leaves us all soaked in mud. Maireagh in particular looks more like one of the statues than herself. Riglan comes up and at Maireagh's muffled request gets the cleaning stone out of her bag, having prise the bag open; soon enough everyone is clean.

We push shut the door for the moment. We think a short rest can be risked. Amazingly, despite the high level battle, only Maireagh got injured by the golem, so she rests up while Temo and Riglan investigate Miraj and the room. Riglan drops in a totem to give everyone some temp HP too, since he's going to rest after investigating and will get the ability back. Likewise, he re-instantiates his fey spider friend.

The investigation isn't so good, Temo and Riglan only getting a 5,5+9 -> 14 so they don't find much in the room. Maireagh grumbles about them being a bit useless and investigates Miraj with Nethza's help. It's actually quite difficult due to all the mud and battle damage.

There's a wooden chest stowed under a work table; there are some stone tablets with drawings and etchings on them; and some papyrus scrolls that she's written out with experimental notes. One of them has many circles and "success!" - "Sent into the Hall of the Sentinels to guard against incursions from the other temples", under that, "I managed to divert Marloss' attention away from the Broken Hall; for now, I can still traverse the tunnels to the old brewery unseen."

We realise that the missing statue that we'd noticed in the room is another golem that's on guard somewhere. 

Miraj bears the symbols of both earth and water cults. She really did think she'd harnessed the power of both gods. She's annoyed that the earth cult won't work with the water cult; she claims to "have convinced Gar, but Marloss will not have any of it". At this Riglan thinks for a minute, then says to the spectre, "How would we recognise Marloss if we walked into a room he's in, and how close would we have to be before turning to stone?" "You would easily recognise him - he has a hideous countenance, a curse for his vanity in his human youth. His hair is of writhing snakes; but you should not look at him. Avert your gaze."

In the wooden chest are strange black crystals, 9 of them, non-magical but worth 50gp each by Maireagh's reckoning (we add 45pp to save faffing with sales grift later); 220gp; and a potion. Maireagh spends time on Identify with it. A potion of aqueous form! She hands it to Riglan who stows it in his pouch, but we think it might be so situational and strange as to be more worthwhile as a sale item than something to use. We almost miss it, but at the last moment spot a potion of greater healing in a small pouch worn by Miraj.

The hour passes and we're ready to try again.

Riglan sends the spider ahead along the roof and we go out back into the main hall; we're aiming for the makeshift barracks that we were told were near Yarsha's burrow. The Dynath spectre points to the end of a long corridor past the barracks; we proceed along, with Dynath pointing to the right as we travel, indicating that the burrow is behind that wall and we realise we need to loop around via the corridors somehow.

Near the end of the corridor we see a room opening out. The spider scuttles ahead to check. Hallways lead either side (left/right from our perspective) but they turn, so it can't see far. We move forward cautiously. Beyond the hallways the room extends back in a kind of wide alcove shape. Parts of the stone have collapsed but it's mostly intact; it looks like this used to be an intentional grand intersection of some kind. There are inset smaller alcoves that look like things used to stand there. Instead, though, the crumbled rock and stone has been reshaped at the end of the room into a huge statue of Ogremock - something between an earth elemental and a demon. Dynath tells us that Marloss shaped it himself with magic.

To the right, Denath indicates passages to the mess hall, kitchen, Room Of The Sentinel, Yarsha's burrow and Marloss' own area / temple. To the left are halls leading to the Southern Barracks and forge; the etin is that way too. There's even a torturer's chamber (!), armoury and well; more damage and less control / anarchy down there. The Bleeding Stone Shrine is connected by hallways and pretty much behind the wall against which the statue stands.

So we focus on the burrow and quietly make our way up the north (right-hand) hallway. There's a network of junctions here, but the most interesting is another right-hand turn taking us back towards the burrow. The spider goes through a small doorway. It's a mess hall, the burrow apparently beyond. Spider perception, 13. Three trestle tables and stacks of crates with a familiar mark - a sunrise over fields of gold - we've seen this with the stolen goods of the water cult; goods from Goldenfields. A crate is open. Two black earth guards are eating at the middle table. Three younger cultists seem to be working in an adjacent kitchen. One brings a bowl of food to one of the guards just as he throws a dagger at a blue and white feathered cape smeared with blood pinned to the wall, which has other daggers stuck in it. The two guards laugh; the other takes a swig of a drink, throws the dagger but misses. The first guard laughs and a cultist does too - the guard accosts him; "What are you laughing at? Get back in the kitchen!"

Riglan whispers the details to his party. It's not a room we can sneak through and a fight there would clearly alert whoever is in Yarsha's burrow. We might be able to avoid conflict with the three cultist kids, if we can scare them enough into just leaving. The spectre would help.

Riglan disconnects from the spider. 20+8 perception. There's a strange low rumble through the stone and a wailing noise echoing along the corridors. We don't know where it's coming from. One of the corridors rumbles more loudly. Then the whole party feels tremors shaking the hallways and cavern; bits of rock and dust fall from cracks in the ceiling; we freeze waiting to see what it is; everything goes quiet; and then a moment later, people in the room beyond the door resume their conversation. The spectre shrugs!

Riglan beckons Nethza over. He whispers quietly to her about his idea of trying to scare those three young cultists into just running for want of more waste of life. He says he did hear and did not ignore when Dynath mentioned a torture room, and reassures Nethza that this will be "on the list" when we've got rid of Yarsha.

So after our murmuring subsides, we have no better plan than just marching in, with Maireagh in front, Riglan on disguise self, Temo sneaking and Nethza + spectre on intimidation duty.

Maireagh walks in with Riglan in tow, around to the middle table and turns to face the guards. Riglan looks like one of the low-level acolytes we've already seen, to appear less threatening. Temo Stealth 17+11 sneaks in the top of the room, behind the guards and into a corner. Netzha and the spectre follow us in.

We try to convince them that they should give things up and just leave but unfortunately do not succeed (persuasion roll nat. 3, so it wouldn't matter who was speaking; we don't get an advantage for the spectre because we're just clearly not really cultists - Nethza especially - and it would've potentially been a disadvantage roll otherwise). The pretty quickly realise we're intruders and draw weapons.

Initiative:

* Temo 25
* Riglan 16
* Spectre 12
* Nethza 9
* Maireagh 6

Riglan notices that the two guards have slightly different armour; one wears splint armour that seems to be made almost of stone with a glave by his side - Riglan suspects that this is a significantly more hardy guard. The other has a mace resting on the table; no shield though.

Temo perception 13, just enough to notice the glave, sees it moving more quickly and has better armour; he aims and fires at that one. He hits but only for 19 damage (bad rolls). That guard now acts. He grabs the glave in one hand, turns around and sees Nethza - then spots Temo in the corner. He casts Shatter, hitting the spectre, Nethza and Temo. Temo con save 2+0 :-/ - takes 10 damage (mercifully low roll on 4d8) - Nethza saves and holds her hex, the spectre saves too. 5 damage each. The guard - actually, a priest we think maybe, given the spell casting - is swinging a glave around, and we realise it has a 10ft reach and could get across the table. Now the other guard acts, grabbing his morningstar, jumps onto the table, looks around and makes a swing for Maireagh - assessing her as the hardier, given she was talking and Riglan looks like an acolyte. First hit is a crit (Temo too far to distract), 15 damage! Second attack hits too for 7, but Maireagh deflects with a shield spell.

Riglan lets his staff fall into the crook of his arm as he realises the two guards are a lot hardier than expected; he uses the lightning wand. It hits both people though table man dodges a bit only takes half. The priest is almost killed by it. The strike carries on across the room and destroys the chest that Temo was hiding behind.

One of the cultists run out of the adjoining kitchen. It comes up and attacks Maireagh but misses. A second runs around the far table and gets close to Riglan. The spectre promptly floats up next to Riglan and attacks that second cultist, hitting and taking it down straight away. Nethza is over on the other side of the room near where we came in, with tables in the way; she transfers the hex onto table man and throws eldritch blasts, one each at the guard and priest. The priest is hit for 14 damage - and that takes him down. The table guy is hit for 11 (much lower rolls despite hex). She runs around the table to block the exit.

Maireagh takes a swing at the cultist who attacked her; she kills that one outright out then takes a swing at table guy. This hits too, for 13 damage, knocking the guard off the table - dead before he hits the floor.

Finally a third cultist comes out, promptly opens the door we think goes to the burrow and runs inside. Bugger.

Temo sneaks quickly up to the corridor and can see the running cultist (stealth 11+11 vs cultist perception 19). He gets a hit, unexpectedly, sadly taking the cultist down immediately too, the body sliding into the room - at least they didn't get told how many of us there were. There's at least one person in the room that Temo could almost see via shadows but not reach despite sharpshooter (essentially, full cover) and they perceive where the arrow came from (their perception roll nat 20!), so rather than running in more, Temo ducks back against the wall in the mess hall.

Riglan flicks his staff back into his hand and manages to slide across two tables (14, 15 athl. roll) so he can see down the corridor and just conjures two beasts almost blindly into the room. Two tigers appear! He drops them in front of the beds (the figure Temo couldn't hit is actually just between two beds and they're right in front, but Riglan doesn't actually know it). Riglan also has presence of mind & just enough time to activate his staff.

* Tiger initiative: 13

We hear someone shouting, "What is the *meaning* of this? Tigers?! Who let tigers in here and why is there a *dead peon* in my doorway? Are we - we're under attack! This is ridiculous" - we assume the voice is Yarsha. Riglan sees a hand spring out of the ground behind the two tigers (Max. Earthen Grasp) which reaches for tiger 2; strength save shit roll, 5+3; the tiger is restrained and takes 7 damage. 

In response tiger 1, unable to reach the speaker and besides, only knowing about the person in front of it via Riglan's ability to see the room, attacks that first person. Rolls 13 and 16 but both miss. Seeing this, tiger 2 tries to break the restraint, strength 17+3 - it escapes, backing away a little, snarling at the hand and strange hard-to-hit cult person that the other tiger was struggling with.

The spectre travels through walls and ends up right next to Yarsha, but that's it's full turn. "Yarsha! It's me!"

The black earth guard next to the tigers attacks. It swings at tiger 1 then 2. It somehow misses tiger 1 but does hit tiger 2 for 9 damage. Nethza runs up and spies another person near tiger 1, so transfers the hex onto them. She then shouts "Yarsha!" and casts a psychic lance spell; a bolt of energy jets out of her stone and bends around the room. This means Nethza now knows that the two people she can see are *not* Yarsha, but Yarsha must be in the room. Yarsha fails her save (d20->4). She is incapacitated for a moment and takes 32 damage! Very high damage roll (7d6->6,6,5,5,4,3,3). It's really interesting as Yarsha can't see the spell coming; the spell Nethza worked required only  a name; Yarsha can't counterspell.

Nethza says, "Well, that's all I've got!"

The other guard in the room (the one Nethza hexed) attacks tiger 1 but amazingly, misses twice! He frets out loud that he must have been cursed by a witch...

Maireagh and the dog full-on dash into the burrow room, which is getting crowded. Turns out there are a few beds, a corner cave-in and not really all that much space, though there's a exit leading somewhere dark to the north.

Temo runs in, reaching the corner of the room. Seeing the injured tiger close by, he aims at the cult guy who is in melee with them and hits for a big 26 damage. "Argh!" he says (!), "It's the halfling!" - he'd seen Temo before when the acolyte cultist first ran into the room.

Riglan comes up the corridor and from just outside sees Yarsha and the other guy, Yarsha reeling from Nethza's attack gripping her head so figures that this is Yarsha. He's a bit disadvantaged by the mess in the room but casts Wither & Bloom to get both of them; 2d6 -> only 6; Yarsha takes a full 6 but the other guard only takes 3. Maireagh gets healed a little (only 4) too, though. He also drops the bear totem in over the room; everyone is lifted back to +13 temp HP, including the tigers. It'll help avoid the spell grasp.

Yarsha can't act; she's incapacitated! The grasp spell flounders.

Tiger 1 spins around and goes for the guard behind it. Rolls 8, 1, so misses both. Tiger 2 continues trying to get the guard that hurt it, trying to shove him to the ground; strength 18 against 14, so the guard falls prone. Now the tiger leans in with a bite attack with advantage and succeeds, doing a high 12 damage (d10->9).

The spectre attacks and hits Yarsha, dealing 9 damage; but her body shakes off any other effects (con save succeeded). The spectre floats around behind.

The prone guard jumps up and attacks tiger 2 twice. The first wildly misses, but the second critically hits for 10 damage as the guard focuses and finds his balance.

Nethza runs in, *teleports* behind the person she hexed (i.e. between the guard near Yarsha and Yarsha herself) and attacks Yarsha with the mace but with green flame activated. Unfortunately despite advantage she misses! Oh rats... A more disorientating teleport than expected. The guard attacks Nethza, but the guard also misses, twice. Disorientating for both of them, it seems.

Maireagh runs up into the fray, diagonally across from Nethza between the guard and Yarsha. She attacks Yarsha with flanking advantage from the spectre, rolls 1 & 20! So a crit hit, for 16 damage. Yarsha casts a shield but it's not enough. Second attack is a 21 to hit but this misses, because of the shield. The dog, meanwhile, over by the tiger tries to attack the guard there but misses too.

Temo recognises the shield on Yarsha, so knows not to use magic missiles. He tries with crossbow but misses badly (rolls a 4). He tries to duck and hide behind a bed. Stealth 27.

Riglan throws all he's got left; L4 Wither & Bloom. Yarsha takes the full 18 damage (good roll, 4d6) and this takes her down. The guard also just fails, looking very injured. Nobody takes healing as hit die are hard to come by!

Tiger 1 tries to attack the guard flanked by Nethza. Crit hit with the claws! But shit roll - 1 and 2 - only 6 damage. Boo. The claws hit too, non-crit but alright roll; 10 damage. The other tiger tries to hit its own guard, but no advantage. Crit again! This time, it gets 12 damage in. This takes down the guard. No need for claws.

Nethza uses maddening hex - and that's enough, before she does anything else, to take down the guard. He was far more badly injured than we realised.

We elect to swiftly clean up as before - but first we check that northern passage. At the end is a little ledge and a narrow path that weaves along. Temo scuttles up to see where it goes. It seems to go all the way around the cavern to a window; he tries to peek stealthily inside (19 stealth). He sees it's more of an arrow slit, which seems to have some kind of secret door; some way in perhaps. Inside is a sumptuous chamber, but dark - he needs his goggles. Beautiful tapestries, a huge bed covered in pillows, fine carved wooden furniture, lots of cushions, shelves and tables, pedestals with sculptures and urns and vases - it's actually a bit much! He figures it MUST be Unrayle's chamber, given that Dynath said it was in this direction. He realises he can sneak inside and since it looks empty, he does so.

Investigation total 26. He finds lots - so scuttles back, says "Won't be a minute!" and then grabs Maireagh's bag as they're all busy cleaning up the bodies, and runs back along. Nethza insists on coming along. Temo climbs back through and examines the spoils.

* A beautiful tapestry hanging against a wall - a flying dragon which seems to be woven with real gold and silver as far as his darkvision can make out. It's astonishing. He uses a chair to climb up, gently lower it and roll it up.
* Lying on the bed is an embroidered silk robe that's way to big, but exquisite. Too big for him but it'd fetch a good price.
* A very ornate carved lyre that he thinks might be faintly magical.
* In a beautiful gem encrusted bowl is a small collection of jewels.
* Pride of place on a mannequin is a strongly magical suit of eleven chain.

It's all bagged up, and back they go. "What's with the grin? What you have you put in my bag?" asks Mairegh. Temo looks up, Puss In Boots eyes, and just says, "*EVERYTHING!*" Nethza rolls her eyes and says "probably worth lots, but Maireagh, take a look at this Lyre and chain..."

Maireagh recognises the mithril chain straight away. A +1 chain shirt that could be worn by anyone, but is too heavy for Temo sadly. The lyre needs Identify; it is a Lyre of Building. Only bards can use it. Temo is a little disappointed, but still, they're beautiful things and he's well aware that goods can be sold or exchanged for other interesting or beautiful things too. More to the point, he now has them and Unrayle doesn't. It's his Robin Hood complex at work.

Maireagh had herself found a few things in the room while Temo was away. She found an iron coffer hidden under a bed containing two empty vials and two full with some kind of poison; she checks with magic; they're a concentrated poison harvested from spiders. It's the kind of thing you'd use to poison people in their food. There's also jewellery; 6 obsidian flakes tied onto a platinum bracelet - she thinks it is worth 150gp. There is a loose leaf journal that we take some of too. A quick read shows that Yarsha was, unsurprisingly, annoyed at being relegated to a gate guard post next to the _kitchen_ of all places; the "earth Genashi bitch" was selected as Marloss' second-in-command. "She's not even fully committed to this temple. I've set my spies to keep an eye on her and she keeps running off into that tunnel that goes to the water temple. I just need to harvest two more vials and I'll have enough to kill her."

Having hidden the bodies and cleaned the rooms up, we realise we shouldn't linger any longer here in case people come to the mess hall and realise that things are amiss. We sneak back to Miraj's mud room instead, set up some food and take a long rest. Before sleeping, Nethza thanks Dynath's spectre for holding up her part of the bargain and releases her spirit.



## DAY 102

We awaken having kinda rested alright in the mud sorcerer's damaged room. Riglan says he'd like to head back to Unrayle's statue then South, given mention of a torture room or prison or somesuch. Worth making sure those are cleared out at least.

We open the door and look out into the hallway. We turn right and head out, Riglan leading. We get to the main hall and there are four people there. Two are dressed as acolytes, two in plate. Riglan turns to Nethza with a look of "these guys should leave", and Nethza tries some intimidation but it doesn't quite work. They draw weapons.

Initiative:

* Temo: 15
* Maireagh: 15
* Riglan: 15
* Nethza: 10

The two acolytes run up to attack Nethza but miss. Temo aims and fires at one of the farther away guards. He hits but only for 18. Marieagh moves past Temo alongside an acolyte, hitting each once and taking down both of them! The dog runs past Riglan and gets into melee range with the thus-uninjured guard, hitting for max damage - 11.

Riglan runs forward and throws flame but misses (nat 4 + 10). Nethza runs up alongside the second guard by the dog and uses the green flame blade version of Lightbringer. She hits, dealing 14 to that guard with the one a little further getting 11 damage from the flame. Now the guards act; the closer one to Nethza attacks her but both attacks miss. The other runs around the dog and tries the same; the dog imposes disadvantage on the first attack which misses (and would otherwise have hit) - the second attack misses too.

Temo runs up and fires again. Pointless crit, and a ridiculous damage roll! 2d6+6 -> 18 and with sneak x 2, 48 points of damage. The guard is obliterated.

Maireagh runs up to the hapless remaining guard and attacks with flanking advantage. Surprisingly the guard is dodging like crazy, having seen what happened to the others. Maireagh's second attack fails too! In both cases the high rolls were just 1 short of AC. The dog runs around and takes advantage of the distracted guard, hitting for 9 damage. Riglan tries for flame again, 6+10 -> 16 which is not enough to hit. This guy is slippery. Nethza (with a barely-disguised roll of her eyes at the others of us missing) now attacks and hits, taking the guard down.

Temo investigation: 17. These four are carrying a lot, surprisingly; and have with them a key, which looks similar to Helenray's top gate key. Around 80gp worth of assorted currency, tradable trinkets and gems. The acolytes had backpacks with bits of equipment. **It looks like they were another set of four to head up and attack the monastery.** We wish we could more respectfully deal with them, but _tempus fugit_ and we roll them into the cavern to join their friends.

To avoid further encounters, Riglan calls the spider and we get to the big statue. For now, we avoid further Northern investigation and head South. These corridors are more noisy - the noises we heard before, or similar to them. Things are a bit more damaged and dirty. The corridor almost immediately has two 90 degree left-right corners again, with a door in the "kink" part; noises behind. Riglan sets in the spider above the door. It's a clean, neatly organised room with 6 double bunks against two walls and a large wooden table with 6 chairs around it near the centre. There's an iron stove with firewood and a fire and two small arrow slits in a wall. There are five people inside; two lying in bed the other three are sat around a table, one looking bored and two playing cards. Crossbows are set up on a stand near the arrow slits. They're in the South-West corner of the room, so not an area we think we might have been through yet.

We know what to look out for so we creep past for now.

Further on, Riglan (perception 22) sees a big chasm ahead but notices a ledge going all along its nearest edge. There are sounds echoing out, but neither Riglan nor spider can't see the bottom; it goes up too, around 60ft up. Riglan thinks that this is the same chasm he saw through the spider in the big hall with the bulettes, but spots a bridge and we head towards it, on guard against any more flying attacks or similar.

Close to the bridge we clearly hear sounds of clanging - Maireagh recognises it as a blacksmith sound. There's a red glow of a forge up ahead around a corner. We proceed cautiously to see where this leads, spider ahead to stop us getting any nasty surprises. The bridge climbs up slightly to the far side of the chasm. As we climb up we see, 30-40ft away maybe, what seems to be the edge of a forge; the wall that might've contained the room it is in has fallen away into the chasm.

We're trying to be quiet but awful rolls - Temo 4+11, Riglan with advantage - a 2 and 1! So we're not quiet... As we get closer we can see two duergar on the forge and a large, 10ft tall, very muscular lady who seems to be made out of pure rock (it's a kind of earth version of a Djinn - a Dao). She swings a huge hammer onto the anvil with the duergar holding a sword in tongs. At our noisy approach, they stop and look over. We freeze! The look at us and kind of squint; the Dao observes us for a while; Riglan goes, "uuh, hi?" - and then the Dao just carries on hammering, so the duergar do too. Riglan remembers being told about the person "beholden" to Marloss - Xharva Deem - the weapon maker.

Shrug. Weird, but we were told that to the South that it wasn't very cult-controlled, so this seems kinda harmless for now? We cross the bridge! Another ledge on this side of the chasm, leading into an E-W corridor with a branch to the left (Southwards). Riglan sends the spider. At the end of the hallway is a doorway, but it's dark here. It sees that there's a door with crumbling masonry and a big sign on the door painted on, saying "Noorbs Rum. Keep ot. Drug." - oooh kay, that is I guess the Etin then, Droog-Nobb. So we'll keep out. The spider comes back and we continue ahead along the corridor - West.

The corridor opens out into a very dimly lit, large hall. As we enter we see that the walls are higher, maybe 25ft. We can see it's about 40ft wide with some of the southern section collapsed, with some of a room beyond visible through a crack. In the middle of the room is a 20ft wide, marble, rectangular basin. We approach; it's 4ft deep maybe, just gently rising out of it and draining off the side.

There's a red glow of light from spilling under a heavy stone door to the right; distant clanking - the forge. There are various paintings and carvings, along with the decayed remains of the heads of beasts hanging on the wall. Almost like a hunting lodge. Maireagh starts checking the walls and looking for things she can read; soon, she calls us over. "Look! This room is a Tyar Besil great hall; these depictions show orchards, fields, ploughing, vineyards... And hunting lodges... Farming pastoral life. It seems this room celebrates the over-land kingdom of Besilmir which they had to give up to come down here. They must have felt very connected to it - this whole hall is a tribute to that life". "That must the well that Dynath mentioned," says Temo. We look closely; beautiful ceramic carvings around the edge celebrate the life of the river. Maireagh is surprised - these were fishing, boat-making dwarves; pretty much unheard-of. They traded on the Desarin and - she reads some more - "it celebrates, hmm, a god unknown to me; a god of agriculture and water. That's not part of the Dwarven pantheon today... This is the most interesting room we've found."

It looks like the dwarves here had every intention of outlasting the siege from above and eventually moving up to surface - Maireagh says the nature of the writing, runes and pictures isn't a memory of what has been lost, it's a reminder to the dwarves of Tyar Besil who they are - the overland kingdom of Besilmir. Everything we understood about them retreating and abandoning the kingdom seems inaccurate; they came down to just wait out a siege, but didn't expect it to be permanent.

There's the door to the forge; a corridor on the same side but further along that leads North; the tiny room we can see exposed to the South-East, a corridor leading south, or a corridor on the far side of the hall carrying on West that leads to a small door. Riglan perception: Only 4+8. A sudden scream comes from the door to the south and chains rattle - Riglan looks up at Nethza, says, "Could be a ghoul but I think it might be what we're looking for instead" and we head that way swiftly.

The door is closed. Spider! It's another dimly lit room; torches on walls. A wooden torture rack in the middle, manacles, hooks, blades, clamps... Four iron cages in an alcove to the West, each with a gaunt, dirty humanoid except for one which is open - someone is on the rack. A guy tittering to himself seems to be in charge, aided by three acolytes. He picks up a hook... Riglan calls back the spider, says to Nethza, **"Oh these fuckers have to go"** and kicks open the door. It's not a good kick and partly opens the door (athl. nat 2!+6) - Maireagh pushes past and kicks the door down fully.

A person in splint mail similar to Yarsha starts ranting. "Who is to be questioned? Why have you barged in here? I'm full! I can't take anymore! You people work me too hard! Come back when Heldorm is ready for you. Heldorm doesn't want to speak to you right now." He starts talking to himself and giggling.

Riglan is right behind Maireagh and throws fire, but it's a wildly bad throw (nat 3+10) and misses completely. Dammit. None of this is quite how Riglan wanted it to go; having a bad day.

Initiative:

* Riglan: Nat 20 FFS -> 25
* Temo: 23
* Maireagh: 11
* Nethza: 10

Riglan lines up the bad guy and hits him with the lightning wand, for 34 damage. Annoyingly he dodges but still takes 17. He tucks into the far corner of the room, leaving the door clear and Temo runs in; fires Magic Missile from his wand but bad guy throws up a shield. Temo tucks in behind a bookcase and pulls out his crossbow.

One acolyte freaks out a bit but gathers himself and stands ready by the door. A second runs up to Riglan to attack! It misses. Heldorm shouts, "Why are you attacking Heldorm?! Heldorm does all your dirty work for y... Wait... You're not one of us! You're one of *them*!" and points at the prisoners. He casts Shatter into the doorway, centred near Maireagh, hitting her, the dog and Nethza. All fail the con save! They all take 9 damage.

Maireagh shouts, "What? How dare you!" and runs in past the acolyte at the door, who swings to attack as she passes by but misses. She reaches Heldorm and swings twice; both hit for 18 damage total. The dog runs in to do the same (no opp. attack from the by-door acolyte as the reaction has been spent) but it misses. Nethza is close behind, casts hex on Heldorm and puts the green flame blade onto the mace - but misses. We've had a series of very low attack rolls for a while now. The third acolyte runs around and attacks her, but misses too.

Riglan tries Wither & Bloom on the acolyte in front of him and Heldorm. The damage roll is really terrible - 4d6 giving only 9 - but the acolyte fails a save and falls; Heldorm saves, because of course he does, for only 4 damage. Maireagh takes a bit of healing though.

Temo aims and fires at Helmdorm and does hit, but it's another bad damage roll with a total of only 15 from a potential 36.

Helmdorm says, "Pft. Ridiculous, all of you" and casts an area spell where Nethza, Maireagh and the dog are. Erupting Earth - dex saves all round. And of course he gets a high damage roll, because that's been this battle. 23! Maireagh succeeds, the dog fails and Nethza succeeds. Maireagh is getting *really* angry now. She runs around to flank Helmdorm with the dog and swings at him again. Both hit, no crits for a total of 27; that's enough to take him down. The dog runs around and takes down the remaining acolyte.

Nethza frees the person on the rack. "Riglan! She's very badly injured!" so Riglan comes over; perception 21. It's a young human female in very bad shape. She looks almost like a noblewoman once, maybe? She has tattered bits of clothes left that are blue and white... Remains of a cloak. Right. Now we know where that came from. It looks like she'd worn lots of rings that have been taken forcibly off. There's an insignia on her shoulder tattooed - Feathergails.

Riglan wonders if he should do nothing... But at least we need to know what her deal is. Medicine check 19+5, he stabilises her. He asks Temo to fetch some water, so Temo comes over with some water then carries on to examine the cages. In the nearest cage is a stout, strong-looking female human woman. Next, a female dwarf and at the far end is a male half-elf who looks very frail and looks in most in need of help.

At that moment, running back into the room is the acolyte who had fled earlier. He stops just inside the door on the messed-up floor from Erupting Earth, throwing a dagger at Riglan! It hits for 4 damage. This day sucks. Riglan drops in the Unicorn spirit for healing power, since we clearly are going to need it.

A black earth guard follows, then a splint mail guy runs in that looks a bit like a priest we fought the previous day. He throws a Slow spell at basically everyone. Nethza counterspells.

Maireagh runs up to the recently-arrived black earth guard and hits once for 8 damage. The dog runs up to the same guy but misses. Nethza turns, transfers her hex to the priest and throws two eldritch blasts; the first misses, second hits for 14. Another guard now pushes in shortly followed by three others. They're lined up, so Riglan throws lightning - 22 damage. The acolyte is taken down. The priest takes 22, one other guard does too but one dodges, taking 11.

Temo aims and fires at the guard near Riglan and hits but again irritatingly only for 15 damage. The guard engaged with Maireagh attacks twice and hits once, but only for 4 damage to her.

The priest, seeing its spell countered prior, tries again with Shatter this time, focused on Maireagh and the dog. 4d8 -> 13. Both save, so only 6 each fortunately. Maireagh steps out and throws Thorn Whip at the priest, hitting for 6 damage and pulling the priest into melee range. The dog comes over to attack but misses.

Nethza moves a little to flank the guard and tries again with the green flame blade, but once again misses despite flanking advantage. She throws the maddening curse, though, and that's enough to take down the priest with 5 damage. Now a guard attacks Nethza, but misses. Another tries its luck and flanking advantage gets it a hit for 10 damage. She does at least hold her spell, but is getting quite rough for HP. The last guard attacks Nethza twice and does also hit once for 7 damage. She loses her hex spell.

Riglan blows poison spray at the guard that'd hit Nethza via flanking. 17 damage; the guard fails its check and is killed. He casts a healing spell on Nethza at L2, giving her 11hp; allies also all get 8 thanks to the aura spell. He doesn't have time to consider whether or not the captives are allies so just considers "enemy of my enemy is my friend" and they all benefit from the aura.

Temo aims and fires at an uninjured guard near Nethza, hitting for 20. A guard tries to attack her but thanks to the dog imposing disadvantage it misses twice. Maireagh retaliates with flanking advantage and misses one, then hits for 12 damage. She asks the dog to repair itself, which brings it up from just 9hp with 2d8+3->14 more, so it rises to 23. Nethza once more uses the green flame, hoping for a hit! Misses.

A guard attacks Riglan; miss and hit, for 6 damage. The other next to him attacks too, missing twice. Riglan throws a poison spray back at it; damage roll only 12, but it fails so takes all of it. He sends a L1 healing word to Maireagh, rolling 10 and thus healing her for 18 with the unicorn. Everyone's looking a lot less injured.

Temo aims and fires yet again at this one guard he can't seem to drop. He hits for 22 damage, finally taking down the guard.

The between Nethza and Maireagh runs to try and better flank Nethza. Maireagh hits with an opportunity attack for 13 damage as it leaves, but it's still up. It goes for Nethza with advantage, hitting for 9 and misses with its second attack. Maireagh immediately runs up behind to flank it again; crits and takes down the guard. She runs around to the guard which Riglan hit with poison spray; hits and this one is down too. The room finally falls quiet.

"Damn, what a mess" says Riglan, very unhappy with how things went. "Sorry. I can't seem to get my act together today... Maireagh, Nethza, can you find out what's going on with Feathergale?" and Riglan heads over with Temo to the cages and we ask who the people are. We're looking for insight into truth or lie, and ask each in turn who they are and how they come to be trapped here.

The strong lady is first. "My name is Orna. I struck a priest a few days ago. I hate the cult!". Insight rolls are too low to tell us anything.

The dwarven lady next. "I'm just a commoner... I was... I'm Wulgreda. We were prospecting in the hills near the monastery and then we were captured. I don't know where the others are but they moved me down here... They've been torturing me for fun... INCLUDING HER" - pointing at Orna. "She's one of them! I don't know how she ended up in here. She must've done something bad. Just add Gervor!" She points to the half-elf. Again hopeless rolls. We think it might be truthful. Riglan thinks neither is lying.

Lastly, apparent-Gervor. "Thank you for healing me - I think I was nearly done for. I... We were ambushed by the cult. We were in the Sumber hills. I'm all that's left alive. There were four of us. I don't know what - what day is it? How long have I been here? Please release us. I come from a good family - we can pay..." Riglan cuts him off, "We're not here for money, don't worry." The guy is not lying and is desperate. He confirms also that Orna is - was a guard here. He points at the Feathergale and says they've been particularly mean to her. Her name is Droth.

Riglan asks Temo to unlock the cages of Wulgreda and Gervor. Orna shakes the door - Riglan says "I'm thinking about it! I'll get back to you! We've got to deal with this other issue first."

He heads over to Droth. He doesn't really know what to do; he tries Lesser Restoration but it doesn't help much - she seems kind of out of it; distant/vacant. She mouths words but doesn't speak. Medicine check of 16 - she's beyond rescue. We don't know what to do with her really; she's alive but kind of not. Don't know. Maybe try and get her to Renwick.

He goes back to Orna. "If we let you out, where would you go?" "I'm going to leave! But before I do, I will show you where things are. If you have any questions I will reveal all the secrets of this place. I'm done with them. I can lead the three of them out to safety." The others don't want to go with her.

We learn that the Dao is magically bound by something that keeps her making weapons. We need to go past the Shrine of Bleeding Stone to get to his quarters (well, we know better) - and the priest there is doing really bad things. It's why Orna struck her (after being struck first, due to them arguing!) and then got captured. She's been capturing deep gnomes from passages below, abducting them and using them in experiments - "sacrifices, to a Black Pudding that she keeps as a pet in the obelisk of the weeping stone. It's just awful. They live down below, living in the earth; nothing of what they do contravenes the Teachings of Ogremock."

She warns us to NOT go down any stairs - the deep place below. Bad. She's seen Marloss go there though, for days at a time, coming back up with orbs in boxes.

We elect to bring them up quickly to see if Renwick can help them on from there. It shouldn't take *too* long to get back up the stairs and we could send Renwick a message about this Feathergale, who he may or may not be able to help - even if that means helping her to the next life.

Temo swiftly checks out the room (investigation only total 15). There's not much beyond a locked wooden chest in the corner - mage hand to open; SOH check 15+11. No traps spring. There is plate armour for a black earth guard - it's Orna's, but she does not want it. We put that into Maireagh's bag. There's some slightly damaged studded leather armour, which we give back to Gervor as it was his; and an ornate elven sword, also his. There are some other bits of jewellery, especially blue/white colours and one with feather motifs; also a thin chain shirt, blue & white. We presume that's all for Droth, the catatonic Feathergale woman. There's also a bundle of torn robes, a spell book and a wand; Wulgreda is lucid enough to identify it as belonging to someone who didn't survive. A young apprentice mage of some kind. In the mean time Temo and Maireagh investigate. The spell book it transpires is low level and early days; Detect Magic, Identify, Find Familiar. Nothing identifiable for a person we might trace to find family. The wand is a wand of Colour Spray. The robes are unidentifiable. Riglan takes them for burial.

We release everyone, Orna last. In the end we decide that the safest solution is to walk people out to Renwick and come back down - it's still the morning, we can be back within the afternoon. **We get up the stairs uneventfully. We check with Renwick but he doesn't want anyone else to know he's there, so we bypass him and head to the river to give them our boat; tell them to go to Yartar and take it to the marshal - they'll be looked after.** We give them a note for the Water Baron. Nethza gives them 5 gold to get set up. We go back down with a brief hello to Renwick as we pass by. We do encounter a small skirmish en route back down - that annoying main hall again! - Maireagh takes 8 damage, Riglan 5, Temo uses L1 Silvery Barbs and Maireagh has to use a Branding Smite L2 spell (we just roll for that as a summary).

We have a short rest just before which Riglan drops in his temp HP as we don't know how strong the remaining forces are here. We're back to full health more or less (e.g. Maireagh's at 78 out of 79, plus 13 temp).

We follow around to the secret route into Unrayle's chambers. What object might it be that is holding the Dao under duress? We can't see anything and Maireagh says, very deadpan: "Why don't we ask the Dao?" - hmm, should've gone there first! So we make our way back to the well room. **We hear on the way, behind one of the doors, a "no no no!"** - and Riglan being Riglan, says, "Oh, that's our cue" and asks Maireagh for help pushing the door open. We realise that it's the shrine - it has an access from this side too. So much for leaving that until later - no time like the present!

The room looks like it has had heavy modifications. Pillars of granite appear to extrude out of the stonework but stop short of the ceiling except for one particularly massive pillar that looks granite or maybe obsidian, jagged, extend through the roof. A pale Svirfneblin (deep gnome) is bound to the bottom of it wriggling and yelling. A woman in priest's robes with split mail underneath - a familiar sight now - stands to the side, using some kind of hand gestures / magic, beckoning to some kind of reddish black ooze that's percolating through the stone and slowly dripping towards the gnome.

Riglan perception 16+8: The gnome is tied, but her hands are in manacles that are chained to ringlets embedded into the floor. There are other chains and manacles enclosed around bleached bones, the flesh stripped away, around the pillar base. The priestess turns swiftly as we push in - "Who are you? Why are you here? This is *my* shrine; no-one is allowed in here without prior permission" - she looks defensive and doesn't seem immediately hostile. Maireagh is still wearing the symbol.

Riglan shouts to Nethza to "try and get the gnome out!" - she has some kind of teleport thing, he's seen it before. Initiative is rolled.

* Riglan 18
* Temo 15
* Nethza 6 
* Maireagh 4

We were told that the priestess was Erione. He shouts, "Erione, I presume? Stop the spell or die!" "I'm not casting anything. It will feed because it is hungry." Riglan shouts to the others, "watch out for the pillar and tendrils - that black pudding thing!" (nature 16, he's heard of them; oozes, natural creatures rather than aberration; very corrosive and therefore immune to acid damage itself and possibly other things; at least a lot of our damage is magical which might help). He's closer to the Erione though, and tries Poison Spray; DC18 save failed, 11 damage total. Activates his staff and is 10ft away from the priestess.

Temo sees the tendrils through the open door and hears Riglan's shout. He aims and fires (sharpshooter - it's 3/4 cover, more or less, but that doesn't bother him). Hits. Middling rolls but still gets 23 damage.

Erione looks around in a kind of annoyed surprise. She tries to slow us down, thinking she can get away. DC13 wisdom saving all round. Temo and Maireagh are slowed, Riglan, the dog and Nethza are not.

The black pudding climbs down next to the gnome! Very close! The Svirfneblin is freaking out and appealing for help. At the touch of the black pudding the armour corrodes, bubbling and melting. Nethza is still holding her hex, so she transfers it to the black pudding, runs next to the gnome, says, "Do you trust me?" "Yes!" "OK, close your eyes!" and casts Thunderstep, teleporting both of them outside the room. In the process the blast wave almost causes 4d10+6 damage (only 19) to the black pudding, but it is resilient and only takes half (9). The wave hits the priestess too but she's hardy too (both roll con saves of 20!) and only takes 9 also.

The slowed Maireagh manages to get into the room and tells the dog to attack Erione. It hits for 8 damage. Maireagh shrugs off the slow spell's effects and calls out to Temo saying she can help him shrug it off.

With only Temo affected now, Riglan doesn't use Dispel Magic and instead throws flame at the black pudding. He hits, but only for 7 damage. Temo can't aim but is slowly able to change his target and goes for the priestess. He hits but for low damage, only 20; it's enough to drop the priestess though - Erione falls. He rolls nat 20 for his saving throw! No longer slowed.

The black pudding attacks the dog. It's about to critically hit when Temo casts Silvery Barbs. This makes the black pudding miss, fortunately - it possibly would've destroyed the dog outright (2d6+8d8). Nethza is given advantage; she throws two eldritch blasts; the first crits thanks to advantage! Yay. Second hits too; 25 and 12 damage. It's pretty messed up. She throws a maddening hex at it too for 5 more, but it doesn't quite bring it down.

Maireagh looks around. Metal dog, metal sword, metal armour... She saw what happened to the gnome's armour and metal parts. She calls the dog back; the black pudding misses its opportunity attack. She has an acid attack too, but that's no good! "Umm, OK, alright... You guys... Uuh... This?" and casts Faerie Fire to try and help us get in hits, but the black pudding critically succeeds and escapes the effect.

Riglan tries to hit with fire; he only rolls 12 but that's enough! Good damage roll; 14. This burns up the black pudding completely; it turns to ash. More parts of it drip, burn and crumble down from the ceiling.

Temo unties the gnome. "I'm so lucky you came when you did! I thought I was done for. My name is Rukhelmoth Glitterstone, but you can call me Ruk ('ruke' like 'luke')... The rest of my scouting party were eaten already. Can we go back in...? I want to check to see if there's anything left of them in there?" so we go in.

Maireagh is bristling with anger. She points at the damage - "Look what they've done! This *was* a chapel" -  she points at carvings and writings on the wall. "It was a chapel to Moradin, the god of the forge; of creation. They've destroyed it with their stone pillars and formations." Ruk goes to the bleached bones by the pillars and finds some intact rings on ringers; perhaps magic, or stone, but things that aren't corroded. They're identifiable. She's very distressed, obviously. "We always knew there were risks; the shaking, the tremors which started a few weeks ago, they collapsed bits of the caverns underneath and it opened up a pathway between our village and this crazy *thing* here. Three of us were sent to investigate - we told them to evacuate as all kinds of crazy creatures were coming in; giant black spiders, little demons and more; we all got out but after, we went back down to try and investigate. There are weird elemental maelstroms and caverns! It's the underdark, but different; it's very old; we found this place that looks like an ancient temple; a ziggurat; we saw people trying to communicate with a strange fiery eye, but then we got caught and they brought us here. There's a medusa! There's a medusa wandering down there. I can show you how to get down there? The medusa goes *there*" - points to Unrayle's quarters - "these elemental things, you've got to be so careful - but that staircase" (pointing) "has a ward on it; we see them doing hand signs to get through it, but that leads down to the ancient Drow temple."

Ruk says that she's going to hide in the chasm near the bulettes but, if we're headed down the stairs, she'll come with us. Her villager evacuation point is through that way - still underground, of course.

We say that we're almost done here though we might rest before proceeding down. The priestess has nothing on her nor anything of interest in the room, so as Ruk heads off, we continue to the forge entrance off the well room (Ruk in tow before scrambling down the chasm entrance as we're crossing). We open the door, Maireagh first since she has the symbol. Once again the duergar stop and stare. Sharva Deem the Dao turns, holding a massive hammer. The two duergar are holding a beaten, hot piece of metal between tongs. A roaring hot forge is nearby. They look silently. Sharva observes us, saying nothing.

Riglan clears his throat, and says, "Hello, my name's Riglan and we've been clearing out some of the problematic people in these halls..." - her deep voice responds, "that does not concern me; I know. Are you here to cause trouble with me?" "No, that's the thing - we heard you were somehow beholden to Unrayle and we know how to get in his chambers and he's not there, so whatever artefact it is that holds you, we thought we'd try to find it and release you from this unwanted bond." Insight 17+5. As he says this, Riglan senses that the Dao's demeanour does not change at all. This Dao is definitely not in need of "rescue" and probably doesn't care either way. Riglan figures it's up to her to tell us what the object is, if she wishes, else carry on forging weapons. We don't mind either way. She just says, "Mine is a contract, unless you are here with another contract; or something to break the contract, be it unlawfully entered. I have no other dealings with you."

We head back outside to think and chat about it. This isn't someone in distress and not a prisoner. Maireagh realises that there are terms of a contract that was entered into, and the terms of clear; if any terms are not met, the contract is null. The contract is two-way. It's not a trick or treachery. The object we've heard about could just *signify* the contract, rather than being some kind of magical binding. Maireagh thinks we should just ask the question about the signifying item more simply.

We go back in, and Riglan asks, "Sorry to bother you again! What is the physical item that signifies you contract with Unrayle?" "It is an item that I created with him together, that holds the contract in place. It is an item of both beauty in crafted stone and fine metalwork. I understand it is an item which creates music." Riglan says, "Thank you. With most of this place now emptied and Unrayle having withdrawn to lower levels, are you confident that he still upholds his part of the contract?" "The terms of payment are clear. If he fails to make next year's payment, then I shall of course consider the contract nullified. It matters not to me what happens outside these forge walls; I am disinterested in anything that happens there."

We retreat back and we follow the path Temo shows us to get into Unrayle's quarters and in there, we pull the lyre out of Maireagh's bag to see if it's made of stone as well as metal. Riglan perception: 17+8 (25). Parts of the lyre seem to be made from petrified plants, with metal strings. Stone and metal. It's exquisite. So we're pretty sure that this is it. It's not carved - it's grown and petrified. Riglan isn't too comfortable around it suddenly. 

So the next question; is this ours to take? We should perhaps leave this with the Dao. Unrayle may or may not be back. We take it to the forge and present it. Say that we're headed down and may enter into battle with Unrayle. If we survive and he doesn't, we can try and tell you, unless you'll know anyway by magical means. It doesn't matter for the contract, we're told; it's a year of weapons either way. "As long as the contract remains unbroken, I'll continue my work until the year is out" - she's been paid for a year. Maireagh says, "she's very literal. Is this lyre the contract?" - the Dao says, "the Lyre is the physical embodiment of the contract, yes". Riglan says, "I don't want to damage this, it's beautiful, but if this were physically destroyed, would that break the contract?" The dao looks puzzled, "if *that* were broken, the contract - would literally be broken, yes" - puzzlement as in, a stupid question.

Very lawful and literal.

So we go outside with the lyre. Temo, investigation only 2+something, but arcana 19 total. It's a magical item, so difficult to destroy, but if we just have to *break* it then all we need is a material stronger than stone and metal. We could just bludgeon it with our adamantium block! It's a shame, but Maireagh points out that e.g. cutting just a string might be "only damage". So breaking it is.

Temo can't watch. Riglan is less worried that he might've been because it's petrified plants, not real stone.

Maireagh and Riglan work together. Maireagh shows how to hold and aim the block, Riglan straight strength check only gets 7+3, but +5 from Maireagh -> 15 which is enough. This cracks the lyre. Needs another go. 12+3, 15, so that's enough - second hit works again. The two hits are enough to shatter the stone portion of the lyre. Inside are remnants of living vines. The metalwork lattice remains. We take it into the forge.

The dao takes an impassionate look. "The contract is broken". She packs her tools into a stone basket, goes to the corner of the forge, opens a large stone chest and starts scooping out armfuls of gold, transferring them to the basket. A golden goblet covered in gems is packed into. She looks to the duergar; "Your service is ended". Gives them each a bag of gold. Looks to us. "Right..." - pop! She plane-shifts away.

Well, not sure if that's good or bad outcome! But at least no more weapons, the two duergar look at each other, shrug, mumble and push past us to leave; well, that's that.

We look around the forge out of curiosity. Temo investigation 11+9. "Did you see? Did you *see* how much was in that chest? ARMFULS of gold!" - he looks around. The chest is entirely empty, unsurprisingly! No more gold goblets either. But:

* There are lots of weapons, some very scary, most of them familiar
* Incomplete bits of plate and splint mail
* Glaves line the wall
* 40-odd partially made weapons that need further assembly
* A few ingots of steel
* Heavy gauntlets of brown iron that are on a separate table - Temo arcana 7+3; senses they are magical but can't figure them out. Maireagh spends 10 minutes identifying. 

The gauntlets turn out to be "claws of the umber hulk", not made from the umber hulk but named after their properties. When worn, you can tunnel through bare rock! We'll keep those. They require attunement.

We can't take the weapons to e.g. Lion Shield Coster, too big and heavy. Instead, we opt for destruction. We throw *everything* in the still-hot forge. Everything starts to melt down - well, no more weapons for cultists.

We scout around; thudding footsteps behind the forge mean something large walked around there - Riglan sends out a spider and as we suspect, sees the etin dragging a stone bench with three legs (one missing) as if it were a club. The two heads are arguing with each other! Droog is so stupid. No, Noob is stupid. That kinda thing... Little do they know that they're the new owners of this real estate.

We head back to that guard room where we once heard people. The door's open, nobody inside. We destroy the crossbows and mounts. From the arrow slits, we see the corridor leading to the stairwell down that we'd been told about by Ruk.

All that's left would be the bulettes and we think there's a chamber near Unrayle's room. We go there first, in case of battle. It's a large ornate double door. Behind it would be some kind of sanctum. There are carvings of fruit trees. Temo checks for traps, doesn't do well in rolls; thinks it's OK; we push the door open.

Indeed, no traps. Riglan, perception 20+8! A beautiful, 30ft high arching ceiling, carved like a dome. All around are beautiful petrified tree trunks, as if there was once a grove in here. Parts of the dome have crumbled, but in one intact panel, there's some light; it seems that there must be light pipes to bring down sunlight here. The ground has some areas for planters. This would have been an underground garden. There are statues of various humanoids in various poses - very few of which are happy. All look in the direction of a centre dias with a chair. Sat on the chair looking towards the door is a being with shakes for hair that writhing, dressed well and next to him a priest sat on the steps of the dias leaning up, looking up at the medusa but not made of stone.

Riglan shouts, "shit, he's *here*, look away!" and fumbles to get his mirror.

"If you're reaching for mirrors," says a well-spoken voice, "spare all of us the embarrassment. I have been watching you and waiting for you to get here. I'm amused that you found my room. I'm *annoyed* that you destroyed my lure. I'm mildly *furious* that you've cost me my weapon smith and I'm *irate* that you've killed my priests. But... Here we are. You *finally* made it this far. What do you plan to do now? Let me guess. You didn't have a plan - did you?"

Riglan answers, "We *always* have a plan. They never work. So it doesn't make any difference..." - we hear what we think are people standing and walking down the stairs.

Unrayle says, "I guess we might as well be decent. I am Arch Duke Marloss, Unrayle - first-born of Unrayles - heir to the throne. And you? Who are you? What are your names and titles?"

Riglan says, "I'm Fred."
Maireagh says, "I am the Whooper Of Your Ass." 
Temo says, "I'm Count Basingstone Mitchell-Hummer The Third"

Marloss interrupts before Nethza gets a go. "Pet, come to me!" - from the corner of the room, a 15ft high shadow rises, unfolds wings - some kind of demon - it floats across the ceiling, keeping to shadows. It looms up in Marloss' shadow, looming up next to him. Marloss says, "I can see this level is *lost*. Those *useless, useless* peons! *Mud* sorcerer! She thinks I didn't know she was a two-faced traitor. And the witch. To think that I might not see her trying to poison the well! Politics. These politics. So pointless. **I'll make you a deal...** You stand aside and I'll walk out of here and you get to keep your life. You can have this temple. I gift it to you."

Behind him, Unrayle drags a large war pick made of iron. It thrums with power, crackling as if before a lighting storm or thunder strike. He hasn't attacked.

Riglan says, "we can't let you free the princes and you're a fool if you think the Eye is doing anything other than using you - playing off each element against the other".

Unrayle raises the pick and smashes it to the ground. A wave of thunder rolls out. Strength saving throws:

* Riglan 10
* Temo 6
* Nethza 7
* Maireagh 13
* Dog 5

We're all pushed back and squashed against the walls. Marloss walks out of the room and drags the pick along the ground as he does so, opening up the ground behind him; his "pet" is told not to let us follow him and he walks out of the room.

So there's a priest, shadow demon and some kind of very different earth elemental. Temo arcana 13+3 - recognises something he read in one of his studies; it's a medium sized elemental but it's in humanoid form, in plate armour, very magical, formidable. It carries a large maul and crackles with thunderous energy.

Initiative:

* Temo 18
* Maireagh 16
* Nethza 16
* Riglan 13

The priest looks around and sees Riglan and Temo close by. He casts Shatter, DC13. Riglan crit fail (18 damage), Temo succeeds (9). The priest then retreats. Temo aims back at the body of the priest and fires - hits in the thigh for 24 damage.

Maireagh and the dog run up to flank the demon "pet". She attacks twice, including a branding smite. She hits twice, getting very close to a crit but not quite! 8 normal damage which does seem to affect it normally, but 7 radiant hurts it badly, dealing 14. Second hit only does 9. The dog hits for another 9.

Nethza transfers the last moments of her long-lived hex spell to the priest. She throws eldritch blasts, hitting once for 17.

Riglan conjures woodland beings (L4) - two of CR1 - two Satyr Revellers appear. Initiative after Riglan.

* AC 13
* Magic resistance - adv on all saving throws for spells
* Cannot be put to sleep
* 33hp + 12 via 6 hit die (45)
* 2 attacks - melee ram, +3 for 2d4+1, or ranged shortbow, +5, 80ft, 1d6+3

"Start on the priest, but keep an eye on the elemental and use your best judgement" says Riglan. He drops another bear totem to give them 13hp and restore himself and Temo. Satyr 1 tries with the bow twice. Both miss. The second satyr tries and only gets one hit. 5 damage is all it gets, but that's enough to take down the priest, astonishingly.

The earth elemental myrmidon now acts. It sees Nethza to its right and charges her. It almost hits, but Temo distracts with his last Silvery Barbs. It would've been a thunderous strike, but it now misses.

Shadow demon's turn... Riglan notices how it tends to avoid shafts of light coming into the room. It reaches out with claws, screeching, raking at Maireagh. It hits; Maireagh throws up a shield, and a blast of psychic energy bounces off, ejecting into the visible spectrum. At this, it slides into a shadow near one pillar, then suddenly appears far away across the room by another shadow. Riglan shouts, "The shadows! We need to flood the room with light!"

Temo shouts back, "Only sunlight I think?" and aims and fires at the demon over in the corner of the room. Attack 28. Good damage roll; hits for 30. The bolt passes through a puddle of sunlight as it passes diagonally across the room over the dias, seeming to almost drag the light with it; the demon screams and burns, disappearing. Gone! "Well, that seemed to do the trick..." says Temo to Riglan.

Maireagh runs up, "Nethza!" to her aid. She has to push past the dog and can't quite flank the elemental, but does get across from Nethza at a 10ft range and casts Thorn Whip, succeeding with a hit. The 2d6 damage is bad - only 2! - but she pulls the elemental towards her. The dog runs in front of Nethza to flank and attacks with advantage but can't get a bite in; it now runs around the side to give Nethza an opening.

Nethza is at 10ft range, but Temo's attack gives her advantage anyway - melee flanking isn't necessary; she puts a hexblades curse on it and tries two eldritch blasts. One hits, one crits on a 19 thanks to that - d10+8 (17) and 2d10+8 (18). Now she pulls out her mace and moves forward to melee range.

Riglan gets in a successful Frostbrite cantrip, for a very poor 3 damage (2d6) - which also tells him that these stone creatures *do* take damage from cold, which he thinks he'd seen before - and most of all, gives it disadvantage on its next attack. Satyr 1 hits once for 8 damage, satyr 2 also misses once and then hits but only for 4 damage. Because they're summoned creatures, these attacks are magical and do affect the elemental.

The elemental doesn't regain its thunder and instead just attacks Nethza twice. The first disadvantaged attack misses; the second misses too!

Temo seizes the chance to once more aim and fire. He hits, for middling damage - 24. It's taking a while but we see that the elemental is now at least looking a little messed up. Maireagh attacks - crit! - second hits. Only 10 damage (awful rolls) and then 7 (alright roll). The dog tries and with flanking advantage hits, for 11, outdoing Maireagh!Nethza now transfers her hex and swings her mace. Everyone's dancing around the elemental, the three of them moving for constant flanking advantage. She hits then crits on another 19; 16 damage for the first attack; 29 damage for the second. That does it - the earth elemental myrmidon shatters into rubble and Nethza is healed to full as her curse expires. Moments later, her long-lived hex spell finally fades away.

Riglan uses his second wildshape to turn into an Owl (darkvision 120, 60ft speed) and sends it down the tunnel to see if it can see Unrayle. He reaches the top of the stairs down to the temple below without being able to quite see anything, but does hear the sounds of running steps echoing down. He can't go closer as it has a ward on and he can't make the required hand signal as an owl! He returns to his party and reports that Unrayle has very likely fled to the lower levels, which we expected and it's good to know he's gone that way and isn't waiting to ambush us or similar.

We take a moment to investigate the room. The statues are clearly petrified people, but all in cult regalia. He's been petrifying his own people. Some look like they're in begging positions as if pleading for forgiveness or whatever. Nasty. None have their eyes averted, unusually; so he must have decided to turn them to stone, we surmise, so it's perhaps not an automatic thing - the priest we realise was looking at him too, but our assumption of some kind of magical protection is replaced by a realisation that **Unrayle controls his ability to petrify. It's a sight-based attack of sorts.**

Another poor investigation roll - only 4+9 from Temo. Temo doesn't find any artefacts, but Maireagh can explain the room. It seems Unrayle can turn *any* living thing to stone. The trees it seems died from neglect long before they were petrified - there are no leaves. Maireagh points out the light coming in, mostly blocked, but there must've been plenty of natural sunlight during the day somehow. Some kind of engineering marvel above that domed ceiling. The reason why there's nothing on the ceiling or walls around is because they look like they used to have mirrors. This is an arbour, several hundred feet underground. These dwarves *really* were more very attached to the surface world; much more than any conventional historical accounts of which she is aware.

Maireagh says it must've been a room for royalty. The seal of the royal family of Besilmir is above the door leading to Unrayle's room - sanctum - a room of reflection, not intended as Marloss' bedroom! The royal family don't seem to have lived here - no suggestions of that, it wasn't a palace - just an outpost of sorts. A main entrance to the city, perhaps? A gatehouse district. She thinks that what we saw a long time ago chasing the Feathergales might've been the palace area.

We open the door to the sanctum. Despite Marloss' over-the-top furniture, the room itself is quite plain; it was indeed a reflection room, with a now-filled-in stone circle that Maireagh says would've had a pool with shallow water. A place for meditation. With better lighting, we can see a very old book, bound by two slabs of slate, open on the table next to Marloss' bed. We investigate. It's in Dwarven. Marieagh reads; Temo reads over her shoulder with his helm. It's an account of the daughter of the King of Besilmir - the Princess - how she longs to return to the beauties of the hills, river and forest above. She spends her days melancholy in this room, as "we hide in this dark burrows, surrounded by stone, where I feel the earth itself pressing against my soul, squeezing whatever joy I have out from me, as the stone squeezes the black gold from the earth". She also writes, "The gates hold; they have held for years. We are impenetrable but we are trapped. The hordes of orcs and their kin, ogres and more, have laid siege. We are in the 11th year. Some dwarves have forgotten what it is to live above ground. They dig. They dig down."

We spend a good hour reading more. Maireagh and Temo continue to recount stories while Nethza and Riglan rest.

**Had this journal not been found, maybe things would've been very different.** It contains an account of the king and advisors digging further down, digging down over the last 11 years - there are years more of entries from scattered weeks - in year 15, they recount only two breaks where forces retreated outside and they could return up briefly, before forces returned reinforced and they had to come back down. Meanwhile, most of Besilmir has resigned themselves to carving a life out down here. They dug, as dwarves often do. The journal entries stop abruptly; towards the last of them, is note that "father and his advisors have discovered possibly a way to not only protect the kingdom of Besilmir, but to push forces back too. He has found an immense source of power. They have stumbled upon ancient ruins, hundreds of feet down" - later, "...father is in turmoil. Today I heard him arguing with his advisors against using such ancient power that we do not understand, but the gates were almost breached and we have no choice. He has asked to be left alone. I'm sitting in my sanctum. He doesn't know I'm here. I'm glad that he's finding solace in the trees, as I do, but I can tell he's greatly troubled". **The very last entry**: "...the machines of war have reached our gates. It is now or never. Our priests and mages have summoned the power they have found. I am afraid. The whole earth is shaking and quaking, the enemies are falling into chasms, but entire sections of the city are crumbling from the sheer power that they have unleashed."

We stow the journal carefully in Marieagh's bag. Maireagh is very shaken by it - to her core. "This journal... It tells a completely different story than everything that's been written... Is it possible that Besilmir killed *itself?* That the dwarves did not leave here; they died here?". She goes very quiet. Then she whispers, "What did they find down there?"

Riglan tries to weave together all his dreams on this, the things we've read, the things we've been told; the temple, the eye, its deception. Maireagh starts asking more - she must know more. Why was the king troubled, what was the power, how did it end?

After a while, we head over with one last chore - free the bulettes. They distressed and hungry; the bond was broken it seems for the third; the adamantium block helps us break their chains and bonds. Animal handling 11+5, it's enough; they climb down the chasm and burrow away. As they do so, we shout down for Ruk, who climbs back out. We look a bit rough apparently! We agree, and suggest we find a place to rest up, eat and get ready to head down to tackle the things below.

### 4875 XP bringing us to 48405 -> **LEVEL 9**

That evening, we settle in for food and break out some wine. We choose Yarsha's burrow; easily defendable, kitchen nearby, beds.

We chat with Ruk about the village and Riglan asks Nethza about her patron - had anything from them? No, not yet. "I sense that... I understand if you don't want to do this... But I have *have* to go down those stairs. I have to know what's under there. My patron has to know."

Riglan says, "Well, so does Marieagh. And we all want to get Unrayle and besides, we have to follow and try to stop this". We wonder why Unrayle went that way. Riglan talks about his memory of these elemental nodes and things; it seems like he must be going there to do stuff with the Eye and/or these nodes, to cast magic, to conjure things; that temple must be where the bulk of this happens. We've only got rid of one of the cult leaders, so three more are there, and that might mean three princes, which may not be enough for the Eye but is still more than enough to cause havoc. Even one would be. "So I'm with you Nethza, and I think we all are - we have to go; desire doesn't even really come into it, but each for our own reasons, I think in a funny way, we want to."

Temo reads the new spell book as we rest up. While we rest and chat, Ruk warns us that the underdark is - well - dark, so we'll certainly need our darkvision on the go. He describes how they would sometimes have to defend against rare raiding parties of Drow - though often, all they could do is hide. Not many duergar originally, but many more after the cavern collapse opened up the passageway - along with the venomous spiders, beetles and more. They harvest and grow mushrooms in areas where there is bioluminescence and mine, searching for gems. That's why they tend to get raided! They use them for storing up magic. They softly glow when charged up in different colours. They like the colourful lights, even though they live in the underdark.

We end up talking about air cultists and, at this, Ruk pipes up. He bears a grudge against them in particular. For all the problems they had with drow and so forth, it was the air cultists who commandeered their old caverns and enslaved many of their people. This is ultimately the main reason they fled their village - they didn't have much choice. So we know that some of the air cult are indeed ensconced down in the lower levels. Ruk hasn't really explored too much of the strange temple down there because it's dangerous and scary! He did see a fair amount before being captured, getting almost all the way across from the air cult side, through the middle and over to where we are now and really only got caught because of trying to avoid the spectres, wraiths and ghosts in this area.

Ruk mentions the Hall Of The Sentinel, in the far North West corner. We aren't sure what's there, so Riglan sends a spider. There's a great hall with a corridor running off it, with grand stairs that seem to lead up to another area; it reminds us of the broken hall with railway at the water temple. We surmise that this probably leads to another temple. Standing motionless in the centre of the great hall is a surprisingly undamaged 20ft tall stone statue, with huge pickaxes for arms. It faces the tunnel. Riglan surmises that this is probably intact because it's magical and stands guard against incursions from the presumed other temple through there, and given that we know the water temple connected to earth and air, it's unlikely that this one connects back to both water and air too; so instead of air, probably the fire cult.

Were it not for the urgency we feel about going down and figuring out what's going on below, Riglan would choose to pursue the Feathergales. He has a bit of beef with them after what they did to the Mirabar delegation. He'd even secretly hoped when we realised there was a prison here, and likewise for the jail in the water temple, that maybe there was still one or two of them around - his bat's view of the bodies in the chasm at the air temple was only as clear as a bat's vision so might've been misled. But as we find more and only find belongings rather than people, his hope fades there and his resolve to tackle the air cult grows.

Riglan decides to, just before bed and almost on a whim, cast his Divination ritual out in the mess hall. He burns his incense and once it's all set up, he asks: **"Marcos Unrayle has descended to levels below this. What goal is he trying to achieve there?"**

Smoke fills the room and swirls around Riglan's staff, forming misty visions; greyscale representations, but in three dimensions. Riglan sees what vaguely looks like Marloss - the huge iron pick in particular is distinctive. He stands in front of a strange, well, what's the word; node? A mind-bending, floating bit of rock that seems to be folding in itself infinitely, or at least that's how the smoke moves as the smoke almost seems to struggle to show this part of the picture it's painting. Pebbles seem to get drawn in from around, as if this strange node/rock has its own gravity. Unrayle has a box in front of him; small, ornate with sides open, but empty. His pick is connected to the node and where it connects, a small crystal seems to be forming, but it slowly grows and takes on a globe shape. No, not a globe - **an orb**. Around him a small army of elementals seems to gather, being ripped apart then reformed by this strange nexus of energy in front of him.

Suddenly the smoke shifts. It changes perspective. A wider view. Riglan gets a sense of a possible future; the cavern looks different. Remants of buildings and cavern wall/ceiling seem to have been ripped out, devoured; sucked into this node, now a whirling nexus of stone and energy, many times larger than it was. Marloss floats in front of it, holding his pick in front of the folding object, smashing at it, digging parts out. A head and shoulders and arm seem to partly appear, get pulled back, reappear, pull back again; as if something tries to emerge, while being pulled back from within. It's some huge demon-like creature from the glimpses seen, made of what would seem to be dust, mud and rock, breathing plumes of dust or sand, as best Riglan can make out from the smoke representation.

The room then fills with smoke, no longer with form. People cough and Riglan opens a door to help it dissipate. Riglan says, "um, that didn't look good at all. Orb of destruction at a guess, but that second thing? I hope that's not, like, happening very soon!"

We certainly know we have plenty of reasons to pursue him down there - but everyone voices the same concern; there are at least two other temple leaders presumably up to similar shenanigans for their respective elements. How can we keep on top of it?

"Surely, surely he's been weakened greatly by our incursion here?" asks Maireagh. "Is he still a threat?" Riglan isn't sure - true, perhaps we should focus on air and fire. Nethza asks, "Do you think they're doing the same as Unrayle down there?". We consider air the least damaged. Maybe a day or two tackling them would be better than tackling Unrayle? He's making an orb and Ruk points out that there are more cultists and creatures down there with him - more creatures, less humanoids; so he's not without assistance or people/things that might convey and orb to the surface. But all said, horrible though an orb would be, capable of destroying an entire town perhaps, it's nothing compared to what a Prince of Elemental Evil might do.

We'll have to worry about that in the morning.
