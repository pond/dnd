# Campaign Six

We return to firbolg druid Riglan Leafseeker, halfing rogue Temo Smoothhands, dwarven artificer Maireagh Silveraxe and tiefling sorceress Nethza.



## Part 1
### New Beginnings

A druid and his apprentice; an archaeologist and her tower; a tielfing, a halfling and their school. All was well - until the night the fracture came. Friends dive recklessly into the unknown, on a mission of rescue.



## Part 2
### Shadows Fell

Darkness across the land. Admist creeping rot and ruin at every turn, the search continues. Hope must be maintained. As the story spans the centuries, there are difficult lessons of cause and effect. The world is broken as an escape is made - the chase is on!



## Part 3
### The Bright Blue Sky

Familiar surroundings are tainted by the suspicion of a dark arrival, at first unclear but made certain by terrible news from the East. Brave adventurers must travel further than they have ever travelled before on a quest to tackle a dark and twisted adversary already so powerful that the Dark Powers themselves are unable to act directly.



## Part 4
### Eye Of The Sun

The nature of the threat becomes more clear; the sense of urgency and fear grows. Through the vast desert, through the eyes of the future and through the civilisations of Sembia, the party must gather an army to fight the coming war.



## Part 5
### The Assault

Help must be sought within ancient forests and the elven civilisations within them - but the rot is deeper than we could ever have feared. As outposts fall, an evacuation must be ordered and ancestral homes abandoned. Then, at last, we are face to face with the enemy - a full night and day of chase, running for our lives, battling for every foot of ground; but on the verge of escape, a horrifying conclusion.



## Part 6
### Future's End

No trick in any book is spared in the fight to slow the enemy. We race for an ancient stronghold, but we are beaten; there is now no choice - war is inevitable.



## Part 7
### Worlds Rejoined

Fortunes slowly turn. Plans to disable armies are foiled. Forces join at the stronghold and the huge battle commences. It would seem an impossible fight, but the ancient foe's strategy is finally understood and, with it, an error of judgement that could be our salvation...
