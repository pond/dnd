> *(**Clouds** - Riglan as a baby, forest, happy, then older, becomes troubled by visions, first-person as he's handed armour on his 100th birthday, but then a halfling plays drums, a dwarf tinkers with a flying metal bee, a tiefling dances with fire; is seen walking a path as the scenery changes rapidly around, forests, cities, meadows, mountains; finally back at his home forest, surrounded by his tribe, "Happy 501st Birthday!", eyes closing one last time, stars shining in them)*

> *(**Another show** - Temo playing on his family's farm, fishing with his brothers, growing up, but then leaving, returning to find his parents gone, his brothers angry, tries to be brave but we seem him crying once he's turned from them and walking away; later, he sees a strange person (not a firbolg - Riglan was disguised!) handing him two coppers and smiling; he sees Qelline and Carp, playing wth animals; a sketch of a family tree; apple trees and sunshine; his hand holding hers, wrinkled with great age, them both smiling, stars shining in their eyes)*

> *(**Circus crowds** - Nethza as a child, playing with other children who are unconcerned of her heritage, carefree, acrobatic; grows older; her Tiefling features more prominent, seen arguing and being teased, crying; set upon in a town square, but rescued in battle by a strange group of adventurers; a performer, a storyteller, a tutor, eventually with her own family; her patron watching; they too grow older and Nethza is guided towards her patron's plane, stars shining in her eyes)*

> *(**Chorus riff and outro** - Maireagh growing, learning her craft, happy to be different, but then pursued for her abilities; the Zhentarim, previous homes; but then rescued, destroying the house and becoming a traveller; Owlbear Tower, "Under New Ownership!" sign outside, Maireagh in the hall in a chair, smiling as she watches children play together - a tiefling, two halflings and a baby firbolg; on the mantlepiece above, her photos - with Danain; atop the hill at Goldenfields, newer pictures, but her second photo from Yartar - close up of just her eyes, the stars and planes of the multiverse playing within and we are taken between planes with her...)*

> *(**At the crossfade** - On a mantlepiece above a fireplace in Elder Barge at Deepgarden Keep, a strange 3D illusion (photo) shows the four of them (day 50, Yartar hiring fair - archery competition) in front of a big arrow target, Temo pointing to a split arrow. This is where the photo has ended up. It is mounted to a brass plaque that simply says, "Thank You")*

> *(The Elder Barge. It looks much older, but well maintained. Inside a mantlepiece above a fire; a feather duster runs over the 3D photo we saw before. Then we see the bar; an old halfling is wiping it down. He turns to a book of numbers and scratches his head, looking confused. A female voice calls, "Carp? Oh, don't worry, I'll get that - you know you've no head for numbers!". He chuckles - "Thanks dear! I'll make us some tea before bed" - and walks out of view)*
