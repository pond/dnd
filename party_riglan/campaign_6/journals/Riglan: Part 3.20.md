# Riglan: Part 3.20
## Still Day 55
### 10pm

After our strange afternoon sleep, we wake up at 10pm.

* Temo (Skillful feat, INT) thinks the band of intellect might be having a more permanent effect! He's sure he might just be a *bit* smarter. He's been thinking a lot about all the times we need to see things that are hard to spot, and has definitely found new ways within himself to observe the world (Expertise in Perception) as well as the wagon experience giving him more confidence now with animals (Proficiency in Animal Handling). Temo also has some ideas about getting in *their* heads for a change (Tasha's Mind Whip) and thinks he might be able to even cook up a fireball now and then...!

* Nethza (Infernal Constitution feat) feels more resistant to cold and poisons now. She takes spell Gate Seal.

* Riglan (Resilient, CHA) feels like he's getting a bit better at being a "People Person" now - perhaps not enough to make a difference yet mind you (CHA moves from 8 to 9, still -1 ability overall!) and thinks he might be better at resisting magical attacks that try to convince him otherwise... (Proficiency on CHA saves). He also has some ideas about putting out fires with rain.

* Maireagh (Resilient, WIS) feels a bit like Riglan, only more along the wisdom line. She's had trouble with that. Has a feeling she's been learning ways to centre herself a bit more and resist such things.

Riglan seeks Ilsevele, or at least any of the council close to her, to let them know - and ideally let the 3 priests know - that the trees will recover, and probably faster than they think. He also has this crazy idea about using weather control to put out the fires - but we have to get close, which might require some tricky pathways.

We're reminded that the fey paths exist independently of the trees, as they're on another plane; so unless there was deliberate magical vandalism, we might emerge into a patch of ash from burned forest and any of the usual signs - an arch of bushes, ring of mushrooms etc. - showing where that exit/entrance point is may be missing, making it harder to find. Riglan had not intended to be on that side of the army but, now that it's mentioned, that could be the safest bet - the army pushes into the forest, tendrils stretching north, but might not be looking behind themselves much.

Doing this in daylight would be safer. So what about this "Caprice"? "She's somewhere sort of in the middle of the fey forest, in the oldest part, up by a pool beneath a waterfall." All we need to do is step off any fey path. We ask for help finding an entrance to an example path that might get us out behind the army. Kill two birds with one stone - a path for controlling the weather. The councillor recommends talking to a ranger! We go looking for one.

The range we find is our friend from earlier - the one rescued from Eleven Court. He can certainly help with a path that gets us past the army, but stepping *off* it means we almost certainly can't find it again. We'd need to find a new way back to this plane, and who knows where we might emerge! We're shown the entrance anyway, in case we end up back at Myth Drannor and want to try the weather thing without bothering anyone again for a pathway. Within our party, we discuss some options but then the scout offers to come along - as they can find Fey crossings for an exit from the Fey Wild ("Horizon Walker").

Temo sighs, puts his hand out to Maireagh and says, "Bonnet". She passes it over and he wears it. Maireagh thinks it's a very handsome bonnet! But he doesn't wear it as well as she does, obviously.

The scout, who we learn is called **Nivennah**, takes to, then along the path a short way. Then Riglan stops and says, "Well, this is as probably good as anywhere..." "OK!" answers Nivennah. He asks if we have rope. We do! We rope up together, even the dog, to make sure we don't get separated. Yeah - we know about *that* kind of thing, given our rather chaotic Shadowfell entry! We step off...

...dex saves all round (DC15):

* Riglan 11
* Temo 14
* Nethza 15
* Maireagh 6
* Dog 17
* Nivennah nat 20 plus mod

The three of them manage to just hold the rest of us. We've ended up on a strange net of vines, hanging over a deep purple-green glowing undergrowth chasm, but three of us have fallen; the others manage to pull us up even though Riglan's very heavy!

Maybe we won't let Riglan choose the exit point if there's ever a "next time".

We make it off the strange vines onto a huge anchor point, a weird plant with large broad, V-shaped leaves that the vines climb up and cling to. It's vast, though; each leaf is some 120-150ft long and 30ft wide! Slowly, we get down to ground level. At the base, we see the plant's base looks like a large, purple-green pineapple. Very odd. We quickly realise that "ground" still isn't "ground" here. It's colourful, spongey fungi, a canopy of sorts. Nivennah asks where we're going - Riglan says, "Oldest part, I think..." - survival 8+10, so he doesn't get a good path but does have an idea of direction.

We start off but then quickly end up on a kind of mushroom pathway that curves around and, after a while, realise we've gone in a circle... At this point, we jump to another path. Here, the ground is actual ground, but there are a lot of giant insects - very large centipedes, ants, and so-on. The sky is a streaky pink-and-orange colour. There's an unchanging soft glow on the horizon.

Half an hour later, something even more impossible. A sheer wall, more or less, that seems to be made of cracked bark. It stretches as far as we can see and goes up 60ft or so. Riglan calls a Familiar, expecting a hawk; it pops near him, surprised, because it's still in the Fey! At least the spell worked. Riglan asks it to fly up so he can see what we'd get to behind the wall. A plateau; a strange landscape (lunar, to our eyes) but soft dunes of grey glitter with colours and there are small bushes of flowers in shadow areas, with the odd tall flower here and there.

The scout asks who's the strongest... That's Riglan. The Scout casts Spider Climb on him! Riglan scuttles up the wall, then is able to use the Rope Of Mending to help people climb. Takes a while, Temo penultimate who ties the dog, then climbs the rope rather than being pulled up; then the dog is hauled up at the end.

We traverse the strange plateau for about ten minutes. It's _almost_ desolate, but there are occasional swarms of technicolour butterflies diving and sweeping in the sky. There's also a strange sense of things following us; a presence. Nethza seems in wonder at what follows so we ask what it is - she can see through illusions. She's surprised; she thought we could see them. Two very pretty giant dragonflies. But says that they want us to go a different way. It's sort of on or route, but not direct. We're cautious - they might be leading us to danger, or as lunch! But we give them the benefit of the doubt.

They lead us to a cliff, a jagged river far down, that's carved a gorge some 100ft across. The dragonflies suddenly appear - we can all see them - and start making clicking and buzzing noises. Riglan says they're calling for something but it's a name, like a person's name and he doesn't know what it is. They fly in a complex pattern, too - almost a dance.

After a moment, rising from a misty area in the chasm base, is a strange-looking orange fruit, blimp-shaped, with ridges and bumps and patterns. It glows and pulses a bit. It floats up above us and hanging below is a large basket. A goblin is sat inside, with various ropes and levers that he seems to be using to make this bizarre contraption move. The dragonflies talk to the goblin who responds in their strange language, then says in Sylvan, "Hold on - wait - hold on... Don't jump!" (and Riglan translates). The goblin pulls some levers and a side of the basket unfurls like a tongue! It forms a bridge. We climb aboard - Nivennah particularly cautious and wary. "Who are you? What's going on?" The goblin says, "It's fine. Just - you want to cross?" "Yes please!" says Riglan. "Well this is what 1 and 2 say. My name is **Flimp**." Riglan says, "Pleased to meet you, Flimp." "I am the operator of the fruit blimp." "What kind of fruit is it?" "A sort of Uglyfruit." "Is there a payment needed?" "Well, where are you going?" "We seek Caprice!" He breathes in sharply. He says that there *is* a payment, then. We must tell him a secret never shared with anyone else.

Maireagh says, "I've got this!" - and leans into whisper to Flimp, who's held a large hearing-cone to his ear. His eyes go wide; he then laughs, opens a jar, pulls a small worm out of his listening ear (!) and puts it into the jar. Then he opens a pocket in his vest which seems to be a strange portal to a bigger-on-the-inside set of racks of vials. He adds the jar. For whatever reason, clearly, he collects secret.

"Hang on!" he says, and we lurch into motion. The craft dives down into the gorge and into the mist, then breaks through below; and we end up in some kind of space *below* the plateau; as if it were now a ceiling. Waterfalls plunge down from rocky islands and the plateau above. We're taken to an area with a few pillars of rock that seem to be providing support; a whole series of plunge pools and waterfalls, bioluminescence abounds. "I can't enter her domain but I can drop you off here! I'll wait for you." "Oh! Thank you". He hands Riglan a little pouch; "...so you can find your way back here." There are breadcrumbs within. Temo says, "I've read this story. We'll use those, but we'll also use my ball bearings. In case anything eats either of them!"

The hawk, having flown alongside, lands on Riglan's shoulder like a parrot.

As Riglan drops the breadcrumbs, each one pops out a pair of feet and a small pair of eyes and hands! As Temo puts down the ball bearing, the little creatures seem excited and run up to them, making high-pitched squeaking noises and playing with the bearing. One tries to bounce it. Another tries to lift it and gets squashed underneath; squeezes out to the side then pops back into shape. Full Ghibli small cute creature moment.

Flimp indicates the direction - towards four waterfalls into a big plunge pool, horseshoe-shaped. Riglan, survival 22, finds a fairly safe path down. As we get near to the end, there's a loud menacing purr... Walking along a large vine nearby is a pink and yellow-coloured, spotted leopard of some kind. But the spots are more like floral patterns. Riglan casts Speak With Animals and says, "Hello, impressive creature!" "Why do you intrude? Do you seek death or riches?" Maireagh asks, "Does anyone ever say death?!" "Yes! Yes, we do have people saying death - people who have lost their will to live. People who no longer feel the world is for them." Riglan says, "Well, we seek neither. We seek only an audience and knowledge." "Oh! I see. Well, in that case, you may pass. Come with me!" and turns to walk along the vine.

Riglan, perception 17. The leopard isn't actually walking on the vine. It seems to be walking partly on and partly on something else he can't see. Riglan gets on the vine to try it out. There's something invisible; an invisible floor. He tells the others. Maireagh helps us with See Invisibility; and now we see it clearly. A stone platform with steps leading down to a currently-invisible bathhouse (!) on the pool's edge. Little stone piers. "Maybe she's in there?" says Riglan and heads down. The others follow. To anyone else, we'd seem to be walking in thin air.

With invisibility sight, the mist layers are, now, curiously *not* visible. Thundering waterfall sounds a replaced by a gentle sound of maybe just one, gentle waterfall. That's not quite how See Invisibility should work, we think, yet here we are. Riglan calls out into the bathhouse, "Anyone there? Are you decent?!" There's a flicker of soft light, then a soft orange glow from within. A few small birds come flying out from inside, then a voice says, "You may enter" in Sylvan so Riglan translates then heads in (Temo can't speak that and isn't wearing the helm as it would squish the bonnet!).

We are greeted immediately by a tiny, gossamer-winged fairy holding a lantern. This is the voice - loud, deep, masculine voice from this little fairy. "Come. Follow me. I will bring you to Caprice." Riglan starts second-guessing, wondering if *this* is Caprice, or the leopard was... But he plays along anyway; he voices his concerns about this being a game, people might not be who they say they are. Nethza says she can cast True Sight so does that for Temo.

We follow the fairy-actually-is-a-fairy into the bathhouse, to a part where there's a pool covered in waterlilies, and sat in the water at the far end is a nymph. Riglan says, "Hello, my name is Riglan". A resonant, melodic sound full of layered harmonies rings out, but is heard *in our heads* - "Welcome to my pool. You already know who I am. Why have you come here? It is not an easy journey." Temo steps in. "We are here in search of knowledge. We hear great things about your wisdom and intellect." Persuasion 27.

Caprice is standing as she's speaking, out of the water from the far end of the pool. The waterlilies move with her, forming a flowing gown. She walks along shallow stone steps at the edge towards us. She makes her cheeks glow red, but it's obviously deliberate; "Goodness. You're so sweet!" and touches the water; a glitter sparkle spreads out from it. CHA saves all round! Temo recognises the spell; not a charm spell; a truth spell.

* Temo: 8, doesn't blow luck point
* Riglan, with his new CHA save abilities; Nat 1 + 4, sigh. 5.
* Maireagh: 7
* Nethza: 6+11->17
* Nivennah: 15

Only Nethza is now able to lie! Temo recognises some of this, and says "A good idea. It will help you trust our intentions." Caprice answers, "Well, is it I who needs to trust you, who needs to trust you, or you who needs the greater trust." Temo chuckles; "Good point!". She adds, "Why did you risk coming here? What is it you need to know?" "There is a creature that is very dangerous and we do not know how to defeat it. But we do not know if you do either." "I can't defeat Azalin Rex! You've wasted your trip." She looks to the group. "You have given up a valuable secret for it." Temo laughs. "Of course we don't mean Azalin. That would be silly." "Oh?! There is another." "Most certainly. Perhaps you'd like to guess what it is?" persuasion 28. She says, "I love games! Come."

She steps fully out of the water. "Do you like tea and cake?" Riglan answers, "We love tea and cake." She claps her hands and many small Harengon come out with a full set - tea trolley, table, chairs, cloth, and so-on. Caprice sits and sips.

Riglan sits and says, "Trust starts here, I guess!" and drinks. He doesn't keel over, so the others follow! Unusual tea. Tastes like flowers. "Wow! This is very good tea" says Riglan. She answers - now with voice, in Common, "I would hope so, these are made from flower petals preserved for a hundred years. I have the last known batch of them. These flowers no longer grow." - Riglan slows down a bit to appreciate it more! "Maybe one day..." - but then to Riglan telepathically - "...maybe one day you could bring this flower back." Riglan thinks back, "That would be an honour!" - CON save 17. He coughs for a minute; a small seed! "Thank you!" he says, and puts it into his pouch. She warns him, though; **"It can only grow somewhere where love thrives and hatred is held at bay."**

"So tell me" she says, again in voice now. "This creature. Is it small? Big?" Temo answers, "It is big." "Is it rare?" Temo says, "I am not sure" - because it's from another plane and might be common there. "Intriguing!" - and a battle of wits starts between him and her. Temo's persuasion, including his boosted intelligence modifier against her insight; but when she speaks, he has to insight, including intelligence.

He asks of her - boosted persuasion 7->RT 10->29 total; "I am three sets of five kinds. What creature am I?"

She thinks. "So that can't be a dragon... Because there are 24 types of dragons..." - but her persuasion beats his insight; he is forced to apologise and say, "Oh! My mistake! I did mean a dragon, I only know of 15."

Temo tries naming dragons, to see if she'll add to the rest. So he says "there *are* 15 - listen - "... and list the chromatics, metallics and then gems. Caprice chuckles. "What? You forgot!" - and a fairy dragon appears next to her; and moon dragon; solar; "so that's 18...", then three progenitor dragons - Ruby Sardior, Platinum Bahammut, and all-chroma Tiamat, "...and that's 21..." - and she looks at Temo, who says, "wow, your reputation is well deserved, but surely there aren't more than 21!" - persuasion **nat 20+19 (39!)** - and she names a time dragon, spirit dragon and death dragon. These are accompanied by illusions and "**death dragon**" is unmistakable.

Temo says, "Ah, and in this, you answer my earlier riddle."

"Oh did I get it right? Is it a death dragon?"

"Yes, you bested me! It's a death dragon."

"Shall we play another game?"

"OK, sure. Your rules."

"Let's play a game of storytelling. I want to hear all the stories that I haven't heard. I would like to hear the story of **how the death dragon kills all of you**" while casually refilling tea cups. "How does that story go?"

Temo thinks for a minute, then says, "Well, it hasn't happened yet, but it could easily do so. And with what I've seen, I can tell you what I think the story would be?" She agrees, and he launches into it his performance (9->10RT + 10 + 4, 24). He launches into a story and, it's a good story, and he tries to make it a bit dark - he is the last person standing and the others kill him rather than the dragon. But she rolls 26, besting him and just adds in lots of nasty questions to make a very much darker story than intended.

Insight with all mods 23, including luck point; he deliberately leaves inconsistencies. Her persuasion only 13! "But that story doesn't add up" she says, "Wouldn't you just have killed it?" she asks, and gets almost irate about how in fact all of the story setup falls apart if you just kill the dragon. At this Temo laughs, and says, "Oh I don't mean to offend, but *nobody* knows how to kill a *death* dragon!" "Did you not try to kill it?" "Yes, and it just comes back every time." "Oh. You don't know how to kill the death dragon? Oh! I see!"

At this point Temo's RT-based 29 persuasion exceeds her 23 insight and she doesn't see the trap. Instead, she is pleased to be proving her knowledge and wisdom. "A death dragon looks for a worthy soul. A worthy soul must be sacrificed to purge the hold of undead upon it, the very thing that animates it. For your purposes, why not just banish it? It's not from your realm; it's from Krynn - a totally different plane. Tell the story again! But this time, banish it."

So Temo repeats the start, but this time, has Nethza able to try banishment. For colour, it doesn't succeed the first time; Caprice interjects, "Yes of course, it can use its force of will three times!" and Temo agrees, so we have to keep fighting. This time, though, that has changed the history of the story and it doesn't get the breath weapon back, so we can fight back. He draws out the story until it's used those resistances up and we're able to push it away with banishment.

Caprice says, "Very well"... The zone of truth fades. "You got what you wanted and I'm bored now!" Temo says, "Well, it was fun playing. Thank you." She smiles and walks over - "I know you tricked me!" and flicks her finger. The bonnet flies off his head. "If you ever trick me again, *I will have your soul!* - walks into the pool and smiles, giggling.

The fairy says, "I will show you the door!"

We follow.

The yellow-and-pink leopard is outside. It's very curious. "Did you get what you asked for?" ti asks for in Sylvan. "Yes" answers Riglan. "Did she give it willingly?" "Of course not!" "Oh dear. I'd better warn all the other animals. She's going to be pissed off!" and then we hear a shriek of frustration from the bathhouse. "Hurry now!" says the leopard. It leads us away. It nuzzles hits head in Riglan's hand; "I for one am glad you got what you needed." "Thank you! I hope you don't have too much trouble." "She just needs time. A month will do!" and it bounds off. The weather back towards the bathhouse is now cloudy and drizzling!

We follow the little breadcrumbs that call out. As we walk past each one they put up their arms to be picked up. So we get them, and Riglan asks each if they want to keep the ball bearing (yes in all cases!). One had already assumed so and graffitied all over it! We put them back in "our house" - the bag - and get back to the blimp. "What have you done?!" he asks, point back to a now-huge thundercloud. "I was very close to not keeping my word!" Riglan answers, "Well, she's a bad loser." "You didn't know that? Well I guess sometimes ignorance and courage are the same things - hurry!" - and we take off, already being caught in the storm a bit. A rough ride.

We make it to the other side of the chasm and disembark. He reminds Maireagh about what she gave though - "Thank you very much for that precious secret." "What secret?!" "But if told you, it wouldn't be a secret!"

Now we need to find a way out. Riglan helps. Scout survival adv., 18. It takes about an hour! The scout is apologetic; there seem to be no doors nearby... So we just walk back the way we came - even from this distance, with the hawk's help, we can see the giant pineapple so we start back that way and keep looking. Riglan survival 15+10 -> 25; this time it's him that notices a strange, soft shimmer, as we've got all the way back past the strange pineapple and net of vines - the shimmer though is *under* the net of vines. The best we can think of is to hang under the vines and jump up - but then we remember our temporary magic carpet! Perfect. It can take us in carefully-chosen pairs, one controlling and one escaping. The last person has to be quite acrobatic to jump up *and* pull the carpet through - Temo tries it... RT-based acrobatics, 26.

## Fey fast-forward day 56 (probably!) around 6pm

He's the last to flip through. There's a strange reversal of gravity thing. And we arrive in a charred part of the forest, lying in the ashes! Riglan perception 19. Strange; the fires up ahead are quite close, certainly within 5 miles, ruined dead trees all around, for several miles behind now; but the sun is *setting* to the west. "Well" says Riglan, "we've lost at least the night and most of the day - maybe more days - we'd better act quickly, before the sun drops completely."

The fire seems to be about four miles away. His spell will hit *some* of the wall of fire, but not much.We have to risk getting closer. He begins casting and gets on the flying carpet with Temo controlling, to speed towards the wall; the others will fly, but Nivennah and the dog are too slow. Within 20 minutes, the spell is up and the first effects are building; he's within two miles. He can't hit all of it, but using the hawk, he can see it's getting dangerously closed and we do risk being spotted. But we have to risk it, and get closer. Another 10 minutes and 1 mile later, the clouds come over and the wind picks up. We're about a mile away - that's got to do. We land and hide in the ash. Temo starts to call Tiny Hut for cover.

* L8 Control Weather takes 10 minutes of carpet flight.
* Tries to change wind direction to Northerly (from North to South); he wants it to blow more strongly, get cooler and start to get cloudly. It works, but takes about 20 minutes. The carpet has reached 1 mile and lands.
* The wind goes from moderate to strong. Light clouds become overcast. Temperature drops.
* Now he tries to get more rain. Strong wind is strong enough. This takes effect in just 10 minutes. Rain starts falling on us, and is getting most of the line of fire. He needs more though.
* He focuses hard and tries to get the rain to fall harder - but it takes a full 40 minutes, with the others catching up and hiding in the hut. The sun's down, but the rain becomes torrential.

Riglan needs to keep sight of the sky. He hunkers down, getting wet ash and rolling around in it in his cloak, until he's grey and hard to spot. He waits to see how the fires die down. D6->4; it takes *two hours* for the fires to be doused. He's very bedraggled. Once they're out, he pokes an arm into the hut and makes beckoning motions, so Temo dismisses the hut and the whole party is then in the downpour.

"Why are we standing out here in the rain?" asks Maireagh and Riglan says, "Isn't it great? Just look at it!" "It reminds me of graves as child", stomping her boots in the mid - Riglan answers, "Yes! Exactly! Childhood memories!" Temo answers, "Not *my* childhood! Can we get out of this?! Where do we go?" and looks at Nivennah, but he can't see entrances to the fey paths. Riglan asks if he knows or can see any nearby large trees; we could tree-travel us. Nivennah spots a big tree standing not too far away but it looks in bad shape! We head over and Riglan speaks with it; it's alive, but very hurt; nature 21, Cure Wounds should help. He drops a healing spirit, tells the tree he's going to help, but it should try to channel its health back into its back and avoid leaves for now to avoid attracting attention - wait until next spring! - and tries Plant Growth to help the area. He's hoping to channel it into the tree but actually the area bursts with life, plants all over the place. New shoots and plants growing up out of the ash all around, but to his relief they don't get too big so should, with luck, go unnoticed by the distant army.

Now we're able to travel. He casts the spell, and we end up at the now-familiar tree South of Myth Drannor. Job done. We walk in.

### 9:30pm

We get to Myth Drannor. Inevitable questions; we've only been away for the day, not more than one; a relief, but logistics nightmare since we've been awake about 6 hours but it's "only" 9:30pm. We explain about what we've discovered and ask what plans, if any, they've formed so far for a battle with Azalin.

* **The Elven armies are gathering - a small splinter faction of the Tel Quessir have even agreed! There's the Evermeet Guard, quite a few conscripts and so-on. Of course, a contingent must remain at Myth Drannor to protect against incursions, but there's still a ~600-strong army after that *before* the Tel Quessir are accounted for. They don't know exact numbers for them but suspect another 300. Not bad.**

The Cormyrean army has been located. It's cleared the forest via the road and they've sent an emissary to make contact. "If you wish, we can bring you to see them?" Sounds good, we can bring them up to speed. It'd take about an hour. That's not going to be too late for them. We can't reveal the location of Myth Drannor so we can just say we're "in the forest" in some location they're keeping secret.

Once we're shown to the fey path - takes about 15 minutes - and on our way, we discuss concerns about security. The elves have a lot of magic and can see impersonators more easily than the humans. We don't know what might've happened to the Cormyr army, so we should be cautious. A friendly army that might contain one or two pairs of unfriendly eyes and ears.

We exit a few metres from a road through the forest only 20 minutes later. We take careful note of the fey path exit. Very heavily trodden! *Thousandss* of hoofprints; a much bigger army than Riglan expected by the looks of it. It's not hard to follow! It exits the forest and over low hills, where we can see huge encampment. LOTS of tents. Takes us about 20-25 minutes on the road to reach it. We just march on in!

Of course we're met by guards. "You must be from the Lord's Alliance" he says. Temo says, "Yes indeed!" "Please come with me to the General's tent." "Thank you." We travel through the encampment. Thousands of people, hundreds of horses. We go past a huge marquee where people are eating, and reach a rather grand circular tent with coloured pennants. Nope, not that either! Seems to be some kind of recreation area. Eventually we get to a small blue and yellow striped tent, guards posted outside. We are invited in.

Inside, is a grand hall! Arched marble stairs lead up onto a second floor and there's a huge foyer, 25ft high, chandelier, beautiful frescoes. Tapestries, suits of armour, huge wooden table carrying a marble sculpture - all of it! We're pointed down the hall. "You'll find everyone down there, in the war room. Second door to the left." We follow the instructions. Maireagh is quite surprised, unsure how they do this spell. Temo knows it's some kind of other plane, like putting us in a bag of holding. "It has Morden Kainen's trademark style of magic" she says, "a bit like the sanctum". Nethza says "It's a bit much don't you think?" and we all nod!

Behind us, we leave muddy footprints - but magically animated mops clean up behind us... Riglan then remembers that he's covered head to foot in the mud and ash.

We walk into the war room. Huge, converted dining room maybe. A dozen people in there, including - a voice calls - "Riglan! Goodness!" - and the Knight Commande of the Knights Of Samilar's face appears from behind a row of people stood by a large table. Riglan shouts out, "Lady Ushien! You made it!" "Yes, we did! And we've had an escort. My goodness, I'm so close to the lands of my birth! It's just over Dragon Reach. Tethyr. I haven't been back here for, maybe 50 years. What a mighty journey! The men will be glad to see you..." - and then someone clears their throat - a mage. "Forgive the interruption, but perhaps we could continue the pleasantries outside, afterwards?! Welcome, though! I am War Mage **Aberness**. Welcome to the nerve centre of the Cormyrean Front. You are my guests. Anything you desire, the house will provide for you. In the mean time, let me bring you up to speed on what we've been discussing."

Riglan says, "Thank you - forgive me - just one moment..." and activates Detect Magic, then takes a close look, one by one, at everyone in the room. But at first of course it's an explosion of colour as this entire domain is magical by definition! He then notices various magical points of power on people in the room - artefacts they carry - emanations of pure magic from some, such as Sir Isteval in a corner, and another paladin as well as a war mage and Ushien. Divine magic. Nothing untoward; no illusion or enchantment. He asks Netzha, quietly, "see anything strange?" "No, everyone is same as they seem. No shape-shifters." He nods; "Yes, same".

Aberness clears his throat again. "Any time you are ready! We understand the need for caution. And now that you're satisfied, may I please draw your attention to the map..."

Time is spent describing strategy.

* The **13** of the Knights of Samilar - 6 knights, 6 squires and Ushien.
* Purple Dragon Knights number **1,500** - the full "expeditionary force". They've gone all-in.
* A full **50** war mages. That sounds like a lot.
* Roughly **6,000 thousand** additional troops. 2000 archers/crossbows, 1000 cavalry, 3000 footsoldiers.
* Some **500** support staff - cooks, stable boys, cart drivers and so-on.

They say they've been in contact with the elves and fed information by the scouts. They point out where they think the undead army is; Temo helps narrow that down and points out that there are additional incursions from the Shadowfell. They note their army is sweeping the East edge - that's in line with picking up more from the Killing Fields.

They seem quite bullish. But it transpires that they're expecting thousands of elves and we have to break the bad news. Also we talk about the way that Azalin's generals can raise dead; and then there's the death dragon. At this, they realise their encampment is very exposed! We say we're going to draw the dragon away and try to kill it, but yes, right now they're very exposed.

One mage thinks he can deal with it... Heads outside a while... Comes back and says he has it covered, but it takes a lot of resources. We need to deal with the dragon. And draw it away; and one general takes of a bracelet with teleportation runes on it. Nethza has to memorise them. A portable teleportation circle! The war mages use them. It's how the avoid needing thousands of rations - cartloads of water and food - with the army. We *must* keep that very secret as it portals back to the army directly. "This is a way for you to get to us if you need to. Don't forget, it takes a minute to inscribe the runes."

Fair enough - as the army moves further from the forest, even fey paths would exit many days away from where they are.

Riglan raises the idea of skirmishes to whittle down numbers. That's not really an army's style; one mage even asks, "Isn't that your job?!" - yes, true enough. We're just worried about how many dead the bad guys might pick up on the way up to Zhentil Keep. The Cormyreans still plan a siege there - on faith from the visions. That's all we have, after all.

We break for food. We're invited to a banquet inside the magical space, but Ushien and Isteval invite us to meet the troops and catch up with the Samilar knights. We're filthy anyway so it's a good excuse to politely exit and do what, to be frank, we'd rather do.

So we get to catch up with the crusade; and Isteval. Lesther has headed back to Cormyr as he's not a war mage. Ushien is beaming with pride for her men. "I brought them past the Well Of Dragons; the stories there - the boneyards, fallen dragons; what a sight. It's like an elephant graveyard but for dragons!"

But we also have to talk about the dangers. The horrors that await - but keeping centred; not giving into hopelessness. Isteval talks of certain death, but making sure our deaths count! Temo, afterwards, says, "Well said - although I intend to live forever!"

Perception 21, a few people have gathered. There's a surprising few Cormyrean knights who scoff. "The elves keep to themselves. They choose to be isolationist. They choose to see race above all else" - and so-on. One eve says "And what magic do they have? Animals. Stags. Nonsense." Riglan stands as the others in the party see him getting angry and all speak at once to calm him - but quietly, he says, "yes, animals, stags... Nonsense..." and calls no less than 16 wolves, snarling and angry right behind the naysayers. He gives a little speech about power - that these creatures could be poisonous giant wasps, constricting snakes or worse; but he is not very powerful; many elves have greater; and Azalin has worse still. And nothing nice, like wolves or wasps! Twisted, evil, nightmare creatures, draining life and invading the mind to drive you mad. We should be glad of any allies.

He also, though, does say that there is no shame here. Minds must be spoken. Views must not fester. He doesn't agree with the viewpoint, and hopes that a mind spoken is also a mind opened. "I just hope that they show, is all!" says one, nervously draining a drink. "Me too" says Riglan. "But I'm sure they will."

### 11:30pm

Later as others have gone away, he sighs. "I hope that's a minority. I think it is. But we must not ignore the differences and the history here. These two groups must fight together. We might need to find a way, amongst all the other things we are doing, to improve understanding between these groups of people."

Isteval nods in agreement. A Knight of Samilar says, "I find this sort of thinking so... Surprising. We read epic poems that tell of the ages past, of the glorious alliances between elves and man. The golden age that this brought. These stories always glorify those periods of history. One would've thought that's what those stories were for. I'm sure that there were conflicts and differences of opinion and these kinds of disagreements and dissent at any point in time, but that's why these stories were written - so future generations could learn the lessons that were hard-won."

Riglan thinks back to Vip and Johm and says, "It seems not all nations or cities want their population to know all of the stories. Usually, they have good reasons for concern, but usually, it seems to me, increasingly, they are misguided."

Even 60 years ago, when the Netherese were fought, the elven battle was within Cormanthor - most people outside didn't know about it. Myth Drannor is fairy tale to them. It was Cormyr that drove them out of Sembia.

Isteval asks if we need a tent, or if we're running off! We've been up about 8-9 hours, so we can't sleep. We  bid our farewells; a bit of a heart-to-heart with Isteval, Riglan saying we owe our lives to him - he helped a lot with the dragon, just by being near by... He responds, "When you see that dragon, give it hell".

On the way back, Maireagh says, "That's a point - Isteval was with us before. He won't be this time."

## Day 57
### 1am

We get to Myth Drannor. A hive of activity. We're more tired now, maybe we can sleep... Maireagh makes her special tea and we try...

### 9am

...and it works; we wake up a few hours later. The first thing Riglan thinks of when he wakes up and says out loud before anything else - "Oh, by the hells - that Shadowfell beast. Whatever it was, that Temo detected out there, near Elven Court... We never found it. It's still out there.... Oh. Um. Also, good morning..."

Temo says, "I guess we're trying to kill a dragon today?!"

We start discussing options. Riglan has a nasty spell which he can try which it'd really need to work hard to fight (Feeblemind). But we'd need a few like that and he can only do one. It turns out that if Nethza can keep back a spell, we can get the dragon injured enough *and* she's within range for a weapon hit, she thinks she can banish it in a way that it can't escape (no saving throw!) but we'd need to protect her so she can hold concentration (Banishing Smite instead of Banishment).

That feels more on-brand! Lots of damage as quick as we can, no particular complex plan or careful counting; just get it down low and then get it in range somehow.

* Temo figures he can use his sling to aim 
* He and Riglan could be on the flying carpet
* Maireagh and Nethza can fly independently
* **The dog, for the first time ever, is probably unable to help with this one!**
* Intellect Fortress from Maireagh on herself and Nethza for WIS saves; OR she can use Aura Of Purity, if we keep close, which helps us all for wisdom but doesn't help against the breath weapon.

Almost overlooked:

* Lighting from the cloud. Control Weather is too slow. Just have to deal with that as it comes!

Escape plan:

* Transport Via Plants is our only option
* This means that when we get to wherever we intend to try and tempt the dragon to appear, we'll need to know about nearby trees - or we'd better be good at running, because we figure the dragon won't appear all by itself! Ground troops are probable

OK, so we've some idea about fight and some idea about an escape plan but no idea about how to get the dragon to appear. Azalin just manifested it that time. He's not going throw it at us for no reason... But if he thinks he can harvest us for his army; he's seen something of our powers, must know that we scuppered the majority of his plans for Elven Court if not quite everything and might well be tempted. He's seen us take the dragon down, but that was six of us, plus the dog and horse (!), including a paladin.

Does it amount, then, to - in essence - some form of goading Azalin Rex? Here we are, come and get us?

We consider divination, dreamwalking etc. then Maireagh says - "Why not just send him a message?" but what message, and is that enough? Temo suggests an illusory dragon. If Azalin shredded Lesther's our-party illusion with ice because he thought it was *us*, and *not* because he saw through it, then there's a chance that ruse would work. Nethza thinks that's not bad, but also says, "But Riglan, if you wanted to use your marble against Azalin, this would be the time... Stop him seeing through that illusion... Or perhaps if he's trying to determine whether or not Temo is taunting him to try and force a reaction."

That also seems to be about as good as plan ever really needs to be.

Last question: Where. We figure open ground; easier to move, above the trees will be fiddly, lots of things hidden by the canopy could attack us and we'd not see it. So that means behind the fire line again, which hampers exit. But if we find out where Azalin is, we can come out on the edge of the destroyed forest nearby, or as close as we can within it and walk to that edge; now we've trees, and clear sky.

Maireagh once again is pragmatic regarding Azalin's location. "Can't you just ask the plants? The forest is all connected!"

Good point. Riglan asks around for people who can direct him to a big, ancient tree - the kind of tree that's likely to be plugged into everything. Then he casts L3 Speak With Plants and asks the question. "The evil that kills the forest to the East - where is it now?" "Marching North. A trail of destruction behind it. Corrupted the creatures! Killing anything it can find. North of here, now, but to the East. Seems headed for the Moonsea..." - and Riglan even gets a mental sense of the location; on our map, looks like Hillsfar. But they're *marching*; not burning; the Elves didn't rise to it (and Riglan's weather control maybe added to the mix).

We learn that Hillsfar is an independent trading town! Nobody controls it; nobody's warned them; cannon fodder. Rangers calculate the army marching 24h a day could be there in, roughly, a day; but we want to draw the dragon out, which will rely on Sending only given the distances. We'll battle the dragon in the open, and the town will surely be able to see; and *that* might convince them to evacuate!

* This means Sending-only; too far for illusions.
* Goad Azalin by saying we've defeated his attempts to get the elven undead *and* we're evacuating Hillsfar.
* Azalin probably can't send ground forces in that case *but* we shouldn't bet on it - he has Shadowfell paths at his disposal, just as we have the Fey paths.

**We ask rangers for help with a path that gets us as close to Hillsfar as they can!**

The best they can do is to get us within maybe 8 hours on foot of Hillsfar. Tel'Quessir land is part of the problem; they can't drop us in the middle of it, and we can't walk through it.

Riglan didn't want to blow Wind Walk - but no choice. Time is very short! The elves lead us on the fey path and we thank them as we follow it; we exit into forest, and Riglan casts his spell. We become clouds.

Flying towards Hillsfar, we see a beautiful-looking hill rising out of the pastoral landscape, close to the shores of the moon sea. Farms all around. There's a strange arrangement of windmills all around. The town has walls. At the top of the hill is a small rise with a large windmill atop - some kind of strange centrepiece! Water wheels attached; a spring comes out of this hill, rather improbably. A lucky find - some under-pressure underground source, one assumes.

Our sense of scale from our rate of travel is off. We get closer and suddenly realise it's - at least in the main - a halfling town; the town wall is barely 15ft high and the buildings, relative to what we're used to, are tiny. Riglan mentally shrugs - not much to hide behind here! - so finds a field of corn, that seems big and not close to any people, and touches down there; the party follows and the painfully slow one minute of turning back to our corporeal form starts.

Well, that's the easy bit!

### 11am, Hillsfar

A farmer approaches as we're forming up. Awkward. He shouts, "Where have you come from, giant?!" and Riglan answers, "I'm a Firbolg. We flew here using special magic because we're in a hurry. I wonder - could you please direct us - is there someone perhaps in charge? Who looks after the charge?" "Yes! You need to speak to the council of millers." He points to the big windmill. "Thank you very much!" "You want the Head Miller." "What's the Head Miller's name?" "**Brady**! But *ask* for the Head Miller." "Understood. Have a good days sir!" and Riglan leads us on.

People stare as we walk through into the village - Riglan's stature in particular seems to draw attention. It's bustling. People moving in and out, to/from farms. There's a market spread across two levels in the main part of town. The whole place is criss-crossed with raised canals and aqueducts; water features everywhere and fed into every house. Most are covered and we might not have understood what they were, but for seeing one under repair.

Some kids point at Maireagh's dog, which we've brought this far in case of non-dragon trouble. Nethza too. It's more a 'look up in awe' thing for Riglan. Hats are doffed at Temo, who responds in kind. Lots of baked goods, vegetables, pies; handicrafts, clothes, toys... Riglan says, "It's like a big Sungift!"

Main roads have small side streets lined with narrow houses. Carts are everywhere. We follow the path up to the big windmill, which only takes about 5 minutes. We reach the hilltop, with the "lump" above holding the windmill. Around it are three buildings, one storey each, all connected by small external, open-air (but roofed) corridors, almost like an old miniature university. We walk around, as we have to almost circle the whole thing before we find a proper way in. There's a paved are all around. The water source for the aqueducts seems to come from here. Three insignias, one on each building. Temo sees Halfling script, a little unusual but readable. "The council of bakers", "The council of inn keepers", "The council of millers". Ah! "In here!" says Temo, and strides confidently forward.

Riglan has to bend over and slightly crouch to fit inside; 6ft ceiling, light fittings to avoid. DEX 9, he knocks into a few! Temo is told, "Sir! You can't bring your giant in here!" so Riglan says, "Oh, sorry!" and just sits down somewhere, against a wall. We're approached by a young woman who asks why we're here and Temo asks to see the Head Miller. She goes to a doorway and starts shouting for "Papa!" and eventually an 80-ish (things Temo) year old man emerges. Portraits on the wall show that they are Miller by name as well as trade (which Temo knows isn't that uncommon in pastoral Halfling society).

Brady doesn't want to keep secrets and insists we just tell him what's going on. So Temo lays it on the line. There's a sense of feeling abandoned. He asks where the army is; learns Elven Court has fallen; why had the elves not told them? Persuasion 30... Temo lets him know that it might be here in a day.

Brady becomes quite scared - almost panicked - that they should "ring the alarm", and after a moment of trying to calm him down from that we learn that in fact it's the right way. It'll draw in people from remote farmsteads and there are many out working who may be up to an hour away from the front gate. The Head's son is sent off to ring the alarm.

In terms of evacuation locations - East is really the only way, but there's an inlet of sea in the way that makes it harder (though there *is* road). There's no escape there, though; they'd be trapped between the forest and the sea. Maps are consulted. Riglan realises the only safe place is the sea! (Survival Nat 20+10). He just doesn't know enough. Is the army coming directly here, or more Eastward? Is it a wide spread-out front or a group? They decide East is no good - they'd be trapped by forest and sea before long and if Azalin went that way, they'd be dead. They make the call to head West. Close to the forest but not within (Tel'Quessir).

### Midday

What can we do to help? "Buy us some time. We're trying to go as fast as we can, but it'll take us several hours". Some who'd come to town due to the alarm, have now headed back out to their farmsteads and homes to pack food, travel belongings and so-on. The head Miller thinks they might be 2-3 hours away from being finished, but most others packed within an hour. At least! Normally a full orderly evacuation would take a day. They're rushing it as it is.

We decide to try and delay Azalin the only way we can - stop the dragon, as it's too fast and would catch the evacuees easily. We head sort of South-East, trying to go towards the approaching army, cross-country. It takes about an hour to get beyond the farms.

### 2pm

A bit further on - just in case the dragon can actually teleport here! - "Better send the message to Azalin" says Riglan. "I wish we'd got to know them..." says Temo; "...no, you don't" responds Riglan - thinking about how much harder it seems to get once you really start to *care*. We figure the dragon would take a good 10-15 minutes to get to the town from here.

Temo sends his message:

* "We've defeated your attempts to raise the elven undead. We're evacuating Hillsfar. We'll keep thwarting your plans and soon your army will fall!"

There's a thundering response! Raspy, dry-sounding. It rises in volume throughout.

* "**FOOL**! The hubris of thinking to highly of yourself. NOTHING you do is unknown to me. I know exactly where you are. Time to watch your whole world **BURN**!" - and yes, that's more than 25 words.

Impossibly - not far away, in the South, much closer than expected! - a storm cloud brews over the forest.

We start running, towards it. We want more distance. Riglan is constantly watching for trees. The cloud takes about an hour to meet us, as we travel towards it - a good 4 miles further S-E. This also tells us that the army - assuming that cloud is moving at 200ft - is much less than half a day away, certainly not a full day. We have no idea how they've made such good time!

It's about a mile out. The cloud now starts to spread out, a good mile wide, a bit like last time. It parts with a purple crackle of energy, thunderous sound. The dragon emerges, about 1000ft away now, wings spreading dramatically, dragging cloud with it, exposing for a moment a strange core within the cloud, some kind of crackling rift; **the cloud hides a portal**! Riglan perception 24. It's definitely a Shadowfell glimpse beyond. The cloud hides a Shadowfell portal; Caprice told us that this creature is not from there, so Azalin might be using this portal for all kinds of things, not just the dragon, hidden by cloud. But that *does* mean that - dragon aside - this portal is a fast-travel scheme for at least some of his forces. That would explain the wights at Elven Court.

Riglan calls to the group, "He fast travels using the Shadowfell. I hope he can only do that once a day! When we're done with this dragon, we need to get back to that town as fast as we possibly can... He might send more forces. Remember how the cloud 'withdrew' back to him last time." Temo, arcana 21; he sees arcane threads that seem to be connected between the cloud and dragon. When the dragon disappeared, it sort of absorbed the cloud into itself. Temo shouts, "If we banish the dragon, it *might* take the portal with it, I see connections!"

Temo pulls out the carpet and Riglan gets on. The dog takes cover by some dense bushes. Maireagh and Nethza take to the skies, Maireagh calling to the dog, "I'll be back soon!" and we all start heading towards the dragon at full tilt. 260ft closing speed!

740ft... 480ft... **220ft**... Initiative!

* Temo 19
* Nethza 18
* Maireagh 18
* Riglan 7

Temo call outs loudly, "Stop! Or we'll overshoot!" and the carpet stops. Then he aims and readies the sling to fire at the dragon as soon as it is in range. 120ft ought to do it.

Nethza continues flying (60ft) towards the dragon, pulling ahead of us. 180ft to the dragon... And disappears. Becomes invisible. Maireagh does something similar, but 30ft in her case (190ft to dragon) and casts Aura Of Purity - shouts "don't get any further away from me!"

The dragon does its shifting thing, teleporting-kinda 40ft forwards, then moves 80ft more... 60ft from Nethza. It screams! Echos of impending death - WIS saves for fear. ADV thanks to aura.

* Temo 20
* Riglan 29
* Maireagh 18
* Nethza 16 + 5 aid via reaction from Maireagh

DC18. We all make it. It's close enough - Temo fires. He hits - 34 damage - and it looks like *this* time, it does the expected damage. The dragon, seeing no effect from fear and being hit, decides to close in, heading for the magic carpet. As it passes Nethza, who was hoping to cast Booming Blade on it, it banks around to keep some distance - it must have Blindsight. It ends up about 10ft from Maireagh and 25-30ft from the carpet.

Riglan casts L3 Conjure Beasts for two CR1 giant eagles to harry the dragon.

* Giant eagles 12

...and shouts "keep it occupied!" at them, then drops in his bear totem at Maireagh's location to keep us all within its aura; 21 temp HP all round and commands the carpet to swing sideways, out of the direct line of flight the dragon was taking, but not too far so if he needs to give chase, we at least have a chance.

This turns out to be a terrible plan - to our horror the dragon "phases" **RIGHT ON TOP OF US** on the carpet. Temo and Riglan both take 7 necrotic, Temo - int-based ACRO check, adv., sling warns him which helps - commands the carpet to dive as he senses the danger; 19+10->29. We are now directly underneath, but not crushed by the dragon and the carpet isn't destroyed (a bit damaged - some rips - it takes damage too).

We're in melee range. Temo has to do what he has to do - aims and fires, straight up; he gets no disadvantage as he takes time to aim despite close range, and Riglan's distracting the creature for sneak. He does hit - a stroke of luck - 31 damage, not great, could be worse. He shouts to Riglan, "Watch out, gotta move!" and pulls the carpet about 10-15 ft up and away in front of it. As we leave the 10ft range, it *bites*. And it goes for Temo, who's been at the very nasty end of this before! It looks likely to hit; in desperation Temo tries Silvery Barbs *and it works* (8+11 against AC 18, then 5+11). It just misses. He gives Maireagh advantage. (It has a Legendary Action claw attack but can't move out of turn and we're too far away).

Nethza acts; she gets within 30ft, invokes Hexblade's Curse, then sends out her familiar Eldritch Blasts. Hit, hit, hit! 3d10 is only 3,1,1 but +10 each, so 35 total. She strafes sideways to keep close to Maireagh's aura but keep the party widely spaced.

Maireagh throws her hammers, the first attack with advantage. Hit; 2d8+8+4d6 including Arcane Jolt. Another 35! She throws again - hits! 2d8+8 -> 12. She holds her ground.

The dragon swings around, pulling away from from the flying carpet and towards Nethza - it's trying to line us up. It can't get Nethza or one eagle, but *can* get everything else. DEX all round.

* Temo 28 (no damage)
* Riglan 12 
* Eagle 14 (effective +5 -> 19, see below)
* Maireagh 5, ouch! She brings her shield up, though, which helps block some of the effect from the eagle.

Total damage 51, for Riglan and Maireagh. She *just* loses her Aura spell, and Riglan has to use his cloak to keep the eagles around. Then it tries to bite Nethza! It *just* misses (20 vs AC 21).

The eagles act. Eagle A is hurt but still up and is just within 80ft. It flies right at the dragon front-on and attacks. Both miss, badly. Eagle B can *just* make it and does the same. Its beak misses too; talons hit, but only 7 damage (2d6+3, 1 and 3 rolled).

The dragon phases - on top of Maireagh this time, it's new favourite trick. Maireagh takes 6 necrotic damage. Riglan uses his lightning wand; it dodges the worst but it was a good hit all the same, so it takes 30->15 damage. Seeing this, Nethza shouts, "It's working! Temo, it's up to you!" - Temo surmises that it must be getting low. The dragon at this point uses its Legendary Action to claw-attack Maireagh; Temo tries Silvery Barbs again; it doesn't stop a hit, but he throws the spell's advantage effect to Nethza. 10 damage.

Temo (perception 17) trying to figure out if another of his heavy hits would take down the dragon... It's not hurt enough for Nethza to take it low enough, but if *he* hits it then her hit might kill it! He drops the sling onto the carpet, draws his crossbow, and aims and fires with *that*. And of course he gets a *very* good hit, wouldn't you know it - would be 38 - but he knows this weapon doesn't hurt the dragon so bad. Indeed, it discorporeates somewhat so the bolt doesn't fully hit. 19 damage. It turns and snarls at Temo - apparently unaware of our intent, still.

Nethza flies in and attacks with Silvery Barbs advantage, aiming to banish! She pulls up her shadow sword, sheathed this time in strange, crackling and pulsating planar energy. The blade itself looks more like a rift. And - oh dear. Crit. 10d10 - it's all going horribly wrong in the last few seconds. Riglan sees it - a perfect strike - disaster! - and reacts by reaching into his pouch and throwing the No. 2 marble. NOT how he ever intended to us it. Impossibly, Nethza's strike misses completely! Nethza goes in for a second attack; misses the crit now. Phew! Deals 12 main damage, 26 force damage, 5 for the hex. 43 damage.

The dragon has (for real) **one hit point** left.

The creature crumples and is *sucked* into her sword. "Oh! I have to hold this for a minute!"

The dragon eventually is banished. The cloud, however, is still there - Temo hopes that the portal might be gone - but then there's a strange crackling and energy starts to build. Temo shouts, "FLEE!" - and we turn and fly at full pace away. The portal of the sword closes and the cloud, in an extremely loud crack of thunder, *explodes*. Strange wisps of shadow fall and dissipate.

There's a blood-curdling scream, that seems to come from a long, long way away; then a cacophony, as hundreds of birds alight and flee the forest in fear.

Riglan says, "Maireagh - get on an eagle; we'll get the dog, fly back best speed to the town - Nethza, if your fly wears out, you can use the other eagle...".

It takes less than an hour. Along the way, Temo receives a message. 

"**You fuck with my toys? You will pay tenfold. I will destroy EVERYTHING you hold dear and turn them all against you. You have crossed the wrong king.**"

Temo doesn't answer, but once he can speak freely, he shouts over - "Well, he just sent me a message and he really is *very* angry. Very angry indeed."

"That must mean what we did was very good!" says Maireagh.

### Roughly 3pm

Wagons are already starting to move out of town. We catch up with Brady. The town saw the cloud, screaming, a dragon, all of it... We explain what we did.

The council of Millers, Bakers and Inn Keepers thank us - we bought them time in an unexpected way. "When this is all over - when we've returned and rebuilt - you will always have a warm hearth and a bed." They promise to have beds large enough!

We say we'll stay with the town and patrol, in case of advance parties sent ahead of the army. We'll wait until they're all away before departing.

Brady gives Temo a small windmill pin. Temo says, "Thank you, but this belongs to Nethza" - and hands it to her - "as it was she who dealt the final blow and banished the creature". He answers, "Well, it is for all of you! But I only have the one to give."

We do get told, though, of another town further North. Yulash. It's on our map. We thought it was part of the "bad guys" kingdom. It's on the way to Zhentil Keep, so in danger - and Brady says they're headed there! We need to talk them out of that... Temo, sending, Ilsevele. "Hillsfar evacuated, dragon banished. Evacuees considering going to Yulash, but we think, forest if safe. Would elves accept?" The answer: "If they head to the forest West of Yulash, *that* would be alright. And thank you! We are ready to march."

We let Brady know the plan. They'll be safe in that part of the forest, but don't go in any sooner.

The Cormyrean army is headed to Yulash too, we realise. If Cormyr gets there first, it could force Azalin to avoid it. Early confrontation. So, Temo, *last* Sending to Sir Isteval. "Dragon banished. Army moving faster than expected. Believe headed to Yulash, but would avoid if you got there first". Reply, "We are two days away from Yulash. We will head them off."

Riglan perks up. "You know what this means? We must be doing something - unusual. Unlikely. Something unexpected. Because the Oracle figured around 4 weeks from landfall to Zhentil. Azalin is way ahead of that, mostly because of our interference. We're forcing his hand."

Nethza nods. "He didn't go to Sembia at all, and then rushed through the forest because he couldn't raise any dead. And now he's probably rushing to try and get to us."

### 5pm

The town is evacuated. We decide to wait and see if we can spot Azalin's emergence.

### 8pm

We keep on patrol until nightfall. We figure Azalin is probably really close by now. Riglan calls a Familiar owl, and asks it to keep an eye on the forest edge where we think Azalin will emerge and tell him if anything comes out there.

### 10:30pm

We're considering possibly sleeping, but the owl returns. Movement at the very edge of its vision, in the scrub beyond the farms. 4 miles maybe. He keeps the fey creature circling out, reporting as often as it can on its flight back and forth. Riglan keeps nervously checking to make sure the big tree he found in town is still there! There's a watchtower which someone a mounted spyglass which was used to watch the dragon before; we use this too finally, by moonlight, see the army moving.

It's definitely not regimented! A swarm, more or less. Azalin's plinth is not visible. Instead, we think he's riding on an undead horse in the middle; the staff gives him away - the strange green glow is easier to see at night, and makes him stand out from other horse-riding generals. There must be a strange obsidian plinth in the forest somewhere! That'll need careful disposal, most likely. There's some kind of undead cavalry, riding undead animals that must have been killed along the way.

They're certainly not changing course to go directly to Yulash (which our map implies might've been the case if its positions are accurate). They head towards us.

A distant fire. One of the farmhouses. And another. They're maybe 2.5 miles away. Riglan says we should get ready to move soon - that meter storm covered around a square mile! - but we keep watching just a little longer; nothing changes. More fires. At the farmland proper, the "cavalry" spreads out, swarming wide around the land but the central body including Azalin heads straight for the town.

They to within a mile. Azalin raises his staff. Heavens start to glow. "We've seen this before!" says Riglan and we rush down the tower to the tree. He tells everyone to get ready; hastily casts Travel With Plants to just outside Myth Drannor. Riglan sees streaks of fire rain down through the closed portal. If any of the evacuees look behind their direction of travel, they will surely know that all is lost...

...and we are back in the woods. We make our now-familiar way back to Myth Drannor. We arrive to find the elves arraying themselves, gathered around the old courtyard of the ruins of the castle of Myth Drannor. Lanterns are raised. Fairy lights. Ilsevele appears, under a beam of moonlight with her consort in spirit form by her side. The other spirit knights appear; priests behind her; Elfguard on the balcony and behind.

She raises her sword. It lights with moonfire.

**"Many of you I have come to know in the last days and nights. I love you as my own. The rest of you, I have known - some for centuries, a few" (turns to her Consort) "for millennia, in many lives and many forms. Fear not! We do not go quietly! The elven nation will not fade. We were here when the first stars were born. We were here when the first flowers bloomed. We brought the spirit of the fey into this world. We brought joy and wonder. We lit imaginations and created the myths of dreams."**

**"A sleeping world needs us, one more time, to bring the fire and hold back the dark. They will never know of the sacrifices that we have endured for them, millennia after millennia. But we have created a better world - not for us, but for the children of man. Riders, elves, rangers, dreamers and artists all - we will leave this world better than we found it. I call on all of you to ride with me one last time, for the glory of the Elven Nation and the future that we promised them all."**

**"Be with your loved ones. Live as fully as you can tonight. Create the memories that will take us all to the stars, such that we may remember this beautiful world that we helped create when we are nothing but memories to those who remain. We ride at dawn."**

All the elves raise lanterns, swords and more, in unison. A sight to behold; their armour, mithril, antique gold decorations; plumes, stags decorated too. Majestic war paint. Those too old to fight or too young, stay behind to guard Myth Drannor to guard against incursions of the demons. Everyone else will ride North.

We will sleep, to get up at dawn and leave with them. Before that, Riglan excuses himself from the party and goes to find Ilsevele. She's there with her spirit form husband, Fflar Melruth. Riglan says, "Before tomorrow, I have to ask. What *is* this pendant?" "It is a tear of Silune that I brought with me from Evermeet. Why do you ask?" "Just curious, about its origin and meaning." "I carried it with me when I came back." Riglan says, "Well, thank you; it certainly opens doors with elves!" "Well, only someone who has been to Evermeet could possibly have one. If you ever get a chance to - I don't know how you ever will - but Evermeet really is a paradise. The closest thing to heaven."

Riglan looks to Fflar and says, "Spirit or not, you're a very lucky man!" "I'm not sure would say that if you knew what we'd been through but yes..." Riglan laughs and says "Yes, but *that* apart..." "Yes, this is a love for the ages. We've spent centuries together and centuries apart". Riglan nods and says, "It's easy to see how you would care for her. It's rather hard not to!" "She is one of the most remarkable beings to have ever walked this plane. I devoted two lifetimes to her!"

Riglan leaves them in peace, returning to the party. Nethza is waiting. "Here. You find a good way to use the other one... You're wiser than me, I would never have thought to use it that way" - and hands him the No.19 marble.

We sleep.



## Day 58
### Just before dawn

We wake because of the increased activity around. People are saying goodbyes, gathering to move out; numerous animals have shown up. Stags, elks, harts and more, being decorated with barding. We quickly pack up and join the throng.

Ilsevele bids farewell to Fflar; he can't leave Myth Drannor and is about to vanish. Moments later the first rays of sun through the trees, low; he disappears.

People start following each other out. Ilsevele leads, riding a large white hart, swept back antlers. It's not a regimented march - there isn't room in a forest. We join in, with the many who are on foot. Some rangers travel through the trees. We learn that the army cannot take fey paths; they can't travel with animals there, partly just because some of the paths are too small. We ask someone nearby if they know how long until we reach the edge of the forest. They say sunset! That's a surprise; Riglan thought it was much further - but the elves do move very quickly through the forest - and then Riglan spots some druids using magic to help open paths, too. We also realise that this means a *very* long day of walking, with few rests. They expect to cover more than 40 miles!

Riglan, casting Bless on himself as he wants to make a good impression (!) - survival 10+4+3. He can keep up, and notices we're close to Tel'Quessir land. Acrobatics or athl all round for the march!

* Temo 20
* Riglan 16 (with bless)
* Nethza 18
* Maireagh 24
* Dog 11 - it struggles in the undergrowth and sinks somewhat in softer earth. Maireagh just picks him up after a while!

We manage to keep up, at least for now!

### 4pm

The Tel'Quessir cross paths with the army, some distance behind the Coronal but she realises it's happening and rides back. Initially there is tension. Riglan is too far to hear what is said, but the Tel'Quessir eventually motion back into the trees - and (what we later learn is) some 500 of their kind appear all along this part of the forest. **They've come to join us!**

* **This is way more than the 300 estimated, bringing the elven army's size to around 1,100 (excluding beasts).**

They're dressed very differently. No metal. Leather and hides, more natural grown fibres overall. They feel like they're druids, every one of them, to Riglan. Some have large, functional greatbows; many more have slings. Some have staffs or halberds. It's strange; they're very xenophobic and wary, yet Riglan feels somehow more at home with them. Passage through their land is permitted - and surprisingly, that even includes the five of us.

This speeds our exit. We don't need to track West and back East; now we can just head directly North.

### 5pm

We're getting tired. CON saves:

* Temo Nat 20+2 -> 22
* Riglan 18+3 -> 21
* Nethza is flagging but in a flash of genius, Maireagh suggests helping put some heavier items in the bag of holding for a while 
* Maireagh 15

### 6pm

We reach the edge of the forest. It's been a LONG walk. CON saves again:

* Temo 17
* Riglan 12 - and this time Maireagh gets *him* to put stuff in the bag of holding
* Nethza is OK
* Maireagh is fine (19)

Amazingly, we're still OK (turns out, DC was 16).

Ilsevele in the distance - we're quite a way back now - raises a hand and sword. We hear her call out, "We have reached the edge of the forest. We will set up camp here and meditate tonight. We will move onto the fields in the morning."

We go old-school this time, and actually pitch our tent to fit in with everyone else. No tiny hut!

The elves set up watch. Ilsevele explains that she doesn't want the group out in the open; so Maireagh says she can help! She brings up another Private Sanctum, but makes it 100ft along each side, and about 30ft high, which helps cover some of the trees too. It's very useful to help hide a lot of the beasts, with some of the army camping back in the forest and even some of the rangers and Tel'Quessir who choose to meditate in trees are hidden by the tall walls.

It's interesting seeing the groups of elves mixing. Ilsevele "does the rounds" (with bodyguards).

We settle down in own camp. Maireagh makes tea. Riglan pulls something out of the chest of preserving - rations for all of us, from back when we returned to Sungift. Nethza makes a stew, adding herbs.

As we eat, one of the Tel'Quessir come over to enquire what we're eating. We share. He says, "Good to see you again! In fact it is your actions that have led us - *some* of us - into getting involved. We cannot always hide in our corner of the forest." We chat a while. It turns out that they saw us the night we came; they were curious - why we were there. What we wanted. Why we'd risk trespassing into the Tangled Trees. "Then we realised, that you were there to help. We saw the portals that you discovered. Shortly after, the portals started to close and collapse over the coming days - we knew that in fact, it was outsiders - *you* - who had managed to awaken our brothers and sisters from their long decline. When we saw them riding out, with pride - remembering what it means to be the First Children - we knew it was time to reunite."

Riglan nods. "I'm glad you're here. More than you know! A very difficult task lies ahead of us. But the more we have, the better our chances".

They've heard tales from fleeing animals. The unrelenting undead. Mindless and lost. The foul creatures of the Fell.

Some of the Tel'Quessir think their part is done now, because Azalin has left the forest. But those here, believe that he means to threaten all living things in every forest. We certainly agree!

They offer to watch while we sleep. We gladly accept.

Camp animals wander close to our tent. Riglan chats to a few. Stags explain why they're there; Ilsevele and the elves have told them that they can fight back. Push back and avenge the fallen; defend the forest and protectors of that forest. They have been told about the alliance that lives in their instincts and genetic memories; the elves are their ancient allies. One of them sniffs. "Do I smell berries?" - the standard rations. Riglan ends up sharing lots. Harts arrive - risk of being mobbed! Eventually Maireagh shoes them away ("The matriarch of your pack has established her dominance! We need to sleep now. See you in the morning").

Riglan finds the box of chocolates while he's in the bag! Goodness. He suggests we save them for victory (and if there is none, we won't care). Temo - WIS save 3, luckily then remembers he's not that person anymore! - 19+6->25. He agrees - after initially a sharp intake of breath and wide eyes!

Eventually we bed down.

Riglan: WIS save. 21.

In Riglan's dream, he feels as if he's wrapped in a bubble of air but it's like a warm blanket, of air. He walks in the Shadowfell. Odd! He sees Shadowfell creatures from Azalin's army; wispy, ethereal, indistinct form. He sees generals wandering around. Werewolves, vampires, skulking, oblivious to his presence. He follows some for a while. They come up against a wall, around 30ft high, made of dense, grey fog. It's about 100ft wide. They look at it, walk around it, to the edges; but then see it just angles around 90 degrees. Another 100ft.

Riglan realises with shock that it's Maireagh's sanctum!

They seem to ignore it, flitting, phasing into shadow and mist sometimes, other times walking. Riglan thinks he must be in some kind of dream or nightmare world. ***Actually* Dreamwalking.** Insight 18; this is how Azalin has been communicating - through dreams, nightmares, infecting and controlling agents, perhaps even creating them. Corrupting them over a long period of time through their dreams. Riglan thinks Azalin must be very comfortable in this realm - his agents prowl confidently, as if very familiar with what is going on around. They act as if in charge; fearless; the behaviour of a predator. He recognises *that* easily enough.

Many strange creatures flit around, all being able to ignore - or not see - the things within the sanctum.

Riglan wakes up. He hears some of the elves whispering to each other. One shushes another. Then one drops down to our tent area and puts a finger over his mouth - for silence - then the same to us. Wakes us all up. "Quiet! Quiet! Come." - points to our weapons. So as quietly as we can we arm ourselves. Elves are all on alert, we see.

Shadows and mists materialise in the fields ahead of us, out in the open. Sniffing the air. Searching. They jump up into the air, sometimes, turning into flitting shadows again; bat-like, but not formed so clearly.

Azalin's forces search the countryside at night!

The elves are nervous, very tense, waiting silently just inside the barrier in case of discovery. Some 15 minutes passes before eventually it looks like we're not discovered - these strange creatures have moved on. We return to our camp to continue resting.



## Day 59
### Sunrise

Riglan's first thought on waking is - "We need to warn the Cormireans about those scouts." Message? Teleport? How do we get back? Do we even do so?

Riglan seeks Ilsevele to discuss the wraiths, or whatever they were. Do they have mages who can cast something similar, to keep themselves hidden? They do not. We think Yulash to our North is directly on Azalin's path. We believe it'd normally take around 3 days on the road from Hillsfar; that means Azalin might cover it in a day and a half. Azalin might keep more North and not 'overshoot' Zhentil to the West to pick up people at Yulash but if he *is*, he's probably almost there. Indeed, he's probably not more than half a day to a day away from Zhentil itself.

There's too much uncertainty. The elves had considered this to be in essence a siege of Zhentil Keep, but Azalin isn't there *yet* and they're going to wait in the trees. We'll teleport to the Cormyrean army, find out how they are doing, give them the new info, and then Message the elves. The last thing we heard was they'd head to Yulash to "head off" Azalin's army, and were at that point about 2 days (of daylight marching) away which **by our reckoning puts Cormyr into Yulash some time today.**

**The elves could get there, but even travelling fast are maybe two days away.**

The elves decide to wait in hiding in the trees, but they'll travel through the night. They don't need to sleep; they can meditate during the day. They feel this is safer - being on the move - if the wraiths come along. **They're buying us time to find out what's going on** but once they start moving, they'll move towards Zhentil.

One point clearly noted - the two armies are not merging. They are independently run.

We say our goodbyes and Riglan says, "So, Nethza... Whenever you like!"

We move into the open grasslands; the elves stay put for now, as Maireagh's spell is still up (we have to get clear) - it's still early in the morning. Nethza finds a good spot to draw out the runes, which takes a minute; she asks a scout she trusts to brush the ground once we're gone.

The spell completes. A circle opens. We step in...

...this is new. The sides of the circle raise up in a mist, but then the mist collapses into the inside of the circle and flows out like a fog. As the fog collapses and we can see, we find ourselves in a tent. A war mage is there, looking - of course - surprised! He greets us. "I was told you might you show up!" - leadership are in Breakfast Briefing. Same tent as before - we know the way. We head there - past the entertainment tent again, to the more humble-looking but guarded canvas entry. Around us, breakfasts are being finished and the camp is packing up.

Fortunately the guards remember us! Riglan, perception 25. He can see that this camp is mostly out in the open. A field. A few trees around - if this was crops, it isn't anymore! He can see a road not far away - they're marching on the road. We rush inside.

There's much discussion. A map has been wheeled in. We bring them up to date as best we can. It's about 7am; they expect to force-march - leaving they hope at 8am - to reach Yulash by around 4pm, while there is still light. They hope to shore up the town's existing defences and engage Azalin's army *if* it does attack.

We bring up the issue of Azalin's 'fire from the sky'. The war mages question us for a while about it, now that we've seen it twice; they get a good enough description to identify it as something they call "Meteor Storm". If someone was within 60ft of Azalin with line-of-sight they could potentially prevent the spell from being cast - but obviously, that's unlikely. So, defences; a handful of key generals and some of the top mages could be protected with certain magic, but realistically, **no more than 9 key people**! The best they can do is send a question to Cormyr to see if there are defensive strategies. We have to leave that in their hands.

Outside, we consider options.

Riglan's staff (via D20 roll -> 18) wakes up and the Shepherds guide him a little. He's confused. The spirits tell him to a degree what he already knows - if Cormyr reaches Yulash in a day, then - should Azalin be headed there too - **Azalin will be arriving more or less the same time, if not earlier and even if the elves leave right now they won't get there in time.** The elves cannot play a part in a battle at Yulash should one happen. Yet on the other hand, if Azalin heads directly to Zhentil, then the elves will march that way tonight and reach it first - alone and without Cormyr's support. He might need to tell them to wait. He just doesn't know yet.

We take time to observe the mobilisation as the army starts to pack. It seems quite decentralised. No one person coordinates everyone everywhere. There seem to be varying sizes of units of people, kinda Russian dolls style - small units, some of which group then into larger units and so-on. A cascade of command structure, without waiting for someone at the top to give a command. **This is very useful given Azalin's tactics of taking out generals to disrupt the army function.** They're just really well trained. Each person individually, every one of them, seems to have a very clear idea of what their role is. Nobody seems to stand around and wait to be told what to do, or get told off for doing the wrong thing.

Riglan's primary concern he realises is to determine *where* Azalin's army is... But if it *is* going to Yulash, it might well beat Cormyr. If it does - then this army is walking into a battle. **And if so we want to be there to help**. If when we get to Yulash there's no sign, *then* the party will Wind Walk to search - we may need to stop the elves marching out at nightfall.

Just before 8am the army is already on the move. The general - the person who seems to be truly in charge, an older Purple Dragon Knight, rides along the front and side of the camp, "rallying the troops".

"We march to Yulash. The town is lightly defended. They are possibly in the direct line of fire from the enemy - the enemy we have marched for so long now to confront. We have journied through Cormyr, and by the grace of our ancient allies of Cormanthor, through their hallowed forests. We have marched across the plains of our independent cities, where our forefathers one ploughed fields and plied their trades. We head closer every day to the citadel that lies at the heart of the enemy's defence. They march there, too. We most protect those who are unable to protect themselves, for this is what Cormyr has always done and will always do. *Onward, soldiers!*" and there is a rousing cheer.

### 8:30am

We end up somewhere about 1/3 back from the head of the army. A small group breaks off from near the front and we soon recognise Sir Isteval's mount. They end up marching alongside us, just off the road. The mages are bringing up the rear, just ahead of carts and wagons. Finally, there's a rear guard unit behind that.

Sir Isteval asks if Temo wants to ride with him - since he's a lot shorter than those around. Temo is quite grateful for that - he's not accustomed to such an overwhelmingly busy situation of close-packed tall people. He's hoisted up by Sir Isteval onto the horse.

It's very hard to get a sense of whereabouts in the middle of this army, marching. At one point a call seems to be passed back through ranks; "Halt into the side". People step off the road and it transpires that the whole army is parted to allow people coming the other way on the road! It must be quite awkward for them.

It's less hard to see the damage. The sheer number of people, even 1/3 back from the front, leaves a very clear imprint on the land around the road. There's even a dust cloud formed. This would be very easy to find.

### 2pm

There's a town built on a bluff that can be seen up ahead. Yulash. A rider comes down along the side of the army, calling for Sir Isteval. His horse steps out and starts to move to the front - since Temo is on the horse, the rest of us jog to keep up and end up in a conversation where it's being decided that a vanguard group will gallop ahead, including us and war mage Aberness, into the town to assess the leadership situation there and try to allay fears of invasion and so-on. The army must be clearly visible to them by now!

We need horses maybe. Then Maireagh pulls out the carpet - but we quickly realise it has been 7 days. It's just a carpet!

Temo can ride on the dog. Maireagh can ridge on Riglan if he turns into a riding horse - but she politely requests a pony, closer to the ground! Nethza is quite light and can ride with Isteval; we'll take some of her kit on the Riglan horse. Riglan wildshapes into a facsimile of Slasher, everyone takes their place and off we go, at a gallop!

It takes about an hour, which is all we have the stamina for anyway. There are some fields and estates around the town, but also quite a few warehouses. Various gates on the road step upwards, increasingly sturdy with the keep above on the bluff. Some farmhouses and trading infrastructure are scattered around beyond the other side too - a lot of roads meet here.

This is quite a large town. It's no Hillsfar! It might not be quite as big as, say, Yartar, but certainly bigger than Deepgarden Keep. Probably around 1,000 people - nothing that can be evacuated within a few hours, for sure. There is at least some defensive infrastructure; guard towers, stone walls in many places, gates and the keep itself.

As we get to the outer gates, guards are already there - on alert. But people on the road get out of our way, looking scared and watching us closely. We screech to a halt (in horse terms) at the gates as the guards stand in the way. "Greetings Sir Knight - Sir Knights? - We can't help but notice you riding from the approaching army?! Are you - are you looking for the Town Elders? Do you wish to pass? We don't have lodging for a whole army!" Another person to the side says, "Please - please don't destroy our fields..."

Temo does his best to allay fears and confirm that we do wish to see the Elders. We are invited in - but "this is an unarmed town" - which we realise this means 'no open carry'. Temo politely asks all the knights etc. to stow weapons.

We're let through and directed to the keep, so we head straight there. We hear calls being sent ahead of us - lots of yelling from watchtowers! - nobody is surprised to see us. At the gate, someone is there to take the horses; but Riglan has no reigns, unlike Isteval's horse. Maireagh dismounts and Riglan scares the attendant by abruptly changing back into a Firbolg.

In the courtyard, the horses are led to some stables. The rest of us head into the keep. It looks like it used to be some kind of feudal keep, but the interior has been changed; no indication of royal families or similar 'gentry' insignia. Instead, it has a feel of a public space, a defendable keep and a seat of government.

We are taken to a room where a group of people - presumed council - are sat around a large rectangular table.

"Welcome to Yulash, Sir Knights and..." (to us) "...honoured guests? What brings you here?"

Temo tries to explain as they're looking at him and one person even mistakes him as being from Hillsfar - the fires were seen and they feared all killed, since no refugees have been found (we try to explain that the Cormanthor elves are helping out there, but it just causes more confusion).

Some disagree. They want proof that *we* are not the aggressor force.

Sir Isteval steps in; Temo has assured them that we'd leave if they insists and Isteval insists that we would if staying *only* work *with* their existing defences. Also Isteval and the War Mage, helping with illusions, go right into details about the arriving Lich King and raising the undead, which Temo had dodged for fear of freaking people out. Temo, adv. persuasion 29; the council is *almost* unanimous, just one dissenter. They relent and tell us where we can set up; East of the town. The war mages ask if they can station in the keep itself for a better vantage point and that's agreed too.

We go up to check a tower that they can use for a vantage point. Riglan notices a spyglass! He casts Bless on himself and has a look. Sir Isteval stays but some others then head out to ride back to the army. Before they go, Temo implores them to keep the width of the army column down as best they can! Less damage. They are even given permission to travel *through* the town, damaging far fewer fields that way, in the West gate and out the East.

There are still the protestations of one person. He's fairly incredulous that they'd allow an army to march openly through Yulash... He thinks that we're fooling them and that we're the bad guys. Riglan ends up trying to convince this dude that we're the good guys - "because I can't say much else if you think that we're the bad guys and *this* is the good guy" - and uses Disguise Self to turn into Azalin Rex. Perception 16; this guy doesn't seem surprised! Insight is only 11 so he's not sure what that means, so instead tries Detect Magic, suspecting the worst. He detects a faint aura of divination magic coming from an object in this guy's coat pocket - outside coat pocket. Riglan drops his spell. He leaves the guy, who shouts after him "Your magic tricks do not sway me" and finds Temo. "We've got trouble. That annoying councillor? You need to pick his pocket" - and describes the one to pick.

Nethza will go to the councillor under guise of trying to resume the conversation. Riglan gives Temo the Boots Of Elvenkind for quiet footfall on the floor and Nethza makes him invisible. Nethza gets into her conversation. Temo creeps up to the councillor in debate with Nethza. Adv stealth 34! Even higher... Sleight of hand - 35!

He finds, without being detected *at all*, just one item in the pocket other than a folded sheet of paper. It's a very thin chain with a small orb attached to it. A pendant of some kind. He sneaks away.

Temo shows Maireagh and Riglan once he's got clear. It's a small kind of eye pendant on a chain. Maireagh arcana 23. This is a conduit... Press it to your forehead and it lets you project yourself or have someone project their image and presence into your vicinity to have a conversation.

We have to risk it - Riglan tries it out. If *not* Azalin Rex then we look as crooked as the councillor suggests, but if it *is* Azalin - this could be rough. He pushes it to his forehead. WIS 19. Riglan finds he has some control over the object, which is itself quite benign. Not evil. Nonetheless, a jolt; a sense of disorientation; stealth with spellcasting modifier - lucky roll, 16+5->21. He has enough control to stealthily project himself and see where he "is" (through the item). Perception 27. Some good rolls. There's a swaying or a jolting; things obscure his vision now and then... Oh! He's hanging from a chain, off a belt with other pouches, chains, orbs, medallions, even some teeth on necklaces, talismans. Near the hip, by the looks of things. The tops of shambling heads. He can't direct his vision so it's hard to get a clear look, but there are strips of cloth that flit back and forth getting in the way, but he's on some kind of throne. No obsidian slab; but that was abandoned - ogres carrying a throne. As soon as Riglan realises this *is Azalin Rex!* he is just about to drop the connection for fear of being caught; survival quick roll, with bless, 19; he's in fields, the sun appears to be directly in front.

Riglan drops the connection.

Huh. Fields. Headed directly West. Not on a road, at least not that he saw.

So the missing thing. They're coming this way, but that's a change of direction. Why are they coming here? We need to know what this councillor has been saying.

Temo is visible again. Riglan fills them in. We head to join Nethza and Temo tries to drop hints - maybe there's something she can do to help him speak truthfully? Meanwhile, Maireagh casts Enhance Ability on Temo - Eagle's Splendour. Nethza isn't getting anywhere when Temo theatrically sighs. "Look" he says, "This guy knows. He obviously knows! You're right. Nothing can stop Azalin. You know that. I know that. So, you must have what we have - a way of talking. What's he been saying?" - and at this very strange conversation, Nethza tries to discern what Temo is doing - insight roll high enough, figures out it's a bluff! - so decides to help by casting Charm Monster. He *just* fails and is charmed; that helps lower the DC15 to meet a rather dodgy (despite advantage) Deception roll of 17.

Temo pretends to be delighted to have actually "found someone else on our side". We never normally know what people are saying. The guy says we need to get out of town - he lists off grievances; many people he doesn't like here, councillors who serve weak and poor instead of rising; "The king has shown me that I'm destined for so much more and he will make it happen! All I need to do is get out of his way. He can have the town - he requires recruits! As long as I'm out of the way, it will not be on my conscience what methods of coercion he uses to get the conscripts that he needs. But I have been assured I will return to the town and he has promised that I will encounter no resistance to my policies if I do this for him."

Temo's blood runs cold. This man *invited Azalin Rex here*. This close to our worst-case scenario.

We leave the councillor for a moment - charmed for an hour - and figure we might try a high-risk bet. Return the pendant, let the councillor tell Azalin that this army is here now. Elves not far behind. No more dragon - perhaps Azalin would turn away, figuring it not as important as reaching the dead at Zhentil Keep and raising them sooner.

So we need to give him the pendant back after all! Nethza repeats her spell and Temo tries to creep up (adv stealth 33), then put the pendant back (SOH 27). Drops it in. Then sneaks back. *Then* we all return to the councillor. And we says, "Bad news. We think you should tell Azalin about the big army - we don't know if he's aware." "Do you think the army is a threat to him?" "Well, we think it's ten thousand at least from our spies within the ranks, and we were marching with them and counted not far off that much. It might chance the balance for him, and think about it, if you saved him all that trouble, the reward might be even greater than you expected..." - adv deception 17 again, DC still 15.

The councillor is fooled. He rushes into a side room. Riglan calls a spider and sends it under the door to listen in. To his surprise, he can see a projection of Azalin - so each side sees the other, somehow, as an illusion present in their physical space. "King. I have come across important information for you my king, my king! I feel you must know that a Cormyrean army of at least 10,000 have now entered town - they are marching through our streets as we speak! It is like we are being invaded. Is it wise for you to try and convert the townsfolk to your cause if there is to be a battle?"

A gravelly, cracked voice, "A Cormyrean army? You did not manage to stop this Cormyrean from marching through the town you promised me? Fool! Forget Yulash. I will banish it from my mind. You are useless to me. Your town, useless to me!" - and then there's a horrible pained choking noise; the councillor is wracked with pain, dropping the pendant but to no avail as a necrotic mist fills the room; the eye in the pendant shrivels. Riglan bursts into the room; medicine 15; his body has turned into a husk, as if life-draining magic was used. Revivify won't work. There's nothing left to bring back. Grim.

And just as we learn that magic can be cast through the eye, the eye is destroyed.

"We *have* to tell the other councillors what happened" says Nethza. Meanwhile the guy, though a traitor, is dead; we'd rather there was a lot less of that. "It's not a win." says Riglan. "It's just less of a loss. And maybe that's the best we can hope for now, as the days draw nearer" answers Maireagh. Nethza says, "It's a pity that Azalin killed him. But the alternative could have been countless dead in the Cormyrean army and in the town. It's not right that we are making these calculations, but they still count for something."

First, then, the councillors. They're horrified; clearly not a natural death; but this is not a good look. Persuasion adv., even then by RT, only 25 but in the context of this council that's enough. He manages to plead a good case and divert their attentions to the sacrifice and how they must make good on this. The army must be ready to defend in case Azalin decides, despite what we heard, to attack anyway. He might well send scouts to verify the information so we want to make sure they see what they should see.

We share the information with the War Mage too. He comes with a plan and takes us up to the tower. "Let's see if we can spot where they might be coming from." We know where to look with the spyglass - directly East. Riglan, perception 19. He thinks he sees *something* maybe 6 miles away. A mass, of some kind, dark against the green of the fields, widely spread out. Almost looks like a swarm of bugs. Can't tell movement direction.

### 4:30pm

We're all still at the watch tower; the army arrived about half an hour ago and has been moving through the city and taking up positions. It takes a long time for that many people to go through. Every now and again he checks - the army seems to have stopped moving. Riglan casts Bless, checks; perception 24, most of the army is still, but a vanguard rides out.

**"He's - he's going to test our defences!" gasps Riglan.**
