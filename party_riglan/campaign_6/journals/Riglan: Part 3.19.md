# Riglan: Part 3.19
## Day 54 - Pursuit!
### Chase +9h (note, realigned to hour; previous period in part 3.18 was only 30 minutes)

It is 10am; Lesther started sleeping at 8am; Riglan starts sleeping. One hand holds his staff, the other is closed around Ilsevele's silver pendant.

Some time later, D20->3... Temo, perception 17. He notices his sling is giving a gentle warning; he looks around and notices a cloud forming over the main army, a few miles behind. He calls Nethza and Maireagh's attention to that, so they're alerted. The vanguard don't seem to be doing anything different. If anything they're falling back, not pushing or harrying. He points *that* out too - it suggests that whatever this distant cloud might be, it's got *us* in mind! It's black, thin and close to the ground, very unnatural; it also seems to be moving our way. Arcana 4+5->9, he doesn't recognise this effect.

Isteval asks if we should speed up. Temo thinks the cloud will hit us anyway, but it'd give us distance from the vanguard. However, the vanguard speed up to match. Given this, we slow down to avoid tiring the horse. The vanguard slows too. They're either conserving energy, or avoiding an area effect (or both) from this cloud. Over ten minutes it makes its way towards us. About one mile away; travelling fast. Lightning maybe? Perception nat 1, so roll again, nat 1 again! 7 total. He can't tell. As it gets closer, purple smoke wisps become visible. Flashes of purple inside. Temo thinks maybe it's hiding something inside? Maireagh decides to spend a charge of her invisibility device on Temo, and then Isteval calls out - "oh, dear. There's a *dragon in there*". Paladin sense.

Temo says, "Ah, to hell with it!" and wakes up Riglan. "Sorry, looks like we've got a dragon!"

The cloud is maybe 1000ft away; it starts billowing out and expanding. Something in the middle is controlling it; but then kind of bursts outwards, like a river bursting banks, changing into a great storm cloud stretching above us. Descending out, breaking through the lower cloud layer, is a matte-black shadowy shape that seems to be made of plates of dragon scale, ashen and charred-looking. Might have been a red or black dragon when alive, but now undead. Sickly eldritch purple flesh glows from behind the scales/armour. It's moved 160ft towards us since then. 840ft away.

Riglan shouts to ask if Isteval has any ranged attacks; "No!"; "OK, keep driving!" and calls a Gem Dragon L5 with radiant defence/offence; and he activates his staff. Initiative!

* Riglan 25
* Dragon After Riglan
* Temo 21
* Maireagh 12
* Nethza 6

The gem dragon flies directly at the aggressor. It flies 120ft towards the creature; 720ft separates them.

Temo knows the dragon is still a while out of range, so notches an arrow and focuses on the vanguard in case they try anything!

The evil dragon crackles with arcane energy, rushing at us - another 40ft almost in a blur. 680ft to Riglan's dragon, 800ft to the cart. Now it flies directly at us, wings spread out, then pulled back into a full speed dive; another 160ft. 520ft to Riglan's dragon, 640ft to the cart. Riglan whistles, "wow, the *speed* of that thing!" - and the cloud continues to billow out; Temo keeps one eye on that as well as the vanguard. There *must* be more to it... Crackling of blueish-white lightning within it, now.

Maireagh says, "I'm not sure, should we stay together or separate?" and Isteval shouts, "Stay close to me!" which Riglan echoes; "We don't know its range or intent, if we split up it could still hit us both anyway, and if it shreds the carpet you'll need to jump onto the cart" - but Maireagh points at the cloud - "I'm more worried about *that*!" and Riglan says, "Fine, you worry about the cloud, we'll worry about the dragon!" So all she can do to help is - Mareaigh adds See Invisibility to Nethza. She prepares her hammers.

Nethza activates her cloak's wings of flying and lifts off from the carpet; she turns invisible.

Isteval now urges the horse back up to its best possible speed. It manages a gallop, 60ft, which pulls us away a bit (and vanguard must work hard to keep up). It's 700ft from us now.

There's nothing much Riglan can do; he tells his gem dragon to press on; which it does. 120ft closed, now 400ft from the death dragon.

The death dragon does another strange 40ft jump - 360ft to the gem, 660ft to the cart.

Temo shouts over his shoulder, "It'll catch us anyway, speed is good but don't forget that horse needs to last 8 hours!" and now moves his aim to the approaching dragon, holding ready for attack.

The death dragon now opens its wings and tries to raise over the gem dragon, adjusting its course to account for the moving cart; 160ft covered; 500ft from the cart, angling but ends up 200ft from the gem dragon, really less to avoid that and more just to keep go directly to the cart. Its lack of concern for the gem dragon is a worry.

Maireagh - 500ft away - "It's still too far away!" Temo shouts, "Hold steady!" "I'm really worried about *this* fella..." (looking at Lesther) - she shouts the carpet to fly on ahead as fast as it can go (so we're doing 30+30 in the cart and it can do 60+60). She shouts to Nethza, "Girlie I don't know where you are but I'm sending the carpet away!", then casts Branding Smite; her Dwarven Thrower is sheathed in radiant energy.

Nethza speaks from her invisible position - "I'm going to go wide and attack from behind, I'll see you all in a bit!"

Isteval heeds Temo's words, and giving the carpet some time to pull away, slows a little. We move 30ft, so 530ft to the dragon. Riglan keeps holding; the gem dragon flies 60ft, and is now only **100ft from the death dragon**, and gets ready with its breath weapon for if the death dragon gets within 30ft.

The death dragon phases another 40ft closer, 70ft away from the gem dragon as it is aiming upwards to get over it, and is 490ft from the cart (Temo has nothing he can do - just keeps aiming); then it flies 80ft - that takes above the gem dragon which releases its breath weapon. DC20 dex save; it makes it (22). 2d6->6+1->7->3; and that's all it takes. It doesn't seem vulnerable to radiant. Riglan swears, and shouts, "NOT vulnerable to Radiant! I chose the wrong toy!" It heads another 80ft towards the cart. 330ft away from the cart, pulled 90ft away from the gem dragon on the other side.

Maireagh is looks fearsome - stood on the cart braced, sheathed in the branding smite energy.

Isteval keeps us going, but then a lightning bolt some smashing down on the road and the carts swerves to avoid; the radius of the effect blasts us with heat, too. Dex saves - Aura +5, DC20:

* Temo 26 (no damage)
* Riglan 16 - gets hit
* Isteval gets hit
* Dog gets hit
* Maireagh uses Flash Of Genius to help the horse (which otherwise would've been hit)
* Nethza is nowhere near, Lesther also well out of the way

...this is going to be ugly. 5d10->31, or 15 for the horse. Riglan con save 10, holds the spell. Maireagh holds her smite too.

With the swerving, we only cover 20ft. 350ft away from the death dragon.

Riglan shouts at the gem dragon to do its best to press an attack and decides against wildshaping in favour of attempting a lightning bolt if the dragon gets close enough, though he suspects resistance or immunity. His dragon in due course flies 60ft to get *just* into 30ft range of the death dragon - can't rend, but uses its breath weapon, best it can do. This time it gets a good hit; 2d6->4+4->8 radiant damage. Shame it's not doubled, but at least it's damage!

The death dragon phases 40ft away again. 70ft from the gem dragon, 310ft from us. It's still much too far for Temo, who holds his aim, in case it gets within range. The death dragon moves 80, 150ft-gem/230ft-cart away; and this is apparently within range of something. We feel a wave of fear pass over us - but thanks to heroes feast, we're mostly OK. The spirit horse however - well that's another story... ...but it just holds its nerve! Isteval's aura is once again invaluable. The dragon continues its dash towards; 230ft from the gem dragon, 150ft away from us.

Maireagh is still holding her spell, frustrated at the range issues. It's been almost half a minute of just *waiting*. Nethza suddenly appears, visible (she's hexed the dragon with Hexblade's Curse) and throws out three eldritch blasts. Two hit, d10+10 with hex. Max 10, then min 1! 31 damage total.

Isteval pushes us onwards, 30ft. 180ft to the dragon.

Riglan can't do anything, except prepare his lightning wand (lowest charge to start with) in case the death dragon gets to 100ft or closer. The gem dragon at full speed can't catch up; it moves 120ft, ending up 110ft from the death dragon and 290ft away from the cart.

And *again* the death dragon phases 40ft closer. 140ft from the cart, 150ft from the gem dragon.

Temo is still holding.

The dragon flies 80ft towards the cart, triggering both Riglan and Temo as it closes to 60ft by the end of its run. Riglan - tries the lightning wand; the dragon dodges; damage roll 8d6 is awful, only 23, but at least the dragon seems to be hit partially - 11 damage. "Lightning works!" he shouts. Temo meanwhile fires, gets a good hit for 39 with sneak, but the damage doesn't seem as affected as expected (19 damage taken - resistant to piercing). Temo shouts, "Arrows don't!"

At 60ft, the dragon opens its mouth and all that purple energy seems to be drawn from its body and spew out in flame towards us. It hits everything except the horse and Nethza. Dex saves with +5, DC18:

* Temo 23 (zero damage)
* Riglan total 10 - miles off
* Dog OK
* Maireagh OK
* Isteval - would fail but Maireagh helps him out with Flash Of Genius

Riglan's going to take the full hit... 48 necrotic. Wow. 24 for everyone else. Riglan can't hold his spell and already used his reaction to trigger his lightning action, so his cloak can't help and the gem dragon spell fails.

Maireagh luckily *does* keep her spell up, again thanks to Isteval. She uses her winged boots to fly, gets within 20ft of the dragon and throws her hammers. A hit; 2d8+2d6+8, 25. Blows arcane jolt, 4d6->only 9, 34 total then. The second throw *just* matches AC and hits! 2d8+8->18 more. It does at least look a little injured.

The dragon now does its teleport-y thing again, ending up a terrifying 20ft away from the cart, without any opportunity attacks either. Nethza flies in to compensate and throws more eldritch blasts. Crit, hit, hit! 2d10+10->only 16, next though is 20, third is 17. The crit is the worst of the three, such is life. Bits of purple shadow are detaching from it, but for some reason it doesn't look too worried.

Isteval guns it! 60ft. 80ft from the dragon. And then - another lightning bolt! Dex saves again, DC 20.

* Temo 22 (fine, zero damage)
* Riglan fails badly (10 total)
* Dog saves
* Horse saves
* Isteval full

22 damage total, 11 for saves. Riglan wanted to use Sunbeam as he figures the dragon isn't being hit with the right kind of damage, so for now, just uses lightning again, but calls to Isteval to slow down (it's faster than us anyway). The dragon uses a legendary resistance to save, but the damage roll is implausibly low - 1,1,1,1,2,2,4,4 -> 16 only. So the dragon only takes 8 damage! Riglan is having a very, *very* bad day.

Temo aims and fires. Hits. 32 piercing, 16 taken.

The death dragon doesn't reuse its breath weapon - we see the light glow but sputtering, so it's not able to use it again; moves to within just *ten feet* of us, then reaches down to bite Temo on the back of the cart! 28 to hit - that'll do it! - Temo sees it coming and tries Silvery Barbs but it's just not enough. He takes 13 piercing, 3 necrotic, **and is grabbed and snatched off the cart** - 5ft up - then tries to rake at Temo with claws, while Temo is in the mouth; hits, of course; 14 slashing; and again; 11 damage.

The rest of us see Temo apparently being pretty much eaten and torn apart. 

Maireagh tries another Branding Smite and hits twice. 2d8+2d6+8->29, arcane jolt 4d6->16. 45 total! That's more like it. Second hit, 2d8+8->17. The dragon is smashed in the head both times; the second hit, the back of its head appears to burst open with arcane energy; Temo is dropped and starts to fall; it expands out, almost stretching as if suddenly going really quickly; arcane purple energy reaches out, some of it touching the ground. Now it gets *weird*. Rodents and other animal carcasses - skeletons, often, crawl out of the ground; but then they fall to dust. The purple energy then jumps as a bolt back towards the army and the cloud - like smoke coming out of a bottle, in reverse - disappears back to the army too.

Temo dex save, 18, does land on his feet, but on the ground not the cart. Maireagh flies down and grabs him, to carry him up onto the cart. Nethza meanwhile looks around, shouts back, "I think - I *think* that killed it, I know it did! - but something's happening - oh, the vanguard is charging!" - and then - "Oh! Lesther!" - and flies off in pursuit of the carpet to get that back under control.

On the cart Maireagh sees Riglan and Temo both injured. Riglan doesn't have enough magic for a mass heal. Maireagh offers Riglan some special tea that can help him sleep immediately. Riglan argues Temo should have it, but Temo refuses and Maireagh says it's less useful for him. Riglan agrees, but says that if anything bad happens again, they must wake him up!

Maireagh says she can do it for three of us, in fact; Nethza, Temo, Riglan. Nethza's back with the carpet under control; her and Maireagh get on there, while Riglan and Temo stay on the cart. Nethza wants to stay awake though, so only sleeps for about 10 minutes (equiv short rest; Maireagh has cast Catnap). Temo and Riglan sleep on.

In the next few minutes, we have the equivalent of a short rest. It's most useful for healing; the magic of the world helps us heal pretty quickly.

### Chase +10h

11am. Two hours into the spirit horse's run. Maireagh and Nethza are on the carpet with Lesther upon it, flying back and forth, surveilling. Isteval drives, Temo and Riglan are sleeping.

D20->3, again (at this stage, 4 or less means an encounter, sigh). At DM request, D10->10.

The wagon hits a rock, in *just* the wrong way. A wheel cracks and flies off! We are forced to stop, very abruptly. Marieagh runs for the detached wheel and starts repair. The vanguard is immediately getting very close; Nethza runs out to create a wall of light.

The jolt wakes Temo but not Riglan. He wakes to see Nethza throwing a wall of light to block the vanguard, around 300ft away; she dropped it into the middle of them too, trying to burn them. A bunch are taken out. She's flying, throwing out eldritch blasts and so-on, solo! Maireagh keeps calling up to Temo to keep still as she needs to fix the wagon; Isteval has jumped down to help; and besides, it's too far away for Temo to help.

The vanguard gets around the wall, Nethza continuing her assault. She starts using bits of the wall to send out beams of light, which shrinks the wall but that's OK since the vanguard is already spilling around it. She holds them back for more than half a minute; the seconds stretch on; the vanguard gets close; Netzha is falling back, as Maireagh tells us she's nearly done. The creatures around the wall start charging, but Nethza's hitting a few. The next thing she does is throw down a dome of darkness to try and hide her retreat; this confuses the vanguard and buys a few more seconds. Maireagh's finished - she clambers back aboard as Isteval gets the horse back up to speed. The wagon starts moving again just as the army clears the darkness at about 150ft away, with Nethza flying behind; one more Wall Of Light is thrown in front as the vanguard bursts out of the darkness and run right into it.

With a gallop, we reach our previous distance before slowing. Nethza says she thinks about 25 were taken down, so they've probably got about 35 left. It's getting to the point where we'd consider turning around and just attacking them full-on.

### +11h

Midday. Lesther's been asleep for four hours. Riglan and Temo are starting their equivalent (thanks to Catnap) second hour.

D20->6. An uneventful period. For everyone awake except Isteval, it amounts - for once - to a short rest.

### +12h

1pm. Lesther's been asleep for five hours. Riglan and Temo are starting their equivalent third hour.

D20->7. Another uneventful period! Thank goodness. What's more, the army in the distance seems to be drawing away somewhat; we hypothesise that the army is affected similarly to the vanguard, and the heat of the day is causing them trouble. Speaking of the vanguard, they've *all* moved off road and into the grass, which means we can keep a steady, slower pace.

We're on the main road. Settlements around. We hope they're empty - we certainly haven't seen anyone. Ashara's Crossing be close. After that - an hour or three off-road again, and a bit of guesswork to get us into the trees for our final escape.

### +13h

2pm. Lesther wakes up, but could do with a restful couple of hours from here. He suggests that Nethza try to sleep - she's the only one who hasn't! Everyone else awake insists - she's been awake far too long - she relents and agrees. Riglan and Temo are starting their equivalent fourth hour.

D20->13. Our luck might be turning. 

### +14h

3pm. Lesther's been quietly awake for an hour; Riglan and Temo are starting their equivalent fifth hour. Nethza starts her second hour.

D20->11. Our luck is definitely turning! 

### +15h

4pm. Lesther is fully rested and alert. Riglan and Temo are starting their equivalent sixth hour. The road heads dead North. Nethza starts her third hour of rest.

D20->20. The road is well made and we pick up speed, but we're mindful that the sun's getting low.

### +16h

5pm. Riglan and Temo wake up. Nethza starts her fourth hour of rest. Isteval estimates we're about one hour from the bridge. More settlements around.

D20->6. We start seeing the buildings of Ashasra's Crossing in the distance. The sun is getting lower. It's noticeably cooler. Temo is resting but has his eye, once again, on the vanguard. Riglan sees it and nods. "Yes, not as much fun in the dark, is it?"

### +17h

6pm. Nethza starts her fifth hour of rest. We reach the outskirts of Ashasra's Crossing. Boarded up buildings. Empty; quiet. The bridge watchtower is near now. There's a beautiful pale, beige stone church which we'd not seen close-up before. It's on a bit of a rise and surrounded by an old graveyard. Riglan points and says, "Problem! Graveyard! If the vanguard can do what Azalin can do, they might increase their numbers. We'd better try and keep an eye on that as they go past."

D20->1. Oh dear.

We reach the barred gate; DM fiat, Temo and Riglan are considered long-rested. The trouble is, it's a wooden gate but has a metal bar across it - hard to break through or burn. We're forced to stop. Isteval draws his sword, he's tired, wants someone else to take over the wagon anyway - Riglan jumps up front for that - and Isteval gets down to unbar the gate but it's locked! Temo runs around to help pick it. 26 SOH via Reliable Talent (nat 2 rolled!) - the lock comes undone. We're able to open the gate but the vanguard is closing. Riglan, animal handling 23, the horse - already jumpy as the vanguard has cut a corner to get closer to us, now only a few second away! - gets a gallop going. Riglan calls an owl to start keeping watch on them.

Via owl's eyes, perception 14, the army has made it to the water's edge of the river - 3 miles downriver! Not where we are at all. They're walking in the water and crossing. Riglan says, "Once we're across, we might need to actually angle back somewhat *East* to try and make sure we keep pulling the whole army where we want it to go - I'll keep an eye on where they go from here".

The vanguard is going through the town. Some of them are smashing into buildings, looking for people, so they fall behind. The general with the long antler-like headdress walks up to the gates of the church and, with a scythe of some kind, smashes it aside; it turns to look at us crossing the bridge; but then turns attention to the church. Some kind of incantation - and then **all dead in the cemetary are simultaneously raised**.

Riglan's owl sees the town ransacked - vanguard creatures rip through doors, boards on windows, smashing their way in and through everything, barely breaking stride, their numbers swelling rapidly as the new undead spill out of the cemetary.

Riglan breaks the bad news - if we were going to head-on attack the vanguard, it looks like we should've done it sooner. At least we're across the bridge.

The other general is has emerged onto the main road. It looks our way, levels its long great sword towards us and lets out the shriek we heard in the first few minutes, once again; but we're not scared as the feast's effects are still helping. To Riglan's shock though, the horse rears up and starts to bolt; Isteval tries to help; then tells Riglan, "I have to let him go - can you..." and Riglan says, "Yes!" - Riglan jumps down next to the horse, holds up the yoke on one side with his arm; Isteval releases the spirit; the horse bolts but also vanishes into the spirit realm all at once, and Riglan tries to swing under the yoke *and* wildshape into a Dire Wolf at the same time. Athl 23., so he manages it; the yoke drops onto him well enough, and Temo (acro 23) manages to jump down and get some of the straps secured so that he's not going to pull free of the wagon.

Riglan tries to speed up to full pace, but Temo calls down, "No, not too fast, the vanguard is falling back - they're busy with the town".

Riglan wolf, survival 17, he has a good idea of where to go. The wolf form is especially advantageous to at least sniff out a path! It's going to be difficult in the dark though.

Temo sees the change of course, remembers that he's dealing with Riglan and not an animal and tells Isteval "he knows where he's going, but we might have to help him in the dark a bit if we think there should be another path, or a better route. But we don't need to sit up front anymore." Isteval suggests that he and Temo actually jump onto the wolf's back. Nethza, Maireagh and Lesther are on the carpet; he asks about the dog and Temo confirms that it doesn't tire and can move about as fast as the horse, so why not leave the wagon behind, as it is a risk off-road? Especially in the dark? Maireagh overhears - repairing the wagon in the dark is hard, and the woods/hills aren't as easy as the plains. The wagon is certainly showing wear, despite being well made.

It's decided. The dog jumps down, Temo and Isteval make their way onto Riglan wolf, Temo undoes the buckles he just did up and Isteval hauls off the yoke. The wagon drops behind; slightly sad to see it go, but now we're on more solid footing.

Temo remembers the sending stone and sends to the speaker - "Army and vanguard now North of river. Ashara's Crossing ransacked and graveyard raised for their army, but they're out of Sembia". Response, "That is a relief! We will fortify our positions."

### +18h

7pm. Sundown. Nethza starts her sixth hour of rest. Riglan heads somewhat North-East, based on - Temo thinks - a gap between forest areas on the map, below the hills we once walked down having left Cormanthor's forest a few days ago.

D20->11. The mood is sombre due to the darkness; we can hear strange calls - hoots and screeches - the army in the distance, the vanguard behind. Some of them didn't even take the bridge and just went through the river. They've ended up back at the rough 300ft distance, but spread out now since the terrain allows (or indeed even requires it). They move faster in the dark too, so Riglan speeds up and the dog keeps pace, but Temo warns Riglan once they're about 500ft back not to go *too* fast as we don't want to lose them.

### +19h

8pm. Nethza wakes up and asks what happened to the wagon?! We explain.

Riglan wolf, survival 25. Despite the dark he's got a good idea of where we are. He thinks maybe one more hour of drawing the vanguard closer to back where the army is, and he might look for a big tree. He connects briefly to his owl and sees the vanguard a comfortable ~500ft away.

It's a clear night but no moon yet; the owl can't really see how far away the main army is, despite its darkvision. Worryingly, Riglan can see houses and settlements with lights on - there are people here! He decides we'll *definitely* keep drawing the vanguard as long as any of *that* going on. Riglan tries to keep to the darkest areas.

Lesther decides to casts a sort of glowing light on all of us. Temo asks WTF, and Lesther explains that it'll help Riglan navigate, help us fight and spot enemies, and the vanguard knows where we are; it'll also help draw the army perhaps, so that it might get closer to the vanguard before we bail. Good plan! A trail of light motes are left behind us.

Isteval infuses his sword and shield with radiant energy. The paladin might be overdoing it a bit, but hey... If it works...!

D20->15. Nothing much happens this hour. The vanguard seems to be attracted as we hoped, and the owl manages to see glints in the distance of the army - and a light extinguished, as it seems to envelop what was sadly probably a farmhouse. Only Riglan knows this, and tries not to think too hard about what they would've just suffered.

Nethza is on watch on the carpet. She's curious about the army location and flies up high; it helps make her more visible. She too sees the army, and hopes the army sees her; it does seem to be heading our way, just a darker patch against the land, somehow, despite the land being mostly dark itself. She quietly hopes Vip and Johm did continue right through to Scardale as planned.

### +20h

9pm. Nethza starts her second hour of rest after waking up. We've been getting into thicker and thicker vegetation, Riglan trying to skirt the outsides, but now he really can't seem to avoid it much. 

e gets the owl up and double-checks the location of the army and vanguard. Still no moon, but he can see the vanguard perhaps even further back now - but still in pursuit; he also - perception, nat 20+10->30 - checks on the army. The owl detaches briefly for a wide flyby. It sees the generals apparently commanding the army and using magic; a spread of poison, a cloud, is extending around them. It kills anything living, and the bigger creatures get raised. Already there are some weird-looking new additions; true horrors; limbs and body parts, fused together, not recognisable as any undead. A flesh golem! (1984 The Thing territory). Swinging back around, it can see the army and vanguard are getting close (the vanguard falling back further) - maybe only a mile away. It cuts a swathe of destruction. The obsidian slab glints now and again in a putrescent, sickly green light, as a strange web-like effect is spreading from Azalin's staff. The owl even sees that Azalin seems to have sent some forces out in odd directions at the edge of the woods; strange corpse creatures are spreading out, as if creating a wide net to carve through the trees. The owl cycles back and Riglan learns it all.

D20->5...

Temo's sling starts feeling... Off. He calls a warning. In this part of the woods, Riglan adv. perception 23; smells humanoids, *living* things. He detects little camps of people from the countryside, cowering and hiding in the woods. They freak out a bit on our approach; Isteval is horrified, "You can't be here! There's an army coming, you need to run! You cannot stay here!" "But we don't know where to go!" - but some scatter, some even heading *backwards*.

Riglan shrugs, the two get the message and dismount; he wildshapes back to himself. "I can only get a few through a tree; only a handful; I've enough left in me to do it twice. Otherwise, we might have to point them at a fey path..." - he looks around, just doesn't know what to do; sees people packing; tells Temo, "You've got to convince them to run, and stop packing!" - so Temo tries to persuade them. We're trying to convince them to go West. Temo casts Sending, to Ilsevele, "Found stray civilians directly in vanguard path, we have seconds to spare, is there *anything* you can do to show us a Fey path or other solution?" - a fast answer - "There *are* fey paths, but no way to show them to you unless you have a ranger with you..."

...Temo's sling rings a full alarm. There's a huge crash and branches above us start to snap and fold down. Part of a tree gets yanked aside. Perched there, wings outstretched, **is the shadow dragon again**.

Riglan wheels around, it's *close*, he casts L6 Sunbeam (DC 20 CON save, gets 19, but uses Legendary Resistance - so it's not blinded; 12 damage).

It uses its awful purple breath - **at all the fleeing people** - and the manner of their death will haunt Riglan to his grave. They can't breathe; they look at each other in panic, reaching out for help; unable to do anything; they collapse and then *each one* stands right back up, and turns on us. Riglan immediately just looks for a big tree. Run. *RUN*.

Nethza throws up a wall of light; Lesther starts creating illusions to try and confuse them; Temo sends magic missiles in all directions; Maireagh activates a smite on her hammer, readying a throw; Isteval takes a stance, yelling out a Word Of Purity - and some of the undead turn. It keeps a few back. The dragon starts to take flight, apparently to keep out of our range.

Riglan survival only 13, what a time for a low roll! Maireagh then points over in a direction and says, "What about that one?!" so Riglan gets 18. It'll *just about do* - he shouts, "Everyone! Run! Follow me!" - runs to the tree, and readies the spell - having to upcast to L7 - triggered when everyone is close enough to get through.

The dragon swoops around and seems to be able to use its breath weapon again - this time, at our converging group. Dex saves:

* Temo OK 
* Riglan fail
* Nethza OK
* Dog fail
* Isteval OK
* Lesther fail
* Maireagh OK - and she swings her shield over to try and protect Lesther (Shieldmaster).

55 necrotic. Maireagh, the dog and Riglan all take the full brunt, but they're still up. The shock makes Riglan release the spell; ready or not, the portal opens! He shouts, loudly, "RUN!"

More innocents are caught in this latest blast. As soon as they fall, they rise. If any of us had gone down... Well...

* Nethza / Maireagh both fly for best speed. Nethza rattles through. Maireagh helps Lesther onto his feet and drags him through (high ATHL check).
* Dog, 40, bolts.
* Isteval ATHL 19, makes it
* Temo 29, jumps and rolls into it!

Riglan is last. He looks back. Just a glance, as the portal starts to close behind him. The dragon is perched above, roaring in victory as the shambling, crazed, brand new zombies run for the tree, arms outstretched. Acro. for his exit, 9+0; he's still looking backwards and kind of tumbles out of the tree, tripping over the dog and falling flat on his back, knocking the wind out of him for a moment.

Two arrows fly over him! One hits Maireagh; another misses. Riglan quickly grabs the pendant and pulls it up and waves it at outstretched arm - shouting in Elven, "STOP, STOP!" - and hears, "Oh no! No! It's allies!" in horrified tones. Two rangers drop down and start apologising to Maireagh. Riglan gets back on his feet and puts back on the pendant. Riglan takes a breath, then says, "They're in the forest. They're killing everything and they're coming this way. More than ten thousand now."

The two rangers exchange glances. "Right. Well... We were left with instructions two days ago to bring any survivors through. You bear the Vial Of Ilsevele. I'm sure the Coronal will be most eager to see you."

Riglan thinks... The army never rested. It'd be about 3 days normally... So he says, "I think they'll be here in a day. You'd better get everyone out that's not planning on meeting the army here." "It's just the two of us left. I'll take you to Myth Drannor. The other will warn remaining scouts to pull out." There's nothing left to save now; there's nothing small groups can do.

**The South part of the forest is lost.**

We head (accompanied) to the fey path entrance for Myth Drannor. It takes about 40 minutes, approaching 11pm. This elf knows fast ways; the strangely now familiar sight of the tower appears.

We start to feel the drag of the heroes feast as it begins to taper. Adrenaline too. Exhaustion starts to hit, along with the mental scars and processing of what we just saw.

At the city, we're taken to the Coronal directly. "The Chamber Of The Council Of Myth Drannor" has been reinstated. Around 20 people here; for elves, this is a busy room. They seem to be planning something. A debate about timing; they hear about our estimation of only a day until Elven Court is overrun - they'll head out first thing in the morning to cast the last Gentle Repose. The weave at Myth Drannor is, in the end, just too damaged to do it here, so that plan had to be abandoned. If they had enough time they might've been able to repair things, but there's no time.

Riglan gives a very brief version of what happened to the Coronal. He explains about the Sending message and what happened; she explains that he seems to have new allies now. The death dragon is not something she recognises from her whole life of several thousand years; we don't know how to kill it. The sages don't recognise it either. The breath that both kills and raises is entirely new. They start getting into it... Riglan holds up a hand; "Forgive us - we're travelling to Elven Court with the priests tomorrow; we *must* rest. We can talk more tomorrow."

It turns out that there's another drama. Lesther and Isteval are not supposed to be here. They are to be escorted out! What?! *But* they've done their part. Now Isteval wants to get to his army and find a way to get Lesther safely home.

Seeing the condition we're in and as a strange to thank Lesther, Riglan casts L8 Mass Cure Wounds. 40hp to allies. Then says, "Feyrun will always be in your debt." Lesther smiles, weakly but getting stronger as the spell takes hold. "At least I passed my master's paper!" They're both put into stags, apologetically blindfolded, and as they're led away, Riglan shouts "Isteval, we'll see you on the field of battle" and Temo adds "And by the looks of things we'll see you first!" (terrible blindfold pun). They'll be taken to a fey path that'll guide him to his army, and he can help Lesther find a safe path home from there.

"Oh. That's strange. It feels strange, now, just the five of us..." says Riglan.

Nethza are very badly affected by what she's just seen. She's fearful, not so much frightened, of what is going to happen. Anxious. Horrified, hopeless. Temo looks kind of the same. She says, "What - what have we done? I don't mean what we've *just* done. I mean, bringing him through here? There was nothing we could do..." - we succeeded on our mission; but that last thing that happened - we were powerless; we ran; we only just escaped. It was a defeat; the dragon won. Everyone else died.

Temo mutters, "...it almost ate me..."

Maireagh is stalwart, silent. Looks concerned. Fussing, making tea... She even casts Private Sanctum, just distraction.

Riglan says, softly but clearly, "Stop. Just stop a minute." He pulls everyone together. "That was... The worst thing we've ever seen. But that's what he does. We could look at that - I look at that - and think, we can't fight it. We can't win. We have no hope. But that's what he does. That's what *you* told me he does, and you were right. He - breeds fear. Hopelessness. That's the weapon. Not the rest of it. We know so much more about him and his powers and the things around him now. We are far, far better prepared to fight him with our *own* army. So, we have to find a way to push the horror aside. To focus on our allies and rely upon them and trust them."

Maireagh says, "We still need more information. We need a way to kill that dragon for good. There's no way we can let that near the army."

Riglan nods. "Yes, did you notice in our first battle how it didn't seem to care if it was hurt? I understand why now. And it wasn't radiant or sunlight or anything much that hurt it - it's not like a vampire; there *must* be a way. That's why I asked to go back to Elven Court tomorrow. I don't know if that dragon will be there, but maybe we'll get another look at some of those forces and figure something out. And, maybe we can ask the gods. But I don't know what god of *our* plane can tell us about another. But tonight, we must rest."

Maireagh hands her special tea. Riglan says, "They're finding quarters. I think I'd prefer just a bed roll, here, in a corner somewhere..." - and Maireagh says she's cast the Sanctum here anyway. We're just outside the council chamber; well, looks like this is where we sleep.

Temo says, "I'll be right back" and dives outside. He finds a corner and casts L3 Sending to Quelline.

"Sorry for silence. Magic resources must be conserved. We have many allies. Big battle coming. Hope you are safe."

"Baldur's Gate is busy. I miss you. Carp too. Dark dreams seem current. I hope I dream of you. Look after yourself. Come home soon."

The spell fades. Temo just sort of stares at a wall for a moment, then says, "I miss you too".

An elf comes over to him. "Are you looking for the bathroom?". Temo says, "Well, that's one way to kill a moment - no, I'm fine, thank you." Temo returns to the sanctum and goes to sleep - as best he can.

### 12,000 XP each



## Day 55 (approximately 291 days since Riglan's 100th birthday) 

291 via 146 + 3 months (90) + 55, except we lost ~5 months in the Shadowfell, the jump happening on exiting that plane on campaign day 23. So, 146 + 90 + 23 -> 259 days, but +150 for 5 months means Riglan's calendar birthday happened around 106 days (give or take) into the missed period. We are, by Feyrun calendar, at 1 year and 76 days (except that 5 months period is not exactly 150 days at all; we never did nail down the exact date).

### 8am

Unfortunately - but perhaps inevitably - Riglan wakes up screaming, to the sound of Temo shouting at him to wake up; he's stood over Riglan's, looking really scared and worried, shaking him by the shoulders. Riglan's face feels strange and when he touches it he realises it's a combination of tears and a cold sweat.

So much for the brave face of last night's "don't give in to hopelessness" speech!

As soon as he's got his bearings enough to realise what's going on, Riglan just starts saying "I'm OK, I'm OK..." over and over, standing, as Temo calms down then hugs his leg, silent for a moment, then just mumbles, "Rough night for all of us. Nethza didn't even sleep." Riglan sighs; "I guess so. I don't even remember it! With everything we saw yesterday - I suppose it'll take some time to get over it. And maybe Azalin's close enough to be influencing us, as well."

Nethza is clutching her pendant. Riglan goes over and hugs her. "I can't get through!" she says. Riglan suggests maybe that the fractured weave here interferes. Perhaps we try again back at Elven Court, if there's time. "But I've been waiting for an answer all night. Sometimes she does that... I really need a reply *now*!" "What did you ask?" "How to kill the dragon!" "Would it be useful to you if we tried to cast a Divination on top?" "I just wanted a sign. Something. Some hint or clue. A weapon! Maybe there isn't one." "We could try asking the council - they heard about the dragon last night and have had a few hours to think about it."

At this, we all open up. Riglan talks about the things he saw when we rescued the two elves in the Shadowfell, at least in abstract terms, and the things his owl saw as the vanguard forces "built" golem creatures from the forest animals. We face an enemy who has fought Cormyr and Cormanthor before, and knows their skills and tactics. But hardly any of *us* remember him. Moreover, his forces seem stronger this time, while ours are doubtless weaker.

Maireagh has run the numbers; there's no way the dragon can be allowed to get to the army. Total game over.

We figure, identify his key weapons. That near-instant raising of the dead - the generals and the dragon. We'd be overwhelmed. The dragon does not behave like a summoned entity; it's not just obeying, it's behaviour indicated personality, intent, independence; taking pleasure in death. This matches the elves' theory of an extraplanar being. Bad though that is, it means that if we *can* kill it, it's unlikely that Azalin can simply conjure up another.

There are people in the council chamber. Riglan heads in, says good morning, and asks about a specific concern. Those who are re-raised seem to lose their minds but keep their abilities. But do they lose their *memories*? What if a ranger was turned; if they were able to lead the army on the fey paths? Riglan asks if they could collapse those, if it came to it.

Commotion! From elves, no less. Four people are speaking at once. Temo arrives with the helm, but can't *speak* elven. Riglan tries to calm them down; to avoid panic; the question is a hypothesis to be prepared. But they are in deep disagreement. Interestingly, all say that it *can* be done. But whether or not it *should* - a different story!

* Yes, but why? No need!
* It can be done temporarily but very difficult and quite damaging, and for specific targeted endpoints ("fey crossings") - plants and animals around the area could kill a lot of things that depend upon it.
* An old ritual does it and severs the whole plane from the fey wild.
* It can be done but it is very unpredictable - chaotically rearranges all entrances and exits.

Riglan's thoughts: It's very much a nuclear option. If we felt strongly that the fey paths were compromised, then the temporary option might be the best way - close off anything nearby. Riglan re-iterates to the worried elves that it was *just for information and options* with *no evidence* that there is a need and nobody would even *consider* doing anything that drastic or risky on a hunch or mere precaution. We'd need to be *sure* that Azalin's forces were in the paths *and* represented an imminent threat to our forces as a result.

We ask if there might be by chance any kind of library; well, the books of Elven Court are here. But it would take a very long time to search for clues for it, without knowing *what* it is. We need to know the nature of this creature - the name a book would give it. "Or if you want to risk it - you could ask... Well... Perhaps times are so desperate..." they say "...speak to **Caprice** who is one of the ancient spirits - beings, entities - of the Fey Wild, one of the most learned observers of, particularly, dragons." "Risk it?!" "She is, as her name suggests, capricious; a regal being which embodies mischief. We try and avoid her! You never know what mood she's in. She would as soon help us as hinder us, and her reasons are her own. But she *might* know what this creature is."

The priests/mages are leaving for Elven Court at 9:30am, we're told. We have an hour or so. Riglan draws a deep breath, sighs, "OK, so, where do we find Caprice?" "Take any path into the fey wild and step off the path. The way to get to her is to draw the attention of the boggits and pixies who revel in mischief!"

We thank them and return to Maireagh and Nethza. Riglan says, "I have a very strange idea..." "Oh no!" says Maireagh. He and Temo explain about Caprice and Temo's already on the same wavelength. Maireagh's eye rolls look like unconsciousness. To avoid getting lost off the fey path, Riglan and Temo can use their familiar fey spirits. We can make a literal song and dance noise to get attention and if we then do meet Caprice - hmmm, then what? Maireagh suggests - "isn't it obvious? Her name is literally Caprice!" - we trick her. The whole thing has to be a game. Our objective is to get the answer out of her. Her objective is to hide it. A battle of wits... Temo looks kinda Fey in his fancy clothes, and has his headband. "And wouldn't that be the best thing? To play and *cheat* in the Fey against a capricious adversary, with the band." Riglan asks if anyone has a hat; Maireagh produces her bonnet; Temo starts backing away; "What's wrong with my bonnet?!"

"What do *I* do?" says Nethza. Riglan goes, "Ooh! I know! Nethza and I - one of us always lies and one of us always tells - " "NO!" interrupts Maireagh, loudly.

We won't have time before we go to Elven Court. We can keep coming up with ideas as we head there. So we have breakfast, pack up, and just before we leave, Riglan, for no apparent reason, uses a charge on his staff and casts Goodberry. He gives one to everyone saying, "No reason, they're just nice" - but then kneels down and gives one to the dog, "This is a treat!" he says.

Maireagh just watches. The dog balances the goodberry on its nose. Riglan says, "No, eat it!" but the dog doesn't seem to understand; then mashes the berry in its mouth. "Good try!" says Riglan. Then he looks at Maireagh and says, "I think the dog is becoming something a bit more. All this time with us. It listened to me, you know, after the meteors." "Well it's a smart doggie!" "Yes, but I wonder. I wonder if it's - in its own way - becoming alive. More than just a construct. Or is that impossible?" "I don't really know. I'm not sure. He's definitely changed a lot over the last year and a half that he's been travelling with us. Doesn't resemble what  I made in the first place - so many changes. Maybe. Maybe it's a different being than it was. Hard to say."

We catch up with the priests; we're ready to go, so are they.

It takes an hour and 20 minutes this time, slower than our arrival with the scouts. But we don't mind. We recognise this route, so this must be the one we used before. Last night we weren't really paying close attention, all things considered!

While travelling through the forest parts, Riglan realises it's noticeably quieter. And there's movement - a feeling of migration. We're a long, long way away from the incursion point in the South, but news - especially in the form of alarm calls - travel a long way and can propagate very quickly. There's a feeling of fear, coming from the South / South-East - and rightly so!

The fey path looks in good shape.

### Roughly 11am

At elven court, we ask where the three priests need to set up; the Tears Of Silune, the moon pool. It will take maybe an 70 minutes to cast the ritual - they say they're very prepared and setup time, normally quite lenghty, will be next to nothing.

We head up with them, Riglan rationalising that it's a good vantage point for starters. Riglan wants to see this army! He casts Bless on himself, climbs up a bit further, wildshapes to a giant eagle - for speed, in case of dragon escape! - and gets up high. Perception adv., 1,14+10+bless->4, yay. 28 total!

A grey swathe of clouds is visible to the South, on the edge of the forest there. There seems to be a string of grey clouds, in fact, which is suspicious. As he gets his (eagle) eyes into it - he realises that the **Southern edge of the forest is on fire**. Those are smoke clouds. There's possibly some faint motion in the clouds, but that could just be the smoke billowing. He can't see ground level of course, but does look at the canopy closely. That seems largely intact but for the smoke and fire. Nothing else in the canopy indicates an oncoming wave of destruction; this does mean he's no idea where the army is. He circles. Around in other directions, things largely don't look changed. It's just the South.

He notices other birds. A flock of - of all things - ducks, flying North. He can't speak to them; he can't cast spells; the leader of the flock sees the giant eagle though and diverts away to avoid him. He can hear them though; "45 degrees to the right, bank bank bank!" - not the most helpful!

He comes back in intending to land; but he senses colder air, suddenly; colder than when he went up. That can't be good. It's only a little but noticeable. He tries to see what it is, perception adv with bless only 19, it's hard to see in the trees. Changing plan, he lands in a tree which looks strong enough, changes to himself, casts Speak With Animals and looks for a creature. Chipmunks?! A family, moving their nuts. He asks if there is something near? The temperature is changing suddenly? "We heard that there are strange, restless wandering - well, spirits? Shambling, aimlessly; they embody cold. They are cold dead." "Nearby?" "We heard that they are headed this way." Riglan says, "I see fire to the South and see many animals fleeing. Take your family North." "Yes!" - and they scamper off.

Riglan climbs down the and runs back to the big main tree, then climbs back *up* and says to the party - "Big fires to the South. Can't tell where the army has got to, but something is approaching. Remember those stories about cold? Whatever this is - or these are - some kind of cold spirits. Can you feel it? The air's getting colder!" Temo perception nat 20+6 - "Oh! Yes! It's colder. It's definitely colder!" Maireagh produces some sort of gadget that she says *measures* temperature. "It's two degrees colder!" she announces.

Riglan says, "OK, Temo, leave your crab up here. Have it warn you if it sees anything. I think we need to be on the ground. Weapons ready. Everyone down."

We descend. Temo's bow is at the ready. Riglan readies his staff. Nethza casts True Seeing; she touches Temo - he now has true sight. "That lasts for an hour" she says as the same time as Temo goes wide-eyed and goes, "Woah! What is *that?!" as he sees strange magic effects and all manner of nuances he'd never normally see - and Nethza answers, "*That* is probably the Ethereal Plane". Maireagh helps the rest of us See Invisibility.

Riglan risks Commune With Nature through the staff. Takes a minute; nothing upon us in that time. It might do nothing but it's at least a *hope*. Up to 3 miles...

* Influence from other planes of existence: Immediately felt. Pervasive. Focused towards the South East, within 3 miles clearly.
* **He can detect some 50-odd undead within roughly 2 miles!** They feel moderately powerful and move slowly towards us, Northwards, not necessarily aiming for us but just sweeping.
* Other people: Anyone else alive in this general area, other than us? He detects one person, towards the South West. Not far away actually, maybe half a mile. Up in trees. Ranger?

The undead will surely reach us before the ritual completes. The ritual is maybe 20 minutes in at this point, with another 50 minutes to go. The undead can probably cover the 2 miles in 40 minutes; they might be slower, but we can't risk it.

He updates the party with the bad news. Probably got to rescue someone in the trees; but that's close by; and we need to slow down more undead than we reasonably fight. "Slow them down?" says Maireagh. "How exactly will we slow them down?" "Yes!" answers Riglan. "Haven't got an answer for that yet. Person in trees first! Whoever that might be is in *grave* danger. Riglan wants the others to stay here to guard the priests, then wildshapes one more time into a nimble, fast-flying parrot and darts off through the trees.

Takes about five minutes. He finds a scout. He wildshapes back and shows them the pendant. Says "I'm part of the effort against Azalin. You must fall back and help me with the priests; there's a large force of undead on the way. It takes some convincing; they think there should've been signals from the South - but maybe they were evacuated (or killed). In the end they agree to run back with Riglan and help guard the priests while we deal with the undead. Takes ten minutes. Riglan is outpaced by the ranger (athl 4+8->12) and even stubs his toe at one point but we get back to the big tree. The other three are quite worried.

So, we have a lot of problems now.

* The undead, obviously. They're closer now. 1.5 miles probably. Too many to kill.
* The spirits, or whatever is making things cold. A pervasive influence.

And besides, how did that cluster of undead get this far in the 12 or so hours since we hit the forest edge? Could it be that they *have* found routes through the fey paths?

Ugh. One problem at a time.

Temo says, "Look, I'm seeing sharks flying through the trees over here. I can see EVERYTHING. I still have this thing..." - and pulls own Riglan's owl totem, throwing it to the ground. The giant owl appears. It'll have to do its best to fly amongst the trees; too bright up top. Temo asks it to fly out in the rough direction Riglan indicates - really just south west - but in a search course, so winding around, trying to find these strange spirits. Maireagh says, "Wait! Take this" before he flies off and hands him her temperature gadget.

Perception 17, and he uses the temperature thing to try and narrow down the location. After about ten minutes, covering around a mile, he senses that he's definitely going the right direction. It's a lot colder here. He presses on, more cautious though, investigating; 10+15->25; he can see that trees around here have strange, long scratch marks. They're not just at ground level - some are high up. His spell-enhanced sight detects strange supernatural scars at the scratch sites, some kind of necrotic shadow damage. History, 19; a mild panic! He realises "I've seen this before..." - a familiar presence; the Shadow Fell. Did something else come through, brought by Azalin? Or has this perhaps been here the whole time, a coincidental incursion? The coldness now seems familiar, too; he thinks really hard (Luck) point, Nat 18+5 - 23 history.

Oh no.

The room. Scratch marks on the walls. The thing on Nethza. It's here. It's probably looking for...

...he spins the owl around and guns for the party. L3 Sending to Riglan, "It's the creature that was plugged into Nethza in the shadow fell. It's headed your way. I'm coming back."

It'll still take ten minutes to get there.

Meanwhile, 15 minutes ago - Temo flew away. Riglan says, "OK any ideas? How can we distract or slow down this group of undead? I can make plants grown and stuff, but they're spread out - a lot of them - it wouldn't slow them much." Nethza can create the 60ft wall of light, but again, "only" 60ft long.

Plant growth isn't bad; it might redirect them, or slow them and he can recast offen. Nethza if it comes it can use the wall of light, but then it's game on for battle and we might not be able to get away. Riglan *may* be able to pull us via tree back to here if there's a big enough tree nearby. But that'll be that for the rest of the day.

As we're discussing ways in and out, Maireagh mentions a bit of a serious issue - if we end up cutting it fine with the undead (and we most likely will) then we can't really go to the same fey path for Myth Drannor; it was to the South! The Ranger we *hope* will know the faster route, or at least a different one, such as whatever we used last night. **So... Ranger definitely can't die!** - not that we'd ever want any other outcome.

Suddenly Riglan gets Temo's very distressing message. He responds, "Cannot risk more waiting, then! We will leave immediately to intercept undead. Catch up with us on the owl". Then, to Nethza and Maireagh - "Bad news..." - and explains - "...so we've got *that* to watch out for as well."

We leave, but we are cautious - a little! - to avoid running into the undead group full-tilt. Perhaps (ideally!) we can keep hidden, else it's a fight we can't win. As for the monster from the Shadowfell - we are hoping that the group of us on the ground, especially with Nethza, will be a tempting target and help keep it *away* from the moon pool and priests.

About fifteen minutes in (~40 mins casting time left) 

"Wait. What?!" says Nethza. "I have a very vague memory of this. Why can't I remember it?"

"Count yourself lucky. But I think you're going to get a chance to remember it soon enough" answers Riglan. Maireagh says, "But I didn't see it!" and Riglan says, "I didn't get a good look either but from Temo's description afterwards, we'll definitely know it when we see it!"

A little under 10 minutes later, Temo rejoins the party, the owl having helped navigate the forest very swiftly on a diagonal course to intercept us. We've been proceeding cautiously and barely a half-mile out from the tree. The undead have been heading towards us and are probably faster, so they must be very close!

* 70 mins prep starts, Riglan flies and detects influence
* 50 mins ritual starts, Riglan informs party and goes to fetch scout
* 35 mins, Riglan returns with scout, Temo flies on owl
* 20 mins, Temo messages back to warn about Shadowfell; party receives warning, starts toward undead cautiously
* 10 mins, Temo catches up, as we're going slowly; less than 1/2 mile from tree.

Temo is keeping a (true sight) eye out for the Shadowfell beast and stays on the owl for mobility, but then, suddenly, his sling sounds! He whispers an urgent warning... But it's not needed, because more or less at the same time, the whole group feels a strange tingle on the skin as hair stands on end; and small frost flakes start to form on the grass and leaves of bushes and trees. We can actually *see* a wave of creeping cold, a wide, cold front, sweeping through the forest. Behind it, a cold fog obscures the ground. But Temo "feels" nothing of the Shadowfell beast...

Riglan can hear the sound of dozens of feet crunching frozen ground. Initiative:

* Riglan 23
* Temo 15
* Nethza 11
* Maireagh 7

Riglan drops in his bear totem, then casts Plant Growth into the fog, at an angle, figuring he might have time to cast two radii that overlap a bit. First one to his right. There's a kind of groan from the forest as plants burst through frozen ground; wild, tangled brambles, vines, centred 150ft away from us at the leading edge of the fog that's *just* in range, a 100ft radius area affected. Even trees drop down vines and lianas, push out low branches, bushes expand - but it quickly freezes again. He runs sideways to his left to start making a gap calling, "gotta move for the next spell!"

Temo gets back on the owl! It flies up onto a high branch, Temo jumps off sideways onto the same one tries to see if he can look *down* above the fog layer. Perception is only 15. It's all frosty white and a tangled mess now! Hard to see anything. He readies his crossbow, but that's about all he can do.

Nethza flies too. She can't see much. She goes left, tracking with Riglan; creates her shadow blade; then casts Crown Of Stars.

Maireagh runs forward, dog alongside, but spreading distance between them; in this case heads more to the right to help give Temo some from-ground cover. Hammer is at the ready; with her bonus action she does something which seems to "activates" parts of her armour, into which she adds some reagents and suddenly a shield of fire appears around her! Well that, or something went horribly wrong, thinks Temo, seeing from above... ...and Maireagh then strides into the frost, ice melting around her.

The fog over on the right is being held back by plant growth but it's spilling through on the left. Riglan hears crackling and crashing from within it, but it's a wide swathe; they're already in the right-hand undergrowth; feet crunch to the left, unencumbered. Quick as he can Riglan runs as far as he go and casts again, in the counterpoint direction, from more or less under Nethza. He activates the staff too. The new plant growth pushes through and disperses some of the fog, and to his left he sees briefly bluish-white wights, marching in a wide front - they're clearly combing for people in the woods.

Disadv perception 15, he sees enough; those wights are not human. Slight and tall. They carry themselves in a strange way, elven? But not elves as he's seen them. Some new form of elf. Their dress looks "old fashioned". History, dirty 20... Wait a minute... Are these Shadar-Kai?! But they're undead! High ranking too, from the dress. Riglan had a theory that this group could've popped up so close, deep in the forest, via a Shadowfell portal ever since Temo mentioned the "beast" via Message. He's never heard of any mentions of undead / mind-controlled Shadar-Kai, though! *All* Shadar-Kai are meant to serve the Raven Queen. It *seems* that these don't...?

Temo can't see anything. He risks jumping on the owl and flying in deeper, moving 60ft on it in flight. He's keeping above the tangled growth. Very cold. As far as he can see, it's just strange creatures entangled (he doesn't know it, but Shadar-Kai). They're freezing wights, freezing things around them - he now at least sees that this is where the cold comes from. They make plants frozen and brittle then smash them, but move very slowly. He flies back to where Maireagh is. Maireagh is calling to him - he was trying to be quiet! - and he calls down, "Don't go in there, you'll just get snared and there's far too many of them. They're moving very slowly. But any that *aren't* snared we'll have to take down!" then he turns to head further to the right, in case any are spilling around the edges that side.

Nethza continues to head left - she can see that the fog continues a fair bit further that way, beyond the plant growth - similar thought to Temo. 100ft flying, gets her to the edge of plant growth area.

Maireagh decides to stick with Temo rather than try and wait near the middle of the overlapping plant areas; she runs full-tilt, melting ice as she goes, after him. He's faster though. "Slow down!"

Riglan sees Nethza fly *past* him and carry on leftwards; he's not sure why, but figures she must've seen something so does the same. She's fast, and he has to burn a spell with Misty Step to keep close.

Temo hears Maireagh saying "Slow down" so, obviously, guns it! He can see beyond the plants and there's some 60-70ft of fog spilling beyond and in front of the plant zone. He tries throwing a bonfire under the closest one, figuring they must be pretty vulnerable to fire; it dodges, *gracefully*. What - elves?! What's going on? He readies himself to get steady on the owl and get a good aim as soon as he can.

Nethza flies another 50ft and she, too, reaches the spilling-forward fog on her side of the plant 'wall'. She doesn't hesitate upon seeing the wights - she counts 7 - she hexes them, then flings 3 eldritch blasts out. Miss, hit, hit; 18, 19 damage to the nearest creature. As the hit, she takes a second and gets a better look at the creature; it staggers, stops, but *doesn't seem to notice her*. It just keeps staggering forward. They *all* do, ignoring her. She calls back to Riglan, "Something *really weird* is going on here! They're possessed! These are *not* Shadar-Kai! Don't let your eyes fool you!"

Maireagh is at full-tilt burning her way through the ice, just making it to a similar position to Temo; Temo sees her arrive and she looks like she's preparing something.

Riglan catches up Nethza and sees about 8 of them. He considers conjuring beasts to try and halt them, but then realises that the plants do well, so just launches Plant Growth again. He centres as close as he can, even though he'll be caught in the effect. He'll figure out a way to get clear later, probably Misty Step, so tries to not leave too much tangle behind him - hopefully 30ft. At least he gets to see how much this slows them down, very close up. He's very close to the cold; fails a CON save; 12 cold damage.

Temo aims and fires at the closest "elf". He *just* hits, 41 damage. Part of this creature seems to almost shatter off, as if it's frozen; clearly is badly injured, staggers, but it's *not down*. And just like Nethza saw (unbeknownst to Temo), it still tries to advance and the others continue too. It's getting **very** cold! CON save, 18+2, lucky roll; half damage; 13->6 cold (13 not 12 -> fog on this side is a bit colder). The owl is more seriously affected; takes full damage; 39->26 HP.

Nethza tries attacking the same wight as before again. Eldritch blasts; all 3 hit; 17, 11, 15. It takes all that to bring it down - only the final blast shatters the creature. She transfers the hex and flies in closer, but then gets hit by the cold herself. She makes the CON save, so 12->6 damage.

Maireagh runs forward about 30ft, bringing the dog in behind her, throws the hammer; there's a branding smite burning upon it, as it hits. She's aimed for one that Temo didn't even see, more or less directly below him and closer to her. 34 damage - the radiant seems to affect it badly, as hoped. Second throw hits too; 19 more. It's still up too. They're hardy! She instructs the dog to attack. It hits! 10 damage. *Almost* more. Maireagh resists the cold due to the fire shield and also makes her CON save; 3 damage. The dog is affected too somewhat, CON save made, 6 damage.

Riglan can see the wights trapped and struggling in the vines and brambles. It's done a good job. He has to use Misty Step backwards to try and get clear. He doesn't *quite* get clear - his aim was a bit off with the spell - and has to use as much effort as he can to clear the edge of the patch. Universal cold damage roll 10 - CON save fail - takes all 10. It's interesting experiencing your own spell first hand!

He calls up to Nethza, "We could keep picking them off, but I'm worried about the others, and don't want to leave you alone in case that weird beast Temo saw comes... I'll be up there in a moment!" but she calls back, "No! Use this opportunity to take as many out as we can! This will only hold them for a couple of minutes!"

Meanwhile all Temo can do is keep aiming and firing. He goes for the same one he hit before. Hits, 28 damage on top of the 41 earlier - it goes down. He fails CON, owl makes it; he takes 10 cold damage but the owl only 5, leaving it with 21HP.

Nethza picks another target - hit, hit, hit. 14, 11, 17 damage - 42 - and throws in a star from the crown too, for good measure; hits; d6+4d12 *radiant* (!) -> over 60 effective - no contest; it's incinerated. She calls down, "They're weak to the power of light! I've got these, but they might get out of the middle!" - she takes 5 damage from cold (save made).

Maireagh runs further into the fray, 6 creatures close now, backs up, takes a firm stance with heels dug into the frost, then pulls what looks like a perfect metal sphere out of her pocket. She casts Conjure Barrage - throws the ball into the air, activates it, it shimmers and flies forward, but seems to multiply into a hundred balls spread out in cone. DEX save DC 19; 4 fail taking 14 damage each, 2 succeed taking only 7 each. She takes 5 damage from cold (i.e. CON save *fail*), dog likewise (save made).

Universal cold damage for this round - 10 again.

Riglan hesitates briefly, unhappy at leaving Nethza, but can't reach her with a throw for the Horn of Silent Alarm, then just calls it... He runs 30ft back towards Temo/Maireagh, then, L3 all used, so L4 (wants to save L5+!) Conjure Animals for *two* giant eagles. Initiative 13. He tells one to protect and guard Nethza, then jumps on the other.

Temo CON save fail, 10 damage, owl makes save, 5 damage, 16HP... Temo aims and fires at one of the more injured remaining creatures. Just makes a hit - 37 damage, on top of the 14 from Maireagh earlier. He's worried that the owl will die - it's not conjured - so asks the owl to land, and brings it back to totem form. Maireagh stands between him and the ragged row of advancing undead.

Riglan's eagle flies him back to the centre point. The other flies up next to Nethza

Nethza makes her CON save (5 damage), then throws another star - hits - 66 - then throws blasts; crit, 13 damage; it falls immediately, the next blast is already on its way and hits the falling creature, she tries to redirect the third to another undead, but it goes wild and misses.

Maireagh gets hit by the cold again but the shield helps (takes 5), the dog saves (so, also 5). She backs away a bit, as the row is advancing forward. She uses the barrage again - one takes 7 damage, the other six take 15 - including the one that Temo hit, for 66 damage total now; seeing this, she tells the dog to attack it, which hits for another 11 damage. It goes down. 5 left!

Universal cold damage for this round - 9.

Riglan fails the CON save *again*, 9 damage. Eagle likewise, 25HP left. Insight, 21... Why are these things just walking past us? They're not attacking. He sees that the plant growth is destroyed by them reaching forward and touching the plants, freezing them to death, then they push through them. And they're all just moving forwards towards the big tree. They're intending to freeze the big tree? That's just even more confusing if so - Azalin could kill it in an instant. Their powers do seem to be to kill the plants though.

The plants in front of him are already blackening with frost. They're just about through. The entire forest around there, in fact, seems dead.

He's considering sunbeam but it's awkward - they'll all be scattered around from cutting through different depths of foliage; not in a tidy line, as they emerge. And he'd lose his eagles, of course! Instead, same-old; upcasts Plant Growth from the eagle, flying upwards and backwards 80ft and casting 100ft away into the middle of the area. He has to be careful to avoid any tree branches growing and entangling the eagle. (It's a prepared action that happens once the eagle can move, so that's after Temo's turn below).

Temo is still at it! 9 cold damage. He aims at the most injured looking one and does get a hit, but not great; 30 damage; that one's taken 59 now. Trouble is, he doesn't have time to move and ends up side by side with Maireagh. He won't be able to aim on his next turn, or they'll catch him.

The eagle with Nethza guards over her. It fails CON save though, 9 damage, 25HP left.

Nethza takes 9 damage too, but hits with the crown star, but 4d12->13 only! 26 damage. Eldritch blasts on top! Crit, miss, hit. 14, 6, low all round. 46 total.

Maireagh shouts to Temo, "Alright... You're in the way!" "Do you what you have to do!" - she moves back 30ft and uses one last barrage. Temo DEX save nat 20+11! 31, deftly dodges all of it. All five of the undead take a full 12 damage. The one Temo hit goes down, four left. The dog, though, gets hit by the barrage and takes 12 damage in addition to 9 cold! It's being a bit beaten up. The dog tries an attack (since it's there anyway) but this time it misses.

Universal cold damage for this round - 6.

Riglan figures these things go in straight lines. He can fill in the space between this new central patch of plants and Nethza, so prepares the spell and asks the eagle to fly that way. He's up clear of the frost now.

Temo (CON save fail, 6 cold damage) has to back away (behind Maireagh - bonus action dash). The dog is in melee with one of the bad guys, so once he's got some distance he fires; hits; 35 damage. It goes down.

Riglan's eagle gets into position and his plant spell fires.

Nethza's eagle CON save - fails, 6 damage, 19HP left.

Nethza transfers her hex, throws three blasts out; gets 37 total damage; the injured one now finally falls. Four bad guys are left.

Maireaigh (CON save succeed, only 1 damage) runs *forward* to stand between two of them, so she reach both with her hammers. They're 10ft apart, but if she stands dead in the middle it just about works out. Both hammer throws hit; the one on the left has all the worst of the damage piled on; 32 total - it falls - and on the right, 19 damage. Still up, so she gets the dog (CON save fail, 6 damage) to have a try - but it misses.

To Maireagh's surprise, the wight she's stood in front of is being blocked by her so it reaches out to attack - and hits. 3d6->only 5 damage plus 3, 8 cold; halved to 4 by the fire shield - and it takes fire 2d8 fire damage too, 9 doubling to 18 - and that takes it down! The further away one just keeps going. 2 left.

Universal cold damage for this round - 11.

Riglan asks the eagle to start flying the other way again, back towards Temo and Maireagh - he just has to hope that Nethza is OK; he needs to block the path on the other side.

Temo (yet another CON save fail, 11 damage) can aim again as he some distance. Hits, 38 damage; it falls. Only one left!

(Riglan's eagle flies 160ft towards Temo, passing the centre line once more).

(Nethza eagle CON save fail, 11 damage, only 8HP left!)

Nethza (CON save success, 5 damage) fires blasts - another crit, miss, hit! 20 damage, then hits with a star. 29 damage, doubled; this one falls, 3 left. She tells the eagle to retreat out of the cold zone.

Maireagh sees only one target left. She attacks! Hit, hit; that's enough given prior damage. None left!

Universal cold damage for this round - 10.

Riglan prepares one more plant growth spell as the eagle will get to range soon. L5! All lower slots taken.

Temo is about to dash back towards Nethza but he sees another wight just clearing the edge of the plant growth area, so he runs back 30ft and then fires; but he misses (he was dialling in the -5/+10, but it wouldn't make any difference).

Riglan's eagle gets to the right location, but he sees Temo perilously close to the radius edge and has to tow in the spell a bit. He calls to Temo, "We need to start retreating back to the big tree!"

Nethza's eagle flies clear of the cold - but 18+1, CON save success, takes 5 damage, has 3 HP left.

Nethza (makes save, 5 damage) throws a crown star - crit! 8d12 doubled. 78 damage. It's gone! Two left. She throws blasts at the next one... Two hits, total of 21 damage.

Maireagh shouts, "No! They're coming through!" seeing the one Temo just fired at, but she's too far away to attack it. She's heard Riglan shouting about pulling back but this one on the edge could be a problem. She decides to risk the long-range attack. Amazingly, two hits despite disadvantage! 1,1,1,1 rolled `:-/` so she throws in an Arcane Jolt. 23 damage, plus 16 for the second hit, 39.

The cold is easing off... Not many left nearby.

Riglan asks the eagle to fly back towards Nethza, while once again shouting, "pull back!" Maireagh shouting, "Nearly, nearly, just one left!"

Temo aims and fires. Hits, 36 damage; that takes it down. He turns to run calling to Maireagh, "Let's go!"

Riglan's eagle moves 160ft. The other eagle keeps as close as it can to Nethza.

Nethza throws the penultimate crown star; hits, very solid, 38*2 -> that one's gone. She throws more eldritch blasts on the last one, two hits, 20 damage.

Riglan's eagle reaches Nethza - sees there's only one left - tells her, "We're pulling back to the big tree" "OK!" and Riglan throws fire, hitting for 11 * 2 -> 22 damage.

Temo flees 90ft diagonally, heading back around the new growth patch. But he realises he's going faster than Maireagh and turns to keep an eye on her.

The eagles hold position.

Nethza sees that the remaining creature is nearly down so holds the star. She transfers the hex, then throws out three blasts; hit, hit, hit! 35 total in the first two alone; it goes down. She starts to fly onto the eagle. Riglan shouts, "OK, we'll go to the others!" and both eagles fly full tilt back to meet Temo and Maireagh.

Temo waits for Maireagh to catch up and they continue running with the dog at best speed until the eagles turn up. Riglan goes to offer her an Eagle, but she says "don't worry!" and casts Fly on herself and the dog. So now we're limited by Temo, but he can ridge the medium sized dog and fly with it. That gives us 60ft speed, so we're doing 120ft dashes, keeping well ahead of the undead. Maireagh though tells Riglan and Nethza to fly back and check on the priests; they'll hang back in case more comes through. Riglan warns them to try not to engage though as without the plants to slow them down, they'll just keep coming.

It doesn't take many minutes to get back to the big tree and, after the battle and collecting people etc., the priests have just one minute left. Riglan asks the scout what's going on and Riglan quickly tells the scout and asks about a Northern escape fey path? "No problem! I can find one. But are you... Why are they coming?" "To kill this tree, I think". "Oh... Right... Well, we need to hold them off another minute before the priests are finished with the spell". "No problem, they're a few minutes away."

The eagles alight in the tree rather than on the ground. Nethza and Riglan wait there, close to the priests. We watch as they complete the ritual. The magic emanates out from the pool, as the whole tree starts to glow. There's a sense of something happening below, in the forest; Riglan looks over the edge to the ground, DC25 perception - 19+10 -> 29, lucky; he sees root systems picking up a glow, flowing very quickly from tree to tree, spreading out very quickly, connecting to every dead creature in the ground - Gentle Repose magic cascading out from this tree. This is why Azalin wants it destroyed, and Riglan figures that must be why he's not coming himself but sent these other creatures - he's found a way to get them closer, via the Shadowfell, while he's far back, because he wants it felled as quickly as possible.

The priests panic at the thought of the tree being taken down. Two insist on staying! Riglan nature 16, he knew cold was killing them, but can't be completely sure that there wasn't anything else included too. He did see the blackened path they left, but that looked like frost damage. So he tries to convince them; it's a terrible thing, but as the Coronal said, it *will* regrow, "in just a few hundred years". Persuasion is only nat 10+4, 14, they agree but just won't budge. "We are priests of the pool of Silune. It is our holy duty to protect this tree." They lose their intimate connection to the powers of the moon if it dies. They consider it betraying the oath that they make.

Nethza pushes back - if they fall and are taken, they are *not* protected by the Gentle Repose. So they would form part of Azalin's army. Riglan tries another angle too - lots of undead, more than we can stop, in just a few minutes. There's very little chance of living long enough to cast again in 7 days! But persuasion is only 9 this time.

Riglan slowly at first, and then in a flurry of fast movement pulls his blanket out of his backpack and says to the others, "Blankets! All of you!" and then hands two each to the priests. "They're cold. Freezing, unnatural, these might not even help, but they might give you a chance..." and then to the others again, "How long do you think we can keep picking them off before we *must* escape? What have we got left?"

Maireagh looks in her bag. Her fire shield is failing. "Maybe a couple of smites." Riglan nods. Nethza says, "I've two walls of light left in me." Temo shrugs; "Plenty of spells but nothing useful against them - just the bow and arrow, but I'm compromised by being unable to move if I'm effective." Riglan says, "Yeah, I've some high level stuff left but a handful - two or three - I can so sunbeam..." - the priests say they can bring down the light of Silune.

Riglan says, "OK then. We'll stay until the last moment, but understand, we can't take them all down. It'll be up to you, when we run, if you make a last stand here - which I'll be honest, seems crazy, but also, braver than I've been..." - perception 27. The temperature is falling quite quickly now. And he sees a tree nearby - it jogs a memory - finding the cure for the forest poison... There was a very similar tree, not too far from Myth Drannor. He shouts "Hah! I think if I hold a spell I can get us through this tree, to Myth Drannor at the last second."

The ranger and other priest warn us to hurry. They must go! The other two are at first angry that the third priest would leave, but Riglan points out that this third priest lives to fight elsewhere and carries the Light Of Silune to battlefields beyond. They relent and agree not to part on bad terms. The ranger and priest must go; as a last act, he casts Bless on us all.

The fog is visible now. "Remember!" says Riglan; "This time, see if you can in sideways, along their line, since they don't stop and will get past us otherwise..." - but as he looks up he sees that the front has curved and converged, so he points and says - "...oh! Scratch that, that might make it easier!"

Temo perception - even with luck point, 3,4+6->10 he can't see individuals through the fog. "Too many of them! Can't get a clear view of any individual!" - so Maireagh says, "Yes, too many for smiting!" and casts Web. The two priests bring down two moonbeams into the middle of it to start searing some of them. Temo can't do much else other than throw down a bonfire, left of the web; so Riglan goes, "Right, that's the play!" and throws Sunbeam down the right. Nethza has her remaining star spinning and throws eldritch blasts in various directions.

The moonbeams move around like searchlights; Temo uses bonfires unless he has an aim; Maireagh throws webs if destroyed and tries the hammer even at the distance as it helps when they can't move; Riglan keeps sending out radiant rays. The dog is guarding the priests.

A few wights finally break through and channel a cone of cold which blasts out; we all take a hit, the priests losing Moonbeam so they start with sacred flames and other tricks. Riglan uses his cloak to hold his spell; Temo ducks and rolls to dodge a fair bit; Nethza throws a curved wall of light into the middle of the advancing group.

We fight well, but we know we can't ever win. Spells fly furiously. Nethza's down to her last wall of light, *just* in front of the tree. Surprisingly, there are only 6-7 of them left, but they cast down a sleet storm which pummels us. A priest falls, Riglan then calls Mass Cure Woulds L7, holding his last highest spell for our escape, in case of attempted counterspell... One priest thinks victory is near, but there's another wave of cold and now he falls too.

Nethza says, "We have to go!" but the remaining priest is arguing against. Temo reaches down and collects his plucky crab, that has been keeping watch on the priests and ducked down out of danger at the pool's edge this whole time. Maireagh grabs the unconscious priest; Nethza says, "I'm so, so sorry..." and *stuns* the remaining priest, grabs him. Riglan sees a huge branch that's perfect for it, he'd spotted it earlier, L8 Transport Via Plants and we run for it. Nethza's final act is to throw the last star into the middle of the final group and detonates the wall of light, but the last thing we see, is that there are still some of them up...

...and we go through the portal, appearing South of Myth Drannor. Maireagh casts another cure spell on the one that fell. The stunned priest comes to, then starts raging angrily; "What have you done? Where are we?" and Maireagh slaps him! "Your friend is *dying*! We *had* to go." The priest apologises.

On coming through the tree portal Riglan spins back as it closes and roars in rage and sadness, beating his fists on the trunk, then spins back. "We were **SO CLOSE**. If we just had **ONE MORE** of us! Just one!"

Nethza is super apologetic. Riglan calms down and says, "I'm a druid. I feel the loss of that tree possibly more than *you* do. But I couldn't have dealt with losing the two of you as well, knowing you'd become part of his army. Your *souls* would be his. For an elf that's... Well... Worse than for me."

He does his best to try and navigate to Myth Drannor. Survival 7+10, he's very distressed. It takes a while.

With heavy hearts we make our way back. Nethza says at one point, "I know how much this has hurt us. But this is not a failure. We haven't lost anyone. And we have locked Azalin out of raising his army. We're forcing his hand; staying perhaps just half a step ahead. And this is turning the tables instead of constantly being a step behind."

At Myth Drannor, there's a scene of recovery - another demon incursion. It was pushed back more easily thanks to Elven Court's extra people. Elven Court are shocked; they've not witnessed this first hand.

Riglan asks for Ilsevele; says he knows she must be very busy but it's important! It turns out she sees us from out there in the city, hands-on, helping... One look at us. "You've returned. Oh no! It's just the two of you?" The two priests say "No, he left separately with a scout..." Another scout here asks how long ago they left. Only 10 or 15 minutes between battle, portal and walking in from the tree. The scout is relieved. "Well, it takes much longer than that on the fey path."

The priests explain what happened. "But you were successful" she says. "I sense a renewal of the magic." The priests don't know what became of the tree.

Riglan sighs and says, "**I haven't been that angry before. Ever.** I *hear* them. I hear the plants as they die and cry out in pain. And the animals. Everything. All the extra growth I made magically, being ripped to shreds; all of it. I think the tree would struggle to survive. But I can find out. And I must. I need some time."

"I share the fire with you" says Ilsevele. She touches him on the chest. "After all, you do carry pieces of the fey with you, as do we. Our greatest strength and deepest weakness; but it is who we are. Come... There are skills we learned to tame them in times when we are not well-served unleashing the full weight of our emotions. Our burning souls. You see, we have to practice and exercise a great amount of restraint right now. I'm sure you are aware that he is burning the forest?" "Yes." "He's doing it to draw us out. To pull us into a direct confrontation with his forces. It takes every ounce of will for the Elven Nation to not respond to such desecration of the land. It is the only reason he does what he does."

Riglan answers, "I can divine what happened to the tree. Though, I think I'll need to rest first. But there is another problem. That dragon, whatever it is. Someone called 'Caprice', we're told, in the fey, must sought and convinced to help us..." - she interrupts - "...You must rest before that! You are being fuelled only by the fumes of rage. A very volatile rag to operate upon. I would know. I have been there."

Riglan relents. Nethza is drained too, she didn't even sleep last night. Even though it's only early afternoon, we have to bed down.

Teom says, "Well, I rely less on magic in battle, so..." - and he calls up his Tiny Hut. When it appears, he says, "For old time's sake".

People start to head to bed. But Riglan can't let it go. He finds a corner, anywhere will do, sets light to some incense and - thinking this time of Silune - casts Divination with just about his last spell slot (all L3 up gone). But instead of smoke, he sees a *vision*. A pool. He feels an instinctive need to dive in, so does. He follows it down, deeper and deeper, and there deep down, seems to be a forest, frozen and blackened. Leaves, flowers, grass, everything; dead... But... A voice; in the middle of this tree; "these things happen. The larger trees have enough wood, enough *soul* and life force in the roots - deep down where the cold can't touch them - and the heartwood *has* survived. There were too few of the wights left to chill the trees to their cores." On the surface, the forest looks dead. In spring, it will be renewed.

Riglan heads into the hut and Temo is just heading out. "Be right back!" says Temo. Temo finds a corner, uses his last L3 for Sending, to Vip (of "and Johm"). "Hope you reached Scardale. Stay several days. Ashara's Crossing ransacked, but fixable, but dangerous right now." A response; "Yes! Scardale is fearful. We see the burning night from the city. We thought Ashara's might be gone. You are somewhere safe I hope."

Temo heads back in, bids farewell to his friendly Familiar crab, then sleeps alongside the others.
