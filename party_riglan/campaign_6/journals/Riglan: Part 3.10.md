# Riglan: Part 3.10
## Day 27, mid-spring (Silverymoon)

We wake after our first night at Silverymoon staying in the University accommodation. Riglan and Temo wake first. They whisper plans to each other, discussing what to do. It boils down to 'Thunderspells' to get started.

Soon after, Nethza and Maireagh wake; Maireagh disables the alarm. It didn't trigger overnight. All our belongings seem intact. No weird dreams!

We're not sure about the local time, so we head out of the room to look for a clock tower. It's already 8:20am! "No time for tea", says Riglan, "we should get queueing!" so we ask Temo if he can find his way to the relevant council building. He has no trouble finding it, just by asking a few people for directions along the way.

Town is lively in the morning. Mystery D20 roll -> 12. We're quite single-minded in our focus; Temo is focused too. Soon enough we're at the base of a small rise with the building atop. It's no castle; buildings ahead look like a kind of cluster of smaller buildings. Signs indicate that the area is named **Council Hill**. As we head up, a building some 2-3 storeys tall across the lower part catches our eye. It stands alone with only a few trees around, none of which it is built into. Seems to be a kind of entrance building that leads to the buildings beyond. It's wide and heavily decorated. A number of guards stand by. What would be pillars are rendered as statues, of different trades; "pillars of the city" - things that keep it going. Gardeners, artisans, carvers, smiths, shepherds, farmers and more.

We walk up unchallenged by any of the guards. There's a lot more stone here, less nature. An apparent attempt to be imposing, a structure of authority or stability. There's a short walkway and then five sets of doors, all open. People move freely. We can see through to a room inside, to three separate raised stations of some kind, where at each, around 3 people are leaning over railings with scrolls and boards behind sheets of paper, with people gathered around talking to them. Now and again a runner takes a scroll and heads off towards the sides of the main hall.

A few eleven - judging by armour - guards stand in corners, a few on patrol. They carry sheathed swords. The large space is 12-13ft high but that means there must be at least 1 or 2 floors above.

Temo figures we need to see people at those three raised areas, but given what we know about the regimentation and order of the city, we need the *right* one. He says he'll investigate - 18+14->32! - he can weave between people easily. Be puts on his Helm to be able understand all languages. Suddenly, an attendant spots him. "Young sir! What is the nature of your visit?" "We are a delegation from Yartar, bringing tidings from the Lord's Alliance, with a message and gift of equipment for Taern Hornblade." Temo is told he can't be sent there directly - not enough authority - a colleague will be called. A runner is handed a scroll and comes around to Temo asking to be followed - fortunately he understands Temo saying there are 3 more, and Temo is asked to lead to them! Temo is quicker than the runner in a crowd and has to keep waiting.

We're all joined back; Temo emerging from the crowd, followed shortly by this young elven person (the runner). Temo explains briefly, "We should follow this guy!" just as the runner says to the whole group, "Ah, yes, good morning - I will have to take you to the Scheduler who will be able to arrange for your visit." "That's fine thank you".

We're taken to a side alcove with stairs leading up to a second floor with lower, 10ft high ceilings. They carry on up, so there is indeed a third.

There's a landing area and main central foyer area with decorative wall panels and beautiful cluster of hanging pendant lights, above a table with a sprawling decorative plant atop. The runner checks his scroll, then takes us to a specific one of some 8 or so doors that lead off the central circular area, arranged in a ring. He knocks. We don't hear a response, but after a brief wait, he opens the door and tells us to follow. Inside, we see someone at a desk in front of another door, with various sofas and chairs. A waiting room; nobody there yet. Another door is set in the back wall.

The person at the desk stands and is handed the scroll. He says "...Who shall I be addressing?" in Elvish. Riglan says in Elvish back, "I can help translate for Mr Temo here, who represents Yartar and the Lord's Alliance; we have paperwork."

The person behind the desk suddenly switches to perfect Common saying, "Common?" - Temo removes the helm. "Ah! Yes. Thank you." Temo introduces himself and hands over the letter. The man takes it, gets is to sit, starts reading then looks startled and stands. "I'm terribly sorry! I didn't realise. Master Smoothhands, I will schedule someting for you as soon as I can! Please make yourself comfortable, Lord Smoothhands. It will not take long."

Riglan looks at Temo. "*Lord* Smoothhands?!" and Temo looks him dead in the eyes and says, "Of course. Who else did you think you've been travelling with?" The letter is on the desk, opened now; Temo sneaks a look.

* It's a formal introduction; a letter of attorney indicating that "Mister Temo Smoothhands of Old Owlbear Keep" is an official member of the Lord's Alliance, as in, *he* is himself, is "authorised to represent the Lord's Alliance through the authority of Lady Nestra Ruthiol, Water, Baron of Yartar". We note "Waterbaron" is split into two with an oddly placed comma - almost makes Nestra sound like a "Baron Of Yartar". A rather convenient error...?

* There are the usual boilerplate pleasantries and advisories. "Please accord him all the rights and privileges of the station" etc. etc.

Temo reads it out loud and his eyes growing wider and wider as he does so and then goes quiet. Riglan says, "Well, we might have to start addressing you by your formal title soon."

We wait. Not for long! A couple of minutes later, the man returns; "Right! Yes! Let me take you back downstairs and someone will take you to the High Mage's Tower. I'm afraid the earliest appointment I could secure was the one immediately after the one he has right now." Temo says, "Well, that is excellent, I'm most grateful."

Back down stairs we go, but this time we go out of double doors in the side of the big room there leading to a veranda of some kind. A guard is asked to escort us to the Tower.

It's up a hill. Very beautiful! Sympathetically built next to a very large tree, with low sprawling branches; the tower is elegant, gentle twisting ridges or spines on the walls, not too ostentatious, rising above the large, but wide and low tree. The top is slightly bulbous. We enter at the flared ground floor, mushroom-like. There are some sparse decorations and a small round table; this is just some kind of entrance way, not a lived-in room. We're left alone; the guard heads back.

Someone arrives from a small room at the back and greets us. She says, "Master, uuh, Lord...?" - "Representative of the Lord's Alliance, but not a Lord yet! Master is good" answers Temo. "By the time we got your letter, Taern was already in a meeting and couldn't be interrupted", she apologises. Temo says (again), "Really, it's fine, this is a far faster audience than we expected."

We're taken up a fair few stairs to a library-like room, used as a waiting room. Windows in the wall spiral up, not all at the same level. It's an interesting vibe; a semi-circle, half the tower here. Riglan tries to find anything about the Netherese, but (investigation 7) it seems to just be about people. He checks one. It seems to be a kind of biography about someone presumably important - not that he's heard of any of them!

Maireagh's got her notebook out and is making notes about, who knows what. Temo flips through his statecraft book. Nethza is checking the view out of the windows. After about ten minutes we hear some muffled, getting-louder voices from the adjacent room. "I wish you well!" says one human, maybe in his 60s, standing in the doorway as another older human leaves. The other human says, "Right!" and looks at some kind of rectangular slate, tilts it, seems hard to read; "Master Smoothhands...?" and Temo says, "Yes! That's me!" "Have we met?" "No, I don't think so sir..." "Oh my goodness, we don't need to be so formal. I am Taern." "It says here you're from the Lor - oh! You must be new. Please come in."

We introduce each other and he formally introduces himself, including his nickname Thunderspells. Temo asks how he got it. He appears delighted and does his apparent party piece of a loud thunderous noise.

We end up sat in a rough circle as he magically pulls chairs from the room around. It's hard to tell his age now, looking more closely. The way he moves might indicate much older, but not *everything*; he sits like an old person but otherwise walks OK and he speaks as if much younger. It's a confusion. Temo says, "Forgive me, but I rather assumed - my apologies - that you were in fact an elf." "Oh really? I understand that... Because of Silverymoon and all that..." "And longevity!" "Ah! Longevity, huh? So how old do you think I am?!" - a dangerous question! We navigate it OK. Turns out he's 110, though when Riglan had suggested 160, he does say, "It'd be nice to see my 160th - but we shall see." Magic may slow time for him, but it does not stop it.

The first order of business, when asked by Taern, is the scroll and the case. "The Waterbaron of Yartar, Nestra, asked us to deliver these to you" says Temo. "We were told they were for your eyes only." Persuasion, advantage thanks to statecraft, 31; there's a certain order of service with statecraft, according to his book. Always do the official things first. You never know how long you have with someone. Get it done quickly!

He opens the case with mage hand. "Ah! She remembered! That's fantastic" - he moves the chest aside. We don't see the contents. "We had a friendly wager that she would not be able to find these..." - he pulls out a couple of bottles of brandy! It's apparently a quite specific kind. We don't recognise the writing on it, but it looks dwarven (which Maireagh later confirms). He shows us now the case; beautiful jars - "Ah, my favourite, they only grow in the hills..." - he opens it and smells the contents, seems delighted - it's some kind of smoking thing. Tobacco or similar, for a pipe.

Smiling, he opens the scroll - he touches the seal which disintegrates into shards; security, it seems, can't be pried and put back. He starts reading.

Riglan perception 23. Taern's been very jovial. Now he's reading. This changes. A cloud descends over his face. He sits forward more, then back. He finishes reading and stays deep in thought for a while. The scroll falls from his hands, onto the floor, curling back into a roll. He looks at us, then starts to inscribe something in the air, drawing a finger in a circle; a silvery-blue line goes around the room. We've not seen this but can guess what it might be, as almost a curtain of silvery glitter seems to fall down over the walls. On the ground, the scroll starts to rapidly age! It crumbles and turns to dust.

Riglan says, "Safe to talk, I take it?" but Taern holds his finger to his mouth for one moment - the silvery curtain hasn't quite completed. Then it knits fully. "It is now" he says. "Very serious allegations if they are indeed true. How certain are you of this news?"

Riglan has to confirm - does he mean Azalin Rex, not something else from the scroll that we don't know about and a moment of risking accidental confusion and information disclosure? It is. So Riglan says, "Well then; we are very certain."

"Well at least we had a year of relative calm" he says after a sign. "It's time to alert the whole network. This is still quite far in the East?"

We say yes, but he might move faster if he gets artefacts. We also mention that he has reach - the Drowned attack. Taern nods; it's in the scroll. Nestra impresses him; she's very good at what she does. "For a city with the limited resources that Yartar has, she manages to do *very* much with it, by applying it deftly where it is needed. If only Silverymoon had that kind of care and skill!"

Riglan explains how it was done. Taern says, "Ah, he planeshifted." Yes. So did we. "Oh! Who did that?" Temo read the scroll. He looks impressed. "What school did you learn from, or are you innately - I'm curious..." and Temo does his best to explain. It was from a scroll anyway. "Well, it shows you aren't afraid to take big risks" "I had to - we were rescuing a friend!" "I can see why Nestra trusts you."

* Several things must be done, he says.
* His first duty is to defending Silverymoon.
* He asks what we know of his magic; the dome protects much; we don't know really but he can control some of the undead (e.g. those Drowned) and *those* could pass through; draining the land energy would probably not get inside the dome but would certainly destroy everything outside.
* Riglan warns to keep watch of any signs of corruption or sickness that might indicate an oncoming corrosion or attack, *if* it comes this far North.
* He has his own research to do, and meetings to organise. **We are granted access to their highest libraries to research whatever we need**.

He asks what we're going to do. We mention the Netherese stuff; to try and see where Rex might be going, not for us. And there's the Seer of course, "V". At this, he writes something on a scroll and mage-hands it to Temo. "When you get to the Grand Library, please give this to the attendant at the House Of Knowledge, one of the buildings in the library complex. He will assign you - well - I've been following at a distance the early career of a particular initiate - I think he would be the perfect research assistant!"

The usual pleasantries. Thunderspells cancels all his other meetings today. "Might see you at the library!" he says as he goes to his desk, muttering, then realises he hasn't lifted the ward - apologises, does so - so we can leave now!

And so, we leave. Riglan senses a change in Nethza's mood. She's worried. He falls into step alongside her and quietly asks her, "You OK?"

"Um, well, no! Did you - did you feel like - do you feel like he was quite powerful? I don't know why, but I kind of - I thought that... I thought that we were going to be talking to someone quite powerful. I don't know. I guess I had expected that letter to be - I thought when we gave that to him he'd say, 'leave it with me, I have this sorted'. He's not fixing it for us. I thought he would just fix it. I thought this is what we had to do... I mean... I know we have to do this. I just thought for a moment that, you know, someone with a lot more capability than us would step in!"

Riglan thinks a moment. "I know what you mean and it's one of those things I think where his character is such that you don't immediately realise how powerful it is or maybe quite how much she's going to do but we do know that the dark powers tasked *us* with this."

**"I know. But... Are you tired?"**

"Yes, though not as much as you - you've been through more. And here's the thing... There might be some catharsis in seeing him, in person, taking him down with swords and spells until the Dark Powers can recapture him. Though I do not doubt the difficulty and danger of the path involved."

"I know. I know it's true. I just for a moment thought he was going to..."

Maireagh is listening but can't hear, uncomfortable from body language, "Is anyone else hungry?!"

Riglan stops. He nods to Maireagh then hugs Nethza and quietly whispers, "I hoped he would too. Truly. But, I guess this one's on us, again? For some reason? And we're not alone. Even if it's just the four us, in the end, we're not alone." "I know. We're not alone. And that's the only thing that makes it OK."

Temo says, "So, uum, maybe not so fancy. They don't have street food! Did anyone see any cafes or just kinda more homely places? Late breakfast?"

Just on the fringe of Council Hill, we get our answer - there are lots! We know to avoid the one called The Chambers - it's the faux, fancy one. We look for the lowest rent. Temo, investigation 19+14->33! Out of the corner of his eye he spots someone with a cloak over an outfit Temo recognises. Those people work in the big hall we were just in, on those raised areas. He meets some girl, a peck on the cheek and they enter an assuming looking cafe: "**The Gentle Doormouse**". Temo points. "That one!" and marches off. Riglan finds it much easier to keep up without Thunderspells' case!

A bustling atmosphere. Tables are crammed close together. There's a long bench looking out the window. A narrow but long space has stairs going upstairs. A short bar is to one side with a kitchen visible behind. Heat can be felt coming off it.

There's a table free, near the stairs. Riglan sits down and says "I'll keep the table. Something with eggs. And tea..." expecting us to have to go to the bar thing to order, but we're greeted by someone almost straight away. Table service! A middle-aged gnome comes out of saloon doors for the kitchen with a large tray above his head, with food he gives to a table, then comes to us and offers a menu. It's only got 4 items:

* Green eggs and ham
* "From the bakery!"
* Cinnamon Spice And Honey With Porridge
* Meat Lovers

Riglan's never had *green* eggs before, so orders that. Temo decides to check out how good Silverymoon's baking is. Maireagh is all for the porridge and Nethza says she'll have the meat - we can compare - but the gnome enquires if she really wants that; not *that* much meat perhaps - so he recommends the green eggs too. She agrees. We're offered hot drinks; tea? Mastica, tea, "tonka"? We haven't heard of that. Four tonkas? Maireagh looks unsure. Three and a cup of tea? Done.

We talk about how we're tired. I suppose we've done a lot. If we could take out a day it'd be nice but given the approaching threat that seems quite cavalier. We can't get to the East too early; nobody would know who we are or why we're there until the Delegation arrived. But there's the Seer.

* We need a map - is it quicker to go to the Eastern city then head back to the desert, or quicker to go from here?
* Is cloud flight a faster way to travel then those skimmers, if we could get a ride on one to the desert?
* We need to run the numbers.

The drinks arrive. Tonka is strange. Not mastica or tea. A carob-y, milky, buttery, almost sweet-spicy thing; not unpleasant, not chocolate but close; a bit strange for breakfast, mulls Temo, but perhaps good before bed. Shortly after, generous portions of food for - brunch? - arrives. It's very lively here, but also affordable. The whole thing comes to 1.5sp each, 6sp all round. Much cheaper than expected. The food is good though Riglan is a little disappointed that the green eggs is a herbs thing, not some special bird from the area that lays actually green coloured eggs!

Maireagh's trying to find reasons why her porridge is good but not great, but clearly is enjoying it and her expression is showing us that she's taking mental notes!

As for baking - a woven wicker basket with a chequerboard red and white napkin inside with, placed atop, 6 different amazingly buttery-smelling, flaky pastries. Temo tries one and his eyes go wide again. He's doing that a lot today. He goes very quiet, in a good way.

Riglan leans back. "Is it a weakness? That I care about you so much? It's just stronger every day. It seems like that could be used against me very easily... I suppose there's not much I can do about it..." he sighs. "I wouldn't want to not feel this though. About any of you. Even the dog!"

A portly woman, maybe 50s, emerges from the saloon door; looks like a cook. She approaches. "Right, well, looks like that was enjoyed!" and starts clearing the table. As she does, a tiny mouse runs out of her sleeve, looks around and runs back up. Riglan asks, "Oh, are you a druid?" "Huh?" "The mouse!" "Oh! This is just Belinda. She's my friend. We - well we don't have kids so we have a lot of animals in the house." "Mind if I...?" "Of course!" and Riglan puts his hand out. The mouse is cautious. Riglan says, "Don't be scared" in Mouse. It sniffs at his hand.

It's not like wild mice; it seems quite relaxed, not driven crazy by food smells. A bit shy. "Nice place to live" says Riglan, in Mouse. "Yes yes very! Many friends! I get to come here. It is my turn today!" Riglan nods and says, "It was nice to meet you." "Nice to meet you as well. Bye!" and it runs back.

She says, "Oh, she likes you? Are *you* a druid?" Riglan nods. "I am. They're happy here. The mice. You liked my baking?" Temo, feeling like he might be cheating on Yartar, says, "...*Possibly* the best I've had..." She thanks him, finishes up clearing and heads off.

It's our turn to free up the table so we head outside. The gnome shows us to the door.

### 11am

We figure we might look for a map before diving into the library. Taern might not have had a chance to get word to them yet. Persuasion via Reliable Talent 5->10+15->25. He asks about a map shop; there's one very near; he enquires if it's especially recommended; they say we should ask at the shop. We also learn that there are no city maps - it's a byelaw!

The indicated shop is only two doors down. Seconds away. It's a book shop principally, which looks rather like a service business that's sprung up because of the proximity to the council.

It is called **Scribe Stop**.

Inside, it's a general stationers - notebooks, scribes, writing instruments, maps and so-on. Things that council people would need.

As we approach a counter. We're greeted, and explain that we're after a map; and get into details about our specific needs - Cartographer's Guild they suggest, given that we want reasonable distance accuracy. We're warned that they're quite unusual, but there's always a chance as they've never sold one before!

We see as they dig through all sorts of trader maps and merchant maps; they're for specific tasks, rather than just route planning with reasonably accurate indications of distance. We work with him for about half an hour checking various things, after which he suddenly has a lightbulb moment - "Ah! I have an idea! Come with me" and leads us to a section called, "History". He digs around and pulls out an historical book that chronicles early explorers who wandered far East. Within the map is a roughly drawn map of the area with places of interest, written 400 years ago! The book here is a copy of an account kept in a library elsewhere, but the account talks of a 3 year journey to explore the ruins and wonders of the Anauroch Desert. 20 left and only 1 returned. **40 Months Of Wondering**. It's not got anything further East - Sembia, Cormyr and so-on - but offers a valuable insight into the desert area itself in a way that we would not otherwise have.

It's in Dwarven. We can deal with that. Other maps he has - of things further East - are no better than the maps we have; roads, places of interest, relative position but no accurate distances. It's not deeply surveyed (of course). They're 10-15 years old too, so a few things might've changed. He suggests that we might consider alternative - more practical - ways of achieving the goal; **there's a druid circle on a hill** not too far from town, which can perform observation; a beautiful view of the sky; they navigate using the stars. They make star charts and explore surrounding areas, wandering quite widely. They might have something to help for navigation, at least. To help us find our way. He also names one more other book and map shop with "slightly more esoteric tastes than I" - he figures it's worth asking. But if nothing else - the Great Library would have things, though we can't take them away. There's also the Trader's Guild. They can't tell in miles, but they can tell in time.

We would definitely like the historical accounts book. As politely as we can, we ask about the price. It's a copy, so only 12gp - we gladly pay without bartering.

Esoteric shop next. We're given directions. We have to work our way across town on one axis, though it's on the same side of the river. It's small. Only seems to be a bookshop, too; it's tucked into one of the winding roads leading up city slopes. One door, one window, a bit grimy; it doesn't seem to get much sunlight. Maybe two storey? Maybe two and a half? Hard to say; it conforms to the curve of the street.

**The Lucid Pangolin**

Certainly esoteric. Riglan strides in; there's a small hallway of random cutesy books, hand-made gift cards and soft toys. Beyond, a half-elven old woman sits on a stool at a counter which curves around her. "Good afternoon! Are you lost?!" and just after this tiny space is a steep stairway leading above. She adjusts a pair of glasses. We explain that we were sent here on recommendation by Scribe Stop - she seems pleased.

Shelves are crammed full of books. Isles are narrow. Books often don't really fit the shelf; they stick out. Great care is needed... But there are *many* more books here, crammed floor to ceiling. Inside, it follows the hillside - 20-25ft deep floors, then more stairs and another level.

Riglan is about half way through explaining and doesn't even finish a sentence when she says, "Ah! Come with me!" and tugs him along to a section on the second floor. Pulls out a large book, reaches back, something is stuck; yank, yank... A shelf then slides over, to reveal another behind! "Anauroch. Netherel. Netherese empire. You want lore? No, you said a map. Yes." A thin, but large book is produced. "This may be interesting!"

We move to a small table with some other books on nearby. She hands Riglan the book as she clears the table away, then takes the book back - blows, cloud of dust! - handles it carefully. It's old and fragile-looking. It's less of a book and more of a folder - full of maps. Inserted between pages, almost like pressed leaves, are thin pieces of parchment, about A3 size in our world. They're not cartographers maps, but they show an area called "**The Anauroch**". 

Temo, investigation 29; he notices that some of these show cities and roads. He points it out - "So this is *before* it was a desert?"

"In a sense! It was a long process... This is what it looked like before the return of the Second Netherese Empire. This land, as I understand it, was already turning into a desert, but it had not completed it. It took a long time for it to fall into ruin and be buried. This whole books is maps of different parts of the empire as people remember them. These used to be very popular; that's why I have a copy; they were being produced for treasure hunters! Those searching for riches in the remnants of these fallen cities."

She realises we want to buy it, looks happy but then looks crestfallen. Riglan insight 29, realises it's about the cost; but he mentions that we have been adventuring, and it is not without its rewards. **In the end she agrees to sell it on one condition - we must look after it. She's had it for decades and it is rare now.**

100gp; no problem.

The other thing she has is a few traders maps. But they're of various ages, and may be too old. While the cities haven't moved, sometimes the roads do! She digs around and finds some from a retiring caravan party, purchased around 20 years ago. There's every chance that with the second sundering, wars, rebuilding and changes in kingdom boundaries, that it might no longer be that accurate; the travel times could've changed if the conditions of the road have improved or worsened. On reflection, she recommends a more recent map; the Trader's Guild - Cormyr, Sembia - are major trade routes so they'll have up to date stuff.

Riglan enquires, thinking of Maireagh, on a personal note - about any books related to the history around this area; especially tensions (and good times) between Elven and Dwarven nations. She says she has a book of the Alliance of the Silver Marches. The seller looks to Maireagh as if she might think it's a difficult subject, but Maireagh is unfazed. She fetches the book - a big, thick tome, leather-bound. It's clearly quite old, worn leather, faded on the edges a bit, but in overall good condition. Some 600-odd pages, detailing the birth, trials and the collapse of the Alliance Of The Silver Marches. "There will be records in the Archives here at Silverymoon detailing, well, showing original documents that are referred to in this book. Silverymoon was a member of this Alliance. It was seen as the great hope of the north, bringing human, elven and dwarven kingdoms back together. No such alliance has been heard of in these lands for more than 1000 years. The time of Ilpharn." (Riglan smiles a little at that). "That was an alliance of knowledge; but *this( was an alliance that fell apart because of defence arrangements. And Silverymoon is certainly to blame for much of that; the Dwarven kingdoms were well within their rights to withdraw from the Alliance, as the Elven nations did not to their defence. And in turn, the Dwarven kingdoms did not go to the aid of Nesmé when that was attacked. The Alliance fell apart - the Kingdom Of Many Arrows would chip away at this Alliance until all of its flaws were revealed; all the selfishness and self-interest."

The conversation continues. It's a really interesting discussion, especially about how elves are very reluctant to enter battle but dwarves - similar lifespan - are happy to do so. The book isn't rare; 25gp.

So, 125gp. Paid. The books are bound; we should keep the maps away from water, and in the desert the wind can gust! Riglan hands them to Maireagh. "She certainly knows how to look after delicate, valuable objects."

"What a wonderful day, to meet people who find something of interest to them!" she comments - we guess she rarely makes a sale.

Just as we're about to go, she says, "My name is **Patricia**, by the way!" and Riglan laughs, he's forgotten *again* - so introduces the party. If we're ever back this way, we'll be sure to visit.

### 1pm

The Trader's Guild is over the river, quite a distance and we feel it less urgent now. Taern's magical message to the library would've been acted upon quite quickly, but we didn't want to arrive almost straight away and pressure them - now, though, it's been a couple of hours (ish) and we don't want to instead be keeping our assigned researcher waiting!

We arrive at the 'precinct' of town with the "Halls Of Knowledge". A series of buildings are constructed around *very* beautiful, tall and sturdy-looking trees. There are four towers in total, plus the main Hall of Knowledge which forms an entrance to the overall complex. There are names - "The People's Library" (the largest), "The Great Library" and so-on.

Maireagh looks and groans - "I see a lot of stairs in our future!"

"Maireagh, you can *fly*"...

We realise people have been using library names rather interchangeably - we aren't sure which we need - but there is the "House Of Knowledge", an administrative building, where Temo indicates is a good place to 'check in' and ask about the researcher. It's a house - two storey; a villa. We head inside; the door opens, it's quite dark inside in comparison and someone at a desk squints at us - "Can I help you?" - Temo explains. "Ah! He's already waiting for you at the People's Library. We assumed that's where you'd go. This is just where we sleep and eat!"

We say we'll head over to the Library, apologising for the disruption but he says he's "headed to work" anyway and will walk us that way. He talks about the 'urgent' message - very rare! - from the Office of the High Mage. It specifically asked for **Prik'Tak**. Eventually we're given a few more directions as the guy helping us must head another way. We follow those and get there.

Someone who'd been leaning against things, looking nervous and a bit bored, immediately stands up and heads for us. He wears a short, thin cape with the hood back, he has purple, dark skin, pointy ears, white hair tied back, dark eyes... Drow! When he gets closer, Riglan reassesses a bit - **half**-Drow? He didn't know such a thing even existed, though on reflection of course it must.

He makes a bee-line for Temo. "You must be Master Temo Smoothhands. I am Prik'Tak" and Temo greets him and introduces us. There's a room prepared, with a Quieten spell - "I believe your research is confidential?" - and then asks if we have everything we need; something to sleep in! Well - OK - Uuh... Sure.

We're taken to the second floor and a runed, warded room. Once inside he asks what he's helping us find. Riglan asks Temo to carefully get the Netherese book. Time to explain - in full.

* Netherese: That'll require the Library of the Mage Council. High level access.
* Azalin himself: Harder. Older places might hold such information. Silverymoon is too new. He notes that if the extrapolated path of Azalin towards our own home holds, it'd take him right through Silverymoon. But there is *one* shelf he thinks of in all the libraries that might have information.
* The Seer. We share all we have about that. It seems tenuous, with a widely-cast net to try and find references, but the information is newer, not old like Azalin.

- Looks like we need up-to-date info on settlements nearby on the edge of the Anauroch - places we can get to; languages spoken; who rules there; kingdoms they belong to; best ways to get there.
- Hopefully we can at least narrow down largest settlements nearby and, if we haven't got enough here, we can head there to find more information from locals who know the area well.

Where to start? Mage Council, we think. He suggests the **Paramon Library** - we don't know any better so agree. We follow him. We're taken to the Eastern of the four towers, against a large oak. Eight floors of library but quite narrow. Two concentric rings of shelves on each floor with central stairs. Small desks for research are positioned around the stairs. It's relatively dark inside - no windows! - but there are magical lights. The only natural light is very diffuse coming from somewhere up in the top floor, where we assume there must be some windows; eventually we get up there, to find narrow strip windows and only tables. We realise that the sunlight isn't being allowed to damage the books on floors below.

"Where do we start?" asks Temo. Prik'Tak takes us to the second floor. "This is the shelf here where we might be able to find things about this Azalin Rex... These are historical accounts of a particular time in the northern parts of The Vast." Seems the correct date range and geographical area.

We'd better get started.

### 1:30pm

Investigation check for Temo, 1 & 2! -> reroll the 1 -> 4 & 2, sigh + 14, but Reliable Talent; 24.

* We find references to various tyrants! Then Nethza spots something and asks about a particular word being translated for us. "I believe you are right, but I'm not too fluent in this dialect..."
* Temo helps out with reading via the Helm, occasionally lending it to Prik'Tak if Temo himself is unsure of the domain of knowledge or meaning of passages. It's an old, eastern dialect of Common, "Am-Ae-z-Lien" - we've heard this before, the Helm translates it to Wizard King. Temo nods. "Yes, Nethza, that's him".
* He's an *unnamed* Wizard King in these books. "**One from beyond**". This conveys his "alien" nature - extra-planar - not of their people. Or at least, a similar word as used for people from very far-away nations; we infer the planar aspect mostly because of other things we've heard.
* So the books refer to the person in terms of power and status - not name.

An account is read.

* "Rising from the wastes, not of Thesk but also not of Thay, Am-az-z-lien led a tireless army that grew in number as it overwhelmed the lands in its path."
* It talks about the fall of a particular city, a name we don't recognise, and despite it being very well defended, "No defence can protect against those from within".
* Implication of some control - presumably magically, at a distance - of people or (un)dead within the city walls?
* "And thus his army continued to swell". Accounts that it was indiscriminate; "soldier, father, mother or king, all joined his army as it marched Westward."
* Eventually at a rich, powerful port city, **the army disappeared into the sea! All nations along the coast were afraid, for now there was an unseen threat marching on the seabed.** Where would it emerge?
* That's as far as this book goes.

More worrying accounts, then, of Azalin's potential control over the mind. Some accounts of battles mention that he "struck fear into the defending army" because people were almost "too afraid to fight for any who fell became part of his army". So perhaps he can *raise* the dead, truly dead, as undead; and did so for dead buried in graveyards within city walls, given that reference to "protect against those from within".

### 2:30pm

Another hour. Another 24 from Temo.

* This is Common, doesn't use the "Azalin" variant word. It refers to the "long forgotten Lich King".
* It talks about "one who could not challenge the might of Thay immediately and therefore set its sights to the West" - we don't know if the reason is correct but it *does* perhaps answer the question we had about whether or not Azalin dealt with modern-day Thay.
* Accounts of gruesome battles. Azalin could "send plague and pestilence ahead of him to soften the population and prepare for his approach" - **so that he had dead he could raise**. Preparing the ground.
* Powers over weather! He could cause crop failures; there's an account that he marched behind a plague of locusts.
* "All of these are really obvious, very visible things that are impossible to hide" says Maireagh "and don't line up with what the Sembians said".

Indeed, there were talks of people trembling in fear in cities as huge plagues of locusts devoured an entire year of crops, then plagues killing citizens... So if he follows the same playbook, perhaps this is cause for hope; he's just getting started? Unless he's learned from his previous two go-arounds. We can see why the Shadowfell intervened and ended up whisking away an entire *land* - his army must've been approaching unstoppable, so there was perhaps no other way.

There are accounts of blood-sucking undead generals in the armies. Vampires, we presume. "Powerful creatures with their own wills and intelligence."

He didn't rule from a castle. He ruled from a "moving altar of death", whatever *that* means. Many attempts, say some accounts, had been made to try and "behead this demon" as one puts it - but "impossible to approach. Scores of assassins would fail." We try to find out more on that - *why* - was it a wall of force, a plague, the army, a mental control issue, *what* did Azalin do to deter these people? There are no reports. Simply, "none returned; his march continued unabated, for no-one succeeded."

Prik'Tak says, "Well this does give us some hope; we should look to military accounts. Those are on a different floor."

### 3:30pm

We head to the fifth floor, AKA "the Bard's floor". All bard's tales. "But I thought you said they were military accounts?" says Riglan. "Ah, but bards are those who talk to the generals, and weave them into tales and songs. They write them down."

Temo finds it fascinating - hundreds of years of bard recollections! Poetry and song. Some are particularly eye-catching for him and occasionally interrupts sometimes, excitedly reading out or even trying to sing (if there's musical notation) some little story or tune that he finds particularly captivating. "I need to learn to tell tales this well!" he says.

### 5:30pm

An hour goes by... Nothing much... Another hour. Investigation 29; that's more like it. Temo finds a book that's part of a big collection all written by the same bard who travelled far to the East. Cormanthor and beyond, over into Thesk. There are accounts of people who survived Azalin's onslaught, a time after his military campaign. There are stories recounted by this bard that were overheard in taverns, of old soldiers; wars in years gone by.

One is a tale of overcoming guilt. The soldier survived an encounter with Lich King's army - by hiding. "He was gripped by fear; he could see decay all around him; he **couldn't trust his eyes; he was so afraid of striking down a friend, when he thought he would strike down foe;** and in a moment of morality he ran to a nearby shed and locked himself within. What he saw next, he knows not if they are just nightmares that consumed his mind, or if he did in fact see them - but he saw his fallen comrades rise, before their hearts even stilled, and joined the ranks of those marching. **Rapid shadows moved through, strangling, gripping**, suffocating his fellow soldiers. **Madness overcame generals, who would rush at archer lines,** forced to take point-blank shots at their own generals trying to kill them. He saw beings flying with capes aflutter; he even saw the freezing of the ground, right into the shed where he was, as he witnessed **the Lich King himself walking over a pool of ice** that formed around him. Everything turned brittle and crumbled; **he felt his mind melt as he gazed at this Lich King, as fear consumed every corner of his soul**. He came to, snapping out of it a day later, naked, covered in scratches, having tried to claw out one of his own eyes. He was found by others who came through, who had also hidden; everyone kept their own dark secrets of what they saw but everyone had lost not just those they loved but a piece of themselves. He would spend every night in the tavern trying to fill that missing part of him that he could never find. Where had it gone? Who had stolen it? Would he ever be whole?"

After that, we're quiet for a while.

Riglan sighs, "This will be harder than I thought. I'm not great with undead at the best of times. And it *does* sound like he can in part control what people see; **that 'friend or foe' thing - confusion - misdirection - making the generals seem mad. Sounds like he gets into your head;** he wants you to die. And **he controls cold**. And he's never alone. Not the raised army, but more powerful things. More dangerous. The shadows, the vampires, probably other horrors. How many of those does Azalin now have, right now? We have no way to know. And precious little defence."

Maireagh says, "Well, I've made a list of all the magics we think he has mastery of." She pulls out a LONG list. Necrotic, pestilence, diseases, raising the dead, affecting things from afar, controlling your mind, psychic damage, confusion, illusions, cold... He's probably resistant to all of these..."

Can he maybe hide? Ethereal, shadows; flight; invisibility. She looks at it in despair.

Prik'Tak says, "It might not be my place - but remember, these are just accounts - and this is a bard - they are not known for telling an accurate story, more a dramatic one!" and Riglan agrees but says that many aspects, if not as extreme, match our actual experience of a domain where he resided.

Riglan looks at Maireagh. "Well, you're right. But we have to remember Ezra, yeah? One power at a time. One step at a time."

There is the question of the castle, though. He ruled from the castle in his Shadowfell domain, yet we read an account saying he does not do that. He is certainly expansionist; devouring; always on the move. He didn't want to rule - he wanted to master. Unquestioning. Not citizens or subjects, but slaves; thralls.

We wonder about Nethza. Get her to sit on the throne, so the Dark Powers don't notice he's gone? Seems unlikely. Was it just Avacyn, really, that wanted her there? We left without Nethza on that throne and the Dark Powers had no idea he'd gone, when we spoke to them at what in Feyrun had been many months of elapsed time. There's the soul thing; how did he find her anyway, when he first caught her?

Agents in this world? It'd make sense - a lich - if I die, I'll be back, be ready...

...Prik'Tak suggests we might be able to research that. Find out who they were historically; do they still "live" (FSVO "live")? Hard to know where to start with that.

We know that the most useful books came from the Eastern Kingdoms. So, if we were *in* the Eastern Kingdoms, we'd probably find more.

It's approaching 6pm, and Prik'Tak suggests we take a break. Riglan nods and says we've also got a desire to visit some druids up on the hill, but this research is a priority so we'll go with whatever schedule Prik'Tak prefers - he did after all seem to think we'd be sleeping there.

He suggests food, then the Mage Council library. We agree.

### 6pm

We head out for food. The sun is setting. Temo notices that Riglan keeps glancing at the sky, but doesn't ask why. Instead, he just says, "Where's good for food?" - Prik'Tak will have food at the house with his partner; he points out the **Bookworm Cafe** for food. We go there directly.

It's quite busy and a large, two-storey affair. The first floor is dominated by a counter with lots of food on display on shelves. A separate bar on the other side serves alcohol. There seem to be various teas, mastica brew and so-on too. There's a large kitchen; two stairways lead up to a second floor. Lots of tables on this floor though.

Riglan yawns! Temo yawns in response. Quite a few intense research hours there, and more yet to come... Someone comes up as we're waiting. "Upstairs or downstairs?" "Downstairs please" says Riglan, mindful of Maireagh. We're lead to a banquette, hastily cleared, and promised menus shortly. There are specials boards up; "Rye sandwich", "Soup of the day" has another, "pumpkin, chives, sorrel". "Bowl of sprouts" is a special apparently. Then there are what look like we'd call burgers on another board.

Riglan muses that he should be hungry, only having had breakfast but he finds he isn't - especially after the bard's tale that we found. Soup sounds good.

Eventually menus arrive; they look like small, thin books. Stuck on each page is a menu! It seems large and permanent. Riglan finds it hard to focus on it. He just passes it to Temo and says, "yeah, I think soup..." and Temo checks. "Noodles? What are noodles? I'll have noodles!" he says. Maireagh wants a burger-like thing. Nethza asks what fire symbols mean next to dishes. Riglan thinks for a minute. "We used to have these radishes in the forest. Hard to find. The smallest ones were very spicy, like, almost felt like your mouth was on fire. Maybe that? Maybe they've got radishes in?" Nethza says she's resistant to fire so chooses a dish with some kind of beef mince with cheese and corn on crackers, which has two fire symbols. "It certainly *looks* interesting" says Riglan.

He figures just some kind of herbal tea. "Fruit tea" he says, winking at Maireagh... Temo wants the same. Nethza wants lager, for her nerves. Maireagh wants regular tea.

Eventually we order. He returns quickly with drinks, puts down a small tray with a bill on it as well, before we even get food! Strange ordering.

"Well, I'm not good with undead. I might have found one or two I like, but I don't agree with Renwick's assessment of 'undead' plants. They might *seem* it but once you know their true nature, you know they're alive, just an unusual form. Undead, once you know *their* true nature, are undead. It's counter to... Everything..." - he tails off. "But we have to find a way. Somehow."

Food arrives. We start. The soup, at least, is good and settles Riglan's stomach a bit. Thick and creamy, but very fresh. Despite the business and huge menu, it's good food. Nethza, on the other hand, seems a little taken aback - tearing up, and coughs a little! It seems that the "hot" food is not fire hot, it's radish not. She drinks more lager. Riglan chuckles - "yes, I suppose radishes might make your mouth feel hot, but they're just radishes - it's not fire..." Temo's food is a thick, creamy-white looking broth with straight "strings" of what he guesses are these noodles. There are beans and long leafy greens, carrots, even turnips; the broth is salty and creamy but also a bit sweet. There's a dollop of mince on top and thin slices of some kind of ham. He says, "It's strange. The broth has a particular flavour I'm on the fence about. All the vegetables and stuff are great. This ham is brilliant! But, I think I'm getting the hang of it? But these noodles though are a bit impractical - they taste good but they're kind of hard to get a grip on" (he's using a fork and spoon). "I think I like but I think it's strange and I have to figure it out and I've never had to 'figure out' food before!" Temo looks to Maireagh. "That's some kind of... Sandwich?" Maireagh seems very happy, grease and melted cheese all over her hands.

Eventually we finish up and pay the 8sp bill. That *is* cheap. We chat a little more about ways to protect ourselves, weaponry, options; then we leave and Riglan tries to find a good view of the stars. Temo looks around to see if there's any easily-accessed rooftop or nearby ridge. Plenty! There are lots of public balconies and so much verticality. He asks Riglan about what part of the sky he needs to see. Maybe, from here, South? Temo obliges - some strange stone stairs, a terrace, a stone balcony and benches.

He finds the stars. Four. He gathers people close, points at the stars with his staff. The four previous owners of his staff. A personal religion, perhaps, but he is sure now that those are their - souls. That they watch. That was in his dreams; ascension, seemed wishful thinking. But if anything, to him, were to be a visible expression of what had been called Ezra in the Shadowfell domain, perhaps they would be it; we're not alone, not just the four of us, but because we are watched over.

### 8pm

Eventually, we make our way back to the library; more study, then probably sleeping in the tower!

Prik'Tak is already at the main entrance. He takes us to the Mage Council library this time. He carries an amulet. We approach a tower with no visible entrance, but we assume the amulet has something to do with that... In gardens near the tower he puts the amulet on the ground, speaks an incantation and it expands into a large disc. We get on; another incantation; the disc rises to the top of the tower and slots into a room there. We get off, a final incantation and the disc shrinks back to the amulet size.

"I guess we find out what's hiding in here and how it can help!" he says.

As we walk through a doorway, there's a phasing sensation - like Misty Step - and as each of us emerges on the other side, it's not what we'd seen approaching that doorway. A kind of foyer. Prik'Tak leads us to a door in the side which opens out into a vast library, spread over two floors. We are on a landing with bannistered stairs leading both down to the ground floor and up to a mezzanine. Many shelves and walkways seem suspended on that upper floor, hanging from the ceiling perhaps. There are narrow, arrow-slit style windows in the sides. We are presumably, then, still above ground?

We see a couple of other people apparently also conducting research. Each look up and nod as we pass before carrying on with work. We walk past a window slit and Riglan looks out, but is surprised to see a strange blue swirl of colour - no sky, no ground! - the building is suspended in some kind of... Space. A plane, somewhere. The view gives the whole thing almost a dreamlike quality.

We reach a whole section, "Netherese Empire". Temo investigation 17+14 -> 31. There are shelves of books, but also display cabinets and shelves with crates and padded boxes labelled in various ways. This area feels more like a museum. "Go check it out!" says Riglan to Maireagh.

* We find records of places and, particularly, cities in the Southern part of the empire, that match up to the Southern part of the desert where the Seer, Valinus Sarnastum, should be.
* This helps match our just-acquired book of maps to other references and start to get a better feel of where things might be.
* There is a place referred to as **Evereska**, the closest old city, representing the then South-Western boundary of the Netherese empire. The city is named after a splinter kingdom area of the same name.
* Evereska is south of the Grey Peak mountains, north of the Sunset Mountains and east of the Nigara Kingdom (a Yuan Ti kingdom).
* There is or was a major trade route connecting Cormanthor and The Ride, around the Moon Sea, connecting the southern part of Netheril, descending from the Greybreak mountains that allegedly delineated the eastern-flank of the High Forest once. We think we can see this on our own maps. "The Golden Road", according to old references.

Our research continues - that road is now **The Black Road**, passing through "**The Empire Of Shadows**" apparently, in more modern times - named after a sea that emerged there called the **Shadow Sea**. On the shores, the **City Of Shade** - named after the spirits that haunt it. But it phases in and out! Sometimes visible, sometimes not. Ruins of an old Netherese mining outpost. One of our maps has an inaccurate-looking scale showing of it, but not the others.

There are apparently trading caravans that have gone across there and sometimes people don't return apparently because the city "phased out" while they were within. It's unpredictable and dangerous. It's believed that there are Netherese artefacts in that city; accounts claim that on the other side of the Sea across from the city are old mausoleums dating back far enough, where artefacts were buried with important rulers as funeral gifts.

People have wandered that way when the sea was *not* there - "phased away" - and found nothing. Ships appearing at the City Of Shade when it and the city are there, say that they came from those locations; so the mausoleums must phase in and out as well. We note that we have some maps that show neither sea nor city and, perhaps, this "phasing" is why - some map makers probably believe it is not real, just a story.

Separately, further South beyond the mountains that border the Shadow Sea, there is mention of another city; **Saladear**. We have one map with an area here called **The Saiyaddar** - we think there may be a translation or spelling thing here and the names are related. The city is in that area; the map we're looking at is in Netherese but the account of the city is based on a Cormyr report.

Saladear was a southern, neutral diplomatic outpost for the Netherese. It is where they'd entreat with the men of Cormyr. A hall was used - there is a drawing - the **Floating Cube** - and that looks very like the cube-on-corner depictions we've seen for our Seer at the Savras temple. The pictures show the cube hovering high up, writings claiming that it would stay in the air until negotiations completed. How the worshippers of Savras ended up there is unclear! The last known record of a visit to this outpost town was more than 100 years ago; no reason for anyone to go since. We suspect it is now in ruins, but it *might* be intact. In any event, it is likely to be hard to find, unless somehow at a distance we are able to spot this "on-corner cube" building.

Evereska is the closest significant settlement, either way. Based on the rather inaccurate maps, it looks like the best play would be to try and get to Evereska as that seems easier to reach from here, and from there, on the road, find the Seer; rather than trying to go backwards from Sembia, trying to head up and join the same road. It also means we can teleport *out* of the desert if things have gone well - or badly!

### 11pm

We're close to exhaustion. Bed time. We ask if we should sleep here? "Ah yes, I'll show you where the rooms are..." - given the odd magic and travel needed to get here, we can appreciate why people tend to stay on site once inside.

The rooms are downstairs and off a side room. There's a corridor, with small sleeping quarters off there. Each has a small desk and a couple of beds. We take two rooms for our party and Prik'Tak takes a third.



## Day 28 - 4am - Silverymoon, Mage Council library

We sleep. Riglan, dirty 20 wisdom saving throw. He's sleeping, but he worries as he sleeps. He gets up, wanders out of the room... At the end of the corridor is a door that is open, out, into the strange blue-green swirling "cosmos" beyond. Riglan walks to the end and without hesitation just steps out. He steps into the void, and floats; he thinks about the conversation we had about stars and space between, empty? Or full, but if so, of what? But apparently, vast. He floats more. Then something starts to rise up below him - a hand, but absolutely massive, attached to an arm; and as his eyes adjust, a truly gargantuan humanoid. Riglan ends up stood in the middle of the palm.

The hand is lowered, with Riglan standing on it, to level with a giant face some 200ft away but filling his field of view, itself hundreds of feet across. It has no eyes, no hair, no ears. It has something resembling a nose but no mouth. It seems to be aware he's there though. Riglan says, "Hello. Can you see or hear me?"

Vibrations, channelling through him; strange; then a voice, or rather, a thought... The face of the humanoid sort of ripples and vibrates as this occurs; it seems to be taking on form, starting to look like a firbolg! "Yes! Yes! Yes!" the thought says. "You travel! You seek" (there is an echo - travel, travel; seek, seek; but the echo is spoken; it's strange) "You wander into the realm of old gods" (gods, gods...) "it is not safe."

"I wander out of necessity; out of a desire to protect my world and the people within it."

"Yes. We understand. We have all done something like this before." Then Riglan realises it's not echoes; it's several similar voices, speaking sometimes in unison and other times a bit out of step. Then, "We confuse you?" and suddenly he is moving *rapidly* away from the face as the arm extends out quickly. The form ahead shimmers and changes again, melting into the purple-blue cosmos but then resembling a constellation of stars. It is far more than the druid stars Riglan knows; a whole sky of them. A great many voices are speaking, it seems!

"Are there any ways you might be able to help me?"

A chatter of voices from afar; some rise through the noise; "We have fallen. Some of us have fallen to him. Some of us have escaped him and lived full lives, but we are all touched by the taint of knowing and seeing. In this we are connected. You and us. Help you...? We can share knowledge, though... Those who channel us."

At this, four very bright stars emerge amongst the constellation. The previous Shepherds of Ilpharn. They speak; familiar voices; "We hear their cries - through you we are connected. This force of which they tell us is *truly* evil. It has no place in the world. But it is too powerful to defeat. We fear it will be your undoing. Young brother, we sense in your heart that you will not be turned from this course of action... We will guide you however we can. Those who have come before you - through you - we speak to these who have fallen in times gone by.

The noise picks up again. Perception, this is important; 8; burn inspiration; 7, fuck. 18 then. Not good enough. It's a cacophony. A force of will to try and tune out to hear the shepherds. **So, whatever it was the other voices said, Riglan did not hear**.

"You must rest now. There is much ahead of you. We will guide you how we can, but you wander into dangerous lands, uncharted territory. Beyond the borders of anything we have seen. Keep us always by your side."

Riglan sighs; "I heed the warning. I must continue, as you know; I am bound to this path, and I have agreed to it and pledged to follow it, for the Dark Powers need a way to trap Azalin. I shall keep you close."

Insight 24. Riglan starts to float back away, off the hand, retreating, the constellation starts to spread and dissipate. He sees a red star amongst them now. It pulsates. As he looks closer, focuses on it, he can't hear it; it doesn't belong. This one star does not belong. As he slowly floats towards the doorway, Riglan loudly shouts a warning - pointing the staff to the red star - "Azalin watches us!" (on a hunch). The other stars whisper and start to draw closer to it, but then the red star starts to grow, pushing the others away, closer and closer; then a voice, almost heard, whispering; **"Who searches for me?!"** - and the other stars *push* Riglan somehow towards the door, which slams shut.

Riglan wakes.

He sits up. He tries to figure out the time but can't. No references. He quietly head out into the corridor. Prik'Tak's door is ajar; Riglan knocks politely. No reply; Riglan peers around. The room is empty! Riglan tries the bathroom; he walks past another room with a small table, a lamp is on the table - Prik'Tak is there, eating snacks. He looks up startled. "Did I wake you?" "Well, no, you accidentally worried me. Long story. This staff dreams visions, prophecies - not had one for ages, a year or so. Until just then. So when I tried to find out what time it was, and saw your door open, for a minute I thought something bad had happened." "Oh, no. Sorry. It's quite early. The equivalent of about 4am? I like my snacks in the middle of the night." Riglan says, "I should sleep, but mind if I join you a moment?" "No, of course!" - Prik'Tak motions to a chair. Riglan has his own snacks but Prik'Tak offers some; and there's an exchange of food.

The dream is described. Prik'Tak suggests maybe Riglan was "Astral Walking". We're in a pocket dimension, but the mind can be projected. Perhaps he was.

Things are kicked around. Prik'Tak at one point reminds Riglan - as a librarian - that these dreams, experiences, people, places, thoughts - should be written down. Riglan hasn't been keeping his journal so up to date; he agrees, thanks Prik'Tak - he should become diligent at this again. He asks where, one day, it might be sent; Prik'Tak confesses that Candlekeep is his recommendation - not that everyone in Silverymoon would agree! Keeping dangerous knowledge separate would be wise; perhaps Riglan could just omit it, or at least put it in a separate appendix volume. Or perhaps store them here in this library; it is well protected.

Eventually we wrap up. Riglan returns to his room, creeps in and gets back to sleep.

### 8am

Everyone else wakes *before* Riglan in the morning! Riglan wakes to find Temo's bed empty and made. He gets up, packs quickly and heads towards the bathroom - he passes the table room again and, there everyone else is. Nethza offers a pastry - "Temo saved these! One for each of us." Riglan gladly accepts that. The last of Yartar.

He sits, with his pasty - Maireagh says, "You look rough!" Riglan explains the dream. At least Azalin doesn't know who is searching for him. In fact, he sounded almost surprised - though Riglan doesn't know him, so that might be a bad guess - but if so, we might be in a sense ahead of him a bit. Clearly, this is going to take all we've got. We all agree we're in this for whatever it takes - there's no point running away to a place that Azalin will only eventually destroy anyway. We might not make it home after this. Even if we do, we'll likely be changed. Not the happy-go-lucky crew we were at the start. That is our cost... But surely, if all four of us somehow make it home, it's a very low cost to pay.

"Well, we'd better arm ourselves with as much forbidden knowledge as we can!" says Maireagh. "And Yartar pastries", says Riglan. Temo raises a remainder of a croissant as if in toast.

We finish up, and head back to the library floor. **Here we go again!**

Two lines of research, we think; this library might help us find more about defences against Azalin's powers. There is also the ongoing question of ways to find out more about possible agents still here. Prik'Tak isn't sure where to start on that - it'd be a question of trying to start with his original agents, then chase descendants. Prik'Tak thinks that's more of general history, not forbidden anymore.

Since we're in this library right now, we'll look for defensive possibilities. Maireagh assists with investigation, helping Temo find books; adv investigation (14,14!)+14->28. Next, it's a question of finding useful information (arcana); Nethza helps Maireagh here - (2,17)+10->27.

* We spend the whole morning pulling together a stack of books.
* Temo uses Riglan to help fetch things where he finds them, as he runs off to find more. Maireagh and Nethza analyse the contents.
* There's no silver bullet! The list of potential dangers Maireagh drew up links to over a dozen spells and each each might have its own ward or counter, but there's no counter protecting against all.
* A Globe Of Invulnerability would provide quite wide protection but none of us can cast it. This stops direct attack spells but doesn't stop any of the minions from physically attacking.
* On extended research, **time consuming**, there are artefacts that can protect *one* person from mental effects to some degree; these are very powerful. There are accounts of them being in use.
* The artefacts are a kind of permanent version of such spells; Intellect Fortress is named, and Temo recognises it but hasn't got it learned. Maireagh could learn it and could in theory cast at a level to target two people, but then we'd have to shield her from damage - but she's our tank. She could cast it at L4 just once a day, and it's a tricky one as it's not something to cast in battle - it'll probably be too late by then! - it's more preemptive. We'd need to know in advance.
* Of artefacts closest to that, one is believed to be in the hoard of a dragon living up in the mountains - an old white - one has been stolen. Not really our wheelhouse! Otherwise, **the emperor of Calimshan owns one** (an old, rich merchant empire of the South).
* Really, the only in-battle reactive things we can think of are a literal Counterspell if it's a spell not an ability; similarly, Dispel Magic. Beyond that, something like Heroism might help against fear but little else against mind control.
* That reminds Riglan of Heroes Feast. We should buy some material components. However, many of Marieagh's list's items are charisma-related, not wisdom, so it wouldn't protect against that. A mind domination effect. Maireagh's especially vulnerable.

We might have to let that go. It's clear that these are very powerful and very rare.

### 3pm

The last thing to do, is history. We may as well spend a few hours giving it a try - see if we can find *any* agents, or lineage connections. It seems we're probably finished with the mage council library. If there's anything more about Azalin or the Netherese directly, we probably need to research that somehow in the East.

We exit the library. Outside, we get a better feel for time-of-day - it felt like much later! We need to rest, then could perhaps manage one more research slog. But we're pushing it; we're tired. Time for some top-up food and drink then.

To the Bookworm! 2sp 5cp each for the hour, 1gp for the four - stew with bread - Prik'Tak going back to his place to catch up with his partner again and also do some "rummaging around"!

* Riglan confesses being surprised; after the shock of the sad tales yesterday and the bad dream, he finds himself someone energised by the dreams being back. The shepherds speaking again. Some indication that Azalin is, perhaps, surprised, albeit alerted.
* It might be a one-way trip but we feel a little more in control and more informed than we were.
* Maireagh's concerned by the implications of Azalin being present - "I don't know if it was become it was a nightmare, or if he is actually able to inhabit the realm of dreams? We've never encountered that before."
* Riglan concedes to the worry, but mentions how that it was put to him that he must've been "Astral Walking" between planes somehow and maybe specifically the dream happening in that domain enabled that?
* "If that's true then it means he's able to somehow access the astral plane".
* "Perhaps yes; but an ability to see or traverse planes is perhaps unsurprising given what we've learned of how he was communicating across from the Shadowfell somehow..."
* "Maybe that's how he did it? Communicates with agents through dreams, or at least, the Astral Plane."

That's interesting and if Riglan dreams again, from our normal material plane, it'll be interesting to see if Azalin is part of it in any way (and Riglan must be on guard if he has the presence of mind).

This could give us a clue about research. We could look for information on creatures that innately have such abilities - perhaps they're from that plane - or powerful enough to wield magic providing that ability. It might not be dreams specifically, or just actual astral plane communication. Maireagh's theory is that he can't perhaps communicate across physical planes, but can contact the Astral; perhaps he could do that from the Shadowfell.

That gives us a choice. Astral plane research or the originally-planned historical research? Astral plane stuff might be back in the mage's guild, *possibly*, but he's not sure. "Very few people on this world possess such information" he warns. He's certainly never encountered it before. Candlekeep is his best guess - "the greatest library of the realms".

### 4pm

We decide for now to stick to "plan A" in that case, historical research. One last push for the day!

* Temo searches again. (16,1)+14->30! He starts with books from yesterday and searches "outwards" form there.
* Maireagh is good with history (+10). Riglan Helps. With advantage, nat 20! + 10 -> 30.
* A trail of books... References lead to references lead to a place, Cormyr, leads to another part of the library and so-on.
* The Cormyr reference gives us hope; records are better, less small/minor. We do find a book.
* The trail of books leads a name... **One of the generals: Dread General Goran**. A vampire. Could still be around.
* It is recorded that Goran was seen **as recently as 80 years ago, across the bay, East of Sembia** so he was not next to Azalin when Azalin was pulled to the Shadowfell. He'd been sent away on a mission. We don't know if he's still alive, but we know he *was* still on our plane.
* Accounts indicate that anyone else - a distance of many miles radius - got pulled into the Shadowfell with Azalin. No other generals are known to still be around.

So this general was on the same shore as Sembia (the stories in a book that was taken to Cormyr, copied and the copy ended up in this library). It's the same book that talked about the attack of the port cities, where the army disappeared into the ocean from the Eastern shore near Procampur, then walked submerged and re-emerged without warning a bit further north, bypassing Scardale and emerging upriver from the River Ashara to try and invade the Dalelands.

We're eventually headed roughly that way, so that's someone to try and track down.

### 8pm

Another very tiring day, but not without rewards. Prik'Tak says it's been an interesting two days with us and hopes we found much of what we were looking for; he's always found, "especially in the pursuit of knowledge, to keep an open mind. Things that might not seem especially important or relevant at the time can make sense later." He hopes he's helped us focus the research. He also warns that we not "let good writing pull you into dark times of the past, as convincing as writing can be; it is after all just writing!"

For sure. We thank him sincerely, and bid him farewell as he gets a chance to take some well-earned time off.

There's a quiet pause. What now? It feels like there are still many days until the Sembian contingent would return home. Potentially, we have time to investigate the seer too. Then Riglan exclaims, "Corunna Velaska!" - the name of the Harper agent in Silverymoon. We should pass on information if we can track him, or her down.

In the mean time, druids. We almost forgot. It's dark and the stars are out, but Riglan (exhaustion check con save nat 1+3!) is too tired. That might tie us to the city one more night, in that case. Just need a bit of food and a bed - university canteen should do it. We trudge back that way. More stairs for Maireagh.
