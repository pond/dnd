# Riglan: Part 3.11
## Day 29, mid-spring (Silverymoon 3rd day)

We awake at the university lodgings after 2 long days of research. Riglan lists 3 things he'd like to do!

* Corunna Velaska
* Thunderspells
* Druids

So we pack and head out. How on earth would we find a Harper agent? Maybe Taern might know? But that's a distraction from whatever useful stuff we might want to discuss with him if we got an audience. We're not sure where to go, so on a whim return to the city admin area where we asked to see Thunderspells originally, but this time, asking about this person's name. The investigation for this could take all morning... Temo does his thing - 17+14->31, flat roll. This isn't Lord's Alliance stuff, so we soon end up in a more general administrative quarter and work our way through helpful people that send us from place to place as we work our way towards those who have the right information.

Eventually we consult with people who look up records if businesses and residences, based on the name we have; if it's a residence, it will be tricky as they don't usually just give out information on private citizens. Luckily, they find a business owned by Corunna Velaska. A messenger service is being run out of a small courier office; we are given the address. It's on the Western side of the city in an outer suburb. We head there directly.

The name **Message To There** - curious! We go inside - a bell on the door rings. One person stands at a counter and the rest is just, well, shelves; cubby holes full of scrolls. The person behind the counter is elven; "Uuuh, good morning; one moment..." - finishes writing something, rolls it, puts it on a cubby hole and asks "...which one of you has a message?" "Actually we were looking for Corunna Velaska". "That would be me! This is my business. Who wants to know?"

Riglan shows his Enclave pin & Temo the Alliance pin. She says, "Ah! Yes. I'm aware of you. Were you followed?" "Uuh, I don't know! I don't *think* so... We weren't really checking. Sorry." "All right. Well, write down the name of two of your favourite songs on this piece of paper." She hands it to Temo. Temo writes down two his own `;-)` song titles. She rolls it up. "Thank you! Now, go enjoy the city, whatever you want, come back in half an hour - and *this* time, check to make sure you're not followed."

We understand, so head out and have to kill half an hour "sightseeing", until eventually making our way back. Riglan watches the whole time, perception 25. He notices someone who seems to be just out of his field of view constantly. Whenever he looks it's like he catches the edge of a cape. He warns the group quietly.

He waits until he sees the cape out of the corner of his eye. Riglan uses his staff for PWAT; stealth is:

* Riglan only 2,6+10 -> 16 (not good)
* Temo -> 37
* Maireagh -> 18
* Nethza -> 23

We cluster in the alley, close to a wall Temo peeks around the alleyway corner, to see if he can spot this caped figure. Someone walks around the corner, hood up and a warm cloak wrapped around them. Short - maybe 4ft 2 - looks particularly inconspicuous. So inconspicuous they are conspicuous! 180ft away, looking around; walks along the side of a building while looking around. Temo whispers that information; it'd be good to try and capture them, find out who they are; he waits to see if they keep coming this way. If not he might have to deliberately break cover to get their attention somehow.

Looks male. Halfling perhaps. Eyes darting around. He seems to find whatever he's looking forward - and how heads directly for us. "He's got our trail! I'll try Hold Person, but we might need to run out and grapple? I reckon he'll be fast..."

Riglan prepares to change into a Giant Eagle in case he needs to give chase. Maireagh's charging up her lasso. When this person is within about 20-30ft, Temo tries Hold Person. WIS 16 save... The person looks a bit surprised, almost seems to fall under, but then snaps out of it. "Dammit!" says Temo. He turns and runs. Riglan Misty Steps, then transforms into eagle to fly in pursuit. Maireagh is off on foot at full speed. Lighting Lure just misses. He's tricksy!

Riglan-eagle dives down; talon attack, 18+5; the person is very slippery, dodged a spell and the lure, but that's distracting him. He sees this eagle bearing down at the last moment. One talon misses but the other grabs the edge of his cloak. He's lifted up, bundled in the cloak! This grip won't last long. Riglan tries to get both claws on and slam the guy into the ground. Around, the crowd goes crazy - yelling and screaming - can't be helped. Temo tries again with his spell. The guy's still wriggling. "Maireagh! I can't stop him!" Nethza meanwhile uses her flying boots to move more quickly.

He tries to evade the grapple; 19 to beat from Riglan-eagle's +8 - Riglan rolls 18+8->26, lucky, he's pinned. Maireagh is close; Nethza alongside. Temo runs up and says to the guy, "We don't want to hurt you - you're following us - speak with us and go free, else pay the consequences!" - intimidation 19 total.

They're looking at us, not giving away anything from facial expressions but not giving in. Now they start to yell. "Help! Help I'm being attacked! I'm being attacked!" - and we hear the sound of running around, presumably guards or well-meaning helpers. "Let me go! I don't know you!" and Temo shouts, "Don't listen to him! He's following us, he's a bandit!" - persuasion 25 by RT. That does cast some doubt in people immediately around us.

Riglan-eagle rolls the guy a bit to pull the cloak away a bit and uses his keen eagle senses to see if he can spot anything about who this is. Perception 25. One thing he immediately detects is, no fear. Some natural poisons - a possible assassin. Smoke, too; an unusual kind; obscuring, somehow, as if part of a way to hide themselves. Cloak and clothes are very clean apart from marks made by the claws, so not an urchin or someone who travels in the wild. Definite halfling.

Maireagh's on one side of him. The dog flanks. Nethza is nearby, sword out, sheathed in booming blade. Riglan changes back to himself, hands now on the person where claws were, face close to face; athl 19. His hand's on the guy's neck but can't wriggle free. He says, "Think carefully, friend or enemy. Tell us who you are or die." The guy looks and says in a low voice, "Go ahead. Harm me, and you will never leave this city."

Guards come, shouting at us to stop. Temo heads over to the guards to show the Lord's Alliance pin and to try and convince them that we're doing legit things and wants their help detaining this person. DC is super high - around 30 - and Temo even with advantage can't make that. One guard is convinced, another isn't. Riglan's hand on the guy's throat doesn't help! "Release him at once"

Riglan overhears this, looks to the others and says "no choice, but he knows how easily we can see him now." Nethza drops her spell and the sword vanished. Riglan calls out, "I'll let go, but know this, he has poisons on him - this is an assassin - approach at your own risk!" and lets go.

We let him go. He stands, shakes himself off, yells as if he's been injured, puts on a bit of a show, limps (ha!) - but it's a fairly convincing job (D20->13 rolled, plus whatever he gets for Performance). It's a delicate situation. We have fully disarmed; the guards advance. No physical interaction needed. Two more arrive. Riglan perception 19. The guy gets to the side of one of the buildings, then makes a dash for it. Clearly not injured - Riglan shouts, "See! Look! He's not injured! He's running for it!" - the guards chase, but the long guy is long, long gone - up a tree, over to a building roof and away.

Maireagh and Nethza both immediately fly. Riglan says, "OK, fuck it - jump on!" to Temo and once again, a giant eagle; we give pursuit. The dog has to pursue on the ground; it grabs the cloak in its mouth but it's very slow; we'll have to find it later! Oh dear! Eagle adv perception (1,15)+10 -> 25; he sees the guy being *extremely* nimble, from trees to rooftops, a halfling Legolas! Then he stops briefly, turns around and flings a dagger at Nethza, closest at that point. He hits! Riglan knows it'll be poisoned; Nethza's flight falters and she comes down to land on a rooftop, but she yells out, "Don't lose him!" - Riglan caws in acknowledgement.

Temo takes aim - shouts "Fly straight!" - and fires, off the eagle. Rolls 19,20 - **crit!** - he's trying to pin this guy, not kill him and the nat 20 gives that. Straight through the lower leg and pins the guy to the top of a building, a big wooden beam running along the apex of a roof that he was running along. Riglan flies down and tries to restrain again, staying as an eagle, while Maireagh catches up and Temo shouts, "Can we get the guards attention this time, they can see we have him and they saw him run and attack?"

Silverymoon guards are agile. They're already on the rooftops. One has stopped to check on Nethza. Three more in pursuit, close by. "Do not run sir! Do not run!" and Temo yells back, "We're pinning him, but hurry!" One guard draws a longbow, holding it apparently "just in case" - it has a strange net arrow. Temo makes a mental note to go shopping!

The guy's putting on a big act about his bleeding & it being really bad. Temo medicine check 19+1->20 - he's completely putting it on. In fact, as he checks, he's very surprised - the big pool of blood isn't blood. It appears to be a blood-coloured liquid, cleverly pierced by this guy as part of the ruse. "Wow" says Temo. "This guy's legit; that's fake blood!" "No it's real! Let me go! I'm going to die! I need a healer!"

Maireagh arrives, gets in close. "You're awful!" and punches him in the face. Temo can't help but burst out laughing, against himself.

The guards make it. Temo gives them a quick summary! Fake blood, small wound, poison blade, he ran, *we're not the bad guys*. A guard pulls out some kind of metal pendant or insignia, reads it out and places it on the halfling. It turns into strange, long chains that wrap around him. "Sir, do not resist arrest! You are coming to the constabulary with us." Riglan turns back into Riglan and says, "I think the four of us should come along too, yes?" "That would definitely help!"

They pull out the arrow. More noise and complaints. Riglan says, "Ugh, by the gods..." and casts Healing Word "...stop complaining!"

He's slung over the shoulder of a guard. Temo's running back towards Nethza. We find her poisoned. "I've given her something to slow the toxin... But we must treat her" and Riglan says, "It's OK, I can do that." He leans down. "Taking one for the team again, huh?" - the guard holds the dagger and Riglan sees the blade is *very* strange. He's never seen anything like it. A totally different style, *extremely* well crafted. It's wavy in shape. Riglan casts Lesser Restoration to fix up Nethza. The wound was getting really nasty, even with the guard's attempts to heal - huge purple veins of poison had spread almost half across her body and the area looked necrotic. The Restoration fixes that colour, and he casts Healing to get her on her feet. "That is some *very* debilitating stuff. I literally couldn't continue walking - excruciating pain."

We learn that they've broken one of the most sacred rules of Silverymoon - against the use of toxins. There's an absolute ban on them. "You'll find plenty more on him - I smelt it as the eagle".

At the constabulary, the police chief notices Temo's pin, realises this is quite a big deal and requests help from the Mage's Council. "This is a diplomatic incident!" We're warning them that this is probably part of much bigger picture; be careful; don't underestimate. They throw him in a cell - Maireagh says she wants to guard the cell. Temo offers to find the dog but she assures us that "he'll find us".

Nethza pleads with the guards to investigate the dagger promptly. They won't release it as it is evidence. Riglan draws as good a picture as he can. History check with advantage, (17,19)+5->24. "Wait! We *saw* this. We saw this just yesterday!"

* It's a very old blade - Netherese. Made of Netherese steel.
* He lowers his voice and whispers that to us. "How is that *here*? Who *is* this guy? Does Azalin have agents here already?! We *must* speak to Tearn as soon as possible."

Riglan politely asks the police chief who he asked for. Just trying his luck for "as high as possible". We hope that the Lord's Alliance pin and a description of our group is enough.

Riglan confers with the party. "Not even safe here, it seems. Did he mean to just follow or to kill? And for us, or Corunna Velaska? Clearly capable of either. Don't know if you feel the same, but we had quite the good run of luck there to catch him... I just hope we can hold onto him long enough to find out something useful."

The dog turns up, cape in mouth. Good timing.

Temo is allowed to investigate the belongings - another high roll! Investigation (14,16)+14->30. There's a coin sewn into the corner of the cloak, with an insignia. Temo bursts out laughing. "If you've ever got a secret organisation, don't do dumb stuff like this!" - pointing at the coin. That said, it doesn't give much away; it's a flying snake. Yuan Ti connection in the far East? The other corner of the cape has a different colour and material coin, same insignia. There's a small pouch with another 18 tokens, too. They seem to come in 3 different colours overall, otherwise with the same emblem (albeit faint). Temo says "Oh, so, maybe not so secret after all". It's a strange, stylised emblem. He shows it to the police chief - "Ring any bells?" "I've never seen these before, but I don't deal with people who work outside the city much. We don't accept other tender, but they look like coins to me."

We don't really know who might have expertise there except perhaps Taern has he's well travelled. These aren't precious metal coins - at best, alloys of copper - so they'd be almost valueless here, so we can't - say - ask at cafes in cosmopolitan areas. People at the library might know; we could ask at the Harper network. We'll keep the police chief updated if we do find anything.

Temo also finds 3 empty vials, but they have traces of poison. We hand those over as evidence; if the poison isn't the vials, it's probably on a weapon. Two other daggers, concealed. The police chief is able to use reagents and we determine that the three vials were used for the three weapons - the big knife and these two daggers. The big knife seems to have been the worst; a paralytic poison. "Good thing we have a druid!" says Temo, pointing at Riglan.

Another dagger has a particularly banned - on the scale of nasty! - poison, that's a creeping rot. It kills slowly, over time. Systemic failure of internal organs. At this Riglan looks alarmed and runs to the cell with Maireagh. Detect Magic. This person might be undead, hiding a halfing. Magical boots though. Calls the guards - points out magic boots, probably for running; school is Illusion surprisingly. Against inevitable protests, the boots are removed. They're a form of stealth. Very useful.

Riglan tries something on a punt. He says, "We're going to send Azalin Rex right back where he came from, you know..." - insight 22. No recognition. "You won't get anything out of me, you know. I don't have any information that's going to be of use to you." Riglan asks, "Job for hire?" but he gives nothing away. We're about to leave when an officer comes along; whispers to Riglan, "Sir I think you should come look at this..." so Riglan brings the dog to accompany Maireagh, then we head back to the front desk.

More has been found! The cloak is a treasure trove. Tucked into another hidden pocket along the hem is a tiny rolled up strip of paper. Unfurled, it contains a description - that of a Tiefling with dark black eyes, pale blue skin. Describes the horn shape. **"Travels with a halfling of indeterminate age. Possibly very old but looks young." If it *does* mean Nethza, then the lack of either of us is interesting - Temo spent more time with her at the school. They're described as "Target 1" and "Target 2". "Leave no witnesses. Silverymoon."**

Temo takes a deep breath. "Well, Nethza, seems it's me too now..." At least we know it wasn't just to follow, it was to kill, and it wasn't a Harper target.

* Why not Riglan & Maireagh? Temo and Nethza spent more time together, in the school and were seen in town far more often together, but people in town definitely knew we came as a group of four.

* The age thing is interesting; do they suspect Temo is more powerful than he really is? He surprised Taern by having cast Plane Shift, albeit from a scroll. They might know he did it but not how.

More questions than answers again. But as far as the police go, Temo deliberately stirs the pot - definitely a diplomatic incident; Lord's Alliance; assassination attempt.

A middle-aged elf - late 200s? - in mage robes arrives, carrying a box, nothing else. Long, silvery-white hair, delicate diadem with 3 gems in the middle. Various rings, bracers, 3 amulets and an ornate cloak clasp with a thin silk embroidered silk cloak. Temo plays his part; looks indignant, "Someone tries to assassinate me and *you're* the highest person they send?!" "No! I am merely the protector of The Orb, *sir*" - heavy emphasis on the last word, not in a good way! He opens the box. A crystal ball. He speaks an incantation. The ball clouds over. A close eye and face of Taern. "Are you there?" - like bad Facetime.

"It's Temo!" "Oh, Temo. Yes. Hold on. Place your hand on the orb please." Temo complies. He can now hear Taern in his head. "Can you hear me?" "Yes" - good, no voice communication. Temo says to Riglan or the room in general, "We're communicating by thought now."

Temo gives a quick summary. When it comes to the coins, Taern gasps. "Tell Illuria to keep the spell going!" - he runs off - Temo says as much out loud, as muffled sounds in the background. Illuria looks frustrated for a split second. Temo then says, "Sorry about earlier, I was just trying to my luck to see if we could get to Taern. I didn't realise that you were already doing that for us." He looks and nods, but obviously can't speak.

At least a full minute passes with no sign of Taern then - "Bad news. Bad news guys! Look!" - he holds up a small notebook; a similar looking drawing of a flying snake. "Are those coins in different denominations?" Temo says, "Three colours for three different copper alloys." **"That, I believe, is how the Zhentarim are paid."** Temo shouts loudly over his shoulder down the corridor, "Maireagh! He's Zhentarim!" and there's a distant commotion as Maireagh starts swearing. Taern continues above the noise, "You have a mark on you. Do you know who his targets were?" "Me and Nethza." "Is there any reason why someone who's looking for Nethza might also be looking for you?" He can't think of one. Reasons for Nethza are many, but reasons for him? "Perhaps the Lord's Alliance thing?" "I wish you no offence, but there are other targets in the Lord's Alliance - why have *you* specifically been targeted? Can you think of anything else that links the two of you together but not the other two? Is there anyone who is only aware of the two of you and not the other two? Or any reason why they might be aware of only the two of you?"

Temo thinks hard. History 19+4, another good roll! 23. There's never been a time he can think of when it was *just* him and Nethza, at least in the company of people that haven't also met, before or after, others. So that's not the reason.

Temo: "Not that I can think of. There must be another reason. Another link; I'm certain."

"Worrying... For that reason will probably be quite crucial to unravelling this mystery and understanding the threat that you face and where it comes from. But if the Zhentarim have been then whoever wants the two of you dead has very powerful means and is not afraid to use any means necessary."

Temo thinks for a minute then says, "You're both helpful and reassuring in equal measure!"

But we know at least - it's not the Zhentarim, directly. It's someone who hired them. There's not going to be any way that the person in the cell knows who it was.

Either way, this person will be detained, tried and imprisoned - "two counts of attempted assassination and banned toxins". Good enough for us. But we need to find out who. Before the crystal ball connection is lost, Temo asks if we can meet Taern before we leave town - find out what he's learned, tell him what we've learned and tell him where we're headed next. He thinks a while, then says, "Very well. I will meet you at the library tonight, midnight." "Which library?!" "The mages" "Thank you. Have a good afternoon!" **Seems like the safest place he can think of and the only time he can spare.**

And that's that. Temo fills us in, quietly. Riglan says, "Well, divination for me has been hit and miss but it's always been about the question. This time, the question seems quite clear... Let's find a church".

We thank the police and head out. We find a temple to an ancient Elven pantheon of three deities that form a single unit of worship. Riglan doesn't know it well, but we head in. Riglan enquires politely about two things - donations and blocks of incense. "We'll happily take donations of time. We do not require any money. But we are always accepting donations of time... Supplicants can come and commune with the gods, and help us out here at the temple. They tend to be for periods of time that we measure neatly as one cycle of the sun." A year! Riglan says, "Regrettably, we could not at this time commit to such a thing. But perhaps one day.". "What is it you seek?" "Permission and small space for a form of divination, for we were attacked today and want to find out why." "Who do you commune with?" and it's a good question. "We suspect you don't commune with the elven gods!" Riglan nods, "That's true, I find I seem to end up talking with the gods most connected with the location I am in when I try the ritual." "Then we suggest you commune with Silune, the patron goddess of Silverymoon." "Oh! I see." The point us in the direction of the temple, up on a bare hill surrounded by beautiful silver elms. There is a beautiful domed temple atop, with open colonnades. "The temple is always manned, but they advise that all religious activity happens when her symbol is visible in the sky."

OK so we're getting a rather tight timing list here:

* Harpers now
* Silune when the moon's up
* Druids ASAP after
* Midnight (vital) for Taern

Back to **Message To There** - cautiously! No following. Corunna Velaska has already heard. The commotion on the street - news travels fast! "Are you OK?" We get up to speed. Our main aim here is to bring the Harpers up to date as best we can. In particular we note things like raising the dead - put guards on the graveyards?!

"Is there anything else that I can do for you, to help you? Any message that you would like passed to anyone?"

Temo says, "there's someone called Qelline. I hope you can't find her. But if you *can* find her, tell her Temo and everyone are doing fine, stay strong, it'll be a while yet, but we look forward to coming home." "Where shall we start looking for her?" "Neverwinter." "Not a problem. We have plenty of eyes and ears in Neverwinter. Consider it done. Take care of yourself and be ever-vigilant." Before we leave, she hands Temo a small silver bell in a little box. He looks quizzical. "This will work once and only once. Speak this word (she shows an Elvish word) and, until the next time that your life is under threat, this bell will act as a sentinel. A guard - for you." (It will ring in warning - against ambush).

### 11:30am

We check the position of the sun. It's surprising; not even midday. An eventful morning! It seems like we're just killing time for a while - there must be *something* we can do; we figure we might as well ask at the Silune temple about the time of moonrise.

The grounds of the template are beautiful. Ivy grows up the columns. There's a big pool, apparently decorative? There's a big dome above it, but it's incomplete, with a large section missing. We ask around and find out that moonrise is early than we would expect - 3pm today. Not bad. Riglan asks in advance about permission to perform his ritual; they require a piece of moonstone shaped like a disc as part of their own side of the ritual they say they need to perform, in order for him to perform his own. In fact this means Riglan won't cast a ritual at all; they will. They can sell such a disc; Riglan buys one - 100gp. Expensive compared to 25gp of incense, but it seems worth it. It's a beautiful moonstone disc, almost see-through, very well crafted.

Since we're talking about spell components - do they know where we might find valuable gem-encrusted bowls? "Funny you should ask!" - they have one themselves. It's very expensive... 1000gp. OK, well... That's what we need. They only have one. One will do. "This was sold to us by the druid circle out of town". We fork over an additional 100pp. The workmanship is druidic! It does seem a shame to consume such things with spells.

We think about food, reluctant to ask and they overhear our discussion. We're told that fruit trees are planted in their groves; we're welcome to contemplate, meditate and eat the fruit in their grove if we wish. No charge. Riglan's feeling a bit distant and detached, so this sounds good. He thanks them and we head to grove; Riglan finds food for us easily. The fruit trees here are quite beautiful. Apples and pairs are predominant for mid-spring, and even a few last-of-winter berries.

"Temo! Look what I found!" says Maireagh, hugging a massive watermelon. "Share it with me?" "OK!" - she slices it up. Chunks of it are wider than Temo's head.

Riglan is with Nethza. "I thought I just had *you* to worry about"; he's looking at Temo. There's a heart to heart. Perhaps this comes from the Shadowfell? "The great philanthropist and businessman Temo Smoothhands"? After a while he realises that Nethza has fallen asleep! Leant against him. She's breathing; he figures it's just her body fighting off the last of the poison. He sits still so as not to disturb her, deep in thought. Con save 16, he feels itchy but resists the temptation!

During the downtime Riglan does some revision of "Primer On The Eastern Empires", also reviewing map drawings and things for the forthcoming cloudflight. He also updates his journal.

Maireagh wants to borrow the map book - Riglan is mostly working off his own drawings from the library so he passes it on. Temo continues looking at his Statecraft book! He figures it might be more important than he'd originally thought.

Nethza wakes, then moves to a tree and sits underneath it. Her amulet is in her hand and she's got her Raven Queen book open. Perhaps she's trying to find a way to talk to her. Riglan calls over softly and says, "Maybe in your dreams, too?" "I don't dream! I haven't since I left the Shadowfell. And my dreams there weren't really dreams anyway. And before that - well, I stopped having nightmares after we all met up." "No dreams is better than a nightmare!" concedes Riglan.

### 3pm

We back to the temple to have them start the ritual. In fact it's cast as a spell, which only takes a minute to cast. The disc they use fits perfectly into a place in the middle of the big pool. It turns a dark purple/black as the spell completes, the disc shimmering like a moon in the centre. "What is the connection between Nethza and Temo that caused someone to hire the Zhentarim to assassinate them both?"

The pool clouds. It swirls, smoky; the moonstone disc disappears from view; then it starts to shine again, but on the surface of the water as if, now, a reflection of the moon itself. There's a voice in Riglan's head. Gentle, sounds feminine - maybe. "The connection is not of this world. The connection spans time. The connection is a connection of perception and awareness. They are not linked. They are separate. But they both come from the same place - beyond the corners of this world. That which seeks to destroy both views one as a threat and the other with anger and fury at its interference. These are long-held grudges. I sense this desire for revenge spans centuries."

The spell ends. Riglan just looks confused. He's been writing down as fast as he can and finishes the notes, then reads them back. As best we can surmise:

* Definitely Shadowfell
* Azalin; centuries referring to our time jumps *there* - about 4, by our reckoning
* Temo must be the interference
* But that means **Nethza is the threat**.

That's entirely at odds with the soul theory, unless - as Nethza points out - that her *death* is required to release the soul fragment. But (says Maireagh) that can't be, because we think his original plan was to put her on the throne? BUT - that is also a weak theory now. That might've only been Avacyn. "Does Azalin know that Temo rescued Nethza? That would be the interference? "That was at our farthest point back" adds Temo. "Yes, so then we disappeared for hundreds of years. So then he had to escape without reclaiming his full power. So he knew we'd come after him - he was *counting* on us coming back to this plane, so he could finally have a second go at trying to get to Nethza."

Well, if we're right, that means Nethza's threat is being alive. But in that case - just wait another century. She's not immortal. "Unless there's a particular process involved in reclaiming that soul - such as using a Netherese blade..." says Maireagh.

"So" says Riglan. "All I have to do is murder Nethza with a normal weapon? Problem solved?" and growls at her with his Primal Savagery. Everyone else just groans and rolls their eyes.

The priests - being discrete as they can, but somewhat wide-eyed - ask if we got the answers we sought. "I think so... Yes, in a way." They also say, "Silune reflects back to us who we are, when we look at the mirror of our lives through the stark truth of the night sky in the pool. She is not known for being literal. She is figurative. One can always sense the intent of what she says beyond the mere words used to express it. Peace be with you and may you find your peace."

(With this, Riglan, insight 19+10->29. Things fall into place. During the earlier meditation in the grove, speaking to Nethza and considering if it was what happened there that 'marked' Temo, he'd already been on the path. Perhaps Silune was talking to him the whole time. We don't know because we didn't ask *why* Nethza is a threat to Azalin or what kind of threat she is; but we know a lot more about Temo and the bigger picture.)

We're led away from the chamber and, in due course, depart.

Riglan, as we depart, checks in with Temo - as he's been doing with Nethza. Temo is actually almost relieved. He really was the only one in the room with Nethza at Madam Bela's. And he says, moreover, Azalin Rex is clearly *not* omniscient. He wasn't watching us - at any time. He doesn't know about Maireagh and Riglan - he knows only about Temo because he's been told about him by people like Madam Bela.

**So between Riglan's dream and this, we know Azalin is no god. He's not infallible.**

(Quietly, trying to keep his ego down, Temo is pleased that he reckons he's had a part in helping protect and hide - even if by accident - Riglan and Maireagh.)

### 4pm

Riglan figures that druids are next on our strange to-do list, but that can only happen after dark. That said, it's quite a long way - we figure maybe several miles - so we elect to walk; we were given details at Scribe Stop, so we should be able to navigate. It might take until darkness.

In practice, we find a path through the forest as we're leaving the city limits. It saves a lot of time. Clearly, this is a place that's frequented by people from the city. Navigation isn't difficult either as a result. Quite a difference from Riglan's forest home.

### 5:30pm

After an hour and a half we're climbing up a steep trail surrounded by trees, heading up a hillside more or less directly - no switchbacks - with occasional views back towards the city and across the early sunset, mostly-in-shadow valley. We can't *see* a circle but we just have to trust things. Finally, the path curves back on itself a bit and in fact heads up even steeper. There's a change in feel - as if we've moved from hill to mountain. Soon enough we get glimpses through gaps, seeing multiple ridges - and amazingly there is a *sign* in druidic, carved into the rocks! **Silverstone Circle**.

The trees start to thin out and the stone circle becomes visible, a top a natural ridge with a flat top. It's not a plateau but level enough to make a true stone circle. The stones glint strangely in the late sunset light. Riglan notices that plants become magically enriched and feels a calm in the area - a pattern to chaos - with a wildness and barrenness, out on the ridge with wind blowing across. It's unmistakably druidic. There are just low shrubs now, tussock, at this altitude. It's been a tough climb.

Up close, we see that the stones are 15-18ft tall and the glinting is from strong veins of what appears to be actual *silver*, which is quite remarkable. The stone looks to be the same thing as the mountains, so these mountains must have valuable riches - for those who value such things. Yet, they are not mined; another bone of contention between dwarves and elves perhaps?

Riglan perception only 10+3. There seems to be nobody here. A few animals. Rabbits munch on flowers near the stones. Riglan says hello to one (in Rabbit). It looks up and says, "Hello!" also in Rabbit. Ah. Just a rabbit. He asks Temo if he can find anyone! Investigation, 19+14 -> 33! Strangely quiet. Animals aren't scared. Footprints, but strangely - they lead to the stones. He wanders over. The footprint ends facing the stone; another faces away, as if a portal. He calls Riglan over and Riglan knocks on the stone, like a door! "Hello?!" - Temo meanwhile finds similar in-and-out footprints on almost *all* of the stones.

Knocking reveals nothing much; pushing a hand against it - it's a rock. Riglan, Arcana 16; he senses magic and feels that if he maybe speaks to it might help. So he tries again, saying more loudly and directly at a specific rock - "Hello! My name is Riglan - I am a druid, and I would like to meet the people of this circle!"

There's a shimmering; a face appears, quite creepy for a moment but then sort of normal; a dwarf appears. He calls out "It's alright guys!" and even walks over and bangs on a few rocks - more people appear. Riglan recognises a spell that perhaps is similar to his earth melt, but perhaps more of the "hide in rock" variety. He thinks he probably knows it but hasn't ever used it.

"Oh. You're a druid? Ah! You're a firbolg!" "We've never had firbolg up here before" - and so-on. Five of them.

* Dwarf
* Two scruffy-looking humans
* Small kind of feral-looking halfling (!) (a Ghost Tree halfling, technically)
* Maybe a large goblinoid of some kind - not as fierce as a bugbear, maybe a hobgoblin

Riglan introduces his party, and briefly describes his circle (such as it is) and association with Goldenfields. They say they tend to be busy with protecting the forests - and the mountains. The dwarf steps in; that's where the protection comes from - he stops his people from mining. "Nothing good has ever come of delving under mountains. We should really leave things be."

Of course, we have a mine; Riglan is honest and says that we don't necessarily align. He argues that mining for greed alone, things without utility but some perceived value, is perhaps bad. But "that's a value system" responds the Dwarf; true. If the silver in the mountains, imagine what Silverymoon would be like! Huge, bustling, trade, commerce, industry. Almost impossible to protect the forest. Riglan *totally* gets *that!*.

We get to business. Riglan talks of the dark rising in the East. They are the watchers; they use the plants and speak to animals to keep an eye on things; perfect - they need to be alert. The city does speak highly of them - they can alert each other to anything unusual. But we move to tackle this - we have maps, but they are not accurate; land navigation will be inaccurate; can they offer assistance via the stars?

The male halfling is **Xarasta** and the one of the humans, a woman, is **Tiriel**. They have wandered far and can try to teach us at least some basics! But that requires full dark; it's not dark enough yet. Perhaps food first? We agree! We can share.

The bugbear-goblinoid-creature changes a little, into even more of a bear - for strength, it seems (a manifestation of Enhance Ability) - moving some large stones around to form a set of seats. Others produce food; hot rocks are used; we share some of our fresh food from the chest.

There are questions all around. They are curious about our travels, and Firbolgs. We explain all we can. The conversation reaches the Shadowfell. We do our best to explain - and Riglan does *not* pull his punches with any of the gross stuff, the distortions and unnatural alterations of creatures. It helps them understand what they are facing.

### 7pm

In due course, it's dark enough. The goblinoid stands. "Stand back a bit!" - he transforms into an Earth Elemental this time. "Circle of the moon", thinks Riglan. In this form he can level the earth; he flattens the centre of the circle, so that within its centre, there's a flat plinth - a disc - of perfectly flat stone, slightly raised from the more natural, ragged surface outside it, where the main stones stand.

The two travellers move into the circle and their bodies turn translucent! Points of light appear on them; eventually their whole bodies look like the night sky. Constellations light up, clearly visible. They touch the stone disc and this starts to populate with a copy of the sky above.

They start to talk to us about how things look and move across the sky, using the easier-to-see things on the disc, which we can then relate into the sometimes harder-to-spot (dimmer) stars in the sky. They insist that in the Anauroch - and they've been! - it's the only way to travel. It's featureless but, more importantly, it's far too hot to travel during the day. Only at night.

As they discuss all this, they have a crystal disc and they inscribe points of light, these constellations, into it. It's a star map, which we understand now, because it's been built up and explained in front of us. It's very delicate, personal and in many ways very beautiful.

Riglan realises that this is a source of their power. To be crafted such a thing is very significant. He says, "I don't really know what you could possibly give you in return!" "Come back, and tell us what you have achieved; or warn us to save those around. That is what we ask. If you come back this way with ill tidings, help us defend this ancient and beautiful forest." Riglan nods and can truthfully say, "Yes. With my life."

The disc is handed over.

All four of us have an understanding of it. We cannot be lost in the desert - or at least, we can determine our direction. It's also a wake-up call about what clothing, camping, shelter we might need. It's not just "you have fur so you won't get sunburned" - it's clearly hotter than we ever imagined, and more hostile and difficult. "Featureless", they say; they even warn; and the terrain arounds us changes, because sand dunes are not stationary. They can shift by the minute, and certainly overnight. The ground has no reliable landmarks.

Riglan mentions that, if all else fails, they could skywrite. They ask what kind of signs he can use; giant eagles, roosting in these mountains, are known to them and fly far when they hunt, so they could keep watch. Owlbear Keep has a crest, so Riglan decides upon a druidic runes for Owlbear. If they see a sky message with such a rune pair, stylised as it is especially, they'll know it's us.

It seems almost inadequate to just thank them, but all that's all we can really do. We hang out until a little before 10pm, so we all get to know each other quite well.

### 10pm

We have to head back to meet Thunderspells. We wave goodbye and head back down the hill. A star map *and* advice. And an obligation, of course; return here!

We've been given information on a way down the valley that's a bit quicker and, besides, it is downhill. We have a bit of time to spare before our midnight meeting. Temo can use the Alliance pin to get through into the main area, but we can't *enter* that tower and wait outside.

Time passes

### Midnight

A mist starts to form, then coalesces into a strange shimmering portal. Taern - Thunderspells emerges. "Ah! Punctual!" "Greetings. We appreciate the meeting".

Without needing any kind of amulet, Taern creates a disc out of nothing, no amulet needed, to take us up to the tower top like before; and we're led rapidly into the library itself. He says he's not had dinner yet, and tho we have we don't mind snacking. There's a dining room / kitchen, where he rummages around while muttering absent-mindedly.

We tell him as much as we can about what we've learned. Then Riglan very awkwardly tries to say - well, I mean, this is nice and all - but does he *have* something that can help?! Taern is surprised; he figured knowledge was the key; but we didn't know what to ask for without. In terms of protection, all he can offer is something risky and powerful - transpires, a Wish spell.

He describes how it can change reality. "But that's just *wrong*" says Temo, shocked. We've seen such consequences in the Shadowfell. It's so tempting - right a wrong, fix the domain, undo a mistake; but that's what we warned against. The temptation. Even Riglan concurs. It's very generous, super powerful, this is the level to which Silverymoon would assist; but we can't take it. Too risky, too dangerous for others to steal, too hard to know when to use it.

That's the thing with magic, says Taern; unless you fear no death - like our adversaries so often do not - you don't have enough time to ever be free of the doubt about *when* is the right time to use power.

He asks if there's anything else he can do for us - even advice?!

We say - protect this place. Silverymoon is impressive; don't let Azalin tear it apart. He agrees, obviously! He asks where we're headed next; Evereska we think. He can send us there! Wow. Right now? Yep! But we have to go to his tower. We thank him, obviously! Also ask if not too much trouble - let Nivellin, Admission's Officer at the Silverymoon university know we've had to leave late and in a hurry; thank her for her hospitality; yep, no problem.

Once out of the library demiplane, he creates a small portal that whisks us to the ground floor of his tower. This guy doesn't like walking! There is a special room, he says, for the portal for Evereska. We reach the room up some stairs; it's a teleportation circle with some runes pre-drawn. Taern consults a book and starts filling in runes.

Eventually he speaks.

"Keep a clear mind in the days to come; a stout heart; and a steady soul. I will see you all soon."

The last rune is drawn. Air shimmers; misty; a soft glowing light spins around us; then we're Elsewhere. There isn't even a feeling of imbalance or other shifting. Completely transparent. *That* - if nothing else - gives us an insight into his true power.



## Day 30, late spring, Evereska - at least 1-2 hours ahead of Silverymoon
### Around 3am

Bone white painting, beautiful delicate filigree architecture - and a very surprised brown-skinned elf who jumps to their feet! "Oh! Oh goodness! Who - who are you?!"

We try to explain. He's worried because there's nobody else around... Does he trust us? Will we come back tomorrow to register?! Of course - but - where can we stay? It's 3am. He says there's an inn/tavern open - but it's of... A certain kind... to be open at this time. Nethza understands - it's fine. We give him our names on paper and promise we'll be back. He gives us directions - we are in the Hall Of Records right now. Temo listens and it sounds easy enough. **The Mirage**.

We are thankful and apologetic in equal measures. We *will* be back. He shows us out; we're taken down some stairs of this stone building, but painted in this strange pale colour. The main door is locked and barred inside, so he undoes all that and lets us out. Riglan turns - "what time tomorrow?" "We open at 9".

We walk out into a square. It's small but really interesting. It's colder, mountain air. Moonlight lets us see beautiful, snow-capped peaks glistening all around. Riglan says, "I thought this area was hot!" but it seems this city is built within these tall mountains. Temo suggests that it perhaps gets hot during the day, despite the tall mountains looking cold at altitude.

The city is on multiple levels. Riglan points and says, "look Maireagh, more stairs!" chuckling. She's unimpressed and a bit cranky - it's very late, we're tired. Temo says, "Don't worry. I know where to go". He leads the way.

We start to feel that this isn't a city so much as a town and is a *real* mix of architectural styles. Elven style, Dwarven style and strange exotic minaret spires, then big blocky stone keeps protruding out of the mountainsides. It seems that there's *no* "human" feel here at all. Riglan finds it curiously disorientating as all the bigger towns and cities have had a common "human" sort of navigation and pattern to them that's entirely absent here. Fortunately, Temo seems unphased and it only takes about 3 minutes to cross the square, make our way down to the next block, get past a minaret that was mentioned and - there it is, the only building currently lit up.

We approach and enter The Mirage. It has an illusion above the building! Some kind of permanent incantation; strange, expensive probably! It's a shimmering oasis. We don't really know about mirages other than what we read in the libraries, so wonder if it's an accurate depiction.

The entrance is to stairs, which head down; the building climbs down a hill over several levels. It's *not* raucous or rowdy. People drink quietly in circular banquette seats. There's a sweet herb smoke smell. Some people sip some kind of tea out of brass cups. Others drink a dark red liquid - wine? - from crystal glasses. It's kind of hushed and intimate. People glance at us but then look away.

A half-elf greets us, wearing a rather decorative headdress and a beautiful brocade robe. We are welcomed. "Are you here for a drink, contemplation, a shared room for smoking...?" We look confused; "...or a room to sleep in?" Yes! That. We're OK with one room. Perhaps it's wiser, in view of events past, to keep together and not split up; especially now we're that much closer we think to - *him*.

She seems a bit embarrassed about the room cost for the 4-bed but we're just tired and Riglan simply goes, "not a problem" before she's even mentioned price! 3gp. Well, in fact, that's fine, even if obviously expensive by other standards.

We're led down various stairs and corridors. We're on the side of the hill, we now see, with rooms jutting out of terraces. We have one at the end of a hallway - no neighbours. Riglan's thought processes aren't what they once were - his first thoughts are "Defensible. Tucked into a hill. Good."

There's a window that's long but not tall, only maybe 2ft tall, carved into the stone. A sort of panoramic view. It has lots of little opening glass panes. Well, at least a taller person would struggle to enter quietly that way, thinks Riglan. Cushions on the floor; seems that might be how people here like to sit, rather than chairs. There's a separate room with curtains. It's big in all. "This is great, thank you!" says Riglan.

"Have a good sleep. If you need the water warmed it can take a while, but otherwise there's spring water that flows in the bathroom area. It's safe to drink."

Interesting comment - we realise we shouldn't take access to water for granted anymore.

Riglan says, "Well, here we are - new place Maireagh! - but she's looking out of the window, not really listening. "You have to dome and look!" she says. We do. It looks South. There's a bit of mountain in front on either side, but we look in the middle out and beyond - and realise we're really high up. Rolling hills, forests and planes. Off to the left, East, vegetation turning to scrub under the moonlight and a harder to make out, almost fuzzy area that we suspect is the desert itself.

We must be a few *thousand* feet up. Very high. We realise now that the snow caps are probably closer than we thought; hard to judge distance in the moonlight.

Temo says, "Well, this is impressive, but it's stupid-o-clock and I'm about to fall over. The bed looks good. I'll see you in the morning!"

Maireagh says, "Doggie; keep watch!" - and it does. Riglan figures that it's *probably* safe for tonight - surely Azalin can't have tracked us here already; he sleeps.

### Day 30 continued, 10am

We have a lazy slow startup in an unusual "time zone" - daybreak is earlier than expected but the curtains are good. We spend an hour with breakfast on our own resources, then figure we should get the Hall Of Records done, *then* explore. We're going to need advice, clothes, maybe a tent, who knows - desert survival is not our forte!

Riglan spends a bit of time thinking of his spells and swaps Transport Via Plants for Wind Walk.

Riglan's looking out the window at the now brightly-lit view, paying particular attention to where the desert seemed to be. It's still not clear; the sun rises on that side. He turns and says "It's just sort of hit me... We're *really* far from home. This is the furthest I've been ever, further than I really knew there even was until recently. And we got here by magic but it'll take *months* to get back" - looking at Nethza as he says that, almost as if it's a question - implication, does teleport work that far? Nethza says she doesn't know - we've never tested it! "In theory we should be able to go just about anywhere in the same realm... I knew we couldn't teleport from the Shadowfell, because I tried! It doesn't work."

Riglan talks of the world seed. It talks, after a fashion; very strange. It's aware of him, and he of it. He's been distracted often by thoughts of where it should be planted, or if, or left with someone for safety - he's too young, surely! - and now, though, here we are; far East. If he falls, he always thought at least the seed might grow as he returns to the earth. But if he falls *here*, especially in the desert, it won't grow at all... Even more reasons we must succeed!

If he falls and any of his party live, he asks that they promise to take the seed and do their best to make it safe, take it West; they agree.

### 11am

We leave the room. The Mirage is quiet during the morning - more of a low-key coffee shop. As we're leaving, they ask if we want to keep the room; Riglan agrees even though he's not sure and pays 3gp.

Now we head to the Hall Of Records. Outside, we see clearly that we're in a strange valley, on a sort of raised mesa in amongst other mountains. There are hills throughout the valley, though it's very elevated; so "valley" is relative! It's at least low enough to be forest.

We see the architecture more clearly now. There are much more obviously Elven structures rising above the shrub line in the town. Dwarven structures are attached to the mountains. Then there is this exotic, third type; gently twisting spires, "onion bulb" tops, bone white painting on the base buildings. The ornamentation is interesting; much of it is based on patterns made by cut-outs, so parts of the building can be seen through as if using many tiny windows; there are also lots of decorations formed from coloured ceramic tiles. A lot of artistry.

We're being observed as we walk around town. Most residents are the kind of brown/olive-skinned elf that we've already met. Some have a more golden-coloured skin; there are also here and there dwarves, much fewer though. While keeping an eye out around us, we continue on a bee-line to the Hall.

It's quite a beautiful building by day. There is an almost bulbous base in the main building, two levels, with another one of those towers rising above; it's almost organic. The roof just sort of merges into the tower - it's not an obviously separate structure.

We enter; a half-elf there looks surprised. "Oh! Welcome... To Evereska... How did you arrive?!" Riglan tries to explain the stupid-o-clock arrival. They seem quite surprised and also act low-key (via passive insight) as if there's some rather significant problem with it all, but *say* that registration is simple. And, indeed, that part is - the questions are easy enough (names, reason for being here). But then it gets a bit harder - how do we even *know* Evereska exists? Why are we here?

We learn that we're the first outsiders here in about three *years*. They explain that people do come in and out of the city; there's some trade; some people know of it, or come as pilgrims. But the people that do so are the same people who've come for decades and in some cases even live in this city part-time, unless trading elsewhere. None of them are "outsiders", really - until us.

They also mention in passing that this place is old enough - a last refuge of the elves during the Retreat - those who decided not to retreat to Evermeet stayed; it dates back to the last pact between elves and dwarves. This city is thousands of years old! And what's more, as a result, it has its own Mythal protection.

**Riglan briefly in private confers with his party; are we putting this city at risk just by being here?!**

They ask if they can help with whatever we want. As far as we can see it probably doesn't bear any direct relevance to us. Insight 23 - they're very cut off. Big libraries are unlikely and, even if there, likely to be very disconnected. So Riglan says, "Principally, since we intend to travel the desert..." and asks about appropriate equipment.

They can show us the way down secret paths of the mountain and to the Eastern flank; and there, there is a settlement called **Megjuba**. The people there are people of the desert. Those are the people we should ask for equipment or help. That sounds ideal! We're very thankful and ask when this might happen? They can get someone to lead us out to the "Eastern stairs" in a couple of hours or so. We meet back here; we also offer to pay for the services, but they say there's no need. It's mostly a question of the access, they say, going through a territory controlled by a particular family so that family provides the guide who they must now fetch.

We head out. Temo dashes off to the Mirage to let them know we won't need the room after all. To his surprise they insist on repaying the 3gp. We also get given information on where to find things that need "higher" civilisation:

* Riglan tops up a couple of blocks of incense for divination spells.
* We top up our fresh food in the chest of preserving along with a fair chunk of regular rations, as Riglan won't be doing any foraging in the desert!
* (Maireagh says she'll teach Temo her Alarm spell for his spellbook, freeing her up to be able to produce water and maybe food for us).
* Temo gets a hefty well of gem-infused ink for spell transcription - 100gp!

### Just after midday

We leave the ink shop. The valley shadows have shifted now, and we find ourselves stood near a higher street with stairs leading both up and down to other parts of the city, on another small mesa of sorts, above the level of the Hall Of Records. We realise this is perhaps a city and not a town, reversing what we'd guessed before; it's just that a lot of it is hidden in these various steps and elevations.

There's an hour to kill. A grand older tower of Elven architecture catches our eye and we head towards it. "The Hall Of The Hill Elders", set - we see upon approach - set into beautiful gardens with, Riglan can tell, very old twisted stone pines, many hundreds of years old. It even looks like some of the buildings have been built around trees to help keep them supported. This is certainly the grandest building we've seen.

It's quiet, overall, in this town. No street traders. No carts we've seen, not even horse-drawn carts moving things just around the town. There are also more artist outlets, scribe studios and so-on. It seems to primarily create art! This leads us to wonder about things of interest for Maireagh. Not "on mission". There's an historic connection here, between elves and dwarves, cut off; not lost. The Hall ahead, thinks Temo (investigation 24) should have important family names and histories.

History only 13, for Riglan; some of the names must be significant since they seem to have made it into common language but he recognises little else. There's a mural on the entranceway, with just one other person, an elf looking at these things too. Four layers, one atop the other. One shows an exodus of elves, the tower we are in very identifiably included, mountains around; people there waving, as if a tearful goodbye. Above, some people returning and people of Evereska with open arms to receive them. On the third, weird misshapen, almost-demonic creatures emerging from the desert. The first two murals showed no desert, we realise, but this does. The creatures seem to climb out of the ground and besiege the area. Elven knights, double blades drawn, defend the ring of mountains; dwarven refugees flood into the area. In the middle an elf and dwarf shake hands. No dates. Riglan clears his throat and asks the other elf who is looking, "excuse me, do you know the date this shows? How many years ago?" "Oh! Good day... No, it doesn't show the date... That would be during the fall of the Dulzoon, the last of the..." - and notices Maireagh is there - "...the end of the Dulzoon empire, the last of the Dwarven empires before they left the surface".

Maireagh is surprised at that 'left' reference. "It is only what I read! You could ask dwarves here as they are direct descendants. It is my understanding that after the empire's fall, under constant attack from orc and giant, that dwarves went underground. They always had cities there but also lived above; but they left the surface, as it was easier to defend below. This was before the Drow wars, of course." Maireagh says that this history is not well recounted in current Dwarven society to the West.

So, we look at the top mural. A dome over Evereska is being repaired by mages. Lands to the West are shown as being separated by a shroud of mist and snow. It implies isolation from the West, but the Mythal is being repaired and looks like there is a defensive position against the East - where a flying city is shown. Ah! Netherese! And clearly, an aggressor from Evereska's perspective. Legions of armies in lands below fight a battle. There is the same feeling and implication of a refuge, too, with people shown escaping into the city for protection. The stonework here is fresher; clearly this is a newer mural, maybe only 100 years, but *surely* that means it was drawn centuries after the Netherese cities fell? Or is there an implication of a *second* Netherese empire?

We ask our new elven friend about that, too. "Ah! I was alive for *that*. It was merely 50 years ago. One flying city came back and re-appeared over the Anauroch Desert. We had to revive the city of Myth Dranor in Cormanthor as that was the old Elven fortress against the Netherese. They are far to the east, but Evereska served as a last lie of defence to protect against - forgive my use of words! - the young nations to the West who had never encountered the Netherese before. under no circumstances were the Netherese to cross beyond the desert. We were responsible for holding that line. The nation of Cormyr fought bitterly against the Netherese, especially after it had conquered Sembia and The Vast. The Netherese city had apparently escaped destruction during collapse of their empire because it was another plane, and it only returned about 120 years ago. I was younger then, but I do remember it."

"Not something I imagine you'd easily forget!" says Riglan.

"No! It was 60-odd years of struggle in these Eastern provinces. Evereska was stretched thin; our resources were strained. It was a time of great suffering and sorrow, but the population of Evereska doubled in that time. Many who are here now are either survivors or descendants of those refugees from the East. It changed our population make-up significantly. For the first time, Elves were no longer the majority."

Temo, wide-eyed says "So the West owes you all *huge* debt and we don't even seem to know it!"

"Correct. And that is our preference!"

"Why?!"

"Because the empires of the West are barely a millennia old. They are but children! They possess not the means to tackle such an ancient foe. I would hardly imagine anyone in the West had memories of the last time the Netherese empire existed. It fell to the older kingdoms of the East, bastions like ours, to hold them back."

"That I certainly understand, but why keep it hidden? Why not at least let them be aware you'd helped?"

"What is there to be gained from that? How could that assist anyone?"

Temo thinks - "Well, it feels like we *owe* you something. A debt. It should be paid. But I realise you can't exactly walk over to the West, insist you saved them all and ask for recompense!"

"That is not in our nature. We have no need of anything. If we require anything, we trade with the Eastern nations."

Riglan pipes up, "I think some of the West are aware and are also aware of how unprepared and too young their nations, peoples and leaders are. Netherese information - especially about their magical abilities and artefacts - is largely forbidden, or certainly at least restricted, for fear of the damage it could do in the wrong hands."

"Well, that would be wise, though perhaps a bit controlling?"

"Sadly, there is much of that in the West."

Then she pauses. "Where are my manners? I should introduce myself! I am **Aelaris** of the **House Of Kalinoth**.

Riglan adv history, 23. A pang of recognition. He reaches in the bag of holding for a diary - a journal... The queen. Air cult! They have the journal. Riglan visibly blushes as he's checking it and says, "well, this is - this is really awkward - but is probably yours... But you might not like what it says..."

He hands over the journal. Her face instantly turns red. The air around us gets warm! Then it calms. "This is my sister! She has always had a troubled childhood. She was prone to delusions. When we were young, she was a compulsive liar. She left, having stolen a significant portion of the family fortune - but this was decades ago. How did you come upon this journal?"

Riglan has to confess; she led the cult; she died - at our hands.

"Was she unreachable?" "We did try. We *did*. With all of them. But there was nothing we could do." "I saw this in dreams... Even as children. She used to scare me."

She closes the journal and hands it back. "Well. At least now we know we can mourn her. This is... This is a great honour that you have done, to tell me of this. I'm sorry... I must tell my parents..." - she's still holding one end of the journal. Riglan says, "You should keep it. You must!" "Are you sure?" "It's all we have of her. It's yours." "Thank you. It means a lot to us, to have a piece of her to help understand what happened." She opens it. "I feel like I can hear here, in this book. Perhaps as a family we will be able to grieve her loss to the darkness and she will take her place in our tree of life."

She reaches up and takes off an amulet that she wears. "A gift for a gift." It's a beautiful, small piece of gemstone, wrapped in very delicate Mithril. "This is something that was given to me on my birthday. I have no need for it! I have been told that, should I ever need it, it can shield me and hide me from harm. It works only once." "I don't know if I can accept something..." "I cannot accept a gift without one in return. For we are descendants of Aladrin! These are the rules of the fey wild." "Very well - thank you; sincerely."

Air around her has now turned blue; there is a chill. But her gratitude is genuine. "Farewell. Good luck. I sense that you have a significant part to play in our future? Things like these do not happen by mistake."

"Perhaps not. And yes, it seems we have been given a part to play - and play it we shall."

"I will keep you in my thoughts and hope the strands of fate are kind to you, as you have been kind to me today". And she leaves, with the journal.

Marieagh says "What the fuck just happened?!"

Riglan answers, "A confrontation of consequences of our actions that I never expected. I wonder. Was there ever more we could have done to reach them? We *did* try, didn't we?!"

"Yes! Absolutely. Both of you read that that journal. She was crazy!"

"True enough. Quite something to have a tell a woman that you killed her sister, though."

"When she reads the journal she's gonna realise that Aerisi presented herself as a goddess and was pretending to be one of the lost flying elves."

Temo says, "It occurs to me that end-to-end, when viewed as a whole, the heavily-capitalised in speech Spell Plague did not perhaps remove as much magic from this world as has been said. Connections to it remain, all over the place. And to think! A Netherese flying city, in *your* lifespans!" pointing to Riglan and Maireagh.

We continue to discuss the revelation, but also examine the amulet. It's a single-use casting of **Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere**. We consider our respective resilience to attacks of Wisdom or Charisma like attacks (metagaming, but hand-wave for in-world equivalence) as we think those are the most likely forms of mind control Azalin might use. Nethza and Temo are middle-road (and Temo has Luck) so that's OK.

Riglan's great for wisdom but awful for charisma; however it's Maireagh who gets the lowest average, despite Intellect Fortress; she is our front-line tank so might be more visible and liable to be targeted, especially earlier in battle, so we hand it to her. She could in theory cast the spell naturally but that means she has to take away her preparation for something else. But she argues that once inside a sphere, she can't do much; she can command doggie, little else. At least Riglan might have more powerful summoned beasts that can still act. And she's often reacting early to help the party in other ways, so might not have time to use the amulet when it matters. She gives it to Riglan.

### 1pm

Back at the Hall Of Records. The attendant from earlier stands next to us a gleaming elven knight! Mithril head-to-toe. He greats us; he introduces himself as **Jeroen Galarinoss**. We introduce ourselves in kind. We are ready to go!

He leads us out through various streets and levels of Evereska, trending East. We reach an area with many small roads running downwards quite rapidly to lower levels that wrap close around the sides of buildings. An entrance is reached, in the side of a mountain where a wall has been built; we go through a tunnel and emerge onto a strange, lower-down mountainside area with something of a meadow. There are even vineyards planted here and a few fruit trees. It seems like owned, tended land; a small farmhouse sits in the middle.

Jeroen takes us around a path that works its way around the grounds until, camouflaged against the side of the mountain, a fort-like building - a gatehouse of sorts - becomes visible. A round tower. A stream flows down the mountain nearby and is partly diverted to flow through the fields here, the other part continuing to a pool near the keep, then plunging down a waterfall below.

We are led through the gatehouse to steps that zig-zag down *behind* the waterfall. He warns us that it can be slippery! Jeroen is an elf - no issues - and we're generally OK though Maireagh, with the dog, isn't too happy (Riglan throws Bless at her, just in case, though in the end it isn't needed).

It takes a long time to go all the way down the stairs. The path emerges near the bottom beyond the waterfall, to dry steps with a rock outcrop that the stairs duck behind; and **we get a view of the desert for the first time**.

A seemingly *endless* expanse of reddish-yellow sand.

Riglan thinks he might see a faint outline of a mountain or two in the high hills distant in the desert but it's hard to tell and certainly would be hard to navigate using them. To his left, he can just about make out a slightly white shimmer on the horizon; the edge of a glacier? The top of the mountains, distant there, at the Spine? Very hard to tell, lots of heat shimmer and haze in the land between.

The desert seems close; 20 miles, 25 perhaps, from the base of the mountain. Jeroen points at a settlement below, about half way towards the desert. "That is where you must go." We thank him and he wishes us luck; we continue alone.

As he heads back, looking back, Riglan notices a couple of other lookouts along the mountain; it has well-hidden outposts. Sentries must be positioned there. Anyone coming up here would be easily seen. With his eye in, he starts noticing quite a few well-hidden sentry towers.

The stairs end as we enter foothills and we find our own path towards the village. It'll take maybe one more hour to reach the village outskirts.

### 3pm

There's more and more scrub and sand. We follow a stream that broke away from the waterfall and is probably the reason the settlement can exist. There are some farmers in fields, tending to crops; they wear headdresses to protect against the sun and little else except short trousers / long shorts, tied at the waist, with one or two having a kind of sash of cloth over the top, else topless. We start to see houses, made of what look like mud bricks with thatch and wood or even straw structures. Clearly, it must not rain much here! Closer in, we see two or three that are bigger - two-storey, and even a 3-storey watch tower with a lifted roof on an open top level, with a bell.

A lot of people are outside. There are many cloth and canvas stalls; market traders. We reach the centre of the village, a large communal square with many animals and even more stalls. It must occupy at least 1/5 of the entire settlement. The larger buildings and watch tower surround it.

There are maybe 4 or 5 of the brown/olive-skinned elves in amongst the crowd; the rest are all human. A handful of maybe dragonborn or lizardfolk too. They seem more heavily dressed than in Evereska, which surprises Riglan a bit because he figures it's hotter; he looks closer and realises they are more covered up, but their garments are very light. It's protection against the sun.

At this point, our heavy adventuring clothing is taking its toll. "We have to somehow be able to keep armour, but not overheat..." says Riglan. "Not sure how we do that!" Here and there we see guards, fully armoured, and sympathise; we can at least ask them (or ask *someone*) what they do to try and avoid overheating.

A gentle breeze blows down from the mountain. Riglan considers what it must be like in the main desert, without any shade or the breeze. Here, most people stand under awnings or wear head coverings.

The sun is strange! Somehow it just seems *hotter*, as if the sun itself were an entirely different object in the skies here. There's a fierceness that is very unfamiliar. For the first time in Riglan's life, he realises the sun can be threat. And he's not sure what he can do about that.

Temo figures we need a trader selling the things we're after, and/or a guide; he starts investigating but isn't really sure what the stalls really have! It's *that* foreign. He will have to speak to someone. He spots a stall with, to his surprise, two halflings! They seem tanned but not naturally dark-skinned and shelter at the back of the stall. So, he approaches. They greet him - "Hello! Oh, goodness!" - and one of them immediately pours a cup of some kind of tea and offers it. "Come in! Come in!" - the rest of us follow and we're given tea too. Herbal, spicy, sweet - but most of all, cool.

Temo enquires about what brings the two this far East - two, middle-aged, male halflings. They say they moved about 12 years ago. "We consider ourselves locals! I should introduce myself. I am **Bendo** and this is my brother **Rebbo**. Short for much longer names but they're hard for people here to pronounce." We introduce ourselves in turn. Temo says we're chasing a path to evil in the far East and must traverse part of the desert. And as they point out momentarily - yes, we are indeed not well dressed for it.

So we get to business; they have tents, which are used against dune shade sides; a steel pole is pushed in horizontally and the tent hangs off it, an inner compartment ending up partly buried and cool for sleeping, outer for gear. They ask about water skins; they say ours are far too small and show us larger ones. While Maireagh can create water, it's based she thinks on drawing moisture from the air and that might be in short supply in the desert! They'll sell that us the tent for 55gp and throw in two of the large water skins which we can fill early and use as a backup.

They do also have what they call *condensers* of their own making which can fill a large water skin overnight. 12.5gp, quite large, but it *will* fit in the bag of holding - though that's getting quite full. We're given instructions on using it. This is helpful as it reduces reliance on magic - just in case. We're also told to set it up at the end of a trek so that it has the start of dawn to start condensing more or less straight away. It won't fill a large waterskin if we're travelling at night and it can only condense at the start and/or end of the day, but can if left overnight.

They advise us on where to find good desert food and clothing, so we thank them and head off, clothing next. We need advice on armour plus desert clothes.

The halflings have pointed us towards a street called Carpenter Street but there are very few carpenters left! Clothiers now. We investigate that area - Temo 26. Between all the buildings either side, stretched across, are cloth sails that shade the street which is filled with stalls - we have to walk around or between them to make it to shops. There are plenty of shops selling clothes that people here wear and, indeed, there's understanding of people who have to (unfortunately for them!) wear metal. That's a kind of soft silk tunic - no padding - the silk is cooking but stops chaffing and keeps the heat of the armour of us (just in case we're unlucky enough to ever risk travelling during the day).

Temo and Maireagh need that for armour; Nethza for her breastplate too. Riglan has his hauberk so he does need some kind of undershirt too, so that's all of us. There are loose white top cloth garments that go over to keep the sun off; not needed at night but good during the day.

We're measured up. They have the right undershirts already - Riglan's tunic is more of a crop top given he's 8ft tall, but it'll do under the hauberk. They *do* have the loose white clothing that'll work for us all. Nethza also gets some loose white linen trousers that are more practical for desert than her usual skirt.

* 4 tunics
* Flowy top things
* 1 pair of trousers

...42gp. Temo tries to haggle and for game fairness we waive Reliable Talent for this, it's an unknown culture. He only rolls a 3, but that's still 18 overall. There's actually quite some enjoyment in the haggling, all-in, and we do get the trousers for free, at least! 40gp. They even throw in a small extra pair of trousers for Temo just in case - they're not white; a beautiful blue. Very Temo!

Many thanks etc., and off we go. What's next? Maybe checkout desert food options. We have lots of rations, but what works best in the heat?

It's not hard to find a shop with a huge range of completely unfamiliar produce! Big clay jars full of exotic oils and things we're told are called "dates"; shallow wicker baskets filled with some kind of wheat or barley. We're told dates are good for the desert along with nuts. They also point out another basket that looks full of - well, big crickets! Dried. Riglan is kinda OK with that, Temo less sure. Maireagh and Nethza seem definitely less sure. "Baked locusts" we're told. "Very nutritious!" and they also show softer grubs. That's less Riglan's speed too! Scorpions, as well. "And these are sorts of delicacies..." - BBQd lizards and snakes. There's "semolina" too, a kind of grain made from a tree. There are sweet pairs too, but they have to be kept fresh.

* We'll have some dates
* Riglan will have some locusts
* Maireagh asks about semolina cooking and will give it a try
* We can fit maybe 4 pears into the chest, which is already full

...and he throws in "brown lentils, requires some water, makes a lovely paste to eat", along with some paper packets of spices for free too. 5gp all-in, which given all the spices, seems a bargain.

We ask the shopkeeper if there are any local guides who might be able to help us get started on our path. He recommends hooking up with a caravan - the safest way to cross the desert. Main market.

Main market it is. Temo investigates - nat 1, re-roll, nat 20! 34 total. Woah. There's a group of people hanging around a few tents set up just outside the main square; looks like a general trader's stop, next to a water trough and small supply station of sorts, with various palm trees offering shade. And - very strange horses! Odd looking, hump. We figure it must be called a **camel** - we've read about them. Riglan eyes them a bit suspiciously - he fears they might be a bit bad-tempered. Perhaps they are mistreated? It's unclear without speaking to them.

We approach. The people here do look different - dressed similarly to what we've been told to wear, but more ruddy-skinned and just a different kind of vibe. They're keeping cool under the palms. Amphoras of water stand nearby. Supplies are stacked in piles on palettes, strung up as if ready to be hung like saddle bags. And then the penny drops for Riglan - of course, a caravan without caravans; no wheels on sand. The camels must have to do all the work. Ah! *That's* why they seem a bit bad-tempered. They probably have good reason to be.

Riglan's wishing he'd changed clothes - it's too hot... We approach. Temo calls out, "Hello, traders and brave travellers. We have come from the West and have business further East, and wandered if we might be permitted to travel with your group. We have no experience of the desert but much experience of the sword, and can offer you protection, if perhaps little else."

The response is enthusiastic! They are a group who recently joined together to form more of a caravan, coming from different places, some of which are very distant. The first came in from slightly North, coming around than over the mountains; from Waterdeep with pickups in Daggerford! They went via the High Moors, skirted around the north of mountain ranges. They've stopped here for a while to rest. The other group was from Bladur's Gate, Elturel, skirting the "scarred lands" of the Dragon War - they saw some of its after-effects and even caught a glimpse of the erupted volcano - "quite a sight!" - too dangerous to travel through. They did consider Cormyr to Sembia and the Moon Sea, as they're headed towards Thar on its northern side; the other group is headed similarly that way but to the South of the sea.

They're trying to reach the Black Road. They point out that the Black Road is no road at all; merely a well-trodden path through the desert with a few landmarks placed to aid navigation. "Our aim is to head North from here until we meet it. If our records serve us right, we should encounter it on the third or fourth day north of here." That sounds like certainly the right direction and a reasonable estimation of time based on what maps we have.

So we face a difficult choice.

* Go with them on the Black Road and try to find the City Of Shade, hoping it is "phased in" to find and either destroy or take whatever Netherese artefacts we can find across the sea, to stop Azalin getting anything. But we don't know how many artefacts there are, if we could destroy or carry them or when the sea phases in. We *do* at least figure that if we waited long enough there, he'd turn up...

* It might be that if we spend time on this rather difficult quest to find the seer, that by the time we do Azalin has already got the artefacts. But we think that's the better play - find out where he is, or more about him or *anything* about the area via these people in this strange building. But that means travelling without the caravan.

So we thank the traders and wish them well, but after debating in our party we decide that their path and ours don't align. We have to go this alone, perhaps? Temo asks, "What about the **Bedine** tribes?" that we've heard mentioned, to Riglan; and the caravan people overhear. "We have a civilised Bedine guide with us - you're welcome to speak to our man!" and point at a nearly black-skinned gentleman, middle aged, sitting by himself under a palm tree reading a book.

"Thank you" says Temo, "I shall!" and heads over. "Hello Sir, what are you reading?" "Good day!" he says - he puts in a book mark, closes the book, takes off his glasses and looks up. "I was reading a copy of **The Fulminating Treatise**. Have you read it?" Temo says, "No, not had the pleasure." "You simply must find a copy! The theories of the universe in it are quite astounding. They're very confronting but in a strange way I find that they seem logical. They make sense, in an alternate logical path, if you understand me?" "Any mention of the Shadowfell or such domains?" "No, it's about energy. It entirely goes against everything we know about the creation of energy and proposes that all systems of energy are hurtling towards chaos and expenditure; that all energy wants to be spent, to dissipate into nothingness. Its descriptions of magic and how to harness it are explained in an entirely new way. I find it fascinating!" Temo reaches his hand as if to shake. "Temo Smoothhands" he says. "They indeed are! I am **Magura Inati** of the Cloudless Sky."

Temo asks about travel. We're headed South of the mountains, not North. "Oh, why?" asks Magura. Temo detects *something* - perception 16 - Riglan realises he's assessing us as Riglan hands Temo a notebook. He reads the Saiyaddar / Saladear names etc; the guy has heard of them. We explain briefly about the Seer and the evil in the far East. His tribe comes from the North; and we probably want knowledge of "another Wander" - capitalised - he means "tribe". "The Wander that you seek for that area is the Wander of the Mountains Of Death" "I prefer Cloudless Sky!" "So do we! But the mountains do wonders, because they sometimes gather clouds and with clouds come rain, the most precious resource in the Anauroch." He pronounces that differently - "Ann-Aio-Rahk" almost.

We converse on various topics. Towards the end, he mentions: "one law and only one law: You never leave someone behind. If you encounter anyone, you must share your food and share your water."

At dusk, more Bedine might arrive as they tend to come in for food. Magura tells us of their favourite food stalls. We will try to see if one might be headed our way and could at least, for a day or two, show us the ropes.

"If you have no success, my charges here want to leave not tonight, but tomorrow evening. If you want to travel with us, come and find me."

He shows us the non-handshake greeting they have; clasps the inside of the elbow with his hand, matched likewise. A more "arm hug" than "hand shake"!

We've heard there's a public baths - we could get clean, change clothes, use the Stone to clean our old ones and make ourselves a bit more local. We head there. There are a series of glyphs above it in a strange language; Temo dons the Helm; "Megjuba" in Bedine. It means "public baths". **Wait a minute - this village is named "Public Baths"?!**

(That's a classic white person move - hearing the word, misunderstanding it and thinking it was the settlement name).

In we go. Beautiful inside! Stream water remaining from the farm has been sent through settling tanks to drop silt and exits via small indoor waterfalls into shallow baths, about 2ft deep, one or two deeper. There are steps and resting areas. People just sort of sit in there to keep cool it seems! It's all beautifully tiled.

We find an unoccupied corner and put down our gear. Then we look around and Temo goes - "wait - what, *no* clothes?" and Riglan shrugs. "It's a baths!" - he's no qualms given his tribe and strips off and gets in, with Temo calling after him "well of course you don't mind being naked looking like *that* - *and* you've got fur..." - that said, across the bath from us, there's an unusual-looking jackal-headed humanoid with short, dark fur. Temo mistook him-or-her for a Tabaxi at first. They wear beautiful gold earrings across a row of piercings on each ear. So Nethza, Riglan and Temo get in and Temo calls over his shoulder, quietly, "no-one's looking".

Maireagh has wrapped her upper body with a cloth and wears almost like bloomers underwear and gets in. The jackal person smiles to themselves! To distract from that, because Maireagh wouldn't appreciate it, Temo tries to strike up conversation, saying hello and pointing out we're all unusual races and hasn't seen anyone like them before... A bit awkward. "I am **Idlissi**. I am from a place far North of here. There are not many of us. We are known as the **Nubeyans**." Temo responds, "Oh! That's fascinating. Maybe one day I'll get to visit!" "Yes, we have a rich culture!"

It takes a while to settle into the vibe here. Sometimes bits of conversation but mostly just quiet contemplation as people come and go. Time passes and eventually we're going wrinkly so we get changed into our new clothes. It's quite a relief to have the silk layer under the armour, although it takes a while to get it all fitted properly, especially Riglan's short shirt (!) but it's certainly cooling and soft. He can understand why it'd be less good in the West, in part because he suspects on a long hike, the armour would still rub/chafe even with the silk layer but as things stand, we're hopefully not travelling in that manner anyway. And when not moving around, it's much better. We clean our old clothes with the stone and head out to see what time it is.

### 5pm

The village has cooled considerably as the sun as gone behind the high mountains, the village falling into shadow quite early in the evening. That's probably a deliberate part of the choice of building location for it. Temo says, "OK, let's put our old clothes back on!" (lots of rolled eyes). In just an hour the temperature has dropped many degrees. A few clouds are starting to form.

We don't know if this counts as "dusk" yet but head towards the food stalls that were mentioned and loiter! Things are being set up very differently from how it was put together in the daytime. It was interesting during the day but is *packed* now. The number of stalls has doubled. Quite a few things from the day are packed away (though a few remain) and everything else is food stalls of all imaginable varieties. There are fires, clay ovens, all sorts of cured or dried things, all manner of drinks; people are emerging from houses, oil lamps are being lit.

Half an hour, things are getting darker in the sky. There's a sense of anticipation. A few minutes later the tower rings its bell - not an alarm, but melodic. The stalls come to life! It seems that there's some rule, we think, about not eating too early; everything was prepared but nobody was serving. Now people arrive in droves, from the surrounding fields, even more from houses and shops, musicians start; tea poured, smoking, it's all on.

Riglan laughs. "Much as I find, even now, busy places difficult, I think prefer this atmosphere in many ways to the strange quiet and almost austere feeling of Evereska. It reminds me of a close night of the tribe around our fire to celebrate a new season, only on a larger scale. A community a feel; a shared enjoyment; friendly, jovial and light-hearted. While this kind of thing happens in Yartar, say, that place is big enough that you get lots of groups of people who know each other. Here, they might not all know each other perhaps, but it *feels* like a single body. A single community. Food is paid for by exchange of coppers, we note.

We take notes on semolina and lentil use!

Temo wants to try *everything*, but his wisdom - wis save nat 20! + 1 - is enough to be mindful that while he buys food, he can enquire about guides. It doesn't take long! He ends up at a stall that makes crisp semolina and butter pancakes smeared with some kind of paste or butter made from nuts. There's a side with pickled vegetables. There are two Bedine here, with slightly different tattoos from Magura, which suggests a different Wandering. They're speaking Common, but heavily accented as they talk to the trader.

He strikes up a conversation as we walk away from the stall and he's invited to come with one of the two as he heads to a stall selling drinks. Large palm fruits of some kind. It's a sweet liquid inside; Temo tries some, and likes it. The other joins us. They don't know of anyone who could take us all the way to The Saiyaddar; but when Temo asks if there's anyone who can get us at least started off, they light up. They have goats to the South; they come here for breakfast and to sell goat milk, then return for their day - at night time - after some downtime here. They leave in a couple of hours. We are told to meet under the large palm with the lights, where the music is; and we leave them to it.

They are **Naroo** and **Manasi**.

Seems like too good an opportunity to miss, we think. We'll be exhausted after a night of walking after being awake, but we got up late. And we can sleep it off! Eventually, we might have to wind walk during the day to find the ruins or whatever is left of the town we seek, but for now, we can learn to do things "the hard way" as we'll need knowledge surely at some point.

It's a lot cooler. Low 20s now, a decent temperature. Riglan's almost comfortable in his fur! We just rest up, drinking a fair bit, eating sparingly, and resting until it's time to meet at the tree.

Riglan observes the goings-on. Perception 16, though, he's getting tired. Temo is more sociable - persuasion 25. There's excitement as someone is going around buying drinks for everyone. An expedition has arrived back through the desert! A treasure hunting expedition. They've found things and are very happy. They show off a magical flute which creates illusions when they play it (Temo says to Nethza, "Yeah but not as good as a flute that makes bird noises, because that's *useful*, you can draw birds to you, Riglan does it all the time!"). Another throws food slop over a companion, but then produces a stone which magically makes them clean!

### 7:30pm

It's time.

We find Naroo and Manasi already under the big palm, dancing to the music. They are happy - they sold all their music and sold things. "Are you ready to go? We can guide you out towards where we are". Maireagh pipes up - "I would like to pay up front... How much is it?" They look a bit confused and Temo via passive insight explains, "In our culture it's customary for us to pay guides for their time." "Oh - well - I guess we can show you some hospitality when we're there... Um, there's two of us; how about a gold?" "No problem!" and Maireagh pays.

And that's that.

We walk out past fields, along - at least for now - clear tracks. There's a mule on the edge of town, tied near a water trough; they give it a few treats they'd bought. Riglan, quietly, likes that.

The moment we hit the sands - well, it's strange. Somehow, they know *exactly* where they're going. In the dark, we've no idea. It seems featureless, or at least nothing distinctive. We see them look to the sky now and then. At this point Riglan pulls the star map out to see if he can make sense of it. It matches up with the sky easily - the druids taught us well. We are headed directly East.

As we walk, one of them whistles a tune. It's quite cool, surprisingly and as we walk out further the temperature continues to fall - it drops below 20 degrees. There's a persistent wind, which helps too. Riglan realises that this is why the sands must be always moving. The sand whips along the ground quite fast sometimes and we realise that part of the design of what we - and they - are wearing is to protect our lower legs; good thing Nethza got the trousers!

It's further East than we've ever been - walking out into the night.

The moon has risen, hanging high. The stars are incredibly bright. Riglan says "I don't think I've ever seen a sky this clear since my tribe on the clearest of winter's nights".

There's a dreamlike quality to the blue-white, moonlight-bathed sands. It looks like a frozen sea. Very quiet, but there is occasionally the sound of a bird - this land is not dead. Riglan figures that perhaps there's more to the sand and life within it than meets the eye; life always finds a way; but it'll be quite unlike anything he's heard before.

Distantly, there's howling; wolves of some kind. We can't judge distance. The sound comes from a long, long way away.

"Do we know where we're going?" asks Temo. Riglan thinks for a moment, then answers "Well - we know where we've _been..._ So that's something!"

We walk on into the night.

(END OF PART 3.11 - Part 3.12 next)
