# Riglan: Part 3.6
## Day 21 ("day" 18 in Shadowfell, day 2 of 15-day cycle #2)

We wake up in the Abbey Of The Keeps, formerly Shadewood Abbey.

Riglan wakes first, shaken away by a howl. There appears to be activity outside. It seems we've slept in and most of the abbey is awake. Temo wakes next; Maireagh slowly gets going; but Riglan sees that Nethza is missing! "Not again!" he says and we hastily pack up and go looking for her.

We're greeted with many "good mornings" but ask about Nethza. "Oh yes, she wandered out a while ago actually, went that way!" - they point - we follow. Maireagh asks how long; "About four hours I think? Why?" "She has a habit of going missing!"

There is commotion outside. Soldiers from a nearby keep are pointing at something. There are quiet, furtive conversations. Gates are opened, torches held up... "I swear that looks like... Is that...?" - four people venture forth, we venture with them, down the hill and into the edge of the forest. People remark in astonishment as they look around; there seem to be grass and small weeds and trees with leaves in the Blightwood! Sleeping, in the middle of this new grove, is Nethza.

"Well that's just not fair" says Riglan. "Now she's a better druid than I am!" - he gently tries to wake her, but has to be a bit more insistent eventually. She opens her eyes as if very deeply asleep. "What is it? Where am I?" Riglan asks, "What did you dream?" "Dream? Oh. I was - it was strange. I was in a castle and everyone was asking things of me, and then... I don't remember much more. People kept asking me to do things; like there were all these long lists of jobs and tasks. I think I was a queen or something! I can't really remember." Riglan says, "That's OK. You asked where you were. Look around you; you did something I could never do, and I'm druid". And he points out the trees, the leaves, the grass. "We're in the edge of the Blightwood. Not far from the abbey. You *did* this somehow." "What happened?!" "Don't know. You left in the middle of the night and we found you here." "Oh. Am I going to have to sleep tied to the bed or something?" - Maireagh is very quiet.

We comfort her as best we can. We don't know what's going on, but it's not bad. Had we seen her and stopped her, this forest would still be dead in this little grove. We'll keep an eye on her while she sleeps from now on, and be with her if she walks anywhere to ensure her safety.

We return to the abbey. Word spreads fast. People are all questions. Can this be done larger scale? Can it heal the land? What can it do?! We have no answers. All we can do is go to Citeaux and try to find them.

Sister Joni hands us a small metal plate, cut into a triangle with holes at the corners and an intricate design embossed. "This is how I used to enter the Archives. This is how you move the shelves too." We thank her and vow to return it - *if* we're able to get back here within the next cycle! "It is of no use to me; it hasn't been since I left. Hopefully it's of use to you."

The abbey insist on packing a loaf of bread and a few chunks of dried sausage for us in a small bundle.

We thank them and without further ado, strike out; quite a few see us to the gate and we head down, aiming for the main road to Citeaux. A few younger ones are full of hope and wonder. Father Orin tells us that it's the case. Riglan turns and grins and waves; Temo raises his wand of colour spray and shoots it into the sky, to giggles and applause.

Off we go, as Orin shepherds everyone back to the abbey behind us.

A very sombre walk. Failed farms. Nothing grows. Random fissures are present in the ground, the road having been rebuilt around them, or makeshift bridges, barely holding together, are used where there's no other choice. The countryside looks badly damaged. All the houses are abandoned. Looking back to the mountains, we see some parts with huge rockfalls, chunks carved out. It's hard to imagine that this destruction just *stops* there and we saw nothing of any of this in the ~150-years-later period when we first arrived, but we were a fairly long way away. Surely, we'd have seem *something* of it? Perhaps the mist hid it? Or did we change something so serious that it caused this apparent cataclysm?

We're going through a failed field, close to a crumbling manor. It's entirely abandoned. Exterior walls seem to have black soot. Tries around are broken, rotten and dying. The house itself is otherwise intact. Riglan perception 16+10->26. The estate looks like it was abandoned perhaps in a bit of a hurry - there are tools and things left around; even an old, now-rotting carriage pulled up in front; statues that seem valuable. There's a strange sensation. A rhythmic sound transmitting through the ground. Thump, thump, thump. It seems to come not from the house but a field next to the house. Riglan stops the group. "Bad feeling about this. Blood-eating plants, rhythmic sound, rapidly abandoned house; heartbeat? Gotta look, but it's probably dangerous!"

We go off course and venture in. We reach the field. There's a hole in it, around 10ft diameter. The sound comes from down below. There's a tunnel, it's not just a hole...

...and then the sound stops.

"I think it knows we're here!" says Riglan.

Dex saves all round!

* Riglan 19+0->19
* Temo 11+8->19
* Maireagh low!
* Nethza low!
* Dog's OK

Riglan, Temo and the dog dodge out the way, but Maireagh and Nethza are thrown up in the air and land prone as a huge rumble happens and something bursts out of the ground from almost under their feet. A *huge* worm, the diameter of the tunnel!

Initiative:

* Temo 7,20+6->26
* Riglan 16
* Nethza 8
* Maireagh 4

Temo doesn't hesitate. Aims and fires. Hits - just - for 39 damage. Riglan sees how the armour only just gets pierced and figures his summoned creatures won't stand a chance; he uses his lightning wand, creature failing its dex save, 8d6->25 damage. He drops in his bear totem to give everyone some help.

The worm moves right up in front of the dog, Temo and Riglan. It tries to bite Temo! Silvery Barbs does not prevent a hit (25 total, and nat 20 after Silvery Barbs (adv to Maireagh), so the lower roll is 25). He takes 21 piercing damage. Ouch. DC 19 dex save to avoid being saved - with luck point, only 18 - Maireagh shouts, "Roll out between its teeth!" at the last minute, and (+5) he makes it.

The rest of the very huge worm emerges; it's very stout tho - perhaps 40ft long, despite its 10ft diameter! - the tail has a hooked sting which lashes out at Riglan. 16 piercing damage; con save roll is dreadful, only 6+3 -> 9; 38 poison damage.

Nethza stands. Shadows lash out from Nethza towards the worm; Hexblade's Curse. She pulls out her shadow blade too. Rolls a 19, which is a crit with HB Curse; damage is 22. Non-crit hit second time, 18 more damage. It's at least looking a bit damaged now.

Maireagh gets up by rolling away. She's got 5ft between her and the creature; it has 10ft reach, so it can still hit her, but she can use a ranged attack. The hammer is thrown! She casts L2 Branding Smite too. With adv from Silvery Barbs she hits with 19+mod., 2d8+8+2d6->d8->1,1,d6->6,6!->22. Second attack; crit! 4d8+8->9+8 (boo, bad rolls on the d8s for Maireagh today). 17.

Temo always stands his ground! He aims and fires. He hits, but the damage roll is really bad; 26 total. A *lot* of 1s and 2s! Oh well.

Riglan uses the wand again; hits; and this is a solid 30 damage. It lights up almost like a cartoon - from the inside, its skeletal structure (such as it is) visible against the blue-white light of the lightning bolt that went straight into its mouth. It dies; but in the process of doing so, a strange black goo is expelled from its armour plates. The goo starts to vaporise, making strange screeching noises as if sentient. It turns into a puddle. The worm falls to the ground.

Now it's dead, Riglan recognises the species. A young purple worm; a subterranean creature, living in mountains, eating rock. The sound Riglan heard he realises now wasn't a heartbeat, it was the chomping noises of its burrowing. It shouldn't be here! This black goo did something to it. Riglan tries Produce Flame to try and burn up the goo. It actually catches fire and burns, almost like oil.

A purple worm has poison glands that deliver very potent poison - he felt it personally! Perhaps we should try to harvest that. We have the monster harvesting kit from way back, on our first trip to Thundergrove Bastion. We set to work - dex check with 2x proficiency, natural 20! Total is a whopping 35. He literally walks into the mouth, asks if it looks like "description" - the monster harvesting kit has a book, from the hunters we'd met and this is described in detail. Maireagh has some vials; Temo harvests easily and we transfer the poison into 2 vials. We surmise that it is *very* valuable and potent.

### 2500XP for battle, 2000XP for Nethza/crater/all that

We figure a short rest is needed. We've been walking almost half the day anyway by this point; 3 hours or so, not that far from Citeaux. We rest up near the manor, but not inside.

### 3pm

The edge of Citeaux. There's a significant encampment of people outside, past the edges of where we remember Trade Ring to be. There seem to be city walls too. Lean-to huts, shacks against wagons and so-on make up what amounts to little more than a slum here, outside those walls. The road has a few people on it, mostly going in, but we see a few riders galloping out - four - cloaks pulled tight around, hoods up. We push on to the gates, which are guarded.

The guards stop us and ask our business. Riglan insight 18 (we're in our traveller's clothes, with usual armour, weapons too). Riglan says, "Offering security services for traders." One of the smart alec guards say, "Didn't go so well for your previous employers, I see? No traders?" and Riglan says, "Can't win 'em all..." - the two guards confer - "Can you afford to be in the city?" and Temo looks to him and says, "What would it cost to say we can?" and quietly hands him a gold. The guard says, "They're good for it! Let 'em in".

Behind us we here a group of people trying to say they're with us; we get the impression anyone who looks "a bit poor", refugees, anything like that, get stopped. "You're welcome to set your tent up with the rest of your kind! The city is full!"

Riglan comments to Temo quietly, "Hasn't improved in 250 years, but we didn't expect it to!" - and we proceed to the trade ring. The guard might not have been lying either - this area is *crowded*. Inns have signs saying "full" or "no rooms". We make a beeline for the mid city, hoping to see if the Order Of Scribes still exists. Temo leads the way, but the layout of much of the city has changed. A lot of rebuilding is evident. Buildings look new - it's only been about 10 years since It Kal exploded. Streets are generally narrower, with fewer squares/common areas. One of the main thoroughfares to Mid City does still exist and we recognise it, so we follow that to the gate.

There's a fair bit of traffic. People weren't exactly super friendly before, but now it's all heads-down, eyes-down, pushing through crowds. No street traders hawking wares. Entering Mid City is easy; no guards. The building which used to house the Order seems to be *partly* rebuilt, if not completely; but many of what used to be nearby theatres no longer exist. Accommodation, flop houses; even some factories. Industry has spread here; the ordered segregation has broken down.

We try knocking on the front door. Sounds of steps from within on a stone floor. The door creaks as it is pulled open. An old woman stands there; "We're closed! What do you want?" - she looks tired. We say, "We're old friends of the Order. Very old!" - and Riglan shows the note from 2.5 centuries ago! "Odd, there isn't anyone here of this name..." - she sighs - "...you'd better come in."

Inside, we notice that the inside doesn't look like the outside. There's a scaffold up the interior right-hand side, looking like it is being repaired. Many of the shelves are empty and damaged. Boxes and boxes of books are piled everywhere. Riglan says, "Ah! Now I see why you're closed." "Yes. We weren't exactly a priority for the rebuilding crews. It's taken all we can do to stop documents getting damp and damaged..."

We explain that we're trying to find the name of the Marbery estate. We go with her, to help with lifting things! Maireagh also casts Mending here and there to sort out minor damage to shelves or walls. We're pointed to a pile of boxes that *should* contain the history of houses. We can look at each. Riglan athl 25, he makes light work of it; Temo and the lady together find the box of interest; she flicks through some kind of index, then says, "Ah! Marberry! Here." - she reaches into the box and finds no less than four books. One is about the *fall* of House Marberry. That sounds about right... Turns out it was only written about 8 years ago. Riglan says "Oh! So *after* the... incident... with It Kal." "Yes, but it contains information much older than that."

The book indicates that House had been declining for some years prior. No clear event precipitating, but after about 10 minutes of searching the librarian does find that they used to have a hunting lodge - but one they couldn't upkeep, so withdrew into the city (and that then caused clashes with **House Leshat**, which sped up their downfall). The lodge used to be up in the woods on the "other side of the canyon". Riglan says, "Does any bridge to cross it still exist?" "Yes. But not the old bridge. They built a new bridge, where it's narrower and less deep. Further upriver. Nothing of the old bridge survived the blast."

Riglan pauses then asks, "There apparently used to be barracks there, under It Kal, accessed from the village lower down..." - she cringes. "I'll be honest with you - very few people have dared go near It Kal. The village itself - well, if it survived at all it would've been ravaged by whatever strange energies emanate from that place. A few have tried to study it but many have been driven mad! It's impossible. Pieces of the palace and of rock upon which it used to stand hover in the air; missing parts of the towers and keep have exposed stairs that crumble but are rebuilt every day; new passageways apparently form between disconnected, surviving sections of it. A maelstrom of uncontrolled and unpredictable wild magical energies."

The barracks probably collapsed. Not much is left of the hill. The village is all but gone.

The blast apparently slammed into the Eastern face of Citeaux; that's what took out the wall that's being repaired here. 

It's getting late. It looks like at least 4 hours to the hunting lodge, and in unfriendly territory with the forest/woods as they are. Perhaps we could do the Grand Archive thing? Find somewhere to stay in Inner City? Temo (investigation only 2+14) can't find an inn with a free room here. We give up and figure we'll try the tunnels then. Who knows... So we look for the nearby entrance. It's been 250 years plus a cataclysm, but - well, we find the alleyway. Very quiet. Rubbish piled up. The building at the end looks to have crumbled and not rebuilt. Rubble blocks the entrance, but we could try clearing it; Riglan athl 24, he has a go at digging out the old cellar doorway. With a bit of a heave up and some crowbar work, the doors open and we head down.

It's dark; Temo uses his googles and Riglan casts Darkvision.

We find our way into the tunnels, but they're in very bad condition. In modern language, seismic activity; walls appear to have crumbled, chunks of rock have detached from the ceiling, littering the ground; cracks show sections offset. We know the route, but it's slow going due to the damage. We proceed with care.

Temo in front (Maireagh behind) adv history 2,3+4->7 - he was here only a few days ago, easy! - but he realises now just how much has changed. At the very first intersection, there's a cave in that blocks the way forward completely; he tries to follow open passageways that go in roughly the same direction, but we're no longer in the same tunnels (not great!).

Riglan at the back, Nethza in front of him, perception 9+10->19 keeps hearing scurrying and scratching sound in the passageways and sounds of water dripping or trickling. It's eerie. Nature check only 4+10->14, but with that, it certainly sounds like something bigger than a rat. A small mammal or large insect. He whispers a warning to be alert and uses his staff to cast Pass Without A Trace. We proceed stealthily:

* Riglan adv 10,17+0 -> 17+10 -> 27
* Temo 4+16 -> 20+10 -> 30
* Maireagh 21 total
* Nethza 20 total

Riglan listens carefully to the noises as we proceed, hearing no change in pattern of the sounds; they're not aware of us, it seems, or don't care. It takes a while, though, to find our way; 15 minutes or more; Temo adv history 9,16+4 -> 20, he finally recognises the tunnel he leads us into. Older, even less well kept, slimy - nobody's walked here in a long time - and we get into the corridor that leads up to the door that pushed into the cellar before. Riglan tries to push open the door, like before, with Maireagh helping; adv athl 9,17+8->25. This time it's not at all quiet - scraping noises the whole way - and the whole door pushes out; it's not on hinges anymore due to damage. Oops. So we've pushed the whole stone door "chunk" out of the way. Once we're inside, we push the door partly back so that it's not wide open for whatever is in the tunnels to "visit" the cellar!

### 5pm (estimated)

We're inside the cellar. It exists, but walls are cracked and rubble is on the ground. It's not fared any better than the tunnels. We look for the stairs that go up under the barrel. It's there, but steps have rotted. Temo - lighter - tries carefully to ascend and open the hatch. He gets up the steps OK, athl 15+0->15; it's enough; it creaks open and above, there's no barrel. Temo pops his head up to look into the room above. Empty. No barrels at all now; the room is intact but seems abandoned and unused. Dusty. We proceed up, with Temo dropping a rope to help Riglan avoid stressing the rotting ladder too much.

We remember a door leading to a corridor. It's locked. Temo checks the lock; 19+16->35 thieve's tools SOH check. There's a key inside, but he can easily push it out of the lock, sliding a piece of cloth under the door first to catch it; slides the cloth back in and unlocks the door with the key.

The fact it's locked is odd, but suggests occupation. Riglan calls the spider once more to investigate. Along the roof, to the t-junction. It's a familiar space; check the old washroom first for the rear door. The well and washtub are still there but dry. Door present and closed. Now the spider checks the other route, towards the servant's common room. Folded linen, a plate with crumbs and an empty mug, but nobody. Riglan whispers, "OK, sneak out that back door" and we creep out. Temo locks the door behind us, from the outside so it looks the same as before and we get to the back door. Temo tries to pick the lock; 10+16->26; meanwhile, Riglan is on watch, perception 10+15->25, nobody in the common room, crumbs there look old and dry, disintegrating. Ah. Maybe this place is disused? So once Temo has the door unlocked, we leave it closed and decide to investigate further. We get to the common room and Riglan sends the spider ahead, to the kitchen. Now, the kitchen *does* look recently used. It's not in great condition - not cleaned up well - it's surprising that we've not met anyone else. Single occupant, no servants perhaps? Main entrance. Used to be grand, although it was fading a bit "back in the day". It's a bit dusty but surprisingly the huge marble table is still there. Tapestries out. A big metal vase. Strange; this looks like it's set up a gala, but that was all hired - at least 250 years ago, it was.

Lights in some rooms. The spider heads towards the library. An upright piano, old; shelves filled with books; armchairs; 3 empty wine glasses and an empty carafe on a coffee table. No people, but the door to the balcony is open. Check the balcony. To the right, someone is sat on an outdoor chair. Male, middle aged if a human, but their back is to the door (some greys in shoulder-length hair, wearing a suit jacket and trousers with leather shoes). The spider moves around, high, up and over; wisdom saving with spider's stats, 18+0. A brief sense of a probing presence, sweeping over briefly. The man is sipping a cup of tea. He puts the teacup down on the saucer and says, "Who's there? I know there's someone. What are you doing?"

Riglan motions to the others to stay back, borrows the Horn of Silent Alarm off Temo and walks out to the balcony. He sees the man has stood and faces the door. Riglan recalls the spider to the Fey for now. "Forgive the intrusion". The man says, "Naughty! Spying on me. Why are you spying on me?" Riglan answers honestly; we knew this place 250 years ago, but it's changed, wanted to see if there was anyone hostile here. He asks why. We're just passing through we say; so we're not "legally" here, he says. We say we're looking for the Grand Archives. He says, "You could be in some trouble. It would benefit me to have you apprehended. Why should I not do that?" Riglan says that it's hard to know; we might go on to do things that would benefit this character, but can't say for sure. Riglan intelligence-based insight, he can't figure it out (5+5->10). Something going on, but there's intrigue here.

Then man walks past Riglan into the drawing room. "Right. Well, if you want access into the inner city, I can arrange that for you, but there is a price." "Of course. What is your price?" "10,000 gold pieces". "A strong price. Any room for barter?" "It depends how much you value my silence!" Riglan says he'll fetch his companions (the man is of course aware he's not alone).

Riglan messes with Temo a bit - blows the horn, so the three come running! - by which time the man has a cane, hanging off his forearm. "What is the meaning of bringing in reinforcements? Shall I do the same?" Riglan says, "I don't think I'd be fool enough to attack you. I don't carry 10,000 just *on* me!" In any event, the guy calls, "Mother! Sister! Drawing room! Now! - Please."

OK, we wait and see who turns up while Riglan briefly explains the conversation to the group.

In walk a crone, who does look like an older, more worn-down version of Madame Ecrit and Riglan exclaims, "Why, Madam Ecrit!" "*Dutchess* Ecrit, thank you very much!". She looks very closely, then kind of hisses at us with fangs bared. That's directed at Temo. "*You*." she leans forward, eyes red. She reaches out with supernatural speed and agility, long nails. "No. Impossible! You. You! You're the reason why we're in this state! You're the halfling. The one that helped Robert Orin." Temo answers, "But wait, we heard about Robert at an Abbey. That was hundreds of years ago." "Yes, I remember." Temo says, "Well, look at me! I'm not a day over 50." Deception 5+5->10. Oh boy.

She sniffs, knowing he's the same person. "But you're not undead! Tell me your secret. How have you remained so youthful without giving your undying soul. Tell me. What is the secret!" Temo answers, "We're not of this world. We travel in time every 15 days." "Really? Well..." - she turns to her - son? - "Have you struck up a bargain?" He answers, "Well, yes, they haven't agreed..." "Well the deal has changed. Whatever it is my son has promised you, we will provide that and more, if you take me back in time with you so I can undo this nonsense."

Temo thinks for a moment, then says, "Well, we could *try*. But we've no idea how to bring anyone else along - we all fall asleep at the Hunt, then awaken elsewhere; forwards or backwards, we have no control. We can try having you amongst us or alongside us, but you might not travel with us and we might just as well go even further forward in time, rather than back."

She steps back and thinks. He daughter, also older, is recognisable but she's fared the worst. She's very, very old; gaunt, almost skeletal; frightening to look at. She's undead, but of the kind of mummy/lich variety; doesn't seem vampiric, no youth retained at all. She's continued ageing. She speaks in hoarse whispers. "What is it brother? Why have you wakened me?" "We have an opportunity, sister. A way for us to get out of this, to stop this - this ridiculous charade that mother insists on putting on every few months... Borrowing, stealing from Peter to pay Paul." "What is this new source of wealth you have found?" "Our benefactors here; I smell they carry old wealth. Something from the golden era. Something that will lift us back to our proper position."

Temo figures talk first, fight second. "Well, we have old money, but in a form you won't find useful. Nobody here knows about etherium. But through Robert, had connections in the Inner City. If you grant the pass you promised, we can try to convert that into cash and come back to pay. But otherwise, if you insist on gold - sadly, no deal."

The mother turns to the son. "I can smell it too..." Turns to us. "Do you carry the token of the council's favour?" Riglan says, "As I told your son, we had ways to get into the Inner City legitimately; we just didn't want the questions asked at the gate." Riglan insight 17+10->27. Glances of frenzied excitement! "Show me. Show me! I must have it!"

Temo answers, "Well, now, that wasn't the deal. 10,000 gold, pass to the inner city." "No, new deal! Give me the token of favour!" Temo says, "In exchange for what?!" "For... For free passage. And - and the sigil. The sigil of our house." Riglan looks at Maireagh and Nethza and says, "Oh dear, it does seem to be turning into one of *those* conversations again, doesn't it? I mean, they're probably out of our league, I don't know, but aren't we overdue cleaning up some vampires now?! Seems a bit risky, but we can't just go giving council tokens away and they've changed the deal 3 times in the last 3 minutes so I don't know if we can trust them" - and turns to Ecrit giving her a capybara look, pointedly. Temo says, "Given how much value you appear to put into these tokens, the exchange offered seems like a poor deal."

Nethza takes a look at us all, looks around; casts Wall Of Light. It flashes across the middle of the room. "I can only hold that up for so long. Out the door now!" (amounts to the Dash action for us all). Maireagh brings up the rear. We hear screaming and shrieking from the vampires, who are probably taking radiant damage; but Maireagh sees Lady Ecrit push through, calls "fuck fuck fuck!" - gets to the balcony, pushes her hands down onto the stone and casts Stoneshape (L4 slot used). The stone rises up and seals the french doors, crushing them in a wall of stone. It's 10ft above the street... We jump! Athl checks:

* Maireagh 12 (hits the ground with a thump; the dog lands on top of her)
* Riglan 15 (inelegant but on his feet)
* Temo 21 (classic three-point landing for style)
* Nethza (with Maireagh helping) only 9

Maireagh and Nethza are both a bit hurt; 6 damage; but Nethza keeps her spell going.

"Where are we going?!" and Temo shouts, "The old hotel!" - and we run. We get a fair distance away from the house, about 300ft or so, when we look behind to see Lady Ecrit standing onto the balcony from other room, shaking her fist at us. Temo says, "Keep going, they can turn into bats and clouds and stuff..."

They don't pursue, but they might try and turn us in. Riglan says, "She thought it was a 'token of favour', but what *we* have is some kind of talisman; yet it must emanate a presence or signal that people can detect. Bag of holding!" and we move it into the bag of holding as we go, hoping that might shield things a bit. "Perhaps they *are* some way to show that that council favours us; to get in with them somehow." "But why did the gnolls have them?" asks Nethza. "Well, that was 250 years ago... Maybe the meaning changed; maybe it let the gnolls back into the council building unchallenged..."

We get to the hotel. This means running past Madam Bela's place. It's still there, but not as it was; there seems to have been a lot of rebuilding. Stonework differs, either in colour or style. Even some areas in the inner city have been left in pieces, with some parkland areas where buildings were cleared. Madam Bela's seems to no longer be a fashion house - it is now a casino! "Temo, *no*" says Riglan.

There's even the toy shop, still a toy shop. Tummil's. Someone's on the door, but we don't slow down. Hotel first. Approaching, it's different. Trees here had been damaged and replanted. Palms now! Looking a bit sickly, too. Very Vegas. The garden sculpture in the middle is now a fountain, lit in blue and pink. The building itself was damaged and has been rebuilt, but apparently smaller; missing a floor; the columns at the front are the same at least, but an entire wing and some of the top seems to have been reconstructed. It's now called "**The Blue Flamingo**"! Temo says, "Well, *this* place has gone to shit!" and runs in anyway.

There's a doorman just on the *inside*. He greets Temo, who screeches to a halt - "Good evening, what are you - how may we serve you tonight?" Looking around, we see a sort of reception towards the back, but the dining room on the left is now a full restaurant, on the right there's some kind of dance floor and bar with drinking tables. Temo says, "Uuh, room?" "Oh. Rooms? Yes - um - err - yes - always a good idea to have a room for after... Please head up to reception"

The dress code is 60s Air Hostess for Phloston Paradise (Fifth Element). Bright pink hair. Temo says, "Your best room please." "Oh! Well. As we always say, every room is the best room." Temo says, "Yes, but the actually best room please!" "Just one" "How big is it?" "It sleeps two... Oh! Right. You want a family room. You're in luck! One family room left." Takes a key off the hook. Temo says, "How much per night?" "5gp" "OK. Pay now, or pay on checkout?" "Now please".

We pay and ask where the room is. Upstairs, end of the hall, room at the end. Not even on the top floor. Roughing it. "Settle in, put your bags down, get changed for the night and we'll see you back down here! Remember, the dining room shuts at 10 but the bar goes all night."

Going up the stairs, we notice that the first level isn't rooms - seems to be lounges - then up to a 3rd floor, with rooms. At the room, we open the door, expecting the worst... ...the layout is not actually too dissimilar from the room we had once before; a small foyer, two pink flamingos stuck in a pool as decoration, complete with fake grass - Riglan says, "But they're *pink*" - deck chairs, for a 'beach side' feel - with bedrooms on a strange mezzanine on spiral, open stairs. Maireagh says, "I don't like what they've done with the place" but Riglan says, "I do like what they've done with the price" - there's still a Juliette balcony though, so we check that out. Looking out, we now see a pool towards the back of the property. It's lit up and blue.

Well, it's certainly different.

We change into slightly smarter clothes and use the cleaning stone to clean up the others, since they're dirty from the tunnels, then head downstairs and ask at the reception desk if they have any maps or other ways to find the Grand Archive - but Temo asks first about the pink flamingos in the room. Blue Flamingo is a "famous" poem; about danger on the high seas. It was a ship. The hotel's current owner, back when the port could be sailed from, used work on a ship. People who sail know of the poem; it's doubtful whether the Blue Flamingo even existed, beyond the fiction. "Most poems are allegories". Once he became land-bound, he took over ruins of what was once a grand hotel on this site. He decided to run instead a place of levity! He named it after the ship, because the poem tells that it always found its way through the most dangerous seas, conveying its crew to safety. "And that is what we do here! In times of darkness and strife and sorrow and trouble, we shine a light upon the happier times."

As for the Grand Archive - after the cataclysm, it was one of the first buildings to be restored as it's **very important to the council**. People at the bar or restaurant, "older than I" might know more about it. But look for the spires - it was rebuilt with gleaming black spires, sandstone blocks, right opposite the Chamber Of Council.

So we head to the bar and are shown to a table, but we ask if we can instead be at the bar? We're led outside to the main bar. The bar staff are wearing cat costumes, "because this is called the kitty bar" - there are stories of far-off places where there are bars where they sell exotic drinks, around pools, apparently called "kiti bars" (tiki bars!) - it's a large cabana bar by the pool.

We end up with drinks based on fruit - Maireagh: Apple (tall drink, sour apple, fizzy), Riglan: Orange (Tequila Sunrise), Temo: Pineapple (white rum served in a pineapple with straw), because the barman mentions it and he's never heard of it, Nethza: Cantaloupe on recommendation (short drink, sweeter, strong dark rum flavour). 1gp each! Temo realises that *this* is why the room is cheap.

Temo then strikes up a conversation with the barman, the aim of which is to try and find out more about the Archives, or at least find out who else to talk to. He actually points at the building, its spires distantly visible; why does the council find it so interesting? All remaining documents of authority, that give the council power to rule - **now that the king, Rex, is gone** - reside in the archive; without those documents, the council would have no such authority. "How do you know Rex is gone?" "The castle - have you *seen* the castle of It Kal?" "Yes, but Azalin Rex is surely not so easily killed off." "Oh he wasn't killed - no - people say he ascended!" Temo points at the fractured sky - "Through that?" "Well yes. **He released a lot of magic and broke through the barriers of the planes and ascended. He has become a god, or so they say.** His absence has caused all this lawlessness and collapse of our - well, world, really."

If the documents were destroyed and the council subsequently challenged, they'd have nothing to back their claim. Many might challenge them - he doesn't want to endanger anyone's safety by naming them - and besides, it could collapse into chaos (and he doesn't want to "engage in sedition"; rebellion exists). The barman is uncomfortable talking about it, so heads off to serve other customers. (Riglan, insight only 6+10->16; he's being cagey but it's not coded language).

We discuss the news. Azalin gone - not good! Where? Did this happen because of us, or had he already gone in the ~150 years future and we just couldn't see the sky rent apart as it was too far away from where we first came in?

When the barman returns, we ask if he knows if the Archives have opening and closing times - they do; he knows that they open at 8am as a regular (**Jerrod**) works there.

We finish a second drink and decide on a whim, to head to the weird toy shop. Nethza hasn't seen it, at which Temo exclaims, "Oh my, I forgot!" and produces the flute bought for her as a gift. "This was meant to be a gift when we found you." "What is it?" "Try it!" She blows into the flute and a cacophony of bird sounds emanate. Temo says, "You might need a bit of practice to get a specific bird..."

### 8pm

So, off we go, to the toy shop. It's open. On approach, the doorman says, "Good morning. Welcome to Tummil's" in a singsong voice - it seems to be some kind of construct - and opens the door. We head inside. There's a directory in front, as there was before, but the contents are different. More than just toys - toys, armour, "kit", weapons. Weapons section! It's all dungeon-y; shackles, spiked chains, scythes, whips; Temo investigation 20(!)+14->34. Most weapons are of a certain kind - no ranged weapons, except for low damage hand crossbows; there also strange things that look like small canons. Long tubes of metal with big muzzles. "Hand canon?" suggests Temo; "Seems clumsy". There'a a lack of specific weapons - there is nothing silver; no wooden stakes - no sharpened spears, or javelins.

As for "kit" - cages, chests, puzzle boxes, safe boxes that are hard to open - puzzles almost - lanterns, lamps, and so-on. Almost "early technology", the once-toy mechanisms adapted to more practical uses. No silver again. There are ornate, large, long boxes, some on display, that apparently have properties - keeps soil damp, airtight, muffles sounds, that kind of thing. Large and long enough to be coffins, *almost* - a travel-sized cramped coffin... On to armour, briefly; some unusual designs here. Reinforced chest pieces, or chain mail but with very small ring sizes, almost victorian-like collars made of chain and metal. "Protects the neck", observes Riglan. "Maybe we need that!" - we pick up 3; they're only available in metal, which Riglan doesn't want to wear. Maireagh reminds Riglan that actually we already have the silver collars smelted for us days ago; ah yes! But Nethza doesn't have one, and a couple of less expensive backups are useful. Less eye-catching, perhaps.

Finally, onto toys! At last. Nethza looks around and (bad rolls!) is bewildered by the array of toys. They're quite macabre; we found the same in the previous "time zone" when we visited. Beautiful as they are, they're mainly mechanical. They have creepy, kind of sad aspects. Things haven't got better for the shop - there's an air of, well, desperation perhaps - as if whoever makes the toys is desperate that they're appreciated and that his work is seen. Attention-seeking, perhaps. Temo looks to see if anything is of particularly good workmanship, once this is observed; investigation 11+14->25. Whoever is making these has probably gone too far! These aren't polished, beautiful and elegant, as Temo remembered from before - even if they were scary! - the movements aren't smooth and beautiful either. It is almost as if whoever makes them is getting too hold. Some show signs of wear, as if they've sat on shelves for a long time and no longer work as they should. This explains the smaller toy section at least. One of the oldest looking toys is a kind of small keyboard, a dulcimer almost. Some of the keys don't even work. "That one", says Temo, picking it up.

Maireagh tests it - "It's broken! This is broken, Temo! It doesn't function!" and Temo says, "We're here to help people and our help sometimes makes a difference. Whoever makes these needs help." "What makes you think buying this will help them?!" "I don't know! Maybe it will, maybe it won't." He's resolved to try, anyway. The price tag says "300gp"/"280gp"/"250gp"...crossed out, etc..."50gp".

So, we head downstairs to the central desk. We wait a while, but nobody turns up. Nethza looks around, asking us if something's supposed to happen now?! Riglan wonders if the shop is "just on automatic"; no longer working; but then, very, very slowly, a ghost materialises. Tummil. It coughs. "I didn't see you there. I'm sorry!" and he starts looking at what we've got. "3 of them... 10 gold each... Oh!" and he looks to us to see who buys the keyboard. "Oh! Oh dear boy, I'm so sorry - it's a little broken!" and Temo says, "it's the age, artistry and the *idea* of it that I like..." "If only we could still repair these! But the skill to make them is long lost to us now." "Who was it?" asks Temo. "This? This was made by my daughter. She's long gone. She used to make quite a few of these - they were very popular with the young ladies who were learning! But that's a thing of the past, as well. Look, young man. Let me show you a trick in getting it to play..." - he pushes a spectral hand behind it - "...if you just twist these, and reset them, you can get a few plays out of it before it sticks again!" Temo thanks him. "80gp for all of this. Is it a gift? Did you want it wrapped?" we say no, it's for us; Temo asks if Tummil is sure he only wants 50gp? It's playable after all. "I'm happy someone wants to take this home! It's been a long time since anyone's shown interest in instruments and toys. The world has changed somewhat since my day." Temo nods. "Yes, but we hope it might perhaps start changing for the better..." - while they talk, Tummil absent-mindedly wraps the dulcimer anyway. "That's OK" says Temo, "It'll help protect it." He asks if there's a picture of his daughter. "No, it's in my mind. There might be a portrait of her in the old house, but I can't go there anymore. It's out in the country - on the road up to the King's Pass. Look, I'll tell you where it is!" and he gives directions. "If you are passing by - and if you're coming back - you could tell me if it's still there. I can't leave here you see." "If it's still there, would you like me to bring it here?" "The portrait? Oh! It's far too big for you to carry!"

We thank him and head out. His house is on the way out of the valley - it'd be quite a detour - but might be worth it. It'd be a day-or-so trip of its own.

"Not what it was, sorry Nethza" says Temo. "It's quite sad". "Yes, isn't everything round here! That's why we're trying to find out more - about you, about Rex, about everything - because we think - *hope* - it might help everyone in the end."

We head back to the hotel to sleep, paying for 3 nights, so 15gp. We sleep in the separate bedroom. We aren't sure if this place is safe or not, especially given running from the Ecrit family, so we set watch, the dog assisting all night.

* Maireagh - nothing happens
* Nethza - nothing happens
* Temo - adv perception only 13, a fitful night, wakes up to a strange light coming underneath the door. He opens the door and notices a very bright light shining in the main room. It's *very* bright - he can't look at it directly. Strange tendrils of black shadow wrap around the light. He wakes Riglan!

Riglan calls a fey bat, to use Blindsight to investigate the too-bright object. Through the bat, he sees Nethza! She's floating in the air, windows to the balcony open, the light streaming off her - it shines out of the window. The tendrils of shadow are wrapping around her, spinning rapidly, as if trying to contain the light; she seems unconscious. Riglan tells Temo to close the balcony doors and curtains, then he approaches Netzha and (perception 19) hears strange whispers. She's not whispering. Detect Magic - it's overwhelming, a supernova of magic! The shadows are magical, and as he approaches, he sees they are spirits. He calls to them; "Spirits! What's your business here?" - Maireagh calls from the bedroom at that moment, "What's going on?!" and Riglan briefly explains. The spirits don't answer.

Riglan calls Temo over, asking him to use the Helm to see if he can understand the whispering. The spirits seem to be talking, persuading, chanting; a cacophony of unrelated conversations; some try to get her attention, some others try to speak to her and protect her somehow. They don't seem to be malicious - Temo shouts out, "They seem to be trying to help - to break her out of it, to protect her..." - Religion/Arcana (equal) 16 via luck point - they're spirits of the Shadow Fell, but not from this particular plane/domain. It's a form of dark elven being spoken. Riglan tries Elvish then; he calls out - "Spirits! How can we help?" in Elvish. It works! One turns to Riglan; "Do you help or hinder her ascension?" (Temo translates). Riglan responds, "I do not understand ascension." "It is her destiny, but we cannot agree - these spirits all mean well for her - but they do not agree on what is good for her" - Temo's hearing, "It is your destiny, your calling, ascend to the throne" / "Do not! Do not, you'll lose yourself, you'll forget who you need to be!" So Riglan answers, "We would not prevent an ascension if that was her desire and her destiny; but we would not want her to lose herself." "Then you understand our dilemma!" so Riglan calls, "What is she doing right now?!" "It is a chrysalis! She is - she is becoming part of this land! The land calls to her - to fill a void that has been left!" "By the departure of Azalin Rex?" "We do not know. We are merely her shadows. But she is being called by a void. A force of good, to take upon the mantle..." - but others interrupt - "...but she has to give too much! She has to give *all* that she is" - and Temo's voice cracks a bit as he recites this - Marieagh calls, "How do we wake her up?" and Riglan says, "It is too soon and we do not understand enough. To resolve your dilemma we need to learn. And to learn we need time. We need to wake her up from this chrysalis." The spirits whisper, apparently in some kind of debate; "Yes! We are trying to wake her as well. She has tapped into something. Something coming form that direction!" - and Temo pulls the curtains aside and it's clear that the beam of light points straight at the ruined It Kal, so he shouts that back and closes the curtains.

Riglan tries to stand in front of her, with her floating at about 2ft, so she's at eye level. The bat's on his shoulder so he can see. He tries to hold her at the side of her shoulders, one hand each - but when he touches her, he takes 4 points of radiant damage straight away. He holds his grip. He tries shouting to her, in Common, "Nethza! It's Riglan! Wake up!" - but even with his eyes closed he can see light coming out of her eyes, ears and mouth; she's not asleep, it's more of a trance and she looks in pain. He attempts his highest possible Dispel Magic, L7, but it's an act of desperation; check is 18+5->23 - and to his surprise, some kind of connection between her and It Kal seems to break. Suddenly, she's heavy in his arms as she starts to fall and he lowers her quickly. The light flickers and falters, Riglan opens his eyes; the spirits disperse; we realise now there had been a loud ringing and humming that we'd not even really registered, but that's now stopped.

Riglan says softly, "Nethza, are you awake?"

It takes a moment... She comes to. "Oh... Oh... Ow! Ouch! Did I fall asleep on my watch? Why are you all down - " and the penny drops. "Sit down", says Riglan, "We've got some difficult news." Temo takes off the helm. "Nethza, best sit down..."

She sits; Maireagh comes over and hugs her right away; we describe the events. Maireagh is doing Cure Wounds, asking if she's OK.

We debate what any of this might mean. Nethza "lost time" both in our original timezone, 150 years from now (so Azalin *was* also gone then, and his departure now isn't our fault?) but *also* in the 2nd time period, 250 years ago, when Azalin was definitely here. So that's that theory gone. Either whatever is pulling Nethza "to ascend" doesn't care about time, or it's independent of the presence of Azalin, but *is* related to It Kal.

Nethza speaks some dark elven and asks if that's the form we heard. It was. **Shadar-Kai** - The Raven Queen. Why would she want that? Temo, history even with a luck point is only 12. Our first encounter with the Shadar-Kai before we found Nethza was them telling us not to interfere. So however it is that Nethza was being drawn here, they didn't want us finding her first and - perhaps - taking her home. They might have assumed that we had the means, or desire at least, to leave immediately if we found her.

Riglan perception, *disadv* - 13 - just notices out of the corner of his eye an odd-looking shadow. Nethza's shadow isn't where it should be... Is that her "protector" shadow we've heard about, the one that disappeared and couldn't enter Citeaux - maybe it can with Azalin gone - so Riglan says in Elvish, "Hello, shadow. Do you protect Nethza?" - it seems to be trying to hide; persuasion 15; it doesn't speak but it flinched. It's not Nethza's actual shadow. So he says, "I know you are there, but you do not wish to be seen. I will respect that. But we may be able to help each other and if you do choose to speak to us, I am sure you can find us at any time."

The shadow slides along the wall into a dark corner. Nethza's own shadow reappears where it should be.

From the corner, there is a whisper - Temo puts on the helm again quickly! - "...can only watch her so far. I can't go any further. It is up to you now to guard her. I should never have come in the first place! But I love her and I don't want any ill to befall her. I think I was wrong. I don't think she should have come. I don't think she should go to the throne. I think that would be bad for her. But..." and it seems to fade again.

Riglan says, "We agree. We will guard and protect. Is there anything you can tell us to help us in that task?"

"Speak to Avacyn."

Riglan nods. "We will do that. We have done it before."

"She will not appear here! The stench of evil is too strong. She is not yet powerful enough to face this."

Riglan says, "We know of an abbey not far from here; that might be far enough. If not, there is the abbey a few days ride away where she previously appeared to us."

Nethza pipes up. "Don't I have a say in this?!" and Riglan translates to Elvish.

The shadow is silent for a moment, then says, "Choice is luxury. Not everyone has a choice. I do not have the strength to stay, but I will try and watch you from afar. It is not safe for me or for you in this city."

Riglan says, "Thank you, shadow. For all you have done."

**"My name is Mark!"**

"Thank you, Mark! We will take it from here."

The shadow just sort of fades; it was in a dark corner, but the darkness is somehow lesser now. We just "feel" that it's gone.

Nethza says, "Wait! What did you just call it?" "Mark" "My childhood friend's name was Mark! My only friend at the orphanage." "What happened to him?" "He died! He was attacked and died. He was only 13... Well, *I* was 13. I thought he was too." Temo says, "Not quite so dead then - seems he's been a better friend than you realised." "But he's never reached out to me." "Perhaps he can only do so here, in the Shadow Fell, for some reason? Who knows."

Maireagh says, "OK - I think from now on, we do watch without you!"

Temo says, "just remember, you aren't alone and you haven't been since the day we met... We will figure this out somehow you just have to trust and rely on us a bit."

Nethza ponders "destiny". How come? How did they find that out? Riglan recalls the strange vision about Nethza's birth; he recounts it, not sure it was her, but it's obviously quite different from what she learned from the orphanage. Perhaps the orphanage people tell people that their parents abandoned them to avoid false hope, or perhaps they were just scared because of Nethza being a tiefling.

We recall if nothing else:

* She was pulled through by spirits that didn't look like the Shadar Kai spirits we saw today
* She was chased by the one other spirit that seems to have been Mark

...and in the end, we're tired; we have to sleep. Temo finishes watch; Riglan follows on. Perception nat 1+10->11! He falls asleep on watch. Understandable, all in!



## Day 22 ("day" 19 in Shadowfell, day 3 of 15-day cycle #2)

Maireagh wakes up, heads out into the main room and wakes up Riglan!

We have breakfast at the Blue Flamingo; we have to know what it's like... The staff are dressed in strange uniforms (50s American Diner) and have strange wheeled shoes (roller skates)! We're shown to seats with blue, white and pink tablecloths. People seem cheery and, if nothing else, it doesn't *seem* forced. Breakfast is eggs, sausages, toast and butter. Great! The eggs have been cooked in moulds and have animal shapes. Temo thinks it's the best idea ever. Maireagh is mortified. "What is *this*?" - Nethza looks, "I think it's a dog." "Mine's a giraffe!" says Temo, excited.

Juice or mastica. We opt for mastica on the whole; it's not too strong. Nethza has juice.

Archives time. There's activity on the street. Carriages moving around. We walk in the direction of the towers of the Archive - not that far. On the streets, we notice riders on horseback - two of them - are being given a wide berth by everyone else. They have "3 musketeers" style hats with a feather and black, oilskin-like riding cloaks and riding outfits. They seem to be patrolling, almost, but don't ride at a slow pace; it's almost a canter. Kargat, we assume. One of them spots our group; we follow the general "avoid eye contact and get out of the way" approach of locals.

They move past, not stopping, but one of them is definitely watching us closely. Riglan says, "I think one of them's spotted us and it's possibly for the Ecrits... Maybe they're just taking stock and will try for us later?" - but then as they get to the end of the street, one of them turns around and tries to return, at a distance, as if trying to stalk us. 

Riglan quietly casts PWAT and we try to slip into back streets. Stealth rolls all round, + 10 for PWAT.

* Temo 34
* Riglan 26
* Maireagh 22
* Nethza 23

Eventually we reach a point where Riglan wants to see if we're being followed. We wait, hiding, watching for the rider. We see a rider stopping at the end of the alleyway, clearly looking for us; they dismount and start to walk up the alley. We hold our nerve. It walks down the alley further, apparently sniffing the air, but stops short of where we are; it doesn't seem to detect us - PWAT is certainly helping mask any smell - it turns around and starts to walk back towards its horse. Just a few steps in though, just when we thought we had got away with it, he turns again; he's convinced we're here, but can't see or smell us... Goes to the horse, but stops again. Then he suddenly casts something, some spell. A low mist starts to roll down on the ground. We figure it thinks we're invisible and perhaps the mist will reveal where we are? But really, we're just hiding. It seems to be watching the mist, then makes an exasperated noice, mounts the horse and trots away.

We wait a moment along, 1 minute, 2 minutes... He doesn't return. Breathe again! We continue down the alleys now, to try to get to the archives.

Riglan says, "That one saw something - perhaps it was even looking for us; but we do look different from most other people."

We reach a square. Grand. Council chambers on one side, archives on the other. Cobblestones, good buildings around it. In the middle, four dead trees - oh, dear. They look like they'd once have been verdant and created a shaded area. Temo pats Riglan's leg in consolation. Benches under the trees are empty, except for one person eating something out of a brown paper bag and facing the council chambers. Two people walk across the square but it is otherwise very quiet.

We make our way around the edges of the square, hugging buildings, towards the Archive. It has unusual, almost organic ornamentation; intricately carved cornices, almost bone shaped. Three large towers rise up at the front with a series of smaller buildings behind, but it all seems to be made of various cigar-like towers or buildings of some sort or another, clustered together. There's a very clear main entrance with 20ft high doors, chapel-style, currently closed. Someone is hanging around nearby, but we can't see them clearly. They seem nervous! They have a hood up and jacket on.

Temo risks it and scuttles out to the strange figure. "Oh! Oh there you are!" - it's Jarrod from the hotel. Temo says, "Oh! I didn't think you'd be here." "You still want to go in?" "Yes please!" "Alright. Come with me!" - Temo beckons the others. We're led to a side door. Jarrod gets a key, opens the door; "Alright. Come in." and we file inside. Jarrod locks the door behind.

It's a small room with a couple of corridors branching off. He goes along one, opens and peers through another door, then gestures for us to follow. "Coast is clear!" "I take it that access to the public is not normally permitted?!" "It is, but it is watched. And I figured based on what you were saying the other night that you didn't want to come in officially..." "Correct. And we seemed to catch the eye of the Kargat on the way here too" "I wouldn't take that personally - they act on the basis that everyone is doing something wrong!"

He points us in a direction to follow before saying he'll head out and come in normally. He also tells us to wear the talisman/amulets we have. So Temo wears one and Nethza wears the other.

"On left of the Main Hall is the Hall Of Records. Straight through the Main Hall and up the stairs will be the Orders Of Authority, which are on display. On the right is the Library."

Perhaps we start with the easiest bit; Orders Of Authority. They're on full display, after all. We head that way. A few people are around; most wear robes, a few not. People aren't making eye contact. Nobody acknowledges us, very focused on what they're doing. We reach the display area, where large glass cases contain big sheets of parchment. One in particular seems to be a kind of carved, almost stone - maybe a strange metal, or something? - affair. "Orders Of Authority, Signed By Azalin Rex". It talks about emergency powers / the council powers, in his absence.

**Steal all this and the council might have no power - in theory!**

There are a few layers, with the council just looking after day-to-day matters originally, but over time that seems to have expanded as Azalin appeared to have spent less and less time governing, giving the council more and more power instead. There's nothing specific about Azalin Rex actually being gone; just things that say the council has power if he has. It's possible that he's even still here & the council are hiding him, but it seems unlikely since he did want to escape.

Once we've read everything here, we go the Hall Of Records to see if there's anything about Azalin departing, or the sky fissure - fragments, the black material, the runes, any of it.

* Maireagh and Temo on the fissure - adv investigation (Temo) 26.
* Nethza and Riglan on Azalin - adv 1,4+0.

There are records about the sky fracture and pieces falling, but there's nothing about Azalin disappearing. We find dates from reports where the fracture was noticed, or at least prevalent, which aligns with records of the explosion at It Kal. That's not too surprising but at least it confirms it. The cracks didn't appear completely though; they were noticed, but grew, spreading quickly over the next 2-3 days before chunks started to fall (and have been falling ever since).

There are filed reports from the outer provinces where they didn't report a fracturing sky but instead report other failures - severe crop failures, mists at the boundary of the domain rolling in closer, entire areas being cut off - patrols finding impassable mist barriers and having to turn back. Villages could not be accessed anymore, entire counties no longer accessible. More and more patrols and units over time seem to be lost. Records like, "Still not heard back from unit 'x' - we assume they have deserted or misfortune has befallen them."

Despite Nethza & Riglan's poor luck in searching for anything about Azalin, we quickly realise that there seem to be *no* references to him anyway here. The records seem administrative, about the running of the kingdom not the king. Perhaps this building won't have much about him anyway.

We move on to the Library. Perhaps the library has more on the whole connection - Azalin departing (if he did), the sky fracture, other domains, Nethza - any references in literature to creatures or beings moving in and out of this world. Even recent references to the Vistani, if any.

* Maireagh and Temo on the fissure - adv investigation (Temo) 27.
* Nethza and Riglan on Azalin - adv 10,17+0.

It's non-fiction here. Council member letters, memoirs and more. It's not a collection of all knowledge of the realms; it's more specific, with certain areas well covered and others omitted entirely.

In recent years there has been quite a lot of writing by academics, philosophers and even council members about what happened and what is happening with the sky, Azalin and It kal, from the point of view mostly of trying to understand why the land is failing (which it clearly is, and it clearly accelerated since the fissure appeared; things don't grow in areas where they once did; decay is setting it; uncontrolled and unhealthy mutant growth happens in some forests and organisms).

Inevitably, there's also a fair amount of worry about how long they have until the farmlands around the city are lost and when stores might run out. How long can they ship food in? That kind of thing. They are clearly aware that the "noose is closing around Citeaux" - a thought that if they ever lost King's Pass, they'd need to impose Martial Law to keep the city under control as the outside world is their only lifeline as local farms fail and the port becomes a useless relic thanks to the encroaching mists.

Some writings voice suspicion; the council holds true power because Azalin has withdrawn to the castle for so long that he "no longer really rules the land". He is still sent exactly what he asks for, as this appeases him and keeps him occupied - he doesn't "meddle in council affairs". Dangerous writings if Azalin cared, but clearly, he didn't care!

Nothing much is shedding light. Things are perhaps confirming what we suspected. Except - then - for one last writing we find, recent, from a council member who met an untimely demise and has half-completed journals stored in the library. He was apparently tasked with recovering any possible wealth that might remain at It Kal, but lost his mind somewhat after spending time exploring the ruins. He "saw the results of bizarre experiments there", beings that are neither living nor dead, though he's sure they wished they could cease to exist! They seemed to be in pain. He "put a few out of their misery". Then there is a report of hearing whispers and voices; reality is hard to understand as the castle is in flux; "One thing is for certain. Azalin Rex is no more. This could lead to an almighty power struggle between the great Houses, for the thing that these Houses have been plotting for centuries has actually come to pass."

"Who will ultimately grasp the reins of power?"

There is a note, "They send me to seek treasure. There is no treasure! The vaults are empty. All of the rare magical items that we delivered over the years are gone. All that remains seems to be in a ritual room; a molten slag of precious metal left behind; the magical essence is stripped."

We're none the wiser about why Azalin's departure caused rot, or at least sped it up but we know that some of the really weird stuff from our initial arrival - kids inside animals etc. - was already underway well before, some 250 years earlier, according to It Kal's Doctor Marsham. We do read that *somewhere* is a ledger that lists the specific items that Azalin Rex asked for. That should be in the Hall Of Records.

We head back to Hall, since that could be significant, maybe. It's easy to find the ledger. Most of the entries are just "things we found that we supplied" but there's a strange list of exactly 3 things he specifically asked for:

* 50,000gp worth (!) of a specific ore, unprocessed (we recall something about that at the gala)
* A glass orb of specific dimensions and material, never handled by people over a certain age
* A metal tuning fork, believed to be in the possession of a descendant of the Orin family, made of a rare metal.

Well, we have *a* fork. Was it *the* fork? What's its significance? A spell focus, Temo thought, of the fork we have. The ledger implies all three items were found and delivered. The final piece - the tuning fork - was delivered just 7 days before the cataclysm.

It seems Azalin tried to find a way to cast something that used the fork as a focus of some kind. A destination. Temo goes digging through documents - adv investigation 32! - the people who were sent to find the fork left a paper trail. They say it's one of two copies of something that *Robert Orin* specifically held very dear. **If they're copies, there's a chance that the one we have goes to the same place.**

Oh...

Maireagh reminds us that the ingot we'd given Robert, which he'd bought back and used to make - apparently - *two* forks - came from Wave Echo Cave. So in that case, the fork would - if Temo's correct - transport you to Wave Echo Cave. Or at least somewhere near there. And if they're copies, than *that* means Azalin Rex went **there**. We *think* we might be 150 years in the past relative to "our world", but we don't really know how time works, so we've no idea if that means that Azalin should've appeared in the past in our world.

In any case, there's an implication that he gets to "our world" at *some* point.

As for whether or not the fork was used for magic, well, as far as we know the fork is not magical. And he asked for non-magical ore; the glass orb isn't described as magical in any way, it's just described as a glass orb (that for some reason, old people can't have touched). So what are those are other two items about? **Maireagh does confirm that these all sound like specific spell components.**

The Grand Archive doesn't have magic books, so we can't investigate *that* here.

### 2pm

Riglan suggests we find somewhere he could try divination, to see if fills in any blanks. Marbery House we figure is only about 3 hours away, so we could head out there but wouldn't be able to get back to the city. Maireagh suggests flying and Nethza mentions the vampires turning into clouds, which gives Riglan an idea - tree travel is not much use when all the trees are dead, but he can learn a spell in the morning that could help us all get back in a cloud form ("Wind Walk").

With that decided we waste no time and Temo helps find the shortest route out of the inner, middle and outer city to the main gates and heading beyond toward Marbery House. Temo figures we'll have to go out of the inner city via the main gates, but since a guard seemed to take interest in us, we spend a bit of time on appearance. Riglan casts Disguise Self to look like a staff member at Blue Flamingo in clothing, but his face is a human from Sungift; Temo can cast a moving illusion, to look taller and similar clothes to Riglan. Maireagh hides the dog in the bag and Nethza pulls her hood over to try and hide her appearance.

It seems to work - whether or not we over-prepared - the guards pay us no attention and we exit the inner city easily. In the mid city, Temo directs us along main roads mostly; we notice one of the trader squares as we go past, with a building that catches the eye. There's a pedestal and statue, noticed by Riglan via passive perception to *look like an older Robert Orin*.

We go closer. It's in front of a building, "**The Orin Trust**"! It is in fact a statue to the late Robert Orin The First, "The Voice Of The Revolution". The building looks closed, as if it has been for a while, the doors are barred; but Temo (passive investigation) notices a few things. It doesn't seem to be fully abandoned; as if it is being used, but on the quiet. Doors are not grown over, windows are intact and so-on. Temo suggests we investigate more - any friend of Robert's is a friend of ours! - and tries to look around the back or sides for passageways, entries, that kind of thing. Investigation very high - 19+14 -> 33. A low entrance behind some apparently abandoned boxes near a cart and tarp, but he spotted it because it's all a bit too clean. Dirt on the ground gets pushed out of the way because the cart gets moved. He wriggles inside and finds a doorway - another cellar - and tells Riglan, who moves the cart, so everyone else can get inside. The door is locked but SOH thieve's tools, 29. Easy. We go inside, and Riglan reaches up and pulls the cart back into place.

There's very faint lamp light coming from the area above. Riglan calls out, not too loud but enough to be heard, "Hello, we are friends of Robert Orin. We're in your cellar! We mean no harm."

Scurrying sounds!

A head pops around a door, holding a lamp. Someone holds a short sword. Riglan raises his hands, the others copy, and we head through.

Lots of kids; a few adults; similar to the abbey, but here, carts and tents *indoors* set up a kind of 'temporary village' feel, hiding lights from the windows of the building itself. The front door is barricaded. Temo points at that and says, "I did wonder how a building such as this could exist in the city, given the current politics and council!"

After some to-and-fro about Robert and the tuning fork, we hear that these people thought it was stolen from a manor and everyone killed. Ah! That would be the other one, that Azalin took. **Tolja** - a small human, or a tall halfling - is in charge here. They have very little, but we ask if we can help them at all. This group to harry the council; the council is trying to seize more and more power; but the council can't heal the land and there's no saving the world without that. They try to convince people of it, to try and turn opinion. Galas, parades, assemblies, speeches by the council are all hollow, trying to appease the populous. They try to expose this.

* They don't know for sure if Azalin departed during the cataclysm, but just know that a huge destructive wave of destructive arcane energy blew apart It Kal and cracked the sky.
* We ask about the black crystal fragments from the sky; we have a drawing of some of the runes. One of the people here used to work in an arcane academy. Abjurative runes; containment and banishment.
* The land had been drained of energy for a long time and decaying up to the cataclysm, but since the cataclysm it is as if the land has no nourishment at all and is collapsing - it's as if all energy has just gone. Nothing left.
* Maireagh points out that the runes *can* rejuvenate the ground and Nethza seems to know a way - unconsciously at least - to restore the land, but we don't know how to bring that the fore. Maybe *that* is the question for divination.
* Has there been any indication in their travels that the Vistani are still around or visible, we ask? Not been seen on this side of the mountains for a long time but if you can make it over what remains of King's Pass, they can still be found beyond on the edge of the mists.

Temo tells his story, acknowledging from the start that it's not easy to believe. They just have to treat it as a story, if that helps.

Hetty, a blind lady, ends up talking of the Sions Of Avacyn; they speak of a new queen of the land who brings back the light. **"For thousands of years, a king of darkness and shadow rules; but when he leaves, the land shall crumble and all hope is but extinguished, until the Queen Who Was Promised, who comes from a broken heart, shall rise to the throne, mend the world and bring back the sun."** Others seem to not believe her and try to get her to stop "speaking nonsense", but she continues. "It is *her sacrifice* to give us life again. Her heart must remain broken. That is the rule of the land. To give us hope - for Ezra, the hope is what she gives up. That is why we shall serve her. Is the queen amongst you?"

Temo is silent. Riglan is silent. Maireagh moves in front of Nethza, holding her shield. Temo eventually speaks up and says, "Our friends are amongst us. If one is supposed to be a queen, well, under the conditions you describe, I hope not! I hope it is someone else. If it *is* one of us, well, we don't know how to take the throne anyway. That knowledge is something we have yet to discover. But if there *is* any way of fixing this land that we *can* control, then we would do so. Do your psions speak of others, who might help, or accompany?"

Hetty says she's never seen it herself. "What is frightening what happens if the throne remains empty. I have not the eyes to gaze upon her countenance. I only wish to feel the light upon my face before I die. The sions live in the countryside; they speak prophecies, they prepare for her arrival, they hold back the tide of shadow." Riglan says, "That much, we have witnessed. That much is certainly true." "They ride against those who feed on life itself. The prophecy speaks - like a wave crashing upon a shore, these tides will turn, when the Queen ascends. We only need to survive long enough to see the first rising of the light."

Riglan says to Hetty, "do you have any buildings that remain in this part of the city, or the outer, that are temples or churches to Ezra and Avacyn?" - she laughs. "To Avacyn? To Ezra? In this city?! No. They have all been destroyed. Ezra is hope. And hope cannot live in this poisonous city." Another scoffs. "Hetty! You of little faith. Ezra lives everywhere!" and there are murmurs of ascent.

Riglan asks Temo and the others to keep the group distracted, via smalltalk and finds a quiet corner with Hetty. He can't cast the ritual here; he's told it'll draw too much attention and besides might not work outside a temple or church. So instead all he can do for Hetty is describe, in as much detail as possible, his encounter with Avacyn. She believes.

Eventually, it's time to go, via an easier exit that they show us. We get on the road and head towards It Kal and the new bridge.

As we travel, **we notice a very bright star in the sky**. We've not seen it before. Riglan doesn't remember this from our first iteration. But then he realises that **there's no moon**. That's quite a shock; he points it out to the others - is the 15 day cycle broken? We won't know until it happens, but it seems we'll have to try counting the days manually if we don't see a moonrise. Riglan spends a while looking, but can't find any recognisable stars here. No common constellations.

### 4:30pm

Eventually we approach the new bridge. Two gate towers stand on either side of the bridge, with light coming from them. There are no visible patrols, so we just march on up. Nobody is on the bridge or road as we get close. Riglan perception 7+10 - there's a light in the gate tower but he can't see any movement. It's strange. He uses Wild Shape to call a fey owl and flies it up there; he looks through its eyes; there's a guard slumped over a table, so Riglan asks the bird to get right in there and have a close look.

It's frightening. The face of the guard - **a look of pure horror**. Two puncture wounds in its neck. Drained of blood. Suddenly, the owl feels a thump and the connection is severed.

"Trouble!" says Riglan - "Vampires. Collars on!"

"We already do" says Maireagh. Riglan says, "Shit" and puts *his* silver collar on. Weapons are drawn. Riglan says, "A vampire's killed the guard and there's something up there still which just killed my owl, but it didn't see anything..." - and with that Riglan calls Summon Draconic Spirit, explaining as it appears, "Dragon has Blindsight - what do you see?" - it takes to the air, and sees an invisible stalker of some kind in the room that floats out and down, approaching the party, unaware that it has been seen. It stops for a moment, and at that moment there's a very, very high pitched kind of screech - Riglan shouts over it, "Best guess is that's calling others! It's down at the base of the tower now, headed this way." "What? Where?" says Maireagh; "Anyone got Fairie Fire?" "No! I mean I *did*... But not now!"

Looks like we're fighting blind. Initiative!

* Riglan (and dragon) 20
* Temo adv. 18
* Nethza 13
* Maireagh 5

The dragon sees another person appear, blood around its mouth, from the ground floor of the tower; largely incorporeal; it steps forward and tries Hold Person on Riglan. Wisdom save is a very lucky 19+10->29 - and now Riglan sees it. Riglan shouts, "That one is new! It's not the stalker thingy!" It looks around and Temo - intelligence saving 16 - saves from a Mind Siphon. Holy shit... Temo senses probing thoughts immediately, which he can tell are trying to cause damage from the invasion, but also trying to pull something from him, read his mind in some way. Temo's emotional state is all that's read; he gets, "Really angry". Temo shouts, "And that thing tries to read your mind and it bloody hurts!"

Riglan drops in the bear totem and targets the new arrival; he uses the lightning wand to see if that works. Dex DC 15; it *just* saves. Half damage -> 8d6 -> 25 -> 12. Riglan shouts, "lightning *does* work but it's quite nimble!" and then it calls back - "There's no point in running. Kargat will find you wherever you go. You have made enemies of the council! You will not live through the night" and Riglan answers, "Wake me up when you've finished talking - we've heard *all* of this before" in his most disappointed sounding voice.

Riglan commands the dragon to attack both with its breath and focus on the invisible one with the other attack. Dex saves, DC20. 3 radiant to the vampire (it saved) and 7 to the stalker. Sadly both rend attacks miss (rolls 5+5, 8+5).

Temo thinks "fuck this guy" - aims and fires at the vampire. Hits, just! 12 magical piercing plus 21 sneak damage. It's looking very badly injured, which seems odd but Temo shouts, "Doesn't seem hardly but probably has other tricks - try for radiant or sunlight and watch out for the invisible one!"

Nethza casts Hex on the vampire and throws Eldritch Blasts its way; 3 beams. Two hit. The damage roll is quite low, and the necrotic components don't hit as hard as she wants; it's still 20 damage in total and the vampire drops. But as he does, he sinks his fingers into the ground and we hear him scream - "Protect the master!" - ah, shit; out of the ground, rising up, undead with fangs and red eyes. Recently killed and buried - ugh. Riglan shouts, "Oh gross - it's just like old times with Danain!"

Temo is close to one - it dashes in. It tries to grapple; he gets out of the way; then it tries claw at him; really, a second grapple attempt; that hits. Temo is grappled. "I hate these things" shouts Temo.

Appearing above the tower is a bat. It turns into a form, some kind of vampire, on top of the tower some two storeys up. *This* individual seems to radiate power; we all sense a shift in the battle at this point - whoever this might be is a **big problem**. Noble's clothes, immaculate, short-cut red dark hair and a rapier at her side. She looks at all of us from atop the tower and notices Temo, grappled; "Ah yes" she calls. "You have been much trouble. My station will be assured if I bring in your body!" - she casts Dominate Person, wisdom saving. He rolls 10, luck point, 10 again! 11 total. He's screwed, but Maireagh sees him falter and starts yelling at him to drown out the commands (Flash Of Genius) - this scrapes him over the line, and he matches the DC to save. The spellcaster is clearly enraged, hissing. "Fine!" she says, looking to Maireagh and starts to float down. "You're next!". She calls forth *five* swarms of bats! They fly out. Riglan shouts, "Oi! That's my trick!"

The invisible stalker sees Temo is grappled and moves in to attack. Riglan via the dragon notices that it is fixated on him and has been the whole time. Riglan calls out to the group, "They're all focused on Temo. Protect him!"

It tries to body slam Temo. He dodges, despite the grapple; it tries again and is successful. 6 damage. He's *not* knocked prone though; just injured.

Maireagh moves around near Temo and moves the dog behind him; she then attacks the vampire that's grappling him. She suddenly shouts, "Oh. Fine! I remember now!" and *does* cast Fairie Fire - "Sorry, I *did* it!" she shouts - and the invisible spectre is illuminated (but the vampire is not). She asks the dog to attack it. It hits, with Arcane Jolt through the dog; 2d6+1d8+5->14.

The other recent-arrival vampire charges at Riglan. It tries a grapple, successfully; then tries for a neck bite - and with the grapple, it easily succeeds. Piercing 4, necrotic 4, reducing total HP by that amount. Riglan would lose concentration on the spell sadly, so uses his cloak to keep it going.

Riglan focuses on the powerful spellcaster and tries the wand again. DC15 dex save. It saves easily, 22->11 damage (a bad roll). At least, again, it takes that damage. Riglan shouts to the dragon, "Focus on the one I just hit!"

The dragon tries to position itself to get both the spellcaster, the previously-invisible stalker spectre and the vampire grappling Temo with its breath weapon. DC20 dex, potential 7 radiant (or 3 with save). The grappler takes 7. The stalker spectre likewise. The powerful vampire saves, taking only 3, but its regeneration ability is hampered. It tries claws - it crits, tho that's a bit wasted; even so, 16 damage; and then bizarrely, yet another crit; 20 damage.

The mage moves in response, crawling down the wall of the tower (!), sneaking away without opportunity attacks, and starts to move towards Temo.

Temo wriggles free of the grapple. He disengages and tries to get some distance. He disengages then runs behind Nethza and Maireagh - "Sorry about this - using you as a shield!" - and the high-level vampire is continuing her advance at this time, getting right up against Maireagh and the dog.

Nethza moves the hex to the powerful vampire and moves into the middle of the bad guys - then uses Booming Blade on the powerful vampire to stop it moving. She just hits; a not great 13 damage, plus 2d8->6 from Booming Blade and if it moves, it'll get more damage. Now the nearby underling vampire tries to move around to reach Temo, causing an attack of opportunity from Nethza who uses Booming Blade again; she hits; it keeps moving and triggers the extra damage. Initial attack does 11, plus 2d8->11 from initial booming blade; then 3d8->15 when it moves.

It's a mess but still up and in front of Temo. Tries a grapple again, which misses because the dog intervenes (else was a crit). Then it tries to re-grapple but that misses again, luckily.

The high level vampire now moves too, again to get Temo. This causes 3d8->11 from Booming Blade, but it's still very much up and tries to grapple. Misses. It moves to flank and tries again, and this works (unshieldable - 26 vs 18 AC).

The invisible stalker slams into Nethza as she's in its way! Both slam attacks hit, for 19 total damage. Sadly, she loses the hex spell from the damage. As the stalker finishes, the high level vampire tries to bite Temo. He deflects the first with a shield. Bizarrely, the vampire seems affronted! "How dare you!" it calls. Meanwhile, Maireagh tries to wrestle the vampire off Temo at this point (with advantage on the athl + 7 check due to the bear totem). 22. Vampire in contest with + 4 and no advantage rolled a nat 20, FML, so beats her; except Maireagh can use her reaction straight away for Flash Of Genius, getting 27, and it works! She wrestles him free - then calls "I'm really sorry Temo, this is for your own good!", puts him onto the dog and tells the dog to run away as fast as it can go. There's an opportunity attack for the dog from the lower level vampire, which hits and does 7 damage but the dog is still basically fine and runs 40ft + dash 40ft, 80ft total.

The enraged senior vampire runs after Temo, Maireagh unable to react as she's already used that.

The vampire on Riglan tries a bit again. Just hits. 8 piercing, 7 necrotic. He holds his spell. Riglan then figures he has to do something about this and tries Produce Flame as a hands-on attack, unarmed strike basically; hits for 11 damage; bonus action, activates his staff. He commands the dragon to go for the high level vampire and spectre.

The dragon only manages 5 damage potential, hitting the spectre for 5 and high level vampire for 2; then it goes in with claws. It gets in the way of the vampire too, to help protect Temo. It misses once, then hits on the next d6->2 only, but that's 11 total.

Temo aims at the oncoming vampire from atop the dog. He hits with sneak attack, doing 32 damage total.

Nethza attacks the nearby low level vampire with Booming Blade, calling out to Riglan if he's OK ("I think so?!") and hits for 14 total. She moves, risking opportunity attacks from that vampire and the spectre, to get right up against the higher level vampire for Hex Blade's Curse. The slam spectre attack does hit, doing another 11 damage but the lower level vampire misses. In return, that same lower level vampire considers its options - move and get hurt, or go after Temo? It decides to hold position and tries to go for Maireagh. The first grapple attack misses, but the second is successful.

Now the high level mage acts again - "How dare you curse me... That is a fatal mistake" it hisses at Nethza. She opens her mouth and a wave of necrotic energy washes out over her. Nethza just saves from the worst of it; it's Blight; 8d8->28->14.

It's taken a while, but suddenly all the bats fetched earlier arrive. They surround the vampire and lift her off the ground; basically, attacks against her have disadvantage; she tries to run; Nethza tries an opportunity attack but misses; the dragon tries too and *does* manage to hit despite advantage, but only again d6->2 -> 11. It's very injured but still up!

The stalker once again tries to slam Nethza. Hits both times; 13, 6 damage. Maireagh, grappled by the annoying lower level vampire, attacks with a Branding Smite; *just* manages to hit; and that is enough to kill it - it burns up with the Smite. She tells the dog to get Temo further away! But Temo says to the dog, "Not too far!" and shouts to Riglan, "Bring the dragon in close to her if you can!"

Riglan gets attacked *again*, being hit for 4+3. This partly heals the vampire that was attacking him. Riglan in response ignores that vampire, calls to the dragon "Get right in close to her!" and tries the wand again, in her direction. She doesn't dodge it this time and although the damage roll is poor, it's still 22 points - the bats around her kinda get fried. The vampire starts to fall out of the air, but as she does she turns into mist; the mist starts to fly away. The dragon immediately goes after that with the radiant breath. It would do radiant 8 damage, the vampire failing a save, but it appears to have no effect. Riglan calls, "OK, never mind, a hand here?!" and the dragon flies in, misses once but hits the minor vampire for 12 after that.

Temo runs in (bonus action dash) and attacks the spectre on Nethza, hitting with sneak damage for a total of 39. Nethza calls out, "That bad vampire's not dead you know! I got nothing back from it" and Riglan shouts back, "Yeah, but we can't seem to hit it now it's mist - it'll be back..." and Nethza attacks the nearby stalker spectre twice with the longsword. She hits twice, for 12 and 12 damage.

The stalker in return, though, now sees Temo clearly and heads towards him. Nethza has a booming blade opportunity attack which hits; she does 8+7 damage initially but it keeps moving, taking another 18 damage. That kills it. "Good to have you back" shouts Temo.

Maireagh calls to Riglan, "Hold it still!" and throws her hammer at the minor vampire that's still grappling Riglan, using Branding Smite and Arcane Jolt. Both attacks hit, the first doing 2d8 + 2d6 + 2d6 + 8 -> 29 damage (including radiant damage) and 2d8 + 8 -> 21 damage. She calls the dog back, which dashes back towards her.

The vampire lets go of Riglan and tries to run away. Riglan tries his staff but misses; the dragon tries too; it misses as well. Riglan throws fire and it is hit, for 18 damage; this burns it into dust. "Got it!" says Riglan.

### 5000XP all round

There are no bodies left, but there are some belongings. Some of the vampires looked recently turned; and we find for one, some merchant's clothing. A travelling jacket, some gold, and in a pouch **a picture of a wife and two children**. Another, who was armoured, carries a key and badge of the City Guard. We take those things, including the gold but we keep that separate. Temo looks at Riglan and Riglan nods - "Don't know how, but we'll need to find the wife and children. Return these things."

We go up the tower to check on the guard up there. He's completely drained of blood; very dead; at least not undead. Temo writes a note. "Witness the illegal activities of the vampires of the Council. They kill guards, they kill civilians; they no know law but that which serves themselves. Rebel!" - he hopes that whoever finds it might be turned to the cause of the rebellion.

There's little else of interest; a roster, a small amount of food in a pantry. We leave everything and cross the bridge. On the far side, there's another tower with light. This time Riglan just walks straight up; signs of bloodshed. A fight here. There's a mangled body, who appears to have been more alert and put up a fight. Temo leaves another note. "Rest in peace, good men; both felled by the evil influences in the council. This must not stand!"

All we can do is continue to Marberry. Riglan Survival 17; this side is more overgrown, as if abandoned earlier and not recovered; estates on the previous side we were on seem to have been held onto for longer before people gave up. Thickets - sickly looking, thorny - grow in what used to be farmed fields or gardens. Spines for leaves. Scaly reptilians creep around. Perhaps snakes, too; Riglan doesn't look too closely. The road is deserted, and we make alright time.

### 6pm

We reach the base of a hill, with Marberry atop. The moon is just rising. There's a cry of some kind of bird; a 'caw, caw'. The house is dark. 3 storeys, turret towers rising on both sides. One side, facing It Kal, has a roof that has partly collapsed.

Two old trees grow on the grounds. They look very sickly, holding onto only a handful of leaves. Riglan looks to the others - "I don't want to, but I have to speak to one of them."

We head up the hill. Many plants have died back here. Looks like there used to be beautiful hedgerows, manicured gardens, fruit trees, perhaps even what was once a vegetable garden based on the rows; all long dead. It's eerily quiet but for the birds.

Riglan approaches what he thinks is a birch; mostly bare now. He casts Speak With Plants and says, "Great tree. How do you fare?"

The response is slow to arrive. It very slowly, creakily, as if waking from a long sleep, croaks out a reply; much creaking and groaning of wood. "A thing that speaks to me! Am I in the great beyond?" Riglan answers, "Not yet, though I fear, perhaps soon; this land is dying." "This land provides nothing. No life, no light; its force is missing." Riglan replies, "We have learned the same thing. We do not know if we can fix it, though we are trying. But it might take many years." "But why do I awaken? I sense..." - it moves slightly - "...aaah! I sense... Please. Please come closer... I sense life." Riglan puts his hand on the tree, but it reaches out towards Nethza. Riglan looks to her and says, "I know you can't control it. Is there anything you feel? Anything you can reach for, that might channel the energy?" Nethza is confused, "What's going on?" "The tree senses life; it senses your power." The tree says, "The sun! Bring it closer! I can't reach it." Riglan says, "It refers to you as the sun! Perhaps - and if you don't want to try I understand, because it might be harmful, we don't know this works - maybe though, try touching it?"

Nethza is hesitant, but does start to walk closer. As she does, her eyes start to glow. She starts to emanate a soft light. The part of the tree reaching for her starts to bud. Riglan says, "Slowly! Slowly, it's reacting, but your doing the 'power thing' and we don't want it to get out of control..." - she stops walking forwards, but the tree livens up; it starts to almost bend in towards her, as if in a strong wind, but bursts into leaf! The parts further from her are still bare, but the parts near Nethza are now in full leaf. The tree sighs - a cry of relief - and Riglan senses at that moment a strange, weird thrumming; plants around the tree start to sprout as well. Grass pushes out of the ground. Some daffodils open around both Nethza and the tree. A few more buds appear on the far side of the tree, which says to Riglan, "Thank you! Thank you... This will sustain us for a while." Riglan says, "I have spoke to others that knew time might be short; some were able to provide seeds, which I can, one day, convey to a place of light and rain and warm earth." "I do have seeds, but - you may have them - but this world, this world is healing. It will heal! The energy that was missing for so long has returned. She carries the life force." Riglan says, "We do not know if it will be enough, or how to use it, for the whole land." The tree answers, "The kind creatures who have looked after me and my sister, who have kept us in stasis, waiting, for the day that life returns; they will know." Riglan says, "The ravens in the human construction nearby?" "I will tell them!" and it rustles its leaves, which echoes strangely. The cawing birds certainly emerge from all over, circling the house, then settling on the tree branches, eyeing us all.

Dim lights, like lamps, appear in a few windows, moving around towards the entrance. The door opens. A very old-looking man, dishevelled, large black cloak hanging over a caretaker's oilskin and a large wooden trunk-like cane hobbles down the entrance steps. A somewhat younger, though still old woman follows behind; then a younger man - mid 40s perhaps - emerges a few moments after. They approach.

"Is it possible?!" one asks... Nethza has stopped glowing, at least. It seems that it was both her and the tree that triggered something. Riglan doesn't answer yet - he first goes to Nethza and checks in. "Are you OK?" "I am... I don't know what I was doing but I was aware this time. I was conscious! It felt very different; not my magic. It doesn't come from somewhere else. My magic normally I do hoping it will work, that the magic will come. But this I felt like I *know*. It wasn't even a conscious thing - didn't even require a force of will - as if I merely responded to someone or something reaching out to me." Riglan says, "Yes, the tree; it was aware of some power, and I think the two of you worked together somehow this time."

The three older people now step in. "Travellers. Visitors..." - the younger man asks, "Do you know them?" to the elders. "No. But I know what they are. You are welcome to what we have. It is getting to a dangerous time of the day. Let's not hang about! Do you trust me enough to come in? I extend you an invitation into the house."

Riglan says, "Certainly. Thank you. Sorry I didn't answer you when you first arrived but I needed to check in on Nethza - I'll explain why as we walk."

As we walk indoors, two big ravens fly in with us. The woman at the door urges them to hurry in! She shuts the door to "keep the heat in". A very small fire in the fireplace in the dining area is the only thing providing heat.

We explain a bit. He understands; "Travellers" is said with a capital "T". He knows about the time shifts. "You have a book for me?" he says - yes! Riglan returns the Raven Queen book. It's put on a shelf, where there was already a gap.

We learn that the council attacked us because they don't want to give up power. We are the "meddling Travellers!" - they've been waiting for our return, hiding in one disused manor or another. There are records of us, starting a couple of centuries ago or so. "Our role isn't to help you fulfil this prophecy; it's to help you with self-determination. Are you weary, or you able to delve into the mechanics of what is going on?"

Riglan says, "I can only speak for myself..." and before he can finish, Nethza says, "Yes - I'd like to get to the bottom of this." 

Food is shared, ours and theirs. A raven lands and transforms - in a rather gruesome way! - into a long-haired, long-bearded 30-something man. Scraggly hair. He helps himself to some food; the other raven stays in bird form, standing on the table. "Don't mind her!" says the woman; "She doesn't want to live with the other ravens - she thinks she's one of us, it's fine" (from which we gather that *this* one is actually a bird for real). The Kindness, then, now numbers just four; times are tougher. Nobody new brought 'into the fold' for a while.

Temo asks about the prophecy. It's not an old one - the creation was about 2 centuries ago, one of the crusader abbeys of Avacyn that started it. Somewhere over King's Pass. Riglan says, "Yes, we did divination there and - you'll have to take my word for it! - spoke to Avacyn herself." "It's taken a life of its own with the retellings! Came into the hands of a poet at one point, quite a morbid fellow though, and that's how we understand it today. So its origins are not old and while not sure, we strongly suspect it comes from Avacyn. The followers of Avacyn - the Riders Of Avacyn - believe it with all their heart. The true evidence of real hope. But! *But...* We also know that it is just one possible outcome. We don't believe in prophecies as spoken. We study their origins, collect artefacts..."

He asks **Lena** - the lady - to continue, explaining her family's role. "I am a descendant of one of the original branches of the Orin family. I came to the Kindness and asked to be inducted into its mysteries. I knew there was a part to be played, for, well... I don't know how much you know about Kindnesses, but one of our roles is to identify, to find and to hide powerful items that could be used for evil." "Ah, yes, your predecessors mentioned that." "Well our ability to detect these items is limited to items of magic. It wasn't until my grandfather's - well, there was a metal key - a tuning fork..."

And Temo says, "Yes, the other one of these!" holding it out.

"...Ah! Yes, you collected that. What you have is what was made some time after the first one, the original one that my grandfather made, was stolen. All members of that household were slaughtered in the process of getting it." Riglan says, "Yes, so you couldn't see the non-magic spell components - the ore, the sphere and the fork." "No. We were always a step behind, knowing only their importance after they'd been obtained by It Kal. We did not have the means nor the might to retrieve them. What's most important is that my grandfather, before he passed, made another of those forks and made it a legacy that it find its way - well, to you! Because there is another side to this prophecy. The prophecy is that Azalin Rex found a way to escape his bonds, to break the containment that the Dark Lords created to encase him and trap him here in this domain; but his presence was what gave this entire world life. With him gone, it is a kingdom without a ruler - but more importantly, **a world without its god** - in a manner of speaking. We were told by the Mother Of Ravens that Azalin had identified a child of this realm, one who contained a sliver of its original life force, that was created through some convoluted pact. We believe that to be *you*, princess!"

Nethza objects. "I am no princess!"

"Ah but you see..." - they exchange glances - "...but you are. Your birth is entwined within a pact that was made, sealed, using a piece of Azalin Rex's power. **That makes you his only descendant** in a manner of speaking!"

Nethza is very startled and alarmed - jumps up - as if she might run - but collects herself; she's struggling to contain it; but - and Riglan, who was attuned to it the other night, can hear them - spirits, voices, crying out, memories of her being told she's evil as she's part devil, a psychic scream almost. **As if her worst nightmares are coming true - a descendant of this utterly evil creature.**

The oldest of the Kindness says "But you are *not* a descendant. Not literally. It is merely that a pact made at some point in your birth was sealed using a piece of his power. We believe that's because either your mother or father made a deal with a warlock." The mother allowed Levistus to impregnate her with a bit of power to keep her alive and that's why Nethza is a tiefling, while the father made a pact with a Warlock - for *his* patron was Azalin Rex.

"We know that you are powerful in your own world and we know that the source of your power comes from the Mother Of Ravens. She interfered - she interceded during the passing of the pact - to prevent you from being bound to Azalin Rex; but she couldn't *completely* sever that connection. Azalin knew the only way to escape was to draw you to this realm and draw you to It Kal. We do not want you to lose hope! But Azalin has been planning this for a *very* long time. We believe our family are unwitting pawns in this game of his, as are you; however, we have chosen to determine our own fate. Even within these constraints of manipulation. So, therefore, we want to make sure that you have as much information as required to make your own decision."

They continue. "It is true. His escape was contingent on you being in this plane, naturally drawn towards his throne - his seat of power - and were you to take that seat you would replace him as regent of this land. **All life would return and things would go back to the way they were. You would rule and you would be immortal.** However... My grandfather believed in free will and believed the reason why he met this 'Temo' of legend is because we all have the right to choose. So he created another - a second key. You could follow Azalin Rex and with whatever means you have at your disposal, defeat him; bind him; return him to this land."

Riglan says, "And is there no other way to save this land? Azalin back in charge does *not* sound like a happy future; things were in decline anyway..." "Things were in decline because he had already started the process. He was drawing on a lot of the energy of the land to create whatever he was trying to create, to break free." "And you have not heard of any way that the people trapped here might be returned to their rightful plane?" "This is where they are from. There is nowhere for them to go."

Temo pipes up. "If we stay and Nethza sits on the throne, I take it she can never leave?" "We don't know the answer to that." "Will she remember who she is and who we are?" "We have no knowledge of any of this. This is all beyond the realm of our understanding." "And if Nethza did take the throne and prophecy was true, and *this* land was saved, what of the land where Azalin Rex now stands?" "That is too far back in time for us to know. There are perhaps some people you could ask who have been outside of this world, who might know of Azalin Rex before he was trapped?"

Riglan says, "Yes we don't understand how time works. How passage of time here, and the jumps in centuries we experience, relate to the passage of time where we came from; if we returned to our *place* we don't know if we would return to our *time*."

They don't know either. Others who might help are again those who have wandered beyond the mists; the Vistani perhaps? That's who they mean.

Riglan notes that the moon behaves differently now. He asks if they know about the Hunt at least being the same. **Beyond the mountains we're told that the moon appears *every night* and the Hunt occurs every time!** Scant information reaches their ears. They're not even sure how much is left alive out there. It is not a peaceful land.

"There's nothing else we can tell you about magic, dimensions and worlds. But if there's anything we can help you with in *this* world, we will of course try our best!"

We ask more about the hunt, over the mountains. "Every night, rampaging hoards of undead, Changed and shapeshifters kill anything that is not safely hidden within a bolthole. We think there is some war out there..." - they're not sure what it's for; most likely resources and survival. Is the Council perhaps behind this, since they mention 'Changed'? We're told it's possible but the Council has consolidated their power on this side of the mountains now. They might have been responsible at some time but what's happening over there by now is beyond the control of any being. Primal forces at work. They believe there is nothing left over there; no law, none to enforce it. Travellers that somehow arrive, surviving that are, speak of mists that come down and devour. If they live through the night, then in the "morning", entire villages disappear or previously-occupied homesteads are left empty.

We could steal the Orders Of Authority papers from the Grand Archives; that would dismantle the Council here. But it won't help *there*.

They note that records say Azalin and Nethza never met. In terms of proximity, it's probable that the moment she arrived in this plane, wheels were set in motion. We can't really stop any of that, then, as it's already happened.

We as if the know of any churches to Avacyn on this side of the mountains, given the mess on the other side? (We're asked why, and explain about Mark, the protector shadow). There's an abbey in the blightwood too. We could return there and try, or we're welcome to try here. There's a small chapel on the grounds tho they're not sure who it was dedicated too; we ask if we can take a look.

It's a small, single-room building in the back garden. Larger than a shrine, with a proper door and a steeple-like roof, but it seems mostly like a prayer room. There is an altar but it is bereft of markings - no telling what is really for. Well, better than nothing; Riglan thanks everyone, asks them to leave because the room is small - except Nethza. Maireagh and the dog park themselves outside. Temo nervously joins her; he wants to be inside but understands the need for quiet.

Riglan starts his ritual, burning a block of incense and asks the question:

"Mark, a protector spirit of Nethza, told us to talk to Avacyn about the prophecy of her becoming a queen of this land; we seek knowledge - the question is - can Avacyn appear to speak to us now?"

It's not well formed as a question, but it's the best he can think of.

The smoke fills the room. A long pause. It then starts to coalesce; a weak presence, but there; winged, trying to convey its form. It struggles to form. "What is your question?" "How can Nethza both rule this land but also not lose herself, retaining all memory of who and what she is?"

Another long pause. The smoke glows a bit brighter. "**It is my gift to you. But it will only be given if it is what you wish. I, as a mercy, can help you forget the life you had that you can never return to. So, you will not know sorrow, you will not know loss and sadness; you can serve your role a regent with fulfilment and completeness. But if you wished to remember that which you have lived so far, then I will withhold the gift. But the land is fast dying. You must ascend with haste if you are to save the people here."**

The smoke starts to dissipate. Riglan (insight 3+10, sigh, 13) senses that Avacyn is only concerned with one thing above all else; Nethza *must* take the throne. This is the role that she was destined for. Avacyn is the embodiment of hope that keeps the people of the land going and she has promised her followers that the throne will not remain empty, that the sun will return, that the land will be renewed. They will live to see another literal day.

Riglan has to take a minute or two to process. Then he says, "If choose to rule, it seems that instead of me outliving you, you should outlive me; but while I live, I will live here, in this land. I will not leave."

He opens the door an ushers in Maireagh and Temo. Nethza is thinking, very introspective. She's considering the options. Temo's face falls when he sees Riglan's expression; Riglan quietly recites as best he can word-for-word what Avacyn said for their benefit.

Maireagh sits. "Well. I know what I'm going to do; but... What are *you* going to do?" Riglan says, "I don't know what we do. We can't just leave Azalin out there, can we? But we can't let this land die. I told Nethza that if she stays, I stay."

Nethza looks up. "That is no life. This is not your prison."

"It wouldn't be a prison. It is a land, wide and broad and it will be full of life and people."

"True. But you will never be allowed to leave."

"Well, perhaps 'allowed' is a strong word. If you ruled, who knows who can come or go; the Vistani were doing it for ages..."

"Perhaps then we should speak to the Vistani, because the runes are designed to prevent *any* travel."

"Yes. They were next on the 'to do' list until - all - *this* happened."

"The land could be saved. But I would take her gift. It would be for the rest of time; all time."

We are silent for a moment.

Maireagh stands. Looks at the group. "I'm sorry. But I have to do what I have to do." Temo "There must be another way. There's always another way. What are you going to do?" "I'm going to find Azalin". She walks out of the chapel.

Riglan responds, "Well, if we can actually time-travel, we don't have to fix this today, *if* we are still capable of jumping, we don't know how that works; the Vistani, again, *might*; they *might* know where Azalin's gone; Nethza, are you OK waiting until at least we've found them and spoken to them? Or do you feel like you should ascend right now?"

"I think I need to sleep!"

Temo says, "It's late. And dangerous. We can stay at the manor, they said; then we'll get up early."

Nethza heads into the house. Riglan follows. Temo chases after Maireagh, persuading her (26) to come back to the house for now. "I need your stupid fork, anyway!" she says and Temo says, "Yes, that's another thing; we don't know how to use it yet! If Nethza ascended right away and nobody could leave, we'd be stuck anyway. So we can't really do anything until we find that out. And maybe there's another answer, another option we've not seen, like a way to get the magic out of Nethza and into the land without hurting her, I don't know. I didn't come all this way to let her go..." - his voice cracks a little.

"Who would know? Who has such power?" asks Maireagh.

"Azalin Rex for one. But to find him, we need the answer already. Raven Queen? She's always hovering around." "She's not allowed in this realm." "Her agents are; they've been here..." "How would they get her in here?" "It's more about conveying information. Maybe. I don't know..." - we're overheard by the Kindness and they say they can convey messages to her quite easily but she has no direct power in this realm at all. In any case, we have to rest; and the Vistani are still waiting; so we'll chase that up in the morning.

(END OF PART 3.6 - Part 3.7 next)
