# Riglan: Part 3.13
## Day 34 - 7pm
### Inn at Saladdir

We *wake up* at around 7pm.

We kick around the complex options, with maps laid on the table. It looks like - if the "likely" futures hold:

* He emerges from the Sea of Fallen Stars into Cormanthor and probably cuts through what appear to be, on them ap at least, extensive forests, towards the Moon Sea
* Zhentil Keep is on the mouth of a river at the Western corner of the Moon Sea
* Thereafter he heads West into the Anauroch and eventually the Shadow Sea

Based on our maps, that last leg of journey looks the longest, implying ~20 days to the edge of Cormanthor and perhaps only a few more days before Zhentil depending on how fast his army moves. It'll gather strength with each place it passes...

* The only thing the Oracle was sure of was him **emerging from the sea in 20 days time** (**campaign day 53-55 ish**), though she doesn't necessarily see *us* there. Thereafter, it's down to best guesses. The more distant the prediction, the more branches of future there are from which to try and choose.

"That's the problem with divination" says Maireagh. "She has to pick the most likely path that time will flow, but it's a guess."

Temo decides to send a Paper Bird to Tearn Hornblade at Silverymoon. "Strong prediction Azalin Rex to emerge from Sea Fallen Stars, Cormanthor, in 20 days. Maybe Zhentil Keep next. Sea Of Shadows guess at 6 weeks" - he sends it off out of a tavern window.

Temo brings up the subject of the fiend; Riglan isn't sure. Seems not our problem, but also very unnatural. Nethza is in two minds - fiends not necessarily bad just because they're a fiend. Maireagh didn't like him from the get-go. We seemed to need him, but now we think maybe we didn't? It was a ruse within a ruse?

Maireagh adds, "If he was just charging people gold, not so bad..."

Temo interrupts at that and says, "...yes! And that's the thing! We paid a price, he mentioned it. But why don't we remember? What did he do?!"

"All I know is what I offered him, which I thought was precious, but he turned it down" says Maireagh. And Riglan nods and says "Yes, me too". Temo looks at Nethza with a sinking feeling and says "Ah... Me too." Nethza nods. "I guess I must have paid it. I don't remember what I offered him and I don't remember him turning it down, like you do. But I wouldn't have offered him anything too important, I simply wouldn't; not something that would jeopardise our safety."

At this Temo looks even more agitated. "But that's the thing - you'd have done the opposite; you'd have offered something very precious to guarantee *success*, possibly - forgive me - even something unwisely so... And the fact you can't remember... Well that scares we. We didn't come all this way just to have you fall to another threat".

Riglan's persuaded by that but adds, "but we are strong enough? He seemed, well, particularly powerful and of a nature with which we are unfamiliar."

Temo says "True, but if we're worried about his spells and his mental abilities and his sway he holds on us - this memory thing - well, what chance have we against Azalin Rex? Consider it practice!"

Riglan chuckles but says "It's not like us to go looking for a fight."

Maireagh says "We could just confront him. See what happens."

Riglan says "Yes, I suppose if he at least told us what Nethza gave? I might feel better then. It's very unsettling to have a blank patch in my memory."

It seems we've reached a decision. And after that, Sembia. We use their teleportation runes, find the delegation, use their support to help alert Cormanthor - without them, we'd just be strangers telling a scare story, scarcely believable.

The barman keeps looking at us and and we realise we haven't even ordered! Lots of juices here, with alcohol added. That's up Riglan's street, if not necessarily the others. We order a mixed four to try each other's, but at that we're asked if we want to try the "Explosion Of Possibilities". "What's that?" "Our best drink! The one we're most well known for. But it is a shared drink." "OK then!" - tho it's 2 gold. Wow. Food is dates and goat stew, fluffy bread. An extra gold for all four (puts the drink price into perspective).

The food is excellent; shared plates kind of thing. We see the barman fetch a big bowl and start to pour all starts of clay bottles of different liquids into it, various leaves, fruit is squeezed, very complex! It is placed in front of us - and we're given metal straws. Riglan gives it a try as he likes fruity things - an explosion, indeed, of fruit flavours. He enthusiastically encourages the others and they all get involved. Everyone notices different things; that seems to be how it works. Depending on your sense of taste and preferences, you get different things from this strange drink. We've never had anything quite like it; a great experience.

Curious breakfast though!

Riglan sighs. "Dark times ahead I fear, but ultimately, I hope, victorious, with many allies at our side. We have more clarity than we've ever had; more understanding; (laughs) more anxiety about Nethza (!)... I hope the shepherds speak again soon. I can't shake the feeling..." (he looks awkward) "...I don't mean this as a doomsayer. I don't meant this badly... It just feels, well, *factual*. I just think that maybe I have to give everything for this one. It feels like a last journey, somehow? I can't explain it. I'm sure I'm just being silly, letting my imagination run wild. It's just - all this undead. All of it. It's so... *Profoundly wrong*. Counter to everything in which I believe. It needs to be stopped. It must be stopped. I can't hold anything back and I can't be afraid of the consequences that might hold for me."

Maireagh does not subscribe to this school of thought! She thinks he's being fatalistic and tells him so. "I hope you're right. I'd like you to be right. And I'm going to do my best to be wrong!"

She says we just need to not do anything foolish. Say, like, picking a fight with a fiend. Well, on that note - time to leave. As we step outside, it's more lively. Small magical dancing lights everywhere. Beautiful the temple is softly lit from below, only the downward facing parts of the cube easy to see, the rest a deep silhouette against the blue-black sky with some traces of moonlight reflecting of snow capped mountains.

"For a desert, this place is very beautiful" says Riglan. "It's a shame we can't stay longer but Maireagh, is there more you'd like to study here? Maybe a book seller or..." "It's OK. We can always come back. This place is quite alien, in some ways at odds with my personal beliefs. I don't believe in fate, with predetermination. I've never really understood - for example, what *you* do when you ask about the future. I don't believe the future is written, whether in the stars, it the mind of a seer in visions... That's me. It doesn't add up."

Riglan actually agrees and explains how the divination is typically quite obscure and seems based in abstract terms on the kind of logic, calculation, statistics and prediction that Marieagh had gone on to describe. Perhaps it's just a different way of looking at a problem that's worked through in the same way.

Anyway, since the townsfolk aren't Netherese and the architecture, while it seems to lean that way, is much "younger" than Old Owlbear Tower, Maireagh maintains that she might come back one day but it's not an urgent thing for now, so she pays for the room. Thanking whoever it seems like we should thank, we walk out the way we came towards the steps leading to the gap in the mountains and the tunnel. Riglan casts Darkvision; Temo uses his goggles.

On approach from this side, we see the entrance is surrounded by many carvings and writing which Maireagh as Netherese. Temo removes the goggles and tries the helm with Riglan's shoulder light to help him see. Inscriptions describe laws and division of wealth, and classes of society... **It seems this place used to be an administrative centre! A royal administrative outpost of the Netherese Empire, of all things, for the rich farmland of Saiyadaar.** It was considered the "food basket" of the Netherese Empire. So we are headed *into* this area, from this outpost's "exit". Perhaps, then, there was a permanent portal here; and that explains much of the cube, perhaps. Riglan understands his vision from the stairs now; it makes sense to be headed *down and out* into the grandeur of what were farmlands stretched out below.

Back to darkness and goggles, we head in, looking for the tunnel and undead. Temo can see pastoral scenes and so-on that carry on along the walls. They're coated; he looks closely; beautiful carved obsidian walls. He tells the party. It must have been quite intense magic to *melt* the stone passageway, turning the sides into glass/obsidian, then further etched with these long-lasting inscriptions.

Perception Riglan 18+10->28. Undead above, crawl down from the roof a little, wide-eyed; but then they crawl back up. They leave us alone. He stops, looks up and says, "We think the fiend beyond might have wronged you. If you understand our words, will any of you speak with us?" - persuasion 13+4->17.

Three slowly crawl down, cautious. One we recognise - it had yelled, when we were on the way in before. Raspy voice, dry. "Yes! Yes! He has. He breaks his own rules! He is not a man of honour. I paid my price, but he was not happy. He wanted *more*. He believed that I had lied to him about what I had of value. On my way out, he demanded that I give him my vision from the Seer - that I trade him my fate - I was given a fate, a fate of happiness and plenty - to marry my loved one. To raise a large family. To live prosperously and in peace; and he wanted it. I refused to give it to him and he slaughtered me, condemning me to this fate and stealing what was meant to be mine."

There's great sadness in the eyes - which for an Undead creature, is quite something.

"None of what I was promised can ever come to be now."

Riglan insight 17; he's telling the truth. Two other stories, too; and as we talk, more start to come down. Some don't speak the same language but there seems consensus - most seem to have been created and bound here by him, which is why they come down - not to attack, but to warn anyone the fiend brings through. If anyone ever walks through here, they usually investigate and if the fiend isn't with them, they'll leave them alone... But undead crawling down the walls can certainly be scary!

Temo says, "There are just too many similar stories for it to be misunderstanding, or misdirection. Do you think if we managed to dispatch this fiend, that these souls would be free?"

The first Undead answers for us. "No, I don't think so. He'd have to return what he took from us. And he can't be threatened, for he can't be killed on this plane. It would merely banish him back to the Hells, where he would start plotting about how to come back through. He's greedy. He wants to collect all that is good - happiness - the things he can't have in Hells. He has developed an appetite for them. He consumes hopes and dreams. He seems most drawn to the taste of hope!"

So, the three things we offered that were physical - he refused those. We have to assume then that whatever Nethza offered was of a more abstract, emotional nature - something perhaps related to a hope, either of her or someone else?

* A compromise. We'll return to town and tell them about this fiend. We're going to try and get it to give back what it took by threatening it with banishment. We can't truly kill it as we cannot travel to Avernus, but we can frighten it and try to convince it to do what we want. If so, it'll remain; they can warn travellers about it, but if travellers refuse to play its game, it might attack them anyway. It's up to the town to deal with that how they wish.

* In town, Temo persuasion 26. They suggest - we deal with the fiend. If successful, they'll "release" (kill) all the undead, giving them their final rest, to the afterlife. We might be able to talk to them to have them do so willingly. Then they'll be able to truthfully tell people that there are no undead in the passage; no need to deal with a fiend. They'll station some of their people at the other end. Should the fiend then attack, it'll have attacked the church and gives them a reason to take stronger action.

* We know it might eventually move on, but we can't solve the world's problems. This is the best compromise we can think of and it seems a pretty one.

So, we return back to the tunnel. We tell the Undead. Strange to have conversations such as this! They agree that if he can return some of what he took, that at least is some kind of resolution, but though for many of them, what he took is just memories now. Too much time has passed. They'll willingly go to the afterlife - but say that if we can't do anything else, it would at least be a sense of justice to "kill" him in this domain and send him back to Avernus!

Looks like we've a fight on our hands.

Temo says, "We'll present him the option first. Return what he took and leave, or we'll fight him. He'll likely not take it, but I can be very convincing!"

### Roughly 8:30pm

We head up the tunnel to find the fiend.

It's night, of course; a small, soft, warm glow comes from his cave/grotto. We approach. He seems surprised that we've arrived. "Strange; I usually sense when people are here..." - he's sat in front of a fire, with lots of large candles everywhere; he's made the room warm; he wears a smoking gown, has a pipe and wears slippers. He has a big glas of some dark red liquid, *hopefully* wine!

Temo says, "You weren't entirely truthful. And you haven't - at least in our assessment - been entirely fair with the undead in the tunnel."

He puts down the glass, takes a long draw on the pipe and puts *that* down, then says - "be careful where you step, Mister Halfling. There are traps everywhere. This is a treacherous road you go down. This is none of your business. I have been fair to you, have I not?"

Temo says, "We have no way to know that, do we? For you took our memories."

"Very well!" - and he waves a hand. We all remember what was taken.

"You see I have been entirely fair with you. To the letter. I safely conveyed you through."

Temo chuckles, "Well, we were never in danger, were we?"

"Of course you were! There are undead in there! Undead! I've never walked through there without being harassed! I protected you! My powers held them back!"

Temo says, "Perhaps you think *we* would be attacked by the undead? But they're actually quite chatty." And Temo goes on to describe some of the stories.

He stands. Shadows grow tall. "Be careful little one! These accusations of yours are spurious!"

Temo says, "And yet, the undead do not attack us. They do not approach us. They converse with us. But they attack *you*."

His shape is shimmering and changing as he starts to take his true form.

Temo says "I have a proposal" and lays it out. The Fiend insists that what he took, he needs to survive. A battle of wits arises. Does Nethza feel wronged? Is it just the undead? She thinks she was misled - the ongoing effects, the haunting; not what we expected. To and fro. It comes down to an intelligence-based CHA check with Maireagh assisting and luck; 16+14->30.

On the Nethza front, he finally agrees to let Nethza have back her "promise" if something else is offered. Something beautiful and lasting, not from Avernus. Riglan hesitates for a moment then halting says - "...a memory. Also it was promise. From death and decay in the Shadowfell, seeds given. A chance of new life. I would give you the memory of the trees that now grow in a grove near our home. They represent the hopes of creatures trapped in a hopeless domain. They represent the promise I made for their offspring."

"You understand that you will have no memory of this? And you give it freely?"

"What of my companions? I will have no memory; what of them? Or others that know of me? Will there be nobody to tend to trees? How far does the lack of memory spread?"

"Your connection is what I will consume. The hope. The resolution. The joy. The connection that you have. That is what I want. The satisfaction. The sense of completion. It will belong to me."

Riglan looks to Maireagh and says, "Like I said - no matter the consequences for myself" and turns and says "I give this freely."

"Very well."

Nethza's promise is returned; her memory, the promise to return and look after people in the Shadowfell.

The *entirety* of the memories of the Shadowfell trees, the planting, the conversations, the sense of achievement... It's all gone. Riglan just notices a sudden and sharp sense of loss that he can't place and actually staggers back a couple of steps. "Wait, what?" says Riglan and looks to Temo. Temo says, "It is done. You did a good thing. Try not to think too much about it."

The fiend speaks again. "As for the others! I have consumed most of them. Scant few memories have not been eaten that I can give back. The others have gone into sustaining my life - my existence. It means nothing to them anyway..."

Temo steps forward closer and says "That is not nearly enough."

(It's grey. The fiend agreed to pretty much everything, but most undead go without any resolution. He can't stand it; he can't go back to them with nothing. They wanted revenge. He'll give it. This is a rare moment of ego for him.)

"Ha! You see... You see what drives everything!" His eyes light up with fire. "You, too, Mr Halfling are not immune to wanting more. To greed! To the hunger. To the desire to have it *ALL*!" and he explodes with fire. The illusions of fire and candles and so-on drop; it's not even a grotto. Ruins of some outpost here, complete with bones of long-dead people, scattered around.

Temo pulls his bow and prepares to fire.

Initiative!

* Temo 18 (dex +5)
* Nethza 18 (dex +3)
* Riglan 18 (dex +0)
* Maireagh thought it was all going so well and didn't expect a fight! 6

Temo needs to get max damage. He's very close. But he has to risk not moving - he aims, steady hand... The Rakshaha has loomed to full size, demon lion face, body aflame; but Temo's righteousness and goodness is conveyed through his magical crossbow bolt which gleams with light, causing searing pain. The 40 points of damage he would expect (were he able to count that) is taken as *80 points* instead. Temo is astonished at this but (arcana 13) the Fiend seems vulnerable to the piercing of his weapon, perhaps in part because it's magical, but also because it's wielded by a good-aligned creature...?

Perhaps it was less ego and more a deep-seated hatred of the opposites this fiend presents - hiding deceit behind confusion, pretending to be lawful but writing its own laws and obscuring them - that caused him to feel so compelled to attack.

Temo says, "You had your chance."

"And you did too, to walk out with your life!"

Nethza calls upon Booming Blade, casts Hex - but the Hex *entirely* fails to take, strange! - steps in between Temo and the fiend and takes a swing. The spell completely fails? Wut? The fiend shouts, "Stupid. Stupid girl! You think any magic can harm me? Me?! Ha!"

Riglan hears that. He activates his staff and tries an experiment. He shoots a lightning bolt from the wand, L3. It hits the fiend and that just seems to absorb the energy; it fizzles out. Riglan shouts, "Yes, he's not lying about that one! He's immune to magic. Plan B everyone!" and backs away but can't go far - he apparently needs to be within physical strike range.

The fiend looks at us all in contempt. "Big mistake. *Huge* mistake!" - it casts Dominate Person on Temo. Temo rolls 15; Maireagh reacts - she shouts something to him, which helps snap him out of it; that gives him 20, which succeeds. Temo smiles - he knew his friends we close by.

So instead, he changes to physical attacks too. Huge claws come out - he rakes at Nethza. The first fails to hit; the second hits - 9 damage, but she gasps and looks frightened, his claws sinking into her, as she's *cursed* - it's quite strong, but we don't know the nature. Temo curses for not having tried Silvery Barbs.

Maireagh has watched this all play out. "Uh - uh - right - fine!" and moves forward, trying to block the way forward to Temo; she gets the dog to move and box it in further; then throws her hammer. It hits, 2d8, but only 2,1 rolled + 8 -> 11. The weapon is magic itself but doesn't deal magic damage, but it does at least take that 11. She gets the dog to attack for good measure; the dog hits, but isn't magical; it would do 8 damage, but the fiend takes none! It seems immune to none-magical attack.

Temo tries again. He aims again for good luck. 35 damage; doubles to 70; the arrow strikes true. The bright light shining off the bolt sinks into the fiend and briefly disappears as the bolt goes deep but then beams of light start to blast out of the body until it just sort of explodes into ash.

All that's left - a pipe, smoking jacket, some slippers and some kind of ornate, painted demon mask that looks like his face!

Any remaining illusion of the room fades. The area around now looks even more decayed and derelict.

Temo, Perception 19. Nethza is looking proper fucked up. He calls out. Riglan runs over and says "I don't know if this'll work again..." and once more tries Greater Restoration. To his *great* relief, this appears to start to work.

She takes some sharp intakes of breath, then starts to breathe more normally. Some kind of ichorous, black, disgusting - well, creature? - seems to spring from the wound, pulling with it tendrils that pull back from under her skin and inside her body. We aren't sure what it was, but it spasms on the ground and dies, then turns to dust. (If we knew - Nethza would never have been able to sleep again; intense nightmares; the curse prevents any form of rest. Exhaustion would set in and within a few days, death).

Riglan just stares at it, speechless. Never seen anything so awful.

At least there's no doubt. This thing *was* just utterly evil. All its arguments are moot. We cannot think on them. It was a master of deception.

Temo puts back his bow. "He'll be back. But hopefully not here. And if he is, they'll be ready."

Riglan is curious. Detect Magic on the items left behind. They're not "magic item" magic, but they're manifestations and creations made of the magic of hope and promise and dreams. He says, "I don't know what we do with these, but the Undead might - let's take them to the tunnel."

At the tunnel the undead are already gathered near the entrance. "We sensed it! The cloud feels like it has been lifted" - and a few gasp, and look almost pleadingly - frighteningly so, with the intensity! - at the items being held. Just a few. Temo holds them at arms length. One tentatively steps forward; takes the slippers; it looks - can an undead be tearful?! - as they dissolve into motes of gentle blue. It speaks in some other language but it sounds grateful... A form of happiness tinged with a lot of sadness, finality. The mask? That's taken by one of the younger undead. He speaks Common; holds it; puts it to his face; briefly, the mask shows the face of a young man with a smile and hopeful look in his eyes. We sense somehow that the soul lifts from the body in that moment. He reaches up, calls out a name; "Mirriel! I come to you at last!" and his form collapses and disintegrates. The others have languages we don't understand but the body language is the same.

Once all are done, Temo says to those that remain, "I'm sorry, but he consumed everything else. That's why we did what you ask and banished him. That's all we can offer." They come forward, apparently thankful; some say as much in Common. They thank us for letting them rest in peace. Temo says "We will call the village folk, of the church, to help you pass. They should be here soon."

We head back into town. The undead gather on the village-side of the tunnel but wait there. Priests of Savras come through, say last rites and use Channel Divinity skills to release them.

They will appoint acolytes to journey outside the temple grounds, to start welcoming pilgrims earlier. They say they're partly to blame; had they not fallen to the trap of thinking pilgrims must entirely find their own way, they might have saved many more. They are concerned that they had not seen this creature, too. Seeing things is, after all, their entire religion! How could their magic not detect him? Maireagh says, "Ah, but the fiend was immune to all magic. I guess, not just for attacking; he's immune to magic completely, so your magic could not detect him." Temo adds, "Vigilence in person will be required in that area - he may try to return. I susepct, when he does, it will be elsewhere - but even so, he might not be the only threat, immune to magic, that you encounter."

They still aren't satisfied. They want to take this to the Oracle - there might be beings entirely immune to magic; this makes them completely unaware. An uncertain Oracle is not someone we want to meet! We bid them good luck and thank them for releasing the Undead.

### 5000 XP each for the village and fiend

Back on the other side of the tunnel, Maireagh is very concerned about Nethza. "You MUST NOT do this, girl. You must not run out in front and put yourself at the forefront of battle!" "But that is who I am. That is my place. Do I let Temo take the brunt of the attack? That would have been far worse. I am - like you Maireagh! - part of the shield that protects this group. You cannot ask me not to risk physical pain and... That's just not who I am. I will not let fear get the better of me. I will not." "I knew you were always stubborn - that's why I like you, I'm stubborn too - in fact everyone in this godddamned family is! - I'll just need more technology at my disposal to look after us!"

Temo chips in - "yes, that's the key. When I was up front, near the fiend, deciding to attack: I knew you were all close by. It nearly got into my head, but Maireagh was there. And she helped. As long we're together, we're OK. We have to make sure Azalin doesn't break that. Because he'll probably try."

### Roughly 10pm

We stand atop the stairs. Riglan remembers, now, when this was all fields. "I don't know how to lead an army. I don't even know how to lead a druid circle. I just know that we'll do this together and do it the way we always do." Temo answers, "Making it up as we go along?" and Riglan says, "Yep! Nethza, do you think you can get us to Sembia?" She nods - "Shouldn't be a problem! Where do you want me to cast it?"

Temo looks around, scuffing at the floor, wondering if there are any runes or other bad areas that might not "like" magic being cast. Investigation 24, he decides the old grotto (which is now just a crumbling ruin of course) might be best and suggests it. We head there. Nethza fetches various inks, some gold and precious gems; she draws a 10ft diameter circle on the ground and inscribes the sigils she was given. It's fascinating to watch her work. She starts to cast; it takes around a minute.

The circle glows briefly in flame, then gets engulfed in shadow. Tendrils of shadow flicker up from the sides and begin to spread, turning into a wall of mist that reminds us of the Shadow Fell. She hurriedly reaches through a gap to pull us all in, before the wall completes; it swirls, thickens and dissipates; and we're stood elsewhere. No sense of shifting or unease.

We're in a big chamber, circular, maybe 180ft across. There are a couple of guards who immediately stand on either side; a third person steps forward and looks quizzically at us. "Forgive me - are you sure you are meant to be here? Who are you and state your reason for appearing in Saerloon at midnight!" 

## Day 35 (sort of, about 4-6 hours ahead of the Sword Coast)
### Midnight, apparently - Saerloon

Riglan says, "We are here at the direction of Ilithylia, 3rd Representative of Searloon, who might not yet have returned from her journey to the West, but is en route" - he introduces his party while handing over her sealed scroll.

"Please come into this room here and take a seat, I just need to clear you - I mean - I won't be long!"

We are taken to a side room and wait, while guards stand outside. While we wait we discuss our options; we figure the Sembian delegation may still be over a week away and we're on a timer!

After about 10-15 minutes the lady returns, quite flustered, apologising because there's nobody awake to process our information! Temo, persuasion 26, tries to assure her that we completely understand given that it's midnight. We're allowed to take a room in the embassy (ah, so that's where we are) for the night, and we're led there.

Riglan, perception 17. We traverse a hallway/corridor. Beautiful soft lighting. The top is 12ft high with beautiful carved fresco, porticos along the side; every now and then is a wall alcove with a sconce where, every time, a statue of some kind holds a light. Floors are stonework with a long strip of marble polished marble slaps along the centre, as one might put a strip of carpet over draughty castle floorboards.

The room is a good size, with windows. Riglan looks out; perception 23. The *fourth* floor of what must be a pretty big building. We could totally escape out of the window if we wanted to - never mind magical flight, there are flowering creepers and all kinds of other handholds and ways down.

The city, though, catches the eye. It is quite beautiful, with what look like magically-lit braziers all around the grounds of the building. Trees are illuminated from below. Roads lead away to buildings beyond. We see over a harbour; the design of the ships is quite different from those with which we are familiar in the West. They typically have two very large triangular sails, reminiscent of the flying ships we saw but these are mostly larger and seem likely to be water-bound. There is still some activity down at the docks.

In the distance, beautiful hillsides; temples, towers, Greek-style architecture - beautiful, elegant white columns lit from below. Lots of trees. Silhouettes here and there of what look like very large, well looked-after trees that give the impression of being protected - perhaps even sacred. Small paths wind all over hillsides to what could be houses. Main avenues have a lot of statues closer by and they lead the eye to grand, all-column-fronted stately buildings in various areas.

Riglan shows Temo the view but low-key he's pointing out all the ways to climb up to the window. We'll need a good alarm. Riglan stealth 15, he doesn't think Nethza overhears (he doesn't want to worry her). Temo sets up the alarm so that we can snooze if we want to, but really, we just have to pass time. Reading and so-on. It's strange to see civilisation at such scale outside and around us; there is temptation to explore, by wildshape to a bird, Temo's Familiar or similar, but we hold back; these are to be our allies, so we should not tempt fate thus.

* Temo reads a bit more about Statecraft
* Riglan gets started on the Primer On The Eastern Empires
* Maireagh tinkers. She makes a circlet - she explains that it has "instant information" and logic; it helps you think more clearly and logically.

It requires attunement, but Temo realises that it could very much help his spellcasting. While Riglan might benefit more from the IQ boost, it won't help him in other ways and we figure we're a party - we only function as a group anyway. So it is agreed. Temo decides to put aside his beloved Wand Of The War Mage and tries the circlet, spending an hour getting used to how it works. The design isn't fancy; it's a kind of headband that even be hidden below the hairline, 80s headband style, with a small contraption on the side that he can touch to receive information.

He likes it a lot, but confides to Riglan - "I wonder, does this make me even *more* sensible and boring?" and Riglan goes, "Hopefully, smart enough to figure out even more insane things to try!"

### 6am

Faint colour appears in the sky. We've had the windows open all night; no alarms and no surprises (as Radiohead might say). We get a feeling for building orientation from this - the sun touches the horizon; not over the water but just North of the waterline over some hills. We are facing South-East. We realise now that we look out over a sea.

Riglan realises immediately - that is it! The Sea Of Fallen Stars! He cries out in surprise, says "I'll be right back" and turns into a hawk, launching out. Adv perception Nat 20 + 10, 30. He sees the true size of this city - it's big, built around three commanding large hills that surround the natural harbour. The port has a collection of ships but, tellingly, beyond it are sparkles on the water; he looks closer; shapes, outlines of several more. The sea is *busy*. Trade lanes, lots and lots of ships.

There are small islands. He ascends more to get an even better view. The hawk's eyesight is astonishing and it's almost intoxicating to get such a good view. More settlements can be see beyond - maybe 20, 30 miles away, perhaps a good day's walk, but they're large. There are beautiful trees around here but it's not forested and sees very agricultural, which is a bit disappointing, if unsurprising. There are old forts; some fortified gate keeps along the roads and what might be tool booths, or security checkpoints? It's still early; the roads are empty; but there's a sense of activity starting up in the city as the sun shines down. It stirs.

He sees what he thinks are main city gates just as they are being swung open and realises that things on the road beyond was queued traffic, which immediately starts to move both in and out. Some farmers can be seen moving into fields. Civilisation here spreads out.

Riglan could stay up here all day but is already worried that we might be visited at the embassy at any moment and he ought to be present if someone arrives! The buildings, though, are so grand - great sandstone blocks and ornate decorations. Avenues have flowering Linden trees along them. There are pergolas, even more statues visible now, similar roofs everywhere with what look like ceramic or terracotta roof files - no wooden singles or thatch that he can see. The fields have in some cases rows of vines, in other cases groves of fruit trees. It's all farmed, though; planted.

Landing back in the room, he describes with enthusiasm what he's seen. It's a shame he can't stay up longer but it is in fact only a few minutes later that there's a gentle knock at the door. It's someone with breakfast! A trolley is pushed into the room by a softly-spoken, slightly nervous late teens boy wearing a cream and taupe, wide-sleeved tunic with a sash belt and loose pants, with sandals on his feet. The trolley has a *lot* of food on it! We don't even have to leave the room. Platters of fruit, bowls of various cereals, a jug of what smells like fresh goat's milk, cheese and more. Quite a change from the constraints of the desert.

We have to try and tell ourselves this is breakfast even though it feels like dinner. At least the *kind* of food feels very appropriate for the morning.

A while later, a louder knock. "Good morning! May I come in?" calls a voice; "Of course!" calls Temo. A middle-aged human lady with hair tied up in a bun, with a tidy, professional look, comes in. She wears a button-up collared shirt with a vest jacket over the top and a pair again of loose pants, brown coloured this time, but with leather shoes rather than sandals. She holds a stack of scrolls under her arm. She pulls one out; Temo steps forward; she hands what was in fact Ilithylia's letter back to him. "You are of course cleared; I'm sorry for the inability to process this lsat night, there was simply nobody working. Everything is in order, you don't need more paperwork, as that scroll was an official invitation from the Third Speaker. So! Welcome, to beautiful Searloon, The Library Of The South. I welcome you to enjoy everything that our city state has to offer."

She steps back and beckons us out. "I'll show you to the main chambers at the entrance". We thank her but as we walk, Temo asks, "We do unfortunately have some rather serious business that we need to discuss at what might be quite a high level but we don't know how the politics works here..." - she pulls out a smaller scroll, parchment wrapped in twine; she hands it to Temo. "You'll find here directions and a map of the Administrative Quarter and I've taken the liberty to mark the location of the Third Speaker's Estate. I'm sure everything you are after will be sorted out when you get there." We can also come back to the "Embassy Of Arrival" if we have anything else we need.

We decide we'll head out, welcome to get some air. We're led out of the wing we were in, into a main hallway; we reach a four-storey high foyer. The entranceway. It's *very* grand, with a beautiful two-storey high sculpture in the middle and marble stairs descending down the sides from the various floors, with many plantings and even small trees in pots. Tall, narrow glass panes are set into the building's facade and the main entrance is full height double doors that look like they're probably old oak. There's a terraced amphitheatre feel of the floors that drop and wrap around the giant sculpture; an older, bearded man holding a staff in one hand and an open book in the other. Riglan asks, "Who was that?" "This was one of the great travellers who made a very lasting mark here in Saerloon, at least. We call him **Elminster The Sage**, who established this as the doorway - the conduit - between cultures."

Out, onto the streets. "Damn", says Temo. "This would be quite a place to explore under different circumstances." Riglan says, "We've been to Waterdeep, but this feels different especially from the air. It's just - *rich*. Extremely wealthy, the whole city, not just a few people. I don't doubt there is inequality, but it seems like everything is just on a different scale. The more we learn in the East, the more I understand the ways that they describe the West."

It's almost like a parent who has a child that's growing through a difficult age of feeling they know how everything works; they'll get there, eventually! Not hatred or rivalry - more patience and understanding.

Most people wear quite light clothing and we feel at home in our desert kit, even though we're not as well-dressed as the light clothing we see in the population! Golden circlets, braided silk belts and so-on. Our clothing is not quite up to that spec, but it is at least new, clean and in good condition. We don't feel *too* out of place. It helps that we start noticing a fair mixture of cultures - as we wander into a public square.

It's large, commerce happening. A morning time market of sorts, stalls mostly around the edges. There's a central fountain and music is being played. A couple of people in white robes that seem to be preaching something. Orators, of sorts. Riglan's relieved but surprised that they seem to be using Common, albeit with some unfamiliar words - though they're unfamiliar words that have a "Common feel", almost a more complex form? It's accented. Must be related... Temo wonders if it's a predecessor form. He puts on the Helm to see if he can verify it. Now he understands the words we don't. He gets it. There's a context, a relationship; root words, older. This is at once a more evolved, yet more ancient parallel branch of the same root that formed what we call Common.

### 7am

"Do you think it's too early to try this estate?" Maireagh says, "No harm, we're here for a reason! And the sooner we do it the more awake we'll feel..."

We use the map and Nethza is unafraid to ask directions, but Temo keeps a hand on his Sling Of Warning. His guard is up the whole time; he feels very defensive. There are guards on patrol with headdresses - helmets with a plume on top. The armour is split, but skirt style, above the knee; mobility and heat control, presumably. Light cloth underneath but full breastplates and greaves.

Nethza says to Riglan, "I like this city! We haven't been here long but no-one is looking at me the same way that people look at me in other cities we've visited. Villages and towns especially. I don't feel different."

Temo just stops abruptly and says, "I do understand and I know how you felt before you met us. But that's still a very sad thing to here."

"It doesn't bother me... It's just interesting when you notice it's not there."

Temo nods, "But that's a form of bothering. I hope we find places that aren't like that. I guess - Deepgarden Keep - well I *hope* - feels similar, because everybody knows you?"

"Well yes but everyone treats us differently anyway. But that man I asked for directions - at no point did he... Assess me."

Riglan for a big tree, as he hears all this. At an intersection, there's a beautiful old olive tree. He calls the group over and spends a while getting to know the tree, even talking to it briefly; it speaks slowly. But when that's done he turns to Nethza and says, "If nothing else, we can return here now whenever you want. This tree will help us." After a thought his face darkens a little. "And that's another reason to stop Azalin early. We don't want these trees dying, or these people."

We approach the estate, which is at a t-junction where three roads meet. The gates are large, stone and open; there's a stone wall about 8ft tall which Riglan can just about look over if he stands on his toes. There are many carvings along the top. There's a short walkway from the gates to a roundabout surrounding a fountain in front of the main building with beautiful mature olive and orange trees lining the road and, at the fountain, a ring of taller willows. It's an old garden.

Gates are open - so we walk on up. Some people working in the garden look up at us and nod. Nobody challenges us. Someone descends from the front doors, down the steps and works their way around the fountain to greet us. Light blue, short-sleeved button shirt, the usual loose pants; short haired, 30-ish male human, olive skinned. "Good morning! Do you have an appointment today?"

Temo explains briefly about the meeting the Third Speaker in Yartar etc., but is interrupted by the polite man who seems a little embarrassed - "I'm just the door man! Let me bring you to someone who can help."

We're brought into the main door and down a gallery, 6ft high tapestries on either side, then to a room on the left. Chateux style, floor-to-ceiling doors and windows, lots of natural light; curtains drawn back. We are ask to take a seat. "I'll get the Speaker's Assistant for you."

Very soon after a woman arrives. She has long light brown hair with braids tied back as if a circlet but the rest hanging down loose, with a flowy over-shoulder drape of fabric that is kind of a cropped top style, with trousers on below. She has many bracelets and rings and a necklace that fits the curve of the top.

She looks and thinks for a moment then says, "You wouldn't happen to be Mr Smooth - um - Hands, would you?" Temo chuckles and looks surprised, "Indeed I am!" "Ah! One moment." She holds up what looks like a small eyeglass on a stick and holds it to him. He recognises this as some kind of truth verification device. "Would you mind saying your name again?" "Of course!" says Temo and complies.

She introduces herself as **Mara**.

The Speaker isn't here, probably a week away, but she sent a message forward with instructions. The subject of how we got here so quickly comes up; the runes; Nethza is asked if she's studied them? Yes, she had to in order to use them. "You wouldn't mind if I ask for the physical copy back, then?" No problem!

We're ushered into a large office with lots of books and several seats, but it's not heavy; it's a light, airy design, with a white table of elegant design and chairs that pull out from under.

She fills us in on news of what happened since we met the speaker, roughly 10 days ago; Riglan checks his diary; about 9 days, he thinks. The Assistant says, "Ah, just over a week ago". So then there's some confusion about weeks - and we suddenly realise that their weeks are shorter than ours! Sword Coast weeks are 10 days; a different calendar; her weeks consist of 5 working days and 2 rest days. So Temo asks if that means the Speaker meant 14 days for her journey, rather than 20 as we had assumed? The Assistant thinks so; so that's on the one hand good, since the Speaker may only be 4-5 days away. On the other hand we realise with an amount of horror that we never asked the *Seer* how long her weeks were. Riglan hastily checks notes... He finds a point where the seer said 20 days, then 2 weeks. So we think that she was speaking in terms we'd understand.

* The Assistant gets down to the matter of news. Glyphs are drawn and a now-familiar curtain of purple light descends. Outside sound is silenced.
* "I gathered together as many credible reports as I can. Ever since the threat reared its head, the Third Speaker has taken it very seriously. She was in her time an academic, and as an elected member of the Council, always continued her studies as a historian - she sees patterns!"
* Sheets of paper are laid out with all kinds of links drawn, inferences made, notes written alongside maps and reports - "Highly credible", "Very likely", "Folk tale?" and so-on.
* The Assistant goes to a wall and moves a shelf of books aside, which seems to be on wheels. There's a big map of the area there - quite different in scale from our map. There are stamped wax circles that correlate to the various events described.
* So far, everything is East of the Moon Sea.
* "Here's the bad news" she says. "These dots are what we tracked *before* the speaker left." Then she points to a stack of paper on the table. "These, I haven't placed on the map yet. So the influence of whatever this entity is has crossed into Sembia. We are now receiving stories from shepherds and travellers, merchants and scholars in the outer reaches of the Confederate States."

Riglan takes a deep breath with wide eyes and says, "That means Alazin Rex's influence extends at least some 20 days ahead of him at the speed he currently travels. We have reason to believe he will emerge from the Sea Of Fallen Stars in maybe 18 or 19 days from now..." We explain about the Oracle.

She'll spend some time gathering together the new notes and plotting where things happened on the map so we can try to see if there's any clues about where along the coastline that Azalin Rex might emerge.

We need to do something in the mean time. Cormanthor is an independent sovereign nation. She can't speak for it. We probably need to find a way to get "in" there. There's an embassy, but there are also circles of merchants, if we want practical advice for how some of the Elf Halls of Cormanthor might operate. We need *some* angle to get in there and be believed, despite them not knowing how we are at all. The Court has been rather insular since the second fall of Mythrandor; it's just a set of well-known cycles of openness and insularity, ever since the First Retreat (7-8000 years ago).

This also isn't the capital city. That's **Selgaunt**, where the Senate sits... They should definitely be told, since they're right by the sea and Azalin might emerge there! She says we should certainly tell them. Searloon has fast modes of travel, we're told; their flying ships could get us there in **only 3 hours**! And we're offered access to that - in fact: "*every* Sembian citizen has full access to all of the state's services, including the ships; and as a guest of the Third Speaker, all of the privileges of the citizenry are extended to you". Temo raises an eyebrow and says to Nethza, "Maybe we *should* live here!"

We say we'll probably:

* See what they say at the Cormanthor and Cormyr embassies here
* Perhaps travel to Selgaunt *today* and see what they say there!

### Not quite 8am

Having shared all the information we've each got, and with directions to the embassies in hand, we bid farewell and try our hand at Cormanthor embassy first.

Temo has an idea where to go, but takes something of a scenic route as it's so early in the morning so we figure there's no rush (they might not even be open yet). We're headed towards the north edge of the city. It's close to a district which seems to be all about  cemeteries, parks and gardens; we're on our way **Elvenholme**, the residence of an ambassador representing both the *Elven Court* and *Semberholme*, the names of the two current large "political settlements" in Cormanthor. It's a kind of old monarchy with two heads of the "nation". We don't know which of these two we should be addressing; possibly both; which is part of the reason for going to this ambassador, to try and get a feel for things.

The house is in a slight dip in the landscape surrounded by a lot of trees. It's in the middle of what a sign declares to be "The Gardens Of The Alliance", apparently planted, tended and gifted by the nation of Cormanthor to the State Of Saerloon (there is a date 725 DR). Riglan comments, "that's interesting; different calendar, like, different weeks; but same years". DR; Dale Reckoning; Riglan's tribal upbringing meant he never really referred to years that way and, subsequently, hadn't really given much thought to "DR" other than it being a kind of label - almost an affectation. **But now, we see on the maps that there is The Dale Lands, and Elminster was the Saviour of the Dales. So some event there might have started the annual calendar that the Sword Coast also adopted historically.**

There are some beautiful walkways in between the trees, but there are lots of groves with much older trees - probably many of them are original, some 700 years old if so. Grand canopies, cork oaks, thick stumpy trunks that only go up maybe 10-12 feet but then spread out into very wide trees. Beautiful pines too, very tall; and in the middle of it all, a very elegant wooden building wrapped around four of the oldest pines. Very Silverymoon (albeit in wood, not stone)... Looking closer, this building might have been grown. So less Silverymoon perhaps and more High Forest. Like the villages we witnessed, but on an even larger scale.

Of course; Cormanthor is a nation of wood elves. Our history with the wood elves might be an advantage here, though it was not in Silverymoon.

People tend to the gardens, apparently often using magical means. They walk freely on branches, no walkways or handrails. One drops from a branch onto the ground and says, "Halt, traveller! You have wandered into Elvenholme. Did you intend to cross the threshold?" Temo says, "Yes, but we intend no trespass; we seek an audience". We're warned that a threshold - a line of mushrooms! - means we move into the nation of Cormanthor, not Sembian ground.

The elves are dressed with tight-fitting garments for mobility. It has a familiarity to it. We're welcomed and brought in between the four trees and onto a gentle, spiralling ramp that goes around the outside of a central structure; it brings us into a high, arching entranceway. There are sofas, some tables and some people sat in box window seats.

Riglan introduces himself in Elven, and talks about having travelled amongst elves of the High Forest, assisted them in trials of fire and how he hails from Shadowtop Cathedral. At this point, insight 10+10 - an older elven man near a table shows some flickers of recognition, but not must investment - *until* the mention to druids of Shadowtop. A willingness to entreat. He introduces himself. "I am **The Chosen Of Illistriae**. I welcome you, druid of the High Forest to the realm of Cormanthor. Although it has been many generations, we share a common blood to the First Retreat with the wood elves of the High Forest. What brings you this far to the East?"

Dark tidings, sadly. Riglan talks about Azalin Rex (pronouncing it as best he can Eastern-style). They remember. But it's been many years since he was dealt to... We say that sadly not. We explain briefly. He looks concerned, but there's also a clouding of openness of his demeanour; some other elves in the room stand and a few excuse themselves quietly and leave... That puts Riglan at unease. The elf steps forward, crosses his arms and says, "It is no trivial thing that you bandy about." It's not so much disbelief; he's trying to assess who we are and why we posses this information. What are our intentions and so-on.

Riglan starts to explain the story, including showing the feather and the story of the Dark Powers. Riglan talks about how Azalin looks set to carve a path through Cormathor itself. Insight 15+10, he's listening for specific things; he seems uninterested in that statement. At this Riglan would be surprised and just ask. It's about lives. They just lost 200,000 elves (!) in a "recent" war and don't want to lose any more. Things like this seem to happen every 4, 5 decades (!) anyway, so their response would be to just evacuate.

Riglan can only sympathise with that and say that yes, if that's their best approach, then that is what they must do. A lady has been listening, she comes over and says "We appreciate you coming to speak to us" - as if in the big scheme of things, this isn't too important. That's surprising, since if Azalin Rex did rise he would become an unstoppable wave of death, but they don't necessarily believe the importance is the same as we believe it is.

Riglan finally gets a chance to ask about the war - 200,000 lives lost of any race is horrible. She weaves an illusion. "You've never set eyes upon Cormanthor, have you?" "No" "This *was* Mythdranor". There's a truly glorious city, the most beautiful Riglan has ever seen, set in the hearts of woods; gleaming with crystals, precious metals and wood, woven around very ancient stonework, as if a city was built, a forest grew over it but they coexisted and grew together. "Here - here lived more than 3/4 of the entire Elven population of Cormanthor." She shows a scene of a floating city. "And that you must recognise is **Tulthantor**" - we didn't know that name, but recognise the Netherese city. "With minor assistance from the Cormyreans who held it back from the West, and the assistance of our distant relatives in Evereska, Tulthantor was held back and drawn into a protracted siege of cities with Mythdrannor, our capital. You *must* know what happened next?" Riglan nods; from the Evereska paintings. The crashing down of the city onto the other. "This is what happened barely six decades prior..." - the fusing of the mythil, causing the collision. "*This* we did to protect everyone west of the desert. Even if I *did* have any royal authority I would never weird it such; there is no world or reality in which the elven court would lay any more elven lives down. It simply would not happen! We have lost and given and sacrificed enough."

Riglan can only sympathise. He explains why we're ignorant; the information is withheld because we're just too warlike and childlike to be allowed knowledge of what happened.

Much to and fro. They might:

* Be able to help give us information on people *they* have some respect and trust in Cormyr / Sembia.

* She wants to be able to ask other people ASAP to verify the veracity of our claims.

* We ask about areas that would be worst if Azalin Rex ploughed through them. Our maps don't really show where Semberholme or the Elven Court are; she points those out, so at least know the major population centres and can - if we have any control at all - try to steer him away from them. "Should this threat materialise what would be more important would be for us to know where to evacuate people out of."

* But Cormanthor is indefensible, she says. It's just a forest; no fortified cities, no walls. You can't "defend" a forest.

We mention he's headed to Zhentil Keep. They're confused about why he'd go there - **it's nothing but a mass graveyard.**

Oh, no. That's why he's going.

**"Seek us out again if you have something solid of a plan! Something that... That I can take to Elven Court that would be taken seriously."**

This nation - it feels like the last stand of a fading nation. Great nobility, but a people who know their time is passed. They're faded, and they can't stop that. They want to pass gracefully and with dignity.

The oracle's vision? If their armies stood with us, then that would not be their best defence; it would be their last stand. The death of a nation. The context is changed; the vision of the elven warriors marching into battle with the nobility and standing of people who are *fighting one last fight*.

**We can't let that happen, can we? There must be another way.**

We face him alone on the shores of the Sea, if we face him at all. But at Zhentil Keep, there was an army. And the elves were amongst them.

We depart, with very conflicted thoughts. The dilemma tears at Riglan, his ears flat down against his head the whole time. His unhappiness and conflict is not hidden. We're just beyond the mushroom threshold when he just bursts out with, "We just can't let that happen! We can't let them do that."

Maireagh says, "what?" "The oracle's vision. If it's true, somehow, some way, they end up helping. Their army is at Zhentil. And whatever we do when we meet Rex at the sea, we fail to stop him. So we have to succeed and stop him! Or find a way to stop him at Zhentil but without the elves. We'd sacrifice an entire nation." "But there's no way they'd do that. You heard her." "But you remember that vision? Do you remember how those elven warriors carried themselves? It seemed - almost pompous at the time. But now I get it - one last stand. One last fight. The end of everything. We've felt that ourselves. We've stood that way ourselves." "Now, don't make me feel bad about elves! I've got enough on my plate worrying about the four of us without adding an entire nation to the list." "Maireagh! You know that the elves and dwarves isn't as black and white as either side makes out. And besides, we're worried about the for of us for sure, but that's mostly to keep ourselves sane because what we're *really* worried about is..." - he gestures vaguely and Maireagh completes his sentence; "...everyone."

Nethza looks sad. "Chin up everyone", she says anyway. "We have to talk to Cormyr. But maybe we need a break before that? Maybe we're a bit too depressed to talk to Cormyr right now!"

Riglan hesitates at the threshold of the garden at those words; "I'd sooner stay amongst the trees to heal, but I fear no comfort from them today. And while we could find some food or drink, it might feel - trite?..." "hollow?" "...yes - to just sit and drink and pretend to be happy. But maybe if we just walked the city streets, saw the people, reminded ourselves who they are and what we are. We might find a strength again. I don't know. I've - I've not 'been here' before. I'm not sure how to tackle it."

Maireagh says "It probably doesn't help their outlook that their gardens and embassies are in the cemetery part of the city!" at which Riglan goes, "Oh, *fuck* - yeah, we'd better find a way to get them to move people away from there, if it looks like Azalin's coming anywhere near here. Otherwise the first casualties could be the ambassadors; cut off coordination, cut off communication."

So we wander the streets a while. Northern hills have pretty houses, but quite a few trading houses; a big section of a street has various beautiful, grand, portico entrance merchant organisations. Trading houses. "They did say we should talk to the traders..." says Temo; we're north of the docks, the warehouse districts; "...but what do we ask them?"

We're on the "Boulevard Of Coin". Whatever *that* means. Temo without warning turns abruptly and walks into the nearest building. One of the grand buildings. We all have to scuttle in behind, caught unawares.

Temo walks in. Beautiful brass plaque atop. "**Faramo And Sons** / Fine Traders Since 1168". Inside, there's a gentleman sat behind a simple marble table. Temo walks up, "Good day, sir!" "Good day" "We're new to the area and were wondering about the functions of some of these trading buildings!" The man is taken aback a bit; these are offices of the major merchant families. They comprise the fabric of Saerloon, in his words; "We are the engine that keeps this city ticking. We are the backbone of its economy." "You must gain a fascinating insight into the region's politics and how its various nations and states interact?" "We try not to get *too* involved in politics, although everyone really in Searloon - in Sembia! - is involved in politics. Where are you from?!" "Far West! Sword Coast." "Oh! You've come a long way."

He describes their system of governance, essentially democracy. The Sword Coast doesn't have that. Some nations around here though do still have monarchies. Sembia itself has had a senate for some 7 centuries!

Conversation goes back and forth, a little rambling. On politics the issue of the Senate in Selgaunt comes up. An older man turns up - the Fourth Faramo, one of the sons - "I will tell you this much. There is a strong rivalry between the two cities and as much as we baulk at the stereotypes, they exist for a reason and it helps to understand what to do. They say that Saerloon is nothing but a crass city of trade and mercantilism; that we prize and worship coin above all; that trade and commerce rule the day. That's true to some extent but we look after our people. The same criticism levelled at Selgaunt is that it's a city which is a mechanism that revolves entirely around the service of the Forum. Instead of merchants there are guilds of logicians and tacticians and masters of oratory and speech writers and demonstrators! They think we're uneducated fools here, but we pay for all the excesses of Selgaunt."

He's suggesting we go to Selgaunt to ask around and find the tools for success in the Forum there - the advocates, the orators and so-on. We hire people to speak on our behalf, or write our speeches or some such. Give us the tools to increase our likelihood of success... To sound the way that achieves the result we want. Meet the right people, gather enough cross-forum support.

Temo replies after all this, "Good advice, thank you! Such advice should be paid for; do you like wine?" "We trade in wine! It's one of our specialities".

Temo produces a bottle of the Waterbaron's "good stuff" wine from her cellar. "I have customers who have an unhealthy obsession with wine from cold climates!" They are only able to trade occasionally that far west. Temo suggests that we might be able to get cases sent when caravans head East; we're given a form of prospectus - "We're always looking for opportunities, especially from the West. The trade routes across the Sea Of Fallen Stars are very well established and largely divided up, so the wild frontier of the West is very appealing to us. Exotic items!" - Temo hands over two bottles, as samples.

So, when we're back in Yartar, Temo should set that up.

Perhaps it's time to tackle Cormyr. Temo figures out the route and leads the way. Their embassy is in the South-West quadrant, so it's quite a walk; we go past the centre of town. Temo keeps his eye out for a square with a centre area where musicians might play (but or not playing). We pass what seems to be a sort of true centre - a 40ft high arch that seems purely decorative, and old gate that chariots might ride through. Arc De Triumph / Brandenburg Gate, but without statues on top - just carvings all around the sides. It's got a lot of ivy growing and is on a raised central area that the road moves around. Within the middle there are some stalls, and a stage in front of a gate. There's nobody performing though some boxes are just being cleared as if it was just vacated. Temo points and says to Nethza, "There. Let's cheer ourselves up there" and heads over the road. Official-looking buildings are around; maybe a bank, a library, that kind of thing, on terraces head. Behind is large building, the "Grand Central Market".

Temo produces his fancy lute and looks to Riglan. Riglan produces his horn. We look to Maireagh and Temo says, "Light show?" "Fine!" and to Nethza, "Fire dance!" "OK" - but Maireagh borrows Temo's drums too. Temo performance 20 via RT, Riglan 16-1->15, Nethza 21, Maireagh just drums in time (intelligence-based check) - 17. It's fun to play and dance; we haven't done this ages. In fact as we play Temo calls out, "You know, I don't think we even did this after our last travels ended - we were too busy with the school and gardens and tower!"

At the end, there's polite applause. We perhaps didn't bring the house down but people seemed to enjoy it and more to the point, it was about us. Someone waiting in the wings is holding a pack and a small box. He's probably up next. Temo nods to him and we vacate.

Riglan thanks Temo. "It helps a bit. After you stop, you remember it all again, but it doesn't feel quite so bad as it did before."

Onward; the market is tempting but we're not in a shopping mood. Maybe we'll remember it for later... For now, Cormyr. We are on "Champion's Avenue". A large building is positioned at the end of this road at the base of a two-tiered hill topped by some beautiful towers and a rotunda with gardens; but at the foot is this large, almost Colosseum-like building. A sports ground or arena? We were told that the imperial representative of Cormyr is located along this avenue. Temo, investigation 32. It's not hard to spot a building that looks rather out of place! A beautiful wrought-iron fence, with meticulously created wrought iron relief sculptures of dragons and knights on horseback, with gold plate for things like spear tops. Beautiful manicured gardens lie beyond. A curving structure above the gate shows another two dragons meeting over the top, painted purple. Two guards flank the entranceway with a driveway that leads to the main entrance, with stone statues of knights on horseback rearing up, positioned on either side.

### 10am

"Good morning" say the guards; and we explain that we're hoping to speak to an ambassador representative of Cormyr (we show the Third Speaker's seal) - the guard says, "Ah, a diplomatic conversation!" We're allowed in. Everyone here is in full plate armour. Pretty intense. We're led up this driveway to the grand entrance. Big banners either side show the lion flag of Cormyr. The doors are 16ft high, embossed in gold, statues of military leaders... There are beautiful painted ceilings, polished marble floors... Very full-on indeed.

We're led to a side-room. There, standing at a window as if contemplating, is a man in faux military dress. A general or something. A rugged, slightly scarred face; probably was in active duty once! "Good morning!" - he introduces himself as **Danthalus** - "you requested - well, I understand you come bearing the seal of the Third Speaker?"

What we have to say can only be taken at face value as we lack physical evidence, but we get into it; and it turns out the Third Speaker had already spoken to him prior. "I said to her at the time - as mighty as the empire's navy and armies are, the emperor is cautious and wary of committing to another war so soon after the one previous." "Ah, that would be the one at the Well of Dragons?" "No, no that was interesting - the Purple Dragon Knights, an independent chapter; it did not have the emperor's blessing. No, I speak of the Hundred Year War with Netheril ascendant." We get the feeling that they view themselves as the main defenders, especially given their open war waging and last-line-of-defence behaviour in Evereska. They fought the Netherese armies on the ground; they came to Sembia's aid.

He says that the key is to gain the support of the Senate. "If you can get the support for your cause, I can arrange a meeting for you in Suzail, in the heart of Cormyr, with the Seat of the Empire." Temo says, "That would be most welcome and most generous; how might we travel there?" "We could transport you there" "Also most generous! How long would that take?" "Come and speak to me if you get the Senate's support. I will get you there." He understands the time pressure; we have to assume he's inferring a portal or similar but can't directly say as much.

All roads lead to Selgaunt. We could be there by 1 or 2pm, find a place to stay, do some preliminary research and crash out, hoping to hit the ground running the next morning. We ask, "Where do we go to catch the flying transport to Selgaunt?!" "You need the **Capital Flyer**. You catch it just North of the warehouse district, south of the market." "Thank you! We will return, hopefully, soon, with good news about the Senate."

Without further ado, aware of how tired we are, we head to catch the transport. It's not hard to find. There's a waiting area with a number of people, and ticket counters. There are boards with confusing departures listed; they go to all manner of places. There's one called the *Capital Flyer*, which is helpful; next to it, **Platinum Rose**. Above it is written, "Searloon to Selgaunt" above it. Temo approaches one of the counters, and asks about that; what's the best option? The counter he's chosen doesn't deal with that route but he points out which one does; though he tells us that there's a departure in 40 minutes. The Platinum Rose also goes the same way, but it's a paid service rather than free. Temo thanks him and heads to Platinum Rose counter - no queue there - and asks about price, travel time and when the next departure might be. "How urgently do you need to be there?" "Well, I suppose, I mean... Fairly urgent?" "Well... Let me check... Yes. I can organise a sailing for you for 20pp that will depart immediately. But if we waited a little longer it'd be divided between more people." They depart within the hour anyway, as there's "a request from the other end". The travel time is just under 2 hours!

A charter service. Temo goes back to the party and explains. I guess we're not in *that* much of a hurry... Good to know it is an option, but an hour or so wait extra doesn't matter to us today, we think. Maireagh also isn't keen on paying when there's a free service! So, a little dejected but not too bothered really, Temo queues and ends up with four clay tokens for the 11:30 of the Capital Flyer. At this point, that's half an hour away. "Do you have any luggage to check in?" Our backpacks etc are fine. There's no allocated seating... But if there's a particular place we want to sit on board, we should be at the gate 10 minutes before boarding. And that happens 10 minutes before sailing.

Outside, there are short piers around a loch or lagoon with water in it that connects via canals to the harbour via a water race; presumably the ship takes flight before it goes over that! Temo hurries back and grabs hold of Riglan's sleeve, "Come on, we have to be quick to get the best seats!" and toes us to the gate at least 5 minutes earlier than the 10 minutes early time suggested. We're at the front of the queue.

To Temo's delight, we're told "You're eager! Let me check - yes - come on board!". The ship is beautiful with two seating decks. It's very clearly our first time; the attendant asks if we want a cabin to hide out in, or perhaps a view with food? We're taken to a section near a cafe/service area. He says these are his favourite seats as they look out over the ocean on the way to Selgaunt; or on the other side to look inland. We figure we'll look inland. Maybe we'll see places that Azalin might want to exit.

People are still finding seats when it's departure time and the ship doesn't hesitate. There are some chiming noises and it heads out towards the water race, then there's a feeling of a shift as the ship lifts off the ground. It hovers out over the water race and onto the ocean, then skims along. It's very fast indeed!

Craggy hills and cliffs have old temples, maybe, along the top. Some have giant braziers or dishes that look like perpetual fire or light towers? Guidance for ships, or religious? We're not sure. The coastline is rugged, but then hills give way to pastoral land that slopes slowly down to the water with beaches and small houses. Fishermen are visible in these areas, with boats that they drag out to sea. We pass another skimmer heading the other way. People are waving at each other! Finally, we see rising up gently, some larger hills and some groves of trees; further back, vineyards; but again, no forests. Riglan recognises some things early on from his hawk flight but soon we're beyond the range he'd been able to see. And so it goes on.

If Rex wanted to walk out onto a beach, he'd be spoiled for choice. But at least it's unlikely that he'd come out along any of the cliffs!

Food is pay-for. We have a little, more for novelty than anything else; we did have a big breakfast. People are filing past getting food and drink almost constantly. Kids run around in wonderment, parents trying to keep them under control! Some play cards, others chat, some even work on papers they have brought along. It seems very routine to them.

"Imagine how much this would change the Sword Coast; being able to travel at such speed between the major coastal centres" observes Riglan. Curiously, we overhear a complaint about it "taking too long" but the Rose being "ripoff"!

The ship is big, too; it seems to carry around 80 people, plus the crew; and we don't know how many cabins there are on the deck below either.

### Around 2:15pm

The ship has slowed. Chimes sound again. The ship starts to descend down to the water; we curve around a promontory as the ship touches the water and an extra set of sails open. We sail conventionally into the harbour... Because it's *very* busy.

A beautiful, gleaming, stunning city, of dense, tall buildings is visible ahead. To one side, a sheer rock face emerges from the waterline, overhanging a little, with atop, a beautiful circular structure with rows of columns around it, a second circle inside, a domed ceiling, sculptures, gardens... Senate or a palace, but Temo doesn't think it's royal. Senate, then.

Riglan looks over his shoulder back at the sea and comments, "It's really strange; there's no sense of mortal peril. We're in terrible danger here, Azalin's army is probably walking under those waters right now. Maireagh, you might need to keep an eye on me over there. That looks like an *awful* lot of people."

The ship enters a canal and eventually docks against in a large building with big arches and walkways above us; sky bridges, almost. It's against the big rocky outcrop with the huge circular building above and the city has more levels and verticality to it here.

In due course we disembark and Temo wants to find someone to ask about inns, good places to stay, a little quieter, not too fancy... Perception 21; meanwhile Riglan, CHA save, 14-1->13. We've arrived on a huge concourse with a big clock tower in the middle, next to a soaring-roofed building with lots of people milling around. People with signs seem to be advertising, calling out wares; Riglan and Maireagh both are rather overwhelmed. Nethza keeps nearby to usher us along. Temo notices a central stairwell with a sign, "Visitor Information" and he makes his way slowly there, making that Nethza is keeping Maireagh and Riglan with us all.

Temo catches the eye of an attendant who's just finished serving someone. He asks first about inns. Temo is handed a small map and asked what part of town he wants to be in. Temo points to an area that is close to the Senate shown on the map. "A bit less vibrant up there - more stately rooms - but a shorter commute and the views in some of the rooms can be really quite spectacular..." - he circles three places. He asks about the Senate and we're told to approach the Office Of The Senate first, which is also circled on the map. They close at 3pm every day, but open at 8am. "I would advise arriving early for there is a queue!"

We're directed to an exit door and told to find a carriage that leads to the area we want. "About four stops", she says. We follow the instructions as best we can. Temo doesn't have trouble; things are well signposted, pamphlets handed out left right and centre. Nobody's noticed but Riglan, unprepared for all this, is just accumulating them all, thanking people politely! Temo spots the carriage we were told about - "Dress Circle / Senate Hill" - the carriage driver hails us, asks if we're going to the Dress Circle; we point at the map (!) and he says "yes, I go there!" - he says he'll tell us when we get there.

There's a seated area downstairs but it is cramped and Riglan needs air. He heads up to a standing viewing area at the top. A little precarious but he hangs on tight! The others follow. "Next Stop - East Market!"

It certainly feels a lot busier here than Searloon, not least because of the extra carriages around and the taller, closer-packed buildings. We exit at one point a narrow street but now see a different part of the city; beautiful and leafy, with more gardens around, communal perhaps, breaking up the buildings. After a moment, "East Market Stop!" is called.

Temo gets the impression this is a civic thing; another city service. No mention is made of price and people leaving at the first stop don't seem to pay anything. They thank the driver as they disembark.

Riglan is acquiring a morbid streak as all he finds himself able to say is, "This is a *lot* of bodies for Azalin." Ilithylia said they don't have a military; if Azalin came out in this harbour, there don't even seem to be city walls or fortifications. "It's quite terrifying - they're completely exposed."

**"Grand Central Library"** is called, which breaks Riglan out of his reverie a bit - "*That* would be useful!" asks Temo if he could please keep a mental note of this stop.

We're at higher plateau, able to look down onto the docks. Beautiful plantings a series of buildings, 2-and-3-storey, in complex geometric shapes that kind of interlock with walkways in between; civic art; gathering areas and more. A group of people are singing in one area! A group of younger people disembark here, quite wide-eyed; we see signs talking about **The Sembia Public University**. It's a bit of relief to see *somebody* who at least finds this either impressive or a little overwhelming, rather than just seeming to find it routine. A few other people help them get chests and trunks off the carriage before they start looking around, as if trying to get their bearings. Nobody else joins us this time.

**"Clockmaker's Row"** is next. The streets are narrower again, but with smaller buildings, set into the hillsides often. A brass plaque over the street entrance announces the name, which seems old cobblestone and pedestrian only. A tourist attraction perhaps? Riglan whispers to Temo, "...and if you can, remember this one for Maireagh!"

Finally - "Next stop, Dress Circle. This service terminates at the Senate!" - and driver catches our eye and nods at us. "This is going to be your stop!" we call "Thank you!"

Dress Circle is a beautiful, wide crescent of buildings. Trees planted around wide streets, willows mostly. 3-4 storey, inns by the looks of it, stand on either side of the street. It seems there are little terraces and angles that the buildings try to use to maximise views of the city. Above, at the hilltop, we can see the Senate Hill.

We disembark, thank the driver and consult the map. One inn to the left while we look at the city, with an inner view; or two to the right, which potentially look more towards the sea; the city is interesting for sure but Riglan thinks a room with a bit of calm headspace would be better!

The buildings are a bit scary; they climb down the steep edge somewhat so we appear to enter almost on the *middle* floor. The first of the two in "**The Citizen**" and a bit further along, "**A Fair Trial**". Riglan says, "I'd prefer a fair trail of wits against Rex than being a citizen" (trying and failing to be witty!) so we carry on to there. It's a more normal building, without the scary hanging routine. Maireagh's happy either way so we enter.

A doorman opens the door for us. "Good afternoon! Welcome. Please head up to reception. Do you have any bags?" and to Riglan's astonishment, Maireagh hands him the Bag Of Holding. Riglan would've never expected her to let it out of her sight... Nethza hands him her backpack too. Riglan does *not*, not after that time at the Shadowfell! (Maireagh like Riglan is a little overwhelmed and her literal mind responded to the question).

Temo has the "this is very expensive" hairs on the back of the neck thing going on. A dark oak reception desk has two well-dressed half-elves stood behind. They look like they might be family. "Good afternoon!" says Temo. "Forgive me, are you related by family?!" "Yes, we are. We the Sons - the two Sons of the family of the family and our sister also works here." A name badge reads "**Tristan Trial**". The other says, "**Tremaine Trial**". Temo perks up at that - "Ah! A family-owned business. How wonderful!" "It's been in our family since my great-grandfather. You are after rooms?" "Yes. Do you have some kind of family room...?" "I think so, just one moment..." - he goes back to a room behind and we hear him talking to **Theresa**, asking if the room is ready. It's on the fourth floor and there's a lift.

We're asked how many nights. We chat briefly about the Senate; he thinks there might be a day or two of wait until our issue is heard. Temo asks if the Third Speaker's seal would help; we're told it should, but we shouldn't go to the public gallery - head straight to the "Senator's Lounge" and speak to someone there. The two brothers converse a while and ultimately think that it could be *four to seven days* (!!) but they'll take 4 days, but should our issue take longer, we won't be charged extra (and vice versa) - "that is a fair trial!" - we agree. "You don't happen to have Sembian coin do you?" "Ah, no..." "Do you use platinums where you are?" "...Yes..." They produce a coin. "It would the weight of two of these!" They have scales. It seems our coins and theirs aren't so different and we pay 2pp.

Various things are signed. Two keys are handed over. We're given a folded leather wallet; in it, hand-written sheets of paper that we have to bring with us to meals in the hotel. They're some kind of voucher deal.

They will show us the facilities and deliver the bags to the room - but at that Maireagh quickly fetches her bag back and, with only Nethza's remaining, she does the same.

* Saloon area on the ground floor with some light food available
* Dining on floor 1, with a bar and tea area
* There are some baths along the middle of each floor, sauna-kinda rooms and so-on
* Via a lift we're taken to the fourth floor and our room, in a corner

Once we're alone Riglan goes straight to the windows to see how climbable it might be! It's too far from the hillside for someone to jump to get in, though they could fly; it would be climbable but only with great skill and the corner faces the street, so they'd be very easy to spot. We have a very clear unobstructed view up here over the roof of a lower building across the street, out and over the ocean.

Soft lights glint on the water. With a spyglass, Riglan can see land in the haze far across the sea. We're not sure from the map what it might be.

Maireagh asks, "How are we doing rooms?" - we hadn't looked. There are two bedrooms on either side of the main lounge area. Riglan quietly say to Maireagh, "I believe you like to make sure that Nethza isn't doing any sleepwalking...?" and Maireagh loudly says, "Nethza, girls in this one! Boys, you can have that one over there."

We take time to change up our clothes a bit. More comfortable, clean. We open windows; and look out. No balcony (good for security!) but a good view. Then she yawns. Riglan says, "I could try making tea...?", but Maireagh is already digging around looking for things. She finds something we can use to boil water, fills a teapot and Riglan helps heat it, mostly just to feel useful. Then Maireagh notices a dresser, or chest, which has lots of little drawers with various herbs or bags in - as if tea. The top drawers appear to have some kind of confectionary, and there's a card that lets us know it is complimentary. Temo's ears pick up "Confectionary? I'm an expert!" and goes to try something. Riglan picks a random bag of leaves that smell good and we try that for tea.

Temo, perception 19; Riglan, only 13 - focused on the tea. Temo sees that at the window, Nethza has fallen asleep in a chair by the window. "Perhaps just make it for three?" "No, she can't go to bed yet!" says Maireagh. She wakes Nethza and gives her the tea.

We all sit around a table. Temo proffers confectionary for Nethza. What next?

Well, we don't really know anything about Sembian politics. But we do know there's a library, where we could research moren ("How to win friends and influence people"); and we saw in the Dress Circle merchants and services that seem related to success in the Senate. Inns, small or large; some private residences; but many services like lawyers, scribes, orators and more. It's very strange - this very large scale but very open system, without one ruler.

We discuss options. We don't have an army in 18-20 days, in the Oracle's vision. By the time Azalin is at Zhentil, we're riding towards him leading an army; he's already there, and is not intercepted. Perhaps our role, if things play out thus is to at best deflect him when he emerges so that his path to the Moonsea involves minimum damage to the nations around. But quite how we'd do *that* is another question.

* We'll need to get back in contact with the Third Speaker's Assistant to find out if they've got some idea where he will emerge.
* We need to research how to 'do well' in the Senate. We need contacts there if possible and need to find out *what* Sembia can do. We will be asked, probably, what we *want* but we need to know instead, what they can offer. No armies, but plenty of other ways to help.
* Ultimately we need them to rubber-stamp requesting Cormyr's assistance.

### 4:30pm

Temo receives a jolt in his head. For a moment he's startled, as if it was the Sling Of Warning, but instead, it's a message... **"Mister Smoothhands. Speaker's Office received word: the Speaker will arrive in two days. Please reply with your whereabouts."** Reply is, "Selgaunt, attempting to get Senate approval for Cormyr involvement. Please let us know if you gain any insights into Azalin's likely place of emergence." Surprisingly after a delay there's a new message. **"Me again! Will dispatch messenger with a parcel to aid communication presently. Please respond with exact location for delivery."** Temo thinks for a moment; how much does he trust her? He knows no other locations, and if we *did* subsequently get attacked that could be useful information. So he says, "A Fair Trial, to be delivered care of Jack Smith."

He pops downstairs and has a word with the front desk, that a parcel for a "Jack Smith" might arrive from the Saerloon Speaker's Office. Apparently he has another parcel for a "Jack Smith" inbound!

We need to kill time and can't do anything too demanding now. Perhaps we get food just before 7pm and crash out to avoid exhaustion. There are a couple of hours or so to kill beforehand. Temo suggests that Clockmaker's Row isn't far away. Maybe we wander out and have a look?

We travel along the hotel row until we get to the main street that runs up and down the big hill. Carriages like the one we rode are frequent and travelling in both directions often. We figure it's not far and can just walk rather than using one of those for just a single stop. It takes a few minutes downhill and, there it is, with touristy "Clockmaker's Row" sign above.

There are beautiful clockwork inventions in shop windows everywhere, but even installed on arches that go over the street - big clocks with things that pop in and out, like a cuckoo clock but all different things and scales. One building even has a mechanical unicorn running around it on a track! Most shops have doors that have a step or two down off street level. Maireagh starts talking almost constantly, more excited than we're seen her in a long time, albeit tired - she is pointing at things, describing what she thinks the mechanisms are and so-on.

She's cautious about going into a shop as she's too tired and fears she might make a bad decision. Temo asks what she means - buying something she doesn't need; misunderstanding a concept; even being rude to people! He sympathises; at least the street is very nearby so we can revisit readily. She can't figure out if it's just a gimmick or genius. Elements of both. Riglan opines that the clockwork flying bee from all that time ago would certainly have fitted in well, and indeed stood out, given its combined use of technology and magic. "Magic?" she says. "I don't do magic!" Riglan shrugs and says, "I suppose I can't tell the difference - if I can see cogs, I assume technology; if something happens without a mechanism - like a crystal or something? - I kind of assume magic." Maireagh is happy to dive into an explanation, getting quite animated, and it just makes Riglan smile. He's happy to be correct and learn more, and it's good to see her in her element.

We walk the length of Clockmaker's Row and pop out the other side; we look out over the beautiful city sprawling beneath. Stairs built into the hillside snake down through various parks, plazas and so-on, offering numerous routes down. It looks like many get to the grounds of what we think is the university. We can see its layout; seems very orderly; planned. A central building, pond, grounds in front, wings built out - all quite symmetrical. Common areas have people standing around, tree-lined streets, the whole thing. "That could compete with Silverymoon for style!" says Riglan. The gardens show the age of things here - trees are grand and sprawling.

We see small squares with markets. Many houses have rooftop balconies, flat, with people hanging out. Not much rain here maybe? Certainly far fewer pitched roofs; there are sloping sections but the tops are usually built as these flat areas for communal use.

A flock of birds alights from the university and flies out over the city. Riglan sighs. "Wish we could just fly home, forget all this... I wonder how we figure out the best approach with the Senate. I mean, we'll go to that Senator's Lounge or whatever, but it sounded to me like we're meant to get help - like - speech writing, or protocol or something, from these various sort of - well, trades, or guilds, or whatever they call them here. I don't know where to start. Maybe we just ask when we get to the lounge."

Nethza says, "I hope the Third Speaker can help." "Yes, she should have advice; but we should not wait two days to do anything - we can at least get started with the process I suppose; it might even even take a few days to schedule a meeting, or something. It was hard to see the Waterbaron before we knew her and here it's much bigger and much busier and we don't know *anybody*. So we might be forced to wait."

The road we've reached at the junction at this far end of Clockmaker's Row arcs back up to the top of Senate Hill so Riglan points upwards and says "shall we?" - and we head up that way.

Riglan is very distracted, glancing frequently - perhaps unconsciously - to the sea whenever it is visible.

Side streets are busy initially. One large one in particular has lots of people are on balconies of buildings, many with the balconies recessed. They are drinking and standing around. Bars, taverns, eateries. Further up it gets quieter. Buildings look like service buildings or offices - "Foo And Sons", "Foo And Associates" and so-on. We saw something of this on the other main street before. The street eventually levels off - a plateau. A beautiful feature on either side forms a kind of water wall, flowing over a circular stone carved surface. A few steps up from there, we're on a beautiful flat concourse, which surrounds multi-stepped, planted gardens leading up in terraces to the big domed, circular building we saw before. The Hall of the Senate. Above a main entrance, currently roped off but *with no doors*, are beautiful grand arches. We go up and peer inside. A presumed-public gallery area is visible inside, overlooking a kind of amphitheatre centre hall with the domed ceiling above - it's just a huge open space. "The Forum Of The Senate", says a sign.

Someone startles us, approaching quietly from inside the door and holding a dust pan on a long stick and broom, offers to let us in to look at the art; we gratefully accept. "I haven't cleaned this area here, so you can walk over that area! I'll have to kick you out when I clean it though!"

There are individual podiums with seats behind down below; two rows of seats around on different levels; a central area at the very base has a few more grand podiums and what might be a speaker's table. There is a beautiful tiled mosaic there. The underside of the dome has a ring of stained glass that holds up the centre (how?! Something of an architectural marvel). There is a very Greek-style painting of gods in the heavens. There is very heavy-handed iconography, to be truthful - gods reclining, angels, sun, blue sky; as if the gods are debating up in the idyllic view of heaven. It's interesting as it doesn't seem to address a specific god or religion; more just the abstract concept of an over-arching theme of godliness. The pantheon of gods comprising the common religions are not usually depicted either together, or as here, in such an abstract way.

"It's just not right. It's not right that something should come to destroy all this. These people don't expect it, they have no defence. Look at what they can achieve without having to spend all the time and effort on walls and guards and machines of war..." he sighs, ears low. "Why can't it just be left alone, to thrive instead of be under threat. The world makes no sense to me."

Maireagh says "But they must have defences? There must be some form of military?"

Riglan says "I know. It seems mandatory! Yet the Speaker said not; and we see this now with now with our own eyes. How do these neighbouring nations, especially militarised nations like Cormyr, not fall prey to the temptations of conquest. Are we really that... Crude. That barbaric. The Sword Coast really is - a young, dangerous, and fragile place. My little tribe would be a comfort to me right now!"

Temo says, "The place looks like it runs on laws. Someone must enforce them. Advanced or not, I refuse to believe that there is no crime. And some people have eluded to it - merchants and such - corruption exists anywhere if you look deep enough. So there must be a police force of a kind, but just not something that's military; not an army; not something that needs heavy, defensive city walls or keeps or watchtowers. You know, it's strange - I almost feel unsafe because of it, because I'm so used to those things being visible and I never realised I cared. In fact, I've often considered myself in opposition to the law in my wilder days - so I surprise myself in this."

We thank the cleaner. The light is fading. As we head out, she says, "It's nearly my favourite time of day! I'll tell you where to stand. If you get there early you'll get there before all the others!"... Apparently it's a light show caused by sunset. Just lasts for a moment.

We head in the direction indicated. There are already a few people, though not too many; pretty soon, many more arrive. The sun starts to dip down over the far side of the city, behind the silhouette of buildings on one of the other three large hills around the city. At just the right moment, it hits a stained glass rose window of some tower over there and suddenly, unexpectedly, we are bathed in a breathtaking beautiful multicoloured light shines over the city, a kaleidoscope of colours, lasting just a moment. People shuffle places to have a moment in just the right spot.

The moment passes and people wander away. "We *have* to stop him. We just have to. I guess our job is just to push him North towards the Moonsea with minimum damage? But I was not encouraged by what Cormanthor said. We're going to need a better plan."

Temo says, "I find it hard to plan on an empty stomach!"

Given our fatigue and desire to pretty much roll out of a place serving food and directly into bed, tonight we opt for the hotel dining room and our vouchers. We'll be more adventurous tomorrow! Two tables are already occupied as we reach the first floor restaurant. We are greeted and show the vouchers. We are offered a window seat "or closer to the buffet?" - Temo's eyes light up - "Buffet please!"

It's a big long table in front of the kitchen. Our table is a row back from there. It's good food and drink. A lot of good fish and salads.

Riglan says to Temo quietly, "That table you chose. Speak honestly. You didn't trust the windows either, did you?" "Very easy to climb" he answers. Riglan thinks a while; he could whisper, have this conversation in private maybe, but Nethza might overhear and ask and he'd have to lie if he wanted to avoid frightening her. Or she'd just be worried about things *because* they talked privately. So he speaks a little more loudly, to all.

"I lived in fear for a while, when I had the first dreams about my tribe and forest being destroyed. It got better once I started to act. I hope it is the same for you, Nethza. I do not want you living in fear. But our concerns must be voiced; we must be ready. He won't have stopped. He'll still be coming for you. He knew we were in Silverymoon, he someone found us in the middle of the desert... How many people in the two big cities we've seen in Sembia might have stumbled across an amulet like *that*" (pointing to Marieagh's bag). "We have to be ready. On our guard."

Nethza mulls it then says, "That's true... At the same time... One thing I do remember about the Shadowfell lands was the battle between hope and fear. There's nothing wrong with being prepared, but that does not mean we have to life in fear. Fear was how some of those baronies were governed. Fear was how Azalin ruled without needing to exert any power at all. And that maybe is the most powerful thing that I see about this place, and maybe why it is in the line of fire; because the people here do not live in fear."

Riglan nods. "Yes, I don't want that for you. Or for us. It grips me sometimes, ever since we read the account from that soldier who hid. It wasn't that Azalin saw me in my dream, strangely; oddly enough I felt that might be as much me seeing *him* as him seeing me. But hearing what he can do, what his presence is like, was scary. But you're right. I don't want us afraid. I want us to be *prepared*. And if there's a way to get ahead of this - be on the front foot - that would be best. Maybe the Speaker's Assistant can help; get us a location. Right now, we're just reacting."

"For everything else, there is the Alarm spell" says Temo. "Speaking of which, I'm full! Is it bed time yet?!"

Maireagh has just got back with a plate of small baked treats. "Nightcap?" asks Temo. "Dunno. I'm quite full. But I really want to try some of this stuff..." "We're here for a few days. Let's put those in the chest and have them in the morning in our room, where *nobody knows we're doing it*" says Temo with a sparkle in his eyes!

### 7:30pm

We get back to the room, very very tired. The harbour lights are still lit. Then there's a strange, plaintive "kling" noise at the door. Temo investigates; he realises there's someone outside. Tremaine. "Hi!" says Temo. "I wasn't sure if you wanted to be disturbed, but I thought I'd test it and see... Well... This has arrived..." - he hands Temo the parcel. "Ah!" says Temo, "Perfect! Thank you so much."

It's a small wooden box. Temo checks it for traps; investigation 33! No traps, but he does see that it has an aura of abjuration; a protective aura - a ward. He suspects this is to warn if someone *else* opens the box, so he opens it. D20->5; he can't figure out how to open the box! "Riglan? This has no lid..." - Riglan looks. Perception 13. No good. "Maireagh?" he calls. She grumpily comes over. "How do we open it?!" he asks.

She tries herself; 23 investigation. She finds on the side of the box an inlay that Temo thought was just decoration, that looks like maybe a magic eye? Temo holds it up to his face - and the box just unfolds. "Nice trick!" he says.

He sets it down on the table again. Two objects inside - one is a small decorative stone-like object; small, fired ceramic, with the symbol of Searloon on it. We think it's a rather small sending stone. The other item is a perfectly shaped ball of Opal. Temo says, "That reminds me of the thing Thunderspells used when we were at the police station. Shall we give it a try?"

He picks up the sending stone sending stone and says, "Temo here, parcel received, hope I am not interrupting or waking you up!" - the rune on the stone lights up a soft blue. He hears in his head a reply "Ah! Great. It has reached you. This stone connects to me." (It is the Speaker's Assistant). "The vision crystal connects directly to the Third Speaker but you can only use that once a day". The last part of the sentence surprises Temo so he asks, "Oh, that means I can use the stone more than once?" and there is a reply, puzzled, "Well, I don't really understand what you mean?" Temo says, "We have encountered similar objects on the Sword Coast but more limited. Only one message a day." "Oh! How odd. I guess you would only use it for important messages then!" Temo says, "Yes, I think maybe that's the whole point!" "That's a good idea. Let's just use this for important messages. Are you planning to go to the Senator's Lounge tomorrow?" "Yes, to at least get started and see what we might need or whose help we might seek." "Make sure you bring the vision crystal with you." "We will." "Have a good night!" "You too."

Well that's that - and very helpful. Temo smiles but yawns. He starts on his alarm ritual. The dog is on watch, but we decide not to.

"I hope I dream..." says Riglan, looking at his staff as if he might somehow cajole the Shepherds into aid. He's well aware that it doesn't actually work like that, of course.

Finally - sleep!
