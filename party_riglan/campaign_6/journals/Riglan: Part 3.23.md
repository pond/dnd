# Riglan: Part 3.23
## Day 63, Zhentil Keep, Throne Room

The battle rages across the town. We have made our way into Zhentil Keep and, upon discovering its "stolen" Giant flying technology, destroyed two anchor runes to destabilise the building, prevent its flight and draw Azalin Rex into direct combat. We fled through tunnels and rooms until reaching the Throne Room where we held our ground against an undead swarm. Azalin has scried our location. He will surely arrive very soon - but first, a Skeletal Knight has carved through two of the three spiders that had guarded the entrance corridor with a web to prevent more undead coming through and now, focuses on the third.

Initiative rolls are weird and rather difficult:

* Temo 16
* Maireagh 16
* Nethza 15
* Riglan 15

Temo and Riglan are stood behind the throne on corners of the dais that give a commanding view of the back of the room and around the sides, but not a great position for the doorway where the knight has appeared. Temo is within range for this crossbow though, so aims and fires - but adv 4,4! -> 15, miss!

Maireagh is at the edge of the dais closest to the entrance but too far for the Thrower. She and the dog take up a guard position, ready to attack as it closes. She casts Fire Shield.

Nethza casts Crown Of Stars. She flies up above the throne and throws one of the stars. Another miss! It's close but the knight deflects it on the armour.

Riglan has fast speed when flying and is able to come up alongside and just about Maireagh, then throws flame at the knight. This *does* hit, but only for 3d8->10 damage.

The Knight's helmet only really shows its jaw. It opens the jaw, then lets out some sort of screech which seems to summon a steed - it lifts up into the air as the steed forms from shadows beneath it. It charges at great speed, trying to dash through between Maireagh and the dog, carving at her with its blade as it goes, very fast again, three swings! Its sword doesn't gleam - the opposite really - dull, no reflections. Three attacks - all with advantage due to its elevated position on the horse; the first nonetheless misses. The next hits, 3d6+5->13 necrotic. Temo sees that land and prepares Silvery Barbs - especially as he sees it leave behind an evil gash that immediately starts to seep, somehow; Riglan, nature 21, recognises necrotic damage but an enervating attack - it doesn't drain live **but prevents healing**. He calls that out - to be able to heal, you have to not be hit at all. He thinks it'll be a short-lived impact. Temo is distracted by that and doesn't have time to react with Silvery Barbs, but is also torn, since it seems too late - it gets in another hit, for 16 more damage (and the dog, blocked somewhat by the horse, doesn't get to react to provide disadvantage).

At least Maireagh's fire shield helps here; it burns a bit on each hit (2d8), which adds up to 16 damage. She holds her spell.

The creature continues charging. It doesn't quite leave Maireagh and the dog's range so they get no opportunity attack. It seems to be eyeing Nethza. At least one spider is still on the door!

Temo tries again. Aim, fire. He tries for the Sharpshooter thing - -5, rolls 23, 18, *meets AC*. Hit! As a result of his tactics, it's a huge 47 damage. But Temo sees the damage some of the injuries seem to go into the horse, even though he hit the knight - so he mentally starts treating them as a combined creature.

Maireagh is, annoyingly, in melee range; at least the dog can be told to move to provide a flanking advantage, then she considers attacking twice - but could only attack the horse, as he's too high! But at least the fire shield is doing damage, so she stays where she is and does go for the horse. Two hits with the hammer, but not thrown; gets a max 32 damage (d8+8->16 both times). The horse dissolves into scattering shadows; the knight falls to the ground; the dog attacks it directly with advantage from flanking, doing 7 force damage. Mareaigh throws in Arcane Jolt, adding a further 4d6->17.

Nethza throws out Eldritch Blasts at the close-by knight from her commanding flying position. Two hits; 21 damage total.

Riglan flies down to get a flanking position too with the dog, uses Primal Savagery; crit, 6d10 acid, but the damage roll is awful - only 19 from a possible 60. The spider gets its web back and keeps trying to keep up the blockage on the entranceway.

The knight attacks Riglan, the dog interfering, but he still gets a hit (16,20->at least a crit avoided), for 16 damage. He keeps going at Riglan as Maireagh has the fire shield and Riglan seems more squishy - the next is also a hit; 3d6+5->18; third misses. He holds his spider spell on both occasions, but has to use his cloak for one of those.

Temo - aim, fire! Same as before, with the Sharpshooter issue. It's a low roll, but still comes to a total of 36. It seems to be taken down, momentarily though looks as if its magically trying to hold itself together - but that'd be a CON save at damage plus 5, so DC 41! - so there's no chance. It screams and it scatters into a pile of bones and bits of armour.

Riglan perception 25 as he starts to fly back upwards. Just behind the spider's web, a strange purplish light is glowing... He senses and feels his remaining giant spider suddenly withering into a husk! Riglan calls out a warning - "The spider just got taken out by something really nasty in the corridor, look sharp, pull back to throne cover!" he shouts and starts to move back to his starting position on the dais corner. He prepares a lightning wand action triggered by seeing an in-range enemy.

Ignoring the 'fall back', Maireagh and the dog take up their front-of-dais guard position again.

Nethza prepares 3 eldritch blasts, ready to go...

...everyone can see the purple glow now and then, blasting through the webs which vaporise, gliding through, finger extended forward, sucking in all life somehow from around him - a levitating **Azalin Rex, in the flesh**.

He looks - *very satisfied* to see all of us. He looks at Nethza specifically; "I had prepared a throne of your own - yet like a spoiled child, you wanted one that was *mine*. It's time for the children to go to sleep now!"

Maireagh is in the middle of roaring an objection; and he casts Finger Of Death on her. CON save, DC20, but rolls a nat 6. Flash of genius is one short too; she reacts with it instinctively anyway; but Temo's rousing speech (his 40 persuasion) rings in her ears and she only needs D4->1, and gets a 2, so that's enough. 58 damage is halved to 29.

As he's just moved into range, Riglan releases a lightning charge. DEX 15, which he succeeds on; 29->14, but he seems to take even less than that (7, resistances). He laughs at Riglan and says, "What is the purpose of this annoyance?"

(The purpose is to explore what does and doesn't hurt him - but Riglan's not going to say that!)

Nethza was also holding her blasts until something came into range and, just as Azalin is finishing his question, throws all three. One goes wide but two fly true - but he reacts, throwing up a shield that deflects them. "Parlour tricks, child!" he shouts, as he moves forward to get close to Maireagh.

Temo acts; aim, fire. 25; bypasses the shield. 38 damage. *That* seems to take full effect. Azalin makes a "tsk" noise, pulls out the crossbow bolt from his chest, throws it on the ground in disgust; his eyes turn a bright blue; a flick of the wrist; the air between him and Temo seems to freeze. A ray of frost. Attack 25, conclusive hit; 4d8->19 cold damage.

Mareaigh's barely more than 15 foot away. "You talk a lot of rubbish. Where did you learn to talk, bad bards?" - she throws the hammer twice. His shield is still up. Hit, hit! Good rolls. All the toys go on the first hit; 18 damage with arcane jolt for 15 more (33 total); it seems to hurt too. Riglan shouts, "The conventional weapons are doing better than spells" when he notices this, having been watching closely. Second attack is another 18 damage.

This is making a mark now. We know there's a *lot* more to come from him. He's not invulnerable though...

Maireagh commands the dog to hold firm, preparing an action to attack if Azalin gets close enough. As she does this, Azalin seems to be considering her for a moment, then the dog; "Clever little toy; I wonder if it is in fact alive? Shall we find out?" - and creates some kind of awful life-disrupting force - that purple glow - for 20ft around him. Maireagh and the dog are both caught in the effect. DC18 CON. Maireagh makes that that but the dog does not...

...and the party, for the first moment in all our time together, seems injured significantly. And Azalin heals up, too. 10 damage to Maireagh, 21 to the dog. Nat 1 con save, Fly fails. Riglan falls about 10ft but is uninjured.

**The dog is alive.**

Riglan's almost distracted by that. It's alive. It's a real dog. Well, no wonder healing worked once or twice, rather than just mending!

Nethza shouts, "Leave them alone!" and throws a star, but the shield is still up; 15+12 -> hit. 4d12 radiant; 26 damage.

Riglan watches closely. Seems to have full effect but Riglan now realises that Sunburst could be too much and, besides, we have to get out of here afterwards. He's not flying now so runs in front of the throne, directly at eye level with Azalin. He has used his L6 spell slots, so casts at L7, unaware that this stops Azalin having advantage on saving against the effect, and he's undead so has disadvantage but still makes the CON20 save. He's not blinded but takes half of the high 37 damage roll - 18.

"That's more like it. It's so much more satisfying to destroy something that tries to resist!" - Azalin looks at Riglan, seesm to be assessing things; then looks to Temo again... Temo hit hard before. Temo hears in his mind, "You're the cheeky one... But I sense you have ambition. Serve me and I will make your dreams come true!"

WIS save but heroes' feast -> advantage. 10,12+6 - uses the Bless die from the speech to, another 4 - 22, makes the save. Just. Wing and a prayer, but that's business as usual really...

(Nethza and Riglan still have the lingering Bless effect from Temo's persuasion-40 speech.)

...Azalin floats up above Maireagh and gets in the middle, up in the air, avoiding opportunity attacks, almost equidistant to all of us. Not good. He's looking at Temo, as if daring Temo to hit him. He looks quite injured...

...Temo perception, nat 20 -> 31. He looks really low! He's physically quite frail, but Temo isn't sure of the threshold to use the black feather quill and draw the rune. He thinks of a second - draws the magic missile wand and uses *every* charge. The wand actually get hot in his hand! Azalin of course throws up a shield and is in the middle of saying another glib remark - "Rookie mistake!" - and Temo shouts out, interrupting, "getting very low, reacted, caution in attack" hoping that the party will understand and Azalin won't.

Azalin goes for another life disruption. Everyone *except* Temo, who's just out of range because he's not flying, need DC18 CON saves:

* Riglan, 14, fails
* Maireagh succeeds
* Nethza fails
* Dog fails again

The 6d6 damage roll from Azalin though is only 12! Very, very lucky for us. 1,1,1,1,4,4! Trouble is, he regains a tonne of hit points. Temo shouts, "OK, so, not so low now!" - Riglan CON save 17, holds spell.

Maireagh goes full-bore! Crit miss, hit; 27 with all the toys. The dog can't do much.

Azalin looks at Temo again - ray of frost once more; hits; ouch again; 18 damage. Temo doesn't react - he's got a hand hovering over his pouch for the feather.

Netzha throws another star, but it glances off the shield (21). Azalin goes for frost again at Temo; hits; still quite pokey though, as he takes more cold 13 damage.

Azalin is right above Riglan - the sunbeam goes out. This time it hits squarely (disadv CON save was only 15, DC10) but something within him resists it anyway (legendary resistance) so 23 -> only 11 damage.

Azalin's turn again. He's starting to turn the battle somewhat... Perception is high... Looks at Temo and says a word. It sounds particularly strange...

**...and to our horror Temo falls to the ground, instantly dead**.

Power Word Kill; and that last frost ray had taken him down to 96 hit points (threshold 100). A grin spreads across Azalin's face as he beholds the dead body of Temo. And he starts to float away; he's running? Further away, but high up now, maybe 25 feet up, right near the ceiling. Taunting Maireagh basically.

Maireagh has just seen Temo die; she needs to roll a save to avoid losing focus; she steels herself. Nethza is calling out, "Maireagh! No!" and Riglan, too, "I can help him!" - through tears, she flies using her boots to get into range and smashes again with hammer. Hit, miss. Everything into it again; 19 damage, and was intending to give a heavy handed second attack but didn't think she'd miss. This is lucky, because Riglan perception 27 - Azalin is almost low enough, very close, almost down; Riglan shouts, "Watch out, he's only a fraction away! Be careful!" (technically, 12hp and Arcane Jolt is 4d6).

Azalin reacts; he wants more life force, and even though only Maireagh is close by, he uses his life drain anyway. 25 potential damage, Maireagh save nat 1, so he gets 25 of her life force back. It's Riglan's turn to shout, "OK, now a bit higher again...!"

Nethza has no choice but to risk using a star. He throws up a shield; her attack would miss; it's inspired by Temo's speech to the tune of d4->2; *just enough* - meets his AC (17+5). 29 damage.

Riglan runs over to Temo, whispers, "Sorry, just a few seconds more, my friend", grabs the feather quill from Temo's pouch and writes the rune on the flagstones right there in the throne room. He turns to look at Azalin - grinning.

Azalin is looking directly at Riglan, and it seems like he wants to throw out a Counterspell of some kind, but his shield went up and used that; he can't stop the spell. It's a brief shock to Riglan to realise that this was always a possibility - Counterspell to stop the quill working. But now there's suddenly fear in *Azalin's* eyes; the composure is gone... And the room suddenly goes fully dark. Battle sounds outside go silent. Blackness at the windows.

The dark powers rise up out of the black, reaching up, grabbing Azalin; he tries to wriggle away, reaches out with a Finger of Death, but they seem to repel any spells he tries easily. They start to pull him down, into the darkness; "No, it can't be! No! It can't be!" he shouts as he's pulled, then more, screaming, cursing, languages we don't speak, languages we do, devolving into utterances of pure fury and disbelief before, suddenly, **he is gone**.

A head turns to our group. It sees a dead party member. Looks to Riglan. "Have you a list for me?" - Temo is in no shape to argue, so Riglan shrugs, and says, "Tummil and all other living creatures in that domain - plants and animals included." "Ah. So he will get to rule over a kingdom of the dead after all..." - Riglan imagines perhaps a smile on that featureless Dark Powers being's face. "Thank you. Thank you for aiding us".

In a blink of an eye, there's light and noise outside. The keep starts to move and list again.

Riglan immediately casts Revivify; Temo comes to, "What happened?" "No time to explain, the Keep is collapsing again. Azalin's gone." Temo only has 1hp; Maireagh flies in to cast healing; Riglan does too; Nethza even hands him a potion of Superior healing and insists he drinks it!8d4+8->only 18, sadly. The keep is shuddering; dust falls from the ceiling, quickly followed by a chunk of masony; one of the big plate glass windows on the side wall explodes noisily into tiny shards as the lintel sags onto the glass. Riglan looks nervously down the entrance corridor and there are plenty of undead, but for some reason they're not attacking; either Azalin told them not to and that last order has held, or they're just confused by the keep's movement.

Maireagh gives Temo an extra 10 healing. Between that and the glass breaking, Temo becomes very alert, gets onto his feet and we start running. Riglan adds more healing, 5d4 -> 1,1,1,2,2 - these rolls are crazy! - only 12 added. Maireagh ends up casting Aura of Vitality as we flee, telling Temo to keep close to her.

As he runs from the collapsing throne room, Riglan casts one last look over his shoulder. **"Rot in hell, king of nothing"** he whispers under his breath.

The undead might have been staying in the corridor but that doesn't mean they don't swing for us as we approach. We'll be fighting our way out - the place is still swarming. Temo's able to send arrows; Riglan throws flames; Nethza throws blasts; Maireagh a hammer... We're down the corridor and going down the stairs (3rd heal, now at 65 of 125), then as we get around into the adjacent room Riglan sees that the spellcasting circle has gone and out of a window, spots the generals already marching out to lead the army against Cormyr. Nethza says she can Fly him to get a good view for Sunburst - and in fact casts L5 Fly, so we're all airborne, even the dog! This helps us stop wasting so much time on the undead. We can fly over them. Maireagh throws a hammer through a great stained glass window, smashing outwards into a hundred thousand multicolour shards that spin and glitter in the afternoon sun; we fly out above the courtyard! Fourth round, Temo up to 72.

No time for celebration out here; it's a grim sight. Spilling out from under the keep - the courtyard now starting to collapse as the keep lists - are undead. They swarm everywhere. Ushien's forces can be seen still, amazingly, up; surrounded though; but at that very moment, a barrage of arrows flies in from the East, as **Cormanthor launches a volley**. Undead all around are struck. **The elves have arrived**, on their elks. About time!

(A groaning crash from behind us as an outer tower of the keep collapses fully, curtains of falling masonry, slates, glass and wood smashing through what remains of the courtyard below).

The undead are almost overwhelming Cormyr. They've made it as far in as the command tower. **Isteval!** But Cormyr's forces are mixed in there. The wave of undead spilling out of the keep, though - that's a big, thick mass of bodies. Riglan points, shouts, "Cover your eyes!" and throws in - finally! - sunburst, right into the middle of it.

He'd kind of forgotten how big it is... 120ft across, huge, a sphere; it reaches up into the sky catching stitch drakes and abominations he'd not even really noticed! A *lot* of them are fried - the damage roll 12d6 is 47, and it's radiant so many of the creatures are vulnerable. Nethza follows up by throwing remaining stars at any hardier creatures. Some generals remain. Riglan looks back at Ushien. The elves have slammed into the Eastern army flank and are riding to meet Ushien's group. He even sees Ilsevele, resplendent on an elk, yelling a battle cry in Elvish that seems to carry all the way across the battlefield. "We of the first peoples take back this land into the cradle of Corellon, to which we ourselves return". It's a sort of managed retreat in order to regroup. OK, they're surviving - albeit with losses, maybe about half gone.

Riglan points at the command tower and shouts, "There!" - and flies at full tilt towards it.

The undead are making a spearhead concerted push to try and take down the tower. Some are climbing the sides to pull it over - so Riglan conjures 8 flying creatures as a distraction for them, then starts throwing lightning down towards the general. Over time he uses every charge, but is able to use lines of sight to get a lot of hits. Temo is just firing methodically, arrow after arrow, from a fixed point in the sky. He's basically a sniper on a 6 second timer. At one moment, Isteval beckons at him and makes space - he joins the group of four at the top of the tower and uses that vantage point to keep an eye on the 360 degrees around him.

Cormyr has taken heavy losses but they rally as they see us protecting the tower (and surely must see the keep collapsing). Nethza and Maireagh keep their own attacks going; Riglan at one points calls more beasts; later, he has one more casting; then he's out and it's down to flames. Lightning wand is spent. At one moment, Maireagh uses Conjure Barrage on another vanguard attempt. In the distance, we see Cormanthor seems to have taken the courtyard - but probably not a safe place to stand! Pieces of the keep walls at the top are starting to break off as its list gets too large. As more undead pour out, they find themselves hemmed in; Cormyr on one side, Cormanthor on the other, the river with no bridge and the falling keep creating its own wall of dangerous masonry.

After about 10 full minutes of raging battle, Fly expires and we're down on the ground. Riglan is using things like Primal Savagery, staff active; Maireagh uses her last Aura of Vitality to keep people around her in better health; Nethza spends her last spell by throwing up a wall of light to buy some time. The fight goes on for what seems like forever - Riglan summons single beasts, losing all spells above L1 now; we're doing well - and Ilsevele surprisingly, rides up to Riglan after almost a solid hour of war as the two armies are now reaching. The generals have held up a long time but even they are now falling.

Ilsevele asks why we're here - didn't we have another mission? "We did it - he's gone. Azalin's gone."

Suddenly a spear goes right through her shoulder - she was not paying attention! Quick as a flash Riglan yanks it out (saying "sorry") and helps a little bit with L1 healing word - max 9 - it's all he's got left; she calls out in Elven, "A second wind! One more round!" as they rally once again, and we do too. Temo has seen this from the tower, and gets an arrow into the general that threw the spear.

A little over an hour now. Much of the keep has crumbled. About half of it still stands, but awkwardly, on the sharp lean.

There are remaining undead, but it's more or less done. The magically called storm clouds are burning away. A late evening sun breaks through. Attention starts to turn to wounded; Riglan uses all of his magic in healing. Cormyr sends out the word to head West - the bridge is gone.

Cormanthor say they will return to the forest, to mourn their fallen. "There will be pyres tonight. A break from tradition." Riglan takes a moment to ask Ilsevele - wounded but still standing! - "How bad was it? Do you know how many you lost?" "I do not. We must tend to the wounded. Thank and celebrate those who survive. And as the sun sets, we will remember those who are gone. But we will burn this battlefield. Never again will we provide bodies! There were ancient elves amongst those that we had to fell."

She thanks us. Temo asks, "Will we see you again?" "It not be a fast recovery for Cormanthor, but life returns. Rains will nourish the forest which will grow and flourish once more. And when it does, so will Cormanthor. You know where to find us - you, and you alone know this." Riglan nods. "And we'll take that secret to our graves, of course."

Formalities are exchanged between them and Cormyr at this parting. "Let the nations of man know that Cormanthor honours the alliances of old." "As do we. We will always come to the aid of our allies."

Riglan says to Temo, "seen Ushien anywhere? Did she make it?" - Temo says, "Well Isteval did, somehow! I thought we were going to have to go Waterdeep to tell that Goliath friend of his about him falling. But no! He's luckier than me, that one. Right. Ushien."

Temo says, "Wait here!" and goes running off. Investigation 25. She's being tended to by clerics; very badly injured. She's OK. But she does say that not all the Knights of Samilar made it. Temo says he'll fetch the others; runs to get us; we get back to Ushien.

"What is this audience that is happening here?"

Riglan says, "Well, I thought it was meant to be the conclusion of a glorious campaign - aren't you supposed to be dead?!"

She smiles. "I touched divinity today. Sadly - we have lost some dear brothers. But others earned their knighthood. Others amongst us - squires, to knights - I have not seen this bravery and courage forged in battle for decades. I have seen the halls of heaven... In a sense I *did* die. But I am still here." She is clearly very proud of her knights. Of the 12, seven remain.

Riglan says, "We will tell tales of the 12. And Isteval has seen you in action first hand - if Cormyr ever wants knights to go on a bit of a foreign training exchange, well, he can send them to Summit Hall. The Knights of Samilar have a bright future." She holds Temo's hand. "If you sing songs of us and spread them through taverns of the Sword Coast, I'm sure that Summit's halls will fill and ring with the sounds of prayer and training and feasting once more."

There's movement on a ridge line. A row of elks; they turn and a sword of light is raised. There's a kind of elven salute. They gallop away.

Riglan says, "I don't get it. We're all here. Ushien's group. Isteval. Ilsevele, in fact, it wasn't Cormanthor's last stand at all. Azalin's gone; I guess the people from the domain are - *somewhere?!* - doesn't it seem a bit - easy? Or convenient?" Temo says, "I DIED!" "Only for a minute."

Riglan does have a niggling sense of a catch, something we've missed.

Suddenly Maireagh starts fussing over Temo as she's never done before. He looks surprised. It really affected her. She cares more than lets on.

"What now?"

Riglan says, "I guess it's over. Tell Quelline. And - well I want to go home but it's funny isn't it, it's hard to leave. Maybe we'll ride with Cormyr for a while? At least a short time. And then I can find a tree and - well, after I've rested! - just like that, we can be wherever you want."

The Cormyr general decide to take *all* their dead back home, and not leave any here. Mages are asked to transport them via teleportation circle. It'll take a while, and a lot of mages. But we're not camping here! They have a spot to the west where all the food wagons and so-on are left. It's a strange procession; victory but with mixed feelings, because we carry the dead. And there are lot of them. Friends and comrades, but also, some where they had to be killed twice - some were raised by Azalin's generals after death. It's why the battle kept going for so long.

Camp is set. Prayers for the dead. Comfort for those who remain. A meal cooked. A jubilant celebration? No, it's not. Sombre. Someone points, suddenly, to the setting sun. "What is *that*?!" **Towards the darkness of the Eastern horizon, reddish smoke rises as the light of a massive row of funeral pyres makes the sky itself glow. "That's Cormanthor."**

Solidarity. Drinks are poured. The mood drifts; sadness, stoic remembrance - thanks and gratitude for sacrifice. Celebrate their lives.

So, after a battle, even if you win, it's about the ones you lost first. Mourn, process; then you can celebrate. For us its new - except Maireagh; she admits she's seen this before. "What? When?" asks Temo. "I have lived much longer than you! I have seen wars. I have been in wars. They do something to you and you either learn to deal with or you learn to forget. A soldier's life is not an easy one."

Riglan points at the glow on the horizon from Cormanthor, then points to the groups in nearby tents drinking in remembrance. He says, **"We have a duty to remember. So we will need to find a deal with it."**

She sighs. Picks up a drink. Raises it, wordless. We mirror the action. She looks with a look that we see so rarely - glimpses sometimes - how much she cares; how much she is afraid to lose us and how closes she came to that happening. Temo sees this. She's terrified of any of us dying before her, but that's almost guaranteed! So he says, "Don't worry - we'll go on quest for immortality! I intend to live forever, even if I occasionally die."

It doesn't seem like the camp will go to bed. But we're very, very tired. It's the most energy we've ever expended - every single one of us *except* Temo having exhausted all magic and then kept going with anything else we had for ages. We set up camp.

Maireagh looks nervous suddenly. Riglan asks why. "We put it all out on the battlefield today. I have nothing left! I can't cast Sanctum."

Riglan says, "There's nobody left to try and find us. And Temo can use Alarm."

"Are you sure?"

Riglan says, "Hang on..." and digs around in his bag. "Look at that!" he has just enough incense. Pulls it out. Ritual-cast - takes a while - Divination. As the smoke swirls he asks, "Is there anyone evil left trying to find us?"

The shepherds appear! No need to read smoke. "No. It is safe. Tonight, sleep a restful sleep. Do not fear. There is no harm coming to find you."

The spell fades; the shepherds vanish; looking sheepish, Temo says, "Well, I didn't do this earlier - it did seem too good to be true..." and only *now* messages Quelline. "We did it! We survived. Just. Heavy cost, but could have been much worse. It is safe now. I will be home soon." "That is great news! I will take carp up a tower and we will watch the sun set today, thinking of you. See you soon." He sends one more; "We can fast travel to help you get home quickly if you wish." "You can come and get me if you like!"

(We'll probably have to lean on something like Silverymoon resources to get a teleportation circle for that!)

And so, we sleep under the stars. No alarm, no sanctum, no hut, no danger. Peaceful - despite the mixture of mourning and revelry from the busy camp around.

### 11875 XP -> LEVEL 17 (EXACTLY, BY MILESTONE)
## Day 64

Riglan wakes early. Maybe, 5:30-6am. Habit, perhaps, from prior watches though we've had a lot of interruptions in that lately? He remembers no dreams, other than a distant feeling that they were - not great. He supposes that it will take a while to get over everything of the last couple of months and the last few days in particular.

He shakes, almost like a dog might. In his mind, ideas of magic swirl...

* L9 spells! True Resurrection
* He swaps many of his attack spells for things like Speak With Plants, Find The Path
* Control Weather is recalled - this could be used for many good things
* Transmute Rock was useful, but Tree Stride is much more interesting

...and with that, he's no longer the warrior he never wanted to become. No more death. Magic is for life.

He walks quietly away from the sleeping party, surrounded by a now quieter camp. Many have fallen asleep at tables, others just stretched out on the grass. Some are awake, quietly talking, hugging, leaning on each other... He looks to the East, where the sun is about to rise. Last night's glow of fires is replaced by the glow of morning.

He can't shake the feeling that there must be *something to do*. Someone or something to save. Action. Purpose. It was just so sudden, yesterday, with Azalin. Even the army battle afterwards, viewed in hindsight, is just a fast-passing blur of confused memories.

He looks for a short stretch of clear ground, finds it, runs softly and jumps, transforming into a giant eagle; soaring up in circles, over the camp, then heading East, back towards yesterday's battlefield. Seeing what he can see. Adv perception, 25.

Zhentil Keep is in ruins. It's worse than when he last saw it and probably continues to crumble. Much of the courtyard has cracked and subsided. Lots of bodies around - ah, but sporadic movement; undead; things that look almost lost, purposeless. Straggling undead roaming. There are probably many below in all those tunnels too - but few people would have any reason to come this way and the bridge is down, to stop accidental incursion.

The area looks devastated, really. So many bodies. He can't see any from Cormyr, though. So strange to see this. Towards the East is more orderly, the Elves having being less entangled by the surge as the keep fell and apparently more methodical in laying out the undead bodies to make sure they got their own. He circles a while. A strange undead walker, four spiked long limbs, looks up, wails mournfully. Riglan could almost feel sorry for it. But it's a construct, an abomination. Weird puddles in some areas - he thinks, from some armour in them or nearby, that generals *melted*. Whole areas of ash and charred walls - fireballs, his own sunburst perhaps. The damage is very mixed, no pattern or cohesion. The battlefield is also strewn with all manner of weapons, shields, armour; damaged, or just not recovered.

Crackling and falling sounds occasionally as the keep fails a bit more, or the city itself, which suffered heavy damage from Cormyr bombardment and Azalin's meteors.

Riglan flies more East - he'd never seen this part of town and the elves came through here. The edge of woods; old abandoned fields; the barrows that the elves rode over to get towards the Eastern city boundary. Glistening in the distance, reflecting a now-rising sun, stretched out is the Moonsea. He goes higher for a better perspective. Another 25 perception. A curious collection of objects seem clustered on the shores. He flies closer, suspecting boats. Yes, boats - a great many, pulled ashore. The elves? If so, where are they? Not here yet, or perhaps they decided for another way home and left the boats for some reason. Superstition, lack of need, who knows.

Inwardly he chuckles. It looks like a colony of seagulls! A few hundred boats. Probably not abandoned, really. The elves are just somewhere here, out of sight.

History, only 4+6. He doesn't remember where the Shadowfell rescued creatures might have come back. He thinks it was further East; Azalin's home base; where the Dark Powers grabbed him, after he'd died and reformed. A long way. Some other time! He feels a duty to find them and explain what happened, but for now they'll have to make do, wherever they are.

Curiosity satisfied, he flies back to camp. On his final curve around, he notices movement amongst the boats. One is pushed out. Ah, they're waiting for light - for sunrise.

Landing back at the camp, he reassumes his form - after startling some soldiers! - to find the camp stirring and the others awake. They don't seem fazed at him having been away for a few minutes.

The generals are amongst the troops, but going easy on them. No packing up. It seems they will stay a while to tend to wounded, transport dead through portals and so-on.

Riglan rather bashfully asks if he can help with people who've had serious losses to injury - a limb, an eye or similar; he can help 3 immediately, but would like to fund something to help others in Cormyr? They don't need a fund, they take care of it - but he can certainly help with three immediately (Regenerate at L7, L8, L9). They pick the three most urgent - in great pain from their injuries, which their magic can't otherwise ease - and Riglan casts. There is much gratitude but Riglan feels almost embarrassed; many others to help; but Cormyr will look after them better than he ever could.

He returns to the group, still a bit bashful. "I can't quite settle. Feels like there's lots to do, especially with everyone around us working so hard. Is that just me?"

The others agree to we set to work. Maireagh can help with healing, as can Riglan, but Nethza feels a bit of spare part as does Temo - but the army finds things for them to do. Temo is surprisingly pulled into generals' meetings - Lord's Alliance! The morning passes swiftly.

### 11am

Isteval finds us. "What will you do now?" In tow, Ushien and the Knights Of Samilar. They are rested and will take a pilgrimage home; visit places they wanted to visit, trade, share stories, establish new relationships. A true return from a campaign. The Purple Dragon Knights insist that - if they have time - they would return to Cormyr with them first, such that the Queen may thank them for their assistance. There are many relics of related orders in Cormyr, codes of chivalry and more that could be shared. Samilar makes a decision as a group - Ushien makes it so - which surprises them, not used to voting! They think they might never be in this part of the world again in their lifetime and it would be foolish to turn down such an offer. Unanimous acceptance.

(Later, they're told that thanks will come with riches too - at least they made the decision *before* being promised rewards!)

Riglan isn't sure if we'd be needed; we have other people who are dear to us, to whom we should attend. But if there is an obligation, we can be wherever we need to be at a certain date. It transpires that Isteval and Temo have already agreed to meetings, having fought alongside each other - literally, in the tower! - and there "**are no stronger bonds of kinship than to fight for each other's lives in battle.**"

At this Riglan almost jumps, kind of tearful - and sort of says, "I'm realising that right now."

Conversation continues. Lord Isteval eventually says - "I can only speak on behalf of Her Royal Majesty, but might I suggest for diplomatic reasons, that before you leave the Kingdoms of the Fallen Stars, that you visit the Republic?" and Riglan nods, "Oh, yes, I can't fast travel more than once or twice a day, really, but I've got quite a list of people..." and Nethza interrupts, "But I can take us there!" and Riglan says, "Yes, of course, teleportation circles! We have so many options now. Oh! Temo! I forgot. Did you forget? We need to send to the Third Speaker, and the Waterbaron - let them know its safe - we won!" (and he does).

People separate and we know we're basically free to leave whenever we can.

We start packing. Someone comes over as we're doing that. "Apologies - I was sent to fetch you, if you were able to come to the Big Small Tent?!" and Riglan who was just about to say something important to Maireagh says, "Yes, we'll be there as soon as we can! Is it over... Uuuuh... Where is it?!" and it's pointed out.

**"Maireagh - I had a thought. Maybe last night would've been even more significant but we were so tired - one of those pictures you make, which captures a moment. How about the five of us, here, right now, amongst this army?" - he kneels down to the dog and pats it - "...because you're alive, too - did you know that? We know that now. For sure. You're the same as any of us."**

"Yes! A good idea. But perhaps... We could have a few more in the picture?"

She runs off. Ushien and Isteval arrive, looking confused. "Get close! Close in!" - we are flanked by paladins.

She sets up her strange device, a long time since we've seen it, it whirrs away then clicks. It captures the moment. "You will come and see me before you go, surely?" "Yes of course!"

They head off. Riglan's about to head to the tent, following Isteval but hesitates. Maireagh's hoisting on her backpack. "It's hard to leave - harder than I could ever have imagined. I'm not afraid anymore, you see. Not of undead. Not of metal. Not of crowds - Maireagh, remember how I was that first time in Yartar? And here we are, surrounded by thousands, and it feels safe and welcoming. A second home. I see now, that's what fighting together does. I feel something for Ilsevele - it can't ever be much of course, but it's there - yet somehow the bond to Cormyr is stronger."

Backpacks on. Off to the tent.

The generals are all there. "Ah you're all here! Perfect!" - a mage is called - "Organise it please!" (huh?) - small talk, a bit of food - the mage comes back, "I'm ready!" and we're ushered into the library inside the arcane mansion.

A crystal ball sits on a table. The mage beckons us towards it. We approach and look in. The queen! "Yes - my knight diplomats from the West. I have to congratulate you on a successful expedition. Thank you for what you have done - for the forewarning. For helping us reignite these alliances of old. For reminding us of what it is that makes the Kingdoms of the Falling Stars one. I understand you have much to do, and will have to delay your visit to the capital for a later date? I could not really see any way of waiting to thank you. It would not seem proper. So... I'm afraid this is the best we can do on short notice!"

Riglan laughs; "No thanks are necessary. Thank *you*. Thank you for jumping to our aid. It didn't seem like much needed reigniting - Cormyr didn't hesitate. The whole of this land, and all lands beyond owe you a debt."

"That has always been our role and our place. We are the shield; we are the sword that pierces; we are Cormyr."

Temo says, "And that'll make a good hook for the songs I'll be singing about this to anyone who'll listen!"

She asks, "Where are you headed? I know you're from the West. Where specifically would a Cormyrean find you, were they to search for you?"

We do our best to explain - give the Old Owlbear Tower address! - someone is writing it all down.

"I shall not hold you any longer. Know that you have my favour. Safe journeys. May your return be fulfilling - full of reflection and contemplation. Until we meet again." A slight nod. The image fades.

"Time for us to go" says Temo. "I was hoping - Baldur's Gate? I guess via, we said, Searloon or something?!" Nethza nods. "I can do that!"

Generals gather outside in the foyer. Much thanking, clasping of hands, much of the clasped shoulder and forearm stuff, that kind of thing! Some of them hand members of our party strange mementos. Emblems, small items of armour - a clasp of a cloak, say. We do our best to respond in kind.

We get out into a bit of space and Riglan says, "If we don't go now I won't be able to force myself to leave."

At that, Ushien calls out! "Ah there you are! You *will* come and visit us? I don't know how many weeks or months it'll take to visit all the places of pilgrimage" and Riglan says, "I've learned a few tricks these last weeks. I'll know where you are."

She looks at him. For a moment, through the after-battle glow - he sees, perhaps, her true age. Someone who saw her lifelong dream happen. She gets to lead the next generation on pilgrimages.

On an impulse Riglan just grabs her into a hug. Whispers, "You were spectacular." "I will see you back in the hills. Go well." "Give 'em hell, Ushien!" and we walk off. Nethza wants us to get beyond the camp, for a quiet spot doing runes. In the distance, some first carts start to bounce away down what's left of the road, West. As Nethza quietly writes, Riglan says, "Apart from the obvious people to visit, we will have to find the people rescued from the Shadowfell. They deserve to know what happened." "We just need to figure out where that is." "Yep. Scrying at hand! And there's a big tree over there..." - he points - "If nothing else, we can get this far quickly."

The portal completes and just before steeping through, Riglan look East, says to nobody, "Rot in hell, king of nothing!" and steps through...

### Searloon

...and we are in the room in Searloon! Back in the republic of Sembia. As usual, our unexpected and unannounced arrival causes surprise, but at least we're recognised this time. "A more respectable time of day!" and we say yes, luckily. Here to visit the Third Speaker. He gives us directions, we thank them and head out.

On the way to the Speaker's house, Temo drops in at Faramo And Son to explain the delay in establishing shipping and so-on! They say there's a war up north so they've been busy. "Not to worry, I have it on good authority that things will be back to normal very soon!"

The Third Speaker and her assistant are at first surprised, then surprised that we're there so quickly. "Wow! Sorry! I meant to reply to your message, Temo. But there are so few words with that magic!"

She asks what to put in her report... We explain that victory (owing to the foresight of the Sembian Council etc. etc.) is believed complete, everything safe, all trade can resume.

"I'm sure it'll not be the only contact you will have from us! I didn't just come over to Yartar to seek your aid. I really did sincerely wish to resume normal relations with the Sword Coast." Temo nods, "I've already got a supply deal with Faramo And Son to honour, so I'll hold you to that!" She chuckles. "I am at least authorised to do this..." - she reaches into her desk and pulls out a thin, flat wooden box. "I understand that we do not have banks in the kingdoms of the Sword Coast, but perhaps one day we will. This much I am authorised to do now, but no doubt there will be more formal established arrangements from the Senate on behalf of all of Sembia. But *this* is from Searloon." She hands Temo the box.

He opens it, looking rather confused. Inside are precious stones. "Wow" he says, "I'm new to diplomacy..." - she says, "No, this isn't part of diplomatic relationships between nations!" She puts a hand on his elbow. "This is to thank you from me, as a representative of Sembia, for saving our lives. This is from us to you." "Well, in that case, thank you. Sincerely! This is... A lot. I'm sorry if it was rude to open it like that!"

We learn that the box itself in their culture would've been understood. It's one of *those* boxes!

Riglan snaps his fingers and goes "Ah! I know! Beat this!" and pulls out of backpack a silver collar. "If you ever find vampires in the senate again, wear this!"

The usual farewells; time for Silverymoon, we think. "I have secrets for Silverymoon if you require it..." and sure - why not! We have much to discuss there. And we'll be back here, to visit. Riglan knows the trees.

She explains that this sigil circle goes to the Council Of Mages. Oh boy! She insists it's diplomatic access - it'll be fine! Well, thank you again. "But are you going to go before lunch?" "What time is it?" "Lunchtime! Join me!" "It'd be rude not to!"

### Lunch time

"Secretly - my excuse is that I want to hear what happened!" says the Third Speaker as food starts to arrive.

Riglan is surprised, he's hit by a wave of sorrow and dread and anxiety and it ALL comes back up in a thump. He chokes up, looks at Temo in a bit of panic, but Temo is studying Riglan - understands - just says, "It's fine - allow me." He pulls out his lute; Nethza helps; Performance 22, an entirely *not* embellished version of events is sung. He considers embellishment, but realises that it's already over the top and unbelievable. He just adds poetry.

Riglan sits back and enjoys the food, wine and story. Somehow, having it told back to him makes it easier.

A crate of wine is produced - it's for the Waterbaron. It's a big wooden crate, so we have to apologetically open it and carefully transfer the bottles into the Bag of Holding for safe keeping and promise to pass it on, with compliments.

There's a specific room for the teleportation circles - the runes are cleared after. We look back to the Assistant and Third Speaker as us five step in and disappear.

### Silverymoon, 2pm Sembia time

An empty room, looks like a tower. Nobody here. Riglan isn't sure what time it is. We need a window - none here - so the 8ft tall firbolg opens the door and steps through with no stealth at all. Outside, he bumbles into a busy corridor! People have to push past. He calls after one, "I'm sorry, what time of day is it?" "It's far too early to be thinking about leaving! A whole hour to lunch!" Riglan shrugs, they're in a hurry, ducks back in, says, "Well, mid morning I think..." and we head out, pushing past people, downwards. A window provides a better guess. Maybe 11am, something like that.

We get to a floor and suddenly it's familiar. Temo just knows the way. "Tearn's this way!" and he dashes off. So it's *that* tower. Right.

Temo knocks on the door and walks in. The reception area room. The assistant - "Oh! I remember you..." - sees the Lords Alliance pin - "Take a seat. I'll see if he's available." A moment later, "Please come in!"

In we go. Tearn's sat at his large desk, piled high with books and papers, glasses on, hat on a stand, cloak on his chair. "You're back! You wouldn't *believe* the portents. So portentious! The visions people have been getting. I need to check if they're true. I'm so rude! Take a seat. You must be hungry! It's before lunch. Do you want lunch? I don't need to eat anymore. It's a habit." We explain we've eaten.

(Taern mentions wine as a joke. One Sembian bottle goes to him!)

The medium-length version of the story is relayed. Tearn starts taking notes. **Riglan reveals for the first time that he plans to write a book**. Tearn is enthusiastic and gives us a name of someone *usually* in Silverymoon who can help with publishing! Cryptic directions to an address... "**Bigby**".

(A discussion about "forbidden books" and so-on ensues; Tearn thinks Riglan's story will help - a cautionary tale - he was very distressed in practice, given the lack of information with so much lost and destroyed, that Silverymoon in the end could offer very little help and had to send us East).

Tearn can get us to Baldur's Gate - upper city, but Temo will be fine there (Riglan doesn't know what that means). We need an hour or two in town then we get back and he'll send us.

Temo leads the way to The Lucid Pangolin, the bookshop where we purchased the invaluable Netherese map book. As usual it looks closed, but the sign says "Open". The old half-elven lady is in almost exactly the same location as before. She looks up and says, "Oh, my dears - are you lost?!" - same greeting as before - then - "wait - it's you! I know you! You're the cousins of... No..." - sharp intake of breath - "...you bought that book! You're back. Did you find Netherese treasure?"

Riglan says "After a fashion" then explains that we're returning the book, for whoever else in future might come looking. We consider the price paid a hire, not a purchase. She takes the book and starts protesting but her sentences aren't finished as she gets lost, turning pages, examining them... "But surely I must pay you back?" Riglan insists it was a hire. "Will you at least have a cup of tea with me?!" Oh, hell yes! Tea would be great. She produces a big wooden case with tiny drawers, checking a few, then finds the perfect one and removes small, balled up leaves of tea which she starts to brew.

She's eager to know what we learned of Old Netheril. We tell her all we can - we did see the All Seeing Eye town, many visions, ruins, and we even have the Rod Of Rulership which we show her - carefully! - and she agrees, as she reads runes inscribed, reading them to us - nasty stuff! - that it is (as we warned her) a very evil thing and we'll destroy it.

The tea is beautiful. Maireagh enquires. "I am a collect of leaves of all kinds, as you can see! Books, tea; I trade rare manuscripts for rare leaves. I find tea fascinating!" - the two chat for a while. Then the lady starts to look tired, having got so excited, so we say we'll leave her in peace and thank her and then, just before we go, Temo says, "I'm so sorry, I just realised and this terribly rude of us - but we don't actually know your name! We are..." and he introduces all of us. 

She is **Taffine Aileann**.

"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Taffine" says Temo, smiling. "You might have helped save the world."

She takes that as bluster, but of course it's real.

We head back, then, with Temo now itching to see Qelline, to Tearn's tower. Easy to gain access now. We're "known"! "All right, whenever you're ready!" he says. Completes a circle. "Travel safe!" - we step through. It's all different colours, flourishes of light, swirls, very decorative!

### Baldur's Gate, probably about 1pm

A room with a desk and a clerk. "Who are you?" and we introduce ourselves (with Temo as "Of The Lord's Alliance"). On family business. He asks if he can help with anything; no; we're leaving and Riglan suddenly thinks and asks, "Oh, should we hide our weapons?" Apparently it's polite. So we do.

Outside, Temo uses his last L3 to ask Qelline for her address - "...we are in town!". She provides it, in very excited tones - Elfsong Tavern, East of the docks. Towards the old city. We head off, expecting to take in the sights on the way, but Temo is at full pace and we struggle to keep up.

"Temo! Slow down!" shouts Maireagh. "Maireagh, hurry up!" shouts Temo. Occasionally we swat away people trying to pick our pockets or steal gear (once out of the upper city!) - they don't stand a chance against us. Nethza in the end just activates her sword and Riglan his staff to make a point - people don't get in the way after that.

We march on. And there it is; the Elfsong Tavern. Temo doesn't slow down - straight through the door; we're trailing in his dust!

A few people are sat at booths. Bartender, serving waitress; someone makes eye contact with Temo, stood in the doorway; nobody approaches, but the bartender asks, "Can I help you?" "Room of Qelline and Carp, please" "Right, um, yes, the bookkeeper? She's in the office in the back!" "Thank you" - then Temo turns to the group and says, "Carp will make your control weather look like a mild breeze on a summer's day. Beware!"

We head to the back room.

"Manager's Office" says a sign. Temo knocks. "Yes?" says Qelline's voice. "Come in!" so Temo pushes open the door, fully. The rest of us can't see in. A chair is pushed back. Rattles and crashes! (Carp was at a small desk covered in crayons and paper which is scattered to the four winds) - Carp launches at Temo - we see Temo staggering back from the doorway with Carp attached to him in a hug! Qelline is quickly there too and kisses him on the cheek, both getting sheepish. "Oh! It's - so good - to see all of you..."

Some people from the kitchen have heard the noise and been watching. They figure out what's going on. "We've got it covered here. Why not call it a day early?" "Are you sure?!" "Yeah!"

Temo says, "I'm so sorry if I frightened you." "Not at all." (Carp is kind of full-volume on a constant stream of questions). Riglan's listening in. Qelline tries to calm Carp down; Riglan says, "Carp, why don't you tell us about it and let Qelline and Temo have a chat?" "OK!". Nethza offers to let Carp ride on her shoulders.

Qelline is packing up hastily. Temo and her are having quiet conversations, murmuring, we can't quite hear it - private. She waves to her coworkers and leads us out. "So where have you been staying?" asks Riglan. "I have a room with my cousin. Well - twice removed - they have a little house here, down by the west gate. Just outside the city! Nobody can afford to live inside the city... I knew one of the chefs from the Elfsong Tavern from a long time ago and he needed help with the numbers, I'm quite good with the numbers..."

And so it goes on. Questions in both directions. Fragments of tales as minds dart from one topic to another in excitement. We are led to what amounts to the full sized other village outside Baldur's Gate; up a side street, to a humble two-storey house.

Up in the room, Riglan says, "Well, look, we've dropped in unannounced..." - we don't want to just tear her away from a new life here. But she says it is fine - she isn't committed to the tavern - even says, "If you're ready to go, I'm ready to go. I'll let them know. He'll be fine with it. The books are in good shape! Just chill out while I pack up. There's a good bakery around the corner... Don't to back into town, I'll go and sort things out, but could you look after carp?" Not going to be able to tear him away from Temo anyway.

We head there to wait. While the group is ordering at the bakery, Riglan sneaks outside to cast Scrying on the farmhouse to see if it got ransacked by Azalin's forces. He chooses to look at the main house; if the shop's damage, that sucks but it's the living space he thinks matters most. From inside, he sees the door is ajar! It doesn't seem ransacked, but lots of leaves have blown in. OK, well, he can warn her.

Back at the shop, Qelline's right - good mastica and baking! A while later she arrives, only about 15-20 minutes. She has a satchel with some stuff. The school won't mind and Carp misses his friends from home, even though he has made some new ones here. Riglan asks if she knows of a big tree nearby. "No problem. Got to swing back by the house, to say goodbye though."

She ends up packing a crate; we help; takes a little while, we help. She tells us about a big tree on a small hill... And leads us out, all goodbyes finished.

### Early evening

A path leads past a beautiful stone villa overlooking the city with some very old trees around it. She points at one of them - "This one?" - an old stone pine, in great condition, very thick trunk at the base. "Perfect" says Riglan. He likes to be polite; Speak With Plants, it grants permission. It is quite a stout, proud tree. Riglan thanks it kindly. He prepares people; then casts his spell. Carp is terribly excited. The portal opens up and Carp is through it like a flash! Qelline close behind, then the rest of us, just in time.

We emerge at the beautiful apple tree near the hut we've stayed at, in the orchard. Where Riglan and Laycie once chatted. Another life. "Welcome home!" says Riglan. Carp is wide-eyed! "Wow!" Then he runs towards the house, Qelline in tow. Everyone else follows but Riglan is stood back, kind of just hit by being *home*, just like that. We're back. Wow indeed. He walks in to follow.

He sees Qelline not-so-subtly checking things. Carp eventually finds things *he* want, so seems happy enough. Then he remembers his drawings from earlier which he'd brought and starts showing Temo them all.



## Thereafter

In the days that follow, we reunite with people and wolves at Old Owlbear Tower. We learn that trackers did come by there too, the wolves saw them off. Riglan catches up with the Silverymoon druids by tree travel, to tell them our story. There are the now-customary dramatic scenes at the mine when we destroy the Rod Of Rulership and Azalin's amulet. Gundren asks if this will be a regular thing. Honestly? Probably, yeah!

Wine is returned to Yartar. Temo has an official ceremony organised for him! The Waterbaron has arranged the formal event - he must get dressed in his most smart clothing - for his inauguration; this effectively to make it all "fully official". The event is in Waterdeep, to which we all travel together. He has to spend a lot of time afterwards in meetings where reports are shared, and some of it is in secret due to sensitive information about the Netherese and so-on. Temo even meets Laeral Silverhand. He gets to walk the halls of power. He even gets the trade arrangement going with Faramo And Son in Saerloon! We all visit that strange goliath, too, to tell him and his group all about Isteval in battle because they were friends. Maireagh is still fascinated by the metal man!

About a month, at the tower, school settled back, things starting to feel more normal. Nethza throws herself into it fully. We're all back at the tower on a weekend when a someone knocks on the door in the early evening. Someone who looks like they've travelled a long way is there, with a wagon. A trader? Adventurer? But the clothes - ah, a world ago - they're from Cormyr. A long way indeed.

The wagon contains personal gifts. There's a retinue too, including two guards on horseback and a driver. Four in total. "I didn't know what to expect - I'd assumed a keep! - but the address definitely leads just to this tower...?!" "Yes, this is the right place!" "Well this is from Queen Reidra." Cases start being unloaded. Two chests. There's even a long scroll case. They ask if they can stable the horse and rest - they'd expected a town and inn or something! "Oh, goodness. You're all the way from Cormyr - we'd be insulted if you didn't stay! Please accept our hospitality." There's plenty of space. We make up beds, everyone shares food.

* A personal letter bringing things up to speed - very personal, inviting an answer too, conversational style; so Temo writes one in return, to give back to the messenger
* Valuable Cormyrean heraldry
* Textiles, food, treats; things of Cormyr.
* Gold!

In statecraft terms, this is a more formal "thank you", Temo knows - know well versed in such things. We do not need to send hastily-arranged gifts in return! Temo will take care of that in due course. The letter makes it clear that we're always welcome to visit.

We will indeed revisit Cormyr, Cormanthor, Sembia and more now and again. There are pieces of our lives there. Over time of course distant relationships fade, but anyone involved in the battle remembers it like yesterday.

And of course, we do visit Summit Hall, greeted by a knight with whom we fought - his name is **Amit**. Overjoyed to see us - but there's something more... A beautiful pilgrimage home... But Lady Ushien passed on, peacefully, along the journey.

Riglan's heart sinks to the core of the land, an overwhelming moment of grief. When he last scried the Knights, she was with them. If only he'd looked in more often.

We're told that she was laid to rest in her homeland. They honour her memory. We ask who runs the order now? "Well, that will be me!" says the knight. He was one of the younger knights, too; just a Brother when we'd very first visited the Hall. "I'm probably not the most qualified... But I have all the brothers' and sisters' best interests at heart. I wish to do right by her. I learned so much from her! Such a role model. She inspired me, just by being who she was. I got to see her lead the Twelve and then the Hundred! Learned about all the new places and the importance of respect, honour, discipline and principles. These are my guiding lights."

A portrait of her hangs in the great hall. Drinks are offered. A toast is made; some reminiscence.

We show them Maireagh's picture taken of us all at the battlefield. We're told to keep it in remembrance, but Riglan quietly vows that one day - if he is the last of the group standing - he will bring it here, if the Order still exists. He hopes so.

Riglan says, "Well, this is your Order now, to shape as you will. Our commitments to her are equal to you. If you ever have need of us, call. We will come." "Is there anything I could do for you?" Riglan tells the story of Renwick's brother - prefixed by *NOT* wanting to crap all over Ushien's opinion now she's gone. Far from it. But it's just to keep them informed. The knight says he will mediate on it. Perhaps one day, a way through this conflict will be found. Even if it takes a century or two.

And speaking of Renwick, we of course drop in on our old friend, regaling him with tales of battle with a rather famous lich! He insists that we stay to tell the story in full, and we end up camping out overnight. Renwick even makes an effort to magically conjure food. It's surprisingly good. We leave the next day. He enquires about the Rod Of Rulership - not to own, but for us to describe. We go into as much detail as we can, including recounting the runes written on it. He's fascinated by it. He's never encountered such a thing, not even in description. "This is that most rare of things for me - new knowledge! Truly, new knowledge." But he knows about the flying castle magic, so that's old hat!

A day or two later, back at the tower, Qelline and Carp are visiting. Early evening, sun getting low. Riglan's reminded Maireagh about the Leoman's Secret Chest - we'd been so busy with a bunch of stuff unattended to; "Shall we open it?" "OK, I can do that tomorrow!" The keep, you see, is bigger now. Maireagh has Wall Of Stone to support broken areas as new excavations empty; she'll swap the spell in the morning.

It's a nice night, we head up to the top of the tower, now fully restored - all seven of us - Riglan looks to Carp and Temo, then to Qelline; "OK if we fly?" "Of course!" so Riglan wildshapes into a giant eagle. Nethza had misunderstood and cast Fly, but it's safer that way anyway - so Temo and Carp jump on, holding feathers, now really being towed rather than riding the eagle. Riglan jumps off dramatically, plunges down, soars up, circling the top of the tower, flies to the camera, sun going down, with people having climbed out onto the tower roof below, waving as we fly.

THE END.

(Mid-credits - as trees, bushes and animals appear in some distant land, a wall of mist forms and then, walking out of it, people from all ages of Azalin's Shadowfell domain. They look really confused of course - "where are we?" and all that. Tummil appears from the mist, looks startled, laughs loudly and exclaims, "Ha! I *knew* they could do it!")

(Post-credits - Maireagh casts the spell; small chest turns into a large chest; "chest eye view" - lid opening, four faces peering inside the the dog's head over the edge - surprised looks... Cuts.)























"We have battled the four elements themselves in the Underdark, defeated the Aboleth false god of the Kua-Toa and drove back the god Imix when he tried to enter our plane. We have fought alongside the great army of Cormyr and bore witness to the last stand of the Cormanthor elves at the Battle Of Zhentil Keep against Azalin Rex, where he was defeated and sent back to his Shadowfell prison through our pact with the Dark Powers themselves. We have walked freely amongst domains of the shadow and of the light, across deserts, plains, forests and nations both young and ancient. I walk freely in the domain of dreams, with the last great seers of the Giants; I command leaf, beast and weather; and I am entrusted as the bearer of one of the most precious objects on this entire plane. And so I - *we* - stand as guardians to this world. If you threaten its balance, Goliath - we *will* act to defend it."

Gnog smiles. "I grow old. My life will be over soon. It is good to know that when I die, there are others who will do what I - *we* - have ourselves devoted our lives to, for so long now."

* DO NOT FORGET THE SUCCESS/FAILURE MARBLES

# Campaign

* Fix the sky, fix the land?
* Netzha must ascend and become queen to make things right, but she'll "lose herself"
* Steal the Grand Archive "orders of authority" papers?
* What of the other tuning fork, that a descendant of Orin had - did Azalin go to Feyrun? What about the ore and the glass orb he wanted?
* Find the Vistani
* Grand Archive is in the inner city. Look for tomes about the fragments in the sky - the black material that evaporates, the runes, the fissure; a way to keep evil in? Did Azalin Rex escape during the cataclysm? And how does that related to Nethza?
* Ravens: The Kindness will be in *a* library, or other forgotten place of knowledge. Marbery House, an abandoned hunting lodge of theirs, other side of the canyon.
* Day 34 saw Oracle and were warned about ~20 days til Azalin emerges.

# Obligations

* Return to Silverymoon druidic circle to tell them what happened
* Ideally, return the valuable Netherese map book from the quirky Silverymoon bookshop
* Temo to establish East-shipping wine and maybe other rare items to Faramo And Son in Saerloon. He has their prospectus and they have a bottle of the Waterbaron's "good stuff" wine!
* Destroy the amulet of communication now held in a sealed box by Maireagh.
  - we have another less powerful one from Captain Elvin at Scardale, which had been used to control his First Mate.
* Return Tummil's tapestry, if at all possible, in the Shadowfell
  - Tummil's daughter's portrait out towards King's Road

# The future

* Turlang once said to Riglan - but a 3+5 insight meant he didn't really understand - "**Maybe you will visit me again some time, or when the forest has need of you, you will respond to its call. When your quest is over, come back and see us, little Forest Giant, if you've found your place in the Enclave - we can talk more about what you have learned and I will hear what you want to do.**". Riglan is now in the Enclave, has the World Tree seed; he understands.
