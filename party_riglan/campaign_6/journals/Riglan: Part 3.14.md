# Riglan: Part 3.14
## Day 36 (Selgaunt)
### 4am (!)

We awake after our first night in The Fair Trial. We went to bed very early!

Riglan wakes up first in the side-room with Temo. He wanders out into the main room; Maireagh is already up. She looks over; "You're up too! Do you want tea?" "Yes please!" Nethza arrives next; "Why are you up so early?!" she says, yawning. "I can't get back to sleep. It's still dark." Temo wanders in last, saying, "This travelling at night thing and all these changes of sunrise time are very confusing!"

We hazard a guess that it's maybe 2-3 hours until sunrise. It's fully dark outside; even the docks are far darker, though some lights are still on.

Riglan perception 20(!)+10->30. Nethza has a smear of brown on the back of her head! Maireagh has one on her head near her temple. He points at it and says "Hey, what's that?" - they notice Temo has the same. Riglan looks started; "Is it on me?!" - yes, on the back of his neck.

Temo says "This isn't some hotel thing is it? Like, chocolate on the bed?" - and indeed, unfortunately, chocolate smeared on all pillows. "Why would you do this?!" says Maireagh. Temo says "No, I think it's a weird thing where it's like a treat, before bed? But we were too tired..." - Maireagh is not impressed! Temo fetches the cleaning stone to clean up the pillows and each other.

We have time to kill. Nethza mediates; Maireagh tinkers as usual; Temo makes a bit of headway on his statecraft book; and Riglan (nat 20!) makes strong progress on the Eastern Empires book.

### 8:30am

Riglan suddenly jumps up. "Ooops! They said get there early... 8am wasn't it? But - maybe not so bad for the Senator's Lounge? We'd better hurry!"

So we abandon thoughts of breakfast and rush to get ready, then scuttle outside and up the hill. It's only about 5 minutes on foot. Morning sunshine, on the shadier side of the hill; relatively cool. It's nice to have a short walk; we wake up properly at last. The sun rises behind the big forum building - it looks pretty. There are already groups here.

Temo (persuasion 17+15->32!) asks around to try and find out where we need to go. We are directed swiftly to a particular building. We head over. People arriving seem to have a specific purpose and some have a specific style of dress - strange cravats, silk, colours that seem to have meaning - bright blue with white edging, who seem to be approaching people, speaking to them and writing things down; one of them approaches us. "Good morning. Are you in need of an advocate?"

TL;DR this is a city advocate. He assumes we have our own when we mention the Senator's Lounge, but we don't have anyone of course; he says we should go in with what we have and if we discover that we *do* need an advocate we can find anyone with the same silk cravat as him and they can assist.

At the Senator's Lounge, we are greeted by someone who is checking entry credentials. We explain our reason for being here very briefly & present the Third Speaker's seal. That works immediately. We're told to go inside, up one level, then on the right there are three doors; we want the middle one. This takes us to "the Searloon contingent - you will find your people there".

Well, whatever that means, we follow instructions to see what happens.

Inside the room accessed by the centre door, we are once again asked what we want. We explain; so a petition, we're asked? Well, we don't know what the proper form a request should take, but - well, yes, then? And do we have anything official from the Third Speaker? We have the opalescent ball. Temo uses the sending stone when he realises we need a command word to activate it; the Speaker's Assistant fortunately is awake and passes that on ("Tomato Tomato" (!)) - and we, by request, leave the ball with the person who needs to talk to the Speaker. An assistant with a cravat of gold and white attends to us - an advocate of some kind, we learn.

The 'crystal ball' is activated. Ilithylia is sat there, dressed very properly. "Ambassador Smoothhands! I'm glad it reached you. I see you're in the Senator's Lounge? Good work. I am very nearly home - I shall exit Cormyr today."

The 'receptionist' and advocate ask about us needing a petition backed by her. "Oh, I am?" she says and Temo hastily says, "Yes, you remember" and "explains" about Cormyr. CHA-based stealth check 25; she figures out what he means - "I've been on the road a while. My apologies. Yes, that's correct."

There's an exchange of formalities, then Ilithylia addresses the gold-and-white-Cravat-wearing advocate, **Matthew** (we learn), to ask if he can help us draft up the requisite paperwork. "I hope to be home later tomorrow but if you could get the ball rolling on this, I would appreciate it; it is urgent. I will make haste to Selgaunt once I am home." We hear that the typical delays are 2-3 days except for anything heavily seconded that could be expedited.

It's tricky; the Speaker clearly isn't sure if a motion asking for Cormyr assistance for such a significant task would be approved, and isn't too sure how we might achieve it. She'll be with us in about 1-2 days; Matthew will help in the mean time; all we can do is keep pushing along and try to come up with ideas.

We need to be clear: The logical reasons for requesting Cormyr's assistance; and what we want Cormyr to do exactly. We also learn that there are two ways to get a petition heard - one is via a ballot process which can be slow, but is democratic; we have to get enough Speakers in the House to get enough people to push something forward. A lot of work and slow, but that could help downstream when it comes to actually approving the motion. The other is to get support of a Prime Speaker, but Saerloon's Prime Speaker is on a diplomatic mission and not available. Selgaunt has a Prime Speaker, as do cities called **Yhaunn** and **Ordulin**. All three are here.

From our map we know that Ordulin is inland, the City Of The Star; all five major roads in the region intersect there. Yhaunn ("ee-how-nnn") is North-Easter, in a natural harbour, closer to Cormanthor and at the mouth of the Dragonreach pretty much. They might be in the line of fire.

In the end, it's suggested that we attend the public gallery of the Forum. Matthew has a few hours of work so far, but if we get more solid soon, the better. "What would help, I think, is getting a feel for what the Senate thinks about some of the key issues here. Sembia has never participated in a war in its entire history. It has succumbed to invasion, but it has never marched upon anything. Sembia's might is wielded in economic and academic ways. We win through cultural influence and mercantile strength."

Forum, then.

### 9am

The public gallery still isn't too busy, even though it's busy outside with more people consulting the various advocates and so-on. A section is less populated and another section is more populated; we go for the latter, hoping to get a feel not just for the senate, but also for the population's feelings on issues. When we get there, we realise it's the more sunny side and *that's* the only reason it is busier!

We choose a standing area at a railing that looks down over the speaker area; behind, we hope to overhear the public reactions. Temo luck roll, D20->20, which apparently means the session is just starting up.

The Speakers are easy to identify by their dress code - 3/4 sleeve, open very light cloth overcoat-like clothing, almost a kaftan. They carry stacks of papers and get seated. Support staff are with them, in less formal dress; some have the coloured cravats. The Speakers also have colours and we learn that these are representative of their cities and regions.

There are nods and greetings, basic formalities; then someone steps onto the main floor. They look around, waving a hand vaguely as if quickly estimating the number of people up in the galleries. They pick up a small conch shell horn and speak into it - somehow, their voice is amplified. A magic shell, then - some form of thaumaturgy.

"Speakers, Guests; please take your seats. We will begin shortly."

That's not aimed at the public gallery - it's an attempt to hurry people into the main chamber to take their assigned seats. It works and things pick up pace.

Now the coordinator Speaker picks up a small round crystal ball, places it onto a candelabra-like pedestal against a decorative mural wall behind him - almost like a large stone tablet, some 20ft high. The decorations on the "tablet" light up in various colours. He speaks:

"I call the 38th Day of the 462nd Forum Of The Senate to order."

The room goes fully quiet. Various formal greetings are announced. Then:

"Secretary of the Senate - Please bring forward the ballot box for today".

The box is presented; the coordinator opens the top and says, "Before we proceed with ballots, **are there are any Prime Speaker points of order to raise?**" and he looks around to the three Prime Speakers (with one conspicuously empty seat - that'll be Saerloon). Apparently, none today. Ballot, then.

A piece of paper is withdrawn and unfolded. "Brought by The 17th Speaker of Selgaunt" (who nods at this, looking pleased) - and the house Speaker reads on; a proposal to reduce the number of exam days at the learning institutions across the nation on account of standardised testing, and so-on and so-forth. A call is made to ask for firsts and seconds; other Speakers raise their hands at each.

There is to be a vote about escalating this to forum at this point, but someone debates that it's a waste of time at that; there's some back-and-forth for quite a long time, 8 minutes or so, before the house Speaker insists that it is voted upon.

Unfortunately, the vote does not go as hoped and the 17th Speaker does not get their topic debated.

Another topic. Reduction of inter-city taxes for goods that are made using components from more than one city. Temo whispers, "how are they going to react to, 'a move to defend Sembia against a horrifying mortal threat that at this moment walks below the surface of the Sea Of Fallen Stars intent on destruction of all life?'".

We learn more and more about how important the phrasing and wording is. It's a skill to get mundane yet potentially important things noticed by others, in a world where so many mundane yet potentially important things need to be discussed.

This time, the trade issue gets seconded. One of the Prime Speakers says that they want it to be forwarded for immediate vote before further debate because it's important; another seconds that motion; there is an immediate vote; it succeeds. It seems there are numerous potential variations of this process.

**We learn there are 61 speakers**, of which about 40 are present. Of this, 30 vote for this to be discussed, but we don't know much they were influenced by the Prime Speaker support. We see that the Speaker who had raised the ballot is delighted, there's even a small cheer from their group and he's clapped on the back - so we start to get the impression that the number of ballots vs the number actually *discussed* might be a rather steep ratio.

Things aren't even discussed straight away. There's a long tableau with slots on it, and the issue gets put into one slot. They fill up the slots first, then debate.

We listen on. Something to do with increasing pay of carriage drivers; this causes some contention because of city vs nation administration; at vote, it's completely defeated, less than 1/3 of the required votes. The ballot is even torn up! It doesn't go back into the pool.

* Selgaunt ballots should be clear on why they might be nation-wide, not just for this city.

* We also note that something with less than 1/3 votes can't even be discussed again. We've no idea for how long, but it certainly won't be considered the next day.

It's frankly a rather tedious process. It takes over an hour and a half to go through the ballot box and fill the slots. A lot of things seem to get defeated very quickly. It seems this might be a slow day; the House Speaker even seems to get exasperated at one point - "Do we have to debate every single ballot even *before* it gets to a vote?" and there are arguments about points of process; this actually does speed things up thereafter. Some 30-something motions are covered - but only 6 make it onto the tableau.

There is a ten-minute recess called, while time slots are written against each of the topic. We see what we think are news couriers who have taken notes and rush off; we later see a big board outside the hall that carries a duplicate of the info. It lets the public see which things they might want to observe, so that's why they have times against them.

Speakers who were successful go into huddles and strategy meetings immediately, especially the group who will be on the floor first!

We have much to discuss.

* 61 speakers; we'd need a good chunk on our side for a vote to be successful. We need a fair few just to not have the paper torn up! Yet they're busy and preoccupied with whatever ballots they themselves are already running.
* Getting at least one Prime Speaker to speak on the floor might tip the vote.
* And there might be 100-150 ballots in that box (4-7 days average time to get read out, and 30 done today).
* Can we magically tip the vote, if we were so minded...?

Abjuration - anti-tampering? - on the ballot box; divination spells; the shells are magical; oh. And a very unusually strong form of **illusion magic with threads of abjuration and divination** is on just one Speaker. That's very odd. Riglan points him out to Temo. An older man, with the **colours of Yhaunn**. "See if you can find out who that is" suggests Riglan, so Temo tries to persuade someone to talk to him. It is the **Tenth Speaker of Yhaunn**. Riglan is still watching. The Speaker has no support staff; he stands after collecting papers - looks like he's packing up, into a satchel - looks around - then looks, with his body at a particular place at a specific angle, as if avoiding something, starting to leave.

Riglan warns Temo - "I have to follow. You check his podium". He can see the magic aura. The guy is avoiding magical divination. He leaves the forum; Riglan follows in a sparrow form. The Speaker walks down from forum hill and heads in a Northwards direction towards the river. We came up on this street, the prior night; Riglan feels like he has no choice but to continue following. Now a hood is raised - unusual in this hotter climate - the speakers robes are removed, a cloak and hood instead; walks to the University; then gets to a quieter suburb; enters an apartment building. Riglan flutters in, trying to see which apartment it is. Two flights up. Stops at a door.

Riglan might be seen... Stealth 1! Crit fail!

The character turns and looks straight at the sparrow, fluttering awkwardly. Riglan sees the face clearly. The Speaker isn't there anymore. Hollow eyes. Gaunt expression. It hisses! Fangs appear... **VAMPIRE**. A wave of psychic energy blasts out. Wisdom saving as the sparrow - only nat 7+5, 12. He's forced to fly away. At least he *thinks* he knows which apartment it was.

Meanwhile, Temo stealth 28 - checking the podium. Investigation 19+15->34! He notices that there seems nothing left behind. He's looking for things like traps, magical bombs, anything... There's a lot of dust, settled around the seat. Musty. But we know the place is fastidiously cleaned daily, we were speaking last night to a cleaner! He gets a vial and takes a sample of the dust, for what that's worth.

Someone dressed in a different style - a leather breastplate - turns a corner to see Temo. "Excuse me sir - I don't believe you are part of the Yhaunn delegation? Are you lost?" Temo curses internally - *the divination sensors*. Temo says, "I was hoping to speak to the Speakers in the break, see if we can get support for a petition we have, but he's gone!" - the guard is trying to see if we've stolen anything; rolls high perception, sees we haven't; recommends we do that in the Senator's Lounge if we have access. Temo shows his lounge token - that's enough. The guard offers to 'escort' Temo and he points to Maireagh and Nethza, so he's 'escorted' to them.

First words out of Temo's mouth once he's alone with his friends - "There's something terribly wrong... We have to wait a bit but if Riglan isn't back soon we might need to go searching... Does this mean anything to you?" He shows the dust vial; Maireagh suggests an alchemist. Nethza asks "is Riglan in danger?" Temo insight 19. "That was very strange... Riglan had a very strong reaction; I had a bad feeling already; he... I think he might be in danger."

Nethza and Maireagh say "we need to find him. How do we even do that?" We head outside and Temo gets to the edge of the gardens and just tries looking around; Perception 17. Any sparrows? Well plenty, but none that look familiar! Any firbolgs? He's getting anxious and nervous...

...Riglan has stopped flying randomly around; he comes to his senses, Survival nat 1 (again!) -> 11. He lands and takes back his Firbolg form, heart racing. Wisdom saving as Riglan, 24. He grips his staff. Tries to centre on it. Speaks to it. It feels like it speaks to him. He asks a passer by where Senate Hill might be... "It's that way!" - they recommend a carriage. There's one right there, which is pointed out. He can run and take it. It's 5-6 minutes journey! He flew wildly while scared, clearly. So, 5-6 minutes later, he's back at Senate Hill, some 10 minutes after the party had started to look.

Temo and the others are have been running around side-streets when Temo suddenly remembers his Horn of Silent Alarm - and blows it, thinking of Riglan's name. Riglan hears it and knows where they are, so he takes off running.

It takes a few minutes, but the others have kind of being going in circles around the hill, not far away; and as they're asking after "a sparrow or a firbolg" he's running down. Nethza runs - "oh my goodness! Are you OK?"

Riglan explains. "We're in serious trouble... The Tenth Speaker is a vampire." "It can't be" says Maireagh. "It's broad daylight." Nethza says "But the Shadowfell vampires could move in the day..." Riglan is horrified; "Oh. Wow. It must be one of Azalin's generals." "They're **already here?!"**" - Temo, Arcana 23. "Of course. The vampire isn't moving with Azalin if Azalin has gone underwater. Nothing I read talked about the vampire generals going underwater with him."

Temo pulls out the sending stone, and says into it, "I don't want to alarm you, but we just found out that the Tenth Speaker of Yhaunn is in fact being impersonated by a vampire who is one of Azalin's generals and already here in Selgaunt. However hard that might to be believe, I assure you of its truth, horrifying though that is."

There's an immediate response of course. "What? Wait. *What?!* That - that actually doesn't surprise me - that they've made it this far. But... But - Loic was a dear family friend of ours. Are you... That means - ... He's dead? Or captured? Or something?"

Temo answers back. "We do not know in truth but it is likely. We saw an apartment into which this vampire went, whether he lives there or not we are not sure; I don't want to speak on behalf of my party but I feel inclined to engage immediately in case there is any hope of rescue."

"Please let the speaker know. Loic is a family friend of Ilithylia's."

Temo says "I am sorry, we can do that tomorrow, but the Senate already used the crystal ball today."

"Oh. No matter. I will contact her. Please be careful! Can you please let this person know your whereabouts..." - she tells us the name of another Speaker's Assistant, who's in Selgaunt. If we fall, she needs to know where we fell. Fair. We rush to that location. Back up the hill, inevitably.

We find an attendant - senate is already back in session. Persuasion 17+15->32. The attendant understands the urgency - and real fear, in Temo's voice. They *run* to get the Assistant. We unload quickly - the very short version of everything, with all the proof we have. "Are you going there now?" "Yes" "I'll try to get the city watch to assist you, but it might take a while..."

And so, we run!

As we run, Riglan shouts, "This is a rescue mission. If we find someone alive, or someone who could be brought back, getting them safe is more important that killing the vampire. Whether or not we have that option will be up to *it*."

Riglan survival 10+7->17; he manages to remember, despite the fear, of where he flew before the fear. We *run* through the busy university, scattering people aside as people wonder what on earth we're doing. "This way! Down this way!" shouts Riglan, as we run down between neat rows of apartments. "This building!" says Riglan, almost overshooting... There's a moment of remembered fear; adv wis save, (1,6)+10->16, he manages to catch himself. Running up the stairs, he stops; second door along. Now he's quiet. Points with his staff at the door and activates it.

Nethza draws the blade of shadow. Temo's bow was already drawn as he ran. Maireagh moves in front of the doorway and whispers, "Everyone... Remember *who* we are..." - she casts Aura Of Purity. We all suddenly experience memories; she has focused on a picture she made of all for of us, which seems to surround us like a giant hologram; it imprints on our mind. Lots of advantages as long as we keep close. Riglan whispers back "Thanks - I caught with my pants down - no good spells, still have Windwalk - I guess we'll make it up as we go along..."

He kicks down the door. Athl 24. It slams open. Smallish apartment, that he takes in very quickly. A small table near a kitchen area. Two armchairs with a low coffee table in between. Pictures on the walls. Curtains drawn shut - it's dim light. Two doors lead off the room, to the left. Both doors shut.

Riglan casts Locate Creature, to try and figure out which door it might be behind - or if it is even here. He senses it is definitely here; but *not* behind a door. He calls "it's here and invisible, directly in front of me". Riglan moves into the room just inside the door and to the left, to make space; Temo likewise, to the right, hoping his Blindsense will be able to figure out where the creature hides. He readies an action to fire if he "sees" the creature. It's not within 10ft right now; the apartment is quite large, about 30x45ft.

Temo inches cautiously forward. He gets a little way into the room when he senses the creature; he shouts out the location and fires. 1, can't roll 1, 20 (yes for real, crit), but not sneak! Dammit. 2d6+6 and a bad roll, only 11 damage. Initiative:

* Temo 24
* Maireagh 19
* Nethsa 8
* Riglan 7 :-(

Temo knows it's extremely dangerous but just has to aim and fire. No crit but a very solid 38 damage. That makes its mark! For a moment it flickers into visibility but seems to suddenly regain its spell. Temo shouts, "Dammit! It has that - that thing - things can do - you know - like dragons..."

Maireagh runs in, dog close behind, seeing where Temo is pointing; the dog runs under the chair that the vampire is standing upon. Maireagh has to attack with disadvantage, throwing her hammer; it still hits. 2d8+8, but rolls a 2 and 1, only 11. She decides to use Arcane Jolt for 2d6->8 force damage on top for 19 total damage. It stays invisible. Her second attack hits too, 8+3+8->19 (again, albeit in a very different way!) but again, it stays invisible.

She instructs the dog to try its luck, but it can't find the invisible vampire.

Temo loses sight of the creature and shouts "It's moved!" and Riglan is able to track the direction as his spell is still up.

Nethza runs in; Riglan says "Towards the kitchen, in the right corner" "You're sure about that?" "As much as I can be!" and she casts Dispel Magic over that area. Success! It appears, hissing angrily. "Tenth Speaker, I presume?" says Riglan. In the dim light, Riglan sees it shrouded in shadow; gaunt, especially dead-looking. A lich *and* a vampire? Is that possible?

Possible or not, Nethza hexes it. She runs around to the right, but can't get close.

The vampire seems to heal by drawing on shadows around it. Then it acts further. It raises its hand; the door behind us slams shut. More shadows seem to gather around it and its eyes glow with a dusty green flame, reminiscent of the Shadowfell. "Ah. Convenient. Both of my targets in one room." - it looks at Riglan. "Thank you. YOU are the little tweety bird. Good little tweety bird - bringing them to me!" It raises a beautiful, gleaming, regal-looking rod - which emanates some strange, oppressive presence. "Now all of you will bow before the power of Azalin Rex! Kneel!"

(Rod of Rulership) Wisdom saving for all except the dog, with adv. thanks to Maireagh.

* Riglan 22
* Nethza 16
* Maireagh, helped by Maireagh via Nethza reacting to inspire -> 16, saves
* Temo 13, helped by reaction of Maireagh to 18

We all save - by the skin of our teeth. Two reactions gone though. This does not make the vampire happy! "Pah" - it throws the rod across the room, clattering against the wall and onto the floor. Now, instead, it looks at Maireagh. "You maybe old, crone, but you understand *nothing* about the curse of life undying! Feel the pain!" - it curses her; this saps her wisdom! The effect is profound - it looks like she's immediately badly affected, as she reels from the impact.

Riglan sees what happened to Maireagh and feels no choice but to protect his friends. He steps forward, claps Maireagh on the shoulder; "You'll be fine, Dwarf!" and casts Greater Restoration. That gets the vampire's attention. Anger flashes across its face; a legendary action; in a strange whirl, it changes into a cloud of mist. At this, Riglan uses a bonus action to drop the Hawk totem - to help people try and see the creature. We're all very aware of its location. It has a shape.

Temo read about vampires. History 21. The mist cannot be harmed using any non-magical weapons. "Magical damage only on *that*" he shouts, then "and burn those curtains!" then aims and fires. It's a hit but mediocre damage by his standards - 31. Not enough to really get it that far down.

The mist flies next to Nethza, as if wanting cover - hiding behind her body! Maireagh is frustrated by the unexpected move. She decides to heed Temo's warning about damage types; she pulls out her multipurpose tool and casts a cantrip - *any* cantrip - in her case, Firebolt - on the curtain behind Nethza, near the vampire mist. It sets on fire immediately. She moves next to Nethza to try and support her, while the dog moves to harass the mist - but it can't attack.

At this the vampire turns back to its previous form. It knows Temo can attack it anyway now and the others are aware of its trick. Instead, it tries to grapple Nethza! Temo is on the very edge of casting Silvery Barbs, but Nethza is agile and throws up her shield to block it. Now she retaliates. She sheathes her sword with the booming energy we've seen many times now. "Try running away from *this* you - " a brief moment of uncertainty! - "...*fiend!*" - and attacks. It hits decisively; d8+6->14 (max) plus 5 for the hexblade's curse, so 19, then via Booming Blade, 2d8 more; another very solid 12; and so, all told, she matches Temo in a single swing - 31 damage.

That's good - but now the vampire acts. It heals for 20 as Temo, very concerned now, shouts "Stake through the heart! It's our only option!"; the vampire is looking straight at him; it points at him; "Oh you want to take me down, do you? You think that I will crumble to dust? No! It is you that will crumble to dust!"

It starts to suck all moisture out of Temo's body! Con save 17+2->19, half damage from the (woah) 10d8; 43->21 necrotic. Temo can't help against the worse effect - his max HP are reduced by the same amount and, worse, that heals the vampire a fair bit. Temo blew a luck point on that! The vampire looks enlivened somehow; its skin even starts to form, as it did when walking through sunlight. It seems less concerned about sunlight now and, as the sun burns through the curtains, it has no effect.

Riglan's turn to act. He moves to get a clear line of sight and throws a javelin, aiming for the heart. He *just* matches its half cover with an 18 attack roll. It doesn't hit the heart though; and worst possible damage roll, only 4. "Dammit!" shouts Riglan. "Temo, can you work with that?" - and as he calls, the vampire starts to try to turn to mist but the part impaled on the wooden javelin doesn't change and seems to "anchor" it back somehow.

Temo sees the vampire trying to turn into mist. The vampire is starting to pull the javelin out of its shoulder... He jumps up towards the table, to push off and spring at the vampire. As he does this, Maireagh uses her reaction to get the dog to Help by jolting the table towards Temo to help his movement; Temo Acrobatics adv 1,20 (for real) + 11 -> 31! He grabs the stake. Attack roll is dagger-like; +10; so 23, he hits. It's treated as a dagger, non-offhand attack. D4 is only 1, +5->6 total, plus sneak of 30; that's 36 total. He uses his off-hand with his actual dagger, which he hardly ever does; he does hit, 21, and D4 is max - 4 - and that is *just* enough. Exactly the requirement.

The vampire expires!

Its heart pierced, the vitality in its skin starts to draw back. It gasps and seems to try and draw blood from someone nearby, but Temo is too wriggly; its teeth are extended but they can't get purchase; it bursts into flame! Temo is in the flames but he does *not* let go. Dex save 16, but he holds on, in the flame.

"Temo get back!" Nethza shouts, grabbing both weapons - she resists fire - putting herself between Temo and the vampire, which screams and shrieks horrifyingly, thrashing in the sunlight - then collapses into a pile of dust.

The javelin is lost, and Temo takes 5 points damage from the fire. He's worse for wear - the life drain knocked him back a lot and he's a bit burned up. Riglan quickly checks on Maireagh after her curse then runs to Temo. Maireagh tries to heal him and while it clears his fire damage, it doesn't help anything else. She's very worried. Riglan's seen this before and says "We have to look after him a lot today. He'll be weak. But -" (and looks at Temo) "- you'll be all right in the morning."

Riglan asks Temo, "I know you're hurt, but can you search for that guy...?" and Temo investigates, searching the rooms. The first is a bedroom. The bed has been pushed up against the wall, elevated, vertically. Tied to it, as if on a cross, is an old man bound hand and foot, looking very weak. Multiple puncture wounds in his neck. Riglan rushes up and checks if he's alive; *just*. Hedging his bets against vampiric curse, Riglan casts his last Greater Restoration as Maireagh runs in and draws the curtains. Nethza unties him as Riglan pours a potion of healing into him (+8), the Greater Restoration allowing it to work.

He revives. At first he's afraid, then realises - "Oh - oh - no you must run! You must hide! There's a vampire here!" and Temo smiles and says, "We know. We got lucky - we managed to kill it... You're lucky to have Ilithylia as a friend..." - the man at that slumps to his knees, holding his hand. "Ilithylia, God bless her! What day is it? He's been - *feeding* on me - doesn't kill me..." Riglan says, "I don't rightly know the day by your calendar, but it was the..." (thinks) "...38th Day of the 462nd Forum Of The Senate". "Oh! I have been in here for a week!"

Temo says, "Well, would you like to get out? I think perhaps you could do with a drink and some food!"

He stands, walks out. "What is that?" and points at the rod. "Oh! He used that on me!" Temo answers "*THAT* is extremely nasty. We'll take it and, well, I'd love to sell it, but truth be told, we'd better just destroy it."

We pick up a Rod Of Rulership. Riglan sighs. "We could use it. We could make the senate do our bidding, just like that. Why is it always so much easier for the evil guys?! The Forge at home will take care of *that* awful thing. We can't sell it. It must be destroyed."

First thing's first. We help clean up the guy with the stone, as Temo calls the Speaker's Assistant and simply says, "We got lucky. Vampire killed. Loic is safe." The response; "Blessed Ilmata! That's the first good news I've had since you arrived. I will let Ilithylia know. She will be very relieved. Thank you!" He also writes a note, and leaves it in the room for the city guard and/or whoever owns or looks after this place, explaining who to talk to at Senate. The person who was fetching the guard. He also investigates the ash while the others tend to Loic. Investigation a whopping 19+15->34. It's very familiar; he compares it to his vial. Same. Oh. That's odd. When it *died* it left this ash. And the creature had to feed on Loic, and we saw it sort of feed on *himself*. It seems that it as long as it has fresh blood, it can operate and even be resistant to sunlight, but the price is that it doesn't have that, it starts to crumble. The dust on the seat at the Senate perhaps explains its prompt departure and why, so soon after Riglan saw it, we all found it in such a decrepit state. Temo is surprised to find jewellery, too - 3 beautiful, *old* gold rings, with really large gems set into each. There's also a jewellery collar with dangling rubies; the metal is odd, though, almost black/purple, absorbing light. He puts them in his haversack to show everyone later.

He introduces himself as we do so. "I'm Loic" he says. "Please, may I know the names of my rescuers?" "I'm sorry!" says Riglan, "I forgot in all the excitement. Where are my manners? This is Maireagh, Nethza, over in the corner there is Temo and my name is Riglan."

"If you know Ilithylia, perhaps you know I am involved in the senate. I'm the Tenth Speaker of Yhaunn. May I ask one last favour?"

"Certainly!"

He steps outside. "Ah. I know where we are. Will you please accompany me to my apartments? I need to gather something there. And I will require your help to get me to Senate."

Riglan answers, "Happily. But as we go, I know you're tired and worried and have had a terrible experience, but I will explain to you why we are here. And how we came to meet Ilithylia. You may be able to help us in Senate youself!"

"Yes. Please tell me all, and how I could possibly be of assistance."

It's back up the hill. "Diplomatic Quarters", according to a sign. Loic leads us to his apartment. The housekeeper is surprised. "What's happened to you since this morning?!" "What do you mean?" "You looked fine this morning!" Loic is about to interject when Riglan hastily steps in, claiming that he'd had a nasty fall and we helped him, which is why he's beaten up... Deception only 11, but Loic backs us up, perhaps realising that saying "You've been housekeeping for a vampire all week" might not be a good story. Loic asks for tea. We're friends of his, and Ilithylia's - Temo shows the seal - "Miriam" lets us in.

Nethza offers to stand guard at his bedroom door for safety. He appreciates the gesture. Miriam makes tea with cookies and fresh juices. Temo is worse for wear but at least the cookies brighten him up a bit. Maireagh is quite shaken, but then snaps to - "Oh my! Where's Nethza?!" Riglan tries to be calm. "She's fine. She's upstairs" but Maireagh runs up the stairs. Riglan looks to Temo, **"Too brave by half once again, Mr Smoothhands. I've touched fire like you did today, and I don't care to do so again."**

Loic, Nethza and Maireagh return. Loic is barely recognisable, in full Speaker's Regalia. He's showered, hair brushed back, his Senate clothing and a beautiful walking stick. "Right. Off to Senate we go".

As we head off, thanking Miriam, we continue our story and manage to finish our story before reaching the Forum... "...so that vampire was very, very bad news, not least for you, but for all of us."

"I have a plan. But I need to pop into Senate briefly, let my fellow Speakers know that I will require their support for something tomorrow, then you and I will speak to Matthew and come up with a ballot to submit. All ballots must be in before 3. We have our work cut out for us. You can count on my vote to second yours. We will need to spend the rest of the day speaking to the Prime Speaker." "*The* Prime Speaker?" "For Yhaunn" "Ah! Of course."

"We need to talk strategy. That rod you have might be useful for theatrics."

He does whatever he needs to at Senate. Then we visit Matthew. He says, "I am an orator. I can create drama. And I think we need some drama and theatre to wake the speakers up to the dangers that they face. I don't think there's any point hiding the truth from them... That they have been harbouring an agent of this very threat, this ancient evil, right in the Hall of the Forum - none the wiser."

But we realise... This will cause panic. That might destroy society. People turning on each other - paranoia rampant. "But what use is power if you cannot wield it?!" says Loic, frightened and angry. Temo calms him down; he has to use his oratorial abilities to be persuasive and let the Senate read between the lines of the seriousness without panicking the population. 27 persuasion. Loic backs away from the metaphorical ledge.

"You are very wise for your age" Loic says to Temo. "Very wise indeed. A voice of reason. Have you ever thought about a career in politics?! I suspect you are someone who wants to achieve a lot more than that in life."

We can do a show and tell. Minor illusions of things in the Shadowfell. A very good tavern bard story. The public are entertained - but because of *who* it comes from, the context, the *Senate* understands. Loic thinks we should also tell the Speakers "behind the scenes" so they understand. He's scared at his own words - *to hide things from the public, awful!* - but recognises the necessity. "One of the founding principles of this republic is transparency. The Forum itself was built to reflect these ideals and principles, that every debate of the Forum - every act - was open to public scrutiny. We have dark times ahead. We must do what we have to do, and also shore up our defences; strengthen our minds and hearts; do everything we can do to also shore up the tenets of democracy so there's something left after we save ourselves."

Riglan steps forward. "We minimise the information we hide. That Azalin has vampire generals who can assume the identity of another so accurately that even their lifelong housekeeper doesn't know, is not helpful to share! But the fact we face a threat of this nature - perhaps that we do *not* hide. The public may react with disbelief, or hopefully, *trust* in the behaviour of the Senate. They seem the Forum acting in their interest."

"That rod. That rod forms a pivotal part."

"You want me to *use* it?!"

"No. Deflect attention onto it, rather than identity theft. That's too frightening."

"So our deception for the public is that you were you, but under this spell; but what Speakers will be told as truth in private, will be about the vampire. The bad story!"

"Yes. So the public understands why the Senate votes how it has, while the Senators need the truth."

"Good. And the public will have no reason to fear or distrust *each other*."

Matthew clears his throat. "I hate to break this session up, but we only have four hours to complete this draft and submit it. We have to get to work. Most importantly - have you decided what you want to ask the Senate *for*?"

No! It's still the morning. We were going to watch the Forum... Loic backs down. Perhaps we don't need to do this today. He was frightened and pushing... It's better to wait for Ilithylia. He wants to stoke up the fires of action now! But Ilithylia can bring it to the floor under *her* ballot, complete with evidence. He can add his voice and hopes his Prime Speaker can voice her support too. Coupled with anything we can do speaking to people behind the scenes, that ought to be enough.

There are four hours more of the Senate. We ask if the others think that we should spend the time ourselves in the Forum, learning more of its ways? Loic thinks we should perhaps strategise more about which Speakers could be talked to. If we pick the right ones, they can talk to more themselves.

"We will have an hour, at lunch - 11:30-12:30". We have less than 30 minutes to form our strategy. Loic's idea of picking the more influential ones seems sound. We think that on our part, focusing on Saerloon - if any of their other Speakers here "count" - would be more successful since we bear the Third Speaker's seal. Loic wants to prioritise the Prime Speaker of Yhaunn. "Can we help?" "Yes. I will need you with me." Riglan nods. "So be it."

Matthew adds, "Not to be a stickler, but please do think about what exactly we're submitting a ballot for. I don't need it today but I will need it."

Temo gets back on the sending stone. "I hate to press, but unless we are able to have a reasonable idea of emergence location for Azalin *and* have the supporting evidence *in Senate*, we are unlikely to be able to make a case. We hope to have our ballot read on the day Ilithylia arrives. Do you think that's possible?" There is a fairly long delay. "I am doing my best. Look, can I send you everything I have? My hands are full. This is far as I've been able to get. I can't make sense of it any further than this. Can I send you a drawing of the map with the locations that I have plotted and transcripts of the reports?" Temo answers, "I am very sorry if I have caused you stress with the difficulties of our timing. I know you have worked extremely hard and we are very much in your debt. Please do send along anything you have, thank you." "Are you going to be staying Loic, or should I send it to The Fair Trial again?" - so Temo asks Loic. "You might be a target. But so are we. If you were attacked, we could help, but we might just as well bring an enemy to your door. What say you?" "I have stared a creature of death in the eye *and failed* before. I am only here because of you. Let the warmth of my fire be your warmth and your fire. I would be honoured to have you as guests at our diplomatic apartment." Temo thanks him and answers accordingly on the Stone. "I'll get these sent over by ship immediately. Expect them before the end of the day." "Thank you."

We ask Loic if he as a specific angle we want with his Prime Speaker, or do we just wing it? He thinks the Prime Speaker needs to know everything - and how likely it is that Yhaunn be the first of the Sembian cities in line of fire."

"Well, it's the most Northern and Eastern. And it lies across the narrowest stretch of sea from the other sea" says Temo. "I'm not a betting man - not any more! - but if I were (and we'll hopefully be able to figure it out tonight when the Assistant's parcel arrives) then I'd pick that city."

Loic answers, "I will also send for the Yhaunn cartographer's academy's detailed seabed maps of our region. It may help you figure out a likely egress point." Temo is happy at that - "yes! Certainly if there are any obvious trenches or other obstructions in the way, it might changes things considerably." "Will you meet me **The Beaten Pulpit**" (a cafe) "as the Prime Speaker always has her lunch there. It's in the Dress Circle on Senator's Terrace". "We'll be there at 11:30!" Meanwhile, Loic is going to go and organise the Cartographer. "Just look for me; I will find me and sit myself at her table."

We head there directly, to just see where it is. Temo leads the way. Senator's Terrace is the same one we walked past last night which was full of people on the street and balconies drinking. Dodgy tavern pun names abound; we get to the Beaten Pulpit, which looks old. He asks Riglan to cast Detect Magic *outside* and look in the windows.

No magic on the outside - no wards or illusion, not even the sign. We go inside. Temo speaks to the staff as the maitre de welcomes us. We're led to an upper terrace and as we go, Riglan notices a couple of booths with curtains which can be drawn closed for privacy, which have transmutation and divination auras - magical privacy, not just physical. Nothing untoward, then - except for a *bit* of conjuration and transmutation magic coming from the open kitchen he can see beyond. An oven in particular has a weak magic. As the others continue Riglan drops behind and peels off into the kitchen to get a closer look. It seems like a shadow of former strength, whatever this magic is; old; rune-embedded magic on the stoves, this oven in particular. He looks up at the chef, who is already looking at Riglan in surprise; "Magical stoves?" asks Riglan. "What an accusation! Just good recipes passed down the generations!" - insight 22 - a cheeky glint in the eye of the chef. Riglan laughs and says, "Well, good food is good food, and I look forward to it. Apologies for the intrusion." "Not many notice this! Keen eye. Do me a favour and keep it to ourselves?" "Of course!"

Riglan catches up. Nethza noticed he'd gone and checks in - nothing bad. But Riglan thinks the food might be good here.

The maitre de asks where we'd like to sit; or maybe a terrace drinks bar area, where we can watch the crowd? Hints are - mingle or network. We go for that. It starts getting busy quickly enough, while we've ordered a "house speciality", a rectangular plate of perfect-looking sprats, perfectly grilled, accompanied by a deep bowl of special house-made sauce. We order a drink just to fit in, but non-alcoholic. "Bright-eyes juice", green, refreshing - ginger, apples, mint, herbs and more. Apparently popular with those up at the Senate in the afternoon.

Riglan perception nat 20 (always on the less important checks LOL) + 10 -> 30. Loic comes in, with a woman looking about 10 years younger - in her 50s, or possibly younger still. She has an assistant with her and Loic has a younger man that seems to be tagging along, dressed in Speaker clothes. They walk across to a table and as they start to sit and Loic catches Riglan's eye. Riglan gets the group to move down.

As we approach, Loic greets us. "Ah! Prime Speaker **Serenae**! These are the people I was telling you about. Friends and associates of young Ilithylia." The Prime Speaker greets us by surname, proving she already knows them (including "Lady Nethza" who has none). We are also introduced to **Adarth**, the "youngest Speaker" in Yhaunn (and the most recent). He's 18th Speaker now.

At this point Loic shifts us to a private booth. The maitre de thinks we musth be networking or something - wielding influence! - so is happy to assist.

We have privacy. It's all laid on the land. In a remarkable twist of fortune, Adarth interrupts before we even say "Azalin Rex" and speaks the name himself. It was his Major at University! He studied the ancient Netherese Empire.

After some tough conversations, we calm everyone down enough - very freaked out, especially Serenae's assistant **Lucy**! - to the basics. To tackle this, we want to engage the help Cormyr. Serenae is in her element with this. She lists people who would not support such a vote; not comfortable with Cormyrean troops marching along the Golden Road, the only route to the coast, which goes through Ordulin. Those people will be our biggest opponents. Their Prime Speaker has a bit of an "iron vice" around their senators and they tend to all vote as block. And Ordulin command 16 votes.

Someone who knows the Ordulin Prime Speaker really well is **Tallin**, we're told; no longer a Speaker but deeply involved in politics. Hangs out at the Senator's Lounge. She was a speaker for Ordulin for years prior and is one of the longest serving Senators; been voted in for almost the entire time - only losing a seat once or twice, working across different provinces. She knows Ordulin really well as a result of all that.

The difficult part of this is having to hide the story about the vampire impersonating Loic. But we can:

* Have the town guard's report of the apartment with "an agent" of Azalin identified by the ash.
* We have the rod that we found there for show & tell (and when we pull this out of the bag, Adarth is horrified - "That is a Netherese artefact!" and points out inscriptions and stylised parts. So that's fairly convincing! Perhaps keep this until last for its theatrical effect. *The* Rod Of Rulership. It couldn't be more opposed to Sembian ethics if it tried.
* On the less convincing but supporting front - a map, the reports, plots and assumed exit position summarised.
* Temo's show & tell, which is really for the public's benefit but just all adds to the theatre.

Adarth offers his help. He wrote his Masters on the ancient evils of the East and that particular time period. For sure! It would be very good to have more information.

### 8000 XP each -> just scrape into LEVEL 15

(Once we next get a chance to Long Rest... Temo gets Slippery Mind. Riglan gets L8 spells but, for now, chooses to learn Sunbeam, since it seems more useful for smaller scale, closer-quarters battles with undead, especially vampires. L8 Sun*burst* sounds like just what the doctor ordered for a battle of armies, though. Nethza takes Power Word Stun. Maireagh finds way to significantly bolster the dog's resilience).

Temo can't hold it in any longer and says "Forgive me if I cause offence, I'm rather tired after the battle, somewhat injured I think - but - Adarth, why do you pronounce it that way?" "What?" "Azalin Rex." "Oh! I am from a younger generation. We don't speak the language of our elders..." - Temo insight, nat 3, luck point, nat 3 again! + 1, 4. He has no idea if that's true - "...the younger generation just don't speak the old tongues. Besides, you wouldn't understand me if I did."

Temo might need to get some divination help with that.

Lucy will get onto the cartographers. The Prime Speaker will convince who she can, but we need to find *Tallin* to see what we can learn about Ordulin, our biggest obstacle. So with everything finished up, we ask to pay for our sprats but Loic "tsks" at us! "I know you don't mean to be offensive, but you MUST NOT pay for this!" He explains that he invited us to lunch and, in this culture, that means he pays.

As the group heads off, Adarth walks ahead to catch up with our group of four, as we walk faster and pull ahead. "Hello" says Riglan. "Tagging along?" "What are you intending to do with that rod?" "Show it at Senate as evidence; otherwise, guard it with our lives until we get back home. We have access to a magical forge which will destroy it."

Adarth pauses then says, "It is a very problematic artefact... There are a lot of freedoms that were hard-won here in Selgaunt, in Sembia as a whole... How much do you know of our recent history?" We explain what little we know. He summarises; "We were occupied! Netherese walked these streets and wielded their authority. They threw the then-standing army of Sembia into conflict with our neighbours - used our troops to invade the Dale Lands and to fight the armies of Cormyr. Our people died under the yoke of risen Netheril. That artefact you hold will win you no friends."

"So you council that we should not show it?"

"I think for dramatic effect you should - but know that unless you are able to answer with conviction and... *Actually* convince people that you mean no harm when you get asked what I asked - and you will be, repeatedly! - it could backfire on you. Not the showing of it, but your reputation might not survive much past the voting of the bill."

"Well, we have no reputation; that's half the problem. We're outsiders with no credence or track record."

"I am hesitant to council you one way or another. I can merely tell you my feelings and you have to do with that information as you see fit."

Riglan isn't sure. Is this trying to derail us?! Insight 15+10->25. It's genuine concern; no deceit; however, there's subtext. There's something unspoken that he is trying to hide. It seems very practiced, like he's very practiced at hiding something.

Riglan says, "There's something more. You have a personal involvement."

He's taken aback. "What makes you say that?"

"Well, a feeling. Cues. Well hidden, and I don't mean to embarrass or coerce you. But I would... Like to trust you."

"Have you seen people like me where you come from?"

"Academics?"

"No. Who *look* like this."

Riglan perception 14; not great. He's human... He has very pale olive skin. Almost pink, but not quite. Almond-shaped eyes. Certain features, reminiscent of some rare encounters on the Sword Coast; a bit more common here, perhaps 1 in 4. Riglan can only answer, "I see some things which are rare, but not unfamiliar; I see some of you features more common in others in these lands; I do not know what means of an origin."

"There are certain things that I can pass as. I pass as people of the Inner Sea" (this area) "but these eyes betray my genetic legacy. There are specific citadels and cities, great cities on the Sword Coast, and a few here, who took in the refugees of Netheril when the sky cities fell and the empire crumbled. I am descended from the Netherese. We have had to keep this hidden for the last couple of decades."

Riglan nods. "I bet. Well that's not something we'll share outside this group."

"I merely wish to warn you that despite all the reason and enlightenment that you see here, there are some base instincts common to many humans and other races besides which are deep seated and hard to dispell."

Riglan points at Nethza. "Have you seen *those* kinds of features?"

"Yes!"

"Well where we come from, those elicit those same deep-seated instincts in some."

"They do?! Interesting. We have enough awareness and trade with **Mulhorand** to have a different understanding of those with infernal and Elysian features."

Riglan says "Yes. It's about understanding and familiarity. We are used to such things. But we understand your warning. We probably don't have a choice but to take the risk; is there any way we can speak in a manner that resonates culturally that we are genuine?"

"What will cause fear is not knowing what you might do with the Rod Of Rulership. What *your* stance is about Netherese power and how sensitive you are in dealing with this and acknowledging it and how you handle the way that people react from their own personal experiences of what something like this means to them."

We reach the hilltop and Adarth excuses himself to head to the Forum, as we go to the Lounge.

On the way across the hilltop, Temo says, "I asked him about pronunciation as it startled me and led to my distrust. And then he explained his ancestry, as if that were bad, and it just made me trust him more. These cultures are further apart than I thought, yet share so much in common."

We ask at the entrance to the Lounge how we might find Tallin. She's well-known and we're given directions to where she probably is. We follow the directions and get to the Yhaunn lounge, not Ordulin. It's not hard to spot her! Someone holds court. A few people sat nearby listening to a story; she looks like she's in her late 60s or early 70s, yet is recounting a story that sounds of modern relevance. Her hair is fully white and thin, with clips holding it in place and held back. She has a practiced, distinguished manner, with a robe off one shoulder.

We hang around the door but she beckons us in - "don't wait over there! Come on in young ones! I was just telling everyone..." - and carries on here with story, about a ballot to pay all the drivers the same wage. It's been done not once but twice before! Ridiculous! Etc. - Temo is just looking for an angle to get into the conversation.

Things turn to politics. Tellin and Temo get into a well-mannered debate about equality and methods of governance. As things turn in the right direction, Temo finds a way to ask about tensions between Ordulin and Cormyr.

* It has no port, but acres of incredible farmland. Beautiful.
* The Golden Road leads through those fields.
* The last time the army marched, it caused great damage. Destroyed much of the countryside; was seen as disrespectful.
* The Cormyrean army didn't succeed the first time; risen Netheril was over the desert, resisted in Cormanthor, invaded the Dale Lands for more food, so whenever Cormyr was pushed back, Cormyr would destroy fields to cut off a potential supply of food to the Netherese.

The Ordulin Prime Speaker's ancestral estate was itself destroyed in one of these retreats. Of course, logically, this is all understood; monuments raised to the loss, to show gratitude of the republic for the sacrifices made, "but that doesn't change how a people *feel*". She asks if Sword Coast cities have ever lived through occupation - Temo, history 20+5 -> 25. Cities and areas invaded and occupied by orcs. Nesmé destroyed and now being rebuilt.

We get into it. Eventually Temo is forced to tell the story of Azalin. At the moment he describes him being pushed back about a century ago, Tellin lights up - about a century ago, **Tulthantar** emerged *from* the Shadowfell. Coincidence? Timing? Anyway, this continues and Temo gets to the point! The army coming to the coast.

Tellin lights up and TL;DR says there are four things wrong with his bill! Things to overcome.

* First, you have no target. The Senate and *absolutely* the Ordulin Block will never approve anything that allows for a free-roaming Cormyrean army. You *must* have a target and that needs to be in your bill.

* You need to raise the options of, and dispatch of, all the reasonable alternatives - which you have not described to me yet. If you do not do this, the debate will devolve into an argument about the merits of considering other alternatives and the entire Forum will descend into discussions of various other means. Your bill will be lost in the din! "The House Speaker will call Time on it. That would be a shame!"

* The third thing - you haven't mentioned any assurance - for *shame*. One thing that Sembians can predictably be counted on is their pride. Even if you are able to convince enough people that they *should* ask Cormyr for help, they may choose not to do so if it is embarrassing for them, or if there's any chance for Cormyr to use this as an opportunity to say "no". "Meaning - how sure are you that Cormyr will even agree to this?"

* Last, the Ordulin Block votes that way - as a block. They are led by their Prime Speaker - **Hepheast** - "nothing if not as stubborn as the oxen that he farms. You need to be prepared for Ordulin to place a condition on their approval, that the Cormyrean army not pass through Ordulin - they would be forced to take other roads."

Riglan has an epiphany. **We're not supposed to get the army to Yhaunn**. The oracle didn't see us meeting Azalin there with an army. The odds against approval from the Senate are small. **Instead Sembia should be the herald; the rallying cry; a Cormyrean Army marching *North*, bound for Zhentil Keep, perhaps picking up Cormanthor along the way**.

And that brings up marching time. We only have about 16-17 days left. Cormyr's capital is Suzail, way over to the West; their army could march out of there, if so stationed, Northwards towards Zhentil Keep. We ask Tallin and she thinks grain traders take about 2 (7-day) weeks to get to Cormyr, so not much more for the capital to Yhaunn.

### 1:30pm

We thank Tellin. Temo leaves a card, "I am in your debt!" and after the usual pleasantries we exit.

Con saves! DC10

* Nethza & Maireagh - both fine
* Riglan: 5+3->8 + 5 from Maireagh helping shore him up a bit with some tea she has in a flask!
* Temo: 2+2->4 + 5 from the tea too

The dice are poetic given Riglan's exertions as a bird and of course Temo's life drain. It amounts to disadvantage on intelligence-based checks. Reliable Talent does still apply for applicable skills.

We have to tell Matthew. The breakfast pastries! They're still in the chest of preserving as we never had time to eat them this morning when we rushed off to the Senate. It's been a very busy time since then (and we woke up at 4am, too). The pastries do take the edge off the news of our change of direction.

Temo uses the Stone to message the Speaker's Assistant; "Forced to change plan. Emergence likely at Yhaunn. Cormyrean Army cannot meet there. Likely large scale confrontation instead at Zhentil Keep in roughly 5 weeks time." After a short pause - "Speaker Ilythilia is due back tomorrow. We will make haste for Salgaunt."

Next, it's time to catch up with Loic, but he's in chambers. We figure we could watch more of the sessions at Forum. Before that, Temo is exhausted. The lounge has some serviceable food and drink; we just have some downtime (equiv. short rest, mostly for colour).

### 3pm

We return to the public gallery to observe actual debates. We find ourselves listening in on "Member's Bill" debate (we're not too sure what that is) about creating a new zone in between Cormyr and Sembia where there are fewer restrictions on trade on both sides; some geography-specific free-trade zone, brought by Cormyr (and of course we pay attention to whoever it is that's on the side of Cormyr!)

Debate is heated. What will it do for city revenues? Who will pay for it - all city states? - will it not benefit some more than others; those closer to Cormyr, able to reach this new zone more easily? Yhaunn does not stand to benefit much, for example, since most of their trade is by sea. And so-on. Some think it strengthens bonds, others think it's thinly veiled bribery for a few people who seek to benefit. And, again, so-on.

(Temo at one point grasps Riglan's leg, in urgent half-whisper... "Riglan. Riglan! Is there a vampire down there? Tell me there's a vampire down there. At least that'll keep me awake!") **(Riglan is happy - he knows Temo isn't actually that bored, but it's a relief to hear some of Temo's old humour)**.

There's one group who refer to themselves as "The Old Republic", who seem to be very closely tied to Ordulin, but are being treated oddly - as if some kind of separatist faction within the senate, especially by younger senate members; tolerated, rather than respected. This faction fiercely supports Ordulin and tries to protect Ordulin's points of view; support of an Old Republic structure, back when Ordulin was the Capital. At least this indicates a rift between old and young - is this something we might need to know and use when (if?) our own bill is read? That said, it's the same kind of "traditions vs respectfully moving forward" debate that is seen so often between an older and younger generation, on just about any topic in any corner of the land.

Surprisingly, a compromise of sorts are reached. Watered-down proposals, with some kind of shipping improvements but not much else. The original supporter of the ballot isn't too happy with this; watered down, it's more meaningless and would probably cost more to implement than it would save! A vote is cast. It is close, but the bill is defeated.

### 4pm

As it happens, this was the last session of the day - it's already beyond 3pm, so in fact they ran late.

The house Speaker says, "I declare the 38th Day of the 462nd Forum Of The Senate adjourned."

People group into their various factions pretty quickly. Riglan insight nat 20 + 10, 30. He had been worried that people were being kinda nasty at times in debate - very passionate, arguing - but as the Forum is adjourned, groups speak. There seems to be no animosity. Camaraderie, conviviality out of Senate. It seems genuine. So they separate the proceedings of the floor from their personal feelings. Some continue to talk about the debate but in a different tone - reconciliatory.

Riglan seems some less genuine interactions though. People being civil but it seems they keep cards to their chest - it seems that this is the 'done thing', decorum, for "out of senate". In any case it's a mix, but mostly positive. 

Temo suggests we adjourn ourselves to the Senator's Lounge, to see if Loic is there. Riglan, perception 25 - he points; Loic is there! We make our way down.

Loic introduces us to a couple of the other Yhaunn speakers and another from Selgaunt, as well as one from an outlying city towards the West. We recognise this as the speaker whose bill was defeated. Temo says, "Commiserations. I hope you're not too upset?" "Onward and upward is our motto! There was always the possibility it wouldn't pass. It would have been great for our province - prosperous times ahead - but I understand the protectionist tenancies of some of the other cities, particularly Searloon. It is always a pity though because so much work goes into these and so many people pin their dreams on them; but if there's one thing that's certain about the Senate, it's that nothing is for certain! Tomorrow is another day."

Once we get the chance and some privacy, we let Loic know how things went with Tallin. We're changing tactic, but it does still leave us with the question of how to defend Yhaunn.

Loic's assistant, **also called Lucy**, says that she has her team working hard to procure the topography maps of the seabed. They also have people looking out for "anomalies", now that they know what kind of weird natural aberrations to look for. **The team will work overnight and there'll be skimmer messengers by mid-morning tomorrow. We agree to have that sent to Matthew at the Senator's Lounge.**

Loic intends to swing by the Dress Circle on his way home. "Social obligations". We ask if he wants company, or would prefer handle the politics without our distraction. "Did you not want to speak to **Myraros**?" (the First Speaker of Ordulin) he asks. "Well... Sure!" Loic adds "And who knows. If we pick the right tavern you might even see one of the others, especially **Timothaeus**" (the First Speaker of Selgaunt).

We accompany Loic.

Temo, performance (!) 27 (to see if we can attract attention). Timothaeus is here, but sadly Myraros not. Prime Speaker Serenae of all people gives us an "in". We get into it; the short version of why we're here; Serenae's assistance helps him follow the correct etiquette to not just be straight-up seen to be garnering support for a bill (influencing the senate) even though that's kinda what we're doing! Persuasion 26. It's rephrased more as we had intended; "helping people understand the detail" behind the bill's summary.

There's some surprise expressed that Ilithylia brings the bill rather than **Atanasius**, the Prime Speaker of Saerloon - we can't comment, except to say that things moved *very* quickly once we combined our knowledge with Ilithylia's back in Yartar. She isn't even back here herself. This raises the question of how *we* got here so quickly - the portal - and that gets Timothaeus's attention for sure; those are meant to be used only in very serious emergencies. "Let's say that you have my interest!" he summarises. Serenae recognises this as a good place to leave things and elegantly steers the discussion away from politics.

Temo con check is a dodgy 11, Riglan only 7... Trying to observe etiquette and decorum has meant we failed to observe how much we were drinking. Nethza and Maireagh are fine. That's a pity as we hoped to move on and maybe find Myraros, but it seems - not today.

### 5:30pm

Somewhat merrier than they should be, but at Maireagh and Nethza's quiet encouragement, Riglan and Temo eventually finish up the pleasantries and head out of the tavern, in search of food. Loic gives us a key to the house so we can get in any time, very kind of him.

We are in good company on the streets of people in search of food while definitely not needing any more drink... We have to let Nethza and Maireagh take the lead on that. Maireagh wants to get out of the Dress Circle and we decide to take a carriage down towards the docks. This one finishes at The Exchange, which is pointed out in the city below - not the docks - "don't tell the senate - but that is the heart of the city!" - we assume some kind of goods and services hub. Is there good food? "There is *nothing* you will not find at The Exchange!"

Riglan and Temo this time opt for the downstairs carriage - upstairs is moving too much!

Four stops, buildings that are older, many plants growing on them. Beautiful avenues down there as we turn away from the docks; they form an arch of branches over the road, possibly grown that way deliberately. Terraces, children playing in a large field with a ball; then we reach The Exchange, which we'd seen from the hill as a sort of five-pointed star style set of five triangular buildings around a circular "empty" centre circle, or seemed that way from the distant view we had. We figure it won't be empty and head that way - indeed, now as night falls, it's a beautifully lit open air market. Colourful sails strung across areas, strings of lights in jars hanging off ropes, larger bright lampposts here and there, and in the very centre a sort of circular sand box or sand pit, where lots of couples of various ages dance to the lively music being played by a band situated nearby.

It reminds us of the big market in Waterdeep, except this is enclosed by the five near-identical buildings rising some 4 storeys high - and *this* has the dancing area.

Riglan and Temo say "we can dance off the drink!" and head straight for it, surprising Maireagh and Nethza who have to abruptly turn and hurry to catch up. The music is unusual - a complex, syncopated rhythm; there's no required skill here. People are just happy and carefree. Riglan and Temo try to get Maireagh and Netzha into the spirit. "We hardly ever get to do this. Especially without having to perform ourselves!" - Nethza needs no convincing. Maireagh takes a little more, especially with Temo's 2+15->17 persuasion but after getting the dog to guard our bags joins in.

We dance for a good ten minutes or so. Alcohol burns off a little. *Now* we notice the smells - food, everywhere. Lots of people seem to have the same kind of small clay bowls with lots of different foods inside. The more we look, the more we see and the harder it seems to choose!

Riglan asks Maireagh to pick something. He's spoiled for choice and is happy with whichever place catches her eye. She wanders off, the comes back, eyes wide! "Look! They sell *these*!" - and holds up an entire cauliflower, that has been clay oven baked and covered in spices. It's such a strange choice but it looks *really* good. It sits in one of the clay bowls; someone notices us trying to figure out how we're going to actually eat it... They point out places where cutlery is stationed. Long forks and tubs of water for the used bowls.

Temo points out, "If I do anything with the Lord's Alliance, it should be to take some of these ideas to Yartar - the standard bowls and those cutlery stations would save a lot of effort for the food stalls so they could focus more on the food."

Nethza spots a place that does meatballs. There are small circular flatbreads for dipping in sauces. Shops sell small trinkets. Riglan guys Nethza a trinket of her choice; she finds a small bracelet, brass chain with small charms hanging off. 1gp, paid from Riglan's pot.

### 6:30-7pm ish

It's the first time we've seen the city fully dark from down within its busy streets. It's well lit. Even the trees are illuminated. We realise nobody is drunk - in fact nobody is selling any. We keep going, just soaking in the atmosphere.

### 7:30pm

Time to head back. Temo's starting to really struggle and we *did* wake up at 4am. Temo suggests though that we should let The Fair Trial know that we have by chance ended up with other accommodation, so we catch another carriage back up the hill and within ten minutes or so we're at the hotel. We ask if they want to take the room back, but it's been blocked out for 4 days anyway and they're happy to keep it that long just in case, which suits us fine.

Then we wander back to Loic's house, just off the Dress Circle. It doesn't take long. We use our key, but as we put the key into the door it opens and the housekeeper greets us. She tells us there's extra food in the pantry if we want it and shows us to a nice room with four beds. We're quite happy to sleep in a group.

Yawning heavily, Temo sets up Alarm and then crashes out. He falls asleep immediately. The rest of us take a moment just to chat quietly. Nethza goes to a French door leading to a balcony, opens it heads out. It looks out away from the street, over gardens of these various apartments. Riglan asks, "How are you feeling?"

"I don't know! I honestly don't. It's not bad. I don't think things have gotten bad! I hesitate to say things are good. We don't know. I guess I feel anxious."

Riglan nods. "Yes, me too, but it seems we're on - well, track, whatever the track is. Seems like we've got a shot with this bill, we've taken down a general, which was a surprise."

"How many of them do you think there are, here, already?"

"Don't know. But, if this area is where Rex is to emerge, this - state - then I guess he probably has as many as he can spare trying to mess things..."

Nethza interrupts "...He must know by now though."

"Know?"

"What's happened. Don't you think?"

"He seems to know just about anything. Spies I guess. Yeah he must be aware of the general. And he must know where we are too."

"I don't know if we've been lucky to avoid... I just don't know what's going on! Whether we've been lucky, he's been lucky, whether this was all meant to be, whether it was his plan... Do you feel in control? Do we need to be in control?"

We talk of coconuts floating on rivers, that cannot change the water's course; of the inevitable change of seasons. The Shadowfell told us we can change the future, but this isn't the Shadowfell. Perhaps the Oracle wasn't so much seeing the future, as seeing all our possible choices - futures *not* written - and guessing at the most likely. So it's not predestination, so much as a calculated guess.

Eventually, we head to bed.

Riglan: Wisdom saving throw. Damn. Nat 1! Only 11.

Riglan has a dream. He remembers little of it...

* Walking along a heavily wooded coastline with steep hills rising from the sea. Beautiful trees everywhere. Survival 17; he recognises this place. Three large hills and a particular outcrop leaning out - this is Selgaunt, before the city was built.

* He sees a tiny settlement around the coast to the North, where it's less steep; more beaches. There are around 30 buildings, mostly shacks and huts. A few humans are visible as he approaches.

* This seems to be a momentous moment in history! The tribe, this small settlement, has had first contact with the Elves of Cormanthor. They bring stag loads of goods - gifts. Elven creations; elven food. It's almost a paternal relationship, the elves nurturing, as if watching over this fledgling settlement and young race.

* Walking further (unnaturally fast distance coverage - it's a dream). Other druids seem to be near him. He's encouraged to turn into an albatross; we all do, flying Northwards over the sea. In a natural deep harbour, hemmed in by a beautiful ring of high hills but with a clearly visible high mountain pass, wooded again, is a small settlement on the hillside that uses the harbour to fish. Little boats are visible.

* There, too, is a delegation of elves; they seem to be teaching the humans to make bows and spears; to make sails and handle rigging to help them fish.

* We fly further up the coast. Slightly inland. Huge forests, very large trees and what *once* must have been a thriving, advanced elven kingdom within, but now fading. Time has jumped. A bloody civil war. Stretches of the forest on fire. Factions of the elves fight, wielding powerful magic on both sides.

Riglan can't remember the rest.
