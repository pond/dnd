# Riglan: Part 3.12
## Night walking, day 30 to 31, ~3hrs ahead of home
### Entering the Anauroch across midnight, guided by Naroo and Manasi 

We walk across this strange, moonlit frozen sea. The breeze picks up. Our desert clothes are used to protect not just our lower limbs from the blown sand, but our upper body from the drying effects.

They show us a way to traverse sand dunes more efficiently, using less energy. It's all about picking the right place to climb; the downwind sides are steeper, so upwind sides can be easier, with a trade-off of visibility and exposure to the wind versus a difficult climb but sheltered and hidden. We can traverse ridges quickly, or hide ourselves while sacrificing some situational awareness by using the sand valleys.

After a few hours we're losing sense of where we are. Looking back, it's harder and harder to see where we came from. It's like being in a forest; you can't see very far there so can't see previous paths or future destinations; here it's more a question of long lines of sight but without useful references. Featureless, shifting.

We reach an area with little flat rock outcrops in places. We come around to a downwind side of one and, there, is almost a little grotto under the shelf of rock. There's some moisture - a handful of plants. "We have to stop for a moment, give the mule a chance to rest. Not much further now - maybe an hour." They offer to up on the rock and show us some things. Up there, we draw our shawls in close; the wind whips past. They point back West, where came from; ask if we can make out snowcapped peaks. Riglan flat perception 26 - yep, from here, it's clear enough. Then they point East. "The desert - further and further in." Then, another direction; roughly South; "Down there, you head towards the edge of the desert on the Western border of Cormyr. Unsettled lands."

They ask where we're headed and we do the best to explain and, back in the shelter of the outcrop, show them what maps we have. "Not our lands", they say, "but you're headed deep into the interior. The landscape is quite different; a lot more rock in parts. Very different creatures..." and they share some of what they know but say the Elders know more at their encampment.

We have some water; they do too; the mule is rested. Travel resumes.

A slow climb starts, onto the side of a dune, just below a ridge. "We have to crest this dune - it should be on the other side of this... This is one of the more stable dunes around. It moves, but won't collapse in a short time." Indeed, there's a change in the sand here; almost more soil-like. It starts to dip down but some rock seems to be anchoring it. Perception 17+10->27, this isn't a natural formation; there are angles to it that suggest weathered construction. A wall. Riglan asks - "Is the wall here built deliberately to anchor the dune?" "No, we don't believe so - we believe it was here to protect what's within, which we use. This has been here for as long as we know, the stories of this place go back a very long time."

They say that this place is called **Elgraib**. We start to descend on what look like very weathered stairs. A wall, an arched doorway; and as we appear around it, an oasis. "Ah," says Riglan, "So this is the 'within'!". It looks as if there used to be more lush gardens here, much now taken by the desert, but an overflowing fountain - probably once quite decorative - is tapped into a natural spring. Remnants of a garden wall surround the area. There are lots of lean-tos and low tents, and four people are immediately visible - they greet the guides who greet them in turn and we are introduced. "They have come to share the water but they have their own path". We are asked to keep quiet as "the children are asleep".

They have a heard of goats here, which nibble away at what little grass grows. We share some of our fresh food in return. They explain quietly that they think this overall area used to be some kind of library; a place of knowledge; and these were its gardens.

We are welcome to refill, sleep, or move on. We check in about the tent pitching and get a few more tips, e.g. preferential leeward side to the dune but if the shady sides are only wind-facing then that's still the preference. Shade first. We quietly speak to the elders about our destination and map - warnings about creatures and so-on (Temo persuasion 29).

A drink is shared; some kind of sour (but pleasant) milky drink. A kafir of some kind perhaps - doubtless, from the goats. They describe the **Mountains Of Death**. A better translation, they say, might be "Mountains Of The Dead" - full of tombs. "But we don't call it that because much of what's there is not dead!" Riglan offers, "Mountains Of The Undead?!" "Perhaps, but not just that. There are many undead around in parts of the desert generally. Ruins often have undead... Anyway... The place that you speak of is well known. Legends of it spread far and wide throughout the Wanders. To visit, you really must seek permission from the Wander Of The Mountains Of Death."

Temo says, "It's very important to us that anywhere we go, we don't trespass and don't anger the local communities we hope to be ultimately protecting. How might we find this Wander?"

"At this time of year they may be travelling less than usual, because their goats will have kids. They are more likely to hang around oases more than usual. There is another oasis about two days from here" (in *their* territory, not the other Wander we seek). It heads in the right direction.

(We figure we could head on foot there before we start cloud flying. Familiarity is important in this environment; in part, we need to be able to understand what we're seeing once airborne and unable to communicate with each other.)

They tell us about food in the desert but warn us not to take more than the bare minimum we need.

* Many poisonous snakes and lizards.
* A giant desert hawk - these are more of an issue closer to the mountains.
* Small roving packs of desert wolves.
* Beware the jackals. Wolves less of an issue usually but jackals hunt specifically in larger packs. There are stories of people who lost their way and "become one with the jackals" - shape-shifters? They aren't sure.
* Related to that, tthere is talk of a curse of demons of the desert. Cruel and powerful, deliberately malicious demons - not mischevious.
* A rare occurrence - we might encounter **lamassou**, a kind of mystic race of lion/sage! They're very clever. They're said to be related to sphinxes but less old and less, well, wise.

They'd love to tell us where the ruins might be but cannot make head nor tail of our map. It's not how they think about navigation.

### 1am

Once things are wrapped up, we give thanks and head out on our own. Soon the oasis is far behind us and Riglan uses the star map to maintain a bearing on where this second oasis should be; adv survival, 14+10. Confidence is high.

### 5am

"We're lost aren't we? We're definitely lost!" states Maireagh. And Riglan says, "Well, since we don't actually know exactly where the oasis is - so we don't technically know where we're going - we can't be lost..." "I have no idea where I am. I can't even tell you where we are or where we've come from."

Riglan spends some time with Maireagh showing her the star map and trying to convey how it works. She doesn't understand it fully but can clearly see some of the associations between ground and sky. Riglan says, "It is disorientating; there's no reference other than the sky. And I just have to work on faith, and work on timing to figure it out. In some respects, it's not too different from an unfamiliar forest."

We figure we should pitch camp - Riglan, flat survival 17+10 (good rolls today) to find a place to camp. He spots a rocky outcrop ahead. Maireagh confirms it is natural - hopefully no risk of undead in ruins! There's an overhang we can tuck under, but we can also set the tent up supported off to one side by its horizontal beam with rock stopping the shifting sands from burying the tent further. It'll be easier to pack up, we figure.

So - we set up the tent.

It's strange camping somewhere with no water. Riglan can't forage either. Maireagh can create food and water with a device she's created and, while we have ample provisions, while we can use magic to spare them, we should. Some kind of table needs to be laid out somehow; we work it out with various pots and plates.

Temo wonders if his magical hut would get hot; Maireagh thinks not. So that's a rather more simple plan B, but again, relies on magic and an understanding of the environment here seems important.

Riglan's curious about this land. Commune With Nature. 3mi radius.

* Nearby water? Way down below his feet, very deep. Pockets of it. No surface sources.
* There are little clusters of vegetation, very sparse here and there. Some things feel dormant but alive, hidden. There are all kinds of little animals! Many insects and snakes, some small rodents and a (normal sized) hawk nearby. 
* Celestials, fey, fiends, undead etc. - just for safety! - nothing at all, within range anyway. For now, this seems a safe place.

The horizon starts to brighten towards the east. We're facing North-East, so can see if it we look out from the tent. It'll get warm, but only for the first part of the day - the important part is the 2nd half of the day, we're told.

Maireagh sets up a perimeter Alarm.

Now the even weirder part - sleeping in daytime! Wisdom saves:

* Riglan 17+10->27 - sleeps easily
* Nethza also sleeps very well
* Maireagh 14, so Maireagh makes a tea that helps them sleep (+5 -> 19)
* Temo 9+1->10 - fitful sleep +5 -> 15 (see above)

The dog is on watch; nobody else this time.



## Day 31, 2pm

The tent is very warm. A bit sweaty and sticky. This is probably the warmest part of the day! The sun is not on us, at least; it's over the midpoint and the tent is in shade. Hopefully things will cool down soon.

We chat about the usual - options, risks, mitigations, next steps. Maireagh asks if we can open the tent up more; Riglan pokes his head outside, then pulls it quickly back in and zips the tent - "No, it's an oven outside! That's crazy! It's much cooler in here."

Maireagh wants proper food. We have the exotic fruit from Waterdeep in the chest, so we have a little bit. Riglan spies some fresh food from around Chateau Farley. We figure that could be good for old time's sake - but when we take it out, **it turns to dust**! That's... Some kind of an answer? About time and domains? Who knows. Anyway, we've less food than we thought. At least some of the Sungift food is still good.

Riglan tries reading Courts And Their Queens, but no luck. Temo makes a bit of progress with Statecraft. Nethza tries to reach the Raven Queen but can't really get a feel for it. Maireagh tinkers away with her equipment as usual.

At about 4:30-5pm we set up the water condenser to see if it works. After a while, drips do form. Riglan can tolerate the temperature in the shade now, but even later in the day, stepping into the sun is immediately and dramatically hotter. He sees a number of insects gathering in the area around, a little hoppy mouse sits in the shade. "Hello" says Riglan, "You are welcome to drink water." "Thank you!" Riglan gets a bit in his hand as the mouse can't reach over the container edge. The mouse jumps *three feet* into the air to land in his hand before he even gets his hand to the ground! "That's quite a jump!" says Riglan. "I need it to get away from snakes. What are you doing here?" "We rest, before travelling on at night. We're headed for distant mountains." "Mountains? Oh. Wow!" "Yes, very big. Not too safe - many snakes!" "What what is a mountain?" "It is like this rock here, only much, much bigger." "That sounds amazing! This rock is the best thing in my whole life. There are places to hide, and to keep out of the sun, and sometimes there is water." "It is a good rock!" agrees Riglan and lowers the mouse to the ground.

### 7pm

By the time the sun is starting to dip below the horizon, the condenser has only made about a cup of water. Riglan surmises that really it's only useful overnight and probably only for one person, since one water skin, overnight, would serve one person for the day (well, maybe two if it filled a large one).

We pack up, and by about 7:30pm, just like yesterday, we start to walk, star map in hand. Survival adv. 13,16+10->26. The mouse hops along behind for a while, but then Riglan sees up ahead in the sky an owl. He warns the mouse of the danger. "I know, I know!" says the mouse as it scurries back to the rock. "Farewell, mouse!" "Bye!"

Walking on through the night, we encounter some of the tufts of grass Riglan detected the other night. There are other shrivelled-up bushes with really fat trunks that Riglan figures were the 'dormant'-feeling things. Not dead, just waiting. Here and there are what look like cacti but slightly different - tiny hard leaves instead of spikes. It seems likely that this area occasionally gets rain.

We press on through the night.

### 11pm

Time for a break. We stop, drink water; we're on the leeward side of a dune. Wind is similar to last night. Looking around, it's unnerving; absolutely no visible references remain at any useful distance. There are only the stars. Maireagh hands out some fruit she had stashed away.

## Midnight day 31 -> 32

Onward. After a few hours, a more difficult area... A huge dune, backed up almost like a mountain range ahead. It must climb at least 200ft. No ways around; it must be surmounted. Athl:

* Temo 15,18+0 -> 18
* Maireagh does OK
* Nethza has trouble so just flies!
* Riglan 1+8->9 -> struggles, but Nethza helps while flying -> 12+8->20

"Being heavier is a disadvantage!" complains Riglan as Maireagh and Temo scurry up the dune.

From the crest, the sight is bewildering. The moon lights up the landscape below. Some is partly shadowed by the huge dune but most of it is visible. There are small remnants of what looks like a town; stonework, poking up around sand. In the middle there is a beautiful, but partly-submerged structure with plants growing all around. Riglan is confused - "This would look like an oasis; but they said two days..." - Maireagh suggests we've done a day and a half and Riglan's navigation was on point (high survival roles). The tribespeople have children too. So there's a good chance we've just found it, but Riglan's still a little cautious; lots of ruins - undead?

It's worth another Commune.

* There is indeed accessible water under the big central structure.
* One undead nearby - it seems to be within the town somewhere.
* Focusing on that; not particularly powerful.

That seems fair enough; Riglan warns about the one undead detected and we head down. Going down is much easier than up!

### Approaching 4am

We quickly reach more compact, firm sand. Almost earth. There are a couple of small bristly palms here too - the water must be quite stable if trees can grow. Big clumps of grass and even a section that looks like the buildings have weeds growing on it.

The sand dips towards the structure at the middle. Emanating out from it are largely-buried troughs with a lot of grass growing out. Riglan insight 22, guessing irritation; he senses that this area once had a very complex waterway system. A farm complex. Its construction suggests that this was done well before there was a desert; it's old. He asks Maireagh what she can glean from stonework. Adv history 11,11+10->21. It's very old; cracked in places, so water doesn't flow properly; but anyway, not Dwarven. Human probably, but again, very old - more than a few centuries. Maybe even more than a thousand years, but the heavy sand-smoothed weathering on the stone makes it hard to be sure. Riglan notices she's got her hammer ready and Nethza has her shadow blade. Riglan figures "when in Rome" and activates his staff; at this, Temo draws his bow, too.

We advance towards the central structure. The whole place looks completely uninhabited, though there are signs - fairly old now - of occasional visitation here and there. Riglan does wonder about the undead. "If there are undead here, it seems unlikely that the tribespeople would risk using this as a watering hole, especially with children. I don't understand why there would be just one here. We should seek it out" opines Riglan.

It looks like the central area used to be a covered town square with water mill and pumping station. No! Not a square. A main town building, perhaps, the top now mainly collapsed and us standing on the ground floor. But we realise there's a space beneath us too, and we head down. The water is visible there, just flowing out into troughs. No working pumps.

Riglan casts Darkvision and Temo puts on his goggles. We have to investigate to try and see if we find signs of the undead.

Temo, investigation 17+14 -> 31. He hears a scuffling sound, in one of the rooms to the side. He whispers a warning to the others and goes to the door; listens; scratching and scuffling noises again. Riglan readies himself and Temo pushes the door open as quickly as he can, intending to cast Hold Person.

Looking in, Riglan sees that the back part of the room has collapsed. Sand has spilled in. Once, perhaps, a workshop? Lots of stone benches. One has collapsed on top of what appears to be desiccated or mummified kind of undead. It can't move. The room has a perimeter that's set around it - some kind of barricade has been set up by the benches, that makes it difficult for people to walk past and into the back where this area is.

Riglan shrugs and shouts, "Who are you?" at the undead.

It seems dazed and disorientated; but at the same time, it seems caught as if in a loop as it scratches at the ground in front of itself. It responds to Riglan's noise by stopping and looking at Riglan then just sort of hisses at him. It tries to speak, but it isn't a language he recognises. Temo puts on the helm and says "Say that again?!"

"Who is there?"

"I am Temo"

"Who is there?"

"I am still Temo. Who are you?"

Rasping noises. "Who is there?"

Meanwhile, Riglan perception 11+10->21. The wall and bench must've been collapsed for more than 100 years. "I can't remember how this works. If we dispatch an undead, does it free the soul?" "Dunno!" Riglan sighs. "Well, it seems wrong to leave it trapped. And we can't let an undead roam. And it can't understand us. So the only option I see is to take down... Lesser cruelty, perhaps."

Riglan can't think of a painless way to do this. He throws flame. 25 to hit; 15 damage. The flame burns away remnant clothing. Nethza follows with an Eldritch blast volley. It sighs, or gasps; and it turns into dust. The dust swirls around then settles.

Temo says, "It feels like we've missed something here, but... I don't know what. So I guess no choice there. Maireagh says, "I think we should leave a note, to explain what has happened. This could be very concerning for whoever uses this place normally - if they trapped and barricaded this creature, but now it's gone, they might panic."

Good idea. Maireagh is able to etch stuff into a piece of flat stone, which is more durable than parchment. It'll take about an hour.

### Around 5am

It'll be time to camp soon but we have some time to look around and rest. We want to investigate the history more first; Temo keeps on the helm. Adv investigation, 6,19+14->33. Woah.

Carved writing that survives down here is in Netherese. This was indeed an agricultural centre. There was a mill, farms, a trading area; a small outpost. There is a clear suggestion that the land used to be quite fertile. The land was an administrative room. Perhaps the undead was an administrator, sadly crushed whenever whatever cataclysm happened here took place - there's a lot of damage we find all around. It's not just wear and tear; it looks like a major seismic upheaval. Temo history 13, it's enough to remember reading theories that there was a major collapse of Netherese society because of some event that wasn't directly witnessed - suspected magical cause of whatever this upheaval was. The probable-clerk had been trapped here a long time, then, but unclear why this unfortunate soul became undead. Others must've escaped somehow.

He can now read makeshift markings around the room in Bedine, "Do not enter". Suggests that they knew. Hopefully whoever comes by can read our new inscription in Common!

"We should learn to speak Netherese" observes Temo.

We may as well camp down here. It's shaded, there's water and Maireagh has plenty of cooking space. Riglan is happy enough too, since there are plants down here and the air feels more humid and familiar.

We sleep.

### 2pm

We discuss options. Wind Walk for daylight hours looks like a good way to try and spot other oasis and cover more ground; we can come down at night and either keep walking or camp, now we've more familiarity with how everything looks and Riglan's more familiar with the star map but he can't use that while in cloud flight, or during the day. We have a starting bearing and decide to opt for that.

We pack up and it's decided; we go up to the top level in the blistering sun and Riglan hastily casts Wind Walk, telling the others to follow his cloud. It's an eye-opener for everyone just how incredibly hot it is up there. It's not in shade and the heat of the day, and even in just a minute of casting, it is unbearably hot. Walking would be all but impossible - utter folly.

Ground, of course, is covered at ten times the rate in Wind Walk, but all Riglan can do is keep a straight course based on the bearing he took and keep his cloudy-eyes peeled. We agree that Riglan will be in front and everyone follows, but he'll keep just below top speed and if anyone else sees anything they think is sufficiently important, they should move in front and then he will follow *them*. We must outrun danger, since it takes a full minute to regain our normal form if the spell ends, during which we're very vulnerable.

Survival flat 17+10->27 - initial bearing is good. D20->15; perception another high roll, 15+10->25. We fly for the entire day, until almost 10pm, the spell on the very edge of wearing out. Then, up head, glinting in the now-moonlight - glancing at stars, doing his best to remember the map - something that looks like it could be a significant oasis. The spell will fail before we get there. He looks to the ground for either a rock plateau - none - but there's a valley - descends, gets to the ground level, waits until the others have matched and starts to turn back. Everyone follows suit.

### 10pm

A minute later, we are back to normal. A strange experience - a very long flight over a very strange landscape. Riglan says it was OK for him because he just kept focusing on his mental map and member of the stars, and it got easier after dark surprisingly though harder to see any potential oases. Nethza found it an interesting kind of out-of-body experience, though Maireagh found it a bit uncomfortable until the second half, due to the heat. It doesn't affect us directly in that form but she still felt it. Riglan agrees and says "yes, and the risk is, if we were forced to come down for any reason, we have to stand possibly in full sun for a full minute before we can even think about putting up a shelter - and doing it in daylight."

We have some big drinks of water. It's strange - not thirsty in flight, but certainly very thirsty after. Riglan describes what he hopes is a big oasis about - he thinks - an hour, maybe less, away. It looked like more than a mile.

Gear all checked, water drunk, we make a move; Riglan adv survival (1,18)+10->28. Instinctively, he might have headed in entirely the wrong direction based just on a sense of what's where, but looking at the stars, he's immediately corrected.

Upon final approach, Riglan makes the call - all weapons stowed; as visible as we can make ourselves. No hiding, no subversion, no stealth; intentionally be seen as early as can be, to avoid surprise. Nonetheless, we stumble across a small human child, maybe 12y/o, who looks at us with deer-caught-in-headlights eyes. Temo uses hand actions learned from the Bedine to try and convey our intent - persuasion 16+15->31; the kid beckons that we should walk and follow him. So, we do. He first picks up another child just around behind a small dune, who is tending to a goat; they walk ahead and call, apparently not warnings but alerts of visitors.

Adults run out towards us. We can see a camp; definitely an oasis. This isn't part of a settlement - seems entirely natural, in a deep bowl in the land, yet free of sand somehow. It's quite lush. More and more people start appearing out of tents. Some are very large. It seems we're making quite a stir!

The adults get close. One looks us over. We see they have what appear to be specific tattoos around their necks in intricate patterns and on forearms. Temo asks in Common, "Greetings; we are travellers from the West. Do you speak Common?"

They look at each other. An older man, 50s perhaps but in good shape, steps forward. "Yes. Some of us do." Temo says "thank you" - and holds the helm out to show it - "this object lets me understand your own language, but does not let me speak it." "Ah. I see. An artefact. My name is **Karoun**." He beckons to a woman who steps forward. "And this is our tribe..." (the word spoken haltingly, as if struggling to translate) "...leader, **Sutesh**. She says something that sounds customary; "If you bring no evil and seek no evil, you can share our fire and our water."

Temo says, "Thank you. We bring no evil. But we do seek it - not with you, but a threat far further East, which is the reason for our being here." "You wish no evil on us?" "Oh no! None on you." "You are welcome!" The others walk forward, smiling. We are shepherded back to the camp.

As we head there, Temo asks, "Are you the Wander Of The Mountains Of Death?" "Yes, we belong to that Wander". Temo says, "Ah, we were seeking you. We were hoping to get permission to travel upon your lands and get closer to a place we need to find, south of the mountains."

Now she regards us suspiciously. "You are treasure hunters."

"No" says Temo - persuasion 19+15->34! "We try to stop someone who is, but to find them, we need the help of a seer, who apparently lives in a ruined town in that direction. This is all we know."

By now we're at the camp proper. Some adults return to their normal activities, while Karoun and Sutesh stay with us and some other elders are called over; they talk to each other in Bedine, then speak to us about what we are looking for. We aren't sure how much to tell. Temo sets up some questions to try and get some insight into their intent and asks about Azalin Rex; do they know the name? Riglan insight 15+10->25. They know the word "Azalin" (or at least recognise its twisted origins) but don't know of this particular one. There have been Azalin (wizard kings) before, but none live near here. There were some who ruled the kingdoms that this land once was.

Insight suggests no malicious intent or conflicts. So, with their permission to tell our story, we give the short version - Azalin bad, moving West, looking for artefacts, brings death; we want to stop him, but need the help of the seer, and so-on.

* She will send warnings to those who live in the areas where he might go nearby.
* We are given permission to enter their lands. She puts a bone in the fire. Once it is hot, she etches it with a mark. It cools and she hands it to Temo. "This is a mark saying that you have the backing of Sutesh."

"The place you seek I have seen in my youth" she adds, to our surprise. "We do not rest there. It is a place that is forbidden to us, for undead live within. **It is in a valley, south of the mountains; itself, hidden in a veil within the hills.** To get to it, you must pass through the undead, but when I was a child, we knew of a people - living people - who live there. They knew safe paths. We do not know who they are descended from, for they are not our people. They are another. Why they tolerate the undead, who live beyond their borders in the passes of the mountains, we do not know either! There is someone who you can speak to though, who knows that area. He is not one of ours either. He is a **dragon speaker**." - and she tells us how to find this person. He lives in a cave in the hills, having constructed himself a home there. The undead seem to leave him alone. Sutesh does not know if he is good or evil! "But I do know that there are tales of pilgrimages that go to the city that you seek in the veil. The pilgrims must find a way through."

So there are three leads of sorts:

* How do the pilgrims do it?
* Or speak to man in cave?
* Or speak to the people who lives there and "tolerates" the undead? Not Bedine.

It is "several days travel" towards the Southern mountain edges. That sounds like another daytime cloud flight option. Perhaps, though, we leave later, so we land later, after the worst of the heat of the day. If we left around 8am, we'd land around 4pm, assuming a full day of travel.

### 11pm

Temo and Maireagh work together to help him transcribe Alarm into his spellbook. Takes a couple of hours and a good 50gp in ink, but it's useful and frees Maireagh up for something else.

## Day 33 - 1am

We're tired enough to pitch camp and sleep, on assumption of a daytime flight. Maireagh thinks it might not be too pleasant but should be doable to fly in entirely daylight hours. Riglan spends some time getting bearings and making notes from the stars, while others set camp and Temo sets up an Alarm.

It seems that people here are most active at dawn and dusk, sleeping a little in between. As we get settled in to sleep, we're not entirely out of sync with those around us as a result.

### 4am

Temo is suddenly woken up by the alarm. He turns to shake Riglan awake - but as he gets up, disadv perception, 15; he notices someone has snuck into our big tent and crossed the alarm boundary. This person is clearly sneaking! They are coming for us; they're on the inside of the tent so Temo can't make out anything else. Temo casts Hold Person. DC 16 wisdom save; the person stops moving. Temo wakes up Maireagh and says "we need light!" then wakes everyone else.

Now we clearly see the person held. Their eyes look crazed and they hold a dagger. Temo says to Maireagh, "Have a look at that - see if it's Netherese!" it isn't, but this person seems out of their mind. "Riglan, tie him, quick! I've only got a few more seconds!" says Temo. Riglan wrestles the guy to the ground and ties him, but as he's doing that asks Nethza and Maireagh to get help from the camp. He's taking a punt that they didn't do this!

Elders come in. They want an explanation. At first they think we've held him at knife point, but quickly realise that he shouldn't be here, and that it's his knife. They try talking to him; he seems incoherent; Riglan considers Greater Restoration; insight 16+10->26. His eyes seem confused. Eyes dart between Nethza and Temo. Riglan says to his group, "Look - he's focused on Nethza and Temo. This *has* to be an Azalin Rex thing". He casts Greater Restoration, hoping to release a charm. The person seems to react - they start gasping and look shocked. Then a strange pulse of force emanates out, visibly, blowing the sand around! They seem to come to, unaware of what's going on! He's very confused, doesn't know why he's tied or anything. The elders all start talking at once.

Temo tries to talk him down. "Friend, be calm; we think a magical curse afflicts you. You have been freed. What is the last thing you remember?" Persuasion 19+15->34.

He remembers going to bed. And a few days ago he found a strange object, an amulet - hasn't slept well since - he sees it on the ground and Riglan realises it flew off him when the spell was cast. It's clearly Netherse; the elders are very angry at that; Temo arcana 16+4->20. Magical... It seems to have the ability to connect different people who wear it. He thinks it must come in a set. Communication. And cursed.

Temo tells us. "Azalin Rex, or an associate, must hold the other and somehow got this one found - to get to us - same problem as Silverymoon, how did he know where we were?"

The guy says, "But I found this days ago! At our last stop. Nearly a week ago, near ruins we walk through where we stopped for a break."

The elders argue that this is their one rule! Never take such a thing. "But it was so beautiful! And it called to me! It's mine. It was meant to be mine..." Then he realises what he's saying, the curse broken. Temo says, "Yes, this is cursed; possessed; he had no choice." The guy had nightmares. "Every night I have dreamt - oh!" - and points to Nethza and Temo - "of the two of them! But I don't know the context of the dream."

Riglan says, "So this is worse than we thought. Either Rex just distributes these things far and wide on any path he thinks we might take, or he's very, very good at precognition. For we weren't set on the path to this oasis a week ago. We didn't know any of this even exists. We hadn't even got to Evereska."

The elders believe these things are created in sets. Dozens, created all together. Azalin perhaps has found one, and being powerful, can "infect" all others in the network. It seems the curse just sort of drives the unfortunate holder insane via the visions in their sleep.

Riglan asks the elders, "Of what little you know of these - are they two-way? Did the other holder see what this person saw?"

**"If he shared it, yes." They turn to the guy. "Have you shared it? Did you tell anyone through that?" "No! I didn't even know how it works. It only ever spoke to me. I forgot I had it!"**

It seems true, even though scant comfort. We have to hope that Azalin Rex didn't see this, but either way, have no choice but to proceed.

Sutesh says she must pass judgement on this person. Temo does beg her for lenience; the object being cursed meant that he might have had little choice. He recognises the importance of their law, but hopes she'll bear it in mind (Persuasion 18+15->>33).

The punishment is that he cannot be trusted now. He is forbidden independence for the next 13 lunar cycles; a year. Someone must supervise this poor fellow at all times. Any job done by a single person is no longer available to him. The whole tribe has to agree to take on such work and otherwise keep watch on the individual, who seems incredibly ashamed and remorseful. He gives up his dagger.

Riglan says to Sutesh, "This is the evil we try to stop. You see now how powerful and pervasive it can be. We will travel at first light."

"You are not as safe as my initial extension of hospitality to you would suggest!"

Riglan chuckles and says, "So far, it's only us that have been put at risk by this. My worry is that our presence brings danger to others. I'm just glad that we found this out and could free the man of his curse.

Sutesh nods, "Yes, but I must send further messages..." - and calls over a companion who has received an owl overnight with messages already. She sends the owl back out with a stronger warning.

"Will you take this away from us? And hide it far away?" she says, of the amulet. "Yes," says Temo "and if we survive the encounter ahead, we have the means to destroy it fully." Maireagh offers a box; Temo uses Mage Hand; it is lowered in and the box is sealed shut. It cannot be opened again; it would need destroying to remove the amulet.

They offer to set watches around the camp, so we can finish our sleep, though some herders are now raising for their dawn work.

We move back to the tent to continue our rest.

Nethza asks us, "How is this happening to us? How are we in the middle of the desert, and he is still able to reach us? There aren't be more than ten people in a 50 mile radius. This is insane!"

Riglan nods and says "yes, the idea that he just *hoped* someone might pick up one of those amulets some day - seems far-fetched. And someone definitely *knew* we'd be in Silverymoon. And knew quickly, which leans perhaps into a degree of precognition - but I hope not."

"How is he communicating with people?"

Riglan shrugs. "Artefacts, animals, magical spells, cross-planar boundaries! He's done the latter before, we know that, even though it was meant to be impossible. I think it's safe to assume that now matter what we do, he knows we're coming. It's not going to be a surprise. But he's also still only looking for you two - so far! - and that means still no omniscience, and no messages reached him up to a week ago, about there being more of us. So we still have *that*. He's not infallible. And he's failed to stop us, a few times now. So we're making progress and we're making progress in a way that bothers him."

Maireagh has made some of the sleep tea. "We need something to calm the nerves!"

Riglan reluctantly adds, "Well, there is one thing. Nethza, as a threat, maybe a soul fragment; the assassin - why not just let Nethza die naturally, or something? - we figured that Netherese blade was part of it. But this guy here, just had a normal knife. Not Netherese at all. So, now we're down to - what's special about Nethza where simply letting her die of old age isn't enough? What are we missing here? Is it just anger, evil vindictiveness without a reason? Or is there perhaps a time factor at play, of which we are unaware; that Rex himself might not be able to wait too long?"

"Maybe the longer he waits, the more likely the Dark Powers will find a way to trap him."

"Perhaps. That might not actually be true, but if he fears it, then that itself is potentially another weakness."

So, we try to sleep again. The tea helps.

### 9am

A little later than planned, we pack up, give our thanks and without further ado - bearings taken last night very carefully by Riglan - head away. The trees and tents of the large oasis give plenty of immobile reference points that help.

Some watch with wonder and amazement as we turn into mist and fly away.

The bearing is taken; the destination is south of the mountains. Riglan flat Survival 11+10->21. By around midday or so, Riglan notices the heat that Maireagh pointed out; he realises that it's actually more from heat reflected off the sand, so he increases altitude and the others follow. This allows him to spot the distant mountain range more clearly, which is encouraging and helps with navigation. We'll be able to get close before the spell fails, but we'll probably need some kind of camp, or at least, get an idea of walking time, as we could continue on after dark.

### 5pm

The spell is about to falter. We're within 10 miles of the mountains. Maybe less. We'd be exhausted if we tried to walk on today, even though we're headed to the night. There are low hills in front that at first he'd thought were dunes, 8-9 miles out. Those are our target. They are barren and rocky, sandstone; Riglan is concerned given that geology that finding "the" cave with this guy in would be hard as there are probably lots of caves in that set of hills, from the wind. At least we were given some directions and navigation hints.

He starts looking for a landing site. Some rock outcrops look like they might be submerged hills, or extensions of the foot of the mountains; flowstone, almost, in a few places. That looks good. He heads down. Nothing much in cover; we'd rely on the tent. It's getting cooler soon anyway and we're camping overnight.

After the usual - actually a bit strange and boring - 1 minute to get back to normal, we pitch tent. "Tea?" asks Riglan. "Sure!" says Maireagh and makes one. Riglan sets up the water condenser for overnight with a big waterskin.

He says, "given the warnings about undead, I'm just going to check the local area" and casts Commune With Nature.

* Quite a few more animals, especially towards the hills; jackals around, half a dozen; lots of snakes, scorpions, beetles, lizards. A few more plants but different kinds, scrub mostly.
* Traces of a fiend! There's the *influence* of something from another plane. A lower plane. There was the mention of the malicious demons with those jackals - might be that.
* No undead.

He warns the party that we'll need to take watches tonight, just in case the jackals attack.

### 6pm

The dog helps keep watch. Unusually, Riglan goes first, since it's still just about light enough. So we reverse order. Riglan adv. perception 22. Temo is next; with goggles & dog's help, adv perception total is 21. Nethza - not great, but nothing seems to happen. Maireagh goes last and does OK.

## Day 34 - 2am

It's a strange time to get up, but might not be too bad for a walk over to the hills. It'd be approaching daybreak on arrival. Simpler than Wind Walk and easier if we try to land anywhere potentially hostile. We pack up and head out within around half an hour. The water collector has done very well, filling the water skin - in fact it overflowed! Quite close to the mountains - perhaps that helps.

At this time of night, thin wisps of cloud are visible around the mountains in the moonlight. This time, to aid navigation Riglan casts Darkvision. He finds he quite likes this strange night walking in the moon. It has a sort of almost hypnotic rhythm to it, that he finds surprisingly calming. And navigating by the stars seems to tap into some quite primal instincts which feels right, too.

Trying to find a specific location is harder than pure sky navigation for direction, and Riglan - survival 7+10->17 - does OK but it's certainly not as slick as his earlier attempts. He's not too sure where we should be headed but figures surely there must be some kind of a pass to get through and aims for the lowest area.

### 5am

After around 3 hours, we reach the edge of strange, dry scrub. A few dead-looking trees with swollen trunks catch his eye; they are not dead, he realises, just dormant. The trunks are probably filled with stored water.

The sand gives way to rocks. Small scrubby trees that seem embedded into the rock itself sprout occasionally, anywhere that there's at least a bit of dirt. There's not a path per se, but more of a natural route that guides the eye. It looks like it might've had water flowing once. A dry stream bed - layers of schist on the ground, areas of small pebbles in what might have been insides of bends where the water moved more slowly.

We reach a low ridge. The train beyond heads up to the low mountains. We are indeed in a low pass heading to the hills but it's not something that heads directly up. It's more just low-lying land between two hills, curving around. We could find a way to the mountain but have no idea what we want there. We look for signs of people. Riglan survival 10+10->20, Temo investigation 15+14->29.

There are certainly signs of animals. droppings, one or two hoof marks in softer dirt. Temo even thinks he spots scorch marks on a flat bit of rock tucked away, as if from a fire. It's a plateau of sorts between hills. What look like tracks lead in many directions - it's actually quite difficult to navigate! Any direction is possible. Riglan takes a risk and says "I think I'll have to try an owl, see if I can get a better idea looking down at it."

Riglan wildshapes and flutters up. It's still a struggle (adv perception 7,8+5->13) to make things out, so he flies in a wide radius around the rest of the party, who take a short rest while keeping on guard. He does manage to spot a small group of four - dogs? Jackals! Not sure. They're sheltering near the mouth of a cave. One looks up, sees the owl and sniffs the air. Riglan flies in a little closer for a better look. Another dog emerges, both looking up. Now a third. They watch. It's not clear what they're thinking. **They're definitely jackals.** Riglan flies away, but not back towards the party; he takes  a wide berth until hopefully out of sight (flying lower) and eventually curves back around. This course brings him closer to the mountains. Perception 2,3+5. (Fucks sake - previous session was nothing but high rolls; this session is the payback).

No village at all. Danger with the jackals. Nothing significant near the mountain. Riglan flies back and lands, turns back into himself.

### Approaching 6am

He's a bit disgruntled, feeling like he let the party down a bit. He warns about the jackals not too far away; maybe half a mile. They might be awake now and looking for trouble. He has no idea which direction to go for the village, except to say it's not likely to back the way we came. The stone doesn't leave many footprints to give an indication of where, if at all near here, people might have more commonly walked; all we know is that there was at least a person around not all that long ago, but we don't know where they came from or went.

Maireagh has a moment of inspiration. "Did you not say that there were jackals nearby?" "Yeah - about half a mile that way!" Riglan points. "Do they look like they live here?" Riglan says, "Well, I think so - they had a cave." "Might they know?" "You want me to *talk* to the jackals?" "Unless you see anyone else who seems to know this area!"

It's an intriguing proposition. While the prospect of fiends and battle aren't exciting, the idea of talking to these creatures certainly is. "Arm yourselves, then, just in case!" says Riglan and leads the way towards the cave he saw. He realises that one of the natural looking "paths" heads along the hillside in the right direction. Perhaps the jackals use this themselves. It doesn't take too long - 10, 15 minutes maybe - before encountering a growl. Riglan casts Speak With Animals and says "We approach as friends, and bring food as an offering of good faith." He offers some of the dried meat.

The leader calls the others. Four. They pull food away. The lead says, "Thank you for food. You may enter our territory but we will watch you." Riglan says, "Thank you. Of course you must defend and guard your territory. We also have water. Perhaps you would like some, if you could tell us if you know of groups of people who sometimes pass through here, to and from a village that lies in one of the valleys beyond."

"We do not know of a village. But we do see groups of people passing. Some come back, some do not. They go towards Pass Of The Dead. You do not seek to go where they are going? Are you going where they are going? Why have you fallen off the road" Riglan answers, "We got lost. We do seek their path, but worry about the undead." "Then you do not have the mountain guide." "No, we lack a guide. Is he in the cave?" "Not our caves no! He is in *his* cave! His cave is near the road."

We get some bowls and Riglan pours out water for the jackals and gives them more food. They thank him. They regard him then one yips! It calls "child, child, come here. There is water." A young jackal comes out, who had been hiding. It has some water and food. Riglan at this point says, "I have sensed some kind of evil, some fiend, that touches these lands; some of the people talk of jackals that work for demons. I think they might be confused, but definitely keep your noses to the wind, and if you smell evil, run to protect your young." "But the guide leaves us alone!" Riglan, penny drop. "The guide takes on a shape that looks... Doesn't look like any of you. Like a taller... Of you!" points to Temo with its nose. Riglan says, "Ah! So the thing I sensed is in fact the guide. I am relieved that your young is safe." "When the guide does not take the shape, he has a dog head." We've heard of this - the rumour, Rakshasha - but perhaps conflated with shape-changing jackals, were-jackals and more.

Riglan asks, "Is it safe for one of you, and would you be willing, to show us the way to this cave?"

A beta male steps forward. "I will take you to the road. The guide's cave is by the road, for all pilgrims go past him." Riglan thanks the others and wishes them well with the new family and we head off quickly. The sun is already on the horizon.

The beta jackal takes us towards the road of which they spoke. It's away from the way we came, carrying on along the hillside. We were certainly not in the right place! Far too far West. The jackals perhaps took pity on us for our idiotic navigation... It takes an extra half hour that way, towards the East.

The sun crests over the horizon and, despite the worry of the heat, it's breathtaking. The mountains look as if set on fire. It's beautiful. The air immediately feels different - warming straight away. The chill is gone. We haven't got long but for now we're OK.

The jackal brings us to a well-worn path. It sniffs Riglan's hand, thanks him for food and says "Follow up this path. When you reach the stairs, the guide's cave is just half way along." Riglan thanks the male, gives him some more water since it'll be a warm journey back in the rising sun and he runs off.

We immediately start on the road, around 6:30am. As we look around, we realise in the light of day that this is very worn, wide stairs with deep steps. We're already at them. We keep eyes peeled for the cave as we travel. There are big rock formations around, one in particular in a symmetrical pair; strange; looking closer, he realises that there's a flatter surface on one that's not been worn down by sand and wind - they used to be massive pillars or statues, flanking what must have been a wide, grand set of stairs once. Much of what's around us is artificial, carved into the rock or built out of it, but barely recognisable.

Riglan takes a moment to look around behind, realising suddenly that he's not seen much of the open desert in daytime. We've largely been in oases or high noon heat and hiding.

The light and shadow across the dunes - wow. Endless desert. He calls out and the others turn to look too.

There's a glimpse of something, though, as he looks; wisdom 17; grasping the staff, his vision shifts somehow. He feels almost transported, just for the briefest of moments. He sees beautiful marble tiled stairs in front of him, statues around, water flowing down the mountain sides away from him, gardens, rows of trees; he can just make out below, beautiful manicured, sculpture gardens with low houses fanning out. A grand entrance for a great civilisation. He gasps, calls out to Maireagh as his vision returns to the real view; points out the things he saw in what's left, very excited by this strange vision gifted by the staff. What were once odd lumps of rock or outcrops are now seen as toppled statues, or remains of buildings, swallowed by desert. Some barely-visible geometric lines here and there, the sand piling against old ruins now deep below.

"I really start to understand more why they talk about the West being so young. To think that something on the scale I saw could've existed here hundreds, probably thousands of years ago - when the likes of Waterdeep was perhaps not even a village."

Nethza warns us to keep moving - to get out of the sun. "Yes. We need to find the cave."

Riglan can tell that there used to be pools, perhaps for fountains on some occasional plateaus, with what he thinks must have been old stone seats around. Some are somewhat intact still and in the dust or stones there's evidence of disturbed ground, as if pilgrims might use this to rest sometimes, even in modern times. A little higher up, in a shadow, Riglan then spots a cave, with a natural stone walkway leading down to this landing we've reached. He points up - says, "and this time, I suppose, weapons *away*, although that's risk..." "Yeah but don't we think this person is evil?" "We don't know. And perhaps true, yes, but I think if we intimidate from the get-go, we might not get anywhere anyway. I mean - if it comes to a fight, we'd have to win or die but then what? How would we get through the pass of the undead?"

We ascend. The "stairs" here are quite tall, really just stone ledges not true stairs; Temo's having to hoist himself up. At the top, someone calls out. "Oh! I didn't see you coming. Hold on, let me come into the light."

A figure appears. Very tall, muscular human male, 7ft perhaps. Looks in his 50s, dashing, almost swarthy. Big long mane of hair tied back. Their skin is a chocolate brown. Kind-looking eyes. Clothing "of the area", and the way it drapes belies the powerful physique underneath.

(Riglan is aware that this is all an illusion.)

He reaches out a hand to help Temo. "Let me help you" "Thank you!" and Temo is hauled up to the ledge.

"Good morning. My name is **Karnach**. What brings you on the pilgrim's road? You don't look like pilgrims to me."

Temo explains that we're looking for a seer. He knows of them. We also say we're surprised at his appearance as the jackals said he might look quite different - but this doesn't bother us. "Well then - let's do away with the pretence!" he says.

He changes. 9ft tall now, *very* muscular build, especially big chest, an almost wolf-like face more than jackal but with rounded ears. But for colouring, a long-snouted tiger shape almost. It's brown and black striped. Riglan grins, and says, "Well now, that's much better!"

He has unusual legs - well, feet. He stands on furry paws with very big claws, with clawed hands (not paws, but claws - quite scary). His legs are otherwise normal bipedal-looking albeit extremely muscular. He has a tail, too, but long and furry again like tiger's tail. This is, indeed, probably a fiend then!

Surprisingly, his round ears are full of piercings an the jewellery within is full of hooks.

He grins - revealing a row of very sharp teeth. Again, that's almost more tiger-like. Apart from the snout, it'd be easier to think in cat terms more than dog. It's all an odd combination, which is in keeping with his nature, it seems. "I'm surprised that you are as calm as you are." Riglan nods and says, "Clearly, in a fight, we'd be at quite some disadvantage! But we've no intention of causing violence and hope that we might be able to get your assistance."

"You wish to head up the pilgrim's road? Then you must know what lies ahead - what lies in between us and the seer.

Riglan realises with a shock that this village we're going for might be less about people who know where this strange cube building is, and more the place where it actually lies!

The fiend continues. "The village is your test, really; the villagers are the one who can permit you access to the cube. If you fail their test they turn you back."

"But between them and us, undead?"

"That's right. Restless spirits. But if you come with me they will not bother you. They know better than to tangle with me!"

Riglan says, "We would be very grateful. Is there a price?"

"Of course there is a price!" He looks to all of us. Wisdom saving all round:

* Maireagh OK
* Nethza OK
* Temo 18
* Riglan only 3+10 total but Maireagh reacts (she *pinches* Riglan's side to distract him!) -> 18.

We all hear a sweet voice in our heads, singing, as if trying to put all our defences to sleep while searching for something in our minds that brings us joy - as it searches for a price.

Temo thinks of his lute. Not the fancy one. The old one, his original busker's lute, that he's kept this whole time in Maireagh's bag. It was going to be on the wall of the house wherever he and Qelline settled. The fiend reacts, "Oh, very sweet indeed!"

Riglan thinks of the vast forest. Endless green, life, water... Before Maireagh had distracted him he was starting to think of the World Tree seed. So his mind slips away from that and he can't stop it landing on the knuckle trinket, a gift from half-orc and human monster hunter couple Gruushma and Markoth in our early days of adventuring, when we learned how to make use of parts of monsters we kill.

Nethza - a promise she made to someone who she met in the Shadowfell. She reveals it, to our surprise; she made a friend and said that she'd go back for her.

Maireagh, slightly teary-eyed pulls out a small trinket from the bag. It's a picture. The first one, with Danain. Riglan goes wide-eyed, "But you can't!" "But this is what he wants. A thing of value."

The fiend compares. Then he says, "I choose the memory. The promise." The thing most painful to take; it might come back and haunt it. She'd forget all about it. She would have to give that promise to him, somehow; it's as if the promise was never made... She won't remember to go back and save the person. The whole *party* would forget. Riglan thinks on insight - Nethza is so unsure the group will succeed that she maybe can't keep the promise either. Probably won't. Riglan says quietly, "Whoever it was might not exist in our timeframe, or might never exist in a future modified by our actions. For all I know, the domain already collapsed."

The Fiend says "You'll not remember this in your waking moments. But in the depths of dream it might surface..." and that is his price. He can harvest the pain from her with each pang of guilt. **Riglan closes his eyes, gripping the staff, and makes a quiet prayer to the shepherds. Perhaps one day, the might grant the dream more clearly to him and we could find a way to recover this price. But perhaps not.**

The fiend seems delighted with his price. "Shall we?" he says. Before we all forget, Riglan says to Maireagh, "Well, that answers your question."

He looks to Maireagh, sees she has a hammer. Doesn't seem interested. Sees Nethza carrying no weapons; Riglan insight 29 - doesn't even *look* at Riglan, seems unbothered - thinks it is an alignment thing, Maireagh is good, Nethza good but no weapons. Looks at Temo and notices a crossbow. He says, "Oh no, that will not do! I must have your crossbow in custody until we are through. And then I will return it to you. Trust me. I have no need for your crossbow. I merely need *you* to not have it handy should you try and threaten me!"

"Why not the bag of holding?" asks Riglan. "Because you can still get it!"

This is feeling worse and worse but we haven't much choice and the fiend probably knows it. Given Nethza's sacrifice, Temo hands over the crossbow.

Maireagh asks how we're going to get *back* if he's leading us in only. Riglan knows we can Wind Walk, but the fiend might not; he says that the dead only harass those who enter, anyway. To Temo he says, "I don't know whatever other weapons you have. But I warn you. If any of you attempt to attack me or claim back that which you have freely given, our contract will be null and void. And then I am not sworn to do you no harm! Trust me. It never ends well for anyone except me." He laughs. "Enough dark talk! Let's go! It's a beautiful sunny day!"

As we start, Riglan asks how long it takes (given worries about heat). Only about half an hour. On the way up the stairs, the Fiend tells us all about what this looked like. It confirms Riglan's vision. Temo asks how it fell... What happened that caused the land to dry and be claimed by desert?

"The Netherese! The Netherese Empire fell to that most predictable of human faults; hubris. It fell to hubris. The Netherese Council of Mages dared to challenge the gods themselves. They wielded powerful magic - magic they had no wisdom to understand. They did not understand the boundaries. They did not know their place. They destroyed the stability of the realm of magic and brought calamity upon themselves, opening fissures into other planes - dark planes - shadows of this world. These fissures swallowed up much of the land, their citizens with it, and released hordes of invaders. Twisted creatures. The thing of nightmares, born of nightmares, that fed on nightmares. **Phaerim** is what we call them. They *literally* caused the collapse of the remainder of the Netherese empire - what there was that had not already fallen out of the sky. Did you know that the Netherese had both cities on the ground, for the common folk, and cities in the sky for the nobles? The nobles, the learned, the mages..." (we nod) "...where I come from, this was an endless source of tribute! All the hatred, all of the resentment on both sides for each other. It was like a banquet for people like me. For beings like me. So much to feast upon! So much! Delicious! Delicious hatred! Spicey!"

Riglan says, "I think I might have an appetizer for you as far as Azalin Rex goes, then..." "Ha! A slippery one, that." "Yes, and he's back." I know, I can sense it. His tendrils reach out over the desert as we speak. Has he visited you?" "Not in person. But his influence certainly has." "He doesn't visit in person. His favourite thing is to enter your dreams." Riglan doesn't answer.

"Ah! Here we are. Now stay on the road and stay close to me." He draws some sigils in the air and some kind of barrier appears in the air around us, burning and smelling of sulphur, infernal runes orbiting around us like electrons about a nucleus. This is the darkest part of the pass, narrow and cut down into the mountain. The sun doesn't reach it. No way to see it from the air - it's in places more of a tunnel, tall and arched, a processional avenue cut through.

Maireagh gasps at it - "Oh my goodness. Wow! The feat of engineering required to build this. Astounding!"

A strong wind howls through the tunnel, inevitably. Inlaid into the walls are faded, worn-down remains of relief carvings depicting what were perhaps once quite beautiful scenes. We walk along. It's quite wide, too - 15ft or so. The fire of the orbiting runes provides illumination it he dark. Crawling, sunken-eyed undead become visible ahead, retreating back from the fire and climbing backwards, up the walls, away from us; they regard us, unmoving, once they're far enough away. Riglan perception 13. Temo 25. Riglan is kinda freaked out. Temo, lower down and farther away from the walls, notices something else. Some of these undead are very old - but some are quite a lot younger. Less rotted! The hatred that they have seems to be directed at *Karnach* and not with the rest of us. One that looks recently undead is looking at him with a particularly bad look then points and calls out, "You cheated me! **You cheated me!**" Karnach sends a firey rune out and the undead creature scuttles away.

Temo says, "Cheated huh? What did it mean by that then?" - persuasion 31!

Karnach looks to Temo. "Feisty! I like it! I have nothing to hide. He didn't listen to the fine print... You gave me what I wanted, to the letter. You observed everything we've said. He wanted his cake and to eat it. Thought he was smarter than me - tried to trick me. I am not to be tricked. It is *I* who do the tricking!" - he bellows the last line. "How dare he. He tried to attack me, to take things back; and so he ends up joining the others who have tried to do the same."

So a fair few of the undead here are his fault. And so Karnach is seen as a guide for pilgrims by the village - though in theory they can get out without him, but can't get back in without him - yet he's probably the reason they think they need him in the first place, being responsible for at least some if not all of these undead.

Temo thinks on it for a moment, then says, "It was a good thing you took my crossbow."

"I know. I haven't managed to stay in this mortal form for this long by making mistakes! I quite like this form. Don't you think? Do you find me attractive? Am I not handsome?!"

We reach the tunnel end. "Here we are" he says. "The Veil Of The Seer."

We exit. On the other side, steps lead down a few terraces; we're quite low down here, so not much further to descend, but rock curves up around us on either side - mountains, tall but not towering up above, still in relative foothills, rising maybe 500-600ft each side. There is some sand here, it's warm, but also some green as the mountains provide shelter. In the middle a beautiful, but very geometric village of an architecture that Riglan recognises from drawings and his vision. 

Netherese.

*Floating* at the back, on a ziggurat-like dais with a hollow in the middle, is the cube. It must be 300ft on each edge. It is still aloft - not fallen into the sand as we thought. And these aren't ruins either!

This is our first view of a fully intact Netherese settlement.

He hands back Temo's bag. "Here, I leave you". He thanks us and thanks Nethza in particular for 'the price' - "What price?" asks Nethza, confused.

### 8am, The Saiyaddar / Saladdear (Saladdir?)

We aren't too sure of this places name, given all the translations; the *area* seems best translated as The Saiyaddar, while this village or town, if its name differs, might be Saladdear from the Common transliterated spelling we've seen or, perhaps, Saladdir based on what we've learned about the Netherese and their language over the last few days.

Nothing much else to do - we head directly down towards the village. After a short descent we're passing through tree-lined garden/grove streets. A few people look up from what they're doing as they walk past. Temo, investigation 15+14->29, thinks that the most significant building here is the floating cube. It seems to be the heart of things. There's a building at the base that seems to be connected to it, maybe; he suggests we start there and we march towards it.

There are lots of symbols / iconography around on buildings. People around all seem to be of one or two particular demeanours. Further outside, they looked like they were tending gardens for food; more towards the centre we see more and more wearing very pale yellow robes with sky blue undergarments. Most seem olive-skinned/tanned, but a handful are very pale-skinned; they seem to be attending to scroll shops or book shops. We see no sign of any main or minor market. There's just general all-population maintenance; sweeping, watering gardens by hand, that kind of thing. It's quiet.

Near the cube, sat around one of the gardens is an older dark-skinned man in the yellow clothing talking to a group of three slightly younger people in similar garments. Riglan, perception 16; he notices that, having now walked through a fair chunk of the town, he's not seen any children. He whispers that to Temo - "no children - perhaps they're all in the cube, or kept indoors?" Temo responds, "Or they become pilgrims?"

We head towards the older guy with the three younger people around, hoping for an opportunity to speak. He makes eye contact and acknowledges us without breaking stride in his speech. The others in the group adjust to make room. So we listen. It's Common, surprisingly, but strongly accented and some words are hard to understand - an unusual dialect, with what seems to be some words unique to this place.

The older man speaks of the flow of time. Psuedo-philosophical. Relativity, causality. Temo catches that and plucks up courage to ask, "But if one could travel back, deliberately or accidentally, and make changes - what of the future?"

The three younger ones seems shocked by the question but the older man smiles. "That depends on whether you believe that the future is preordained and all paths, from wherever they stem, are preordained; or if we have the abilities to change what has been foretold. What do you believe, young sir?"

Temo says, "I'm not so sure about this domain. But I am sure that there are domains where the future can be changed; where the changer remembers both paths, but the path travelled after that change is only the new one and everyone else that person meets only know of that new reality."

The old man smiles more, genuine, it seems, making a little encouraging clap! The other three look puzzled. "Then you have already learned the first lesson of Savras! That is, that multiple futures are possible and can exist."

Temo nods. "Yes, and we hope so; for there is a chance that the future of this domain might be very dark indeed - but we hope to change it."

"Yes, that is what we are here for. I assume you know something of your future, you have received a vision of it, and have come to the House Of The All Seeing Eye to learn what other paths lie ahead of you? What else the oracle has foreseen?"

"After a fashion. We think we know a possible future because of a definite past, and a creature of evil that has returned here after a century away. We seek a seer at the House who, we have been told, might help us find and stop this evil. That is the path we hope to forge."

His brow furrows. "It sounds like you mean the Oracle? The Oracle does not interfere in fates. She merely sees them and it is us, who are responsible for steering the world towards a better future based on her visions."

Temo says, "We only know of an name, Valinus Sarnastum; but we are otherwise aligned. We would never ask for others to interfere, unless they stated a desire to assist. We are tasked with this ourselves; we merely seek information that might help us on our quest."

"Yes! Information is what the House Of The All Seeing Eye has always provided. You may know her as Valinus Sarnastum; we only know her as the Oracle. That's a curious name - why is it that you have been provided Cormyrean and Sembian names for the Oracle, when clearly you are not from the east?"

Temo explains the history of our discovery of "V", then "VS", then Valnius. Of the man in the tavern that Riglan first met, the man says - "Ah, yes, he must've been from the East... She was known first amongst the Elves as **Vellyne Syllestrel**; and those in the West as **Vallin Sarnaste**". Temo thanks him for that information and asks, "Is it possible to gain an audience?"

"Yes... Yes, but it is not up to me to grant that. You will have to approach the main House Of The All Seeing Eye and if it has been preordained that you should meet her, then **Elisya**, her hand maiden, will already be there to greet you."

Temo nods, thanks him again for the information, and the conversation about time, apologises for the interruption... "...Not at all! The ebb and flow of fate is a river and there are always pebbles being skipped along it and stones that it flows around, but the river flows on, as it always has and always will."

We take our leave and head towards the big building at the base of the cube. As we approach we start to notice buildings around are all the same size, more or less, except this one large building - some three storeys high, with small towers, all trapezoid shaped. Temo also notices snow on the far mountain peaks - that must be a water source for this apparently well-irrigated village. There are even a few wispy clouds hanging over the ranges, which we've noticed before from afar.

The building is all squares - square sections jut out, with square areas delineated by ledges and blockwork corners, square windows; it's tiled; all very geometric. Well - not squares, not quite; it's an illusion; the building looks taller than it is, we realise, because the shapes taper slightly to the top. Rhomboid. A clever effect. While the whole village shares similar architecture, this particular building is much more grand and decorated. Set above the door is the largest malachite stone Temo has ever seen, carved like an open eye. Where the pupil would be is the largest single perfect emerald has ever seen. It must be a foot across.

Temo stops suddenly. He points at it, and says, "We must never tell anyone else where this place is. You can't write about it, Riglan. People would come to steal this... Greed would win."

There are many more yellow-robed people here, but now some have green undergarments; and a few with ill-fitting robes and white undergarments that look borrowed, milling around. Pilgrims, perhaps; travellers. So those undergarments denote a rank. We see a green rank one bring a kind of crystalline book down. He points to a pilgrim; "You! You have been chosen!" The pilgrim seems delighted and is led up stairs. Looking that way, we see a much older woman with a very severe tied-back white bun and headdress with dangling emeralds, brighter yellow robe and deep green undergarments - and she walks to *us*.

"Ah. Temo. Riglan. Maireagh. Nethza. The Oracle has been waiting for you to arrive. Please come this way with me."

We exchange looks, kind of shrug and follow.

Up the stairs; through beautiful marble hallways; the cream sandstone of the outside untiled areas giving way to all-marble interiors, including pillars. There are even more eye insignias here. All the same - malachite, emerald. Riglan says to Maireagh, "They must have a good mine in these mountains somewhere for all these gems!"

It seems over the top. Perhaps they have arcane significance; wards or observers of some kind; they're over every door and archway. But it's all quite open, despite those divisions; few walls, just arches between pillars.

We go up some open-sided stairs; we see ahead a marble floor tilting at 30 degrees, sloping down on each side by about 30ft. "The cube!" says Temo. It's actually the base underneath - above it, the cube hangs, impossibly. Riglan says, "That's actually quite disconcerting..." since the cube is hovering in front *and above* us, given its sheer size; that's a lot of floating rock!

Light coming in around the base creates a beautiful, soft, diffuse light. We're ushered and instructed to stand within a particular rhomboid space on the marble floor, tiled specially. The lady looks up and touches an amulet - another eye, inevitably - and the gem in the middle starts to rotate as she mouths words. Following her eye line, we see the side of the cube closest to us is starting to turn translucent in a certain location; a diamond shape, following the lines of the cube. Then the translucency fades to nothing, to reveal a passageway with a door at an impossible angle. She bows. "Elysia Bassir will receive you on the other side".

She steps out of the space and there's a weird lurch in our stomachs as we float, suddenly weightless; gravity seems to change and rotate; we land in the cube at a funny angle, a vertigo-inspiring view to the now-tilted building below, our sense of gravity and "down" matching the cube in a horizontal, rather than on-corner, orientation.

A lady in a grey and white robe, no yellow, extends a hand "Steady there! Hold my hand if you need help!" Riglan is glad to take that offer. Temo is fine, Maireagh and Nethza following easily after. With that, we're inside.

"I hope **Shir Endellion** explained that she had been waiting for you." Temo says "Well, sort of - we got that from a guy down near the garden there, who said that if we were allowed to see the Oracle then you'd already be waiting..."

"Oh! Well, we've of course been expecting you. We weren't too sure what time you'd arrive today so the schedule has been kept largely clear. **Xenru** has been seeing people in the main complex but nobody has been up to the cube." Temo says, "Xenru?" "One of the other high priests here, who handles matters that the Oracle does not need to foresee personally. But we understand that you are here to see her, specifically. That you have questions for her - some which she has answers to, and two which she does not. But that I will leave you discuss with her!"

She ties a yellow sash around her waist, very long - she hands it to us - "Just loop it around your waist and hold it with one hand. I want to make sure we're all together!"

Ominous! We tie up as instructed. We're led towards the centre of the cube. Gravity is inconsistent; one moment walking along one "wall", then along the inside of another, then onto a walkway; lots of mirrors around; the walkway leads to a room hovering in the middle, with an opalescent mirror on it that is on a set of complex hinges that allows it to be rotated in all directions. "Make sure you're holding tight and make sure you step confidently with me!" she says - and steps *through* the mirror, some kind of portal, then - we step through.

It's *very* disorientating, and we end up kind of pulling ourselves "up" on the sash. We're inside an unusual temple; crystalline structure; Riglan thinks this looks very like his dream, when he floated outside the library and looked back at it. The sky too isn't sky, it's shifting colour. Riglan says, "Ah, this is like the mage library; it's a separate dimension of some kind. Where now?"

"Well, when you're ready, I'll lead you."

After a moment of adjustment to this strange place - "Let's go!" says Riglan.

It's very confusing. When we're in a "room", crystalline walls give some orientation, but sometimes there's a "shift" in the walls and a corridor reveals; we turn, enter, then there are other strange cubic spaces, but always initially on their corners. We rapidly lose all sense of whatever our original "up" might have been. We reach a beautiful gleaming crystal dais, but we're told not to look at it... We don't look at it. Not the time to take risks! We only see a glimpse.

We walk past and onto a room. "Please hold tight and follow where I go. Don't touch anything. Step where I step..." and we walk into a room that just seems to be an impossible, bewildering array of mirrors - hundreds of versions of ourselves reflected on facets everywhere.

Intelligence saving throws adv., DC 15:

* Temo 19
* Riglan 24
* Maireagh OK
* Nethza OK

We're able to walk through the room OK, keeping eyes on Elysia. She reaches a mirror which she touches; it shimmers and turns into a corridor. She leads us out.

The next room is vast, with a pitched ceiling, strange interior walkway ledges all around; some surfaces here are opaque rather than crystal. It feels like a "real" room. There's soft light coming from small fires set into the walls - jars / urns, set on a smaller ledge below us. Then things slope down towards a pit at the bottom, a bit like what we saw below the cube in the main building. At the very bottom appears to be a sarcophagus!

We are led around the ledges to the other side and a door. "This is as far as I can take you." She hands us all soft silk cloths as we untie the sash. A beautiful bowl in front of us is touched, and becomes filled with crystal clear water. "This is holy water. Please wash and dry; you must not bring anything into this room that is impure." Temo says, "Wait, so, we - undress? And wash and go in naked?" "Wear these" - she points to a stack of silk robes.

Maireagh's unhappy leaving things behind but Temo convinces her. *Everything* is taken off. We clean ourselves in this holy water, wipe down and put on robes. Riglan says, "It's curious; this is the first time I think I've ever worn *nothing*, not even any necklace or symbol of the tribe; we usually wore no clothes, but now I feel actually naked. It's... Unsettling. Sorry Maireagh, this must be difficult." "Yes... But what needs to be done needs to be done..."

We open the door and step into - woah! No gravity! We float immediately. Ahead of us is some kind of strange floating crystalline being, sort of a translucent Silver Surfer! They observe us coming in, then hold out a hand, indicating that we should link hands with it; we do so; it floats and we are basically towed into a strange space. The walls are once again all crystalline here... **And it's filled with small, floating eyeballs** - that seem maybe "semi material"; there but not there, not illusions, yet not solid.

In the centre, floating (but 'sat' cross-legged) with a beautiful diadem and yellow robes hanging down a few feet below her, green wraps underneath - almost like mummies, but green silk, with just her head, hands and feet (no footwear) free - surrounded by eyes. The crystal - what, golem? - tows us towards her. We are left close, hanging in space; the golem retreats.

The Oracle opens her eyes. All of the floating eyes around now turn towards us... Her voice sings crystal clear in our heads; her mouth does not move; "You have arrived. I have answers for most of your questions but not all. And that intrigues me... Perhaps we need to look at other versions of the future to find those answers? But I cannot answer you until you ask your questions. What order will you ask them in? I am most interested to know."

Riglan looks confused. "We were told you had answers to questions, but not two; yet I can only think of two in total. How do we find Azalin Rex and how do we stop him?"

"One question at a time! Azalin Rex's location is know to me. I know where he will be at a given point in time. That much I have seen. There are four such points in time that I can share with you... Some most certainly will come to pass. Some are less clear."

Temo can't stop himself and says, "Does he reach Deepgarden Keep?"

* "One possible future sees him reigning over Mount Hotenow, having laid waist to the Sword Coast" (we know that's near Neverwinter). "And that is a future that I am here to help you avoid."
* "One vision has him facing you at a dark sea, the Sea Of Shadows; somewhere, in the desert, where you stepped into this portal that brought you to my realm."
* "One vision has him without you, but that can change; that is him rising out of the Sea Of Fallen Stars, a vision that has echoed throughout history..." Riglan asks, "Thank you. And the fourth possibility?"
* "The fourth vision has you at the head of an army with paladins riding across the bridge at the edge of the Moon Sea, to face him and his forces at Zhentil Keep with the **amassed might of the Zhentarim around him.**" (Maireagh suspects that "Zhentil Keep" might be some sort of headquarters for the Zhentarim). "Is that vision after he rises from the Sea Of Fallen Stars?" "Yes."

So the order would be - Sea Of Fallen Stars; Zhentil Keep; Sea Of Shadows; then if it had all failed, Mount Hotenow.

* Another point raised is that *meeting* him vs *stopping* him are separate issues. We might *meet* him at the Sea of Fallen Stars but fail to stop him, so then Zentil Keep might still happen, for example. The Oracle sees these things as four separate points in time - she looks at thousands of possible futures and identifies four where she sees clearly enough that Azalin Rex is there.

Riglan asks his second question, "Thank you; so; how do we *stop* Azalin Rex?"

* "That is an interesting question, because I can only see an answer that fits with the question that *I* would ask. The problem is, I don't believe that is the question that you are asking, so I need to understand what it is that you are asking. As far as *we* are concerned, the way to stop Azalin Rex is to share with you where he is so that you can encounter him because *you* have the means to stop his advance and to send him back. And that is stopping Azalin Rex for our purposes."

Riglan thinks and tries, "Where might we find people or artefacts or tools that could help us succeed in combat against Azalin Rex, so that we can fulfil our obligations to weaken him, so that he might be sent back?"

* "That I can answer. You will find allies throughout the realms of his foes! He seeks the power of the Netheril and the Netheril's longest-standing foes are the nation of Cormyr, who stood against the most recent rise and return of the Netherese; and the elves of Cormanthor, my people, who have stood against Azalin Rex before in a previous generation."

* "You will also find allies amongst the wealthy traders and greedy merchants of Sembia." - we sense that she's got a coloured view of Sembia!

* "If he has corrupted and robbed the life from the lands of Cormanthor, then you will find allies in the lost kingdoms of the Anauroch. There are many ancient, powerful kingdoms that used to exist there, that have faded away; but their wealth and power remains. There are beings - powerful dragons, mighty giants, and long-lived - or shall I say unlived? - how have amassed this power for themselves. They would stand against him."

She shares a vision suddenly. The air around us changes. The crystal wall becomes a place to see the future, or perhaps the past? Or *a* future. The desert; a submerged ziggurat, sand spilling over the edges, inhabited by a crystal dragon. Then, deep in the dunes, caverns that lead down into massive subterranean old cities with stone giants within, painting amazing dreamscapes on the cavern walls, deep under the stand. Next, a mausoleum set into the side of a hill, surrounded by sand; a very powerful mummy king, holding a bejewelled sceptre with an asp head with gem eyes.

Riglan's next best question. "How long until Azalin Rex reaches the Sea Of Shadows?"

* "That question is not clear. In some futures, he never reaches the Sea. In the one that I saw, **he arrives in six weeks**. You do not have long in that future."

Last one he can think of. "How can we find that gem dragon and the caverns leading to the stone giants?"

* "Those I can provide you..." - she looks at Riglan and says, "Watch carefully." The inside of the room changes into the night sky. Stars - constellations are pointed at; their relative positions, their movements. Riglan understands. Night travel only, though.

"I don't know if I can ask this - you said the most interesting questions were the ones for which you had no answer, but it seems I have not asked those. What were those questions?"

* "Huh!" - she looks puzzled at him. "I cannot ask your questions for you. Perhaps the answers I have given you have been enough to show you the path and you no longer have those questions; the future may be clearer than we think. There was never always the need for you to ask those questions."

"How come that strange guy in the tavern knew to tell me about you?"

* She smiles. "He's a pilgrim! I sent him to find you." "Well, it worked." "Evidently. He is also headed further West, for there are two tangled threads; **yours is one, there is another**."

She says, "**He must be stopped. If he reaches the Sea Of Shadows and obtains what he seeks there, and manages to meet another, the world will crumble to dust anyway.** There is another lich that he can influence. We must stop him before he can reach her."

Riglan says, "In that case, if I am permitted another question, in the future when he emerges from the Sea Of *Fallen Stars* - how long from now is that?"

* "20 days - two weeks".

Enough time for the Sembians to be back. Not enough time for the Knights. She confirms; "Those knights who ride to Zentil Keep would not have reached the Kingdom Of Cormyr yet. You will have to face him without them."

"Are there any things we can do, that we have currently not done, to withstand the powers of Azalin Rex?"

* She closes her eyes for a moment. "That is one question I had no answers to. There are..." - the surrounding eyes turn slightly blueish and turn around, looking outward; the surrounding walls change into overlapping visions, overwhelming, all different possibilities. Too many to choose. It's tied too much to individual choices.

"I understand. Is there any particular weakness you have observed that we might exploit in Azalin Rex?"

* "**Yes**". She turns and points at Nethza. Oh, fuck. "**She** is his weakness. That is why he fears her." "Why is Nethza Azalin's weakness?" "**She carries a conduit to everything from which he is trying to escape. Through her, the Dark Powers can pull him back into his prison realm. As long as she lives, he is not safe.** Without her, that prison realm will no longer exist. And although he could be captured, it would require the same disastrous magic that was needed the first time that he was captured and sent there."

"You have been very patient. Thank you. I do not know if you see futures in other realms; we worry about those we left behind in that prison realm and how they might fare; is there anything we can do, if Azalin is sent back, to help them prosper?"

* "Yes, there is. **The Dark Powers are known to bargain. A deal could be struck at the moment of the fulfilment of your task - asking for the freedom of those in that realm.** The Dark Powers have the powers of gods; if you were to ask me that, I would grant it; but it is not my domain. And I am not yet the Goddess Of Fate!"

Riglan, insight 18; at those last words he senses the crystal walls clouding over suddenly; smokey, opaque, as if she whispered the last few words as a secret. In that moment, Riglan perception adv. 28; as the light from the outside realm is cut off for a moment by the clouding, he sees - or rather senses? - a brief, momentary shift in the room as the walls cloud, which gives a distinct sense of deep, centuries-old festering corruption in the air! Not decay; slow corruption. He sees that what she is wrapped in really are mummy-like wrappings. Her face, for a brief moment, looks desiccated, not a beautiful elf. It's momentary. The crystal walls return to their original state and she looks young again. She's not a lich, but something along those lines, somehow. He gets the feeling he shouldn't reveal it. She's helping us, after all.

Might this corrupt her visions? Might this even be Azalin at work?

"One last question then. The last one, I promise. Is there anything *we* can do to help *you*, personally, in return for your help?" "Me?!" "Yes." She thinks a while... Then answers, "Yes, there is." She produces a sword hilt. Beautiful, platinum. "Place this into the crystal dais. That you can do for me."

Riglan takes it and says, "Then it shall be done." As he touches it, there's a sudden, almost-shock vision; two competing futures. One, she wields the hilt with a flaming radiant sword of light coming out of it that's plunged into someone who has a sword on her neck; and in the other, someone else holds the hilt and it pierces her instead, in the chest.

"Thank you", she says.

The golem floats up. We link hands again. She says, "I wish you all a happy life. We will not meet again." Riglan says, "And we wish that you for you, too...".

We are towed back to the threshold. We exit into gravity - a relief. Our things are all where we left them; we get changed back into our normal clothes and sort out our gear. It feels good to be back in now-familiar desert clothing, amongst such unfamiliar surroundings. We wait a while, but then Elysia knocks on an adjoining door and asks "are you decent?" and Temo responds, "Depends upon your definition of decent! We're clothed." The door opens and Elysia gives us the sash; she points to the silk robes; "All of these we will clean. I trust you had a fruitful visit?" Temo answers after a bit of a pause, "Very enlightening." "Are you ready?" "Yep, time to go!" We tie again and start the journey back.

Riglan's deep in thought, very quiet, doesn't say a word. We are led back through. At the hall of mirrors, we go out of the door into the large opaque room. Riglan takes a very close look, as best he can, at the sarcophagus. Perception 25. It's 20ft or so below us; and beautiful! Crystalline. There is an eye motif set into it, within a triangle, carved into the top. He can see through it and it seems empty. He speaks; says, "It awaits its occupant?" - pointing. "Yes. That's something the Oracle had installed a long time ago. It awaits her passing, which I hope will not come! Vellyne is the only bright light in a world full of shadow and darkness. She's the only star I can see in the emptiness of the night."

Riglan gestures upwards with his staff, vaguely. "I see four, that guide me. Four that came before myself, and one day I'll join them. Take heart. There is more than one good star in this world." She answers, "We all follow our own hearts."

Onward. Riglan's waiting for the dais room. We're led through out of the ledge room and, there it is. Riglan says, "There is a task I have been given" and undoes the sash, then **has to look at the dais**, as he sees no other way to approach.

Intelligence saving; only 9+5. Pain shoots through his head; 14 psychic damage. There's some kind of barrier or other confusing emanation; the dais looks at once in every state of possible being - a perfect crystalline dais shining with prismatic light; it looks cracked; it looks shattered into rubble; and everything in between. He tries casting Bless on himself; In one of those stages, Riglan sees the hilt he carries can neatly fit into the centre, encased in the crystal. He approaches, trying to focus on *that* version and attempts to place the hilt exactly there. Arcana, 13+2; not enough; he takes 42 (!) piercing damage as his hand is sliced up badly by the crystal shards as he withdraws his hand. His hand is shredded badly, bleeding profusely, and he cries out in agony; but **the hilt is well placed**.

Elysia is astonished; "Oh my goodness!" she cries and casts L3 Cure Wounds on Riglan; 21 healed. It stems the bleeding at least; he thanks her.

Now looking out of the corner of his eye, he sees the dais intact, hilt encased. He says, "Well, I don't know why she wanted that, but even though I was clumsy, it seems the job is done."

Elysia says, "Almost done!" and just keeps leading us out. As she does, she pulls out a beautiful silk-wrapped package and says - "The Oracle gave this to me to hand to you as you were leaving... You are to give this to **Xemru Thal**. This was the task that I was told to pass to you." Riglan nods; "Very well, if you could point us in the right direction once we're out of the cube...!" "You will be able to find Xemru quite easily; Shir Endellion will be there to meet you and will be able to take you to him. She is after all his second in command."

We get to the door and asks, "Are you ready?" Riglan says as we reach there, "Did I do a bad thing? The hilt? Your reaction was surprisingly neutral." "What do you mean?" "You didn't seem happy or sad; just concerned for my injury." "Well you were injured! Were you not asked to do that by the Oracle?" "Yes" "So I don't understand what you're asking!" and Riglan laughs, and says, "Ah, I guess I have a misunderstanding of your faith. Please forgive the question, it has no meaning."

We are walked through the super-confusing portal; we're back on Feyrun, albeit in the strange shifting gravity cube. We're led along the same route back to the edge; the doorway is currently a wall, but she draws a glyph and it disappears. She undoes the sash and asks us to understand in a particular square marked at the end of the corridor. "Go well" "Thank you. You too." - and we float; weird shifts again; finally, back down to the main building. We see people running our way as we head down. Shir Endellion is clearly visible striding towards the landing point; behind her are people who were perhaps waiting for their chance.

When we land, Riglan asks, "Have we been gone a long time?" She answers, "You were a little longer than I thought you would be; you must have had many questions. You have been in there for - oh goodness - 40 minutes." Riglan's relieved; no time shenanigans. "I'm sorry if we overstayed our welcome; the Oracle was very... Accommodating." We're told it's no issue, she was just surprised as they'd thought that there were only a few questions (the few with answers and two without, which did not actually quite transpire).

Riglan mentions the parcel. She's surprised, but leads us to Xemru. We reach an area with stone seats and a small scrying pool. In conversation, Shir reveals her surprise is because she hadn't been told about this new task nor had visions of it; she surmises that this must be a new branch of the future the Oracle had kept to herself, arising a result of our questions and actions in our meeting.

We sit, the parcel in Riglan's lap. Temo reaches towards it. Riglan says, "I think that unwise." Temo withdraws and says, "Well, perhaps we'll see what it is when Xemru arrives." "Perhaps. But I'm reaching my limit of possible futures and branches and mysteries for the day, I fear!"

It's only a handful of minutes. Footsteps ringing on the stone. A bald, much older, half-elven, dark-skinned man approaches. He seems healthy; no walking stick for example. "I've been told you await me with a message from the Oracle? Unusual for her to not tell me directly through visions." Riglan says, "Perhaps because it is not a message of the mind; it appears to be physical!" and hands over the parcel. "Oh! For me?!" - he very surprised; he sits next to us and opens the parcel immediately. A beautiful crystal rectangle, a carved crystal shell; embedded in the core, a book; in the centre of the front, a very large emerald; along the sides, more, each of those probably worth 5000gp or so each. Temo even with Luck is only perception 16 via R.T.; all he sees is the title - **"The Canopic Being"**. A note has been written and placed with it, which he has already picked up; Temo tries to sneak a look... Stealth, again via R.T. - 26. **"Xemru - a precious book. When you are done, deliver it to Candlekeep"**. It is signed "V.S."

"How odd!" exclaims Xemru, wrapping the parcel back up. He stands, putting it under his arm; "Thank you. Is there anything else that you require here?" Riglan says, "You have been very accommodating and helpful, thank you. If it comes it, is there a place we could stay the night here?" "Of course! Saladdir has amazing hospitality. Pilgrims often stay for months." That jog's Riglan's memory. "Ah! Yes. The pilgrims. A nasty business, that fiend; guarding the entrance way, the passage through." He seems confused, so Riglan explains more. Xemru isn't even aware of it! "Is this new?!" "Very much not so!" "We've had members of the House Of The All Seeing Eye leave and return and none have mentioned a fiend or undead blocking a passage. Are you certain?"

Confusing; we say "yes, we heard that the way out is permitted without the fiend, but to get in, he must escort you and it did indeed seem that way to us; he mentioned a price. Curiously, we cannot remember more about the price..." - Xemru suggests that perhaps their faith protects them? "It is possible of course, I cannot say; and none of the *pilgrims* have ever mentioned this?" "We've never asked! They've never said! Would you like to ask some?" "If we are permitted, certainly..." "You'll find the pilgrims in the Courtyard Of Questing" - and leads us to the front doors, then from atop the stairs, gestures to a courtyard a short distance away. We thank him and head down to the courtyard. He comes with us some of the way; he's toying with his amulet and thinking to himself; then he says, "Um, ah! Aucozor? Ocuzor?" - seems to be struggling with a name. Then he points to a Tiefling with flaming red skin, very muscular, 6.5ft tall, dressed almost like a Roman gladiator. He points. "Ocuzor. You seek an audience. The Oracle will see you!" The Tiefling roars in happiness, "Yes! A glorious day. I knew it!" and bounds up the stairs.

Temo asks Xemru, "Can we ask *him* or does he need to hurry?" "Well, you could try asking, sure..." On the way past, the Tiefling saying "I have waited a week for this!" and Temo responds with, "In that case, would it be OK just to ask for one minute of your time? It's OK, the Oracle won't mind. We just wondered when you passed through the tunnel after the stairs, between and under the mountains, did you encounter a strange guide there, who helped you through?" "Yes! Yes I did. I was told to seek the Gatekeeper. Yes. I found him. I paid his price." "Do you remember what he asked for?" "Yes, my grandfather's sword, which I had always carried with me. But what I am here to discover from the Oracle is far more valuable than an heirloom sword. I did not need it, after all, for he managed to scare the undead away." Xemru is surprised. "Curious, very curious! I wonder how many have had your experience? Shall we go?" he says, gesturing up the stairs; the two head back into the large building.

Riglan says, "Well we're not going mad; and I don't know if the gatekeeper is valid protection or just opportunistic evil." There are other pilgrims, so we ask. Even with luck, Temo still, again, has to rely on R.T.; investigation 24. A few of them remember and mention what they had to give away. Two, one who's been waiting a long while and another for a little less - still about ten days though! - seem very surprised. "There was no gatekeeper; we came up the stairs; by the time we got here it would've been late afternoon, baking hot and I needed to get out of the sun, so I made a beeline for the stairs and thankfully cooled off in the tunnel."

We learn that he'd run out of memory and, when we describe the Gatekeeper, had heard the legend - but forgot and just ran straight through. So perhaps it's a time of day thing, or perhaps the Gatekeeper is just a ruse! Perhaps anyone can come through and the Gatekeeper stories just scare you - the undead are, after all, apparently only angry at the fiend. Or at least - some of them were.

### 10am

The inn is nearby so we head over, Riglan's dragging his feet a bit. We get there and head inside; an innkeeper offers us two rooms, one looking towards the courtyard and cube; another facing out, towards the mountains. Riglan asks the others, but he'd prefer mountains. There is agreement. We are led along a corridor to the stated room. On the way, an open door to presumably the other room shows an *interior* courtyard with a small pool - oh! Riglan misunderstood; he thought the courtyard meant the main one, with the cube. Didn't want that! Oh well, mountains are nice.

The ceiling is about 9ft up, so a bit close to Riglan's head. The beds have gauze curtains, we're told to keep off insects; the windows are open to keep a breeze flowing. We thank the innkeeper and then Riglan just sits heavily on the edge of a bed, exhausted, looks 100 years older. The last few days have been **intense**. We have a heart-to-heart; comfort Nethza - her strange connection to the Shadowfell seems a force for good, not evil. We must be on alert.

Heads are spinning. Too many options. The room is cool enough and it's just too hot anyway outside, even in the mountains. We have some fruit and water, then do what we can to become comfortable and rest until we can sleep. When we awake it will be dark and Riglan will see if there is enough sky visible to get a feel for distances on the locations the Oracle indicated, but it might need us to be in the open desert.

Temo sets up Alarm while Maireagh makes sleepy tea. Riglan drops the bombshell at this point - "Did you see? The Oracle?" "What? We all saw the Oracle." "No, the true one!" Blank looks. Riglan says, "She's old - mummified, possibly undead; not a lich; not sure. When the walls clouded, it slipped for a minute - that time when she talked about not being the Goddess of Fate - yet" - Maireagh agrees this was a strange choice of words; "perhaps living in that weird isolated place does things to your head?"

Riglan shakes his head. "No it's worse than that. There's something wrong - a corruption; slow, decades or centuries old, I only felt it briefly, too briefly to understand it but long enough to be sure."

Nethza asks what that means - can we trust the answers?

"She's acting in good faith; we have no choice but to trust; I don't know if that corruption is Azalin or not. The hilt - when she gave me that - two visions, at the same time, one where she killed an enemy with it, but one where that enemy killed her with the same sword. I think - I think that's what the dais was about. That's why I did it and didn't mind being hurt. And I'd be willing to bet that there's more to that book than meets the eye. Ever the contents are more significant that we realise, or if there are notes inside it; if Xemru is to take over? I think the Oracle is trying to find a way out, that fixes things somehow. Or at least, gives her an ending that isn't corrupted. Whatever that looks like."

After a pause, he adds, "But I just didn't understand enough. And everyone else around doesn't know. And we have bigger problems. I hope the hilt was enough to make a difference somehow. We'll probably never know. And again, we have to trust those visions."

"She seemed certain we would not see her again..." adds Nethza.

Riglan nods. "Yeah, true that."

With the aid of Maireagh's tea, we sleep.
