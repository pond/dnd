# Riglan: Part 3.21
## Day 59
### 4:30pm, Yulash

Yulash was betrayed - in exchange for a promise of power, a disillusioned councillor had been in contact with Azalin Rex and sold out the town. Azalin's army had started to head cross-country towards the town. Through means of luck, stealth and investigation we discovered this and with some deception and a little magic, we "convinced" the councillor to warn Azalin about a 10,000-strong army from Cormyr being present; in his rage at the news, Azalin killed the councillor. From a watchtower's spyglass, we observe Azalin Rex's army, a few miles away from the town, halted; but then a vanguard detaches and moves towards the town. It seems he did not fully trust the report and intends to test the town's defences.

We must evacuate the outlying farmhouses immediately!

Riglan shouts to Temo, "You're the fastest! Find a councillor, get them to sound the alarm. If we're lucky, they've a bell like Hillsfar."

Temo nods and darts away. Investigation, 16+15 -> 31! He runs down and finds the council room; bursts in; it's full of people. He shouts, "Azalin's main army has been duped into passing us by, but he's testing us - a vanguard is riding our way - we must evacuate the fields or people will be killed!"

Aberness needs to warn the army too - from the top of the tower, he fires off a pyrotechnics spell. The bell starts to ring and downstairs, Temo is looking for Isteval; investigation 29, he's in the keep courtyard. Temo uses L3 sending to the "lead" general he met earlier, to say, "It's a vanguard from Azalin's army - not the full force, but he tests us, so we should respond!" and then, catching up with Isteval in the courtyard, relays that same information. Isteval gets courier sent to the front line immediately with a message to say - **raise the flags of war**. Isteval grabs a nearby squire and runs to the courtyard side, where there are two big bundles; flags of war, we guess! Everyone runs up in to the tower and now, up top, we have the four of us (plus dog), *three* war mages, Isteval and a squire. They start to set up the flags, and the four of us say that we'd better get down to fight so we run down - Isteval shouts after us, "**Head to the centre flank!**"

Down in the courtyard we can see a contraption setting up in the tower above, all panels with different flags. This must be a way to communicate with the army.

"How can it be a centre *and* a flank?!" shouts Riglan as we're running and Temo says, "That's just what they call them. We're going to the middle bit!" and points down; we can see five distinct sections formed up ahead. Different sections are raising different flags and banners. Each includes a different colour. They are two sided; the front carries the Cormyrean crest and the back apparently can be changed. The side facing the enemy shows the Cormyrean crest. On the different-style backs, each carries a Purple Dragon Knights symbol; we're not sure what that's about; readiness perhaps. The backs can change symbols via cords and pulleys, and are it seems quickly being tested. The tower and flanks have ways to talk to each other.

We look back up there; a glint of light from the spyglass. Then two flags raise up on either side of the strange mast up there, draping down. As they do so, we hear people yelling commands - we're getting close to "our" flank. They have people watching the tower then, to pass on the commands verbally. The positions of soldiers shifts in response. Cavalry step aside and foot soldiers step back - the archers move forward. Arrows are readied.

We're starting to run alongside our flank now. More shouting. Barricades are being set up. Damage to fields inevitable now. We overhear, now we're close to the front, a commander; she shouts, "I need eyes on the enemy" and Riglan shouts, "I can do that!" and calls the Hawk, which soars up under command to get an eye on them. Adv perception 21, at full altitude 100ft distance; he shouts, "Three separate columns riding our way. Cavalry leads. Fast-marching foot soldiers, can't see weaponry. Creatures... Fast... Ah, ogres; scattered around, but feral, misshapen. Everything is! Remember, these are *all* undead - expect abominations; expect surprising behaviour." "How far?" "Barely half a mile, maybe; 2,500 feet give or take!"

The call goes out - **"Hold!"**

The flag operator nearby starts movements. Temo runs back to get a good luck (Investigation 25 by R.T.) - sees how the various banners move and how each one indicates the state of the army. Acknowledge an order is seen often, ready is the base Purple Knights banner, that kind of thing. They aren't obscure images - he gets a good sense of what's what. If push came to shove he might be able to operate this for some limited signalling. There are three more that he's not seen yet though.

The commander says to our group, "I would fly back for a moment if I were you - get out of the way!" and so Riglan moves the hawk back and down, behind the archers, just in range.

Suddenly there's a change in the air. Wind dies. A magical wind starts to pick up... It starts to blow, over the army from behind us; hawk turns around, looks behind. Different flags have been raised on the tower and the three war mages are holding a spell. Riglan was worried that it was Azalin. The wind picks up quickly and Riglan realises it wasn't about the archers that he was told to land; it was the wind! The hawk quickly lands on his shoulder and he steadies it with his hand.

War mages within the troops start to cast as well; channeling the wind? Slipstreams form - it's quite spectacular, they're actually visible due to dust and occasional momentary moment of spontaneous condensation. Then the commander calls - "Now!" and the arrows are fired - *into the slipstream*. They race away! Other war mages throw an arc of flame in front and this makes a lot of the arrows catch fire. Riglan finds himself surprisingly excited and energised by this display of power, "Spectacular!" he calls out. The commander orders, "Notch!" - and the archers ready arrows again - "Hold!" - eyes on the tower; Temo sees flags change, then a call, "Belay, belay! Ineffective!" - Riglans ears drop in dismay!

More flags flutter... Temo is pretty sure he hears, "Tortoise down"?! "Switch rows!" barks the commander as shield bearers with spears now replace the archers at the front. They're expecting melee. "Forward!" and the whole column starts to march forward. The cavalry splits to either side, archers dropping back. We hold our relative positions, Nethza helping Riglan as he's still looking through the hawk, which is flying again; adv perception 24. He sees why the army belayed the order. The army has arrows sticking out; some burned and charred; but it's not apparently slowed them down at all! Riglan calls out, "Range estimate, 1200ft, closing fast".

The whole army then hunkers down. The cavalry are told to hold; shield and spears with foot soldiers push forward a bit and then form a wall. The cavalry separate out a little, creating a gap. The tower watcher calls, "Flanking manoeuvre!" - the cavalry immediately split off and gallop forward. Via the hawk Riglan sees series of pyrotechnics fly from the tower, a great distance, exploding and showering down on certain areas of the battlefield, leaving a soft glow; and this seems a cue for on-ground war mages to start casting in turn. It's something akin Riglan thinks to Moonbeam (he later learns it's called "Dawn"). The marked areas become illuminated. The advancing vanguard seems to want to avoid that and starts to funnel in - the Cormyreans are forcing them to kind of make an arrowhead shape, which makes flanking easier.

The commander then tries to rally! "Hold the line - do not let them pass; they will crash us into a wave, but we are immovable, like the shore!"

Temo stops flag watching and returns to the party's side, now sensing that bad guys will be in range soon. Behind, a new flag showing a sun appears. The commander shouts, "Shields up, cover your eyes!" and Riglan instructs quickly his hawk to turn away as people all turn and shield their eyes. By this call, the advancing lead party are barely 120ft away. A wall of light is thrown up to "wall of" the gap between Dawn patches. Riglan watches, eyes narrowed, shading his eyes; the riders come through but they're burned, just like we saw in the wagon chase. As they come through, Riglan is readying Sunburst; the commander calls, "Notch, aim, fire!". Volleys go into the concentrated area coming through the front.

Temo (perception 17) wants to see who might be a good guy to take down. It's a mess. Cavalry in front, riddled with arrows, still make it through. They crash into the shields, but the Cormyreans push back. The row behind with shortswords jump over and start hacking - "300" stylee.

* Temo starts aiming and firing
* Riglan uses the hawk and sees ogres crashing through the drawn areas; they burn, but then seem to collapse into a scattered swarm of small, misshapen creatures. - the flesh golems again - which scatter across the battlefield
* Riglan picks the densest area he can, 150ft range, to cast L8 Sunburst. As he's doing this, one by one, dawn areas start to falter - limited spell duration.

The spell fires. A great many of the now-scattering small creatures are incinerated. What remains are parts of animals, even carcasses part-eaten, everything just magically strung together in this horrifying way.

It helps. The shield bearers aren't overwhelmed by all the small creatures. The cavalry now have ridden around and attack from the rear. Temo fires over and over, always aiming for the biggest creatures. Before long, Riglan realises that he doesn't need to do much else - **the vanguard is being destroyed quickly now**. The hawk circles to view the other columns - they're not as far ahead as us, but the same outcome; they'll succeed, except to Riglan's dismay he sees maybe a dozen of the bigger riders turn and escape, back to the main army, too far away to do anything about it. That's a shame. He hawk circles round and sees the tower. Adv perception only 15, the hawk sees different flags; a shield and some kind of stake-in-ground? Hold, thinks Riglan?

Riglan sees through its eyes that there aren't five units spread across fields now - it's split into some 15. He's not sure why that is. At this moment, the commander calls, "Hold your position!" - but the army seems to be moving, advancing past us. He voices his surprise. Temo, INT-based check, immediately realises they're illusions. "It's for show! For the retreating generals to mis-report!"

A handful of very tense minutes pass; then a call - "Stand down! Return to town!"

Flags on the tower start to be lowered. It's over!

Riglan keeps watching by the hawk, not trusting. The generals had made it back to the main army; and it starts to move - North. He tells Temo, but warns that he's going to keep an eye via the hawk on that army for a while, if Temo wouldn't mind staying here for a bit. The tower is probably watching too. Around us, people are falling back. About ten minutes go by; Azalin's army is definitely moving on, but seems to have left behind - *something*. A strange, green mist... It sits on the ground where they were. It's slowly blowing towards town.

Riglan asks Temo, "Quick! Alert the war mages! I don't have Control Weather!" so Temo runs back to the packing-up flag guy and persuasion 29 - tells him, "We need wind! The cloud - poison, headed our way!" - so things are raised and checked again; they're not looking though - Temo uses his wand of pyrotechnics to try and get attention. A few moments pass, then a flag drops in the tower to acknowledge. Then something our flag guy simply says is "no fly!" - the hawk is brought down and we hunker down close to the ground. Wind whips past us, very strongly, but not channelled this time. The mist in the distance is dispersed, or at least, deflected.

Once the hawk is back up, Riglan sees that grass has dried and died where the mist touched. Trees are sickly and withered. As the mist eventually rises, it takes on a sickly reddish-green tinge as the sun drops - and the sun sets. "Oh by the hells" says Riglan. "The elves! Stop the elves moving!"

Temo L3 Sending Isevele, "Azalin's Army encountered 6 miles off Yulash. Skirmsh, but then headed North. Consider travel time before moving your forces."

A courier approaches. "Temo Smoothhands and party? Your presence is requested in the councillor chamber! As is yours, commander" (which makes Riglan jump has he didn't know the commander had stayed out here with us). A barricade is being set up; people are on alert; tents will be at the perimeter. They're taking no chances.

### 5pm

It's amazing how swiftly battles can pass. Barely half an hour. An early sunset? We've lost count of days and seasons by now. Oh! Mountains. There's a range that's quite a distance, but high. It's not dark, just shadow.

Walking through the town, people are full of questions, scared. As we go, Temo tries to give brief answers, mostly along the lines of, "The evil army tested our defences, but between your guards and the new army, they were repelled. We think the main army is leaving now but we're still on alert just in case."

There's a lot of rumour and misinformation. People just don't know what's going on.

At the keep, the councillors are afraid; they have their families with them. "What is the news from the front lines?!" and Temo repeats his short version. "Are we - do you think they'll return? Will we be attacked tonight?" - Temo answers honestly.

The estimate is that Azalin lost some 300 or so of his forces bar the dozen who escaped. We lost nobody, astonishingly, but about 40 were injured, a few seriously, but all are being tended to and in recovery. They don't have many paladins and just one town priest, so both Marieagh and Riglan end up going to help.

Nethza and Temo stay in the council rooms. The councillors ask, "How will we know if we're safe? How will we know if nobody else here has been corrupted?" - and then they start talking over each other a bit, rumours, suspicions. Temo steps on that *right* away, shutting it down firmly. He explains that - frankly - Yulash is just not important enough!

One councillor approaches and asks if there's anything they can do for us, for helping. Temo says yes, but not for *us* - he's going to let the elves know that the Hillsfar refugees can come here, if they can accommodate? Yes, the agree, of course.

Other than that, a recommendation for a modest inn. "Head to the market inn! It is my family's inn. You are welcome to rooms there."

Temo messages Brady Miller. "Hope you are all well. Yulash had skirmish but now believed safe. They will welcome you all. Come here." - a response - "Thank you. The elves have been kind but we do not want to impose longer than required. Mysterious, inscruitible people! Yulash has always been friendly..." - and it cuts, 25 words. Brady doesn't know the spell limits.

We wait for Riglan and Maireagh to finish up, let them know about the Hillsfar refugees. Before we go, Temo wants to see if we can find Isteval or any of the war mages that were in the tower. There's still a scout; so he asks after Isteval. "I think he's headed down to town; we're not sure exactly what he's doing?" and Temo figures - "tavern!" - so we head down into town, searching for a tavern. One is particularly lively and easy to spot, off the market square - which itself is surprisingly lively - "The Trading Post". Temo runs in between legs, looking for Isteval. It's all very tall tales and gossip, but some corrections from a group at the bar - a voice is recognised. Temo runs back out - "He's in there!" and our party pushes in. Riglan sees him over the heads of crowds quickly. Isteval, squire and one of the other Knights.

We get to the bar. Riglan says, "I owe you a round! Quite an impressive show, I have to say!" "I didn't really do anything, I was looking through a spyglass the whole time" "The whole *army* you idiot!" - we figure out tha Isteval was the strategy brains. Temo chips in, "Yeah, that's what I wanted to mention..." - he mentions that the tower was surely noticed as being vital, and it's a prime target, along with Isteval - they know! They have strategies for protection.

Rounds of beer are purchased. Temo then jumps onto the bar (turning and apologising to the barman and whispering, "I'll clean it after!") and then shouts, full bard mode, "FRIENDS! If you will permit me your ears for one short story, I will grant every man and woman in this tavern a free drink on my coin!"

Temo pulls out the Lute, and starts singing; telling the story of the battle - accurately - with minor illusions and for the big bit when the wall of light went up and the generals crashed into the shield wall, he even uses Major Image for that (he's spent 3xL3 already but we hand-wave it). People are pushed in, children's faces at the window - the whole thing. He's distracted by all the magic but RT helps with Performance to 20 (otherwise - 3, luck point, 3, Nethza helps, 3!)

When it's all finished, Temo uses the cleaning stone. We go to pay for all the drinks and the bar tender tells Temo his money is no good here! "But why?!" "You have saved our town - look at the faces of the children! These children will be able to grow up and fall in love and start their families and live their lives. Besides, people are now in a very merry mood and we will no doubt make some good money tonight!" Temo says, "Very generous sir. Thank you."

We head out, and go towards the inn. Perception Riglan 23, he spots a jewellers and antiques. "Oh!" he exclaims. "This is a long shot, but..." - and heads inside. "**Artus' Antiques And Artefacts**" it's called. Everyone else trails in after him. It must be close to closing time, but it's open.

There's a desk. It has the "owner lives above the shop and must be open all the time to sell anything" vibe. Riglan clears his throat at the sight of a man eating soup behind! He quickly dusts himself down and welcomes us.

Riglan leads with the expensive thing! The 1000gp gem-encrusted bowl. "I don't have one, but I know someone who does - **Pammy**, the inn keeper's mother. She has this beautiful antique gold bowl, that she found many years ago. She used to be a bit of a hero!" "An adventurer?" asks Temo. "Perhaps! It's one of the things she had - she found it in some lost cavern somewhere, but you could speak to her. I know it has some gems on it. I've never been able to afford to buy it! Too rich for my blood."

So we then change to asking about artefacts. What does he have?

He shows us a beautiful metal owl. "I bought this from a trading caravan. I don't know if overpaid for them - a set of five!" - he shows us the others; they're all different colours; he puts them down, winds them up and they walk! "I've never seen anything like this. Have you? From another world I wonder. Some ancient lost culture? Maybe even the Netherese." (It's not!) "And there's these!" - a wooden box, silver lining, with two parts of an old blade. It *is* Netherese, but broken. It's really just a collection of things that catch his eye, with probably neither seller or buyer knowing what the value is.

Riglan quietly casts Detect Magic. Two items shine. He asks about one - a strange-looking, old, dirty glass horn, with filigree gold detailing all around it. A chain allows you to wear it around your neck. Conjuration magic; maybe a drinking horn. The other thing is a small box. A lot of beautiful, ornate carvings and a complex-looking lock and latch. Conjuration again. Most of the magic seems to be "inside" the box - attached to it somehow.

Riglan says, "Maireagh? Any idea?" - so she examines it. "Never seen anything like this before. It's definitely magical. Linked to some spell of some kind. I can't figure out exactly what! I feel like it requires a spell to activate." At that, Artus checks a ledger. "Hmm... Ah yes! This I bought from some travellers. They said very much the same thing. They'd tried many times to open it, but couldn't figure it out." Riglan suggests it might be more Temo's school of magic? With help of Bless from Riglan, he gets Arcana 23. A memory is jogged. "Leomund's Secret Chest". This is a component. It can used to hide or conjure a much bigger chest that's tucked away in a pocket dimension. We'd need to be able to cast that. Maireagh on hearing the spell name thinks she *can* but doesn't have it "on her"!

Temo looks at the horn. Arcana 22. He quietly says to Riglan, "the horn too."

The horn is quoted at 150gp. The box... He reckons the materials are worth 50gp, the magic perhaps 50gp more. Temo suspects that's under-valued. He looks at the owls too and asks, "Do you sell these individually or would you prefer to keep them together?" He's open to selling individually, but never really thought anyone could buy all five. 100gp each! He's making numbers up on the spot, but Temo figures that the owls being overpriced offsets the magic items being underpriced. Carp might like them, and having his own owl army to go with his totem owl & Riglan's creatures could be fun.

The horn is wrapped. Then he's surprised to hear Temo after the owls too - fetches a box. But there's writing on the box, in an unrecognised language. Temo tries the helm - surprisingly, it takes some time to be legible, as if the helm itself struggles to decode it. It is *not* a language from this world! It says, "**Cannith Creations, Official Toymakers Of Sharn**". Temo removes the helm, says, "Interesting. You were right! Not from here. Your price is fair; don't sell yourself short! 500gp. They do have a box, after all!" and then Temo, almost embarrassed says, "and I think - academic curiosity you understand - the box too, if that's alright with you?" "Well - yes - I mean -" - he stutters, flustered, "- but you've spent so much! Do you want a package deal?!" - and we politely say there's no need. He does give us the address of the house - next to the inn - where Pammy lives.

Temo says, "I wouldn't dare try to bargain these prices down. They're fair. We're not sure about the box but the other two, for sure. So, I think that's - 750gp?" - he's overjoyed. These kinds of sales probably don't happen often. Riglan says, "A fascinating shop - quite risky, to buy things and not be sure what they are, but everything has value to someone, and these have value to us." "Yes! I trust my instincts and my eyes; I think I know the difference between junk and 'interesting' objects. Not necessarily treasures, but I'm fairly good at assessing the age of something. I only buy things that I think are unique or very old."

We thank him and depart. Maireagh has the box of owls and is examining one. "I understand the principles of how these are made, but the materials are unusual - there appear to be notes and things written in the box, I just can't tell what they say". She will borrow the helm later.

The small chest apparently *should* link to a bigger chest. But we don't know what's in that - it could be good, or evil; someone might've hidden something they didn't know how to destroy, for example.

Since we don't know how long we'll be here, we proceed to the house next to the inn. We knock. "Who is it?" "Just some visitors - we were sent here by Artus!". The door opens, and an old lady with a wide toothless grin opens it. "Did Artus send you with a love letter?!"

We head in, conversation flows; we ask about the bowl. She leads us down into a dark room; at a flick of her finger, a lantern illuminates. She is a caster. She finds the bowl - "Artus wouldn't buy it, couldn't afford it, I'm not sure it's safe to eat out of and kind of creepy don't you think?" - she shows it. An antique gold bowl, gems on the outside, but also relief carvings of a woman lying on a slab with a sword hanging above it and two serpents. She then shows us strange other things found in the same place, like damaged, crooked daggers with ornate hilts. Temo (history 18) recognises Yuan-Ti sacrificial markings.

Temo asks Maireagh, "So, the bowl; do you think that would fit the bill for our spell?" - she examines it. "Yes. I think it will. Age alone... No blood residue! And the gems are good."

So, Temo asks about what price she had in mind. She humm's and haa's, unsure, then asks for 650gp. Well, it's technically worth more but it's very specific and given the gory carvings hard to imagine selling otherwise and insight indicates that she doesn't really care about price - just wants it gone. Temo feels bit a bad, but says, "A very fair price." She looks pleased. So he says, "We would love to buy it from you."

She'd like a mix of gold and platinum. "Ah! The taste of independence. No more needing to ask my annoying sum for handouts!"

With that, we are about to bid her goodnight when she asks us to wait, then gives a letter and envelope. "Give this to my darling Artus!" "OK!"

And so - with a rather daft detour across the market square for a somewhat embarrassed Artus! - we head to the Inn next door. (Maireagh wonders what the deal is with two people living so close to each other exchanging notes; Nethza thinks it's quite sweet). The inn is just an inn, no tavern section, nice and quiet; we ask for a room for four, or two-for-two. They've already got one prepared! A "Caravaneer's Room" with four beds. We're told it quietens down in the square by about 10pm. "The night breeze is usually quite nice if you want to have the window open!" - we thank them and head up.

### 8pm

Temo sets to work on cleaning up the horn. He gives Maireagh the Helm so she can read more about the owls. Nethza and Riglan discuss the battle:

- we did win here, but we're not fools; Azalin got what he wanted too
- he learned how this army communicates and it controls wind and light but did little else
- it likes to try crowd control as this is the way for its cavalry to be effective
- its archers are largely useless
- but he didn't see any elves nor did he see us (if he had, he might have pressed the attack far more aggressively!)

Riglan also opines that the death dragon was probably really helped by us! At the end of our chase, when it attacked and killed so many people, we saw the horror of that creature; and yet, we did not avenge them; it was not killed; if anything, we did it a favour, freeing it of Azalin's influence if there was any, and either way, sending it back to its home plane. "Better there than here, of course" he says.

Nethza says, "We don't know much about Azalin's army. Very little about their abilities. We can only guess at their plans. We don't know the extent of his influence. He somehow manages to sink his hooks into places you don't expect." "Like here!" "Yes. Why? Why did he have someone here, and how?"

Riglan figures we should increase use of Nethza's ability to see through illusion and deception. Or use True Seeing. One of us should certainly have that upon them when dealing with the army meetings in the mansion. But also, if we can see some of the lower-level generals under the same influence, it'd help know that any corruption was somewhat further in the chain of command.

**Riglan becomes concerned that Azalin might try to corrupt the flag messengers. What if they were to deliberately "make mistakes" or outright signal different answers? That would be a more subtle way to disrupt communications and harder to detect.**

And another concern. That bridge - gets us to Zhentil. But it means we're funnelled, and badly so. And besides, Azalin's army can march underwater; "if I were him" says Riglan, "I'd just destroy the bridge".

We don't know how long he might stay at Zhentil either.

Oh - and, lest we forget! - there's the small issue of what *our* mission is - to get close enough to Azalin and do enough damage that we can cast our spell to push him back to the Shadowfell prison, *without* killing him outright.**

Too many unknowns. Maireagh suggests asking about Zhentil Keep at least - and maybe Teshwave - since Yulash is a central trading post. So thought it's a bit late, we head out to the tavern (there is no library here, the town far too small!)

### 9pm

Isteval has (thank heavens, else he'd be supremely drunk!) headed to the camp, so the tavern is quieter, but there are still lots of groups sat drinking. Traders, city watch. At the bar, Temo asks the barman who we might talk to. He gets some leads, listens and investigation - 25 - identifies a group who regularly trade North, past Mt Tesh. They talk about "the throat" (the exit of the River Tesh into the Moonsea - a waterfall, in fact) and that they usually go the "bow's shaft", to Teshwave, crossing the river just south of that. We learn that (in their opinion) the Teshwave option is the safer bridge by a distance. Teshwave is inhabited but quite ruined, and quite dangerous. Still preferable to the "haunted ruins of Zhentil Keep!"

Riglan figures that Teshwave might be a good option for the army, except the road from Teshwave to Zhentil Keep on our map isn't a road - at best it's a trail, and not well kept. Zhentil Keep is not exactly a popular destination!

The gorge and span at the bridge at Zhentil, we're told, is quite wide. 40-50ft maybe. It plunges some 20-30ft downwards, quite deep. The waterfall is *before* the bridge, maybe 20ft drop. They've seen the river a little from further up - mostly rapids, 5-10ft drop at the sides. You need to travel a mile up or so to clear the waterfall though; crossing too close would get you swept away. The bridge is all stone, no wood, arches, old construction, very strong; anchored to the sides. Towers, not watchtowers but crumbled towers or perhaps sentinel statues might be part of the anchoring, subsequently made ornamental.

After the bridge there's the ruins of the town before Zhentil Keep itself. It has big 30ft high walls, but the streets are perhaps just as dangerous - old buildings full of shadows! You never know what's lurking. The town is designed around the keep, proximity to the cliff cramming things in, narrow streets. Buildings are quite tall, 20ft high. Lots of blind corners. Good place for an ambush. "Impossible to get an army around!" says one. "A very defensible keep; no assembly ground around it - just closely packed, tall buildings, narrow streets and then a 30ft wall".

On the northern bank, there's the ruined road besides the trail. Potholes and plants growing in it. Wagons *might* be able to pass, at least. The land around is gently sloping and scrubby - an army could march through that probably, a bit slowly, but the wagons etc. might be a problem.

"Teshwave is the new command centre anyway, I believe" says one. "Of what?" "The organisation that used to be based out of Zhentil Keep." "Ah! The Zhentarim. Now I understand why you said I'd need to keep a watch out if I went there."

In the morning, we'll need to try and get all this across to the generals and confer.

We retire to our room. Temo sets up Alarm. We take watches.

* Mairegh 4 (!)
* Nethza (waking up Maireagh!) 12
* Temo (Nethza just about awake) 29
* Riglan 24

The night sky is illuminated occasionally with strange magic, as the mages work to protect the army from scrying as best they can. To both Temo and Riglan, distant campfires and sounds of patrols give an air of vigilance. Mages sometimes throw magical flares up to help them see.



## Day 60
### 7am

We pack up, check out and seek the Cormyrean army generals. They're down in a tent area. We ask if there's a planned meeting before departure, and they think so; a daily briefing in the "main tent" - the small one with the magic manor inside. We head over there and go in. A table of pastries! Temo's eyes light up. Mastica, too. Teas. Riglan has some tea and whispers to Maireagh, "not bad, but not as good as yours". "I wonder if any of these tea leaves will survive me taking them out of here? I think the magic of them is tied to this place. I wonder why we're not hungry when we leave?" Riglan suggests maybe it's all brought in - else yes, surely, we'd be hungry. Maireagh takes a few "for experimental purposes".

People are stood around the breakfast table, chatting. One looks over - "Oh, how was your inn?" Riglan says, "Secure! And a good sleep." "Did you see Sir Isteval?" "Yes, he left around 9pm." "Oh. Nobody has seen him this morning. I wonder if he had a big night..." "It did seem quite big. When you say 'nobody', is he actually missing?" "No, I just think he's sleeping!" "We can fetch him if you like?" "Oh, he'll make his way down here when he's ready. Well... You've seen us in action now. How does that figure into your plans?"

And we get into it. Explaining our new information; but we have no good answers and they need them.

* Why is he going to Zhentil - *is* he?
* How long will he be there?

Maybe we should've attacked him here, while we had the chance. Getting ahead of him now would be very difficult. Blowing up the bridge *before* he gets there might help, but he might just head into the Moonsea and walk around.

We're advised to talk to the War Mages. So, we do. They agree that he might be looking for undead. Maybe other magical artefacts, but we don't know that for sure. They also point out that it's an assumption to think he might be headed there at all!

They draw out a diagram of what is known. Then we need to fill in the blanks; then try to figure out a logical plan - what steps would *we* take in his position - to help us fill those blanks.

So, let's wonder why he left Yulash instead of harvesting it for dead.

* He considered us far too large a threat and we would eliminate him - in which case we must engage him ASAP and destroy him!
* Or there's something much more important to him and it wasn't worth tackling the whole Cormyrean force, even though that would give him a much larger number of bodies to raise.
* So perhaps there's something we're missing. Is there something on the way to where and what, which is more valuable than all these people?
* Or is he afraid to lose something in a confrontation that's caused him to avoid that confrontation? What did he discover when he tested our defence?

Temo, history 19+4, thinks back to all the things we've heard about Azalin. The Oracle saw an army raised at Zhentil, with "our" armies crashing against that to try and eliminate him before he became unassailable. But we also know it was a Zhentarim stronghold; perhaps they recovered artefacts and brought them to new headquarters - Teshwave?

Lots of options discussed. We note that perhaps after all, Azalin lacks currently a way to mass-raise the dead. He might've been intending to use Elven Court for that, but since we used it for Gentle Repose, it became a threat instead of an asset and he moved to destroy it. There might be a powerful magical artefact left behind at Zhentil Keep (possibly since moved by the Zhentarim, of course) or perhaps he needs to have raised enough mages so that they can form a ritual circle and "upcast" magic to levels far beyond anything a single mage could achieve. So divination to ask if there was an artefact to do this getting a conclusive "no" from a good question might help us understand that option (even if there are arising questions about why, if he *could* mass-raise dead, he didn't wait at Cormanthor).

Riglan wonders if he could contact Azalin in a dream - it'd be risky, but at this point, seems necessary - though isn't sure what he'd ask. And besides, he has no magic that would help him force that to happen.

An impasse it seems. Riglan can at least try Divination, thinking of his question. After some discussion with the party it is refined as far as:

* Where nearby - for example at Zhentil Keep or Teshwave, at that kind of range - exists a magical artefact of great power which would allow someone to raise the dead in large numbers swiftly?

...Oh, the hells - too many revisions and options; Riglan just does it. He finds a space and starts (by ritual) to set up, then, eventually, the spell triggers... D20+spell-casting-mod, 18+5->23.

The spell goes quiet for a while. Smoke hangs in the air. Finally. It starts to give an answer - but then stops. Was that - maybe - Elven Court? But it is gone in an instant. This happens again. And again... Different locations he doesn't recognise. Then there's an impression... **There is nowhere**; but then a location is shown. An old temple. Crumbled, ruins, partly submerged in the sand, surrounded by mountains with deep ridged faces. **The Scimitar Spires and temples behind the Shadow Sea**.

Riglan sits quietly for a while and then tells the war mages. Circle it is; there is no artefact to raise the dead nearby. But we understand more about why Azalin is heading towards the Anauroch and might become unstoppable there. The War Mages said that the ritual casting in a Circle takes (they think) - very guesstimate! - at least 1 day to complete (undead casters might be able to cast for much longer as they don't need food, drink or sleep), but the artefact would solve that and mean losses of his generals are not so critical to his army.

Until then, however, they are.

The generals were thrown at us early on. Later, the dragon. Then we killed the dragon. Now, he tests Cormyr with lesser forces. He's been pushing forward, rushing almost; this is perhaps why Zhentil matters - as difficult as it is to assault for us, it is safe for him. It *is* all about raising the dead, but he can't afford to lose chunks of his army else he might lose the ability to mass-raise.

Lady Ushien arrives, looking for us. "When do we ride?" Riglan looks crestfallen! "I don't know." "But we defeated their forces yesterday! We must keep up the moment of our victory."

Ushien's forces are all paladins. Riglan thinks back to the Oracle. "The fourth vision has you at the head of an army with paladins riding across the bridge at the edge of the Moon Sea, to face him and his forces at Zhentil Keep with the amassed might of the Zhentarim around him."

Riglan explains that it was really just a test. She says, "But when your opponent is playing conservatively because they are afraid of losing resources, we have a tactical advantage..."

* We know it's going to take us 5 days to get there
* That means it'll take him 5/3
* And he's got a ~12 hour head start
* And the casting he's doing might only be for a day!

Further:

* If they rest beforehand, the mages could cast high level spells to get the army across the river but then they can't assist with anything else (transportation via arcane gates).
* Maximum range between the entry and exit gates is 500ft and you must be able to see the exit location.

Alternative:

* They hypothesising that if the Oracle saw a particular vision of the future - us leading an army - then Azalin could well have seen that too
* They can make illusions to have it appear as if the army is indeed going that way but really it is crossing the river a point maybe a day's ride away (they just need to rest in between)
* He'd have to be drawn out of the keep to get close enough to True See through the illusion and we can have real people in the front (Ushien's people - but they'd have to know and accept the risk)

It's all we've got and it's likely it's all we'll have. Given our strong belief of a time factor related to this casting, we need to get moving.

* Azalin will be at Zhentil within a day
* We won't be there until between 5 and 6 days
* If his casting takes less than 4-5 days, he'll be gone when we get there, but we'll encounter him north of the river
* If his casting takes less than 3-4 days, he'll be gone and we we'll have missed him entirely north the river

Since there is nothing we can do about that, **we ask to get the army moving on the "cross by river / arcane gate" plan. We can break off near the river to get to the road and lead Ushien's crew over the bridge with an illusion behind us. Tempt Azalin out. We can message the elves to let them know what we're doing, without knowing ourselves, so if our forces are compromised, it doesn't compromise them.**

We will travel for them for a few days. They'll create a spell scroll for us to create the illusion.

Riglan - and he looks to Temo and sees the same look, he thinks - feels a sudden rush of fear, excitement, uncertainty; momentarily almost overwhelming. Riglan thinks to himself:

*This is it, then. For real. The die is cast...*

...and at that same moment, Temo says to him, "So, this is it, then? For real?"

A general asks; "I hope you're all rested. The army is and we'll be doing forced marches." "Sounds good to me!" "12 hours a day" "...Sounds less good but we'll keep up."

We head out.

Riglan remembers as we exit the tent that we were going to look for better maps in town. He heads up, thinking he might ask the traders, but they don't use maps. They hand down information from generation to generation. Riglan insight, 20+10->30 - he realises he's kinda asking the wrong questions. The traders can give detailed, colourful information about areas he might ask them about - e.g. the path on the far side of the river. But the point is, there's *detail*. Our map is akin to a Sword Coast map with Waterdeep and Neverwinter but nothing in between. They know about all kinds of things, like ancient Barrows, that should be avoided - they predate the Dales. "It looks like it used to be something much larger that's submerged - you can see the tops of archways with large runes on them, several of them arranged in a circle with a big one in the middle that looks like a hill". That's along the road (the coast side - East side - of the road on about the third day of travel). There's the "ruined old tower" where some people claim lights have come from the top! It's surrounded by woods, up on a hill. They give a few locations, which we note down, and we'll share once underway with scouts and leaders, but also keep our eyes peeled for. Maybe we go check out the Barrows on the third day!

Temo messages Ilsevele. "Cormyr marches to cross river. We cross at Zhentil Bridge. Azalin reaches there, 1 day. Ritual cast to raise dead. Our ETA 4-5 days." There is a reply this time. "**Plan well underway. We have it all in hand. We will see you there. Look after yourselves and watch by the light of the moon.**"

The usual pack up; many thanks and goodbyes to the villagers (and apologies for the damaged fields).

The army moves out.

As we start, Riglan muses on the information from the traders. "Barrows. Undead... If we got there first, we could try Gentle Repose, at least on a small scale. What if there are any powerful creatures buried there? It sounded like a significant site after all." He confers with Ushien, asking if she has anyone who could cast such a spell - potentially a few times, but at least once - if we were to get them to the site. She knows a cleric would be able to, or maybe wizards. So, Temo starts investigating within the army (26). One of the camp priests could do it. Can the army spare them? We could get there and back within a day.

The cleric's name is **Gurmukh**. We thank him in advance, warn him it might be dangerous if Azalin is nearby but hopefully not - we'll be able to see as clouds - Ushien says she wants to come too, with her squire. We don't argue! We pull our group and the other two off to the side so we're not in the way of the army and Riglan starts to cast Wind Walk, after explaining how we do it (the colours of the clouds of the four of us, and if one of the main party dives off, follow them - they've seen something).

We start to fly at great speed along the road, above it but off to the side; we are soon far ahead of the Cormyrean army. Riglan, perception 19; he hopes that we might see Azalin's forces, confirming their destination. Surveying the countryside as he goes, Riglan spots Azalin's army - headed off course, Northwards but towards the coast; he fears, perhaps, veering towards the barrows but a while off yet. They're well ahead, of course, of the Cormyreans too; about two days standard ride ahead, if not more, already - and gaining every night.

Riglan hopes Ushien is watching closely - the cleric too!

Stealth adv all round - generally low all round:

* Dog 20
* Temo 26 (by RT - rolls a 3 and 3)
* Maireagh 13
* Nethza 10
* Riglan 15
* Gurmukh 10
* Ushien 10
* Squire 16

Fortunately, Azalin's group don't seem to spot us (roll and 3, 4 on perception). Riglan meanwhile notices that the army seems split. A main body containing Azalin trails behind a little. It is in a kind of "shield" shaped configuration, a diffused trailing edge. The second group of only some 50 or so individuals, all on horseback, are riding ahead. They're already a few miles ahead. It's easy to recognise one of the generals from the headdress - this group is intending to raise the dead.

We press on at best possible speed. Survival, Riglan, 13+10->23. A structure, clearly unnatural, about six miles ahead of the vanguard - very close! He thinks they will reach it in around an hour, worst case? Riglan leads the clouds down to the area.

These so-called "barrows" are very unusual. They're surrounded by low trees, almost just large bushes. In the middle is a ring of stones. There's a big one that stands out; it leans, as if toppled, with a rain shadow underneath; the whole area is covered in runes. They are in giant! Riglan brings the group into the rain shadow and we start to turn into our normal form. Over the minute, he gets to study the rock; it's deliberately set, not toppled. The runes tell a story, in a kind of poem.

* This area is a (very old) burial ground
* There is the story of **"The Dreaming"** - these are (were) stone giants
* We've heard about this before; the kind of fantasy world the giants sought as their own real world selves became diminished and endangered
* The tilting stone represents a thumb of the "hand of the dreamer"
* The other four are tips of fingers - as if the hand reaches up, out of the ground
* The area has been submerged by the ground itself, engulfed

Riglan, history 19+5->24. Interesting... **This is the burial place of seers.** Stone giant seers, the most respected of their kind. Five separate "head seers", the most revered of the most respected of their kind - each one from five consecutive generations - are buried here, each one under a stone. They are tombstones. The poetry that is written alludes to the fact that there are doorways, passageways, down to the mausoleum where they are interred. But that must be *huge*.

By now we're formed up, and everyone's patiently watching Riglan study the stone. Maireagh says, "Oh, Dwarven runes!" and Riglan says, "Well, stone giant - same origins". "So these are not natural?" "Not at all!" and he explains. The weathering indicates great age, points out Maireagh.

Riglan asks Gurmukh how often he could cast Gentle Repose, especially on a giant! The size doesn't matter, but he could call upon his god up to eight times, he thinks, before he became exhausted.

We need to find an entrance. Maireagh figures it must be buried under here somewhere... Riglan tries talking to the surrounding bushes/trees, to see if their roots feel any gaps or obstructions that might help narrow it down. The trees say that there's a deep hollow beyond the reach of their roots in the middle.

So that's *big*. At least 60ft down, maybe more - giant scale, after all.

Riglan can change into a cave badger. He can burrow. If he can find the path, he can come back up to find Marieagh as she can help make it easier to get in.

Riglan starts in the middle, then burrows. He follows a kind of lazy corkscrew so it's not just a vertical shaft. Via Tremorsense (60ft), he tries to get a feel for the right pathway to the entrance. Perception via cave badger, lucky roll; 16+10->26. Stone, hollow centres. Entrances must be somewhere within the compound. He finds it! It's underneath the overhang - in the "rain shadow", as if the "thumb" was pointing the way. An archway, slightly caved in with earth, but underneath is a corridor and stairs leading down.

He heads back out his existing tunnel and finds Maireagh. She tells him to stay in badger form. "I can only hold this for a short amount of time, so you need to be fast. You have a minute to make this tunnel large enough for us to walk through" - and she casts Enlarge Reduce!

Riglan sets to work. A single, gentle curve albeit steep, starting under the thumb and arcing around until reaching the entrance underneath that starting point. The others follow. The doorway is huge - Riglan stays in badger from for now. There's plenty of room thanks to giant scale stuff. He scurries along. This time, Tremorsense not so good - 13 total perception. A cavern feel to this; nothing's totally blocked off. The cleric already has Light up, so Riglan turns back into himself and lights his own thing. He warns everyone that this place might be protected or just generally haunted, so we must keep our wits about us.

Temo (with goggles on) investigates. 25. He figures there's a central area - the traders thought as much - so we carry on down. He finds giant stairs, that help us get lower relatively quickly - fortunately, earth that's flowed through hear over countless years and rain helps form ramps between some of them. We rush - we know we're on the clock and it's been a while already.

We enter a domed central area. Even the light spell from the cleric can't fully illuminate it.

Five sarcophogai stand, slightly leant back, in a circle. The floor seems to have an ornate, intricate mosaic pattern. Scenes. Along the walls, more scenes. All kinds of stuff! Sceneries; mountains erupting; battles between dragons and giants; a huge flood; trees - treants - rising in battle. Riglan remarks to Maireagh that if we make it through all this alive and this place hasn't been destroyed, we should come back to study it.

There's a ceiling fresco, part of the ceiling cracked with earth poured through, but we can't see it clearly given the range of light. The priest says that if he could get up there, he could light it... Nethza sees that the priest uses his shield for light, so she can fly it up there - and does so. A scene from giant mythology - Riglan was told stories about this by his parents! **An all-powerful deity, creator of the giants, Annam The Allfather**. A female giant, sat to his right - probably **Dian Castra**, his daughter; a stone giant to his left; eyes closed, but a third eye open in its huge, bulbous forehead - the first of the visionaries; the way that stone giants can see into the past and future, by tapping into The Dreaming.

"Those who are the most powerful in the dreaming", say runes, "lie here, waiting for the call, when stone giants have proven their worthiness to The Allfather who will return to this realm. Until then, it is up to the stone giants to hold onto the faith and the imagination and the hope of his return."

Riglan wonders if these creatures are spiritually alive somehow; could they be contacted, to get in touch with Azalin.

The priest points out that he needs to *touch* the dead to cast Gentle Repose (the elves mass-casting did it via the trees and micelial network).

Riglan does not want to desecrate here. But we need to open the sarcophagi. Temo has a look; religion 19. He can see arcane seals on each of the five. They can't be opened physically - they must be "activated" somehow. It seems that the tale is one of opening when "the time is right". When the Allfather has come back to call upon them in a time of need.

There must be some other way?! 

Temo stands in them middle of the chamber, since the magic seems to flow here. He points that out and Riglan comes over and sets his staff dead centre. Perception nat 1+10->11, sadly; a confusing room. He agrees with Temo; it does look like this stuff is all linked somehow... Insight 5+10->15 - well Temo's definitely onto something. The pattern of things. The layout. Temo investigation via RT 25, which is actually not quite enough but he does now see under earth and rubble in the centre, a loose plate - a loose circle, with a sun mosaic on it. 3ft in diameter, quite big. Nethza tries to help by giving Riglan True Sight; perception only 3+10->13; he can sense a connection to the ethereal plane here. Something is required to activate a dormant connection; a veil, like something is turned off.

He uses the staff to see if he can pry up the plate; he's able to lift it up with help from Maireagh. Underneath is just a hole, stone, the plate belongs in the hole! We place the plate temporarily to the side on the floor. We look at the disc's underside. A crescent moon. We place the plate back, moon side-up to see what happens. Dex save! Riglan 3+0. Temo, 4+11->15; Maireagh and Nethza 19 each. Riglan falls onto his butt as the ground starts to shake and raises up! Some 18ft long, 5ft wide; it looks like a bed! The moon is right in the middle. "The dreaming!" says Riglan. He gets up on the bed and lies down, staff in hand.

He sees threads from the Ethereal start to connect with the disc. The runes telling stories around the room "lift out" visually, moving into the Ethereal plane; they swirl around him; he feels groggy; he could sleep. Riglan says, "I'm going to sleep but wake me up if it's been more than a few minutes!" - and he chooses to fail against the effect; he succumbs and sleeps.

The rest of the party see Riglan climb up, mumble about going to sleep and start snoring!

Riglan enters into a dream. This is an unusual one. There is no shift of place. He is still lying on the "bed", conscious of everything around him, but colours kind of 'fade', lower saturation yet at the same time, the room around becomes pristine - brand new - not ruined. Instead of five sarcophagi, there are five stone daises. Upon each sits a stone giant, cross-legged. One has a gourd, one has a staff, one holds large discs carved out of stone, one holds a long feathered kind of stick, one holds stone tablets. They look up at Riglan. The one holding the staff says, "Dreamer. Why have you come to rouse us?"

Riglan answers, "I am sorry to disturb your slumber. The Allfather has not yet returned..."

"We know, we have waited a long time for him. Clearly he is still displeased with the actions of our brothers and sisters. But it is our duty to wait for his return."

Another says, "If he has not returned, what is it that you are here for? Are you here for mistake, little one?"

Riglan says, "No mistake. I bring sad news; a terrible evil approaches, which has the ability to raise the dead, in a slave form, unable to resist serving the evil master."

"That is forbidden magic. Who would wield such magic in these realms? Surely the cloud giants who rule the lands above would not stand for such perversion of the natural order. Is this the action of dragons?"

"I wish it were; that might be easier to tackle. The cloud giants are... Diminished. Busy elsewhere. This creature is left to us smaller folk. He goes only by the title of 'Azalin Rex', or 'Wizard King', and has great evil, great intelligence, patience, cunning and magic."

The giant with the feather stick says, "That will not do! We must not be disturbed. If we are raised before the time, we doom our kind. We alone hold the stories that can lead all of giant kind back to His arms. We must not be awoken before it is time. Little one, can you stop him?"

Riglan says, "I cannot stop his approach, but we can block his magic for around ten days, and we believe he will not wait, and will move on, leaving you in peace; but I'm afraid to say that to do this, we need to make contact with your physical form."

"We can open our sleeping chambers - our caskets."

"Can you close them after?"

"Yes - I require you to physically close them, but *we* can then seal them."

"Do you trust me?"

There is a pause, when another speaks; "I can only trust that which I know. What is it that I am trusting you for?"

"Trusting that this evil is what I say. That the magic to be used will work as I say, and that my request for physical access is for your protection and not for my personal gain."

"We know you are telling the truth. We can see it."

"I am distantly related to you..."

"We know. You carry distant traces of giant blood in you. What is the nature of your dream? Where does your dream take you? What do you see?"

This is kind of a purpose question. "In the widest sense, the preservation of the natural world and natural order; all creatures in balance. In the current crisis, a way - at no doubt great risk - to walk the dreams of that evil creature of which I spoke, who himself has some abilities such as ours. This, we think, is why he seeks you in particular."

"You seek to protect the earth. Do you seek to protect the world of the dreaming?"

Riglan has to think about that for a while. "I never thought I would have to - but Azalin's incursions suggest that - yes, I must."

"Then we will give you a tool. Something that might be helpful if your paths and ours are aligned when the time comes. If you can be our eyes and ears while we sleep under the ground - if you tell us that our mighty brothers, the cloud giants, have diminished; things are afoot that we are not aware of us; we must remain asleep, we cannot interfere with the world above. You will know what to do with it."

Riglan takes a while to figure that out - they're saying, "protect the dreaming until everyone can be led through it" - so he says, very certain of his words - **"I would be very much honoured to be trusted with such a task."**

"Then we will call you **Venn**" (Giant for Friend).

"Thank you. Likewise...!"

The five step off their daises and place hands (gently!) on his chest. "Wake now little one, and defend us!"

Riglan wakes up, a very heavy weight on his chest - the others see, materialising out of the material plane, a warhammer, looks like a judge's gavel but giant size, lying on Riglan's chest. He gets the sense that he must bring this to each of the sarcophagi to open it (because he is a friend). The gavel is inscribed with a single rune, for 'Venn'.

Riglan says simply, "I'll explain later" and gets off the "bed". The moon centre kind of shimmers and fades, raises up, flips over, the bed recedes and it's just a plate again, with a sun on it. Riglan looks at the priest. Very hard stare. "You're sure you can this and it will work?" "I am certain." "Very well. Be aware, there is considerable trust in what we do now."

He walks to the nearest sarcophagus with the "gavel". He doesn't have to do anything. The rune on the gave lights up, the arcane seal lights up, the lid of the sarcophagus releases and can be opened. It takes Riglan, Maireagh and Ushien all together to pull it open...

...oh my. Inside, the embalmed body of a stone giant - *not* decayed. This one holds a long feathered stick. Riglan says to the group, "These people are special and important. They are not dead, they just wait. But their physical form could be corrupted by Azalin. Gurmukh, please cast your spell.

Gurmukh says, "Yes, I see. These bodies are certainly dead - they have been embalmed - but there is more going on here; something magical; I think they could be awoken, but not if they were turned to undead!"

The priest casts. We then push shut the sarcophagus, and the seal reasserts.

It takes 15-20 minutes to get all this done for all five. At the end of it all, Riglan says, "we might well find ourselves in a spot of bother up top..."

Nethza says, "Well, I feel like we maybe owe it to them to make it harder to get in here! Can we collapse the tunnel after us? Then all I need is a minute to get us away. I can do that from down here."

Riglan and Maireagh run up, fast as they can - takes a while up the giant floors - and up at the top, Riglan casts Plant Growth to hide the tunnel - the whole centre becomes overgrown. Then he turns back into a cave badger, Maireagh makes him big (and beats a hasty retreat!) as Riglan hurriedly starts collapsing the tunnel around him, moving backwards. We emerge back in the room below covered in soil!

**The Gavel Of The Venn Rune** is large; Riglan places it in the bag of holding for now.

Nethza is ready. Just before we step through the teleportation circle, Riglan hears - "Thank you, little friend" in Giant, from the Ethereal. He has no means to answer and steps through the circle...

...and find ourselves all wrapped up in each other's limbs, covered in tent fabric and feeling bumps of a wagon rolling along the road. Ah. The runes lead *into* a tent. But the tent is packed up on wagon!

There are surprised gasps; we struggle loose, takes a while, the wagon slowing down as it's got much heavier and causing disruption behind. As quickly as we can, we get back onto our feet - seven people and a metal dog emerging from a packed tent on a wagon. Quite the sight.

Once we're making our way back up towards the front of the army so Ushien can rejoin her group etc., Riglan explains what happens. It affected him personally a bit, to feel that connection with his history, but also the melancholy of it - waiting for something that can't happen. He's not sure what it means for his dreams, or what he has to do, if anything, to "protect" the dreaming. **How can he protect it, if Azalin is alive? Azalin used it from the Shadowfell.** We'd need to destroy the phylactory... Phylactories.

We need to cut him off from the dreaming. Wonder how. We're fairly sure that this is how he "breaks the rules" of the Shadowfell. Riglan suggests to Nethza that if she's ever contact by the raven queen or those forces, it's something to mention and ask about. We have maybe a day or two at most before we expect to be in combat with Azalin. There's no time, to say the least, for research.

Temo CHA save. 16+5+5-from-Ushien's-aura. 26. He sense a message being sent. Not friendly. Azalin, for sure. He "takes the call".

**"I know it was you. If you do not stop interfering, this will become personal! I will personally seek out and destroy you and everything you love. You have become quite annoying."**

(More than 25 words, because of course he can).

Temo answers; "You made it personal when you first got involved with Nethza. I welcome meeting you in combat."

Another message! Goading is working... **"Insolent fool! I will crush you and your army like grains of sand against the waves. You will be forgotten, like tears shed in the rain."**

Temo doesn't answer that, but tells the group. "He's pissed off... We have his attention. What do we do with it, and how do we slow him down? Draw him to the side?"

Ushien asks what we thought his plans were. 

* Whatever else, he was quite happy to desecrate the "barrows" - but then, the giants there did describe his magic as forbidden and would've expected the giants to stop him.
* We do recall stone giants in one of the four visions the oracle showed us for people who might help if all else failed.
* As the war mages helped us realise, we don't know for sure if raised creatures retain their abilities; and the magical not-quite-dead aspect of these seers muddies the waters; but it is surely inconceivable that he'd raise them just as giant skeletons with no other powers, when they specifically are able to see into past and present via the Dreaming, which is how Azalin escaped the Shadowfell.

So it would seem important. Whatever he wanted them for - seeing the future is useful, but seeing is unreliable, visions can be misinterpreted and he's almost powerful enough to not need that help. Dreamwalking on the other hand can help him across other realms, so perhaps he has designs beyond this plane.

However, if he hasn't stopped to wait ten days, then whatever he plans at Zhentil is **more important than any of that**. The mass-casting, we suspect, of raising the dead for all the bodies in that area is worth more to him than anything else at this time. He can always come back for the seers later.

He seems to be prioritising army size, so that he can assure his ability to reach the Anauroch, to get the artefacts that make him unbeatable.

Temo's been quiet, then says, "Will he send people after Qelline and Carp?"

An uncomfortable silence.

Maireagh says, "How would he know where they are?"

"He knew where *we* were."

"How would he know about them?"

"Dreams..."

Riglan shrugs and says, "We are still, I think, not yet important enough. But you shouldn't goad him more - I think he'll probably be happy enough to come for us when the opportunity arises. We just have to be ready ourselves."

Maireagh says, "It feels like we've been promoted from 'annoying' to 'possible threat'. How much will he put up with before he decides to just destroy us?".

Riglan answers; "Yeah, seems so; we kinda wanted that, but we're on a thin line, if he came at us right now, we'd be killed. But he can't risk the generals yet."

Temo, sending, L3, Ilsevele. "Azalin will mass-cast a raise dead spell using a circle of mages at Zhentil. ETA within a day. Casting time known" - just so she knows what's going on - then follows up with, "He must be stopped, but this is the opportunity for us all - he will be distracted." A reply. "All roads still lead to Zhentil Keep. We are crossing the Moonsea and will meet you in the siege."

Force march... CON checks. Two must be passed. Ushien's aura, the purple knights, paladins - all spread across the ranks to "rally the troops", helping magically; +5 to all rolls.

* Riglan 26, 13 (OK)
* Temo 26 also (!), 22
* Nethza 16, 23
* Maireagh 18, 24

First and second hour - we're all OK, but on the 11th hour of marching the army decides to stop (DM roll). Too many people were getting exhausted. Camp starts to be established. It's late.

We learn that the scouts thing there are two more days of forced marching to reach the river crossing point above the bridge.

That night, stay with the army. The generals gather for (a late) dinner as usual. We bring them up to speed on what happened and what we think that means for his prioritise. They ask if we should double watch; might he attack us? Azalin's army is single-minded, and about two days ahead, so we think not. At that mention of "two days", a couple of generals look surprised, check some numbers and say that he's *not* marching 24 hours a day - else they'd be further ahead. We don't know if that's a one-off but they think he's slower than he should be, or the army moves slower than the Cormyreans (that's possible too, it always looks cumbersome to us and that would explain his persistent penchant for using vanguards).

Otherwise; plan unchanged.

That night, we go on watch in regular tents. If he *does* try to attack we want to attract him to us, not the army. We don't want their death on our hands. We set up camp on the fringes. The dog assists watch with it usual diligence and patrolling.

* Maireagh (low)
* Nethza (low) - both tired
* Temo perception 28
* Riglan perception 23

Other than the usual sounds of things in the wild and the unfamiliar sounds from the army, everything seems OK.

After his watch, Temo sleeps. Temo WIS save. Despite luck point, (4,2)+6->10.

He's worried about Qelline and Carp. And he's worried about dreaming about them - so of course, he does. They're in Baldur's Gate, but bandits stalk the alleyways and they are at the windows; Qelline and Carp are in peril.

He hears a voice speaking to him... Azalin's voice. "Ah! A weakness. A vulnerability. These are people you care about. Somewhere... Somewhere in this city. And who exactly are these two? Family? Loved ones? Children?" Temo answers, "They owe me money - the bandits seeks to recover it, at my command." Deception 17+5->22! "I see. So this Lord Smoothhands - not as alturistic as the legends that the commonfolk were spinning about him. Of course. Money. Everyone has a weakness for wealth." Temo says, "I was poor once. I had to steal to make my way. Got into trouble with the law. Now I have wealth of my own - and I'm not going to let other people steal it from me." Azalin answers, "You and I are not so different! I, too, was not born into power. I was born into a low caste. My gifts were not recognised, not acknowledged; not even permitted. They would keep me in my place. But you see, we both rise above our station. I can make your wildest dreams come true! I have the power to do that. You know I do. And soon, I will gain the power to make all things a reality. The power to *literally* make dreams come true. Perhaps there is an arrangement that we can come to, rather than antagonise, we could cooperate? There would be much benefit for you in doing so." Temo says, "But surely, there is too much risk - the army will be at the bridge to Zhentil before you have finished raising the dead there, and you will be in danger." He's fishing! How long does it take?! Persuasion 25. Azalin's response is, "Oh, the army? The Cormyrean army? I have seen this army. It is a house of cards. It will not take much to throw it into disarray. They rely too much on a chain of command. They are no threat to me. I am not without my defenders! Zhentil Keep has never fallen. Abandoned, yes, but fallen to invaders? No. Besides... I will defend that bridge and the walls personally! You could be on the right side of those walls. You just have to do a little thing for me..." Temo answers, "I do not crave death! What thing would I need to do?" Azalin pulls out a small creature; all shadow and toxicity; he toys with it in his hand. "This can follow you out of your dream. I merely need you do place it in the camp's water supply." Temo says, "So I will be able to hold it and stealthily make my way there with this creature physically?" "Yes! When you wake, put it in a vial. Any vial. Anything that you can hide from the light. Pour it into the camp's water supply. It will do its work. By the time they reach the bridge, they won't even know what is and isn't real." Temo says, "Send your creature. I think you will be surprised by the results." He hands Temo the creature. "And what did you wish granted? Power? Love? Wealth? Control? A kingdom? Or eternal life?" Temo says, "Power. With power, I can achieve all those other things, given enough time." Deception 21. Azalin looks at him; his eyes flare; he pulls the creature back; **"You lying filthy scum! Wasting my time! It matters not. I will achieve my ends and you will pay the price!"**


## Day 61
### 7am

Temo wakes with a yelp, startling Riglan who's on watch! He gives as much detail as he can.

* The key was that Azalin will defend the bridge personally; that the thinks the army is too reliant on a disruptable chain of command
* The fact he didn't bite on the fishing check for the spellcasting time, *does kind of* imply that he expects to encounter this army before completion, but doesn't think it is a threat because he has another plan. And that plan involves something *else* Zhentil that we don't know about, probably.
* Also, he might try and get someone *else* to pollute the water, so we'd better warn about that and make sure there's purification going on before people drink.

We check the water ourselves. Perception 19, detect magic on; not the pool. What?! A war mage. Looking shifty! Walking towards the water supply... Satchel in hand. It emanates a very dark necrotic magic. How do we capture a war mage?! No other war mages nearby. Temo tries Hold Person - WIS17 saving - and *it works*. He's quite surprised. "Can anyone cast Silence?!" he asks so Riglan just runs up and covers his mouth. Muffled protests! Temo calls for help; "it's not his fault, it's Azalin, check the satchel, be very careful, don't let it get into sunlight or you'll destroy the evidence..." - a knight comes up, and *he* can feel the evil too. We need to get the knight, the war mage and our party into the general's tent. Riglan ties the war mage's hands, ties a gag, apologising the whole time, then we "escort" the war mage with knight carrying the satchel to the general's tent.

The head war mage is outraged. Temo hastily explains. "Quite an accusation against one of the war mages who has come all this way!" - Temo persuasion 25 (RT). Sir Isteval weighs in; "This is quite - this is an unusual situation! - everyone needs to keep a level head!" Ushien says, "Well, there's one thing, if we're all in agreement" - and casts Zone Of Truth - "we can step into the Zone Of Truth".

Temo steps in and repeats his story. Points out that there's an evil thing in the satchel but sunlight would destroy it. The mage is pushed in next; gag is removed - the head war mage here can counterspell if need be; he's forced to tell the truth.

"You don't understand. My brother - he is dying - he has a wasting diseases. There's nothing the healers or clerics can do but slow it down. Azalin has promised that he can save him - not just save him - but grant him an extended life. He asked that I place this spell of confusion into the water, just to slow the army down... Just to slow them down! To perhaps wait a day or two. It wouldn't kill anyone!"

(That's worth knowing).

Temo explains - maybe the potion is just confusion; Azalin said something similar, but the implication was that the spell lasts a lot longer. And he deals only in death - the brother promise was probably false in some way. The decision is that this is war mage is "compromised"; he is to be teleported back home to be with his brother. It's a merciful act and one of understanding, but Temo does say, "This is wise, but surely, in one way or another, *most* of us have *some* kind of compromise. Loved ones, desires, whatever it is. Azalin just needs to find the right levers." "Then we must speak to the troops. Explain this is what is happening - that they will be tempted. They need to understand the nature of the threat they face."

This is certainly a good idea. It's agreed - and - no time like the present. "It's time to address the army as a whole anyway. We have not done so since leaving Yulash. We need spirits high; we need everyone on our side." In practice, this means sending out the gist of a message to various commanders as it gets passed down - they don't have some (say) magical means to have one person address all ~8000 in the army at once!

Riglan, while this is happening, has a notion that we'd like to be sure where Azalin is now at. He's past the barrows, or is he waiting? So, having remembered his scrying spell that morning, he tries to scry for one of the ogre "throne bearers" around Azalin, in case maybe they're not shielded like he is. Amounts to a DC20 WIS save for the ogre, +5 as Riglan doesn't know them, -2 since Riglan's seen at least one via the "eye pendant" the corrupted councillor held.

It works. The scrying position is balanced in front of the ogre, high up but shielded by its body, lest Azalin - who apparently can "see" all manner of things - might detect it.

It takes a while for Riglan to get his bearings. Lots of shuffling, grunting, growling sounds. Occasionally there are high pitched shrieks or screeches. The decaying body of another ogre off to one side. Around elsewhere, the shoulders and heads of skeletons, zombies and undead; unusual garb. The ogre makes kind of squelching sounds as it moves. It isn't even carrying anything now - no plinth or dais; it just lumbers along. Perception disadv., 12,1+10->11, sigh. Messy. A jumble. Takes a while to get a sense of what he sees in this sea of bodies. Here and there are more obvious taller figures, especially those on horseback. He can't see behind the ogre so doesn't know if he's in the middle of the army or at the back, but interestingly, he can't really see the army's edge - it certainly stretches forwards a long way.

But where are we? The army isn't stationary, so probably not waiting at the barrows - Survival 17+10->27 - certainly no sign of them. It's been a full night of travel for this army (give or take) but there *is* a tower off to the left, which is perhaps the old 'abandoned' tower of which we were told by the traders, on land which is gently rising. The army seems to aim to the right of this tower, rather than towards it. Far ahead, there are a couple of hills; one in particular with an old, ruined fort towards the right. Most other things are obscured by the army in front and around.

Another disadv perception, only 4+10->14. Some of the horseback creatures are moving faster, making their way through the army. There is a shifting in the pattern of what people are doing - something is afoot, perhaps? Some of the army moves left and right, rearranging. Perhaps a group splits to the left? This ogre stays with the main group. For as long as the spell lasts, Riglan observes. DM-requested D20->19. As this pattern starts to change, Riglan hears something - words he's not heard before - a language unknown. It has a strange, melodic, fluid complexity. Could even be arcane. One of the generals turns to look at someone to "Riglan's" right and says something in return in a raspy death rattle sort of voice. Then they start to ride, through the army, pushing through, heading to the left. **The tower, surely, is its goal**. A few go with it - taller, hunched; gnolls maybe? **We are surely hours away, even by wind walk.** This might be a plan we can't disturb. The voice sounds again, right next to the ogre; a huge warhorse is riding past, barding made of flat pieces of bone in a kind of armour, the horse itself rotting; upon it, immediately recognisable but never before seen so close - **Azalin Rex**. Long, purplish-yellow robes, a strapped-on breastplate beneath, huge headdress in a kind of crown, flaring out, looking perhaps like a kind of ancient animal's scull. Triceratops might be close to the mark. The melodic, complex speech comes from him. He goes faster than the ogre walks and passes in front, close by. He stops accelerating some 15ft in front, then rides at army pace again.

The spell fades as Riglan sees the splinter group heading off to the left.

Once he's back to his own sense, Riglan warns his party that something is afoot with the tower we learned about, but we can't get there quickly; fastest we have is Wind Walk, surely an order of an hour or two. The traders had called it roughly a day's ride from barrows to tower, and it took us about 2-3 hours to get there from Yulash (roughly) but we did force-march an extra few hours. It could be closer than we think.

The army will start to move off-road now, heading for the river. Ushien's group and anyone else that's joining us on the bridge will stay on road. We will meet them there. Riglan makes a snap decision to Wind Walk to the tower immediately; he judges it roughly direct North from where we are.

We hastily find people to tell them what we're doing. We learn that a group of some 100 people including Ushien ultimately carry on along the road - avoids them being easily picked off en route. Two war mages are amongst them, to help with the illusions. They might, once they think their task is finished, split off again and get back to the main army. The others will continue their forced march, hoping to get over the river and rest (to restore magic) before heading towards the Keep.

Riglan casts Wind Walk. A minute later, the five of us are flying. Riglan, Perception 21. In the air, it doesn't take long to spot, far away, the tower; could be as little as 20 miles; **we can get there in maybe only just over half an hour!** That's much faster than expected, but he hopes everyone else in the party realises there might still be a chunk of Azalin's army there when we arrive. And we have to "materialise" somewhere.

As we get closer, we see the vanguard has still not arrived. Riglan misjudged somewhat the distance from the scryed ogre to the tower - the army must've been a fair bit further East. This is a stroke of luck. The army was heading North West, direct to Zhentil, from their diversion to the barrows; it makes sense - they weren't no the road (he couldn't see the front edge of the army). That slows them a bit too.

**We might have some 15 minutes at most between arriving and the army reaching the tower.**

He flies in and leads everyone down to the tower base on the West wall, so the tower hides us on approach from the army as best it can and we get to materialise there hoping that nothing from the tower comes to attack.

Close up - it's 4 storey. The top two floors are only half intact, half fully crumbled away. The bottom two clearly have debris piled up, blocking windows; the floors inside must have caved in either completely or in part. More interesting though is the area all around - overgrown, but remnants of some kind of pattern or structure, **like a maze** or ornamental garden. Toppled statues, some standing still, dead trees. Clearly something happened here that caused some devastation - the dead trees are a key. And Azalin's interest implies some presence of undead or otherwise powerful force.

There seem to be two landing spots. Directly on the opposite side from the vanguard as Riglan originally planned, or on the more northern side where it's more crumbled. The crumbled side might provide better access or places to hide, but it'd require a degree of rock climbing to climb up - doable but tricky. It would take time. The crumbled side is on the same side as the flattened gardens, the pattern of the vegetation there totally broken.

It'll be easier to climb down than up - Riglan risks it - he lands on the topmost "complete" floor, where there's enough level ground. This means the vanguard is no longer visible to us, but neither us to them. Only 2 miles or so. About a minute later, nothing attacked us yet; quick conference about the situation; we note the floor we're on is quite unstable. Wooden structural beams support the floor but parts of that are damaged or rotted.

* Nethza finds a window and keeps watch on the vanguard.

* Maireagh on age/stonework, rapid assessment (19): it's old, but sturdy; destroyed because something crashed into it, obliquely - and it went down into the garden. Signs of battle. But a trebuchet wouldn't show he kind of 'crashed into obliquely' thing.

* Temo investigating for signs of habitation (25): Definitely inhabited by magic users. Finds stones deeply etched, from the floor above, indicating parts of what was a teleportation circle; finds very rotten damaged books and scrolls. Damaged vials, crystal apparatus. Finds enough evidence to suggest a few mages, not just one, with likely some guards; sees evidence of *charred* bones, but partly intact skeletons of strange-looking beasts. ACRO 26, easy to move around and investigate more. Huge rake marks across the wood, claws that might have been some 3 feet across (!), a lot of scorch marks - long marks - he starts to think, "red dragon attack".

* Riglan observation / insight general; via self-Bless, insight 17. ATHL 18 to climb up to the 3rd floor; now sees the direct line of damage down to the area in the garden. He can make out that something smashed down, then skidded and that created a mound in the garden that's now overgrown.

We compare notes and conclude that - whatever might "live" in the tower now - we think the garden is the most interesting thing. We skid our way down! ACRO/ATHL checks, we get down OK just about - except Nethza, who falls! She's a bit hurt - 8 damage - she's very embarrassed! She insists she's fine but Riglan heals her for 6, feeling very protective. We hurry over to the garden area.

A thin layer of earth, grasses and shrubs over *something*. A shape. This close, we can see it looks like a kind of face-planted dragon... The neck is turned around, the bones of what would've been the side of its face poking out of the earth, bleached white. Wings are folded over which hides the shape a lot, and it's all a mess and covered over, but know what we're looking for now and once we have our eye in we see more - where the tail goes, a part of a foot...

...Riglan says, "So... He wants the dragon. Whether or not it can still breathe fire, that's something we need to stop!"

But we don't have anyone with Gentle Repose.

Temo asks, "Is a dragon useful without its head? As a skeleton?"

"It's probably less useful than *with* its head! But still very scary."

Temo: "We could try and fight the oncoming vanguard, but he could just send another..." - INT-based insight (with luck point) - 13,13 (doh) +1 (luckstone) +4 (int via headband) -> 18.

* We can try to figure out how to stop this from being cast in the next 10 or so minutes - unlikely
* Try to defeat an undead dragon once raised (headless or otherwise) - unwise
* Observe how it is raised and interrupt it - very risky
* Isolate and attack one of the generals - they could send another but would he / can he risk it? We don't know how many "spares" he has.

But all-in, Temo says, "...well, we can't risk it. Despite the risk to ourselves, we can't risk any kind of undead dragon. Fear alone of that could be paralysing for some. We have to try and stop them, and that means we have to fight."

So do we walk out to meet them?

We would at least not be near anything *else* undead (or whatever) that lives in this tower. It might be friendly to the vanguard, or at least, hostile to us! Trouble is, the vanguard could pin us down while the general(s) escape/run for the dragon and raise it. Nethza suggests that she could interrupt the spell - counter it - and that's risky, but if we hid, it could give us an advantage at the start to attack the general doing the casting. Riglan can help everyone with PWAT from the staff.

That plan hastily drawn up, we look for somewhere to hide - easy enough in the maze on the edge. Riglan calls a fey hawk and sends it up, so we can keep hidden and he can watch the vanguard. Then Nethza can be ready in time.

We agree that the "go" signal will be to wait until the counterspell, unless Riglan has an "Oh fuck!" moment and acts first.

It's another waiting game! The hawk shows the vanguard approach. When it's only a few seconds away, Riglan casts PWAT through the staff, protecting everyone (hidden at points at the limit of the spell range so we're a bit spread out to maximise confusion when we attack). Nethza activates invisibility. Riglan keeps the hawk up high, top of the tower, to get a literal bird's eye view of combat in case anyone tries to flee.

The first thing we see directly are gnoll witherlings. The sniff around the dragon near us... Stealth:

* Riglan 22
* Temo 36
* Maireagh 24 (dog similar) 
* Nethza 22

...and the witherlings do not notice. Riglan from the hawk view sees that this actually quite a big group - *several* clusters of 9 or so skeletons or zombies, maybe four clusters *of each*. Then the main event; a death knight. He sniffs the air, almost like the gnolls did! He doesn't react (perception 15) - seems focused on the mound. Barks out orders *common* surprisingly, but it's an odd dialect - *old*, probably. The first group of skeletons starts to dig. Then one by one, more and more - until all the skeletons appear to be digging. The zombies shuffle closer but keep away from the mound itself.

We don't act - but then there's a kerfuffle; the gnolls bark and run around; the death knight calls out that they must be careful and not damage it. "Mark out the ritual!" he says to the witherlings as the skeleton is unearthed. The witherlings seem to have sacks of blood - not their own - that they bite to pierce, forming a circle around the skeleton.

Suddenly there's a loud screeching from the tower. Three flamesculls are flying, two out of the ground floor rubble; one at the top level, apparently all more or less materialising and heading down. Bolts of fire (Fire Ray) spring forth to attack. It hits three of the skeletons trying to lift the dragon bones. The death knight turns and roars out some incomprehensible command; the gnolls stop what they're doing and look up.

The sculls seem enraged. One shouts, "Who dares range **Klandohrog The Destroyer**?!". Another, "The entire order fell to bury him and he shall remain buried!" and a third shouts, "We will bury any who dare raise him!"

Temo mutters under his breath, "To hell with it!", aims and is about to fire at the death knight. But we've been together a while and we're all thinking the same thing, except Nethza who's focused on her task! Initiative:

* Riglan 25
* Temo 23
* Maireagh 22
* Nethza 8

Surprise rolls - gnolls and skeletons surprised, flame sculls too, zombies are surprised, death knight is (inevitably after all the other rolls by now) not quite surprised. But it rolls low initiative. At least PWAT helped with everything *else*.

Riglan had been thinking much the same as Temo and is supposed to be the one to signal a plan change by attacking **and he decides to go for the big one - L8 Sunburst**. The skulls must be avoided, so he lifts it up into the sky so the bottom of the radius hits just the "bad guys". It's akin to a reduced radius. He manages to try and get all skeletons, the gnolls and the death knight, maybe zombie or two; Nethza he tries to protect but she might be on the edge. He shouts, giving himself away, "WATCH YOUR EYES!" and casts.

It's *incredible*. An overwhelming burst of light and heat, and a strange "whomp" - not quite a bang - just a very sudden rush of rapidly expanding air, but much of Sunburst is radiant rather than heat per se.

CON saves, DC 20. Nethza *is* clipped (CON save adv). 12d6->**44** potential damage. All undead with disadv., but the death knight has adv against spells. Negates it, but he still fails. A group of skeletons on the edge manage to avoid the worst, but the damage is so high that they're obliterated - along with *all* the other skeletons! Every last one is burned to dust in an instant. The gnolls too. It clips half the zombies in the nearest group and takes them down. The death knight takes the damage no worries, but *is* temporarily blinded.

Riglan then shouts - fortunately mustering the mindset to do so - "Skulls! We fight with you and against these invaders!".

Temo fires. He closed his eyes so lost his aim, but the death knight is blinded - but rolls 3,7 then with luck point nat 3, so 18 total is not enough *and he misses*. The bolt glances off magical armour. That's a rare fuckup. He looks astonished. He moves to another tree to hide again, surprised and disappointed. He doesn't say anything, not wanting to give away his new position.

Maireagh runs out of cover, gets the dog to run up to the death knight as she gets in range, then throws her hammer (adding in L2 Branding Smite). Advantage due to blindness. 28, hits. Arcane Jolt added in for good measure... 33 damage, so-so given 'all the toys' but a solid result. Next attack 27, hits; 17 more damage. Wisps of purple shadow substance seem to be ejecting out as it starts to lose a degree of "cohesion". We suspect it'll heal itself up just fine given a chance though...

...the flame sculls roll insight to determine friend from foe. Not good! Low roll. They see us attacking the knight and heard Riglan saying something, but also see they just narrowly avoided his sunburst. They aren't attacking Riglan right now, but don't look friendly at all.

Scull #2 (next in initiative) throws a fireball at some of the oncoming zombie groups. 26 potential damage but DC13 is all that's needed to avoid the worst of it (but zombies are -2 dex). One group succeeds, two others fail - those are burned up. The group that dodged some of it loses a few zombies. The scull then moves closer to the deathknight.

Scull #3 drops a fireball *on itself*, or close by - hard to see from Riglan's position - catching the death knight and zombies, but also Nethza. 30 potential damage. Nethza dodges the worst (and has fire resistance) - only 7 damage. The zombie group that Riglan hit earlier is taken out; only the most distant ones are left. The death knight somehow dodges the worst despite the blindness, but it takes 15 damage. The scull then, too, moves forward to confront the death knight.

Nethza (still invisible!) has her sword ready. Her invisibility drops as she runs in to attack the death knight directly. She uses Banishing Smite - this "death knight" might not be killable / from this plane, like the dragon, she saw those purple wisps! - then swings; 22, hits. Normal 1d8+6->8, smite 5d10->31, total 39...

...it screams and the purple mist draws into Nethza's sword; then it all just disappears - the sword does that 'planar fissure' thing we've seen before; the night vanishes. Wait. What? Was it from another plane after all?! She calls out, "I don't think it's from this plane!" and Temo, seeing this, calls out, "We have to make sure Nethza doesn't get hurt!" - Nethza is backing away.

Scull #1 finally now acts. It moves forward and says - "How do I know this is not a ruse? That you are not its accomplices in some grand deceit?"

Riglan calls out, "We would readily submit to any truth spells you might have. And if you give me a minute I'll finish off those zombies...!" and shots a lightning bolt at the group; he manages to take out two, but there are still two more.

Temo shouts, "Yes, again, we really are on your side, I mean, you can see we don't *look* at all like them..." (persuasion 27) and takes down one zombie with an aimed crossbow bolt. One left.

Maireagh says, "This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen... What more proof do you need?!" and runs up to get closer; easily takes down the remainder.

Riglan says, "The aggressor is Azalin Rex, who commands an army of undead, raising daed to join his forces; he clearly wanted this dragon; via means of luck and scrying we saw his vanguard headed for the tower but managed to get here first." 

"We do not care about this Azalin of yours! But we *do* care about the desecration of the destroyer's earth prison."

"Can we help bury it again?"

"Yes! As you can see we lack the means to bury it ourselves... We can but burn it..."

Riglan doesn't have any earth moulding dialled in, so it's Cave Badger O'Clock, enlarged; he is able to dig around and do the work of many skeletons, with an Enlarge from Maireagh. Riglan takes a while as he is careful now to not damage the skeleton - it might annoy the sculls - digging *under* more than around. But while he digs, they ask if he can disperse its bones! Win. He can certainly do that - so he splits the skeleton up, burying it in bits scattered around, once he's then pushed earth on top, he turns back into himself and casts Plant Growth over the bulk of it for good measure. "How's that?" he asks.

The sculls start to fade. As they go, they say, "Thank you for your assistance today in furthering the missions of The Order." Riglan just has time to say, "Which order?!" - the last one answers, "The order of the Watchers Of The Stars. A mighty academy of astronomers and seers, learned in the arcane. But we were wiped out by the Destroyer. And now, in undeath, we are bound to prevent him from rising to terrorise the world once more." Riglan says, "Thank you for your help. Azalin will not return." (Fingers firmly crossed!) "If this Azalin of yours dares come back to unearth these bones, we *will* defend this tower - and we cannot die."

They fade out.

Riglan says to Temo, "So you were worried about what it would take to get Azalin really pissed off at us. I'm pretty sure this counts. It's a good thing we're not travelling with the main army anymore; we'd just bring danger to them."

Temo, insight 15. "I think it was pretty clear that we're not really welcome here - we should quit while we're ahead... No archaeology today, Maireagh. Shall we hit the road?"

We're depleted on spells, have no fast travel available - time to do things the old fashioned way. We start walking cross-country towards the road.

D20->6 for Temo; as we start to leave, disadv perception - 18,18->29 (wut?!) - we've just cleared the tower base, he senses something behind him out of the corner of his eye. A glowing orb is hanging there. He can see it but isn't sure anyone else can. It looks like there's a firey eye in the middle of it. Temo waves and says "Hi Azalin. It's us again." Everyone else looks at Temo as if he's mad but he points and says, "If you use See Invisibility..." - Maireagh adds that to Riglan and Nethza, who now both see it. Riglan walks right up to it. "You might be anyone, of course" he says, "but I think Temo's right. You're Azalin. You're probably wondering where your general is?" Nethza walks up, draws and creates her blade of shadow - "And this fate awaits any you dare send against us." She levels it at the eye. "You have been a thorn in our side long enough. And we will continue to be a thorn in yours. We have had enough. Today, the thorn turns into a blade that will strike into your heart" - and she shoves it straight into the eye, which shatters and evaporates.

Temo says, "Nicely done" and turns to keep walking away towards the distant road, whistling happily.

We all trundle along. Temo stops whistling for a moment to say, "We're totally fucked now aren't we?" and Riglan says, "Yep!" Temo replies, "Good-o, business as usual then."

### 2500XP for barrows + 7500XP for tower, each

We take a brief rest at the road. Rations are broken out. It's like old times, weirdly; on foot, by a road, eating rations.

Half a day later, we're caught up with the oncoming Ushien and crew. They ask what we've been doing. We explain briefly. "Do you feel like a bit of a walk?" they ask - "Sure!"

And so we continue, for the rest of the day.

### 6pm

We finally set up camp, off to the side of the road. We Maireagh is able to create a Sanctum to help protect all hundred-odd of us. Watch is eventually set; tents are put up; alarms are set. It's a significant camp with 100 or so people.

Everybody fits in a big marquee for food, except a few on watch.

Temo eventually finds a central spot, jumps up on a table and calls for everyone's attention. "Can you hear me at the back?" A distant and slightly irritated "yes!"...

...he starts in a more sombre tone, reminding them of the kind of enemy we face here, and that this group is likely to be confronted by Azalin himself. They must be strong willed and support each other. But then he goes on to sing the song of Klandohrog The Destroyer, to prove that he's defeatable - his forces can be beaten - and his plans can be disrupted. Ends on a high note. Literally.

In a Flash of Genius, Marieagh suggests that he shows a piece of death knight armour she'd taken as a trinket! "Here's the proof!" she says.

With luck point, Nat 20 (!) + 15 + 5 -> a **forty** persuasion. Suffice to say this is a good performance!

Mugs are raised, people cheer. The Knights of Samilar rattle swords, drawing and raising them in their salute; Ushien calls out, "And if this is the last crusade of the Knights Of Samilar, then surely this has been a worth march across the old country in pursuit of an ancient enemy alongside our dear old friends."

**(This amounts to an army advantage against the first Fear effect encountered - unshakable morale).**
