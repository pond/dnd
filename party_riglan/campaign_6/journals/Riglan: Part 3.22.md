# Riglan: Part 3.22
## Day 61, evening

It's the night time at the camp on the road, within a day of Zhentil Keep, with Ushien, the Knights of Samilar and about 100 of Cormyr. **The final battle is almost upon us.**

There's some discussion about what we do at the bridge. We want to draw the attention of Azalin Rex himself - ideally - while the Cormyr army marches in, north of the river. Make him fight on two fronts. We should both get there tomorrow, but Cormyr wants to rest due to all the expended magic. We need to plan for a way to keep hidden, or keep distant, until the next morning (day 63 in campaign terms).

Riglan considers perhaps wind-walking ahead once we're getting fairly close - or using an eagle or hawk - to scout for places we might "park" the army and hide it in a sanctum. Azalin will surely be aware we're on the way, and the main army too; we just have to play our part and react to whatever he does. We speak to mages about range of detection - they think a 'safe' distance to make sure he can't reach us with powerful magic, at least without warning, would be about 5 miles out. Scouts would have a chance to alert the camp and so-on.

People start to bed down for the night. The mood is tense - after battling the dragon, people are inspired, but expect repercussions. The sanctum should help enormously.

For our own part, we set up watch and sleep out in the open in the main camp, central, to be able to reach edges quickly in case of trouble on any side.

* Mairegh - an uneventful watch
* Nethza - 19, uneventful again
* Temo - who wanders out to the sanctum edges, gets bored, decides (WIS save 9!) he's stealthy and creeps outside of the sanctum - goggles on, perception 22. He's out for maybe 20 minutes.

  - He gets a message! It's from Ilsevele. **"Oh good, I haven't been able to find any of you! We just made landfall. Will be East of Zhentil two days."** Temo replies, "Good. Cormyr main army North of river tomorrow, must then rest until next day. Vanguard, with us in it, approaches via bridge same time." 

  - He heads back towards the sanctum... and gets a sinking feeling... Sanctum is maybe 200ft away, too far; bushes nearby; hides - stealth 26. A weird sense - momentarily sees the edge of a creature, something brushing nearby, so his Blindsense catching a glimpse, 10ft. **It's THAT creature. From the Shadowfell, on Nethza**. It is sniffing. Following a scent, towards the sanctum, along what Temo realises is the route the vanguard took. It's not hard to miss.

  - But the creature seems intent on something in particular. Of course - Nethza. It's hunting her.

Stealth 29, he starts to move as fast as he can to beat the creature to the sanctum without it hearing or bumping into it! He does not detect the creature again, so it's not within 10ft, but makes it back into the sanctum; nature 22; he's pretty sure that it looked like an animal tracking something, so the creature will be heading along the path it was following towards us. 25 investigation for a nearby scout - two, a paladin and squire; beckons them over, hastily hoarse-whispers information on this creature coming, then bolts to the party camp, ponders waking people but sees (investigation 31) the "see invisibility" device Maireagh has in the bag, so grabs that and kicks Riglan, "Wake up! Something's coming! South edge!" and runs off, as Riglan starts to wake up, "Wait, what?!"

Temp uses the device to see invisibility, leaves it at Riglan's side; the scouts haven't seen anything but Temo can see it standing, confused, at the edge of the sanctum. He whispers, "It's right there. Invisible. It followed our trail, our scent, from the march, but it can't figure out the sanctum. Trouble is, it must know there's *something* here, which might mean it'll call for help, or it could just try and push through, I don't really know how this works... We'd better be ready... Get help" and takes aim with his crossbow, ready to fire if it advances.

The paladin readies his sword and shield. The squire darts off to get help.

Riglan turns up and Temo quickly uses See Invisibilty on the paladin. Riglan can see it too, as he's used the device. His eyes widen. He doesn't recognise it at all; a very strange creature. He whispers, "It's that thing that was on Nethza. It's found us. It's hunting her, smelling her out somehow." Riglan, insight 29. "...Oh! This must have been following us... I wonder if it even came through tree portal, way back at Elven Court?! It has been following us. This whole time. We have to take it out. There's no other way, it won't stop. And if it realises it can just walk in here, others of Azalin's forces might hear about it. We need to get out, come around behind it, and attack."

Maireagh and Nethza turn up, having been woken by Riglan; they're rapidly appraised of the situation. Temo says to the paladin, "Want a fight? Or need to stand guard?" - he says, "I'm here to defend. I will stand in its way here." Maireagh is staying behind to flank with the dog; Riglan with that prior insight realises that Nethza must not leave - she'd be detected immediately. So she has to stay. Temo and Riglan run sideways a short distance, 60ft, then dart out of the sanctum, 30ft beyond, then come around to flank the creature. Temo's faster.

It's *just about* to move in, but our noise distracts it. It's just about to push two front spiked hands past the barrier, and Temo is ahead of Riglan, so Temo fires Magic Missile for a guaranteed hit to get its attention. 10 damage. It whips around and lets out a *scream!* Unnerving. CON saves - low rolls...

* Temo 14 - Temo takes 3 psychic damage
* Riglan 9 - Riglan takes 6 psychic damage 

...Riglan activates his staff, just as he catches up with Temo.

The creature jumps, a big leap, 20ft or so towards Temo and Riglan. Maireagh and the dog emerge out of the strange shimmering sanctum barrier with the paladin alongside. Riglan's relieved that Nethza is still inside. Maireagh throws her hammer and instructs the dog to run up and distract the creature, keeping close. She gets one hit out of two throws, but puts everything into that hit - a solid 33 damage.

Riglan shouts, "Anyone know if this is another one of those other-plane things, or can we actually *kill* this one?!" and Maireagh yells back, "No idea! But it's *ugly!*" (and the Paladin is standing in a way that Riglan thinks puts himself in between her and where Nethza might be; holding as a sentinel might; his blade is coated in some kind of pulsing radiant energy).

Initiative:

* Temo 15
* Maireagh 11
* Riglan 10
* Paladin 10
* (Creature, 3)

Temo now aims and fires his crossbow. 27 to hit, hits, 33 damage. Maireagh throws her hammer again, getting another one hit which does a high 35 damage. She orders the dog to keep pace with the creature if it moves. Riglan ends up a bit closer to the creature, within 10ft, to avoid hitting anyone with his lightning wand, then fires; it doesn't dodge and takes a solid 31 damage. The paladin repositions himself to keep blocking the creature as best he can. He holds whatever his spell is on his sword.

The creature, in between screams, continues to sniff the air. Nature 13, Riglan things the creature has changed its target. It looks drawn to - oh. Riglan. Huh?! Magic, maybe? Is he the most magical here? Riglan has enough time to say, "Oh, oh dear, I think I got its attention..." and then the creature leaps at him, claws out, raking in attacks. The leap attack is 15, but Riglan manages to avoid being hurt as his armour deflects. But the claws, looks like a critical hit but Temo reacts with Silvery Barbs (advantage to Maireagh) seeing the danger. It distracts it enough for Riglan to roll out of the way - no hits.

The creature spins around and screams, again. Temo shouts, "I think it's calling for help... Other things are going to come. Let's make this quick!"

He aims once again and is about to fire... But out of the corner of his eye he sees a flicker within the sanctum wall; perception 15; it's enough for him to see Nethza is leaping through, sword at the ready. Temo knows what this creature means to Nethza, and holds his action; if she doesn't take it down, he'll fire.

She leaps at it, surprising it; a solid hit, with Booming Blade; 22 damage; the blade goes in, it's up, but she slices it through on exit and it falls. It breaks up into chunks! As it does, some crumble to dust, except the very centre which ends up looking like some kind of crystal shard; a thin eggshell like thing; with partial runes inscribed in a stripe across the centre. Temo calls, "Quick, back inside the sanctum, in case it called others over!" and uses Mage Hand to lift the shell and bring it with us.

Temo, inside the sanctum; history 16+5->21. Oh. A lifetime ago, it seems! It looks like *a piece of sky* - the things we saw falling in the Shadowfell. This could be the *exact* same creature we met there. Perhaps in escaping it was injured, this chunk of sky embedding within it. He offers the opinion to the others. He watches Nethza closely - last time she came close to a chunk of this, she had a bad time!

"How have these things come through into our plane?" asks Nethza. "Well" says Temo, "We brought 'gifts', and that picture of Tummil's daughter, through, almost by accident. So I guess chunks of sky, too?! But we konw that Azalin has portals; we used one; and closed lots. A few questions to be asked of the Dark Powers, though, I'd say; the Shadowfell seems more like a sieve than a prison at this point." Maireagh suggests that perhaps Azalin caused so much damage, that the domain we were in - hopefully nothing more! - is now not contained.

So what else came through...? There were a *lot* of vampires, other undead, and whatever the creatures were being made by - oh, that person in purple, who we never identified. Are they helping?

Nethza says, "But that also means all those people who were trapped in there are no longer trapped."

Riglan looks awkward and says, "But from what time? At the moment of our departure, almost everyone was dead; the mist consumed all. I'd like to think they could escape, but, it'd have to be from an earlier time. And *which* one? Whole generations grew up there."

Nethza gets closer to the shell. The runes start to dimly glow. "I don't know if this is good or bad?" she says, "But I feel compelled to hold it." Temo says, "That was part of the prison, part of the people on 'our side', so to speak. Go for it!"

Nethza picks it up. The runes glow brightly. The shell starts to break up into motes of light, which then surround her as runes unravel into strands of golden thread spinning around too. Riglan and Maireagh step back, involuntarily, but Temo is very protective and stays close. He's within 10ft. Riglan and Maireagh, maybe 15-20ft.

The light expands outwards, 10ft, 20ft, 30ft... We're all in it. The paladin is within the range too. Suddenly everything darkens. The sky becomes different; twilight colour, not night, but dark, blue-purple; it feels like we stand on an ocean of dark, reflective water, but it's solid, and as wide as the world and as deep as an inch! We see no horizon, but in the dim light do see our reflection. If we move, ripples seem to flow outwards forever.

Appearing in the sky, taking shape from droplets of water dripping *upwards*, a council that look like the Dark Powers, or at least "feel" like it. But there are distinctly five now, whereas we kind of couldn't tell before due to the scale and strange shifting of position or vision that we saw at the time. They are humanoid-ish, as if wearing heavy cowls, faceless but not featureless somehow - areas where eyes would sit are visible - one has one "eye", another six! One has eyes in the centre of its chest. It's hard to see them as they absorb light completely; we see the absence of reflection for most of the form.

They speak telepathically; we don't know who talks at any given time but "hear" distinct voices. No question - the Dark Powers.

"You have opened a conduit into the prison. We realise it is very damaged. We are repairing it. But this can only mean one thing; that the creatures we had banished to Azalin's prison have escaped."

"How many?" asks Riglan.

"We do not yet know. Are you still willing and able to fulfil your task?"

"Willing, yes. Able? We have no way to assess that. We don't know how strong Azalin's forces are, and you do not know how many more might have joined him from this domain."

"He has found paths and created paths of his own."

"Yes, we closed some."

"He *must* have help from outside. Do you know who his accomplices are?"

"We have fought a few generals, or ancient cohorts, but we know very little, I'm afraid, of his actual direct powers or the people around him. He intends to mass-raise the dead via a ritual casting circle, but we know little more. Attempts to scry are generally unsuccessful; he blocks them."

They convey concepts now, rather than speech.

* Despite their immense power in their domain, in their plane, their abilities are very limited on other planes.
* The only real way they can influence other planes is to send forth mist to consume sections and draw them into the Shadowfell, like they did before.
* Should we fail, they convey that they would have to resort to that, pulling in part of the Dale Lands and anyone else nearby.

Riglan says, "We do remember, you told us last time. We are not intending to fail; many lives depend upon our success."

"Is there any other way that we can help, without physically intervening?"

Riglan thinks and says, "The only thing I can think of was an unresolved mystery in the prison domain. A figure in a purple robe, who was working - we thought - behind Azalin's back, committing atrocities, building creatures, twisting things; but perhaps he was actually practicing, building things for Azalin? Maybe he's helping? Can you find out who or what that is?"

"Yes".

Their eyes close for a moment. A short or long moment? It's hard to say, no way to judge time here! Then all the eyes open. "She's safely still contained in the prison realm." Whatever *that* means, but it means we're no closer to having any idea who Azalin is being assisted by.

"Given that prison is broken, are you able to free the people who were trapped there when the mist was used to capture Azalin the first time?"

"Which people?"

"Humans, elves, halflings... I don't know, whoever it was that were captured! They had descendants. I don't know how the magic works."

"Are there specific people you would like to bargain for? Or would you like us to release all humanoids?"

"At least only living, not undead; we can't answer that either, we don't have enough information. We'll have to think about it. Will we get another opportunity to talk when we cast the spell to trap Azalin?"

"There's always time once it's within our domain. When you step into our world, we can make most things possible."

"Thank you. Sorry I can't be more specific, we haven't managed to find out more despite all our attempts; but we did manage to raise some armies, which isn't bad going! We just planned an all-out assault; it's all we've got." Riglan then adds, "You asked us who Azalin's accomplices are. Why is that information important to you?"

They explain that the nature of the 'cosmic bargain' that was struck, giving them unlimited power within the Shadowfell is to fulfil the duty of balance - to remove elements of unfettered, disruptive power and help restore balance to the planes. If someone can circumvent the protection and barriers between our plane and the Shadowfell then on a fundamental, existential level, that's very important to them; it undermines the basis of their authority.

They reiterate that what Azalin did should, technically, magically, not have been possible at all. That's why they believe that he *must* have had help from the outside.

(We remember that it was hinted at, alluded to, that the connection with Nethza was part of how he did it - but we realised later that this was just part of Nethza's greatest fear; the world collapsing because of her very existence; existential guilt; but we know that Azalin and the Shadowfell amplify dread and fear, so we don't think this is a true situation).

Riglan asks, "Do you have any ability to see into our world and find people who might be able to Dreamwalk and may have helped Azalin that way?"

"Dreamwalking? Why do you speak of Dreamwalking? This is - it is rumoured that such a power could exist, but its never been proven."

Riglan laughs. "I am proof. I can do it, and Azalin has met me in such a dream. Temo, too."

"So Azalin is a dreamwalker?"

"Yes. And our theory was that someone on the outside - in our world - communicated through the dream plane with Azalin, so that's how it started."

"Then we have our answer! We did not believe Dreamwalking was possible... As a result, there were no runes to block him off from the realm of dreams."

Riglan nods and says, "Well, that would be part of it; blocking that should at least stop the communications leaks. But if someone is actively opening paths and portals at this time, well, that's another story entirely."

"They should still not technically be able to penetrate into the Domain of Dread with two-way travel."

(Riglan realises that this means the mist-bounded domains *within* the Shadowfell. If creatures from the Domain Of Dread have entered our world, then they've escaped the prison and into the Shadowfell around, then could've used portals that we found in Cormanthor, which were two-way into the plane, but not into the Domains.)

**We learn that if they close paths to the world of dreams, it would mean nobody in the domains would ever dream again. That might have to be the cost.**

They did look into how Azalin cracked the sky. Azalin slowly accumulated power, building things up until he could release basically an explosion. A day of reckoning. The release of a huge amount of energy in one go cracked the protective runes - **but only because an external element had found its way to him** - something that allowed him to build a *conduit* of magic out of the Domain of Dread.

Someone on the outside had to be able to open a portal to somewhere for which Azalin had some kind of anchor.

Then Riglan goes, "Oh, but was the anchor not the ingot?"

If formless beings made of darkness and eyes could ever look surprised, they look surprised briefly.

* Azalin used dreamwalking to contact people outside
* Someone managed to create a fissure into the Shadowfell, outside the Domains, and pulled Nethza in
* We followed, ended up inside the mist in Azalin's domain
* We brought things from our plane
* Those made their way to Azalin
* He cracked the runes
* The object he obtained from us was enough to be a Planeshift focus

There are supposed to be *many* protections. A pure material from immense value, and the likelihood of such a thing ending up in the domain at all are nearly impossible...

Temo clears his throat and says, "...ah, well, you didn't account for well-meaning people on a mission of rescue and mercy encountering others who'd been captured by mistake and trying to help out. And happening to help out by giving them pure chunks of powerful, valuable metal..."

Enough for not one, but two tuning forks.

Riglan's ears drop. "So - so that settles it; this was our fault; Azalin's here because of us. There's no question anymore. He organised for this, we were manipulated, but we didn't see it."

We wonder if there were others like us. Perhaps hundreds, thousands; it just happened to be us that were in the wrong place at the wrong time and got drawn in. His unlikely, complex web of plans, focusing on escape while he let the council run his "prison", would be so fragile and likely to fail if it relied on *just* us four. It seems very likely that there were others lined up in other ways, or he's just very lucky, or he's just *really* good at planning.

Nethza's guilt was that her and her alone is the thing between Azalin's escape or his confinement. But she was probably just one possible route. And more to the point, if we'd left her there, he wouldn't have escaped. She could've taken the throne, but he'd be trapped. He needed the Adamantium. She didn't carry that. It was the rest of us - she was just bait!

Riglan asks if they understand the concept of the passage of linear time, as we perceive it in our realm. The process of cause and effect; events leading one after another. Yes. They also understand the concept of generations of people in the past; but as Riglan explores this he learns that when Azalin escaped he "cemented" time in that domain. If we were to request anyone to be 'rescued' into our domain, it could only be from the point when we left; when the prison was cracked. That "branch" of reality. So of course, sadly, we know a probable majority of people had perished in the mists, but there may be hope for some in Citeaux.

> **Riglan will have to figure out who... He has the unenviable task of making a list of names of people who will be saved. It feels like playing god, in the worst way. Yet to rescue *nobody* feels even more callous. He *could* perhaps bring, basically, all of Citeaux? To Riglan, something which *isn't* a moral dilemma so much is that he'd bring through both good and bad people in that case, rather than leaving some good people behind because of the risk of the bad. Temo, on the other hand, will certainly have something to say about it!**

Beyond our part in getting Azalin back into his prison realm, the Dark Powers have no other tasks for us.

OK, so, how do we leave here, wherever 'here' is?! `:-D`

The Dark Powers "fade", into vapour, rising into the sky rather than dropping back down into the kind-of-water below. Riglan, insight, 26. He realises that we stepped through, or into, a... Moment. A moment in time. He can see a horizon, now he's had time to adjust. As he stares at it, it seems to get closer, very quickly; and in the blink of an eye, they're back on Toril, people around us in mid-conversation; no time has passed here, we realise, very quickly.

We go back to sleep - there's not much else to do! - Temo finishing up his watch, then Riglan taking over and Temo and the others getting an extra hour or two of sleep.


## Day 62
### 8:30am, on the road to Zhentil Keep with the vanguard

(Riglan's swapped Wind Walk for Locate Creature in the morning).

The camp is being packed up so we hastily pack up as well. It'll take most of the day, they think, to reach Zhentil. We need to keep about 5mi or more away to avoid detection and find a place to hunker down - hide, if at all possible! They send scouts ahead for that.

It's just a day of travel, really. We attempt to figure out a battle plan. The idea is to create an illusion of this being the main army, while the real army keeps distance North of the river. Then, we cross the bridge - and deal with whatever is thrown at us! - and try to engage or distract Azalin, hopefully. The main army then attacks.

This is the day we'll come within view, we think, of the river (and via spyglass, the keep probably).

Onward. Temo casts L3 Sending to Isteval; "We will reach Zhentil today. Will keep 5 miles away to avoid detection. Will hold waiting for your mages to rest. Your situation?" "Marching towards the river today, as has been discussed. No further updates. Army is moving en masse."

It's a day of reflection and preparation. We talk with each other and we get to know people around in our marching group better. Equipment is checked and re-checked as we walk. The Knights of Samilar know each other well and march together, but are not isolated. They too talk to and learn about the people around them so we can all fight as a unit. They try to prepare people for what is to come.

We might not be fighting today, but we will be tomorrow.

Riglan hears lighthearted banter from time to time, but insight easily reveals that this is fear and nervousness being masked. These people have seen Azalin's army now and have a lot of awareness of what they will be facing.

The area we're now in, for these last few 10-20 miles or so, seem to have old farm and service buildings dotted around but all are abandoned and crumbling. The road from Yulash to Zhentil is not maintained - rutted and overgrown - but passable enough. Towards the east, occasionally glistening waters of the Moonsea are visible on the horizon; the land slopes that way towards it. The countryside is to Riglan's eyes recovering from having been farmed and now abandoned; a re-wilding. Everything is relatively young, of course; there seem to be very few areas of original nature here.

### 4pm

The scouts return. They reached a ridge line where they got a view to Zhentil. They advise the army not cross it, because it becomes very visible in so doing. The plan is to set up camp on the South side.

The scouts lead the vanguard from here. We reach the ridge, which is about 6 miles out from the Keep and stop here. Camp starts to be established. The scouts say they could search around to see if there are ways to bring people through slowly, if we want the 100 of us to get over the ridge without it being too obvious, because Riglan confesses a concern that if Azalin's own scouts see 100-odd approaching, then an illusion turning us into 8000 for the last 10 minutes near the bridge would be pointless!

While the scouts find passages, we creep up the ridge line. The top of the hill is mostly bare, especially near the top of the road. Anything cresting would be silhouetted. There are few smaller gulleys that allow us to sneak through; undignified, crawling along all fours keeping low, until we think we're on the northern side and not so visible anymore.

The landscape undulates downwards away from the crest, sloping towards the river almost 6 miles away. Using the spyglass, Riglan sees small patches of scrub; some abandoned homesteads; really, more of the same - overgrown fields and so-on. Nothing particularly easy to hide in. The road is in the same kind of state. The most visible thing is the bridge. In front of it stands a small collection of buildings. It's too far to see any details. On the other side, the town starts right away. Gate towers, various other buildings, but he can't see beyond that. The keep is visible of course; it's up a hill, with sheer rock faces for defensive positioning.

We elect to return to the waiting vanguard, to consult with them; they've *not* set up camp as they didn't know if they should come through to the other side and hide there. The undulations in the landscape on the far side does provide a bit of physical cover here and there, but we'd certainly need magical cover and their scouts would be outside the protected area (if nobody can see in, we can't see out!). We either have to do that on this side anyway, then risk it tomorrow creeping through the tunnels slowly, or get that over with today so we can move fast tomorrow *if* we have to and this feels pragmatic. We elect to use the low light of the evening to our advantage and bring the army through - assuming the scouts find good tunnels.

The scouts don't find tunnels, but do find passages through the eastern side of some hills which helps the army march in shadow. Single file and spaced out. It'll have to be enough. We've got to risk it today or tomorrow and no time like the present.

We run ahead to find what looks like the most dodgy bit - which is in fact just at and after the crest; Riglan will stand there, with PWAT active on the staff, to provide additional cover as the single-file group passes the crest. Temo moves around a lot, stealthily, checking to make sure people are keeping distance and quiet. Maireagh and Nethza will keep at the front with the scouts, leading everyone through. Maireagh notices that the veil we could hide within is about 4 miles from the bridge - a bit close - but she can set up the anti-scrying in advance. We agree that she'll go forward with the scouts. Nethza stays with the vanguard to keep them at the correct pace.

We start to file into the veil. It already has the strange, matte grey effect of Private Sanctum which everyone vanishes into. Very odd to look at. Rigland and Temo are one of the last; he sees people already setting up camp and preparing. Everyone's being reminded of rules - no big fires as the sanctum hides the fire but not any smoke that might rise out of it. A sombre mood. We don't have to be quiet, though, so Temo plays various tunes to try and calm nerves (performance 20).

Lady Ushien approaches. "I will keep spirits high! I know you have things you have to do". The Knights do their "thing".

### 6pm

We're settled in earlier than expected. We don't know if we were seen but we did everything we could. Next, our group has a choice about whether or not we try to scout out the keep and bridge for more information.

We sneak out. The sun is almost setting over the Western mountains. It'll take an hour to get close, so Temo has his goggles on and Riglan casts Darkvision. Once we're about 20 minutes away from as close as Riglan wants to risk, he casts PWAT again via the staff. It's to cover our final arrival, shenanigans and departure. We have to move more slowly. There's not much to hide behind near the buildings.

It's much more ruined than expected, now we're close. The bridge, about 100ft away, fortunately seems in good condition. We're up against the buildings in front of it. There are maybe half a dozen buildings on this side of the bridge, including a couple of taller ones - 2 and 3 storey respectively. A potential vantage point. 

The bridge is much a greater span the traders estimated. The total span is some 100ft, even though the canyon itself is somewhat narrower - but even that is 65ft wide, and about 60ft deep. The traders must've seen this from a distance, understandably, and made some guesses. It's about 12ft wide, low stone walls which don't protect against falling very well! Only two abreast.

The waterfall is really close, only some 30-40ft further upstream and certainly covers us for noise. It's a series of small waterfalls and rapids. Up there, the river is only some 20-25ft below the cliff edge. If Azalin is here already, he must've used the bridge; otherwise, he's perhaps under the Moonsea right now. To find that out... Temo scouts ahead and looks at the 3 storey building to see if there's anything in it. Perception RT, 21; on the way here he clearly sees plenty of evidence of a large army travelling through here. Not at all subtle! The ground is very trampled and churned, recent-looking mud and earth walked over the bridge.

He has to partly force the rusted lock with his dagger and gain access to the tower. Dusty, abandoned. A musty smell, not death. Uninhabited. He uses Message (cantrip) to let Riglan know that the party can come through. We push the door shut. It feels a little safer!

Temo takes the spyglass and looks for a way up. Riglan searches too. Stairs seem to be holding up; they're rock and haven't got wet. A window higher up faces the river and city. Cleaning stone sorts out the dirt! Looking around the room it's bare, except curiously for a bit of paper - part of a letter? - which Temo grabs in case of interest but we're busy and he doesn't look at it yet. Temo starts to observe the buildings and wall "tops" and towers of the structures beyond the bridge.

City walls for an overall defensive perimeter of the keep, as we'd been told. In front are some three blocks or so of buildings; maybe 200ft from bridge edge to city walls. Again, as we were told, it's all narrow streets and tall buildings. Hard to tell anything inside there. Perception 23 on the tops of keep walls to see if there are any visible guards; none visible. There is a *sense* of movement, somehow; he can't make out what it is; there is *something* back there.

Riglan calls a fey owl with instructions to check that out.

While it flies away, Temo turns the spyglass left, to see what the Western side looks like - where our army will approach. There's damage there, areas that look as if they were hit by something. Part of the city has even fallen into the river on the northern side where a rock ledge or something similar failed. A large watch tower pokes up from the keep and should provide good visual coverage, unfortunately, of anything approaching from the northern side for some distance.

The main keep building is a chapel-like shape. To Riglan's astonishment, he sees flicking lights; as if fire or candles. He would not expect Azalin's army to need that - and he theorises that this might be cohorts; Zhentarim come to meet Azalin perhaps. (Temo) Perception 28 (luck point) spots a flash of movement and at that moment Riglan gasps - his owl has been killed. Temo realises he's seeing a flash of wings; a sinewy shape of a dark green wyvern, which arches out from behind the walls, snapping the owl out of the sky. It perches on the keep wall, looking around.

He whispers to Riglan, "Sorry about your owl - they have a wyvern."

Maireagh says, "Wait, what? We've seen no wyverns. They have no aerial units? Where has this come from?"

Riglan points out the flickering light and suggests that they've got backup now, but people who require fire for light or heat.

Outside the city walls, it's a jumble of buildings. Many more are in ruin and crumbling than expected based on the trader description. There is, in fact, apparently a clear path exposed by fallen buildings that have tipped into the river rather than blocking streets - *on the Northern side* from the Western approach. On *our* side, the route from bridge to keep is anything but clear! There's even a gatehouse. We look closely... A portcullis is down. It's defensive. Stop traffic over the bridge before even reaching the city gates behind. The 'citadel' of the keep looks to rise about 30-40ft itself, so it's a substantial building that could hide a lot of creatures. The tower we saw is attached to the city walls, though, rather than the citadel.

(Riglan contemplates changing plan radically - swap Sunburst for Earthquake?)

Towards the east, there seems to be a cemetery (of course there is!). There seem to be huts and sheds, fewer stone buildings, then turning into abandoned farmland. Around a mile away, an edge of a forest is visible, stretching to the North and East, heading towards the Moonsea. Riglan would put good money on Cormanthor elves being hidden in there right now!

There's no city wall on the Eastern side. Just the citadel, the city walls terminating at the buildings and some natural cliffs and hills; it's a better approach for anyone good on natural terrain - like elves.

* So Cormyr has a decent approach from the West but it'd help if we took out the tower. L8 Earthquake?

* Cormanthor has a decent approach from East without help and will act independently when they see us moving, using our ruckus as a distraction - we think (Temo can confirm with Sending)

* Our own group is in the meat grinder!

Nobody in that keep is going to be stupid enough to believe 8000 people are expecting to walk over a bridge terminated by a portcullis. We have to drop that plan. We'll use the magic to try and mask our approach and be more of a surprise force. The four of us will be conspicuous, to goad Azalin.

* L5 Transmute Rock to melt the stone of the watchtowers around the portcullis and collapse it. Makes it seem like we mean business. That's within range from our side of the bridge - handy!

* L8 Earthquake to protect Cormyr - maybe. Riglan's made his mind up; he feels there's no choice; it might not work but it's too good an opportunity to miss. It's another way of distracting Azalin and bringing him our way.

Riglan's thinking about maybe even keeping our crew on the South side, but Maireagh points out that Azalin might just destroy the bridge. OK, so we have to get everyone over as quickly as we can. How can we protect and distract while that's going on? Riglan can pull a dragon or similar to combat the wyvern at least, else that's going to be flying in and trying to knock people off the bridge and so-on. Maybe we just lead the charge and throw some big stuff at the buildings on the other side as cover, getting everyone over ASAP.

We decide this isn't the safest place to continue a discussion, though we know now we could hide a sniper or two up here? Temo, perception 21 by RT, what's the field of view? He could cover a few positions from here, but more than 2/3rds of the city wall is obscured. He can't even see the path to the gate clearly. It's not a huge help and probably not worth the effort.

We should go. We creep back down and cautiously open the door, looking around; Temo has a quick investigation on this side and is pretty certain nobody is here. The buildings must be inconsequential to Azalin? No threat, perhaps? We could hide a fair few in this area before charging the bridge if it came to it. It's abandoned here. One of the buildings appears to be stables, quite large too. That probably means horses aren't supposed to be in the city - not built to accommodate them. That's a question for the Knights! Narrow streets for sure.

Temo figures he could hide maybe 60 of the vanguard in buildings, but they'd have to sneak in and it'd take time. **It'd have to be done tonight, not in daylight.** Would a surprise attack of that kind be good in terms of its greater distraction potential and worth the risk?

We're withdrawing as we discuss this but we can't make the decisions alone. A while later we're crawling through the gulley again and finally, back at the camp.

The strategists are drawn together. We describe what we saw and thought in as much detail as we can. Nobody is willing to make a call in our little group about whether or not we change the "pretend to be a big army" plan; we'd need to get out to the Cormyr army generals. Nethza can get us out there, but we can't get back (no big trees). It's not something that can be done via Sending spells!

Ushien has run sieges before. She's confident she can help get people over the bridge; "Leave it to me!" she says. Riglan's ability to melt the portcullis is important and it should be done. Bringing down the walls and tower would be good but Riglan would need to be certain he could do it. **If he's not certain that his spell will be enough, then there's a lot of risk that he just causes a lot of rubble and blocks the streets, actually making things worse.** Ushien tells us that sometimes defenders destroy their own nearby "disposable" infrastructure in order to cause just that kind of blockage. Ushien also points out that the army has their own scouts, a lot of experience and will doubtless have already looked at the city and seen the tower themselves. They'll be prepared.

Given that we can't easily converse with the main army generals to see if they're OK with us changing the nature of our "surprise attack", so we won't; we'll keep that plan. After all, a mage reminds us, if there's something like a meteor storm spell on hand, we want that dropping on *us* not on the real army.

* The mages will do their thing as we march towards the keep. They'll position themselves first thing in the morning along the route. A real army would never march everyone en masse to a choke point; it'd have a long tail of people, and the scattered mages will double up and otherwise make things look like there are more people in a long column behind what will be the *real* people.

* This has some limitations - it's designed to be seen at a shallow angle, hiding gaps that must be present between the positioned mages. Anyone in the air would see through it. We bear that in mind - wyverns, flying creatures etc. might come to investigate and we'll need to tackle them early, before they see through it, if that happens.

* Ushien will coordinate timing. She'll tell Riglan when to "melt" the portcullis and when we should come across the bridge.

Temo, perception adv., 26. Something that complicates matters but maybe improves them...? He picked up a fragment of a letter he saw when he was up at the watch tower, which he only now looks at. There's enough to learn about a secret delivery passage...?! Contraband being brought into the keep. "Just one more smuggling run to do". It suggests a cellar in town provides access. There's a chance the tunnel still exists and this might be a way for us, no matter how bad the battle above, to get into the keep and track down Azalin.

Riglan says, "That's our aim, I think; if he doesn't come out himself, if we can't goad him away, then we have a way to sneak in and try to find him directly. But we'll have to find and make it as far as that cellar. Means we're definitely crossing the bridge and entering the city if so."

Maireagh thinks it's a good plan. Riglan isn't sure if that's a good omen or bad!

It feels like we're at the point in planning when we can't do much more. It'll all like change in the first five minutes anyway, as is tradition.

Riglan announces his party piece. Heroes Feast. Twelve people. The four of us, and eight of the Knights of Samilar including Ushien as they'll be riding up front. If we're going to get hit by fear and wisdom-limited effects it's probably going to be then! It gives 2d10->only 9, better than nothing, HP, along with its other various benefits.

We should sleep. Tomorrow, we get into position, message Cormyr and attack!

Watch is set, dog helping as usual. Adv. perception:

* Mairegh - 22, alert
* Nethza - 9, very worried
* Temo - 23, sees Nethza looking worried and introverted. "What's worrying you?" he asks, deliberately lightly. "So much can go wrong tomorrow. And yet, there's really only one or two ways it could go right." "True, but it's not the first time we've been in this position." "I know. I feel so much more responsible for all these lives this time - last time we were just sort of saving the world! An outcome of our actions. Now, I feel directly responsible for these people that we have travelled with." "We are. And that's why we have to do our very best, with whatever we can, to nudge the outcome towards those one or two options. We have a lot going for us and lot of help this time, from the obvious like the army, the unknown like Cormanthor and even the otherwordly like your patron." "I just hope I have the wisdom, courage and strength. The whole camp seems nervous and on edge... But... Well, alright. I should sleep!"
* Riglan - 25



## Day 63
### 6am, on the day of the great battle

Dawn breaks over the moon sea, reflecting in Riglan's eyes.

Beautiful... Is this my last dawn?

The sky lightens first, as the camp behind Riglan is set down it the shallow basin. The camp starts to rise early; 6:30 stirrings, 7am busy. The party wakes up from the noise. Light starts to hit the tops of hills around.

* Heroes Feast dropped, Transmute Rock pulled in
* Summon Beasts and Draconic Spirit are already available
* Sunburst held as L8 big bang, given concerns about Earthquake
* Drops Speak With Plants for the first time, to pick up Giant Insect to help fight through the city

We have to wait until we get a signal from Cormyr to tell us to head in. We told them we'd camp about 5 miles away and they know the travel time.

So now we wait. Maireagh makes a cold breakfast, with magically heated water for tea. Camp starts to be packed up. Much of it is left behind, hidden; no point carrying excess baggage! The mages head out, to position themselves along the route. Lots of conversations around - people trying to keep spirits up, the Knights doing the usual inspirational speeches. Without our party, nerves are obviously high but there's a strange sense of comfort in the knowledge that it all happens today, at least. More or less, no more waiting. We are resolved to act.

Temo gets a message via Sending. The army is headed in and believes we should start our approach now to time with them coming in a little later to take advantage of our surprise.

Temo calls to Ushien, "Cormyr is ready - we must leave now!"

Camp breaks. People start to ride out. We walk up front behind the Knights Of Samilar. Riglan keeps a close yee on the skies in case of incoming wyverns. The mages start casting Major Image or something like that, which gives a false impression of the size of the army. There are gaps, between the mages, but seen from the low angle of Zhentil it should look more or less continuous. Four abreast; first three rows are the Knights, us mixed in with that.

Once everyone has fallen into line and we're out in the open, the march picks up pace. The last part is going to be a gallop, we're warned; we will have to run, for up to about half an hour.

The mages between the five of them create 100ft long, 20ft wide trails spread across the valleys. It looks good from *our* angle, so hopefully looks good from Azalin's!

20 minutes in, Riglan, perception 22, checking the sky around the keep frequently via spyglass - a wyvern has perched on top of the keep. It is watching. He sees some distant figures moving around on the walls too. He lets people know that we've now been spotted and gets ready to potentially fly (or send something) out to tackle the wyvern. Ushien says, "If we've been spotted - let's go for it! **Knights of Samilar! On me!**" - and the **gallop is on**.

And so we run. Temo is pulled onto the dog, though he could happily run quickly, but Maireagh and Nethza activate Fly. Riglan just keeps going on foot - he's 8ft tall and of course *could* turn into an eagle or horse or similar. ATHL 17+8->25. A mage is hoisted up onto a horse to the left, still casting Major Image to try and fill in gaps within our group. Now it's a cavalry charge, some 100ft horses strong, knights charging full tilt. Ushien pulls forward to form an arrowhead shape on the charge. The squire behind her swings out and unfurls a banner of the Knights Of Samilar. Temo shouts out, "Oh dear, did we walk to Cormyr about branding?!"

We crest a final hill with the small settlement of 6 or so buildings some 500ft away...

**...just as the wyvern takes to the air.**

Riglan casts L5 Draconic Spirit (gem, dragon radiant) and instructs it to do whatever it can to stop the wyvern from flying either high or close (and kill it if possible). He throws in his bear totem in the middle of us, so everyone in the area gets 21 temp HP. The spirit will fly out of range immediately but will hold its temp HP at least (as will all of us, even though the totem's other effects will wear off in a minute, before we're near the keep) - Riglan initiative 18+5->23. Wyvern 5! At full dash they're going 120 and 160 (!) respectively; they meet in mid-air in just a few seconds. The wyvern is screeching.

The dragon attacks - radiant breath does a 2d6->11 damage, plus gets both rend attacks in for a very solid 26 damage (1d6+9 x 2). The wyvern responds! The stinger whips around; 22 vs AC 20, hits; 7 piercing. The poison has no effect - the spirit is immune; as the poison injects, the stinger pulses but the dragon doesn't seem to notice. The wyvern then rends with its claws, but the spirit dragon dodges (17 vs AC 20).

The dragon rends again, hitting twice, 25 damage; draws back a bit, breath at point blank strikes true - 8 more damage. The wyvern tries a bit and claw, having seen little effect from its stinger - the claws go wide as the dragon twists and coils in the air, the two pirouetting around each other somewhat, but the bite clamps down on its neck for 11 damage. The riders below are closing in, bit by bit below, about 180ft covered - almost directly below the creatures fighting in the sky. Its attention are drawn to the riders and it tries to break away; the spirit dragon tries to grab the wyvern with both attacks.

Its first claw strikes true; athl 16+4->20, vs Wyvern 6! Wow. It's held tight by the neck; the other claw rakes in (adv); max damage, 6+9->15; breath weapon, Wyvern can't dodge, 9 more damage... But it's still up!

Below, Nethza, Temo, Riglan and Maireagh are within 120ft distance (mostly vertical). Initiative:

* (Riglan 23)
* Temo 21
* Maireagh 8 
* Nethza 7

Temo is on the dog - he looks up, sees the grappled wyvern and fires (aiming to negate the bouncing around on the dog!) - adv. due to grapple anyway - sneak damage is a good 39. He's aimed for the head as the neck grapple means that's moving the least. The arrow pierces directly through its scull, cutting abruptly short its thrashing and screeching. The spirit tries to throw the wyvern clear, but it's suddenly very heavy now it's not flying! ATHL only 4+4; it lurches sideways and dumps it unceremoniously to the side of the vanguard. It flies back and maintains height above Riglan until given instructions next - doesn't make a sound.

Riglan likes that. Just quietly take down your wyvern in about 20 seconds and calmly carry on with the charge, stride uninterrupted.

Temo checks behind briefly; he sees an army spilling down over the crest of a hill, a column of movement, a mixture of riders and runners - but there's a lot of dust to hide the true numbers; Temo makes a mental note to remember that obfuscation!

Onward!

Ushien calls out a war cry. What the hell. Temo does his best to copy it; the rest of us do our best to copy it. "**FOR LIGHT AND RIGHTEOUSNESS!**" Her sword is drawn, set ablaze; Riglan lifts his staff and gets it glowing with arcane energy, activated; the other knights yell out, drawing swords. We're now on a road that tapers in and heads straight for the bridge. Riglan calls out, "I'll need a few seconds to take down the portcullis - about as long as it'll take you to cross the bridge!" - he sprints - ATHL 23 - keeping pace with Ushien's surge of speed - almost at the very threshold of the bridge, he can see the gate tower and casts his Transmute Rock. It's fun! The buildings just *melt* into mud and the portcullis sags then falls backwards with a crash. He calls to the dragon, "Air defence! Keep watch!"

Netzha and Maireagh fly past; she levitates the portcullis and floats it off to the side; Riglan's like, "Oh, right we're crossing the bridge then" and chases after Temo and the dog who are hot on the other two's heels. Ushien is over the bridge already, just as the portcullis is moved aside. The horses thunder through the street and start the slow climb up towards the keep; Riglan shouts after them "keep watch to the sides!" worried about side street attack - but they surely can't hear; except then, Ushien yells, "Protect the flank!" as the knights move shields off to the sides as the lean into the charge. Either she heard him or, more likely, just knew it was the right thing to do.

Riglan then shouts, "When you're across, turn around, protect the army" as we're moving across the bridge. There are lots of people to cross yet.

As soon as he's over the bridge, Riglan darts to the side, stumbles to a stop and spins around. Temo peels off the other side and jumps off the dog, which runs off to join Maireagh. Riglan perception 16. Temo 27. Riglan sees movement up ahead but can't tell what it is; Temo is more centred and in a better position to see a hulking undead ogre emerge from behind a building. It reaches down and picks up a huge chunk of rubble - a corner of a building really! - raises it above its head and starts waddling along, picking up speed; it's going to throw it.

Temo calls out a warning; takes aim at its eye; it gets within range; fires. 17, just hits. 36 damage. It stumbles; the arrow didn't quite get the eye but did get close. It shakes its head, trying to get its balance; then just gives up, swings and releases the chunk - but a nat 1 on that! - hits a building on the canyon; it clips it and the rock doesn't reach the bridge. And at *that* point Temo calls out, "It wasn't trying to stop the riders. It was trying to destroy the bridge!"

Riglan runs forward to get a better look at the movement he saw; up the road, Ushien's horse rears up and she swings it aside; she calls out "Flank! Flank" and the knights split left and right. From the keep a strange, large, collection of limbs is thundering down - 10ft tall abomination, melding of flesh; a construct. Riglan calls to the gem spirit - "Attack that!" and the dragon dives in. He then looks to scan elsewhere for threats to the bridge. A drake! Well - it used to be... It is undead. It takes flight. Damn, we didn't know about those!

It lands on a rubble area to the west, picks up a chunk of building and starts flapping slowly to take off. Riglan shouts, "Drake! There!" pointing. He briefly considers turning into a flying animal but has nothing that looks powerful enough to pose a real threat so instead runs into a line of sight position (survival 18, runs around a corner to get there), with the drake apparently struggling to lift off; he grabs the lighting wand and fires. It can't dodge - it's too overloaded (dex save nat 1!) and takes 30 damage which seems to affect it as expected - for once, no resistance - but it does *not* flinch. It just keeps going, despite its burning flesh.

Temo - intelligence-based perception check on the bridge, 27. He figures out that where the army ends and illusions begin. We need to buy another 20 or 30 seconds (technically 4 rounds!). Oof. Hard work. He's got a drake or an ogre. The ogre hasn't picked up any debris yet, but the drake isn't in range so he calls out "anyone else able to take the drake?" and aims gets ready to fire at the ogre once again. As he's doing this the dragon is attacking the golem thing! It takes 8*2->16 damage from the breath weapon - ah, vulnerability to radiant! - but the flailing, "incorrectly bending" limbs make the rend harder to get; it hits just once, wildly missing the second time (nat 1) for minimum damage on the first attack (10).

Temo just (2,5+11->16) gets a hit on the ogre as he fires. A lower 35 damage this time. This gets its attention! It turns and heads for Temo.

Maireagh has spent her time getting up the main street, and finally gets within range of the golem as the knights split off either side. Hit, *crit*; 12 damage, 19 damage. The dog has a go too, getting in a hit which does 9 more damage. Bits of the golem have fallen off.

* Nethza has headed off with the army, keeping watch.
* The drake continues flapping towards the bridge.
* The flesh golem attacks the dragon. It has fewer than 40hp but d6 -> it "does not go beserk", says the DM! It took radiant damage; so has trouble attacking for a while. Its bizarre flailing limbs lash out. It misses twice (the second time critically).
* The ogre zombie is charging at Temo now. It picks up and flings a rock at Temo, who deftly dodges it what would've been 10 bludgeoning damage.

Riglan runs to get range and line-of-sight and fires at the drake again. Potential damage this time only 24; it takes all of it. It's getting close to the bridge so Riglan is forced to call the spirit dragon for help. He's seen Maireagh over there, she's fine `;-)`

The dragon turns around and promptly flies for the drake - opp attack from the golem - misses; shame we can't get the breath weapon on this again but orders are orders. It gets within 90ft and uses the breath weapon; 7 radiant (14 taken); and in fact is just with 10ft for its rend attacks too, both hitting, 25 total damage. That's enough! The 'stitched together' drake is ripped apart; part of its body and the masonry crash down on top of building, sending some chunks of stone flying onto the main street and bridge, with some dodging required! At least it didn't get within range. Riglan calls out "Thank you, back to protecting the knights and air support please".

Temo is not impressed at the ogre - and as he tends to do, stands his ground, aims and fires once more. He doesn't think he's close to taking it down but doesn't have a choice. Hits, for a solid 39 damage. To his surprise the arrow lands *right* between the eyes; the ogre's momentum keeps it running for a moment before it face-plants down, sliding along the ground; magic that was animating it seems to leave it instantly; the body turns grey, slumps and immediately starts to turn putrid.

Maireagh is raging at the flesh golem. "You're ugly! What are you?! You're an abomination!" - two hits with the hammer for 17, 20 damage - this is enough! Good work; it collapses. She asks the dog to run to find Ushien as she takes back to the skies.

Seconds later, the last of the army races over the bridge. Riglan sees, emerging from a courtyard in the keep, a crackling lightning sparking up. The sky turns dark as if a storm builds. *Levitating* - hovering upwards - appears **Azalin himself**. He looks coldly at the group gathered below. "You have ridden to your death today!" he says - somehow everyone can hear him clearly - and his staff twists; his eyes flare with a purple light; one of the ends of the two-headed staff starts to produce ember sparks. He looks up. In the cloud above, red glows start. Riglan heads Temo shouting, "Meteor storm! Look to the sky!" off to his right. *Some* of the army hear, at least. Unfortunately the army just scatters in the streets, regiments broken, but the meteor storm seems focused on the bridge mostly. The first row of buildings on the north side are obliterated; all on the south side too; and the bridge itself crumbles and falls in a deafening roar of falling rock and meteors.

But now there's an illusory army riding in mid-air...

...a snarl on Azalin's face! He prepares another spell. Riglan looks over to Temo and shouts, "We probably have to hang around to see if we can see if we can help but probably find that cellar?!" so Temo says, "Right-o!" - Azalin is well over 200ft away and hovering high. For all we know it might even just be a projection. Riglan runs up the main street trying to find Maireagh, but calling for Nethza.

Temo tries to make sense of this small town and figure out where a tavern might be. He knows cities. Investigation - nat 18+15 -> a whopping 33. A tavern for general use wouldn't be behind the keep's defence walls. You'd want to be close to the main street. A *seedy* tavern would be far away, closer to docks. Where would docks be? The East - the least protected, out of the way, closer to the sea and the river. Maybe it's a double bluff? You'd expect smuggling and crime in the docks. But high value stuff, paying off the right people? You'd do that in full view - hide in a crowd - and he makes the guess that it's a reputable place. He chases after Riglan, up the main street.

Riglan realises that Nethza's gone East. Maireagh's gone West. Riglan races East. He calls after Nethza - "is there *anything* you've got which can counter Azalin?" as he catches up. "Not at this range!" "Then we make for the cellar! Temo was back on the main street." "Where's Maireagh?" and Riglan says, "Chased Ushien, the other way..."

...and then there are sudden gasps from soldiers nearby. Nethza flies up and looks horrified; a choking; people are running our way from side streets, holding throats. Some horrible poison. A necrotic mist is flowing down from the courtyard above. Riglan tries Dispel Magic, check is only 15; he's not able to get the dispel effect too far away but can do it nearby to try and protect the people around (120ft range). Some of the mist dissipates but it just flows back in. No good. Survival, 21, he needs to get people away; he shouts, "Run into buildings and up stairs! The mist flows low!" - he follows his own advice as Nethza continues to float upwards.

"He's getting away" he hears Nethza calling. Riglan opens a window and shouts after her, "Cellar! Stick to the plan! Find Temo, get him to sound the horn!" - he also sees that Azalin has floated up to a balcony with open windows near the top of the keep. Temo hears Nethza calling; perception 23; it's coming from high up. He looks up; he also sees mist flowing down; sees people running into buildings shouting about running upstairs. As he does so himself, he seems two Knights Of Samilar paladin calling around him, "on me, on me!" as people crowd around; they hold holy symbols, raise shields and an aura of purity forces the mist away. Temo sees Azalin in the distance heading to the keep. He gets up a couple of floors, looks out a window, sees Nethza and shouts to Nethza; she comes into the building and tells him to sound the horn to get everyone together. Maireagh's separated.

He also tries a cantrip; Message to Maireagh; "Regrouping for cellar!" "We're all huddled against the knights!" He casts again, "Second floor of a building. Riglan nearby. I'll sound the horn to guide you here as soon as the mist is clear." He looks for Azalin; he's gone inside. No sign.

It seems like an eternity for the mist to clear - really just a few seconds. In that time, there are strange creaking and groaning sounds. Thudding. Something coming. A clamour in the streets. The mist is clearing, so we run down. Soldiers are emerging onto the streets; the knights are back on the main street, others with them; behind the cover of the mist, the gates to the keep were opened (now shutting again) to allow a very large army of undead which is spilling out to the city. At least 500.

Temo sounds the horn.

Riglan meanwhile is descending the building, gets down and is about 25ft from the main street. He pushes through to see what's coming - and sees this big collection of almost on-top-of-each-other set of undead, overflowing... It would be perfect, except the allies are in the way, as they stand fast to try and tackle the undead. He hears Temo's horn blast. Insight 22. The spell could take out 150-200 undead pretty much straight away. That would leave 9000-odd undead, assuming *we* have to deal with them after Azalin.

This could be a long fight. He can't assume these creatures will all drop when Azalin falls. Besides, he might end up upcasting something else into that power while battling Azalin - so he regretfully is forced to turn, and run for Temo's location based on the horn sound.

(That was not an easy choice to make).

Maireagh is already fighting her way through undead at the point the horn sounds! Temo Messages again and she in no uncertain terms informs him (!). Temo Messages back "We'll come to you!" "No. I'm fine!" So, Temo shrugs and says to Nethza, "I think Maireagh's enjoying herself" - Nethza flies up and starts throwing out blasts. In between messages, Temo has burned his Melf's Minute Meteor's spell! He's been throwing them into the zombie cluster closest to the now-closed gates, to keep clear of allies.

Riglan has told the dragon to engage the zombies - it uses breath cones in strafe after strafe pass. He asks it to keep going as long as it can. He catches up with Temo; Nethza in the air, Temo says "Maireagh's on her way but I've not found it yet! The mist happened!" - then adds - "I'll be back!" goes invisible and uses this to aid him in avoiding enemies and friends as he dodges around the main street checking buildings. Investigation, nat 19+15->34. He'll find it for sure, but it still takes time.

Meanwhile, the rest of us are now facing oncoming zombies. Nethza and Maireagh resume flight. She instructs the dog to guard Riglan, and Riglan starts throwing flames out (almost any of his linear or large area effect spells are useless, frustratingly, because of mixed-in allies in the melee and he wants to hold concentration on the dragon). It's annoying - he'd dialled in spells for the big army but can't use any of them due to any number of constraints on how things are laid out right now.

Maireagh sees undead spilling down the 10-15ft wide main street. She casts a web across the buildings to try and slow them down.

Temo is checking buildings; not a tavern... Not a tavern... goes back through the army, diving between legs, to the other side; ah! This is a tavern... Tries to find a cellar; a tap room has a small basement, but it's in disrepair with broken stairs... ACRO 21. It's easy enough to get down there. But no tunnel; or if there was one, it's long gone. Was he wrong about the main street theory? There are other places to check. He gets back up. He hopes it's not on the "wrong side" of the undead!

He wriggles out of a cellar window on the way up, so now he's behind the main battle and sees a building with a once-beautiful sign, very clearly a tavern and inn, but this is on a side street. Spidey sense. He runs over to look. Door locked; someone cared. SOH 34, it's unlocked in a second (two locks!) - dusty inside, but intact and didn't fall into direct disrepair, it seems, before being locked up. The bar is fully stocked! Private rooms, heavy velvet curtains, some kind of VIP area but he's looking behind the bar - stairs - down he goes.

Oil-soaked torches hang in sconces. That's actually a little disturbing - this might be in *recent* use. We might have to watch out for people in the tunnels. He's holding his sling but keeps running down. There's a store room at the back of the cellar behind another door and it's not subtle - a cabinet has obvious obvious scrape marks on the floor (to his eyes). There's a circle where a rug would be and the rug is rolled up, pushed against the wall. That's odd. Examines the floor. The rug was carefully rolled to not damage it. It would hide the scrape marks, of course, but interfere with the mechanism. Some areas have dust, but the circle is quite clean. Recent.

He trusts his instincts and doesn't open it now, but Messages Riglan - "Found it. Beware, currently in use. I will come to you, it's on the wrong side of the street!" and starts running back to the group.

The zombie hoard is being held at bay for now. Spirits are surprisingly high because of it, but clouds above continue to gather. The dragon flies up to strafe at one point, but is struck by lightning; 18 damage, leaving it with 35hp. And another drake flies up. And another! They're headed for the dragon and fly in to attack. Riglan calls to it, "Defend yourself!" - it flies West to try and draw them away from the main battle, and it's out of range for lightning bolts.

Suddenly, a hail of arrows flies up from the battlements. In the distance, Ushien's voice; "Shields up! Arrows!" - a few members of the army are struck. The zombies use the opportunity to break through the webs and advance. Archers line up on the battlements again and notch arrows; then Riglan loses his connection to the dragon; it's down. A loud booming noise; flying the West, balls of fire. Confusing. They crash into the battlements - oh, they're on our side! **Cormyr!** They smash into the citadel and drakes. Nethza flies up to get a look; she shouts, "Yes!" elated. Another volley, this time magical flaming arrows raining down on the keep. A familiar sounding distant clarion call.

That changes the dynamic. Immediate confusion in our enemies, battling on two fronts. Ushien's paladins capitalise on this and charge forward, cutting through the zombie hoard.

Riglan can't see a thing! He calls to Nethza, "Would another dragon help?!" but she calls down, "...I think we we've done our bit..." and he calls up, "Yes, Temo's found it, he's on his way back to us" - and at this moment, Temo appears. "What's going on?!" he shouts. "Cormyr! The main army. Time to go. MAIREAGH!" she flies down - "it's glorious!" she shouts. "Follow Temo! Quick!"; Nethza sends another volley out then follows as we dash across the street and are led to the side street. Temo points - "Bar, stairs, down, door back, careful" and lets them lead, then just before he dives down - Message to Ushien:

* **"We must go below for Azalin now. Good hunting. The names of the knights of Samilar will ring through history!"**
* **"Go well, brave knight. This tyranny ends one way or another today. See you on the others side."**

Temo runs down to catch up. Everyone's in the back room. He puts his finger to his lips, then as quietly as he can, investigates the mechanism. A classic. One book stands out - a bit more handled, a bit less dust. A catch behind. He activates the switch; click; the cabinet swings out a bit and he pulls it as quietly as he can to open it fully. It reaches a point where it'd scrape the floor at the scratch; it's open enough so he stops there. We all squeeze inside and he pulls it shut behind, but just shy of latching.

Temo looks around. Nice! A purpose-built smuggling tunnel. A current of air, fetid smell. Less nice.

Riglan pauses. "Two months of all this, that's all. A bit longer for Nethza, in the Shadowfell... Either way, it feels like half a lifetime. So let's end it today."

He snaps out of the reverie. Then he remembers what he *really* mean to say - 10,000 undead wouldn't fit in that keep. They must be somewhere else. Points at the tunnel. "That's where I'd put them."

We're on alert.

Riglan casts Darkvision. Temo dons his goggles. Maireagh uses her vision device to give See Invisibility to everyone - even the dog. Temo says, "Here goes nothing!" and leads the way. Adv survival - 18,19+1->20. He's sure of his way - it's a tunnel but not the underdark; this is a city and a smuggler's tunnel. Not his first rodeo!

After a while, we figure we are under the main battle above. We're not very deep down. Low ceilings; Riglan is bowed over. We can feel and hear heavy thuds and crashes from above sometimes.

Temo darts down the tunnel, almost outpacing us - then the hairs on the back of his neck rise as his sling starts to give a note of caution. Danger. Not imminent, but a warning. He holds up a hand, to signal behind, and slows right now. Ahead, the tunnel turns abruptly to the right. He reaches the edge, and peers around the corner. About 5ft more tunnel then an open room, that drops down like a big cistern. He approaches cautiously. Sling hums louder. He wonders about a garbage eating monster... Checks; perception 27. He can see up, grates, a storm drain - fortunately not a latrine! - with a 30ft drop below, quite sizeable. It is filled with maybe two layers of undead. Just down there, writing around. Waiting. Occasionally looking up. They look like they could climb up and out easily enough. There are two other entrance tunnels he can see, well, more like channels really, not big, which he figures are all part of a - well hopefully! - storm water system. Perhaps the undead could push through there too. Our tunnel isn't as deep down. Through the grate he can see footfall, things moving around. Lots, shuffling; more undead probably. It's outdoors, a courtyard.

He withdraws and whispers a summary to the others. Undead below, undead above, waiting; if we could take them out in a big bang it'd certainly help the army but it's still only - well, he thinks; INT-based insight; only 14; maybe 100 undead, hard to count the layers.

Temo checks his scrolls. Wall Of Sand - 30x10x10 wall max, and we're looking at a 30x30 space with unknown depth (but 10ft is as good a guess as any!). Too big a room for the spell. Fog Cloud won't stop them moving but is a low-resource way of stopping them seeing us, but we still need a way to climb up and out. A fireball might fill the pit? We kick around options. The Nethza tell us to hide back around the corner. We don't ask questions and just do it! A sudden sickly green light shining dimly from around the corner; she's backed right up to the wall herself at the junction; lots of gurgling and gasping sounds; she keeps it going for a good 30 seconds or more... Shielding her eyes she tries to look; "I think the coast is clear...?"

Temo says - "...What was *THAT*?" "A form of sickening radiant light. I've never used it before! It's a form of radiant damage, so good for undead." It's a big spell though.

Temo is able to make a better inspection now. The ground of the cistern area is covered in ash! No bodies. Handholds here and there. They don't look too strong - Riglan might have an issue. Once up them, he'd get to a grating and could open it from below by pushing, hopefully. If locked from above - mage hand. We head down quietly so that we can assess above. No rungs go up to the grating though. Just to the other tunnels / channels. Temo's sense of direction tells him that one channel heads North, towards the keep; we've not gone far enough yet. He quietly just points and heads that way, so we follow.

Riglan needs to crouch right down now. Even Nethza's finding it cramped. There are branches on either side; same size, and after passing a couple, he asks people to wait while he investigates one to see if it goes anywhere. Another reservoir - full of undead.

He gets back and explains. "Well, we know where they all are! And they can spring up into the midst of battle at any time." Temo, tries Message just on a whim to Ushien in case she's close by. He knows roughly where the main battle *was* at least. He says, "Hidden undead in storm water reservoir network below the streets. Beware storm water drains from which they may exit." "A little busy but appreciate the intel! Will warn people and find way to barricade!" - it worked!

We carry on Northwards. Quietly. We are soon out range of Message to Ushien.

The storm drain affair ends; we emerge into an area with access hatches, presumably for maintenance, that - we check - lead into an underground level of some kinds; full size stone passages, walled, various walkways, holders for sconces. Interestingly the storm drains slope gently *towards* the cisterns, and to a degree the keep. We've ended up lower than we started - maybe 20ft down, perhaps deeper. They seem to mostly trace a path that Temo suspects would be *around* the edges of the keep, but he sees a large maintenance hatch in one particular wall that's closed, as we head East, on a North-facing wall. Quietly! He puts his ear to it and listens. Perception 15. Nothing. Gently tries to open it; there's a rotating metal wheel that opens it. It's not locked, but stiff, then he suddenly stops; traps! Check it... Nope, perception 26, it's just rusted. Riglan helps open it.

This area is strange. We're looking into what looks like an open, central space, but there are walls and sloping buttresses, plinths, struts and supports, that go down to rest against the wall from which we emerge. Temo doesn't understand (history 11) but asks Maireagh, since it's construction and stone. That makes it adv history, nat 20! 25. Ah! The structure is some kind of gallery, a square made of a "tunnel", that in fact goes around a large, deep, empty space - maybe 15ft gap and deeper than he can see - but the walls below appear to slope inwards at a steep diagonal, buttressed, at once holding the walls we're on upright and supporting plinths and pillars upon which stands a central building within this deep gap. And that building is the lower levels of the keep itself, curiously supported in this strange, deep, space. Maireagh says it's very strange - not at all a strong way to support a keep! It's almost fragile; potentially unstable.

Riglan tries throwing a flame down into the dark to see if he can see a bit more of what's below. He does at least see the bottom of the space. The keep is a free-standing structure, supported by all the strange stonework around. It rests on pillars. Riglan insight 13; no idea why!

There is an unmaintained catwalk / set of walkways that provide access to the stonework of the keep itself, but they're in bad shape. This implies that they are a way to gain access, but we can't see entrances at the termination of any of the catwalks. We can only see a small amount from this one maintenance access hatch, so we begin to work our way around the "gallery" to see if there are any other similar hatches. As we're doing this, Temo finds stairs that lead up and suggests that perhaps those are the way to go. We note the location but keep exploring to see if there's anything else of interest down here.

There are no other such hatches, unfortunately. But we do find that this gallery area has a *lot* of tunnels and passageways leading away that access an entire subterranean level of Zhentil Keep. Other basements of buildings, probably; other cisterns; who knows what. It has a kind of Underdark vibe - a city beneath the city. The tavern's cellar access suddenly seems rather less surprising!

We head back to where Temo saw stairs and make our way up, quietly. The quiet of thick stone and earth above gives way to hearing the noises of the surface. We enter some kind of cellar immediately below street level and the sling gives all the usual warnings. Danger everywhere. He points at it and shrugs! The only other exit is upwards. If we go up, that'll be the courtyard outside the keep. He investigates other options - 31 - definitely nothing hidden in the walls.

So we've got one access hatch, crumbling walkways that don't seem to give access, this weird cellar, a lot of tunnels leading away and a keep that sort of floats atop fragile supports, clearly designed that way, for reasons unknown.

Temo says to the group that he's going to have risk it - he's the lightest and most agile - he wants to go onto the catwalk. Riglan suggests he keeps an eye out for magic. It's an eternity for Temo to ritual-cast that in the midst of battle. Riglan relents; he's going to have to do it and wildshape into something good with the dark and flyable. Owl, clearly. So he casts Detect Magic and turns into an owl. Temo insists on coming to help.

Riglan adv perception: 11,11->21; Temo history, 11+6->15.

Between the two - we first of all *do* find an entrance from one of the catwalks around another side of the keep. Presumably that's to maintain things if you're already *inside* the keep. But with Detect Magic, Riglan sees more interesting things; magic seems to be imbued into runes, so he flies in closer; to his surprise, these are in Giant, which he can read. They are runes of power. Powered by magic. They are being charged at the moment. Magic flows into it. There's enough there already for him to detect. He looks closer - **it's almost finished, maybe 90% done** but he doesn't know how long that last 10% would take.

**This flies. They're cloud runes.**

Yet it's not giant construction; it's not on that scale. It's stolen magic, in a way. He could almost be angry, but he's distracted by the epiphany. **That's why Azalin comes here.** It's not for the graveyard. It's for a flying fortress and wage war from the skies. No problems traversing the Anauroch or going over mountain ranges, and almost impossible to attack.

We go back to the others. Temo says we found a door. Riglan flies out and back a few times indicating "we should go". Nethza and Maireagh climb through the hatch - they have Fly up; Nethza's still got it from earlier. Not been an hour yet.

At the door, Temo checks for traps and locks. It's locked from within. SOH 16+16->32, no problem! It's just a latch, actually, almost boring. The door swings inwards and Temo creeps in first; **he's in the keep**. "Feels like" third floor down. A short corridor, 30ft, a corner at the end. Various discarded tools at the edge. Perception 14, he doesn't see much so creeps forward to investigate the tools - he almost trips over a dead body, decomposed to the point of being a skeleton, leaning, looking as if it were trying to reach the door - but it had been crushed by equipment that fell on it. Strange way to go!

He beckons the others in. Inside, Riglan turns into himself, then hurriedly whisper the info about this being flying to the others. *That* changes the game a lot. Maireagh's face goes dark... "How do we stop that from happening?" "Disrupt the energy flow, the spell somehow; destroy the foundations before it finishes maybe, try to bring the whole place down; but you've seen the scale of it. I was thinking of learning Earthquake this morning, but I don't think it'd be enough and would certainly bring Azalin's army down on our heads even if it might succeed." "Can we destroy the runes?" "I could - if I could get out there - melt the stone again; I'd have to use a more powerful spell to do it, and could only destroy a certain area. It might not be enough. But it could be worth a go. Otherwise, we're out there with hammer and chisel for a few hours!"

Riglan figures that this is what Azalin is doing differently this time. Last time, he did all the same moves and the armies took him down. Why repeat it? Because this time, he's getting the keep in the air first. That's why he strangely retreated into the keep after only casting a couple of spells before; he could've crushed us, but didn't.

The cistern undead may even be sacrificial - just a distraction, to keep people away while this flies. And then he's untouchable - Cormyr and Cormanthor stood there on the ground, unable to touch him.

We have to prioritise the runes.

Nethza says, "But without Azalin, would this citadel be of any use?" and Riglan answers, "Fair point and if he did retreat back inside it implies he needs to pay attention for this magic to work - it's something someone else is taking care of entirely without him."

Riglan insight 17+10. There have been a number of interactions with Azalin. The feelings are approaching hatred, but there must be a certain twisted respect for the sheer power and the intelligence and planning here, the discipline of it. But Azalin is very power hungry. A despot. "Something as crucial as flying the citadel - Azalin would do it himself. Perhaps the ritual could be done by any of the 'right' mages, but he'd want control of it all. He wouldn't want anyone else to, even briefly, have access to control of this place before handing it over to him. A lack of trust in part."

"So if we get rid of him, this citadel doesn't go anywhere" says Nethza.

"But if we can't defeat him, there's a plan B; destroy these runes, as best we can" says Maireagh.

Nethza says, "Or we draw him out - force him to confront us. Can you think of a more sure-fire way to get his attention than melting some of the runes?"

Maireagh asks where the runes are. Riglan describes the number and placement as best he can; 8 runes, two per side. Marieagh says that the placement indicates of the runes are all to do with balancing the castle to fly. So if you take a chunk out of a side, it causes trouble. Remove one, probably dodgy but OK. Two, next to each other; almost certainly too much damage."

The smallest spacing between two runes was about 30-40ft, where two are close on adjacent corners.

Riglan shrugs. "We don't know how long until this ritual completes. We don't know for sure if taking out runes will draw Azalin away. But we lack the luxury of time, and I do think on balance that runes are one way or another our biggest issue. So, I'll have to risk it. I need to get to a corner, and blow a big melt spell to destroy two of those runes. Maireagh, are you able to survey the catwalks to see if there's a strongest path? She answers, "I can do one better! Why don't I just get you flying?" "Can you spare the magic?" "Yes, I can." "That'll do it! But we need to bear in mind - once I do this, Azalin is likely to be down here, in this confined space, with the big drop outside, very quickly." "Then we need to pick a place to confront him. He'll be looking for us."

Nethza says - no, we're not splitting up. We must be together. They'll wait at this door. "I have - I have had a nightmare, that we were facing him alone. That is one of my deepest fears."

"So..." says Riglan, "...I'll fly out, take out the runes, fly right back, and what - we run down this corridor and keep going until we find somewhere with a bit more space, or he finds us? Kind of all we've got, right?"

People nod.

Riglan hesitates; "This is it then. Somehow I thought we'd creep around in this place and find him and there'd be this big showdown... But instead... Well, Maireagh - cast your spell."

Riglan starts to fly. "This'll take only a few seconds."

He flies out, and positions Transmute Rock to melt a great 40x40ft cube on the corner of the keep, catching buttresses and pillars below as well as a big corner of the building itself, completely obliterating two runes; he flies right back, and says, "RUN!" as behind him, a whole section of the keep sloughs away - but Riglan's accidentally caught the area we're in at the edge so the others are *well* ahead of him, as the corridor was starting to melt.

We get around the corner quickly enough, stairs, safe ground now; then for Temo and Maireagh there's a really unnerving feeling as at first it's like being dizzy - but then he realises it's the ground tilting. "We're tipping over!" says Temo - "You might've done too good a job!"

It'll get his attention at least.

Cracking and dull thuds start to sound as things shudder around us. We get up another flight of stairs, along a corridor and Temo spots to the left a large central space - he shouts, "In there! Big room!"

We run / fly in - and to our surprise, we see a circle of nine undead casters, some which we recognise as generals and one who we recognise as a Shadowfell vampire from his domain, but Azalin is *not* here. We decide against engaging with *nine* of these things at once and without saying a word do a 180 to leave the room; as we turn, Temo sees some sort of grand entrance to another space, on the right; so he points and runs for it, we follow. Nethza turns and throws Darkness at the casters to try and cover our escape, but the lack of any shouting or movement in Riglan's peripheral vision makes *him* wonder that they're so focused they can't react - he hears chanting, and it continues uninterrupted.

Oh, right, of course - a grand entrance. This is actually the main entrance to the keep itself. Double doors, closed, stairs curving up on either side. Undead soldiers are present; they react instantly when we run in. This foyer area is still very close to the ritual casters and if Azalin battled us here, he could call on them and they'd be upon us in an instant, so we try to flee and run up the stairs.

Riglan and Nethza are airborne, but Temo (ACRO 21), Maireagh (brute forcing it, throwing her hammer out as she goes at the closest chasing undead!) and the dog are on foot. Nethza and Riglan get up ahead and wait briefly, as Temo jumps and runs up on the banisters to avoid the undead; the dog waves between legs to distract people; it takes them a few seconds to get clear of the mess while Riglan throws fire and Nethza throws blasts. Other undead are coming up the other stairs; but we're just ahead, now, rejoined as a group, a long corridor ahead, and more stairs leading further up.

Temo remembers that Azalin was in a room near the top. So he runs down the corridor - into what appears to be a throne room. Side galleries along the way are full of undead, swarming now. In the throne room, more undead of course, just hanging out (!); the throne dais is unoccupied. Floor to ceiling glass-paned doors on either side of the room lead onto terraces. Riglan and Nethza now *see* curtains aren't lying flat against the windows; there's a visible list, in fact some of the undead seem to have some movement problems.

"I might have overdone it" shouts Riglan. "But where do we go? Too many undead..." - he's interrupted by a grinding crunching noise; then the listing stops. The keep must have fallen against still-rock "something" enough to temporarily halt. The tilt is signifiant - about 10-12 degrees.

At the high ground around the throne, Maireagh has her shield and hammer, ready to fight. 20 undead nearby, 24 running our way. Nethza shouts, "Are we holding our ground?" and Riglan - seeing no other exits - says, "Looks like, I'd have preferred to waste less time on undead, but for all we know it's even more swarming higher up" - Maireagh shouts, "enough talking, smash things!" and starts fighting. Nethza starts swinging her blade, Temo's shooting arrows... Riglan decides - this is the time. He casts Giants Insects - there are a very large number of them on the undead bodies around! He is going to get 10 centipedes but they're too small, so picks spiders instead - the poison won't do much but the webs will and they'll be distraction. Does only mean 3. He asks them to web the entrance initially, to stop anymore undead getting in (or slow them down). He activates his staff; then from that point on, just throws flames, every few seconds another thrown. We're trying to be a bit careful and conserve resources for Azalin; it's methodical, and it's enough. Nethza can send out eldritch blasts all day long and keeps swinging; Maireagh is concentrating on Riglan's fly, which helps him a lot with getting line of sight and focusing on the closest creature, but she's focusing on the webs and spiders in case those are overrun and the undead pour through - she can conjure a barrage at that point.

At one moment Riglan says, "If I need to do sunburst you'd all be caught, so we'd need some place to shelter behind - it's just light, it doesn't go around corners". "Jump behind the throne" says Maireagh. "That'll do it!"

And so, we keep going. There's a rhythm. For a moment, it's almost zen. We're getting rid of them.

But then Temo gets a feeling... ...WIS save - nat 20! 26. He feels he can choose to fail; a scrying eye is trying to find him. He shouts out "Azalin's to scry our location, I think sooner rather than later given all the undead...!" and lets the spell succeed. We all have See Invisibility and see that same scrying eye we've seen before. Temo waves cheerily at it, then aims and fires, taking down another undead. The eye darts around, looking at the room. Then it fades away. We all brief meet each other's gaze - **it's down to the last few seconds**.

Carving through and destroying two of the giant spiders in one swing, a Skeletal Knight appears - a paladin of sorts, ash-black armour, black bat wing style helmet, dark steel sword, blade covered in spider blood. It focuses on the third spider.

OK, so we've got a distraction before Azalin, it seems!

(END OF PART 3.22 - Part 3.23 next)
