# Riglan: Part 3.15
## Day 37 (Selgaunt)

(After a dream - see end of part 3.14).

Riglan is relieved to see Temo back to his old self, after the vampire encounter.

In the morning we check in with Loic and ask if he knows where Myraros (Ordulin speakers) takes lunch, as we might try our luck there. "Possibly... I think so..." and gives us a tavern name. We ask if Loic wants to come with or we could go solo. "If you are comfortable striking up the conversation on your own platform, that might be safer! There are no political 'contamination' for your cause."

Loic also points us at the parcel which arrived the previous night - it's the map and notes from the Third Speaker's Assistant. We'll take those and collate everything with Matthew at the Senator's Lounge.

After breakfast, over which Riglan describes his dream as best he can (in case any of it turns out to be important some time) we head out. It'll be another morning of watching Forum machinations - tedious, but important to understand the process.

Loic says he enjoys the walk to senate, brief though it is; he takes a slightly longer route. "The morning air is always fresh, and it gives me a chance to think".

### 8am

In forum, Temo tries to ask the right questions about speakers in the gallery - wisdom-based persuasion, 21. He identifies the members of the Ordulin block and the Old Republic block. The Old Republic and older Ordulin members are of particular interest as they might simply hate Cormyr enough to fight against *anything* involving them.

Temo also identifies a small faction in senate that seem more martial - more militaristic. They're trying to get a bill through that's related to military academy funding, but it is defeated - we get the impression that there's very little military thinking in Sembia! Another group are essentially oligarchs, representing the interests of some of the richest trading houses and merchant families of Sembia. *That* goes through. We're not too sure what we think of that.

### 9am

After the reading of the ballots, we head to the Senator's Lounge and catch up with Matthew, passing on the notes and map to help him collate what amounts to evidence. He needs to know what exactly he's drafting - he'll figure out the wording, it's just the direction.

Yhaunn's sea topographic maps are here too. We don't have cartography specialism but Temo is smart (flat intelligence 11+4 -> 15). It makes sense to him a bit - Yhaunn is a port city, with the deepest natural harbour in the whole of Sembia. It seems to be one side of what looks like perhaps a submerged, collapsed volcanic crater. This is perhaps why Azalin didn't go to Yhaunn directly before - it's not an easy approach. The shallowest approach with an incline onto land is the delta of the river Ashara. The river we're told has shifted course northwards, with now a wide alluvial fan of rich farmland spreading south. So Azalin might well head North of Yhaunn again, but could come up over quite a wide area of the delta.

The north bank is steep as the river has cut under there, depositing its fan to the south, so they're likely to come out on the South bank - which would lead him to a bridge on the road between Ordulin and Essembra. The river and bridge mark the Sembian border.

We'd hoped to perhaps keep Azalin's forces closer to the sea, moving Northwards near the cost, to avoid widespread damage to the Cormanthor forests. This looks like very unlikely given the area topography and lack of (almost) any armed support in this area.

The topographic map is for the Sea of Fallen Stars only, and doesn't extend up to the Moonsea. Lucy still hasn't heard back about the people checking older reports for "unusual" things. The paperwork from the Third Speaker helps a lot too, making it even more clear what kind of reports are of interest. Checking them now, we read that there are newer reports from areas North of Yhaunn and even some reports of a strange corruption from people heading from Ordulin towards Cormanthor. So, the corruption has spread from the East side of the Dragon Reach, to the West.

**We suspect an advance part of more than just the vampire general in this region.**

With all that, we can give Matthew some fairly good indications of locations and pinpoint. We pull together the paperwork and try to make a simple collection that can be presented along with the ballot, as well as Temo spending time to learn it, so he can Minor Illusion the important things while we present from the floor. Our main points then, are:

* Be the warning beacon
* Attempt evacuations along the expected route so Azalin has fewer corpses to add to his army
* Cormyr's warning is more of a call to arms
* Cormanthor's warning is more of a call to run!
* Perhaps Sembia's own military can take the role of watchpeople along the coast and route to keep an eye on Azalin and the progress

It takes hours. They pass swiftly.

### 12pm

The senate has broken for lunch and we make haste to the tavern Loic indicated, where Myraros might be going. It's not a tavern really, "**The Book And Candle**"; it's more of a rather old school inn, at least in vibe! We head in, and up two flights of stairs since the ground floors is apparently a book shop and there's just a door saying "private" off the first floor, so we get to the public dining area is - we want to see if Myraros is around, having seen him on the senate floor previously. There are lots of small booths and a large dining area. A big hanging fireplace made of metal hangs impressively in the middle of the room. The kitchen is off to one side, through another door. There's no bar, which is part of why it feels more like an inn dining room than a tavern.

Temo tries to go about things above-board, dissuading Riglan from stalking around as a spider or something! He finds the maitre de and - persuasion 16+15->31! - hears that people had already warned him that we might be looking for Myraros. Trouble is, he's downstairs in a private room. Makes sense if you don't want to be bothered by the likes of us! She says that the best she can think of is to give us a neighbouring dining room, then we just have to figure out how to get to talk to him ourselves without causing trouble. OK then! That's the plan.

She suggests that the staff might accidentally leave the cart of food unattended briefly in the hall - we could maybe masquerade as a server to get into the room...? Temo suggests perhaps the ol' switcharoo - food is delivered to wrong rooms, unless that gets anyone into trouble, but we'll compensate financially. We can then take our "wrong" food next door.

It's agreed. We pay 4gp for our private room with food (whether or not we eat it) and head down to floor one; we're shown into our room. Eventually the 'wrong' food arrives so the game is afoot and Temo without hesitation grabs his plate, says "well, come on then!" and leads the way to next door. He politely knocks on the door.

(Temo tries to be surprised about Myraros being present - CHA based stealth form of deception, 25). They've started eating, but really they're here not for private business but more for just general privacy, and we end up being invited to share the room - plenty of space - and sharing all the food.

Temo's angle is to try and "ask for advice" about the ballot and the "sensitive" issue of Cormyr. With a bit of luck he remembers (history 7+5 plus proficiency bonus 5, allowed by DM for this *specific* kind of history, but then with luck, 20+5+5). Gives him advantage on persuading Myraros to open up; sadly only 8,5, so with RT., 10+15->25. At least this gets some information about the Ordulin Block:

"...the coastal cities who are sort of the 'new guard' really do not remember or understand that Sembia had to fight for independence. They've never had to fight - always been on the coast with plenty of Sembian land and citizenry between them and neighbouring countries. Ordulin and the Western reaches have always been on the front lands. Before the demilitarisation, Ordulin used to patrol the river and river crossings. There's some resentment of the older senators - many remember or have families who remember the demilitarisation, which happened after the risen Netheril taken over Sembia."

If there was a way to frame the bill that funding to reinstate the military - they're on payroll within Ordulin as an 'expanded watch' already - they'd be happy to support it! (We recognise echoes of the bill we saw defeated this morning).

So plan forms in our minds as he speaks:

* Military can help patrol the river and crossings - as they once did (appeal to Ordulin Block) - but also as long as the Cormyr army doesn't march through their lands, they won't oppose it
* News of this rising threat is *already* in the West and whether the senate believes us or not, they are already nervous and this threatens trade; proactive action by the Senate will help increase confidence (appeal to oligarchs)
* Be a beacon of light and hope, be the warning for all, help mobilise, be the place that everyone remembers started the movement to defeat Azalin (appeal to the current Senate - nationalist tendencies)

Reading between the lines, we all probably know what's going on now. It's an exchange of understanding outside the halls of power - essentially, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours". But that works for us. It's not entirely above board, but it's not illegal in these parts either. Even Temo is OK with it.

With the usual pleasantries over, we head off.

We have some time to kill. What about the rings and strange collar from the vampires - maybe Clockmaker's Alley might have metallurgists, or arcanists? We head there. Investigation 25 via RT. Temo points out a place that Maireagh thinks probably does have true artificer skill. We head in. We get talking and present the rings and collar.

The collar is a strange infernal alloy **not of this plane**. It's not Dark Steel, but is an alloy that has origins in a lower plane, a layer of Avernus. Its properties seem somewhat weakened, but it is **known as a conduit for psionic control**. We are told, "This collar - the metal and some of its enchantments - they are similar to what you'd find on Dimensional Shackles; things you'd use to control extraplanar beings." So the vampire general was being controlled through this, by Azalin. It's not an 'active' form of control - puppeteering - but it's form of obedience; great pain can be inflicted. At hearing this, Riglan asks - "And how can it be destroyed?" "As far as I'm aware - only in the fires of Avernus." We figure that Azalin would've known immediately when the vampire fell; there would've been a psionic bond.

The rings aren't supernatural but are beautifully made - not here, not in Sembia - but there is a certain composition to the metal and cut, and style of the gems - these are thousands of years old. Not magic, merely valuable. They're almost Netherese artefacts. Perhaps worthy of a museum? "Well, yes, but you *are* in Selgaunt. If there was anywhere south of the Moonsea that you could trade in these, Searloon and Selgaunt are it!"

* The artificer knows an art dealer and gives us a reference. "**Fool's Gold**" in the rich, northern harbour.

We thank him and head back in a hurry to Forum.

### 1:30pm

Senate is back in session. There's more we can do on our ballot with what we learned over lunch, so we head to the lounge and spend time again working with Matthew. He's getting quite nervous - we must submit by 3pm! So we focus...

...and at 2pm, the lounge doors open and a very tired Ilythilia with her Assistant and two other members of staff arrive. Riglan runs up, enthusiastic hand shake, very pleased to see her. Matthew needs her signature so that's attended to!

Temo talks her through the bill, our plans to appeal to different factions, with - if we get that far - some floor speaking and illusions for as much the public gallery's benefit as the senate's.

Other amendments are made until Matthew calls it - only ten minutes to spare! - everything is signed. He hands it to Ilythilia, who must submit the ballot; we run to the Office Of The Senate... 5 minutes to spare... **The ballot is posted**.

"Shall we join the Senate?" she asks; there's usually some ongoing debate beyond 3pm. Sure why not. We follow her in. She heads to the Senate Floor but we have to be in the gallery. She seems to have many people to meet and greet!

### 4pm

Forum wraps up and we all regather; Loic suggests we head to his apartment - and so we do. Everyone's talking strategy. The housekeeper keeps bringing in various trays of nibbles. Wine is opened. Loic seems quite excited - he's not been this involved in a bill in a long time!

The four of us take some time to just get into a corner by a window and have a break while the politicians do their politics thing.

"Can we *really* do this? Azalin, the army, all of this? It's overwhelming" says Temo. "I don't know. We just _have to_ somehow. We take it one step at a time" says Maireagh. "What else can we do? This is the best we can do. This is pretty good... We're trying to change something here. And when we're done with the senate, we'll see what the next thing is."

Riglan nods though and says "I know what you mean tho - it's been a long long time since I talked to nature. To the wild. It was at Owlbear Tower. Since then, I've had some depressing conversations in the Shadowfell and that's about it. I think we all want to go home. But we can't, because we know that it won't exist for very much longer unless we finish what we're doing here."

"But surely not *everything* is hinging on us?" asks Maireagh. "You'd have to be a damned fool to not have some kind of backup plan if Azalin is as dangerous as we know he is, and if as many people know about this threat as we know they do. *Someone* else *must* be doing *something*?!"

Awkward silence. Temo says, "I hope so? But we can't rely on that. We all thought Taern Hornblade would do something, but he just seemed focused on Silverymoon; that was all he seemed to be able to deal with. That was big enough. So maybe it *is* just us. I think we should treat it like that so that we don't maybe get complacent? Not assume we might be bailed out?"

We continue to 'kick the ball around' but there are no decisions. We don't have enough information to make any.

### 6pm

Later, we're thanked for our role in getting the ballot moving so quickly - without us, it would only have started tomorrow, with Ilythilia at the helm. And probably defeated, with vampire Loic!

We are told we have the night off.

We liked that dance square / market area in the lower city, and maybe we could go check out the jewellers - the art dealer - which might be open late, but either way, get to see the place. We depart, get a carriage and head towards the north port first.

We end up cresting a hill where we can see the evening sun over the sea. There's a little marina with private boats and piers. Pleasure craft, not trading / commercial vehicles. There are squares with old, flowering trees in bloom; lots of restaurants with outdoor terraces; wide pavements. A few beautiful-looking art and jewellery shops. And a few banks. It feels very, very expensive!

Temo tracks down Fool's Gold. It *is* open, so we head in.

A middle-aged female gnome in a jeweller's outfit and glasses looks up, surprised; she welcomes us in. "I'm **Tammyfool**, or Tammy" she says. "My father's - I mean, my shop! - this is my shop." We get down to business; she double-checks the rings for curses or other magic; all clear. We're invited to take a seat while she examines them to try and come up with a valuation. The inscriptions match something found in a huge reference book she uses; they belong to a set, it turns out. Ah! A complete set. "You see the stones in them? They look like they have inclusions, which would usually reduce the value but these are deliberate - not so much inclusions as a very, very old form of etching. I'm not sure how they did it but they've etched the *inside* of the gems with inscriptions! I've seen this before and I know *just* the collector for these. I will write him a missive to let him know and see if we can come to a deal. I'll give you 500gp each for these three."

Sounds like a fair amount. Riglan insight 28; she's opening with a low offer and expecting a counter-offer. Riglan says, "Well, another option might be to sell them, and we take a cut of sorts?" "Really? OK? Well that might take a little longer... What kind were you thinking of?" and we get into a discussion. Temo doesn't want to squeeze too hard, as she seems very genuine; persuasion 33; she'll take a 20% commission. What's more, she thinks she can get her client to buy them *today* so if we have dinner we should come back before closing and see what's what. We trust her with the rings and pass them on. She finds a beautiful display case that positions them side by side, writes down some of the inscriptions and points us towards the marina for restaurants while she heads off into the residential area.

There are various open-air cabana-style places, along a boardwalk by the water. People are dressed in things like flowy white gowns or boating shorts... We attract some stares! We had a big lunch and aren't that hungry; Temo spots a "snow cones" (huh?) stall with some children crowded around and goes to investigate.

It's run by a young genasi sorcerer who is freezing liquids onto edible cone-shaped biscuits or crispy pancakes or something. We try four! They're unlike anything we've had before - sweet, but cold; refreshing in the warm evening. 2sp each.

We end up on pier. "Somewhere out there - out in there - is certain death. And it's coming" says Nethza. "We're going to meet it. Because we have to."

Temo says, "So, you mean for us to be on that river delta, where he emerges?"

"I think we have to. Don't we?"

Temo nods. "This is what I meant earlier I think. How - I mean - what - do we even do? It can't be to defeat him. It must be more about understanding, gaining something that helps us later in a fight. But we're going to need an escape plan to survive it."

"We need to know what we're facing"

"No doubt. Accounts of a frightened soldier are one thing; first hand experience, something else entirely."

"We have a task; but how are we going to get to Azalin? How big is his army? How do we get rid of them? We don't know any of this."

Riglan pipes up and says "I'd sort of visualised watching, hidden, from a distance; to judge the army size and see where Azalin sits within it. Head, tail, in the middle?"

"But how do we stop ourselves being seen and overwhelmed?"

"Exactly. I think Azalin will know who and where we are long before we set eyes on him. He seems to have all these psionic abilities; innate, magical, artefacts; he'll probably be able to get into our heads and maybe if he does, that's an opportunity for us to get into his. I don't know if that's how it works, but that's what I've thought about - I've had to, because he could be in my dreams at any time."

And so it goes; more to-and-fro. What if senate doesn't act fast and evacuate? What are "acceptable losses" of the people of this land when Azalin emerges? Seems like none - every death *strengthens* his ranks.

In due course we head back to Fool's Gold. The square outside still has people there, chatting around the fountain on benches. The light is on inside the shop and we head in. "Ah! Good timing!" - she counts out a currency we've not seen before. "This is Slgaunt Paladium." 1pa == 10pp. She hands us 24 of them! "I gather the trade went well!" says Temo. "Yes! Yes. Sometimes it doesn't always pay off trying to make a fast sale; but as it transpires, this gentleman that I often traded with before, has a real fascination with old Netheril. I believe he has an ancestral tie to it."

It's late and we make our way back to Loic's. On the way, Temo realises we asked the wrong question. "We asked how to *fit* this collar, but we should've asked how to *remove* it - instead of fighting vampire generals, perhaps we could've struck a deal."

Ilythilia is still there. The housekeeper greets us. She is very keen on us eating more - the others haven't eaten anything but nibbles! So we help out with food even though we're quite full. We head into the drawing room after and the two speakers and assistants are still there, after several bottles of wine, looking somewhat manic at this pooint! Temo calmly suggests that we should perhaps call it a day, to be at our best, in case the ballot is drawn tomorrow. "But we haven't accounted for every possible eventuality!" - Temo, persuasion 25; it's agreed. For safety, we walk Ilythilia and her assistant Mara back to their apartment, only about 2 blocks away. Before leaving and with permission, Temo sets up Alarm on *their* rooms.

We return to Loic's and head to bed, relying on the dog for early warnings. Tomorrow *might* be the big day; literal luck of the draw... We agree that if Azalin was ever going to try and fuck us up, tonight would be a good night - we will take watches.

* Maireagh perception OK
* Nethza perception only 13
* Temo wakes up Nethza, but nothing bad has happened; perception 20
* Riglan perception 29! He hears the housekeeper stirring at around 6am.



## Day 38
### 7am

Breakfast is ready. Waffles, as a nod to the Western visitors! We are very grateful.

There's nothing much to it - get to Senate Hill at 8.

### 8am

Ilythilia is already there; her team meets her there around 7:50am. Matthew is there, dressed formally. A tray with little pins on them is presented and everyone must wear them - we all go on the Senate floor today. No public gallery.

In we go, nervous. Standing room only. Riglan perception 17+10->27. He sees allies, acknowledging. A few other senators get wind of it, so they know a game is afoot, but that's just part of the process.

Eventually house Speaker says, "I declare the 40th Day of the 462nd Forum Of The Senate to order. The ballot box, please."

Temo shifts from foot to foot, nervous; he has countless magic tricks he could use to favour our ballot but knows he can't - too many wards, too many guards, and too illegal. Ilythilia looks to the ceiling and mouths a small prayer. Riglan shrugs, grabs the staff tightly and does the same!

(DM rolls - 18 or above for our ballot - 19, first time!)

A ballot is pulled. "We have a ballot from the Third Speaker of Searloon" - Riglan actually jumps in surprise!

*Someone* is on our side.

The ballot is read. As it's read we hear murmurings, noise gathering. Someone calls out, "Fearmongering!" and points at Ilythilia. "When did Searloon's Third Speaker fall into step with the warmongers of Ordulin?! This is an outrage!" Myraros stands; "Slander! Slander. There's no collusion whatsoever - but I *do* support this. This is the first sensible motion I have heard on this floor this whole month!" The First Speaker of Saerloon stands; "Of course I stand by my Third Speaker. This is important to us; this is something we have been watching unfold with horror and fear. And it *is* fear! There *is* much to fear! But there is something we can do about it. And we are doing that. Let us not waste time."

Those two speakers call for a vote. We *just* make it - the vote passes, but the margin is narrow. There's clapping but we still feel very nervous, since there's more opposition than we expected from sectors we hadn't anticipated.

Ilythilia tries to reassure us - our real chance comes on the floor when we get to talk in full. At least we've got past this first hurdle.

Five other topics are picked in due course; but thanks to being drawn first, ours will be debated first. Doesn't give us long to prepare, but means less fatigue in the Senate.

### 9am

The first bill is brought forward straight away. The House Speaker says, "As the bringer of the first bill, I hand the floor over to Ilythilia, Third Speaker of Searloon."

She stands and beckons us to walk down to the centre with her. The floor has many seats filled. The public gallery is half full - not bad.

Ilythilia has her speech prepared. Lays down the facts. "And I have with me a representative - not a formal ambassador, because we don't have formal ambassadors, but we have a *historic* relationship - old ties to the city of Yartar, of the Sword Coast! I present to you Representative Temo Smoothhands of Yartar who has travelled all this way to appeal to you alongside Searloon. And not just Searloon" - she raises her hands theatrically and a few others raise in response from around the Senate floor.

Temo gets into it. The history, appealing to some on the floor of long-lived races. Sembia's "timely assistance and renowned academic and investigative abilities", and talks about the notes and paperwork - copies are handed out! An accusation is made of a trading deal between Yartar and Searloon, which Temo can dispel (while being up-front about his wine deal with a specific trader there!).

Why raise an army and fight? We're not trying to draw them into a war. They should be the beacon, using their army for observation and defence only if they so wish.

Why not just hide? This bogeyman - a child's story! We present the rod. We show it, describe as an abomination; it will be destroyed; and it is evidence of a tiny fraction of the evil that's being faced here. Ilythilia describes how it was recovered *here* in this very city, and the city guard reports can corroborate.

An older woman speaks. She proposes an addition to the ballot - to declare a state of emergency! That is beyond what the bill calls for; there's sound reason to it; but it causes immediate rising opposition. Temo suggests an amendment to that - perhaps just a state of emergency in the north; the areas most affected.

The debate shifts to Cormyr. Temo with luck point only gets persuasion 25 by RT; why should Cormyr be involved? It does get passed, but only with the 'quid pro quo' that the Ordulin military be raised too, via funding. That raises heckles. What will that look like? What will Cormyr's path be? And so-on. We can answer a lot of that... This goes on for a good 15-20 minutes, the House Speaker increasingly jumpy as this over-long debate goes by...

...who then calls that "We have decided to shorten lunch today to half an hour, as this is a sensitive and important topic that requires more time."

*That* doesn't help. Ilythilia mutters that she can't believe we're debating the fate of the world and they're talking about lunch; Temo whispers back "but if we can't keep a bit of civilisation, what are we even saving?!"

* Should the Ordulin army join Cormyr?
* Meet Azalin directly?
* Scouts and civil defence?

We suggest the latter. Now the question of trade; would it have to shut down? Well, it would be prudent to route it more to the south temporarily. Loic then asks how the traders in Yhaunn would be compensated? Ilythilia seems prepared for this - if a state of emergency was declared there, emergency fund access would be immediately made available which would compensate any traders in the far North for losses. It's a clever dance; a pre-prepared question and answer from last night, we deduce.

Anything left to discuss? No.

Time to vote. (And it's a dice roll, with advantage - 12, 15; threshold was 13, 2/3rds majority).

**To our enormous relief - 75% of the senate vote in favour.**

* A representative will be immediately sent to Cormyr today with haste to request their assistance - the plan is sent
* There will be a military strategic advisor who will accompany the letters being sent
* "If the Sword Coast representatives wish to accompany this delegation to Cormyr you are most welcome to? We will be sending a skimmer after lunch!"
* Emergency powers - evacuation, as we hoped
* 200,000gp allocated to the Ordulin army
* 1,500,000gp to the mercenary fund - a private military - for trade lane protection and ground troops; they all come from the south

### 10:30am

Everyone's tired. Matthew is beaming; Riglan shakes his hand and clasps his shoulder. Ilythilia thanks us all. The session has a quick recess - we feel a bit sad for the next bill since ours was so heavyweight, but it had to be done.

It seems like we'll be leaving the city with haste!

We see Myraros, across the floor, who comes to congratulate us on the bill passing and thanking us - he got what *he* wanted out of it. We hope that the civil defence army, once mobilised, does not become more than that in future. But that's not our problem.

We quickly dash over to The Fair Trial - perception Riglan, nat 20 + 10 -> 30 - he notices teenagers holding sheets of paper, reading out "Ancient threat re-emergees! Senate in emergency discussions! State of emergency to be declared in the north!" - wow. News travels quickly.

We tell the Fair Trial the good news and they can definitely take the room for the day or two left on the original four. They've heard the news too! They're worried and Riglan tries to reassure them.

Back at the Senator's Lounge, essential to await departure orders for Cormyr, we see Ilythilia, Loic and company taking a recess. They have to be back on the floor shortly, as this is, after all, their job. We bid them farewell - Ilythilia says she'll introduce us to the military commander beforehand; "Please be here at 12:30!" - no problem. She's staying to get the task force together. We confess that we're headed to Cormyr due to the vision; we were in front of an army of Cormyr - and Cormanthor, we confess quietly. We don't know how to make it happen but they must be warned. Azalin's heading their way. Whether or not they join the fight is another story.

We end up outside, on the top of the hill on the shallow terraces with it sinking in. 

"When you're in Cormyr", she says, "seek the Imperial Academy - for they have a long history with Cormanthor; their mages, sages and wizards can provide invaluable advice for days to come. The magic they wield rivals that of our own".

Riglan shakes her hand more formally. "We would not be here without you. We'd quite possibly still be far to the west, or stumbling around in the desert, knowing that Azalin was here but not knowing how to find him or what to do. Whether or not it knows it, this world owes you a debt."

"Yes... Well... Believe it or not, even though we are in the public eye, as you've already found out - much of what we do is 'for our eyes only'. I do believe in our system, with every inch of my being, *but* for people to be able to operate, sometimes we need to shield them from the worst of what is out there. Some of my cohorts believe that is an enemy of democracy; I wish I had the luxury of living in a time when I could believe that as well. The sacrifices we make today which deny us this place of pure heart, is what will allow generations to come to live in that world."

Riglan nods and gestures at the group of kids he saw earlier, still gossipping over the news and says, "yes, we don't want that kind of news to spread and panic those kinds of people - all that would've done is help Azalin."

We start down the hill. The Senate seem to be acting rapidly and comprehensively. "Never doubted them for a minute" says Riglan. Temo kick him in the shins. "What now?"

"I don't now. We have a couple of hours. I feel like - I should be - productive?!" Maireagh says "Packing?" and we chuckle because of course, we always already are. "Was there anything else you wanted to look at in the clockwork street, Maireagh?" "It feels wrong - I feel like I have a much better time if I visit it *after* all this is over." Riglan says, "Well, I know what you mean, but not wishing to dampen spirits - there may not, at least for us, *be* a time when this is all over. Seize the day." "But there's nothing I need that will be of use to me if there is no world after." "Well, I suppose if it's just for us, and we're either enjoying the world and we can come back, or we're dead in action but the world is fine - either way, I take your point."

She's taken a turn for the morbid since the Shadowfell. Riglan thinks for a while and stops. "You never talk much. About yourself, how you feel. I know it's difficult and you don't like it. But the four of us have been through so much and face so much more. Just tell me this. Are you OK?"

"Yes, of course."

She's not lying. Just a darker view of the future. Riglan nods. "I hope when this is over we aren't changed forever, at least not in a bad way. Of course we're forever changed in some way by everything we do."

So we just walk streets, for almost two full hours. Trying to take it in, not knowing if we will be back or if it will even exist. A sense of urgency and fate, fatalism; overhearing the chatter as the news spreads, feeling a nervous energy but - thankfully - not the wildfire sweep of panic. The state of emergency has got everyone's attention but it's not *here*, and people can push it out of mind as "up north". As for what must be going on in Yhaunn soon - who knows. Loic, we imagine, will be very busy!

There is a sense suddenly of passing on from Sembia now. It's up to them. Next, Cormyr.

### 12:30pm

And so presently at just before 12:30, we are once again in the Senator's Lounge as instructed, but probably for the last time. Senate has dissolved for its shortened lunch break. Out of curiosity Temo asks someone what happened to the two other bills in the morning? Both were defeated. But that's how it goes and we've no idea what the merits were. At least it's not like the first was defeated and the second passed, which might've felt almost as if it were from fatigue of ours passing!

Prime Speaker Serenae of Yhaunn approaches, along with Myraros, First Speaker of Ordulin, retinue in tow; Ilythilia, Adarth and others. A delegation has been selected. We are introduced to **Kyros**, the military strategic advisor. He looks late 50s or even early 60s. He's wearing causal clothing, not a uniform; he carries a big bag. Introductions all round. Adarth has asked to join, and Riglan's still a bit suspicious, but he certainly has a lot of knowledge; he's a direct Senate representative, apparently required for this delegation. To our surprise, Matthew has been drafted too - make sure there are no "diplomatic incidents". It's almost as if he knows us and how we tend to speak to politicians and leaders (!). He's been appointed as Advocate from the Senate and officially carries the letters. Altogether, seven of us.

Riglan mentions the ambassador in Searloon and our interaction with him; asks if it's worth a skimmer there first? Apparently, that's worthwhile. We have a navy skimmer requisitioned (!) so can go wherever we need. So in keeping with "due process" and being polite, we do request Saerloon, before on to Cormyr.

**We are given a sealed letter. It grants us a kind of diplomatic status from Sembia which essentially provides a political explanation for why we're even there and gives us Sembian protection while in Cormyr.** Just in case!

There are sandwiches and goodbyes; Riglan says, "May we meet again, one day, Ilythilia."

She answers simply, "Wherever the stars may take you".

We are all ushered to a private carriage. We feel curiously uncomfortable with what seems like privilege above the average citizen but understand the need. We arrive at a small navy dock and there, berthed, is a beautiful small skimmer very like the one Ilythilia arrived in at Yartar. Aboard is a captain and three crew, plus four guards. 14 aboard in total. Supplies are loaded.

Riglan asks if we're going over water or land; water, to Saerloon. Riglan asks that the guards keep watch on the water to the bow. We elect to stay on deck; Matthew and Adarth go below; Kyros stays on deck. Useful, a chance to chat. We cast off.

The skimmer does not perform any fancy curved navigation - a beeline directly out of harbour; within ten minutes we're clear of the "no fly zone". The skimmer sails are hoisted, a form of hydrofoil is extended and we skim.

The four of us spend time talking to Kyros to learn more about him. He served in the war - "The great war!" - against the Netherese. Part of resistance. He doesn't look old enough - finished about 50 years ago - "There wasn't much of a choice. I was born into occupied Sembia" - ah, he was really just a child. We tell him what we can of Azalin and his tactics, as best we've read or understood, but it's all hypothetical. "I'm no stranger to fighting against those who you love" he answers. "There's a very fine line between what civilised people will do to save themselves and to defend others and we don't know what that line is, or if we will cross it, until we are facing death."

We get into a question of mitigating against Azalin targeting army generals to control them and cast the army into disarray; Kyros suggests resistance-like tactics. Have no leaders. Every person in the army knows their role and acts independently. But it could be a more guerilla style; hit from the shadows. If marching into someone else's territory - "well, that requires more Cormyrean tactics." Invasion approaches. The Cormyr army knows this well - the *only* allied nation with a history of success in such things. 

He talks about how populous this land is, compared to the sparsity of the Sword Coast. Borders abut borders. All land is exploited ("exploited is the word!" says Riglan, his druid side coming through).

**Quietly, Riglan wonders if it is a lost cause. Principally humans, but other races too will just keep expanding as long as there is land to do so. Forests cannot survive; they must all eventually fall. *Surely* there must be a way to protect nature.**

He voices this and Kyros disagrees. "Cormanthor - Cormanthor *is* the forest here; the nation protects the forest; and individual nations realise the value and importance of the wild places and protect them by law. Does this not exist where you come from? Do the nations not have protected forests?

Riglan shakes his head. "Not so far as I know. And one I've been trying to tackle."

"Well perhaps that's an idea you could take home with you."

Riglan looks to Temo. "Perhaps I do need to engage with the political process rather more than I thought!"

Eventually it comes to the point where we've gained enough trust to broach the subject of the oracle's visions. In context; we're not sure it's true; but we saw what we saw - the armies, and us. It's a long, complex discussion, that helps us introspect and understand ourselves and the visions a bit more.

Riglan's staff calls to him, surprisingly; to "step away" mentally, assess the situation, figure out what Kyros might be doing. Insight is only 13; he's focused on the conversation; he doesn't notice subtext. Temo insight 16, thinks there's something more to it and chips in. "Your questions have meaning. You seek to understand us perhaps and that is good; would it help to question more plainly? We would not be offended!" "It's not a matter of offence" he answers. "To understand someone truly - this is what I know to be the best way. I am charged with an important task here; and I need to know if you can be trusted to be near this task or if I need to remove you from it. At this point I am undecided."

Riglan looks surprised; "Apparently I'm oblivious?!" and chuckles. "We don't know the details of that with which you are charged. And we accept of course any judgement you might make, with your experience, of our worthiness". "It's not a matter of trust with what you'd do, or whether your actions are truly your own or whether you are under the influence of something or someone, whatever form that takes - such as a planted vision to guide you in a certain way, or to prey upon deep seated beliefs you have to ensure certain outcomes."

If a vision showed success, what would we do? Probably try to make it happen. And if it showed failure? We'd probably try to avoid it. Our visions showed neither, but they might still influence us - make us focus on those points in time. It's true. **So are we unwittingly zealots?** Kyros suggests we speak to sages at academies in Cormyr; they might help us untangle the knot in logic that we have found.

On visions, there are the dreams. The history - the elven civil war. Kyros suggests we speak to Adarth - a trained historian! While he assists the Captain, we go below.

Riglan gets into the conversation with Adarth by describing his dream.

* His vision of the forests where Selgaunt now stands; the 'first contact' with elves. Well before the Dale Reckoning (about 1500 years ago); before the rise of the humans; before the empire of Netheril. Predates even the Crown Wars. "We would need to back in time a great, great distance to arrive at those dates!"

* The elven conflict sounds like one of the two crown wars, 3000 years apart, but he thinks it might be the second one - about 11,000 before Dale Reckoning - because the area stopping being a fishing village about 12,000 before Dale Reckoning.

Riglan didn't know Elves fought Elves like that. The Crown Wars? "There was a time when the population of elves was 100 times what it is today; perhaps even more. Grand cities with tens of thousands of inhabitants at the height of the elven empires, but following the two Crown Wars that decimated the population, many that were left journeyed West towards the coast, to embark for Evermeet." "But why did they fight?" "It's not an area I studied - I just know there were great differences in opinion on what the role of the Elves should be. Those who felt they should help the younger races and those that thought they should subjugate them. In fact the Tel'Keussir, who favoured subjugation, held those who did aid the younger races responsible for the creation of the Netherese Empire as they gave the early human civilisations the gift of the Art." (Magic).

They had the best of intentions; guiding the children in their image, as if parent. How could they knew the children would break in, slaughter the parents and steal the knowledge of the Nether Scrolls?

Riglan's vision of "first contact" could just as easily have been witnessing the creation of what became the Netherese Empire as it could be Selgaunt.

The conversation comes to passing empires; Riglan expresses that this feels now like a dying world. Elves, Giants, Dwarves; all past their glory. But Adarth disagrees - it's "our time now", but their civilisation is very young - only a few millennia! Funny; the Sword Coast views them as ancient.

At this point, the ship shudders; a splash; we're close to dock. We come on deck as the ship pulls in. There's no ceremony - we will make our visit to the ambassador and be on our way as soon as we can. The captain will keep the crew on standby, on board.

Temo knows the way! Champion's Avenue and the very intense ambassador lodgings upon it are rather hard to forget, after all. He leads to try and get a meeting with Danthalus.

Like last time, the guards are accommodating since this is an even *more* obviously 'official' visit than last time. We're taken to a side gallery and an office, where Danthalus is working. He recognises "General" Kyros ("no longer a general!" says Kyros). We don't need the offer of presumed-portal transport since we have a skimmer, but Danthalus offers to take the documents ahead via the portal so that "Her Imperial Majesty" can examine them before we arrive.

He tells us to meet him at the Imperial Palace when we get there!

To Kyros and Adarth, Danthalus says - "I trust that you will explain everything to our Western guests upon arrival into Cormyr? You are well-versed in the decorums of the Cormyrean court?" They nod.

Pleasantries completed, we head out. The for of us ask the Selgaunt delegation if there's anything else they need in Searloon, but they think we should make haste - and we agree. We'll go to the port of **Marsember** then by land to Suzail, the Capital.

### 4pm

By roughly 4pm we're back on board. At full tilt, it'll take around 6 hours to Marsember. It'll be dark, then transferring by carriage for only another 2 hours - we all agree to just gun it, arriving around midnight or after and obviously needing *somewhere* to sleep before heading to the palace.

With five hours to kill, Adarth and Kyros - and especially Matthew - bring us up to speed on the court. It should give us some advantages when it comes to things such as recent history, the war, decorum and so-on. It's *not* a democracy - an imperial monarchy. The 'proper way of things' is important to them.

It's dramatic on deck, as the sun goes down - we "fly" into the sunset. The moon hangs in a clear sky by the time we reach the Sembia and Cormyr border. It's hard to miss - it's actually a giant, fortified physical wall, extending from a mountain range and jutting out into the ocean, with watch towers, lamps and braziers that let us see patrols walking atop.

"It's largely symbolic now, but it was very important during the last Netherese war, since Sembia was occupied" explains Kyros. "Cormyr had to defend its borders."

Beyond that, the land seems dark. Other than a few ships, there are no lights other than the moon and stars - and we see how it gets its name. The sea, being inland, seems quite calm and the skimmer creates only minimal wake. The night sky is reflected clearly and the sea, indeed, is full of stars. Riglan asks Maireagh if there's one of those "photos" she can do? She thinks so. As she sets up, Riglan, perception nat 20 + 10 -> 30. As we're being corralled into the photo, Riglan looks over his shoulder and, deep in the water over the guardrail, are lights moving around quickly. Looking closer, he realises there are beings swimming around down there; Kyros explains later that the "Merfolk nations keep to themselves, but there are aquatic settlements in the Sea Of Fallen Stars and you might, if you get your eye into it, see a few ruins from during the Spell Plague - the level of the Sea was about 30ft lower, as a chasm opened into the underdark and flooding much of it - people built on the low areas thinking it wouldn't come back up, but of course it eventually did. The aquatic races claimed them.

Later, up on a series of hills a distance away, a very brightly lit city shining in the night is visible - this is in fact Suzail, and much larger than Riglan expected - but we turn off *before* that - into an inlet, which leads to Marsember.

It's a busy harbour, even at this time of night. The skimmer touches down and navigates carefully into port. The Captain says that they'll simply wait for us - so they'll find a berth, wait as long as it takes and then convey us home. The guards stay on board (and Riglan warns them, not to frighten them, but just to be aware of the Drowned that did attack once).

Matthew looks tired, Adarth excited; "How do we arrange a carriage?" and Matthew decides he has to do that but Temo, seeing his fatigue, tags along to help. With a copy of a treaty related to Sembia and Cormyr, he secures a large, fast carriage drawn by *four* horses, with plenty of seating inside around a centre area that lifts into a small table. There is a driver and a footman. Luggage is quickly loaded and we're ushered in. As this is happening, Temo asks the footman about accommodation - security more important than comfort; he's asked if we want to be inside the city or out? Inside. And we have to fill in some paperwork - Matthew already hard at work, Temo finds! - that's been set inside the carriage. The footman thinks there will be no delays at this time of day to get past the entry points at the city.

It turns out that the paperwork is not for the capital - it's for *here*. We are corralled through a 'customs' kind of affair, where we're asked if we understand laws posted on a wall. One that stands out...

**No Harming of Cats**

...as apparently cats of all sizes are considered noble animals in Cormyr! Some of the others of note, indicating some of the strictness here, are:

* Hunting on private land is forbidden
* Purple Dragon knights can search us upon request
* Bow your head to royalty and nobility
* Weapons must be peace-bonded (?) unless we're members of chartered adventuring groups, or mercenary groups that can provide proof of employment (but Matthew explains we're exempt as we have the sealed senate letters that give us Sembian diplomatic protection)

We even have to exchange our gold for "lions", the only legal currency. After what seems like forever but is really only a few minutes, we're in the carriage and on our way. Matthew slumps in a corner with his hat pulled down over his eyes; Riglan and Temo peek out of a side window with the curtain open.

Even this small port city is quite beautiful. Buildings are chateaux-esque. Grand. Pillars, decorations, reminiscent of the Searloon ambassador lodgings. Quite different from the Sembian architecture. The same kind of materials though - terracotta shingle roofing and the same kind of blockwork. Just much more ornate. Lots of marble statues!

The road is illuminated the whole way, which is pretty extraordinary for 2 solid hours of carriage ride. They look magical, unsurprisingly. It never feels like we never really reach open country - at most, farms, grasslands, orchards, vineyards. There are aqueducts alongside the road in places, and beautiful stone bridges ever time the road needs one. There's not much traffic - we keep going at full speed until we start reaching a much more built up area, having gone inland a fair way.

There's an entry toll at gates into Suzail. After a few twists and turns we stop. Matthew pays for the ride - which looks expensive from what we see of the number of coins being passed over! - and we're in front of a beautiful building, stone steps, block stonework, double-door entrance, four storeys. Tall narrow glass windows. Briar roses climb up the side of the building.

It's quiet inside; the lobby is empty. We ring a bell and someone pops out. Our party will stay in a single room; the other three would each take a separate room and Matthew asks if we're sure. We confess a preference for a security posture! They rethink and we're able to get two rooms with lots of bedrooms; but we're on floor 3 and they're on floor 4. Once the three of them are settled, Temo sets up Alarm and we are finally able to settle into our own room.

Heavy wooden furniture, large comfortable beds, heavy drapes, no kitchen but there's a bathroom and a common area, with four separate rooms. We agree to take watch, using the common area. The dog, as usual, assists.

* Maireagh is tired! Perception 1,7 + 0 -> 7!
* Nethza is very high (after waking up Maireagh)
* Temo 11,16+6 -> 22
* Riglan perception 8,19+10 -> 29

An hour into Riglan's watch - the sun rises. He goes to the window to see if he can spot any clock towers! It's 6am. We've gone West, so the sun is rising later; so we arrived at Sembian midnight - but in *Cormyr* time, we arrived at 11pm. He sees a very beautiful city! Almost fairytale. As beautiful as Sembia was, here the architecture is grander and more for 'show'. More to the point, though, he can see over city walls from this third floor position and can see buildings stretching for what must be a mile or two beyond - this place is *huge*.



## Day 39 (Suzail, Cormyr)
### 7am

We wake up, pack up quickly and head to floor 4, and find the door is ajar so head in. Kyros is in full plate, doing final adjustments. That's what his big wooden chest was for!

A little while later we're all ready and head down. We ask Matthew about timings; he thinks it is best that we get breakfast while he arranges transport - unless we don't mind walking? We're happy with that of course, and so is Kyros; so that's that.

### 8am

We're walking. The city is already busy. Lots of traders - carts and wagons; carriages, people on horseback, people walking at the sides of the road like us. Fairly soon we're on a main street. *Very* wide. It has poplars growing in rows and leads directly towards a big fountain with a circular road around it. Matthew points that way. We reach the roundabout, which has various wide avenues coming off it. One leads uphill and has another big row of trees; we head that way. There are various large temples and other big buildings set back from the street, lining it. The whole thing feels very planned. At the *next* fountain roundabout, there's an even *wider* avenue going up hill towards a distant golden, wrought-iron fence, lots of trees behind it, a giant gate - open - with knights on horseback visible patrolling. Large statues of lions. "The palace, I presume?" says Temo! "Yes!" says Kyros, pointing at the large building visible over the trees beyond.

There are taller buildings up this way, including a hill with 60-100ft high various pennant-bearing massive towers atop it, with stone stairway buildings clustered around, climbing down the side. "That is the academy of the war mages" says Kyros. We could either go there, or the Imperial University to talk about visions - Kyros points to *another* really large group of buildings with spires, clustered in another area.

The whole area radiates "seat of power". Very few houses; doesn't seem residential at all. We proceed up the wide street to the palace gates. It's very busy on the road, but we reach the gates quickly enough. Matthew shows appropriate paperwork to the guards. We remember our "decorum", make sure we're tidily dressed and carry ourselves tall.

A moment after the gate, we see a knight on horseback riding towards us carrying a banner. There's a row of horses behind. Matthew and Adarth immediately bow their heads - so we do the same, realising they must be nobility or royalty.

Riglan says, "Temo, did you remember to clean your shoes?" - he did everything *else* with the cleaning stone but forgot those! He polishes the tops on the back of his calves.

We approach the palace. Versaille style - long wings, two storeys, many floor to ceiling windows, a grand entrance in the middle; behind the building rises and rises to a Disney-style palace - well - castle in the middle. Round towers, blue shingle roofs, many towers, many pennants. The grounds we're gone past have box hedge mazes, trees and flower plantings; up here are ponds, filled by water perhaps pumped up by magical means. We're led up into a corridor that heads deeper in. Lots of people around, all in formal dress.

It takes some 15 minutes of walking before we arrive in the main hall of the main palace. High security. Matthew hands over to Kyros, who has the letters. We're shown to a waiting room.

We spend time chatting about strategy. In the end, we don't want to mention visions or Zhentil - let Cormyr decide if it's helping and, if so, how it wants to move its army. Riglan is nervous; Temo shrugs - "it's just another performance."

After about 20 minutes of this, we run out of things to talk about. Some awkward silences, punctuated by occasional smalltalk. Half an hour. An hour. We're offered drinks and some 'nibbles'. Riglan just grows more nervous. **An Empress** after all - he's never knowingly met anyone even close to this important and tries his best to remember all the things he was taught. He didn't think he was one to be impressed by power, but having seen the scale of the city, read its laws and seen all the people bowing their heads so diligently to passing nobility, it's hard to avoid being caught up in the feeling of this being *a very very important person indeed*.

Her name, we learn during the wait - rather belatedly - is **Raedra Obarskyr**; we are in Castle Obarskyr now.

Temo can tell. He whispers, "Best behaviour, Leafseeker. You'll be fine. Just follow my lead."

Another half hour... It feels like forever. Then the doors open and someone dressed in a velvet doublet (!) with striped puffy sleeves, purple, gold rope (Temo loves it!) and a black velvet hat with (of course) a feather, enters. A courtier. "The Court will see you now."

(We can't see it but we're all thinking, "About f*cking time!")

Outside, 8 guards (woah) in halfplate with half pikes fall into lockstep. For a minute Riglan thinks they're guarding us as we might be a target of Azalin, before the penny drops - no, they're *guarding* *us* - in case we try to do anything stupid. They're watching us, not watching out for us.

We're taken up various stairs and corridors; to a third level, then a grand entrance to the room of the court. From here, we can look out through huge foyer windows, some 15ft high floor-to-ceiling, balconies outside, to palace grounds and over what seems to be the entire city. We are led up to the closed doors. Gilded fully, intricate carvings beneath.

Matthew says "Follow my lead" - very forcibly. Adarth and Kyros behind. Riglan and Temo follow, then Nethza and Maireagh, then the dog behind.

The doors are opened.

A long room. Vaulted ceiling, chandeliers, beautiful paintings, a short gallery with now 20-ft high windows lining it. Various courtiers are sat or stood alongside. Directly in front - but Matthew tells us "heads down!" - is, well, a room? The guards then say "Stop!" and (Clonk) drop pikes; we stop. Matthew drops to one knee and we follow (Maireagh whispers behind Riglan, "What *is* this bullshit?!" and Riglan in his nerves can't help but giggle quietly).

"Rise! Please rise. Welcome to Cormyr, the Diamond Of The Empire."

We stand and look up. Up 6 velveted stairs is a massive throne, guards either side, chairs either side. Sat very properly in the middle, in full regalia, with a crown and sceptre leaning against the throne to her side, is a human woman who looks to be in her 50s. At to her right a "classic wizard" with a robe of stars. No pointy hat, thankfully, but has the white trimmed beard and grey hair; 60s man. Wears a circlet with insignias of stars, a robe of stars - very stars. Many many stars. On her left, a younger man in a very over-the-top ornate breastplate - full battle scene, dragon on it, the works - and right in the middle, a purple dragon. Maybe late 30s. Classically very handsome. Muscular, very fit. He has a very large shield with the same purple dragon insignia, and has a greatsword beside it. He sits in full plate.

Riglan perception disadv. 18, he sees General Danthalus standing on one of the lower steps, facing the middle of the room. There's a flick of a tail; a tiger! It sits in front of the empress. Riglan narrows his eyes at that - it seems to be guarding the empress - he figures he might want to speak to that! Hopefully it's a willing participant.

"You've travelled a long way - approach! Approach!"

We shuffle forward awkwardly. The guards clonk along behind, keeping distance. The guards beside the chair see our weapons then, and bristle - the purple knight even starts to stand, but the empress dismisses them; "Do you think if they were going to try and kill me they wouldn't already have tried?!"

Danthalus is invited to announce us... "This is the delegation from Sembia, which we have previously spoken about."

"Ah yes! Of course. I can see that now!" (Good grief, thinks Temo!)

Danthalus fills in a little more - she is a busy lady! - and Matthew then realises that he's meant to announce our names, and does so for everyone but himself.

At the empress' request there's a fuss as courtiers bring chairs. But there are only 6. Riglan, being tallest, stands behind. He keeps his hands visible on the back of the chairs in front, mindful of the nervous guards.

There's some smalltalk. Then Temo is up, as Adarth starts to stand; Temo moves with him. Adarth says, "I carry a formal request for your majesty's aid - for the aid of the empire. I bear the Writ Of Suzail. It is with the blessings of the Senate, that we humbly approach the Empress seeking to invoke the alliances of old."

"Those old are dire, dire words to open with! I would read this missive with haste!"

A courtier has to rush over to hand her the letter (Adarth isn't allowed that close). And she looks uncomfortable in all that formal clothing - probably couldn't walk far anyway.

She reads, then looks shocked. Then she says - almost shouts - "CLEAR THE COURT! General, you stay; and my advisors. Everyone else, **OUT**." The room is hastily cleared. "My goodness..." - she looks to the knight. "**Alusair** - will you help me out of this?!" and starts undoing clasps and so-on to get rid of the heaviest garb - her big cloak, crown. Riglan says, "I always thought the phrase, 'heavy is the crown' was a metaphor..." "It was made for stronger necks than mine!" (We later learn that the knight's surname is also Obarskyr - he's her sun! And the Steel Regent, not the High Martial, of Cormyr).

Temo says, "Your majesty, I do wish we were here under better circumstances. It would have been joyous to have such a privileged meeting as this for happy reasons. But the river of the world flows as it will, and we can but do our best to adapt to its changing currents."

"Well said... I see you have read <some person Temo unwittingly just quoted> - Well said!" (Temo must've seen this in his etiquette book).

She brandishes the letter. "This. This. How certain are you of the thing underlying this?"

Temo answers - "There is no doubt. None whatsoever."

"This is the crisis of my rule, isn't it?" - Temo feels a pang of sorrow for this landing on her shoulders - she hands the letter to the mage, her advisor. The High Mage. "Do you know my advisor? The High Mage of Cormyr. He's the Archmage, **Ganrahast**" (Stiff bows, we think that's the right thing to do). He reads the letter then says "I am so sorry your majesty that this has escaped our notice! I will look into this right away." "This isn't a time for blame; we need to know how to act. *Of course* we will provide troops, but the question is, what good will we do? The Purple Dragon Knights are not the force they were in centuries past. We have lost a good many of our numbers at the Well of Dragons just recently. And many of our mages too. But we are not without resources."

She continues. "The kingdom is recovering. We are not at our full strength. We value our allies greatly. Were an event like the Netherese attack happen today, I'm not sure that we would fare as well as my father did, or my grandfather before him. But at least I have had the privilege and the luxury of seeing the empire recover in my time and at least we know everything that we've done - all of the sacrifices and difficult decisions made - were not in vain. For the day has come! The day has come for Cormyr to raise its war banners again."

There's a look of long-distant sadness in her eyes. A moment when she's steeling herself up for the months and years ahead. Her composure is regained.

"I believe the day - the time for action - was yesterday. As it always is! What is the plan? I hope you have brought a military mind here."

Kyros says, "yes, that would be me."

"Shall we go somewhere a bit more practical than this?"

She leads us out of a back exit! We go behind the throne, through a curtain, into some private chambers. Everything else - sceptre, crown and so-on - is left behind. She says to the Captain of the Guard as she leaves, "*Nobody* is allowed into the chamber of the court until I return."

So... This is to be our war room.

"Talk to me. What do we know?" And so-on. We get into it.

* The Dale Lands must be warned.
* We say we need to engage with Cormanthor.

Does anyone, asks the mage, know how to speak to Elven Court? The mage thinks Azalin will try and walk through the battlefields of Ancient Aryvandar, where thousands of fallen elves lie... Riglan asks if we can see that on a map? From memory, says the mage, the fiercest fighting - the borderlands contested at the civil war - "are here". He points to the Eastern parts of the remaining forests. That's a worry - he might not be following the road, to Esembra; instead, travelling more to the East, cross-country. The elves consider it forbidden, hallowed ground by many elves. Sounds like Azalin's favourite place.

Even if he doesn't know about these killing fields, he could exploit him. So maybe we need to draw Azalin actually to our less favoured (originally) course - through the deep forest, populated lands - but those can be evacuated, and there are fewer dead.

"I know you've travelled far but your job here will be completed soon. Will you travel to Elven Court?" asks the Empress.

The four of us exchange glances. "We really were hoping to go there next, yes!"

We're told we are not going alone. "A member of the Purple Dragon Knights, Sir Isteval, will accompany you. I'm sure he's itching to leave Cormyr again!"

We thank her but also warn her about the **impending arrival of the Knights Of Samular,** either on the Western border or maybe even via portal if they can move that quickly. Alusair says he'll send word to the frontier so they can be met and escorted through Cormyr to eventually join us.

Riglan says, "I have a strange request. Do you mind if I speak to your tiger?!"

"Sure!"

Riglan nods at Ganrahast - he'll known if Riglan's not casting what he says! - and casts Speak With Animals. Riglan looks to the tiger and 'says', "hello friend; do they treat you well?"

"Yes! I eat and I sleep and I wander the castle as I please."

"I am glad. Is there anything you think you would like, but have been unable to ask for?"

The tiger tilts its head to one side, thinking. "Hmm. I would very much like to eat the duke. He is not a good man and does not mean the master well."

Riglan says, "I think the master's permission would be needed for that! But I'll let her know."

"I've been told I cannot eat anyone!"

"Well, so long as you have plenty of *other* food..."

"I eat rabbits."

Riglan learns that these tigers are born and raised on palace grounds. They don't miss the wild because they've never been in it.

"It was nice to meet you. Please don't eat Temo."

(Temo raises an eyebrow at his name being spoken in the middle of a growling conversation, with the tiger looking at him at that moment...)

Riglan mentions that the empress might want to keep an eye on the Duke! "Ah, they're all always plotting. It never comes to anything."

"Do you have a place to stay while you are here?" she asks.

Kyros answers that we have a place on the outskirts. We are instead appointed a villa, outside the palace grounds but in the city proper, much more close by. The city's own guards will be appointed. It'll take a day to get hold of Sir Isteval and for him to prepare to leave, so some time tomorrow towards midday is a likely departure for Cormanthor. It won't be in a carriage - it'll be in a forest. They'll provided horses and squires to look after them at the forest edge, after which we have to proceed on foot.

Last thing - upon asking, we're given permission by Ganrahast to enter the Academy Of High Mages, or the School Of War Mages, to ask about the visions per Kyros' comments during the voyage.

It's all set; we thank the empress for her time, unsure of proper protocol, and depart. Ganrahast shows us a side exit to avoid going back through the main Court. Too many questions. A worker's exit! "This is more our speed!" says Temo. A housekeeping area. Temo pays very close attention to the route, the people along it, doors, windows, side corridors and so-on. If we ever have to sneak in here for some reason, or help anyone escape, he'll know the way.

Outside, we ask if the other three want to come with us to see the mages; Kyros thinks he's exerted his opinion enough and we should go in private. We'll all meet up at the villa. Riglan thinks (history 18+5) about which group of mages to see; he remembers reading a book once - abjuration (protection) and evocation (attack/energy creation) magic for the war mages. While they're sure relevant for the "war effort" and tactical perspectives, they're not what he thinks we need for the visions.

Accordingly, we start making our way across the city - via the villa (a small standalone building with staff assigned) dropping off the other three - and then continue on. We find some beautiful old trees around what looks like a man-made stream with a waterfall. Riglan's very interested in this; it's a small grove and, in its midst, we're not in view from the road. It looks like a very good place to portal in without alarming anyone. Silver oaks around the edges, tall stone pines near the waterfall. Riglan looks for an oak, finding one on the banks of the plunge pool. A brief conversation and the tree is happy - so now we can get here again if need be, quickly, so long as there's another big tree nearby!

Numerous small stone arch bridges cross the stream along the way; we cross and continue towards a university-like compound with the various towers and buildings clustered together that we'd seen from a distance before. We realise that the stream and waterfall are in some way magical - it's a circuit, the water somehow flowing back up to fall again at the waterfall that's now some distance away.

We are near a central courtyard with fountain, gazebo and shady plane trees with stone benches beneath - sages, students and more. There are some admin buildings we could ask at, or Temo could look for signs or even ask people about who we might see. We figure this is a very structured nation - all those rules on the 'customs' entry port - so head for the admin building. It's quite quiet. A male, middle-aged human sits at a desk, looking distracted by a couple of open books. He looks up and welcomes us.

We explain what we're after. With a wave of his hand, creates a sort of 3D illusion map of the university to show us where we go. The School of Foretelling And Predictions. "The save you probably want to speak to is **Tanrahhas**". We thank him and head there directly. Once outside, we can correlate the '3D illusion map' with what we see on the ground; we realise that there are signposts, but it's based on symbols of schools. Temo arcana 12, recognises one or two as maybe symbols representing specific schools of magic. I suppose that's no surprise! Our target school's symbol indicates 'divination', unsurprisingly.

A rounded tower with rounded dome, in blue and grey, is our destination. A couple of smaller towers stand as if at ends of a 'V' with the main tower at the base. A semi-circular covered forum area formed by that 'V' shape seems to be being used for a lecture, with students sat listening. Someone approaches in a particular robe and asks why we're here; we say we're looking for Tanrahhas. He's giving the lecture! He's part way through, so we sit in and listen to the rest.

Temo listens intently, 15+5 -> dirty 20 arcana, and understands quite a lot. Understanding of probabilities, how to read chains of events; seeing multiple futures and identify the key points along a chain of any train of decisions making things more or less likely. Each decision point must be understood to see what happens next. The accuracy of the prediction is limited by the accuracy of that understanding.

About 20 minutes more of lecture happen until there's a chime sound across the campus - he's mid-sentence but people start packing! Tanrahhas hastily wraps up. Some students start to queue to ask questions. We head down to join the back of the queue. We see a young woman asking questions, he answers, she argues back but he sees us coming; "Don't worry Alison, let's talk about this at our next session!" and turns to us.

"I recognise the four of you! I saw you in a vision! I am Professor Tanrahhas. Who are you?" We introduce ourselves. "Come walk with me to my study!"

We start to explain the backstory in brief. At his study there's a scrying pool - we say it probably won't help; he tries anyway. His eyes cloud and he mutters a while; then says, "Interesting! Can you see in the pool?" - and he casts his 'eye' over Sembia. We can see visions in the pool ourselves now. Images dancing. Now Cormanthor. Images dancing. Then the Dragonreach - static. Nothing moving. Something blocks his sight.

We tell him what he might scry for; aberrations, vampires and so-on; and perhaps they could set up checkpoints or truth checking for key people to make sure they're not replaced ("the Lanterns Of Seeing" he says). He can certainly set up a barrier to stop *more* undead coming in. He'll bring the recommendations to the court.

Onto what we want. We ask if he's heard of the All Seeing Eye cult/church. Yes; they use divine methods of divination, rather than logic. Riglan says he does too - Tanrahhas recognises the ability. Riglan shows the staff. **It's from this area** - work of the elves that splintered from Aryvandar. Riglan realises some of his visions long ago were probably part of that. There are legends of people travelling West, across glaciers.

But to the point - the oracle and the visions - how do we know if we're changing our behaviour because of them?

He lights up and becomes very animated. This is one of his favourite subjects. Books are brought out, he's in full flow. "It's the *decisions* we understand and only the decisions we understand that we can see past. The moment you hit a decision you cannot understand, you won't be able to predict beyond it. And that means the person who gave you those predictions believed that they understood every decision at every inflection point... Which means that what *you* need to do is to understand why *you* are behaving the way you're behaving. There's no need to wrap yourself up in thoughts of logic and fate, because someone who can see beyond that point already understood."

On the subject of flipping a coin to make a choice - well, that would be unpredictable. A decision that cannot be understood - BUT - **if the choice makes no difference to the outcome anyway, the future could still be predicted**.

On accuracy - a diviner can believe they understand all motivations and decisions and pick a path that's most likely, but may be mistaken. "This means we are indeed masters of our own fate, because we are masters of ourselves!"

We hypothesise the situation of seeing Rex on the shores of the sea without backup. Certain death? He shows us a vision of that, but then "pulls back" to show us actually a long way away but with mages casting an illusion of us closer. It's a matter of perspective and interpretation. Do we fear death? Well we *think* that there are subsequent predictions, but in truth the 6 week one at Zhentil Keep was only if we didn't stop him at the sea. Unspoken, perhaps, was also if we didn't *die* at the sea...

At this, Tanrahhas says we should come with him to see a friend - an arcane gateway is opened to another tower, "Imagery And Light". An associate professor is to be seen - knocks on a door - a female gnome opens it - she is **Irma**. Tanrahhas poses the problem, re-showing the visions and illusion. He asks what kind of magic might be a convincing enough illusion. Does Azalin even need to believe it is real? We're not sure on that, but think that if it seemed unreal he'd ignore it. He can detect life and death, we think, so we figure the illusion would need to seem to have a lifelike signature. She suggests a geometric solution; an illusion line, with us stood a distance behind, so that our real life force seemed to be coming *through* the illusion.

She calculates... The illusion must be more than 60ft away and outside the range of illusion detection spells. But what about magic detection spells? OK, 120ft away. And so it goes on.

* Why are we there? We want to observe - see the army.
* Why are we there really? Ah, yes, we have to try and influence his course, now; move him over the bridge and on the road, *not* on the coast. The Killing Fields must be avoided.

We are given parchment diagrams with spells, ranges and geometries after this. A war mage could cast it. But we can't just requisition one. The female gnome says she has a student who would be great, but not if his life was in danger. We can only guarantee that we'd protect him with our own lives, but if we fell, so might he - we simply can't guarantee any better.

Tanrahhas looks for a future if we fall. "Interesting. If you were to fall, the Empire would also fall. It's a moot point."

("No pressure then" mutters Temo).

Well, then; we're taken to see this 30-ish man, an illusionist called **Lesther**. We put things to him bluntly; but it's a hell of an opportunity. "Well, my theory is that if you can cast two illusions at the same time, layered but one slightly darker than another, it looks much more realistic..." - and demonstrates. It does certainly seem to grant a slightly greater depth. "Works really well in bright sunlight as you can adjust it to create more shadow". Temo hadn't noticed this *missing* from his own illusions but once you see the alternative, it makes sense. He's using a pair of crafted gloves to maintain the illusions.

Temo tries to be persuasive - 10+15 -> 25 - he'll do it. He'll see an old professor at a school of Wards & Barriers for a bit of extra protection. "Where are we meeting?" - we'll see him at the villa location in the morning. Irma says she'll give him all credits for the term if he documents his field research properly, which seems easily sufficient motivation.

We thank them, say we'll leave them in peace, see Lesther in the morning & that's that.

On the way out, Tanrahhas looks to Riglan and Nethza and says - "Now, in my visions, I see something as well that is of use..." - he pulls out two marbles. "I don't know who gets which, but this" - shows one - "is a **stumble**. In this, I see a vision of stumbling" - it's a "2" (replace a roll with that). "And in this other one, a vision of **resounding success**." (It's a "19"). "You must take one each. It can be used at any time, either for yourself, or something you see." It can be used *before* one of our own rolls instead of it, or *after* someone else's roll as a reaction.

Riglan gives Nethza the 19 and takes the 2.

We thank Tanrahhas and say, "sorry to impose for one more thing, but we have this vampire collar..." - he shows the artefact recovered in the battle at Selgaunt - "...and I don't suppose you could direct us towards someone who might be able to destroy it?"

He takes us to an area where the general faculty is located and, to our surprise - there is a smelter! It's used to destroy dangerous things created by accident; the "weave smelter". It is tended to do by senior members of staff. It's not a difficult job to destroy the control collar - and it'll render the other half of the control collar powerless.

### 1pm

All work and no play... We go exploring. We've not seen this city before.

Lots of choices in area to visit. Students, nobility, military - but surely, the largest percentage of the population is made of just regular people. We head for the market area. The largest we find is called the **Olonez Market**, split into four quadrants. Two are covered - converted old barracks it seems - two not. One of the former has all the meat and fish; fresh food. One of the open areas has performers and many stalls of non-perishables; the other is covered in gravel and sand, exotic animals and beasts of burden, large objects. The last, a colonnade-surrounded two storey temple which Riglan recognises with surprise is to Shauntea, also lots of food and drink stalls, looking fairly permanent.

We start with lunch! We do that thing where we pick stuff at random to try it out. Lots of salad options, goat's cheese, cucumber, tomato etc.; small coconut bowls with raw fish 'cooked' in lemon juice and coconut milk; a section of glazed pastries and so-on. It all comes to 2 "Lions" (2gp). Various drinks cost another Lion.

It's bustling - busy. People are businesslike; not relaxed, but not "under the yoke" either. Seems upbeat. General gossip is overheard, nothing of consequence; people here seem to have enough - they're not left wanting. Riglan perception 29, notices a poorer-looking family with some children, one parent apparently with some kind of physical disability; but shop keepers give them food, chatting politely. It doesn't "feel" like charity but nothing is expected in return.

This isn't a perfect city - we're sure we'd see more poverty in the outer ring, and beyond the outermost wall - but people look after each other, that much is clear.

Not much haggling going on downstairs; nowhere near as much as at Sembia. Temo looks for smoked fish; he finds lots of sausages and salamis, wheels of cheese and so-on. We get some large sausages, salami and cheese for the Chest of Preserving - 5 Lions. To surprise people "on the road" from the Chest, we look for bread or fruit. We find big baskets of figs and they fit the chest well as they're not so large, so we get a lion's worth.

We spend a while watching performers. No donation baskets or hats - they're just performing.

More walking. Lots of community things - public. Halls, baths, libraries. Nothing seems to need payment. We assume taxation!

Towards the arena area, things are lively; games are being played. There seems to be horse chariot racing - Riglan's not too sure if he approves of that - but other feats of strength and skill seem to be more "ethical".

Next, Riglan looks for a big park. We've seen plenty of areas like that. We ask around; there's a particularly large one in the outer city, with some small ponds; another large preserved woodland north of the castle. Riglan opts for that because it's "original", not altered.

There are stone walls with a big stone arch entrance. Various plaques describe history, lots of laws listed of course - no hunting, no taking anything - we go in. There are guides there but we think we don't need it. There's a map, showing trails; or we can just wander around. It's quite big. Riglan leads the way heading for the middle. Survival 8+10->18, figures it out after a while. Lots of wildlife.

Riglan finds a spot and casts Commune With Nature. He's interested in fiends etc., or extraplanar involvement. He does not detect fiends within the forest, but does sense that sometimes **fiends wander in and out from the city**. No extraplanar involvement. It's an old forest, but only a remnant; and the spell's influence stops abruptly at its boundaries. Clearly there must be fiends in the town, wandering around; not sure what that tells us. There are lots of wild animals prevalent of course, especially birds and lots of snakes too; no prevalent peoples. No sense of corruption or whatever - it feels in good health (but recovering - something happened a few decades ago).

In the end, we return to the villa and figure we can just hang out and read, or join the others if they're heading anywhere. Kyros, Matthew and Adarth are there. We talk about what we're going to do.

* Riglan doesn't think he can just ask Cormanthor for military aid. He remembers well what the ambassador said. Instead, he just has to lay it on the line and let them make the call.
* We want to understand them more; we hope that Lesther can help with that.
* Kyros, Matthew and Adarth think they must report back to Selgaunt and let them know what the Empress said. So, we will be parting ways in the morning.

With that, we decide to have a bit of a farewell dinner together. The staff at the villa prepare food for us, and we enjoy a last night before they depart back for Sembia.

It's a good opportunity to catch up with Kyros about the experience with the sages.

(We learn that the feudal system here - the patronages of the court, the ownership of things - the way that this empire works is *not* based on tax. People do work, but the empire "looks after them". The empire owns all land, the people don't, so the question of "how do they pay for it" becomes moot. When people work on farms they give all produce to the empire but do get paid - as we've seen, there is a "normal-feeling" system of commerce here.)

One of our Yartar "good stuff" bottles of the wine is shared.

Eventually, as the hour draws late, Temo draws up Alarm and we settle into comfortable beds.



## Day 40 (departing Suzail, Cormyr)
### 8am

After breakfast, we're packing and there's a knock on the door. Temo's sling isn't warning him so he opens the door - an old "salt & pepper" short-haired, tanned, cape, large sword... "Sir Isteval, I presume?" asks Temo. "Yes! Just call me Isteval. And you are - Temo?" "Yes!"

Everyone finishes packing - and as we do this, a timid knock on the door. Riglan opens this time, saying "Hi Lesther" as it opens. His guess was right. He has a chest, a satchel stuffed full of things and a backpack with books in. Riglan looks at the chest. "Oh. Can we carry that?" - but Lesther casts something and the chest floats, on an invisible disc!

It's time to leave and we bid farewell to Kyros, Matthew and Adarth. Matthew in particular softens a little, some of his personality shining through; "I guess - I guess this is what it feels like. I guess I will actually miss being around you, as much as it always means work for me. It's been an honour to travel with you and help you with the senate."

We all leave together - the six of us head for the Northern gate, while the other three start on the trek back to the coast and the skimmer.

A tower with glinting gold domed roof - a temple to Lathandar, complete with songs. Riglan remarks that he's surprised to see gods from the West worshipped so far East. From their perspective it is of course reversed - they're surprised that we worship those same gods to the West. They've worshipped them here for millennia.

We reach the Imperial Barracks. Isteval requisitions six horses, appropriate for our size and weight, though it's a full sized horse so Riglan helps Temo up - but has more sense than to try and help Maireagh!

Ready to go.

It takes a while to get past the outer city and buildings beyond - farms, estates; a major road, leading North-East. At least two miles before clear countryside, maybe more. The road is busy - trade - going in both directions.

"I'm curious. What *is* going on?" says Isteval after a while, drawing up on his horse alongside Riglan. "I was told it'd be explained once we were on the road."

Riglan explains - the short version, but the no-punches-pulled version again. The conversation wanders over various topics and concerns. The fuller story is given in time. Riglan also talks about the Purple Dragon Knights and their smaller numbers - involvement in the war - he discovers that Isteval was at the front line. The closest Riglan got to it was talking to some people who'd been there in a tavern. Isteval asks if it was a goliath? Heh. There we go.

### 12pm

We have a short rest. Riglan's thoughts turn back to Isteval at the dragon war. Riglan had been bothered by what he saw that day after, atop the trees, before his 100th birthday; the iceberg hidden by a cloud in the sky. Isteval recognises the description and talks about Skyreach, a flagship part of the campaign.

### 1pm

For the next part of the journey, Isteval opens up. He tells the war story in details. It's been almost two years. It feels to Riglan as if he hasn't had a chance to talk about it in this way with people before, and it's fresh on his mind.

### 5pm

We push a bit towards the end to get over a big bridge over a river. There are inns and taverns built into the stone of this rather large construction and sprawling a bit beyond. Isteval suggests that we cross and find an Inn to stable the horses. Agreed! He get a room for free as a Knight; Lesther uses his university honorarium; we pay 1 lion (1gp) for the four of us - not bad.

### 6pm or so

We meet later in the tavern and settle in for food. Riglan says, "OK then Lesther - you're up! Tell us more about Cormanthor."

He tells us about the history of the elves; the kingdom stretching from the sea to the mountains. The glory days, of the old empire; how the first division - the first Crown Wars - happened. The second Crown Wars were caused by the rise of the human people who would later become the Netherese. Riglan remembers that part, from his dream of those origins and the later discussions about it; "there are still those who believe that humans are not inherently evil and that the actions of some should not colour the access to the gift for everyone", summarises Lesther.

The war, though, was terrible - a civil war of two centuries, tearing the elven nation apart. In the end, many who survived headed (far, far) West and left. There was a prior exodus too, of course, after the first Crown War; they left the area of The Moonsea and headed through the forest-of-then that is the Anauroch now, to the glaciers that stretched much further south then. "What *we* learned was that the elves over there made the same mistake - in raising Evermeet, which was one of the things that led to the second Crown War, the weave was damaged very badly and this affected the land so badly that it turned into what is now the High Moor. The then-fertile forests and steppes of the Anauroch became the Netherese Empire."

In terms of them as a people, now? "They're very reclusive. They don't come into the Empire, they really don't" - and we realise that indeed, elves are very much more rare on this side of the desert. We have seen hardly any. In fact, the Sword Coast - Waterdeep in particular, the brief time we were there - felt far more "cosmopolitan". Very much more mixed/mingled. Most in the East are humans; even dwarves are rare. We really only saw many non-humans in the University grounds. Even in Sembia, the senate was mostly comprised of humans.

Even in the wider sense, the kingdom of Cormanthor does not interact much with the human Kingdoms; they have their traditional homes there, in the forest. There's no much call to leave and head out to human cities built from stone, felled wood and iron. But it's shrunk a great deal, both because they couldn't possibly police a kingdom so large anymore, due to desertification and due in no small part to human-driven deforestation especially to the southern border.

After food, we wrap up and head to bed for an early start in the morning.

(END OF PART 3.15 - Part 3.16 next)
