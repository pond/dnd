# Riglan: Part 3.17
## Day 43: Elven Court

It's been a long day of discovery, but we've realised we need to go back to a difficult and dangerous site on Tel'quessir territory where a scrying-obscured, night-opening portal to what we suspect is the Shadowfell exists. We haven't told any of the elves of our plans when we depart (which is in a hurry, given the lateness of the hour).

### Roughly 8pm

Riglan, survival 16+10 -> 26. We're reaching the fey path and Riglan remembers the entrance exactly. While it was almost fully dark before we got into them, within these fey paths the colour and brightness levels are the same - it's another plane, after all!

Soon we're in the mushroom circle and we make haste towards the ridge. Temo wears his goggles, Riglan brings up Darkvision and invisibility all round - Nethza is innate, Temo casts himself and Maireagh uses a higher level spell for her, the dog and this time, Riglan. We're planning to go in by stealth, trying to avoid battle before we go through the door. Once through - all bets are off!

Over the ridge we follow the same path as last time, since we know it and this time even Riglan is invisible. We get to tree circle without a problem and "hide" behind tree trunks (really only so that if any creature springs forth from the gate it won't just run full-tilt into us; there's a tree in the way), observing. Astonishingly, in the dark, the spiral effect is actually visible, physically. It glints a little as it rotates and there's a degree of bioluminescence - fireflies, glow worms, moonlight filtering a bit through leaves. The spiral of blood is somehow still wet, too, glistening itself. The Darkvision we all have helps now, albeit monochrome, as we're able to see different things more starkly.

About 15 minutes pass. There's a tingle that goes down Temo's spine - and just as he's worrying how to alert the party quietly (we didn't think of that before!) it becomes a moot point as the spiral of blood *levitates*, droplets hanging in the air. Then there's an audible, strange creaking and crackling as this spiral "untangles"; the blood towards the middle flows down into a knot as the spiral of blood undoes itself and turns into a circle. In the middle, a dark, purple-ish misty emanation flows down - very, very like the original fissure at the school where Nethza was captured.

Claws grasp at the edge - *upside down* - this thing is floating in the air, but something is crawling "up" as if lifting itself out of a hole, just the wrong way up; reverse gravity. A ravenous-looking, undead jackal or gnoll creature, emaciated, almost skeletal, blind-looking eyes, sniffs the air. Adv stealth all round:

* Riglan 1, 11 -> only 11
* Temo total 31
* Maireagh kinda low
* Nethza also kinda low

...ah, shit. The creature sniffs the air, and seems to notice something. It looks towards Maireagh. Temo considers a sound illusion, not the best spell - he'll lose invisibility - so he tries his luck. He casts, a sound of footsteps in the undergrowth running away near the direction it looks. It's a risk - intelligence check against his DC17 - but it is fooled! It dashes off and Temo hides as best he can behind the tree (flat stealth roll is another 31, very lucky). Maireagh moves towards us, not that we can see it. Riglan waits 15-30 seconds to see if anything else emerges; yet nothing happens; the gnoll though circles back around, once it realises that it was chasing nothing. It's picked up Maireagh's scent, and we can hear it. Riglan whispers hoarsely, "now or never, I'm going in!" and runs up to the hole/door and pulls himself up, then Temo follows and jumps - his intent is to jump up and tumble to land "upside down" on whatever lies beyond. Acrobatics 18+11->29, gravity being strange and trying to make him fall back into the hole; but he manages to roll off the side and lands on the floor; he calls down, hoarse whisper, "on this side the portal is in the ground! Pull yourselves up! Riglan, are you here?" Riglan is and we soon realise that somehow we're all through.

Through where?!

There's a stone floor, surprisingly. We are on some kind of raised, circular stone platform. It's only a little bigger than the portal itself, a stone pineapple ring with another below and below again, stepping out. Crumbling arches. Feels like a stone gazebo of sorts, as if in garden. The sky is bright enough to see with normal vision; purple-blue with streaks of black cloud and larger-shaped clouds, shaped like skulls or bones and so-on! A sort red tint to their edges comes from an orange-red moon.

All around are twisted carcasses of trees. It looks like a Shadowfell dead forest. The terrain beyond is easy enough to see; we see the ridge; it's a copy, a shadow of the world we were just in. Between us and the ridge is a ruined but not *completely* crumbled, massive keep that's about 90ft high. It has huge windows, maybe 15ft high and 10ft wide. It looks like it would have three floors. Square-ish. Some windows are glazed, others have broken glass; a corner looks like it was attacked.

Riglan perception 27. He sees old, dried blood stains in the dead grass and churned earth nearby. They lead towards the keep. He quietly points that out to the group; he thinks we should follow it - we'll follow Temo to the crumbling corner of the keep. Getting closer, smoke is visible from a far corner - out of a window - flickering light inside on the second and third floors. The light shifts as if something or someone walks in front of it sometimes. This place is inhabited.

Riglan whispers to the others to keep hidden here, he'll turn into an invisible raven (no spell cast, no attack yet) and look in the windows.

He starts with the broken window on the second floor. The corner of the building which is damaged has a collapsed floor open over all storeys, but the opposite corner is still intact. There's a space in the centre, too; there seems to be an open stairwell in the going through all floors. There's the carcass of a tree growing in the middle of it! Some rooms come off the sides but most of the intact floor seems to be a main common room. 60-70ft away or so are some very high tables, 16ft up or so, with chairs - some intact, some broken - at a similar scale. Remnants of habitation and a large, empty area without furniture that has lots of sigils drawn on it in blood. *Very* complex. Next to this are giant hats (!) and giant books along with "small" boxes (4-5ft high) that are being used as tables by a strange-looking, pustule-riddled, scraggy/oil-slick haired creature with big missing patches, greyish, ash coloured skin covered in welts and pustules, a heavy brow, wet, oil-slick eyebrows and a huge hooked, bulbous nose; pointy chin; classic witch hag! Big though - about 7ft tall (but not giant). On a lot of the makeshift tables are jars, pans, a kind of strange laboratory, butcher's area, morgue...? All of the above? Lying around in bird cages are starving-looking creatures, but which look undead. Hacked up bits of animal body parts are on most of the tables and there's a giant-sized bowl - here apparently rather like a cauldron - with *something* squirming around in there. There's even a partly hacked-up elf. Then in one bird cage, Riglan sees two naked elves, holding onto each other, very fucked up, with a suggestion by their movements that they might have been blinded.

The light comes from giant lamps in braziers, that would be candles to a giant but small bonfires to us - and the light shifts a bit as a figure moves in front of these various braziers, a grey-skinned, hairless, pasty giant - 22ft tall or so - bulbous eyes, deformed face, drags a shifting shadow behind it - as if it phases in and out somehow. Nature check nat 1+10, Riglan's no idea what this is but fairly sure it's not natural. History 19, he remembers pictures... Fomorian? Something like that. Giants who lived for too long in the fey! Ah, we were being told about those just recently. The story of the origin of the elves. It speaks giant to another one that seems to be upstairs. Riglan flies up to that window. Indeed, another Fomorian. It seems to be sorting through some belongings, crates and bags of stuff - humanoid-sized. Things taken. It eats bigs of animal now and then.

Riglan flies back and shifts back to himself, the whispers, "very, very grim. A witch, or hag, looks powerful, captive elves, fucked up; two giants, fomorians I think? The fey kind. Something weird about their shadows, not going to be an easy fight... I don't think I can leave without trying to save those elves... I don't even know who to try and take down first. One on the top floor, one more on the middle with the hag. Maybe more in side rooms I could't see inside. Not going to be easy."

Temo says, "It never is" and draws his bow, getting it ready. "At least we might have some surprise from invisibility."

Riglan says, "OK, so, storm floor 2 to start, focus on the hag I guess as a caster? Might take the guy upstairs a few seconds to get down." Riglan considers using wildshape to a large creature, to attack the second-floor Fomorian while the others pile on attacks for the hag. The bad guys might think Riglan/creature had come in via the portal and not suspect others are involved, except for logistics with spellcasting tho; he would want to conjure animal(s) first somehow. Tricky. He just instead whispers: "...I'll try and take on the big one, or at least keep it distracted!"

How to get in... Riglan could be a giant eagle to tackle the Fomorian, dropping Temo in the room near the a giant-sized table hopefully maintaining his cover. Nethza can use her cloak to fly without losing invisibility - it just uses a command word, not a spell. Maireagh's boots likewise confer an ability without spellcasting, so both can follow in. Temo says he'd rather use furniture for cover and can still fire arrows on target (sharpshooter) so of the two nearby windows on L2 without glass, he wants the one where a giant-sized table runs just after it. The others decide to follow as they're flying anyway so can skate over the window.

It's on. Riglan changes and goes for it, with Temo in tow. Adv stealth as Eagle, 11,14+3->17. He flies in and drops Temo just inside. Temo stealth 26 by R.T. (rolls 2,8!). He sees that he hasn't been noticed. There's a chair in his flight path but it's giant and close to Temo. He decides that rather than trying to draw their attention - he could just risk it and attack the Fomorian. At his 80ft flying speed, he's able to use the full action as an effective dash from ground level, up the window, drop off Temo then get *right* up to it, just; he is about to attack...

...As Riglan invisibly flies around, Temo strafes sideways under the table to get a clear view of the hag. He's at an advantage by stealth and decides to risk a more tricky attack for potentially better damage (-5 on attack roll for +10 damage if hit). He readies his own attack...

...initiative is rolled for the two of them (who acts first?)

* Temo dirty 20
* Riglan 16

(Unbeknownst to us Nethza has acted quicker than Riglan even off the ground, and uses her full action for max movement. She's within the hag's range, above the makeshift table).

Temo fires, 24-5->19, hits! The 9d6+16 roll is very low though, 26+16, 42 overall. It's a lot but much less than he hoped. Bonus action - hides back behind the table leg. 26.

Riglan's beak goes in! 15, hits; damage is d6+3->(5)->8, solid. Even better, the talons hit too; 2d6+3->(5,6)->14. Good hits.

The Fomorian perceives Temo's attack coming; Riglan's was easy; he's not Surprised (technically). The hag however *was* surprised by Temo (but knew something of Riglan's presence as he flew across the room).

Now the Fomorian acts... It turns to face the giant eagle and swings the closest thing it has to hand - picking up what was probably once a table leg. It's huge! Easy hit - 22 vs AC 13! - for 3d8+6 -> 15 damage. Riglan has 11 left. It swings again, trying to smash Riglan-eagle to the ground; despite a bad roll, 14 vs AC 13. 17 damage; that's enough to take Riglan back to Firbolg and carry 6 damage over. Dex save nat 3! He's prone.

Maireagh manages to reach the far corner of the table under which Temo hides. She's too far from the hag for the hammer and still invisible, so she uses the rest of her action to get closer, dropping the dog down on a table very close to the hag, in melee range. She uses her bonus action to command the dog to attack, which blows her invisibility. The dog loses its own in its subsequent attack. Its gets a solid hit, 1d8+5 + arcane jolt 4d6 -> 23 total (rather low rolls again, but a good hit). 

The hag acts. We're about to find out what this worrisome foe is capable of.

She jumps up onto a nearby small table to try and get closer to Maireagh, then she stretches upwards, elongating, bones cracking; 10ft tall or more; and speaks. "Yes! I have seen you! You are with the *quarry*! Thank you very much for bringing them straight to me! Saves me the work. You might think you are very clever. I assure you, you have just wandered into my nightmare..."

...melee spell attack. Two "nightmare touch" attacks. Maireagh dodges the first, but the second would just hit; Maireagh reacts with L1 shield. The hag seems enraged; "very well then" she says, then there's a weird "flash" of dancing shadows that wrap around her. It's hypnotic to look at. Temo is out of range, so's Riglan, but Maireagh and Nethza *are* in range. Wisdom saving, Nethza 17 against DC15, but Maireagh succumbs. She's confused by this sudden pattern and **effectively charmed**, incapacitated (speed zero); "We are under attack! To my side, servant of the king!" the hag cries and we hear thumping from upstairs. The second Fomorian is on the way.

Nethza figures out via arcana check what's up with Maireagh. She uses her bonus action to cast Hex on the hag, but instead of flying in to attack directly, throws three eldritch blasts - one at the hag, two at Maireagh! The hag's blast goes fully wild (nat 1); another misses Maireagh, but a third is a critical hit (which was needed to punch through Marieagh's effective shielded AC of 27). 2d10+5->whopping 19 damage but she's knocked out of hypnosis.

Temo knows he's been rumbled by the hag so has to risk aiming. He tries his penalty but can't get the hit! 21-5->16, it's not enough. *A wasted turn*. The hag's ribs separate and the crossbow bolt goes through a whole between her ribs.

Riglan stands up, goes invisible and risks trying to move as far as he can away from the Fomorian. Disadv opportunity attack; misses. He quickly considers conjuring the dragon, but we have two Fomorians to distract, so instead casts L*5* Conjure Animals to bring in *four* creatures at L1 - two each to keep the Fomorians busy. Four giant spiders appear! Initiative 13.

One attacks wtih flanking advantage, hitting for 11 and 7 (halved from 15) poison damage (high rolls all round). The second does the same thing, with 9 and 3 (halved) damage again. The third tries to web the one coming down stairs - but it's too far away and misses; the fourth is closer on stairwell wall and tries too. It hits with the web, but the Fomorian easily breaks free.

The first (slightly injured) Fomorian looks at Riglan and starts to speak in some strange, garbled giant language. Riglan feels darkness around closing in; a bulbous eye in the head of the Fomorian glows green; there's a feeling of reality stretching towards him... It's a literal Evil Eye! Riglan needs DC14 CHA save - he has a -1 on that, and only gets 8 total. 18 psychic damage, and Riglan is cursed with magical deformities!

* Speed is halved
* Disadvantage on strength and dex-based ability checks, saving throws and attacks

Nasty. But he might have to live with it and focus on his magic. At least he holds his animals (con save 19). The Fomorian now swings its makeshift great club at spider 2. It hits, with a whopping 26 damage. Only the extra 8 from Riglan's Mighty Summoner keeps it up.

Maireagh is annoyed, perhaps embarrassed from falling prey to the hypnotic spell. She flies a bit further away then throws her hammer twice. Both hit (25 both times); damage 19, 21 respectively. And that's enough! The hag falls! She then commands the dog to run over and protect Riglan. Seeing the hag fall, Riglan shouts in Elvish - "I know you're scared, just hold on, this battle is us trying to save you!"

As the hag goes down, her bones seem to crack and she turns into a puddle of blood. Rising from puddle of blood, pulling away from the bones, something forms; shards of bones lift, the mist of blood takes shape; there's some kind of invisible creature that has been here the whole time that has been feeding on blood. **A gnoll vampire** - the very same one we saw in our battle the previous evening, that ran into the Shadowfell "tear". It stands over the remains of the hag. Nethza shouts a warning!

The gnoll vampire finishes forming. It makes its frightful cackling. We're *all* within range, including all the spiders. All must make a DC15 WIS save else become frightened of the vampire.

* Riglan 23
* Temo 20
* Spider 1 -> 18, 2 -> 11, 3 -> 3, 4 -> 1
* Maireagh fails but is able to help Nethza
* Nethza succeeded with Maireagh's help

To make matters worse, the other Fomorian reaches the base of the stairs, but finds its way blocked by the spiders. This one looks different. It's the one Riglan saw with the strange shadow, he realises; it has around its neck a necklace made of humanoid sculls; it holds a weird twisted staff. The staff is made of a twisted pine, that looks like it was dipped in blood. Strange, deformed growths like gnarled claws, or hands, or body parts appear to grow out of it. It speaks in Giant; Riglan hears it asking the other one - "How many are there? Do I devour them with the darkness?" and the other responds, "There are four in this room, and one small one hidden! The dwarf. The dwarf killed the doctor." - Riglan has no time to warn her.

Riglan sees on its chest that there seem to be fresh scars carved in a rune shape. It holds out what looks like a cadaver that's been stuffed full of - who knows, herbs, bushes? An effigy of sorts. This also has a rune carved into its skin and seems to be used to channel its magic. Corrupting Hex... It uses that on Maireagh. DC16 CHA save, which is almost impossible for her to succeed upon; fails (12). She takes 19 necrotic damage and is cursed for 24 hours:

* Speed is halved
* Whenever she tries to cast a spell, she must succeed on a DC16 intelligence check else the spell fails.

...blood seems to leap from its staff and "binds" Maireagh in sort of cursed, necrotic chains of blood. It's not finished, either. It looks in front of itself at two spiders, Riglan and again Maireagh, 30ft radius sphere, it pulls what look like bones out of a bag, crushes them and throws blood onto the ground in front of it as its eyes glow. It casts a spell "in the name of Azalin Rex" Riglan hears, and he sees an analogy to Nethza calling to the Raven Queen. **This is a warlock**, with Azalin as its patron. A ball of darkness, a pure manifestation of hopelessness, engulf all of us. DC16 CON save.

* Riglan fails badly
* Maireagh succeeds
* Dog fails
* Both spiders just make it

Riglan takes 15 necrotic damage and is blinded until the end of his next turn (but holds his spell). The dog is blinded too.

It is *still not finished*. It throws an eldritch burst, in the same area as the darkness. DC16 DEX save.

* Maireagh fails
* Dog succeeds
* Riglan fails pretty badly
* Spider 2 succeeds (nat 20, wasted!)
* Spider 3 fails very badly

38 force damage for everyone that failed and knocked prone - Maireagh is knocked to the ground.

Nethza is very alarmed and thinks this new arrival is by far the most serious thing; much of the party just got very badly injured in one go by this strange new giant. She flys around next to Maireagh. She assesses the new Fomorian's power - (DM dice roll to determine that she knows) Power Word Stun just won't work on it, so she shifts the hex curse onto it - and instead tries Power Word Stun on the vampire, which works.

Temo takes the hint; he aims and fires at the new fomorian. Hits, but another bad damage roll; only 34 total.

Riglan tries to stand, but can barely move. He steps back away from the dog that he can feel next to him, but can't move far. He doesn't realise he had an opportunity attack from the giant; but somehow, it manages to miss despite advantage. He drops in the bear totem right next to him (not bad, most of the party except Temo and one spider benefit), calls to Maireagh that if she can get close he can help her then casts L2 Lesser Restoration on himself to cure his blindness (unaware that it would be about to wear off anyway).

Spider 1 misses, spider 2 gets a hit for 11 total damage with poison, spider 4 just tries to attack no advantage on the new Fomorian; hits with 16, for a dreadful 4+2 total damage (1, 1, 3 rolled on the d8s). The first Fomorian attacks spider 2, which took damage before. Hits, 3d8+6->25 damage; 3 points left! Attacks again; hits, 17 damage. Now that Fomorian approaches up to Riglan and the dog, both in 5ft melee range. The spider behind hits with an opportunity attack at least, doing 10+6 (con save fail for once!) damage.

Maireagh gets up, moves a bit towards Riglan then is just in range of the new Fomorian and attacks immediately with the hammer. Two hits! She also commands the dog to attack (it has to move to attack the new arrival, but stays in range of the other Fomorian in so doing; no opportunity attacks arise). The dog just misses though. Maireagh gets 3d8 on her hammer throw against giants - but only 18 in the first hit; then a more solid 25 for the second hit. 43 total. She adds in another Arcane Jolt, 20 more from that. She manages to break the fear effect from the vampire gnoll, too.

The gnoll vampire meanwhile tries to break *its* own issue, DC20 con save for the stun. Fails! Still stunned.

Bad news - the warlock Femorian acts. It has another chance to try its darkness effect. 

* Riglan fails horribly again
* Maireagh is OK
* Nethza is OK
* Dog fails

Riglan and the dog both take 11 necrotic damage. The warlock attacks the spider behind it; hits; 22 bludgeoning and 7 necrotic damage. Attacks again, hits again; 19+6 - the spider is gone. It has a third attack, too; but somehow, it *just* misses the dog! 16 vs AC 17.

Nethza has hex on the warlock Femorian. She adds Hexblade's Curse for good measure. She flies out a distance, as she's got good attack range. She throws 3 eldritch blasts, thinking those would cause the most damage with all the hexes on. That's 1d10+1d6+10 3 times over. Hit, hit, hit! 20, 16, 18. Fairly low damage rolls but, still, 54 total.

Temo aims and fires, aiming at the sigil on its chest wondering if he can disrupt that somehow. 5,20! Crit... 18d6+6. Woah. 81 damage! **That takes it down** - it rips through the cadaver effigy and it pins this to the sigil on the chest, which seems to cause some nasty combination of magics that interfere; the giant withers and starts to fall, calling out Azalin's name - "do not forsake me master!" - but then collapses. Down!

Riglan can't even see that. He knows he's right next to the first Fomorian. He - almost in a panic - rakes at it with primal savagery and despite being blinded he gets a hit. 3d10->16 acid damage. He activates the staff and then, to his surprise, his sight returns - and *now* he realises that he didn't the Lesser Restoration. Behind the Fomorian the remaining giant spider walks up, flanks with Riglan and attacks. 11 damage total (poison halved, yet again).

It retaliates. It swings angrily at the spider behind, hitting for 18 damage. The spider is still up. But then it uses its Evil Eye on Maireagh... CHA save is failed; she takes 28 psychic damage. But now Maireagh retaliates herself, throwing the hammer; both hit (just). The dog has a go but can't get a hit. First hammer hit 23, second hammer hit 20. 43 total. And it turns out - that is *exactly* what was needed to make it fall. As it falls, she blows an arcane jolt - but this time, to heal. Riglan gains 12. He shouts, "Thank you, well done, vampire behind you!"

Speaking of which - the vampire tries to shake the stun... Rolls a 2 and amazingly, stays stunned!

Well then. Nethza shifts the hex and throws eldritch blasts (knowing Riglan has Sunbeam). Hit, hit, but a double 1 on the third (oops). 12 and 15 -> 27 total damage. Temo fires, with the attack disadvantage for another +10; hits; 48 damage. Riglan thanks and releases the spider, shuffles painfully forward to get a line of fire and casts Sunbeam. The vampire fails its con save (15 vs DC20) and a high damage roll yields 34 damage, which is enough - it's all radiant so it takes 68 effective; a beam of sunlight from the staff just incinerates it!

Riglan says in Elven, "Well, that was fucking awful but we won..." - but sweeps the undead animal cages with sunbeam to destroy all of them. He shuffles to the elven cage and calls Temo over for the lock, but asks in Elven, "Do you know the nature of your blindness". They are barely capable of speech, terrified, but show horribly mutilated eyes. Riglan says, "I can help one of you with on eye each day." They each insist he heals the other. He says, "I have to pick one, my apologies to the other, but I promise, first thing in the morning, I will attend to you." "Please heal my daughter!" "Please heal my mother!" - Riglan casts L7 Regenerate on the daughter, saying, "A mother would never forgive me for leaving her daughter blind. DON'T look at the table, please."

Over the course of the next two minutes, the daughter is essentially fully healed. Maireagh helps the mother with L3 Cure Wounds too. Sadly, sight has to wait until tomorrow, but she's otherwise fully healed. Riglan explains hastily that we're in a Shadowfell domain and there is a portal so we will leave...

...but the mother points at the cauldron and says we must burn all the worms in the cauldron. **They carry the infection**. Riglan is very happy to spend time with Produce Flame to achieve that! There are some in jars, petri dishes... Earthworms, but fully infused with this necrotic magic. We can stop these from being spread but how would we ever get that cleaned out of the forest?

Meanwhile, Temo checks out what has been happening here. Arcana - lucky roll, 19+5 -> 24. Maireagh assists. He finds writings in Fey language - he wears the Helm. It's the hag's notes. "The Doctor". She has been creating things. She must kidnap, torture and frighten things; mutilate creatures in front of other creatures, who care about them to generate and distill fear and hatred. This is then put into a brew that's fed to earthworms. She uses her creatures to run out and spread the worms into the ground. The earthworms spread the poison to the network which then infects any trees.

It's lucky for the Tel'quessir that these creatures tended to run South, keeping their forest clean so far.

What's more, this area has access to *multiple* portals. There *are* more of them - perhaps hidden by the anti-scrying, as we figured perhaps. We need to close those to stop more things coming through. Best we can do is figure out how to close the one we've got. Maireagh collects all the notes - the elves might be able to help fix things if they know the details.

Temo also finds potions... A collection.

* A Philter of Love
* Two Potions of Clairvoyance
* A Potion of Cloud Giant Strength
* A Potion of Mind Control for Beasts
* A Potion of Speed 

Temo gets back to Riglan and whispers to him what they learned; Riglan goes back to the elves and says in Elven, "I can only imagine what you've been put through. But you *are* safe now. Come with us, we'll get to the portal." They say they're Border Patrol; which is useful; we can help them get back to Elven Court. Unfortunately though the portal arises on Tel'quessir land - but the daughter thinks she can find the entrance *they* used.

We all help, this time down the huge stairs - probably not much easier than scaling the walls outside really! - but we make it. Riglan's slowing everyone down, so is Maireagh. Riglan only has one spell slot left powerful enough for Greater Restoration; before Maireagh can object, he casts L5 Greater Restoration on her. This breaks the curse. He says, "if I'm still a mess in the morning, I'll do the same for myself."

In the end being slow doesn't matter so much - the mother is slow too. We're leaving a bit before 11pm; it's around 2am by the time we're reaching Elven Court. But we *do* make it.

## Day 44: Elven Court
### 2am

We move slowly in, but we're quickly spotted by a night patrol. People are overjoyed! We hand over the books and they insist we go to bed. We don't need convincing.

### 6000XP each

Long rest.

### 10am

In the morning, Riglan CHA save, 17-1 -> 16. That scrapes past the DC! He's shaken his curse. The deformities begin to recede; it'll take a while to look normal again but it doesn't hurt anymore.

We are met almost immediately after waking up - a scout was waiting! The Coronal and the Master Sage want to see us in court. We haven't eaten in a long time, at least a day, but we're told there will be food there!

We learn that they've been working through the night researching. The nature of the curse is understood, and exactly how it targets the fungal networks within the soil via the worms. **They think they can cure it!**  They reckon they can use magic to find and kill worms, then cure the fungal network to pass that healing to trees. Before they just kept healing trees, but they'd be reinfected. The Coronal will being everyone together to reconvene and replan based on all the new information.

We thank them - it's a good victory. Better yet, now that they understand how to find portals and now that there's less chance of being snatched - that's why news had never returned before - dispatches are sent out to shut them down.

Riglan asks after the mother and daughter; he needs to help restore her sight. We head there directly and he has the pleasure of casting L7 Regenerate and within a couple of minutes, she can see again. The mother opines - "This is a great and ancient evil that has returned. It has crept under us, it has come through the forest. We *must* rise to meet it... We must... And if those from outside have come in to help, then it is the very least we can do."

Riglan is offered the choice of working with the strategists, or helping the Seldarine heal the forest. Temo and Nethza work with the Coronal (**Ilsevele**), while Maireagh assists Riglan with a delivery mechanism for the cures that the druids come up with.

### 6pm

Some eight hours later, a cure is created, tested and works. The elves must basically just water the ground with this tonic - a kind of spray, but think they might even be able to infuse rain. It'll take many days but they think in time they'll be able to cover the entire forest.

Temo and Nethza meanwhile have spent time with Coronal. A delegation including herself with be sent to the Tel'quessir to make a plea for assistance. He asks if we should try for Myth Drannor. He sees that same look; insight 13 to recognise it; he tries with Nethza's help to persuade her to open up. A very solid 15+15->30 persuasion.

He discovers that the Coronal is one of the long-lived Miritar. She came back from Evermeet. She left this land around 1,400 years ago, coming back a few hundred years ago, so started ageing again then. She's seen a lot! The fall of elven kingdoms... She recalls Myth Drannor in its glory, seeing it rising but also seeing it destroyed; but most of all she said goodbye to her "one love" when she left to the West, all that time ago, 1,400 years. When she returned, she found that the Captain of the Knights of Myth Drannor was her love resurrected to lead them. She'd mourned him for centuries; to see him again but lose him once more in Myth Drannor but know this time that his body has been destroyed and no resurrection is possible, was something she struggled with a lot. She questioned whether to use the resources at her command to actually reincarnate him, but in the end realised she must go through the mourning process to let him go. It had taken nearly 200 years to get over this before; she might need another 200 years to do the same. Every thought of Myth Drannor "brings him back; the wound is too fresh". The last 50-60 years haven't dampened the loss.

"I don't know what you will find there. I simply cannot think of it. But you are right; we do need to go and speak to the survivors, those who remain in Myth Drannor, those who are still alive, those who wouldn't leave to follow me here - they are still part of the nation of Cormanthor, even if they're not part of the Kingdom."

She sighs.

She draws her blade and scabbard together. A beautiful, mithril blade; looks ancient; hands it to Temo. "Use this to wield the authority and the favour of the Miritar line, and bring them back. Bring them home to me. And return that in one piece! That belonged to my great grandfather. It's older than any human nation!"

(It's a "sword of rulership", wielded only with those with the divine right (!) to rule a nation; the wisdom, courage and temperament that are appropriate are the only ones for whom the blade will appear).

Temo nods as solemnly as he can. "We'll do our best and, as ever, we'll protect these things and these people with our lives."

Riglan asks his party how much they saw of the big table in the keep where we rescued the elves. "Not sure", is the consensus - so he asks for privacy and they oblige. He describes the "third elf on the table" and the implications for what the two who we rescued might have witnessed; they are being very brave but might need substantial support to heal their spirit. The Coronal will make sure they have proper support.

She shows Riglan a mark on the back of the seed. "This seed was harvested by my father!" - but she will not carry it or keep it safe. "It was entrusted to *you*. The seed found its way to you. This seed is an essence of our world; but it is not *of* our world. It listens to the songs of the cosmos. It goes where it must. We are merely the waters of the river that carry it to its next destination."

"Well, I suppose, at least, if I fall, maybe it can grow there, wherever it may be."

"It has its own story and its own song. It is the next generation. What it carries within predates the world upon which we now stand. Do you understand?" "Yes." "It exists both outside, and before the very plane we are in - before this shard of reality existed on its own. This comes from the tree which pulled together all the strands into what we now know call 'our world'."

"I hope then that I live long enough, to become wise enough to understand it better! And perhaps pass it on myself in due course."

"You *are* a druid. This much I know. You know the animals, the insects and the plants. A minnow swimming in a stream - you know these minnows. Picture this... We are those minnows, in that stream. Can a minnow ever hope to grasp and comprehend the world of the sky and the trees and the beasts that roam the land? Its world is that stream. It is all that it knows and all that it can understand. Some things are just *beyond* us. They are not meant for us, and we are not meant for them. I hope that gives you some solace; a form of peace."

"It reminds me to trust the seed more than myself."

Then Riglan asks if we must convey the sword back from Myth Drannor, or if - should they agree to join - they can bring it, in case we have to hurry to the coast. She goes quiet, thinking, for more than a minute! A strangely distant look in the eyes. Eventually she says, "We shall see what fate has in store - if the sword of rulership is meant to find its way back to me, then events will play out in a way which allows it to return. If not, then my time has run its course."

"Then we are privileged to have witnessed some of that time. And I will take up no more of it. We shall leave for Myth Drannor as soon as we can."

Her eyes seem to change, as if her sight had been moved to another plane somehow, while thinking. She smiles. "Thank you."

Riglan bids farewell and hurries out to catch up with the party. We get into a debate about "what next"? Where's Azalin going - and why?

In practice, we end up spending the day with their sages. Myth Drannor is pressing but there's no point having an army raised and no idea what to do with it or more to the point, no idea what to tell people if they ask where - and why - the enemy is moving.

The question is put to us: Why not just go a little South, perhaps even routing Sembia - a great many humans both alive and dead there - then go across direct to the Anauroch? Sure, the dead outnumber the living by a great margin in the killing fields but these are elves; even with the dead, they're unlikely to outnumber the living *and dead* in the big human cities! We wonder if it's about magical artefacts? We are told that after the fall of Myth Drannor, they were all gathered - elven and Netherese - and brought to Elven Court. Now, surely, *that* must be tempting. In addition, Elven Court was at the head of his takedown a few hundred years before; but he'll know from all his minions and portals that they're diminished. So, perhaps he travels here - for revenge, to defeat Elven Court and, all the while, going across the killing fields as he heads North-West. Enticed by the living, the dead and the magical. He'd cut roughly in the direction of what we have on our map as Hillsfar, give or take, picking up bodies as he goes before entering Zhentil and going towards the keep, within a nation of people he would see as allies, army greatly expanded and with Cormanthor already defeated. No repeating of his history this time.

And so it goes on. The research about gory things like estimated counts of dead or living in various nations, magical artefacts, possible military responses and so-on takes all day.

Night falls. The Coronal and seers elect to consult with the stars and spirits - they will consult with the Seldarine. We're led up the ancient tree, to its top; it's more wide than fall, but even so is about 140ft high at its peak. There's a basin of sorts at the top of the trunk where branches spread off - not too dissimilar from the frog pools at Shadowtop, but very large. Elegant bridges are built around it, and it has the appearance of a scrying pool. They call it the "Place Of Channeling." It taps into the trees and amplifies through the forest. They can cast the ritual of Gentle Repose here, using the forest to transmit the power of the spell.

This tree has been killed before, but always seems to regrow around itself - this is what leads to so many of the open spaces, now used as halls, within.

They commence a ritual. The air goes still. The water becomes a mirror. There's a glow that seems to come off the three sage-priests and Coronal. They start to stand, almost as if being pulled by a thread connected to their heads; then they float, toes pointed down, a small distance above the tree. Misty visions start to form, milky light from the moon...

...Perception, Riglan 26, Temo (via Luck) 25. Both see a vision of the Coronal Ilsevele in a beautiful antique gold breastplate covered in extremely ornate burnished carvings and elven script, her hair almost looks on fire from the moonlight - a gleaming silver - and she wields the Mithril blade, which glows radiantly. She jumps from tree limb to tree limb, here in Elven Court; the archers and Elfguard all in full battle regalia are fighting furiously, gathering around her in tight formations, defending - a wave of undead, deformed creatures, deathlocks, wraiths, more - descending upon them, taking them down one by one, **until a jagged double blade pierces through her breastplate and all the light fades from her. The moment she fades, all the trees around start to wither and die.** This is a vision of the forest and Elven Court falling to this wave of undead, crashing over them. A last stand.

There is silence. It feels like an eternity. The pool returns to a mirror; the sage priests, visibly shaken, awaken; the Coronal holds a stoic, severe and resolved demeanour. She says nothing as she lets the save priests compose themselves and come to terms with what they've seen.

She catches the gaze of Temo and Riglan. She looks quizzical. We nod. Riglan clears his throat and says, "Is that merely a possible future?"

"This is the way of the Seldarine. They share visions with us and we have to understand what they are saying. There is truth in what we see, but everything else we have to fill in and understand. I believe *that* is what will happen should we decide to hold our last stand here."

But the priests say they can't leave; this is the only place they can cast Gentle Repose with enough power. The Coronal opines that perhaps they fall there - casting until the last minute. Azalin can merely wait that out for 7 days before moving on, but that buys time. **Elven Court either way must be evacuated**. There's discussion of to where; of all places, Myth Drannor. It's where they mustered the army last time. We're told that our trip there is now even more important! We want them to join the fight but, if nothing else, at least permit everyone to gather there.

### 10:30pm

Our travel is urgent. Questions remain, but they must be answered later. On Riglan's mind most of all - **why did the forest die?** - but "your journey cannot wait" were her words!

It'll take about 20 minutes to get to a fey path, 40 minutes on the path then 20-30 after that to reach Myth Dranor. We'd arrive around midnight. We descend the tree and get guided to the path.

The Fey is as wild and interesting as ever. On exit, Riglan survival 19; he's been given directions and he understands the woods quite well at this point. This area is very old though - ancient trees, dense and in some areas - but for being a druid! - so dense as to be impassable for some. Riglan asks animals for help from time to time. Vines and undergrowth sometimes seem to yield, strangely, as he walks that way; as if the forest responds to his presence and gives him permission to travel deeper.

After about half an hour, with a good distance being covered in that time, he reaches an area with a bit of a clearing - the moonlight is brighter and there's some clear sky above. He looks up towards a ridge; Riglan arcana 18+0 (lucky!) - there seems to be magic of fey and nature. He senses almost hanging shards, of ancient broken magic, just frozen in the air - as if cracked glass. Then it "feels" like some of these shards are on the ground or wedged in trees. It's all that remains of the Mithil that once protected this city. And now he realises he can see what would once have been a grand, beautiful city, concentric rings heading up to a peak at the ridge where a tower once stood, now crumbled; and as he gets his eye in, he spots the ruins of a different style of buildings, toppled and mixed in amongst it.

Riglan had always assumed that to a degree the "cities colliding" was alliterative; alluding to a battle. But now he sees that this literally was the physical reality. It's hard to ever imagine such a thing in the mind's eye. From one side to the other, the limits of destruction looks like it's a mile wide!

Nature is trying to grow around it, but it'll be a long time before ruins of this scale can be hidden.



## Day 45 - approaching Myth Drannor
### Midnight

Temo has his goggles on since it's dark; adv perception 25; he notices on a few of the remaining buildings towards his left, on the outskirts. We're looking towards the middle and it looks like there's a plane of destruction - from our left, something flew in and crashed to the right, carving off tower tops and so-on as it came down. But on a building to one side, at the outskirts, Temo sees movement. A glinting of metal. We've been spotted by a scout.

Do we wait? Or do we move on? We know nothing much of its culture or rules. They've seen us. And we got through the forest, so that must stand for something. After a brief debate, Riglan says that we should proceed to the middle. Weapons stowed, no stealth; we're not trying to hide. We aim for the central tower.

We're soon navigating through ruined streets. At this point, Temo is more confident than Riglan; survival adv., 17. He winds through difficult territory to reach a wider boulevard that's much easier to traverse. We reach a turn where we must come off the road to skirt a crumbled building. As we clear it...

...Temo perception 16, Riglan despite disadvantage - all he has is his shoulder-mounted light - 17,19+10->27! We turn the corner and Riglan notices, without being surprised, **two spectral horses with riders atop**. They rear up; swords are drawn; shields held; they seem to be **spectral knights** in ancient elven armour.

The horses drop back to all fours. Swords are levelled at us. A whisper in Elven. "Who dares invade the sanctity of the streets of Myth Drannor?" - Temo gets his helm on and hears the last few words as Riglan says, "We are Riglan, Maireagh, Nethza and Temo. We come here on behalf of the Coronal of Elven Court. We seek an audience with whoever speaks for the living of Myth Drannor." Temo adds, "And we have *this* to prove the truth of our words" - and shows the sword. But one says "You have slaughtered the true Coronel! The **Akah'velahr** will have their revenge!" and charges at us! But another knocks their sword away; "That's not your decision to make. We will take them to the Captain".

Temo calls out, "We will go with you, of course. But remember - this sword would *not appear to me* if it was stolen. It would vanish!" - this does give them pause for thought, but then, "That is for the Captain to decide!"

We are escorted to a building near the centre; the ruins of a keep, the sturdy design of which keeps it in better condition than a lot of other buildings around. Along the way, we spy other residents, peeking out around corners or windows, seeing who we are.

Inside, we meet living elves face to face. This is very strange - the living and the undead side by side, co-operating. But then again - there's Renwick, our lich friend. The spectres do not dismount, riding *through* the building at times. Literally! We are taken through to a courtyard. There is another knight here, next to some kind of apparition, which seems to be - well, phasing in and out, is the best way to describe it. Perhaps not undead, then, but just not entirely in this plane. As we get closer, it seems to shift "definitively" into this realm. **A unicorn!**

Our escorts greet the captain (who is also undead). "We bring you these four who we found wandering the streets of Myth Drannor. They claim to have the Sword of Rulership rightfully in their possession!"

The knight turns around immediately; Riglan insight 19+10, lucky. A range of emotions play out on this ghost's face - an almost violent response of anger at first; then he sees it and recognises the sword; Riglan reads emotions of grief and sadness - a great loss. Great pain. This is the husband of the Coronal, **Fflar Melruth**. Riglan says, "I'm sorry, yes, this was given to us by Ilsevele. She grieves too. But the needs is great, and we were sent."

It takes him a moment; the ghost places his hand on the unicorn as if to steady himself. "Tell me the truth. How did you come to possess this blade?"

Riglan asks if they have Truth Spells. He just says, "Speak and I will know". So Riglan does so; the short version. As he's close, Riglan feels an aura, as if a paladin - but this is an undead. As Riglan is reciting the short story he interrupts, leans in and asks, "Does she still live?" "Oh yes" "Then the situation must be grave indeed."

He's surprised when we mention Azalin. "But he was killed!" "He couldn't be. He was a lich." "We were tricked?!" - he reveals that the Dark Powers had approached a small number of elves to dispose of him, and they believed they had.

We explain as best we can.

"Although we can provide him refuge, the items held at Elven Court should not be brought here. They should be dispersed - decentralised. If they were to concentrate in one place it would merely draw his gaze."

If each scout is responsible for a certain number of artefacts, he thinks they can be scattered reasonably well across all of Cormanthor. Those scouts can then retrieve them; the knowledge of their location is itself decentralised.

We are offered a place to stay for the night.

"May I touch the blade?" he asks. "Of course!" - he reaches out very carefully. His spectral hand touches the blade; it glows under the moonlight; he seems overcome by emotion. "It's good to know that she is alright." "As far as I can tell, she cares for you as much you for her." "Yes, but we can never be." "I know." "If you do stay, it would be a distinct pleasure and delight to see you again in the next moon rise." Riglan asks what he means? He explains - he and his soldiers only exist by the grace of Selune. So he's asking us to wait until tomorrow night. Riglan says, "Oh yes, we can certainly stay at least that long. I had thought we would need to spend perhaps many days getting to know and understand your people before you would even listen to us!" "Ah, but I command only the Akah'velahr, the ancient guardians of Myth Drannor. It is *her* you need to convince" - the leader of the remnants. We will see her in the morning. But the Akah'velahr give us their blessings to remain.

We ask if we should just camp up anywhere? We're told we can just look around - there are many empty rooms and buildings. Riglan and Temo look around but can't get their eye in (low survival rolls) so in the end Temo just casts Tiny Hut outside the keep and we camp there.

### 9am

We take up and Temo dispels the hut. We see people gathered around, watching and probably wondering what we're even doing here! They observe at a distance. Some younger ones are hiding behind walls, watching. Maireagh sets about making breakfast; Riglan in Elvish offers to share food and drink but it seems to mostly frighten people.

We head into the keep to see if there's anyone there. Investigation 25, Temo finds clear evidence that there were definitely elves here last night - but nobody hear now. We head back outside Riglan asks gently into the hiding "crowd", "please could we speak with the leader of the remnants?" (he casts Bless on himself to try and help; persuasion total is 21; maybe someone will approach us?)

From a building on the street to the right, leading out from where the keep is towards another block, appears an elf. They seem a bit less afraid; observing us; trying to figure something out. Riglan insight nat 20+10->30. A conflicted mix of curiosity but very strong, almost taut fear and caution. They "know" they should not talk to us. Riglan says, "I am sorry if we cause you fear or distress. I know it is very strange for us to be here. We carry the Blade of Rulership from the Coronal of Elven Court. We hope to be able to talk with someone, if that is OK?"

The curious elf thinks for a while, then appears to indicate that he will leave, but then come back. We sit down to wait, trying to look not threatening. Temo plays the dulcimer; performance 23. While he does this, Riglan looks around; perception 18; the city seems quite unusual - a mixture of intact but neglected buildings and others which are crushed/crumbled and ruined. A few beautiful imposing stone towers are dotted around but all are badly damaged. The keep is hefty stone, but yet the brickwork is fine, small stones and lattices. A lot of other buildings - wooden, perhaps even grown and once elegant, have either crumbled / died, or become misshapen. There is a lot of debris on the streets, including things that look like bridges that collapsed onto the lower buildings - perhaps once connecting towers, originally suspended high up.

The keep is being roughly kept in order - in use - but that's about it. Nothing else around looks like an existing, functioning city. If we didn't see people living here, we would consider it abandoned - derelict - at least in the area we can see. Of course, there's a great deal elsewhere and maybe there are better repaired areas.

After only about five minutes or so, we see the elf - a young male - returning across nearby rooftops before dropping down onto a large stone block a bit closer to us than before. Following behind is an older male elf, dressed in more of a ranger-like outfit. He starts to speak in Elven, while slowly - cautiously - approaching.

"I am told you stayed the night. You have passed the test of the Akah'velahr. But why do you walk among the living here, in a city of the dead?"

Riglan says, "We carry a request from the Coronal of Elven Court - a request we share ourselves. A terrible evil approaches. Elven Court must be evacuated. We hope you will grant permission for elves to, as they once did before, return here and marshal for battle."

He seems to be thinking - as if wondering what he could possibly do. The young elf looks as if pleading. This is clearly not a leader, it is a scout.

Riglan continues, "I do not if it's permitted, but perhaps if we could speak to the leader of your people?"

There's something going on here. Some kind of rule that would need to be broken. The ranger is considering it himself.

Riglan suggests, "I can sense a struggle. It seems our presence causes distress; perhaps there are rules, about visitors; are you permitted to explain those?"

The older elf sighs. "You've passed the test; so you are permitted to be here. But you do not look like you are here to stay - and none living may live Myth Drannor alive."

Riglan says, "Ah, I understand. Then the dilemma is more one for us than you! Is this a matter of secrecy, or perhaps a magical restriction of some kind?"

"I do not question the wisdom of the elders who rose to protect the remnants who were abandoned by the kindgom. It is not my place. You are clearly not of..." (lists elven heritages) "...people of the art. Yet you wield the art, or you would not have passed."

Riglan says, "We passed because of the sword..."

He interrupts "...no, you must wield the art to pass the forest which shields us. But you are clearly not people of the art!"

Riglan says, "Ah, I see. Yes, we do have magical abilities. Fortunately, they are nothing like the Netherese. But we are able to manipulate the weave in a modest fashion."

He says, "The choices are, I think, to appeal for permission for you to be a part of this community despite not being of the correct descent; or to -" he sighs again "- be an outsider, and therefore perhaps then I *must* bring you forward for judgement."

Riglan says, "Much as being accepted by any new community is a thing of great joy, you are correct; we did not intend to stay; we have much to do to fight the coming evil. So, although it may be a riskier path for us, we must submit to your judgement."

He pulls out a small carved bone horn and blows on it. From the area around immediately emerge four more elves dressed similarly. They advance forward and they speak - he's explaining - "...it is by our tradition and laws our duty to convey them safely, bodily, to tribunal such that their fate may be decided. They are outsiders, yet they have discovered us." Some debate ensues; the acceptance by the Akah'velahr is a pretty big deal and seems to be in our favour. They also note that we arrived in the night and met the Captain.

They come forward - with an air of menace - and usher us up the hill towards the crumbled stone towers - but then past them, into what might've been an amphitheatre once; then down into passageways - maybe alleyways *grown* between buildings once - until we reach a clearing of sorts, sunlit. One has run ahead and we find there, to meet us, three definitely older elves. One bears the scars of war - a badly damaged arm, scarred face. An older woman, maybe 400 or more, and a somewhat younger woman. 

In Elven, they thank the rangers - "the Wildguard" - for bringing "these intruders" forward. They ask "who shall speak for you?"

Riglan says, "Although my small friend here with his strange helm can understand you, only I can speak your language; so I must speak for the group."

They say they will pose questions. The first is that we are outsiders who come here with purpose and are not surprised to find people. True? Yes - we were told how to get here by Elven Court. Confused looks. Then, "Regardless of that, we will approach your situation with an open mind and kindness." (**Regardless** of that. Wow.) "You arrived in the night and have, one way or another, passed the test of heart and spirit of the Akah'velahr. What puzzles me is that you do not wish to stay, as that is my understanding?"

Riglan does his best to explain - basically, there's a fight at hand.

"The rules are clear. They must stay or be removed" says the male elf. "They cannot leave willingly; they must in fact not leave at all."

Riglan says, "Why?"

"You know where we are. You know how to get here. You know that Myth Drannor has not been engulfed entirely. So it is dangerous - it is dangerous for you to leave. We have enough to fight against *within* the city to protect our own. We would welcome more to aid in the struggles, but we cannot battle too fronts at the same time."

Riglan explains that one of our requests is that more elves will certainly be visiting! But he asks what they battle. "The city is rent open with rifts into the lower planes. We face regular incursions of various fiends and yugoloths. We defend what we can, but we stay here, we remain... We are those who remain. This is our home and though the elven nation may have abandoned it and abandoned us, we will not abandon the city of love, the city of song, the city of bards, the city of the art and the rightful and true home of the children of the Seldarine."

Riglan says, "And these rifts appeared after the collision, or recently?"

"They appear randomly but they have been appearing for the last 3 decades, since the fall."

Between that and the mention of Yugoloths - that's not the Shadowfell; that's worlds of demons.

Riglan tries, "Ilsevele Miritar seems to hold great grief and great regret, in part because she is forever separated now from her lover, Fflar Melruth, who we had the privilege of meeting shortly after our arrival. It is startling to hear your feelings of abandonment. We lack the insight and understanding of all that happened to be able to express what it is that we need to convey. I wonder, perhaps, would you be kind enough to spend time to teach us the stories of what really happened?"

Those who remain were, they say, abandoned. They believe very deeply that the elves should never have abandoned Myth Drannor. It's a core to their very existence. Yet the Coronal took all the people and the artefacts and left, saying "come with me or stay; but you'll die if you stay".

Conversation is difficult. Both sides are right! They don't know why the Coronal left - basically, love, centuries old and overwhelmingly powerful; but in turn, when she left the rifts were not open; she doesn't know they're open either. That's why nobody's come to help - neither side has talked to one another.

Much of their fear of discovery is from how thinly stretched they are too - they are effectively defenceless. And if they're not here, they can't protect the world from the rifts.

And on it goes...



## Day 46 - Myth Drannor

...on through the next day; meeting the knights again under the moon; talking to residents, trying to understand more. It comes down to something specific: "Let *her* come here to lead them back. She can face us and look us in the eye. She owes us at least that much. To treat us with dignity."

Riglan obviously agrees. That's the compromise, at least in the way it seems worded. She can't come beforehand; she leads her elves back, in person. So if that's taken as-is, she *cannot* be at the "last stand" of Elven Court. We can't be sure, it's messy, the conversations for the last two days have been very difficult. Anger, righteousness, grief; and we're speaking on *her behalf*, we're not even elven. It's like having half an argument.

**By the end of the day, it's settled. That's the cost; we'll have to make it work.**



## Day 47 - Myth Drannor

To work around the rules about leaving, we are appointed as messengers to deliver the response to the Coronal. This is a relief - after two days of negotiations about the elves, we hadn't even got around to negotiating our own release from Myth Drannor! We also solemnly promise to **never reveal not only the location of this place, but ever tell anyone that we were even here outside of Cormanthor**. The process of working through this takes, again, another day; more learning, more understanding.

"Myth Drannor comes and goes in cycles. This is not the first time that it has fallen, but it rises like a phoenix each time. When we are ready, we will restore Myth Drannor and open its doors to the world."

* Riglan flat insight 23; perception aided by Temo, adv. 25.

* Over the course of the prior two days and this third day, we see no rifts open. We learn that they are very sporadic and catches them by surprise - so that makes it much more difficult; they must be on alert all the time, just in case. They think it's a collision of the magic from the other city that kept it flying, and the mythil that kept Myth Drannor protected, which tears reality sometimes.

* We estimate a few thousand survivors spread across the whole place. There are many warriors. Perhaps they will be persuaded to spare *some* when the other elves arrive.

* That said, they behave like a population under siege. Resources are carefully conserved. They're cautious, wary and always on guard, but they *are* trying to rebuild - culture first, city later.

* The strong sense of identity explains more of why they are so closed to the outside world. They seem even more isolationist than the Tel'quessir; the elves here remember and recount times over millennia when, for a few centuries at a time, Myth Drannor's doors were open to others. But because of difference in lifespan and procreation rates, at times they became almost minorities - under threat in their own city. They don't want this to happen again in future.

* Temo has noticed that magic "feels" different, Riglan too once Temo mentions it - when Temo cast the hut, it seemed easier - stronger, almost hard to control in some ways, but a clearer/less "dampened" pool of magic. It surprises us as we'd almost expect the reverse from a damaged weave, but instead it's just harder to control yet stronger.

* **Gentle repose could be tried from here** as amplification is possible but the risks would be higher; it could go badly wrong. Strong spellcasting from a place as damaged as this is not something to try lightly.

Later that day, there is unexpected excitement. A rift appears! We run to assist. Strange, insect-like demons spill out, followed by larger demons with strange fox heads. What strikes us is that it looks organised - like an army - as if they'd been waiting for this and were prepared. While defenders fight, us included, sages work on the magical incantations to close the rift down. The demons are very persistent; they don't retreat; they can't really die for good since they just return to their own plane. **This is a forever battle. No matter how many are vanquished, they all return.** This is the plight of the citizens here.

The dust settles. The moon rises.

* The oaths of the Akah'velahr Guard, taken to defend the city, means they're bound to this plane. They cannot be released in death until their task is complete - the city of Tulthantar is still "here", in pieces, but its magic also is here, interfering and they think being part of the reason for rifts opening; so the threat remains, in essence. Fix the rifts and clear the debris to be free. No easy task.

* Persuasion, Riglan, adv from Temo; almost as high as he can ever get - 19+4->23. It's not huge, but it's just about enough for the Akah'velahr to follow the Captain, who is emotionally in a bit of a mess. The Coronal is coming *here* and he's not seen her in a long time. He can't leave here unless it is to fulfil his duty. **"If she comes", he says, "and reclaims her place, then as a defender of Myth Drannor, if Myth Drannor falls back within the nation of Cormanthor, then I would be pledged to defend the Coronal." If she rides into war, he and his troops would be able to ride with her.**

* He shows us a large, strange looking, piece of crystal; moonstone perhaps, but with a kind of space in the middle. This is where the sword would be if there was no worth ruler - encased up to the hilt, completely buried in the crystal. It was put in place after the 2nd Crown War as a sort of punishment from a mage in the Dalelands; the war had caused so much damage to reality's own fabric that the idea was the elves had to "prove themselves" by uniting in understanding and empathy.

That night we depart - not friends, really, but at least with an understanding - the Captain leading us out to the city's edge and his own oath-bound limit; the strange "parting" of the forest makes it easy to reach the end of the fey path, and about an hour after that, we're in Elven Court again. Rather than disturb anyone here this late, we just head straight to the platform to process things and sleep.



## Day 48 - Elven Court
### 8am

We're up and about, making enquiries about whether the Coronal is here or seeing the Tal'quessir. She's here, we're told, so we let an aide know that we're back from Myth Drannor. Around 10:30am, we're called for and led back to the main tree. Her and her Counsel are seated back in the room where we first met her.

* We explain about the disconnect between the nation and Elven Court
* She is amazed to hear that the Akah'velahr still exist
* More details are requested
* The short version is that *she* must lead the elves back there

"She who returns, marches under the light of the Seldarine with her children one last time" says one advisor. "It would appear that all parts of the prophecy have come true" says another.

Riglan mentions how it was emotion that connected the dots there. The Coronal flares with energy, orange and bright, saying she is driven by emotion but contains it, as it would consume those around her if it was all truly released (her Fey part).

A deep sadness sweeps across the room - and a pride - when there is the acceptance that being a defender of Myth Drannor means they can all ride out together. They stand. They must ride there. It'll take four days to get everything packed up here; for people to be ready to leave. Then a day to ride - no fey paths. She tells us to meet here at the pool of Selune tonight "and I will explain".

She thinks she'll lead to Myth Drannor, the return to Elven Court to cast Gentle Repose. But she says, "I will not fall here. All the pieces of the prophecy have come together. This is not where I fall. This will not be my last stand."

We don't push that - we'll find out more in the evening.

The counsel breaks to continue preparations. Within hours, we see the whole of Elven Court mobilising. We ask if we can help - we're asked to help rangers complete tasks; shifting the base of operations from here to Myth Drannor. We're asked mostly to help with messaging, so we use our combined magic for whatever forms of messaging we can do, or help each other with more powerful castings. **A small army of animals, magical spells, even a skywrite.**

Anything within the presumed path of Azalin's march - the entire Eastern quadrant of Cormanthor Forest - is told they have 3 days to pack and evacuate. They're told to *not* remain to defend; the capital is moving back to Myth Drannor.

Even though it's very soon - Azalin is maybe 5-6 days away from the coast edge, never mind the Cormanthor forest at the killing fields - there's a belief that "just in case" (and to give it time to set in) the Gentle Repose first mass-casting should happen on the dawn of the 4th day (when everyone is evacuated), an overnight casting that activates at sunrise (that'll be campaign day 51->52) while the Elven nation marches in to Myth Drannor - and we travel out to our coastal rendezvous.

### 8pm

The moon has risen. A bird tells Riglan to travel to the pool. We climb the big tree. The Coronal is there, alone except for something she calls a "moon fox" - Riglan's never seen one before - almost opalescent; fey. She's taken on her Eladrin form of winter, all whites and blues, icy. Matches the moon! There's always theatre with the elves. She encourages to sit and says we apparently interpreted "the early signs".

She shows us visions in the pool. She left Evermeet because of visions - prophecies - thought it was her duty to come back, centuries ago, because it was *her last stand* - they brought an army with them, elves who had thought they'd ascended to Evermeet but instead had to come back to fight one last battle. They had since dispersed but it seems they're all gathering back. The Akah'velahr are an example, as are the Elfguard here. She had thought the battle they came back for - the Netherese empire - *that* was the last stand. The people of Myth Drannor thought that too, which is perhaps feeding their feeling of abandonment. The prophecy said that they fall. But now she recognises that *this*, Azalin Rex, commands the armies of darkness that encircle them. Demons on one side, undead on another. They just misread the prophecy's conditions.

"The arrangement with the remnants sets to the scene - I am to ride to bring the sword of light to the crumbled tower - 'she who returns'." If the Akah'velahr follow her into battle then that is the last stand. All of the returned elves, who have lived here for a few centuries now, are the most powerful of all; they wield the most might; the purest bloodlines. They will march into battle at the siege of Zhentil Keep. **This is their destiny - this is why she was called back.**

Riglan says, "But you call it 'a last stand'".

"That is the prophecy. We must achieve victory for this cause, at all costs. This is what we have been told will ensure the safety and longevity of the Elven nation. This is why I returned. I had merely forgotten! I'm not the ruler of this nation; it was never my destiny to rule. I was here to defend and protect. I am its Coronal - here to ensure its future. This is my purpose. This is why I'm here."

Riglan responds with, "Then promise me one thing. Whatever the prophecy might say about last stands, they are rarely fully accurate in all details, and many things can change. At least have you and your warriors *try* to survive and not merely assume that death is inevitable!"

"Oh, believe me, we will take a thousand for every one of us that falls. You have never seen the might of the Miritary. You have never seen the full glory of Miritaryi riding into battle under the banner of the Seldarine. We weird the power of the gods themselves. Stories will be told and songs sung for millennia to come of this battle. But this is what the threads of fate determined long, long before the stars were born."

She puts a hand on Riglan's shoulder.

**"Remember. Minnows in a stream."**

Riglan is silent for a moment. His head is down, avoiding eye contact, but his ears show that it's not exactly sadness; it's something else. Eventually he says, "I am surrounded by beauty here. It is rivalled only by Shadowtop Cathedral in the High Forest. But more, I surrounded by this forest's people. It gets more difficult. It probably shouldn't do, but it does. The more you care about a people, the more you get to know them. The more you care about an individual... So it's getting very difficult now."

More and more of the oracle's war vision makes sense. The elves riding with such passion and fury... They ride to a last stand.

More and more of the oracle's war vision comes true. Or at least, certainly looks set to.

When it's all done, he spends time with the party talking everything through, everyone sharing everything they know; then in the end, after all, it's time to sleep.



## Day 49 - Elven Court
### Some time around 2am to 4am - early morning, still fully dark

Riglan wakes up as he often does, in the middle of the night. Usually he gets back to sleep quickly, but this time he notices Nethza sat on the edge of the sleeping platform as if on watch - for a moment Riglan is almost startled, thinking he's missed his watch shift - but he remembers that we weren't doing that here now. He goes over and asks if she'd prefer to be alone or wants company?

"No, look..." - she says, and points. All of Elven Court buzzes with quiet activity; people continue to pack, collect their lives. "This is the most activity I've ever seen here. I didn't realise there were that many elves here. I guess we never saw them." Riglan nods, "Even after all we've done now, we're still only known to a few, and only for a few days; to most, we're outsiders and strangers; and they're quite shy!"

She says, "I've moved a lot in my life; but I never really set down roots anywhere except at Old Owlbear and the school. I was just thinking. What must it be like? To pack your entire life up? To leave your home? I've never really thought about that before. But I've never had a home. But now I do. I have a home and a family. And it's frightening - so much fear - the fear of losing your home, or your family. How do you deal with it? How did *you* leave your home?"

"It was easy for me in a way - I left *because* of the fear, the dreams drove me. Visions of disaster. Once we'd defeated the cults, I found able to travel back through the trees at any time, so since I'd set some roots down elsewhere, like yourself, I found myself between two homes, I suppose. And I could move freely. *Now*, out here, a long way away, I do worry. I think Temo isn ow upset that he frighted Qelline and made her move sooner than she needed to, but after all we've seen with Azalin's 'minions', popping up all over place, for all we know they might've have visited Deepgarden Keep so having her leave was probably the right thing to do after all."

Since he carries most of what he physically owns split between his own bags and the bag of holding, Riglan's more frightened of losing family than a physical domain (forests in general notwithstanding). Nethza asks, "But how do you fight that fear? That fear of losing the only thing that matters to us? Azalin will use that. I know it."

"Oh yes", Riglan agrees, "no doubt..." - and we get into the philosophy of it. Much hinges on head-vs-heart; if a hypothetical situation arose where it was "rescue friends but Azalin escapes" or vice versa - and assuming no further chances for those rescued friends to defeat Azalin, a kind of "last stand" of our own - then of course head says "defeat Azalin". But faced with the emotion of that reality, *would* we? We've fallen to magical tests of our wisdom before, too, and Azalin surely wouldn't hold back on using such tricks to try and sway our decision, especially if he felt genuinely threatened.

We're being quiet but we wake up Maireagh and in turn Temo. Maireagh makes sleep-tea to calm nerves, and we continue to quietly chat. There are no solid answers. Temo fights at distance and hopes to avoid being taken down thus, but otherwise tries to have a playbook in mind and stick to it; Maireagh fights in front, trying to protect and calculate and adapt a plan with each changing variable during the course of a battle, constantly altering her tactics.

If Azalin knows about our weaknesses, we need to find ways to learn about his. Personality defects, magical weaknesses, physical vulnerabilities... Fight fire with fire.

We go back to sleep.

### 8am

We start asking questions. People are busy and starting to leave, but perhaps we can find elves who were at the last battle at Zhentil Keep when Azalin was defeated. Temo starts investigating. 25 (nat 5, RT). There's no library or similar for anything this recent - it's all very old history - and no central repository of names from that recent conflict, so we have to just ask around. By starting at the Elfguard we get some names and go from there.

Riglan tries to persuade people to talk - 10-1 -> 9! No good. Captains of the Elfguard, but they don't want to talk about it... Trauma? Perhaps individual soldiers? Temo investigates - 25 (nat 4, RT) - he finds a few. There was an eleven knight who left the Elfguard after the conflict. She's now with the Rangers - her name is **Silverra**. Temo, history 5+12->17; he is sure that he remembers the mother in the pair of elves we rescued say that name. We head to see if they are still here and, fortunately, the mother is (the daughter is on ranger duties). As tactfully as we can - in view of recent trauma! - we ask about Silverra. A close childhood friend apparently, now retired from Rangers. She offers to take us to her - yes, thanks!

Silverra is an older elf, 700 years or more, and Riglan tries his best but even with advantage - 6,8 - 1! - ugh, only 7. He does not get far (to say the least). Very painful memories, evidently; he's touched a nerve; she kinda shuts down. Temo is listening in and, like Riglan, realises that it's very painful to talk about that time. A protection instinct. He says to Riglan, "Her anguish will only be replicated in many others unless we are able to learn from the previous battle" and Riglan says, "I know! But I don't know how to ask such a thing in a way that isn't just hurtful." Temo thinks for a minute - history, 19 - he suggests to Riglan that maybe she would find it easier if everyone else wasn't there. A smaller audience. Talk about it in a way that helps *her*. Riglan, insight 18; looking around the room, he sees lots of small stuffed animals and drawings of a rabbit in many pictures. That's a significant animal. Temo comes up with the rather odd idea of everyone leaving and Riglan becoming a rabbit!

Riglan suggests to her in a more abstract way - he can turn into a form that won't speak. Persuasion this time nat 20 - 1 plus Maireagh flash-of-genius (to turn into *that* specific rabbit) +5 -> 24. Everyone else leaves; Riglan turns into her companion rabbit - hoping this isn't even more trauma! - and waits.

After a while, she starts talking. At first it's more abstract, talking to the rabbit is if it really was her prior companion. She talks about the last few years; then back; and backwards further until before being a ranger; why she stopped; what she saw, what she was shown back in those difficult times.

* One thing Azalin did was *literally* get into people's heads. Show them visions. Tempt them *while they slept* (meditating, for elves) - while alone.

* Mind's eye trickery. On the battlefield - illusions of sounds, dissonant whispers, to put people off-balance, distract them, doubt and question each other. Spread paranoia - who has been turned? Even if you resist, you're wondering who else might've given in?

* You stop trusting your own senses as he can mess with them.

"Although we did defeat him, I think many of us lost that day. I'm not the only one who left the Elfguard because I could never trust myself again. I wanted to be alone because I didn't want to resist hurting anyone. I had terrible visions back then, even after the battle, of murdering people and then coming to and realising that's what I could really have done. So I travelled the forest alone, just with you" (the rabbit) "as a companion".

She continues, "This is what people don't talk about. He has this power over you... This lingering power. It stays with you." She confesses that she woke up one night after the battle in the middle of the forest, sword drawn with blood on it - and she still doesn't know what she did. "I didn't kill anyone, because nobody had died; but what did I do? And why do I not remember it? And if it happened to me, how many others did it happen to? Did I actually do anything at all or was it just an illusion? I just don't know. I can't trust myself."

* On the battlefield, Azalin wields the power of death. The Elfguard didn't know how to deal with it then (but those who stayed in the Elfguard do now).

* Anyone you killed didn't really matter to him; they weren't even really his own troops originally! But if any of *us* died, unless a Soulcatcher is used and in effect, then every death is a sort of infection - becomes part of his army.

* So our side couldn't take risks, while his side could fight with a fury that we couldn't match. We couldn't risk dying!

* The Coronal should know this now - they should bring in Soulcatchers to stop people being brought back. But that in itself is terrifying; elves are promised a place in the fey amongst the Seldarine after death, but a Soulcatcher stops that.

**(Quietly, Riglan thinks it's much worse that - the implications are that Azalin *requires a soul* to capture to resurrect and control. So it's just an empty shell - it's far, far worse - their souls are imprisoned).**

The elven spirit knights - at Myth Drannor - have the same issue. If they fall in battle, it's true death. This is particularly bad for a race that is "supposed" to be technically immortal.

"How do you fight an enemy who knows all your weaknesses and can hit you where it hurts most?"

Silverra felt she wasn't strong enough to fight anything like that anything again; and she left - as did many others.

"And you want to know the worst thing? The rumours - we heard rumours that he didn't die - that all of these lost elven lives were lost in vain for nothing - absolutely nothing! So why are we riding into battle again? He can't be killed. He can't be defeated. What are we doing? This is just fulfilling destiny. The destiny of the end of the elves. The prophecy of our fall."

Eventually she quietens. She picks up Riglan-rabbit, takes him outside and puts him down on the grass; then goes indoors. Riglan lops off a while to maintain the rabbit illusion until a distance away then turns into himself, catches up with his party and explains.

* Anyone who engages Azalin in battle risks lifelong influence and mental scars - ourselves included.

* The raised dead are not just empty shells, but captured souls (later, the mages at Elven Court explain that this is worse - they're not just zombies and skeletons, but undead manifesting the full powers they had when they were alive; spell casters remain spell casters).

* We should at least confide in the Coronal the plan for the Shadowfell.

We catch up with the Coronal to explain. She'd been thinking that killing Azalin would delay him a few hundred years while reforming - we point out that he *mustn't* be killed, must taken very low, so that we can cast the spell and push him back to the Shadowfell. She asks about the Dark Powers; did they mention the elves? No... Interesting; the elves are the one with the best ability to make a soul-catching mythil, which would catch *all* souls, including his. So if he *did* get killed, *but* the Soulcatcher was up, then he couldn't escape to the phylactory - as long as the spell is up. But it does need to be *held* as it's not a "true" mythil which holds itself indefinitely. We don't know if he can be pushed to the Shadowfell as a soul.

Maybe we need to try and find more about his phylactory... The Coronal says there's too much being left to chance. We must contact "our benefactors" (the Dark Powers) if we can, and ask them!

We head to the privacy of the sleeping platform and talk. Raven Queen or divination? It was a form of divination that got to the Dark Powers directly last time. It was Aneera's spell. Riglan, arcana, Nat 20 + 0, tries to figure out how to adapt his divination to get similar results based on what he saw. The spell needs channelling - boosting; he asks the priests for use of the Pool of Silune. They agree but insist they must be present. OK!

Interestingly, as the priests set up and help as a ritual, they don't need incense. Riglan will cast and they'll direct magic to the pool. They show Riglan how to ask his question via the pool. It takes a few minutes to set up and then it's ready.

The question is: "The elves need to use a Soulcatcher during the battle with Azalin - will this interfere with the spell you gave us, to send him back to the Shadowfell?

In the reflection of the pool, the strange, giant, shifting images of the Dark Powers appear; this then shifts to a vision; insight 17; the vision suggests that that the Soulcatcher won't be an issue - it indicates that the spell we have should be used *before* he dies. It should be very, very difficult to do that anyway. If by chance he *was* killed, the Soulcatcher would not stop the spell sending that soul to the Shadowfell.

At the very tail end, as the main vision fades back to the Dark Powers in their strange chamber, Maireagh points something out (flash of genius -> equiv 22 insight) he notices the room in which the Dark Powers stand contains a mirror in the back of the room where a window would be. In that mirror plays another vision, almost hidden, easy to miss; the vision suggests that the Dark Powers have **insurance policies in place**. We are not the only people set upon this task. There are others who are also playing their part, including those who are trying to find and deliver the phylactory. The implication is that as long as that phylactory is in this plane, **he can always find a way to influence this plane no matter where he's placed in the Shadowfell**. They know that it's not pieces of shattered soul ("Horcrux") but that has been discounted. He does have more than one phylactory, somehow.

(Should the phlactory be found and moved to the Shadowfell, then he'd be pulled there on death anyway, Soulcatcher or not. But if below 50hp equivalent, our spell will work. The vision finishes here... But shows that as long as any of his army is up, he can drain life from any minions to stay up himself. The army would need to be completely gone for him to be at risk. And the strike needs to be fast; if under threat, he'll use magical escape. He'll only fight if he's sure he has the upper hand.

**We have to find a way to almost beat him without him realising he's almost beaten**.

It's a relief for Nethza - all of us, in a way - to find that we're not alone. We only have one piece of the puzzle - we're not expected to hold all of them. That said, we understand even more now about the battle with Azalin and how difficult it will be. As for how changed we are personally afterwards - well, that's just a cost. We can't worry about it now.

It's late afternoon. The sages say that'll pass on all we've learned to the Coronal.

The elves have the closing-the-portals covered. They're packed up, we have nothing more to offer. An arrangement is made that they'll muster secretly in the forest, then "ride the wind" to meet up with us *in battle* at Zhentil to avoid the situation last time, where the army marched as one and Azalin attacked it with a Dracolich. We'l probably be with the Cormyr army by then ourselves.

They show us fey paths to the Eastern edge of the forest. The implication is that it's our time to leave. "You have your own destiny!" they say. Riglan finds time to track down the busy Coronal Ilsevele and thank her in person. (He has a bit of a "thing" for her on the DL but she's an elf and he knows there's nothing more there). And that's that; we'll have to make our way to our rendez-vous with Isteval and Lesther. We'll be probably be early but it gives us a chance to scout out the landscape north of the river and paths Azalin might take. With that in mind, the Elves show us a fey path that exits north of the bridge - on the direct path he'll probably use.

### 5pm

Riglan doesn't want to risk dwelling on the emotions here. We say our goodbyes and head for the fey path. The Coronal herself comes to show us the way! "There is an old fey path that not many know that well." So, a slightly different one...? But she gives us each a small flower charm. "I need you to eat this, because it will protect the path that leads here" - basically, we'll forget it. "That's the only thing it will affect!" So, we each eat our flower. As we're about to step in, she grabs Riglan's hand and says, quickly, "I know you worry about the seed you carry. I know your heart is weighed down by the responsibility. But know that the World Tree is wise, compassionate and is the embodiment of life. It is always finds a way. And you, I must believe, are the best guardian because it has chosen you. Trust in the seed."

Riglan nods, says, "The world tree isn't the only thing with those qualities...", then turns and heads down the path.

As the Coronal lets go of his hand, he steps into the path. He looks back to see the Coronal waving as the foliage actually closes in behind him, then realises he's holding a small silver pendant on a chain - the Coronal had put it in his palm. He doesn't know what it does, but puts it on straight away.

Turning back to the path, Riglan sees Temo had stopped and looked back too. He's giving Riglan a quizzical look. Riglan deception 8, Temo insight Nat 20+1. Temo realises immediately that Riglan has confused feelings about the Coronal! He calls back quietly, "Whatever it is, I'm sure it's worth wearing. Even if it's just a piece of metal" then turns can carries on walking. Riglan hurries to catch up.

We follow the path for only about half a hour. This one is more dark than many others. Lots of curved overhead branches and bushes, but with butterflies and dragonflies. Soon, the path gets marshy and we find ourselves hopping between unusually strong and weight-bearing lily pads. At the exit, there is a strange arch of flowers. We wander for a while then have a kind of waking-up feeling, as if out of a dream. Riglan immediately realises he knows where he is, but not how he got here, but *does* remember being given the flower and isn't freaked out. He says, "We should be on the very edge of the forest..." - and indeed the biggest trees seem to be behind. There's a hill ahead and trees thin further as we climb. It's about 600ft, with one big dominating tree on the top. From the top, we get a good view of the are around.

Falling down towards the south, east and west there is no forest now. Towards the south is a road. Riglan points; "That must lead to the bridge". It's quite dark now, so he can't see it, but *thinks* there might be some lights. Perhaps even a ribbon-like reflection of the moon what must be the river it crosses, unless his eyes are tricking him (and the perception roll is only 12, so that's very possible!). The road, as we look South, heads to the right of the hill; we think Azalin would probably bear to the left or over it, and upwards, almost directly North, to get to Elven Court - if indeed he is heading that way.

### 9pm

We get to the road and follow South, hoping to reach the bridge before tiredness forces us to camp. It takes 2 hours, the only reason we push on so long being the view of them approaching. There's actually a small settlement! A handful of buildings, a tower, stables, inn and supply shop.

### 11pm

The bridge is *huge*, some 20 feet wide. Once, this must have been a major thoroughfare. Guard posts and a small, fortified position on the far side (to the South). This is where the road splits, one side signed to "Scardale, Harrowdale", the other just saying "Sembia" (the South road). No sign for the Northern branch up into Cormanthor proper.

Beeline for the inn!

As we get closer, we see clearly how the bridge arches up, over the quite-wide river at this point. Its banks are fairly gentle; maybe only a 10ft drop. Azalin wouldn't necessarily need to use the bridge itself (though he might as well). The arch lifts up some 15ft, which seems surprising given the relatively low height at the banks; maybe there are ships, or the river floods, or maybe that's just the only way they found to build it strong enough to take the traffic weight that a 20ft width implies. In turn, this means the guard tower has to be quite tall - 30ft.

The Inn is **Ashaba's Crossing** and we head inside. The main door enters into what's actually a tavern, most people gone probably due to the late hour but one or two still around on candlelit tables. They turn as we enter. The bartender nods. "Drink, or a room?" and Riglan says, "A room certainly, and a drink if there's still time?" "No problem! I can sort you out a drink. But you'll want to see **Johm** about a room!" - then calls Johm's name. A head pops out from what we can see beyond is a kitchen's door. He assumes - since we say we're headed to Sembia, when asked - that we're from Scardale and "a fey path out of Cormanthor" would probably not be believed. So we go with that! There's a big room that four of us will fit in. 12sp; we're asked if we want breakfast; 16sp all in. "Tea from 7, cooked breakfast maybe ten minutes after that. Come, I'll show you your room!" - and he heads towards the stairs.

We're up just one flight of stairs. Apparently the room might be a bit noisy as it is next to the stairwell - "sleep with your heads by the windows and you won't notice a thing!"

We drop off anything not valuable and head back down, to find four mugs of ale already at the bar. "I took a risk!" says the bartender and Riglan smiles, picks up a tankard and says, "thank you, good risk". Nethza asks for the cost; 8cp; Nethza pays 1sp - includes a tip!

We haven't had any food all day; the kitchen we know is closed and check that it's OK to eat our own. No issues. He even brings out four plates, and a bit of leftover bread and cheese. We tap into rations - Riglan didn't get any foraging time in the forest, sadly. We mix regular and desert rations. It's not bad!

Two people leave; just "regular humans". At the bar, well into his drink, someone in uniform. Temo risks asking, "Are you part of the new Sembian patrols?" (persuasion 31), and the guy initially gets surprised - "Are they replacing us?!" - but calms him down finds out that this guy is one of 6 Sembian guardspeople stationed at the guard post long term, keeping an eye on the border. He is 3mo into his posting, not expecting anyone else for another 3mo. We learn that they run shifts 2 at a time for 8 hours ("well, *one* at a time right now, **Mart**...!" says the barman - we learn that this guy is on duty!).

We finish up the rations and head back to the room before it's "closing time". As soon as the door shuts Temo says, "OK, so *how* are we going to evacuate all these people?! I didn't know there was anyone here, I thought it was just a bridge. And *where* would they go?" "South?" "Well, Ordulin?" - much to consider.

Temo sets up Alarm and we sleep. We set up watches as usual.

* Maireagh 19+mod
* Nethza 18+mod
* Temo 17 total (hears people on the stairs)
* Riglan 18 total (hears people waking up and moving around at 6am)



## Day 50
### 7:30am

We get up and pack, then head down for breakfast - already paid for. It feels like everyone clears out! One night stays. Over breakfast in idle chat we learn that Scardale isn't part of Sembia - this outpost really is their border - it's a Eastermost part of the Dalelands.

Temo quietly uses the Sending Stone for the Speaker's Assistant. "Four days or less until Azalin emerges. We are at Ashara's Crossing. Quite a few people here. Recommend evacuation." A message back - "Oh. Hold on. I'll check on that for you. I was so sure that was covered!" - a few moments later - "Update! Forces have all gathered, headed up towards Ordulin presently." Then a few minutes after, "Rider has been dispatched apparently, should arrive any day yet - surprised not there - I wouldn't worry yet! How long are you there for?" "We probably need to leave today, but *could* delay one day if useful?" "If it's no trouble... Keep an eye out! Let me know if there are any issues by the end of the day."

Later the barman is making idle chat and asking a lot of questions about where we come from and why we're here. We don't want to lie and end up talking about an approaching army. He becomes very concerned but not quite about what we were worried with and, despite our attempts to be reassuring, we can't really understand what specifically is bothering him about the news. His responses are a bit obtuse, though unintentionally. He keeps saying that he needs to speak to Johm.

Later, they're tidying up, Johm pops his head around and confirms that we're having the same room for another room. He tells us about various places to go and even a spot under the bridge where there are drawings!

As we're starting to head out, we see a guard running towards the inn. He's come from the general store. The person there is standing outside looking distressed and starting to pack up. We hail the guard and stand back; the guard ignores us and just runs past, apologising, "Urgent business!", then runs into the bar. "Vip! Viptor! Jom! Where are you?" - he runs upstairs and finds them; perception 23; Riglan overhears "...evacuation notice! We've been pulled out, but order of Ordulin! The guards all have to leave!" "What? When?!" "Immediately! But you really shouldn't stay here... It's not safe..." "But travellers! We need to stay open. Where will they stay?!" "Don't be ridiculous! Just close. You don't have a responsibility to do that. I'll swing by and check on you later, I need to go, we have to pack everything up at the tower - you shouldn't stay - there's no reason to..." then runs down the stairs and out.

Temo heads back upstairs to where Vip and Johm are. Temo looks up and says "I'm sorry, that was rather more blunt and sooner than I expected..." - they were in the middle of changing bedsheets, sort of frozen. Temo says, "Look, it's safe for a few days, but the sooner you get on the road south, the safer." They're both very distressed; they aren't Sembians, they can't live there; we start helping with cleaning up; Johm goes downstairs and tips out two tins on the floor. "We could survive for ten days I'd say. We'd need to buy a horse or two..." - and starts diving up money. They think they'll have to head to Scardale.

(Concurrently with above)

* Maireagh and Nethza start pitching in cleaning the rooms just so that's all done quickly.
* Riglan starts asking for information about the settlements on the road to Scardale and size of Scardale itself; 2 days walk away; two settlements in between - Riglan says that the more they can tell him the better; information is valuable; we always pay for good information - he's using this as an excuse to help them out with money without it seeming like charity.
* Temo is asking on the Stone - "We have people here who are not Sembian, and as a representative of the Lord's Alliance, I'd like to formally request that they be temporarily granted safe harbour within Sembian borders until they can return home to the bridge." The reply is swift; "That will not be a problem; Sembia is open to visitors, not a problem at all. What appears to be the problem?" Temo answers, "Stand by on that. We also aren't sure if Scardale is aware to keep people indoors and off roads where possible?" "No, but I understand that a delegation has been sent to explain the situation - that Sembia's borders will close".

A knock at the door. Someone called **Jenny** - more concern about evacuation. "We're going to head South, what are you going to do?" She's trying to give them something - probably money, but they refuse, saying, "he's old and sick, he'll need it" - and Temo then clears his throat and says, "Sorry to interrupt but Johm, might I have a quick word just outside please?" "Uuuh - sure?" and they head just outside the room. Temo learns that in their younger days, they were "activists" - political things - not welcome in Sembia... They used to lead protests. He thinks they'd be taken in as political prisoners. Temo could probably work around that but he's so adamant, they clearly don't want to go there. Instead, they prefer Scardale. That sounds like Ground Zero for Azalin, but if that's what they want... Temo pops his head around the door and calls, "Riglan. Wind walk. How many people?" Riglan things for a moment, say, "I *think* maybe as many as... Ten? Ten tops, less is easier."

They do have a plan by now. They've got enough money for a couple of horses, take all the food here, lock everything up and hit the road, but have this strange sense of civic duty and want to stay here as long as possible. They bought the place off the previous owner at almost an inheritance - near-cost - price; it was someone related to their political cause of old. They promised them on their deathbed that they'd stay open as a beacon in the night until "against all oppression". They must stay open for as long as they can.

Temo tries to persuade them to leave sooner. There's no reason to keep open. It's a promise; a morality. Temo tries to use the angle that if the leave tomorrow morning (when we go), they can be on the road and - if they find any straggling travellers - persuade them to turn back and move as group. Persuasion 25.

Johm gives Vip 80 gold out of what they have, telling him to hurry to the stables to get two draft horses before everything goes. Riglan gives Johm as Vip leaves 40gp and says, "That's payment for the room in view of the evacuation order; and for the information on Scardale and the settlements in between." He's conflicted. Temo says, "Consider this a donation for the cause, not for the person." Johm is uncomfortable, but accepts at that. "But I must tell you the cause, then!" Temo laughs. "Please do!"

"The cause is an academic one. All histories should be studied and all points of view considered in the universities. That is our belief. That is not the case in Sembia - there are philosophies that are banned." "Such as?" asks Temo. "Well... To do with who are progenitors are; the source of knowledge, the role of the elves, the gifts of beings from other worlds, the fluid nature of good and evil. All of these philosophies are banned from study." Temo looks to Riglan and says, "In view of our friendship with Renwick it would seem hypocritical to do anything other than agree!"

What got *them* into trouble, it transpires, was presenting a very good case about how the merchant class controls the council!

So, they accept the "donation"; we'll all leave tomorrow morning.

(Temo messages the Speaker's Assistant to explain).

Later that day, Temo receives a magical Message from Cormyr. "Purple Dragon Knights - we have encountered an order of yours from Samilar. We ride north. They send their regards. See you on the field of glory!" - he's happy to relay that message to the party!

Vip manages to secure his horses, although he had to argue his way over the bridge apparently and only just got to the stables in time.

We head out to get a feel for the physical lie of the land under the bridge, in case it is relevant. The river is about 70ft wide here. The banks are indeed quite gentle; Azalin's forces can certainly fit *over* the bridge, but might well also decide to *around* and under it, at least here. This area is a kind of natural ford. Further downstream it gets a lot steeper, cutting a canyon. Looks like maybe rapids or waterfalls - OK, so, no boats. It gets steeper again upstream but not as dramatic; still, hard to walk down and back up the banks. At most there's a half-mile spread where he army might spill over.

We see the drawings we were told about! Etchings/carvings and actual drawings, often covered now with lichen, some newer. Lovers write messages under the bridge. Stuck into crevasses here and there are uncollected ratty bits of parchment, once love-letters. We clamber back up and cross over to at least have a quick look at the southern settlement.

As we approach we see a huge barrier has been lowered across the bridge. A kind of pole. A sign, "NO ENTRY TO SEMBIA" in Common, then "Border Closed" underneath. There are quite a few more buildings here and it's being evacuated rather actively - this is very Sembian territory. That's why Vip had to do some fast talking to get across. We talk our way in too, to grab some extra rations including fresh fish (which we'll give to the inn owners to cook and we can talk leftovers on the road).

It's really weird. By mid-afternoon, south of the bridge is a ghost-town. Fully closed up. Locked doors, barricaded windows. We cross over to the Dalelands territory and actually, it's not too different here either. Just the inn left open - even the tower is evacuated.

Temo heads inside, finds the two; says, "Well, looks like everyone else has gone - but you're not alone." The two are reassuring each other. Temo says, "How long have you two been together?" "Since we were students, really" says Johm. "Well since *I* was a student!" interrupts the younger Vip. Temo gives them some good-natured jibes about student and teacher!

Temo talks about how Netherese info is withheld in the West. Johm and Vip light up. A bottle is opened. The conversation flows.

Since the two of them insist that information should be open, Temo eventually reveals the true nature of this army. Azalin. "I knew it!" says Johm. They'd heard lots of traveller's tales the last few months and it sounded like things they'd read. It transpires - Johm has a stash of forbidden books! He fetches them. **A goldmine**. Stories from war. Banned texts from clerics who *follow* Azalin. "Having these books is not the same as believing them, but that is something the authorities simply cannot grasp."

With Johm's help, Temo adv investigation 17+15 -> 32 (!) and finds some very interesting stuff! Things that just stop short of pretty much explaining exactly how Azalin has managed to keep some form of influence in this plane; how he communicates with his followers. 

* Agents - blood cults - pagan-style; sacrifices, rituals and so-on. They find ways to communicate; portents, reading entrails, sacrifices must be "pure of heart" and so-on.
* Cryptic communication in that case but, the books claim, communication all the same. Some books include examples and guesses at meaning.
* The whole thing is run by vampires; effectively high priests of this blood cult, present in the nations of the Sea Of Fallen Stars the whole time.
* **Ruled from Thesk** - the heart of the cults lies there. That's Azalin's old seat of power.
* The Zhentarim contain a splinter mercenary arm of Azalin's - their network can be used to spread messages around and be used as a good source of human trafficking for sacrifice.

There are "crossing the barrier" events. Stars and moons aligning; crafting conduits to pierce the veil of the Shadowfell. We take careful notes on that to pass onto the Dark Powers for future security! Riglan asks if there's anything in there about the dreamwalking stuff? Well, that's what the alignment means. Dreams and nightmares can cross the realms under the right conditions.

A lot of stuff about the most innocent and pure of heart. "Untainted virgin fear". It's grim reading.

We note that "fear is his greatest weapon" a lot. Courage, truth, hope; those are things that have power against the cult. "We must extinguish hope where we see it" / "We must corrupt the truth and shroud things in darkness and uncertainty". Riglan quips, "We're going to need an army of paladins!"

True Sight, Hope, Courage, those kinds of things... If we can fortify ourselves and not give into doubt and fear, then he has much less power over you.

"Maybe this was not a chance encounter after all" says Vip. This is why the draft horses were needed - they won't leave these books behind; some might be the only copies; they won't leave them here. Too dangerous. They've got lined, protected chests. They won't ride the horses - the horses will have more than enough to carry.

They explain that the inn is a safe haven for some of the 'dissidents', the only place this sort of thing can be safely discussed. That's why they had to move *just* into the Dalelands, which doesn't have Sembia's restrictions and regulations.

### 8pm

We've made dinner - fish cooked! We eat. Packing is completed. We decide to get an early night for an early start. We help with final pack-down of rooms. Shutter and bar windows, that kind of thing.

By about 10pm we're in bed. Vip and Johm say they hardly ever have anyone arrive after 8 - we were a rare exception.
