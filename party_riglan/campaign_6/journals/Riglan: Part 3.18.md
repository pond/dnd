# Riglan: Part 3.18
## Day 51 - Leaving Ashara's Crossing
### 6:30am

We're awake. Packing sounds. We exit the room; "No not breakfast today!" but he has cold cuts of ham, cheese, salad and so-on. It's great. Four big chests of books! Temo gives them a potion of healing - just in case. They'll head out; we're going to fly! Sort of.

We wish them well, stand back, and Riglan casts Wind Walk. It's about 65 miles to Scardale. We follow the road. Riglan doesn't fly at a full 300, but keeps an eye on the river and road. Steep cliffs, canyons, waterfalls. Looks like a scar in the land - Scardale's name seems suddenly somewhat unimaginative! We know there are two settlements along the way. They're both small hamlets, one a little bigger - perhaps a service hub for some nearby farmlands. We notice one group of three on horseback headed West. They'll encounter our friends headed East; they'll have to take their chances. At least the settlements in both cases are set back a fair way from the cliffs.

There's a point we reach where the Southern side starts to get lower and stays lower, as if consistently undercut by waves in the river, with bigger cliffs on the taller North bank. If Azalin does come out to the South he'll surely have to keep on this side, cross-country, no road, and get to the bridge.

Even at 1/2 to 2/3 speed, we reach Scardale in only about 3 hours. The city seems to spill over a cliff down to a port. Towards the South we think we can see where the army should emerge; a natural beach, gentle slopes, lots of paths heading up to the southern river bank, as the river tumbles out into the ocean. It's not a delta.

We definitely don't want any other spectators on the northern bank - Azalin would have them throwing themselves off cliffs in no time. We'd be 30-40ft above the port there.

The beach is some 200ft wide. The river some 80ft wide. We think our "convincing illusion" sweet-spot is around 120ft from the edge of his forces, so that they don't see through the illusion and try to see where we *really* are, trying to draw them in a particular direction. If we were on the north bank, trying to keep him away from Sembia, he'd not detect any life force.

So, we have to be on the beach... Pulling him along, somehow, on the highlands, to lure him along the river's edge and hope he stays there. There are sand dunes and sandbanks that could do the trick and we'll need an exit strategy to get everyone safely away once we've got his army going where we want it to go.

Riglan spots an off-the-road corner near Scardale where we can touch down and come out of cloud form, near the woods. It gives us the cover we need for a minute or two; then we head on foot directly to Scardale. The woods here are not ancient; they're relatively recently regrown.

### Roughly 10:30am - Scardale

The town overlooks the river plunging down into the harbour, in a series of small rapids. The bedrock it has carved yields to no delta. It would be very difficult to walk up it - seeing the geography increases our confidence in our predictions for where and how Azalin will emerge (unless we're totally, wildly off the mark with the coastal area overall).

There are low city walls, maybe 20ft high. Old stone; protection against, say, wild animals, but not against sieges. The city gates are open; a couple of guards are there but don't seem to be paying much attention! We walk straight through.

"City walls" should perhaps say "town walls", as it's not that big, but built onto - or in part into - the steep hill that climbs down in terraces to the harbour. There's a beautiful cathedral, with a single soaring spire of some 70-80ft high and a stained glass rose window on the front and back of the main spire tower as far as we can tell - light shining through both, as seen our position. It's built from what looks like a blueish limestone. A square in front. It's the most significant building here. Buildings generally seem to face out to the sea.

We figure maybe Sir Isteval and Lesther might head to the square and look for an inn off there. But Temo (investigation via RT 25) has other ideas and dives into a nearby shop, to ask the shopkeeper for the "best inn in town". We're directed to the **Crested Grebe**, in a middle terrace. Temo learns, as the shopkeeper talks about the finely-crafted metal writing implements he sells, that it's made from ore mined nearby; Scardale's original wealth comes from this. Temo buys a sort-of-souvenir pen for 2gp. Other souvenir items indicate both the cathedral and the "**House Of Learning**".

Steps lead down from the terrace we're on to the next one down. A series of waterfalls - fountains, of a sort - are set into the wall. One has a plaque that talks about Elminster who used to sit at a bench there (!) - full tourism for Scardale! There's a fair bit of civic art too, often made of the same material as the pen - a bronze, or perhaps brass metal, from the local mines.

A market square with a central fountain sits in the middle terrace. A circular road surrounds the area and, to the edge, is an ornately-painted (Tudor-style) building - yellow, blue, green and pink painted slats; flower paintings on the shutters, three storeys, pitched roof. Planters hang at every window with small flowers planted within. The front door is flanked by two potted poplars (Riglan's not sure he approves of the pots!) - we head in.

A wooden entranceway has a chandelier above, stairs leading up and away to both left and right and a front desk positioned below, in between. A small side table holds a flower arrangement; various paintings of people hang on the wall; there's a big mirror behind the desk. Two people stand there in uniform. Temo asks if a Sir Isteval of Cormyr "plus one" has checked in; no, not yet. Temo excuses himself, finds a quiet corner and uses L3 Sending - "We are now at Scardale and will be staying at the Crested Grebe". The response indicates that the two were delayed with some "slight trouble" but expect to arrive tomorrow; "Save us a room please!".

Temo thus asks for two rooms - one for the four of us (or whatever will fit us in), and one for the two more to follow. They're able to accommodate us with the smaller room nearby, but not available until tomorrow (that's fine). We request 3 nights to start with. There's a "junior suite" and a "superior room" for the "knight and his squire". It's 5+2gp per night, which they round down to 20gp for the night. We don't have Dale Currency - their preference - but they'll go via weight, so we do that.

Breakfast is at 7am, the bar opens at 11am (!)... We're on the third floor. We head up, following our guide from reception; we're shown our rooms. Temo persuades that if anyone *other* than Sir Isteval (or someone calling themselves that) asks after us or them, then we're not here! "We like our privacy", says Temo.

It's a good room, two separate rooms, one big and one small - Riglan negotiates for the big bed! - and Temo assesses security, checking out of the windows for balconies, handholds and so-on. It would be quite easy to climb up the balconies from the ground floor; he'll need to pay particular attention to that window if setting up Alarm.

We decide to go back out and find out more about the town - the people and its history and, of course, whether or not there's been any news of possible evacuation here. Temo persuasion 30, asking generally if any of the news from the surrounding area has reached here.

* Yes, news has; people are quite rattled - disturbing stories from all around the land; sailors, trappers, travellers, woodsmen and even some outlying farms.

* They're well connected to those people because this is the only port in the Dalelands and it's a deep harbour so large ships can come in.

* No evacuation orders or anything like that gets mentioned.

Riglan perception is only 12! So he doesn't notice too much visually but we get a lot out of conversations thanks to Temo. Housing seems to be kept to the edges, with the 'functional' parts of the city closer to the central road. Smithies are closer to the port; storage and distribution centres on the final terrace before a whole set of lifts, pulleys and ramps that are used to pull up cargo from the docks (where there are a few more warehouses).

There are taverns, cheaper inns... A few hovels - flophouses and so-on - especially lower down. A familiar story; expensive stuff above and the lower cost stuff below. This feels much more like the Sword Coast - and indeed, the Dalelands is not a true nation like Sembia or Cormyr, with independent towns. It's a bit strange given how it's sandwiched between the Sembia and Cormanthor, but this does make it a kind of narrow, awkward strip of land next to an ancient powerful nation in Cormanthor and a wealthy young nation in Sembia. Perhaps Dalelands towns historically wanted to retain independence while others might've been absorbed into a growing Sembia? We're also at the very edge, we need to remember - the port town.

The only heraldry we see is that of Scardale; there's nothing that seems to represent the "Dalelands". Again - similar to the Sword Coast.

At all this, the penny drops; even if they wanted to evacuate, they probably couldn't. Unlike Sembia, this is the *only* port for the Dalelands, and busy. Constant visitors passing through. It'd be almost impossible to lock it down in any meaningful way.

Perhaps there's some way we can plan some kind of big distraction, something to keep people away from the river edge / clifftop? Anything we can do to keep spectators away. At least the town *itself* doesn't go to the edge, it's more about pulling people in the smaller houses that spill beyond the walls. Then again, maybe they'll have to tale their chances - we can only be in so many places at once.

We go to the House Of Learning, purely on a whim.

It's a large building with a courtyard in the middle which looks like it used to be an old monastery. Now it's full of books, scholars, sages and more. A college of magic of sorts - an open university, for magic. Given the area's history (Elminster) this makes a lot of sense. We learn that the calendar system the Sword Coast uses was devised here - **the years were set here. "DR" - Dale Reckoning.**

### 4pm

We happen upon a couple of elves, running a market stall. They sell fine leather armour and bows. Temo strikes a conversation, since they speak Common, basically asking what brings them to the Dalelands rather than Cormanthor? 50-60 years ago they moved, after the war. Looking for a better life. They settled here; they like the variety of Scardale. Always news flowing through. "A window into the world"! Chatting more, they mention **Elvin**, a trader down on the docks, who we should talk to; he's just come from the city of Calaunt, in The Vast, and has many tales! We figure he basically sailed over Azalin's head, so we're sure he does.

We thank them and - no time like the present - we head down into the docks and Temo starts asking around. Investigation 25, takes a while, but we find Elvin down in a tavern by the water. "**The Harpy's Roost**". It's a hanging tavern, built into the rock face of the cliff itself. Hmm, not a favourite place to be with Azalin this close - but - in we go!

A sailor's bar. Stale beer, fried food and unwashed bodies. There is a relaxed, non-threatening, fun vibe though; the place is split into floors. We head to the bar, and ask for Elvin under the pretence of getting food as well. Fried squid, rice, beans; only 8cp. Reminds us of the old days! The barman points out Elvin, but we must wait for the food first (so we get *five* beers too and he rounds the cost to 1sp). The fried calamari comes in a huge bowl, with a big bowl of mixed rice and beans separately and some empty bowls and spoons, handed over on a big tray.

We carry it over to Elvin, who was sat alone at his table but is now joined by someone else, who is leaning over, looking threatening. Temo goes, "Elvin! Friend! Good to see you, here's the food and drink!" (deception) - Elvin catches on fast. "Goodness! Where have you been?! This man here is giving me a spot of bother..." He's trying to tell the other guy that he'll be seen tomorrow. "You'd better get me my shipment! I paid you already! What kind of business are you running anyway?!" argues the other man. But in the end he leaves.

Elvin is a swarthy-looking human. Scars on very dark skin. Shaved head. Temo says, "Our timing was accidentally good! Of course, we haven't met..." and he introduces the four of us. He's eyeing us up - does he owe us money? "You don't owe us anything - a couple of elves in a market stall mentioned your name, that you'd just sailed in from Calaunt and had stories. We're hoping the food and beer pays *you* for stories!"

"You don't need to pay me for stories!"

He talks of being attacked in the harbour; lost half the crew before he cut the ropes and set sail; found various amulets on bodies. He talks of seeing an "ancient evil" in the dreams. One of them was on his First Mate! Threw the First Mate overboard! "He's a mole!" - Riglan uses Detect Magic to see if there are any familiar magical signatures on anything. There's a strong Enchantment magic on the First Mate's amulet; that could be used to control or dominate. "He brought these people on board. Snuck them aboard. These *rotten, rotting* cold corpses, walking corpses! He tried to bring them on *my ship*!"

Apparently, they were just trying to smuggle powerful undead aboard; powerful by the sounds of it; so *not* going under the ocean. Perhaps that's how some of them got to Cormanthor, or even the one we killed in Sembia. Temo assures the Captain that by the sounds of it, he did the right thing.

He lost his ship though - he had to swim to shore. By the time the First Mate's deception was uncovered, the ship was already filled with the undead; the Captain decided to sink the ship to drown them! Most of the crew got out on lifeboats, but he figured he'd "go down with the ship". Swum to shore. Took a day! Sounds like a tall tale; Riglan insight 22, *most* of it is true. Some embellishments at worst. He *did* save the crew and was betrayed. He did scuttle the ship. He's not sure if that was enough. He lost everything on the ship - but hasn't lost *everything*. He's got a backup plan, but the cargo is gone.

Riglan figures the vampires (he mentions) probably couldn't fly over the whole sea in one dark night, so they needed another way. And they can't swim!

We explain briefly what's going on. He thinks, in that case, he'll go to Harrowdale. We ask if he's got any crew from the boats? He goes quiet... Thinks they must be fine... They had a rowboat, but he's not seen them - he hasn't asked because "to be honest I didn't want to know". He feels guilt for the ship. "I can't offer them a home anymore. It's gone." "How much is a new ship?!" "More than I can afford. But I've made my way up from the bottom before... I'll do it again... The sea calls!"

Temo gives him a Potion Of Invisibility. He might find it useful, or know someone who would be able to use it and sell it on; either way, it could be a handy way to get out of town. He's grateful!

Of the vampires, he says, "There was no way I was going to let them spread their evil in my adopted home."

Temo says, "It's the quiet heroes who are the most important of all."

He heads off. But we know a bit more about Azalin's movements now! As he heads out of the door, we see the bartender looking as if to stop him for not paying; he looks to us; we shrug and indicate that we'll pay. Another 8cp (we pay 1sp for the trouble!).

### 5pm

We continue to wander around, taking in the feel and sights of the city. Eventually, the sun sets behind the walls, over the woods; it lights up clouds over the sea and sails of distant ships shine brightly in the orange, then red glow. The port's lights illuminate quite early since it's at the bottom of the hill, in the shadow.

We head back up to the middle tier. Riglan comments on how strange it is that there's all this peril and horror going on but we're seeing all these places and amazing things, from Cormanthor to the Fey paths and the various cities and people. The desert feels like months ago, even though it's only really a couple of weeks, give or take day or two.

Eventually, tired from walking around the town so much, we retreat to the hotel and spend a bit of time at the bar - the hotel starting to get busy, the dining room filling up, the bar getting lively, more people checking in. The staff are busy. Temo strikes up conversation at the bar (persuasion 25 via RT); the bartender does the most talking. Today is actually quiet, relatively. There are some waves of people heading through who seem distressed he says, some headed North, some South, nobody going West though! He doesn't see a pattern. "It's just the fortunes of a port town! The Throne Of Gems" (a gaming hall / casino) "is doing a great trade though."

The general feel, otherwise, is that people are worried, but don't know which direction to go and are just kinda going 'somewhere else'.

A group of traders from Sembia are claiming there's martial law there, mercenaries around, curfews... An interesting perspective on something that *seems* - or is taken to be - nation-wide to some.

Riglan, perception only 14; he saw people checking in and out - seems that pre-booking the room was useful, though he's no idea how long anyone stays for. The bar looks full despite the barman saying it's not that busy a day. Almost all are human.

Temo is looking to see if there's anyone that looks from further East. Perception with luck, 21. Most seem wealthier, not surprising given our choice of inn. One in particular though is sat at a table by themselves, in a darker corner of the bar, facing the party; they're been by themselves. He can't tell their gender as they've a hat, wide-brimmed, indoors; it is hiding half the face. Their hair is straight, tidy, shoulder-length, but doesn't look necessarily feminine. Temo approaches intending to strike up a conversation - wisdom saving! 18+6->24... Temo gets a wave of a sensation of alarm that washes over him, which he fights off; it's as if every cell in his body wanted to leave. Temo walks right up to the table and says, "Well now, that just makes me want to talk to you even more!"

The person looks up. Looks male, pencil-thin moustache, wearing coloured glasses, tinted orange; dressed very properly, a rider's cloak, clasp, fine clothes, hands wear gloves. A glass of wine looks barely touched. He wears rings on the *outside* of gloves.

He folds one hand over another and says, in a low gentle voice, "Well you clearly want to sit down, so why are you waiting?"

Temo sits.

(The rest of the party stays put; Riglan has seen Temo walking over, halting briefly; knows something is up).

The man stares, silently. Temo says, "An interesting defence. It's one we've encountered mostly from people who turn out to be rather unfriendly. I hope that's not the case with you...?"

The man turns his gaze to his glass; swirls it, sniffs, takes a sip, puts it down; looks to Temo, says, "What makes you think I want to be friendly?"

"Imminent war makes it wise to make friends and gain information wherever available."

"*That* might work for you, but I have no need for such pretence."

Temo nature 18; he's breathing, so not undead. Temo says, "Well at least you're not a vampire; that's a start."

The man scowls briefly. Takes another sip. Looks at his hand; takes a ring off; tugs off the glove on the hand; puts the ring back. Then repeats on the other hand, just taking his time. He tolds the two gloves, puts them in his pocket and says, "Do you find you get good results barging on strangers and being rude to them? Does that work for you?"

Temo says, "Being rude, no. Certainly not. I'd have thought being recognised as *not* a vampire was a good thing."

"You presume a lot young man!"

"Well, forgive me if so, but I know so little about you! Where are you from? I'm from the Sword Coast, myself."

"How quaint. I'm not minded to tell you anything about myself. We're strangers in a bar." He looks carefully at Temo and then over to the rest of the party. "Do you think it's wise to be walking around openly being as recognisable as you are?"

Temo says, "We've found being attacked gives an excellent opportunity to thin Azalin's numbers."

The man looks to Temo. "Show me your hand, palm up." "Left or right?" "Doesn't matter" Temo does so, left hand. He puts a finger on the palm, as if tracing a line. As he does so, Temo - WIS saving 21 - recognises a form of touch-based activated telepathy. Temo *allows* it to proceed. The rest of the conversation is silent. The man says, "You think that you've encountered Azalin's forces. I'm sure you have, in some form. But if you think that you're thinning them out in any meaningful way, you clearly have no idea what's coming for you." Temo thinks back, "Oh, we're well aware. That's why we're here, actually." "You're not safe here. Word of you has reached the Gaming Hall." "A price on our heads?" "I hardly think that Azalin's paying people these days! It's an open secret that an old ugly female dwarf, a sharply-dressed halfling, a purple-skinned tiefling and a small firbolg giant are on the Wanted List. It's foolish to show up here so openly." Temo thinks back, "Perhaps if you head over to Zhentil Keep, you'll be able to witness exactly what we're capable of."

A sudden blur of illusion; the hand touching his suddenly feels cold and clammy. The whole creature for a moment takes on a blueish sheen, the eyes bulging briefly; a more raspy but familiar voice now without its previous accent; "You don't realise the tidal wave of change that is sweeping across this land. These nations will fall in its wake. This world is on the brink of being lost. I intend to leave before it does. And you are naive to think that you can stop him." Temo responds with, "I just hope we at least get to see the look on his face when he realises how many of his plans we've ruined!" There's a chuckle. A strange "rippling" of the face; a strange form of laughter, physically manifested. "How cute! You really you think that you've altered the course of this river that is raging on all of civilisation?" He moves back a bit, but still with his hand in contact and says, "I like you. And I hope you survive. And I will see you somewhere out there." He withdraws his hand and briefly, Temo sees a face covered in tentacles - an Illithid! Then the illusion is back in place. He stands - very tall! - glides out of the room, hat pulled low.

He turns at the last minute, to give Temo a look with two big black void eyes this time; Temo hears the words, "I hope you survive". Temo just nods, "likewise".

Temo returns to the table and says quietly, "We should return to our room, immediately. I have much to tell you" - so the party leaves and heads upstairs; Temo tells his story in full. Omitting the "ugly" bit!

Maireagh is grumpy. "So he knows, whatever he is, whoever he works for, what is going on. Chosen not to help."

Temo says, "Yes, because an *illithid* is scared of Azalin's powers. That gives us some idea of what be kind of mental onslaught we might be looking at here."

"So where's *he* going? What's his plan?"

"Don't know. Underdark perhaps."

We figure for the night, we'd better be well prepared with watch and with alarm spells and the like. We must surely have been seen in town as we wandered all over the place, so *someone* might want to try their luck.

Temo sets up Alarm and watch is set. Adv perception thanks to dog, alarm spell, sling of warning etc.

* Maireagh 11+mod (doesn't miss anything tho) 
* Nethza 11+mod (likewise)
* Temo 25...

...and Temo's sling warns him on watch, something approaching but not on top of him. He has a moment to wake up Riglan and tells Riglan to get the other two; Temo goes to a dark corner, goggles on, sets up aim at the window with the balcony - just in case. Perception is only 10 though - he's too distracted waking people up.

Riglan perception 19. Quiet footsteps in the hallway. A shadow under the door. He scoots over to Temo, gives Temo a bit of a kick, points at the door; then Riglan gets behind the door; stealth adv (boots) 18. Nethza has drawn a shadow blade and cast Invisibility. Maireagh deliberately presents herself as a target - angry face, next to the dog, hammer ready, middle of the room.

There's the sound of a lock being picked. Temo rolls his eyes - they are *not* doing a good job! - then "click", it unlocks and the doorknob turns very slowly (as we all watch it!)

The door swings open. A cloaked figure slides into the room with two daggers. It looks at Maireagh and rushes at her.

Temo figures it could be poisoned blades, doesn't want to risk the character reaching Maireagh and tries Hold Person - but it's not effective; it hesitates but then continues, spins around back towards Maireagh, who raises her shield. Riglan swings with the staff as he goes past but misses (attack 11); the dog jumps up; Maireagh blocks no less than three thrusts of the daggers.

Running in behind with a shortsword and shield, wearing studded leather armour, runs in another person, nimble movements; sees Riglan; takes a swing (14) but Riglan avoids it (AC 17). Now the french doors to the balcony swing open; someone else rolls in! Temo's alarm spell goes off - rather redundantly, all things considered. There's a flash of light as Nethza appears alongside and engages as it walks past her. She hits, booming blade; it takes a step backward, BOOM! Well, that'll wake up the hotel. **Two more** run into the room from the door. **Five now.**

They're all female. The window was a woman, nimble, studded leather, hand crossbow, armour. The two most recent arrivals look like thugs more or less. One is a man with a chain mail shirt carrying an axe, the other is a woman, studded leather, short hair, helmet, longsword in one hand and handaxe in the other.

Temo aims and fires at the last arrival. 24. Hits, very sold; 40 damage - she drops straight off, falling backwards and ending up pinned against the wall, unconscious or possibly dead! The man next to her, narrowly missed by the bolt, dashes towards Temo, axe raised; swings - but it smashes into the table next to Temo. He tries again; this time it connects, for a solid 18 damage.

Riglan conjures up L3 4x CR 1/2 (he'd go higher, but the room's not that big and higher level animals are much larger!) - for apes. Chaos reigns! He instructs each to flank one person with one of our friends, and they then each take their attacks. Two attacks hit the bad guy on Nethza; both hit; 14 damage. One hit for the assassin on Maireagh; 6 damage. One hit for the one on Temo, 8 damage again. One hit for the one on Riglan; 8 damage.

Nethza uses a flurry of eldritch blasts, the assailant having unwisely stepped back; hit, hit, crit; takedown.

Maireagh shoves the one in front away to try and get range, but he isn't pushed over; so instead she just slams down with the hammer, at least getting flanking advantage from the ape - but misses. The dog misses too. Maireagh's having a bad day. She shouts in frustration and Temo sees it.

Temo disengages from the guy near him, sees Maireagh struggling and fires at the assassin. He hits, 39 damage, but the assassin isn't taken down. In response it rolls out of the way in reaction, taking less of the impact; disengaging from both Maireagh and the ape in the process; then it leaps towards Temo with its daggers drawn! Miss, miss, hit. 8 damage. Temo is relieved to not feel any poison - at least from the dagger that hit.

The bad guy engaged with Riglan gets into melee and attacks twice. One hit, with the shortsword. Riglan's surprised at the 9 damage and would lose his spell but reacts with his Mind Sharpener cloak to keep it. Running his way, Nethza throws more attacks; crit, hit, miss; the assailant on Riglan is down too. But now a *sixth* person runs in, holding two small hammers. It's a kind of John Wick thing. Nethza throws up a magical shield as the hammers are thrown her way; she blocks both.

The axe wielder now turns to attack the ape, hitting twice; 15 damage total; it's still up.

A *seventh* person bursts in; attacks Riglan directly, just once with a rapier, hits, 22 *sneak* damage. Riglan keeps his spell.

Maireagh sets herself and the dog onto the new arrivals. Maireagh and Nethza are close to Riglan; the door is blocked; the apes are flanking as instructed. Maireagh attacks - she throws *her* hammer at the other hammer throwing guy and hits twice; he goes down (aided by an Arcane Jolt). The dog places itself in position in the door in case anyone else arrives.

Temo breaks away from the assassin, rolls and fires; hits, 40 damage. The assassin tries to dodge once more, but it's too much and they fall.

Riglan uses Primal Savagery and attacks; hits (29!) for 17 damage. The apes both get all their hits, but it's only 8 and 11 damage in total. An unengaged ape sees this and runs in to help; the axe guy is nearly down; misses; the ape on the rapier guy flanking with Riglan tries too, miss; crit; the crit gets 9 damage and that's enough to take down the rapier guy.

The axe guy does a rather dramatic wide swing move, hitting all three apes around; 16 damage to all three, taking the injured one down but leaving two still standing.

The hallway is clear. Nethza runs outsides, and we see her throwing eldritch blasts down the hallway. Sounds of someone in pain. She runs down the hallway apparently in pursuit! Maireagh can hardly believe *that* and runs after her. Riglan shouts to Temo, "You're faster, go help!" and so Temo runs as well, dashing away (seeing two more bodies in the hallway as Maireagh and Nethza are carving path) leaving Riglan to face the axe guy. He throws flame at the axe guy but (15) misses; it hits a chair, which catches fire! The three apes all pile on axe guy. He doesn't stand a chance (including another ape crit).

Riglan instructs them all to follow him down the hallway. He runs. Someone is peering our of a door; Riglan shouts, "Bandits in the hotel, stay in your room!" the door slams shut.

On the second floor, Riglan is still in pursuit, and the party is still heading down to the ground floor. On the way past he sees a night guard unconscious, as a bonus action he casts Healing Word on the way past (7 healing), and the guy wakes but is clearly in pain; he calls, "Intruders! There are intruders!" and Riglan shouts over his shoulder, "stay there, keep safe, we've got it!"

The hotel front door is wide open downstairs. People are coming in one or two at a time. The party is engaged below. By the time Riglan and the apes are down, there are already a trail of bodies on the way to the door. **We count some 14 bodies by the end!** A night porter at the door had been knocked out; another Healing Word; and for a moment, then, it's quiet. Then someone upstairs yells "Fire!" and Riglan shouts to Maireagh, "Oh, yes, I set a chair on fire and forgot, sorry!" - by that point a chair and curtain is on fire but there's a lot of smoke. Maireagh can put out the fire and we can't mend it, but we use cleaning stones to dry everything.

The night porter and guard are very concerned. The window is broken, there are burn marks, but the main front door is broken most importantly, so we go down to help with that to find a rather late arrival of the town guard (and clean up bodies!) It takes about a good hour for all of this to be got through. Cleaning things up, getting rid of bodies, reassuring other hotel guests; we elect to stay in our main room, but the Guard do agree to be posted at our door, at least.

We have to sleep in late to get a proper rest.



## Day 52, Scardale

By 9am, we're up an about. Investigators and guards abound. We go down for breakfast to find - reassuringly - very apologetic staff, rather than aggressive staff. Truthfully, we certainly *are* the reason that trouble came here, not that we knew it would happen. They don't want us to leave - they're actually mortified that there could be an attack here; we insist on paying for damages all the same.

By about midday, we're still there in the midst of tidying - and Sir Isteval and Lesther arrive. Town guard, investigators, broken door - "What's going on?! Oh. This was *you* wasn't it." "Well, it wasn't us, it was fourteen mercenaries in the middle of the night... It's all their fault. Also bad news, it looks like we have to cast our illusions from the river bank where Azalin's emerging as the far side cliff is too far away" - Lesther fortunately already had thought that was the case.

Sir Isteval and Lesther are shown their room. Then we head out. We start discussing how we might scout for Azalin's arrival - park up on the beach in a camp and then what? And what part of the beach?

* Temo can get a Familiar to help watch
* Maireagh can keep an Arcane Eye up for an hour
* Riglan can summon creatures that can help spy too, for an hour as well

Something that can swim - that'd be good; can keep watch a distance out. Next considerations, how do we move effectively to keep ahead of Azalin on arrival without a road.

* Horses or something that flies?
* Temo can conjure a floating disc, but it takes 10 minutes so there's unlikely to be time.
* Riglan could conjure animals that might carry people.

Lesther thinks he can hold his illusion spell's casted location steady, even if he's bobbing around on a horse or something. It would falter if he is injured though. Other concerns:

* The undead army can march without rest, and it's two days to the bridge, if we were going to try and pull them all the way there; so the army could do that in one day, but we couldn't (without magical means).
* Flying spells only keep us in the air for a short time.
* Something as simple as riding horses have the speed and agility but not the stamina.

We run some numbers. We figure we're around 1300lb, give or take, assuming we stow some of Lesther's books and chest in the bag of holding and maybe some of other heavier items could go in there too, but that's ballpark. A cart would have trouble off-road; we'd need a 4-wheeler cart, reinforced, steel bands on the wheels, someone on duty to cast Mending at any time as we travel in case of damage.

A wagon is about 400lb, maybe add a few pounds for reinforcing metalwork. Either way, a draft horse could pull that, with some room to spare. But we'd need two horses!

We come up with the best plan we readily can:

* A draft horse for 8-9 hours, pushing it, then it's set free
* Riglan wildshapes to replace it
* Almost 7 hours later, close to the spell failing, Sir Isteval performs a 10min ritual to call his fey steed, which he thinks can pull the wagon, especially since we should be very close to roads by then
* Maireagh also will relearn Summon Construct for the next day, just in case we need a boost - for 1 hour she can hold an animated creature together. We'll have to find one. 400gp of stone and metal. Temo says, "Art shop!"

Now we need a wagon. Maireagh says she wants to do the reinforcement; we'll need to buy a wagon and convince someone to give us some workshop space for a while.

Lower terrace. Temo finds a wagon shop easily enough and persuasion 29, asks if we can both buy a wagon and use some workshop space. The vendor is happy to oblige, wagon cost 35gp, Maireagh buys 100gp of metals and other material from this place and some nearby outlets, plus workshop rental - that's thrown in, by the time we've spent so much!

Temo is sent by Maireagh on an important shopping mission for the golem template object. He heads to the upper tier to scout for appropriate art objects, and gives Riglan the horn of silent alarm in case of trouble, while Riglan goes looking for a draft horse.

Riglan investigation: 18+0, realises he should actually get outside the city walls as he saw stables there when we were coming in. He has trouble finding a good horse; nature 3+10->13. He does find a number of draft horses that look alright and finds a younger, fitter horse that we might be able to push. He speaks to it to try and persuade it to help out; self-casting Bless after his troubles earlier, he gets persuasion 17. The horse is up for some excitement - it recognises the danger, but if treated well and we promise to set it free - all good. Deal done. Riglan pays 50gp. On the way back, Riglan goes to the market area and pays for some fresh apples for the horse.

Temo meanwhile has followed Riglan up to the top tier, then split off to look for the golem material. Some kind of ornate box made of metal and stone, or a decorative stone inlaid with it. He asks around; persuasion 25; he's thinking maybe tourist shops, rather than expensive art shops, since this town does mine its own ore. Eventually he's told that a donation box in the cathedral would be about right...! Temo heads to the cathedral to make enquiries about where they got it. The donation box he sees (while making a donation) is essentially perfect, but he can't just take it... So, he asks around. "Oh, this is not the original; the original had to be sent for repairs - it's a modern-day replica of the original Offering Box To Umberlee." Temo asks about Umberlee. Godess of the stormy seas. Mental note - Riglan could try divination here.

There aren't many others like it - they have a replica or two - made by a local artisan. Temo asks for details of the artisan - you never know! - so Temo heads to the artisan next. The artisan says it'd take 9-10 days to make something at around 250gp, which Temo suspected, so that's no good and he heads back to the church. Temo offers to donate 400gp because, basically, that's our budget and this is very important to us. Adv persuasion, a whopping 32! They are happy to accept! Temo asks if they have incense, too? They do; he gets a couple of blocks.

So, mission accomplished - Temo takes the box (packed in a less "flash" box itself) and heads, a little nervously in case of attack or theft - back down for the warehouse. He figures he should keep to the side streets; stealth 16+16->32. No problems!

Riglan meanwhile has kind of forgotten about last night already, and is largely totally unaware as he's in the marketplace with the apples that a firbolg stands out clearly. Despite that, he gets back with no trouble and is there well ahead of Temo.

With Temo not back yet, Sir Isteval is helping Maireagh with the work on the wagon. Lesther is re-checking his books, paperwork, spell components and so-on. Nethza wants a backup plan, though. "Do you feel lucky?" she asks Riglan. "Do you want to come with me to some of the warehouses and see if we can buy ourselves any magic items? Or do a divination to ask for guidance?" He can certainly help Nethza with divination, if she wants to contact the Raven Queen; she wants to try.

We head outside. Nethza finds a quiet shack, apparently unused, all shadows and dust. Riglan starts to set up - "What do you think I should ask?" "You cast and I'll ask". "OK!" - and a short while later, Riglan casts his ritual.

"Show me a sign - give me your blessing - where should I search to find what will aid us in our escape from Azalin?"

The smoke swirls into a vision. It's very specific! A stall in the market! It sells rugs. A particular rug is in technicolour against a backdrop of black and white. The colour slowly fades; the answer is, "7 days. I will grant you a boon to aid you for 7 days. Speak my name into this rug (!)."

The smoke fades away. Riglan stands up and scratches his head; "Well, I've heard stories about them - I thought it sounded - well a bit too silly... You don't think... Not a flying carpet?!"

"Could be, but it feels like a temporary boon."

"Yes, 7 days of flying carpet. Maybe."

"We need to find the rug."

"No problem, I was just up there" - Riglan, history 15. He certainly knows where the stall is and we head there directly. We don't cross paths with Temo, who is taking the back streets at very roughly around the same time.

At the stall, perception 9+10->19. Riglan sees the rug! Nethza, persuasion 21, to buy it. 20gp! But we take it. Temo's just arriving and his expression, and Maireagh's - wagon just finished - at the sight of the two of them carrying a carpet is something to behold. Maireagh at first thinks it's some kind of comfort or decoration! But not so - Nethza speaks the name of the Raven Queen into the rug...

...and that's it. It unfurls, 4ft x 6ft, hovering in the air. It'll carry a couple of people. We test it out with some weight; Riglan is about its maximum, with pack, so that's around 400lb, before it slows down. We can't fit enough people on to make it actually sink, so that's all we need from it. However, speed *might* be an issue - it can easily outpace Temo when lightly loaded, else it's about Riglan's speed (60ft vs 30ft).

We manage to *just* squeeze into the fast speed weight limit, by putting a lot into the bag of holding; Temo and Riglan can both fly on the carpet. We can use this to get people over the river, for starters. We can have Maireagh cast Levitate for the wagon and - tricky; the horse; cast Fly?!

Temo mentions the goddess of the cathedral to Riglan; but aided by Sir Isteval, Temo, religion 22, realises that Umberlee is not a benevolent goddess, controlling storms and making seas choppy, calming the oceans if seas sail. She's responsible for bad things - ships sinking, sailors drowning. A goddess of chaos. So his idea of using that place for divination of whereabouts Azalin might have got to is perhaps not the best. Besides, Riglan reminds Temo that there's the anti-scrying thing going on - and as far as we know, even the gods can't punch through that!

The whole thing takes up pretty much the whole day. At the end of it, Riglan fetches the draft horse, and he tows the wagon out and pays for stabling overnight just outside the city walls.

It's a slightly sombre dinner (in the hotel). We're anxious and it's not helped by the evidently nervous hotel, with very many extra guards! There's new wallpaper up in the room. We offer that the four of us can stay elsewhere overnight, but the hotel is worried about its reputation - not being able to protect people.

We head to bed - we're all going to be on watch tonight. Temo sets up Alarm for the balcony again; Lesther sets up for their own room something similar - conjuring his own Faithful Hound! We never found time to go to the game hall and try, who knows, intimidation or bribery or something to stop the attacks; so we might be at risk again tonight...

...and after all that? A quiet night - except for Riglan perhaps. Wisdom saving, 18.

* He sleeps, dreams normally for a while.
* He's looking at the stars, trying to talk to the Shepherds.
* There's a cold, gripping panic though and it increases in intensity as the dream progresses!
* He has a sense of a deep, evil darkness, spreading across the ocean in the dream.
* Even the Shepherds are scared.
* A bad, "seeping" feeling, as if pushing against the edges of the dream world itself, but the Shepherds help hold it back from flooding in and it remains just a feeling or an anxiety.
* He feels the power growing though.
* **It is getting harder to keep it out; to resist the intrusion.**

Temo has an interesting night too. Wisdom saving, 21.

* Dreams of being a Lord's Alliance member. "It's an important day!"
* He has a footman and house staff; there's a knock at the door, "Good morning, Lord Temo! Don't forget, today's the big day when you have to appear in court! We've laid out all your best clothes" - and so-on.
* He has a hurried breakfast, kisses Qelline on the cheek as she has a more relaxed breakfast with Carp; heads out, people wishing him well.
* Rides out on his pony, people on the way also wishing him well.
* The road winds up to a beautiful palace, looks rather like the one in Cormyr. He is to appear before the queen!
* He is given the Oath Of Fealty. "I swear fealty to you", representing the Lord's Alliance, and so-on and so-forth; he's been practicing it in front of a mirror...
* ...and then it's his turn! A fanfare sounds. He arrives in a throne room. Keep your gaze down until spoken too. The room is full of people in very fancy clothes.
* He hears a voice say, to his side, "It's time to kneel!" and two other people beside him kneel; he does as well.
* A voice says, "Rise, my subjects" - so he does; lifts his head and sitting in the throne...
* **...Azalin Rex, inevitably.**

Temo wakes immediately! He's soaked in sweat. Fortunately, he gets back to sleep, but it takes a while.



## Day 53, Beach Across River From Scardale
### 8am

Riglan swaps Wind Walk for Travel Via Plants.

Temo and Riglan mention dreams over breakfast, and then the rest of the party confess to various forms of bad dreams. Maireagh was ancient and undead, Nethza dreams her patron had been Azalin Rex all along; that he's manipulated her to set events in motion to enable his return; taps into a fear of hers. Interestingly, Sir Isteval and Lesther say they slept soundly.

A full buffet breakfast because, albeit a day early, we're checking out; we need to camp from here. The hotel is still very apologetic. We try to explain it's not because of the attack; in the end they prepare a basket for our "picnic on the beach"!

That's that; time to head out. We walk up and collect the horse and wagon, then head around to the cliff. "Right" says Riglan, "So this is the bit where we have to convince a horse to just sort of, walk off a cliff and fly, yeah?" - Maireagh suggests that he and Temo ride the carpet alongside the horse to lead it. Riglan casts Speak to warn the horse; Maireagh casts Fly on it; we get on the carpet; Riglan leads the horse carefully down and across the river to the other side - adv (due to Speak) animal handling, 16. Temo flies the carpet back for Sir Isteval. Lesther will sit in the wagon while Maireagh (via boots) and Nethza (via coat) fly and push the levitated wagon.

It only takes two trips, going surprisingly smoothly, to get everyone down on the far side. "Right", says Temo, "camping spot - we need somehow to get a good run of the whole of the width of the beach for surveillance, potentially, possibly for at least the next full day."

We find a good spot and set up camp. Maireagh casts Private Sanctum, a new spell for her, which creates a cube 100ft x 100ft on the footprint going up 30ft, which stops people hearing what we're saying - but stops us hearing outside too. People can't see inside. It should protect us from scrying too and teleportation too. We are free to walk in and out of it though. We figure from the outside that it's got this grey, smoke-like appearance and is really huge and obvious (!) so it's shrunk down to better match the size of camp.

Preparation is mostly done. Temo runs Find Familiar as a ritual and calls a little fey crab! It can look under the water for him, but live just fine on land too. It hangs around at the water's edge.

Riglan chats with Nethza about "early warning" methods. If we had an hour he could use Heroes Feast...

Riglan tends to the horse, too. Oats and apples.

The beach has a sand dune behind, leading up to the plains area behind. Because it's a steep beach, it's only about 30ft from dune to water, so we're up on the plains area.

Riglan almost on a whim finds a quiet spot and burns incense, casting Divination as a ritual. He figures it's a matter of near-field future telling; a rough idea of landfall. So he thinks he'll try to contact Savras. The oracle after all saw us meeting Azalin, not where Azalin was; it was *our* perspective. So that's the way. "Roughly how many hours from now will we meet Azalin on the shores of this beach?"

Smoke swirls around in wind, spreading out, filling out like a fog around where Riglan stands. It seems wild; untamed; uncontrolled... But then it seems to focus on Riglan, gathering nearer to him and suddenly forming a rapidly shifting scene. Our party appears as smoke beings, sped up, moving very quickly, almost impossible to follow. Suddenly it shows us all turning towards the beach, shocked, grabbing things, jumping onto the wagon. It "pulls back", showing a wider field of view. A moon above sea. Time seems to go backwards; the moon drops into the water; the sun rises; it sits high in the sky - then it dissipates and the sun is where it is right now.

**So it's tonight**. But however hard we try, we're probably caught by surprise.

Nature 21; based on the moon location and remembering the previous night, it would be roughly 1am. Pitch dark. We'll need strategies for it. We'll be running the horse in the dark off road.

Riglan gets back to the party and explains. It gives us some new problems. But Riglan can cast Darkvision *on the horse* and by 9am, it'll be daylight anyway. Temo and Riglan can swap goggles as needed. It helps Lesther to prepare too and in fact thinks moonlight will be a more convincing illusion; colours need not be so accurate.

The plan is probably:

* Temo with goggles gets the wagon moving
* Darkvision on the horse around midnight, just for safety
* Owl fey creature to be conjured and fly out to judge army size as we flee
* We will keep one or two people depending on weight on the carpet at all times, to minimise wagon weight
* Rotation for wagon driving
  - With original horse
    - Temo driving, Maireagh keeping an eye on wheel condition, Lesther casting
    - Nethza driving, Riglan keeps an eye on wheel condition, Lesther rests
    - Mairegh driving, Lesther on wheel condition
    - Isteval driving, Temo on wheel condition
  - Istaval's spirit horse, pushed to 9 hours
    - Repeat as above
  - Riglan as horse, 7 hours, if needed
    - Repeat cycle above, except Lesther has to do two shifts on wheel condition

But we have another problem, and it's a really bad one. We'd planned on being up 24h for those three shifts *but* we can't get a proper rest before 1am (or thereabouts) when all this kicks off. **And we'll already have been awake for some 17 hours by then**.

The above still works, but is risky for exhaustion. Maireagh can make up a batch of mastica, at least! We draw up a complex running order that gives everyone a chance to rest with Isteval bearing the brunt of it with a double driving shift over daybreak.

Riglan says, "well, we can have a feast tonight then! If it doesn't work out and Azalin doesn't turn up - well, we have to give that one up. But if it works, we have a strong advantage. And we'll need everything we can get."

### Shortly before 10pm

Riglan brings forth the feast. Even the horse takes part! It is particularly fond of the deserts and fresh vegetables.

### 11pm

We eat and it's good and despite that, everyone is getting really nervous. Sir Isteval ends up deep in prayer. Lesther keeps re-reading his spell book. Maireagh checks and re-checks gadgets.

(The temp HP 2d10 roll for the feast sadly is dreadful - a 2 and a 3, only 5 out of a possible 20).

The moon is up.



## Day 54 - Landfall day - midnight

Riglan casts Darkvision on the horse.

Maireagh has constructed a special gadget; everyone can see invisible things now. Even the horse. So if something invisible tries to run into its path, it can see it and avoid it. Even Temo's crab is gifted!

Temo spends time chatting to Lesther, trying to reassure or inspire him; persuasion 26. But it seems Lesther is made of strong stuff and is doing OK. He's just coming up with one contingency after another, writing them all down. Temo certainly appreciates the diligence - casting and controlling *two* complex spells simultaneously is no mean feat, with or without the help of an artefact.

Temo gets his crab to get under the water and keep listening. Watch for startled fish, listen for strange sounds, anything... But it's a very big beach and a very small crab. They both know that. They're really just keeping each other company.

Lesther asks Maireagh to dispel the sanctuary. Then he casts his hardest, highest level spell. It's a scroll and above what he could normally do; a programmed illusion. He's measured everything during the day; studied tide charts; needs to get his 120ft exactly right. He's even put rocks on the sand, trying to look natural but having distance marker meaning to his keen eye. It'll contain an exact copy of our party; wants us to think about what we'd say if we were there, that close.

* Riglan says, "It's him! Run!"
* Temo says, "But I wanted to see the look on his face when he realises how many of his plans we've messed up...!"
* Nethza says, "Fiend of the nightmares - you have followed me across worlds. You will not prevail. Not here. Not on my world and not on my watch."
* Maireagh says, "Ugh! It's *you*!"
* Sir Isteval says he'd draw his sword and a shed burst of radiant light; he'd say "We march!"

It is cast on a trigger - undead at the edge of the water will start it immediately. We need to be 90ft behind it - 210ft from the water. It'll last about ten minutes, after which Lesther will back it up with major illusions and so-on for as long as he can, just to at least *try* to keep the army following until - essentially - they get angry enough to just keep pursuing us.

Riglan gathers everyone around once that's done. "This is where it really starts. This is where it gets difficult. This is where we're truly tested. But he thinks he has us in his sights. He thinks he has us where he wants us. But he has it backwards. *He* is in *our* sights. And *he* is about to appear *exactly* where we expect him to."

Minutes *crawl* by.

Suddenly the crab signals a warning and starts running back up the beach sideways. Temo shouts out. We all, as predicted notes Riglan, turn suddenly to look at the sea!

The moon has risen. It almost seems calm and quiet. The wind dies. Waves lap against the shore.

The flow of waves is disturbed; we turn, looking the 200ft towards the waters edge; it seems to be bubbling! Foam that doesn't settle... Flotsam and jetsam, seaweed, tattered clothes, bones appear on the water's edge; then the creatures start to crawl up the sand, forming, standing.

**They're here - it looks like a wave has crested - the illusion kicks in.**

### Chase plus zero

A length of beach 100ft long rises, shaking off sand and water. In the middle - even more bubbling up, an upwelling, as if something flat and wide is rising up; the water starts to waterfall and cascade off it; **an obsidian slab, with a throne in the middle rising up.**

A wet, cloaked, crown-wearing figure. Slimy, wet, wrinkled skin, thin flesh. It stands up from the throne. All across the platform of the slab, strange creatures, long snouts, skeletal, sharp teeth - undead dire wolves maybe? - also stand. And more emerge. The waves pull back, revealing more of the army. Lesther notices the illusion has started speaking - "It's him, run!", Temo's bit, Nethza and Maireagh as more of the army rises up. It's a strange writhing mass, slowly pulling itself out of the water, crawling along. More waters part as skeletal horses, apparently wearing long slats of wood as armour, rusted strips of metal holding it together, riders atop; very large misshapen skulls, long foreheads with various terrifying headdresses - once perhaps feathered, but now those are just feather spines. One has a curved antler crown. **Generals**.

(Riglan is calling his owl)

It gets worse. Zombie ogres; rotting gnolls, wolf beings, a combination of all kinds of humans, natural unddead and more.

Then the illusion shows Isteval's light. The illusion is moving. Riglan's owl is out. Riglan and Istval say at the same time, "We need to go now!"

Temo jumps to the wagon's seat. Nethza jumps onto the carpet and pulls up Lesther. Riglan, Maireagh and Isteval jump into the cart. Riglan sends the owl on a high altitude flyover. The dog runs alongside, Temo gets the wagon moving, Riglan casts Speak With Animals.

Nethza commands the carpet to keep pace with the wagon, 5ft off the ground. We're moving.

There's a horrifying screech behind us. It echoes across the countryside behind us. Thank goodness for the Heroes Feast, as it's a *terrifying*, blood-curdling, ancient, pained scream. We don't even know who or what made it. It bounces off the far cliff way over the river, off trees, echoes all around us. Riglan hears immediately the sound of countless animals fleeing the area. Birds fly in all directions.

Now there's more, a strange groaning, crunching, grinding sound; a distant wave rolling up the shore; it seems to be the constant movement of undead.

The owl sees this ragged 100ft wide front, now turning into kinds of peninsulas of movement as the horse riding generals move to the front. More and more bubbles out of the ocean, wider and wider, tapering in behind. The owl can see at least 100ft back into the waves and it's just full there. Riglan asks it to keep flying, keep high, watch until it sees the end of the army, then follow the river to get back to us.

Before losing contact, Riglan via owl sees that the ogres are now carrying the obsidian slab. In Azalin's hand is a gleaming staff of some kind, serpents intertwined all the way up, almost touches but flares out at the last minute at the top, an orb floating at the top. Looks distinctly Netherese.

Riglan leans over the driver's seat and shouts to the horse, "Do not be afraid! We are all with you. We are your protectors and your courage. Dig in, now. Dig in and pull. We must keep ahead of these fiends for many hours."

Temo meanwhile, suddenly, "Damn! I didn't get a look at his face to see if he was pissed off at us!"

We lost about 10-20ft; so we're maybe 200ft ahead. Riglan can't see in the dark and his owl is busy checking the size of the army, so asks Maireagh if she can see if they're making any moves to run at us, jump forward, or are they keeping distance?

Maireagh casts Arcane Eye, and sends it back. We're burning resources a bit already, given we've been at this all day, cart-over-the-river, sanctum and all. After about 30 seconds, she gets a good view. She can keep it in range - we're only doing about 30ft speed with the heavy cart and so are they. They're not running. So if we can maintain this speed, we're OK... They seem unhurried somehow... "Oh, OK, something's happening - this is not great!" says Maireagh. Riglan reconnects to the owl as it circles around; but perception (even with advantage via its keen eyes) is only 3,4 + his 10 -> 14. He can't see clearly, but does see Azalin hoist his hand up, not his staff hand, the with a flick of the wrist, rising out from the water now some distance behind and coming off the moisture of the army itself are icicles. **They point forward then are thrown at us!** A storm of ice daggers is aimed at the illusion, shredding into it. This reveals it as an illusion straight away.

Riglan shouts to Lesther, "Gig's up! Nethza, keep him shielded if you can!"

Now Azalin stands. Riglan loses sight; the owl goes out of range. He *hears* Azalin start to chant. Maireagh says, "Oooooh, shit..."; Riglan now can see a swirl of glowing cinders and ash start to surround him. It coalesces on his staff; Azalin lifts it up high; a bolt of fire shoots up into the sky. Riglan shouts, "Heads up! Incoming" - but for a moment, nothing happens, but then small sparks of light behind the clouds appear - and a storm of glowing rocks burst down, raining down onto the entire countryside around us.

Lesther tries to throw up a shield to protect us, but the horse is darting around now; Temo and Isteval are both on the reins; adv animal handling 7,7+1 - the horse starts to move quickly to one side - but luck point, Temo slides in the seat at the sudden jolt, inadvertently tugging on the reins; the horse corrects. The meteors meanwhile pass straight through his spell! It's not high level enough. So instead, he now uses his bracers and casts illusions of the party that show us splitting apart into three copies, so it's not clear which is which.

Riglan wild shapes into a giant eagle to fly above the horse and shield it.

Dex saves all round, but +5 thanks to Isteval and on-cart with advantage as the animal handling ended up going well:

* Temo a very solid 13,16+11->27 (which helps the cart)
* Maireagh 22 - helps Riglan
* Riglan 9,11 + 0 + 5 -> 16 + 5 from Maireagh -> 21
* Nethza is OK, Lesther is OK
* Dog gets hit!

We all take 41 fire damage, halved to 20; plus 30->15 bludgeoning. *71* total. Temo reacts to avoid any of it. The dog is *very very* badly damaged. Riglan's fallen onto the horse and has to climb back to the cart, then Riglan shouts to the dog, "Get on the cart!" and to his surprise, it listens to him and does so. Maireagh starts mending. Isteval leans forward to heal the horse which did take some damage, not least from Riglan dropping on it (but it did help shield it from the meteors).

Riglan shouts across to Nethza, "Can you see Azalin?" "Just about make him out! He's quite far away" "OK, I'm just going to check the wheels" - perception 28. The wood is scorched in a few areas. Riglan says, "Maireagh, when you're done with the dog, might be worth a bit of checking on those wheels."

Nethza is putting out small burnt areas on the carpet.

The owl looks close. Riglan tries to connect to it. He sees huge pockmarks across the countryside, smouldering craters, even some trees on fire. It seems to be over a *huge* area (5000ft!). The owl has *still* not seen the back end of the sea yet. He thanks the owl and asks it to keep circling. Before it goes, he sees that Azalin we note is getting further away and harder to see, as the army itself swirls around him and advances in front faster than he moves. Riglan relays that to the party - worse, two separate vanguards seem to be separating out in front, led by two on-horse generals. They've galloped apparently to get ahead of the rest of the army, and they seem to be gaining for moment.

Temo tries to get the horse to go faster too, but adv animal handling - only 10. Isteval offers to take over, he says "I know horses!" and Temo is happy to hand over. "If you don't mind" he says, "if we can lighten the wagon more that might help?" - we figure the carpet will take the weight without dropping to 30ft max speed; acro 24, he gets on OK, but that's the absolute limit. It's *just enough*, kinda like not having the dog on board; Riglan shouts encouraging in-horse words to it; the horse is able to pull into a canter just to get distance back again, briefly. Isteval is fully focused on that task now - especially given the much harder terrain now, with the craters.

The owl comes back. It reports that Azalin seems to be mustering the army further back; more and more still coming out of the sea. The generals are an advance from. The main army has spilled well out onto the plains. But there's at least some good news - the army *is* (sort of) heading our way, not over the river, but isn't marching. It's just *growing*.

The two vanguards however certainly *are* headed our way. Maybe 40-50 creatures each. We couldn't tackle even one of those. All we can do is hope that the rest of the army follows. The owl cycles back away again, flying back towards the sea.

We're around 800-900ft away from the water at the point where the owl comes back to say that the army seems to have more or less finished emerging. It's covering at least 150-200ft wide by 250-300ft deep and the bodies are so closely packed that it's hard to tell them apart; it's just a writing swarm. Riglan now asks the owl to keep as far as it can, but keep eyes on Azalin Rex; and as he does that, his mind reels and recoils from the calculation it is being forced to make - that many creatures, packed into that area... **The army must *TEN THOUSAND* strong!**

"There's - there around *ten thousand* of them - I think..." shouts Riglan. Temo shouts back over his shoulder "And how many of us?" "Oh, *well*, just give me a moment while I take a head count...!"

Riglan noting the vanguard splitting and attempting to flank takes a punt; he uses Hallucinatory Terrain off to the right, to try and direct the group further from the river. It doesn't really change their course but they slow down to avoid pockmarks that aren't there. Maireagh says, "Oh, I'd have made it look like there weren't any, so that they fell into the craters!" - Riglan didn't think of that! Lesther's 3 copy illusion is helping too (he tell us he can keep it going for ten minutes). It's dividing attention of the two vanguard groups.

Maireagh gets onto the wheels and reinforces them via Mending - takes a minute.

"...Eight. Including the horse!" shouts Riglan over his shoulder, to Temo.

A little while later we're clear of the cratered area, travelling at a faster rate, but the horse is getting tired. We're heavy, especially with the metal dog on board. The owl circles back around and Riglan (adv perception) sees that the two chasing groups are worryingly close now. The closest is 150ft behind. The rightward one, slowed earlier, about 200ft. Our 40ft starts to drop down towards 30ft again. We need to increase distance somehow, but this is as fast as can go.

Riglan relays the worry. Nethza slows the carpet and starts to concentrate. She holds the Raven Queen amulet/pendant and starts to weave a spell. Dropping back around 30ft, she traces a rune in the air; then pulls it out and 'throws' it back. In front of the leftmost vanguard, she creates a 60ft wide wall of light; the general's horse stops abruptly; rears up; they have trouble passing through it - we even see some smaller creatures incinerated. Netzha catches back up.

The whole area is lit up brightly and for once, Riglan can see the area clearly. The nearby army is a mixture of zombies, skeletons and ghouls on the whole. Most look drowned/fish-eaten. Ocean floor scavenging... Disposable foot soldiers. However, there are a few much more scary looking supernatural undead including the presumed-general. They're starting to walk around the wall as they've realised the danger. Some seem confused - Nethza says they're blinded - we draw another 100ft, to a more comfortable 250ft for that group.

Riglan uses the bright light to see the other group off to the right, 200ft away. He casts Plant Growth at 150ft range, 100ft radius, to trap at least the front of the group in thick brambles. They'll have to go through or around - they slow down too. Riglan sees they actually start to *cut* through the vegetation, slashing with weapons. Not the brightest then.

One group behind at 250ft; one group to the right falling back at least that far, or further, going at about 1/4 of their previous speed through the brambles.

We're barely ten minutes into the ordeal. We've some distance on the chasing parties. The closer, having worked around the light wall, is about 300ft back; the other, around 400ft. They converge, one behind the other, no longer widely spread out as if flank.

We see if we can settle in and calm down - conserve energy. The owl is on the far reach of its circuit, so Riglan asks Maireagh if the arcane eye she had running before the meteor storm is still up, and it is, but she's busy with mending and so-on so it hasn't been moved forward. She can see through it - but is still busy. Riglan has to wait for his owl in that case. He still senses it.

Temo turns and tries to be inspiring; shouts words to the effect of the worst might be over, we've got distance and we can knuckle down.

Maireagh stops Mending; concentrates; but then says, "The eye has been dispelled. It was probably detected as they moved closer to it, and destroyed it" - Riglan says, "Well, it gave us the warning we needed for the meteors; if you have time and energy, I guess keep trying to help the dog?" - she agrees. Over the next ten minutes or so:

* Riglan periodically reconnects to the owl, which is doing circuits to see where the leading edge of the main army is. Each time it comes back, it gives him an impression of movement and distance. This does mean the owl flies over both vanguard groups in each direction for each circuit; it is at risk. It estimates **20-25ft speed**. That's slow, but probably can keep going indefinitely. This means we're pulling away from it, *but* the lead vanguard group is still trying to catch us. So, we can't wait and maintain army distance - we must push on. Riglan lets Isteval know - **maintain best speed**.

* Meanwhile Lesther seems to be preparing another spell, and is watching carefully behind. It's a copy of the party again, as his previous casting expired, but just the one this time - conserves energy. Isteval pulls closer to the river; the illusion goes wider, to the left, looking forwards. (Via DM rolls) The illusion is very convincing; but the chasing groups are very observant. Not *quite* observant enough. Lesther steers his illusory party Southward, peeling it away. The closest group takes the bait and peels off. One down, one to go. They'll hopefully keep going for another ten minutes before realising that they've been duped!

* Temo blows a Level 3 and uses Sending to Coronal Ilsevele; "Army made landfall and in pursuit. Riglan estimates ten thousand strong undead. Headed for Ashara's Crossing, if we last that long"; a brief reply after a pause; "Exodus proceeding. The Spell has been cast" - with emphasis on "The Spell"; we realise this is the mass Gentle Repose casting. Then, by stone to Sembia, he tries to get the Speaker's Assistant with the same message. About a minute later, a reply; "In the middle of the night! I will inform the Speaker and get an emergency meeting underway. Please keep up posted. Don't bring them south!" and Temo answers, "Trying to draw the army North over the Crossing; some vanguards headed South, but small in number, and we suspect they'll rejoin the main army soon." After that he keeps lookout but his goggles have very limited range.

* Maireagh continues mending the dog, checking on people, quite tightly wound, mostly quiet.

* Nethza does her best to stand on the carpet and look around. She asks if Temo is looking, who confirms he's trying to keep watch as well, but it's difficult since it's dark. He doesn't want to risk floating lights as that'd blow Lesther's illusion. Nethza calls over to the cart and says, "Well, we're doing the best we can; if anyone needs to rest, try!"

Riglan's out of wildshapes, so tries to relax a corner of the cart. Once the Familiar comes into range, he asks it to hold pace at the leading edge of the closest vanguard; and if they're getting within ~200ft, let him know. That helps him relax a little. He sees Maireagh is very stressed, and tries to console her, dog's looking good, eye did its job; she should try and rest too. Lesther moves down into the cart so Maireagh can rest on the carpet. Lesther sits up front, next to Isteval; they talk quietly. The dog stands on the back of the cart, keeping watch and guarding Riglan.

Over the next 10-20 minutes, there are moments where the group tries to gallop and speed up to catch us. At one point, getting within as low as 180ft, Nethza used her light wall again before the Owl needed to act and disturb Riglan. This time she deliberately tries to plant it right in their midst, having seen the effect it had on the other vanguard group. That other group by now might have seen the illusion vanish and be on its return, but then again, the wall of light could've blown our cover - and she looks very carefully across the southward plains; she's sure she can see something new in the dark; the original vanguard on its return? She whispers that to Temo.

### Chase +1h 20m

D20->5. Riglan finishes a short rest; the owl goes back on to "warn us if they get close" duty. He and Temo whisper from wagon to carpet, and Temo convinces Nethza to try and have a short rest too. Temo takes over carpet control, but tells Riglan that the other vanguard was on its way back. Riglan calls his owl in to use its vision at 100ft max range to keep an eye out the back, the owl now flying low, in small circles. The owl says the returning vanguard was at full gallop, and ended up around 350ft away before slowing. So now they've swapped - the second vanguard is the closer, 250ft. They're once again "horizontally separated" though.

D20->8. Nothing bad happens in the next hour, but Isteval needs Riglan's help now and again with rough terrain and a still-rather-spooked horse.

### +2h 20m

Nethza gets her hour of rest in. Maireagh starts her third hour of rest so far. Nethza asks if anyone needs to try and fully sleep. Riglan suggests Isteval rest, since Riglan's now had some time steering the cart and has the hang of it. To conserve spells, he borrows Temo's googles; Nethza takes over carpet control again. Temo kills time playing with the crab.

The wind picks up. It comes from the ocean, and smells *bad* - carrying the odour of decay from perhaps the distant army and certainly the nearby vanguard. Cliffs to the river on the right aren't so deep now. Riglan listens carefully to nature; the sound of the river; the wind in bushes and trees; perception 23. Carried on the wind, he hears chittering, clicking, clattering, bones hitting bones - but in a speech-like way. He *thinks* that the two chasing groups might be getting close to converging and communicating. They march, keeping pace with us. He hoarse-whispers over his shoulder - "Keep a sharp eye out; I think they're planning something".

Suddenly the dog, which had been lying down, stands up at the end of the cart and looks as if it is pointing at something with its muzzle. Riglan's owl is *not* warning him. Nethza and Temo - we can all still see invisibility! - see two ghostly apparitions, *close* - 60ft - floating towards us. Temo calls a quiet warning to Riglan; Nethza throws eldritch blasts immediately. Lesther picks up, trying to not wake Isteval, releases a barrage of magic missiles; Temo sees that they do connect; Temo aims at the one to the right and hits, 28 damage, but it's not down. They're only 30ft away. It's still coming - but *that* one is focused on Temo. It raises it arms, reaching for him...

...Riglan is trying to speed up the horse. Animal handling dirty 20, it's reluctant - but it breaks into a canter, taking us in a short burst of speed. The gap increases, maybe 60ft again, in a burst of speed. Nethza keeps focusing on the left hand one she hit before; three more blasts; she draws her sword. Lesther changes tactic, instead 'painting' in the air an illusion of a giant bat which becomes *real* somehow and attacks the left hand one which falls back a bit. The other one is within 30ft of the cart again and Temo once more has to aim and fire. A better hit - 42 damage. This takes it down, **but it screams** as it dies - immediately waking Maireagh and Isteval. Rather hilariously, Nethza tries to reassure Maireagh that everything is fine, she should go back to sleep! "Just keep resting!" Maireagh asks, "Is that a giant bat? What happened to the owl?" and Riglan calls over his shoulder, "no, don't know where that is, but it's still with us. That's Lesther's!" - offers to call a creature to help; Lesther thinks it's not needed - but at that moment the spectre draws all the life out of the bat, which turns grey, then crumbles to dust. The remaining ghost gets close as Lesther throws a firebolt. It dodges. Temo once more, aim and fire; 36 damage; this one dies too. No scream though - instead, we hear a strange pained, frustrated howl, from the chasing group further behind, which slows again. The two groups are probably going to join each other. They fall back to 300ft.

Nethza insists again that Maireagh goes back to sleep. Isteval has been positively nonchalant during this, as if there were no need to intervene - but actually with a firm grip on his sword. We note that the Paladin's aura washed over us when he awoke; we are without that protection when he sleeps. Riglan encourages him to try and rest more, all the same.

### +3h 30m

D20->18. It's still pitch dark. 4:30am, maybe.

By the *end* of that hour, Riglan sees a slight hint, in the distance - the very tops of the clouds - perhaps, the very beginning of dawn? An impression of outline against a lightening sky? He hopes so. The horse has been back at normal pace for ages, but is clearly getting tired. He whispers back to get Temo to join him up front.

TL;DR - of all the things to forget - we didn't rig the wagon with two "harnesses" for two horses, so we could conjure a new one, hook it up while still moving, then set the other free. The best we can come up with is an on-the-fly transfer, very tricky, strength to move the harness and great balance and dexterity - like Temo. Riglan thinks for a minute, then says, "That's it! I've still got a potion of strength!" - so when the time comes to switch to Isteval's horse, that's our plan.

After a little while, Riglan checks over his shoulder again. No question now - the sky lightens. And now he sees the silhouette of the chasing groups - still two of them, distinct - and he almost wishes it was dark; they look at *lot* closer once he sees them like that. The silhouettes of the generals' helmets rise above all else; below, spikes - spears, swords, maybe more.

Temo figures he can feed the horse apples, if he's very careful. He can walk along one of the wooden bars that are either side of the horse and lean over to feed it apples. Food and water, of a sort. So he tries that. Acro 20. Not the most elegant thing he's ever done, bit shaky; one hand on ropes or the saddle, one hand on apples. The horse is surprised initially but definitely into it and happily consumes several apples but Temo makes sure not to over-do it - we don't want a sick horse on our hands.

Back in the seat next to Riglan, he says, "I can't believe we've made it this far - I know they must have a lot more to throw at us, but I didn't even think we'd make an hour at first. What with the meteors and everything!" Riglan agrees; we just have to keep watch and reacting, do our best to rest. "How long does Maireagh's invisibility thing last?" he asks. Temo isn't sure, but thinks it might already have expired. Riglan shudders, and says, "Well, I just hope *they* don't know that." Temo says, "No, it's fine, look" - and goes back to the bag of holding, pulls out the device, "We can use this!" and uses it on the two of them. Just in case. That's how come Temo could see the ghouls earlier - he'd already been using it, after Maireagh had shown him now back at the beach.

### +4h 30m

It's 5:30 in the morning. The sun is just coming up. Patch cloud is illuminated above but most of the land is in shadow. The the vanguard is easier to see now. Riglan risks looking around for a good look. Finally he sees with his own eyes. A bristling array of spears and marching undead. There isn't just one general on horseback in each group; a couple of other riders are visible, on what appear to be skeletal mounts of some sort. Whatever they are, they don't look like horses. He remembers seeing what he thought were skeletal dire wolves back at the beach via the owl - perhaps it's those.

D20->15. We reach terrain that seems harder-soiled, grassy but less undulating. To Riglan's astonishment there's a dirt road - we're in a farming area! - so the cart is able to move more easily and the horse doesn't have to work so hard to maintain speed. It's a much smoother ride. The horse just picks up pace naturally, 40ft. Temo keeps a close eye on the vanguard distance; they haven't sped up yet, but they're not on the road yet.

Riglan's owl flies back and perches on the back next to him. He tries to see where the road goes, to judge if we should stay on it, but persuasion is only 12. It turns South, but joins quickly a larger road that goes Westward for a fair distance. It's not exactly straight. But turning would slow us down and might mean we meet travellers. The terrain also favours our chasers as well as ourselves. In the end, unsure, he decides that the road is less likely to damage the cart, so he'll take his chances. He warns Nethza on the carpet, then turns us 90 degrees to the south - and unsurprisingly, one of the vanguards starts to cut across diagonally to intercept. Temo sees that it's OK - they won't catch us - though for sure, they'll close some distance.

Riglan asks the owl to check on everything behind. The other vanguard ended up on the road too, but then also decided to cut across.

One more sharp turn needed to get back West - this one is tricky - animal handling 18 - he manages to get the horse to take the corner wide and turn rapidly; even so, two wheels on the outside lift off the ground briefly before thumping back down! Sir Isteval wakes; he's told in no uncertain terms to go back to bed by Lesther. Isteval pulls his cape over his face.

We're a bit of a distance from the river, but we're on a better road. The vanguard seem somewhat confused; their diagonal cutting across the field is abandoned, and they turn west too. They're destroying the fields as they go over them - just trampling everything. When they get onto the road, parts of them, including the general, start to move faster and get ahead - the rest fall behind though, squeezing into the width of the road, rather than any of them staying "cross country" either side (because they simply can't go as quickly).

We get out of the fields and a road turns more North West. That's not too bad. The owl keeps checking. It sees in a while that it hits an apparently fairly major road, also heading West. Everything's tracking the river, but we're actually a fair way South of it - Riglan doesn't even remember seeing these roads when we cloud-flew this way before, because we were very focused on the river and its banks.

Nethza points out that it's sad to see fields destroyed - but when the fully army arrives, this will be - in her words - "churned wasteland".

Riglan takes a risk; he's got a good idea of the roads ahead for a while, so now asks the owl to fly all the way back East to see where the army's got to, spin around, catch us up again and report. That'll take it a few hours. But the owl reports that it really can't see well in daylight. At this, Riglan thanks it sincerely, says it's done an amazing job and it's time to return to the Fey and safety - and dismisses it. He swaps it out for a hawk - it can soar away. It leaves at around 6am.

### +5h 30m

It's 6:30am.

D20->3. By about 7am, the hawk comes back - but it's getting in contact at maximum range, as soon as it can, because as it flew back it noticed strange wolf-like creatures running our way, cutting through the fields and moving very quickly. **Eight of them**. The main army, it says, is only about an hour behind us, a trail of destruction in its wake. Riglan figured something like that given the hawk got back so quickly.

Riglan calls out a warning to those who are awake; "Inbound wolves of some kind, eight of them, fast. Get ready!"

Temo jumps up onto the carpet and asks Nethza to gain altitude a bit for a better look. She brings it 30ft up. He has a good view. He can see eight shapes flattening crops in a wheat field, weaving a little, inbound. They are indeed at full sprint. 100ft away; he aims and fires at one straight away. They're at a long range, and half covered, but his sharp-shooting abilities get past it all. Hits it, 38 damage. Still up! Temo calls, "They're fast and they're tough!". Nethza goes for another with eldritch blasts; crit (16 damage), hit (7 damage) and a miss.

Riglan calls back to Lesther to see if he's got enough spells; Lesther is happy to take the cart. Riglan gets to the back of the cart to see if he can get any lined up for lightning, but no luck; in fact they're moving to flank us either side. Instead, given Temo's warning, he casts L5 conjure, hoping for something that can fly to keep pace with the creatures, but failing that, maybe at least intercept. Selecting randomly from cards offered by DM - giant wasps! 8 of them. He drops in the bear totem for 20 temp HP for all.

He calls them to attack one each. Six get their stings in. Damage is variable, but *none* seem to have any effect from poison. He shouts out, "Undead! Immune to poison. Anyone have radiant?!"

Four of them (by DM rolls determining choice) stop to attack the wasps. Four keep coming.

Temo aims and fires at another one that's uninjured. He takes the -5 / +10 risk, which pays off; hits for 53 damage. Nethza goes for the same one, hitting for 9 and 12 damage; that's down. Three left.

Riglan aims lighting at another one. Hits, 27 damage. It had previous injuries; goes down. He tells the wasps to pair up; so now four wasps on two wolves that still head for us. Overall, four hits across the group. The ones that fell behind are fully engaged with the wasps and clearly winning, but they're delayed. Riglan sees nasty signs of disease - necrosis - calls that out to warn people too, in case they have any defences.

Nethza swings the carpet to the other side of the wagon as Temo picks another nearby target, hits, 39 damage (no -5/+10 on this one, I forgot!). Nethza gets another two hits, 18 damage total. Riglan shoots lightning at that same one, hoping to take it out; it dodges some of the 31 damage, taking 15, but that's enough. 3 down, *five* still to go. Wasps again. Six hits across five remaining wolves, one is crit (for 9 damage).

Temo aims for the remaining nearby wolf. Crit! 79 total. Boom. Gone!

The remaining wasps now swarm the wolves at the back row of wolves. It's enough; with their flight and teaming up, they divide and conquer. Most are killed, but the wolves go down too. None left.

### +6h 30m

7:30am. Maireagh awakes up, almost refreshed! She gets on watch to keep resting for another hour or two. We keep quiet for Isteval. Riglan relieves Lesther on the cart, and asks if Lesther wants to at least give it a try and rest up? He says he'll do that when Isteval awakens.

D20->7.

By about 8am, it kicks in - Temo, Riglan, Nethza and Lesther have been up for a solid 24 hours. Maireagh is able to use the steadiness of the carpet to brew mastica! Stops us nodding off. Exhaustion con checks, house rule though - Isteval wakes up at that time and we waive the half hour of extra resting for long-rest. We get the aura benefit.

* Riglan 3+4+7->14 (exhaustion DC is 10)
* Nethza 1+4+5->10 (scrapes it, despite nat 1!)
* Temo 19+2+5->26 
* Lesther is exhausted. It's not surprising.

The hawk cycles back. The vanguard is being whittled down, it reports; and we realise that they're not calling forward anything from the army, they're actually sending things out of their own ranks. Riglan insight 23. He senses a certain cadence to their actions; they're pacing themselves, but also pushing themselves, trying to harry us whenever we're looking at all comfortable. They're trying to keep us unbalanced.

Riglan asks the hawk to fly over and tries to get a feel for the number remaining. Hawk adv perception 14+2->16, there are still about 60 left. We're not turning around to fight them yet!

Isteval will require a good while more to just relax. He smells the mastica pretty quickly, and an exhausted Lesther curls upon the flying carpet, following Isteval's lead and covering himself with his cloak.

### +7h 30m

D20->18.

The sun is up enough to be on the road now. The daylight seems to be bothering the vanguard - they don't like this bright morning sun. They move into tall grass and crops, apparently in search of a little shade. It doesn't slow them much though.

The horse is nearly out of steam and we need to swap in Isteval's steed soon. But we have to keep a particularly sharp eye out as this would be a bad time for an attack. Isteval isn't ready to start his meditation, though, so we need to push the horse a bit further; Temo acro 18, more apples, con save - 4+1+5 from aura, *just* enough to avoid exhaustion. We put off the changeover for one more hour. Riglan casts Speak With Animals one more time to tell the horse what's going on and prepare it for the changeover in an hour. This rallies it and it breaks into a canter! He advises it to bolt South-West across the fields; he thinks the vanguard will focus on us. He wishes it well, finding himself surprisingly emotional. Amazing creature.

At a bit before 9:30am, Isteval starts his ritual to call his steed.

### +8h 30m

First thing:

Marieagh is fully awake and tinkers with the invisibility eye to restore its full charge power. The dog is fully repaired and Maireagh gives it invisibility sight again. Riglan's staff and lightning wand are both recharged by the dawn of a new day. Isteval calls a warning just before his steed appears. Temo drinks the potion of hill giant strength and casts L2 Fog Cloud on the back of the wagon; we pull away from it quickly, but it's a big 40ft cloud which hides Isteval's horse as it appears in front of the wagon. It's very decorated! A white stallion. Full barding, blinkers, armoured headpiece, plumed feather. The other horse is giving it serious side-eye but Riglan did warn it of this.

Temo gets over and tries to move the harness off the draft horse. Athl 11+6 from the potion; that's enough; acrobatics, 21, he's very nimble and keeps balance. We have to drop down a fair bit in speed but the changeover is swift.

The other horse looks back for a moment, making eye contact with Riglan, bends its knee a bit; "a safe life", it is saying. It gallops off into the fields.

We're done! It worked! Isteval takes over the wagon. "I believe it is your turn to get some shut-eye?" he says to Riglan.

D20->7. Nothing untoward; the fog cloud caused confusion, instead of provoking attacks.

(END OF PART 3.18 - Part 3.19 next)
