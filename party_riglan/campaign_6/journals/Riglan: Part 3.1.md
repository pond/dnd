# Riglan: Part 3.1

Over 1d6->3 months that follow after their adventures:

* A healthy 161pp (d100 for each month) is earned, *after* upkeep costs for Old Owlbear Tower, from dividends at Wave Echo Cave. We also get one refined ingot of Etherium. Gundren claims to have had "odd types asking" about Etherium and isn't comfortable with that, so anything mined that's spare ends up being turned into ingots and handed onto Maireagh really just because she's kind of "under the radar".

* Nethza opens a sort of dance school in town - really, it's a place for lost people to be found; "**The School For Lost Girls**". After some convincing, some weeks in, she elects to make it a larger academy because we're offered use of Deepgarden Keep since it is better to have it occupied than empty.

* Temo spends much time in town with Qelline and carp, but has an idea of a fledgling magic school for people like himself who don't fit into the "formal" magic education mould. So he sets up alongside Nethza, with his school called "**The People's College Of Magic**". He and Nethza "commute" by pony and horse if they have to, but otherwise, Riglan's giant owl totem can carry them both if they're headed for 2 days or more (so they can get back), or Riglan can become a giant eagle to take them there, then leave them token for the giant owl to get back quickly if need be.

* The two schools cost a fair bit. In total, the setup costs come to around 9000gp (900pp), which is hefty but we figure we can afford it and it's well worth it. The Lords Alliance, through Yartar, are offering half of the Deepgarden Keep restoration costs but much of our cost is in paying for the rest of it. The mayor wasn't being stupid when he convinced us to take the building! It's a big cost off the town's books.

* Maireagh spends much time in study at Old Owlbear Tower. There is tremendous history here. She looks through seemingly endless unearthed books/tomes and old treasures, found around the grounds. Her idea of an archeology school or at least an open centre of history is a strong one but she's in no rush and doesn't want to distract from Nethza and Temo's efforts in town, so her and Riglan just work on developing their knowledge and ideas for now. She suggests that Riglan tree-portals to Reidoth at Thundergrove Bastion to help Reidoth with ongoing undead issues. So over many days, he does so, helping Reidoth regrow forest over the old town; they think about repopulating the town, but both are druids and both decide that people don't need spreading out any further! In consultation with Maireagh, we avoid the main hall with the now-moved strange obelisk outside, keeping that clear for further investigation. The obelisk remains a mystery.

* Early on, Riglan plants the acorn from Turlang at Shadowtop Cathedral, in a special space at Old Owlbear Tower. Thereafter, when not at Thundergrove, Riglan concentrates on the gardens and "model" farm to help prove his ideas of non-destructive, mixed crop, high yield farming, forest cultivation basically, after all the things he's seen, especially at Goldenfields. He starts a nursery with the seeds he got from there and in time enlists local help from Deepgarden Keep to move excess food and send it into town - free, just like at Goldenfields. He also sometimes portals to Sungift, to get to know the farmers there better and in time to start making subtle suggestions to try and steer them towards farming that doesn't need more forest destruction; persuasion is only 8 though (what a start, rolls nat 5+3!) so they're sadly unconvinced.

We pick things up as Riglan rather clumsily tries to help the farmers.


## Riglan - Day 1 (Sungift)

The local priestess of Chauntea however, who Riglan met the very first time he came into town, sees a conversation. "Good to see you back! Looks like you've done some travelling. You seem set on a mission... But these frontier farmers, you know, they have their ways of doing things. They don't disturb the status quo - the way their fathers and grandfathers did, because it worked and they see no reason to change. Have you met other Chaunteas along the way?"

Riglan says, "Ah yes, an abbot at Goldenfields."

"Well I might be causing work for myself, but I like what you're talking about and I've seen some of these ideas work. What's say we collaborate? I don't expect you to worship Chauntea, but I know you believe in her because you do her work. This abbot of yours - would you..." - and she gives him some letters and some kind of scroll - "...I've been posted here for a number of years and I don't get much external support. Goldenfields is a long way away, but this abbot of whom you speak sounds influential and wise..." (Riglan nods) "...if by any chance you're headed that far away to see this abbot friend of yours, would you talk to him and give him these letters from me? I would value his support for the work I'm doing here. In return we could work together to spread these ideas through the church. You see, all these farmers worship here in Chauntea's temple to guarantee their harvest."

Riglan is excited about it. He thanks her and says certainly. He lets her know that he has some modest fast-travel abilities and can, once a day, jump between places he knows so he can get to Goldenfields easily (but he's advised to keep that quiet).

So Riglan camps outside Sungift; he spends some time asking a bird (adv persuasion - CHA check - 21) to take a message tied to its leg to Maireagh at Old Owlbear Tower so that she doesn't worry. He gives it a few worms and insects for its trouble. The very next day, he portals via tree direct to Goldenfields.


## Riglan - Day 2 (Sungift -> Goldenfields)

It's quite exhilarating to be able to do it! He's suddenly back at this amazing place which he's not revisited since last here, but it's *so easy* to just *be* here. Very cool. He's near the raised area, the clearing, by the shared huts/accommodation.

A slow voice. "Huhhhrooo?" - bending down, a very old Treant. The oldest living thing here. Riglan recognises **Lifferlas**. "Ah! Good to see you again Lifferlas!" "You too Riglaaaaan. Seeker of leeeeaves. What has brought yoooo here, that you would appear next to my tree wife?"

Riglan explains he's here for the abbot and Emerald Enclave member, Ellardin Darovik (and hopes it wasn't rude to use the nearby tree to portal - apparently not!)

"You are looking for Ellardin?" "Yes please!" "Come with me. I'll take you there!" - he lumbers away. The steps are slow but they're, bug so he moves fast. Various people greet Lifferlas as he passes. We pass the monk Ziliang; she spots Riglan and looks surprised; says something to Father Darovik; he turns and waves. They come down from the Hill of the Abbey.

"Good wintersday to you!" "Good wintersday. I come bearing messages." "But before - are you in a rush?" "No..." "Will you do morning rites with me?" "Certainly!" and we go back up to the Hill. A ritual has been started here, a few bowls, some people gathered; Riglan, perception a whopping 27; the abbot is doing things that look a bit like prayers, but he's actually casting a druidic spell (Control Weather). It's interesting that it's being passed off as a prayer when it's actually nature magic! Riglan does bits of minor Druidcraft magic to try and support the whole affair visually.

The Abbot asks for "healthy winter rains to replenish the soil, cold snaps to put the bulbs to sleep and let the vines slumber, and to bring the first of the mushrooms" - and so-on. Then suddenly Riglan feels wet, hot breath on the back of his neck; a wet nose and breath rummaging near his hand where his food bag is. It's **Darlow** and **Tilbee**, the two black bears that were rescued from poaches many years ago and wonder around, living in the Abbey ever since. Riglan finds something for them to eat as a treat.

Once this is all the done, Riglan walks with the Abbot as he does his "rounds". He explains about Sungift and the priestess; the Abbot is a little surprised - "quite forward-thinking for a priestess!". Riglan learns that there had been further giant attacks, but they eventually just stopped; Ziliang wasn't responsible, though she was hot on the trail of *something*; it seems someone else might've solved the problem? The walls are being repaired.

The abbot asks about Riglan's plans for farming & he explains - it's based on Goldenfields ideas after all. The abbot reminds him that many of the seeds he has already got will be useful - vines and thickets - for showing how things can grow *alongside* existing forest, so if the farmers still feel like they need more space, they don't need to cut down trees to do it. They can work within it.

"Now. I mean to ask you... Have you considered what the effects of what you are doing are? And how you will maintain that balance? If you bring too much productivity and prosperity to farmers, the systems they rely on - the commerce and economics that generate unfettered wealth, or rapid growth of wealth in a community - can lead to unexpected consequences. I'm not advocating having a stranglehold on their economic wellbeing! But if they were to suddenly become hugely prosperous in just a few years, it can lead to massive expansion. One of our early experiments led to large *growth* of the cities we were retrying to help contain. The cycle - the *tumour* that is growth of civilisation - continued unabated. I know your heart is in the right place, as are all of ours; we seek to maintain the balance. You are a Summer Strider -" (he points at Riglan's pin) "- so I know you've seen enough of the world and civilisations to know of the nature of people. What is your feeling?"

We kick around ideas. In the end, it looks like maybe using the church - if we trust the priestess enough - to channel money through the church as a tithe, which is paid back into the town - repairing roads, houses and so-on. Riglan lives long enough that hopefully he could see this become in essence, a habit. Like the farmers, the church by generation after generation knows that this "just works" and doesn't want to break it. Further, trying to suddenly expand - especially by destroying more forest - would break the very ecosystem upon which they depend; so tie that into religion; the idea of plenty, but without greed.

The abbot takes the letters etc. from the priestess and on briefly flicking through them seems struck by an idea; he'll get back to Riglan later in the day. Riglan is free to wander! He goes places he's not seen before and speaks to all manner of people. He learns that the Knights of Samilar, over in Summit Hall, are doing fine - doing what they do - and that the dwarves at Riverguard Keep now "formally" run an inn for travellers on the river. Things there look good. It's interest to spend time observing the farming methods again and spotting things that Riglan didn't notice the first time around; also, it's winter, so it's a very different time to be making observations.

Eventually, Riglan catches up with the abbot again. He has an idea of sending a Ranger with Riglan, to help set up a shrine to one of the nature gods like Mielikki - so she and Chauntea can provide balance for each other; one side should not be able to become more dominant. It helps teach about balance. Great idea! The abbot also can use this as a way of getting one of the younger rangers out, who wants to be able get out and see forests and be doing work outside Goldenfields.

And so, Riglan is introduced to a young female halfling ranger called **Tabatha**. Riglan greets her enthusiastically.

She is apparently one of the last few of a particular tribe of halflings, The Ghost Forest Halflings, that usually hide from people, living near woods rather than being very 'urban'. Her and her brother are the only two survivors from their tribe, after a terrible fire started by people outside the forest during a skirmish.

The abbot has a letter that might help too - a Commission from the Abbot - i.e. instructions to the priestess to try and make things formal, give official blessing and so-on and tie in the ranger. The letter he's written also has a response to the other things she was asking about; he thinks Riglan is right to trust her, but she's ambitious and wants to see change. A bit idealistic, which is fine, but requires some tempering with caution!

It gets dark early - around 5pm. People gather in the meeting halls in larger numbers for warmth compared to Riglan's last visit; solid "wintery food" is served, with barley and sago, grown on trees. There is much talk and song, some music is played - alright quality! - and a drumming circle; Riglan joins in with his horn, does terribly (performance total 7!) but it doesn't matter as everyone else is terrible too, ha! It's just a lot of fun and a nice atmosphere.

Tabatha is full of questions about the north. Riglan does his best to answer!

People head to bed early, Riglan and Tabatha too.

## Riglan - Day 3 (Goldenfields -> Sungift)

Riglan and Tabatha reach Sungift. Introductions all around; the proposal is given; the priestess is surprisingly eager. It worries Riglan a bit - Insight 18 - he asks if she's worried about some of the things that the Abbot raised, or that there's another God being represented.

She assures him that she's happy the financial balance will be maintained this way; that she now has some support via the abbot and she even confesses to having felt a weight of responsibility for having been the *only* place of faith for the whole town. A second religious opinion could be very useful - Chauntea's methods don't hold the answers for *all* things, so Mielikki offers other insights. It makes sense to have a wild god of the forest represented too, since Sungift views itself as on the frontier - next to the great woods, then the mountains.

It's agreed and the day is spent by Riglan casting Plant Growth on the edge of the town, to help establish the grove around the shrine - but it covers most of the farmland of Sungift too. Goldenfields seeds are given out to farmers for experimentation and the Mielikki shrine is set up. The richness of the land near the town - with a border between that and the forest - hopefully will encourage the farmers to focus on the existing farmland instead of pushing out into the "less successful" cleared areas near the forest.

On completion of the spell, everything looks and *smells* healthy. Some plants start to push through almost immediately, despite it being winter! This at least gets some of the farmers on side, but there does have to be some teaching about putting light muslin-covered frames over rows of plants that they don't want to freeze, digging furrows to protect areas from cold winds and so-on. Riglan manages to get some buy-in on plating trees - acorns, and so-on - to help create windbreaks and create some diversity.

In the evening, everyone in the town comes together. There's a sort of village celebration, toasting and a good happy vibe. Some 20 villagers along with the three of us. We're just happy that they're seeing value in the local land without destroying more forest, and seeing some value out of a practical demonstration. The truth is, though, a season away, since the growth spell is only a kickstart - it gets them through winter, but the next bit is on their shoulders.

Eventually, people head to bed.



# Temo
## Temo - late autumn day 1 (Deepgarden Keep)

Temo has been "commuting" with Nethza between Old Owlbear Tower and Deepgarden Keep regularly, as they develop their school ideas and his relationship with Qelline and Carp grows ever deeper. There's a deep satisfaction and calm to working on the little orchard, but he always looks forward to those warm autumn, then winter evenings at the Keep with Maireagh and the others, a big pot of stew and many new tales to tell, or old stories to relive.

Heart-to-hearts by the campfire are something of a staple of adventuring travel, but it strikes Temo within a few weeks how the group got to know each other within a particular context; that of adversity. In these times of calm, they learn new things about each other, as new aspects of personalities have a chance to flourish. Temo finds himself with a deeper, broader appreciation and love of Nethza - a truly caring, ambitious individual who Temo ultimately looks up to. While his own school of magic will never have quite the impact on individuals as Nethza's, which for the right person could quite literally save lives, it's still a matter of pride for him that he can offer help to those who find themselves with magic powers outside the domain of traditional education. There's no shortage of interest, either.

The schools are costly, but everyone agrees it is money well spent. For Temo, he is able to once again lean into his beliefs that wealth should be shared - but instead of *taking* from the rich to give to those in need, with all the legal difficulties that presents, here is an entirely legal and up-standing outlet! Not only is the school itself there to help, but restoring Deepgarden Keep helps the local town, though it doesn't necessarily need any help now that Wave Echo Cave is in full production. A veritable renaissance is underway.

Maireagh buries herself in the Tower's studies with the dog by her side in case of trouble, while he and Nethza travel together, but he always worries a bit about Riglan whenever he's off on his own. And he has to admit that he misses something of the old days - the two of them goofing around, or just being headstrong and rushing into danger with a laugh, a cause, and a belief in the group that we'll all get out OK somehow. Qelline is well aware that the adventurer's spark is still alight within Temo, but for now, it is a time of peace. All is well.

We set the scene...

It's a slightly cloudy morning above Deepgarden Keep. It might be a nice day if the cloud blows away. The sun is up at any rate, above the planes and mountains to the East. It's visible under the cloud layer behind the big apple tree in the middle of the field.

Temo didn't sleep so well. A hand touches him on his shoulder - "You didn't sleep much, did you" - Qelline, by his side in the bed in the little cottage. BOING! Someone jumps onto him. "It's today! Today's the day!" repeats Carp. "You said you'd bring me!" - he seems very excited. "Now remember. It's a school for *big* kids. Promise you'll behave," answers Qelline. Carp's wearing special clothes that Qelline gave him - "proper" looking, mended - though he's not done a great job of dressing himself!

There's an unexpected knock at the door. "Coming!" shouts Qelline, donning a robe. Nethza's voice at the door, and another; "Is he anxious?" - that's Riglan. A gruff voice, further. "He'll be fine! He's just putting it on. Just doing it for the attention, aren't you! I know you can hear us, get up, it's the big day!" - Maireagh.

The first day the schools both open!

Temo hurries to get dressed, tidying up Carp's attire as he goes. Maireagh's brought food; everyone stayed in town last night. "Thank you!" says Temo. We eat quickly. As we make our way to the school, people in town greet him. It feels like the whole town knows that it's opening day! We detour via the bakery lane; Nethza organised a few boxes of baked goods for the big opening from bakery **Halfling'd But Fully Baked**. "I'll come with you!" says one of the halflings. "My daughter and I will bring these on a cart. We want to see it! Starts at 8:30, doesn't it!"

Our old friend Sildar Hallwinter, representative here of the Lord's Alliance and acting sort-of-mayor, greets us along the way. He has a couple of City Guard with him. We seem to be gathering people as the spectacle gets larger! We end up in a small procession of sorts.

It's only 7:45am when we get to Deepgarden Keep. It's a hive of activity - people "on payroll" putting up bunting in a courtyard at the front, lighting, information displays both about the schools and the keep itself, flags flying over the parapets with the two school crests (designed locally). Nethza's is a raven against a full moon on a blue background. Temo's is a gold wand at an angle, surrounded above and below by a few silver stars of various sizes, against a bright red background.

A banner across the main entrance reads, "Welcome Students!". Various chairs are placed down the centre of the courtyard, with a long table to either side. The halfling father and daughter ask where the food should go - we choose one table for the food and put display material and various hand-written "brochures" on another.

A school administrator, who's been put in charge of the school admissions and finances, is joined by a housemaster who looks after the students. The **schoolmaster** is a human woman, mid 30s maybe (we never asked), quite relaxed overall but with a kind of hard edge that suggests not trying to fool around too much; shoulder-length straight brown hair, black trousers, white shirt and red overcoat. **Rebetha Castille**. The **housemaster** is an older Dwarven male, black hair and bushy black eyebrows, but a big red beard, fierce look - looks a bit scary, quite tall for a dwarf too - but the personality is the opposite of Maireagh; he's actually affable and very casual, at least, when he's dealing with adults. **Klaus Guerin**. Dressed all in black with a deep blue cape.

Apparently Temo is doing a welcome speech, given he's a performer. He feels some nerves given the personal connections here and if the room's full, it's a bigger crowd than he's used to but it'll be fine - he's a performer at heart.

We're going to be shown around to see finishing touches and approve anything that needs approving; and we'll meet the students - apparently, also all nerves! - before things kick off. Netzha goes with Rebetha, Temo goes with Klaus, Maireagh says she'll check on security and Riglan comes with Temo to make sure that the dorms that he and Klaus are viewing have enough headroom for "taller folk"!

Riglan is surprised at the scale of it all. There are junior and senior dorms, with capacity for more students than he expected. Boy/girl splits give four rooms in total. About eight single beds in each, so some 30+ students but room for more if there was the need, both by squeezing in another bed or two, or by moving to bunk beds.

We head down to the main dining, assembly and meeting hall - multipurpose. Here there are two long tables for students with a shorter one perpendicular at the head of the room. There's a roomy kitchen off to one side and a store room for cleaning kit and miscellany to the other.

The keep is big. There's space for a games room; a two-storey room that serves as a library; some outdoor courtyard/garden areas; but the main keep and tunnels below are separated off from the school for safety. Locked doors. The students can always find their way in by other means, but at least school is - in theory! - safe.

We end up meeting Nethza and Rebetha at the library, which is sort of central with a dorm wing we'd been in and a classroom wing that they'd been in. Thumbs-up all round.

OK, so, over to registration - set up temporarily by the stables - to meet students. There are representatives from a couple of orphanages, the Harpers, a couple of innkeepers - people who noticed talented youths, lacking opportunity. Even a priest of Ilmata. 14 juniors in our first intake - 4 are there for magic, 6 for dance, and the remaining four aren't actually sure. So they might float between classes. The youngest is 14, the oldest 17, by human equivalent - they're mostly human at the moment, except for one halfling, a half-elf and one maybe-half-orc. Nethza suspects one might be a tiefling before the horns express, perhaps.

We meet them and try to put them at ease. Don't be scared by all the opening day pomp and circumstance! The priest and Harp,er also reassure some of their nervous kids that they'll be sticking around.

Once registration is completed, the first row-and-a-bit of chairs in the courtyard - four rows of ten, with a space down the middle splitting them 5-5 - has the students present, then Qelline and Carp are towards the back, Maireagh and Riglan are standing, some of the people who came with the students fill in behind them near the front and other townsfolk fill in behind.

We found two dedicated teachers, one for each 'side' of the school. There's a house*keeper* too, the fifth member of staff, who looks after pastoral care and cooking. Cleaning is a group effort with students involved.

Sildar kicks things off. "WELCOME!" he shouts and the room goes quiet. "Welcome to both the residents and citizens of Deepgarden Keep and to our newest, youngest arrivals here!" - and on he goes, waxing lyrical about the school, restoration of the keep and so-on. Eventually, he hands over to Temo.

Temo gives a little speech, thanking his friends and especially Netzha for the whole school idea's genesis, along with the people of Deepgarden Keep. Performance adv 26 - goes down a storm.

Sildar picks back up, perhaps overdoes the history a bit and some of the kids are looking a bit bored! But fortunately, he wraps up before it gets too far off track. He introduces the school faculty; then to finish the ceremony, he invites Nethza to the podium. Nethza just wraps up - thanks people, summarises it being about giving people a fair chance. "Please spread the news far and wide - this is a School For Lost Girls, we don't care where you've come from, we welcome you and provide you with an education. I understand there is a lovely spread of food to your left from **Halfling'd But Fully Baked** - a local bakery that we love." Then she welcomes the students, reminds the townsfolk about a forthcoming school open day and wraps up.

Temo is happy, but also suddenly rather nervous as the *reality* and responsibility of it all kicks in. It's real now. He checks in with Nethza - she's delighted.

We check with the students. They've been shown to dorms and spread out across all four rooms to give them some space. Maireagh rocks up; "It's a good library! Went in and looked at some of the books. We could probably collect more books on our journeys now and add to it." "Good idea. The dangerous or delicate stuff could stay at the Tower, but yeah, other things could come here. We were chatting and thought we might open it to the townsfolk, so long as it doesn't disturb the students - on weekends maybe."

By around 10:30, things are winding down naturally. The students are due to start their first day of orientation, meeting the teachers, told what they'll be learning, shown the library and so-on. Temo and Nethza hang around to be seen and to make sure they're up to speed on all of that as well. We've run through it before, but it's good for the students to see us. Maireagh and Riglan hang out in the courtyard, giving us space.

At lunchtime, the students head off to the dining hall. Everyone joins them for lunch. We tell tall tales - with scary things omitted! - about how we met and how we made our fortune. Some kids are quiet, a bit nervous, of course, but many are very engaged. The maybe-Tiefling is quite loud, perhaps a bit pushy. Nethza recognises the defence mechanism. The half-orc surprisingly is quiet too.

At one point, Temo tries to get a conversation with the half-orc - **Lomas**. Asks if he's feeling OK. "I'm... I'm very grateful sir..." - he and Temo start to chat. The kid's dad was a half-orc, and him and his mother were kind of pagan-like. In touch with animals. Riglan is called over and as the kid talks, he gets quite sad; all three feel it. Riglan arcana only 11 notices it's not his kind of magic, but it *is* magic. Temo arcana 22 notices that it's innate magic; not wizardry or divine; some kind of unusual sorcerer, perhaps, or perhaps some bardic abilities related to his feelings. Either way it's tied to emotion. He manifests emotion magically. Temo talks to him about that and the kid gets a bit more hopeful that he might be able to understand and control this one day - and interestingly, the whole *room* seems to lift. So the range is quite big!

After a while the arcane teacher takes up the conversation and Temo and Riglan are freed up. Nethza is talking to the Tiefling girl, who Nethza later tells him is called **Prickles**! She seems to be relaxing and opening up, and before long, she's talking to other students. Very much a street child.

Temo spends a bit of time with the Halfling student too. They're somewhere in the middle - mostly listening, but talking a bit too, inconspicuous. Carp comes along too, introducing himself; the kid in turn says he's **Merth** (short for **Mertholomew**). He's a sort of "lost boy", rather than being magical. He's interested in writing, stories, many ideas - came here all by himself, deciding he wanted to come and got signed up.

The students, after a rather intense morning, will mostly have the afternoon off to settle in, decorate rooms if they wish and so-on; Rebetha will show them around town too, so they know the lie of the land. Tomorrow will be the first full day of classes. We're told we don't need to stick around; they've got it all under control!

The four of us head off. Temo confesses that he'd quite like to see the first day of classes, so it doesn't feel quite so much like we helicoptered in then fucked off, but after that he definitely trusts the teachers.

So, we stay over at Qelline's again...



## Temo - late autumn day 2 (Deepgarden Keep)

...then just kind of hang out as observers to get a feel for what the students are doing. We can actually *help* usefully which is nice, because at this early stage of figuring out what the students need, they require a lot of attention. Almost one adult per two students. We get to know them well.

By about 3pm they're tired & the school day ends. We thank the staff profusely and, since the staff assure us that things are on track now, we figure we'll head away to the Tower for a while (for Riglan and Maireagh's sake) and come back in a day or three.

Temo has the usual goodbyes for Qelline and Carp. Feels weird, being split between two places like this.

Back at the Owlbear Tower, Riglan says he's really impressed and quite likes the two students he was dealing with. It's funny how getting to know them makes you more invested in the whole concept. "Quite a responsibility for a young halfling!" "Perhaps, but the staff know what they're doing - my adventuring days aren't over yet!" and launches into an impromptu on-table song about "our adventuring days are ahead of us!" much to Maireagh's annoyance ("Dirty feet!" she cries, but we use cleaning stone after of course). Performance 18, so it's a pretty fun time.



## Temo - fast forwarding to align with Riglan, day 1

Riglan's headed off to Sungift, so that tends to be the cue for Temo and Nethza to get into Deepgarden Keep. They expect to be there for a couple of days or more so use the giant owl totem, allowing Riglan to tree-portal to Sungift straight away. By midday, the two land at the Keep.

Nethza goes to the school and Temo heads to Qelline's, securing a space in the cottage for Nethza for the next day or two. They hang out for a bit, but Temo also spends time at the school - like Nethza, he likes spending time there, and with Qelline in the evenings.



## Temo - day 2

More of the same; helps on the farm in the mornings, then gets to the school in at midday and joins in for the afternoon. The evening of the second day is spent at the cottage with Qelline, Carp and Nethza. It's an idyllic life. Temo is very aware of his blessings and very grateful for them.



## Temo - day 3

On day 3, Carp is put to bed; Qelline heads outside. "I just want to see if Nethza wants any food" as she didn't join us. She goes and checks. "Huh. She's not there. Shall we stay up and wait until she gets back?" It gets late. By about 10pm, we're getting concerned. "That's odd. She's never not come home before."

Temo says he'll go and check at the school. Takes about 20 minutes to get there. The doors of course are shut, but he knows which doors to knock on. Clomping sounds, rattling of locks; Temo perception 13. Klaus is there, two students behind. Klaus looks flustered. "Oh. Master Temo! Please. Come in." Temo comes in - "what's wrong?" - one of the students has been crying, he sees. "You must be here about Nethza... You'd better come with me."

He takes Temo through the halls - we see students peering around door edges, whispering. We get to the activity room. Beyond that room is the courtyard garden. Temo, wisdom saving - with Luck point - 17. Deep sadness and fear; that's Lomas; Temo says, "Oh! Lomas is scared. And sad!" "Yes!" says Klaus. He asks the children to keep back, or they'll be affected by it. Rebetha is there, wearing a necklace which Temo surmises protects her against the effects somehow. "Thank goodness you're here!" she says. "Lomas found it... He's beside himself... We can't break him out of it..." - and she leads us into the garden. Walking through the activity room to get there - Arcana 19+4->23 - Temo immediately sees things are badly wrong. Purple-black outlines, like cracks almost, running like an overlay over, well, everything. He touches one; it's not cracked, just stone, but it's like a - well, visual effect. It seems to be spreading, *seeping* into the room from somewhere outside. Rebetha speeds up, seeing this and opens the door to the courtyard.

Standing there, power radiating off him - wisdom saving with advantage, 20 - Lomas is there, shoulders slumped forwards, clearly has been crying, gripping himself in a balled up position, staring at a corner of the garden. There's a tree and a few bushes there usually - but instead there's - well, a **rip - a tear in reality itself** - a dark shadow spreads from it. That's where these strange 'visual effect' lines come from.

"Shit", says Temo, out loud.

Detect Magic. Very strongly magical, unsurprisingly. It *is* a tear in reality. It emanates very strong transmutation magic and a particular kind of "feel" that he's only ever heard about in stories. **Shadowfell**. Lomas is in shock. Temo tries to talk him off the ledge - calming, one step at a time, don't look at the rift... He keeps saying he "couldn't stop it" and saying "...but miss Nethza..." - persuasion 30.

We get Lomas inside. Klaus outside is weaving something - abjuration, Temo sees, Detect Magic still up. He's trying to contain the spread. Whatever the spell might be, it is pulling some of the lines back from the classroom. He calls thanks to Klaus. "I don't know how far I can go with this. I don't want to close it, but I don't want it to spread further."

Rebetha asks a student to put on the kettle and grab cookies, to meet us all in the main hall. She reassures the students, and gives the older ones the task of looking after the younger - keeping them busy. It works well.

Temo assures Lomas that he's not in trouble, not at all. But he needs to be brave now - channel that Orc blood! - and tell us what happened. Rage briefly flares, but then we feel him grow more detached; he's steeling himself. And then, to Temo's surprised, he feels guilt.

* Girls were gathered outside telling scary stories with Netzha
* Lomas went outside to listen - he says "I know I shouldn't have as it's for the girls but I wanted to know what they talk about..."
* He was against the window in the activity room listening
* Nethza started telling stories about what she'd seen before
* Netzha was asked various questions and went into more detail about how she can see this shadow creature in her mind sometimes - her **patron**
* As he listened more, Lomas became more scared; he started to see a mist/veil around him - was *he* doing that, or was it the story?
* But then everyone outside started getting frightened too
* **He's sure he saw a shadow** move *through* the room to outside; heard the girls scream
* He started to head out, but the girls came running indoors, faces as white as ash
* Lomas tells us the names and Klaus is able to fetch the girls to ask them more, *not* in trouble, we just need as much detail of what they saw as possible
* Lomas ran out - Nethza transfixed, as if in a trance; but she was focused on a shadow that had appeared
* This strange shadow walked *through* her, then the tear appeared - just between bushes against the wall - and he saw *hands* he thinks, reaching out, grabbing Nethza and pulling her into the hole
* Horrible faces and screams in his mind which he can't explain - very frightening

The two girls fill in more. Huge creeping shadows spreading across the window and door, despite it being dark outside - shadows of shadows. Monstrously scary! When the door opened, they just freaked out and ran not knowing it was Lomas. They say they ran and it was over half an hour ago; yet Lomas thinks the shadow arrived right before Temo came in. So someone lost time (was Lomas stunned?), or perhaps being close to the rift slows time.

Temo starts talking about the Fey Wild and the "flip side of the coin", the Shadowfell. Then he hears a creaking noise by the door - creeps up and opens them - it's *all* the students. So Temo says, "OK, OK, everyone in" and explains what happened in brief (to avoid rumours) framing it as "Nethza was visited by a strange shadow creature, and she went with it through that door to the Shadowfell". The usual reassurances - school not closing, but that area's off limits etc.

In the end, people head back to bed. Lomas is assured by Temo that he's done OK, he held his emotions in check and explained everything; nothing more he could do!

Wards are put on the room; Temo's given the password and Rebetha gives him a key to get back inside should we need it. We'll have to gather together and - well, probably - go through the rift! He bids farewell to Rebetha and heads out.

At first he walks, but then breaks into a run and sprints back to Qelline's. He fills her in - quietly, so as not to wake Carp - and apologises, because he knows she's afraid of what can happen if he goes adventuring, but hopes she understands - this is a friend. Of course she does; "I went into this eyes open! I know this life. The only thing - that I can't control - is, well, you've become very important to Carp. And... I need you to come back." Temo replies, "You're both important to me to and you give me all the reason I could ever need to make sure that I do. And don't forget who I'll be going with - they're a very capable group. I'll get back as soon as I can."

The owl token has recharged and though it's the dead of night, it's an owl. Temo hugs Qelline, kisses her, pauses for a moment just looking at her, then gives her what he hope is a reassuring smile and heads outside; uses the owl token and flies directly back towards Owlbear Tower. On the way, he sends a paper bird to Riglan - **"Return to Owlbear Tower at once. Nethza is in trouble."** Temo hopes it's legible. It's hard to write when your vision is blurred by tears.


## Temo - Day 4
### 2am

Temo reaches Owlbear Tower a little after 2am. It's a surprise; even in flight, it should've surely been a 3-4 hour journey... He's full of self-doubt, blame; was he just pretending, setting up that school? He was so useless there; thank goodness for Klaus! But he has pushed all that aside and found a resolve within himself to be strong and gather his party quickly. He's had time to think about the paper bird - as best he can recall, it was about 3-4 days in total to get from Sungift to Deepgarden Keep, but that was by road, the days weren't always a full day of solid travel and they walked slowly back then! He figures the bird should hopefully reach Riglan - if he's in Sungift - in at worst about 12 hours, but by-the-crow-flies it'll hopefully find a faster route than the road so it might arrive more quickly - so midday or possibly sooner, he estimates.

The owl touches down. He hugs it, thanks it mentally - its telepathic connection to him in his time of trial meant that it knew what was happening, and had done its best to reassure him and fly as fast as it could, evidently with great success! He sends it back to the token; he uses his key, lets himself in and calls for Maireagh as loudly as he can. Maireagh shouts "Go away!" until eventually realising its serious ("Talk to the dog!" she says at first; then, "No, talk to the dog *quietly!*").

After a while she gives Temo tea that helps him sleep as the two of them are no good to anyone exhausted.

### 8am

Temo's awake again, full of nerves. Maireagh makes breakfast. The main hall is quiet busy - some workpeople still helping with the main tower and the apprentice assistant of Maireagh's. The wolves are hovering around outside too - they clearly sense a problem.

Temo recounts the whole tale in as much detail as he can, over breakfast. We figure we want to get to Deepgarden Keep as quickly as possible but in the mean time we check over any books we have on us or at the Tower.

Temo, investigation 7+12. A couple of books do mention the Shadowfell but have little detail - recounting stories that people tell about it, more than anything else. On patrons and warlocks, he finds that each patrol has a very personal connection to each warlock so knowing how it works for one person doesn't let you know about another. Temo history, 17+4; Maireagh 19+9 - very high! The two of them together remember Nethza saying once that she thought her patrol was one of the "Unknown Entities" of the Shadowfell. A powerful, ancient entity - for example, the Raven Queen is one such named, but otherwise "unknown" entity.

Maireagh knows that there is a group of researchers who know the Shadowfell well. We'd need to find someone called **Esmerelda D'Avenir** but we don't know how to find her. She's famous for having travelled through the Shadowfell many times and written about it, apparently, but the books are very rare.

(We jump to Riglan at Goldenfields)



## Riglan - day 4
### 7:30am

He gets up about 7:30am, camping on the tend edge and wonders into town. He helps out with the shrine and spends time with Tabatha at the edge of the woods to introduce her to the plants and there.

On our way back for lunch - about 11:30am - a paper bird flies and hits Riglan on the side of the head! He shouts, "Ouch, what's this?!" - it falls to the ground, then flutters awkwardly back up with crumpled wing to land in his hand. Tabatha recognises it. Riglan opens it - and of course, his entire demeanour shifts immediately. He says "I'm so sorry... I'm really sorry, I have to go... My friend is in trouble..." - Tabatha rushes him into town so he can tell the priestess.

He shows them both the message. The priestess says a prayer - Riglan gets inspiration. "I hope next time I see you, there'll be better news". Tabatha sees Riglan to the tree and he says goodbye to her, wishes her best of luck; she offers to come but he prefers to know that Sungift is in good hands. One less thing to worry about.

### 11:45am

Riglan steps through the tree portal.



## Everyone - day 4
### 11:45am

Riglan emerges through the grand tree at Owlbear Tower and runs to the main doors, bursting in; he sees the the table strewn with books, old scrolls and all sorts of things. Perception 25; Maireagh has a determined look, but clearly very worried and that freaks Riglan out even more. Temo just looks a bit dishevelled - which is unusual for him - and has a sort of "I've got my shit together because I have to but just underneath this I'm in pieces" look. A fragility. Riglan runs up to Temo and hugs him, says, "I just got your message. I came immediately. What's wrong?"

"You're late!" says Maireagh. Riglan looks up at her and says "I came *immediately*. Even *you* look worried! What's going on?" "Nethza's been kidnapped!" Temo jumps in and says, "Well, I'm not sure, but it sounds like *something* took her..." and he goes on to hurriedly explain.

Riglan gets caught up on what they've learned and suggests Sildar might be able to help with enquiries about this Esmerelda character. He can fly them both. We should prepare for a long journey.

Maireagh asks if we want to waste time on that, or if we just go through the rift. Good point. We'll tell Sildar what's happening, see if he can get a message to Esmerelda in case she can help with the rift at the school - but we're going in anyway. Nethza might need us and we don't know how important the passage of time is to her there.

Everyone packs up. We're in "full adventurer" mode. Maireagh leaves instructions and funds for the people at the Tower and we head outside. The wolves are there, so Riglan reassures them and tells them we have to go and help a member of our pack that's in trouble. He says he hopes they will be fine and don't mind carrying on their duties of guarding the land around. They'll make sure there are no intruders, they say!

Riglan wildshapes into a giant eagle - show-off! - and Maireagh and Temo climb aboard; as gently he can, Riglan runs and takes off, then flies, turns about, picks up the dog in one claw, then heads direct (80ft, fast) to Deepgarden Keep.

It takes 3 hours and we land just outside town, near Berit's fields so Riglan doesn't shock people by changing shape. We head promptly for the town hall to find Sildar. He knows *something* happened - the school was going to have an open day on the forthcoming weekend but cancelled it mysteriously. We explain then ask about Esmerelda D'Avenir. He's *heard* of her; co-authored a book with **Rudolf Van-Richten**. Sildar thinks he can find where she might be via the network and it might not take *too* long; if we want anything from Esmerelda we really ought to talk to her in person.

Riglan is torn; wisdom suggests getting help, heart suggests diving in.

* Netzha once said, "I know one day, my patron's going to come knocking... I don't know what he, she, they or it want; I don't know what I owe them. I can create these blades, wield the power of curses and draw upon shadows and spirits but I don't know where this power comes from. It's the weird agreement that my mother and father had with different people; my father's pact with this warlock, who managed somehow to pass that pact to me. I wasn't a willing member of the pact, but I know one day it's going to get called in."

Riglan, wisdom saving throw only 4+9 - he remembers Nethza's words, thanks Sildar, and says, "We've no idea what kind of trouble she's in or how important even the passing of minutes might be. I don't want to take that chance. Thank for your help; if there's anything you can do to make sure that Wave Echo Cave money goes to the school because we don't know how long we'll be gone..." "Don't worry. I'll take care of it. I'll send feelers out for this Esmerelda anyway but don't have high expectations. I don't know her personally. If it's a matter of money, of course, I will pay."

We bid farewell - "See you again... Some point in the future, I guess".

We run to the school. Doors are locked and barred on the inside. Riglan rings a bell outside. "Hello? It's us!" - almost a minute later there are the sounds of wooden bars being moved. The door creaks open. Klaus appears. We're ushered inside.

It's taking all of the magic that Klaus has to push back against the rift, while trying to keep it open. He assumes we want it open so we can go through to find Nethza. It's very hard to hold open - either close it, or let it rip wide. It sounds like we need to make a choice.

Riglan has to make the call. "You probably have to close it behind us."

Klaus offers to let us speak to the three students. We wait in the library since they're in class. No Shadowfell books - not student-friendly! It's a good college. A good *building*. It's comfortable; not flash. Riglan's very proud of Temo and Nethza.

Lomas, Manny (short for Manuella) and Cody arrive, looking somewhat sheepish. They come up to the 2nd floor, where we'd ended up.

Lomas ran in towards the end. He saw mouths and eyes and shapes in the air around, and a mist; he ran up to the rift, where he saw a shadow within - that's why he was close to it - and a shadow then seemed to wrap around "Miss Nethza" - as if it was trying to *protect* her - before dozens of hands seemed to reach from the rift and pull her in. He now remembers the look on her face - **fear**. She looked frightened. She didn't go in willingly. She shadow he saw inside that went past him in the room didn't seem malevolent.

Cody and Manny were outside for the first bit, but ran inside roughly where Lomas' story starts. They were listening to Nethza's story and were captivated by it - they didn't notice until a shadow, something that looked like her *own* shadow, drew a blade and kind of made a tear in the stone wall behind - but it acted almost like it was made of cloth. A dark purple light came out of it, screams, strange faces, insects and bats erupted out! They describe it as "like when a stray dog has been decomposing and its stomach bursts". Street kids - a tough life. "Then her shadow detached itself and loomed over her; but this other shadow came from the door; meanwhile, shadows from the rift had climbed up the walls and trees - looked like there were eyes and mouths, waiting sounds - then they saw mist pouring out. When Lomas ran out, a huge scary shadow behind him - which is why they screamed and ran - jumped over him."

So that big shadow was something that *protected* Netzha. The thing Lomas saw wasn't the shadow behind her; it was something behind her that she was describing, he was imaging it because she was describing it so well. A creature of pure shadow but covered in eyes and toothy mouths. Now, Nethza's *own* shadow basically turned into this slick, oily, sinister-looking featureless creature which just had a blade. Cody describes the blade - looked like people draw a lightning bolt, but made of a strange dark metal with a curve at one end. Shining as if covered in some kind of oil - the shadow creature too, which started as if Nethza's shadow but detached.

The creature that came to her 'rescue' was some kind of shade or spectre.

Lomas is saying that he fears he imagined this situation into existence. We ask if it's ever happened before; he's very sad; and guilty; answers yes. In the end he describes a time that he was mauled by a wild dog. He got very angry and imagined what he might do to the dog - attack it, like it attacked him; rip it apart. He heard from other street kids later that this is what happened to the dog. "I think I made that happen? I didn't do it, but I think I imagined it and it became true..."

We discuss possibilities - coincidence; an entity observing and fucking with Lomas by doing that stuff; or an ability he has but isn't aware of. In any case he should focus on his studies to understand his magic better!

Eventually we've done all we can to make them feel better. They leave.

Klaus says he'll hold the portal/door open for an hour after we've gone through just in case. We check everything. We have all we need.

We step outside, joined by Rebetha. Riglan perception 8+9; jagged edge, strange pulsating in the middle, sort of teardrop shape but with rips and tears off the side. The ones near the bottom snake along the ground, causing the strange effect we see in the other room. There's a strange mist here still, flowing out. It's hard to focus; the middle appears to expand and contract yet the edges don't change shape.

Riglan stands at the rift. He takes Temo's hand and Temo takes Maireagh's hand; Maireagh carries the dog. "No time like the present!" says Maireagh. **Riglan answers, "We're not trying to save the world this time. Not even a trying to save a town. It's more important than that. We're saving a friend."**

Riglan steps through, staff-first, Temo behind, then Maireagh. Wisdom saving throws:

* Riglan dirty 20
* Temo nat 20+1
* Maireagh only 5!

As he steps through, Riglan knows he's holding onto Temo's hand, but he can't see Temo and is looking forward anyway. He just has to trust Temo is behind - he's got his hand. It's dark and very misty; he can barely see. With his staff hand, he reaches to his shoulder and uncovers his permanent light - all it does is light up a wall of fog about half a foot in front! He covers it again. Perception 12+9; he can just about make out some light ahead - very faint - he heads towards that, calling back, "Light ahead..." - but he hears himself almost *delayed*, as if listening to someone else speaking, while he's underwater. He doesn't finish his sentence because it's so strange and distracting.

There's a quiet sound of running water; but then it gets very loud suddenly - as if heading towards a waterfall; but then as if walking under one; yet he's try.

Dex save - he takes 4 damage from smashing his foot into some strange rock object in front of him. Only his staff saves him from falling. He's still got Temo's hand; he looks back; he can see Temo's hand in his hand but the hands are at the edge of the nearby mist and he can't see beyond it.

Riglan moves sideways a bit to avoid dragging everyone else onto what is apparently just some huge boulder, projecting up about 1ft out of the ground; and continues towards the light. The running water noises stop; but then there's panting and running noises, like dogs or wolves, going past. But he sees and feels nothing. Just sound. Then there's a strange spray on his face! He wipes his face with his staff-holding forearm; it's wet; smells strange, maybe feral. He is surprised to not recognise any known animal smells.

It's been a few minutes now. Suddenly, when he takes a step forward, the ground feels very different. From a strange, spongy "surface" that he couldn't really describe, to solid, cobbled ground. It's a road. Looks left and right. The source of the light is a single street lamp hanging off a lamp post on this road. It's old and in disrepair - some ruts where cobbles are missing. Dust, puddles, mud. Temo comes out of the mist behind him; his face and shoulders are sprayed in something - Riglan thinks probably the same as him - a reddish liquid; he sees it on his arm.

Temo walks in. He's holding Marieagh's...

**Glove**.

Oh fuck. "She was RIGHT BEHIND ME!" he shouts. We call for Maireagh; Riglan tries Locate Creature for the dog and he's surprised, it works! We have to go back in; hand-in-hand again, no gloves! Riglan aims for the dog. Arcana with spell casting modifier added, a lucky high roll - 17+0+5 -> he realises that no matter how far he walks, the spell just keeps saying "directly ahead" and it doesn't seem that the dog is moving. **Ten minutes** go by. That makes no sense. All the strange sounds continue in this odd fog; crows, horse hooves, chariot wheels and more. Occasionally sounds like people breathing; a young boy crying at one point. Riglan calls back, "Temo, you still there?" no response, so Riglan turns around to pull Temo up close to see him - "What the fuck?" says Temo, but his mouth moves first before Riglan hears the words. We have a brief, really weird convo before carrying on.

Riglan sees a light ahead; the spell still says "forward" - but then his feet steps on cobblestones. We're right back where we started. The lamp, the road. Maireagh and the dog are there... We never turned. Walked in a straight line.

Riglan asks, "Maireagh, is that you?" and she asks "How did you get lost?!" - and we explain. She says she fell, next thing she knew she didn't have her glove, had to put down the dog and it led her here. She asks why we're covered in blood! We both realise it is, but it's not the blood of any beast he knows.

She says she's been waiting half an hour, even though we felt like it was only about ten minutes. Riglan's like, "I knew it!" - time shenanigans. "How did you find me?" she asks, and Riglan mentions Locate Creature; then she looks quite touched and for a moment the hard exterior drops - "Oh... Oh, you came *looking* for me? I thought it was *you* that got lost!" She didn't realise that - well, from our perspective anyway - it was her.

Where now...

Riglan uncovers his shoulder light; the lamp isn't bright and there's only one. "I wish I had locate *person*" he says. Perception is high, 27. The road actually emerges from the mist, it's not like it runs alongside a wall of it or something. The lamppost is at a corner where it meets a slightly bigger road. We can see that there used to be a signpost across from the lamppost; the wood pole is there but the top has broken off. Looking on the ground - investigation 15 - there are bits of sign left. We can see the ending of a line "ON" and a line ending "ANOR" underneath it on one part that's broken off. On the other side has more of a sign but looks like it was *chopped* rather than broken. "St Cuthbert's A" - Abbey?

The sign has no writing on the other side of it, so we can be confident of its orientation versus the stump.

Since "ON" "ANOR" is a larger sign - two rows - and since St Cuthbert's got attacked with an axe so *someone* was angry about it, we elect to go to "Onanor". We note that Onanor's sign looks like it had some kind of carved stencilling or a border too. Implies importance or significance.

Looking up, there's a moon! 3/4 full, quite bright... So it's night time. There are fluffy clouds. How very Prime Material Plane of it all. This is a confusing domain. The light is bright enough from the moon as we move away from the lamp post that we can see what appear to be muddy fields either side of the road, but on the left (as we head to "Onanor") is a several-hundred foot high wall of fog.

Maireagh hands Riglan and Temo the cleaning stone. We "de-blood". We walk on foot. A slight climb; a slight turn to the left, the wall of mist now falling further away; then after about 10 minutes we start to head up more steeply. Looking carefully, we can see some kind of large structure or house at the top of the hill. Two wings either side. It has lights on in the windows. It has one tree next to it. We can see three rows of lights in the windows, so, three storeys. A thin wisp of smoke rises from a chimney. It's maybe a mile away. The road heads towards it. Riglan says, "OK, so 'Manor', probably, from 'Anor'. Let's see who's home."

As we ascend the hill, we're on a ridge and we get a better look around the landscape. The wall of mist extends as far as we can see in both directions to the one side of us. It seems to be just a vast barrier, the "end of the land" there. In the other direction, rolling hills with small trees and the odd small house. Occasional glinting on hills hint at similar cobblestone roads to ours. Riglan perception 15+9->24. To the right - movement. A caravan! It's lower down, on a road snaking up into the hills; it might even connect to where we're going. The caravan is surrounded by riders and people on foot. It's all moving, actually quite quickly; there may be six or eight riders in front of it, maybe four behind it, a dozen people on foot who aren't quite running but seem to be marching. A rider at the head of it seems to be on what might be an armoured horse; the rider wears armour that glints in the moonlight, holds a helmet, has a cape. It's a long way off and hard to see much more than the impression of those details. Then we hear, carried distantly, some kind of clamour; the figure, raises a sword, the horse rears up briefly, then all the footmen gallop off the road into the field as if charging. They're running up the hill towards the manor.

Riglan calls Find Familiar for an owl and flies it over the small charging army. History, very good roll, 19+4->23, the only word to describe them is knights. Twelve of them. Maybe 24 soldiers in addition. Chain or plate mail. They're dressed in a fashion that looks, well, *old*. It's like watching a play, or a re-enactment or something. Perhaps these are just spirits? Owl perception 22; "Come on men! Push on! Push on! Yes! Death to evil! We shall bring them down! Set it all on fire! We've all lost daughters! We will avenge them this night! Bring down the coven! How no-one has seen what they have done; we are the last standing; we're all that stands between the darkness and the light. Chaaaaarge!"

There's no way we can catch up on the road we're on. They're charging straight up the hill. Riglan's relaying to the party. The owl keeps following. It is not noticed; they're running up the hill, focused. They get to the top. Now Riglan can see the manor. Glorious gardens around it, clearly visible in the moonlight, very tidy and well kept. The army charges over it.

Stepping out from the manor is an immaculately dressed, well, general maybe? But old; retired perhaps. The dress is French-style in our world, Napoleon era. Knee-high polished boots, blue blazer, gold buttons, rapier, hat tucked under the arm. Next to him a tall woman, dark-braided-hair, very pale skin but beautiful, frilled wide collar. Very small waist with some kind of shaped metal belt. Gossamer-flowing lace skirt which seems to be red or pink in the moonlight. They look like nobles.

The general puts his hand up. Thunderwave. The front riders are thrown off their horses; ones behind continue the charge; the woman steps forward, casting some spell - the owl can't hear the words - and a multitude of shadows creep out from behind her and lash out lack tentacles or tendrils, bashing down people trying to approach. Then she gasps - a crossbow bolt - it looks like it pierces her heart; but she yanks it out, breaking it; she doubles over, hisses - we see fangs, **VAMPIRES** - her eyes glow yellow then turn blood red. She SCREAMS. Ghosts come rushing forth from the house, one of the knights wields a holy weapon, radiant light blasting forth; other footsoldiers throw lit torches through windows of the house trying to set it alight.

The man drops his hat. He finishes whatever incantation he was giving; a mist pours out of his mouth - the owl can't see and flies up; then the owl seems to be pushed away; dismissed. Riglan didn't do that. He calls it back, nearby, then has it fly back in - towards the manor. There's just cloud or mist in the way. It flies through that low cloud, breaks through, but sees now a burned-out, long abandoned shell of a manor. The one tree still stands. The rest of the garden is overgrown and ruined.

Temo looks. He doesn't see lights in the manor now. Some kind of low cloud.

Riglan does his best to explain. He'd stopped recounting events out loud when the battle began as it was too frantic. We decide to continue on. Scorched earth; bones, partially buried - they just fell here. Destroyed garden. Clearly, a huge battle. It has all been picked clean and clearly, whatever happened was *many* years ago. Only stone parts of the manor remain. Both wings are gone. No windows or doors. A central stone structure, still three-storey high, stands.

One tree stands. Riglan approaches; his peace-time spells include Speak With Plants and Speak With Animals. The tree is big, about 25ft. Sycamore. He casts L3 Speak With Plants and say "Hello. My name is Riglan. You are grand tree, surrounded by devastation." "Yes. I survive through difficult and dark times. I grow in the light of the moon. There are others, small in this garden; sadly, I have no offspring for there are none others like me." Riglan looks down. Any sycamore seeds dropped? No. Any on the tree? Yes. Riglan says, "I cannot help you grow offspring here. But I come from a place of sunlight and water, many plants and trees..." - and it shakes seeds down - Riglan collects them. He says, "I pledge that if I am able to return to my world, I will plant these and your offspring will thrive." "That would be grand. I have been without my kind for a long time." "Do recall what happened here?" "Here? The mice. They come. The crows. Sometimes, the wolves run through here and howl. The fight with each other. They carry their babies. Some times I see them sneak into the house. They nest and then they cook meals for themselves..." "Cook?" "Yes, with fires." - Riglan surmises lycanthropes. "But there is a sad curse on this land. No crops will grow. No flowers will bloom. I remember a time when the land was fed. It thrived. Other plants here thrived on the blood." "The blood?" asks Riglan. "Yes. I think the previous owners used to water the garden with blood; fed it bones, which I did not like when I was a sapling, but all that has passed now. I dig deep into the earth into something cleaner. That's why no others will grow. It has been a very lonely, long time I have been there. But at least I can grow."

The tree is about 300 years old. So whatever happened here was a few hundred years ago.

Riglan has to go. "I must leave..." - "Oh wait!" it says. "This! This was wrapped around me when I was young. It's tangled in my branches." It reaches down. Some kind of thin blue satin ribbon. Riglan untangles it. "Thank you! It used to belong to a young girl. She was kind. She had a good heart. It used to protect her from the mistress of the house. She would come out here and play near me, when I was only as tall as you are now. She was short and small and could hide under my branches, and I would hide her from the mistress! Keep the ribbon."

"I shall. I am sorry you are lonely, I cannot fix this land." "But you have come here to speak to me. And that makes me glad." "I will plant the seeds. Farewell, old sycamore".

Riglan returns to the party. He's quiet. "What's that?" asks Maireagh; Riglan explains. The ribbon is magical. We decide to give up here and head to Cuthbert's A.

We get back to the road, and plod back the other way. We go past the lamppost, so that's comforting - directions and time make sense on the road. Well, mostly. Riglan, Nature only 4+8->12. Riglan isn't sure if the moon moves as fast as it should. He mentions this and remembers the sycamore saying it had to grow by moonlight. We're not on Feyrun; well, clearly, this is a different plane.

It's a sad plane, remarks Maireagh. Yes indeed. We have some brandy and try to keep happy. CHA saves. DC 10.

* Maireagh 3
* Riglan 10
* Temo 10

Maireagh is getting dragged down by it. The air is damp. It's dark. The stonework is terrible. Temo tries to play; *sometimes* Maireagh likes it! He plays... Performance is only 5+9->14, but at least it's something - just enough to bring her out (half his performance adds to her CHA save - we all get 10).

We're *just* holding our spirits up.

It takes a while longer in this direction to eventually reach - another hill. The wall of mist, now on our right, is once again receding away from us; this main road is a sort of lazy "U", with the junction and the street lamp at the closest point to the mist.

A distant wolf howl. A reply, from further away. Maireagh's not impressed. Riglan says, "I'm good with wolves!" and Maireagh just says, "it's just *every trope* here!"

St Cuthbert's A is indeed an Abbey. A low stone wall at the bottom of a low hill, granite outcrop kinda thing with some grass on smoother areas; the abbey is up top. The abbey is surrounded by a cemetery, because of course it is. We walk through nervously. The building is mostly dark but with some flickering light showing through cracks of closed, double church door. 10ft high. We approach and Riglan declares "Fortune favours the bold!" and, seeing two large knockers (laughs in 1970s). It's a ring, but in the middle is a cross / "+", Celtic-style, entirely symmetrical. Riglan grabs one and knocks confidently on the door.

We wait. Sounds of feet on stone. Grunting noises as the door is dragged open, apparently requiring some effort! A head pops out. It's a halfling! An older female halfling looks up. "Oh my! You must come in immediately! It's nearly the Hour of the Run!" - Riglan's quick on the mark here, "The wolves?" "Oh you've heard them! They must be preparing! Get inside or the damp air will get you!"

We go inside. The door is pushed closed and a silver bar is used to secure the door.

We introduce ourselves and Riglan says "we're new here!" - she responds, "Yes, you're Riglan, come this way" (huh?)

We follow through a second set of doors to a warmer room with a long table in the middle. Dining maybe. Sat there, a young human man and an older human man, as well as a very injured-looking maybe elf, maybe half-elf. Riglan sees that the injuries are old and as healed as they're likely to get. They turn. "Guests? At this time of day? Are you lost, pilgrims?" The halfling says "No, this is Riglan, Temo and Maireagh!" The older guy - "Really?! Huh!" - he looks over to the elf and says "Right, well I guess I was wrong" and flicks some kind of coin to the table which the elf grabs.

Riglan says "You all have us at a disadvantage. It seems our names are somehow known here..."

"Yes. And! And! I guessed that you would appear today! So I made extra food! Dunny here said I was crazy. I bet him a silver."

"...very kind of you to make extra food. But I was wondering, what is it you have heard of us and why did you expect us?"

The halfling apologises. "I'm so sorry. How rude of me. I'm Mother Yi. That's Dunny" (older guy) "Denny" (younger guy) "and - you made the food, might as well get it! - Serena!" (elf). She goes to fetch food. Mother Yi explains more. "We hoped you would come here looking because Nethza said you would come looking for her." "Is she OK?" "I think so. I think she's OK?" Denny chips in. "Mother Yi! I don't think they know."

Riglan says, "Forgive us. From our perspective, we have been in this domain barely more than one hour."

"Well then. Welcome. Welcome to your worst, most boring, saddest nightmare" says Denny. The food arrives and he starts to eat; we join in. "We don't know how Nethza is. She left a month ago." "Oh! Time must be very different here. She was only gone around a *day* in our world." "We don't have days! We measure months by the cycle of the moon in the sky. It is nearly time... It's nearly the Hour of the Run... The Hour of the Run happens when this moon sets and the full moon rises."

Riglan says, "So, Nethza was here, told you we might come, then left." "She stayed with us for a while." "Did she say anything else, like, how she came to be here, or why she left?" "She said she was hoping you'd arrive. But when the month was nearly up and the Hour of the Run was about to begin, she knew she couldn't do a full month here."

"What happens at the Hour of the Run?" "The Hour announces the beginning of the Hunt. It's dangerous outside. Everyone hides indoors. No matter what you do, when that moon traverses the sky, the entire realm falls asleep. When the new moon rises..." (!) "...we are in a different time. We could go back in time; we could go forward; we don't know." Serena adds - "We only go forward from the past. But we don't go into the future. This place is built upon memories. It can never be built upon something that has not happened."

We learn that Nethza slept here in the first Hour Of The Run, after being here about a week. Then she waited for us, then left.

"But if sleeping here keeps you safe, why did she leave?"

"She wasn't sure if she should wait here or continue on her quest."

"Quest?"

"She only shared a little. She needed to find the source. She needed to answer the call. She was being guided by a spectre. The spectre was urging her to move on. It said that until she could resolve the paradox, this world could not go to rest."

Riglan perception 26. For a moment, he sees everything around him - almost like the Matrix, seeing the code - sees through the 'layers' of people and the building. Nothing real. Constructs upon constructs. It's brief, solidifies into reality quickly. A moment of seeing a totally different reality. It confirms his bias that this is all make-believe. But if it's all make-believe, what they're telling me might not be true; but he gets the feeling that the people here living things are *real* at least to each other. They're living it. Is the *realm* real though? Not clear. He voices this.

Denny says, "Wherever you go, we'll get closer to Nethza... All roads in this realm lead to the paradox Nethza has to solve. This whole realm was made *for her* to solve" - then there's a strange shift and conversation continues as if he hadn't said that. It's like he's "Breaking the fourth wall" whenever he speaks.

If we wait here and sleep for the Hour, then when we wake, we'll be in some "other time". But so will Netzha; we won't lose her. *We* don't much care if it's 100 years ago or "yesterday" in this realm's terms, but the residents certainly do care - it messes them up. We learn that the barriers between times start to break down. Ah, so that's why we saw the strange battle at the manor. That was about 250 years ago, "at the height of St Cuthbert's", apparently, when all the surrounding towns were part of the cloister. It wasn't an Abbey then - almost a cathedral! They had a bishop.

Riglan asks if they consider "now" to be in the past, or close to the present. Mother Yi says she thinks it's a *bit* in the past. She likes this time! She likes some previous ones too. She also somehow remembers a time when "we are not here anymore" - in the less distant past. For a month, they're not around. Then they're back. "People tell us!" she explains. Denny says, "Well *I* tell you. My fate is not tied to the abbey. I'm not from here - I'm a traveller like you."

He was dragged into what he calls "Nethza's waking nightmare". He needs to get back to Daggerford. His family will be worried sick. He thinks he's been here about 6 months. But he's surprised when Riglan says he's heard of Daggerford. "But how could you have heard of Daggerford? There's only about 5 houses there!" - and the penny drops. Riglan fudges it - "Was on a map we saw" - and Denny looks quite proud of that.

Very sad. Unless he can find a way back to *when* he is from, the messing up of time means his family is long, long gone - Daggerford is a large town now.

"It sounds like we should wait here? May we?"

Serena says "Well I made dinner!"

"And very nice it is too. Thank you."

Maireagh has some garlic. We say we have some fresh fruit! It's in the chest of preserving. We open the chest - but when we remove the fruit, it's rotten. What?! A bit is rescued; we get some of it - we're all determined! - but it's a shame. It's rotted in a strange way; some just bruised, others worm-eaten, some mouldy. So, pulling things out causes them to instantly age, or *something* like that.

Suddenly, there's a LOUD howl, close by. Serena runs to a window. "The moon is setting! Close and barricade all the windows and doors! Hurry!" - everyone runs into action. Metal shutters with silver bars. We help.

There's a moment of panic - "The bell tower!" - Serena knows where the boards are but could do with help, she's very fast, Riglan follows as quickly as he can. The tower is some four storeys up. We see the moon just setting. A full moon is rising on the other. There's a chilling howl that echoes through the valley. Serena is frantically pulling up what looks like huge shields made of wood, to block off the sides of the tower. We're doing the same. She hammers in nails quickly, then lowers a silver chain curtain of sorts down. That done, we go back downstairs - Riglan worried about when they'll fall asleep!

The fire down there is stoked. It is warm. "We just need to sit here and keep each other company and not go mad until we fall asleep!"

Dunny looks at us. "Any of you good with a sword or a club?" "Yes" "You gonna help defend the Abbey?" "Yes" "OK. Good. We're counting on you, until we all fall asleep. Those wolves? And the vampires and the like? They can't get through the silver. But the creatures of shadow? They don't worry about silver at all - that's why we've got the fire stoked as high as we can! Got to keep it burning bright. Keep the shadows at bay. Sometimes they find a way in... Counting on you to help defend this place."

So we sit by the fire - somewhat nervously - Temo plays some music (performance check, 25 - spirits do lift). Howling and scratching outside; sounds of battle and snarling. We even hear things climbing on the roof!

Con save:

* Riglan dirty 20
* Maireagh dirty 20
* Temo adv 5,7 - he's tired after playing so much

Temo yawns. The fire flickers, as if a huge wind just came down the chimney! Perception rolls are dreadful - Temo rolls 1,1,6+5 -> 11, Riglan 1 as well, 10 total; Maireagh is low. None of us notice! It takes too long... Movement in the shadows. Wailing. A spirit rises out from one of the corners. Serena yells, "Banshee!" - we see more movement as more and more shadowy-looking dark elves, completely black eyes, appear.

Roll for initiative!

* Temo 24
* Maireagh 23
* Riglan 15

The low perception rolls mean we all got surprised at the start.

One of the dark elves says, "Turn back now! Do not go further along this path. She must walk it alone. You cannot save her. She belongs to us" - surely they know that's a red rag to the bull for this party?! It casts Confusion.

Wisdom saves - Temo and Riglan both fail, despite Temo using a luck point. Maireagh fails too. Mother Yi and Dunny are OK, but Denny fails and Serena fails.

Riglan: D10->10. He casts L5 Dragonic Spirit for a radiant crystal dragon, "attack the spirit elves", activates his staff, backs away as far as he can to still see the room, then makes his wisdom save against Confusion (20+9).

The dragon rends at the first guy. Hits it for 13 points. It vanishes! Leaves behind mist. Hits the next too, for a maximum 15 damage. That one does not vanish, so now it uses its breath weapon; the visible spirit makes its dex save, taking 3 radiant.

The banshee acts - it wails. Almost everyone except Riglan, the dog and Mother Yi are in range. DC13 con save. Temo - with another luck point - takes 10 psychic damage. Maireagh likewise. Denny and Serena both fall - collapse instantly.

The other elf acts. The first had a big spear; this one carries spiked chains. It moves in behind Dunny, within range of Dunny, Temo and the dragon and attacks the dragon first. Matches AC to hit; 7 damage. It fails a DC14 dex save (badly), but a resulting grapple attempt fails due to its size. It misses Dunny and Temo. Then it teleports, back into the corner where it came from.

Dunny casts some kind of spell that is a form of Protection From Evil. Evil creatures now have disadvantage on attacking. It encompasses everyone except Riglan. Mother Yi runs around and brings Serena back up via Cure Wounds.

Temo is confused still; D10->5, he does nothing except make a save - and luckily rolls a 17+1, so is now free of confusion. Maireagh D10->5, same deal, no movement or action, but she is able to say "Sic 'em!" to the dog and *does* make her confusion save.

The dog takes up a guard position behind Dunny and Temo.

The mental pressure of the saved-against confusion spell suddenly drops. The spell has fallen. The shadow that cast it reappears next to the banshee - it looks up, arms outstretched, hair flying into the air as if in a strong wind; a cold, frightful aura emanates. It's casting Fear. Argh, another wisdom save! Protection From Evil gives advantage if far enough away. Temo is. He just makes the save & avoids the fear. Dunny is all good too; Serena sadly gets frightened; Mother Yi is OK; Maireagh even with advantage sadly also fails.

Temo knows that banshees can't wail very often and shouts to Riglan, "That elf guy is a pain in the ass!"

Riglan tries Frostbite on it. It makes the save and takes no damage! "Oh my, it's pretty hardy!" shouts Riglan back; then casts L2 Healing Word to bring up Denny for 10hp. Riglan retreats a bit down the corridor. He shouts to the dragon, "Focus on the elf to the left!".

The dragon uses its breath weapon first this time, since both banshee and elf are visible. Both are hit; both fail their dex save, and with a great roll they take 2d6->11 radiant damage. Next it rends at the elf; hits for 1d6->1+9->10; then crits! 2d6->5,4+9->18. It's starting to look a bit beaten up finally. It notices the banshee's horrifying visage, but it's immune to fear - it thinks to Riglan, "Banshee ugly! Do not look at her!" and Riglan shouts out a warning, "Avert your gaze for the banshee!"

The elf who'd been hit loses concentration and the Fear spell drops.

The banshee tries to push against the field of Protection Against Evil, but fails a wisdom save & can't reach it. It gets within melee range of the dragon, but attacks with disadvantage due to that same protection spell; it misses.

The chains elf attacks the dragon *three times* albeit each with disadvantage. Miss 12, miss 15, miss 10. Then it teleports to the other side of the room, having noticed Riglan controlling the dragon - ends up 10ft away from him.

Temo sees this, takes aim and fires with the crossbow. He hits, for 35 points of damage. It's not enough to take the guy down but it's a good start. Temo shouts to Maireagh, "The one going for Riglan's almost down!" and she shouts, "YOU think you're a scary motherfucker? I'll show *you* who's a scary motherfucker!" - apparently mistaking Temo's comment to mean that the guy's nearly down & taken care of, rather than realising Temo's saying she ought to finish him off to protect Riglan & his dragon spell! So, instead, she's going for the fear elf - and why not, he's bad news. She hits with a 23, for 15 damage. For good measure, she then throws the hammer a second time at the other elf - she *did* understand Temo! - just managing a hit with 17, hitting for 19 damage and taking it down. It dissolves into shadow, but leaves behind what it was carrying - even clothing. The dog then runs under the dragon to attack the banshee, hitting for 9 damage.

The spellcaster elf sees the other one fall and shrieks. "No!" it snarls. It casts Bane, targeting Temo, Dunny and Maireagh. Temo saves; Maireagh too, despite her low CHA modifier of -3, rolling a 19. Great roll. Dunny fails though, giving him a d4 penalty on all d20 rolls. The elf now also makes two Shadowspear attacks - one against Temo and one against Maireagh. Both would've hit but for disadvantage imposed by the priest's protection spell.

Riglan tries Ice Knife on the elf spirit. It crits! Damage is only 1+8->9 though. The elf doesn't dodge the 2d6->7 damage; the banshee just stands there - unaffected. Riglan tells the dragon to continue as before. The dragon uses breath; 7 radiant to elf and banshee; hits the elf for a maximum 15 damage on rend (same deal, dissipates leaving its clothing and equipment) and then tries for the banshee; another crit (huh), but that's only 2d6->1,5+9->15.

The banshee disappears into the ground! It reappears in Riglan's face and attacks him. As it appears, dex save 1+0; Riglan sees it - needs DC13 wisdom save to avoid fear - but he easily saves (19+9). Next it attacks; Riglan is not in the priest's protective aura. Riglan can see that in fact it's a female elf, twisted somehow. It tries to attack, but Riglan dodges the touch. Temo now aims and fires at the banshee; he gets a hit with sneak attack, for a relatively low 30 total but it's enough. The banshee's spirit is freed and it fades away.

3000xp each!

Riglan thanks the dragon; he asks it to patrol, flying around, eventually finding purchase above the fireplace and perching there, on guard! Riglan then goes to Dunny - "Wild use of magic, my friend; thank you, that helped everyone enormously." "My pleasure." "Any more, or do they usually give up?" but before Dunny can answer, we realise we're already feeling sleepy. "Get to a bed!" says Mother Yi.

Riglan doesn't know where the beds are so rolls out a mat by the tables. Temo sees this and copies; so Maireagh does too. We stick together. Riglan's about to say goodnight, but we all fall asleep.



## Day 5 ("day" 2 in Shadowfell)

Riglan, wisdom-saving 13. It's just enough to remember a dream. Not the usual kind, and not like the bad times when he foresaw the elementals disaster. He's an observer, here, not a participant. Strange.

A village. Reminiscent of the villages we saw in ruins around the abbey here. Not ruined, although old; Medieval-looking in Earth terms. People go about their lives, toiling; subsistence living. The community leaders are older; they are gathered outside someone's house. A disagreement. The man at the door bars the way. The leaders insist. A crowd is gathering to gawk. A young man pushes the one in the door away; people barge inside. As if a butterfly, Riglan follows them in. There on a bed, lower part of the sheets thrown back and covered in blood, is a weak woman who has just suffered through childbirth. She holds in her arms a baby; the man who was at the door keeps trying to push people away but to no avail. Someone points. The other villages see the baby and look shocked. The baby is lightly purple-skinned.

The father is pushed to the ground. He gets back up, trying to put up a defence. The mother is clutching the baby as other women come to try and take it away. She eventually loses the struggle; the baby is lost; but as the crowd starts to dissipate - holding the child away, at arm's length! - Riglan sees the father pull himself back up from the ground; but then he screams in anguish; his wife died from the exertion.

Mists close in around. The dream ends.

Riglan sits up, wipes away a tear. The skin colour - Nethza?! - but both parents looked human.

The fire has died down. The room is cold. Maireagh and Temo wake almost simultaneously. The dog is asked what happened by her, but it is puzzled. It "lost time" while they slept and saw / experienced nothing. The dog did see that as we fell asleep, mists started to creep into the room under the doors, through windows, down the stairs; couldn't see; then there is a discontinuity and suddenly we were all waking up.

"That's very odd. This has never happened before..." muses Maireagh.

Riglan tells them about the dream. "As far as I know" says Maireagh, "Tieflings are born as the result of mating between humans or humanoids, and a creature from the lower planes... Mostly devils. Sometimes they mate, sometimes they enter into pacts in exchange for power. It grants the devils a path into our world. They somehow infuse their essence in the womb."

We discuss it. "I guess Nethza is showing us her history. Helping us to understand."

We hear a door open. "Morning!" shouts Riglan as Denny emerges. "Right. We have to figure out *when* we are!" he says. We figure the bell tower gives a good view so head up, but it's very heavily obscured with a great many cobwebs that seem old. We struggle a bit with removing the shields (athletics Riglan only 10, Temo only 12) - Maireagh has to help - but find out that on the outside, creepers and ivy have attached themselves to the plates too. It's quite hard to see outside because the whole building seems covered!

"Probably we went *forwards* then" says Riglan; "we'll have to try the main door."

Inside the door, Riglan realises the other three aren't here. He asks Denny - "are we too far forward?" "I don't know. Whatever's happened. We're too far in either direction for the three of them. I am out of this time, like you, that's why we're still here."

He draws the analogy to flipping through a picture book and stopping on a random page.

The *exact same rolls* for Riglan (10) and Temo (12) trying to get the door open! Once again Maireagh has to step in. Athl 13+6. She manages to yank the doors open. Again, a carpet of vines. It's impassable! Riglan tries to persuade the vines to open up a gap. Persuasion adv 15., they begrudgingly give a small gap and we squeeze outside. Behind us, they close back.

Outside is overgrown. The abbey is almost completely engulfed in very thick ivy and grape vines that seem to have grown from gardens and trellises which were nearby. The village, though, is intact. It seems lively if not thriving. Riglan exclaims, "Ah, perhaps I was wrong - perhaps the abbey is very old, the village grew, then they abbey got reclaimed? Hard to say. Could equally be that the abbey fell into disuse and the village got rebuilt..." - perception 22; the building style does look old. And then he spots it. No graveyard. He points it out - that clinches it, we're a long way back.

"Vampires are in the manor, then..."

The low wall at the base of the abbey is in some disrepair. The gate is barred with a sign we can't read, so we walk over the wall and read it. **"St Cuthbert's Abbey. WARNING: Do not enter. Cursed ground!"**

Nearby, townsfolk have seen us. They're whispering and backing away, looking nervous. We're a little unusual after all - a dwarf, halfling, young human, metal dog and an 8" tall hairy thing! They all look human. More gather, all carrying torches - it is, after all, perpetual night in this domain.

They start saying we're cursed. Temo disagrees - he claims we battled spirits last night and prevailed; we defeated the curse. Persuasion 23. It doesn't escalate but they're not convinced. An older woman steps forward. "No. You must be lying. The half-human is lying. The priests have declared the land cursed. Nothing good can possibly come from it! They came from the cursed cathedral! They must be demons! All *he* is missing is horns!" and points at Riglan. A younger woman steps in. "Stop it. Stop it all of you! Why fight. This is ridiculous. They've done nothing to us. Let them pass."

Riglan implores them to at least let us through. A way is parted to the centre of the village - we "run the gauntlet" and walk into the centre, where a well sits in a small square with maybe 6 streets converging there. Riglan insight 23. Many moods around us in the villagers, gathering in doorways or walking behind us.

* Some are wary
* Some regard us with menace and hatred
* Some regard us with pity
* Others regard us with curiosity and fear

No children here. Huh. The manor? The vampires?

We approach the well. We see that it's covered, in disuse. Riglan points at it and asks, "...but where do you get water, if the well is closed?" "We have only water that we gather off the roofs after rain. The well has been dry for months... Maybe a year? The trees are withering. We can't spare any water for the plants."

An older man approaches. Looks familiar, but history 12, not sure. Maybe related to someone in the dream? Not the same. He asks what we're doing in the village.

We say we're looking for Nethza. They don't know who that is. We say "the ruler of this realm?" - sharp intake of breath. No, it's ruled by **Azalin**. We ask about the manor; **Dakkon Manor** - no, that's just the underlings (!) - Azalin rules from a castle.

We say we have no designs on the village. We'd like to help with the water, but don't know how. We could look? We can't make it worse if it's already dry... Temo persuasion dirty 20. Barricades around the well are moved and the wooden cover is pried up. Riglan casts Darkvision and peers inside. It goes further than he can see, but is dry. Nothing growing there, at least. Riglan risks using a Wildshape to call a lizard Familiar, positioning it 10ft down on the darkest wall of the well and says to Maireagh - who'll understand - "I'm just going to lean in and get a *really* good look, hold onto me!". The lizard starts to descend on the wall and Riglan "looks through" it, at least for the first 100ft.

The well's fully dry. It could be climbed but would be claustrophobic in the well shaft itself. At the bottom, it opens out into a small cavern or cistern. Knotted roots seem to be holding some rocks in place. A tiny trickle of water flows through the middle. Ah, so a blockage is implied. But how to clear it?

We could climb it. Denny won't come. He says he'll hold a rope up here and guard it. So we knot a couple of ropes, leave Denny with Maireagh's dog, then Riglan heads down first - he says he can climb just by bracing against the well walls and rope is just for safety and to get back up; if he can fit, they can. So down he goes.

Acrobatics - 8+0! Not great. It takes a long time. There are lots of comedy grunts, ouches and so-on echoing up as he descends. Wisdom save against claustrophobic effects - total 21, so he's fine. He reminds himself of times he sometimes squeezed into caves when exploring his tribal cave home in the mountains. What *is* really strange is - apart from his own noises - deafening silence.

He gets to the bottom. A bit of a drop; athl 22. Drop and roll! Lands in a crouch. Perception only 14 is enough to see this *is* some kind of cistern. It's built; there are walls, it's not carved out of rock as he'd expect. He shouts up, "I'm down, seems safe, a bit strange though; come on down!"

Temo heads down next. He scuttles down the rope; Maireagh follows. It's easier for them as they're smaller; less cramped; taking time, it's all good. Maireagh tugs the rope - "We're good! Everything alright up there?" and Denny shouts - "Yep. Don't take too long!"

We don't need extra light as Temo uses his goggles and Riglan still has Darkvision up. Marieagh touches the stonework... "This is made; this is *old*. This stonework is quite old, relative to 'when' we are now." There's even a drain, that would drain the water away. While we look around, Temo starts on a Detect Magic ritual. Maireagh examines the stonework and Riglan examines the roots and boulders to see how it might be safely freed up. It's tree roots, but no trees above! An unusual sense to them, too; they're not roots he's seen before...

Nature check 23. Weird. The roots are knotted around the boulders, as if they were brought here deliberately. There are wide, open-mouthed faces embedded in some of them, he realises! He yelps and jumps back, then calls over Maireagh - "Woah, look at that! That can't be good..."

Temo's ritual completes. A strong necromancy coming from the tree roots. He says, "That can't be good" and Riglan answers, "That's what I said!" - the roots look maybe a bit wet; Riglan gets a bad feeling and says, "watch your eyes, I'm going to a shine a light to get some colour..." - uncovers his shoulder light - the roots are slick with blood. Even more of a shock; the faces in the roots aren't just carvings, they seem to be creatures that were devoured or engulfed by the plant and seem to almost be trying to speak to us. The trickle of water is, at least, water; but it's stained, with pink.

Riglan warns the party "this might get rough" and tries Produce Flame on some roots that don't have faces nearby. The faces are slightly animated; they seem in pain but can't speak. It hits; 3d8->18->36 (vulnerability) of fire damage; and there's a loud, shrieking sound. The roots wither and burn back, but then a moment later there's a rumble and huge roots break through the walls and come lunging for us. Adv. dex saves.

Temo dodges completely. Riglan can't get out of the way; dex save only 13; takes 8 damage (Maireagh avoids the worst and takes 4). Riglan says, "OK, so this thing's huge and we probably shouldn't fight it but we *are* fighting it so - fire, if you can! - and try to avoid the faces!"

Another flame attack; a hit and another good damage roll, 19->38. Temo creates a bonfire near the corner; the roots burn, 16->32 damage. Bits of earth are starting to fall; this place doesn't look to stable...

Mareaigh spins up the dwarven throw hammer and casts Branding Smite, throwing it at the biggest mass of roots where they burst through the wall. A miss! Goes wide; then a hit. 18 magical bludgeoning damage plus 2d6->8->16 radiant. Radiant sears the plant, causing roots to wither and fall away. Riglan shouts, "I saw that! Radiant damage is worse! Get to the sides, I'll call the dragon again!" but the plant acts first. At that moment, many roots from the "faces area" burst through, the ones that were hit by radiant damage in the wall apparently unable to regrow; some narrowly miss Riglan and wildly miss Temo.

Little nodules are dropping to the ground that look like they might be small beings of some sort; they lie on the ground...

Riglan calls the dragon, commanding it to attack the roots but try to avoid the faces if it can. He activates his staff. The dragon rends at the root bases for 27 magical piercing total, then uses the radiant breath; 2d6->8->16 radiant damage sears the roots, dropping things that were caught into the roots. The plant appears to react in retaliation by extruding a large number of boulders and stones that were behind, throwing them all at the dragon; it crits! Damn. 25 damage, 25 left. Its second attack misses. Temo moves the bonfire to the opening; 17 fire damage doubles to 34. Maireagh can't do much as the dragon is in the way!

Riglan gets in Produce Flame for 30. The room is shaking a fair bit now as it tries to push even more roots at us. Riglan shouts "We might need to get out of here, I'm not sure how long this place will keep standing!" Rope is still there. He tells the dragon to push into the tunnel/space where the roots and faces were, so it does that - can't rend, but breathes its radiant breath. 2d6->7->14 radiant. Again, the plant withers and fortunately the rumbling starts to die down. Encouraged, Riglan keeps asking the dragon to push in further. It keeps going, repeating its breath weapon a few times before the dragon gets caught unaware (str save only 8+4) as a huge deluge of water crashes into it. The dragon is forced backwards, out of the tunnel, flying backwards at us.

Dex saves all round: Temo 21; no problem. Riglan 2. He was right in the mouth of the tunnel, calling instructions to the dragon - his 2+0 (!) dex save means he is knocked prone and gets 1 point of damage (holds spell). Maireagh avoids it - she leaps up and grabs the rope. At that instant the water blasts out into the room; Riglan con save, 22; he holds his breath just in time. The dragon thrashes around and for a moment Riglan considers dispelling it, but the water starts to drain out. Maireagh's head is just above the water; Temo is sat on her head having jumped onto the rope too!

Riglan tries to dive down and grab one of the weird nodule things that the plant dropped. It looks like a child, but in a strange cocoon; some strange wooden pupa. He shouts, "Maireagh! How many of these can we fit in the bag? They look like children, but encased" - we start to hurriedly gather them, while Temo climbs up to help at the top with Denny pulling on the rope. Riglan athl 22 swimming - we rescue 8 pods. Riglan calls to Maireagh, "take them up and get them into fresh air as quick as you can. I'm going just explore down here quickly, might be important..." and wildshapes into a fish.

The ol' knucklehead trout. It's vulnerable to attack but a strong swimmer and can go upstream easily. It finds the water source; an underground river system. Looks natural. There's a clear area of cracked and broken stone and earth where the roots of the "vampire plant" look to have broken through, but it's now cauterised. It might be back, but is clear for now. While the tunnel was full of water, the river it opens up into has a surface and he can rise to the surface to see the banks. There seems to be a small room here. Looks like some kind of shrine, like a dark shrine; Riglan turns into himself, judging that he can fit and swim back along the short tunnel if he holds his breath. He calls the dragon and grudgingly it squeezes through - "I'm not a water dragon, you know" it calls in his head - emerging in this strange space.

There's a large urn. Seems to have a plant growing out of it; the bottom is cracked open, roots below. The plant looks kind of injured but still alive. Around it, feeding into it, seem to be basins with sacrificial altars above.

Chaos time - he asks the dragon to destroy as much of the plant as it can, while he uses the magically activated staff to smash into the altars and shrine. It takes a while but there's a curious catharsis to destroying this place. The urn shatters open as the plant is destroyed and, in the middle, a shrivelled, withered heart, which Riglan surmises is the heart of the plant. He puts it on the ground and the dragon burns it with the radiant breath. As it is burned into ash, Riglan hears *in his mind* a shrieking sound; then silence. All goes quiet. Just the river.

Riglan thanks the dragon - again - and dismisses it. He holds his breath and swims back. It is longer than he expected - con save 21, at first, all good; con save 14 on the next one, he's running out of breath. He finds the rope and uses it to help himself climb, but puts most of his weight onto his feet, bracing on the ground.

The townsfolk above have pikes levelled at the group. Riglan pops up his head. "Ah, I thought that might bother you. Did you know you had a vampire plant taking your children?! We rescued some. We might be able to free them? I don't know if they're alive."

Maireagh pulls them from the bag to calls of "WITCH!" and Temo shouts, "Well if she *is* a witch, she's a witch giving you your *children* back!"

Riglan tries a Lesser Restoration on one of them first. The case cracks open. A child, about 5 years old, sputters and coughs, opens its eyes, "...dada?!" seeing one of the families that ran forward. "Robby! Robby!" They call. "You bought Robby back!"

**The older lady is horrified that we've done this.** They'd been *given* as protection, but of course things were *not fine* with this arrangement given that they had no water and their kids were taken! There's pandemonium; but they say they were told by their "lord and lady" that "this was needed". "But we knew this day would come" says one man. Turns tot he older lady. "You knew we couldn't satisfy their needs forever." "But it's their fault!" says the lady - pointing to the *villagers*. "They stopped having children! That's why it blocked our water! You mark my words. I won't be a part of this! I won't go down with you. I'm *out* - you have just spelled our *doom*, fools! **They will not accept this outcome.**" and she marches off. A few villagers go with her.

At least we should free the other children... Maireagh and Riglan together use 2xL2 and 2xL3 (upcast) slots each to free all eight.

"You are sent by **Avacyn**" say the villagers. A goddess, or an angel, or a saviour; or something along those lines. They've all got different ideas.

* We don't know if all roads truly lead to Nethza!
* The castle sounds tempting, but tackling the Big Bad right up-front...?
* Meanwhile the old lady is off to tell the manor what's happened - must be stopped!

Denny says he doesn't want to risk the manor. His instincts say "that way" and points to a road. I guess none of this real and whatever happened, already happened. It's historic. And "that way" might go to the manor. So we shrug and say OK, we'll head that way and see what we find.

As we start to head out, one of the younger women - who stood up to us at the start - stops us. "Excuse me. I'm sorry, but I wish there was more we could do to help you." "That's funny, we wished there was more we could do to help *you*!"

There's a brief conversation. She tells us some lie of the land info. She starts to leave, and a child runs up - one we rescued. The two walk back into the village.

The road we're on *does* lead towards Dakkon Manor. She says it takes more than a day of travel! It didn't before. A different Onanor?! Onward we go.

We walk in this strange timeless land. The road is in better shape than before the time shift. It isn't pitted and potholed; the surface is level. The cobbles show signs of wear but still hold together. Walking is easy. Ahead of us, the road weaves along gentle hills, forest to the left and behind the forest, we see curling mist, arching over the forest. That's *not* where the mist wall was before. The mist is further back. **Is the mist consuming the land over the years?**

At one point, three horses come galloping past - "Karen" and her two lackies! "Keep left on the road!" they shout. Then, "Oh. It's *you* lot. You'll get what's coming to you!" Riglan shouts after - "Make sure it's *us* you tell them about. Not the village!"

We are surprised to see a soft glow on the horizon, as if a sun might rise. And then, it actually does! Denny is amazed - "I don't know what you've done... The most I've ever seen is a glow, like a bright moon below the horizon. I've never seen anything rise before." "Maybe if we do good things, the land heals?" asks Riglan. "Is it that simple?"

Riglan nature 25. The sun isn't rising at an angle, like a very, very late winter's day in the north. And at this, we realise that even at night it's been damp, but not freezing cold - it hasn't felt like winter.

A fork in the road, as we might expect. Looks familiar. We can see further along the road that used to just end in mist; it leads into and bisects the forest. There's a sign with *three* things. Ah. "Dakkon Manor", but the sign is different, it wouldn't have read as we read it if broken as it was. The other direction doesn't read St Cuthbert's, either; it says "Easling Village". The new, third direction says "Stormkirk".

Riglan asks Denny, "Well, you're not going *into* the manor, but does your instinct still say 'that way'?". Denny stands at the crossroads, facing the forest first; he pulls out a small deck of cards. He shuffles them. He cuts the deck and pulls out the top card, contemplates for a minute, faces the manor direction, repeats; then declares "I'm going this way!"

We let him walk in front of us, following him to the manor. Riglan, perception, 17. He walks with curious confidence. Moves with purpose. Riglan asks, "What in the cards made you so certain of this direction?" "The first card I pulled showed me that I was going to be lost. It hinted at a maze. For me, anyway... It had uncertainty." Maireagh says, "I'm not surprised - it heads into the mist" - of course, yes, it's further back, but still clearly not *that* far away. "In this direction, the card was a raven" says Denny. "Is that good?!" "I don't know. I've never pulled a raven before! But ravens are messengers. They can mean many things. Messengers into the lands of the dead from the living. Or from across worlds."

Riglan decides to confess that it's not just "pages of the picture book" for us in the Shadowfell - it might be the same in "our" world too. Daggerford was much bigger in our time. This might be bad or might be good - when he finds the right place *and* moment to depart for home, his family might not have missed him at all! He might have been only gone briefly. We get into a conversation trying to determine how much time is between us, so we might have a good guess at the time difference *here* in case the shift in time is indeed equivalent. He talks about the "Kingdom Of The Dalelands", but we don't know it. Maireagh tries to figure it out. He tells us that the Dalelands are ruled out of the capital, Elturel. *That* name we know. Riglan digs out the map.

Temo (history with luck point 4,5+4!) doesn't know much about it. Denny knows about Waterdeep though. Quite a bustling city in his time. He knew it was a centre of commerce and trade. Waterdeep was apparently ruled by a barbarian king, on that side of the river up to Triboar. Denny knows that much. The Dalelands are on the other side of the river. Temo knows that Waterdeep is only about 500 years old, has been a republic for the last 200, so we're looking at, given the implied size of the town, maybe 300ish years ago?

Interesting. We're a long way back anyway, in this land; the sun appearing; probably really *is* a question of the further back you go, the further back the mists are and the more sun you get?

Where the road used to veer up to the manor, we now find a fork in the road. There are signs. Left, two signs; "Dakkon Manor" and underneath, "Citeaux". City? Citadel? Castle? The single sign on the right says "Volridge Forest and Von Manor".

The strange thing is the road to the *right* was the Manor to which we went. *Von* Manor - "onanor". Not Dakkon. We got the wrong manor! So what lies in Dakkon Manor that was compelling children to be sacrificed?! "Denny! Do the cards thing again!" says Riglan. Riglan also notes easily visible recent horseshoe prints to the *left*. Denny's cards say that neither option is good but the left looks more clear.

One thing from a time perspective - the sycamore. We head up the right-hand road briefly. Denny agrees to come with us for just 5 minutes! So we go that. It starts to climb the hill. It's enough to see the manor. No sycamore. It was about 300 years old, so we're back further than that. There's a lush forest beyond and, surrounding the manor on the hill, many rows of grape vines. How odd.

"OK, so we're more than 300 years back" confirms Riglan; "On to Dakkon Manor!" - we turn and carry on. A day of travel, we were told. OK.

We pass the odd farmstead. Forests near the road sometimes. So different from the disused/abandoned pastureland we saw before - Riglan is saddened to see the destruction from these two snapshots, even in this perhaps imaginary place.

Con checks, after about 4 hours of walking. Riglan only 11, Temo 21. Riglan's tired, Temo not; unusual, but Riglan blew some big spells, wild shapes and did a fair bit of swimming and climbing at the village. We look for a place to set up a camp. On the right, a slight rise with some bushes and a small tree. We can sit against it for a rest and have some rations.

The sun is past its low zenith when we are packing up; we see wagon moving along the road. A farmer and a younger boy up front; a donkey pulls everything; on the back, four barrels. Wines! Wines all around us. We scurry down the hill calling a greeting. Temo in the lead since 8ft of Riglan is scary. The farmer urges the donkey to a (grudging, apparent) halt. The kid is only around 14 years old. The farmer is middle-aged maybe. Both human. We say hi and introduce ourselves. Riglan has used Disguise Self - for the first time in a very long time - to look like his original Sungift "human" self.

Riglan goes out on a limb and asks if the wine is from Von Manor. It is! They're delivering wine to Dakkon Manor. We're headed that way. We agree to travel together. They are Bernard (older) and Gerard (son). They're the Vitners at Von Manor. They work for the lady of the house. Riglan realises he can only hold his spell for an hour so tries to explain but they seem to think he's a lycranthrope and don't mind if he turns (!) - they wear holy symbols, which he evidently thinks will protect them. Riglan dispels the magic. "Oh! Are you a werecow?!" asks the farmer. Riglan says, "Uuuh, maybe?!" and Gerard teases him - "You mean *moooo*be!" - he gets told off by Bernard. "It's OK! That was a good one. I'm called a Firbolg. I am told my kind is rare."

The conversation turns to Dakkon Manor. The farmer says "They're kind of different folk... They're rather like your folk, aren't they?" - looking at Denny. Denny looks surprised and says he doesn't know them. Riglan and Temo roll shit insight, so no idea. Temo says, "It's OK, I think you can speak freely - I mean, if we're going there to try and smooth things over, we at least ought to know what we're getting into!" - and now a good roll; Persuasion 18+13 -> 31. Both farmer and Denny speak up! Denny says "I'm not hiding anything. I was just never asked! And I'm not a vampire! But I am a dhampir." "Oh! I've not heard of such a thing" says Temo. "I was attacked early on when I was here. I had been taken in, given a room and food, but then when I realised what they were doing I tried to escape and and was attacked and bitten. Somehow, I resisted the full weight of the curse..." Bernard says "It's alright lad. This is no world to be judging people! Which of us are pure in Ezra's eyes? Not one. We all do what we have to, to get by. We were just lucky that the family - the lady of the manor - is as devout as she is, that we can stay in the light. But we don't judge those who don't have the luxury of doing so. The darkness comes and stays and lingers; the nights are long."

We learn worse news. *Three* lords of Dakkon Manor. Damn. And we want to tangle with that?! Well, no, but do we have a choice?!

They tell us that they've never met the lords; they just arrive, drop off the barrels and leave. He shows us a chest full of vials of holy water! They have preparations just in case; then they scuttle back to Von Manor. The holy symbols, Riglan realises, aren't just shiny metal - they're silver. Suddenly with a wry smile, Temo remembers that he and Riglan have a fair amount of holy water that Nethza just bought us, many months ago, seemingly at random.

Onward. At least we have safety in numbers.

An hour later, the sun has set. Lanterns on the cart are lit. The barrels are covered so that embers from the lanterns can't land on them. While we walk, Denny gives us his story.

* He has a lingering thirst, but not for blood or flesh or somesuch!
* Part of the reason he's still following us, is that we provide him nourishment. What he feeds on is *hope* - he needs it to stay alive, to think he will escape this place.
* He thinks he'll be restored to his normal self when he leaves. That he can go back to the way things were.
* Just wants to be a fisherman, like his father was.

He met Nethza. She was at the church before he arrived. She'd fight with her shadow, her literal shadow, unless that shadow spirit was around; in which case she seemed more at ease. She left only a couple of days before we arrived.

After another couple of hours, we reach what looks almost like a town - but is in fact a fortified manor. Stone walls around the base of a small rise, rocky, the manor built rising up out of it. It almost looks like a keep except more elegant than that. Small workers huts around, fields; even a few small houses. It is an estate. We go past a beautiful stone sign, "Dakkon Manor" carved into the plaque. There's a crest above, painted. A three dog heads (or a three-headed dog?!) in white against a pale blue background, with swallow-shaped birds flying outwards in between.

Denny eyes up the manor. "I don't think I'll go in there." "Probably wise!" says Riglan. "I'll carry on this road towards the city." "OK. Maybe we'll catch up with you there some time." "Thank you for letting me travel with you. I hope you find her." "And I hope you find your way home. Safe travels." And just like that, Denny walks onto a left-hand fork as we carry on bearing right towards the estate gatehouse. Seeing that there are guards there, Riglan re-casts Disguise Self, 6ft human, just like at Sungift. We all pull our cloaks around us. We put the dog onto the wagon and cover it in a blanket! There's a heart-stopping moment when the guards check the barrels, but they don't seem to mind that there's a blanket there too.

They turn to us. "Huh, you didn't need to bring your *whole* family. There's room at the inn!" - "thank you!" says Temo, in a slightly higher-pitched voice, hoping to pass off as a child. There's a small inn just outside the manor walls. Bernard isn't staying around and doesn't advise we do! We follow on to a side-entrance; we'll help them unload barrels. Bernard knocks a few times; a butler turns up; opens the door a crack; Bernard announces the wine delivery from Von Manor.

We help bring in barrels. They're huge - two people per barrel. Temo has to hang out on the cart, as if on guard, next to the covered-up dog! We roll them. We're in the cellars under the manor. A receipt is written for the Von Manor and we're going to be sent on our way. Riglan's looking around for somewhere he might hide so we can stay inside without being detected but the room's too small and the butler is staying with us so all we can do is follow on out. The doors close. "Goodnight! Thank you!"

Bernard head off immediately. They try to convince us to come, but we decline. "Ezra be with you" says Gerard. "Ezra be with you, too" replies Riglan. The dog is taken off the cart. Riglan just whispers to the donkey before they go, "they love you and they'll keep you safe as best they can."

Off they go - at speed!

We estimate it's about 5pm. Temo enquires with the inn keeper about "Karen" and the lackies, did they come through this way? Disadv persuasion, 24. He's a hawkish looking man. Leans forward. "We're not supposed to reveal the people who are staying with us, you understand?" - Temo sleight-of-hand drops a gold piece onto the bar - "are you looking for a room close to or far away from them?" "Close is always good!" "Very well... For the night? The three?" "Please" "5 silvers." Temo pays. We're given an ornate-looking key. Cast iron on a large ring. "The room right next door". "Perfect. Thank you."

Temo tells the group. Maireagh is mortified, they'll hear everything we're saying! No no, the other way around! We'll hear *them* says Temo. "We know they're there, but they don't know we're here. It's *genius*."

8 rooms upstairs. We're at the far end on the left of the hallway. We creep inside quietly. Stealth - Riglan, nat 20+0! and Temo 29, but Maireagh - nat 1, trips over a loose floorboard but Temo catches her!

It's a spartan room. Maireagh is incredulous. Two beds. One is a bit bigger. Temo whispers, "But I said *three* people. And it was expensive!" Maireagh is already getting out a bed roll, unimpressed. Temo has the small bed. Riglan has to lie diagonally on the bigger one. It'll work. Anyway, Riglan sends a spider next door. Karen and co are there. The room has one nice bed (that she's on) and the other two have bed rolls. Riglan listens in to the conversation. She's complaining. "...believe we came all this way and have to stay in this expensive inn, such a rip-off, you'd think if I was doing things good for the realm that I wouldn't have to pay for the privilege." - the two guys are sat around a small table nodding in agreement. She's taken off her riding cloak. "Can't believe we can't get an audience with them tonight. Sheer idiocy. There must be a better system than this! They wouldn't even let us in!" - then she decides to try again, suddenly. She puts on her riding cloak. "We're going to see them again!"

Riglan tells the group they're about to leave. Temo decides to knock on the door and tries to convince them not to go to the manor. He's persuasive enough to not get attacked (!) but not to stop her. He rolls low insight. She insists we come to the manor; Temo tries a bit more but it doesn't work, so in the end - "all your questions will be answered if you just come into the manor" - and Temo knows *something* is bad - so all we can do is be prepared for *some* kind of trap or sculduggery and go with her.

The innkeeper sees us all leave together, but doesn't seem to react even though Riglan's been forced to drop his Disguise Self because otherwise the woman (later, we learn the name is **Anna**) didn't recognise him and accused us of further deception. We follow her marching up to the manor. She thumps on the door. A middle-aged man, tied back grey hair, wearing a doublet; answers the door; "Madam! I told you. *No* - not today. Come back tomorrow" - but she pushes back against the door and insists. She says she brings the "perpetrators of the crime, I shall see justice done!" but he doesn't budge. We hear her saying that she was "**told to come to the manor if anything went wrong**" and so-on. She keeps pleading. Annoyingly, the butler guy caves. He opens the door. "You might as well come inside while I find out what's going on."

We're told to wipe our feet. Riglan considers the cleaning stone but thinks better of it.

Two suits of armour on either side of a hallway. Heraldry/banners; chandelier; various doors; a large archway with a very beautiful carved wooden door with painted glass inlays which leads to an even bigger foyer. We're just in an entrance hallway! We see the butler guy going off to one side.

Eventually, someone else emerges. Slightly younger, better dressed albeit more casual. Finer clothing. We get funny looks, inevitably. She introduces herself as **Anna** from Easling Village. She's trying to be more prim and proper. She talks of an interruption to our tithes from "these things! They came out of cursed ground. I think they're demons. Or they're possessed by demons. They've stolen the sacrifices - the tithes that our village has given - and they've destroyed it all. We will not be held accountable for what they have done. It is not our fault. The punishment must go to them."

"Very well" he answers. "Do you have a room at the inn tonight?" "Yes..." - she mentions the cost, and the man sighs and gives her 5sp - "...and have you also paid for the people you brought?" and before she can answer Temo says, "Oh, we paid for ourselves" and he's given 5sp ourselves (he says "there's no need" but is given it anyway - and then we're told to "come back at a *respectable hour* tomorrow!"

Anna is sputtering with rage. She's disarmed a bit by one of her men reminding her that the room has been reimbursed and Temo even thanks her for *not* dropping the village into it. We get back to the inn - innkeeper more clearly surprised now, like, we paid for a stealth-next-door room then left and returned together! - Temo says, "didn't quite go how I expected..." - he mentions the tavern still has some food. Anna insists on not going, but her men sheepishly confess to being hungry. She says they'd better have money, so Temo says, "for goodness sake we'll pay!" and the five of us head to the inn.

It's a weird situation:

* People here know all about vampires. It's matter-of-fact to them.
* Giving up your village's *children* for consumption is a whole other level of fucked up, but then, Anna is clearly trying to protect - well, *herself* but her village too.
* There's a twisted morality there. In a world where vampires are widespread and you have no powers against them, how do you survive?

We chat with the guards, offering to pay for their food and drink; they don't think we should necessarily pay! We talk about the (quietly) vampires. Riglan explains that in his tribe, an exchange of children for safety would result in them fighting to their deaths if they must. But Anna made a different choice and, in fairness, the people of the village do live - but at a terrible, *terrible* price. "Things have been getting worse" they confess, "but we don't know why". Only two other tables are occupied plus the staff, and we are overheard; people are clearly listening in with fear. Even the chef appears in the kitchen door. Distant, but watching. (Perception 15)

When the matron comes over to clear the table later, speaks generally to the table. "Was everything alright?" "Very good thank-you"... And the dialogue opens. Very oblique conversation, but another table is indicated - a story to tell - they live on the other side of the woods. Hunters. Trackers, from another village. "We've seen many things and overheard many conversations over the years. You're not wrong... That *stuff* is happening... Do you want dessert? I baked a damp cake." A good excuse to stay longer. Temo and Riglan will have a slice. Maireagh asks about brandy; there is some. Riglans the two guards... They share a slice.

Temo and Riglan sidle over to the other table, as indicated. We say that times are difficult, but we have had some luck in adventures and trading lately; we want to share it; offer to buy them drinks (and the other table) - in exchange for good conversation. They agree and all are brought. Temo, adv persuasion 32! He tries to get into the angle of the village that these people are from. "Used to be the eldest daughter of the village, for a long time. Once a year. Then it became the eldest child, son or daughter. Then twice a year. Then three times. There just weren't enough children... It became a slippery slope. We'd agreed to it. A frog boiling in water; we just couldn't say no. We didn't have young men anymore to fight either. And they're scary! They're so powerful. You can't say no. What can you do? But it's become untenable. They've come to ask twice, this month. We have no children left to give! People are moving away from the village; they're disappearing, not coming back, don't know what happens to them. I don't know what to do. There are only eight of us left. It's dead. Our little hamlet is gone."

We learn that hunting there was bad too. They started finding animals torn apart; not eaten, just turn up, scattered, sometimes even so widely that parts were found thrown into trees. Blood congealed and black. Riglan insight dirty 20. As we're being told this, another person at the table is showing a lot signs of fear... "It... We... We're cursed. We are cursed... You remember Damon? We found him. We *found* him..." - he tells us he'd caught a stag, was gutting it, but *inside* the stag instead of a stomach he found his own child's head and deformed body.

Riglan's staff *creaks*; his grip on it is so tight. Rage. White hot. His nerves burn away a little. "I said our village would've fought to the death. Looks like I'll stand by that tomorrow."

We hear that the lands were always ruled by lord vampires but they didn't used to do this kind of thing. They ruled 'nobly' - they'd sometimes ask for sacrifices (!) but the villages considered it *reasonable* or necessary, whatever *that* might mean. But at least it didn't destroy the realm. They did the minimum, it seemed, required by their nature. They ruled fairly - built roads, defended the land. Then the days got shorter, the nights got longer, and things got more and more out of balance.

(Azalin isn't a vampire but is undying. Maybe a lich. We've had good dealings with them! Perhaps there is hope there. He rules from Citeaux).

"If I can, me and my group will avenge your children", vows Riglan.

"Maybe that will help them be delivered to Ezra."

This is a society - a country - robbed of hope. It is hard to know if this has any relevance to Nethza, or if any of it makes any difference.

5gp. A cheap bill for the whole room for us, these days. A big sum for them.

Later, back at our room, reminiscing a little, Riglan recalls that he almost went to Shadowtop to try and get a barrier tattoo against the Shadowfell. Good thing he put it off. We remember more about Nethza's past, when she once opened up to us; her mother making a pact with Levistus, her father with a devil through a warlock, the two magics struggling and in the end, her mother being the cost. Riglan notes that if his dream was accurate, her father didn't just give up and abandon her - it looks like the village forced him.

Eventually, we retire to bed. Riglan is once again very, very nervous about tomorrow; the nerves replace the earlier anger. He's never had anything much good in dealings with undead and vampires are even worse somehow, but he does his best to hide his fear from the group. As he drifts to sleep, Riglan things of moonbeams and sunbeams... Spell changes, for the morning.

Temo, Riglan and Maireagh are at least inspired (literally) to act.
