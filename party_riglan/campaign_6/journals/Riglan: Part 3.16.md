# Riglan: Part 3.16
## Day 41: Within Cormyr, but on the road to Cormanthor
### 8am

In the morning, Riglan's reviewing our maps and becoming a bit concerned. We see to have gone not far at all, with probably 10-11 days before Cormanthor. It is difficult to see how we could be at the shores of the sea to try and get ahead of Azamir's emergence within what he thinks is only 12-13 days.

Over breakfast, Riglan shows Isteval the map and we discuss options. We figure we'll push hard for Arabel today and see if we can find faster transport there. That's a good option. Even so, Elven Court is towards the middle-north-south, eastwards. We figure we might have to leave them there if we're successful and fast travel towards Yhaunn - Wind Walk or similar.

Isteval and Lesther suggest that after Arabel they split away and head towards the coast, then we rendez-vous there. It's a good idea, though Isteval would probably need to write us some kind of officially-sealed letter for Cormanthor to give us veracity. After kicking around options we figure - Arabel first then plan.

In that case, we need to make haste! We might not be able to make it in a day, but all we can do is our best.

Riglan: Animal Handling 17+5->22. Temo has some trouble at first (10+1->11) but gets lucky (18+1->19) after finding some grass the horse likes and letting it eat - more or less by chance! - but this gets on its good side. Everyone else is middling to decent on checks.

The horses do get very tied, but we manage to push them. An hour longer than we wisely should go, we nonetheless reach Arabel. It's fortified, with two bridges; Caladan's Way, which we're on, and a larger road, High Road. Isteval is known to them and we enter easily. He takes us to the Purple Dragon Knight's chapter house. The horses are exhausted and need rest - they probably can't ride tomorrow; we'll change horses. He suggests that, with Lesther's help, that we talk to the Academy of War Wizards for help in travelling.

They'll go on from here on the East road, through the Thunder Gap, to head to Yhaunn and North to the river delta from there.

We spend the last night together at a tavern for food, but we're subdued do to being so tired. After food, even though it's late, we drag Lesther along to the Academy of War Mages. Temo with Lesther's help has no trouble finding it, but we have to talk our way in! Temo adv. (thanks to Lesther) persuasion, 27 total; that's enough. We get into the academy enclosure. It's almost a barracks here, their station, but a tower too; the mixture of arcane and military is very curious. We get shown to a Castellan - a supervising mage. 

We explain as best we can. Essentially, a way to travel faster, but navigate and speak in a way that Wind Walk prohibits. He sits us down. "You're in a rush. There is urgency. I can offer you magical horses, ways to fly; is this anything that you are thinking of requiring? What form of assistance would be most useful?"

We discuss options, but it's difficult as it turns out our map is quite bad compared to his local knowledge. Insight 8+10->18; he might be assuming know things we don't. He explains that things much north of Tilverton is "scorched earth" - not rebuilt after the Netherese war. Tilverton itself is under repair; the roads that far are repaired, but beyond that, he doesn't know.

With this, he realises that fast horses aren't enough. The forest of Cormanthor is protected by anti-scrying, anti-teleportation; but he can get us to the forest edge. It's not low risk! He has a sigil sequence to the ruins of a tower called Tower Tranquil, an old wizard's keep which was set north of the Thunder Peaks, overlooking the Thunder Gap. It's just south of Moonsea Ride, on the edge of the Dalelands.

He actually recommends that our entire party go. Isteval and Lesther's plan to go East from Arabel directly is on a reasonable road that goes over the Thunder Peaks via the Thunder Gap, but it's quite winding in places and not fast. The road after Tilverton - if it still exists - winds a lot too. It ought to save everyone time to portal up then make our various ways cross-country from there.

Privately, we consider that perhaps - "scorched earth" - it won't matter which path Azalin takes; the roads are strewn with dead. Could it be that with his dream-plane abilities to communicate with other realms, Azalin might have even encouraged the re-emergence of the Netherese and *caused* that war? To fuel his army, later, when he was back on his plane?

"When you are ready - come see me. I won't be responsible for what happens to you on the other side! I'll test the sigil tonight by sending an inanimate object through... Or an animal..." (Riglan encourages inanimate object!) - we say we'll be there first thing in the morning. We'll all be on foot.

The five of us head back to meet with Isteval and bring him up to speed. He and Lesther decide to make their own way, because they figure they only need to reach Sembia and then faster travel options via skimmers or portals are available immediately.

**We agree to meet in Scardale in 10 days or so - they'll be there in 10 days from tomorrow morning.**

We sleep at the Chapterhouse. Each bedroom has a portrait of the empress on the wall! Temo sets up Alarm on Lesther and Isteval's room. The four of us are in another and will take watches.

That night, before Maireach's watch starts, a message arrives on the sending stone. The Speaker's Assistant's stone. "Where are you? We haven't heard from you since you parted ways with our delegation. Is everything alright?!"

Oops - we didn't update them. Temo responds, "Cormyr Purple Knights will assist." "Yes, we heard, but then you left?" Temo says, "En route to Cormanthor. Currently at Arabel. Speeding up from here. Sir Isteval of Cormyr and Lesther, mage student, heading East for Sembia at best speed; please offer assistance on arrival." A delegation will be prepared to meet them. We ask that they be conveyed to Scardale, or as close as practical.

It's a quiet night; seems we didn't need watch. But it's worth doing anyway.



## Day 42: Arabel to Elven Court (*big* day!)
### 6:30-7am

Breakfast is available and we eat quickly. We thank the Chapterhouse and would bid farewell to Isteval and Lesther, but they wish to accompany us to the mage tower and then they'll head back and leave after.

We go there directly, arriving a little after 7am. The Castellan, fortunately, is a morning person. The test was a success, but he doesn't know what we'll find there. He recommends weapons drawn!

Sir Isteval gives Riglan a holy symbol, of Helm The Protector. "May Helm watch over you. Until we meet again in 10 days." "Thank you. Safe travels, Paladin and Mage."

Lesther has written a Scroll Of Sending, that he wrote the previous night. "Just in case anything happens!"

Temo has his bow drawn. Riglan's staff is activated. Maireagh has her hammer ready. Nethza draws her shadow blade. The spell is cast over the course of a minute; the teleport gate opens; we step through.

It's a rough one! It feels like everything turns upside down for a minute; we lurch forward and feel as if tumbling. Dex saves - Riglan 8+0, Riglan 8+11->19, Marieagh, Nethza also do badly.

As we appear on the other side, Temo shouts "woah!" and grabs a tree root - the rest of us are sliding down a steep incline, then fall off the edge of a broken floor; it's a 10ft drop. We take 5 damage each. From above, Temo shouts, "Are you dead?" "Get down and help!" shouts Maireagh.

We've appeared on top of the tower, but a supporting column has collapsed. The floor in in one piece, so the teleportation circle exists, but the floor is heavily tilted. Looking around, it seems to be just past sunrise; the sun shines through treetops to our East. The ruined tower is in a dale between two huge mountain ranges and two forests. We are some 40ft up, on a crumbling tower with its East side fully exposed to the elements!

Temo (perception 10) can't see where we are; Riglan asks him to drop a rope, and we use that to get up even higher, to get a view over tree tops if we can. There are some intact stone stairs on the other side which lead up even higher! 60ft up. Riglan keeps on the stairs in case the floor can't take his weight. Here, he can see clearly.

Perception 15+10->25. Forests both sides. Around, ruins; whatever small outbuildings there were are destroyed - scorched, in fact - with sections of crumbled road. A stream once was crossed by a bridge but it has collapsed, the water flowing over it now. There are pockmarks in the countryside and even craters in some of the hills with rockslides by some of them, as if huge boulders - or something even more destructive - were impacting the area. The forest is regrowing and hiding a lot.

From the tower, Riglan can see a deep, old forest to the East; North and South in the distance he can see pockmarked, damaged roads. We could try those - Moonsea Ride - but Riglan's heart leads to forests, and the one to the East looks promising. We're in the Dalelands technically but there may be elves there we can contact.

We need to get down. Nethza has her flying cloak; Maireagh has winged boots; Riglan can wildshape into a big eagle and carry Temo. We figure saving spells might be useful just in case so use that combination and touch down at the tower base. From there, Riglan leads the way into the forest edge, then starts to try and track North-East, roughly parallel to the Moonsea Ride road but without being exposed on it.

Survival: Nat 1+10! It's been a long time since he navigated a forest. Oh dear, not great. At least getting to the forest edge is easy enough - about an hour. The tower, looking back, must've been quite beautiful once. He says to Maireagh, "We should probably restore that one as well!" and finds a big tree for a portal at the forest edge, just in case.

Nature check with wisdom added - another nat 1, +10 +5, 16. At the forest edge, things are not as they seem... As he walks towards a tree it doesn't seem to be where he thought it was. Within the forest, it feels like he's not where he expected. "I think that all the magic, the anti-scrying and stuff, might be causing illusions or misplaced impressions of location? We're not where we should be; I'm disorientated."

At the big tree, Riglan talks to it to ask about a portal. It responds very slowly. It's very old. But he's surrounded by forest here, somehow, despite having seen this big tree originally at the edge? He can barely make out where he entered. The tree greets him. "Gardener! Tender of the forest. I have not seen your kind in many suns." "It is good to see you. I am a traveller and new to this forest." "You have found us at dark time." "Why dark?" "Our creatures - they suffer; they bleed. There is a corruption that seeps into our roots." Riglan responds, "Ah, yes, we know of this. We are trying to help. It is why we are here." - he asks permission for portal through here, should it be needed; this is granted, the tree mentioning "using our fey paths". Then has asks permission to climb, to see where we are. There's a shiver and vines drop. "Thank you!" says Riglan; the tree answers, "Seek the carers." "I shall."

We hold the vines; they coil and pull us upwards. Soon, we're in the crown and Riglan tries to get his bearings. We're at the canopy level. Athletics to get to the very top - nat 20+8->28, then perception 19. We are definitely on the edge, but further in than expected. It's like we've walked 20 minutes when we didn't. Fey paths? It's a big forest. Navigating will be difficult. Detect Magic just to see what's going on locally; no magic nearby, so nothing strange with the tree - but perhaps on the ground. *Really* faint, at the edge of range, maybe, some feeling of illusion, hovering over the forest.

We descend back with the vines, **Riglan looking closer and now seeing faint trickles and veins of necrotic, necromantic magic; magic of decay**. That's very alarming. We're a long way from the Sea here. He tries to understand it; spell casting modifier based perception (which amounts to normal perception) - 23. The things that knit the forest together are the things that spread the corruption. It's weak but unmistakeable and the entire forest is connected. And that's the issue. Down on the ground he speaks to the tree; "Are you able to isolate yourselves for a while?" "To isolate is to condemn ourselves to die! We are trying to combat them. The Carers are trying to help. They face magic that is an anathema to them" "I understand. We know the source. We will find the Carers and see how can we assist."

(Riglan Persuasion is only 6+4->10). The tree sends down two lizards! They end up sitting on Riglan's shoulders. They tell him to find the Carers... But they do give some directions. "Follow us!"

Riglan looks to the party. "OK, so you've known me for a while... Sometimes things get weird... We're going to follow the lizards - OK?"

Well - OK then. We follow the colourful-backed lizards, slowly, for about an hour - deeper and deeper into the forest. Riglan's confident now that "wall clock" and conventional travel times aren't correlated anymore, and this gives him hope that we can reach "people of importance" in good time.

He doesn't tell his party about seeing the corruption, nor let them in on how this affects him personally; it's quite an emotional impact and he wants some private time to assess it. In this corruption, he can see in his mind's eye the destruction of the High Forest and his own home.

Perception 12+10->22. With his "eye into it" and somewhat attuned to the forest, he sees more evidence - faint, minor, but present - of this corruption. Misshapen new leaves, spots or curls on shoots that shouldn't be there. Flowers that shouldn't open. Black mould that grows on things which should be fresh. He think it's not unrecoverable yet, but might become so soon.

The lizards start to make clicking noises at each other. Others in the forest respond, we hear; they start to hurry. Two more join and give a concerned look. Riglan understands enough to hurry. "Must help!" so Riglan urges the party to speed. The lizards now run flat out, surprisingly quickly; we're crashing through the undergrowth somewhat, as we try to keep out.

Then we reach an open area. **Two deer and some foxes run *at* us - in panic - "run!" shout the foxes, so Riglan calls to the party, "Weapons out!".** Then he feels a chill in the air; and abruptly, in front of us, a dark, shadowy blur. Some 60ft is covered. A mist, over the forest ahead. Cold and dark. It's centred around a few trees; animals fleeing in all directions; a faint, raspy sound from the centre; then flung from the darkness, flying at us, an elf, flying backwards! They land in a heap against a tree; bones snap and crack. Before Riglan can even cast a healing spell, he sees black ichor seeping from wounds, as it decays almost immediately. It holds a bow.

Riglan just shouts, "Charge! Get in!"

Nethza orders everyone behind her; "I can see what's in there!" so we comply. It's some kind of magical darkness; Riglan attempts L5 dispel magic, having no idea exactly how powerful this spell is. Wisdom check 11+5->16, so he actually gets rid of everything up to L6, which isn't bad. Fortunately, the darkness drops; and the mist around the area seems to disperse too. Now he can see clearly. However, he senses other magic still in play; so that's quite high power. Protective, illusion magic above; fair enough; a silver of shadow in the ground that he now sees, a strange black portal seeping out of the earth. He points at that and says, "Can't dispel it, but it's a problem!"

It looks like there was an elven outpost made mostly of vines slung between two trees. Elven bodies are scattered around. One is still defending, but a blade of shadow sticking out from behind spells its demise; it withers and crumbles before there's any chance of healing.

"Beings" - shadow beings - are attacking. These are new, not like the shadow creature we fought alongside the Drowned back in Yartar. They're made out of darkness - pure - like folds in space-time. None of us have ever seen the like before. A body falls out of one, as if engulfed, then falls to the ground lifeless. Riglan spots two more still standing, but that might be all who are left! Riglan shouts, "Try to protect the elves if you can!"

A whispering and a shriek; clinging onto the side of a tree, mouth dripping with blood, is a strange, skeletal Gnoll, face peeled back over its mouth. All fangs. Undead. It's as if a chunk of the Shadowfell has reached this plane - similar to the gnoll vampires. It turns its bloodshot eyes towards us and **launches itself directly at us**.

Initiative:

* Temo 22
* Nethza 22
* Riglan 13
* Maireagh 11
* Spiders 10

Before we get a chance to react, something even more strange happens. A particularly unusual looking - "desaturated" - elf, with hood down and pure *black* hair, totally white eyes and face, looks our way as the gnoll begins its charge. It is surrounded by tendrils of energy that seem to be being drawn from the slain elves. All we can do in these brief seconds is take all of this on in horror. It leaps, but floats down and Riglan and Temo, at least, hear a voice in their minds, tapping into experiences of what we've been through. It's strange - a  brief flashback of recent life.

"You must be so tired! So weary. It's been so long! So long. Why don't you just lay down for a while?"

A wave of weariness washes over us. Con saves.

* Nethza and Maireagh succeed.
* Temo: 13 even with luck point, but Maireagh assists with Flash of Genius so he's OK.
* Riglan: 3+2->5 - very much not OK!

Riglan full damage, everyone else half. 10d8! 56 psychic damage. 1 level of exhaustion for Riglan too, so he's disadvantaged for ability checks (and screams in agony, clutching at his head, doubling over in pain but fortunately *just* keeping a grip on his staff - if anything, gripping it even tighter).

Upon landing, the elf turns and says to the gnoll - "we're done here. Take word!" and the gnoll jumps into the split in the ground and disappears.

Riglan recognises this elf (history 15). He's seen references to Shadar Kai before! This should be an ally... What?! This one looks different though - taken over. Temo meanwhile doesn't hesitate - aims and fires at the "mage" elf. Riglan reacts and shouts, "That's Shadar Kai, but corrupted; disable but don't kill if you can!"

Temo just fires. 10+27, middling damage really, 37. He's aiming for the shoulder to try and hamper somatic actions in particular. As the arrow hits, a strange shadow emerges and dissipates.

Nethza attacks the only thing in range - the same creature. She charges into melee, blade drawn; she uses Power Word Stun, which automatically succeeds! With a bonus action she uses Hexblade's Curse one of the dark creatures above on the tree, two of whom are flanking an elf.

The dark creature that just released a consumed elf appears to discorporate and pass through shadow - moving 50ft, in an instant, appearing next to Temo in the shadow of a tree! It reaches forward in a sort of miasma, trying to engulf him. With a luck point, Temo rolls 7, then 6, no luck points left, 13 total, not enough. He takes immediately 12 psychic damage and is engulfed - restrained and blinded.

Riglan - wisdom saving again, 22 this time; the influence of this shadow creature that engulfed Temo was also attacking him a bit. It feels like a *piece* of the Shadowfell, made of pure despair! It's a "dreameater". He resists and becomes immune to its effects.

Riglan, disadv perception, wonders if this strange elf has a control colour. It has some kind of necklace or amulet but no collar - and a circlet. Seeing Temo engulfed but powerless to help, head pounding from the recent attack but also seeing us outnumbered, he upcasts - L5 - Conjure Animals and pulls 4 fey giant spiders. Initiative only 10. He drops in the bear totem to try and cover everything, gifting 20hp to all allies - that's 10 creatures in total, 200hp.

The other black shadow creature ("dreameater") is next to one of the two remaining elves shadow-shifts too, directly in front of Riglan. No opportunity attack from the spider, distantly notes Riglan! Now it tries to engulf him... Nat 1 on the wisdom saving, 11 total. So he's fucked too. He's engulfed too. 10 damage, also restrained and blinded. Con save no problem, keeps the spell up...

...but poor Maireagh now has two of these things near her and must succeed on two saving throws. He's not affected by the one on Temo but becomes Frightened of the one engulfing Riglan. She turns and runs, crashing into the trees! She instructs the dog to protect her from the dreameater; it places itself between the two of them. Then, in an unusual move, she casts Aura Of Purity - a 30ft radius of people have various advantages as a result. With her reaction and the dog's help she convinces Temo to "believe" that the nightmares he's experiencing are not real; she speaks "through" the dog (flash of genius via the dog so its persuasion roll works); it **pulls him out**. It hits! He is freed.

The spiders act, each attacking nearby foes in turn. One spider is flanking an ally elf; an undead sort of spellcaster stands before it. It hits, just, but only for 4 points and the target appears immune to poison. The next spider tries the same target with web - nat 20 - it's restrained.

The spider flanking the strange elf with Nethza attacks, as a crit hit since it's paralysed; 4+8+3->15, and it fails the con save, taking 8 poison damage. The final spider attacks the creature that engulfed Temo, but even with flanking advantage can't get a hit (rolls 3, 5).

The strange undead creature webbed by the second spider tries to free itself - DC12 STR - it fails! It's still trapped. With its arms restrained its spell casting actions are very limited.

The strange Shadar-Kai (or not) elf is still stunned. It has to break that effect; at the end of its turn, it tries a CON save. It has advantage on saves against spell effects; gets 12+2->4 at the high roll; Nethza's DC is 20! It's still held.

Temo, WIS saving exactly 16 for the one engulfing Riglan (even with ADV from Maireagh's spell). That's just enough.  He disengages, moves clear and tries to persuade Riglan in the same way that Maireagh did for him. Riglan emerges!

Nethza moves a little away from the stunned elf and looks up to the tree above where the undead creature is flanked by the ally elf and and spider. She resists a nearby dreameater's fear effects, then hexes it on top of her prior Hexblade's curse, then throws 3 eldridth blasts at it. That's a lot of modifiers! 3 beams - hit, miss, crit (on a 19)! 11+10->21, 10+10+5->25 damage, 46 total. And it's still up.

The dreameater that got Temo tries to use an Ensnaring Shriek, attacking the close-enough Temo. Temo is affected and takes 12 psychic damage. CHA save, 18; DC16; he's not drawn towards it. There's a second shriek, but this doesn't reach him.

Riglan resists the fear effects of the nearby Dreameater (WIS adv-Maireagh-spell 23) sees that the dark elf mage thingy seems still disabled, so instead focuses on the two Dreameaters and tries to line them up for lightning. The *far* one tries an opp attack but misses; both make their dex saves annoyingly, and only take 13 damage each. He shouts to the spiders to keep pressing home their attacks.

The dreameater that engulfed Riglan now does its shadow-shift thing and appears next to Nethza! DC 16 WIS save as it tries to engulf her (and she's out of range of Maireagh's spell) - but she succeeds, just matching the DC.

Mareaigh shrugs off the fear effect from earlier. She's very protective of Nethza and focuses on the Dreameater that's attacking her; she skirts around the one that attacked Temo, bringing the dog along, then throws her hammer twice at Nethza's new assailant. Two hits! 22 damage for the first, 18 for the next. She throws in an arcane jolt for an extra 4d6->17 damage. She gets the dog to attack too; it hits for a further 10 damage. That's enough! As the dog grabs a bit of this strange "tear" in reality, the dog sort of tears the tear. The creature expands outwards for a moment, showing a clear portal unmistakably to the Shadowfell, but that then collapses in on itself. The fear gripping the area lightens somehwat.

The two elves that had been this whole time frozen in apparent terror now regain their senses. One draws its bow and fires at the Shadar-Kia, still stunned for an auto-crit. 15 damage. The elf fires again; 15 damage a second time. The other elf draws a longsword to attack the strange undead creature ("Deathlock") twice. Both attacks hit for 11 and 7 damage.

First spider - hits Deathlock with, again, 1+3->4 damage. The second walks up to flank with Nethza and try its luck too. It does hit, for 4+3->7 damage The third "auto-crits" against the strange Shadar-Kai elf for 10 damage plus half of 4->2 poison damage. The fourth spider just scrapes a WIS save against the remaining Dreameater; attacks; hits for 7 damage, plus (con save succeed) 10->5 poison.

The deathlock is restrained as before - but now it whispers a spell... No somatic components. It casts Dimension Door! It reappears up in a tree flanking the spider that was attacking the Shadar-Kai elf.

The Shadar-Kai elf once again tries to break its stun - but once again, despite advantage, fails!

Nethza turns to face the now-moved Deathlock and throws another 3 eldritch blasts; 3 hits. 18, 22, 17 damage (57 total). It's taken down, but as this happens and it starts to disintegrate, a circlet starts to appear upon its brow that is identical to that worn by the Shadar-Kai. The circlet seems to absorb all of the energy emanating from the dying creature; then it disappears but the circlet on the Shadar-Kai glows. Emanating from that circlet are strange wisps of shadow that slowly begin to take form next to it. Nethza shouts out, "I think it's re-forming!" and transfers Hexblade's Curse now, to the remaining Dreameater.

Temo has no choice; he'd kill the Shadar-Kai most likely, so instead aims and fires at the remaining Dreameater, hits, but it's a shitty damage roll of 36 and it's still up. In retaliation it attacks Temo, two psychic blasts; miss, hit. 16 psychic damage. Adv CHA save, only 15, but Maireagh uses her third Flash Of Genius to help him succeed.

Riglan has heard Nethza and throws flame at it, hitting for 14 magical fire damage and continues to encourage his spiders.

Maireagh throws her hammer twice at the Dreameater. She takes it down and it does the whole same expand-collapse thing as the other. On that second attack, she uses an arcane jolt to heal Temo for 4d6->9. The dog is asked to run up to the Shadar-Kai elf.

The first spider runs up and attacks the same elf, flanking advantage, 12 damage total. Spider 2 can't get to melee but retries (a regained) web on the Shadar-Kai, succeeding; it's restrained in addition to stunned. The third spider despite advantage can't get a hit (nat 1, 3); the fourth spider can't reach but does *web the hole* to the Shadowfell.

The Shadar-Kai breaks the stun, but is still restrained. Now it's Nethza's turn. She transfers the hex to the Shadar-Kai, runs up, uses Booming Blade and uses the *hilt* of the sword to try and knock it out. Two tries with advantage; the first hits; it is knocked out, *just*.

Riglan runs up to the most recently killed elf. Revivify works. Maireagh runs up to the one that was throw against the tree but it cannot be helped. Too far gone; the gnoll, it seems, had messed it up. Riglan's able to Revivify the one we saw speared with a shadow blade and a third, too, that a surviving elf points out.

So, we bring back 3; there are five allies up.

There's still a hole to the Shadowfell in the ground. How do we close it? Both Riglan and Nethza try Dispel Magic again. L5 for her, nope; Riglan at L4; nope (nat 4); Nethza again, no; Riglan, no (nat 5); 13+5->18! L8. That's enough. It closes. Riglan sits down heavily on the ground, heavily drained. *We did it though*.

We express our condolences about the fallen elves and ask about what happened. But first, the one with the circlet! It's still weaving strands of shadow. Temo uses Mage Hand to remove it, but it still continues; we ask Marieagh to try and smash it? Pretty crude but it's all we've got! It's seriously mangled (!) using Heat Metal amongst other approaches so that it's totally misshapen; it's a tangled mess. The strands of shadow appear to reattach to the Shadar-Kai, whom Temo has been binding and gagging, then using Mage Hand to remove any pendants, rings and so-on.

Riglan uses Detect Magic to try and see if those were controlling it in any way. No, but there's a brooch on its robe that's very strongly magical. Temo removes it with Mage Hand. Temo, WIS save 15, as he's removing it, feels a strange effect; "wait a minute, this is..." is about as far as he can get. Maireagh shouts a warning (Flash Of Genius - "if you hear something, you *know* it's not real...") and with +5, he succeeds (DC18). The amulet showed him a world - a future - that it tried to convince him is inevitable. A world under the control of Netherese artefacts, wielded by an old-looking, quite good-looking (silver fox!) person, with long hair, tied back, a huge crown, trimmed salt & pepper beard, but with cracks of a sort on their face where, perhaps, scars would otherwise be; an ornate breastplate. It raises its arm which holds a sceptre. In the other hand, a sword. It sits upon a dais, with a throne, carried by ghouls or other undead, themselves upon a layer of undead - almost a pyramid of such creatures.

The brooch lays it on the ground. Very strong necromantic magic; ancient, hpowerful. The elves are watching and Riglan describes out the magic effects he sees. They point out that it's Netherese, "The magic of the lost children" as they describe it.

Temo is very quiet. Then he just says, "I saw him".

"What?"

"I saw Azalin."

Not much you can say to that. Nethza asks "is he looking at us?" Temo thinks not. It was more a vision, a persuasion; not him seeing us. **BUT - he knows we're here. He'll now we're involved; the gnoll got away and it will give our description.**

A strange wave of despair floods over us. How strange...

...with advantage, WIS save DC15 (huh?):

* Temo 19
* Riglan 23
* Nethza is fine
* Maireagh is fine

...but all five elves gasp and two even fall to their hands and knees, as if weak. One turns and points. The Shadar-Kai has opened its eyes.

In our minds, we hear a psychic whisper. DC16 CON save all round. Temo fails badly, Riglan fails moderately, Maireagh succeeds, Nethza too. **45 psychic damage.** Riglan's at two points of exhaustion and Temo's at one.

Temo ends up at *1* of 110 HP. (We're not sure if I remembered the 20 temp HP, but the big deal is the exhaustion). Seeing this happening, Maireagh fails a wisdom check to not do more, runs over and smashes the Shadar-Kai over the head with her hammer. This kills it! The wave of weariness dissipates.

Riglan, medicine check only 11. The reforming Deathlock shadow that had gone back to the Shadar-Kai crumbles to dust, and its circlet does too. Riglan is about to cast Revivify, but Maireagh objects. Riglan points at the circlet. "I think that was enough. I think death freed it. It's a gamble... It's all I've got left, I'm tapped out..." - and she agrees but hovers over it with the hammer, ready to strike. Riglan brings it back.

As he casts his spell, it's unlike any casting he's ever had before!

He's pulled into a dream. He recognises it, he's experienced... He meets a Shadar-Kai; he sees someone chained onto a totem pole, who says, "Thank goodness you're here. Free me. Free me! I've been trapped here against my will. You must have come to release me." and Riglan says, "I think so? I'll do my best" - BUT - insight, nat 20+10->30. He senses deceit! He's unsure of the nature. This creature *is not* telling the truth. He does not release it from the totem. "Hurry! Azalin will be back any minute! Free me and I can help you." "You're lying. I can tell you're lying." "No! I'm a victim! This is a maze. This is trap." "You are willing. Why would you serve him voluntarily?!" Riglan perception 27 (!). The creature is talking quickly and trying to keep him focused on *it* - so Riglan looks around. He realises that the whole area around him is an illusion; he hears muffled sounds, coming from a short distance behind the pole. Riglan tries to "push through" the illusion to the noise. Behind he hears enraged hissing. An eyeless, featureless, large-fanged shadow tries to lunge at him but it really is bound to the totem, so it can't reach him. Instead, then, hidden in an illusion of a rock, he founds bound a child. A very young Shadar-Kai, bound and gagged. Riglan unties the gag then the bindings. It starts to try. Riglan picks it up and hugs it. The child points at the creature; "it's ruined everything. It's taken everything!"

Riglan, persuasion a very lucky 19+4->23. He tells the child - "This is your realm. This is your dream. You're the one with power here. I can't kill it - but *you can!*". The child wills itself; it banishes the creature from its mind.

Riglan wakes up. The Shadar-Kai wakes up, eyes no longer clouded. Riglan hears a really angry shriek; the brooch cracks and its magic fails (this was all within 10 minutes, Detect Magic still up).

This Shadar-Kai *was a child* when this creature invaded its mind. It has been enslaved for decades. Riglan asks one of the nearby elves, "How old would you say the Shadar-Kai is?" "Hard to say. A few hundred years? Why?" "He's going to need a *lot* of help."

Riglan undoes the ropes and hugs the child, holding it. He explains as best he can. This creature, mentally, is well below 100 years old. Nethza walks up and speaks in a language Riglan doesn't understand, then looks to us all, "I've never done this before. But I think this is the right thing to do..." - she takes her talisman, the raven's feather, shuts her eyes and communes.

A triangular shadow appears behind her. She steps out of the way as two other Shadar-Kai step through. They nod to us, then speak to her in the same language Riglan doesn't recognise. They take the child by the hand. They apologise for what has happened, which seems incongruous! They lead the child back through the triangular "portal", which closes.

Riglan looks to Temo. Doesn't say a word, just casts L7 (!) healing word, but lots of 1s, 24 total. Maireagh follows suit. Cure Wounds, twice; 12, 9. In addition, she casts Aura Of Vitality; 60hp are divided evenly between Riglan and Temo. Riglan just nods a thanks.

Temo looks at Riglan; figures Riglan's not going to be saying much for a while, turns to the Elves. "You don't need us to tell you that the forest is being corrupted. We know why. We need to get to Elven Court, and we need to get there quickly."

"Yes... Please... But we need to bury our dead."

"We will help, if we're permitted?"

"Can you watch over us while we perform the rites?"

"Certainly."

They collect the deceased. The deftly and build a small kind of, well, casket, out of vines, leaves and flowers. They place them all inside, then carry it to the oldest tree nearby. They cast a spell to part the earth near its roots, then place the dead inside. They say a series of prayers to The Seldarine. They collect the tears they shed within small leaf cups, then pour it over the dead, close and compact the earth and lay down seeds. It takes about an hour. It counts as a short rest for us, but Riglan is watching closely.

### 4500XP each

Riglan notices a younger female elf. The others introduced themselves but she did not. She's sullen, quiet and looks guilty. In her own head. She flinches at any sort of touch. She takes part in rituals but stands back and cries the most.

Temo sees someone else who doesn't want to talk - walks up to her and (privately) says, "tell me. It's easier when it's in the open." Persuasion 25, via RT.

* She feels very guilty. She's been having bad dreams for a while. Elves don't dream! They don't sleep. She's been keeping it a secret.

* She initially thought it was a Seldarine gift; thought she was being blessed by Selune. Dreams are Selune's greatest gift. She thought she was special.

* She did not realise that she was not in control. These creatures emerged out of her dreams; she was gripped by fear and couldn't do anything about it.

* The creatures ambushed the lookout. The elves were on patrol and got caught completely off guard. One elf who died was a childhood friend, who she had mentioned her dreams to, but they'd become estranged as the friend had tried to urge her to say something but she thought it was just jealousy.

* She never had a chance to say goodbye. He'd been right the whole time.

Temo says, "I can't give you another chance to say goodbye, but I can give you a chance for revenge against the creature that caused all of this. If that helps."

"My life is no longer my own. I have taken a life, therefore I have to repay it."

"I'm no expert on elven culture, but I don't think *you* did anything. Your body might have, but not *you*. What acted was a creature known as Azalin Rex. This is what corrupts the forest. This is what we must destroy."

They've detected corruption for a few months and patrol the forest edges as they see that it comes from the edges. "We are very thankful that you are here..." - and the other elves are now joining in. Temo holds up his hands, "don't thank us yet. We're here to ask for something that can do nothing but cost more elven lives; but it's the only wave to save even more."

"We owe you our lives" says the younger woman. "We will take you on the path to Eleven Court. We have to pass through Semberholme, because the paths all cross through there. Come. We know these paths are still intact; not all are. Shall we depart?" - Temo nods.

He's taken by the hand. "Hold my hand - do not get lost" - and we form a chain of held hands. Pathways; a thicket; an arch of trees close above head; and then the Fey Wild. Bright, saturated, neon colours, strange hues, criss-crossing paths. A few other elves along the way. Then we pass a nexus that we are told is Semberholme but we're quickly taken past that. We go up into a hollow of a tree, up the insides, out to a branch and then a lily pad walkway, floating impossibly in the sky above a strange blueish-green surface as if a pond - but up in the trees. As we stand on the lily pads they grow big, then float, over to the edge, over a waterfall, but staying upright throughout; we drop down, then back to the bank. More trees, more bushes; strange pathways all.

Finally - we stand outside a large, old-looking, under-repair elven city. It is made of entirely grown buildings amidst a huge stand of *massive* trees, redwoods perhaps.

It's taken we estimate only 3 hours - and here it is; Elven Court at last - "Welcome to Old Elven Court", one says, with a hint of pride.

Riglan is still quiet and withdrawn. Maireagh seems on high alert, taking in the view but mostly distracted as if expecting imminent attack. Temo appreciates it, actually; a sense of safety; he gives Riglan space. Nethza notices that even now, outside Eleven Court, he's mostly silent.

The elves say they'll go ahead and come back to get us when they've got "permission". They leave us next to a small stream and a big tree, with a seating area. Riglan seems to relax a little as they leave but studies the tree closely in silence, looking for more of the necrotic signs. None here that he can see, but he also senses some *very* strong magic at work - without it, he realises that the corruption would be here, too.

Maireagh announces that she'll patrol, and Temo goes with her. Nethza sits down with Riglan. He studies his feet.

She takes a stick and pokes it into the stream, stirring it around a bit. "What are you thinking? What's on your mind? You're very quiet."

"Hmm. Dark things. Trying to work through it."

"What kind of things? Do you want to talk about it?" She gives him a stick.

"Many things. The child. I didn't say, of course; the Shadar-Kai. When the spell was cast, I was pulled to the Shadowfell, or a vision of it. There was a - decoy. A false trapped spirit, and but for pure luck I might've been fooled and freed it. But it was an illusion and the real captive was a child. A child elf. That's why I asked how old he was. Azalin had held this - well - boy captive for *centuries*. Alone, nobody helping, just *helpless*. And I freed him but I fear, to nothing; how could one come back from that? A lifetime lost."

"He's with his people now."

"And we have to hope they take better care of him than they did when he was taken."

"But there's more of course. The lines; the veins; the way the forest is connected. It strikes me - I've never met a tree I don't like. Perhaps because they're all connected; all one thing. There are bad people. There must be bad trees. I've never met one."

"You met one."

"When?"

"Underground."

"Oh, that was Azalin, corrupting things again. It wasn't really a tree. Or least, not as I understand it. But your point is true."

"But the forest must talk. And that's what Azalin's done; he's hijacked it. That's how the corruption spreads. Don't you see? It's unstoppable. Like the air and water poisoned, but deeper than that."

"But we can purify it, surely?"

"We don't know. We don't know if killing Azalin will cure this. Well - we're not even killing him. We're just sending him away. And what if sending him away doesn't cure this? Or what if his army stays and fights? What if they don't just drop?"

"Then we'll have to deal with his army."

"Yes. And today, we dealt with, what, 6 of them? And it nearly took us down. I'm not saying its hopeless, I'm saying, you asked, and I said dark thoughts."

"You're worried."

"Very."

"And you have more to be worried about than me, for sure. But it's affecting me more deeply. I'm not sure I can trust my judgement. I want to shout at these elves; shake them by the shoulders, get them to wake up and do something. Not because it's their fault, but because they would abandon this forest. This forest has looked after them as they have looked after it."

The discussion goes on. More worries, the anxieties, the horror.

"I've lived in his world. So have you. We know what he draws power from; he thrives on despair and hopelessness. The more powerful he gets the worse that gets, so the more powerful he gets. This hopelessness that you feel - I can't deny it. But maybe we're not the only ones who feel this. Maybe the elves feel it too. Maybe anyone coming into contact with him feel it. It's his tool to make them give up - to think there's no way to defeat him. To step aside, yield, or join him. He harnesses that which people fear most; loss of identity. Loss of themselves. That friend would turn against friend, family against family. Is that not the most frightening thought of all? The only thing that we - *we*, the four of us - fight for is each other. And if we can't even trust that, then has Azalin won? Isn't that the last fortress? So how do we convince these elves that hope is not gone? We need to convince ourselves first."

"And that is why I struggle. I hear more than just you. Like any druid I hear the songs of nature, and I hear it going wrong. It can be overwhelming. It's hard to see a way out. But you're right, we have to be able to understand a path to success ourselves before we can convince others. Else it will seem false. I just struggle to see that path right now, because I never expected to see corruption this far away, or this extensive."

"I know. I don't think that any one of us will be able to find the solution. I don't think the answer is there waiting for us to stumble upon it. I think we're going to have to fight for every inch, every mile, for every win; for every life; this is not going to be easy. It's the most difficult thing we'll ever have done. But we have each other. And others. We are not alone this time."

"Perhaps it feels that way, as it's still the four of us. A few others help, but not many and they themselves describe themselves as not enough. I just need to get my head around it."

"You have to share this burden."

"Well I do, but you carry it equally."

"That doesn't mean I can't help."

"It feels selfish to say that it's harder as a druid. But I've mentioned it before - the undead, the corruption, all of it. It turns out to be harder than fire. I didn't expect that. How *do* we convince them? I used to think that we shouldn't - we shouldn't ask - but after today, I don't think that anymore. I think we almost need to insist, but I know that'll just make them angry. Perhaps honesty; if they don't help, all will fall. If they do help, it *might* not."

"What are we asking them for?"

"To fight. In a war..."

"Where?"

"Zhentil Keep, apparently!"

...which brings the discussion to fortune telling; Kyros' words, a helplessness borne from apparently being 'forced' into decisions we do not want to make, like bringing Azalin right through the heart of the forest instead of along the coast, to minimise the size of his army. We keep returning to the theme - how do we convince the elves here to help? How do we understand their perspective?

At the core Riglan confesses that he worries that what he sees here will be in the High Forest within only a few months; but it's the Shadar-Kai elf that's really haunting him at the moment.

Maireagh and Temo return and we keep waiting, to see if we've got permission to enter Elven Court. Eventually, the two elves return, accompanied by two guards wearing mithril scale mail. They thank us for waiting. We are invited to the inner court. The guards escort all of us.

We head up into the grove and up the side of a ring of trees on various hanging stairways, suspension vine bridges and the like. We reach some large structure that seems woven between the large trees somehow; clearly a focal point. It looks as much grown as built - the tree branches encouraged to grow as parts of the structure. We go along galleries of sorts, circling around more trees. Two elves are waiting in a room we eventually reach, turning at our arrival.

The guards stop at the entrance; the six of us go in. The two scouts introduce us. There is the court's Scribe And Herald **Seraddin** and a noble attendant **Llysandra**. The latter seems to be someone with rank. Middle-aged, for an elf, by the looks of it. They thank us for our "timely intervention" and saving the scouts. We are welcomed to the "surviving part of Elven Court" and asks if we are familiar with the customs here.

Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we confess that we are not. Llysandra offers to act as our intermediary, from which we assume that he will be taking us to someone "higher up."

"Come, tell me - what do you know? What do you understand of what is happening?"

We do our best to explain. We do, upon questioning, go into some detail; right back to our involvement in the Shadowfell and so-on. We're asked "who we are" in our realm; we don't think anyone! We know of nobody significant / noble in our lineage. Temo's recent Lords Alliance appointment doesn't seem too relevant either.

The scribe and attendant converse then disagree. To Maireagh, they say, "Your line, is your grandfather not of the Silveraxes of Clengedden?"

"Well yes, but he was not noble."

"Do you know of your grandmother? She was named Maireagh too."

"Yes... I was named after her."

"This Maireagh was a daughter of a Duke of one of the old Kingdoms. Are you therefore not of that line?"

"Well, I suppose so! A long time ago - more than 1000 years ago now. I have not been part of that family for hundreds of years myself."

"It will be good for you to know where you are from. Blood and connections have power. We mean your blood itself probably has power, which could be wielded - or used against you. Old pacts. That is why we need to know, especially if we are facing an adversary of old as you describe, who commands the power of names and wields contracts of blood."

Then they say they'll take us into the Court proper, this thorough groundwork now apparently completed to their satisfaction.

"I will secure you lodgings within the Inner Court and I shall call a Council of Elders to hear you as soon as I can."

"Thank you" we respond, of course. We're led up stairs to an upper bough of a giant tree where a platform has been constructed with furnishings (and side railings!) but is otherwise open. "Make yourself at home, get comfortable! I will return as soon as I have news for you. Feel free to explore, but be aware that if there are any guards who prohibit access to certain areas, they must be heeded."

As soon as they're out of earshot, Temo quips - "Oh good! Another council meeting!"

**NB - Riglan ability checks should've been with disadv., due to 2 exhaustion points; we mostly forgot, doh!**

We go wondering off. Maireagh is worried if we can find our way back! Riglan, survival 18+10->28 - fortunately he thinks it's obvious.

It seems a beautiful city - it's a large set of buildings, once you get your eye into it - but it's sparsely populated. That's the most striking thing. There's definitely a feeling that things used to be much more busy. Only rarely do we even see couples walking together. Temo says, "I can see what they mean when they say most of them died..."

We figure finding some kind of tavern-like space might help with meeting people more inclined to socialise. We can't see any so Riglan asks (persuasion 11+4->15). We're pointed to "The Wine Room", and head over, following the route indicated - it's close by on a neighbouring tree, set down in canopy with a view below the crown. Two large branches emerge beneath a platform supporting a two-storey, flying buttress design building, quite ornate and with a carved roof. Lots of small dancing lights. We head inside.

There are four tables with people on here. Two are couples, one is someone alone and one is a group of six. There's also a bartender and someone serving tables who comes to greet us. "Visitors!" they say and everyone in the room turns to look. Temo turns on the charm and says "Yes, we are lucky to be allowed entrance to this astonishing city." "A table?" "Please!"

There's some rearranging of chairs and a space is made. "Do you have a preference for wine?" We're unsure - we start to talk about the thing we had at Silverymoon in the 'posh' restaurant... Someone leans over and asks if we want a recommendation. They say we should try the "Cullannath". Riglan insight 22 - this seems a legitimate recommendation! An educated guess at our tastes. Riglan thanks them and agrees to give it a try. It's a golden colour; very interesting taste, but very different from the aforementioned Silverymoon wine. This is not fruity - floral and aromatic, but very dry. Seems quite serious. Temo is less keen due to his sweet tooth, but Riglan likes it as does Nethza, but Maireagh is a bit on the fence. Too light.

Curious pickled flower petals and toasted seeds are served as a snack. We try to get into smalltalk with the locals. We get into it. Temo does the talking - persuasion a whopping 31 - and Riglan is listening and watching - insight a very high 25. There seem to be different factions in this small group of people. The two younger couples seem very interested in what are, sadly if inevitably, dark tidings. They ask more about things. The six older elves are dismissive - talk and rumour.

The younger groups are sad that people only come to them for 'advice' - they're a smaller nation but that doesn't mean they can't act, too! The elders of course recommend the opposite.

And then the classic pub discussion. They ask about elven peoples in the Sword Coast. Talk turns to methods of governance, kingdoms vs democracies and so forth.

We ask, what would they do? Their perspective is that they've abandoned Elven Court before. The trees around are a few hundred years old (Riglan nature 26); none of the buildings or trees before exist; a few hundred years ago, another battle and, from that, abandonment. Nobody alive remembers the original Elven Court, which was truly ancient - when the Drow first separated from the Elves. It was a nascent seed of the Elven kingdom of Cormanthor, more than 10,000 years ago. It is recorded only in song.

Quietly, to Riglan, he is astonished. He never thought of elves as being - to him - callous, in regards to the forest. "It's OK, it'll regrow". It's a hallmark of the fact that older elves here are essentially refugees from Myth Drannor, who have seen their homes destroyed before. This is a community of homeless. They do not feel such a strong connection.

"A forest is not its trees. It is the sum part of everything that grows and lives in it. An organism in itself. Parts of it can be damaged, just like you or your companions can take an injury. But as long as enough of you remains healthy, you repair and you  recover. We do not view individual trees. The forest is one."

Riglan doesn't get into it, but that's a great insight. He must make it clear - the *forest* is sick. The entire thing. Not just the trees.

Two bottles of wine down, 20gp total, one of which was much older - 30 years old or so, and Temo was more into it than the other - we finish up, thank them all for their company and return to the "room". Before we go, they tell us about a market, library and - tellingly - they mention communal baths!

It's hard under the canopy to tell time of day, but as we make our way along the boughs and platforms, we hear two horns played in harmony. We see a few elves popping heads out of buildings, waving to each other and starting to ascend trees. We ask a passing elf what it means and are invited up with them! "You must be new here. You must not miss this, it's beautiful!"

Vine-carried swings carry us to the canopy. We climb onto stronger branches. Riglan helps his friends find good ones. Everyone is facing West, to the sunset. Perception 11, he's surprisingly disorientated, but he thinks he can make out that to the East, in the darker sky, there is water on the horizon? Riglan says, "I'll be right back!" and wildshapes into an hawk. He flys up high. Adv perception 3,7+10->17, still not great but better. To the East and slightly South, he recognises the jutting-out Eastward part of the forest from his map, where the seas are. North is the Moonsea, just visible. West, something on the horizon that's probably the mountain ranges. He comes back down and shifts back, explaining where we are in more detail. He's already flying back down into the shade as the sunset is nearly finished.

People stay up until the sky goes dark and we're happy to hang out with them. They point out constellations to each other. Riglan, perception 27; he finds the four stars of the Shepherds.

### 7:30pm

Now we continue again back to our "room". When we get there, there's an elf sat cross-legged, apparently waiting. He gets up at our arrival. "I'm a messenger" "Hello!" "I bring news that the Council will see you first thing in the morning" - he hands us a piece of parchment.

Riglan sees that it's *The Queen's Counsel* - not a *Council*. We'd got that wrong. He thanks the messenger and is relieved it's not tonight - he's not at his best.

We realise that we must've been quite a sight - and people being polite about it - since we were straight out of battle and pretty messed up. Rather than mess up the baths, we use the cleaning stone, mending spells and so-on to get our kit in order and then, to get our bodies in order, take an early night and sleep.

Before bed, Riglan figures he can blow a high level spell (lowers all spent) on upcast Greater Restoration to try and reduce his exhaustion by 1.

Temo sets up an Alarm, just in case, but we don't put up a watch... Surely there are enough people around?

**That night, Riglan: Wisdom saving 22, a dream, remembered.**

It's quite simple. He "wakes up", sensing someone standing next to him. It's one of the druids, in his cave - he's back home. "I've been waiting for you to rise. Come." "OK!"

The druid leads Riglan out. Two other druids are there. There is no village here - right place, but no tribe and no sign of habitation. Just the old, empty caves. They lead him to a clearing where there are four Rocs; Riglan mounts one and all four of us ascend. Huge forests, ancient; how things once were, years ago. Clearly this is an ancient time. In amongst the huge trees are giants - but these giants are gardeners, tending to trees. One group is seen defending some kind of mountain fortress along the Spine, which curiously seems much higher here - the mountains taller - but the forests climbing up much further, more lush. The keep is being assaulted by some young dragons.

The rocs give the battle a wide berth. We end up flying over a lush jungle/swamp, the ancient precursor to the Sea Of Fallen Stars, but much bigger and more flooded at this time, small islands floating. It's very hard to recognise but from the 'feeling' provided by the dream. Where Sembia and Cormyr are today, there is just water. Again, there are huge forests on any land. The four Rocs perch atop a mountain in the middle of the forest - the Thunderpeaks, Riglan thinks, but also much higher somehow - and the druids point out that this time was the birth of the glory of the elves. This is when they rise - just as the kingdoms of the giants fall.

There's one noble line, the **Meritar**, from which the **Meritaryi** descended, and these were the elves that gave magic to the humans who became the Netherese. Four independent kingdoms exist - Elven Court, Semberholme and two others since fallen - the **Tel'quessir**, the elves who migrated to the material plane from the fey wild; and their cousins or ancestors, the **Eladin**, who stayed in the fey wild.

"It is this connection that *you* have through the staff" - Riglan is connected to the fey wild. The elves draw their power from it too. Ilpharn was an elven nation, so the staff's power has the same basis; and since the fey is the realm of dreams (vs the Shadowfell realm of nightmares), Riglan's connection to the staff connects him to dreams.



## Day 43: Elven Court
### 7am

In the morning we wake up rested and refreshed. Riglan describes his dream. He has an idea; we've focused so much on armies, people, and protective magic for ourselves - but come up wanting on that front and yesterday's battle was a good example of why that's still a problem - but his dream reminds him that perhaps we should also be focusing on magic. **Anything that's based on the Fey might be in direct opposition to the Shadowfell**.

We make tea awkwardly. We don't know if fires are possible in this tree, but instead use the cook's utensils to hold a flask of water that's heated by Produce Flame. We manage to make both tea and porridge. Temo puts on his Lord's Alliance clothing; Riglan tries to look a bit smarter too. Maireagh's just in armour, which makes sense. Weapons are stowed, though. Nethza likewise.

We pack everything up and wonder if we're meant to wait to be collected, or just go to the 'counsel'; we read note again. We're "invited to attend" the Queen's Council - and there is a time, 8:30am. We just do our best to guess the time - Riglan's fairly comfortable in forests under the canopy - and make our way to the room we were shown yesterday. On arrival, we see Llysandra and Seraddin are already there, dressed in new robes. We are greeted. Llysandra tells us not to worry about protocol - we speak and he'll mediate.

We're led down this time, to what they call a "central tree" and into a hollow. There are more stairs inside, this time going up. We emerge inside what seems to be a fully formed building - no missing walls or roof! - 25ft high ceiling, rose window in stained glass, Art Nouveau styling of flowers and leaves in wood carvings; butterfly and flower motifs all over too. A big table sits centrally with lots of chairs around. There are five people already here; 2 sat, 3 standing. Four seats are free along one side with a fifth for the attendant, so we take those. The herald stands at the back.

Wine is poured. (It's 8:30am...). We wait...

...and fairly soon after a side-door opens. In glides a pale gold-skinned elf with braided silver-blonde hair. She wears a fitted sort-of-dress; an elven affair, fairly complex but sleek with a short train. She is announced by all the heralds simultaneously as Coronal **Ilsevele Meritar**. Two guards accompany her, standing behind at a short distance. She arrives with her back to the rose window and uses Mage Hand to pull out a chair, stands at the table - we all stand too - then uses the hand to pull the chair in. She sits and invites the attendees to do the same. Adv history, only (3,8+5); Riglan thought the Meritaryi left and went West. Clearly not all of them!

"So, Queen's Counsel has been called. Who do we have?" she says, speaking slowly; she's using a high Elven which Riglan understands, but the rest of his party has no idea.

The Heralds announce the various groups.

* The Elfguard are represented by a pair of elves that includes the Captain
* The Emeritus of Semberholme is present (!)
* The First Counsel and Second Counsel to the Coronel
* The Keeper of Songs (who arrived later)
* Us four, general muggles
* The Captain of the Elven Court Watch (who arrived later)
* There's one empty chair

The queen asks who is missing! People aren't sure but then we hear running feet and the doors are flung open as a younger female elf runs in, bows, apologises, "I am late, it is inexcusable..." - the Coronal says it's fine, tells her to take a seat. The heralds don't seem to know her name so she has to announce herself!

* **Tallacan**, a representative from the Border Patrol

Llysandra stands and lays out (in Elven) the situation as surmised by his conversation with us the prior day. Matters of great urgency, corroborated reports and so-on. We are called out for saving five of the patrol members.

The Coronal looks to our group. "Who among you will speak for your party?"

Riglan responds in Elven, "My friend Temo here has status within the Sword Coast, but does not speak Elven; is it permissible to speak Common?"

There's some murmuring. "What language is Common?" she asks, so Riglan says in Common, "The one I'm speaking now, this is the only name by which it is known to us." There's agreement.

Temo thanks them for permitting him to speak that way. He introduces the group and says that we're here to give counsel with as much info as possible so the Coronal can make a decision about what she wants to do. Apparently that's quite unusual - people usually open with a request!

Temo is invited to explain, then, the details. And he does so.

The room is listening, waiting for him to finish. There's quiet, as if people are waiting for someone to speak first. Nobody takes that up! The Coronal speaks instead, then. "There are many layers of assumptions here that I am struggling to piece together. It is a tangled web which you describe. Difficult to see and discern where these threads go." She thinks for a moment then asks her Counsellors "what do you make of the story? What parts are significant?"

The First throws some questions at us which we do our best to answer. They're mostly around trying to determine facts.

She says she wasn't on Feyrun when Azalin first arrived. Some of the wider group of Counsellors were, so she'll seek further information from those but questions those of the Counsellors here. At this, to try and "fill in gaps" - truth vs not truth, which *we* think is accurate but might not be - various divination spells begin. There are obfuscations over their own borders and Dragonreach, which we clarify - **yes, that means agents are probably in Cormanthor too.**

They do think that the corruption of the forest here is more likely to be from local agents and not from under the ocean, so many miles away. "So maybe we can track down these agents and kill them!" says Riglan. At this Tallacan pipes up - a deep breath in - then starts speaking quickly in Elven. She's not following a lot because she's not very bilingual (fair!). Riglan does his best to explain all of it, but Tallacan asks - why kill us? Why destroy the forest; the dead outnumber the living 1000:1 or more.

That leads to our previous theorising that older bodies - just skeletons perhaps - are unusable, or less powerful. The room agrees - "less powerful" one opines.

One wants to test a theory. He asks Riglan about himself and his tribe. Riglan confirms that. They then talk about the giants and their gardeners, who escaped to the Fey during the collapse of their civilisation. Those that were good shrank over generations, became the Firbolg! He's literally a little giant. They emerged in this forest. **All Firbolg have a connection here.** "So what I'm going to ask you may be painful and do not go further than you wish to - but we have been suppressing the corruption in Elven Court, but I am going to lift that suppression momentarily here, on this wall... I would like you to try and channel your fey magic through the wall... Whatever it is that you feel comfortable doing. A growth of plants, light, webs, whatever. This is way to test my theory."

We go to a section of wall and a magical ward is withdraw. Riglan immediately senses a creeping vein of black immediately flowing up into it, slowly, but from all sides. The other elves in the room look startled at the effect, faint tho definite that it is.

Riglan tries to throw everything into it. The firbolg magic inante Bless is used to boost his powers then he uses *everything the staff has* to cast Druid Grove. Everything it's got. He pushes, *hard*, but feels a strange cracking in the wall instead; it tries to heal, but cracks again; the spell is just not working; it cannot be completed. Eventually Riglan staggers back from the wall, which has now cracked wide from the stress, out of breath and unable to do it - "It won't work, I just can't do it..." and is shocked, the staff spent, but the spell wasted.

"It is as I feared. The corruption cuts off the font of our magic. It is **not** to kill. It is to weaken. To disable. If it is allowed to fully take hold, those of us who rely on the earth's magic - not the arcane, but the dryads, the sylvan, the druids, the rangers - they would be left defenceless." 

Riglan answers "Myself included."

"We would be restricted to the arcane - the same magic that Azalin himself wields. He must be confident he has mastered it."

Riglan says, "I had hoped that there might be the idea of using fey magic in large amounts to combat the Shadowfell or dark magic at least that he seems to wield; yet it appears that he's well ahead of me in this idea. He wants to cut that off."

Tallacan says, "That explains why some fey paths are crumbling. They're closed to us and we didn't understand why."

Riglan answers, "We must find out how he's doing this. And stop it. We have about 10 days."

First and Second Counsel agree. The Coronal just patiently waits for advice, not making any decisions. "We are in agreement, then. We will make that happen. What do the Border Patrol require? What resources do you need? We will provide what we can."

* Sensors - ways to detect, start focusing on obfuscated areas
* Bigger questions though.

"It appears Cormyr is planning to march through Cormanthor?"

Temo says "Probably through your Westernmost reaches, if you permit."

Semberholme is asked if it will open their borders; they will if the Coronal wishes; she does; "then it shall be done".

The Elfguard voice a concern. "Should we not be joining them? The Cormyrean army, like ours, has not recovered although they procreate faster than we do. It has not been enough time for them to replenish."

Riglan says, "Temo said we had no requests. This stands. All I can do is tell you what we know. And we know that the Empress opined that her forces alone would be insufficient. And she sent them anyway."

More to-and-fro. Why not meet with all armies at the shores of the sea? We explain the logistics; people concur. Then there's why Zhentil Keep? He fell there before. Yes - and there the bodies all still lie. Then there is religious talk of *Seldarine*; Temo has the helm on now, as they speak quickly and in Elven exclusively. Religion 19.

"...If the old runes and lines there still exist, there could be a way to amplify magic. Harness the mithil and project multiple high level castings of something like Gentle Repose, using Elven Court as the source..." - as best Temo (on that roll) understands arcana and religion, he thinks that might work; the spell, if cast, prevents dead bodies from being raised. That at least would give us a big advantage at Zhentil Keep. And it might at least throw him off balance a little. But to do this, to achieve such a large scale and solid projected casting, surely Elven Court must be cleaned of corruption? Yes. And that's another reason why it's being done.

The Coronal says, "I will not ask of our elves to lay their lives down for us again. But I will send a conscription notice out, by volunteer, that those who wish to defend the realm will have our eternal gratitude. The Elfguard we can commit, but the Elfguard are but 500."

The Emeritus of Semberholme says they'll return there to speak with the old kingdom. "If anything, we will need someone to travel to the ruins of Myth Drannor and speak to the refugees there. Perhaps it is time that they rose."

The Coronal explains that they've not wanted to be part of elven politics since the Fall. Many are proud and stay in its ruins without governance or regent. Some say without any hope. "Maybe this is what could galvanise them into a nation once more." - there is a strange guilt on her face that Temo can't quite pin down. Something affects her personally.

We say that we're at her disposal; we can travel to Myth Drannor, or help fight agents; that first option does get interest - but we've also shown our prowess tackling the enemy. These two things both need immediate action. "I leave it to you to listen to your heart. Counsel; you have your orders. I must prey on this for guidance. May the Seldarine watch over us all." She stands - everyone stands - and she walks out.

Temo says to the room in general, "Is there any way for us to have a private word with the Coronal in relation to this discussion?"

The First & Second Counsel say, "That is not for us. She will only speak to those to whom she wishes to speak. You can bring a petition to her? We can carry a request?"

Temo thanks them and says the request is simple. **"To assist with Myth Drannor we'll need to understand more about what happened."** The message will be passed on.

Tallacan approaches, saying "I'm not a border patroller myself..." to Riglan in Elven. "I am actually a clerk! But I worked in a library - and I can tell you her connection to Myth Drannor if you want to listen?" Riglan says "Yes, certainly, very kind!" - he motions to Temo to don the helm - but we have to leave the room. Walk & talk.

"She's a Miritar. A direct descendent of the first Miritars, the founders of the Miritaryi branch of the elves. They did go west; to Evermeet; she has only been back and on Feyrun in the last 200 years. She rode at the head of the Evermeet elven army that came back to face the threats to the Elven kingdom along with Evereska. It was Evereska that sent word to Evermeet to request assistance. But she's had a hard time of it. Myth Drannor was ascendant. She was placed in charge. There were no Coronals for about 600 years in Cormanthor - we were basically considered a dead empire! - the sword of rulership held by nobody. Nobody deemed worthy. She came back and she fought back the fiends who were assaulting Myth Drannor. She also encouraged the repopulation of Elven Court. She galvanised Semberholme together with Myth Drannor and Elven Court, three of the four original kingdoms, the fourth just being the Tangled Trees - they kill anyone who isn't an elf and enters there borders. They hold the Meritaryi and humans fully responsible for destruction of the world; very xenophobic and purists. The Coronal was very badly affected by the fall of Myth Drannor at the end of the Second Netherese War; she saw herself as being responsible for everyone there - and far more importantly, in that final battle when the two cities crashed into each other, **she lost her husband**. The ridiculous thing is, this is what people say - that there is something more to it than just that. That her and her husband are star-crossed lovers and I've never really understood that! It sounds like they have a place in mythology. Only the High Born really know what happened there but he was the greatest of the Elven Paladins. The shining exemplar of the Elven paladin ranks and the finest of us. Yet, she left Myth Drannor without him and brought as many refugees as she could here, to Elven Court, and re-established the capital of Cormanthor here. She has never returned to Myth Drannor since, but that act of bringing people here released the Sword from the grasp of the mithil and now, wielding it, she became the Coronal and has been for the last 160 years."

And that is the penny drop for Riglan. The head says - fight the agents, fix the corruption; his own powers depend upon it. But then there's the heart. A tragedy, a people split; an opportunity to help not for the now, but perhaps for what's after.

We've done the "wrong thing" before and it's been right.

We ask Tallacan how long it takes to get to see the Coronal after a "petition" is given. She's not sure! It seems we have time to kill, but need to make sure people know where we are in case we are called for. Perhaps while we wait for Myth Drannor, we can assist with some of the divination efforts; we ask if there's a central effort where this is done? It's distributed. People are doing things in various different ways.

### 9:30am

Riglan hasn't got enough charge in the staff to commune with nature, but instead he seeks a very old tree just outside the main building; the Grand Tree in the centre is hard to miss! We set up a stone to burn incense close its base but not too close (!) and Riglan starts the ritual. His question:

**"What is the nearest place in this forest where a powerful magic makes it difficult or impossible to see what is happening to that area of forest?"**

The smoke swirls. A fog cloud forms, with a familiar feel from yesterday's battle. Then it takes on a colour, as if depicting a different place from where we are; trying to impart a sense of location. Riglan sees in his mind's eye an area with strange-looking, "goblin-y" trees covered in lichen and hanging moss, big boulders, small partly-sunken caves amongst the boulders and trees. If Riglan turns his head to see around this vision, it's just blank - the spell is unable to show us. Nothing more than that is too distinctive, so if this overall easily identified area is large, then we'll have to figure out how to narrow it down when we get there.

Riglan draws a sketch as best he can to show other people before the memory fades too much. He describes it orally to the party too so we've all got a good idea. Temo looks for a Border Patrol elf, as we think they'd be good to ask. We're told to head up to a mid-tree congregation area; a sort of common room. It takes a while to make our way up there. We start showing the sketch and describing the area; scale, style and so-on.

It takes a while to narrow down as there are few similar places, but we think it might be closer rather than further (given the question asked in the spell); along with some guesses at size, they think it's near old ruins at the edge of where Tangle Trees are. "Ruins of what?" "Some old walls, by the looks of it!" - relatively innocuous for once!

They'll lead us. A fey path gets close, but not all the way, because the Tangled Trees is the 'enemy' / unfriendly elf territory. It'll take a good hour just to reach the entrance.

On the way, we discus what we intend to find and, realising that we've no idea, we change from it being more of an attacking mission to pure stealth and recon. After all, it's not like this anti-scrying magic is centred on a creature. It's cast over an area. There might be *nothing* in there. Maireagh is happier once we've determined why-and-what. She prefers to have reasons and gets anxious and protective of everyone when Riglan and Temo seem to be just going off at random.

Eventually we reach a pair of trees that the guide points out which, when observed more closely, seem strangely multicoloured. Vivid. "Follow the vines and mushrooms and you'll be fine. Just make sure you take note of the exit location! From there, head North. You will encounter an old road - that's the road through the forest; it'll be wide, in bad condition, but might be starting to regrow and reclaim itself. Cross the road, continue North and you'll reach the Tangle Trees. You should see the ruins within about half an hour of crossing the road. And again, make sure you remember the way back!"

The guide bids us farewell and we head on along the fey path. It's a strange one. It starts with a sort of thicket, hedge wall on either side, but then that turns into trees which make it harder to figure out where the path goes - but for vines, which sort of ring around the trees and stretch between them, with some bioluminescence to them. Instead of flowers or leaves they have mushrooms sprouting from them.

We follow it for around half an hour. Then the vines are gone and we're not in the fey; as soon as this happens we turn to see the way back. Riglan, perception 16; there are various circles of mushrooms around but one is larger and almost perfectly circular. Riglan walks up and steps into it - the moment he does, the mushrooms turn into vines! They snake up nearby trees. Turning around he walks out; the vines retract. **The party tells him that he vanished! It's a portal**.

Riglan can recognise enough to get back here, especially if he talks to plants for help should it be needed.

North, then. Survival 12+10->22. It doesn't take long - maybe 20 minutes - to hit the very obvious remnant old road. A 20ft wide or so stretch of forest had once been cleared for it, but the forest is fighting back and reclaiming the space. A break in the sky gives a sense of where this road might be - 

North again! After about 20 minutes, we're climbing; then about 10 minutes later, we crest a ridge. Looking down it's a very different kind of forest! Riglan climbs a tree to get a better view. It is entirely filled with twisted pines, the distance looking strangely darker; the whole area is very large. Close by, though, is something which Riglan can understand having been described as a "wall". A large, roughly square structure, but it would be some 200ft on each side, so if it were a wall that used to be a building, the building would be huge; or perhaps it was fortification for a small village? Hard to say. The crumbled ruins of it are what form what Riglan took for boulders. We're here.

### Around midday

Seeing that the whole area must be some 400ft x 400ft given the strewn rubble's range and radius, Riglan figures we might have to spend some time here and while it's a bit of a distance from the tangled trees proper, it's close enough for him to spend 2 of the regained-this-morning 3 charges on his staff for Pass Without A Trace for the party.

We proceed slowly and quietly.

We find unusually blocky boulders that are hard to navigate - an apparent tilted rock surface turns out to be a block that terminates in a 10-15ft drop at the edge. Perhaps giants built this wall. These blocks - if "bricks" - are surely too large for many other creatures to assemble.

Riglan says, "I don't know how we find the 'missing' area here, the bit that's protected, but I do remember lots of small caves, so watch your footing".

We figure we'll start in the approximate middle and work outwards. Temo uses Detect Magic to see if he can spot anything. He does sense a general lively forest "feel", not magical, but a low-level sort of necromantic overlay; describing this to Riglan (who sees things differently using the same spell) leads Riglan to say that it's probably the corruption. Other than that, there's a lack of magic, generally ahead. Something suppressive; a faint feel; he follows his nose, the party communicating but whispering.

Riglan recognises this area now. It *does* look like the divination - the blocks are less obviously square here as he thinks many blocks crashed from the two angled main walls, rolling towards each other, some smashing into ones already here. They're more rounded and more weathered, the further from the wall implying falling from a higher starting point too. The caves appear to be the result of all this heavy rock movement - not big deep caves or underdark, just gaps in the stacked-up boulders. The true forest floor is probably a fair distance below us. That *does* mean lots of places to hide something.

Temo perception (with luck point, first roll is 2) 15+6->21 -> senses we're not alone! His sling gives him a warning, but low; an arrow flies past his ear! It's not aimed at him. THUNK! Hits the boulder behind. He sees an elf in the distance, very dark brown skin; half-crouched, bow at the ready; another behind. Very different form of dress - big leaves, tied together; braided hair; camo, basically.

"Move no further!" they say - which Riglan translates - and we adopt a very hands-off-weapons deferential posture.

The one Temo spotted notches another arrow and has it ready to fire - but it's not aimed *behind* Temo anymore. It's aimed straight at his head.

"Explain why you are wandering so close to our territory. If you cross the boundary, we are exercise our ancestral rights to remove you with force from life!"

Riglan actually chuckles at that, despite himself. He says, "We have no intent to trespass."

"You corrupt our forest."

"We investigate and seek to cure the corruption."

"You can only cure the corruption by removing all non-Tel'quessir from the ancestral lands."

Riglan says, "We are not of elf kind, as you can plainly see. We have no allegiances either way, except to the path of good. A force of evil, ancient, known as Azalin Rex rises once again and at this very moment walks below the Sea of Fallen Stars. This corruption is his doing. If you have scrying magic, you will have noticed blind spots in the forest. That is how he hides the root of the corruption. There is a blind spot here, which we seek. We could use your help!"

Persuasion is only 7! No good. But insight, a high 19+10->29. They have a seething hatred, but one that is taught - as in, learned, indoctrinated - unquestioned. They aren't seeking us, they weren't looking for us; this is simply a patrol.

Riglan says, "Will you allow us to investigate this area, keep watch on us, and warn us so that we do not cross into your land?"

They exchange glances and retreat a little. "That is an acceptable proposition for now. But we watch you. Do not attempt to enter our kingdom. And you cannot stay here."

Riglan nods; "Thank you. We will not stay. And if we do venture into your borders, we have no doubt you will shoot us and justifiably so."

Riglan explains quickly to the party and gets Temo to follow the "lack of magic" again, and see where we go. Riglan shouts ahead, "We are walking forward, as this is where the blind spot appears to be, but *will not* cross your border." Fingers crossed!

Riglan reaches the edge of his vision! He finds the exact spot, astonishing luck. The area he couldn't see would have been the rear wall of the "fort". Temo walks "into" the zone and as soon as he does he stops being able to detect magic at all. It seems to be actively suppressed completely. He walks towards the "side wall"; as he gets outside the area of the ruins, he sees magic again; then the spell fails. He goes back to the party, re-casts then walks the other way - finds something similar after a while. He surmises that this is a kind of "flat edge" effect some 500ft wide end to end. We don't know how "deep" it is.

Riglan thinks a moment then calls out, "Does the corruption get worse that way? About 200, 250ft?"

Again there are some exchanged glances and clearly a degree of exasperation. There even seems to be a bit of arguing. There is clearly a bit of a mixed opinion here. Riglan strains to hear the whispered, at-distance conversation; perception 18+10 -> 28; one seems to he giving up on another one and retreats back into the tangled trees. That other one moves closer though and yells out... "I can only say one thing to you and then I must leave. There is no corruption in the tangled trees. It is coming from outside. You are causing the corruption. You are trying to destroy our kingdom! I can say no more and I am not permitted to talk to outsiders."

He runs back into the tangled trees. So... Either this is within the 60ft or so strip between what would've been the far wall and before those trees, or we're screwed because we can't go deeper. Divination magic doesn't work. He talks to trees instead... They are sick. The corruption has been spreading for a few weeks now. He asks which tree was first to feel its effects amongst their kind, nearby? The trees think so. It is to the South-West. We head that way, to see what he can see!

Speaking to this tree - which got sick a day before - it says it caught it from a neighbouring tree. *Those* trees say they caught it from a large tree further to the South from them, one of the "mother" trees, with a common link. Riglan tries that next. We're back up towards the ridge by this point. It's a beautiful, large tree; a big maple, towering; but leaves are being lost and it's clearly sickly. Trees around it seem perhaps even *more* sick than it; it's trying to nourish them but as it gets more ill, the drain of the sickness cycles.

This tree is old and weak. It felt the corruption spread from over the ridge. Most of the trees say they feel like the corruption came from the south.

This doesn't make any sense.

Maireagh suggests that it seems the blind spots and the corruption might actually be unrelated; or at least the assumption they hide the source is wrong; certainly seems so! Riglan is interested in - since we're here - pursuing the chain of infection, but Nethza suggests perhaps more divination. Gods of the forest might have other advice?

Riglan finds easily a big block to burn the incense, lights it and for expediency casts Divination directly. He says, "Our question is difficult; we have many questions, few answers, and perhaps the forest itself may provide some inspiration or insight that helps us find our way - what should we do?"

It doesn't help; we cannot decipher the answer. The forest speaks tells Riglan that it is in pain and poisoned, that much is going wrong, that it is fearful; it wants us to help. Essentially we must do many, many things at the same time all at once! No one move will "win", it seems; chess; any move we make would be countered by a prepared response. So it suggests moving many chess pieces simultaneously.

Nethza tries to contact the Raven Queen, reaching out with her high level magic. She can only do this once every *few* days (1d10). She is unresponsive for about five minutes; we stand watch around her, to keep her safe.

When she "comes to" - "that was strange! Very odd. I had a vision of us investigating the anti-magic area, but we weren't us, we were elves."

Riglan says, "They can't be *that* easy to fool - just illusion - surely?"

"They're just trying to stop anyone who's *not* a Tel'quessir; but other than that, I don't think they care."

If we're going to disguise ourselves, we should hide first. PWAT is still up and they're surely still watching, so we figure we go over the ridge. That's probably when they spotted us. Once over the other side...

...Riglan can Disguise as an elf. Temo can be invisible. In fact Maireagh could make a few people invisible, *or* Intellect Fortress in case of mind-reading. But we think mind-reading might fall foul of the anti-scrying, and detecting illusion or invisibility surely would. So we can in fact all be invisible, meaning just one elf apparently with nobody else accompanying them. We strafe to the East to get to that "corner" of the keep once over the ridge and we say we'll walk along the outside of that all, essentially just beyond the Eastern edge of the field, then as soon as we reach the back wall, we know we'll enter the "dead zone" since it extended a bit beyond the wall's reach.

Nethza can go invisible at will. Maireagh uses L3 to hide herself and the dog. Temo casts on himself. Riglan "becomes" an amalgam of the elves he saw.

Off we go! Riglan follows the path. PWAT still has a few minutes later and, thank goodness; adv.stealth (5,6+0) -> 6 only, but +10 for PWAT; 16. Temo, nat 20+16 -> 36! Nethza 30 too. Maireagh 14+10 -> 24.

Riglan's made a less of it but at least the invisible people are well hidden. Upon reaching the dead zone he sees one of the elves from before - but they ignore him and apparently focus on scanning the ridge line. He goes diagonally to estimate the rough E-W centre, then N into the Tangled Trees. Survival Nat 20+10 -> 30! He's assuming it's all a square and aiming for the middle.

The trees have a darkness to them but it seems innate. At a cluster of five trees, he talks to one. "How are you feeling? Are you well?" - the trees are wilder, less polite. Brusque. They're in great health, but sense there is corruption in the forest. They can hear and feel how damaged things are. "Have courage and protect each other as best you can. We are trying to help heal the forest." Insight 8+10->18. The trees suggest there is something going on in this area; not corruption but *something*. It's choking them a bit; "a blockage in the ley lines"; Riglan asks if they know which tree is closest. Not sure; just a general sense of tension.

Riglan searches for and finds a rabbit. It's very nervous. "What worries you, rabbit?" "There are weird predators around." "Do they come from a particular place, or all around?" "They come from underground. They come out at night and snatch our young. They don't eat us! They just kill." "Head South, to the strange stones with many gaps. There are many places to hide there."

It indicates that they might spring from a particular place and he heads there. Back to the area of five trees where he was before. Perception, only 17; this feels like the right area; the trees don't look unusual; Riglan tries touching them; they're real. Now he tries the ground, patting around to see if there's anything odd there; perception 17+10->27, much better. He suddenly notices blood on his hands! He feels around and discovers a *spiral of blood* in between the five trees here.

Temo, arcana only 9, but it might not be religious; so, then, religion 25. It might be linked to things we've read - a form of very old mysticism, linked to ritual magic. This is where arcana and religion meet. This he thinks is some sort of summoning sigil - it calls wild forces of darkness here, which is probably what the rabbit saw. But to what end? What for? It's not the source of the corruption, or does not seem so.

"Can it be dispelled?" he asks. And then tries thinking about magic again - arcana again - and bizarre rolls today; another nat 20+5. He's an arcane caster who "feels" the weave and, here, it has been "pulled in" by this blood spiral and knotted; a vortex almost; a permanent knot in the weave here. It is being held in place by the ritual somehow.

It's channeling the weave to create a sort of doorway. He describes it as a doorstop.

It could be dispelled if we wanted to stop the vortex, he thinks. But we don't know what that'll do - if it would alert Azalin's forces. We don't know why this is here. If they *do* need closing, it's possible they should all be closed at once. It seems we can get back here if we need to, so we retreat while our disguises and invisibility are still holding. 

### Very roughly 1pm

We get back over the ridge and confer. We rack our brains but while Temo's description makes us pretty sure we know *what* the effect is, we can only guess why it's there and figure it'd be too foolish to try and dispell it without understanding if it might have repercussions elsewhere. Maireagh urges us to discuss facts. We note down what we have and feel the only way to fill in more of the picture is to get other pieces of the puzzle from other people.

Riglan wants to pursue the train of infection while we're here. The mother tree leads us south of the ridge. Then it gets more tricky. The path is less clear. Riglan and the patient rest of his party spend around two hours, speaking to around 50 trees. Maireagh can't really deal with that kind of boredom so makes a map of the trees and results. The sense is that the rot spreads through the forest through the oldest trees. They seem to be the main vectors of infection; they're most powerful, the most widely connected and have the furthest reach (around 8 of the 50 were such trees). All of those caught from another tree, so this is thoroughly decentralised and we get no leads at all on a source, apart from to say that there could be a "patient zero" tree.

It takes a fair time to retrace steps, but we find our way back to the fey path and Elven Court, arriving in the early evening.

### Around 5 or 6pm

We ask around for Tallacan. She's not around but the person we speak to is a border patrol ranger and encourages us to fill them in on the details of what we did. We describe the techniques used to find an anti-scrying area, 500x500ft roughly square, central was a sort of forced-open portal to another realm, apparently with evil beasts that come out at night and kill forest creatures indiscriminately. We hope this can be passed on to other people looking for the anti-scrying areas.

We also show the map of trees and ask if that's of any use; has anyone else been plotting connections of infection? They've got a rough sense of it but not in that kind of detail. They do know it spreads through the oldest trees already (that's just the nature of a forest).

The ranger describes that the 40-or-so border patrols are still patrolling. The forest still needs guarding, so they will cover the "dead" anti-scrying areas only when they get to them. In total it could take 4-5 weeks! But the earliest patrols may return in 3-4 days. The Coronal might take days to respond to our request for an audience even if she does *at all*, and might not be willing to talk much more about Myth Drannor anyway. Riglan opines that maximising time there to get to know those people - if they'll have us! - might be the best way to encourage them to join in the "war effort" to which the Coronal has already committed the up-to-maybe-500 Elfguard and any volunteers.

Maireagh and Temo examine the "what we know" facts. The "doorway" they found she discusses; we were told that things were being torn up by the rabbit. Yet, *there were no carcasses* - so things are being brought "back" to whatever that domain is. Whatever comes through and why ever it does that, things are taken back. It's a door. There's only one way to know what's behind it. After to-and-fro, Riglan decides; we spent today gathering info that seemed to have no thread. Now it does. It can be time not wasted. Myth Drannor might have to wait one more day.

We don't know how to open the door but we know it opens at night from the rabbit. If we leave now...

...we pack our stuff and head out in a hurry!
