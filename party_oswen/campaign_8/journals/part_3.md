# Oswen: Part 1.3
## Day 2 (well, past midnight at the Carnival into day 3)

We've done everything at the carnival, pretty much! We have gained a lot of insight into the strange goings-on, but lots of questions remain.

Leonidas had all his ticket fully punched a while ago and now, Oswen has used up all of hers. We could by more, but there's no need because it's almost time - we think the Monarch will be announced soon. Oswen and her new friends are hopeful she might win, simply so that she can ask for a gift / favour - to be given access to the portal to Prismeer (which we still seek, despite now knowing it has been shattered into three domains by the Hourglass Coven.

### Beginning of the 8th hour

We've only just finished talking to Diana; the Calliope plays a fanfare; bright lights start shining onto and from inside the Big Top - everyone starts running there. Even the displacer beast **Dirlagraun** at Lost & Found bounds over towards the staff area; we see it in the distance escorting Mr Witch from the wagon. Mr Light is already at the Big Top, welcoming people. We hurry over. Thaco seems to be left to guard the staff area, we see distantly; Burly comes out and heads towards us as well. Pixies and butterflies all start to fly in - *everyone* it seems, more or less, is there!

Inafina excuses herself - she has another performance to do, she remembers! With all the excitement she'd almost forgotten. She rushes off.

In the Big Top, it's standing room only. Kindle tries to jostle for position. Oswen says she could sit on Leonidas' shoulders or Kindle's - Leonidas agrees the latter makes more sense! ACRO 15+2->17, she climbs up nimbly and sits atop the big Bugbear.

Flaming torches, knives, bowling pins thrown around by acrobats. Then seals, on hind flippers, giving shows of "intelligent" behaviour which Oswen finds odd but recognises many "normal" human townsfolk might be impressed by - after all, there's every chance those seals are in fact simply people!

Mr Witch and Dirlagraun take centre stage. Lots of the usual pleasantries and excitement building. "One last extravaganza for you - this is the final show!"

Inafina positions herself awkwardly at a difficult starting point (ACRO only 4+5->9) but from there starts her performance and it's great (PERF 17). It's a gladiatorial battle with her staff, but on a tightrope, hanging high above the ground. There's not even a safety net! (Oswen knows _about_ Feather Fall, but can't cast it herself)... Confetti and cotton candy sprays out of canons, curtains come down, light dims, spotlights converge on the centre. 

Mr Witch and Dirlagraun, having been compares, now step to the side. Mr Light twirls into the middle. "At every Witchlight Carnival it has been tradition to honour the being - the creature - the *entity* - that does the most to bring lightness and joy into the world - which is the very thing the Witchlight Carnival exists for. It is only fitting that we crown this entity as the **Witchlight Monarch**!"

Pixies fly out with streamers behind them. Mr Light says, "Mr Witch, you ready?" "Yes!" - he taps his cane. Candlefoot cartwheels out from back stage while throwing a box in the air, keeping it airborne while summersaulting. He bows and holds out the box. Inside looks like a huge cake. Mr Witch puts his hand through the cake and pulls out a crown made of golden butterflies, with wings flapping lazily. "Do we have a monarch tonight?" asks Mr Witch. Mr Light makes a show of waving his wand around the wand, as if searching. Oswen realises he's actually casting a spell of some kind; a thread of golden light is being spun. It starts to float into the air, looking like a golden aurora borealis.

It settles above Oswen!

Everyone turns to look at her, with a gasp. Leonidas is beaming. Oswen looks down to Kindle and says, "But maybe it's you!"

She overhears some of Leonidas' friends pointing and saying, "Oswen". This is what she had to do, but she feels very exposed - very self conscious - and is happy, but anxious in equal amounts. The light gathers around her and she levitates, floating towards the stage! Mr Light says, "My my!" giving her a knowing look. He bends down and says "Young lady, what is your name?" - she plays along - "Oswen Hafflethwaite!"

Mr Light shouts to the audience, "Oswen Hafflethwaite! Or should I say, *Monarch* Hafflethwaite!"

The crown is placed on her head. The pixies shower down glitter. Palasha's fishbowl is rolled out and singing starts. As the song concludes, Mr Witch & Mr Light tell Oswen we have to hold hands. So she stands in the middle holding their hands and she's paraded around! She's taken out of the Big Top, into the main carnival area, everyone else spilling out behind. Burly is setting off fireworks. Oswen tries to look happy for the show but it's very overwhelming!

Eventually it all dies down. Mr Witch & Mr Light ask - "What is the monarch's Heart's Desire?" - there's a capitalisation somehow of the H and D. That sounds ominous, given fey magic, but she has no choice.

"I know Prismeer is split into three. But I must go there anyway, in search of answers and to try and help my friends" - she squeezes their hands - "*ALL* of my friends. My heart's desire is to know the location and password of the portal that resides within this very carnival."

Insight - nat 20 + 1 -> 21. A range of emotions from them. Relief; concern; a sadness...? Relief that she knows what that of which they cannot speak. Concern as they worry what lies in wait for her in Prismeer - for they *must* fulfil the request of a Heart's Desire which is within their power to grant. And the sadness, because of what may happen. Not just to her, but for them, too. It's out of their hands. That sadness is connected to a regret, or a guilt.

"Surely you are not braving the crossing alone, child?"

She says, "All of life is risk. You took a risk, so now I take one too. But we *know* that things which are born of shadow do not have to stay in shadow. And even if one cannot live in the light every minute of every day, there must surely be ways to spend some time in both light and dark, so that each is appreciated for its contrast. But it is true, I would prefer not to be alone - so if you would permit me, I made friends in this carnival that I would dearly like to join me. But they work for you, so your permission must be sought."

Inafina says, "I will go and guard her."

Kindle says, "I will bring the warmth of the hearth of Yondalla, such that she will never be far from home."

"Then we release you from the carnival and thank you for your service. In the pursuit of happiness..." - each is handed a small bag, with 25gp in! The they say, "Inafina, Kindle - gather your things. Meet us outside the Hall Of Illusions just after the carnival closes. You must depart tonight, if you are to depart at all."

The two hurry off to pack. Mr Witch & Mr Light head to their caravan.

"Just us two again" says Leonidas this time. He looks at his feet, awkward.

"I would bring you with us, but it's so dangerous, and you have so much to look forward to here! I - I never expected to - feel like this about you after tonight."

"Isn't it interesting, what knowing that something has a brief chance to burn bright, can do for inhibitions? The freedom to live without consequence and what we choose to do with it. If only we could always live life with such abandon. To love so freely. To act so boldly."

"You're more of a poet and philosopher than I thought! When *we* are together, I suggest we continue to be free and bold. I'll be back. You will have your own life, and I certainly would not expect you to wait. But if the stars have it in our future, perhaps we'll pick up where we left off."

He smiles. "I know that you are looking for something; a place to call home. And sure, if you do find it, I will be very happy for you. And if you do come back, I'll be very glad for you - no matter how old I'll be then. I will always remember... We will always have tonight."

And *this* is the moment when Oswen's heart truly sinks. She'd forgotten about the time factor. He will age much quicker.

"Yes, time. There is that. We have one last hour. Let's make the most of it. What did you enjoy the best, out of the rides?"

"I would love to lie in the gondola with you, watch the stars and imagine the beautiful life that - for one night - could be real. To live a lifetime in an hour."

Without a word she leads him to the gondolas. Feathereen sees us coming, pecks and pushes her way to the front and we alight. Oswen says, "Good to see you. One last loop, please." "Yes, of course!"

We lie watching the stars. Feathereen interrupts our musings occasionally with strange metaphysical side quests! Leonidas talks for the most part... What the house would look like, what our children would be called, our favourite food, the crazy music band he discovers, the places we go that we always wanted to see. The family holidays. Running away from difficult relatives! Even the fights - then the making up. We talk too of the autumn years, of rest, of looking back at a life fulfilled, shared together. The peace and contentment and how it feels to be ready - happy, even - to move to the next life.

As we pull back to the jetty, we can feel people packing. The crown tingles as the butterflies grow restless. Feathereen says, "The carnival must be ending!" and Oswen thanks her, and we hurry.

On the way she says to Leonidas, "Just promise one thing. If you can."

"Yes?"

"If it is a long time - if I end up gone years - please, *please* don't be alone, waiting for that life we just lived. We already lived it, in our heads. I'd hate to think you might just be waiting... And hoping on something that might not happen, for I have no control over it!"

"You're right. We've already lived it. If you don't return soon, I will always have that."

"As will I."

He holds her hand one last time, turns to her and says, "**Don't let what could have been ever stand in the way of what could be, Oswen.**"

A long, deep kiss; gentle and caring, though.

Oswen says, "Be bold, dearest Leonidas. And be free."

The crown starts to lift off her head and heads towards the tents, just as we reach the Hall. Inafina stands there patiently, Kindle less patiently! We call out, "We're here! We're here now!" - Mr Witch is looking disapprovingly at his watch.

He leands down says quietly, "Everythingm you seek and more lies in the mirrors beyond this door. If you mean to step through, then stand of any glass and repeat this: **Hither, thither, here and there, wander yonder - show me where**. Are you ready?"

Oswen nods. "Ready."

"Then let's go." - he takes her in. She notices that Palasha, Candlefoot, Burly, the Dwarven inventor from the mine and Diana are all somehow nearly too, watching this unfold. Oswen calls back, "Please look after Leonidas for me..." then to Leonidas - "...we will meet again."

They're giving Inafina and Kindle hugs, wishing them good will, "perhaps we will encounter each other again, somewhere on the great wheel", says one.

Perception 16+1->17. We go past the strange normal mirrors, then past the magical mirrors. They're taking us towards the back. Their reflections are very different.

* Two reflections for each of Mr Witch and Mr Light
* In front, a gloomy, Shadar Kai child; Mr Witch's is a homeless-looking orphan holding a small cup with some coppers, selling broadsheets, holding a broom; Mr Light's is a gloomy-looking, immaculately dressed noble child, looking very, very rich, but walking along sullen, surrounded by adults doting on him but at the same time kind of ignoring him - as if, from the moment he was born, he was destined to follow his father's footsteps, whether he wants to or not
* The reflections start in different mirrors but eventually meet up, walking side by side
* Behind these reflections are the others - an old Mr Witch and Mr Light; indistinct, smudgy, slightly faceless; shifting; one moment in carnival dress, but in another wearing black leather as old Shadar Kai servants of the Raven Queen; battle worn and scarred.

We reach one very beautiful mirror in particular and stand on either side of it. "Now you look after her. We hope to see you back" they say to Kindle and Inafina.

Oswen says, "I don't know if you saw your reflections, but they told me something important. Your future is unset. It's unknown. Anything could happen."

Then she says, loudly but a bit quickly due to nerves, "Hither, thither, here and there, wander yonder - show me where!"

She's about to step through when Mr Light leans down - "Just one moment Oswen; let them through first..." - so she lets Inafina, then Kindle through. Just as she's about to step through herself, Mr Witch and Mr Light lean down. Mr Witch says, "**Remember! Mind the rule of three; future, present, past.**" Then Mr Light, whispering, almost in great pain - she sees blood come out of his eyes! - "**Find the Alicorn and free the dormant queen at last**" - that's all he manages to force himself to say and she steps through.

Oswen steps through, but by the time she reaches the other side, she's fallen unconscious from the shock of the crossing.

### 300 XP -> LEVEL 2; crossing counts as a long rest.



## Day 3 (but now on Fey Wild time)

Infina went first. She steps through, then she feels strangely comfortable and warm on her fur; she's curled up and remembers sunlight at "just that time" of the morning, shining into the burrow. But she's not a rabbit? She's a harengon. How strange. A dream? She opens her eyes; she wakes up, curled on the ground.

Next to her is Kindle, snoring happily. Oswen is alongside him. She lies, clutching her spellbook to her chest like a pillow. She's on her back, on her backpack, a bit like a beached turtle!

In Oswen's mind she heard a distant sound of her mother telling her it's time to wake up. She remembers childhood, very young, lying in her bed in a halfling village. The sound of the voice gets closer, but then it's Inafina. "Oswen! Oswen!"

She opens her eyes and says, "I'm here! Where's here?!"

Kindle wakes up and looks around, looks confused, then says, "Weird."

We look around. A faint mist? But eyes acclimatise. It's a hazy twilight sky. Oswen perception 9+1->10, This is *not* the Fey Wild she remembers. Oh! Better not step forward; we're on the edge of a raised and broken causeway. The causeway itself is about 20ft wide, built from pale stones that glow a little with some inner light. We seem to be on a piece of this that stretches as far as the eye can see, like a highway, but parts of it are broken away, leaving us on a sort of island (albeit a long stretch, 100ft or so).

The causeway, more to the point, is quite high up. It towers over the landscape, so much so that it's hard to say just how high we really are here. There's a fog-shrouded swamp far below. The fog makes it even harder to judge distance... Maybe 30ft up? CON saves:

* Oswen 10
* Inafina 16
* Kindle 17

Inafina and Kindle smell something *bad*. Oswen makes a strong retching noise, but avoids fully barfing. It's the *worst* smell - rotting plants and, in particular, what seems to be rotting mushrooms.

"That's distinctive" says Inafina.

There's a sound too. A strangely discordant symphony of croaking frogs and tweeting birds in all directions. It's twilight; so this is perhaps evening? In the distance, not sure of the direction in this domain, there seems to be no horizon; it's replaced by a low fog, huge white clouds, hiding mountains in the distance. Oswen suggests that maybe that's some kind of barrier, because this domain is meant to have been "broken up", but that might not mean literally, perhaps it's more that there are curtains or barriers splitting it up.

Survival rolls are all low (highest is Oswen, 10) - we've no idea where North is so have to refer to directions relative to the causeway. Looking off the end of the causeway, towards the left, there are some standing stones and bits of mountain in the mist. Really massive archways. Towards the right, what seems to be, distant, the stump trunk of what must be the largest tree any of us have ever seen. The stump itself is vast, given how big it is, yet how distant we're sure it is. It rises out of the swamp mist almost to the causeway level; a 30ft tall stump alone is pretty big.

There is some light and movement in the mist off to the right along with a strange pulsating light that seems to be appearing in clumps and clusters under the fog. Perhaps the ground isn't that far below the fog?

Inafina's studying things over the side; there appear to be crumbly handholds and footholds that someone has improvised. We could get down to the swamp. Growing out of the pillars, maybe 25ft down, seems to be a woodear mushroom growing out of the (stone) pillar; a possible platform to break the climb up. Then she sees something very odd.

"What is *that*?"

In the distant sky, bursting through a cloud, is a great balloon, careening and spinning a bit, as if it has a puncture hole. A wicker basket hangs underneath it, swinging wildly. The balloon disappears down into the fog about a mile away, off to the right.

Oswen says, "No idea, but perhaps we should check if it they're OK? How do we get there?"

Inafina says, "There are handholds..." - Kindle asks if have rope. Inafina says, "Of course I've got rope" and pulls out her 50ft hempen rope. But to what do we tie it? Kindle asks how much we weigh! Oswen with kit is less than 70lb but Inafina is more heavily laden, coming in at almost 200lb.

Kindle says he can help Oswen down on the rope easily enough. Inafina should go first to catch her if she falls! Inafina ACRO 17, easy. She calls from below the mist, "It's only about another 10ft after the mist!" - she sees down here that the lights we saw are just glowing mushrooms and moss.

Oswen adv ATHL only 10, but it's just enough - she's slow, but does not fall.

Kindle coils up the rope and starts to make his own way down. ATHL nat 20, almost showing off - he jumps, lands on the mushroom, bounces and lands on the ground! He gives the rope back.

All below the fog layer, we now get bearings - Kindle uses the mushroom shelf (and a Survival roll) - and head towards the presumed-crash site.

The ground is a bit boggy. Just about none of the ground is truly dry. Giant mushrooms, ferns and cotton-candy-shaped bushes abound - and show tide marks, as if the swamp water changes level... And is currently quite low. It get at least 3 feet up the stalks. Survival rolls all round on this terrain are low; the highest is 11. After a while, though, Inafina notices movement up ahead. She calls out "duck!" as a huge crane, in a panic, takes off and flies low overhead. Something scared it, but we have to press on.

The mud squelches beneath the feet. Little light like fireflies, about the size of crickets, flitter about. Lots of frog sounds again, not as a loud as the "twilight chorus" but - Inafina thinks she hears music. Several voices singing a - marching song? She says they sound close. We decide to seek it out, cautiously.

We happen upon 6 harengon. Two tug at the reins of a giant snail, the other four carry clubs and slings. They sing about "sticks and stones will break your nose" - and so-on. It's some strange rhyme about some cunning hare (who sounds quite the thief!). **Agdon Longscarf**, "brigand prince" of Prismeer. They see us and halt with weapons levelled. "Ha!" they say. Inafina senses the snail is not too happy about the way they're treating it. "Is that *your* snail?" she asks. "Halt! Wait. It's another harengon! It *is* our snail, yes. We found it. It is now ours. Just as *we* found *you*!" "Well *we're* not yours" retorts Oswen. We're told that we're being robbed.

Oswen just laughs. "Don't be ridiculous, there's no call for that here. Nobody needs to rob anybody!"

"On the contrary, we absolutely do. We're Agdon Longscarf's crew! We rule these parts."

**Jebbek**, one is called, adds, "Yes. We must, we must! We must take it for Agdon Longscarf." - she pats a gourd she wears. "Give it up! Give it up now. Think about the best you have ever received." She's holding a stopper.

Oswen says to the crew, "That's going to steal a thought or something - I think we might need to act..." but then to the "crew" says, "We recognise only one ruler in these lands - Zybilna! So stand down, or be prepared to defend yourselves."

Jebbek says, "We do not recognise your authority! We are brigands."

Oswen uses Minor Illusion to surround herself with flame - adv intimidation; 2,20+0 -> 20. They take a step back, "There's no need for that!" and they step back. In the confusion the snail throws off the two riders and tries to puts its big foot over one.

Oswen says "I suggest rather than robbery a trade. I like the look of your snail. Name your price!"

Inafina insight 13; she notices that Jebbek is trying to keep the situation under control, but even though it's now trying to become a trade, Jebbek is quite scared. Not of us, but what happens if the gourd isn't filled. So Inafina says, "We like to follow the rules. It seems you have rules about that gourd! If you explain, perhaps we can help, rather than fight." Persuasion 14.

Jebbek reluctantly explains - "It - it's not really mine." - she explains that she was allowed to be the team leader today. Agdon gave her the gourd, that he was given himself by **Bavlorna Blightstraw**, "ruler of this realm". We infer that this one of the three hags of the Hourglass Coven. The gourd must be filled with memories of delight when you were given "the best gift you were ever received". We deduce that we ourselves lose the memory. We figure Agdon had the task, and was made "prince of the brigands" for his trouble, and he's delegated.

So we say, "well, a gift of a giant snail would be quite something. I can't truly say anyone would've ever gifted me something quite like that - and if I gave the memory, I wouldn't even remember the gift, so did it even happen? So an exchange - the snail as a gift, you get our memories, which of course means nobody remembers who owns the snail, so the snail is free. That would surely be a greatest gift!"

Jebbek doesn't think that would work. Kindle tries a bit more intimidation - another nat 20! - "How about *this* for an exchange! We give you your freedom and in return you give us freedom that we can give to the snail! That sounds like a fair trade of freedom all around!"

"Fine! FINE! *FINE*! Fine..." says a scared Jebbek, bounding off; over the shoulder - "but I warn you - royalty or not - Agdon Longscarf will always remember every slight!" - she bounds off.

"No friends today, then" says Oswen, sadly. Except perhaps for the snail! It comes over, apparently having understood the whole thing. It knows it is free. Oswen tries Sylvan - "Hello gallant snail, it seems you are free?" - the eye stalks come down to her level, and it seems to understand. So she says, "I hope have good evening, but do watch out for more brigands!"

The snail looks puzzled. It seems to be trying to signal something. Inafina insight 21, the snail wants to give something back. She explains so Oswen says, "Well, there's no need, that's very kind, we were trying to find a strange balloon - a flying thing, a big bag, that landed..." - and its eyes go straight up! It clearly knows what she means. It leans to the side, slanting, then looks quizzical. Inafina insight 24, she's definitely on the level with this snail! It thinks it saw where that was but it's near a place where this leaning thing is significant. The snail starts to head off, and we follow, since that's the intention after all.

* We go past some strange bubble spouts, mini geysers, which Oswen has seen blowing out beautiful, sweet-smelling water before - only here, it's awful-smelling swamp gas. It isn't too surprising give what we heard about the goings-on in this compromised domain.

* There's an almost emerald-coloured pond with very large (albeit not giant) dragonflies dancing around, arranging the pond scum into patterns to clear some space; as they do, the scum quickly scurries in to fill the space again.

* The snail stops suddenly; it freezes; we all freeze. A strange thump thump thump, but from many feet. A distant shadow in the mist moves across in our view, hard to make out; it must have many feet, whatever *that* was! We continue once it's safe.

It only takes about 10-15 minutes to follow the snail, which seems very sure of its direction and the way to avoid more difficult bits of the marsh.

D8->4. We get to a strange grounded, abandoned raft, with a mast and small sail that seems to be made out of a blanket. If the "tide" comes up, we figure it would float. It's quite big, some 10ft square. There's a sound of gushing water as another geyser goes off; lights dance around in the fog near the sound. We remember where this raft is just in case we get caught out by rising waters.

Only about 2 minutes later, fog seems to part over a small area and we see a crumbling stone tower that leans at such a sharp angle that Oswen is surprised it even still stands. Black brambles cling to the base, perhaps being the only things that keep it upright. It is some 20ft in diameter and 50ft tall. Most interesting of all, there's a closed door at the bottom - and snagged at the top is the rope and deflated balloon, the basket hanging precariously off the bottom.

Oswen thanks the snail and says it should probably get itself to safety. Its eye stalks kind of bow down to the ground and the shell raises. Oswen tries to bow in return! The snail glides off.

We get to the brambles at the base and Oswen shouts up, "Is there anybody there? Do you need help?"

A few voices; "Hello down there!" - something else arguing - someone saying it's probably evil, another it'd eat us! Oswen shouts, "We're not evil and we won't eat you, but I suppose that is what an evil hungry thing would also say! We will try to help." "Please! Dear traveller! We appear to be in a bit of a bind!" and so-on. One even says that assistance would be recompensed by Her Royal Majesty. They're quickly shushed by another. There's probably something in the tower or nearby that's a problem.

We can't see a good way through the brambles, so Oswen asks if either of the other two have any kind of fire spell - (meanwhile, exceptionally low stealth checks - nat 1s and 2s). Inafina notices movement in the brambles... "Watch out!" she shouts. Initiative!

* Kindle 20
* Oswen 15
* Inafina 8

To Oswen's horror a giant constrictor snake appears. Then another! The first snake lunges forward to try and encircle Inafina (her and Oswen having rolled equally low stealth, but Inafina being closer) but she dodges out of the way (14 vs AC 16). Next, Kindle. "Oh my goodness! It's giant snakes!" he exclaims, then, "By Yondalla, you are not to be here!" and positions himself between both, taking a swing with his mace at the one who attacked Inafina. He just hits, for 1d6+2->a max 8 damage. An extra 6 from 2d6 too, for the special bugbear ability of hitting an enemy that has not yet itself had a chance to attack.

Oswen runs between his legs, to get between them as well and casts Thunderwave with the cube on an axis to push the creatures sideways *and* get the brambles. She uses a new ability (Awakened Spellbook) to turn the damage into fire instead of thunder (via Chromatic Orb); both creatures surprisingly fail a DC13 CON save, so are pushed away and take 2d8->11 (fire) damage each. The brambles are also blown away and burned all the way to the door. Voices from above shouts, "Goodness! What in the world is that!" "I can't see!" "Help me up!" "Can you reach the bars?" and so-on.

The snake that was just pushed away from Kindle now tries to come back and attack Oswen. Small and tasty! AC12 vs 24 to hit; she takes 12 piercing damage (of 13 hp). She's almost killed in a single blow.

Inafina tries to stop the *other* snake from getting closer; she throws a spear, hits, 1d6+3->6 damage, then moves in to get in the snake's way and uses a Ki point for a flurry of blows. Mostly, she kicks with the powerful back legs. Both miss, including a nat 1 on the attack attempts. That same snake now tries to bite Inafina. 12 vs AC16; she dodges again.

Kindle sees Oswen very badly hurt! He casts Shield Of Faith on her (AC12->14) as a bonus action then ("It's time for you to meet your maker!") holds his amulet of Yondalla and a huge dinner bell (!) appears above him, rings loudly; he is trying Toll The Dead; potential damage 11. It fails its WIS save (rolled 7+0), so it takes a full 11 damage.

Oswen wants to get away so she once again uses Thunderwave (again using fire to keep going with other brambles). It fails CON so is pushed back, albeit only with 2d8->6 damage. She shouts to Kindle, "Sorry, I have to get a bit of distance!" and darts for the open door of the tower. She gets up into the doorway clambering over the dead roots and rubble, tries the handle and it opens, so she positions herself in there.

The pushed-back snake comes back to try and go for Oswen again, but Kindle gets an attack of opportunity as it comes past. Kindle just hits (another 12), 1d6+2->4 more damage. The snake is able to reach Oswen, sadly; she'd tried to get out of its way but its head snaps at her in the doorway. 12 to hit, matching her normal AC, but thanks to the shield, it can't get the bite in.

Inafina tries to attack her snake, using her last Ki point, but 3, 5, 4 rolled, not a single attack lands. Super frustrating. At least the snake's retaliation also misses; 12 vs 15 AC.

Kindle decides to *wrestle* the snake! He gets it grappled; snake ATHL only 10 (6+4), Kindle rolls high - 18+2, dirty 20. He's trying to pull the snake back out from the door! He manages to get it back a few feet. It's not in Oswen's face anymore. "Run!" he shouts.

Oswen hits with Ray Of Frost but d8->2 only 2 damage. Perception 17, she can see a window on the second floor, so starts to run up; Arcana 15, strange, **it doesn't feel like the tower is leaning here**. How odd.

The snake tries to break the grapple, but rolls badly too - only 8, vs Kindle's 17.

Inafina *finally* gets an attack in; gets a hit, fortunately d4+3->max 7 damage. She can attack as a bonus action (monk feature) and gets a second hit, for 5 damage. It tries to grapple her in response; 17 to hit, that hits so she's now grappled - a whopping 12 damage.

Kindle can't do much to attack the snake, so all he can do is call out, "Yondalla! I call to you, protect them lie family!" - Channel Divinity, creates a 'twilight sanctuary'. Twilight in a 30ft radius sphere. Strange. Things seem calm, with a calming if dim light. With a bonus action, he casts Healing Word on Inafina; 2d4+3->8 healing.

Oswen runs to the window and sees that while Kindle's snake is messed up, it's grappled while Inafina is now encircled herself so she tries Ray Of Frost again on that one, hitting for d8->7 cold damage. She uses her bonus action to pop Orvil into view, "A bit of trouble Orvil, distract that snake to help Inafina!" and Orvil just says "SNAKE?!" then flies out of the window!

Oswen feels the calmness of the hearth of Yondalla. Warm hot chocolate and fireplaces. She gains 7 temp HP!

Once again Kindle's snake tries to escape. Another terrible roll for it, surprisingly; 7, vs Kindle 18.

With Orvil's help, Inafina gets in another hit - 5 damage - and then another hit, 7 damage. A combination of a chop and a kick. Somehow, she gets a vital hit in - the snake stiffens, then slumps to the ground. She's free! She pulls out her spear from the corpse, bounds over in a great leap, across the brambles, to flank the snake Kindle is holding and give him a hand.

She also gets 7 temp HP at the turn end from Kindle's ongoing spell.

Kindle warns Oswen that he's going to let go of the snake now, lets go and casts Toll The Dead again. It once again fails its safe and takes 10 damage. Oswen throws another ray of frost and does hit, and even though it's only 4 damage, that was all that was left; the snake falls.

### 300XP each

Oswen falls back from the window and slumps to the floor, breathing heavily. With the adrenaline of battle over, she's suddenly aware of the weird warm damp feeling and rather than pain, more of a numb feeling; she looks down to see her clothing all covered in blood. Kindle and Inafina run up into the tower to find Oswen, sat on the ground. Oswen says "I think I'm a bit hurt..."

Kindle has just a little bit more magic left in him. Shocked at the sight of Oswen, despite knowing that an hour or two of rest would help, he casts Healing Word and gives her 7 recovery. Oswen gets to her feet, runs up, hugs his leg and says, "You're my favourite bugbear". She's got enough arcana insight to see that he used the last of his magic today.

Anyway, the point of this all was... Up!

Perception - nat 2+1, oh dear. Oswen is in a bit of a fluster, running up without noticing what's inside. Inafina is more cautious. She's also noticed the strange lack of lean inside; perception 15. It looks like a long-abandoned library! All kinds of weird arcane stuff. Once Oswen has a moment, she'll certainly want to look at this.

Oswen meanwhile pops out of the top, Kindle in hot pursuit. Oh. Problem! The ropes and balloon are very entangled in the tower. Very difficult to entangle and then it'd be quite a drop. Could be too much even for Feather Fall. The basket swings some 15 feet down from the top. Oswen asks Orvil to fly down and 'looks through him' - perception dirty 20. The bird causes a panic until Oswen calls down to tell them it's OK!

Strange; one cage with two people in. Someone else hugs the cage, arms tied to it. Another person is dead! A bullywog? Probably died in the crash. So these appear to be 3 prisoners. That makes more sense; all that stuff about "Her Majesty" didn't ring true. It's a Satyr stood outside; there's nowhere for him to go; in the cage, though, a faerie - only about 2ft tall - and faerie *dragon*. It's dressed like a knight. It recognises the familiar immediately. Oswen calls down, this time in Sylvan, "Those cages and ropes are going to make this harder. Give us a minute or two, we'll have to figure out what to do! But help *is* on the way." The Satyr calls, "Just cut us free and we'll take our chances landing on the ground!" The other two do *not* agree.

That idea of cutting the ropes could work - with Feather Fall. But we'd need a dagger. None of us have one. We could burn ropes with a torch, but that'd make the basket swing wildly as each rope broke and people might not fall at the same time - Oswen only has 1 spell left.

Oswen calls down to ask the satyr to search the bullywog for a dagger, and the satyr reveals a rapier; but Orvil can't carry that. There's another debate as the three argue. Then the fearie dragon reveals that we can find the "toothpick of glory" in its belongings. It would be an ornate longsword to the tiny dragon, but to us, it's like a dagger. "The sharpest blade! Enchanted by the royal armourer himself. Will this do?" Oswen thanks him and Orvil flies the dagger up.

Orvil asks if Kindle can gather the ropes enough to cut them all, or at least cut enough, for the basket to drop at once. He gathers the ropes but his hands are far too big for the toothpick! Inafina is dexterous and says she can do it, so Oswen can be ready to cast her spell. We shout down our plan and in an inevitable hail of protestation from below, go ahead with it!

Inafina deftly slices the ropes - unarmed strike with advantage, nat 20+5. All ropes are cut in a single swipe. A chorus of cries from below, but Oswen as a reaction casts Feather Fall on the three - her last spell, too. The basket crashes to the ground, but the body of the bullywog, the satyr and the cage slowly float down. We run down to greet them. On the way, Inafina points at shelves and calls out to Oswen, "you need to look at those later!"

We get down to the cage and satyr. The satyr seems to be having a tender moment with the bullywog, to Oswen's surprise. As we approach and he sees us, he stands upright, looking embarrassed. The faerie stands inside the cage. Oswen looks to the Satyr and says, "I'm sorry for your loss. There was nothing we could do when we saw the balloon falling - we were too far away." "Oh, you mistake my stoicism for sadness; it is honour. He was a noble soul and honourable person who did honourable deeds in a court of darkness of all who work against the night!"

The faerie is blonde, handsome, has golden dragonfly wings, piercing blue eyes and is dressed in a tailored white button-up shirt, thin suspenders and tie and fitted grey trousers; he has polished shoes. The faerie dragon is amazing! Almost candy-like pink wings with a kind of inner glow, lilac skin, a very 'proper' demeanour; they fly up and bow within the confines of the cage. Their hand moves to the where the hilt of a sword would be. They wear a medallion on a delicate gold chain, a sash as if of royal decree and the clothes of a knight but with the armour stripped off.

"First, we need to get this cage open" says Inafina. As we approach, the dragon says, "Kind strangers - I am **Sir Talavar**. As you can see, I am a violet faerie dragon! I am one of the Summer Queen's most loyal servants. Thank you for rescuing us - but I'm afraid that we most impose upon you further. I was in the midst of a daring escape from the vile hag when our balloon was set upon by ill wind. My pilot, the honourable **Wigglewog**" (and he bows towards the body) "did not survive. I've been trapped in this realm for a while now. Help me! I must escape to tell my queen of the Fall of Prismeer! These are two of our courtiers from the Summer Queen's palace - the **court of Titania**. I present to you my loyal subjects - **Bel Bottom**" (the satyr, who bows) "and **Aumen Brighterstars**" (the faerie, who also bows).

(The two are competing courtiers, given their arguments!)

The whole crew have a handsome vibe; very well kept, the satyr with trimmed beard, adorned horns and a dangling earring and fine courtier clothing.

The dragon explains that as an emissary of Titania he travelled to Prismeer to persuade Zybilna to ally with the **Seelie Court (Titania's court)** against hated enemies, the **Fomorians** who rise again. However, Sir Talavar soon discovered that Prismeer had been sized by the Hourglass Coven hags. Before he could return with news of the treachery, he was captured in an enchanted silver birdcage. It inhibits his magic. He has considerable power, it transpires, but can't use it.

Wigglewog was sympathetic to their cause and loyal to Zybilna. He stole the cage, freed Bel and fled in one of the hag's balloons. She must've sent a malicious wind (air elemental, probably) to cause it to crash.

Oswen needs to figure how the cage works. She can use her spellbook once a day to give her one ritual casting of Detect Magic in just a few seconds, so gives that a go. She's not done it before and is keen to try it out.

Woah! The tower looks *ridiculous*. Very bright magic emanations. Magic all in the fey, of course. But the cage - ah, very specific magic there:

* An aura of abjuration prevents magic from being used in any way within the cage
* It is locked with an indestructibility spell and it cannot be picked, but could be opened with something like the Knock spell - or, of course, the key

Oswen knows *of* the knock spell but certainly can't cast it. We don't have the key. Kindle points back at the tower and says, "It's a long shot, but Inafina said there was magic stuff in there?!" Aumen adds, "Wigglewog did mention he had a plan for opening the cage; we needed to find **Jinglejangle** - keeper of keys".

Oswen figures checking the tower first, for anything of help, would be wise. But she does say, "We're here to investigate what's happened to Zybilna and maybe even try to defeat the hags. We've come from the Witchlight Carnival." Talavar says, "Well I did promise you the aid of the Queen. If you can free us, two of us will travel back to free Tatania. But I will leave you one of my loyal courtiers to aid you in your quest." So Oswen says, "Well actually my point was that our goals seem rather aligned! But I certainly wouldn't say no to such a generous offer. First, then, please be patient as we check the tower; failing that, we'll have to work on this Jinglejangle problem."

Bel is keen to come with us - Talavar is against it! - but Kindle can bring the cage inside and close the door for some degree of safety. We also recover whatever belongings there are. But what about Wigglewog? Oswen asks what their custom is. Burial? "Yes, we should put him in the ground, and if we can have a ceremony we would be in your debt."

We all help dig. It's difficult in the swamp, but the ground closer to the tower is drier. Kindle performs a ritual ceremony. People say their part. Bel recovers a songhorn and plays it while Aumen sings a dirge. Sir Talavar finishes things up.

It amounts to a short rest for all of us - a time to heal, for everyone, in various different ways. Oswen is surprised by how moving she finds it all. It feels like a microcosm of looking at her own little group.

Inside the tower, Oswen gets Orvil to help. ADV investigation only 8,9 plus Guidance from Kindle (d4->3), 17. Hmm, not great. Arcana check; even with +5 and Guidance (only d4->1), still only just scrapes into 13. She still manages to find a few things.

* It was a wizard's tower
* Remnants of spell casting components; some are still viable, a component pouch worth
* A box of incense and herbs with two blocks of charcoal - the whole thing is worth 10gp; it's for Find Familiar
* Faerie queen coins, quite beautiful, 33gp worth in gold and silver
* An ornate hammer - it seems to just be a hammer
* Some scrolls: Knock, Illusory Script, Darkvision, Darkness
* D100->43 gold worth of spell practice components and gem inks

DM allows the 43gp of practice components, plus 7gp of actual gold spent, to allow Illusory Script to be copied via the magic quill into the awakened spellbook. The components disappear into motes of light as the final runes of the spell are copied. It only takes a couple of minutes!

Oswen says that we might as well try to use the Knock scroll. She could wait and try to write it into her spellbook one day - but there are people in a cage right now! Trouble is, it's more than she can normally cast. Guidance is added. It goes really well! 21 with Guidance (15+5+1). The lock dissolves into fine faerie dust, as the door sings open.

Almost in disbelieve, Sir Talavar and Aumen fly out. They land in front of Oswen, look up; Talavar's eyes widen; he gasps. "Oh! I'm so sorry, your highness. My magic did not work in the cage. How terribly rude of me. I did not recognise a monarch of the fey."

Oswen pauses for a moment then says - "Ummm... Do I look like someone you know?"

But then Kindle gasps too. "Oh! It *is* real!"

Now she's freaking out a bit. Aumen adds, "Yes! Your highness! You are the Witchlight Monarch."

Oh!

Sir Talavar retrieves from his bag and holds up his beautiful mirror shield. In her reflection she sees a spectral crown. "Well now" she says "I wonder what *that* means?"

"It means that the creatures of the realm who are... Predisposed to obeying the rules!... will treat you as fey royalty and would certainly not dare risk attacking you for fear of crossing the lines of Titania's decrees. That said - I would still urge you to be cautious, for it certainly seems that the laws are no longer being upheld here in Prismeer."

"We've noticed!" says Inafina.

"Nobody would've dared accost and kidnap Titania's own emissary."

"So what now for you," asks Oswen. "I must return! I must return and warn my queen along with one of my courtiers. As I promised I will leave one here with you, to help you with our shared mission. Who would you choose? Bel or Aumen?"

Oswen whispers to Aumen, so nobody can be overheard, "Do you think Bel's anywhere near fabulous enough to accompany a dragon knight on such an important quest?" He answers, with insight 20 recognising a slight preference for Bel; he understands that she wants them to make a choice that they are happy with, but she was won over by Bel's over-the-top delivery and he way he honoured his friends. "I am a perfectionist and I love knowing what makes people tick. I understand what is happening here!" - then to Bel, he says, "Bel! We don't want you back at the court anyway. Clearly, as you know, I am the better bard. Better rhymes and music - I should go back to the Seelie court. You need to prove yourself here! After all, you can't even fly."

Bel looks quite annoyed but Oswen winks at him.

Sir Talavar needs a few minutes to gather his things (he's casting a ritual in practice) - Summon Steed. After about 10 minutes, he summons a miniature griffon! He gets on the griffon. He puts back on all his retrieved armour, gets his sword, he looks to Bel; "Bel, here is something to help you on your quest." He goes up to Bel's rapier and says a prayer with his hands near the blade. There's an explosion of colour, like powder in a Colour Run. The rapier takes on a rainbow aspect. It's magical now! "May this help you complete your quest on behalf of the Seelie court. We look forward to your return. I now place you in charge of the protection of her Royal Highness, the Witchlight Monarch, until the completion of her quest." - and off they go.

Oswen lets slip the secret that it was the way he behaved with his fallen comrade that had tipped her mind in his direction, though in truth she knew very little of either of them. He picks up and says, "Well I always wanted to go with you too!" - insight 19+1 -> 20 - really, he only just now made up his mind. He'd not given it thought. He's flighty, absent minded, changes his mind, at odds with the court sometimes.

"What shall I call your entourage? Surely you have a name?"

Oswen says, "You speak like you're not part of it. It's *our* entourage now."

"Well I must learn which entourage I am joining."

Oswen sighs. Fey. Names have power. "I hadn't thought about it. And I should've, I suppose, in the Fey Wild of all places. Loyal courtier, would you be so kind as to name our group?"

"A huge task! The power of names indeed. May I have some time?"

"Of course!"

"So where are we off to next?"

Well that's a good question. We're technically directionless. But Oswen figures, well, if the hags are splitting the domain, then the hags are the problem. "I think we should try to head back where you came from - see what help we can gather along the way." Bel nods, putting up a brave face, "Well I know a little bit about that place..."

"I don't think we're in any shape to tackle a powerful hag yet, but we can see what we can find as we go. We've already found a few useful things in this tower!"

Oswen, persuasion 19+0. "OK, well, I'll tell you where it is - we came from a settlement called Downfall, on the other side of the Queen's Way" (the causeway we started at). "Used to be a village of Bullywogs, but it's been turned into the heart of Bavlorna's domain. That is where she now holds her court; well, not really, she rules like a dictator! We did hear of *some* kind of court there, which is where our dear noble Bullywog conspirator came from. It's now just a fog-filled swamp, with everyone living in unusual structures tied together with faerie lights and bunting. Bavlorna hides in the middle. Very difficult to get to. We'd need to get the Bullywogs on our side but that could be difficult - we'd need to work on the **Soggy Court**! That's a group of Bullywogs who have been allowed to create their own feudal system under Bavlorna. There's even a king there! A monarch; I heard people call him **Gullop The XIX** (19th) who gained power by boiling his predecessor in oil! There are always coups going on there, but like any court there are always courtiers doing power plays. We'd have to figure out how that worked, infiltrate it or at least find a way to wander freely through Downfal to have any chance of reaching Bavlorna. She's usually only ever seen riding a giant lilypad. We could perhaps look for allies?"

Oswen nods, "yeah, I think I had that in mind - people who if nothing else, can show that there are people who are against Bavlorna, or the hags in general, and want things to return how they were. Or at least want Zybilna back, but perhaps might appreciate some changes in circumstances all the same."

"Maybe we should find Jinglejangle after all? She is apparently one of the most knowledgable people about the state of Prismeer. She has been collecting keys for a long time... She apparently seems to know what keys most be most important to anyone at any given time. Could be useful. **That's on Telemy Hill**. But we must avoid the Brigand's Tollway. We heard that Bavlorna has put this brave and handsome brigand called Agdon in charge of all of the harengon in the area. They fancy themselves some sort of royal degree privateer types!"

"Yes, we stumbled across some on the way to the tower."

"They've become a bit of a nuisance."

"It seemed like they're a bit afraid of what might happen if they didn't do what Agdon told them to do. Maybe we could offer them a better deal, but we'd need to understand what they want first. What drives them."

"So which way should we go?"

Oswen thinks then says, "Well, I don't even know what time it is, but I'm worried about the water level in this swamp! Do you know how often this rises?"

"No! But it does look like the tide is beginning to come in." - the water is rising around the tower.

"Well then - I don't know where dry land might be, but I *do* know where there's something that floats."

Survival with Orvil's help, survival 21; it's only a few minutes away but even so our feet are soggy. Bel has hooves but the rest of us get wet shoes. We scamper up onto the raft; but we'll have to wait a while for it to float and then need to decide which way to go.

It takes only about 15 minutes for the raft to start to float. A 10ft long pole sits on it which can be used to navigate it - that seems like Kindle-scale stuff. Inafina could do it too. We wonder if an owner might arrive, but since we're floating and there's nobody else around - we figure, well, we might as well head somewhere.

Where?

Via Orvil, adv perception 16, looking for clusters of lights or a hill or similar. Orvil sees something unusual in the distance that Oswen certainly didn't expect! Orvil is above the fog and treeline. Something drags through the fog, leaving a kind of eddy behind it; the top of an *inn*, of all things. A moving inn, with a fairly persistent eddy behind it which forms almost a kind of walkway. It's quite a distance - at least 15 minutes - but we give it a go.

Kindle gets into a rhythm. As we get closer, it makes more sense. It's huge! 3 storeys, ah! And *this* is what we avoided before with the snail, fearing danger. It's not thumpy now, it's splashy. The house is mounted on multiple very stork legs, some 8 pairs. It's beautiful looking, covered in moss and ivy, and seems spared whatever else happened to this stricken land - its colours are not dulled. Bunting, lights, planters with beautiful flowers at every window; we get into the eddy behind it and instead of smelling swamp, we get an amazing smell of freshly baked cookies. It's quite quick, moving about 30ft.

Then there's a flick of a tail; a black cat's face appears in a window; then a door opens and a tabaxi appears, throwing a rope out. Inafina ACRO nat 20+5, catches it easily. We're pulled in. It shouts something back inside; the tavern slows down and lowers itself down, so we're able to pull the raft up to the doorway.

The tabaxi says, "My name is **Tsu Harabax**" - she has a kind of salt and pepper fur now we're close. An old cat. "Welcome to the **Inn at the End Of The Road**. Please tie your raft up!" - so Inafina does that. "You poor things! You must be hungry or cold or something?" Oswen isn't cold but food sounds good. And maybe somewhere safe to sleep.

Motes are flying around inside - oh, actually, they're tiny orbs of pale light; they act like fireflies but are not; just pure magic. The inn inside seems like it's seen better days. Wallpaper peels, walls are worn, a few candles above the dining table have run out - yet it still feels very homely. The cookies smell is particularly strong. Tsu comes back with some towels and a plate of them. "Please help yourself! You must tell me... Why are you out here? I haven't seen people with this much... Vim and vigour and hope!... in a little while."

Inafina insight 16; is this person on the level? They seem honest and to have a good heart. So Inafina says, "Well, if you've time, we can tell you our story" - nodding to Oswen to signal that she thinks it's OK.

"A story in exchange for cookies! That works for me."

Oswen is reminded to be wary of gifts from people. Oops. Oh well, always establish the price first! Freshly-baked cookies would be a good trap.

So over the next while, we tell the full story, from carnival to Fey to tower to here.

As we talk, an old Tortle comes down stairs, along with a strange-looking kind of young lion cub humanoid?! Unsure if related to Tsu - Oswen's never seen that kind before. Might not even be Tabaxi. He has a pet stoat! Oswen asks Orvil if he wants to play with the stoat; "No! Stoats eat birds!"

Tsu explains that there used to be many more people in the inn, but she's been run ragged running the inn by herself ever since the Coven seized control. They used to be allow to go anywhere, across all of Prismeer. She speaks of its original glory at length, *before* "the three sisters took it". A place of wonder, colour and beauty; eternal dawns or eternal sunsets. "Now we're stuck here. We cannot cross into the other split domains. There are only a few people - a few guides - who know the way between the mists. There's only *one* here, in **Hither**" (so now we know which one we're in) "and I think only one or two in each domain at all, and the guide here hasn't been seen in ages. **He's probably somewhere in Downfall.** His name is **Clapperclaw** - you'll recognise him easily, a scarecrow with crab's pincers!"

She continues; "If you have any trinket of value, we could do an exchange. You could have somewhere to sleep tonight and I'll give you pieces of my blueberry pie."

Something with stories and memories is valued. Oswen pulls out the feather she found from Kettlesteam. It's from the story we just told. Tsu seems delighted. "This is the feather that started your adventure!" "Yes, we don't part with it lightly." "Well you are welcome to meals and lodging for as often and as long as I am able to provide them."

We continue to chat with people and catch up. The tortle was caught in this domain when things fractured and doesn't belong here really. The it-transpires-very-shy lion cub must be, Oswen realises, perhaps just a child, uncertain of themselves. The tortle is looking after him - "I found him all by his lonesome with nothing but his pet stoat! I've been looking after him since. He doesn't speak, so I don't know where he's from. But he's a good kid. *I* think that he's not from here either. Probably came through in a portal somewhere... I think he's had something taken from him."

Perhaps his confidence was stolen, suggests Tsu.

Oswen "persuades" Orvil to fly over and see if it can befriend the stoat. She (from a distance) says "This is my friend Orvil. Can he play with your friend?" - not too persuasive; only 6! Bel has a go instead. He heads over, bows and starts playing some music! Then he tries to be persuasive as well - nat 20+5. Wow.

The stoat and child slowly approach, since Bel now seems very non-threatening! "Would you like to play this Songhorn? I can show you how!" - the kid nods; so Bel sits him down and starts teaching. The stoat and Orvil begin to kind of play; the stoat jumps up and swipes, Orvil dodges, but it seems to be play rather than real.

We learn more about what's happened in the area as the meal moves on to an amazing flower tea. Tsu runs off at one point to do something with the inn, to keep it moving. She prepares two rooms - one for Oswen and Inafina, one for Kindle and Bel. "Up on the third floor, away from the flies!"

It's getting darker outside. Apparently it's night time, so that's our cue. We're certainly tired. We head up to our rooms as the whole inn dims its lights inside. Little candles light the way as we walk along corridors. There's a slight sway as the house moves. A discordant symphony of frogs rings out from below. The third floor is above the fog; we can see things poking out. The big stump, some big trees, a mushroom forest. Moonlight reflects off mountains, slightly snow-capped. The mist around there seems to ring us in. Far away, there's just enough light to see where the queen's causeway would go through that wall of mist but now abruptly ends. The tortle - who we learn is called **Epatus** - tells us that *this* is where the palace used to be - the "Palace of Heart's Desire. They say that the hags have frozen Zybilna in time and trapped her there."

It's unusual, being rocked gently to sleep by an entire building - but really, very nice.

Long rest.

## Day 4

A very strong smell of what Oswen later learns is called "coffee" reaches all the way up to the third floor, as does the sound of an apparently very loud kettle whistling. The whole inn seems to be making strange noises as it moves... We wake up, this evidently being the morning!

Oswen looks out of the window to a surprise; a muted dawn, not the incredibly vibrant, long-lasting sunrises (or sunsets) to which she is accustomed. It's not twilight, at least. A cloudy sunrise vibe. She heads downstairs to find the Tsu and the lion cub (name still unknown!) and stoat already there. She awakens Orvil and whispers, "What was his name?" "I don't know!"

Oswen is often late to things and a bit surprised to find few other people here. Tsu wishes her a good morning then starts pulling on cords which seem to make things on the outside of the house move, for whatever reason. "Are you thirsty? Would you like some coffee?" "What's coffee?!" "It's this! Be careful, it's really hot."

Oswen blows on it then tries it. Very bitter and earthy, a bit grainy somehow, but the strong flavour is an interesting wake-up call and a contrast to the surprisingly muted outdoors. She asks Tsu about Jinglejangle and Telemy Hill - could she perhaps give directions? "I should be able to get you there, if you like! Or at least very close to it." "We should help with something in return." "Well, yes! If you want to... You see... There were these, ugh! Goodness!" - and pulls at the ropes again! - "Agh. The poor house! It got strung up and webbed last night, it's really difficult to get the webs off the outside. The house doesn't like it at all. The windows are hard to open and it gets musty in here."

One in particular is jammed. Oswen heads up and tries Prestidigitation. Doesn't work! Oswen says "I'll fetch the others!" and runs upstairs to wake the sleepy party.

Eventually everyone is downstairs, coffee is tried and Oswen explains. "We kind of need to fly, or have ropes we can hang off from the roof, then we can clean it." Bel suggests trying to cut through the web strands between the shutters first. Oswen asks Tsu if she has any thin, but moderately long knives in the kitchen. "Be careful, it's sharp!" - one is fetched. Inafina is dexterous and has a go - equiv. unarmed strike (her mods are from DEX), attack is 19; it's hard work but she manages to cut through strands and the shutters can now be opened.

Orvil flies out to assess the house. Oswen looks through his eyes. Patches of web appear to have been shot at the house from a distance, presumably by giant spiders. The house trails thick cobweb trails that have accumulated debris too; it must've pushed through a nest or similar.

We decide to go for hanging out of the third floor. Kindle can tie and anchor a rope. Bel can't climb ropes - hooves! - so Oswen and Inafina have to work together; Oswen to freeze things from windows at a distance, and Inafina moving around on the rope, acrobatics essentially, smashing the frozen webs. Kindle guides us. Inafina ACRO with Guidance, total 21; it goes pretty well, but takes over half an hour to get through it all. We call down to Tsu now and then as things get freed up, so she can test ropes and make sure shutters work.

Oswen, perception 17 while looking out of the windows - we seem to have gone quite a long way; the swamp is a fair bit different. The water is clearer and there's a mist rather than fog. It swirls around in places. Up ahead, she sees a strange shape; like two hills merged together - one a soft, green mossy slope, the other a craggy ridge. It seems to hold a collection of willow trees swaying and blowing in wind that isn't moving anything else! She surmises it might be a creature and the trees are part of it and that's why they're moving.

We head downstairs; Tsu (and the house!) are much happier. The tortle is here now and spending time with the cub - Oswen whispers, "what's his name?!" "**Steinn**" "Thank you! Morning Steinn!" - he is shy but waves anyway. He reaches for a coffee but the tortle says he can't have that and goes to get him juice. The cub steals the moment to drink most of the cup!

We ask Tsu about the strange "hills" and trees. "That's where we're headed! It gets a little shallower there and the house can't really go all the way up to it. You'll need to pole your way over to it." "That sounds good!"

The house slows and veers off to skirt around the hill in the deeper water. Closer up now, we see it's pretty big. We're only some 300ft away, so we all head down, untie the raft, shout thanks and goodbyes - **much waving from the door, even Steinn! - "Hope we meet again soon!" shouts Oswen - as then we push off.**

The house lumbers away as Inafina, this time, navigates us towards the hill. The water is low - a fair way off 'high tide', we don't know how much lower it'll go though, perhaps half way? - Oswen stares into the water. Tadpoles, a mass of what seem to be weeds that probably end up a tangled mess at low tide, nothing else much to see. Oswen is convinced the hill must be a creature or magical, but Arcana 7, no real clues. Moss on it seems to shimmer. She asks Bel what he makes of it... "I've never seen that before; but I think, hmm..." - nature nat 20! - "...it's a creature." "I thought so too!" "We must tread carefully." "Yes. Literally!" "Well, an entity of some kind. Not necessarily a creature. There's something very innately Fey and magical about it."

We have to try and get the raft on the hill, but don't want to drag it. Kindle and Bel do most of the work on the water edge, while Inafina and Oswen do their best on the ground edge, but they're not very strong. It sort of works.

We hear a strange noise. Humming, lowing perhaps. A kind of inquisitive feel to them. Then... A slow, low voice. "Whaaat are you doooing heere?" - and we realise the willow trees have all come around us!

"Sorry to bother you! I hope it's OK to be here. My name is Oswen, this Kindle, Inafina and Bel."

"My name is Telemy!"

"Ah, yes - you're famous! For being a hill."

"I'm not a hill!"

"Well, not, but that's how people seem to think of it. Because of the way you impressively rise up out of the waters."

"Well - yes... I used to float and travel everywhere, across different worlds; but now, I'm stuck with wet feet in this smelly bog!" The voice is coming from one of the willows. Another speaks; "How long are you planning to be here?"

"Well, we were looking for some Jinglejangle."

The trees seem to know that name! One even makes a key-jangling noise. "Yes! She is here. She likes to talk about her keys!"

Oswen with Inafina's help enquires more; persuasion 14. "Did you want to see Jinglejangle?" "Well, if that's possible and if she doesn't mind..." "I don't know - do you mean her harm!" "Certainly not!" "Well I don't see why she wouldn't want to meet you. Come with me!"

The trees walk up the "hill", looking back now and then to make sure we're following. A few more trees join behind. We're corralled a bit. "She would usually be around, but hmm - a few days ago she was in the swamp at low tide looking for truffles. Her favourite thing! But she was attacked. Robbed! Robbed by brigands!" "We've met *them*!" "She's a bit injured. Well - maybe her pride. I don't know. She seems physically fine but she hasn't eaten anything in a few days and hasn't left her den. We are worried about her. This is why we're bringing you to see her! Maybe you can convince her to come out and eat something."

"Well - we will try!"

Near the top, set into the side of the craggy part, is a beautiful painted wooden door shaped like a keyhole. The trees start to crowd around. Oswen knocks; "Hello, Jinglejangle - my name's Oswen - can we come in?"

The trees lean down - "Go on in. She might be in the cellar!"

So, in we go. The door opens into a small, cute room with a chair and table next to a small round window. There's a bookshelf and, at the back of the room, a set of worn stone steps that head downwards. A slight breeze, chilly, comes up from there; there's a smell of - something... (HIS 13) ...hmm, forges! Or the store room of a forge. Metal. Maybe she *makes* keys down there. There's flickering light below; Oswen heads down, calling ahead "Hello!"

Eventually there's a croaky old female voice. "Yes? What is it?"

Down at the base, we see a whole lot of candles in a low-ceiling, 30ft x 20ft den. It's only about 6ft here; Inafina's ears touch the roof and Kindle has to duck! There are keys in piles on tables, some dangling from strings that cross-cross the walls and even on one that crosses the room and must be ducked under. In an alcove at the far end of the room in dim light is a bed. An older goblin lady emerges, pulling her coat around her. She sniffles, and clanks as she moves - keys hanging off her garments are jangling.

Leaning against the side of the bed is a huge flail! Instead of spikes on its head, though, are padlocks.

"Oh. How may Jinglejangle unlock a bit of happiness in your lives today?" - but she's a bit confused sounding.

Oswen quietly asks Kindle - "...is she OK?" - Kindle moves and asks if she's injured. "I was! Was. But not any more." She looks at us carefully. "Why are you here?"

"The trees - well - Telemy - well they're worried about you. We came to ask for your help, but they asked us for help first. They're concerned!"

She shudders for a moment. "Asking for help? Very dangerous! Jinglejangle asked Bavlorna for help. Did not go well!" She looks worried and sits down. Oswen asks, "What happened?" "Terribly frightened. Terribly. What was before Jinglejangle, always afraid, always fearful that she would be caught behind on the wrong side of a locked door. Always worrying, looking around everywhere she went. Went to Bavlorna who could grant wishes, they said! Make thing come true! But she did something different..." A moment of lucidity? "...I could no longer sense the fear but it was replaced. She tricked me!" But then confusion slide back, a far-away look; "Now Jinglejangle can never stop, can never resist collecting all the keys. Jinglejangle is obsessed."

Kindle can see she's a bit bruised. "But someone hurt you! I can heal the bruise if you like?"

Jinglejangle pulls up her sleeve; scratched and bruised. Explains about the truffles and the Harengon gang. They stole the truffles and hit her with wooden clubs! Now no more truffles for Jinglejangle!"

Oswen says, "We'd better heal her right away" - but Kindle is already on it. He's using a combination of physical and magical means. Just for a moment Oswen sees her relax for a moment; "Beware!" she says. "Beware Bavlorna. She is not to be trusted."

Oswen says, "She is one of three. And all three we do not trust. All three we must somehow thwart - defeat - to restore Prismeer to its former glory, and free Zybilna. That is why we are here. The harengon brigands are just the tip of the iceberg!"

"But there's only one way I know to get from Hither to Thither... You must find Clapperclaw. Clapperclaw knows the path. Clapperclaw has told Jinglejangle that Thither is ruled by an *even worse* hag - **Granny Nightshade**. (That's the hag who wronged Diana Cloppington!) "You wouldn't have truffles, would you? They're my favourite!"

We don't have any on us but Oswen says we'd be happy to go searching for her. Jinglejangle offers a trade. Truffles for a key! Oswen says, "A fair trade - a key that might help us get closer to Bavlorna in Downfall, perhaps?" "Yes! Yes! *This* key!" she produces one, listening to it; "Yes. This key!" She looks to us with big eyes. "You will find Jinglejangle three truffles?" "We will certainly try!"

So we say we'll be back as soon as we can - might be a while for the waters to fall - and head up and out. We tell the trees the story. They sensed she wasn't quite as unhappy. They give us some directions to where truffles *might* be - around the base of some giant oaks nearby. We have to dig them up with great care as they are fragile.

We have to get there by raft, so we carefully (as best we can!) lift it back onto the water, easier this time with tree help! "We'll be right back!" - Off we go.

Perception Inafina, 19+5 -> 24! There are silhouettes in the mist. Familiar. Long ears, and a group. Hide or confront? Oswen says, "I'm not *looking* for a fight, but these people attacked an old lady. Whoever this Agdon is, this has to stop. I say we confront them!" Bel bristles with excitement!

Oswen shouts over - "You there! Show yourselves, we can see you! We know you're part of Agdon's crew."

Silhouette ears change from bobbing around to upright and seeking; then move towards us. We eventually see a raft. The ears were bobbing due to the use of poles. There are four different Harengon to those we saw before. They have loot bags. They say, "Stop! You're being robbed! Hand over your best and most delicious things!" One has a crossbow.

Oswen does the fire illusion thing again and says, "We've got a bone to pick with you! What's all this about attacking old ladies looking for truffles?!"

"Well if she had truffles she's fair game!"

"Look, you need to go back to Agdon and tell him that all of this nonsense won't stand. You can't just go around stealing things!"

"Why not? Why will it not stand?!"

Kindle draws himself up to full height and Oswen points and says, "For one thing, *that*. We're not fond of stealing so you all need to clear off!"

"We've been given permission! We've been given permission to take what we want and what we need."

"Where *is* this Agdon?" "At the stump, of course!" "Well, we'll be taking it up with him. In the mean time, you'll get nothing from us - except a fight! So try your luck if you want, but I don't recommend it!" - INTIM Adv. 17+0 -> 17. Bel has levelled a crossbow, Kindle is armed, Oswen's illusion is up, Inafina is twirling her staff. We make a good show!

"You - you - *you* called us over, it's your fault!" protests one. But they're moving the raft away. It disappears into the mist. One calls back, "This is not the last of it! Agdon's been given the rights over all of this land. You'll see!"

Once they're gone, Oswen says we'll have to solve the Agdon problem pretty soon. Maybe before Bavlorna, tho maybe Bavlorna's directions are what gives Agdon his confidence. Who knows. We'd better get the truffles before they change their minds!

We reach the truffle spot. It smells awful! The oak trees are impressive, though. A stand of five giants - trunks are 20ft diameter, at least. We realise we saw these from the causeway yesterday. We tie off the raft to a low branch. "So how exactly does one find truffles?" asks Kindle...

Oswen Nature 17; Bel is listing off facts and figures that make Oswen doubt herself a bit though (insight 8) but Inafina (insight 17) knows that while he's acting very confident, it's probably just bluster. She says as much - she's quite direct - and Oswen laughs and says, "You know what, I don't mind it. You don't have to be like that with us Bel - we already trust you - but if it makes you happy, it's fine. And that gift of the gab is certainly going to be very useful when talking to other people!" "I thought I might as well be helpful... If anyone knows how to find truffles I'm all ears!"

Oswen whispers conspiratorially to Bel - "Those two sort of feel like strange parents. Somehow, you feel a bit like a brother already..." - then louder - "I think I have some idea of these truffles. See if you can give me a hand."

The ground around will be particularly soft. And they smell strongly. Bel is quite good at using his hooves to gently press the earth without poking it and Inafina is good at smelling things out. Inafina with Kindle's Guidance, total 15; she finds an area that's quite different. Bel tests it - spongy - soft. Yes! So how do we dig these out?

Kindle could just dig it with big hands but we were told they're delicate.

* Kindle has a shield and big hands!
* Oswen has small hands and a small knife
* Inafina has just got weaponry
* Bel says... "Well don't tell anyone, but how about this? All of you get back!"

He gets on all fours and starts kicking the soil, knocking off the top layer, like a dog digging. Oswen is alarmed that it might destroy the truffles but he's being careful, just taking off soil. Once the top of some becomes visible, Oswen can use her knife to tease earth out around and find their edges. The truffles are large, almost half a foot across, wrinkly and brown. They smell sweet and earthy, almost chocolatey. Strange! It's not just a mushroom - something a bit different. Fey, again! Oswen can use Prestidigitation to clean off the soil and it's a slow process, takes about 5 minutes given the size of the thing.

Now what?!

Bel has extra clothes. Bloomers of sorts! "You could put it in these I guess?" "I can clean them afterwards" says Oswen. That works. One.

Number 2 - Inafina perception, 15 again with Guidance. We follow the same process and it's a little bit quicker once the top layer of soil is off as we know more about the shape and size, though this one is smaller, about a tennis ball size, but more chocolatey - in fact it seems to be covered in chocolate sprinkles. How odd!

Number 3 - perception 19+5+1 -> 25! She gets to another area where part of the truffle actually pokes out above the ground. A string of them, connected! Three. They're perfectly round, like tempered chocolate smooth, slightly different colours. One is dark brown, one light, the other off-white. So, we collect those; now we have five, and Jinglejangle gets to choose and maybe we even let her have the extras. Why not.

Quite a lot to carry in bloomers! Bel now has a jacket with the three new ones in that. We get back to the raft with Bel in charge. As we get back towards the raft, Inafina perception only 13; almost too late, just notices - "Trouble ahead!" - next to the raft is the other raft with the four Harengon. "We changed our mind!" says one. "You have truffles. Hand them over."

Oswen sighs and says, "Well, you chose the fight it seems. So be it! Bel, guard those with your life! Hide behind a tree! Us three, protect Bel!" - he pulls his crossbow as we form a defensive circle.

"Get those truffles!" shouts the leader - the Harengon leap forward!

Initiative:

* Bel 21
* Kindle 18
* Inafina 9
* Oswen 9

The leader Harengon bounds up to us, landing directly in front of Inafina. It swings a club, but she dodges. A second jumps over and lands next to the first, also on Inafina; another club; pack tactics... Still misses. Bel is surprised at how fast they move, tries to get a shot at the leader who charged first. 23! Decisive hit, 1d8+3 -> sadly only 4 damage. Bel says, "It gets your blood running hot doesn't it! Tell me that this makes you feel good Inafina!" - she gets Bardic Inspiration!

Kindle acts. He runs up to position himself to try and protect Bel, then also attacks the leader with his huge mace... But totally misses! (Nat 1). He's huge and slow, they're small and fast.

A crossbow bolt flies towards Bel from another brigand; also nat 1. "Drats!" is yelled. The remaining brigand instead leaps up to attack Kindle, pack tactics, 19, hits for 5 damage. "Hand over the truffles and nobody has to get hurt!" Kindle says, "But I'm *already* hurt!"

Inafina just manages to hit the leader thanks to her bardic inspiration. Unarmed strike - we want to disable not kill. 7 damage; knocks the leader out. Flurry of blows on the other one! But both miss sadly, very low rolls. Oswen sees that and goes for the same one with Ray Of Frost, hits for maximum 8 damage. Oswen shouts, "Your leader is already unconscious and you're badly hurt. We warned you. This is your last chance to run!" - ADV intimidation, 17. Kindle adds, "Get your leader back to safety before he dies, you idiots!"

There's a moment of indecision - but then they start to drag the leader, especially as one other is now pretty badly injured; they head towards the raft. Oswen whispers to Kindle, "Just bring the leader back up... Just a bit..." and shouts after them, "We're on your side you know! We want to fix this land, not leave it broken! As a show of good faith, we'll save your leader."

Kindle uses Healing Word, bringing the leader back up. Oswen shouts after them, "And don't forget! We could've killed you, but we healed you instead. We're all on the same side you know!" but one shouts back, "You're crazy!" (flat persuasion only 3, worth a try though).

Once they're a safe distance, we risk boarding our raft. Oswen has Thunderwave in the back pocket in case they come back! But we're OK though we're starting to run out of water as the tide continues to fall. Back at the hill, there's some mud. Oswen goes, "Oh goodness, he really *does* have muddy feet. How awful!"

The trees have watched us come back in and help with the raft. We show the truffles, but they can smell them already! Straight up to Jinglejangle's, in the door and down to the cellar. She is already on her feet - "I could smell them from the top of the stairs!" "More than we expected too!" "Oh, that one is huge! I've never seen one that big!" - and pulls out plate. "Will you sit and have some truffles with me?" Oswen remembers Tsu's cookies and warning and says, "Well, the deal was for three. You can have all five, as a gift, but not a Fey gift, no rules. Just a gift. And we'd be delighted to have some, on the same basis." "OK!"

The plates are quite beautiful. Jinglejangle also puts out some mugs, then selects from the truffles. "The big one will be quite special..." - she shakes it, tells us to put all the mugs together, takes a knife, stabs it, makes an incision and a kind of earthy hot chocolate flows out! The cups are all filled. Then she cuts slices of what's left and serves each of us.

Her spirits are clearly lifted. As we eat and drink, she tells us stories about what's been happening.

* Agdon's brigands get bolder by the day! They've even set up a tollway so anyone coming or going from the Queen's Causeway or even crossing over towards Downfall must pay a fee. Kindle chuckles - "We'll see about *that*!"

* Agdon is *very* fast. The fastest and speediest Harengon. "You may not even know what hit you until you see the lightning flicker of his scarf whip past your nose!"

* This "island", as she herself calls it - cares for her. They met after Jinglejangle "came to be", wandering around lost in her mind. Telemy appeared out of the mist and sparkled. They both recognised that each and the other were facing the same predicament; lost and cut off. They supported each other.

* She tells stories to entertain the trees. The island provides her a home and protection.

"I wonder what will happen if you succeed and Telemy no longer has to stay here? Where will it go and will I be allowed to go with him?"

Oswen thinks. "Well, I can't be sure. But I like to think that, if this land were healed and became a place of dreams and possibilities again, that you'd both get to choose. To travel together, or apart, in whatever forms you might both take. That's what I hope for."

Jinglejangle remembers the promised key. She hands Oswen one. "This key tells me that it will unlock the door that leads to the place that Bavlorna keeps all the things she has stolen!"

Oswen gives Kindle the key for safekeeping. "Me?!" he asks. "You're wise and strong" says Oswen. "But of course, if you're worried, any of us could take it." "I can look after a key..." he agrees, perhaps with worrying lack of confidence! He squirrels it away somewhere.

Jinglejangle is sleepy and content. She packs the truffles carefully away in an otherwise-bare pantry. Oswen asks, "Now, the trees were very worried - you *will* try to eat something now and then, so they're less worried, won't you?" "Oh yes! Thank you for these truffles. These will last me a week! Maybe I'll brave the outside and hunt for more again." "Well, if you keep your eyes peeled, and watch out for those brigands, I'm sure you can do it safely."

We bid farewell and get outside. "Where now though?" wonders Oswen out loud.

The trees have gathered around. They seem happy. They seem to care very deeply for Jinglejangle, even if they seem to struggle to express it verbally. One leans forward and pulls out a dark garment, apparently made of spider silk. It puts it on the ground as thanks. "This was made by one of the Dark Children, but from spider silk. You must keep it away from direct sunlight. It will help you go unnoticed in the dim places."

(It's a piwafwi, and that's another thing for Kindle - the 8ft tall bugbear is pretty easy to spot normally!)

We're very grateful - we didn't expect any such reward, but certainly happy to get one. And direct sunlight, at least for now, seems to not be a concern! Between that and his Cupcake Of Invisibility, we seem to have things covered.

### 200XP each

Down at the bottom of the hill, the water has more or less gone. Can't use the raft! We ask if it's OK to leave it here, in case anyone else comes by who needs it? No problem. So for now, we proceed on foot, in squishy mud. "Where will you go now?" asks a tree.

Yes. Oswen was just thinking that!

- The stump?
- Downfall?
- Something else?

We figure:

* We don't actually know what we'd ask of Agdon at the stump, or if we'd just be accosted and robbed by many more Harengon than we can deal with.
* We're not sure if we're ready for Downfall! Getting in might be difficult, the toll payment is needed.
* Something else sounds good, but we don't know anyone or where to look.

We have some idea of where Downfall is - in fact, the stump is on the way. But is there anything else interesting? Other people we might speak to? We have close to no provisions and know just about nobody, with just about nobody joining our cause so far. Orvil has look for anything along the way, or thereabouts, which seems interesting - structures, hills, odd stuff.

ADV hawk perception dirty 20. He doesn't fly far when he notice a strange geyser. It seems to come out of a stone well! And what's more, as it spews out water, the water level rises. Could *this* be how tides work? He flies back and telepathically Oswen sees what he saw. Well, we have no raft, so rising waters are an issue; we decide to get there quickly and investigate.

We try to make good time but it's muddy. The water is, worryingly, definitely rising and 2 feet deep by the time we're at the well - Oswen is more or less swimming. Kindle picks her up and puts her on his shoulders, but we're on very borrowed time. "It can't *all* be coming out of here, can it, surely? Not this *entire* swamp?"

The well is strange. It's a kind of 10ft tall wide brick chimney, 2ft now submerged. Orvil perception 19. Right away, he notices strange little trinkets floating *on top* of the geyser. Surrounding the well, dancing in a circle, are will-o-wisps - motes of light. Oswen history 7, she's sure she's seen things like this before but knows little about them. But Bel, history 16, knows them! "Those are will-o-wisps. They're evil! They lure people to their deaths in stamps." He narrows his eyes at them. Oswen says, "But they're dancing. They don't *look* evil. I guess we should be very careful, all the same." "If I were an evil thing, it would want to look not-evil as well!" says Bel. Inafina insight 21, Bel's not lying but these really don't look harmful.

Oswen being Oswen says, in Sylvan, "Hello! Umm, I'm Oswen, can any of you tell us about this place? We're new here and a bit lost!"

There are 6 will-o-wisps. They float over immediately and gather around us. Bel has his lute out, as if ready to swipe it at them! They speak in our minds; in ideas, thoughts; they welcome us to the "**Oh Well**".

* The trinkets are theirs, kept in the well
* Whenever the water comes out they float to the top so they gather to make sure they're kept safe


Oswen nature this time even worse, only 5, she doesn't understand what they are. They're trying to introduce themselves to her... Inafina, despite -1 on nature, rolls nat 18->17.

* She makes sense of some of the images...
* They're fey remnants of creatures that lived here who drowned when the hourglass coven took control
* These wells used to be centres of social gathering
* Bavlorna corrupted them with her hag magic
* They now only spew out swamp water, and that's how she brings people down and asserts control
* A lot of resistance was wiped out this way

They therefore *hate* Bavlorna. They'd love to see her defeated! Inafina tells Oswen the brief version, so Oswen does her best to explain that we're here to try and figure out how to free Zybilna and fix the realm so it's not split up and restored to its proper condition. We *do* intend to tackle Bavlorna, but we're not yet sure how. In turn, they share the last moments they remmeber.

* They could feel a severing of Zybilna's control
* There were reports that she had been **frozen in time** in her castle, the Palace Of Heart's Desire at the end of the Queen's Causeway.
* The three sisters - we see via mental images, and that means we now see what all three look like for the first time - create earthquakes and tremors that destroy the causeway.
* We see a champion of the land - a brave unicorn tried to defend creatures and get to the Palace to save Zybilna, but Granny Nightshade managed to subdue and capture the unicorn *and removed its horn*, turning the unicorn into wood! (Sounds rather like the carnival carousel).
* A vision of Agdon Longscarf. Agdon was *nailed* to a tree! He was hanging 100ft in the air by his scarf. But then there's Agdon, free to run around, terrorising everyone and doing Bavlorna's bidding. *Something* connects the two.

We are asked what we intend to do. We explain that we will have to eventually get to Downfall to tackle Bavlorna. We do have a way into the place she keeps everything she stole, so we could return those - if only we knew who things were stolen from. We assume that many of the items aren't necessarily physical in nature. We also know we need to tackle Agdon, but knowing more about what happened between the tree and now is probably key to that. Persuasion nat 2, they *claim* that they don't know but they can share one thing - it was Zybilna that had attempted to control Agdon previously; he'd been doing raids into Prismeer from other realms but despite his great speed, Zybilna caught him. **He was meant to give her his prized scarf as punishment but he refused. He'd never be parted from it - so she made it so that he really could never take it off, ever, then pinned him with a nail to a sapling and made the tree grow!**

So - he's not going to be convinced to do the right thing. His followers must've cut the tree down to free him and that'll be the stump. His followers won't be convinced to do the right thing either, most likely.

A thought from the Wisps - he's very charismatic, but at heart, just a thief.

Do they know much about the land at the end of the causeway, before the Palace? Swallowed by the mist. But they've seen balloons that seem able to fly above the mists, so that must be possible. Bel of course knows all about that. So one option is to find a balloon (which brings us back to Downfall).

We wonder about disrupting the magic on the well. We know this isn't the only one though. We don't have the power or reach.

Inafina is getting worried - the water continues to rise, almost at her neck now! She asks if there's anywhere to escape the water; sit on the well's edge? Yes, that would work. Inafina doesn't waste time - she leaps up (ACRO 23). She drops a rope for Bel; he can indeed just about climb a rope, but it's clumsy; Kindle passes up Oswen then says he's fine in the water! He's not too cold.

So we sit around. Oswen plays her pan flute for the Will-o-wisps, who dance; Bel still looks suspicious. They can read minds and do at one point tackle that head on; "We're not evil, we're just tragic souls!"

There's a sudden gurgle. The geyser stops. The trinkets fall back into the well. Then there's a rapidly increasing rate of slurping, sucking noises from around the well; it's pulling water back in! The water level drops visibly quite quickly. It seems that there isn't a set cycle to it - the rise and fall is not predictable and is fast, so this is a significant hazard. At least it doesn't get deeper than Kindle is tall, so *that's* something.

Oswen wants to give the will-o-wisps a trinket but we don't have much. Some food from the carnival, her "wings", not much else... So she simply yanks off a brass button from her clothes and says, "Well it's not much, but it's shiny, and it'll remind you of us and maybe give you some hope..." - the wisps dance, bobbing around the button, seeming very happy. She's to put it in the well, so she does - drops it down.

Suddenly Oswen is surrounded by the will-o-wisps. They're touching her, as if being kissed by light. As they do, she has a strange feeling. "How odd" she says, out loud. It seems like a blessing!

* Any time in the next 24h she can roll a D4 and add it to any ability check, attack roll or saving throw.

The wisps float over to the other three and do the same thing. **We all have this strange blessing**. This is the **rule of reciprocity** - we gave a gift. Hospitality, reciprocity and the rule of ownership - the latter used to be strong in this land, but not now!

### Early afternoon, e.g. 1pm-ish, very guessed-at

The strange "cloudy sunrise" light isn't changing. Strange. We think it's early afternoon. As the waters recede and we're able to travel again, we face the same question. Where now? Well, we'd headed in the direction of Downfall. We know there'll be this toll and maybe we'll be faced with

She asks Inafina about what Harengon like. Halflings do get drawn to farming and bakery, no matter what their day to day lifestyle. Does she yearn for dry earth? Would we be able to persuade Agdon that he's stuck in a swamp forever and it sucks?

* Harengon are fond of marksmanship. 
* Competitive athletics too (marksmanship is part of that).
* Philosophy!

...so that seems like a "no". Orvil flies up and notices more things; giant frogs, another Oh Well a distance away, heaps of tangled mangrove roots; curiously he spots an abandoned skiff on the way back. So - shrug - we'll head there, maybe there's an owner or some sort of clue.

It takes about 20 minutes. The skiff looks like it got grounded and damaged. A broken plank along the side means it's no longer watertight - it hit a rock.

Our proficiencies with tools are... Wanting. We're good with instruments or disguise kits but not much else. As adventurers, it could be argued that our practicality is somewhat sub-par! Kindle can do Mending, but we'd have to hold the plank in place. How hard could that be?!

The three of us hold the plank in place as Kindle tries to get Mending to work - it takes a full minute and we have to keep dead still. Every now and then Bel tries to chat, but gets shushed! It works! But there's another on the other side. OK, another minute. It works! Again.

"So how do we pilot this thing?" asks Kindle.

Inafina hops right in. INT check, 11. If there was a long pole she could steer it but it's ungainly, not like a raft. This needs something better.

Oswen, INVEST 11+5 -> 16 - two parts of a single oar are half-submerged in the mud. It looks as if someone broke it over their knee in frustration! "Um - Kindle - got another minute...?" - it's a clean break, so Oswen carefully pushes the ends together (Oswen ATHL 13) so it meshes properly and do our best to keep very still while Mending is cast for a third time. Once that's done, she looks at something she'd seen earlier - what seems to be a burrow on a rise that looks high enough to stay dry. She points it out to Kindle, asks him to take the oar back to the boat then bring the others here, while she goes and looks inside and calls out - "Hello? Anybody home?" - no answer. Orvil flies in to look. It's dark, only some 10ft deep by 5ft wide.

It seems safe so she lights her lantern. INVEST 13, she sees rabbit feet prints and some discarded bits of food like apple cores. There's even a wax paper wrapping that probably had food in it once. In the corner, there's a small pouch that looks like it might've been left behind. She examines it, and finds three trinkets inside along with a few coins. It's big enough to even just contain a small hand-axe! The trinkets are:

* Salt shaker shaped like a wizard's tower
* A strange kind of bar of soap shaped like a fish, but which smells of - someone else's childhood?! Huh?
* A tuning fork (Arcana 14; this seems a normal tuning fork). She strikes it! It sounds like an 'F'.

There are a whopping 102 coins of various kinds! It's equivalent of around 16gp + 5sp all-in.

What happened to the owner, she wonders. These seem like random collected things, as if perhaps stolen. This might be the lair of a brigand, or perhaps a deserter from the brigands. But where are they now? She tries to follow the tracks (Survival 3+3, sigh, lots of bad rolls today). Water has washed most of the tracks away.

She heads outside and the gang have turned up. She asks Inafina if there's any scent trace perhaps, given the tracks are hard to see, but maybe... Nah. It all seems not at all recent. (Survival nat 1+3). She keeps the pouch with its coins together. Perhaps we'll find the owner one day. The handaxe could be useful though, and Kindle's strong enough to use it.

Oswen isn't sure she needs yet another mystery today yet here we are!

The water is rising again, so this gives us an opportunity to try the skiff. All aboard; one oar, so Kindle has a go at using it to paddle one stroke either side of the boat. Nat 20! He sits at the back, the rest of us balance at the front. "Where we headed?" he asks and Oswen says, "Well, I suppose, it's still the stump, but not if we can find anything more interesting along the way..."

Orvil perception just 13 this time. More of the same, kinda. Little islands, mangroves, but nothing stands out. So, we push on in the direction of the stump, for as long as the boat floats. If the water holds, we might be able to get there by what we guess would be evening. Or the equivalent.

It feels unwise to go into what amounts to enemy territory just before talk, essentially needing to set up camp there! So perhaps - one of those mangrove clusters might be a place to tie the boat, hide a bit, and hunker down with the boat as a sort of makeshift camp site. Bel says we should pick very carefully as it needs to be something that doesn't get submerged in high tide. We realise he's not expecting to sleep in the boat and Oswen realises Kindle would take up a lot of room. Well, there are some of the little hills Orvil saw, so they're more exposed but that'll have to do.

Oswen survival 16+3->19. Between remembering what Orvil saw and her own searching, she finds a hill *with* a tree. Nice!

When we pull up, we see no tide lines and indeed the water seems especially high - and lowering.We figure we should pull the boat up and maybe flip it over? Between Bel and Inafina (Survival checks) we realise we can support one side of the boat on the oar with it flipped over, then drape a blanket over it and it becomes a makeshift shelter that hides us quite well. We can even bedrolls down - Kindle's head would stick out and he says he's fine outside anyway. Besides, we'll be taking turns on watch.

Kindle asks if he should make a camp fire. Oswen says, "So long as we're sure this hill isn't also alive in some way - I don't see why not. If we attract attention, it's just more people to talk to!"

There's a bit of dry wood on this little island from the tree, along with some driftwood. It's enough for a small fire. What a strange domain this is! "Can anyone light a fire?" asks Kindle. Inafina is delighted and pulls out a tinderbox. Survival 3+3 - unfortunately she can't get it to catch! There's no kindling, for a start, and the box is a bit damp. Oswen nods and says, "I have a magic thing that might work..." and uses Prestidigtation. She reaches out her hands as if warming them by the fire, but they glow at the palms and it feels hot, which is enough after a few seconds to make the camp fire light. Inafina says, "Oh! That's great, it's much easier than a tinderbox."

"I guess it's my turn" says Bel. He reaches into his chest and pulls out a tea set. "I just need something to boil water in." But the swamp water smells bad. Kindle can purify the water with magic, we just need a container big enough. Oswen has her glass bottle, Inafina has her mess kit, Bel has his teapot and Kindle has a waterskin; so we fill everything and he purifies it. Now we can make tea! And we've got drinking water, too; we've had nothing since breakfast and realise we're very thirsty. Thank goodness Kindle can do that. Bel offers to make food, too, after very good tea; we're most grateful. He's come into his own!

He whistles as he cooks and sings a tune. Oswen joins in on the panflute. He sings of the strange land, a great escape planned, meets his new charges; "Bel's New Mission!"

Kindle had wandered off and returns with *two fish* he caught. "There are *fish* in the swamp with magic water?!" says Oswen, though they're ugly fish - but fish are fish all the same if well cooked. Oswen and Bel work together to figure out the cooking. It comes out great. The light finally changes as we do - a cloudy dawn becomes an overcast sunset.

Once we've finished, we're sitting around this tree, on a little island, under a strange sunset.

"Even though this place is damaged, there's so much interesting stuff to see" says Oswen. "But I must admit I'm scared - I don't really to know what to do. It's quite overwhelming - the scale of it all."

Bel says, "It reminds me of the great diplomatic efforts required to bring the new prince into the realm. It seemed impossible at first. None of us thought it could be done, at least not without much strife and possibly even conflict. But I recall that we were all of us just given individual small jobs to do, and would you believe it, in 3 days, we were able to totally transform the Summer Court into a receiving Ball for the prince's entire entourage. The queen was very pleased! It just goes to show that sometimes you just need to focus on the little things you can do and trust that everyone else is doing their part and all these little steps will come together into a grand plan. But... I suppose it's not as helpful if there isn't a grand plan to start with!"

Oswen says, "Well, we do have sort of a grand plan I suppose. Defeat Bavlorna, first, at least drive her from this part of Prismeer so we can start fixing things - well, everyone here can. And we need to get rid of Agdon or something!"

"If you could free Zybilna she could fix it all."

"But we'd have to *find* Zybilna. So that means getting past the mist. And then we'd need skills to figure out how she was frozen. I'm just starting out with magic, really; I don't have any idea how I'd do that. But I do wonder if something stolen might be involved. Something taken from Zybilna that maybe was powerful or important, that was a symbol of her ruling. But if we did get into Bavlorna's "vault", we wouldn't know what we were looking for. That's why we need to find more people."

"But it seems deserted here apart from brigands and a few isolated souls."

"I think that's why we need to get to Downfall, but we have to get past Agdon first."

Kindle seems sad. "It's just... I'm not sure Bavlorna's done all this. She wants to rule, but she doesn't appear to be ruling anything! Her subjects are mainly dead. She killed so many people - all those Will O Wisps. They were just denizens here. So who is she ruling? And why did she do all this in the first place? I don't understand."

Oswen had been trying to not think too hard about the whole flooding thing. Pretty grim. "Maybe magic can bring them back? Maybe Zybilna's powerful enough to restore the realm?"

"Maybe! Maybe that's what will happen."

We have to use some of our water to wash things up, but Oswen can use Prestidigitation. It takes a while but nothing's too dirty. Everything is carefully packed away, especially the tea set!

"How about some music?" asks Bel. He puts out four instruments. He can play all four, but his favourite is the Songhorn. "But when I play this, I can't sing." Oswen can play her panflute; Inafina can play a lute and borrows Bel's lute. Kindle can't play an instrument though. We wonder if he could sing? But he doesn't know *what* to sing. Bel has a drum and gives Kindle instructions! Performance with proficiency bonus in most acses:

* Oswen 20
* Bel 21
* Inafina sadly only 11
* Kindle 7

Kindle struggles to keep time but doesn't seem to care. He's just involved and having fun. Inafina's a bit distracted and it's not her lute - it's designed for a Satyr - but she gets by. "Brother and sister" pair of Bel and Oswen have a great time. Oswen's partied with Satyrs many a time and knows the gig!

With that done, Bel says, "Ah, if only we had something to drink!" and Oswen answers, "And you know perfectly well that it's a lot safer that we *don't*!"

We figure out watch. Bel hasn't used spells so he's happy to go in the middle with Inafina. Kindle will take the last watch, in case it's gone full dark by then. Oswen will start. Perception:

* Oswen, with help from Orvil sometimes - ADV perception (Oswen), 17 - it's all fine, except for a whole family of giant frogs that swim past! She hears all the croaking. They're very big and she doesn't a fancy being a meal for a frog.
* Bel - 20. Nothing to report.
* Inafina - 15. She sees a family of giant frogs swimming too - the same family we later realise, swimming back the other way.
* Kindle - 18. Nothing to report.

A restul, uneventful night.
