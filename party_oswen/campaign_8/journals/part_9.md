# Oswen: Part 1.9
## Day 12, mid-to-late afternoon
### Brigganocks mine - secret tunnel

We bid goodbye to Udo and start down the tunnel. It's a strange one - clearly Brigganock, only 3ft wide wiht donkey tracks, but 8ft tall. It must've taken a long time to build. Inafina goes first, Kindle insisting on being next; Oswen goes third, able to see through their legs! Bel guards the rear. Oswen gives Inafina the lantern as beyond a certain point, the tunnel has no other light.

Inafina listens carefully. Perception 16. A rustling that stops; she continues walking; rustling again. She is sure she can hear just a very faint breathing sound. Shallow... It seems to come from - Kindle? She says quietly, "Kindle, close your eyes for a moment". After he asks "wut?" he does it; she turns and shines the lantern on him. There's a tiny, sudden movement on backpack. She lowers the light to avoid blinding anyone and says, "Uli, is that you?" - a little face pops out. "How did you know?!" Inafina points at her big ears! "I was trying to be so quiet..." "You were! But these are good ears." (His Stealth was 15).

"I'm sorry I stowed away!" explains Uli. "But it could be so dangerous! You're of course welcome to come with us, but only if you know what you're getting into..." "You said it was just a scouting mission! And I'm very useful in tight spaces. And I'm worried about Golmo." "So are we. Look, if we get discovered, there'll be fighting - you have to hide; in a backpack, or corner, or anything!" "I promise!"

So we carry on, now - with Orvil - six of us.

We keep walking. The tunnel is *long* - we walk for around 3 hours! It's getting late. And nighttime is when the performances happen... Hmm. Would that add to the danger, or be a useful distraction? Suddenly Uli says - "Put the light out! We're nearly there!" so Inafina does that and hands the lamp to Oswen.

Uli and Bel converse using Message. Then Bel tells the rest of us the outcome, again via Message. "There are bricks that have been loosely put back at the end of the tunnel. They can be removed to create a crawlspace. It'll be tight for Kindle - only 3ft by 3ft - his shoulders will be a squeeze, but the hole is square so the diagonal should be OK. "Golmo was being held in a cage in the adjoining room - the large workshop which the storeroom we enter backs onto." And the Warlock is in the workshop. Uli says, too, that she has a goblin helper. They weren't able to free Golmo last time because they just couldn't be stealthy enough. They could see his cage but not reach it! Very frustrating. Uli describes the store room as cavernous! The size of a city. We think that probably translates into 50-60ft across, based on the size of Wish Come True, the Brigganocks' city.

Uli runs into Kindle's backpack. Oswen with Message this time - offers the plan of getting in, having maybe Orvil have a look, see if there's a way to get through the workshop - especially if performances are on or started as the workshop might be quieter then? We don't know. We do have one more PWAT sycamore seed and this seems like if there was the ever the time for it, but in that case, we really need to try and get Glister.

Faces are kind of stern and concerned. Then Inafina nods, and Bel and Kindle. Kindle says he might cast Silence if he needs to - Oswen nods - she'll work with it if she has to! Bel likewise. Keep clear if we can. We'd have basically no working spells. The sycamore seed's spell only lasts an hour, so we decide to remove the wall bricks and create the crawlspace *before* she uses the seed.

Bel points at the helm and Messages - asking Oswen, can she use it to detect if anyone is in the storeroom? She doesn't know, but the range is quite small. It's probably better to keep the charge just in case and check with more conventional means.

Kindle has to squeeze past Inafina to remove the blocks, as quietly as he can. Bel is helping with Mage Hand. As soon as one is removed, Orvil flies in. To Oswen's surprise, looking through Orvil's eyes, it is not dark; there are small red lights. Perception is only 9! He doesn't see anyone. Inafina hears voices, though in the distance... Then a louder voice, "Hurry up! Get those over there!" so she motions to Oswen who pulls Orvil back. We all listen carefully now.

We hear activity, but it doesn't seem to be in the store room. It's in the workshop. Of course, someone might come in any moment... We have to take the chance. Their noise might mask our noise anyway.

We start removing more bricks. Once it's a big enough hole is opened up, Oswen fetches the seed and casts PWAT.

Inafina climbs through first - she's going to help Kindle, who has to keep his arms down at his sides and be carefully pulled through. The rest of us get through easily enough. We listen again for the noises in the adjoining room. There's no door! Just an open doorway. We hide behind barrels, split into two groups of two (plus the tiny creatures). Oswen can get a line of sight; perception 14 and stealth with PWAT 28. She sees right to the end of the far room, where a big glowing fire casts light but she can't see the fire itself.

The store room is a mess of boxes and crates and barrels and tarps. That's part of why the wall hadn't been noticed in any way - the place is a mess anyway! An 8ft diameter circular wooden disc, painted to look like a smiling moon, leans against one wall right behind Kindle and Inafina across the doorway (in the storeroom). A stage prop.

Through a wide ~8ft doorway she sees a tall, well dressed (in a stage costume) elegant-looking human lady in the next room, green costume, pink bows; *perhaps* the warlock; she has a strange tattoo or birth mark on her face. History 17. That's familiar... Wait... Ah! The portrait of Baba Yaga in Thither. In this case, though, looking closer, it looks like something maybe tattooed on? And *then* it comes flooding back - all those vision from the Helm when we were being followed to Wayward Pool... Skylla *is* the League Of Malevolance warlock. Her patron *is* Baba Yaga... Oh. Well, in a way, that's one less warlock to worry about!

There are also a couple of goblins scurrying about carrying what are probably more props, who go through double doors that she briefly sees open onto some kind of dock-like thing; cranes, of all things, hook them and start lifting them - to the stage presumably. There's also a darkling darting about in the shadows, holding some trinkets and a folder. She's too short to be able to see on the table they are stood next to, but can see the edge of a gilded cage and a small ball of light that floats above it.

Suddenly she hears - "Pssst! Pssst!" - and looks around, for where it's coming from... A corner across from where she is; she scurries over quietly. A wooden marionette is here, carved and painted to look like a skeleton. It's all tangled in its own strings. "I seem to have got myself into a fix!" it says! She doesn't know if this is at all important - but this thing *did* already see her and call to her - insight 3+1->4 - she figures she'll try and untangle it. SOH 9, can't do it. Bel wonders why she's gone over there and creeps over too... She points and motions, so he can have a go. *His* SOH - a whopping 27. No problem! He finds just the right bit of thread to pull on and it all just sorts itself out.

"Thank you! My name is Break A Leg. What are you doing? The Brigganocks created this - this thing. This tunnel that you came out of it. Where does it go? Is it an escape route?""

It seems to want to escape. Oswen says, "Can you walk by yourself with all these strings?" "Yes. Oh. Actually. I'm not sure what happens... You could try cutting them? I was one of Endelyn's early toys that she experimented with... I'm sort of... I'm a little flawed. She's not very happy with me. I'm not as - sadistic as she makes the later toys! I want happiness and comedies and stuff. She can't bear it! She threw me down here."

Oswen says "If we cut the strings, we'd better use Lyn's magic scissors or else it might make matters worse - the spells might be intact but the strings useless. So, how about, I carry you just outside, to the other side of that opening, and you wait there for us to come back?" Persuasion is only 4. It wants to leave now. Oswen says, "OK, OK, fine; if you don't need our help to leave, head out that way. But can you at least tell us anything about how we might get through here undetected? Or any weaknesses?"

"Undetected? No! Weaknesses? Hmm. Well, I saw Endelyn punish one of the goblin artisans who made that beautiful moon" - points to the one we saw - "because when she saw it she totally lost her mind and had it hidden in the store room! She turned the goblin into a mask! She's clearly terrified of whatever this thing is... Well, I've seen her send the goblins against their will - threatening them - forcing them to climb to the top of the tower, to fix the lighting rod. There was one time, such a bad blizzard, it nearly knocked the rod off. Everything stopped working! Even the orrery, the doors, the stage, everything. One of them fell... I don't know what happened..."

Oswen helps Break A Leg through the crawlspace opening. "Tell the Brigganocks that you met Oswen and she asks them to help you if they can."

"Thank you. There is... There's... Not everyone here is bad! **Kizz** and **Wart** are two of the worker goblins, not here right now, they're asleep around the corner; they're good people. OK. Thank you!" and he shuffles off, strings precariously dragging behind. The head turns 180 to smile and he waves.

As Oswen's behest, Orvil flies up and over to look at the back of the big stage moon. She expects a sun, but there isn't one. This is just a moon. Gleam was banned, she kept Glister, ostensibly because Glister could be the sun in an enacted eclipse. But this is a moon, and Gleam is moonlight, so what's the problem? Ah. The moon must block the sun - a solar eclipse. So Glister, a sun, couldn't get behind the *real* moon but could end up behind this one.

It might be useful, and good to know it is here. But it's very big. We'd need help getting it on stage and maybe that's where Kizz and Wart come in but first thing's first!

Inafina's turn to look around the corner. Stealth is nat 6, but with mod and PWAT, that's still 23. Inafina sees the warlock. She has a fan that she flicks and fans herself with, but she holds it as if a weapon. She seems to practice lines or something? Must have a part in the play.

Inafina's height means she *can* see onto the table. The cage holds a Brigganock, chained to the cage, that keeps looking up at Skylla as if to see he's being observed; he's crouched over a huge pad with a piece of charcoal; every time she looks towards him he starts writing; when not observed he stops. Then Skylla glowers. "Why are you being so slow? How about if I gave you some motivation?" - she swats the ball of light with her fan; as she goes to swat it, Inafina sees Golmo look terrified suddenly, clutching his chest. But she stops just short. "Hurry up! Or I will hurt it!" - and he becomes a literal *blur* of activity, magically so, working at incredible speed. Insight is nat 1, but religion is 19-1 -> 18, Golmo has checked to see if this light thing is OK and breathes a sigh of relief. When closer to it, he seems more alive. The light is near the cage, as if bound to it by invisible chains. The best she can surmise is that this is some kind of life energy or life force, separated from him and a means of control, bound to the cage as he is, **so both must be freed and someone rejoined**.

The darkling says something to Skylla. It's told to go upstairs. So now a warlock and two goblins, and they might be bad, but they're probably not happy with Lyn even so. Speak of the goblins, they close that dock door. Is it now or never?

Inafina motions pointing at her head to Oswen. Oswen casts Message. Inafina says, "Can't see how to avoid fighting warlock. Now or never?"

Oswen looks worried but then nods and messages the other two.

Kindle gives himself the watchful initiative bonus as he is readying Silence and needs to cast it quickly (and has told Oswen that in Message, and Oswen has pointed to her mouth and ears to warn Bel, we're getting good at miming - was it meeting the Waterdavian Mummers?!)

Then the usual hand signals - 3, 2, 1... And out we jump!

Initiative:

* Bel 18
* Inafina 15
* Oswen 13
* Kindle despite all that and even with Guidance and ADV., only 9

*But!* We're not the first to act, so we get stealth rolls with PWAT from the seed still up.

* Bel 29
* Inafina 20
* Oswen 18
* Kindle 25

This means that one of the two goblins, furthest from the store room, is surprised when we emerge. Bel runs out to get a line on the warlock and - still in the store room! - calls out, "Release the Brigganock prisoner! Hand the Master Engineer over!" - the warlock whirls around to look in his direction; she looks startled. Bel casts Faerie Fire at her. She fails to dodge the effect and is surrounded by the halo. Bel quips, "If you want to be in the limelight, *be* in the limelight!" - and he grants Bardic Inspiration to Inafina.

(All attacks for now are at ADV with Faerie Fire on the warlock).

Inafina runs up and is able to get right next to the warlock. She figures spellcasters don't like melee - Oswen certainly doesn't! She lunges with the spear, 25 to hit, max 12 damage straight off. The warlock reacts immediately and *teleports* (!) into the corner of the room. "No fair!" shouts Inafina, uses a Ki point and is able to dash over; a wild attack, 14 to hit - that's enough! - and another good damage roll; 10 points. That's good, but the warlock is now a long way from the store room.

Oswen makes it into the main room but her line of sight to the warlock is blocked by Inafina. So, she chooses Minute Meteors. She doesn't want to the maybe-friendly goblins nearby so she aims for a door just behind the warlock, who's caught off guard and fails to dodge the shattering bits of rock. She takes 2d6 -> 5 x 2 -> 10 damage.

Skylla only now realises she's lit up with Fearie Fire. "Damn it!" - she can't become invisible. "Meddling furries!" she shouts in anger, then a burst of magical colour sprays out all around her. Hypnotic pattern. Inafina needs a WIS save but only rolls 5 + 3, but thanks to d8 bardic - rolled at max 8 in a remarkable stroke of luck - her save total is 16, and that's enough; she averts her eyes and avoids being charmed. Enraged, Skylla has little else left but to swing her staff at Inafina; **and it's a crit!** Poor Inafina gets thumped very badly; 2d8->9 bludgeoning + a huge 6d8->22 lightning. Ouch! Thank goodness for the 10 temp HP.

The warlock reaches for the door, as if to escape. Inafina goes in with the spear - "Oh no you don't!" - and gets an opportunity attack. The d8 + 4 damage is only 8 this time, but it's enough - to Inafina's great surprise, the warlock falls to the ground!

Suddenly Kindle runs out, roaring and ready to cast his silence spell - then stops mid-roar freezing in his tracks - "Wait, what did I miss?!" Unintentional intimidation roll - 9, stopping half way does take the impact away a bit! The goblins are surprised but not intimidated. Kindle thinks quickly, and uses his bonus action to cast Healing Word on Inafina, as he sees that she's quite injured. 11 regained. Inafina tries to be nice, but having just stabbed the warlock to the ground she's quite scary - persuasion 9!

The surprised goblin doesn't move but the other makes a run for it, reaching the table where the captured Brigganock resides. Bel immediately steps forward to try and de-escalate; persuasion nat 19 for 26. *That's* enough. The goblin calms. Inafina stows her spear and backs away from the surprised goblin, "It's fine, honestly, I think we're on your side! We want to stop Lyn."

One seems on board. But the other says, "But why do you want to stop her? What's the meaning of this?" - Inafina notices him looking to the corner of the room and calls out to Bel, "Watch out, he's eying up the door!" just as Oswen is saying "Well Lyn's captured friends of ours, hurt lots of people, and plunged this domain into eternal night. All of that is bad!"

The on-board one says "Yes, she *is* very mean! Why do you feel loyal to her?"

The other says, "If you please her enough, don't you want to - do the right thing? Do well? Get promoted?"

Oswen says, "But it doesn't work that way does it? Like the goblins that went up to fix the lightning rod and died. Lyn doesn't care about you."

"How do you know about that?!"

"Point is, we both know." Oswen tries to be persuasive but it's a nat 3 + 0! Hopeless. He's not listening.

Inafina gets up close to the "bad" Goblin. "So what are you gonna do next?" "Well unless you want *all* the other stage hands down here, we have to get the next scene ready! And unless you help, it'll be really obvious how late we are!"

Oswen gets up to the table, meanwhile, whispering, "We've come from your friends. We're going to try and get you out of here." Golmo points at the light - "She took my soul!" - Oswen, Arcana 21, recognises this as a Magic Jar. Dispel Magic or Remove Curse would do it. She doesn't have those spells dialled in and explains the predicament to Bel while Inafina is hearing about what we need to do to get the scene ready, Kindle helping.

Bel casts his last L3; Dispel Magic. The spell is higher level; it's tricky; but his spellcasting check is 19... It works! He could've dispelled the most powerful spell in the world. The chain around the light shatters and it rushes towards and into Golmo. The cage opens (though Golmo was changed to the outside). Oswen gives Bel a hug - "Wow! Well done!" - while Golmo offers thanks. He runs to the edge of the table, grabbing his drawings. Oswen says, "Uli is here with us, hiding in Kindle's backpack... He was keeping out of danger..." - but then she sees Uli already running over and Oswen helps him onto the table.

Uli and Golmo hug. Golmo protests; "...but Uli, this is too dangerous!" "I wanted to rescue you! We've missed you. Everyone is very worried about you. We dug a tunnel and everything to come and rescue you!" "Oh! Well..." - he looks to us, and Oswen realises he's kind of thinking - "Do we need to stay here?!"

Golmo points to the body... "*She* is an honoured guest of Lyns. She goes by the stage name of **Charmay**. For some reason, she believes that her future believes here, with Endelyn. She's very mean!"

At this, he's reminded of the Orrery. "Uli, I will come with you - but we must help them first." Golmo gets some paper and does that crazy, sped-up time thing - a very complex diagram is drawn. He hands it to Oswen. "These are the schematics of how the lightning rod harnesses the power that drives the Orrery and in fact *everything* in Motherhorn. If you could somehow pull that lightning rod out of its socket and send it crashing down the mountainside, this entire place would stop operating. It would put her Orrery Out of Tragedies out of commission. It can't run without power. That's why she trapped me here - to keep everything running."

This confirms what we were told; **there is one failure point**.

Oswen goes to the body. Even with Bel's help fails to do any good investigation - ADV 2,3 + 7 -> only 10 - perhaps she's still distracted by holding up the meteors spell for its full 10 minutes, just in case.

**We could perhaps still yet save her**. But there's a bit of darkness now in Oswen; things went to badly wrong with Sowfoot. And this character isn't someone who'll ever help us. Bel suggests "does the helm work when people are unconscious?" and that feels *very* dark but - that seems to be this world. So Oswen tries it. WIS13 save; 7+4->11, so surprisingly, she fails - and to Oswen's surprise and to a degree distress, it works. She learns:

* Skylla was going to use a magic word that Endelyn had taught her, to **animate 8 otherwise seemingly innocuous items in the room** - the wrought iron gate, stove, a wooden coffin, a statue of the elf king, a wedding cake on a small round table, a stuffed boar mannequin, a 6ft tall canvas golem and a 6ft tall painted statue of an owlbear.

* She's annoyed at one of the goblins - a tailor, who was helping her get outfitted for her *debut* as Charmay. In an hour, at the end of the show, she would have a monologue.

* She has no loyalty to the League Of Malevolance! Its leader has ambition that she considers to be petty and beneath her. He thinks he can steal the magic staff from Ringlerun and would be as powerful as "he deserves to be". He came to Prismeer to blackmail Zybilna into taking Ringlerun's staff; Skylla never figured out what leverage he had over Zybilna, but it must be considerable if he thought the plan had any chance at all.

* Skylla *betrayed the league* - she had secretly already met Lyn and been shown through a puppet theatre performance (!) what her future was... Skylla is fatally betrayed by the League. So she betrayed them first; she leaked their plan to the Hourglass Coven.

* The League's members arrived at the palace, but the hags lay in wait. They used the League as a diversion while the 3 sisters enacted their rebellion against Skylla. **The League has been working for the hags unwillingly ever since.**

* Skylla is proud of the trouble she's caused for her former comrades.

Oswen has to push past her feelings of distress, immorality and disgust; Oswen pushes deeper - a contest of attempted Deception against Oswen's Arcana. But Oswen rolls nat 20, for 30 Arcana.

* **Zybilna is an alias used by the Archmage Iggwilv** - so **Zyblina *is* Tasha**

* She hales from a world called **Orth**

* She became Zybilna for reasons unknown to Skylla.

* Is this what Kelek had as leverage? Surely that's too weak?

* Iggwilv is an adopted daughter of Baba Yaga.

* The true daughters - the Hourglass Coven hag - have always hated her for usurping their rightful place in their minds; Iggwilv *is* Baba Yaga's favourite

* She saw the hags using Iggwilv's cauldron, which is _very_ powerful crafted with help from Baba Yaga herself with ancient Archhag magic - to trap Iggwilv in time.

* **The cauldron could be destroyed with a Flametongue Sword** just like the one wielded by Warduke, Kelek's bodyguard.

* So we could destroy the cauldron or find the unicorn horn (though we don't yet know how to *use* that horn).

Oswen takes off the helm and just sort of stares into space for a bit. Bel asks - "What is it? Are you all right?" and Oswen says, "I don't think we can let her live. But I don't know if I'm strong enough to just let her die..." - she doesn't know how to resolve the dilemma... Bel flips a coin! He catches it, goes down on one knee and whispers something in Skylla's ear. There's a soft exhalation of breath and Skylla lies still.

"Don't look. It's done" he says.

Oswen is frowning but just says, "Zybilna is Tasha. Iggwilv. They're the same person. Zybilna is the fourth daughter."

"WHAT? Are you sure?"

"I'm sure. She couldn't stop me, and it was clear as day in her mind. That's why - that's why it *is* a cauldron in the first place, her magic - didn't that seem strange to you? - and that's how come it's so powerful."

Kindle and Inafina are approaching. Oswen says to Bel, "For now, perhaps don't mention how Skylla died. I don't know how Kindle would react." "OK".

Inafina notices in the folds of the clothing that there's a script. "Lamentations of a Misunderstood Warlock".

Oswen says, "She was to perform that. Her debut. In about an hour. In some ways, that would be an opportunity to try and enact some kind of eclipse scene; but I don't think we're ready to take on Lyn yet. I don't know. Is now the time? We came to rescue Glister. But that would be the sun and the moon is in a big painting in the store room!"

It's too much, all in one go. But someone has to act this out, else the gig's up, and we're trying to keep up appearances. Inafina could wear the costume but is obviously not a human warlock. Oswen lacks the height and the illusion magic to pull it off. Perhaps, then, we just treat this as a sharp deadline - we must be gone within the hour.

Oswen was thinking of hiding the body behind the other side of the tunnel; Bel suggests (chaotic neutral!) that we just *drop her off the props dock* - off the side of the mountain. Oswen's frown deepens and she agrees. But she's got all manner of trinkets and artefacts, which it would be stupid to just let go. So to add insult to (her) injury, we plunder.

* A necklace maybe worth 250gp.
* Two rings, worth 75gp each, of unusual construction; wyvern scale, mabye?!
* An Eldritch Staff.

Uli and Golmo depart with haste for the tunnel. We pull over barrels and a tarp to temporarily hide the entrance - it wouldn't hide it if searched for, but at a glance, it's not visible.

The "friendly" goblin asks if we're here to "help us all?" and Oswen says definitively, "**YES**".

He says that many of the goblins here have at one time or the other "pissed Bitter End off" and they "get taken upstairs to a horrible, horrible place... They get turned into masks by some strange device that she has. She punishes people by cutting away their shadows; it leaves them unable to be inspired - it makes them depressed and doubtful. She keeps all those shadows in the Shadow Theatre. **If you go in the Shadow Theatre, please free them**! Free the shadows by weakening their resolve" (attack them, take them to zero!) "and they'll return to their owners. But take care! They sap your will to live and your strength with their touch."

We know we need to get up to the "backstage" level. We're "understage" and there's a lift. The place the "not on board" goblin was looking actually has bunks and we know we have an ally now who will tell anyone he trusts there, so we don't worry about that. The other door, which Sylla was running for, leads to steps up somewhere, but we don't know what lies that way, so we stick to our plan.

We get on the lift and go up to the next level. We see the corridor leaving to stairs immediately - the lift arrives at the midpoint more or less - so get up the stairs onto a landing and are confronted by a heavy curtain. Inafina, as quietly and carefully as she can, pushes the curtain to one side to peek through. Stealth with PWAT is 18+7+10->35! Oh. Just a prop room.

A mouse trap lies by a wall, but it's 8ft long and 3ft wide! There's a chest of wigs but they're all covered in spiders! On closer examination, the mouse trap looks like it's made out of some kind of foam. There's another curtain-covered doorway, and Inafina can't resist; she takes a peek around it. Ah! The library.

We discuss what next. We have to go through. Bel offers invisibility for a scout; Inafina listens well and is quiet; so that's our choice. She disappears from view and moves into the library quietly.

Rows of books... A magnificent hall, domed, tall bookshelves with ladders... But about 8 people too! 3 aremdark, cloaked figures are sat on chairs reading. 5 goblins are running around, cleaning or attending to the hooded people. Now and again one turns to a goblin, who nods and runs to a shelf; other books are fetched. Most of the books - hundreds of them! - seem to be quite similar looking; they mostly have black covers and seem held together with copper wire. Some are on tables or trolleys waiting to be put back. An hourglass is burn-etched into the covers on almost all of them. A handful differ but most are the same.

Hourglass coven?

She risks taking a look, timing flipping pages with people not looking at her. The book she picks sees that there is a smaller symbol above the hourglass, quite subtle. In this case it's a chicken's foot! It's handwritten and they seem to be rhymes. By chance - these are in *Elvish* script, surprisingly, which she speaks fluently. They sound rather like tragedies; accounts of different people. They seem almost chronological, but in this case written apparently by Endelyn. She checks another - same. Are they *all* by her? So many! And looking around - D20->8 - she sees a story that seems to be about time being the foe of the coven? But it seems rather unhinged. Not that the other two hags had seemed particularly grounded... But this seems rather next-level.

She starts moving around the walls looking for exits, but at one point the bookcases push her close to the three. It's near the main entrance, open, a view to the stage. These three seem to "look" at her - they look, closer, like Mr Charm. **Darkling elders**. She freezes - but they say nothing, and when she moves, they continue to observe. If she halts, sometimes they go back to reading or eventually lose interest, especially if she's nearer the walls. Up close, they look at her.

She returns to the group through the curtains and at *that* moment realises that she could hear the play in the library through the open doors, but here, the curtain strangely just cuts out the noise. It's most odd.

While Inafina does this, Oswen examines the wigs. They don't seem magical. In keeping with props and other things in the room. There's a small other corridor leading to another curtain.

We can't stand here all day... We end up deciding to risk it - we'll stick to the wall and shuffle around the library. When we enter, the goblins look surprised at first, but eventually seem to just shrug and go about their business. The darklings react the same too - so we're rumbled for sure, if these things communicate with Endelyn.

Everyone hears the play now. It sounds awful! Hammy sounding speeches, a bit muffled from distance, and dead silence from the audience.

We get to the back corridor; there's the spiral staircase; and a door, to the mask room. Inafina starts up the stairs but Oswen can't resist it - she wants to see the mask room and risks opening the door.

In the middle of the room a goblin is chained to a chair, struggling, with two copper spheres hanging on either side of its head! Another darkling elder stands in the shadows, pulling a level - lightning crackles down, leaping between the spheres, the goblin screams horribly; there is a shriek from a cage in the corner of the room, another goblin shouting, "BINKY!" and then, when smoke clears, there's another mask left on the chair.

The walls are adorned with countless wooden masks. Most look like shocked goblin faces.

This is just about the worst thing Oswen's ever seen. Bel, Kindle and Inafina haven't even made it into the room yet; the darkling has seen her; wise or not, she is compelled to attack immediately. Initiative:

* Inafina 13

The darkling doesn't respond in time and Oswen throws her spell, perhaps for the first time ever in pure anger; L2 burned, Chromatic Orb for lightning, but it goes wide (nat 3+8->11). She backs against the wall near a crate, suddenly *very* scared and feeling alone.

The darkling elder is looking around - surprisingly, as if for an exit - but Oswen's friends are in the corridor. It decides to cast Darkness. Oswen sees it coming; she doesn't want to burn her last L3, but if it's dark in here, *none* of her party can see and it's all over. She has to throw Counterspell in reaction. The darkling is now wondering - what next?! Dice roll; it runs to a cage and pulls out a huge rapier that looks like it's tinged with something - it puts it against the goblin's neck. "BACK! Back away! Or this one dies!" - but surprisingly the goblin says, "There are worse fates with Endelyn! Run! RUN! Don't let them get you!"

She says, "OK, OK, just calm down" and while doing that Message Bel, "Darkling has scimitar blade at goblin's throat. Needs to be held. Can anyone do it?" - she hears back, "Yes I can" and verbally Oswen continues, "There must be some agreement we can come to. Just let us take the goblin and we'll be gone." (Internally she curses - she said "we" instead of "I"!)

Inafina, on the spiral stairs, sees Oswen going in and tense up, so starts runnings down to push past the others. Bel doesn't get time to warn her but in the room it's immediately clear that there's a stand-off so she gets to the other side of the door from Oswen, says, "Don't do anything rash!" and takes the Dodge action.

Bel moves in and continues the "calm down" narrative (which has almost certainly, in the history of conflicts, ever calmed anyone down!) "I think what we need everyone - is some calming music!" and, with his Bandore, casts Hold Person (very tunefully). It's quite a risk - but very fortunately, his spell works - the Darkling is frozen in the place mid-way through realising the spell cast and saying "Wait a minut - !"

Kindle runs in! He's *just* able to reach the darkling; he tries to disarm the darkling to get its sword. He manages to get it and throws it across the room. He calls, "Inafina! Get the goblin out of here!"

(We allow Inafina and Oswen to swap order here, long story...)

The Darkling breaks the effects of Hold Person, but Kindle has it grappled for now.

Inafina, perception 23, sees a key ring on the darkling so she grabs it and for her action unlocks the cage. The goblin runs away, but grabs "Binky" - the mask - on the way out; calling back, she shouts, "Thanks! I'm Vig!.

Oswen prepares to throw a spell, but calls out, "Tell us how undo this. Tell us how to restore these masks to the creatures they were." It responds in a sneer... **"Ha! You want to free these pathetic souls? I had very, very much pleasure watching them and their shocked expression freeze forever. Forever! As a mask! You can't free them. Each and every one of them contains magic that must be dispelled. You couldn't possibly be able to free them all. They belong to Creeping Lyn. You've crossed the wrong hag!"**

Oswen throws Magic Missile. Last L1 spell. She's almost out. She hope nobody bad realises. Not great damage - 10 total (3d4+3).

Bel tries Vicious Mockery. The darkling makes its save, though.

Kindle calls down Sacred Flame. *This* spell it fails to dodge. It takes 7 damage.

The darkling now tries to get away from Kindle's grasp, but Kindle *just* holds on.

Inafina tries radiant sun bolt; despite advantage only one hits and for minimum 5 damage.

Oswen tries something new; Toll The Dead. It fail its save; a very high 2d12 -> 21 damage; its eyes widen and it *explodes* in a bright flash of light. As it does, Oswen sees the shape of a small elf, which seems somehow freed and ascends! The bad part - Kindle takes 7 radiant damage and is temporarily blinded (CON save nat 1).

Oswen runs up to Kindle scared - he's blind! - but a moment later his vision comes back. She apologises for running off, but then describes what she saw with the mask and why she acted immediately. The group certainly understand.

There's an almost comical single mark on the ground in the shape of the darkling. Using rags, we try to clean that up - a dead giveaway. We close and lock the open cage, and take keys. Hopefully it just looks like the darkling is elsewhere.

Promising not to go on any more daft side quests and acknowledging that we're all now *really* low on spells, Oswen urges everyone to keep going. We run up the spiral staircase.

At the top, there's an opening into a very short corridor with big double doors at one end and, only a few feet in the other direction. Inafina is looking towards the doors but Oswen's eyes are drawn to an extraordinary, massive, gleaming metal contraption; long arms and spheres swinging round, clicking and clanking rhythmically, humming, crackling of static, wisps of mist. In the middle, Oswen recognises something from the blueprints - a really long copper pole, rising up some 10ft. It's attached at the top to another. This then rises **some 80ft** to the tower top and out beyond, based on those drawings. So this is *huge*.

Three goblins in overalls and tinted goggles, apparently untroubled by the noise, are sweeping the floor. They wear earmuffs except for one, who has the earmuff raised and is looking at a fourth - we recognise her, it's the one we just rescued! - holding the mask and gesturing wildly. Then they all turn to look at us! The goblin points and nods and - then they all turn the other way, very deliberately turning a blind eye.

Oswen nods to the others and we turn towards the double doors. Inafina has already been looking. On either side are two goblin-sized suits of armour. They're rusty, but have large halberds. The door is large, but has no decorations, or visible hinges, or even handles! She walks to one of the suits of armour and simply asks it, "May we pass?"

Nothing happens. She looks closely. There's a visor. She opens the visor (so much for no more daft risks). There's a scull inside! Oh, a skeleton - but then this precariously balanced suit of armour falls backwards and the halberd clatters to the floor. It's not animated at all. But now, the door starts to change shape; a large, skeletal-looking face, looking like Endelyn, appears. It's huge. The mouth opens. "You shall not pass! Back. Back! I command you!" - but as the mouth speaks, it opens a 1ft x 3ft hole in the stone. Inafina can see through briefly - beyond is an empty room with barred cell doors arrayed along either side.

Inafina says, "Careful Oswen - not too close - but I can see the prison. It is back there."

As long as Oswen is standing there, the eyes of the door seem focused on her. Oswen asks Kindle to come alongside, to see what the door does. The eyes shift to regard Kindle. It seems to just react; it's magical and perhaps little more.

Oswen Arcana nat 20 + 10 -> 30. This is a magically created guardian. It determines who can and cannot go through. The door has no hinges so must morph or bend out of the way. The magic clearly penetrates the door as we can see right through. Oswen figures maybe it could be tricked because it's simple. How would Endelyn go through?

We have the marionette; we know what Endelyn looks like. Oswen can do a static illusion about 5ft tall, which would be enough to cover Inafina's head and body, but her feet would stick out. Is there anything we can do to try and make those look like boots or the bottom of the big skirt? Bel looks around in his chest for his disguise components... And then pulls out the lacy tablecloth he uses for tea. It's ornate. He wraps it around Inafina like a skirt. It's not black, but it's the right style.

"If this works" says Oswen, "We can't go through with you and there's a risk that you'll get stuck inside if the door doesn't let you out without the illusion. So Orvil will ride on your shoulder. I can use his vision to see how to position the illusion."

Kindle clears his throat and says, "It's a bit of wild idea, but it's only for a few seconds - you can hold your breath - we have the strange bag, I think we could all fit and Inafina can just carry it. Oswen, you'd still have to stay here, but we can help Inafina with the jail cells."

Well, that'll have to do.

The other two get into the portable hole! Oswen does a passable job of folding it having seen Kindle do it. She starts setting up the static, repeated illusions. INT based deception (on the back of that nat 20), only 5+4->9. It's not good. She focuses on the face - we saw the portrait at the fallen tree in Thither. INT deception, 16. Much better - and in fact enough. The eyes roll back in the door at the mouth opens up into an 8ft high, 3ft wide opening. The others go through (and Oswen is thinking, "That's strange - it's the same size as a Brigganock tunnel!")

The door stays open and Oswen on impulse decides to try darting through. It works! And what's more, it stays open. It seems as long as anyone is here, it stays that way; so we let everyone out of the portable hole.

There are four cells, sealed by stone doors with barred windows. Large stone levers jut out from the walls. Oswen history 19. Something about the room... Something about the stone barrier too.. The levers... The workmanship... Oh, of course. Brigganock workmanship. That's why the door opens that way. So they made this, or were coerced into it, or it was made from stolen designs. Either way... Check the rooms. Only Inafina and Kindle can see inside. Three are empty. *A fourth is occupied* - an embroidered silk divan and a side table, a wall tapestry of a huge tree bearing golden fruit and covered in little houses; there are some delicate porcelain pots and vases... Reclining on the the divan is an elf wearing a half-mask of a sun, feet curled up, reading book while sipping wine from a crystal goblet. A crystal decanter stands nearby along with a bowl of strawberries and figs.

Inafina can't help herself and blurts out, "Well, this is rich! We can leave you in here if you find it comfortable!"

The elf looks up confused - "Excuse me, do I know you?"

"No but we know Gleam and we're here to jailbreak you!"

"What? My sister?!" - the elf stands. "My goodness... But - but no, I can't leave. If I leave, she'll - something will happen to her. Endelyn will punish her."

"Punish who?"

"Gleam!"

"But gleam is safe, or at least, not in Motherhorn."

"Is she not here?"

Deep breath. "She was thrown out. Her shadow was taken but we restored it. She's been helping us."

"She's free? Get me out! Get me out now!"

Cool. Oswen tries the lever. The door opens. Simple. "We have a bit of an issue getting you out... We might need to put you in a strange bag for a minute, to get you past a rather sticky situation in the library... It'll only be a moment."

"Endelyn can only be destroyed during an eclipse. I saw a moon prop in storage. If I were to stand behind it while wearing my sun mask... In her presence, I think this would count. You could actually bring her down! But also - well - we can talk once we're out of here!"

"Follow us, keep as quiet as you can, and don't worry about the goblins, but if see Darklings, let us know!"

Bel "hmms". "Do you trust us? I think I know a way to get you out but you have to trust us." He's decided not just to put her in the portable hole for our entire escape and run for it, best speed, nobody sees her at all, no risk.

Oswen shrugs. "Best chance you've got!"

"...All right!"

The door shuts. What timing. It doesn't stay open long, but we can get it open again. It takes a few tries and a few nervous seconds but Oswen gets the hang of it and we scuttle out. Now Glister climbs into the "bag" and we fold it up - and run.

Down the spiral staircase, we hear clapping in the distance. Well, there *is* an audience! We get to the library - a quick check - the darklings are still there, and the goblins, but for some reason, people are filing in - it's intermission! Oswen hoarse-whispers "Follow my lead" and slows right down. She starts wandering along, looking at the books, aping the other people. Group deception:

* Bel 24
* Inafina 19
* Kindle 16
* Oswen 15

Orvil keeps perched on Oswen's shoulder as nonchalantly as we can!

We slide through the curtains into the prop room. We're safe. No sound. We run! Nervous moment having to take the lift down to understage; we'd have preferred stairs. As we turn into the corridor we see more people and the same schtick is used. Against the odds we reach the back store room. Oswen says, "Kindle, draw up the rear, we need to try and put the bricks back" but Bel can do it with Mage Hand. The rest of us run through and Oswen immediately lets Glister out of the hole. Bel moves crates and bricks to hide the exit, hopefully it's good enough; and with that, with bolt down the tunnel, trying to be quiet, but trying to get to the Brigganocks as fast as we can.

### 1625XP for Skylla, Glister and other encounters

The tunnel; the chasm; the bridge; and back. Udo on the tunnel side is surprised to see us so quickly - "Uli and Golmo were afraid you might get stuck! Please head to Wish Come True. I'm sure the others would like to see you." The whole time Glister is telling us things she knows. She's been there a while and overheard a lot.

* She heard that Endelyn *does occasionally head over the Palace* and apparently there's a bell in the bellfry here that she has boarded up so nobody else can go in, except her; **that's how she travels to the palace**. Something in there. 
* **She's in a particularly foul mood currently, having lost a very important key;** sure someone stole it; or blames goblins for cleaning it up. It's not about the unicorn horn...
* ...because Glister did hear that a guest handed her a Very Important Gift, which was the horn.

Glister can barely belief her eyes when we reach Wish Come True and Gleam is there. There's a very long hug and some tears. Then Gleam turns to the party. "I can't thank you enough. I never thought I would see her again... I don't know how you rescued her - everyone - it's astounding to me! We think we can get to the Witchlight Carnival by the beacons. But..." - and Glister finishes - "...we want to help you." Gleam pulls out her mask to match her sister's. **"The two of us would be a depiction of an eclipse. We can make it possible for you to take Endelyn down. We'll stay until she's been deposed."**

It's super late. We need to go to bed. There's a lot of chatter and a celebration but Oswen whispers to her party that she'd quite like the four of them to find a quiet corner or go up out of the mine or something, just for some privacy; it's literally like excusing yourself early from a party. Four Brigganocks even come up struggling to hold, for them, a giant bowl of a mushroom wine for us.

Kindle says it'd be better to cast his hut up the top. Oswen is apologetic; their hospitality is amazing, and it's a great party; she's apologetic to her party too for pulling them away. But we head up. Kindle sets up the Hut just outside the mine entrance, so we get inside and are safe from prying eyes. We're glad of it too - it's stormier than usual. Heavier rain, thicker clouds, stronger winds that we've ever seen. Bel suggests we might be part of the reason for that!

Inafina insight 19. Looks to Oswen and says, "So stop pretending; what's going on..."

Oswen kind of falls apart. "I'm sorry I ran off... To the mask room... But I watched someone die and raided their mind and stole their jewellery and I **needed to make that *worth* something!**"

Inafina saw nothing but tragedies in her writings. The plays are about those. She orchestrates them in the living people. Kindle suggests there's maybe an aura? The way the swamp made us feel bad. And there was the pervasive feeling of corruption from the woods. Perhaps everything here at the heart of it is tragic? Maybe that's why we even suggested throwing her body off the mountain?! "It sounds like a script! Like someone wrote it. From her point of view she was about to debut in her one-woman show; she never lived long enough to even perform it..."

He's continuing but Oswen's just in tears. Hearing the tragedy read back just makes it sting more.

All she hears is his last words; "We have to get rid of Endelyn. To make all this stop."

"I wish I could believe we could blame her. Maybe we can. But I don't feel that. Maybe it just takes time. Or maybe it'll get better when she's gone."

Bel points out that he was the one who made her expire and suggested the body be simply thrown off. But Oswen put him in that position by being indecisive.

Anyway, the convo waxes and wanes. We do agree Endelyn must go. We don't know if Zyblina - now we know who she truly is - will help, but if she *can* undo all this damage, we'd better try really hard to get the unicorn horn instead of destroying her cauldron.

**Worse yet, we didn't manage a very important thing - Hurley. He wasn't in the prison. We don't know where he is.**

Eventually, Bel produces cheese and tea. We have a very late dinner. Oswen's feeling a bit better having got everything out, but nobody really wants to go back into the mines tonight so we just rest and get to bed. We'll figure out the rest in the morning!



## Day 13

Inafina has been examining the staff we got from the warlock. It's a strange thing; a sort of gnarled tree root appearance, without any other obvious features. It's somewhat crooked. No gems or spikes, but for the "top" having a particularly large lump, as if the knee of the root. She's unsure; it seems like it might be in some ways an evil object, but Bel points out that it's only as evil as its wielder - it's up to her how she uses it, if she even uses it at all. So, she decides to attune to see how it goes. She stows her spear.

Later, once attuned, Inafina gives the staff some test swings; being crooked she expected it to be harder to find her mark, but somehow it seems to almost tug towards her target. What's even stranger are the sort of wisps of what look rather like storm clouds that it sometimes leaves behind in its path through the air.

We figure our best shot is to get *invited* onto the stage to perform. We find a way to get Gleam and Glister in unexpectedly, and our stage story will dramatically change to an eclipse to catch Endelyn unaware. This perhaps means we take the invitation she gave us while others come in via the tunnels. We can use the Brigganock whistle to signal when they're meant to storm in, bringing Gleam & Glister up to the stage.

(Somehow in all of this we need to find the unicorn horn, the wish stones *and* Hurley. We also wonder if we found the missing key, that we might appease Endelyn somewhat).

This does raise various issues, not least of which they way most of our plans change within the first few seconds, but also, we have to get to Motherhorn on the surface, and that's a long way and quite tricky. We're sure we can figure it out.

So, we go back down into the mines, heading for Wish Come True to discuss things. The Brigganocks, who we thought might be rather hung over and sleepy after the big party last night, are all up and about and very industrious!

Gleam and Glister agree straight-up but immediately raise a problem. Endelyn watches performances from a view box high up in the tower, above the stage, accessed from indoors. We can't be both on the stage and up there, ready to tackle her, unless we find a way to make her come down lower. They say there are two levels of balconies below - there are the theatre boxes, only one level up, some 20ft vertically above the stage; another pair of balconies above up the two towers; that gets to her bedroom level, with a viewing gallery to look at the orrery. Her Ornithopter is parked there too.

Talk turns to the lightning rod. From the plans, the Brigganocks point out that it's a stack of 10ft tall heavy metal sections. To rip it out would require "the strength of 1000 Brigganocks". How about a giant cyclops...? Yes. But getting them up there would be difficult. Another way would be for someone that strong to pull it down from the ground using a long, strong rope; the Korreds could make one and we know the dance to "animate" it and get it to tie itself at the top.

* Find the cyclops and get him on board
* Get the rope made
* Coordinate via whistle for Brigganocks to get Gleam and Glister on stage

Two issues:

* Get Lyn down lower, within range
* How do we get that rope on there and get the rod pulled at the right time, without any of that being noticed by Lyn

On the latter, do it around the back of the building; her attention is out front; timing and coordination is an issue. Gleam and Glister point out that if the eclipse is revealed, Endelyn will run; so we must be fighting her first. So the idea is:

* Pull down the rod
* Goad or otherwise engage Endelyn as part of that
* With that underway, blow the whistle
* Gleam and Glister finish the grand performance

Glister is the sun but can't actually glow. It's just a mask. We could cast Light if we had it, or just give her the lantern - Oswen's lantern, given by Madrick. Seems poetic to have that as the sole source of light and drama for the eclipse once the rod is pulled down.

For getting Endelyn down - why not write her into the play? Flatter her ego, fool her into it. Bel is very good with deception and performance. He can be the Ringmaster of our play. Bel says, **"Yes, but let's go further! Make her the star of the show, and the show itself can *include* us attacking her. Combat just *evolves* from the show, as the rod is pulled down, then the eclipse." An even better idea of his - to work Kindle's Korred hair dance into the performance!**

Gleam and Glister decide to hang out with the Brigganocks. They'll end up in the tunnel, lying in wait. Molliver will go with them too, as he's larger and stronger. We will now head to the Korreds; that's an hour or three of journey, so we get started straight away.

### Late morning

We update the Korreds on our progress and the plan. The queen agrees to part with some of her hair; she convinces the other Korreds to do likewise. We end up with a rope 80ft long. Combined with the height of the cyclops, that should be just enough. But speaking of the cyclops - now we need to find *him*.

Given that we have to backtrack towards Motherhorn anyway, we search around where we found him before. Oswen helps Inafina look - her better ears and height help - Survival ADV, ends up 18. She spots a cute, small grotto with garlands outside! There's humming from inside; we recognise Amidor's voice. We call out, "Hey, Amidor! How are things?!" - he's surprised. We explain the situation and he says he'll help us find Mudlump. It's easy for Amidor to show us where the farm is. "Back to the scene of the rescue!" he says.

Mudlump seems happy, because the new queen is happy in the hive too. Kindle speaks Giant and explains the situation. Mudlump needs no convincing - the weather is terrible for the bees, they don't like it, and he correlates Lyn's arrival with it. Further, if the lightning rod isn't on top of Motherhorn, there shouldn't be the constant flashes of lightning travelling across the sky, which have bothered him for many days. He will help. We explain the plan with the rope and Orvil will fly in front of his face to get things going!

### Mid to late afternoon

Thanks to Amidor's guidance, a certain urgency that means we don't take necessarily the safest paths but instead go the most direct routes, we reach Motherhorn - rather earlier than we thought possible. The cyclops perches on the side of the mountain, resting and tending to his bees.

Amidor will work with the Korreds! They will storm the castle, since he is a valiant knight, once the lightning rod goes down. So they'll storm ground level, the Brigganocks flood into Understage and so-on.

* Goblins not to be touched
* Focus on shadows and darklings

We wonder about Hurley. And we realise the answer to most things is the performance and story. We work Hurley into it. Kindle could play his brother. Well in that case - if the story isn't fixed by Lyn, we can tell our story. The carnival, two brothers seeking to be reunited, entering the Fey; the queen of the domain is Lyn, so all seek her wisdom and - thus - here we are at Motherhorn. But the queen is no fool, and must be convinced that Hurley be released to his brother. But how to convince the queen... A gift, of course; two elven acrobats - and this is where Gleam and Glister appear. "A gift of two maidens", writes Bel. Oswen goes, "Maidens?! Can you say that?" and Bel says, "It's just a story. How about - two fairy princesses?" "Perfect!" "For release of Hurley and passage back home."

Bel is sure that the story will be read by Endelyn before she lets us do anything. That's how theatres work. So we have to make a convincing story. Oswen helps with what amounts to deception, with the Wizardly Quill adding some flair to the document. With Guidance, his Deception is 24. Not bad in the timescales!

Bel has been working on the script all morning and day whenever he can and, suddenly, it is done. So - no time to waste! We have an invitation.

### 4pm

This close up, seen from the outside, the castle is truly ominous. It takes a while to climb steps to reach it. Gothic-looking architecture. Scones with greenish, ghostly flames or lights. Gargoyle carvings. Buttresses, spires... The grey citadel-of-sorts in the centre looks almost hewn out of the mountain itself. Periodically, lightning hits the rod atop the topmost spire. Clouds of ravens circle, frightened by the lightning. Orvil eyes them, distrustfully.

Close to the entrance, Inafina hears rapturous applause. Oh. Something's happening! A play? We carry on. A strange spiral stone staircase goes up 60ft to a balcony of slick, weathered, grey stone. We can see a large balcony leaning on the opposite side of the balcony from the stage; a dark cloud encased in wiring attached to a balloon is there. **The storm balloon** - damn. Stall attached and all.

Oswen says, "Well, if she didn't know about her sisters before, she certainly does now, and she knows we did it."

"That's probably why she invited us."

"I hope at least that the two running that thing realise that we're basically the reason they own it now!"

The main entrance is a 12ft high door, no visible handles or seams. Fancy scrollwork surrounds it. As with the prison door, we are then spoken to by an effigy of Evelyn. One thing that's odd; "The moon twin is not welcome here". This tells us that the door must say always the same thing. Anyway, it's admitting us entry so, in we go; Amidor and Pollenna dart off, for the Korred rendez-vous.

We're in a hallway above the hallway we were in yesterday; the one where the lift from the Understage came up. There was a lower bit of ceiling above with what looked like a walkway and, indeed, it is, since we're now on it. Through a curtain beyond, we suddenly are on the edge of the huge, open air amphitheatre. People are in the process of leaving. The stage is being packed down. The crew goblins wear masks. Costumed actors hang around mingling, talking about the play. Very intricate contraptions, some of which are huge, rotate around and cast complex light patterns. A dozen or so shuttered cylinders seem to contain different colour Continuous Flames. We can hear clanking of gears and rattling chains near the direction of the loading dock. The drop must be very far off the sides. Thousands of feet! A raised area of the stage across in the distance is painted with a picture of the moon. It's about 40ft diameter.

Oswen makes a mental note that the stage won't be plunged into darkness fully; the continuous flames will keep going even if the lightning rod is down. Bel makes hasty amendments to the script, requiring the light to be dimmed (shuttered).

We aren't sure where to go, so Oswen leads the way and we stride out right into the middle of the stage. We get a good look here at the lighting, ropes and other rigs, and can look up to the balconies and viewing box. Looking up, we see a them; two separate levels, two balconies each. The lower ones have stairs up from the stage. We can reach those easily enough so we go and have a look; 20ft up as described. Tall, hanging drapes are set on the wall behind which themselves go up, surprisingly, some 20ft further and in the middle an 18ft mirror, in front of which is a plush sofa. Above the decoration, so about 40ft above the stage, we can see another floor with other balconies that from underneath look the same size, but poking out from one on the left we can see parts of the Ornithopter. Orvil flies to give Oswen a view. On the other balcony is chair, writing desk and cage full of paper birds. All is exactly as we were told - it hasn't been changed around.

Back down on the main stage, we check a northernmost exit; that just curves down to backstage. That's where the warlock would've emerged if she'd escaped out of the door she was going for. On the North West is a set of stairs up to a curtain; through there are various props, including a gilded throne with velvet seat cushion - perfect for our story's queen - Bel makes a note. We spend a bit of time looking around more... Nothing much seems "not a prop". Nothing remotely magical, not even devices.

(Note that we're not ever alone at this; people are buzzing around the whole time, even in the props room).

We keep just wandering around. In the prop room we visited yesterday (the Southern one), there was a narrow corridor that we never went down (East-West) with a curtain; Oswen checks it; a dressing room. It's again quite busy. There's another room off here that's where people are going after packing up from the dressing room. Of the three chairs two are empty. One contains someone Oswen is sure about straight away - dressed in a green costume, head removed, looking dejected, sits a Bugbear. She pops her head back out of the corridor to Message her party to come in straight away. Inafina appears and whispers, "Hurley?" - but as she gets closer she sees that he casts no shadow. He looks around confused. "Huh?" 

Inafina sees more - his reflection looks sickly and haggard. Oswen arcana 19; the mirror is magical; when she looks in it, she sees a skeleton of herself. She lets the party know - the mirrors are part of what keeps people low. The reflection lies! Oswen notices that as people behind us go past, some look normal; some look haggard; but only the four of *us* look like skeletons. Hmm. That doesn't seem good!

Inafina tries to help Kindle see if they can spot any pattern in haggard-vs-not, but their best guess is that we just have to try to talking to people. Most have now moved to the back room. So Inafina starts with Hurley! He's very dejected. Lost the will to live pretty much.

Oswen moves to the next room. Three other performers are here. It's a sort of common room, with several small bedrooms behind various curtains. As we listen to what people are saying to each other, or chat with them, we find that the ones happy about their performance look OK in the mirror while those who thought they did badly look sickly. It's not related to having a shadow, it seems more related to their quality of performance.

Hurley is in a bad way. "I can't seem to get anything right... I've looked this way for a long time..."

Kindle and Inafina have never seen him this dejected. Kindle helps Inafina try to get him to open up; Inafina ADV persuasion dirty 20. He says that he left the Carnival because he thought he'd found Gleam! But in fact - he'd found her shadow. And the shadow was deceptive; it convinced him his life would be greatly improved if he followed it through a mirror. So he did - and got to Motherhorn. Lyn convinced him that he was unpopular because he was unskilled, so promised him that he could learn Thespian skills here, at Motherhorn. She promised she would make him more likeable! But he had to relinquish his shadow, and work in her theatre for 3 years. But later he learned that 3 years here is not 3 years where *he* comes from - he doesn't know which "year" she really meant; he is also convinced his performances are awful and these mirrors show him what a terrible job he's doing. He thought he was getting better but doesn't believe it at all anymore. He doesn't even bother learning lines anymore! He thinks he'll be demoted to a Stagehand.

It seems we must find his shadow. That's the only way he'll get his mojo back and be able to perform!

We say we're sorry he's feeling bad; we won't pressure him into performance; we'll check out the shadow theatre (he tells us where to find it and warns us about a trap somewhere there!) then come back later to see how he is.

Oswen considers ways through the library. We've no idea when Endelyn might spot us and pull us away. She throws a coin - heads, directly across the whole place, from the nearby prop room; tails, we go out to the stage and round, into the main entrance. Tails. Things are nearly closed down now. Stage is being swept; seats cleared; and we get into the library. Just the darklings and goblins, no guests. We stick to the walls and head for the shadow theatre. One of the darklings looks over. "I'd be careful going in there if I were you!" Oswen says, "Any passwords or specific traps we should keep an eye out for?" "What?! No! Just be careful!"

Inafina looks closely at the curtain. Perception 24. Magical. Enchanted; well, to cut out noise. Nothing different from the others. So Oswen and her go through, followed by the others. Inside, we see a big full-size 2D painting of a library bookshelf, as if a prop. As we approach it swings away. The next looks like a raging sea, in a huge storm. Inching forward intending to not trigger it yet, Oswen gets too close - but all it does is swing back like the other one, nothing more. A third beyond; a moonlit graveyard. It too swings back on approach. We now see a curtain on the left. As Oswen and Inafina walk forward side by side, Aracana for Oswen and Perception for Inafina are not enough to spot the trap. DEX save: Inafina - very high, 26. The floor disappears! She jumps back onto solid ground rather than falling. Oswen: DEX 6. There's not enough enough time to react and activate her faerie wings. She falls 10 ft, landing prone in dirt; but fortunately, there's no damage.

Euw! Ah, nasty. Graveyard dirt. A tombstone is in front, wood but painted like stone; on it is written "Oswen Hafflethwaite"! She shouts upwards, "Oh, very theatric... Rope please!"

She's hoisted out, somewhat embarrassed. Not much of a trap - more a fright. If you were by yourself you might be a bit stuck though. The others walk around the edges and we push the curtain side. Inafina suggests that the floor probably re-forms above the victim in the pit if they stay too long - a chilling thought.

(Oswen is worried about battle with shadows very soon so she casts Mage Armour).

Behind the curtain - the oddest thing. Essentially, it's a kind of theatre, with a bright light. It all looks ancient, dusty and unused. A white moonlight globe hangs down at the front, casting long shadows, including fir tree shadows from two props on stage left and right. Hanging above is a trapeze.

We aren't sure how to make the shadows "visible" but think that maybe reducing the blackness of the "real" shadows might work, but passing through the nearest tree shadow Oswen "bumps into" a shadow. They're all hiding, as we thought. They sort of scuttle into other patches of darkness, so they become hard to see again. Oswen elects to use the lantern to shine at dark areas to reveal the presence of the shadows. In total, we think we've counted eleven by the time we've looked around.

We figure, the only way we know to solve this problem without lots of curse spells (which we don't have) is to "kill" the shadows - they reattach - so Oswen shines a light to reveal one and calls out, to at least try it, "We want you to go back to your companion bodies. Will all do that?" Persuasion nat 18+0.

Most ignore her. Two shadows come forward. One is a goblin and one is a bugbear. We'll take that chance; we can fight the rest later if we must. The two look puzzled. She points to one and says "You are Hurley" - it nods. To the other she points and says "You are Vig. We rescued your body from a cage. You were about to be turned into a mask!" and Oswen asks, "You are willing to rejoin your bodies, but I think - and nod if this is true - you do not know how?" They sort of shrug. Odd. Inafina insight 17. The shadows don't know how to answer that question.

Oswen can't really decide; cut them down? Blow L3 spells? And we were pleaded with to free all of them. That could hurt us a fair bit...

Oswen thinks back to Skylla lying on the ground and what she did then.

..."Let's free them them all" she says to the party. She steps back from the two and says, "I *think* this won't hurt a bit. Try and trust us!"

So her call - free them all. Is that redemption? It could equally be hubris or ego. Initiative!

(MUSIC: GENSHIN: INEVITABLE CONFLICT)

Kindle is the first to act; he calls upon his Spirit Guardians to help. It's so counter-intuitive to attack things we're trying to save! 3d8 radiant potential only 11 (but he hopes they're vulnerable to it - and they are) at the start of turns of creatures in the effect. He wants to protect Oswen a bit so moves between her and the rows of chairs where the other shadows are hiding.

One of the shadows takes a full 22 from Kindle's spell and is sent back to its rightful owner; and another; a third does better, then is at a loss; it wants to move forwards and attack but doesn't want to just disappear! In the end it decides to run in and tackle Kindle - and it hits, dealing 7 necrotic and reducing his strength by 1. Bel sees Kindle suddenly struggle in a way he hasn't seen before and *that's* when we start to realise that these creatures could be far more dangerous than we had expected.

Bel throws Spray Of Cards outwards at some more shadows in the nearby seat rows; 3 are hit; 15 force damage potential - fail, succeed (half damage), fail on saves. He then gives Bardic Inspiration to Inafina.

One of the 15-damage shadows is hit by the Spirit Guardians and disappears.

Inafina gets a radiant sun bolt hit on a distant shadow for max damage of 10 -> 20 taken -> it vanishes. She gets a hit in on the next, but for only 6 damage; Ki point spent, with bardic she gets another hit and it disappears; one more; just gets another hit, 14 damage taken, it's up but it'll be vulnerable to the spirit guardians now.

One of the shadows that Bel hit reappears behind us, using that "shadow teleport" feature. It runs in to try and get Inafina, but runs straight into the 15ft radius guardians and even making its save, 11 damage is enough to take it out. Another one promptly vanishes too! Now the one Inafina just hit moves behind the other end of the stage, but then vanishes from view, and keeps its distance.

Interestingly, the two closest to us that we were talking with *do* trust us - and willingly vanish, taking full damage from the guardians.

Oswen can't see where the other shadow has gone, so instead tries an area effect spell; Thunderwave is cast, with Chromatic Orb used to change the damage to lightning hoping that it'll be effective. It would take a solid 2d8->14 (!) damage but is *resistant* to the damage, so only takes 7 - but that's enough, given the previous damage it took.

Kindle, feeling weak, chooses to try a spell to attack the close-up remaining shadow that hit him. It fails as the shadow dodges, but then his spirit guardians - now at potential 12 damage - takes its toll. The creature again saves from the worst of that, but being vulnerable this means 12 damage is taken and it vanishes. 

None are left.

Oswen gives Kindle a big hug - he was brave, took a fair injury instead of anyone else and his spell was very effective. "Just in case", she has a quick check with the bullseye lantern around the theatre to see if there's anything of interest. Investigation - nat 20! 27 total. Well, if there's nothing here, she'll be sure of it. But in fact there's something odd. On one of the seats lies a beautiful crystal and gold pair of opera glasses. They aren't magical but they're certainly valuable - as much as 250gp. There's also a gold filigree mask with iridescent blue and purple feathers; perhaps 100gp. Then oddly there's a pillow that's much cleaner than the others... She moves it - *a key* - oh! **The** key. Endelyn was looking for it. We don't know what it's for, though.

Oswen shows the others and asks Bel if he wants to incorporate any of our new expensive props into the performance - but for now we'll just put them away.

We head back to talk to Hurley to see how he's doing. Surprisingly, he's more chipper. People are talking to him. A few other performers are in better spirits too. **It worked!** "Give me my lines!" he insists. Bel does his best. We all have to check on Bel's notes. Kindle helps Bel be persuasive in getting help - (ADV) 25! - we get people to help whip up costumes very quickly and even have some agreement for side props. **But it's on *us* to go and find a particular goblin that we're told - "he's the worst! He's the worst of us!" - the nickname is *Stagefright*. A goblin boss. He's their production/stage manager and reports directly to Endelyn. He must agree to what we're planning to do. We're told that in between performances he's usually upstairs, talking to Endelyn in her audience chamber.

So this is it - we have to convince them both. Oswen's small stature and physical charm, such as it is, means she can be surprisingly deceptive and she can certainly help Bel talk up the performance and importance of Endelyn's role.

Without further ado - upstairs we go. We follow the route we know, up the spiral stairs to the Orrery. We now know that a corridor down to one corner leads to a balcony on the side of the building where the storm balloon is moored. Oswen is curious about the doors to the balconies that overlook the stage, because the corridors going that way seem too short. She asks the others to wait as she's short enough to easily duck beneath the swinging orrery arms. She's surprised to go through a door at the end and, rather than being on the balcony, is in a kind of spying room - it's behind a *one way* mirror, the big ones we saw. Everything people do and say in those theatre boxes can be seen by people behind. If they were brought up the external stairs we already used ourselves, they'd never know.

Oswen realises that likewise the corridor to the balloon balcony has a doorway that, since the door is it's orthogonal to the corridor, implies another room. She investigates and, yes, there's soe kind of guest room. The external door is open, blowing in the wind; the balloon is visible beyond; the two little darklings Trinket and Bauble are sat here. "Excuse me? Don't you know how to knock?" She apologises. They'd come because she'd requested the spool of thread (of disappointment) but we destroyed that, and killed Charm, so they're mostly here to tell her that Charm failed to get it. "A change of management!" they declare. "We no longer accept useless baubles and trinkets" (ha!) so Oswen says, "Oh, interesting! What form of payment do you prefer?" "We now deal with hard currency!"

Oswen agrees to fetch the others and meet them in the shop.

There are darkvision goggles - Oswen could certainly use those. 250gp. They also have a drift globe, when asked about lighting options - the perfect "sun" for our performance. Much easier than the hand-carried lantern. 150gp. Persuasion on the total is only 15 - no discount! - but they'll exchange for items of equal value. Oswen says, "I've just the thing!" - glasses for goggles. In addition, they like Skylla's rings, so that covers it. Seeing the ball mask when Oswen's fetching the glasses, and knowing she's a wizard, they offer gem dust and inks too - 100gp worth - which Oswen gladly accepts.

The goggles are quite decorative and even have small cat ears on them!

In the hallway, Oswen elects to transcribe the L3 Slow spell scroll. If Endelyn tries to run, she can use the scroll knowing that she has the spell safely in her spell book now.

OK! Enough time wasted! We head over across, past the orrery again and get to what we think is Endelyn's "guest" room. And as we get close we can, indeed, hear two voices; one scratchy, hoarse and dry that sounds somehow *dusty* and another, more squeaky and nasal. It mentions "mistress", so that's the goblin. "...but that's the thing with performances, mistress; we cannot expect people to come to see the same things again and again" - at this Oswen quickly knocks, opens the door and says, "And *that* is something we can help you with!"

Stagefright is shocked, "you can't come in here!" he is saying but Bel produces the invitations. "Yes we can!" (he's very well dressed, with dapper suit, top hat and monacle).

Endelyn walks down from a throne of sorts. As she walks it sounds like 1000 insects all moving together... Which, disturbingly, it might well be. She's tall - 9ft - up close, the skirt looking mechanical, perhaps responsible for the noise; and she has an extra pair of arms! Four arms in total. The extra pair hold puppet strings on sticks, and then we realise that *these* move things under the skirt. **She is her own puppeteer!**

She pulls aside a moth-eaten wedding veil away from her face. It's gaunt, skeletal; almost pitch-black eyes with little pinpricks of light in the middle. She hisses at us... "Yes. Yes I've been waiting for you! You've been *meddling* in my kingdom. But that is fine... I see you have seen my sisters to a sticky end! Well, this is where it all changes. This is the end of the road for you!"

Oswen and Bel exchange glances. Bel bows deeply, saying, "We know when we've met our match - we've seen more than enough in this kingdom for that!" - and talks about the play we have in mind. ADV deception only 19. She is wary. She lets Stagefright check Bel's play. She says, "If you fail to please me, there's a price to be paid; I will have your shadows!" - she pulls out from the giant skirt some large, tailor-style scissors, magical; she snips theatrically in the air. "Do we have a deal?"

"That depends on what pleases her. It must be emotional! It must make me feel something... A tragedy. I love tragedies. Is there something horrible that happens? Absolutely dastardly?"

Oswen says, "We agree that it must make you feel something. If you feel nothing after our performance, you can have our shadows."

Stagefright and Bel - referred to as "the director" - is to be taken to his "crew" to get everything ready. "I expect a full house tonight! Send out messages! Everyone must attend!" she instructs. She asks about the name, and Bel looks surprised - he hadn't thought of one - so Oswen says, "The Ballad Of Light And Shadow". Not quite a tragedy in title, but obtuse and, in its own way, true.

She points at Oswen. "I have something to show *you*. Come with me!" - Oswen figures, Orrery. She asks Inafina to go with Bel while Kindle and Oswen follow Endelyn. Orvil is perched on Oswen's shoulder the whole time. In her head, Oswen says to Orvil, "Just remember, whatever she shows, it's going to seem really convincing, but it's a lie. It'll be a lie wrapped in truth to make it seem more plausible."

We go up the spiral stairs again and end up on a balcony looking down onto the orrery. "Give me your hand" she says. Oswen reluctantly takes it. She walks Oswen to a specific part of the balcony and produces a large box from under her skirt - which she invites Oswen to stand upon so she can see over the edge! Heh. "Whatever you do, *don't let go*" she says, her face very close to Oswen, dusty strange breath. She looks to the orrery and raises a skeletal hand; fingers seem to almost fold in on themselves; the spinning rate increases and lightning crackles violently.

Oswen feels herself being *drawn* into a vision. Disorientation; a whirlwind pull; she grips Endelyn's bony hand, unpleasant though that is!

Then, suddenly, she still feels Endelyn's hand - but all around her - somewhere else.

It's as if she is watching something from high above. A farm; a farmhouse, almost a manor. Two children play, halflings; boy and girl. Catch first; then hide and seek. In and out of the house, then between hand and near a shed; but then a hand darts out of the shed and grabs hold of the boy. "Stop running around here! It's not safe by the toolshed." "Sorry papa!" - a human steps out in overalls. It looks like an older Leonidas. And this farm - oh. Not just any farm. It's a vineyard! The girl catches up with the boy and tackles him by the legs, as they laugh and tussle on the ground. "Where's your mother?" asks the man. "She's putting the clothes out!" "Let's go and surprise her..." says Leonidas.

The sneak between sheets behind the house. Feet and lower half of a halfling woman near the last set. She's using a pole to hang the sheets. The children pounce! There's rough and tumble and complaints about getting the clean sheet dirty.

The woman appears from beneath the sheets. An unrecognised halfling - not Oswen. 

The scene shift. A doorway; an arch made of orchids; it shimmers as she feels compelled to step through. She does; into a woods; walks a long path, popping out next to a vineyard. A handsome middle-aged man tends vines. He looks startled - "You seem lost miss! Are you alright?" - she realises it's interactive - "Yes, I'm lost. Where is this place?" "You seem disorientated. Please! Please come in. We'll give you some milk and food. Have a rest" - she's taken past beautiful vines with ripening fruit; late in the season it seems; she gets to the house she saw before. Inside, an old man is sat in a rocking chair, reading a book. He looks up; their eyes meet; surprise and happiness. It's Leonidas, old; he recognises her as she recognises him. "No... Can't be..." he says. "Oswen?!" The other woman's voice calls, "Who - what's going on down there?" and before Oswen can speak the whirlwind starts again.

She's back in the orrery room.

Endelyn without looking down says, "That is your future. I can change that for you. I can change it all." She turns to look at Oswen who's looking up, with a single tear, but simply says, "You make more mistakes than you know. And I would change nothing fro the happiness he has." Endelyn tries to convince Oswen, but Oswen's hand is in her pouch, clutching the wish stones. Endelyn releases Oswen's hand and finishes, "Consider it. My offer will only last until midnight."

Endelyn turns and heads towards the stairs and points down. "I look forward to being wowed at tonight's performance!" and Oswen says, "I assure you, you'll definitely feel things." "My part had better be good!" - and storms off.

Oswen looks to Kindle. "Let's find the others."

"Are you alright? What happened?!"

Oswen explains. Kindle surmises that Endelyn was trying to tap into jealousy. But for a bevvy of reasons, Oswen was not tempted. Sad for herself a little if the vision is true, but for Leonidas - he has everything he ever wanted.

We return to the workroom.

* Various rolls
* History to remember lines, performance for the - well, performances
* Two each

No guidance; just flat. A short rest equivalent happens during a staff dinner (Oswen re-casts Mage Armour for more hours on that protection, then recovers her L1 slots; Kindle recovers his strength too).

* Oswen: History - 6, 19, performance - 19, 2
* Inafina: History - 2, 4, performance - 20, 11 (Bel gives her fewer lines!)
* Kindle: History - 1, 18, performance - 13, 17
* Bel: History - 15, 18, performance - 12, 19

Ouch. Not a slam-dunk by any means. But we're out of time. We have to get on stage. We take positions. Endelyn is on L2, by her ornithopter; she'll swoop down dramatically when the time is right.

"A Ballad of Light And Shadow" is about to begin!

Stagefright is MC. "Ladies And Germs! Welcome to Motherhorn! We have a special performance for you tonight from *newly arrived guests* - the debug performance of Bel Bottom!" Bel steps forward and bows. "This is a ballad of light and shadow!" - general booing. Seems normal, Stagefright isn't bothered!

"Our tale begins on a quiet and gloomy autumn night!"

Lines are delivered. Per rolls, mostly the lines are off but the performance is good, sometimes the other way around. Occasionally there's a slam-dunk. We're all in costumes sort of, with Oswen wearing her faerie wings just-in-case, as if it were part.

The story is building slowly. At the mid-way point there's a large musical number - this is the Korred dance. Kindle, ADV performance: **nat 20**. Nails it completely. Deception checks to try and keep attention away from the huge rope now moving up onto the lightning rod atop the tower. Bel 27, Oswen 13, Inafina - oh dear, nat 1 + 3, but Bel's managed to do well enough to offset and hide the fact that Inafina almost pointed at the rope to say "it's working!" and barely catches herself. Bel has a goblin pull a well-timed backdrop just in front of Inafina.

The ropes are tied. Oswen signals to Orvil to fly in front of the cyclops when Oswen lights the drift globe.

Tragedy starts. People rising to power... Endelyn's part commences. The beleaguered "heroes" of the story are beaten down by Endelyn's might. She drops out of the sky on the ornithopter, lands on the ground, cutting down heroes with her witty insults and "painful truths". Gasps from the crowd.

Now it's Endelyn's number! She actually sings! We all dance, to back it up. This keeps Endelyn's attention focused on the crowd. During this, Oswen blows the whistle to get Gleam and Glister on their way, then lights the drift globe. **The game is truly afoot now**.

Downstairs, the goblins fake an issue that's meant to deceive Stagefright as a distraction. He's ambushed and tied up! (D20 rolls, just scraping it). Gleam and Glister run up to get onto the stage. On the raised circular side stage, the drift globe is joined by Gleam, while Glister moves to its edge and positions her shadow over Endelyn.

There's then a groan and *thunderous* crash at the cyclops (D20 - easy win) topples the lightning rod. Most lights go out, but a few on stage remain on.

Endelyn calls, "What is the meaning of this?!" and Oswen points tot he raised stage and says shouting, "**Look! The heroes are saved by an eclipse!**"

"What?! Betrayal! To arms!" cries Endelyn. "CRUSH THEM!"

Initiative:

* Inafina 18
* Oswen 14
* Bel 8
* Kindle 5

Other cast members scatter to the edges of the stage. There's a roar from around as the Korreds stampede in and suddenly, Brigganocks are swarming! Sleep is being cast on many people - Endelyn's helpers are mostly occupied. But two darklings emerge from the rapidly-fleeing audience.

Inafina's fewer speaking parts mean she's quicker off the draw. She throws radiant bolts at Endelyn. Miss, hit for 9 radiant damage; no vulnerabilities; Ki point; miss; a crit, but somehow that's only 8 damage total. She wants to engage with the staff instead. She runs up and gets behind Endelyn, but that means she's now attacked by a darkling coming in from the stage and she's flanked. Hit; 5 piercing + 7 necrotic damage. **And now it's Endelyn's turn.** She casts Polymorph at Inafina - "Little rabbit. What if you were just a toad?!" WIS save is 15 - just scrapes it, luckily. "I'm not a toad!"

Oswen tries Scorching Ray but only one hits and only does 6 fire damage. She moves sideways to get a better luck but this brings her into range of the other darkling who hits her with a dagger. 12 damage total.

Bel shouts, "It's all theatre! THE SHOW MUST GO ON!" and - seeing lots of missed attacks - casts Faerie Fire on Endelyn. She fails the DEX save badly - she's lit up - "Spotlight on our main actress!" shouts Bel, and throws bardic inspiration to Oswen.

Kindle casts Spiritual Weapon. The strange spectral ladle appears. He commands it to attack Endelyn. Then, thanks to Faerie Fire, he tries to get in some hits with his mace, realising he has the upper hand. He hits for 8 damage, then his spiritual weapon gets a hit for 9 damage more.

Inafina just piles in on Endelyn, ignorign the darkling. She hits with her staff, full charge, 13+13 damage; then hits again, 16+10 more damage; Endelyn calls to the darklings, "TAKE OUT THE TWINS!" (who are dancing in their eclipse position); Ki point; hits again, 7+12; Oswen sees some kind of plane shifty spell being cast, but Inafina has one more hit; crit, no more charges left; 16 damage.

Just as the two twins twirl into the perfect eclipse position and the shadow falls onto Endelyn, the last hit from the staff smashes across the puppet strings right out of her hands and the whole contraption crumbles and falls apart. Endelyn collapses down into a bag of bones - which turns to dust!

The darklings run! They disappear into shadows.

Oswen runs forward. The previous spell that was being cast has fizzled. The dust has been blown around by wind and the flurry of battle. All that's left is her theatre contraption... There are various things to investigate... Bel could help...

...but meanwhile, as we're distracted, the Korreds are capturing more darklings. The goblins are running amok, "She's gone! The witch is dead!" and the Brigganocks swarm onto the stage. It's chaos around us, only non-electrical light remaining, a shadow on us from the drift globe eclipse and there's all this noise, but we don't hear it, we're just staring down almost in disbelief.

Oswen asks... "'Fina... What - what *was* that - how did you *do* that? That was extraordinary!"

Inafina laughs and shrugs - "Honestly, I'm not sure - this staff did a lot of the work. It seems it can channel lightning, even without those lightning rods."

Bel helps Oswen search. Investigation ADV dirty 20.

* A small charm, that calls the ornithopter.
* The scissors of shadow snipping.
* A key on a keychain. (Plus the key we found).

The scissors go in the portable hole. Oswen wants to destroy them, but isn't sure how. The ornithopter might be useful for us but she can't really see how in reality; it doesn't look like it could carry more than one person; it is quite large and would be a noisy and obvious thing to have fly around with us; 

She also thinks about Binky - now a mask - and Vig. Maybe in the morning she could start trying to cast Remove Curse spells on masks in the mask room... She doesn't know how many it'll take or how many we can do, but we can certainly try.

We gradually become aware of the commotion around us. Oswen asks a goblin if Vig can be found anywhere. We congratulate various excited Korreds and Brigganocks, for their help in keeping the numerous other "bad guys" off our backs while we battled on stage.

Oswen kicks the broken contraption a bit and looks at Kindle, with a slightly far-away look in her eyes. "I was tempted. Part of me was tempted, of course it was. But I knew that wasn't good, and I knew it was better for Leonidas to have his happiness. So, I guess, as long as I can still tell good from bad, maybe it's OK to have bad thoughts sometimes. I'm certainly not sad that *she* is gone."

We need to find whatever other secrets this place holds. The drift globe is brought with us. It's dark inside. And what of the key - the one we found, and the on Endelyn had. So we start up the tower. The orrery is stationary, dead. On the viewing gallery we now notice a book - being written - Endelyn was writing her own predictions down. It's a string of ranting prophecies! They include Oswen's future. We find a future for Skylla, the one where she believed she'd be betrayed by her "own kind" - the thing that had fed Skylla's paranoia.

On the way up, Bel heals Inafina, L1 Healing Word, 9; 30 of 33; she thanks him then insists Oswen should be healed too but Kindle does that directly via Cure Wounds, for 11 points. 28 of 29.

It'll be interesting to see if the sun rises in the morning. Maybe we should rest here, up in the tower, to get a view if it does. There are unchecked rooms here - the ornithopter balcony room first; a few things for maintenance and repair, nothing else. The other balcony - a cage, with three construct paper birds. Bottles filled with crackling lightning line the wall. Bottled lightning?! A wooden desk holds a stack of parchment, fluttering under a stone paperweight shaped like a large toad. Three folded paper birds in the rusted cage flit about like moths. So that means there are already letters on those birds... We want to catch them.

This is going to be a sleight of hand thing. None of us can help him with this, though Kindle adds his Guidance. Inafina opens the cage; but Bel misses! Kindle and Oswen too; Inafina manages to catch it. The cage is snapped shut. Over time, we use a better-prepared dance with us lined up to each try and catch a bird as it is released. Three messages, then.

* "My darling Bav. Scab had the horn but either lost it or forgot where she hid it" [...] "I have an agent who has retrieved it for me. Your favourite sister, End."

* "Dearest Scab. Mummy's little warlock spy was happy to betray her companions and reveal that the others are conspiring to betray us! Their plots will not succeed; even now, an outside force promises to rid us of the whole stinking lot. What's important is that the cauldron remains safe."
 
* "Lord Kelek. I've written a new play, The Agonies Of Alagarthas, inspired by real-life misfortune. I trust you will enjoy! Nou and the other members of the League are invited to Mother horn to watch a life performance. You missing colleague has ben a guest of mine for some time, but I'm afraid she has worn out her welcome. In exchange for my generosity, you can take her off my hands."

We wonder what the date for *that* was.

We could write messages on those pieces of parchment. They're paper birds (Oswen arcana 22), but they're kind of wild. They'd fly away given the chance. We can't take them with us - only the stone paperweight really keeps them here. Packing them in a bag would be almost impossible.

So Oswen gets help to hold down a paper bird and writes,

"Lord Kelek. You do not know me, but I know *of* you. There is a plot against you by Endelyn. An outside force comes to attack you. I am sorry report that Skylla is already dead. Be on your guard." - she does not sign it. Kindle asks why she did that? "Maybe they'll fight each other; maybe one will destroy the other. If there's something powerful enough to take out the League, then I'd rather we didn't fight it - that the League, forewarned, did that for us. But if *does* take them out, then there's no difference from me not having sent this message."

Bel says, "But what if she means it's *us*?"

Inafina says, "Either way, we make them paranoid, and we can legitimately claim without deception to have been the ones to warn them should we find ourselves in a position where we gain the upper hand by lulling them into a false sense of security."

Oswen then writes one more. "Dearest Will, Endelyn has fallen, but much is still amiss at the Palace. We do not know if the mists will fall, but should you care to come, this domain is now as safe - or dangerous - as Hither and Yon now. The Jabberwock is still at large."

Inafina suggests we tell Tsu and the others in the Inn At The End Of The Road too, so we do. One last one. Oswen writes:

"Noble centaur Winterbow - all three hags are defeated. Perhaps the mists will fall and, if you still yet live,  you rejoin your love. If not, we proceed next to the Palace. Take heart. This domain may well yet be restored."

Bel says "Agdon! Tell Agdon!"

Oswen has to think hard about that one. "Lightning Agdon; the three hags are defeated, but many problems remain in this domain. If you are considering putting your nimble fingers to better use than petty thievery, perhaps you might choose to meet us at the Palace."

That is, in fact, the last sheet. The other three we tear up - their messages are irrelevant now.

This just leaves one room. Double doors at the back of the observation room. Locked. We try each of the keys. The one from Endelyn's keyring works. Oswen Arcana 24; as she holds the key she detects a magic ward being suppressed as a result of approaching with the key. She sees a glyph, subtle, above the door. No handles, again. She recognises the glyph now - surprisingly, Bigby's Hand! If approaching the door without the spell key, you'd be shoved off the balcony to fall onto the orrery below.

A strange shaped, large room. Kind of domed at the far end. And it's really, really creepy here... WIS save for fear! Oswen WIS save only 9. Inafina 8. Bel 16. Kindle nat 1. We're all freaked out except Bel who doesn't really know why we fell that way...

...because the entire room is filled with marionettes, dangling from the ceiling on puppet strings. At least 100 of them. And if that weren't enough, as we walk in they start screaming! "Intruders! Intruders!" and they seem to want to escape their own strings, thrashing about.

At this, the not-frightened Bel casts Dispel Magic on the underlying Alarm spell. The room goes quiet.

At the back of the room is large, glass-doored wardrobe with a jade eye above its door, which is ajar. It seems Endelyn normally sleeps in it! There's a very-familiar looking mirror in an oval wooden frame. Another doorway. Hurley could use it... Gleam and Glister too... But we don't know the magic word. Around on the walls are at least one hundred, unique, ornate hourglasses, ranging from 3" tall to at least 3 foot. Placed oddly some distance into the room is a large wicker basket, which looks like it might belong to a cat. Three stuffed birds and three tiny wind-up clockwork birds are strewn around it. Cat toys? It doesn't seem to have been used in a while.

A large chest catches our eye - it has a sturdy, complicated locking mechanism. Oswen says, "I need ten minutes!" and casts Detect Magic.

* Every hourglass contains slightly magical sand; school is transmutation; she also notices that when the sand finishes flowing, the hourglass rotates automatically.
* The cat basket is not magical. The birds *are* but only mildly, with animating magic.
* There's abjuration (protection) magic on the treasure chest and conjuration on the mirror.

Oswen Arcana 30 on that chest to figure out the nature of the protection. If anything tries to open the chest without the key it'll teleport. We have to risk the assumption that the key we found opens the chest. She tries it. She holds it in the lock... The abjuration magic is suppressed. She breathes a sigh of relief and turns the key. It unlocks. She senses magic inside; she opens it.

Two items stand out immediately.

* A wooden unicorn horn.
* A shrivelled hand of an elf clutching rolled-up sheets of parchment; the magic is around the ring on its finger.
* 8 bottles of exquisite elven wine.

Oswen only notices the hand and wine later. She reaches in, trembling, to get horn and then just sits down heavily, staring at it. Bel asks, "What have you got there?" She shows him. "This is - this is *it* - the horn!" "What do we do with it?" "Well, we're supposed to use it to damage or break the spell in the palace? But first and foremost - we should give it back to Elidon."

It's very, very precious. Kindle to Oswen's surprise opens the portable hole and pulls out the rocking horse. Oswen says, "I'd forgotten about that. It can't be that simple, can it?"

She pauses, thinks about it, then sees if the horn will fit. It does surprisingly have a screw thread! So she screws the magical horn in place.

CON saves all round:

* Oswen 15
* Inafina 14
* Bel nat 20 + mod
* Kindle 9

There's a *BRIGHT* flash of light. Oswen just glances away; Bel was ready for it, it seems, and already looking away; Inafina is momentarily blinded, along with Kindle.

As the flash subsides - there stands, without doubt, Elidon. And _she_ speaks telepathically.

There is an expression of extreme gratitude for the rescue. She asks who we are.

Oswen is crying, but crying with joy. To her party she says, "I don't know about you but I think this is the best thing I've ever done. Elidon, I'm sorry, I'm a little overcome... My name is Oswen Hafflethwaite and these are..." - and introduces the party.

Elidon was tricked and captured. Locked in that strange shape. Frightening. She explains...

* She was led to believe that Lamorna was in trouble
* This ruse led to a dropping of guard and then the polymorph to this form was achieved
* Her horn was stolen and used to cast terrible magic

"Time has been stopped. They've done something."

"We know. That is where we must go next; we know of a way into the palace. Zybilna's cauldron was used and could be destroyed, but then if Zybilna is brought back, she'd be much less powerful for a while at least. Or, apparently, there is some magic within you or your horn which can undo the spell."

"That is indeed true. I can help. If you bring me there, I can undo the magic."

"We can bring you, but it would be terribly unsafe..."

"I have to help. I have to do something! You have freed me. I owe you my assistance and my life! I have magic that can help."

Oswen nods and says, "And we gladly accept but must not rush in. None of us are useful if captured or killed."

"I ask only one thing - that you let me head to Wayward Pool to see Lamorna before this dangerous thing commences."

Oswen laughs, "Oh, this I'd assumed already! Lamorna misses you terribly."

Fortunately, Elidon says she knows a way through the mists. She nuzzles Oswen's hand. "I can get there. And I will find you, now that we are connected. Stand back..." and - as we find ourselves also healed fully in a burst of magic - there is a swirl of light and Elidon teleports away.

After some investigation, our best guess is that the hourglasses are basically for decoration. The magical animating sand is for show. But they have value; they're all unique and different. Oswen takes one from the wall and - Detect Magic still up - sees it become non-magical. We find 100 small enough to take, worth we guess 25gp each or at least tradable for other goods. That's a *lot*.

As for the chest, it contains...

* 8 bottles of exquisite wine, which Bel is sure are worth 100gp each! Bel is beside himself with excitement.
* We try to gently and as respectfully as we can fish out the parchment to read it. "The Agonies Of Alagarthas - A Three Act Tragedy By Endelyn Moongrave". We stow that!
* The ring; a dark blackish metal with sapphires and amethysts that seem to have an inner light if examined closely. She looks closer. She can see stars moving, one gem to another, as if windows... This is a **ring of shooting stars**.

### 1875 XP - LEVEL 6

(When we've done a long rest - Oswen learns Light Of The Moon and, having burned the scroll without learning the spell, Remove Curse so that she can take that alongside Kindle and we can tackle the masks. Bel learns Major Image.)

Throughout the night, Endelyn's books are all burned. Very Farenheit 451. People are generally destroying the place; we certainly won't stop them. The orrery is ripped out and smashed apart by the Brigganocks - and not entirely because of anger. The Chief Engineer believes the stolen Wish Stones to be within its structure, helping to power its visions and, remarkably, that is exactly what is recovered. Whether good or bad, they can be taken back into the care of the underground Brigganock nation.

The library room is turned back into a grand hall. Prop chairs and tables are used and a banquet is held! They've found barrels of wine, we share the rest of the mead; the cyclops has joined us to whom we convey our sincerest thanks. The mood changes dramatically; dancing in the amphitheatre, everyone coming together. Clouds dissipate; a clear night, with moon visible and the massive book bonfire.

Some goblins and darkling elders were captured but not killed and are "escorted off the premises". The mannequins off the top floor are burned along with many other of her belongings, but the mask room is left alone at our request. A memorial is held for old friends no longer with us. Kindle finds he has *two* L3 abilities left and he tries Remove Curse. He manages to restore two masks, but we learn that it really does require individual castings per mask. Binky is free! We say they must keep the others safe; we'll come back to take however many days it takes to restore them or enlist Zybilna's help - if we can.

Much dancing, dining and drinking.

Oswen wants to sleep on the top floor balcony, hoping to see the sunrise - if there is one.



## DAY 14

It happens. We're awakened on the balcony by the light streaming off the top of snowcapped mountains to the east - the first sunrise here in more than a *year*. We see people down below also wakened, gathering on parapets and battlements, equally amazed at the spectacle.

"Best sunrise I've ever seen", says Oswen.

Amidor joins us up there. Oswen offers him the flying machine - he can see the world as Pollenella sees it. He gratefully accepts.

A goblin meets us. "We heard you wanted to get to the palace? We know how to get there!"

They point up to the ceiling at the area above the paper bird cage. There's a hatch! "What do we do?" "If you can open the hatch, there's a bell up there - a hidden belfry" (ah, so *that's* where it is!) "so if you ring that bell, you'll get there. Whenever you're ready, ring that."

We say our goodbyes; there's no time like the present. Inafina "wind walks" up and rings the bell.

"What now?!"

Someone points towards the sunrise... Three giant *cranes*, white, beautiful, are flying towards Motherhorn. One by one, they land by the balcony. We are able to climb board. Bel goes with Oswen as they make the lightest pair. Kindle and Inafina get one each.

There's a lot of waving and shouting of goodbye. Amidor gets the ornithopter; "I will accompany you to the edge!" - we look back to Motherhorn, the sun shining on it; it looks so different; a beautiful silvery-blue colour. Suddenly, much less menacing.

We fly Eastwards over the mists, towards the sunrise. In the distance we see, rising up, spires of lilac, purple and pink; the palace, in the centre of the midst.

**The Palace Of Hearts Desire awaits us. Maybe we can do this. Maybe we can really, truly do this!**
