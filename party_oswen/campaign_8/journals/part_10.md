# Oswen: Part 1.10
## Day 14, not long after sunrise in Yon
### Flying above the mists towards the Palace Of Heart's Desire

As they fly, Oswen's mind races - the beauty of the landscape below is remarkable in this early morning light, seen for the first time in sun, but even so...

* There's the small matter of the Jabberwock! We know very little about it.
* Presumed-good, frozen wizard Ringlerun holds a staff that the League leader Kelek badly wants.
* The unicorn horn can unfreeze *one* person if we held it separately; Kelek wanted to use it, but now it's back where it belongs - on Elidon's head! Elidon has the magic to break the curse but...
* ...Kelek's bodyguard wields a Flametongue Sword, which could destroy Zyblina's cauldron and break the whole spell - if we needed to. Last resort.
* While we rescued Elkhorn in Thither, what about the other presumed-good other party members besides Ringlerun?

...but all this assumes we get into the palace in the first place...

* A magical ward prohibits entry unless by invitation and we expect this to still be active.
* Endelyn's notes mentioned a group being dispatched to "take care of" the League, of whom it seems she had grown tired. We wonder if that was *us*, via Endelyn's twisted machinations. Perhaps we are already invited?!

Oswen's mind is brought back to the here-and-now by a bright flash as they get closer to the castle and sunlight bounces off shining roof tiles on circular towers, apparently bouncing the light around so that the sun ahead of us ends up being reflected away from us, but then bounced in our direction again; a quirk of our course and momentary position. With her attention drawn to it, the towers of lilac, purple and pink look even more picturesque. This is a true fairytale castle, in just about every sense.

Strange, in some ways, that this was created by a daughter of Baba Yaga, the mythical Iggwilv, AKA Tasha, AKA Zybilna. Baba Yaga is an extraordinarily powerful hag and one would *assume* her supposed-favourite daughter would have similar preferences and alignments to her other three two children. Yet this does not seem to be the case *at all*.

Oswen finds herself unsettled. The beauty is undeniable, but within lies terrible danger and, at the heart of everything, beyond the mists and the magic and the creatures, is an apparent contradiction. Zyblina may well be "on our side". But she's a being of unknown motivations, great power, and great intelligence. If we manage to wake her, we must tread very, very carefully in what we then say or do.

Amidor has been flying alongside, on the ornithopter. He can't go into the palace. "The best of luck to you!" he shouts; "And thank you!" before peeling away, back towards Yon.

From up above, we can all see paths connecting different areas together, above the mists. We start to realise we could navigate from this, if we remember the things we've seen - so Oswen quickly gets some paper and her magic quill and starts sketching little bits of it, where the connecting paths are with written landmark notes, just enough to jog the memory.

Bel and Oswen try talking to their crane; ADV animal handling 16; they get something of a rapport going. It helps that we give it some food! Inafina and Kindle see what we're doing and follow the lead to avoid any inter-crane jealousy... They really like the dried berries from the rations.

It's a long flight but the last moments seem to happen quickly as we get close. The palace gleams in the sun, rising up, connected to a remnant of the Queen's Causeway towards Hither. It looks like there was a spur to Yon, too, but that's not connected anymore; it seems more damaged. The sky is changing to twilight, rather than a sunrise; small wispy clouds, but nothing moves. The sun has *just* set, a few rays shining out, also not moving. It seems that the *whole place* is frozen in time.

A beautiful walled garden, the walls rising some 20ft, with ornate gate with animal carvings in gold spreads out in front of the palace, around 200ft wide or so. It's not overgrown but isn't manicured. It has a wildness to it - a fey garden. Two small round towers, 30ft tall, rise on the left and right along battlements on the wall; but they're strange - open-topped - crammed inside with trees, some of which sprout above the wall edges, like giant plant pots! The palace beyond is raised up above that on a terrace around 10ft tall with a 15ft surrounding wall above that. The walls rise above. In the centre is a particularly huge tower surrounded by seven spires; but to the right (East), there's another large tower but it seems broken, disconnected from the main palace, with what looks almost like explosive damage - and a huge beanstalk grows out of this ruined side of the palace and that's holding the rest of the tower aloft. In essence, it floats separately. Parts of the beanstalk show up all over the place, including around the edges of the walled garden.

The three cranes complete a circle that gives us a good view of the palace overall. On its Western side, there's a hole in a wall as if something crashed inwards. We can see inside. Eventually, circle complete, the cranes descend to a large pond in the garden and land. We alight on the South-Eastern bank, near a small footbridge that crosses a stream winding a roughly South to North course, feeding water into the pond.

There are soft lights in the palace windows. The stream exits the pond on the East, roughly East-West course, with an ornate fountain. There are birds singing a twilight chorus. Orvil joins in!

Just as we dismount, the cranes shudder! The birds shriek and scatter, as if badly startled; and from the forest below the garden, surrounding the palace, **arises the Jabberwock**. It bursts forth, even more birds scattering; it flies up, clawing at one of the beanstalk vines to give it more lift as it gets airborne. It is a pale green colour, sinewy and kind of skinny, with a bulbous face; it pushes up, rises in a huge loop, circles the palace then disappears inside through the hole we saw on the West side. There are distant stomping sounds, then things go quiet.

The birds don't start singing for a moment and in this quiet, Oswen realises there's music, some kind of band and some chatter. She looks over and sees a pavilion of some kind near the entrance gate.

"That's the most obvious thing" says Oswen out loud; "Let's go there!"

On the way to the pavilion tent we pass 12 moss-covered standing stones in a circle. On the inner faces they sport arcane sigils. Lush vegetation around, including bramble roses climbing but inside the circle it's flat lawn. Without going inside, Oswen examines the sigils as best she can; Arcana 24; she's read about something like this before... These are the kinds of sigils that combine into a teleportation circle sequence. This is a permanent circle. **She asks the others to wait for a moment while she writes the sequence down**.

At the pavilion there's an obvious entrance with a flap pinned back. Inside is a happy-sounding string quartet comprised of dapper-looking badgers, playing chamber music but with a jaunty, swinging style; lots of chatter from the others here. People are all sat around a picnic table laden with food! It's very "high tea". Multi-layer cake stands and so-on. Some people stand out!

* A headless dwarf, gesticulating
* A large fluffy brown bear
* (A couple of elves, some humans)
* Inafina perception dirty 20; she notices a halfling and a really large orc, wearing a Chieftan outfit with ornate headdress; but they are neither moving nor talking. They seem frozen.

The bear turns to see us. "Oh! Oh my. Look everyone... There's - there's new people!"

The headless dwarf jumps up and ambles over to us, waving. A very polite male elf stands and bows; he wears a headdress of dear antlers and wears a flowing green robe tied with a golden belt that has an acorn-shaped claps. "I wonder if you are the last guests we've been waiting for? Someone get the invitation! Tell me what names are on there..."

The dwarf heads to *one* empty seat. He picks up an envelope from the table setting. The elf looks. "Os-wen. Is one of you Os-wen?"

Oswen looks nervous but raises her hand.

"Well a faerie dropped this off for you! I don't know why."

The envelope is handed to her. She opens it. In Common is written in beautiful cursive - "Many thanks. May fortune smile on you. Yours, Sir Talavar" - and there's a beautiful chime. **A chime of opening.**

Oswen shows the others. It's from an old friend!

The female elf comes over. She has an investigator's hat pulled down at an angle, film noir style. She has a collared shirt and smart knee-length trench coat. It's tied with a cloth belt. High boots and a briefcase complete the look. "So it was for you!" she says. Sitting on her shoulder we see an animated quill. "My name is **Majera**. This is **Dictado!**" - the quill. "So you're Oswen!" she says, just as the quill starts writing on a piece of paper stuck to her shoulder. It's keeping a note of what people say. Best be careful...

The bear comes over. "My name is **Bodger**! Would you like to join us? There seem to be four of you..." - he yells for more chairs. Three more *walk over* themselves and add to the one place setting. A dinner bell goes. "Ah! Cakes!" say people, all excited.

The trays of food, decanters and teapots sparkle with faerie dust and suddenly everything is renewed magically.

Given Sir Talavar's note, we trust this and join them.

We sit next to a human farmer, who grabs hold of a huge pumpkin that started to lunge towards us as we sit down - "Bad!" he says. The pumpkin cowers. The farmer picks up some pieces of cured salmon and throws them under the chair; the pumpkin devours them with sharp teeth! "That's an unusual companion" says Oswen. "Oh my, not my companion; it's - this is why I came. It's my prize pumpkin but it turned into this and started to eat my livestock! It's ruinous... My family sent me away to find a solution. 'Either solve it or destroy that pumpkin' they said! But I'm so attached to it; I even won a price for it at the spring festival in Yartar."

Oswen Arcana nat 1, so re-roll, nat 20! -> 30. It has been Awakened via an awakening spell. And it's quite bad-natured! The farmer's name is **Sumai** and he says that he'd heard you could come to this palace; he refers to it as **Lavoglia**. "The legends say Lavoglia is where you come to have your heart's desire fulfilled by the Faerie Godmother who lives here. Most of us have come waiting for our wishes to be fulfilled, but we're just waiting for our turn to be invited in to petition and present our case!"

Oswen is sympathetic but does not reveal that the palace is frozen in time - these people don't seem to know.

The male elf on closer inspection doesn't have pale skin - it's marble. He moved slowly and formally but that's because he can't move fast; in his case, after we enquire, we learn that there are issues with old bloodlines and sorcerer's blood; intermarried (!); "...let's just say I went down into the family crypt to - pay my respects - and I might have accidentally cut myself and caused a wild magic explosion... And for some reason this happened..."

He requires the use of a Wish spell. He asks if Oswen has one... But it's far, far beyond her abilities (and she's often wondered, if she had the ability to use it, if she'd ever actually take the huge risk it carries upon casting).

The dwarf, of course, wants their head back. The bear is asking for help with a river spirit that's done something to him - "you see, I love fish! But look what happens if I try and eat fish now..." - he reaches for the smoked salmon but as it gets close to the bear's mouth, the fish just flies out of his hand across the room and sticks to the inside of the canvass! "I can't eat it! This river spirit... Very cruel... But a kind druid cast a spell so I could talk to the Faerie Godmother."

Oswen ponders that one... Arcana 27. This one's easier. It's a good old fashioned curse. She says, "Well, I have to tell everyone here, some of you - many of you - seem to have issues that are far beyond my small abilities. But for the fish - I think I can solve that; did you want to wait for the Faerie Godmother, or could I try?" "There's no harm in trying..." - so Oswen casts L3 Remove Curse.

A strange aura appears around the bear's mouth, but then it melts into water; brackish; it splashes down onto the ground and, as it does, little dustpans and rags self-animate and clean it all up. Oswen suggests the bear try for the salmon again - and it is able to eat it. But now it eats it *all*, then hugs her. Oswen suggests that maybe the bear moves his fish take around the river and perhaps eat less - but the bear has had a lot of time eating other food while cursed, so thinks he can "diversify his diet". Oswen sympathises - as the bear eats a cupcake, which she has a bit of a weakness for too! She joins him.

The bear realises he might as well depart, but asks what he might be able to do to help us... As he does this he's emptying food into a travel bag. He sits and thinks. Head tilts one way. Then another. Then back. Then, "I know! I found this! I think this might be helpful. I got it from a very scared wood cutter that ran away from me when I wanted to ask him how to get here..." - he pulls out an axe. "This is a strange one. I keep it in my bag because trees and plants don't seem to like it much. They cower away from it. But you can have it!" - and he hands it to Oswen, so will pass it onto Kindle later. It's magically very good at cutting things down - and should it transpire that the beanstalk is a problem, it might help us solve it.

The bear waves goodbye, heading off - grabbing another cupcake on the way out.

"I wonder if anyone should've told him that the cupcakes go bad if you take them out of the tent?!" says the investigator elf. Oh no! That's sad. But another person says that the bear will probably eat them long before that happens.

Since there seems to be a general lack of awareness of the time freeze here, we ask what's going on with the two frozen people. The elven investigator is singled out as the first person here before everyone else. She explains that she arrived and found two frozen people who didn't seem to want to talk - or move! - she thought it strange. The quartet badgers were very friendly and said people have to wait for invitation to enter the palace - "one of her guises" would turn up - "**the maiden, the mother or the crone**". We ask how long she's been waiting; but at this, she looks confused; brow furrowed; asks others. They know their relative order of arrival, but can't figure out time. Someone says 7 days, another says 10 months (!) and so-on. But those are all wrong given the order of arrival.

And the badgers have played non-stop throughout!

Eventually we make our excuses to leave, to have a look around the garden. Just as we do, the bell rings again and everything is refilled. People leave. A debate starts about which goes first - cream or jam on the scones...

We look around with new eyes, realising just how amiss things must be here - even apart from the things that were immediately obvious. Flower beds have butterflies but they are frozen in mid-air. As we wander around, we see that there is even water around dragonflies and pixies who seemed to be having a play-fight also frozen. Forest gnome gardeners around the flower beds were watering plants and the water there, too, is frozen. One leans off a ladder to try and trim a bush. The ladder looks like it might tip.

Oswen tries something. She moves her hand through some of the watering can water. As she touches it, it falls to the ground. So now she very gently tries to get her hand underneath a butterfly. She tries to lift it - but it won't budge. She asks Kindle if he can at least move the ladder so it's no longer falling! With Inafina's help that works; but the gnome doesn't move; it ends up upright on a safer ladder.

So we can't move anything living; they're like mountains, immobile. But inanimate objects become unfrozen if we interact with them. The water from the watering can flows out as much as it can, then stops; the water can can't move, perhaps because it's being held by the gnome and moving the can would require the gnome's fingers to move too, but they're frozen.

Several very beautiful, ancient trees are in the garden with two different types that fruit - ones with golden fruit and ones with silver. Bel theorises that the fruit might be magic, so Oswen spends time to get Detect Magic up. There's a lot of magic around everywhere but the fruit in particular is very magical. Golden - divination magic; silver - abjuration magic. Sight and protection. Arcana 19; well, it's hard to tell. But the effects seem beneficial, but the magic is connected to the tree and it seems that removing one would lose its power quite quickly. One seems to cancel the other.

Hoping that one of the collected hourglasses would be fair exchange for fruit, Oswen tries a gold fruit. She feels more wise, and that might last for a day (ADV on WIS save). Inafina tries a silver fruit. She feels more healthy straight away! (10 temp HP). OK, so now we understand; Bel and Kindle get to choose. Kindle figures health and goes silver. Bel goes gold.

We set four of the nicer hourglasses aside as hoped-for acceptable exchange in future.

Oswen asks Orvil to fly close to those two towers and see if there looks to be ground-level access to either of them. He finds that the left / Westward tower has a wrought-iron gate up a few steps. The right / Eastward tower's only access is up off the walkway (but we have a Rope Of Climbing and could get up there). Orvil reports writing in Sylvan above each door - different in each case. The left, Oswen translates as "**Envy**". On the right, "**Wrath**".

The left one has a marble pedestal in the middle, surrounded by all the large trees - which are all oaks - with a moving iron statue of a lion flicking its tale. The right one seems to be hawthorns, with another statue, this time of an iron hart, majestic, huge antlers. It paws at the ground aggressively when Orvil is in sight.

Oswen history 22. She doesn't remember any stories about these in particular. The fey can embody powerful emotions, so perhaps that's what these are.

Orvil also notices a beautiful rose garden, but it's covered in cobwebs. Orvil also notes something interesting - dragonflies around the pond where the cranes landed are *not* frozen.

This is very odd, so we investigate that immediately - we ask the cranes. They say the dragonflies were already there when they arrived; but they weren't frozen. They also point out the water is very odd and invite us to walk on it - it's like dough! We can walk around on it, as long as we keep moving; else we start to slowly sink. We can sculpt water at the surface level with our hands but if we lift it clear of the lake it turns back into "normal" water and flows away. A school of shimmering black fish seem to be in position, "vibrating", in the middle of the lake. We look closer. It's a bit tricky as we have to keep pacing, except Inafina whose boots let her hold position. The fish are *displacing* from left to right, as if oscillating between two positions, teleporting a very short distance. She reaches down to try and get one - DEX save needed, only 12 but a low DC; movement that isn't hers; she withdraws her hand quickly. The school of fish coalesce into the lower body of a woman; the water above, with the fish in, seems to form a hand that reaches up. Then from the body of the lake, moving through this figure, arises a crown made of silver needles. It tries to hand that to Inafina.

Inafina is lawful and is being offered a crown. This seems risky! But Oswen already has a crown... Inafina insight 22, the spirit does not seem malicious, urges her to take the crown, but it's starting to slip. Inafina grabs it. She can't hold it for long, though, because of the needles. At most she could hold for a minute else it'd be too painful.

A singsong voice in her head speaks in elvish... It's gentle, female; "**The beginning of wherever; the end of ever after; the start of an age; the finale of every moment; the first in history.**" There is a relieved, yet cautiously hopeful feel to the message. Then the figure is immediately transformed back to a school of fish, trapped in water.

The crown is still a crown. Bel quickly casts Mage Hand as Inafina repeats the message. "What can it mean?" she asks. We move to the bank. The crown itself looks like it's probably not that magical, but is being held into some kind of state and wants to change, but certain conditions must be in place for that to happen. Oswen tries it - she puts the crown on, just for a moment; uncomfortable and nothing happens.

Bel and Kindle debate it, so Kindle ADV insight 24, but all they can figure out is that this is something to be solved. The crown has no intent per se. As for the riddle, we just can't figure it out. We lack the skills to decipher it.

The crown is carefully put away in the portable hole.

Let's talk to Envy! We make our way to the tower and get inside. It's a beautiful grove of mature oak trees. Just lit by the last rays of light - timeless, thought hey are - is the proud iron lion. It roars at us and then says, "We demand you grace us with obeisance; kneel!" (Shrug) Sure! We comply. As we do, the lion steps down off its pedestal and sits next to us. "What are you doing here?" "Investigating! We were curious. We're new here." "What are you investigating?" "The freezing of time." "Interesting! Is it frozen outside?" "Yes, but strangely, not here." "I hadn't noticed. We know that Zyblina is not here." "She is frozen in time herself." "That's odd! We're only supposed to appear when she's not here... Wrath - that hateful stag! - and I are two sides of the same coin. He's awful! Terrible, terrible, terrible... The worst kind really. But we are forbidden from harming him, just as he is forbidden from harming us. We were created by Zybilna to protect the garden from intruders. If we're here, it usually means she is away, so it's odd that you think she's frozen." "Well, perhaps being frozen in time is magically the same as being away - she can't look after the garden herself, after all."

Oswen ADV (due to monarch crown) persuasion only 4,9 + 0 -> 9. The lion asks about the crown and she explains the Witchlight Carnival as best she can. The lion explains he wears a crown sometimes, to gain access to parts of the palace. We ask what it looks like - golden roses or silver needles. When *he* wears it, the crown is of golden roses. We say that we found the silver needle version. "To transform the crown of needles into its gold form, place it on the brow of either us or our hated enemies!"

He doesn't know which one - if we get it wrong, the crown is teleported away. One of us can turn the crown into gold, but the lion can't remember which one. It must be gold roses to unlock doors. Some doors are unlocked by the lion key, others by the hart key.

There must be some clue about which is which but we lack it.

The lion returns to his pedestal and we bid farewell. We figure that if the lion doesn't remember, the hart won't either. Perhaps it's the riddle? The lion said that envy "just wants what is due" - regal stuff. Nothing to do with beginnings or ends. Well, we might as well talk to the hart to see what it says. We have the rope of climbing so assuming magical wards don't stop us climbing we should be able to get to the door.

In practice - we can get up. The walkway has doors either end, one to the palace and one to the tower. While we think the Chime Of Opening might do the trick, that feels like breaking in! So we continue as planned and go into the hawthorn grove.

This one is darker, the light not making its way in. The hart is in the shadows. It thunders over to us and rears up above us! "Kneel! Kneel before wrath!" - and of course we comply. It paces around us in circles a few times. Then, "You may rise! Wrath tolerates you!" "We are honoured." "Why are you here?" and we copy our conversation. As for the crown, the hart also doesn't know which is which, nor do the mentions of beginning or endings mean much to it. "Wrath simply is and always will be!"

We notice lots of empty baskets around the pedestal. Tributes? "I love berries! People have brought me baskets of berries before when they want the crown from my head. Wrath will unlock doors in the palace when Zybilna is not here."

Much scratching of heads. As before we leave; the other door into the palace has no markings above it. We head to the rose garden but examine the fountain along the way. It's got an unusual 'scene' - relief carvings of many animals hanging out and playing chess! The chess board is not carved in any detail though. The three-tier fountain is all frozen in place, but would flow out over the fountain sides and down into the stream.

At the rose garden, we see beautiful roses in five colours, some in full bloom; but it's overgrown with large cobwebs. In the middle is a statue of a satyr mid-dance, playing the pan flute. Oswen nature on the cobwebs, only 12, possibly made by **Ettercaps**, creatures that farm giant spiders. They're placed up to catch prey - insects or larger things! It would be dangerous in there for sure.

Orvil has a fly around and gets close to the statue, but it doesn't move at all. It might be a frozen person or just a statue. Orvil sees two Ettercaps, but they're frozen in time. Emboldened, we venture inside to investigate and get a closer look at the statue. But we have weapons drawn, just in case.

The statue is on a carved-from-stone pedestal in the centre of the rose garden. No writing. Oswen takes a close look at the Ettercaps; they seem to be hiding, as if waiting to ambush potential prey.

As they're leaving, Oswen stops. "Five!" she says. "Five sentences. Wrath. Five letters. Can't be a coincidence... But... Oh, goodness." She almost looks disappointed having thought there must be something deep hidden in the riddle, except she conceeds, "The clever thing is that it all only works when translated to Common - W, R, A, T, H - the beggining of *w*herever, the end of after afte*r*, and so-on."

And so we return to Wrath in his den and present the crown. "A crown for me?" - he lowers his head; with Mage Hand the crown is carefully placed on him. In a flash of light, the thorns turn into golden roses. "A beautiful crown! Rightfully ours. You may now pass through the doors guarded by the stag without needing your names written in the Black Book."

The closest door is on this very battlement, so we try it - and it opens!

This looks like a servant's quarters. Five goblins are here, frozen in time; there are beds and other bits of furnishings. One of the five is dusting a row of bells attached to strings; those will be to 'summon' servants and perhaps we could follow strings? Oswen investigation 23. There's a dresser with one of its drawers open just a tiny sliver; something moves - a shadow? Like at Motherhorn? It's hiding behind the dresser. Oswen tries saying, "Don't be scared - we've spoken to shadows before, it's OK!" - but it doesn't respond. Bel has a go. Persuasion only 13. It doesn't budge. It stays *very* still.

Bel looks to Oswen and winks, then loudly says, "Well I guess there's nothing here!" "Yes we should go!" - ADV deception 19. We hide! Stealth:

* Oswen 22
* Bel 18
* Kindle 11 (he's an 8ft tall Bugbear in a Goblin-scale room)
* Inafina 8 (she hides behind a bed but her ears are very visible)

There's movement; something slides out from behind the dresser. It's not a shadow; it's colourful. Then it changes from 2D to 3D... It's a butler! Thin, unusual, quite scary! Almost elven, cat-like face; butler dress. And clearly, able to flatten itself. It looks around. Sees the ears. Sees the bugbear. Crosses its arms. "I can see you!" Oswen calls out, "Well, we had to try something! We just want to talk. Can we come out?" "Why should I talk to you? What have you got for me?"

Oswen tries to persuade with something quite big - a bottle of the expensive elven wine. That's enough. We explain that we're trying to solve the time problem. "I'm **Thinnings**. The Butler. I noticed this disaster - this catastrophe! - when I came out of the library, where I was running an errand. I heard a loud bang and came out to investigate, and everything was frozen! So I hid and I watched. You know - her sisters - the hags! They did this! They planned it all along!"

We explain our part. He's seen the League; three are here - Kelek the leader, Warduke the mercenary and Zargash - plotting against Kelek, he says. The two of them are never in the same place!

* The cauldron is **in the Ballroom** where the frozen Zybilna also is
* Everyone there is fully frozen, along with one of Valour's Call (but the "one with the staff" is in the Study)
* Their paladin leader Strongheart - "things aren't going to end well for him! He was caught in a blast in the tower and is hanging above the spinning void!"
* Valour's Call was hot on the heels of the League
* The League - he's not sure where two of them are, five initially - we know about Skylla, but not the fourth
* Kelek tends to hang out in the throne room, with three cockatrices the he has
* They wander around free, so their names must be "written in the book" (which is in the main middle tower, directly beneath the treasure room) - he can't get there, he's not allowed inside
* We learn that the centre of the palace has a void in it; the middle tower and the spires are held up by buttresses over the void - he doesn't know where it goes - it is called the **Court of Storms**
* He thinks the explosion happened in the study, around the second floor of the middle tower; it was caused by magic that blew out the side of the tower, throwing the paladin out through the hole and now he hangs over the void
* The Jabberwock was adopted by Zybilna but the relationship is tense; she feeds it, basically bribing it to patrol the domain - she feeds it with things from the cauldron and the magical brew that she makes; the Jabberwork curls up around it, even though the cauldron no longer works. Used to sleep there when younger.
* It has the run of the place and is afraid of nothing... *Except* Zybilna's *other* pet, the two don't get along... **Bloodybeak** her unusually giant owl. It's in a cage and, also, frozen.
* The library is in a pocket dimension, much larger than it looks on the outside; this is how come he was spared the freezing spell
* **Igrik** - one of Zybilna's other pets - a small kind of demonic imp - broke into the mistress's laboratory and stole one of her brews, then poured it on a beanstalk, which grew to the size we see. The tower we saw separated, was ripped up by the beanstalk. The explosion that caught he paladin was not responsible for the damage; that was the beanstalk and Igrik hides here
* If you know the real name of the creature and touch a unicorn's horn to it, you can unfreeze an individual.
* The palace has lots of people, there are usually about 60 people who live here; the librarian is not frozen, others probably are. Of the library **Shon** he say - "She won't talk to you! She has no reason to." - she sounds quite strict.
* One more warning... There is an intruder! They go between the kitchen and the banquet hall; it must have climbed the column of rock that the whole domain sits atop and got in through the hole in the wall that the Jabberwock made! He hasn't spoken to them, but "it's eating everything!" - it's about 23ft tall, hideous, grey and lumpen, and obese; a Fomorian probably.

One set of doors leads to a balcony overlooking the void and towers. Impressive. No access. The northern door leads to a room curving around, with three giant rats roasted and trussed up on a food trolley! The room is dominated somewhat by a beanstalk "arm" coiled around a three-tiered cake, with three pixies wearing chef's hats and chef's whites flying around it with icing piping bags, finishing this construction - it's some 6ft tall. They're all frozen too.

She cautiously pokes the beanstalk. It doesn't move. It's very thick - some 3ft or so. Even with that special axe, it would take a while just to get through this little bit. We walk around it to get a look through a smashed-in door to where the tower was, but instead now stands the beanstalk base (though it's smashed down through the floor too); the main stalk must be some 8ft in diameter. We push in through the door, to see the rock here destroyed and the pushed-up tower above. It looks climbable... But 80ft or so high, the floor of the tower is pushed way up high, above even the top of the palace!

We discuss climbing or flying or whatever. Then Bel says, "Unless we want to chop the beanstalk down?!" But that'd destroy the tower, surely? Well, Inafina can fly up, so can Oswen for a bit, and could Feather Fall anyone. So Kindle gets the axe - the beanstalk recoils a bit! - it's a little troubling. But this is a magical monstrosity, unnatural, probably causing more trouble than anything else so we go for it. Kindle starts his attack. The first axe blow lands solidly and, surprisingly, it makes the beanstalk shrink; some 10ft drop. "Oh that's good!" says Oswen; "It's bringing it down smoothly!" - Kindle swings again but the beanstalk dodges! (Nat 1). The tower rocks. He has another go. Another hit. The long tendril around the cake withdraws inwards. The diameter is shrinking too. Another! Same effect... And so we go on, slowly but surely.

The beanstalk ends up being little more than a trellis work supporting the tower - just - which is only a few feet above the walls now. Then it gives way and, with a loud thud, the tower drops down; it's askew, but mostly in place. Now we can reach it easily; we jump up to reach what's left of a bottom spiral stone staircase and get onto the tower floor proper. It's a complete mess here! Broken furniture, holes in the masonry, dead beanstalk vines around; amidst the ruins is a *toad wearing a tiny wizard's cape* perched on the lid of a treasure chest that's slid across the room and ended up surrounded by junk.

"What? Are *you* responsible for this?!" it calls out.

Oswen says "Are you Igrik?"

"Yes! I'm Igrik."

"Hi, well, we thought you might be stuck up there and the beanstalk was doing a lot of damage."

"I was *hiding* up here you idiots! I'm hiding from the League Of Malevolence. You've doomed us all!" Now it shape shifts into a bat and flies up to the ceiling, then hangs. "Explain why you've destroyed my moat!"

So we explain; the brief version, and we'll be tackling the League in due course. He asks, "What's your plan anyway?" - Inafina wonders if this is trustworthy; 17 insight; this wizard/bat/imp is telling the truth and concerned and on Zybilna's side. But it's an evil creature - a shape-changing demon. It seems to be assessing us just as we are assessing it.

We answer, "To gain as much information as possible about weaknesses or strengths of enemies and allies, get any help we can and release the freezing spell. We have a unicorn friend who says they can achieve that."

"Hmmm. I see... You would still need to deal with the jabberwork!"

"The jabberwork won't let you get near the cauldron. You'll need **Snickersnack**!"

Oswen says, "Thank you, that's good to know - who is Snickersnack?"

"Who? It is a *what*! An ornate sword that Zybilna commissioned some treasure hunters to find as a sort of precaution, just in case the Jabberwock ever turned against her. It's the only thing in this place that could possibly slay it. It's in the treasure room."

"Oh! But - we thought maybe to persuade it, rather than slay it."

"Even Zybilna in all her power could not control it."

"What about Bloodybeak?"

"Bloodybeak *scares* it, but that's all. And that owl is crazy! Besides, it's stuck in time. It's confined to the aviary but it hates the Jabberwock... I'll tell you a secret if you promise me you'll free Zybilna."

Oswen says, "We will do everything we can - we're trying our best - that's the best I can truthfully promise."

He sighs. "Very well. The windows in the aviary can only be opened with a password: **Canzus** - you also need a password to open the doors to the treasure room, but I'm not telling you *that*. You'll have to figure that out for yourselves!"

We can't persuade him (19) on that, but he tells us one more secret. "**There is a stone - a beautiful stone - that is in the Marble Hall, where the glass statues are.** That stone is cursed. It is very powerful; it is something that Zybilna treasures; but she does not control it. She has figured out how to use it without being cursed herself - **you need to hold a black rose when you touch it**, in order to avoid the curse."

"How strange. Thank you... What does it do, though?!"

"It is a Stone of Power" is all he says. Oswen's not heard of that.

He also warns us that a harpsichord in the room, if playing, makes the statues dance - and they'll cut you, because they're made of glass.

"One last thing. Be prepared for a fight! There is an **invisible Slaad** that has snuck into that room! Another one of Zybilna's little pets."

When asked if it wants anything in return for all this information, Igrik says "Innocence! It is my favourite food" - we don't have that... He shrugs. "It's quite rare these days!" - then turns into a hawk and flies away.

We return to the cake room. The are two doors on the northern wall; Oswen chooses the right and walks in.

Oops. A huge dining room; heavily decorated, majestic; a giant balcony on the western side of the chamber hangs above the room; there is a very long large table all down the middle; and sat at the end is the Fomorian. A grease-stained tablecloth is tucked under its chin and it devours a huge amount of food laid out on the table; it gulps a barrel of beer like we might a tankard. A tea tray has a tureen of steaming soup. Who made that!? Maybe it made that itself.

"Hey! You!" it calls. "Your boss promised me cake. Where's the cake?" - oddly, it speaks Sylvan not Giant, so Oswen understands.

Oswen goes, "Um, Just in here... I'll fetch it!"

"You'd better or I'll see if *you* taste as sweet as you look!"

Oswen returns to the room and we briefly discuss options. The cake could be moved but it'd be very difficult and we'd only be doing that as a distraction prelude to attack. And some damage might not matter - the giant doesn't seem to care if it looks good... Over-complicated. Someone would need to get the cake to the Fomorian, and that means they'd be right up close! We abandon the cake plan.

"Looks like just another fight then!" says Oswen, "but it's huge, it really is big, we'll have to be very careful and try to keep out of its reach. Which must be quite significant."

Inafina is looking around as we do this. This is in fact a pantry - and it looks like almost *all* the food has gone. And the Fomorian couldn't fit in here, and someone made soup maybe, so someone has been feeding it. And that makes sense, because unless it maybe climbed in through the hole, maybe it was invited by someone who wanted it here. A member of the League would be the leading candidate, but why would they want it here? It did say, "your leader".

Oswen asks Bel to come back in to the dining hall. We tell the giant that the cake is almost ready but ask who promised it would be ready *now* - "that ridiculous sorcerer, with the bodyguard! He promised me an 8ft tall cake with icing as white as snow and decorations as red as blood. I want my cake now!"

Oswen makes a show of looking into the room then back. Then she says, "I think he might've broken the deal - the cake is barely 6ft tall, and doesn't have icing nearly as exciting as you describe. It doesn't seem fit for a Fomorian of your stature!" but this convinces the **Fomorian to start wandering the palace to get its own food and eat whatever it wants**! That backfired. Oswen calls back into the other room, "OK, I think we have to do it now!" because the Fomorian starts pounding a hole through a wall and given the void not far away, doing that kind of damage seems like a bad idea!

(We might be doing Kelek a favour here, since it seems he basically bribed the Fomorian to keep out of the way - and perhaps that's why it spoke Sylvan; maybe Kelek doesn't speak Giant). Initiative:

* Bel 24
* Inafina 21
* Kindle 20
* Oswen 13

All Bel can think of is Dissonant Whispers. It's too big for Hold Person! The spell takes effect, dealing 8 psychic damage but it reacts by freaking out and running into a corner. Bel then grants Bardic Inspiration to Oswen, the other two not yet having made it into the room...

...and on cue, Inafina bursts in, a big rabbit hop onto the table, then runs forward to get close enough for her radiant burst - just makes it in range - shoots two bolts. She gets two hits bit low damage; 5 and 7. Now Kindle runs in too, gets as far forward as he can as if to try and shield us (as is his way!) and calls Spiritual Weapon to attack. He gets a hit, for 9 radiant damage and since the Fomorian hasn't acted yet and is surprised, he gets 7 extra damage too. Then he brings down his Twilight Sanctuary, and gains d6+6 (increased due to level) -> 7 temp HP, but he already had 10 from the fruit earlier.

The Fomorian recovers from his earlier fear, turns, roars in anger - "I knew it! I knew you would betray me! Can't trust little people at all... That's why you must all die!" - and gazes with an evil eye at Bel who is just in range, angry at Bel's spell oh him. "I curse you to be as deformed as your heart is, you evil creature!" - the eye bulges grotesquely. CHA save. **Nat 1** - oh no! - but he has earlier Inspiration; **Nat 20** - same as Oswen earlier, the strange flip from 1 to 20. A resounding success against the spell. The Fomorian runs close to Inafina - even though he has 15ft reach! - and swings his great club. It hits decisively, dealing **19 damage** - though remarkably, she holds her place on the table rather than being knocked across the room. It was more of downward blow.

Inafina shouts, "Ouch!"

Oswen throws L2 Scorching Ray, all three hitting (the third thanks only to Bardic Inspiration); 21 damage in total. It smoulder from the fire damage. d6+6 -> 11 temp HP.

Bel now tries Slow, to hamper the creature - but it resists the effects! "Drat!" He gives Bardic Inspiration to Oswen again. d6+6 -> 7 temp HP.

Inafina is up close whether she wants it or not so attacks with the staff. With lightning added, 18 damage. Next likewise, 9 damage; Ki point as a stunning strike; but it is not stunned. She gets one more attack with the staff, hitting for 13 more damage including lightning. Better yet, 11 temp HP from Kindle's spell.

Kindle's up. He commands his ladle - "You want food? Try this!" - hits, but only 6 damage; but now, bravely, he runs in close too, giving it a second target from which to choose; and he has been holding it since the beanstalk - he swings the axe. Hits, but sadly minimum damage of only 4.

The Fomorian, enraged, tries the Evil Eye on Inafina. CHA save, but it's a hard fail. A horrifying **27 damage** psychic damage, but she manages to dodge an attack that follows with the club. Oswen's terribly worried and throws the most powerful Chromatic Orb she can, hits, 5d8 is only 20 but Bardic Inspiration is used to add another d8 and that's a full 8, so 28 total. It's looking shaky.

Bel takes a deep breath, jumps over the table, runs around the back of the Fomorian to flank - casting Healing Word to Inafina on the way, 10hp back - and attacks with his scimitar. Hits, 10 damage. Inafina now swings; she hits with the staff; she's up on the table, almost eye to eye, reeling from the previous damage; she thinks hard and calls out - "And now the tables are turned!" - 10 damage, right in the eye, and the Fomorian falls!

(Everyone groans).

Inafina gets 8 temp HP from the remaining spell; Bel gets 9. He suggests we rest up in the room - we're happy to comply! After all, there's food here. No need for rations today!

### 1400 XP

Kindle harnesses divine power to get his L2 spell back (before resting). Bel then uses his Song Of Rest, which helps Inafina heal. Oswen recovers a L3 spell with Arcane Recovery. Bel's a bit sad, because his Slow spell didn't work - but all of us reassure him that his earlier spell was a great success and besides, he was very brave to run in with his scimitar. There's a dining terrace outside, so we hang out there to get food. It is in fact a stunning view in the twilight. White tablecloths, wicker chairs. As we sit, the teacart rolls *itself* out onto the terrace, and various cups, saucers, bowls and so-on all fly out to arrange themselves. The soup and so-on are all renewed, so now we know where all that comes from! It speaks, introduces itself as our waiter and gets everything going.

Anyone eating gets 10 temp HP, which helps out Inafina and Bel a little.

It turns out it is is quite chatty and called **Demitasse**. We're all happy to chat back. We learn that those she helps are immortalised as the glass statues which dance in the hall. But a "nasty nasty bearded man" now rules - presumably Kelek - who has been feeding the Fomorian all of the palace's food, since it arrived 3 days ago. There's no food left except stuff hidden in the tea tray!

At least everyone else is frozen and not in need of food right now...

**We ask about the librarian. Apparently there's a little rhyme they like: "Slip underneath the doorway, then fold and disappear..." - we note it down and learn it.** That might get them talking!

Towards the end of our rest, suddenly a shimmer appears in the mist in front of us - and forming there is Elidon!

"Having a very civilised afternoon tea, I see! Is there any for me?"

Demitasse is surprised but recovers and offers food. We point back into the dining hall and say, "Unfortunately, while the afternoon tea is civilised, the events before were less so!" - and we bring her up to speed. Elidon can help with freeing individuals and can help with the cauldron itself - "...but I'm *not* going anywhere near that Jabberwock!" she says.

In due course we head back in. We'll continue to explore this (very large) floor for now. There are some unexplored options behind us but large double doors at the North end of the dining hall, mirroring the ones we came in through, catch the eye. It leads to a corridor with various doors coming off it. There's a fork along the way with another corridor leading off. We continue to the end of the corridor we're in where there is a door at the end (West), one North and one going back South, which happens to have a relief carving (cameo) of a stag with antlers. That's interesting, so Inafina listens at the door. Perception 21. No sound at all. She opens it cautiously. As she does so, the stag head above it glows for a moment; Oswen Arcana 28 (!), abjuration, powerful, a protective aura - but the stag's glowing is related to its deactivation. She notices that the magic on it would normally create an impassable barrier, yet it opens for us. Of course - this is one of the doors that will be open to us because of Wrath. If we'd ended up with Envy, then doors marked with a lion would probably open.

In the room, there are rows and rows of square compartments with bundles of paper scrolls. There's a writing desk and a very old dwarf, several centuries old, sits with a quill dipped half way in the ink pot. Its nose is wrinkled, as if about to sneeze. It is writing on a sheet of parchment, which says:

"Dear Rotten Ethel, you have requested access to ancient rituals handed down by Baba Yaga herself, which can be used for bargains; I regret to inform you that Iggwilv is unwilling to share" - and so-on. It talks about Ethel's *coven* needing to do more work to earn favour. There is mention of that coven's dark dealings with "**mort...**" - and that's as as far as it goes.

We don't know this dwarf's name so Elidon can't unfreeze them.

With Bel's help, he and Oswen examine scrolls. Investigation 23. Bel shows her a scroll. She can't read it; in fact none of us, even Elidon can. She spends a while ritual-casting Comprehend Languages... ...No wonder we had no idea - this is in Infernal! It contains contracts made with mortals. Things signed by demons; contracts with them. Some of these are very sensitive - Warlock pacts. Oswen can't help her curiosity and she looks for Prof Roslof (Madrick)'s pact. It takes a while - but it's here.

**He made a secret pact with Zybilna** - but not Iggwilv, and it's interesting by itself that we see this same person being referred to and even signing things with a different name - **she grants him the unpredictable enchanting powers of an Archfey, to help him understand the mysteries of the occult and the human - or rather, the *mortal* - condition. What drives them and motivates them. In return, he furthers *her* work by keeping an eye on the occult and demon worshippers and reporting anything that they get up to**.

So this means that Zybilna had an interest (hopefully for good reasons) about people doing what could be very bad things on our plane.

(We also note that "mort", partly written, is mostly likely "mortals").

Another investigation... 23... There are times when Zyblina agrees to lend a specific book and other times to refuse it, written in runic, infernal runes that translate to **Iggwilv's Demon Nomicon**. History 8, it's on the tip of her tongue but she can't remember... She asks Bel... He's heard it referred to, but never read it. It's certainly famous. He thinks it's a bad book - **a guide to the summoning, binding and control of demons**.

There are older contracts here, but with Zyblina at all, all in the dwarf's handwriting - so he's been here a *long* time. At least 300 years in some cases. Some even have a different way of numbering years and the language is different - **a different world** - signed *Iggwilv* or *The Witch Queen* (we've heard the latter quite recently). But these are more sinister... Payments not in gold, but in families! In citizenry, surrendering a fealty of kings in exchange for protection.

**Oswen drops a scroll in frustration. "But she's as bad as the other three!" Bel points out they're from a much earlier time. Did she have a change of heart? Or just got what she needed and moved on, but under the right circumstances, would still behave that way?**

Oswen is even *more* unsure that we're saving the right person here, but we still have to unfreeze everyone as there seem to be plenty of innocents. And the mists need clearing.

We leave. Oswen wants to check out that T-junction corridor as there was a window at the end, so maybe the door off that leads to the last room in the North-Eastern corner of this floor. It'd be good to get a sense of scale. We go in. 

Oh. *This* does not look good! Here is the *largest* owl any of us have ever seen in our lives, or even imagined. *We* are in cage, of sorts, protecting *us* from the bird in the rest of the room. The gaps are large; we could easily squeeze through but don't want to! The floor of the room is strewn with animal bones and giant rat carcasses. It takes a while to get a sense of scale of this huge bird - some 20ft tall, and maybe at least 10ft across at the widest. It is sat on the ground, preening itself.

There's a huge circular window at the far side of the room that has opening and closing mechanisms. If open, the bird could fly out. But it's frozen; and Elidon would not fit through the cage bars.

We're not sure if we should unfreeze this thing. Inafina risks going in and tries to find a way to make the opening mechanism on the door work, but she can't find anything. Oswen comes in to try and help. Then she asks, "Would this be considered an aviary?!" and Inafina goes - "Oh. I suppose so. What was it? Cansas?" and Oswen goes "No, Cansus I think" - and at that, the window springs open. It's a sheer drop of 100ft outside, so they step back a little to be safe. Wind blows in. Oswen asks Kindle if he could fetch the giant rats from the kitchen and we leave those as food for when the bird unfreezes. The question is now - do we do it right now or later? It might be fruitless, or it might provide a Jabberwock distraction.

By chance, the bird is up against the cage and Elidon's horn can reach without her having to get inside the room (the bar gaps being too small for her). She squeezes into the small caged space by the door. "It's a lot more scary up close!" - Elidon goes up and touches it with its horn; "Who knows its name?" Inafina says, "Bloodybeak I think, for real...!" - and a swirl of pink mist, at this, breaks an falls around Bloodybeak - the wings suddenly flap up and down as it's preening. Then it looks up, shocked at - from its perspective - our instant appearance!

Kindle pushes the giant rats through the bars and points at them. But even with Bel's help, his animal handling isn't great! 3,4+4 -> It eats the rats. Inafina says, "That's not how you deal with an owl!" and tries to calm it. Animal Handling 16. It responds to her. But how do we explain what happened... So Bel casts Speak With Animals. Then he tries to be persuasive (Kindle trying to help) and explain. The Jabberwock has taken over the castle; magic has taken over everything; we're trying to help Zybilna using the cauldron, but the Jabberwork has taken that hostage. "The Jabberwock is not allowed inside!" insists Bloodybeak. "I will chase it away!" - and flies out!

Distantly, soon after, we hear much flapping, crashing and other noises from within, which become distant; then noises outside and birds in the trees all around the castle scatter.

"Well done - that should take care of it for a while... I think we need to find Kelek next. But should keep an eye out for that guy in mid-air in case someone releases the curse before we're ready!" says Inafina.

Now we try the door opposite the one that led to that scroll room - the one on the northern corridor wall. This is a large space, some kind of state room, but it's a terrible mess. Rubble is strewn around. A huge, dragon-shaped creature has crashed through much of this, though this isn't the way we saw the Jabberwock come in though. There's destroyed furnishing, doors off hinges and so-on. There used to be a double-poster bed, tapestries, a writing desk and more - all destroyed.

Oswen looks around a corner, Southwards - and the view is astounding. Once, this was a ballroom. This was *the* ballroom.

Signs of a recent struggle, feathers and claw marks! **And there it is - the cauldron** on a dais in the middle. There are several frozen characters here, but two stand out, North of the cauldron; a middle-aged woman wearing a crown with white long hair reaching the ground, white robes, purple and blue detailing, golden hems. Unmistakable. We've seen enough pictures and heard enough stories.

**Zyblina**.

Next to her, a woman is clad in priest's armour and wearing a while cape. Zybilna is reaching as if in desperation towards the cauldron, with the start of magic emanating from her fingertips. The priest has a fine-looking quarterstaff, and looks to be trying to protect Zyblina.

There are courtiers here. A well-dressed Bullywog knight, two Drow sages, a goblin with dragonfly wings (we've seen these at the carnival) and four others, similarly adorned, around him. There are a few pixies hovering in the air too.

Oswen mirrors Bel. "DRAT! We've found it. We could free them all, right now! But we'd condemn a man to death if we did. We *have* to find Strongheart! And we need to do it quickly because I'm sure Kelek will be hear in a flash if he realises the Jabberwock is gone."

Oswen looks behind. Another big room is clearly visible with a big round table. And there is Ringlerun, with a spell book and staff, with a cone of ice emanating from it, frozen in the air. Even spells were frozen. He has the manner of someone ambushed and defending themselves. His staff is magnificent.

Oh! The staff. We can't let Kelek have it and if we unfreeze everyone without dealing with him, he might get it. It's risky if we free anyone as Kelek might get control of them BUT we have Elidon and that's the bigger risk anyway.

Oswen asks politely if Elidon could please free Ringlerun. We stand clear of the freeze cone!

Elidon's horn touches against Ringlerun's robe. Bel shouts, "Ringlerun!" - there's a huge frost cone that blasts outwards - but then he blusters, looks startled, "WHo are you?!" and turns against us. Oswen actually laughs and says, "We're on your side - look, we came with a unicorn! This is Elidon, and it is thanks to Elidon that you're free." Bel backs her up - persuasion 24.

We explain that he is still in danger. Kelek is here and wants his staff. And so-on.

After some more to-and-fro, he asks that **Mercion** be freed - the female priest. We do so. She's in the middle of casting Hold Person, but the person she was casting at isn't there. We explain then ask - *who* was at the cauldron?

*All three hags* had descended up on the cauldron. They touched it at the same time and cast a spell. Mercion heard them recite a poem that must be related to that: **"8 cats perched atop 8 dead attending. 8 lizards..." - and so-on. Lots of 8s**. Bel is writing furiously and has the poem written down in full soon enough. Mercion's memory seems very good!

We wonder if reciting this again would undo things?

People want to free Zybilna. Oswen just doesn't trust her enough. We must find Strongheart first - and perhaps deal with Kelek, too. He might try to destroy the cauldron, given Warduke's flametongue sword, while we are distracted. Too much of a risk.

We explore a bit and find the trail of destruction leading to some baths that are on the Western side, which is the "entrance" we originally saw the Jabberwock use. Difficult to find a way Southwards towards the Void, because of lots Lion-marked doors. Oswen tries the closest one that might lead to the central spire that *isn't* marked. There's a corridor; a stag's head door to the South catches the eye so she goes in there.

There's a beautiful room with glass cabinets filled with a wide variety of weapons! Armoury? Trophy room? Museum? No idea. They're just beautiful - as beautiful as weapons can be, anyway. Kindle in particular, as an-knight, is astonished. "These are some of the most beautifully crafted weapons I've ever seen!" he says - and the weapons answer! "Why thank you, but none of us are as beautiful as Snickersnack". The weapons invite us to try them out; we ask that surely we should need permission? "We are for the defence of the palace! Are you defending the palace?" "Yes" "Then I insist that I be used!"

Bel swaps his crossbow for one here, which is magical and will help with both aim and damage. Kindle likewise swaps his mace, and grabs a heavy crossbow. Oswen doesn't need much but then spots a dagger. We've needed those quite often! So she takes that - just in case. Inafina has the acquired Eldritch Staff, but does take the opportunity to get a magic spear too. We keep all our old things, carefully wrapped and stowed in the portable hole, on assumption of returning the weapons at the end.

The weapons do not know the password to the place where Snickersnack is hidden. No worries. Out we go.

Another stag door off the corridor; a changing room, for the baths!

We realise that some passages are too narrow for Elidon. In the end, Ringlerun and Mercion agree to stay with Zybilna and the cauldron, to protect them and Elidon. They'll wait. "Do not take too long - if anything happens, if I'm threatened with harm, I'll be forced to teleport away!"

We'd better hurry! There's a spiral stairway off the corridor but that looks like a minor tower. A diagonal narrow tall staircase leads off further South, to the South East. As we head towards that, we see windows set in this corridor that give another view over the void - the Court Of Storms. And for the first time, we get a good look at just the right place - rubble frozen mid-air, and there he is; **Strongheart, hovering**.

The diagonal stairway appears to go roughly in the right direction to get into the tower from which he fell, where we hope to maybe be able to attach the Rope Of Climbing. We end up in a small turret of sorts. We realise that we saw this from the outside - it's one of the 7 towers surrounding the central column. There are no windows, but in the middle is a chest or coffer on a wrought iron pedestal, enamelled with a rich emerald green colour. It's small and doesn't seem locked, so Oswen opens it, in case there's some method of conveyance out of the tower here. On a stain pillow there is a faintly glowing emerald crystal... Arcana check 27, well, yes it's somewhat magical, but it's not an artefact per se. It's an object of some magic power. She doesn't recognise though. Nothing ventured, nothing gained; she picks it up and concentrates on it; insight 2+1 - heh - no idea. She senses something. "Inafina - try this!" and hands it over. Inafina insight 13, but Guidance from Kindle bumps that to 16. The crystal is somehow familiar, as if she's sensed something like this before. It's - oh. It's a desire! It's someone *else's* desire though, focused around a few words and concepts, secret, stay hidden, don't be found, that kind of thing. "Do not let them know".

This is a bit of a mystery, but it does not in any way help us travel or move. We're in the wrong place; back down the stairs.

We get back to the ballroom and warn that we might have to do a fair bit more searching. We ask if anyone can get through a door to the South, which we know from the window leads to a balcony. They can't get through this lion-guarded door. We discuss options; the Chime Of Opening *does* open it, but Oswen figures it won't stay open and unlock for long. She's not sure how long!

We discuss some possible options but all are high risk. After a minute, the door re-locks. At least we know we can do that.

Warning that the others that we've more of a search than expected, we start to head South. Lion doors along the corridor we were in before; but at the Southern end, a door we can get through. The next room is narrow and has a long carpet. There's an alabaster pedestal with a vase of roses and cursive writing saying "take one". The rug is decorated as white roses amid a bed of thorns. At the other end is another vase. Two doors come off this.

Oswen does a instructed and takes a rose. The others do too. We check doors we can open; a balcony looking over the void is the only one. At the far end, the vase also asks for a rose to be taken; Oswen decides to return hers, as do the others. We go through the South end doors. A huge carriage room of some kind - but it's a glass carriage, two glass pegasus at the front, presumably flyable and very beautiful indeed. Astounding in fact! The only exit we can see to use is to the South, with everything to our West at this point closed off by Lion doors. So, we try the South doors and look through.

Erk. We're outside. We're on a raised terrace we've not seen before. Oswen holds the door open and asks Orvil to fly along the length of this terrace looking for doors back in. He returns promptly - very grand front doors, ornately carved, made of marble. Set into the top is a stag's head! That's a stroke of luck. We hurry over to that door and try to enter.

It's quite different from what she expected; not a North-South entrance way or similar, but an East-West hallway, beautiful, painted as if covered in floor-to-ceiling windows looking out over a starry sky full of constellations. Northward doors to our left and right are already open and look out over the Court. At the far ends of the corridor are doors to towers with those diagonal stair cases again. We're not too hopeful that they go anywhere but there are no stag or lion heads. We go West. There is a spiral staircase here, along with the diagonal stairs. It's odd though - perception 17 - this mirrors the spiral staircase we saw earlier and didn't go up, but this one has big windows that make it easier to see ten foot tall carvings of humanoids on the opposite walls, engaged in rituals, revelry and strange debauched activities *involving demons*.

Oswen is *very* curious about that, but tries to stay on plan and uses the diagonal stairwell to see if this has a different outcome than a turret room. It does; well, kind of. Another turret, but this time there's a narrow corridor exiting roughly North-West. Those just lead to another turret. We think we've only gone up 5ft the first time, then 5ft again. This definitely-closed-off turret has another iron pedestal with coffer atop, though; black, almost onyx. Inafina opens it - a beautiful black diamond-like crystal - insight 22; a sense of paranoia! This is a crystallised desire to know what enemies are plotting. Not *her* enemies; enemies of Iggwilv/Zyblina. People who she has used to gain the power that she has and are now after revenge.

Could she have isolated negative emotions and feelings somehow, into these gems? They do seem to be quite pure forms of those feelings. And might that explain - if we want to excuse it - the apparent change of behaviour in the way the scrolls ran?

Oswen remembers Chucklehead - sometimes losing parts of yourself can actually make you into something you prefer. That's a quite strange thing.

All very well well and good - but no way, apparently, to the centre tower. Back down, East, into that other door, it's all we've got for now!

A frustrating, similar experience; 10ft stairs, small tower, pedestal holding a coffer. Black enamel with translucent glowing crystal emitting white light. Inafina checks it again; insight 18. There is a familiar sense with this one - a distilled desire to show kindness to the unfortunate.

We go back downstairs. In lieu of anything else, Oswen now examines the wall murals and that spiral staircase directly up. Much the same thing as the "black crystal" tower in those - mortals and demons partaking in grotesque revels, but celebrated somehow. She asks Orvil to fly up the stairs! "Rude!" he says "But, also, fine; it's true I'm small, easy to overlook and I move quickly..." - off he goes. It's a long way - some 30ft of staircase - before reaching a floor with beautiful domed ceiling and double-doors with beautiful stained windows to a stone balcony overlooking the palace gardens.

Oswen runs up and opens the doors so Orvil can fly around, over parapets and around to see if he can spot any connections between parts of the castle visible externally, which we didn't see. He can see right down into the court of storms, and she gets a good feel for the towers, but no new connections are apparent. He offers to fly in through the destroyed wall near Strongheart and does so; a study, sealed, but for a circumferential stairwell that goes around the wide outer wall. So there is *some* way up here.

OK, well, there are two more of the small towers we can reach. The seventh, dead South near the main doors, we cannot figure out - it seems to have no entrance. The two left are near where we battled the fomorian. It takes a while. We get up and it's that 5ft, tower, 5ft more thing - and here, a rotting wooden coffer with a thrumming, red, glowing ruby. Inafina has trouble with this - insight 10 - an alien and awful feeling; she puts it down hastily; Kindle helps her; but it doesn't help (additional ADV roll is nat 2). Kindle gathers himself and takes a hold. A terrible expression clouds his face. Eventually he recovers and puts it down. "Nobody should ever touch that! It is imbued with a desire to punish terribly anyone who has ever disobeyed or defied her." It's vengeful. He gets a glimpse of the fury that was within Zyblina when she pinned Agdon to the tree when he refused to obey her.

So we've had:

* Green - to remain hidden from enemimes
* Black - a desire to know what enemies are plotting
* White - show kindness to the unfortuate
* Red - vengeance; a desire to punish perceived enemies

Nothing so far. No basement; Bel points out that the Voic seems to preclude that possibility. We try the spiral stair in the wider tower near where we are (North East). This one is interesting - up a long way, but then, a corridor going South. Lion Head door East - that'd go to the gallery area over the dining room that we saw. Carrying on South we see a branch Right that would head to the now-destroyed-by-beanstalk tower. South, an unmarked double door. In there - a short room; on the East wall, four 3x3ft oak panels with identical decorative designs on each. Oswen opens the first. A decapitated bugbear head - which speaks! "**Ya!**"; insight 11; no idea; close and open, it repeats itself. Open the next one. A strange bug-eyed scraggly-haired harpy head. "**Ba!**". Oswen figures, "Baba Yaga". So she tries the third. Hobgoblin. "**Ga!**". Fourth - a big ogre head, "**Ba!**". We're all in the room. Inafina now gains some insight - 19 - the magic might be tied to the hatches. The sounds is actually coming from the hatch not the head.

Oswen tries - two "Ba"s, so this is a guess - opening in the order: Harpy, Ogre, Bugbear, Hobgolin.

The world around us spins - and and just like that, we're in the central main study!

"Wait, what!?" says Oswen. That was wild.

Bookcases, scrolls; tables, many broken from the blast; it's a mess in here. Interestingly, it looks in part ransacked, not just destroyed. We look out over the void to Strongheart. A spell seems to have been cast towards him, throwing him out with the wall; he was surprised/ambushed, like the others.

Oswen, aided by Bel and with Guidance from Kindle, investigates the room - terrible rolls but Guidance is a 4 on the d4 which does help - 6+7+4 => gets to 17. Could be worse, sigh. Zyblina's study it seems. Not much personal info but lots of scraps of paper flung around. Someone digging around, trying to find something. Two scrolls are recognised in amongst the mess - L5 Scrying and L4 Ice Storm. Oswen takes them - she couldn't normally cast them, it'd be risky, but maybe we will be forced to do it.

Inafina's passive insight makes her recognise frustration. They didn't find what they wanted. Even valuable spell scrolls were ignored, but personal journals were ransacked. **Whatever they wanted, it was very much personal.**

Inafina can air-walk out. The paladin looks strong. She figures a regular rope would do it - she can tie that on him, and there are sturdy bannisters for the other end of the rope. We don't need to use our Rope Of Climbing. Oswen writes a note on parchment - "Don't panic, there was a time freeze spell, we tied the rope to save you, climb up and make your way to the ballroom if you can." Inafina ties the rope and leaves the parchment tucked in so that the rope holds it against the paladin's body and he should see it when time unfreezes. He looks strong and she's hopeful that the unfreeze and him being throw onto the side of the tower by the action of the rope won't hurt him too much. There's a bit of slack in the rope so that when he starts moving, it's not such a jolt as the rope tightens and stretches, to arrest his sideways movement.

Onto the circumferential stair. Down would lead to that 7th satellite tower we think, but we don't know how to "portal out" of here and there's a risk that stairwell might just take us away somehow. We'll return to that later, but for now, there is much to explore above. We head up. It's a long climb for a single storey, some 20ft or so, and then we see some double doors towards the Northern side of the of the tower - luckily, with a stag's head.

A calm room, unusual; white marble. Floor, ceiling, everything. An iron lectern facing the door in the middle of the room holds a huge book, covered in black, 2ft wide, 3ft tall and closed. Hovering above it is a quill with a beautiful foot-long feather, sheathed in flame! It's as if it were a phoenix flame or similar. Oswen Arcana 21; unmistakable - she gets closer - a lion and hart are embossed on the cover, rearing up to face each other. **This is the book of names**. Literally, long lists of names inside - she opens it - at the end, names like Thinnings, Shon, and more - including all three of the Hourglass Coven - Kelek, Zarek, Zargash, Warduke, Skylla. **Those five names are written in a very different hand** - Endelyn's.

So this is the "free access" book. She can't find the names of Valour's Call in here at all, so this explains why they can't go through the Lion head doors either - perhaps they got permission from the Stag, or were physically invited in without being written in the book.

She flips back a few pages to see if there's anyone interesting; but (investigation 17) nothing interesting going backwards. She skips to the front and looks forward. Investigation 23. No names at all are recognised! Everyone is alien. She must read 150 or more. No Mr Witch, Mr Light; nobody we met in the various broken realms who *wanted* to come here. Nobody from the gazebo outside, understandably and nobody from the faerie court, at least nobody that we knew.

Oswen ponders a possibility - worth the risk - Kindle lifts her up; she reaches for the quill; it moves towards her hand. It's warm but doesn't burn. **She tries crossing out "Kelek". The ink kind of scorches in - seems to work. She crosses out Zarek, Zargash and Warduke too. With a pang of guilt - and just in case - Skylla. Then she risks writing her own name. It sears into the page; she writes everyone - her party, Orvil, Valour's Call's names and Elidon.**

Well, that's that! She returns the quill which just hangs in the air again, closes the book and we continue up the stairs.

Another 20ft. We reach the Fourth floor. Looks like the top of the tower. Double doors again; very beautifully ornate; iron; the whole thing is covered in complex arrays of latches, tumblers, cogs and a round doorknob on which is engraved the image of a Nightingale.

We figure this is the treasure room but we never got the password. All the same, we get a good look. Arcana 25 for Oswen. Very complex mechanisms, with a magical connection between all of it, linking to the doorknob. As she tries to trace the magic, she thinks she finds 8 separate locking mechanisms, all connected to the doorknob in the middle. Only that seems to be magical; the rest is mechanical. She shows Bel and he thinks he can pick the locks individually, but we don't know if there would be bad things happening by the individual things being taken out. There are no keyholes though, but Bel can still reach bits of mechanism to manipulate it.

WIS saving throw - Oswen is too tempted - she elects that it's too risky. We need to get back to Elidon and Zybilna and get this thing unfrozen. Then we'll deal with the consequences. We will start heading down the stairs. Oswen is nervous and anxious about times; she doesn't know when the Jabberwock will be back and how long Elidon might hang around. Inafina ADV insight (we've been together) with Guidance from Kindle (who sees the conundrum) insight nat 20, +6, +4 again on Guidance, so that's 30. Elidon's "do not take too long" line weighs heavily on her.

Inafina points out that if the Jabberwork did return, then the sword in the treasure room would deal with it - but then, so would Zybilna. Kindle points out that purely pragmatically, we have the means to undo the magic; we've tied the rope, Strongheart is OK.

Well then - a spell for Bel to fly; Kindle will risk being carried in the hole; Oswen's wings, Inafina's boots; out of the hole in the wall, across the void and onto the lion head balcony by the ballroom (then let Kindle out immediately).

The lion door opens without trouble. **The writing in the book worked**. So we hopefully did restrict Kelek & co's movements likewise.

So there we are in the ballroom. There is a lot unsolved. But Oswen remembers why we came here. For all the desires to save everyone; we had one big thing to do.

We have the poem. Bel checks his notes to check he remembers it correctly. Elidon stands by the cauldron and touches the horn to it. "8 Cats Perch Across..." starts Bel... more poem... and "...All on the cauldron that is ever-seeming", he finishes.

A *burst* of colour emanates and ripples out of the cauldron. There's a cacophany of noise as things fall to the ground, "watch out!" and so-on, a loud thud outside as Strongheart slams into the side of the tower - Ringlerun runs over and starts to cast something to Levitate him. Then Zybilna shouts out, "SILENCE! WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!"

Her hair blows back; a huge crown of antlers rises from her head then calms - she looked different for a moment - then she calms and "looks normal" again.

Oswen walks up a little angry "Well that's a fine way to say 'thank you'!"

"Stop it! Everyone stop!"

"They're trying but they just got unfreezed from a year stuck in time!"

"Oh! Damn. *Too late*." Then she looks at the cauldron. "Wait, have we met?"

Oswen says "Not until just now...? Unless we met you as Iggwilv or Tasha or someone else?!" - Oswen knows what she's doing name dropping like that and, inevitably, WIS save.

* Oswen - Only 12
* Inafina - 22
* Kindle - 24
* Bel - 14

(DC13)

Oswen bears the brunt. She's temporarily frightened as she sees Zybilna's visage melt away back to Iggwilv for a moment; she appears younger, angrier; she appears 'within' Oswen's head and Oswen hears this powerful young woman, "You know nothing about my past! The wars I've one, the enemies I've crushed" - and more. Momentarily flares of light glow on towers behind us - white, red, green, a strange black; Iggwilv looks at the lights and calms as Zybilna. *She* didn't change, but Oswen touched a nerve and some illusion was dropped for Oswen perhaps alone. She doesn't know that actually, the whole party saw it, though the anger *was* directed at her mostly.

Oswen points at the towers and says, "Well that answers a question I had. We've heard some interesting tales and seen some interesting things but your reaction to those towers dispels my fears and I find myself trusting you more!" - persuasion all round, because the rest of the party doesn't know what Oswen was doing and everyone steps in trying to be persuasive and smooth things over.

* Bel 15
* Oswen 13
* Kindle 15
* Inafina 4

Not great, but at least Bel has Courtisan-style spiel from his own experience. It's enough to calm things for a moment... She says: "I apologise for my outburst. But the names Iggwilv and *Natasha* mean nothing to me - they mean *nothing* to me. That is no longer who I am. I have left all of that, and its power behind. I made mistakes as a young wizard, as we all do. Should I have to pay for my mistakes for the rest of my life? I think not. Now do I have your word given to the Fey ruler of this domain that you will keep my secret, or will I have to erase it?"

Oswen says "Well, I apologise in turn - I was interested to see your reaction. It seems we can trust you... You have my word."

"A younger version of me would have reacted very differently and you might be nothing more than dust on the ground right now!"

Oswen replies, "True, I'm sure. But a younger version of you hadn't met Madrick Roslof, and *he* is the reason I am here."

"Ha! Madrick! How fares he? I have not - " - and then she realises. Time... "- Oh! Madrick. Oh my."

Oswen says, "He lived, when I saw him; old and worried; time will have passed differently for him there as it has for me here but it hasn't been too long -"

"- he has moved on", interrupts Zybilna. "Oh! My adopted sisters have been banished - they are in another plane! Is this your doing?"

Oswen doesn't hear. "Sorry, what?" - *Madrick is dead?*

Zybilna repeats. Oswen says, "Well, yes, we had to fight our way through the domains to get here..."

More discussion, but long story short - Zybilna starts to cast spells to repair things. She also mentions, "My children!" - and draws a 'flower door', out of which many children appear. They had been pushed into a pocket dimension for safety when the battle started. She's not worried about the League, or Bloodybeak or the Jabberwock. She thanks Elidon, who can return now to her love. Elidon nuzzles us in turn and thanks us - then just like that, teleports away.

Zyblina - "You have kept much of everything intact! You'e destroyed very little to achieve this end - and for that, I would like to reward you. Please accept this." She pulls out a beautiful small book, with carved ivory corners and binding, an ivory book. "A few of my own creation in here too! Keep it safe" - she hands it to Oswen - "I'm sure it will reveal its mysteries to you in time. You remind me a little of myself! You will be a formidable wizard one day. I can see this! But stay true, keep your friends around you and hopefully you will have the balance and voices - the *conscience* - that I did not have."

She continues, "It might seem trite to say in my position that there are things more important than the pure pursuit of power; the things we do, the people we cross, the mistakes we make; they sometimes hunt us for the rest of our lives. It might do you well to remember that."

Oswen now has a spellbook containing five spells (that Oswen can choose, of any level, but a couple should be Tasha's). She's also happy for us to keep the weapons and scrolls.

"One last thing - I have one casting of this I can do; I could've used to repair the cauldron or undo damage, but you've done much of the work for me! Now... Are you travelling together and do you wish to remain together?"

But at this Oswen starts to list all the things we had to do! Get Star, the children that want to go home and so-on. Zybilna fetches Star by magic, easy! Gleam, Glister and Hurley likewise. Others she will help find their way. The carnival folk, at least, are together.

"Now. Time has passed, as you know. But with a wish, I can send you back to the end of the carnival - the night that you left! I can only do this once. It will be like a dream. People won't believe you! Otherwise, I'm afraid, years have passed."

Oswen says, "I think that suits all of us" (people nod) "but how shall we repay you?"

"You have already repaid you. This is *my* reciprocation for the services you have rendered to my domain. I shall name all of you as Knights Of Prismeer!"

Oswen thanks her; "And a delicate question. Professor Roslof will still live back then. Shall I speak to him?"

"I think he will understand, yes" - she pulls out a single teardrop, shaped like a chicken's foot, a sort of copy of it from under his eye. It forms a gem of sorts. She hands it to Oswen.

Oswen nods. "It will give him great comfort to know that some time in *his* future you will be freed."

"The future; the past; I hope you understand, they exist all at the same time! A future me and a previous me all exist and what happens to one affects the other. You..." - she looks Oswen straight in the eye - and now Oswen sees a young Tasha briefly, very serious - "...don't yet understand the importance of what you have done. The fate of all of Creation hung in the balance! Had you not freed me, we could have risked the end of *everything* as we know it. Maybe one day you will know how important it was, this that you have done."

So we gather together close, ready for the spell.

She recites a poem; let it be undone; back to the first night; everything that has been be; and so-on. Quite a classic! "May nothing have been missed and no time at all has flown by - go home!" - a finger is placed upon Oswen's head.

A flash of stardust...

...and our now rather large group are stood on the side of the lake, as the carnival is packing itself up. A shout - "HURLEY?!" - and Hurley turns to see Burley. This of course causes quite the commotion! "Glister! Gleam!" - Star's mother appears; people crowd around. Many, many questions. "And who are you?!" - they point to Bel. He gets all regal! "Take your turns! Stand back! There are things we need to do!"

Kindle, Inafina and Bel excuse the four of us and we have a few things to do. Madrick is suggested first. Oswen says, "No, just a few more minutes - we must find Diana."

We go to where the carousel *was*; it's nearly packed down but Diana is there. We show her the recovered contract. At first she's unsure - we don't know exactly what will happen when we tear the contract. She decides to go for it. She holds one end; Oswen the other; *rip*!

Diana falls to the ground and seems distressed for a moment, but then *splits* - bizarre! - and actually rather gruesome but it's at least swift. And then there's a normal horse and a person!

We bid our farewells. One last thing - Mr Witch and Mr Light.

Thaco The Clown protests of course, but we just stride on in. They're both inside. "Back so soon?!"

We explain briefly and then just give him the ticket we found - signed by Isolde - and he throws it straight into the fire. They watch it burn down to ash.

Mr Light gives Oswen a kiss on the head - "It was them too! Not just me!" she protests! Mr Witch says, "Look, Inafina - Kindle - you look very different than you did a few hours ago. Not sure what you've been through and not sure I'd understand... But the *four* of you have clearly been through a lot together. I don't think we could really in good conscience keep you to these" - he pulls out their two contracts. "Consider these completed! Of course you are always welcome back any time. Staff rates! Special treatment! But you are free."

He gives the 10gp each as "the rest of your pay".

Mr Light adds, "This is a weight off our shoulders. We'll run into Isolde again some day we're sure, and a deal's a deal, but at least we can run the carnival the way it was meant to - without fear of the Hourglass Coven. They no longer hold anything over us! Their little thieves can steal no more. We will be in town for two more nights and then we'll move on. We're glad we ran into you!"

Mr Light gives Oswen a little hat! "I find this is very useful - I've used it much myself." It's a Hat Of Disguise. Fun! "Thank you! Maybe we'll come back before you go, I can't say for sure, but I hope so. In the mean time, all the best with the carnival either way - and thank you both for your help."

The rest of the carnival is closing down. The new returnees are centre of attention. The others are now keen to see Madrick. "OK. He's not far up the road!" - and Oswen leads the way.

We go past the strange pumpkins and up to the front door and Oswen turns to the other three, "This is it!" she says, turns to the door - and hesitates for moment - a light inside, smoke out of the chimney - turns back, "By the gods but what do I say? You die? You don't see her again? She's OK though?" Kindle asks if everything might have changed, referring back to the past-present-future spell. "True!"

Suddenly Bel jumps and pulls out a rapier! He sticks at something behind a pumpkin. A boggle. Oh! *That's* what Oswen saw out of the corner of the eye, all those days ago - or, a day ago, depending on how you look at it.

Oswen knocks.

"Yes?" "It's Oswen!" "Is everything all right?" - the door opens. On his shoulder is the faerie dragon. He looks - "Oh! You - this isn't possible - but it is possible! Come in! You must be exhausted! I can *sense* her again! I thought it can't possibly be but of course it could."

We go in and Oswen says, "Yes, the short version is that she was in trouble, we managed to help, and she managed to get us back on the same day that we left. Otherwise it would've been years!"

"Well I promised you this" - he pulls a key from his neck. Crystal, different kinds, looking like stained glass, shaped like a purple faerie dragon, but a key. "Find the biggest pumpkin in the garden and in it is what I promised you."

Oswen says, "Well, before that, this..." - and gives him the teardrop-chicken gem. "Ah! Grand! I always asked her for this but she never granted it to me before. How lovely! Thank you. Well, I... Before you go, I promise your reward is there, but will you sit and have some spiked pumpkin tea and tell me what happened? If you have time?"

For once, we have plenty of time.



## Day 15 (or properly in Day 3, depending on whose clock you use!)

We sit and drink, telling all the stories, at times teary-eyed as we recall friends we made, now - as Zybilna said - almost feeling like a dream. The sun starts to rise.

"I think that's it!" he says. "I'm going to go and meet her at last."

"Will we see you again?"

"I should hope so - but either way, you made an old man's final wish come true." He takes the gem we gave and crushes it! A portal opens; beyond we see Prismeer - of course, he had never been granted a physical audience before. He takes his stick and dragon. Looks around the cottage as if seeing it one last time and walks through. The portal closes.

The four of us take time to close the shutters, put out the fire, and basically prepare it for potentially being empty for a while. Then we had to the garden, to look for a pumpkin!

It's not hard to find the biggest one. It's very much bigger than even the other giant pumpkins. But the key - oh. A squirrel is sat next to the pumpkin. Oswen says, "Hi" and hands the key to it. "You have to look in the pumpkin!" it says. "How?" It narrows its eyes. "Break it open!" "Break it?!" "Yes! It's a pumpkin!"

Bel has a rapier, so he cuts into the mass. It takes a while. Eventually he and Kindle pries it open; inside is a chest with a crystal lock. Now we see where the key goes! Oswen opens the chest.

* Three beautiful letters in envelopes that look like they've been there a while
* A beautiful cloak that shimmers, slightly purple (Cloak of Displacement)
* A beautiful suit of magical (+2) leather armour made of, well, almost pale beige, with faerie etchings
* A very delicate unicorn horn-shaped wand, with a small pink gem attached to it (+2 Wand of the War Mage)
* A silk bag containing 8 large gem stones (500gp each)

Oswen checks the letters for names. She hands one each to Kindle, Inafina and Bel.

* Bel opens his - "That's funny! I would not have expected this... How strange!" - and reads it out. It is a letter for the City of Waterdeep, where Madrick is from - a wealthy old family - he has an estate outside the city that belongs to his family, titled and deeded to him - the last, it seems, of his line; the letter is a legal letter that deeds it to the bearer of the letter - it has official seals.

* Kindle has a look - "Interesting! Huh!" - this one is for the Temple Of Tyr - for any worshippers of Tyr - to provide shelter, assistance and divine favour for the bearer, because of a favour owed in turn to Madrick. At some point he did something for them and they're in his debt. It includes things like the casting of a 5th level of lower spell by the temple in the service of the bearer.

* Inafina's is curious. It bears the signature and arcana sigil of someone called *Alustriel Silverhand*; Oswen History 18 knows of a Laeral Silverhand, but not Alustriel. Oswen read the name somewhere... The magister of a place called Silverymoon, a long time ago. Allegedly one of the immortal daughters of the Godddess Of Magic! In her hand, the letter describes kinship between Alustriel thanking the "Feyful Four", with a string of names including Madrick's - "for assistance in securing the safety of the realm". The bearer is owed one favour from Alustriel Silverhand or in the event of her untimely demise, one of Alustriel's devoted apprentice.

Then we spot one last thing. At the bottom of the chest is a brass key with a head shaped like a pumpkin. Just a normal key; the only lock we can think of is the front door to the house. Kindle asks, "Is he giving us the house?" "I guess if he's not coming back" says Bel. Inafina suggests, "At least it means we can look after the place."

The squirrel bounds up. "Are you living here now?" it asks. Oswen shrugs - "I suppose - for the moment, yes?" "Well great! Welcome to the neighbourhood. You see that oak tree over there? The nuts are mine. Welcome. If you need anything you can find me at the tree! My name is Ray, by the way!" "Nice to meet you, Ray!" (and we introduce ourselves).

### 7500XP each (LEVEL 7)

* Bel takes the armour
* Inafina gets the cloak
* Oswen obviously the wand
* Attunements maxed, she gives the Ring Of Shooting Stars to Kindle - and of course, *Bel* is the perfect choice for the Hat Of Disguise.

Oswen says, "Is that it? Do we go our own ways?"

Kindle laughs and says, "Is it bed time?"

Bel is delighted to find an actual bathroom. OK then, bed time. We'll worry about tomorrow (and Leonidas!) later today.



## Day 15, 2pm, after sleeping from the early morning onwards

As she wakes, ideas of new spells swirl in Oswen's mind. She thinks she has some idea how aspects of the Orrery magic worked (Divination) and reckons she could conjure up animated constructs akin to Skabatha's toys, but working for her, to help her party fight up close (Summon Construct). The rest of the party, likewise, awaken with new ideas and greater confidence in skills honed over the last few days.

We're a bit groggy of course, given it's the middle of the day! But it's a spicy-smelling comfortable cottage and sun streams in. It's a very comfortable place.

Oswen says, "This is more my style, I think, than some grand place far away on the coast. If I am to make a home in this world, it would be near the library and people I know." But she's not sure what the professor would have wanted for the estate. Kindle says there was nothing about that in the chest, just a key. Perhaps if we visited, we might find more. We'd have to claim it, anyway; a very long journey would be needed.

There is a heart to heart. Do we stay together? Kindle says he's at his best when looking after people! He would like to keep the hearth warm. Inafina doesn't feel she has anything to prove anymore - she'll visit the monastery one day; but for now, travelling has been fun. Bel needs to report back to the Court - "Maybe get a knighthood or something!" - and given Oswen opining that she's perhaps not finished seeing new things either yet, suggests we maybe all come with him. That sounds like a grand idea.

Bel wants to head to town to start getting things for homemaking in the cottage! We also have things to sell. And Oswen thinks Leonidas would like to see them all, so, without further ado, we gather our things and head into town - well, with a bit of ado; Bel changes into his nicest clothes. He's not worn those before and looks very dapper!

The carnival is still there, although packed down during the day. A few staff swim in the pond. Kindle and Inafina wave, and people wave back.

It feels really strange to be back. We've no clear idea what's happening in Prismeer, though we suspect it'll take a while for it all to be properly fixed. We hope that Zybilna did keep her word and help the kids and others we met there; Oswen really does hope to revisit one day. We do feel a strange sense of responsibility because we told people we were trying to help - we did tell them, we were helping by freeing Zybilna, but of course, they were looking to us as a source of hope and possibility.

We spend time finding places to sell gems and necklaces; and Bel wants to buy his house stuff; and Oswen has some spell components to acquire. "Sembia doesn't haggle", says the DM, so to save time we just run the numbers - there's a necklace and 8 gems together worth a crazy 4250gp, minus 400gp for a lockbox for Summon Construct, and 4x25gp for incense. 3750gp would be left. Bel needs crockery, pillows, blankets, curtains and so-on; we order beds for delivery from a furniture shop; we share the costs out of our existing pot for those though.

We still have 100 various hourglasses at 25gp each! Infina remembers sticking a carnival poster onto a gallery, but it might not be the right place... It gives Oswen an investigation start point - INV 16 - we try to persuade them to buy. It's pretty strange, Oswen helping Bel, with Kindle being assumed to be his bodyguard and Bel - although being a Satyr and surprising to people here - is certainly dressed the part. To Oswen's surprise, Bel lies! He claims these things were inherited from a famous eccentric collector called *Mister* Moongrave! She's a bit uncomfortable but recognises that the true story would be unbelievable to most, so she's happy to pitch in. Unfortunately it goes very badly! (ADV Deception, 4,4+10 -> 14). At the next place, he tries making it more of a show with Inafina. This goes much better! (PERF 26). Sold! As a single collection. We don't haggle, again - it's 2,500gp, we don't need it anyway! This gallery poetically is also the place with a perfect lockbox for Oswen.

A temple to Yondalla, at Kindle's request, is our source of incense. Kindle decides to tithe the Woodcutter's Axe - useful for a hearth temple to cut firewood! - we hope there aren't any other giant beanstalks! The temple insists we take 4 blocks of incense for that, which we accept, knowing that the axe is worth far more, so they have gained a fair bit (which is what Kindle wanted). Oswen learns that Kindle knows the divination spell she'd figured out too, so both of them are keen to have its required components.

6250gp. That's more money than Oswen thought existed in big banks!

Bel encourages Oswen to transcribe her scrolls. As long as he's know her she's always wanted to uncover the secrets of the universe - why not write all of it? Easy come, easy go - this morning, we had none of this money and didn't care. Even after copying the scrolls, we'll have thousands left. So Oswen agrees and spends half an hour or so, while the others rest at a cafe while others drink and eat an early evening meal, transcribing a bevvy of scrolls:

L1 scroll: Expeditious Retreat
L1 scroll: Grease
L2 scroll: Hold Person
L4 scroll: Ice Storm
L4 scroll: Polymorph

...at 40gp each (less than the usual 50gp thanks to the magic quill), still needs 520gp of ink. The shop Oswen finds for this can scarcely believe their luck as she pretty much buys everything they have - especially when she asks if they happen to have 200gp more, because she's got a L5 scroll that she can't transcribe yet but will be able to in future. They've got a beautiful room for her to sit in and concentrate while she copies. When she comes back out, less than half an hour later, thee clerk is surprised and asks what's wrong - but Oswen shows the book with the new spells, winks, says, "I found a way to do this quickly in my travels!" and heads out. "Ah! You must be a scribe!" says the clerk.

Ater rejoining her friends at the cafe, she realises she's been actually putting off asking to go the library. And now, it's getting late, and Leonidas won't be working, but we can ask people where he might be. And so, we head there.

This causes great surprise. Oswen forgot - it's been only a day! They ask - "but I thought you were off on a journey! You look different... Wait..." - and at least, because we look different and there's a whole group of us, it's easy to explain - Fey wild, time is strange, it's been half a month for us, but barely a day here. She asks if they know where Leonidas might be... "Ummm - well - he didn't come to work today" (Oswen internally cringes!) "because he said he was feeling too sad to work" (and now Oswen feels guilty) "but between you and me he was probably hung over" (and now Oswen feels confused). "So, would he be in his room maybe?" "I would try the courtyard first!" "OK - thank you!" "It's good to see you." (Oswen also explains - the best she can, that the Professor "left this world"; and long story short, we've ended up with the cottage).

We hasten to the courtyard and Oswen's breath catches in her throat - there he is. Asleep! Under her favourite tree; apparently his, too. He has a book over his face. A mug of drink has been knocked over. Oswen picks it up and then thinks for a minute... not noticing the rest of the party making themselves scarce - then clears her throat. "Leonidas? Wake up!" - but he keeps snoring. She makes a minor illusion sound of a cockerel! That works. He sits up quickly, the book falling away, then looks confused; sees Oswen a bit cross-eyed as she's very close!

"What?!" - he hits himself in the face!

Oswen says, "No, stop! Remember - time in the Fey is strange - we got sent back the next day!"

He reaches out, looking unsure, to touch her cheek and pushes her hair back behind her ear. Oswen gets goosebumps. "It *is* you! I had the weirdest dream!" "What was that?" "I was farming... I was harvesting my grapes and then I looked over and saw you at the edge of the woods, near my father's vineyard. But when I ran over, you were gone. And then I noticed that I was old! Like - my *father* old! And *then* a rooster crowed!"

Oswen chuckles. "Well, the rooster was me. The other thing - that's going to take some explaining. Surprised to hear it though. Here, maybe this will help?" - and gives him the wish stone.

"What's this?" - he holds it - "Oh... It feels familiar..." - he inspects it - "This is worth a lot! There's a gem in it!" and Oswen says, "Oh! Don't sell it. I have one too - look!" and shows him. "But what is it?" "Well, that's a bit more explaining..." - and she does her best. "But the wish I made came true!" he says. "Mine too!"

The party is introduced. They say they'll sort out stuff with the cottage while Oswen and Leonidas walk and chat. We'll meet at the fountain at the square after sundown.

Oswen tells the story as best she can.

It's strange because Oswen expected time to pass for Leonidas and for him to be changed a lot, perhaps even in a new relationship. Instead it was she who changed. But Leonidas is excited for her; he has another year on his internship and likes being in the city a while more before going back to the country. We also both agree we very much enjoyed the crazy carnival experience but we think, aside from visiting *people*, we won't try to replicate that with another night there. Instead we can enjoy that memory and all the opportunities it provided.

Leonidas takes Oswen up to an observation tower he found in the middle of the city. It's busy up there but there's room to lean against the bannisters and watch the sun go down. It's beautiful. In the distance, we can see twinkling lights of the Witchlight Carnival as it gets ready. Lanterns and lamps are starting to move along the road as people start to head to it.

"Well, I hope that all of them have at least half as much as we did!" he says.

Oswen says, "Yes, and for us it seems, a chance to build a future. It's a new start for me, perhaps both of us, but I've seen a version of which might come to pass, and I very much like how that looks."

"I would like that too! You should visit the vineyard some time!"

"I'd like to. If we go to the Summer Court, or even back to Prismeer, would you want to visit - if it was safe?"

"Sure! I'd just need to make sure that I wasn't gone for ages!"

"Yes, that's a risk! Can't like, it was shock to be told it would've been *years*, but we know it's all inconsistent from place to place."

Oswen notes that more research in libraries would be good. Leonidas thinks he saw a book somewhere that said "the rivers of time flow differently in the fey wild but at certain times of the year, the different realms connect and align and when they do, time must pass identically across them all until they diverge again." "Well then that will be our chance! And I just realised we maybe shouldn't have sold 100 hourglasses - maybe they were telling us about times in fey domains! But we'd never have understood it."

The sun sets. Oswen realises the sun would've set on the ground sooner, as we're up on a tower! We need to hurry (again). We run!

Kindle is sat on the edge of the fountain with Inafina. Bel is telling them a story. We join. On approach, we see, next to the fountain, is cart loaded with things. "This is ours I take it?" "Yes! Guess who has to pull it home?" says Kindle.

Leonidas accepts the invitation to the cottage overnight. Bel says we don't have enough beds - Leonidas goes bright red - Oswen clears her throat - OK, moving on...

We get onto the road; we're trailing the carnival-goers; a *huge* queue. Very happy, good vibe. Face paint and all sorts. Oswen looks through Orvil a little and sees Northwind (the Treeant) droppings its sycamore seeds for new attendees - and it waves! She waves back, but just in case Northwind saw Orvil instead of her, Orvil does a barrel roll in response (which makes Oswen dizzy, as she's looking through his eyes). Music is playing, big top announcements - a sense of nostalgia, but no feeling of missing out.

We get back. Kindle gets to work on food, we eat, share stories, work to set up some of the new bits of the house; Bel gets curtains up; Inafina has a meditation futon! Kindle takes Madrick's bed as it's big enough. Bel and Oswen have new beds - fortunately, a double in Oswen's case, because she's so small.

Curtains are drawn. People get ready for sleep. They head off to bed, Kindle staying up - content to potter about, do household things. No pressure, no risk; a new family; content to sit for a while, content for now, before we head off to seek a new adventure. After all, we never did find the organist's "real" body (Earnest); it wasn't in Prismeer.

Oswen rejoins Leonidas. "Is this our first night? This is our first night. I don't know what we're meant to do - I mean - I know *that* - I mean - ..." and Leonidas just cuddles. She curls up as little spoon; they fall asleep. PG-13.

Through the window, outside, we can see that Kindle is in the garden, emptying a scraps bucket onto the compost. The squirrel is on his shoulder. He smiles, looks up to the moon, a faraway look; he looks to the house, smiles to himself, mutters something unheard, and heads back inside.
