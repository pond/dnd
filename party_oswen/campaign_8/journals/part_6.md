# Oswen: Part 1.6
## Day 7, morning, Thither
### Nib's Cave

Nib, a friend of Clapperclaw, has given us some remarkable gifts. Clapperclaw is returning to Hither so now, the four of us are poised to start a new adventure in this new domain. Granny "Scabatha" Nightshade rules here and, unlike our previous escapade, she will surely be ready for our arrival as news of the changes in Hither will, we suspect, take very little time to spread.

We've spent time chatting, drinking tea - and attuning to our new gifts, where necessary. Bel tries to find out more about what's going on in this new domain. Nib feels his strange form of curse is penance and doesn't have a particular problem with that Granny Nightshade did, he is very clear that she is *not* a good person!

"She has stolen and captured from various planes" (he's not sure how) "many children, toiling away in her workshop in **Loomlurch**, a huge fallen tree that spans a ravine and houses a small settlement". He's not seen it, but has been told by visitors that a small goblin market has popped up there and now, Granny Nightshade lives there, with a toy workshop. She makes the toys to deliver - the creepiest ones she can, to deliver to children on different worlds - to fill their heads with nightmares, making the deliveries herself on the back of a flying rocking horse! She has a giant key in her back that turns relative to her mood. **If it turns quickly, you're safe; she's happy. If upset it turns slowly. If it stops - then you should be worried! She's losing her temper.** That manifests itself in many ways, quite unusual he's heard, but he doesn't have specifics.

"There is one person, at least, who opposes Granny Nightshade" he says. He thinks it must be one of the escaped children; he's helped others escape himself. His name is **Will, Will of the Fey Wild**. Nib has never been visited by Will but has met people who've shown him - and he finds, and shows us - a wanted poster!

D8->2. The poster looks like someone with an afro (not too different from Kaya, Ravnica campaign, but a boy!) - the wanted poster promises, if the child is returned, "you will win the heart of the one you love". Given what happened to Octavian, we don't like the sound of *that* at all!

"You can find Will at **Little Oak**. I can point you in the direction if you'd like? Or I can point you towards Loomlurch if you want to confront her!"

Oswen says, "Well, we do intend to, but we need to learn much more about what's going on first. For a start, if we did confront her and if we managed to defeat her in some way - how would we ever return all those children to where they came from? And what about all the curses?" (Nib says that **Zybilna is the only one who can do *that*...**) "So, I think Little Oak sounds like a good place to start."

Nib gives us directions. It's deeper into the woods. We leave the cave, turn right... He gives us some landmarks. "Keep your wits about you!" "What's out there?" "Of late, there have been reports of Red Caps running wild. This place has never had Red Caps before."

(Inafina looks very worried. Oswen realises she definitely *did* see what was on the table).

"We'll be wanting to avoid them for sure! We ran into one once and it wasn't fun. Thank you so much for your help! Is there anything we can do to repay you?"

"Any small token of kindness given freely would be payment in spades. If you were so inclined."

Oswen thinks for a minute and is about to give him something but Bel hands him the old lute, before she can act! "This lute has seen deep forest of the Fey Wild. It has travelled to the Court of the Summer Faeries and played music for Queen Titania herself. It has served me well over many moons and I hope it gives you some measure of solace and peace as it has me."

Nib bows! "This is a very kind and valuable gift indeed. One that carries memories and goodwill. That is worth more to me now than all the wealth I've accumulated in my life."

So we depart. At the cave exit Oswen grabs Bel's hand and kisses his hand, it's all she can reach. "Are you alright?!" he asks and she says, "I was thinking what best to give him, and was thinking maybe my old spellbook - it sort of has no magical value now, the spells have moved but it carries so many memories. It's how magic started for me. But then, you gave him the lute; it was very sweet of you, I didn't expect that. Thank you."

Bel suggests that Oswen could write their story in her old spellbook. That way, it has even more value. Oswen decides she'll turn it into a journal.

Inafina hugs Bel but then looks to the group and says, "So - I'd - well I'd really like to avoid those Red Caps if we can."

"That's the plan!" - and off we go.



### The Great Oak

D20->11. We follow the directions given. The sun is climbing higher into the sky as midday gets closer. Suddenly, we we hear a commotion; but then, giggling and chatter. We've not shied away from things in the other domain so we don't here; we head towards the noise. We don't sneak up, we just walk normally. Very soon we see a huge - truly gigantic - gnarled oak. It towers over all the other trees, spreading wide - but its leaves are yellow and brown, falling to the ground. A thick carpet of dead leaves surround it.

Three rusty sickles lie amongst the leaves. Standing next to each is a goat! The goats are bleating repeatedly, but the giggling sounds we heard seem to be coming from the trees. Inafina, hearing this, perception 14; she sees 8 tiny houses made of woven twigs, nestled in the oak's boughs. They'd have been hidden but for the loss of leaves. Squirrels dart nervously around; but Inafina is *sure* she could hear voices. A few giggling, a few scolding, and a few concerned / worried voices.

Inafina asks Oswen to try and say hello, so in Sylvan, Oswen calls out, "Hello, is there anyone here?"

Faerie dust appears next to her as three tiny pixies emerge. They reply. "Oh, hello! I'm Amarylis, this is Calluna and this is Zynia. Please do not go near the goats! Do not hurt them. We need your help!" "What's wrong?" "You see, well" - Amarylis says, "Grandfather tree is dying! I think it's the hag's fault." Zynia says, "Yes, but one thing at a time! These three goats - these three Red Caps came trying to hurt the tree and throwing rocks at our houses. So we did what any threatened pixie would do!" Calluna finishes up, "We turned them into goats! But that was about 50 minutes ago and the polymorph only lasts an hour. We tried to pick up the sickles but the moment we went near them the goats charged us and we can't attack them as they'll turn into Red Caps..." - they continue to fret. Oswen says, "OK, keep calm and keep at a safe distance, we'll see what we can figure out."

Oswen explains to the party, as Kindle and Infina don't speak Sylvan. Kindle says, "Well I can cast Sleep..." - which sounds like a great idea, so we agree and he casts; he tells us to get back, L2 so 7d8 instead of 5d8 -> unnecessary it seems, rolls very high! 44! All three goats sleep. "Outstanding!" exclaims Oswen. "OK, let's grab the sickles" - we fold them into the portable hole. The goats won't know we've done it because they're asleep and we say to the pixies, "Don't tell!"

More and more pixies are appearing, watching us work. Inafina says, "Well, I suppose we have fight? But we need to protect the tree. Maybe they'll run? We could try and intimidate them into not coming back, say the tree is protected, the pixies *did* make them into goats and they lost their weapons."

So we figure that's worth a shot. We'll wait until they turn back, and they'll awaken in their normal form to no weapons and us lot, and we'll say that pixies are not to be trifled with. Soon enough, the goats turn into Red Caps. They look very similar to the one we tackled at Bavlorna's place. The pixies conjure some huge flowers, which squirt water at them to wake them up!

Awake, confused and a bit angry, they demand for their sickles back. The pixies are arming themselves with rocks. The two red caps see us, shout, "Blooded people!" and run at us. "Let us soak our hats in your blood!"

Bel tries to intimidate with Guidance from Kindle, pointing out the *huge* scary Harengon - Oswen adding in special illusion and sound effects - Bel intimidation 21, Inafina ADV performance is only 16; Red Caps roll insight; it's close - 19 - vs intimidation 21, so they're at least scared. "Well -" - they harumph and bluster - "- it's Granny Nightshade's fforest anyway! She'll come for hers! And I'm still putting this up!" - it marches towards the tree to do *something*. Oswen, taking no chances, runs in between, quick as a flash, back to the tree; she tries Thunderwave, DC15 CON - but the red caps are very hardy - but even so, they take full damage (5, 6, 9, + 4 each - all fail!) - 2d8->10 damage each, pushed back 10 feet.

The red cap that was approaching throws down a scroll he had scrunched up in his hand. They "rarg" and bluster at us a bit but not really very coherently and they stomp off in anger. One even pulls his red cap off his head, throws it to the ground, stomps on it and walks off without it!

Oswen approaches the hat; it's pretty grim, but that *could* be useful... At least it's dry! She puts it in her backpack, cleaning the boot prints with Prestidigitation, and even so using two fingers to hold it!

We turn to the pixies. "Sorry about the noise but they weren't taking the hint."

One pixie heads to the scrunched up paper. They work together to pull it open. It's another wanted poster; it's Will again, but the reward is different; d8->3; "Wanted! Will of the Fey Wild! Bring me this imp alive and unharmed and I'll bury you up to your neck in silver!"

Oswen says, "She's not even *trying* to hide how bad the rewards are. You'd have to be a fool to not see what *that* would mean."

With Bel's help, Oswen checks the tree. Nature ADV, 4,10+4 -> 14. It's being starved of energy and life force somehow (and it's about 600 years old). **This isn't a poison or something we can directly fix - the land is cursed**. The tree is absorbing strange toxic energies around to protect younger trees.

We explain; time is of the essence, but we've no idea how long it might take to solve this. We just have to hope the tree holds on. The pixies believe that the Grandfather Tree wants to protect the next generations and is unlikely to let them take more effort. **Only ridding Thither of Granny Nightshade could save it.**

They share interesting information. The Red Caps started appearing shortly after Granny Nightshade took over the forest. They seem to have no redeeming qualities! "Yes, much like their creator!" observes one pixie. "I went to confront her about it and I saw that she *grows* the Red Caps in a garden near her lair" claims another. It sounds plausible, given what we saw with Lornlings. "They just grow out of nowhere!" say a few, but one thinks they don't grow, they spontaneously appear; another says she gives birth to it...

Then there's talk about which direction the lair is in. 300 miles one way; 40 miles in another direction; 2 miles in a third. OK - they've no idea. And we might have to take much of what they say with a pinch of salt, except to say that Granny Nightshade probably does "make" these creatures somehow. Probably sent one to Bavlorna - probably as a spy, disguised as a cook!

We show them Bavlorna's effigy of Granny Nightshade. Apparently it's quite accurate.

They also say they've seen Granny Nightshade riding her wooden rocking horse, flying across the sky. And finally, they point to the poster - if anyone can help us - that would be Will!

We wish the pixies well and continue on our way to Little Oak. As we leave, the pixies all appear - we count 24 of them - to sing us a song as we go, thanking us for our help. We feel Inspired!



### Ambush!

D20->19; D8->4.

Inafina's ears prick up (passive perception). She warns everyone; so we aren't surprised - a dryad and seven awakened shrubs burst from the undergrowth and surround us. The dryad looks *furious*; she's almost consumed with tears of rage. It looks like she's not slept in a long time. She points and says, "Show these villains the true meaning of revenge!" The shrubs start to advance.

Oswen cries out in Sylvan, "Friend dryad! I was raised by a dryad family in the fey; we are not your enemy!" - ADV persuasion 13,16+0 -> 16. The dryad pauses for a moment but one of the shrubs has already reached Bel and hits him with 3 slashing damage. Oswen calls to the shrub, "Please, don't worry, don't be scared, we won't hurt you."

The dryad coughs a laugh. "Nonsense! You've already hurt the whole forest! You're killing everything. Not you, your master."

She's in pain. Dryads are attached to the forest; they marry for life to a tree. Bel says in Sylvan, "But we're here to try and drive Granny Nightshade away from this place, not to work for her!" - persuasion only 13. It buys some time. Oswen pulls out the red cap. She throws it on the ground. "Look! This is one we chased off, and it was so angry it threw away its cap. And look! These two effigies - this one is Nightshade - these were made by Bavlorna in Hither and we defeated her, that's how we got them."

The dryad calls off the attack, unapologetic, though. "You - you are not with the witch?"

Oswen says, "No, we aren't. And we've seen already some of the damage she's causing..."

"The only ones who wander around who aren't children are allied with her. That is why I attacked. I must stop further destruction of the forest. She cut down my tree to make wooden toys!"

To Oswen, hearing that - knowing dryads as she does - is horrifying. She doesn't need to fake her shock, "You must be in so much pain - I'm so sorry - we're trying to help..."

"I'm no longer whole. I'll never be whole again. All I can do is devote my life to stopping others from feeling this emptiness and pain."

We learn her name; **Meadowleaf**.

Oswen says, "Then perhaps you could help us. Attacking is likely to get you killed eventually. We need information. We need to know more about where and how Granny Nightshade modes around, her habits, any weaknesses - thinks she hates, maybe, anything really that might gives us an edge! Maybe - maybe you could find ways to watch her, pass on information to us somehow?"

"Well... There is something I do know... You may find some answers at the **Wayward Pool**." It's on the way to Little Oak, we learn. "It's a small, beautiful lake, covered in mist. There is one half of a mated pair of unicorns that lives there - **Lamorna**. She has lost her mate, **Elidon**. We don't know where Elidon has gone. She was taken by the three witches. Lamorna has been lamenting her loss ever since.

We think back to the Witchlight Carnival; that was a unicorn ride too. Maybe there's something in that.

The dryad knows a secret; the pool and lake are protected by powerful magic. Lamorna wants nobody to approach her in her grief. **We must light the brazier on the small island in the middle of the lake to get her to appear**, but anyone who comes within 1000ft of the shoreline finds themselves confused and back where they started. The only way to defeat the magic is to approach as a unicorn (!) or - Meadowleaf says - "if you *look* like a unicorn, or stick a horn on your head, then the magic doesn't activate. Do you intend to drive Nightshade from this land? To rid us of Scabatha?"

Oswen nods and says, sincerely, "or die trying."

"Then you may be able to stem the building. But the damage that has been done won't be fixed until Zybilna is released. Will you..." - and she says this as if a vow - "...seek to free Zybilna and restore the land?"

Oswen says, "That's actually the reason we came - to find out what happened to her and, now we know, to set her free; but we have to defeat the hags to do that."

Meadowleaf reaches into her hair, takes out a fruit, which turns into a nut - the Fey Wild can be very strange - which she cracks open, revealing three sycamore seeds. "Throw one in the air if you need to pass undetected."

Each seed acts as a PWAT spell casting with duration of 1 hour. No concentration is required. But each of three can only be used once. We thank her sincerely.

Oswen reaches into her backpack and digs around a while, frowning, then goes, "ah-ha!" and pulls out a mid-sized leaf. It's like a large maple leaf. It's brown, but but almost like parchment. She offers it to Meadowleaf; "This can't ease your pain, but it might remind you that there are places and people who are good and helpful and nice. This was from a tree that was very dear to me in the home where I was raised by dryads who found me and took me in. I'd like you to have it."

Meadowleaf holds it close to her chest. "Thank you... This is... For one lonely soul to receive part of another is an antidote for the despair. I will cherish this memory."

We bid farewell and move on - but now we're looking for a lake.



### Bad Unicorn

On the way, Oswen investigation 18+6->24, she finds some good sticks that might be fashioned into unicorn horns that Bel could help us secure with his disguise kit. Bel, something of a jack-of-all-trades, manages to work the wood into passable horns with ribbons to tie under the chin.

Hmm, it'll do!

Orvil will have to hide in the fey when we get close as he can't be disguised as unicorn, but in the mean time he flies up high to see above the treetops and see if he can spot a distant gap that might contain the lake. ADV perception, 17. There's a river weaving across our path, then a beautiful chain of mountains with a very ovious lake in front. He comes back and conveys that Oswen. "We'll have to cross a river, as well as somehow get to the middle of the lake" says Oswen. "We could try fly spells, but we'd be burning a lot for all of us to get over twice. And thrice, to get back to dry land after! Maybe we need to make a boat or raft or something, at least for the lake." "Perhaps there'll be one at the lakeside we can borrow" suggests Inafina. For now, we head towards the river.

It's a long way; we walk for an hour before reaching the riverbank. We're downstream of a confluence some distance away. D20 luck roll, a high 19! Nearby we see an old centaur. "Hello!" hails Oswen - "My name's Oswen!" - hoping to foster trust by giving away her name immediately. The centaur, as we get closer, is at a camp he's set up. He introduces himself as **Winterbow**. "Turn back! Turn back now! The realm is fading. As you head north, more of it dies!"

He explains - he is the last of his tribe. The rest made it away. He couldn't keep up and was lost on this side of the mist. The others made it out. He thinks all hope is lost. We explain that we know this split-up domain as Thither, and have come from the other side of the mists at Hither, where we defeated a hag and started to heal the land. We hope to repeat that here. Bel helps; Oswen persuasion, 2,20+0 - but he got 20 as well! He's not cheered up but does believe us. "It's too late for me" he claims, and we sympathise, but suggest he maybe seeks out Nib's Cave. Instead, he says he wants to see out the last of his days on this river bank, where he first met his love... He will remember her "always, in the golden days of our life". We learn that she made it through the mists.

When we ask, he agrees to help us over the river. He takes us to the campfire and creates some kind of tea, pouring it for all of us. He warns that it's bitter, but made of essence of lily pad. "Oh! A sort of walk on water potion?" "Yes!" "Great!" and Oswen downs it! Inafina copies; the others do. It lasts until the sun sets. "You haven't much time" he says. From that, we learn that it's around 4pm.



### 4pm

We walk to the shore. He says to Inafina, quietly, "Keep your ears out - there's someone following you. I will not help them." Inafina just nods in response.

We thank and leave the sad centaur, then simply walk over the river! Quite an experience. It's almost as if there is a layer of ice, but with some give. We get carried by surface currents a little, but not much; mostly it passes under us.

On the far bank, quietly, Inafina risks telling us about our follower. She'll keep her ears out! Orvil thinks we're about 2 miles (around 10,000 feet) away from the lake, so a long way yet. We press on, Orvil occasionally checking distance so he doesn't get too close! As we get closer he finds himself inexplicably veering off course, so Oswen calls him back down and pops him into the Fey.

At this point, as we're waiting for Orvil to fly down, Inafina listens quietly. ADV perception 19+5->24, definitely someone following, at a distance. 300ft. They got over the river easily enough it seems. She whispers, "I'm not so comfortable leading who or whatever this is across the lake, or giving away anything we know that they shouldn't. I think we should hide and wait for them to approach!" We have our sycamore seeds of PWAT, but *don't* want our pursuer to completely lose our trail, so we don't use those.

* Kindle wants to know who wants his Vigilant Blessing. We agree that if it comes to a fight, Inafina's initial speed can be a great distraction, so she gets his blessing. He casts Guidance on Oswen, for good measure.

* Bel gathers us close together. He pulls out his new golden instrument and says he can make someone invisible. Kindle stands out anywhere! So, we decide Kindle should get this. Bel plays a song, and slowly, Kindle fades out of view.

Now we hide! Stealth:

* Kindle ADV 14
* Bel 13
* Oswen 13
* Inafina 16

Not great! There's a bugbear shaped gap between two close bushes; hoof prints leading behind a another; a tip of a hat poking up behind a rock; and one raised ear, seen around a tree trunk. We have to hope it's enough. (DM rolls perception for our pursuer - nat 1! Now there's some luck).

Someone slight, hood-up, walking purposefully, strides past. They are armed! A wicked-looking dagger and a hand crossbow, checking tracks carefully. This does not look like a friend but we can't judge too carefully. They're really making a beeline towards Wayward Pool.

Oswen decides to risk putting on the helm and trying Detect Thoughts, but she has to whisper the verbal component - INT-based stealth - only 11 with Guidance. DC13 WIS save, whether or not the creature hears the casting; she sees the creature look her way, so must've been heard, but at the same time she's suddenly "in their head". They are a "he" and is thinking "wait, there's someone in the bushes?!" at the surface, rather unsurprisingly! It's actually an Orc, **Zarak** - but Oswen focuses on hostile intent towards us. And interestingly, *no overt hostile intent* towards the four of *us* - *but* - some hostile intent... Insight 7, she's not sure who or what it is towards. She detects just a bit deeper, too, a question; "How are they going to get to the lake".

So Oswen steps out, "It's me you heard, Zarak, and I know you don't mean us any harm, but why are you following us? My name is Oswen."

He looks surprised. "You've discovered me!" he says. "I don't mean any harm to you. I just want you to tell me what you're doing. You're headed towards the lake, which tells me that you know a way to get to the lake. I too would like to go to the lake."

Oswen says, "Well, I know you have hostile intent towards *something*. Would that business be at the lake?"

He scowls. Oswen senses that he'd like to kill the unicorn! It has very valuable things to him - not just to him, but things valuable to the League Of Malevolence. So Oswen punts and tries, "Surely the League have plenty of ways to get what they need, without the unicorn?" - she's trying to probe deeper with her spell. Risky.

"How do you know about the league?"

He fails his WIS13 saving throw at Oswen's attempts to probe deeper. A flood of information! She realises - oh my - a memory; then more; a flood...

* Zarak and four others have been to the Palace Of Hearts Desire (but doesn't know if that's before or after the domain was split). They know how to get there.
* Their self-proclaimed leader is a human sorcerer, **Kelek**. He wants to kill the unicorn...
* ...Kelek wants a powerful magic staff belonging to his most hated rival, the wizard **Ringlerun**, who belongs to the most hated rivals of the League Of Malevolance
* Both descended to the Palace *before* the freezing
* The hags somehow used an artefact called **Iggwilv's Cauldron** that froze *everyone* in the palace, including of course Zybilna - *and* Ringlerun - so he can't get the staff
* But a unicorn's horn is a component required to free someone, to wrench them out, so that he could take the staff. It doesn't break the spell for anyone else, just for one person. She doesn't know what *else* might be needed.
* **Zargash** - an evil human priest of **Orcus** the archdemon - hopes to challenge Kelek's leadership and wants to do it before Kelek acquires the staff; but Zargash is biding his time, because Kelek is protected by a huge mercenary - in her mind's eye he seems to wear full on almost-comical 80s D&D huge plate armour, painted black with blood, a flaming longsword - **Warduke**.
* There's a fifth person - a human warlock named **Skylla** gets her magic from a *very* powerful fey called **Baba Yaga**. She knows more about the Cauldron and the Hags than anyone else, because Baba Yaga is the mother of both Iggwilv *and* all three Hags. But - Baba Yaga has gone missing and nobody knows how to find her!

If the hags are children of Baba Yaga, then Oswen knows that we might not have killed Bavlorna at all - probably (at best) banished to another plane. Powerful and ancient in theory. Perhaps we're seeing the "tip of an icerbeg" in this plane; or they're just not as powerful - yet - as the mother. And a coven of hags is at its most formidable when they are in a group, together.

Oswen tries to hide the shock at this revelation, but deception 7, it shows on her face immediately. Zarak realises that something's up... But he fails *again* on his third WIS13.

* "I need to kill her. I think she's discovered something. But I can't until she tells me how to cross the lake."

He tries to be persuasive - to ask about it - 11. Oswen feigns interest. She talks about everyone going to the lake via the forest; but we used the bird to find the edge of the effect that confuses people, stopped here and were getting bearings to go to the mountains. The mesa isn't protected - nobody tries to get to the lake that way. So that's our play.

Deception 18+2 -> 20! She senses as the helm spell fades that he believes her. She continues now without the benefit of the mind reading insights.

"But what of Zargash?" she asks. "Do you not want his rulership challenge to succeed?"

"What?! No!" - he reveals that he just wants to belong. He gets an equal share of spoils. He wants to be respected and obeyed and feared, for the "mighty orc that he is". He has no desire to lead anyone; he's happy for others to make those decisions. As long as he gets to benefit.

She hopes he might just follow the path she described, to get out of our way. But unfortunately, not so. He says, "You are headed to the lake, then? Hmmm. Maybe... It can be quite dangerous out there. Maybe we should go together. Since you already know I'm here. And you can clearly see that I am very capable and quite fearsome. You are small and defenceless. I could protect you from the evils of the lake."

Oswen puts the cards on the table. "We do not wish the unicorn dead. And you seem to have ignored my repeated use of the word 'we'. You only see me."

"Yes, you and your bird!"

"Take care not to make assumptions. I wish no battle today, but if forced into one, will defend myself; I know you intended to kill me once you were sure you knew the secret of the lake." (The last part, loudly, for the benefit of the others).

She gave him the option to walk the lake alone - but nope - so... Initiative!

* Inafina (ADV) 24
* Bel 19
* Oswen 14
* Kindle 11

Inafina, surprisingly quietly - dirty 20 stealth - springs out from behind the tree and attacks in a flurry of blows. Good start; first hits, max damage 8, but the orc is ready (perception 24) and dodges some of the damage. Second blow hits for 5, third (14 to hit) *just* makes it, for 7 damage.

Bel leaps (mirthfully) out - not at all quietly! - and to Oswen's surprise goes straight into melee with his rapier, flanking with Inafina; hits; max 12 damage. The orc harumphs as if marginally annoyed, takes one step back but keeps just in melee range with the two of our party, then pulls something out of his crossbow. A garrotte! It whips around Bel's neck, doing 7 damage and causing him to be grappled. Bel is unable to breathe. He uses one hand to hold the garrotte and throws a dagger at Oswen, 23 to hit! Definitely hits; 7 piercing and 6 poison damage. She's not holding her rose so takes 13 (more than half of her 24hp).

Oswen as a free action grabs the rose out of her pouch (just in case!) - she tries L2 Magic Missile, only 1d4+1 for each, four missiles. Damage roll is in the middle - 8+4 -> 12 total. Surprisingly, he goes down and Bel is freed; but Oswen suspects Orcs have a way of getting back up (Nature 17) and she calls a warning to Kindle.

Kindle is conflicted. A person is down; party members are injured; he runs up to Zarak and tries to pin him down, but bonus action Healing Word for Oswen - heals her for a very solid 12, which is almost back to full health. She thanks him.

Inafina ties up the Orc. He's unconscious. Oswen says, "He'll kill us if he gets free, but, I don't think it's right to just - well basically murder someone when they're down... Even though I've been in his mind. Not many redeeming qualities if I'm honest. He is happy to benefit from the misfortune of others."

We could just him tied up. Use a sycamore seed so he can't follow us. "Yes" says Bel. "Leave him for the forest to deal with!"

We have to use 15ft of our rope to tie him up, which is a shame. But we get 45ft back. We throw a down a sycamore seed so we leave no tracks, put on our unicorn horns (!) and flee towards the lake. As we hurry along, Oswen relays what she learned. We're in a lot more trouble than we thought!

* The rival wizard is perhaps good aligned, since he was frozen in the Palace - but we can't be sure.
* Freeing Zybilna would let her free others, but we'd have to kill a unicorn to do it; we won't do that.
* We need to learn more about the Cauldron; that is going to have to be our key to unfreezing everyone.

A while later, we're at the shores of a very beautiful lake. It's getting a bit later, so the sun has gone from sunrise to sunset; the lake is still, reflecting the colours in the sky and the mountains on the far side. In the middle we spy a the small island; a small hill, a few flowering bushes and at the top, a brazier. Seeing the low sun, we hurry across to it, knowing we can't walk on water for too much longer. We don't even leave ripples in the water as we walk across it.

Prestidigitation is enough to light the brazier. The fire is clearly magical; smoke rises vertically into the still, evening sky. We hurry back to the bank. The sunset tonight seems particularly intense.

Oswen, perception 14. Shimmering in the water, then rising above the surface, are motes of light, like a mist of sorts. It then takes shape - the form of a unicorn, standing motionless in the lake. Then we spot another, this one real, looking at the apparition.

Oswen calls across to the real one, "I'm so sorry for your loss. If we find anything, anything at all, we'll let you know."

Lamorna answers - in our minds. "What is your intention here? How have you come to be on Thither?"

We give our short version, from Feyrun to here.

"You have already defeated one of the Hourglass Coven? The hag of the now, the present? Can it be?"

We show what we can. We show the thread of despair too - we're told to throw it into the lake. That removes all curses! We do so; the thread, once removed, has changed colour to a bright, happy yellow. "Thank you!" says Oswen. "We didn't really know what to do about that, other than stop others having it."

"If you intend to help, I can tell you what I know. Will you stay with me for the evening?"

"This looks like a good place to camp. We'll stay."

"You are not cold, I hope? For no fire will light except within the beacon. If you are cold, I can conjure some blankets!"

"Thank you. We can manage."

She explains...

* Prismeer once belonged to the Archfey Zybilna until usurped by her **very cruel hag step-sisters** who had always lived in her shadow.

* Zybilna was the favoured of Baba Yaga, though not Baba Yaga's own. The hags always envied her, never included her in their games and always plotted her downfall.

* Zybilna wasn't perfect! She was vainglorious and could be deceitful at times, but her powerful magic kept Prismeer safe and isolated.

The area around the unicorn starts to lose colour, as she becomes more sad. Even the dusk birdsong turns to a minor key.

* This whole balance ended when **the Hourglass Coven captured Elidon (her mate)**, stole her horn and used its magic to imprison Zybilna in the Palace Of Hearts Desire.

* The horn might free Zybilna but she doesn't know where Elidon or the horn are. She's sure though that Elidon is still alive - a prisoner - definitely not dead. That's something!

* A unicorn's horn *can* be put back, so if we find both, we can restore Elidon properly.

For the evening - performance checks as we play to try and lighten the mood, Bel helping Inafina dance, as the night sky lights up in a display of auroras and milky stars, reflecting on the lake; dirty 20; we sense we are in a truly magical and beautiful place. We've not been somewhere like this in a long time.

**This might be the most beautiful place we've ever seen.**

Oswen is reminded that when all was right in the Fey, this is how beautiful it can be, but even by that standard this is amazing. Lamorna over time shares more.

* "If we are ever in need of rest and recovery, come here to me. It will cure you of exhaustion; as you know, it will free you of burdens and curses; it will heal. That is the nature of this magic." As long as she lives, she will protect it. "Even from the Jabberwork!"

* Jabberwock - a dragon-like creature that lives in Zybilna's palace but now that the palace is frozen, it prowls freely. It can move between the realms easily. It flies, and it must not set eyes on you as it "rarely gives up the hunt easily!" - it is fearsome; one of Zybilna's greatest feats to befriend it.

* A ward stops people entering the Palace without invitation. It is *probably* still up. The Houglass Coven is unlikely to be capable of usurping or redirecting that magic.

* On the second floor of the palace is a grand library! "I have been there before, the one time I was invited to go, Elidon and I. There was a ball. I got to wander around the palace. Quite beautiful."

* "You will be safe here. I am going to go and spend time with my thoughts."

We thank her (and warn her of the orc!)

She walks out into the lake, towards another apparition of Elidon, and they walk deeper into the mist rising over the lake until out of sight.

Kindle says, "I wonder if I'll ever have that."

Oswen thinks and says, "You can meet special people when you least expect it."

"For now, I have to protect the family I have!"; a change of mood; "Hmm... Now... I'm afraid, without fire, I can't make much of a dinner."

"That's OK!" - Oswen forages around, 19 survival; Bel helps, we find lots of edible mushrooms, flowers and a lot of fruit, including a tree of golden apples that taste of popcorn (!).

We get to talking about spells. Bel shares what his new magical lute-of-sorts can do. He can cast once a day - Entangle, Faerie Fire, Fly, Invisibility, Levitate, Protection From Evil & Good, and Speak With Animals. That last one is of particular of interest to Oswen ("I always wanted to be able to do that!"). We take the unicorn's word for it; this place is safe; we're tired and do not take watch.



## Day 8

(Oswen swaps out Fog Cloud and brings in Chromatic Orb).

The first signs of dawn are showing. Dragonflies buzz around, having just woken up. We need to decide; what next? We decide to stick with the plan of Little Oak. We pack up and decide first to check on Zarak; it's 1000ft or more, not too far. We're sure we get to the right place (despite no footprints) due to Pass Without A Trace. All we find are two bits of rope! He's escaped. Bel picks up the two bits of rope, just in case they come in handy.

We head north. The shorter route brings us close to the lake again, so Orvil is kept in the fey. Once we're far enough away, she brings Orvil back and brings him up to speed with all the things that happened.

We reach a spur of the river. Little Oak was we were told on the North bank, so we must cross. Oswen looks for a possible crossing point. Survival 15, she finds nothing for some time; but does find a place we can ford - except Oswen is a bit too short! The ford is right next to a faerie ring. These are meant to be corrupted, so Oswen spends 10 minutes on Detect Magic to see if she can see anything strange.

D8->8. It's about 20ft in diameter with very colourful 6in tall toadstools within the thick forest canopy. There is a strong Conjuration aura. Oswen realises that we've discovered a faerie ring that has been, well, sequestered; hidden. An illusion magic / enchantment around seems to have protected it. This one would work normally! She looks closer. There are signs of habitation around the area. She sees mushrooms pop their heads around from surrounding bushes and trees - then they wander up, singing. Campestris! They have decided we're not a threat and sing - it's a bit cacophonous but they're very cute. They seem to use body language to try and get us to join in.

Why not! ADV performance:

* Oswen 6,9+0 -> 9
* Infina 11,14+4 -> 18
* Kindle 11
* Bel nat 20 -> 26

Oswen and Kindle try their best but it's not great! The two performers of our group, however, get a bit of a twinkle in their eye - an *actual* twinkle - as they dance. **It turns out later that they both have True Seeing for 24h. They can see invisible things, things hidden by magic or illusion (120ft), can see into Ethereal Plane and can see in all kinds of darkness.**

The Campestri want to sing songs. They ask us to teach them a new song again. Oswen asks Bel to sing a song about *the orc whose thoughts were a transparent as a pool of water*. Bel does a decent enough job, despite having to make up the lyrics on the fly! They learn the song and seem delighted - they bestow a Charm that teaches the characters what hand actions they need to do to activate the Faerie Ring. So now we know how to use this, but we don't know where it goes or how to open the other end. It's a start!

The Campestri wander off singing their new song.

We cross the lake, Kindle carrying Oswen. Oswen thinks we must be close and suggests Inafina listen carefully... Survival ADV Inafina, 20+3->23. She's sure she knows the way - but before we get there she suddenly stops us. "Wait!"

Up ahead there's a small clearing, about 60ft away. Around the clearing is a pack of Blink Dogs. Inafina and Kindle both notice (passive perception) that there are 5, gathered around a crudely dug hole; each dog is heading up and placing something in the hole. They look solemn. They think something or someone important must've died. Then they howl; a dirge; then they turn and dig to push soil back into the hole. Then they sit, together.

Oswen approaches and opens with, "I hope we're not intruding" in Sylvan. They understand but can't speak back. They start sniffing around at Oswen's helm; she puts it on, points at one of the dogs and tries Detect Thoughts. The dog allows it. She can speak with it now. Once again - sorry for your loss.

They knew we were watching and appreciated that we didn't interrupt the burial of one of their pack, slain while scouting around Loomlurch and surrounding area. They warn us to be *very* careful in that area. There's a goblin market that sells all kinds of candy treats, which is why they were there; *but they also noticed clockwork sparrows flying out of the Northernmost Tower* - the tree that fell has been down for so long that three trees have grown up vertically out of it, forming towers. The Northernmost is covered in brambles and hard to reach, but that's where the "wicked witch" lives. *The sparrows fly in two directions* (Oswen figures - to the other two sisters). Things were going OK but one of the young pack went near the garden, where a lot of herbs and mushrooms are grown - intrigued by the smell - but the **scarecrows there screamed an alert** which gave the pack away. The pack alpha stayed behind to engage the **red caps and tin soldiers** that then attacked, letting the rest of the pack escape. They snuck back when everyone else had gone to bed to retrieve the body.

"He was a *very* brave alpha" agrees Oswen. "That's very sad. We hope to defeat this witch, and any information - including your story of clockwork sparrows and scarecrows - is helpful."

They wish us good luck; we continue on our way, mostly following the river on the Northern side. Within half an hour, we see it - on the Northern shore of an East-West river section stands Little Oak. A little path is nearby; some sandals and shoes are drying in the sun, along with some clothes. There are some berry smudges and apple cores nearby, along with wet footprints that head into the path. We can see sunlight from a clearing there - it seems tempting to investigate... Soon we overhear voices that seem to be arguing about a game of what sounds a bit like hide-and-seek. Then, "You're it!"; so, tag.

We get close and are surprised to see a 120ft fall Treeant, with a huge crown, watching down near its "feet" as four beings run around playing games. Oswen perception 19+1->20, Infina 13+5->18. Oswen, who is in fact still being carried on Kindle's shoulders, sees painted swings dangling from the (oak) Treeant's branches. There are ladders and footholds all over and, perched at the top, some kind of ramshackle - yet glorious! - tree house. It seems to have two levels, balconies and outdoor space... Someone even built a little turret.

OK, so this is a strange thing to call a town or a village but it's certainly self-contained!

The four in the clearing are children, plus a small purple - cat? - of some kind. There's a male dwarf, a female wood-elf with ginger hair, a larger female orc with purplish-green skin and dark skinned human with an afro. He looks *exactly* like Will Of The Fey Wild. All seem to be between 8-9 years old.

Oswen's heart leaps. She looks closely. The cat - it's a displacer beast kitten.

The children are startled by our appearance. The displacer beast kitten starts to phase in leaps towards the tree. Three of the children run for ladders, too, but Will stays behind.

Inafina meanwhile sees the treehouse, kitten and three children running to the tree - but also sees an 8ft tall or so strange, humanoid, brown and red skinned creature, painted eyes, dreadlocks, horns, standing in the clearing with hands on hips. It's calling out to our group, standing our ground. Inafina from any of Arcana, Nature or Religion only gets 11 so she doesn't recognise what she's seeing. Kindle, on the other hand, gasps. "Why is there an **Oni** over there?!" he exclaims.

Oswen looks where Kindle points and sees Will. "What? Will is an - what did you say, Oni?"

Inafina and Kindle look confused. Bel looks over even more confused. Oswen, insight nat 20 + 1 - she figures out that Inafina and Kindle are seeing diffe - wait a minute! True Sight from the Campestri! She says to Bel, "Of course! The campestri! The two of them can see things how they really are. So that means - hello, Will, I'm Oswen..."

...but Will interrupts telling us to stop where we are, the children are under his protection etc.; he's always striking dramatic poses. It's a bit Disney old-cartoon Peter Pan...

...and Oswen carries on, "We're here to try and fix things. To free Zybilna and stop Granny Nightshade. We were looking for you!" - but even with Bel helping, she's not at her best! Perhaps she should get down off Kindle's shoulders. (ADV Persuasion 4,7+0) Oswen gets down and sees Kindle and Inafina are not trusting what's in front of us so she says to *them*, "I see Will, from his poster. You see something else. What's an Oni?"

Will's eyes widen as he hears that. His demeanour changes - "No! Not here. We can't talk about this here; if you do I will have to take drastic measures!"

Oswen says, "Look, I know I'm not good at convincing people sometimes and you shouldn't just trust us with all the horrible things going on here, but I don't want put you at risk. Is there somewhere safe for you that we could talk?"

"I can't leave the children. I just can't. Is there another way for us to talk, at all?"

Oswen pulls out the Helm. She says, "You'll know a spell is happening - if you trust me, let it through" and uses Detect Thoughts. He deliberately lets it through... ...a sudden flash of history, conversation, memories.

* He's adopted the name Will Of The Fey Wild
* His real name is **Mugan**
* He used to work for Scabatha - he was the primary kidnapper of children!
* The hag's two sisters decided to mess with Scabatha and placed a curse on him, to make him bad at his job
* This manifested by *warming his heart* which changed him from Lawful Evil to Chaotic Good
* He realised what he'd been doing and ended up helping kids escape instead of kidnapping them
* His redemption is that he is resolved to rescue all the enslaved children
* He is sure that Scabatha doesn't know what has happened as none of the posters indicate he's anything other than a child

Oswen thinks back - "I don't mean to be insensitive but does that not mean, were the magic to fail or curse to be lifted, you would go back to kidnapping?" "Yes! But who would do such an evil thing?" He likes who he is now.

Hmm. Much to consider. Oswen can't tell the other three what's going on until she figures out how to do it safely, but assures them we're safe. **Will's big worry is that the children find out who he was and then fear him - that would break his heart. He cares deeply for them now.**

He asks what our plans are, what we intend to do and so-on. Oswen shares everything through her own memories. He invites us to the treehouse. Oswen asks the oak in Sylvan if it's OK for Kindle to come up? The oak laughs - he can carry much more than a Bugbear!

Lianas lower down; we grab on are conveyed up.

On the lower floor of the treehouse, the ground is covered in blankets, cushions and piles of straw. Hanging from one end is a rope net, onto which baskets of food are hung. Crumpled up sheets of parchment - wanted posters! - are discarded in a cushion. In another corner is a strange, rusty oil can, that looks out of place... But then it sits up and starts to squeak - "Will! We have guests! Who are the guests?"

Two clumps of polka-dot quilts have been crudely sewn together with a wooden horse's head and a horn attached to one; the other has a fabric head and fabric horn. Oswen first introduces herself to the oil can (!) - "I'm squirt!" "Nice to meet you" "I feel a bit empty, inside... Hollow... Like I'm all drained out..." - but he needs filling with lubrication oil, not lamp oil.

* The dwarf is **Bobi**
* The orc is **Zennor**, bigger than the rest but about the same age
* The wood elf is **Sloan** - but didn't want to give her name away; Will did that for her...!

She made the unicorn costumes. "We've figured out the secret to getting to Wayward Pool..." - ah yes, hide inside the costumes! Zennor figured it out. They're going to fill jars with lake water and it will help heal and cure ailments and diseases. When they rescue the other kids, they think they will need that kid of help. At least Will is definitely aware now that the lake water is something *he* should avoid!

Will now wants to tell us all about his plan, announcing that we're here to help!

We are taken up to the second floor. He pulls back a moth-eaten cloth; a blackboard below has scrawling chalk plans on it. He talks very enthusiastically about this plan!

Oswen, history 21, thinking about strategies she's read in the library; it's kinda basic, it would work, maybe, but just about as well as anything else ad-hoc. But without knowing more about what Granny Nightshade can do, and her ability to see what's going on in that "tree", we can't be sure any distractions or decoys would work. He talks about using the scarecrows that scream; that's true; the goblin market is run by a head goblin with a toffee apple for a head (!) called **Chucklehead**, we are told. There's an area in the garden to avoid where Red Caps grow. And of course there are the clockwork sparrows...

Squirt reminds us of the boggles. They stay with the children; they harass and tease. Bel reminds us that these manifest when humans are lonely. Squirt wants a boggle or two to be captured, so that we can get their boggle oil! That's what Squirt needs.

Oswen enquires as tactfully as she can about how the children got captured. Some were taken when playing near their homes - not even in Prismeer, other domains (confirming what we heard before). Others were lured in, accidentally going into crossings - Oswen accidentally crossed over herself and that's a bit too close for comfort! Bobi was at the Witchlight Carnival...! Bobi followed a girl wearing a pig's mask. "Ah! That's Sowfoot. She's no good! Sent by the hags."

Loomlurch is to the South-West, we're told. They know the way of course.

We talk about the displacer beast kitten - Star. Oswen ADV persuasion, 19,20+0. The displacer beast perks up at the name. Will thinks of the kitten as his pup and is not too happy! But we know the pup - Kindle and Inafina know Star directly. They explain how Star went missing and how distraught Dirlagaun has been. Will relents; he asks Star if he wants to go back? He does want to help rescue the kids but rescues his mum and while he's had a great time here - yes, he'd like to return. Turns out to be quite a conversant cub!

Will wants something in return for giving up "his" cub. Oswen digs around and suggests the sun/moon marionette - but when she produces it, Kindle gasps; now he gets a good look. "Does that look like gleam and glister to you?" he says to Inafina. They were a pair of twin sisters who used to work at the Witchlight Carnival, but they went missing... Everyone assumed they just left the carnival. So that, in addition to Gleam losing her shadow? Bad luck.

Will likes the story. He's sure the effigy is not magical, so it's not *them* trapped in this form. It's just a marionette. But it means Bavlorna must've had something to do with their disappearance; Oswen voices that but Will disagrees. "Look, it's a marionette" - he pulls on strings and makes it dance. "This is not one of Bavlorna's. And it's not one of Scabatha's... This must belong to Endelyn. She runs a macabre theatre." Squirt says he's been there! He sneaks over now and then to watch one of her horrific shows! "Just - y'know - life experience" he says!

**Ah! Oswen strikes a deal - if we get the oil, Squirt will show us the path he uses to get from here to Thither to Yon.**

Oswen suggests that the four of us go to scout out the big tree, but Will and the kids already know all about it. Tin soldiers patrol in 2s and 3s. 12 in total. They've never really seen the sparrows; they know there's a room in the tower that they always return to, then fly off in one of two directions. So maybe they *are* just communication to the other sisters, and not spies.

* The goblin market is directly in front of the workshop - or you can access the workshop via the garden, but that's got the scarecrows.
* **Chucklehead** is - the kids think - not bad; so not necessarily aligned with Scabatha. But who are the people who buy at the market? Residents! Residents of Thither! Bizarre. "It has the best candy!" is the only explanation we're given, and it's stated as if it's such an obvious thing that it should have no further question raised.
* But the candy *is made by the kids* so the market would probably *not* let us take the kids! 
* Scabatha spends 2-3 hours a day in the mornings tending to her gardens
* Sometimes she will sit in a parlour, near one of a couple of bridges formed by roots that cross a chasm with tiny stream; the top of the tree lies over that too, with three towers
* The first is next to the workshop. There's a sewing room near there, with a huge balcony that normally has a couple of guards...
* ...but that's where **Pincushion** tends to be - an "awful, awful" living doll that's very mean to the kids - basically the foreperson of the sewing room.
* Pincushion has a *prancing carpet* as a sidekick / lieutenant that *smothers the kids* if they don't behave.
* Pincushion has a big set of keys that unlocks many things. Scabatha has keys too, that they think unlock every door in Loomlurch.
* Dormitories are upstairs in that same first tower. The kids sleep overnight - they don't work in shifts.
* That balcony has a small stairway leading down to the garden - but it's always patrolled, at least two tin soldiers.
* The tin soldiers sleep when not on shift, in a room at the bottom of the dormitory tower; this stops the kids from ever sneaking out.
* During the day, kids are in the workshop, sewing room, the textile mill or being forced to work in the kitchen. None of them are ever allowed into the garden.
* **If we wanted to *meet* Granny Nightshade** we should talk to Chucklehead.

Sloan seems to be eyeing people up and wants to say something but then decides against it. Oswen says, "I think I know the thoughts of tactician when I see them - you're too clever to keep quiet, so speak up!"

Sloan speaks. "Chucklehead has had a change of demeanour in the last few months. He's become very protective of **Mishka**, one of the kidnapped children; he really cares for her and wants to help her get away from Loomlurch - but he's too scared of Granny Nightshade."

More than we could have hoped for - **a possible ally on the inside.**

Will wants the children to stay... Forever! They don't get older. Bobi says she's been here about 60 years! We say that's OK, but they should be given a choice. Will agrees. 

Wow. 60 years. Granny Nightshade has been kidnapping people for a *long* time. That's awful.

We're keen to scout out the place. Bobi is keen to help. And - well technically she's older than the rest of us! He says we're welcome to rest here, if we want; we figure scouting after dark would be good. We ask roughly how long it takes to get to Loomlurch from here? Will thinks about 3 hours.

Then there's the issue of Granny Nightshade forgetting who she sees when she wakes up. We have some flight ability, some PWAT and after discussion figure it might be useful for a spellcaster - Oswen or Bel - as it seems more disorientating to have spells just "happen" with no apparent source, at some distance away. We can fly three people - Oswen can give the wings to anyone, but we don't know they'll lift Kindle!

Kindle mentions another option; he's a healer. If he could move around the room without needing to attack, so he could react to defend, move freely to heal; he can call on Yondala's holy ladle (!) to attack her, and basically *be* a sort of guardian angel, unseen by Scabatha, who'll think she should be taking us down, but won't understand why we're not falling. That might throw her off, cause her to choose her targets unwisely, unaware of the hidden healer.

The list of people who want to come along is growing!

* Bobi
* Star (!)
* Will
* Sloan
* Zennor wants to stay to keep guard on Little Oak
* Squirt will keep her company

Almost as an afterthought - they forgot to say sooner! - they proudly say, "...and we're the **Getaway Gang!**". Kindle looks enquiringly at Oswen and Oswen says, "I - I don't think - *we* don't really need a - like a group name... Do we?!" - Oswen suspects that Kindle might not be able to let that go.



### 850XP and it's 2pm

We ask how long it takes to get to Loomlurch from here. Apparently, it's usually about 3 hours - assuming no interruptions along the way.

We don't have a plan, other than - if it comes to a fight - wanting Kindle to be seen by Scabatha when she wakes up that morning. First thing's first, just go and see it. It's more of a reconnaissance thing, we're not expecting to be very visible; Will was worried we might be jeopardising his plan. We're not trying to do that at all - we're trying to understand it and refine it. Can any of the extended group help us as a guide to get there? Will instructs Bobi to help.

Sloan brings us to the edge of Loomlurch. Bobi, Will and Star have stayed behind and will only come with us if we're actioning his plan.

We're at the North-Eastern edge of Loomlurch, closest to the third tower where Scabatha sleeps. Orvil is sent ahead to fly up high at the top of that tower, to see if he can see which windows might be for the sparrows, and which - if any - might be for the bedroom in which Scabatha sleeps. Perception 15. He can see that there are a few windows at a particular level which are clear; one or two lower down are covered in ivy. The only window he can see that is accessible would be high up. He spots a balcony outside one of them, the side facing us, with a door. That might well be it. He sees two windows on opposing sides; then a bulge on the opposite side to the balcony, another room perhaps, itself with windows. At least the balcony and door provides a possible way to get in.

We don't know much about the middle tower which we can see, now, but obviously only the outside. Apparently, that contains a loom! The kitchen is in between the dormitory and loom tower. The outside of tower 2 is covered in tangled brambles and roses. Tower 1 has more vines and ivy.

Oswen asks Orvil if he wants to risk something - he does! - and fly at a distance, out along the length of the tree and wide around tower 1, looking for tin soldiers. Stealth 18, while he does this; he notices **no other bids**. He confirms Will's story.

* Goblins including Chucklehead visible in the market
* Some visitors appear to be present
* The two tin soldiers on the balcony of tower 1
* He sees the garden and the tower 1 stairs leading down
* Scarecrows in the garden - he counts 5
* North of the garden and stairs is a strange, large pumpkin patch

On the way back, on the other side of the giant log, around about level with tower 2 but off to the side, is a circle with 8 strange tall pointy-capped mushroom-like things. Red on top. When he describes this to Oswen later, she hypothesises that maybe this is where the Red Caps grow?

We realise that we can't just waltz into the market and ask questions. There's a chance Granny Nightshade has had a description of us by now, after what happened in Hither, and we can't risk it. We'd be recognised immediately. Maybe our plan is to have one or two of us disguised and the others lie in wait; we figure we might as well bed down, and try to sleep early, then wake early and get Kindle into Granny Nightshade's room so she'll forget him for a day. Sloan should head back to warn Will that we think we'll do whatever we're going to do tomorrow and once we've got Kindle "forgotten" we'll return to Little Oak to coordinate.

Kindle and Inafina will lie low. Bel will disguise himself and make Oswen invisible. Those two will try to talk to Chucklehead. If anything goes wrong, Orvil will be sent to alert Kindle and Inafina, else he'll be hidden in the Fey (Bel might also be able to cast Message instead). Due to access concerns for getting help, we decide to all head around to the South edge where people normally arrive so that Bel and hidden Oswen can walk in over the bridge to the market, in the expected fashion.

Sloan shows us how to cross the river. We get over some distance away from Loomlurch but are soon enough back at the bridges; Kindle and Inafina hide. Sloan meanwhile heads back to Will so she's not at risk of being discovered here. She wants to get home in time for dinner, too!

The tree, up close, is really just *huge*. The trunk must've been at least 50ft across!

We get into the market, Oswen shadowing Bel. There are three large tents with a couple of stalls in each, all selling candy. Candles and firelight from windows carved into the giant fallen tree are all the illumination that there seems to be needed. There are two goblins at each tent. Two other guests are here, so that helps keep a bit of attention off us; a dark purple-skinned gnome is browsing and an half-elf or perhaps full elf, with green skin, is looking more closely at a particular stall., They don't seem to be together

Chucklehead is mumbling to himself. As we approach, one of the stallholders calls out to us. "Candy treats! Candy treats! The best candy treats - magical. They only cost a trinket each. Try your luck and see what you get! All effects are guaranteed to be very fun regardless of what they do."

The gnome buys a candy and tries it. He's chewing away, and his head starts to swell until it's twice the width it was before; it seems heavy and he has to hold it in hands. Oswen isn't sure that looks very fun at all! The gnome loses his balance, falls over and sits, holding his head. The goblin says the effect will "probably" only last an hour. The gnome declines an offer to "pay" another trinket for more "fun"!

The elf pulls out a piece of candy from a bowl, at random. It is purple and orange with stripes and what seem to be propellers at either end. He chews on it; holds his head as if worried it will also grow; but then exclaims that nothing seems to have happened. The goblins say it might take a while to manifest... So the elf shrugs and turns to walk away, but as he walks, each step he takes is noisy, like a xylophone. The gnome seems to prefer that idea to having a large head!

Chucklehead looks at the stall not serving anyone, that tries to get us involved. Oswen wouldn't touch it, but Bel might be tempted... But (WIS save) thinks better of it. "I've heard of this place, I thought I'd just come and see what all the fuss is about! I think I'm fine - I like my head the size that it is and don't think I want to draw any wild animals towards me...!"

Oswen sidles up close to Chucklehead while this is going on and whispers loudly, while invisible, "Psst! Don't be alarmed! I'm invisible! We wanted to talk to you about Mishka..." Persuasion 14+0. "But you don't sound like Mishka!" Oswen says, "No, we want to help! I'm not Mishka. We heard about her from mutual friends." "Worm? Worm is that you? Why do you sound different?" He starts tapping his head. Oswen figures out there must be a worm in the apple that talks to him sometimes. "My name is Oswen, I'm not the worm, I'm just temporarily magically invisible and stood quite close to you!"

Now he understands. "You say things that remind me of the worm" Oswen says back, "Well, I hope the worm is a friend of ours and less of a friend of Granny Nightshade! Is there any where we can talk safely?" "Yes! Over there in the woods! Give me a moment..." - then he loudly announces, "Oh my! Suddenly I have to pee so bad!" so Oswen scuttles to Bel and whispers, "FOLLOW HIM!" "What?" "Follow Chucklhead! He's going to talk to us."

Oswen ADV stealth 20+2->2 but Bel looks *very* dodgy kinda following Chucklehead ostensibly going to the bathroom. Oh well! He tries deception (17) - "There may be spiders over there! I'll come and protect you".

* Mishka treated him kindly after the worm appeared
* Oswen (Medicine 16) realises the worm is eating his head slowly on the inside! Yikes!
* His demeanour changed then; he claims the worm "tells him" not to do bad things; but the worm probably doesn't talk, he's just slowly changing as the worm eats away - rather horrific, really.
* Oswen wonders if we could ever get the worm out before things get any worse. But he probably quietly knows his days are numbered.

We talk - in somewhat abstract terms - about a plan to act tomorrow. If there was a commotion, could he help? Well, he could hide children in barrels and carts to help get them out! The biggest issue is the Red Caps (and confirms that they're growing in the patch Oswen thought was the growing grounds). He once witnessed candy being offered to Red Cap, who accepted it but then needed to reciprocate with a gift, but didn't have one - **and got so mad his head exploded!**

**So if we offer the Red Caps gifts and insist they take them, that could be the key.**

We know candy works, so we decide not to risk more than that and decide to exchange trinkets for candy. Bel has two. Oswen has - hmm, her bag of sand, the salt shaker shaped like a wizard's tower and a bar of soap that smells like childhood, recovered back from Agdon. That would give us five pieces of candy! Quite the haul. So it's decided - Chucklehead will keep his eyes out for commotion tomorrow, probably more likely later in the day, and enact his plan for squirrelling children away - particularly Mishka. We'll have Red Cap defences to hand and will be dealing, somehow, with Granny Nightshade. It's probably just going to be a sort of "storm the castle" affair.

We ask if there's a time when Granny Nightshade is in her parlour. It seems as a good a place as any to tackle her; he says only if she has guests. So we could have Chucklehead introduce us to Granny Nightshade in that room, but then we're not available to free the other children. OK - so - in that case, we have to run in and try to free the children, and tackle Granny Nightshade wherever? Will's plan, basically. Lots of locations to try and reach to free them. The scarecrows might be used, in fact, to be even more of a distraction.

If we're going to attack Scabatha, then we're not really helping free the kids and so he's less on board. We could argue that if we just kill her, the kids might be freed easily.

It comes down to trying to help Will and co storm the tree, but we need to scope out Scabatha's movements so we have some idea of where she's going to be. We want to get her drawn to us. She spends the mornings in the garden, tends to spend the mid-afternoon yelling at kids in the kitchen, then goes to the workshop and yells at kids there for not making enough kids. By about 8pm the kids are in the dorms (unless any of them are being punished) and Scabatha goes to her tower. "The light are out in her tower by 9" says Chucklehead.

Oh, what time does she get up?! He doesn't know! But she's usually in the garden by the time he gets to work, at 8am. We figure we'll have to be up early to get Kindle into that room in time for her waking. He normally *leaves* when the lights go out and the pack up the market - around 9pm.

A beginning of plan. After dark all the guards are below or around the dormitory so that's not great. Instead:

* Silence the scarecrows and enter via the garden
* Take out the two balcony guards by surprise, since we're coming in from behind
* Get kids from there out via the market to be hidden by Chucklehead
* Tear through the rest of it
* Encounter Granny Nightshade somewhere!

As we head back to the market, we see a couple of tin soldiers on patrol. "How often do they go around?" whispers Oswen. "Half an hour to do a full loop."

Back that the market, all the trinkets -> 5 candies to detonate Red Caps!

We head out and connect back with Inafina and Kindle, everyone catches up and now we start to head back around, to the Northern end via the river, intending to sleep early, lie low, do watches and keep an eye on Granny's movements and soldier movements and get Kindle in there in the morning.

From the North, perception all round, listening (ADV Inafina):

* Inafina - 3,8+5->13
* Oswen - 1 then 7+1->8
* Bel -> 3
* Kindle -> 20

At least *someone* hears it! He cringes. "Can't you hear that?!" he asks. "No!" "Listen! Listen!" - he draws our attention to things we really can't hear, except Inafina that *almost* hears it. A scratchy, old, crone voice, yelling and scolding! That'll be Granny Nightshade, who surprisingly, we've still not set eyes on yet - but we do now have ears.

Lights go out in the workshop, and on in the dorms on the level above. Sun is down. Not long now...

...From behind Loomlurch, relative to our Northern edge position, a rocking horse flies out into the night sky, Granny Nightshade sat upon it, all in silhouette against the mood. She's flying West, towards the mist. We wonder if she's headed to Hither or the Palace, except that's more to the North, so perhaps Hither. If she doesn't know what happened there... Yikes, that might change her mood when she gets back! We have to hope Chucklehead was right and she'll be back by 9.

Kindle is philosophical. "If she's away, maybe we run in *now* and free all the kids?"

It's not even a bad idea! But there are too many guards now the kids are in the dorms, and none of the Little Oak people to help. It'd catch Chucklehead by surprise too! So we sit and hang tight.

An hour and a half later, at what we guess is around 9pm, we are relieved to just about be able to make out the rocking horse flying back in. A few minutes later, the light in the kitchen goes off; a lantern light goes up in the third tower; lights on at the top. We take that as our cue to bed down and set watch. We need to get up early tomorrow.

On first watch, Oswen with help from Orvil - after about 10 minutes the tower light is off, but there's still a soft glow - a candle nightlight, perhaps.

* Perception ADV 20+1->21. She realises the glow is a flickering light - ah - fireflies, in a jar. So *that's* the nightlight.
* Bel - also nat 20+1->21. Nothing unusual!
* Inafina - 13+5->18. Uneventful.
* Kindle - 19+4->23. 

Kindle detects a slight lightening of the sky towards the horizon. We probably have to get him into the tower. **It's almost dawn**.
