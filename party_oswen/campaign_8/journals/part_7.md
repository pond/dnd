# Oswen: Part 1.7
## Day 9, around 6am
### Northern edge of Loomlurch

We get close to the Northern-most tower. Kindle is going to Fly up thanks to a spell from Bel but Scabatha might not wake up for a while so he may have to climb down; and the door might be locked. Inafina will go up with him using her wing boots, borrowing the lock pick kit; she can tie a rope on the balcony for Kindle to come down on, then untie it and fly down after him, hopefully leaving no trace; we'll use a second sycamore seed, too, to help them stay hidden.

Up Kindle goes! Inafina is a bit unsteady on her boots at first, having not had the chance to practice, but soon gets the hang of it. Stealth:

* Inafina 19+6+10 -> 35
* Kindle 19+3+10 -> 32

Wow. They get to the balcony. It's about 20ft up. We have 35ft left on the rope, so it's plenty. Inafina has to stay hidden, so stays on the balcony and has the rope tied and ready to go, but has it tied so she can pull on the end at the top to untie it quickly. Oswen periodically "pings" Kindle with Message to check it's all OK; Inafina can go in if needed. Next, Inafina checks the door - not locked! It opens. Kindle creeps inside. But after a minute he comes out and shakes his head. Oswen perception 16 does seem him come out, uses Message; he says there's nobody there; a bed, but no Granny Nightshade.

Inafina whispers to Kindle, "did you see the nightlight or anything like that?" - he did see the jar of fireflies. It's very confusing. We have to be sure; so he risks See Invisibility. Nope! Nobody inside, for sure. More risk... She goes in, thinking maybe there's the floor below that might be of interest. Inside on this top floor, perception 15, she sees the stairs going down; some kind of study, but it's pitch black. Then she notices the other door - "did you try that?" she asks Kindle. He hasn't, so he heads to that last little back section - it's not a balcony, it's just a small room. It's got a writing desk and a small chair. There are clockwork birds all over the walls. Kindle has a quick look at the letters, but then comes back out.

Could she be polymorphed, or teleported out? Is there another exit? Inafina creeps back in; she examines the bed; perception 20+5->25, quite quaint. There's a small cradle to the left and a table by the window with a doll's house on it. The jar of fireflies is on the windowsill. The bed itself is very well made, all tucked in - and has a thick layer dust. The cradle has some dust too, but the rest of the room does not. Trying to figure out used vs not used areas - survival 18+3. Footsteps go nowhere near the cradle or the bed; some go from stairs to balcony and all three of dressers arranged around the rooms, lots near the door to the writing room and, again, lots of steps and marks around the doll's house.

She motions to it, and Kindle has a good look. She's also thinking about the fireflies - the first living thing Scabatha sees she forgets. Those are living. So... Kindle looks, but can't see much. Inafina risks it. 20+5 again, two nat 20s! The lid is hinged, like a toy box, but there's no open back like a normal doll's house would have. Through the windows, it's *very* well done inside - very convincing... There's a strange aura of magic around this too. And in the bedroom - **she spots a tiny Granny Nightshade, sleeping in the bed with a sleep mask over her eyes and a night cap**. The bedroom window looks directly at the firelies.

She motions to Kindle and they get to the balcony. She explains in whispers. We need to hide the firefly jar somewhere - Kindle suggests hiding it *with his face* by positioning himself at the window! Oswen checks in again via Message and is updated in brief. Inafina resumes her position at the rope. It looks likely that we'll be beyond the 10 minutes of the Fly spell.

There's a sudden shout from inside! "Go go!" so Inafina doesn't wait. She pulls on the loose end of the rope and jumps down, running to the ground and heading across the river low. A moment later, Kindle leaps dramatically off the balcony. He's *nearly* at the hiding spot - when the fly spell finishes! He lands heavily in bushes with a crackle and thud, but he's OK!

"Right! So... That's very strange. She woke up, looked out and totally just didn't appear to see me at all. And then - she said '**Rumbleclump**' and the lid of the doll house sprung open. She jumped out and grew in size as she exited. She went to a dresser and picked up a gold false eye (!) which she put into place in her head, checked herself in a gaudy hand-mirror, put on some velvet slippers and then a dress. Then I ran out. She really didn't seem to notice me at all!"

Loud bells start to ring out. We figure a wake-up call, not an alarm. Lights come on. A while later, smoke comes out from the kitchen area. We can, in the long distance, hear and eventually see Granny Nightshade. Inafina can't resist it. "It's empty up there and everyone's focused on breakfast. I'm going to check the doll's house!"

She's a bit excited and in a bit of a rush - stealth 1+6+10->17; she's in. She is a bit more relaxed now, thinking it should stay empty here a while. The balcony door is still open. The cradle is unused but was once - and is painted with green dragons! There's not as much dust as the bed. She investigates the dressers just looking for anything interesting; 16-1->15; one has knickers, socks and bits of jewellery, but on top are 12 ornamental very well painted pigs, but the paint is beginning to fade and peel. They are very tidily arranged but again, dusty. In the next, lots of coats and dresses. No other ornaments though. The last dresser has many little draws - slippers, boots, shoes, and a small jewellery box with several false eyes. Inafina closes that quickly in case they can actually be magically seen through!

Kindle didn't get much out of the bird room. When she goes in, the birds are active, whirring and clicking. They turn to look at her. She's unnerved, but holds her ground - they're inside bird cages. The two windows have a beautiful cursive Yon on one, and Hither on the other. Three letters are on the desk. Helpfully and somewhat surprisingly they're in Common. They are all short. Two different handwriting styles; two in one style, one in the other.

Of the pair: "Sister. I don't have Elidon's horn! If I did, I would use it to free Bloodybeak and send it after the Jabberwock that lairs in the Palace. I don't care what Enedlyn says" - and it goes on to describe the Jabberwock as a dragon. This must be Bavlorna.

The next is Endelyn's - it is about the horn again - apparently Scabatha lost the horn. She has scried and says the horn will eventually be found.

The last talks again about the Jabberwork being free and "gives even me nightmares" - turning its "firey gaze upon the forest". **The horn can be used to free Zybilna from *her* (Zybilna's) cauldron's freeze spell. There's a mention of "knowing true names not being enough".**

* They still don't know where it is
* They fear someone else finding it
* Endelyn's scrying says *someone* will
* Scabatha despite her nighttime excursion yesterday may yet be unaware of what has happen in Hither. Perhaps last night she went elsewhere? Searching for the horn perhaps!

So someone, or something, must've taken the horn. Scabatha had it last. Scabatha clearly thinks one of the sisters took it, but they claim not. Bavlorna, at least, seems very serious about the Jabberwock and while we might very well have overlooked the horn when we were in Hither, it seems unlikely that she had it. Endelyn on the other hand might yet hold it still, and have her own designs on it (even though she insists to the contrary).

If the sisters do *not* have the horn - who does? Will? Scabatha did seem particularly interested in finding *him* via Wanted posters, over other children. Could just be selection bias on our part! But Will did have 'access' to the inside, when he was still in his Oni form. If that Malevolent League had it, then they wouldn't need to search for the pool; so it's *probably* not them.

Eventually, all else being searched; "Rumbleclump!" says Inafina. The lid of the doll's house clicks and unlocks. She lifts it open. It's a beautiful thing - some 3ft tall with 4 storeys including a roof attic but access is difficult as Inafina does not shrink. That must require extra magic.

Perception is *a third nat 20* (WTF) for 25. Only the bedroom and attic room seem actually used often. In the attic room, there are two boxes with arcane inscriptions on them, of which one is a small chest. She cautiously puts her hand in; nothing odd happens; she collects the two boxes and when withdrawn from the doll's house they remain small. But she might have triggered a ward or something; the runes on the boxes glow once they come out of the house. Perhaps the house has an anti-magic field (to protect Scabatha) but now these runes, whatever they are, have become active. She closes the roof carefully which clicks shut and seems to lock itself, then gets out, to show Oswen the strange boxes.

Back in the trees, Oswen looks; Arcana 8+8->16; these are command words that would increase the object size. She speaks the word so both boxes increase in size. One is just a cardboard box! We look inside that first. There are a number of items that have all been Transmuted, from someone else, once upon a time; the distinct impression is of things that were lost or stolen and have now been turned into manifestations of something else. Oswen guesses that if the person to which this originally belonged was given the item, it would restore itself to its owner. But knowing who owns what is difficult!

* A cloak of Many Fashions
* Eyes of Minute Seeing
* Wand of Smiles

Bel - given back his lock-picking tools - has a go at opening the chest. SOH dirty 20; it opens easily enough. He shows it to Oswen; Arcana 22.

* An Orb of Direction (again, transmuted)
* Some beautifully illustrated storybooks for children, with pop-up cardboard art (not transmuted)
* A beautiful necklace, which must be worth about 250gp; not magical; it is a delicate, feminine style; it has a few charms on it, one of which is a beautiful cursive "T" - rings no bells!

We discuss options and, to our surprise, at around 9:30-10am - earlier than we might have expected - Will turns up. Sloan had passed on the message and he's come here directly; it's not hard to find them and meet up (Orvil being on lookout in the trees). They're in neutral coloured clothes and have stuck leaves and twigs to themselves, two black lines painted under the eyes... It's not great but better than nothing *if* we were attacking a forest, not a workshop! They're all armed with slings.

Oswen asks Will about the necklace, with the "T". He's got no idea. We also ask about the unicorn horn - he *did* see one around "back in the day", but can't remember where or when he saw it last. He remembers one of the kids once taking the horn and going outside just to play with it and Granny Nightshade was enraged more than she ever had been before - she locked the poor child in a pen (their jail area) for a full week. Others had played with it and been caught before but she hadn't reacted that badly. But this child had taken the wand outside, into the garden; it was as if she was frightened of something.

"Perhaps the horn is easier for people to see, or magically detect, outside of the place she normally keeps it - maybe she was afraid it might be found."

Bobi pipes up - "Oh! Yes! I remember that; I was in the next room. 'Do you realise what you could have done? Do you know how bad things could have gotten?' she was shouting.

We check and they all remember it looking the same - it doesn't look different to different people, or at different times. It's "just" a unicorn horn (!) but has 'threads' on one end - like a screw thread. Maybe it can just be screwed right back in!

Sloan has once again been quiet for a while but then speaks up too. "I remember. I remember what happened - itw was Pud. Pud's the one. Pud told on **Pogo** - Pogo took the horn. You guys don't notice but *I* see it! Pud runs off and tells Granny Nightshade things, getting the other kids in trouble."

Oswen says, "So, all of you, this is important - if you go to rescue those kids, try to find Pud *first* and *stop* him - as he'll probably run off to try and warn her which could ruin everything if she gets there too early..." - and she explains our extension to the plan with Chucklehead and drawing Granny Nightshade to us.

Will's group get 3 candies for the Red Caps. We keep 2.

The day draws on. Will prefers to sneak around at midday (!) because he doesn't cast as many shadows! Easier to sneak around. We decide to wait a bit longer than that - Will remembers that she often spends a little time in her study, in the Northernmost tower, in the afternoon. This is a long way from the workshop and although close to the kitchen is about as far away from the largest number of children as we can easily get and leaves the bridges South unobserved except by guards.

In that case, using Silence on the Scarecrows is definitely the way forward and that means that our four doing that, creeping in and overpowering those two guards is what kicks all this off - with the balcony guards gone, our extended party can enter via the market and children can be exiting to be hidden by Chucklehead's crew, without interference. Chucklehead has to time things with the rotating patrols, of course.

### Midday ish

Will's group decides that they'll rescue from the workshop. The scarecrow distraction isn't needed if they're just doing that. We'll handle the kitchen, loom, "pen" etc. - and Scabatha, probably - so while Will's group would normally have to make their way wide around across the river, South and towards the bridges, we come in closer, near the pumpkin patch and Kindle starts a ritual to Silence the scarecrows. This will help Will and the kids (and ourselves) sneak past and not need to take such a wide route and can get there faster.

Oswen casts Mage Armour; it's on. We move in.

We hide behind trees near the scarecrows. The ritual is cast. Oswen approaches the pumpkin patch now the the scarecrows are silenced; the stairwell is behind the pumpkins. Perception 14. They're all different sizes, including some that are really very large and all seem to come out of one particularly thick vine near the end of the staircase. But she sees a low, wide balcony along by the garden, with a door mid-way. The scarecrows observe it - nobody else does. We decide to creep up... In between deep roots, hidden away at the edge of this balcony, Bel suddenly points out horrified at the flower bed nearby. A scull, a foot bone sticking out... In fact, under each vegetable patch or flower bed, appear to be bits of belongs and bones as if things have been buried to feed the plants! It's horrifying.

Kindle helps Oswen up onto the balcony, the others find it easy enough to climb on - it's only 4ft. Nearby in the garden, the other kids are picking some specific mushrooms, strangely, as they pass through. Sloan sees us and runs over! She hands Oswen one mushroom. A "Hummingbrella" - a frilly parasol-looking mushroom that apparently attracts hummingbirds; apparently it's good against poison! She runs back to the group who start to try and pick the lock of a side-door into the workshop. Our door is unlocked, which is probably not a good sign; she goes inside.

A scratch voice calls out "Dunderhead! Those tatty sleeves wouldn't serve as socks for a chicken! Start again!"

There are many workbenches and storage areas here - baskets, benches, shelves, cupboards... They're filled with all manner of supplies and equipment. There are two children here - a halfling boy and a fluffy bugbear. They're sewing things. Watching over them is the voice source - a child-sized doll with buttons for eyes, yelling away. It holds large sewing pins. Hovering behind is a *huge* rug, prancing about.

Well - we were told about *these* two!

Oswen calls back, "trouble!" and to the kids "you two, hide under the benches!"

Initiative rolls are not good:

* Orvil 21
* Bel 15
* Inafina 9 (with ADV from Kindle's usual blessing)
* Oswen 8
* Kindle 2

At least this is enough for Bel to act first. But as he runs into the room, he finds himself right up next to Pincusion and the carpet; too close for any ranged attacks. He draws his rapier. Pincushion with the big knitting needles is basically in his face, so he attacks and hits, for 8 damage.

Inafina gets in, leaps over Bel (Rabbit Hop) as she's startled, runs around the rug and jabs in her javelin for 11 damage. The rug goes for Inafina in response - it spins around and tries to smother her. It's a sort of grapple attack; it's close but she dodges it. Oswen sees this and throws Scorching Ray; two hit, for 18 fire damage. It burns and scorches the damage - but doesn't seem to do an undue amount of damage.

Pincushion shouts - "You! I was going to ask you why you're trespassing - but you're clearly trying to make total chaos! This is not OK!" - and she screams and hollers. "SOLDIERS! SOLDIERS! WE ARE UNDER ATTACK!" and we immediately start to hear distant sounds of boots thudding onto wood. We also see that where Bel had struck her, she's healed up a little; she sews herself up magically. She looks to Oswen; "YOU! You look like a child. Laugh with me!" - and starts to cackle. She's targeting Inafina too. WIS saves - 22 Oswen, 19 Inafina. It was some kind of effect similar to, but not the same as Hideous Laughter. Fortunately it had no effect. Enraged, the doll and grabs Bel (attack 21) - he's grappled - she has a strange evil look that seems to be trying to project fear into him. Then finally Kindle runs in, to see Bel grappled by Pincushion. He swings his mace. He just gets in a hit, for 5 damage.

Bel takes 2d10 psychic at the start of his turn - and it's a VERY high roll, 15! He only has 8hp left. He tries to wriggle free of the grapple; it works (ACRO 15) - he escapes - but he's too frightened (DM roll) and tries to run, but both get an opportunity attack as a result. By chance, he manages to dodge both. He ends up against the far wall next to Oswen. He gathers a bit of courage from that; uses a Bardic Inspiration; stands forward with his rapier a bit, and declares, "The courage of the summer court and Queen Titania upon us all!" - and we all gain 5 temp HP (Mantle Of Inspiration).

Inafina gets a really solid spear hit on the carpet - max damage, 12 - it catches a thread as the spear pulls out and totally unravels the rug! It collapses in a heap of thread. She runs up behind Pincussion to flank against Kindle; she tries to attack with advantage but 1,4+6 -> 10 => misses.

Oswen throws a fire Chromatic Orb at Pincussion. She has to use her inspiration from yesterday to get the hit, and 3d8->only 10, but some of the stitching catches fire at least.

Pincussion does *not* seem to manage to heal up this time - the fire is causing some trouble there. She cackles again, but this time can only target Bel and Kindle; Kindle is fine, and Bel, luckily, also resists the effects (WIS save nat 15 + 0). She yells at the door again, then tries to run for it. Kindle seizes the opportunity to try and attack as she flees, hitting for 8 damage; Inafina likewise gets a hit for 7 damage and Pincussion falls - but the fire is out. Oswen is concerned that Pincussion will rise up again.

Kindle runs up to the inner door and opens it, to see what's beyond. He sees two Tin Soldiers. He attacks one immediately! He has his sneak attack feature active for this, as the Tin Soldier has not yet had its turn. It misses! Drat - but he's able to cast Healing Word on Bel at least, for 7hp (Bel's at 15 plus 5 temp).

Bel tells the kids to run but they say they can't make it over the balcony. The bugbear runs up and says, "I'm Roff! Thank you? Here! Here... Use this!" and gives Bel a pouch. "I stole it from the store cupboard! Use it on the Tin Soldiers, they said!". It's **Dust of Corrosion**.

Bel runs next to kindle and throws the whole lot out of the doorway towards the two soldiers - "Kindle, watch out!" - both fail their saves; 4d8 necrotic equivalent - a very high 25 damage to each of them. They're not down, but very messed up. The closest Tin Soldier tries to hit Kindle to push him out of the way, hitting twice; Kindle takes 8 damage. The other is blocked by the first one in the way on the stairs. Inafina runs up, manages to get the spear in at an angle on the first - 5 damage only, but that's enough; it falls. She squeezes onto the stairs and attacks the second, heavily corroded guard; 17 to hit *misses*.

Oswen runs up to Pincussion, pours on some lamp oil and uses Prestidigtation to light it. Pincussion burns to ash. She shouts to the kids that if they can't reach the garden, they should follow us once it's safe and get to the market. One of the kids runs up and pulls out a ring of keys - of course, Pincussion was a keyholder! Oswen takes the gratefully.

Kindle calls down Sacred Flame. It works, but it only deals 1d8->1 damage! The soldier still stands. "Aww!" exclaims Kindle, disappointed. Bel can't get into the stairwell so runs back to look after the kids.

The tin soldier tries to attack Inafina, but misses twice. She tries to retaliate, this time with a couple of unarmed strikes; her first kick misses, but the second finds its mark for a minimum 1d4+4 -> 5 but that's enough.

We're in barracks! Yikes. 10 brightly painted little wooden houses line the walls, each with a 3ft high hinged door. A few are shut, a few are open. As she jumps down into the middle, she's stood next to a strange box with a crank handle, like a jack-in-the-box. Four doors open - she calls out, "Four more soldiers!"

Oswen runs in, just making it onto the stairs; she sees the soldiers. She's not sure if cold will work but does manage to hit one with a Ray Of Frost, and it seems to take an "expected" 5 damage.

One solider moves in to attack Inafina. One of two attacks lands for 6 damage - and then another moves in. Its second attack hits, 6 more damage.

Kindle runs in and gets into the mix. He uses Channel Divinity to create Twilight Sanctuary, which is the 1d6+4 rolled at the end of turns for temp HP. Kindle gains a maximum 10!

Bel runs out, telling the kids to flee! Kindle is protecting the path the door out to the workroom, so they run that way. Bel moves alongside to complete the row of protection. Now he casts Bane, meaning they need CHA saves with a -5 modifier! All fail. D4 penalties all round. He gets 7 temp HP from Kindle's sanctuary. But at this, another soldier comes forward, aiming for Bel. Thanks in part to Bane, it misses both times. The last of the four now moves, attacking Kindle; it too misses twice.

Inafina attacks one of the two closest to her, Flurry Of Blows involved; two hits out of three; 14 damage. It's looking beaten up but these things are hardy! She too then gains 7 temp HP.

Oswen casts Dragon's Breath - on Orvil! He is able to fly and position out of danger, but get 3 tin soldiers in a corrosive breath cone when he has the chance. Oswen then tries another ray of frost on the closest tin soldier; it hits, for another very low 1 point of damage. She gains 10 temp HP.

Kindle dodges both attacks by one tin soldier. Then the one Oswen just hit tries to run up and grab onto the stairs to get next to Oswen, which it manages to do (and Inafina's opportunity attack misses wildly). As he sees this, Kindle calls upon a Word Of Radiance; thanks to Bane, all of them take 5 damage.

Orvil flies to try and attack three soldiers in a cone. The 3d6 damage roll is horrendous; 1,1,4, only 6 damage. Two of them fail to dodge that but a third only takes half. Oswen has to hope she can keep the spell running to make it worth the cost, but now she has a Tin Solider about to attack her.

Bel gets attacked by a Tin Solider, too. Fortunately it misses twice thanks to the ongoing Bane spell. The last of the four can only reach Kindle; it does get in one hit; 6 damage, but that's within the auto-restoring temp HP.

Inafina gets one hit on a nearby solider for only 6 damage. The kids get out of the room and away.

Oswen tries to keep her spell up. She's got almost nothing for melee so disengages and jumps off the balcony! She uses her wings for the first time. They flutter into life and she gets into the middle of the room, near Orvil.

Inafina's under attack again. Thanks Bane it misses twice. The soldier that went for Oswen has to run down the stairs and ends up at the workshop door, behind Bel; it attacks, hitting once for 3 damage - CON save for Bane - the spell would fail, *but he uses his Inspiration* to try and keep it going; this *just* works.

Kindle tries his Radiance again. This time, even with Bane, one solider resists but the other two take 8 damage. One falls. One looks close to that. Kindle regains max temp HP too.

Orvil tries again with his corrosive breath. Only two targets this time. Another very low damage roll; 9 this time (just below 3d6 half). Another soldier falls; now one more looks pretty low. Bel has both next to him and he can tell that the one in towards the room, not the new arrival behind him, is more damaged. He tries with his rapier but it misses; he gets hit once in return, for 8 damage. That eats a little more into is "real" HP again too; but this time, Bane fails.

Inafina flanks the more damaged soldier with Kindle and gets in a kick for max 8 damage. That soldier falls. Inafina can't reach the one on the stairs. Oswen tries to get it with a ray of frost, but misses wildly; the soldier attacks Bel, but misses twice. Kindle spins around and casts Sacred Flame. It works but yet *again* only 1 point of damage!

Orvil gets a full hit of the breath on the remaining soldier, but even that's not enough - yet *again* a bad damage roll of just 9. Not enough.

Inafina tries to get in a hit. Nat 3 on an Acro check to get a better position; nat 3 on the first attack; nat 3 on the second attack. FFS. Oswen tries a Ray Of Frost. Nat 3. Inafina then gets hit twice by the same solider, for 10 damage. Kindle responds; he hits with a mace, and takes it down. Finally! That last one was a nightmare.

Inafina looks through the workroom door. The lock was picked in the side door but it looks like they made a mess of it and partly kicked down the door! There's soft music of bells and chimes playing from - somewhere? There are parts of unfinished toys scattered around. A stove in a far corner has pans that are melting metal. Some children here have been freed. **Naal**, a Drow child, has given Will a bar of soap that he'd stolen! A female human and a younger-looking lightfoot halfling, **Philomena**, is refusing to go. "Not without Oink! Oink is being kept in the pigpen in the garden!"

We learn this isn't "the" Pen. Inafina and Bel try to talk her down; Inafina says if we survive we'll try and rescue Oink! ADV persuasion 18. She'll run out into the market and hide with the others but refuses to leave Loomlurch until Oink is rescued. How do we know which piglet Oink is? There's only one. Sigh.

Inafina shouts "I'll be right back!" and sprints out of the door. It takes about 18 seconds (3 rounds) to reach the pen. One piglet. She opens the gate and says, "Oink! Time to go"... Animal Handling is only 11. Another go. Animal handling 18. This time she gets hold of the piglet. But while doing this, on passive perception, she notices a compost heap next to the pen is - not right. Not normal. It might be animate, but hiding?! Passive insight, it's a magical plant; it's distressed. First thing's first - she gets back and gives Philomena her piglet. She gets a hug back; though almost a full minute has passed.

Meanwhile, Oswen has been checking out the "jack in a box". Arcana 26. It's a magic item, that seems to be linked as part of a set. There's nothing inside, but it's definitely magical. She doesn't know what kind of magic, either. Probably nothing good... Well, into the Portable Hole it goes!

Infina calls from the workroom so we all go in. She tells us about the strange plant, it seems significant and its in distress. So, we all run out. Kindle lost his Silence ritual spell ages ago in combat, but the scarecrows don't watch this part of the garden - they're a fair bit further North - so we, like Inafina, get away with it luckily. Oswen tries speaking to it in Sylvan - but as she gets close it rises up. A shambling mound! It appears to *understand* Sylvan, but can't speak, so Oswen tells it we're trying to help, puts on the Helm and uses Detect Thoughts.

The mound is bound into service against its will to Scabatha. Granny Nightshade tricked it and took a cutting of its root stem, without which it can never properly exercise free will! It doesn't know where the root is; it just wants to return to the forest. Oswen realises it used to just be a general awakened plant and not a threat. She asks if it knows what this cutting might look like now. In her mind, she sees a picture. We've not seen anything else like that too. The mound thinks it's kept inside. Maybe the children know. Oswen says we will do everything we can to find it.

This means it does not attack! Handy.

We run back inside and ask the children if they know anything about the cutting. Bel persuasion, 22; Naal says he's seen something that sounds like the description. Quite big. He saw it in the kitchen; it was being used as a bookmark in a cook book! If not there, it must be in the study.

Well, we're headed that way. The kids run off and we now make our way back through guard room. We've counted and think there are 6 children still unaccounted for. **They haven't found the troublesome Pud!**

With Kindle's temp HP, we're doing OK. A bit beaten up. Oswen's used a few too many spells but still has some left. Inafina says "Ready?" and we say "Yep!". We run up and try the dormitory first. It's actually a fairly impressive landing with double doors opening to a room nestling in tree boughs, full of bunks. Inafina perception 16. She sees two children here. A young hill dwarf boy lies in bed and an older boy sits in a chair near the boy in the bed; the one in the bed is sweating and looks green and sick. The other sees us coming in and looks at the door leading to the balcony. There must be two soldiers out there still.

Oswen creeps over, making "shush" motions. "Is he suffering from poison?" "I've been asked by Granny to keep him company. His name is **Brottor**. He ate something in the garden he shouldn't have eaten!" We all try medicine checks - Inafina 5, Oswen 11, finally Kindle 15. He's poisoned! Oswen says "Oh! Well that's lucky, we have this!" and produces the mushroom. "This cures poisoning" she says... And now the boy on watch says, "I'm Pud. But Granny said not to eat anything from the garden." Oswen tries to be persuasive; 16+0. "If it doesn't work I'm calling for help!" says Pud. Fair enough.

We feed Brottor the mushroom. We hope Sloan was correct!

It is clearly pretty unpleasant to eat, but after a couple of minutes he's clearly getting better. Then he reaches for a chamber pot and barfs - and barfs some more. Euw. The he sits up! "I feel better."

Oswen looks to Pud. "We're getting everyone out. And Granny Nightshade isn't going to hear about it. Especially not from you! We've proven ourselves. Now it's your turn. If you try and tell her about this, you'll have *him* to deal with!" - she points at Kindle, complete with minor fire illusion. ADV intimidation 17! He agrees, but is concerned about Boggles in the workroom. We didn't see any before but agree to go with them. So we all head down. Oswen's actually keen to get Boggles for oil!

The two kids sneak down and the run ahead to the door, where Will is waiting. Well, we should try... Investigation, Oswen, dirty 20. She finds streaks of oil - and it leads her to no less than 3 boggles under a workbench, beneath a table cloth! She speaks to them in Sylvan; "Hello, can you help us? We have a friend who needs some oil. We thought we'd take you from this scary place."

But the moment they're spotted, they run for it! They're very fast. They run past the party, into the tin soldiers room and over to where the jack in the box was - but then look confused. So Kindle gets that out of the portable hole, Oswen takes it over to them and says, "in here?" They run over and crank the handle to make it pop open; they jump back, looking scared; nothing comes out, they look disappointed, then concerned, then look for an escape route.

Inafina insight 22. They're not cooperating. They were trying to *call* something with that box. They expected something to come out of it. OK, so we should grab them and put them in the box! "Grab 'em!" she shouts - unarmed strike, 25, grabs one of the boggles. The other stop immediately and in Sylvan say "Don't hurt us! We'll do what you want!" Oswen translates and says, "Can you breathe in there?" - points at the box. **"But that's where Cradlefall lives"** "Well, not right now" "Well no, but he pops between them."

We ask what Cradlefall is. "The green dragon wyrmling that Scabatha keeps around."

Ah.

We're just after oil. "If we give you oil will let us free?" "Yes!" - and they give us Boggle Oil. Ticked box! "Thank you. Off you go!" and we close the jack-in-box and put it carefully back into the bag. Now we know that it's got something hiding inside, but that 'something' has other ways out.

Four more kids to find. We're in that guard room, and there's one door we've not gone through yet, leading further North-ish along the trunk. Inafina cautiously opens the door to see a hallway. There are sliding cupboard doors along its side and a full door at the end. Kindle blesses Inafina again in cause of trouble; she tries the first sliding doors. A huge cupboard is inside! Lanterns handle from the ceiling in the hallway; but the cupboard is so big that it even has its own lantern too. It's really just a room.

Trouble is, standing in the middle of the room, back to us and unmoving, is a body partly encased in silk. A bunch of moths fly out away from it and circle around the brighter lantern out in the hallway. The creature in the room moves slowly, shedding this strange cocoon; it turns to us; it is a pale girl, dressed in a black pinafore, with a pig's head.

**Sowfoot**.

"Why have you disturbed me? What task am I to do now?"

Inafina guesses: "You are tasked with giving us the location of things that you stole and brought here."

"What?!"

Deception check is *very* low! Sowfoot immediately knows we don't belong here. **She raises a strange candy cane to attack!**

Animated tin soldiers, or dolls, or a carpet... That's one thing. But this is an actual person - at least, we think so! It seems we have little choice but to fight back, though. Initiative...

* Bel 23
* Oswen 15
* Inafina ADV only 11!
* Kindle 10

...so the dice don't quite match the story, but it is what it is. And it's Bel who reacts first! He succeeds in Vicious Mockery, criticising her candy cane / lollipop (!) and doing only 3 damage, but the damage isn't the point. Oswen isn't sure what to do - she backs away and tries Ray Of Frost, to slow her down more; it hits, for 1d8->solid 7 damage (and she's slowed by the cold). Inafina capitalises and goes in with the spear - hits, 11 damage - medicine check, 17+3 -> 20, she's close to going down; bonus action is a kick, which lands, for 6 damage, but done in a way to make Sowfoot unconscious.

"Tie her up!" says Inafina! So we do. In fact, there's all sorts of rope and twine in here and we tie her up in a corner, but check the room to see if there's anything sharp she might use to escape. Inafina perception only 1+5 -> 6, Oswen investigation only nat 2+6, so also very low. Bel tries investigating too; he fares better. "Give me some time" he says. "Are we in a rush?" He asks because there are lots and LOTS of boxes! All he can do is a quick check. He doesn't *see* any easily reached bottles to break, or knives or something she might use, and while Sowfoot might know better we figure it'll have to do. Plenty more rooms and Granny Nightshade must surely be aware soon of what's going on. Orvil is flying around, perception 18+2->20, nothing seems out of the ordinary. It's just boxes and stuff. He agrees with Bel.

We're about to leave but Oswen can't resist it... What's under the mask? We discover a worm-eaten, half-decomposed face. Ick! This is a ghoul - undead. Oswen can't remember much more (religion 15).

We move back to the hall. There's another sliding door on the other side, close by. Inafina listens against it; perception only 11, she hears nothing; she slides it open. It's very similar to Sowfoot's, but without shelves. A third sliding door a bit further along... Perception 10, can't hear anything!... This one is similar, but seems more food-based. Each store room has a different storage focus; nothing nefarious.

OK, then, this is it - the door at the far end of the hallway. It's easy to hear sounds of activity in the room beyond. Mechanical noises - ah! The loom. So that means more children, probably, but also more enemies. We decide to rush in - Inafina first, Kindle next, Oswen and Bel at distance.

It's a big room, some 20ft tall with spiral stairs going up. It looks like it used to be some kind of grand entrance hallway! There is debris on the ground; chunks have fallen from the ceiling and light fittings have fallen down. Woah. The big, spiralling staircase, going up at least 20ft, has a dense tangle of tree roots and brambles that have crawled in through windows above and now cover walls. Five big portraits are arrayed on the walls upwards. There are two other doors; one opposite, one to our left. The mechanical noise is loud now and comes from upstairs. It's loud enough to drown out anyone speaking, but also sounds somewhat muffled as if behind another door or perhaps some plants (given all the brambles etc).

Inafina creeps up the stairs to try and look. She needs to keep pressed against the bannisters to try and keep clear of the brambles. Doesn't want to get snagged. Stealth 18... She peers over the edge at a landing. There's a door at the end. Nothing else on this level. She beckons people up.

Oswen, perception 11, creeps up behind Inafina. Bel and Kindle are next - perception low too. If there's anything strange in those brambles, we don't know anything about it!

Inafina wonders about trying to peer around the door at the top, but in the end just thinks - meh, go for it! She opens the door. SO LOUD. Three *huge* looms are weaving here. A young goblin and two young gnomes are here - one of each working on a machine. There's a far door that probably leads out to a balcony. Around a corner is an archway that seems to lead to some kind of store room.

The moment we step fully into the room, the children see us - but look afraid and confused, as they continue to use the looms. One stops very briefly and the others look panicked, motioning her to continue! Inafina insight 18+5->23. The children are *looking at the store room* out of the corner of their eyes. Inafina signals to the others, pointing around there and says "something bad there I think". Inafina goes around the corner - something phases into a box... Boggles. She calls back "Boggles!"

She tries to grab one but these are more ready for us! Attack 9, she misses! Kindle is big and slow but right behind her, so he tries his luck. Another 9! "Slippery!" he says. Bel tries to catch one on his rapier! 25. He hooks the suspenders (!) one of the boggles is wearing. Others hide in boxes. We drop the dangling boggle into a nearby sack! Oswen tries to tell them about the boggle oil we have and that they should leave or There Will Be Trouble. We know all about the green dragon, it won't help them. Bel joins in - intimidation 16 - they offer to give us more oil in exchange for freedom. Done! Oswen's bottle is now full!

One says to the others, apparently in spite, "We may leave but they will never be free, not while those two are outside..." - and point to the balcony door. Oswen says, "Leave that to *us!*"

The boggles scuttle away. None of the boxes around seem unusual - no green dragon portals! - but we do note that boggles seem only able to teleport via boxes, or cupboards; things they could enclose themselves within.

If the children stop, the looms go quiet, the soldiers run in and they'll be at risk. We need to surprise the guards but don't want to be squashed on the balcony. We tell the children that when we give the signal, they must all run and hide in the store room now that the boggles are gone, stay low and wait for us to tell them when it's safe. Inafina and Kindle position themselves either side of the door; Bel and Oswen a distance behind.

The children stop work and go to the store room. It goes very quiet. ADV stealth:

* Inafina only 15
* Oswen 22
* Bel 22 also
* Kindle 6!

So the two by the door are most obvious and the other two are hidden somewhat. Initiative!

* Bel 24
* Inafina 22
* Oswen 8
* Kindle 7 

Astonishingly, the guards seem totally oblivious (perception 5 and 11!) when they come in, so despite our widely spaced initiatives, we surprise them. Bel fires his crossbow; he hits the closest solider for 9 damage; bardic inspiration to Infina. She continues to try and attack B; one spear, one kick. Spear nat 1 misses, kick hits but minimum damage, 5. Oswen hits with a ray of frost for 1d8->4 more. Kindle finishes off the attacks on that unlucky first-into-room tin solider with his mace; miss! Doh.

Lucky we got some surprise... Bel goes again, crit with the crossbow! Yay. 12 damage, it goes down! Good work.

Inafina *again* misses with the spear, but again gets in a kick - this time *max* damage, 8. Oswen gets in another ray of frost; hits, but only for 1d8->3. Kindle has another go too, but again *just* misses (17 to hit - AC must be at least 18). These things are tough! And now the no-longer-surprised tin soldier attacks back. He clearly thinks Inafina is the better target and indeed, hits twice, for 5 and then 3 damage.

Bel ups the ante - Vicious Mockery. WIS save by the soldier is -1! Max 4 damage, too.

Inafina sighs, gets the spear - misses yet again! - and kicks, this hitting thanks to the bardic inspiration *just* (AC is indeed 18) for a solid 7 damage. Oswen just keeps going... Dirty 20, hits, and damage is middling, only 5, but that's enough! It freezes and shatters into tin components. Phew.

"Coast is clear!" calls Oswen. The kids wander out. They introduce themselves:

* Female goblin **Yevelda**
* Female forest gnome is **Callybon**, eldest
* Male gnome **Pogo**, very young

"Ah! You were the one that got in trouble because someone naughty told on you about that horn, right?!" "Yes! I just wanted to see if it would fit in the rocking horse... It might make the rocking horse less grumpy" "Is it very grumpy?" "Yeah"

Oswen wonders if that's what Scabatha was worried about. We should probably get a good look at that horse - if we can. "Any idea where the horn might be now?" "No! She took it off me."

Yevelda tells us there's a secret way into Scabatha's bedroom. We're all ears! We're shown the window of the store room and see branches growing out and over the kitchen; crawling along them, you can jump down and across to the other tree. You can get to a window on the third tower, up at bedroom level. Tricky though. She saw Pud telling on someone! We explain what happened with us and Pud - but ask the three of them to keep an eye on him, just in case!

Callybon says they have something to give us - she doesn't want Scabatha to have it. "But we don't have anything to give in return!" "You saved *us* - we all owe you something..." - she goes to the loom and fetches a beautiful, golden-threaded kind of singlet, feminine in style; "It's one of my best pieces! We're supposed to make these things and then put runs in them, to spoil them." Oswen says, "It's very beautiful." "I want you to have it!" - the sizing would work for Oswen (all these things are made for kids!) so Oswen accepts it gratefully. She will take very good care of it.

Yevelda asks if the "secret route" is a gift? "I should say so!" we agree.

Pogo looks uncertain. "I have something... I think? I hid it..." - he goes into the store room and searches around, then finds a beautiful, small, leather-bound book. It's full of sketches and water colour paintings that he's drawn and painted, describing all the various different pixies, sprites and fey creatures of the realm. "But this is very precious!" says Oswen. "But I know all of these things now. Maybe they'll be useful to you?" It's very kind of him.

The kids go down carefully - they warn us that if we prick our fingers on the brambles, the portraits change! *Now* we realise that they're all animated (very Harry Potter). The changes in pictures are scary. 

We quickly escort the kids out to the workshop, in case Sowfoot has got free or guards have turned up. Nope; all good. They exit. On our way back, Oswen DISADV perception 15 (lucky) recognises a portrait. Tasha, of the Hideous Laughter / the statue in the Carnival. How odd. She goes up to near that portrait. She has to walk past others to do this - Tasha is the fourth one up - and is now paying a lot more attention. The first, second and third are beautifully painted; the first is Bavlorna! The second is Scabatha. She surmises that the third is Endelyn - a black, skeletal-looking hag that wears a contraption that's a kind of massive, flowing, old French style dress.

Odd, then, that the fourth picture should be *very* like the carnival statue. As for the fifth. History 11, she asks for help; Inafina gets 13, not much better but she has an inkling - why yes, of course - a very ancient, almost crumbling, terrifying hag. Baba Yaga! But that means Tasha is... Oh dear!

Oswen tries touching a spike of a bramble under the fourth picture. Expressions of all the paintings appear to look at her, looking almost shocked; then colours wash away; then they swirl, reform and Oswen hears Inafina gasp. Inafina is at the second painting. She points - "What?!" - and there is a portrait of *Oswen*, with Fairie wings and crown. The fifth photo is her grandmother; fourth is her father, third is her mother; the first picture is a child, but older than Oswen. Oswen does not remember siblings before she fell into the Fey; she'd assumed that if her parents had more kids, they must be younger than her. So what does it mean?

Kindle points out that time in the Fey and time in Oswen's world pass differently. Perhaps that is a younger child, as they look now. Or as they might look? It could just be a trick.

Oswen can't really take her eyes of these for a while. The memories of what these people looked like had faded so much - yet here they are in front of her, unmistakeable. If this family then that means Tasha is definitely part of the Baba Yaga family too. **Is Tasha actually Iggwilv? Is Iggwilv her real name?** We're reminded that nobody really knows what Iggwilv looks like.

Bel isn't keen on touching anything - he thinks it'd be traumatic; his family is all dead. And that makes us sombre and Inafina agrees - but Kindle reaches forward and pricks his finger. He can't help it. He just wants to see his family again. And now we all see them; a mother, father and two siblings. After he left, he'd never been back.

"Are you OK?" asks Oswen.

He has a hand resting on one of the pictures. "I'm OK. It's alright... Right. Let's go."

Oswen is keen to check out the rocking horse. It's right outside, after all. Seems too easy to miss (and therefore probably risky!). She cautiously opens the outside ground floor door. There's the horse; it faces away. There's also another one of those painted boxes with a crank handle. We're fortunately hidden from view of much of the garden by big tree roots and a fallen branch. Our first order of business is to "make safe" (ish) that box - we put it into the portable hole, with the other one.

Oswen walks around to face the horse. She's expecting it to be alert / aware, given what the kids said about it being grumpy; its eyes move slightly. She says, "Hello". It does not reply. She says "I'm just going to look at the top of your head, if that's OK..." - moving around but keeping a bit of distance - she wants to see if there's anything that looks like it might allow a horn to be threaded in. After all, Pogo seemed to think the horn would do so. (Oswen's theory now is that this horn might not be a real unicorn horn at all, but actually belong to *this* rocking horse and Scabatha's fear of it being outside could well be exactly that it gets put back into place - in which case, we want to do that!)

Oswen is surprised. She leans in - she sees the screwhole but she gets headbutted suddenly by the horse, and is knocked to the ground! 5 damage!

"Well, there was no need to do *that!*" says Oswen. Kindle has already got his Mace drawn, but Oswen waves at him, "no, no it's my fault, I didn't wait for answer and I think I scared this poor horse, no wonder it bucked like that. I'm sorry horse, I don't know your name, but mine is Oswen."

Insight, a lucky 19+1->20. She realises that the horse isn't responding to anything that she says and that the children think it's grumpy *because* it headbuts them. It can't move, but it can rock. Granny Nightshade is able to move this, but it can't move itself. Arcana - another crazy roll, 20!+8->28. She has to get closer; the horse bucks again; this time, it glances off her mage armour.

Ah! How strange! This is essentially a magic item, not a life form per se. It will not attack if mounted. You have to get on, to talk. She tells the others and Inafina offers as her size is a better match for the horse; ACRO 18. The horse calms down. Inafina realises straight away that this isn't an atunement thing; this is a remarkable creature. Blindsight to 60ft, but *nothing* beyond that. And it can fly of course. Inafina tries to communicate, but it cannot talk. It can respond to instructions. She even makes it hover.

Kindle looks at the portable hole. It's got a lot in, but has more room... He looks at the horse and suggests, "Well, if it's an item that Scabatha wants, it seems a good idea to stop her having it!"

Inafina has to get the horse to fly into the hole, but dive off at the last minute; DEX save, 19. The horse goes in, she jumps out as it enters, lands neatly on the ground and Kindle quickly wraps up the top. Inafina concurs with Oswen, "Yes, it's definitely got a hole for a horn." Oswen suggests that the horn Pogo found might not be Elidon's at all, but the others remind her of other clues that make it seem very likely. So what happens if Elidon's horn is screwed in here? Is *this* Elidon, in some transformed form? Scabatha can turn creatures into toys. Could it be...?

Well, we decide to elevate our priorities on finding that horn! But next, there's the kitchen and hopefully, the sentient bush's root.

We move back to the tower. Inafina listens at the door which we think leads to the kitchen. Perception 13; it does sound like that. People are moving around and talking in there for sure. Someone asks a question about potatoes (!) but is shushed! And then there are some interrupted snore sounds, which settle down. So - someone who sounds old wants potatoes, someone is asleep and shouldn't be woken. Inafina puts her finger to her lips to indicate "be quiet" and as quietly as she can, opens the door.

A run-down kitchen carved out of the wood has a few tables. A young girl is shackled to one of them; she is peeling potatoes. Lots of strange jars and concoctions everywhere, a sickly sweet cloying smell, mouldy cookbooks... And then as she looks quickly around the room - dominating the centre, a big clay oven atop which sits a cauldron from which the smell comes and, coiled up in front snoring - **a green dragon wyrmling** the size of a wolf. Inafina stealth 19+6->25. She sneaks in without waking the dragon. The child looks shocked! Inafina tries to motion that it's OK. She doesn't see anyone else here, but there's a grate on the ground, 3ft square, padlocked.

She looks down into it, but it's dark. She looks back to the others, standing in the doorway. She wants to talk to the group so she starts to sneak back out of the room, but the child grabs her! She stops immediately. The child just looks at her, Inafina leans down right next to her ear, and whispers as quietly as she can, "We're going to rescue you. I'm not leaving you. But we need to figure out how, because of the dragon, so I must talk to the others. I won't be gone long." CHA-based stealth is only 7! 

Inafina behind her hears a noise she'd hoped not to hear - or rather, a lack of noise. The snoring stops. Her heart falls. She turns to face it. The dragon spreads its wings and calls out, some kind of strange wailing!

Initiative:

* Bel 19
* Inafina 9
* Oswen 9
* Kindle 2

Bel casts Dissonant Whispers, L1; the dragon fails its save luckily (only WIS 14). 11 psychic damage; it stops making the noise it was making. It reacts immediately and starts flying away from Bel, to the back of the kitchen, into a far corner. Unfortunately it seems the noise was more than enough - a side door opens and in run two tin soldiers who just happened to be on patrol there and overheard. Rats! The closest heads towards Inafina.

The dragon recovers from its prior fear. It flies close and breathes poison at Infina, but is careful to avoid the child. Kindle is hit too. Inafina CON save 14; poor Kindle is caught completely by surprise though! A whopping **24 poison damage**. Even with only half, Inafina is almost felled by it; it tries to attack physically too but misses. Kindle is very badly hurt by the poison breath but is still up.

Inafina has no idea how to fight a dragon! She flies up with her boots and jabs in the spear; that hits for 9, but her kick misses completely. She's not used to kicking while walking in the air! (Nat 1).

Oswen runs in and tries Scorching Ray; two hit; 15 damage in total. It's looking injured but then Oswen sees the second tin soldier and shouts, "Oh, no, we need to take out the soldiers too!"; she runs back out behind Kindle for a bit of cover. Brave kindle now runs into the room fully, around the oven so he will catch both of the tin soldiers, then uses his amulet to call Channel Divinity to cast Twilight Sanctuary centred on him, to help the rest of us with healing. He tries to grab at a passing solider, but misses. He gets 9 temp HP himself after that.

Bel aims his crossbow at the dragon and fires. 23 - a hit! 9 damage. The dragon falls lifeless with a thud onto the table below. The girl jumps back, chain rattling, and hides under the table! Bel casts Healing World as a bonus action on Inafina for a max 12. Bel runs around to see if he can free the girl from her shackles. He also increases temp HP slightly (had 8, but d6->5+4 -> 9).

The first tin soldier attacks Kindle. One hit, one miss. Fortunately the damage isn't so bad; 4. Inafina flies over their heads, above the furthest, but diagonally downwards attacks the first one which had gone for Kindle.  The spear hits but for only d8->3+4 -> 7 damage. She crits with the kick but the 2d4 is only 1,1 -> minimum 6 damage only from the crit. At least she does better on the temp HP, max 6+4->10. Oswen throws a freezing ray at the same one, but - 14 - the ray glances off the metal, causing no harm.

The second tin solider under Inafina moves to attack Kindle. It's still in her area so she can't get an opportunity attack on it. One of its two hits finds its mark, doing Kindle 5 damage. That's his temp HP gone, but now it's Kindle's turn. He tries his mace but misses! He gets 8 temp HP back, though.

Bel considers options. He decides to cast Bane. It's worked well for him before. Both soldiers fail their saves, so both are affected by the 1d4 penalty.

The other tin soldier attacks Kindle. Even with bane, it gets one hit. 6 damage. Inafina lowers down to flank and continues her attack on the first soldier, trying to reduce the enemy count. Thanks to bardic inspiration (needed despite flanking advantage) she gets in the spear for 9, and with flanking her kick hits for max 8. It goes down. Oswen tries again, this time on the other tin soldier; misses again; temp HP roll is minimum so she stays at; now the solider runs at her. Inafina tries to kick it as it leaves; misses; Kindle also misses (16 and 17 rolled, but the AC is even higher).

The solider dodges the opportunity attacks, but its first swipe at Oswen misses. The second is a crit, depressingly. 9 damage. Ouch.

Kindle runs in and tries to tackle the solider but misses; but he casts Shield Of Faith, boosting Oswen's AC with mage armour to 17. He gains 7 temp HP.

Bel fires his crossbow; it hits, doing a solid 10 damage; and he casts L2 Healing Word, healing Kindle for an also very solid 13.

Inafina runs in and attacks; crit with the spear! 2d8->6,6, so 16 damage. Her kick just misses though - 17.

Oswen considers risking an opportunity attack - we need to move on - the others have been hurt; she weighs that against *her* being hurt; she says, "I need distance", and without disengaging runs back. She takes the risk; Kindle boosted her AC. Of course, this being the world's most depressing battle, the solider gets 18 against her 17 AC. And it's a huge damage roll for the solider, 7. Now she tries ray of frost, but it also misses. A catastrophic turn. "I'm so sorry" she calls out, actually really quite upset, as she's let the party down. She at least gets 9 temp HP Back.

The tin solider runs for Bel. Inafina tries to opp attack; it does hit, just, only 7 damage, but that's enough.

Over time, Kindle's aura lasts long enough for everyone to end up with 10 temp HP. Oswen is upset and angry with herself; "I took a risk and it was stupid and it didn't work, I was trying to be all brave and keep fighting, but all I've done is get hurt and put us at risk." Then Oswen remembers the grate. "Oh! The floor! Bel!" - and then a voice calls out, "Is anyone alive out there?!" from down in the floor. The girl tugs at Inafina.

Bel, SOH, 26, frees the girl who is, of all people, Mishka. She says, "Only Granny has the key!", pointing at the grate; we try the keys from Pincushion, but indeed, none work. Bel has a go picking the lock. He has by remarkable luck another 26 - and that's enough, even though the DC was intended to be very high (25).

Whoever is down there asks us if we have a rope! There stands a bedraggled dwarf. We drop down the rope with Kindle holding and help him up (Inafina helps too with her flying boots to give him a boost). This is no child! Inafina, ADV persuasion 10, nat 20 + 2 -> 22. He opens up. He says his name is **Elkhorn**, "You remind me of my companions! **Strongheart** would find you most honourable. **Ringlerun** would be most impressed by you, young lady!" - ah! So, this is the competing group against the League Of Malevolence.

He explains that he's rather ashamed! He doesn't know what has happened to everyone else. They were in the Palace and had just caught up with the League; they were in a mighty battle and everything started to freeze. He was hit from behind at that moment and knocked out; he woke up here. Granny Nightshade has been torturing him (!) for information ever since. "If it were not for the kindness of the children like Mishka here, I would have starved to death. She's all but forgotten me."

He asks our intentions and we explains. He wants to help. He needs his things; we will look for them; in return we ask if he's seen the root - but Mishka already has and finds it. She hasn't seen the horn in the kitchen though. She's not seen it in a week or so, in fact.

This time, Oswen helps Bel investigate - 17,19+2 -> 21 - we find pretty much all of Elkhorn's stuff. We get it all together. Despite his ordeal, he's hardy. He could be good in a fight.

Inafina, perception 21. The cauldron with the sickly, melted candy smell bubbles away atop the oven. The oven is very unusual. It's really large, and she senses more to it. Some kind of creature, a being, trapped within - another magmin? She says to Oswen, "you've dealt with magmins before?" but Oswen looks at the size of the oven - it could be even bigger. She looks inside. Coal black eyes of a fire elemental! It's bound inside the clay enclosure, held here by magic.

Oswen arcana 27. What are our options... Cracking the back of the oven *should* let the elemental escape. She calls into the oven in Sylvan, "I don't know if you can understand me but we are going to try and free you."

Oswen moves around the back, thinking the hot oven might be cracked by a sudden cold. She hits it with a ray of frost, 6 damage, which does indeed seem to cause disproportionate damage (it took 12). But it's not quite cracked yet. She tries again; only 2 this time (takes 4). That, even though low, is enough. The oven cracks apart! The fire elemental emerges, and thankfully does not attack. It crackles and speaks...

Oswen has to use her 2nd to last spell on Comprehend Languages.

"Thank you! You are kind of heart. I was summoned and trapped here by a witch. You have freed me! I desire vengeance upon her."

It suggests that it hides back in the oven. If we can lure Granny Nightshade here, and get her to peer in the oven - which it says she often does - someone could kick her in! If she gets kicked in, the fire elemental can attack!

Well, we figure Scabatha is probably next on our To Do list. Oswen determines that it speaks Common, so we ask it to wait as we need to escort Mishka back to Chucklehead (he's delighted!) and we return the root to the shambling mound. It too is delighted! Bel uses his instrument to cast Speak With Plants, this time, since the Helm has already been used. Persuasion 22. At, we learn, Bel's request, the plant suddenly rushes at the scarecrows and destroys them! "Well, I guess it's on - because the mound is heading to the kitchen to help!"

"Kitchen it is!" says Oswen, laughing.

Suddenly we see the last two tin soldiers, on the balcony, run down to attack the mound; it destroys them easily and continues to rip up the garden. It's a full rampage!

Chucklehead is now moving people safely out into the woods.

We go back to the kitchen. On the way past the room with Sowfoot we slide the door; she's there, awake, tied up and hissing threats at us!

We get to the kitchen. We hide the dragon; Mishka isn't here, but Oswen might try an illusion? We need *something* so that Granny Nightshade looks in the oven and doesn't just immediately see the place empty. We do close the grate and clean up the solider parts. It's clean and tidy, but no child here.

Oswen and Bel come up with a disguise plan. Across the various rooms, especially the workshop, there are all sorts of things to help with the outfit and the disguise and Oswen, for once, is glad of her short stature that helps her pass as a child. The chain and shackle are fitted but unlocked and she carries on peeling potatoes as she imagines Granny expects them to be finished. She's hoping to get a rest...

...and we do indeed get a short rest, waiting for Granny's afternoon check on the kitchen. During the rest we hear shuffling of branches and leaves behind the door - our shambling mound is ready, we think! The elemental is in the oven, lying in wait. That's the best we can do.

Inafina ADV perception; 1,18+5->23. Smashing of pots and angry stomping from outside! It's towards the goblin market... That's strange. She creeps out to try and get a look. Two redcaps! They're angrily smashing up the stalls. "Oswen! You got that candy?" and Oswen hands her our two pieces of candy.

Inafina heads over quietly. "Gentlemen! This is obviously a terrible day. Please, accept this candy! It will make you feel better!" - they're already taking candy but greedily take hers. She says, "And I'm sure you can offer me some small token in return?" They sputter... Bits of candy fly out of their mouths. Ick. Bluster and splutter, one pushes the other; "Why did you take her candy?!" "You took her candy too!" - the argue briefly; and then explode.

Actually explode. And that's a messy business.

Inafina goes back to the group. She says, "You do *not* want to know what I just saw. The two Red Caps are gone!" - Oswen politely helps with some Prestidigitation... Ick.

We know it's going to happen soon. We've had a good rest but tension is building. Orvil has been sat on one of the branches we were shown that provides another route into the bedroom. No patrols, so he feels more safe doing that. He signals to Oswen that Scabatha is on the move and she lets everyone know. Everyone's in position. Kindle casts Guidance on Oswen too.

And then she walks in. A very scary figure! The key on her back turns slowly. She walks in, sniffing the air and growling. "What's wrong with this? The cauldron's not hot enough! STUPID CHILD! Why didn't you tell me the cauldron is too cold?"

Oswen, Deception ADV 17,17+2 with Guidance, total 22. Granny Nightshade comes around asking what's up. Oswen tries in a high pitched voice to say, "The light inside looks different." "It's that stupid elemental!" - and as she looks into the door the plan is to message Elkhorn so that her and Kindle will try and push her in together. Oswen sends her message. "I'll douse you with ice!" shouts Skabatha at the elemental. With a yell, in runs the dwarf; Kindle moves to push too; ADV ATHL 16; Skabatha STR save 15, close! But she gets pushed in and Elkhorn slams the grated oven door shut.

Initiative:

* Inafina (ADV from Kindle) 16,20+6->26
* Fire elemental 14
* Bel 13
* Mound 7
* Kindle 6
* Oswen 3
* Elkhorn 2

We say that on Inafina's high roll, she actually runs in when Elkhorn gives his battle cry and helps Granny into the oven with kick (dirty 20 to hit, hits, with 7 damage).

Skabatha is raging inside the oven! She takes another 10 damage, and this sudden onset interferes a little with her spell casting, but we have little doubt she'll get her act together soon - and she attacks the oven walls to try and get out. It's an oven, so claws - poisonous or not - don't do as much damage as she probably expects. Likewise, the fire elemental has immunity to poison. She's screaming in frustration. Ah - red caps - the garden will be growing them.

(Oswen shouts out a warning that Red Caps will be coming).

The fire elemental tries fire attacks, twice, on Skabatha. It's in the same space as her so pretty much can't miss; 15 then 10 damage consecutively. 

Bel runs in. Through the grated door he can see Skabatha and she can certainly hear him clearly - he can hear her, for sure! - and he tries Vicious Mockery; "You're so unoriginal that you're even doing the whole witch-in-oven thing!"; WIS save; surprisingly she fails with a 12! Only 1 damage, heh, but next attack is at disadvantage.

The mound outside seems to fighting something. Oswen figures it must be red caps. Oswen mentally connects to Orvil and asks him to fly over and get a look. She wants eyes on that in case it needs help. Three red caps are attacking; one is entangled, another is being slammed on the ground; well, it seems to be doing OK!

Kindle calls upon his Spiritual Weapon, which attacks her inside the oven, hitting (22) for 9 radiant damage. She seems to have no resistance to it. Kindle also pushes against the door, trying to stop her from pushing out and escaping. She's confused, because the door won't open and she can't see Kindle!

Oswen figures now is a good time for that L2 spell. Fire won't hurt the elemental; scorching ray. She runs up to the grate and throws the spell through it - ADV as Skabatha is constrained by the oven entryway. First hits; nat 20, 1,1,4,6 oh well, 12 damage though; second somehow misses, nullifying the crit anyway; third hits for 9.

Elkhorn is also pushing against the grate now, and Skabatha must think he's the only reason it won't open. Inafina tries to get in a radiant sunbolt but (15, like Oswen's second attempt) it misses.

Skabatha tries to push against the door. She has to beat both Elkhorn and the unseen-by-her Kindle. She roll a solid 18, but Kindle gets 19 thanks to ADV. The door is held closed. She rages away! She suffers another 10 damage in the fire, clawing away inside but to no avail; the fire elemental burns so bright that it is becoming painful for both Elkhorn and Kindle at the door, and gets two hits on Skabatha, 14 and 10 damage. She's in bad shape now.

Bel tries Hold Person, as he's worried that she's going to escape the oven given how she so nearly got the door open before. This time, she resists the spell effects. "Drat!" exclaims Bel.

The mound continues crashing and smashing outside; Orvil relays images of general destruction to Oswen, who sees it seems in not too much danger but it's holding its ground. We might need to help soon...

...but Kindle meanwhile spends the whole time pushing back against the door; his radiant effect hits for 5 damage. Oswen shouts, "That's good, keep it closed if you can!" but now has no L2 spells left.

Oswen tries Chromatic Orb, but despite advantage it misses! Damn. That's all her spells gone. She's cursing - she's made so many mistakes today. Inafina also despite advantage misses with Radiant Sun Bolt. Not good.

Scabatha takes 10 more damage from the fire, but gets 24 on her attempt to push the door open. Despite Elkhorn's help - Kindle 19. The door flies open as Kindle is pushed back, along with the rest of us that were up close. The fire elemental attacks from behind - it has enough reach, and Skabatha is *very* flanked right now! - and both attacks hit, but for middling 10 and 11 damage.

Bel fires his crossbow; it, too misses. He gives Bardic Inspiration to Kindle.

The mound is keeping up the fight outside - so far, so good...

...while Kindle gets his Holy Ladle spiritual weapon which hits, though for minimum 5 damage; then he decides to reveal himself and attacks with his mace. He wants to take her down. ADV due to flanking, plus bardic inspiration; it *just* scrapes the hit. 6 more damage; and just as he attacks and connects, she turns to him and realisation dawns in her eyes; "You! You were in my room this morning!" she claims - as his blow lands, her clockwork key smashes and she melts into a strange puddle of goo.

Quite some last words.

Oswen shouts, "We must help the mound!" as it's still in combat. We run out the side door and engage the remaining red caps. With so many of us, we make short work of them.

We are thanked by the mound and elemental; they then flee. Elkhorn, meanwhile, wants to look after the children - but insists we free Zyblina. He shares as much as he can to help.

* He tells us all about the League.
* He tells us what he can about the palace (ADV on Survival / Navigation therein) and where 
his party last were.
* The only way the kids can be returned, if they want to go, is by Zybilna being freed.

### 3750 XP each -> LEVEL 5 (at next long rest)

We try searching for the horn. Investigation for everyone is critically low. We have no idea if we've missed it or if it's here. It's really, really frustrating. We don't even find much in the study, but we spend time on the Identify ritual to work out what we *do* find.

* A large human eyeball inside the lower half of a small hourglass that hangs like a pendant on a necklace made of woven hair of three colours (we assume the hags). It's the "hag's eye", a focus of magic. If they find it, they're much more powerful. Any of us that have this eye, can "see" through the eyes of any of the other hags in the coven. Oswen thinks only one could be created - and we have it. However, a hag can also use magic to see through it in reverse. So for now, we wrap it in a rag and put it in the portable hole (removing the two large boxes). As she removes the boxes, with Identify now up, Oswen realises that these are *not* pocket dimensions and work as teleport but with a shock realises that they *could* have been and that would have been *very, very* bad indeed. **We must be much more careful in future**.

* A scroll of Remove Curse and a scroll of Polymorph.

* A box with lots of gems and spell components, which look like the kinds of stuff she needs herself for some spell transcriptions - about 4 levels of spell. With her existing inventory, that means she could transcribe about 5 levels of spell.

* There are lots of books about Fey Wild Lore all written in Elvish, but none of which seem that useful to her. We collect them in case someone likes them and put them in the portable hole for now.

* A collection of contracts written in Fey, of all the bargains and deals struck between Skabatha and various people who asked for favours. Oswen immediately looks for Diana, investigation 14. It's enough. She finds the contract. If she tears up the contract, she thinks it'll undo the curse. She checks with Inafina and Kindle who think it would be best to not do that until we meet up again with Diana. There's nothing we can find about Sowfoot though.

In a corner, is a tall oval mirror in a wooden frame, built into one of the bookcases. It's revealed by sliding back a bookshelf. It's very similar to the one we found in Bavlorna's pool. **Another doorway to the Witchlight Carnival**. We can't leave yet, but now we have two options! Kindle suggests we try to remove it and take it with us; Identify suggests that should be safe; so we try. We carefully work to remove it and stow it away.

It's a strange feeling for this to be over so suddenly, but a feeling of strange frustration from all the unknowns and unfound things. There's so much in this domain that we've not solved still.

This place is tapped out, but for Sowfoot. We return to her room. Kindle asks what we intend to do with her... It kinda depends on her. We'd like to get her to bugger off and leave us alone, if she's not intrinsically evil? A pawn, not an instigator?

We tell her Nightshade is dead. Will she help us? "Untie me and then we can talk." Oswen insight 12; she certainly won't speak unless freed. So Oswen takes the risk. Warns the party, realises it's probably another bad idea but does it anyway. She unties Sowfoot.

Sowfoot stands and shakes off all the ropes. "All right. You may ask me one question and then I'm leaving."

"Thank you." says Oswen. And Bel asks, trying to be persuasive, "Where is Elidon's horn?" - 21. She says, "I don't have it." Bel says "That's not what I asked." "Well it's here somewhere!" Bel says, "My question was, where is the horn." "I don't know." "Thank you, we understand. You're free to go."

She walks out the door. We hope not to meet again, but suspect we might!

Right thing to do...

...well, we'd better check the grounds, mop up any remaining bad guys, or any good guys, then retreat to Little Oak.

This takes a while - towards the evening, with more shit rolls. Investigation Oswen 6+6, Insight Inafina 3+6. Awful. So we don't find anything much and we don't understand anything. All we know is that the magic seems to changing here, similar to Bavlorna; whatever hold Skabatha had, it's waning.

Kindle uses his last L2 spell to cast By The Light Of The Moon. The area around him is bathed in magical moonlight that gives people around him better investigation and perception abilities for a minute. He looks around first; ADV perception 16; Bel helps, ADV investigation 22. The cupboard that Sowfoot leant against had a box that was tipped over and opened. Something was taken from it.

So Sowfoot got the better of us. Must've lied. Fey rules just mean nothing here - plenty of people just seem totally immune to any of it. Insight indicates that this is certainly true of Sowfoot; she's not bound to this plane, answering to a more powerful being as long as Zyblina is trapped. Forces here won't and don't need to play by rules, or play nice.

We get a strong sense that she took the unicorn horn. And she's gone, anywhere. We have no powers that can find her.

That's that. We head to Little Oak, knowing we've failed.

At Little Oak, everyone is overjoyed. It's hard to accept the mood, but at least we can give Squirt his boggle oil! He fills up, his spirits lift. He invites us all to come and celebrate. He promises that in the morning, he will show us the way to Yon. We thank him but say we have one diversion first - we need to return to Wayward Pool in the morning. (Oswen uses Prestidigitation to make sure her water bottle is clean!)

Change in the air. Gloominess receding. We hope that the big oak we saw, recently yet it seems like so long ago, is OK. The night draws on; the kids get tired; one by one they fall asleep.

Will comes over towards the end. "I didn't know that this could happen; I believed it could, but to be honest, I never knew. I think you for helping to make this come true and for not ruining everything!" - we say that we're glad the kids are safe, this domain is probably still risky, there are probably and things about, keep their wits about them, but it's a lot safer than it was.

He tells us that Zyblina's magic still protects the children. If they are harmed, they are teleported automatically to some safe place in the realm! They'd be stuck there without Zyblina to free them, mind you.

Everyone falls asleep.

### Additional 1200XP for the boggle oil and freeing all children without endangering Will



## DAY 10

In the early morning, using her special quill, Oswen quickly transcribes L3 Dispel Magic from the scroll to her spell book. She also learns L3 Counterspell and Minute Meteors, preparing both, but having to drop Dragon's Breath - unused, thus far, and she can't really figure out when to use it. Despite Inafina's recent "incident" with exploded red caps, Prestidigitation - while tremendously useful at times - isn't something that seems all that useful in our current highly dangerous environments! A bit of heat or flavour for food, or cleaner clothes, seems like something of a luxury now. Instead, she goes for something she's seen Kindle do - Toll The Dead. She thinks of Sowfoot. If there are no rules, so be it. Bad spells are good today.

Kindle can do Sending now. Bel decides to opt for Dispel Magic, since between that and Oswen's Counterspell, we feel we at least have *some* chance of defending ourselves against bad magic - and there's plenty of it about!

In the morning, we have to say goodbye to everyone but we'll be back; or at least we'll meet again, we hope because we need to find ways to get anyone whom who wants to. We're going to visit the unicorn, but we don't think the unicorn will know the password to the mirror that gets to the carnival, and between the kids and what we've learned before, we're pretty sure that there are no other ways to activate it. Sowfoot knows the password... Well, then, that's all for another day. Star can stay with the kids for now - much safer than travelling with us.

By late morning we're all wrapped up and heading towards Wayward Pool. We still have our fake unicorn horns, since we knew we might have to come back here for a rest! Orvil tries to fly around and see if there's anyone who might be following us - but too much tree cover (perception nat 1+2). We have to risk it, then; we proceed and make it to the lake shore. Inafina has a torch, which we light with Kindle's tinderbox; she uses her boots to walk over and light the brazier, then returns.

When Lamorna appears, we explain what happened, including losing the horn to Sowfoot. Of course, she's disappointed but says "I hold out hope and that is my best advice - to give up hope in a realm like this is to lose the very thing that powers the realm." Oswen smiles and says, "Yes. That's why I think we'll find Sowfoot, or she'll find us. I'm sure our paths will cross again."

We depart and return back towards the treehouse to collect Squirt, our unusual guide to Yon. On the way back, Inafina notices in particular certain things she saw before - perception 23 - trees that were dying are now recovering. A narrow passage into the mountains in the distance over the lake has a *gargantuan* spider, that's built a web across a canyon edge. It's talking to a group of forest animals, telling stories from a storybook she holds in her two shorter front legs! That's quite a sight so we pause to listen. Some of the animals speak. "**Yarnspinner** is back! We wondered where she had gone!" - so this, it seems is another sign of recovery. Yarnspinner is keeping an eye on us - literally - as we move away and Inafina sees her nod, a subtle gesture, in our direction while continuing her stories.

Squirt tells us we have a long way to go. A big track. It'll get cold and dangerous! We should bring something warm to wear. But we left the Witchlight Carnival somewhat (now rather famously) under-prepared and have little of that nature in our packs. Mishka suggests we go to Chucklehead's village - a goblin village. They might have things we can buy.

At the village, Chucklehead is happy to see Mishka. But he's in bed, not feeling too well. He says the worm has stopped talking to him - he feels confused and has a headache. Our hearts sink. The worm gave him this personality, but his days were numbered. And there's not much we can do; if we were able to restore the curse, it'd change him and his personality; he insists on being who he is. Mishka wants to stay with him a while, rather than going back to Little Oak straight away - and we certainly understand that.

But of course - trading requires trinkets, not gold. And we need clothes for three of us (Kindle's fine in the cold) and at least one climbing kit, for the person in the lead; and a proper long climbing rope. If we want to be safe:

* 3 sets of clothing
* 3 climbing kits for those who can't easily Fly
* One proper long climbing rope

So, 7 trinkets, if we can somehow do that!

* Oswen has three trinkets left from way back - the interlinked yew rings, the big jigsaw puzzle piece and the fork with tines bent sideways
* We also trade Bavlorna's book of who she hates (!)
* The red cap we got
* Bel trades a vial of his precious perfume (but he has 3 left)
* Kindle gives a set of candles (he still has one set left of 5 candles)

Inafina takes the rope; she doesn't need the climber kit. Oswen recognises it - better than we hoped for! A magical rope, a Rope Of Climbing. We shuffle things around; Bel's fine clothes end up in his chest. He ends up in his cold weather clothes. We ask what he thinks of them - but he's busy making little adjustments to make them more fashionable!

Inafina's clothing is thick and white, wooly. Oswen's is a big brown jumper than she can wear over her robe, but with a rope belt to stop it getting draughty and stout - if rather scratchy - trousers, with ties around the ankles. It's all in shades of brown, but it makes the blue of the cloak stand out!

We all have thick scarves and gloves, too, in various bright colours and goblins being goblins, thick goggles! The weather can wild out there.

Squirt reminds us that he really is just an animated oil can! He needs nothing to be fine in the cold weather and we can carry him on climbs easily enough.

Mishka stays behind; Bobi heads back to let everyone know what's happening; others might come to visit Chucklehead. We depart, feigning good humour for his benefit, but we're quite sad - we're fairly sure that could be the last time we see him. But despite his condition, he is happy; he got to see Granny Nightshade dispatched and the kids freed. They were coerced into running the candy market and hated the red caps, so he's very pleased with *that* trinket!

**"I may not have many days left, but at least the days I have are days I can spend however I wish, doing things that matter to me."**

Squirt leads us into the wilderness, North West, towards the mountains. Every now and again Squirt gets jumpy and insists we hide. One time, Inafina sees a shadow pass overhead - "It's the Jabberwock!" whispers Squirt. So it patrols around here. We get into foothills, with old paths that go past old natural stone arches; "here we go!" he says, heads under one and starts upwards. We reach a point where Squirt tells us we need our climbing gear. "That's where we're going!" he says, pointing with a spout. All we can see is a thunderhead cloud! It looks very scary. "Are you sure that's the only way?!" says Oswen. "It's the only way unless you can fly over the top of it!"

We rise into the lower mists.

It's a long climb. We're all roped to each other. Every now and then Squirt calls back to check we're OK; he seems to not need any of the rope or gear; a kind of magical movement ability that isn't limited like walking, but also isn't flying. It's as if any surface is horizontal - he hops - it's quite strange to watch at times, on vertical or even overhanging surfaces. He later explains that this is in part due to boggle oil - it can be either slippery or sticky, so he climbs by using the sticky kind.

At least an hour passes, though it's hard to judge for sure. The mist is starting to clear; bright blue flashes are visible through it. Then, abruptly, the mist ahead clears fully. Group ADV DEX saves...

* Oswen 19
* Inafina 26
* Bel 21
* Kindle 16

...because we're standing right on the edge of a ledge! It's only 3ft wide, on the side of a mountain. We could've easily just walked straight off it! Fortunately, we all catch ourselves in time.

Perception checks - impossibly low; 10 Oswen, 7 Inafina, 10 Orvil; 7 Bel; 12 Kindle! We're expecting blinding light - but it's not. It's dark; really dim - due to huge thunder clouds up ahead and howling wind; we're pushed back against the wall behind the ledge. We quickly put on our goggles! Squirt says "we need to find shelter!" and leads us sideways. Then, there's a bright blue flash and boom - lightning. So *that* is what we saw earlier. This lets us see that we're on an immense crag, huge, this tiny ledge winding away a long distance; some rock in the distance even falls. But bizarrely, across a valley below us, is a mountain peak with some kind of lightning rod at the peak - this directs the bolt. Another one, distant, seems to hit another such rod, which we can *almost* makes out. Inafina is just about able to make out that there are crescent moon like shapes on these rods and given that she can see them *at all* they must be huge - 30ft tall or so.

D8->3. On one flash, rock seems to be flying across the valley, as if thrown. Oswen calls forward to ask Squirt if there are giants up here. "I think so? I mean, there are giants in the realm! I'll get you to a cave safely but I don't know much further into the realm. This is Yon!" and we say, "Oh, OK, that's great, a cave would be good - then spend as much time as you need and get back safely!"

In one of the bright flashes, Kindle points - "What is that?!" - and we see about half a dozen lightning rods on the mountains all seem to light up in a flare. Arcs of lightning shoot horizontally, towards some kind of single point - a particularly large distant mountain, with a cluster of rods and we *think* we see some kind of huge amphitheater with a tall tower within it. The lighting bolts are all hitting that cluster.

Squirt asks if we can light a campfire. She doesn't have anything to burn, but wonders if there might be moss or similar that's dried on walls. Instead, to her surprise she finds an old campfire! There are bits of wood, not completely burned; we're able to get that going with the tinderbox.

We're not the first here - we suppose that's not too surprising.

Squirt warms up (carefully!) by the fire, chatting. He apologises that he can't lead us further - but we say that's fine and ask if he can get back safely; he says yes, no problem. He also gives us a small whistle. Apparently, if we need to get back, and if we can find this cave again, we can blow on the whistle and he'll hear it from Thither. He'll come to lead us out.

**We thank him. He thanks us in turn for the oil - it'll keep him going for months! "Good luck!" he says and we say the same back. Off he hops.**

A strange sudden feeling of loneliness after being surrounded by so many people for a while, then suddenly alone in this cold cave with a storm outside.

So, we've made it to Yon.

(End of Part 1.7)
