# Oswen: Part 1.4
## Day 5
### On a small island, an hour or two away from The Stump

Oswen checks her spell book and elects to keep things the same as they are. She's learned the things she still thinks might be useful. It's a series of difficult compromises, but she can only manage to remember so many things at once!

Bel strums quietly on his lute. Kindle helps get the boat upright. We're surprised to see Bel was unusually well prepared for the evening - a fluffy sleeping robe and hat! He goes behind the tree to change into his daytime clothes, complete with top hat. "Grey dawn" lighting again.

We're not sure what the day will hold. Doubtless, we'll encounter Agdon's crew. 

He must have hopes and dreams. Is stealing from a decreasing number of surviving people in a filthy swamp, confined to 1/3 of Prismeer for eternity, really that different from being nailed to a tree? Not that Oswen thinks that seemed like a fair punishment, mind you - it seemed rather cruel.

Either way, the course takes us near the stump and we'll doubtless be accosted. "Take us to your leader" perhaps is a new way to go, instead of intimidation or fighting. The water is good enough. We get board the skiff and push off. Orvil circles above as usual, checking for danger or points of interest.

D8->7. The water is lower than yesterday when we arrived at the island, and we don't know if it rises or falls, but we press on while we can, skipping breakfast at the island to take advantage of the conditions. After a couple of hours it is apparent that the water level is rising, but also seems to just be deeper here; we're headed roughly in the direction of the palace as well as the stump, so presumably where we were was, relatively speaki6/03/2024ng, on higher ground; and we would be descending as we head towards the distant mountains.

Looming up now, easily found with Orvil's help, is the flooded forest. Many trees have sadly died, leaves lost, due tot he marsh. Mangroves seem to be replacing it all. There seem to be fewer mushrooms around and more pools, not mud, probably permanent since we *were* on boggy ground anyway and now this is even lower, so most of the Oh Wells are probably above this level and can't drain it. It may even have been marshy ground, or filled with ponds, previously.

There are sunken structures. We see the top of a pretty, painted, gingerbread roof, above the water so it hasn't collapsed, though it's soggy now. Then another. Oswen, perception 17+1->18. One storey high small houses abound. A collection of six or seven, by the looks of it, at least; some now down to only bits of walls; a hamlet. Hedges, that probably once bore flowers, around gardens; a candy cane swingset. A whimsical, fun place, now drowned and lost.

Oswen looks at Kindle and catches his eye - this sort of thing affects him a lot. He's clearly very sad. All the lost joy. Hearths, family. Things that could have been. "We have to keep hoping Zybilna can fix it. That's all we have."

He grasps his amulet, saying a little prayer - in Halfling; Oswen recognises it, a blessing before meals usually for her. She heads back in the boat and hugs his leg as he rows, trying not to unbalance things. "We're going to do everything we can."

At the end of the second hour of travel, Orvil - adv (due to mist) stealth 18+3 -> 21! - has seen the huge tree stump close by. It rises a good 20ft above the waterline, dwarfing the tops of trees around it. It's very wide, too; maybe 80ft; a small Harengon-scale village is present, mostly made of tents, encircling a central communal area. Ladders hang off the side for access. There are numerous skiffs and rafts moored below. What's more, there are lots of walkways with planks raised just above the water, that connect out towards other small additional platforms, docking areas and lookouts. A maze of them! Around either side, a tangled mess of drowned trees and establishing mangroves which look treacherous and swampy. They've got natural defences and it will force us to approach via a well observed route. There are other stumps and mounds which a skiff could moor upon, at the edges, to get to the network of walkways - it's narrow and fragile, Kindle might have trouble! Finally, he spots about a dozen Harengon spread over the network, about half on the stump. Not too many. Most are probably out stealing!

As Orvil starts to convey this, Oswen asks Kindle to stop paddling for a minute so we can plan. We're about 500ft away from the main stump, but only 200ft from a nearby outermost stump - the most remote. 300ft of walkway to avoid breaking and hide in. And what if we *can* hide? We really want to see Agdon, and want to minimise the number of annoying brigands we have to convince along the way. Bel suggests hiding in the skiff since it looks like the other skiffs (and we think indeed was *from* this area, given the Harengon-style footprints we found on the hill). "I have a disguise kit with me" he says. "Oswen! How would you like to wear Harengon makeup?" Inafina raises and eyebrow but doesn't say anything. Oswen thinks this is the best idea in the world and is super into it!

Kindle pulls the boat in behind a nearby drowned tree for a bit of cover. Bel's apparently bottomless (but he assures us, not magical!) chest contains a complete disguise kit. He finds almost-Rabbit-ears, her hat helping to hide some of the rough edges; then applies (skill roll is 14) a reasonably passable Harengon painting effect on her face, complete with buck teeth! He paints her hands too. "You just have to keep your robe on, and over your feet". He shows her how to walk.

"Not bad!" she says, using the water to see her reflection. But she can't speak, as that breaks the illusion. "So Inafina - you're a strong warrior who's seen the tides changing in these lands and you've heard about Agdon's group. You and I have come to join them! We have the trinkets we found to exchange, and if it came to it, that special gold coin from the Carnival - but I feel like there might be more importance to that than meets the eye. I don't mind giving away the coins in that pouch either, if it helps."

Kindle has to curl up in the bottom of the boat. Bel hides next to him. Orvil is hidden away in his pocket dimension. We put a blanket over them and put the pouch on the edge. Inafina has to get us in! As close to the main stump as we can, so then we can climb.

Inafina ATHL 9-1, not her strong point. She's not rowed this before, only pushed the raft. It weaves in slowly, not very confident, but in the general direction of the stump. It takes a long time to close the distance which is nerve-wracking! About 100ft out from the stump, we're approached by another skiff, appearing out of the mist, some 25ft away from us. "Who are you? Wait. You? I've not seen you before!"

Inafina claims to be what we discussed. Deception only 9+2->11. He's not convinced. "I thought we'd met all the Harengon in the area!" he says. "And yet, here I am, large as life, stood in front of you!" says Inafina. "Where have you come from?" "We got pulled in. I used to work for the carnival, and ended up here somehow, and now I'm stuck and trying to make the best of it." Despite this being true, persuasion nat 1+2, fucks sake. A crossbow is raised! "That can't possibly be. **Bavlorna's the only one who is able to open the portals into the carnival. Her Lornlings are the only ones that she sends through her mirror portal to steal things and bring them back.** There's no way you could possibly be from the carnival".

Oswen produces the carnival coin, holding it aloft, not saying a word. Persuasion 16+0. They come closer. "That *is* a carnival coin! Oh my goodness! They're telling the truth!" - they become excited. "We must take them to Agdon immediately! But... You - you can't join us on the stump unless you give something for Agdon to tribute to Bavlorna." Inafina says, "We'd heard how you operate from others of your group, so I've come prepared" - and points to the pouch in the boat. They want it, so she hands it over. They look, then hand it back. "That'll do! Come with us."

Inafina follows (as best she can). We weave towards the base of the stump. It looks even more impressive up close. A few Harengon gather to gawk! Oswen drops down into the boat, feigning looking for something and whispers, "Too many eyes, you two might have to wait here - Bel - message me as often as you can. No answer means we're fine. An answer means, come and get us!"

There are rickety stairs where we are, which are easier to navigate. We're led up to the top. Perception Oswen 15, Inafina only 1+6! She has to do all the talking and she's rather large, and she really doesn't like lying, so she's distracted by trying to keep the ruse going. Oswen doesn't have to worry about speaking so can focus more on looking.

* Something brushes briefly against her, as if rushing past. Odd - but - not odd. Agdon!
* Oh! Her component pouch is missing. Agdon stole it! If he's *that* fast, battle might be next to impossible. She has no "hold person" kind of spells.
* A brief moment later, a nice smelling Harengon appears, walking beside her with a beautiful bright blue scarf. She casts minor illusion, just ahead, showing a young harengon holding a spell book. It's her way to quietly say "hello".

He says, "Oh. Hello? I guess you need this back then!" - he hands her the component pouch. "What do you have for me in return?" She hands him a scroll of Illusory Script, gambling that he won't know what it is. He looks at it. "Hmm. Is - hmm. Is this a magic book? A special spell?" She nods. He has it upside down - no magic abilities at all. She minor illusions writing in the air that then vanishes. "It must be difficult to cast spells when you're mute." Minor illusion of a sad Haregon pinned at the neck by a fallen tree branch. "I hate trees too! Trees are awful! They're the worst."

Deception adv., only 5,10+2 -> 12, so add charm D4, only a 1, but that's 13... Not the best. But it seems to make the difference. "I was trapped too. On this tree, right here! I was trapped by an evil witch because I would not let her take my glorious scarf. This scarf that I earned, because of my powers! I *stole* the thunderbolts right from under every thundercloud in the fey, and weaved it myself. Oswen Insight only 6, but Inafina - insight 21. He believes it, but it seems rehearsed. It's allegorical. She doesn't think the scarf is magical or special - it's not why he's fast.

"I'm Agdon! I am the prince of thieves!"

Oswen bows respectfully hoping that her ears won't fall out of her hat!

The other Harengon seems surprised that Agdon has found them. "We were just bringing them to you! They claim they're from - the *other world* - and **they didn't come through Bavlorna's mirror**." Oswen - to try and gain trust - actually *hands* Agdon the Carnival coin. He looks at it. "This *is* from the other world" - and surprisingly, luckily, he gives it back to her. "Now... What are you doing here? Can you speak?" to Inafina. "Yes, I can speak" - and she repeats the story about this being a cursed land and making the best of it.

"I don't think it's all that bad. We're allowed to do whatever we want, as long as you're with us - we can do anything we want! We've been given permission by Bavlorna. We just need to keep up our end of the bargain and she won't bother us. Speaking of which... Have you brought any plunder?" - Inafina hands over the pouch, complete with trinkets and she says, "Money too!" - but of course, we still have the handaxe.

Oswen hears "Pst! Pst! What's going on. There's nobody around. We're thinking we're going to make a run for it!" - but Oswen can't answer, because answering would mean trouble... So all she can do is be silent!

Agdon walks to the middle of the stump with the pouch. Other stolen things are scattered around. He looks at the contents then calls, "Bring me the tithing basket!" He empties out the trinkets and asks other Harengon for an opinion on which is the best. But then one says - "Hey! Hang on! That's *my* pouch!" and Inafina immediately knows what's going on and says, "It wasn't when you abandoned it, and your broken stiff, at that mound a few hours back. And you even broke the oar in frustration. Finder's keepers! That's fair game!" - persuasion 13+2; "Them's the rules!" nod some of the others. The tuning fork gains favour for Bavlorna. Into the basket it goes. Inafina takes back the now-empty pouch (but of course, it still has coins). She hands it back to the Harengon. "You should be more careful with the things you take." He looks concerned at this, "I don't have anything to give you..." thinks for a while "...but what about my sling?" and offers it. Inafina brightens up - that's a Fey trade - and says, "A fair trade! Thank you."

She now has a sling and some pellets.

Oswen hears another message. "You must be in trouble! You guys must be in trouble! We're coming to get you! Help is on the way!" - Oswen 'thinks' back in reply, "Stay where you are! We're fine!" then nudges Inafina and at her feet projects minor illusion of an *empty* skiff. Insight 2+5 -> 7; "Oh yes! We have your skiff too!" she says. Oswen has to resist facepalming (WIS save 22).

Inafina blissfully unaware proceeds with the plan. "So Mr Agdon, what drives you? What's in our future, this happy band of brigands?"

"Well! Once the Soggy Court murders itself into oblivion, there will be no other organised force in all of Hither and we will rule supreme! Then, we'll *demand* that Bavlorna give us the run of the place. She doesn't trust her sisters any more than they trust her. The Hourglass Coven is highly suspicious of itself. In fact we think **Endelyn Moongrave** has sent some of her **Darkling Agents** to Downfall, no doubt to steal something! As long as they're busy plotting against each other. *We* will have total dominion - unchecked, unbounded; and those Bullywogs have made a few balloons. I think we could take some and expand our reach beyond Hither!"

So he *does* want to escape but it's mostly just power, and a rather unhinged version.

Inafina nods and says, "That could work. But what do we do about - *that*..." (gestures at the swamp) "...it's a bit - *damp* isn't it? Do we stop the water? It'd be easier to move around..."

One Harengon blurts out that Thither is an enchanted forest. That way, they have dry ground and don't have to give a piece of what they take to Bavlorna anymore. Agdon says, "Quiet you!" - then more or less repeats the same thing - but Inafina says, "Well, that's not a *bad* plan, but forests - well, forests have a lot of trees you know. What about Yon?"

The noisy one says, "Nobody's been to Yon!" but Agdon claims to have been there. Wondrous and amazing. A city in the clouds. Insight 17. A total lie! He's never been.

"Hmm, that might be better - especially given you'll have balloons."

So we've no idea what's in Yon, but it was worth a try. And if Thither *was* a forest kingdom, it's probably a kind of Mirkwood by now, unless also turned into a swamp. Depends on what Granny Nightshade is into! Poisonous name, probably poisonous plants.

"A king as fast and cunning as you, Agdon, does not deserve to be trapped in a single domain. Especially a fragment of a domain such as this one. There are only so many people to rob, after all. Perhaps we should head to Downfall, and keep an eye on that court you mention; see if we can find Clapperclaw too, to help with directions, to get the jump on your plan to move across the mists?"

Deception with charm bless is only 14, but Agdon rolled low too. "That sounds like a plan! OK! I give you my permission to go through to Downfall."

Inafina beams and Oswen makes a minor illusion of a pile of treasure.

Agdon calls, "Bring the tithing basket" again! Two Harengon trudge off, again, to fetch it. "If you're going to Downfall, *you* can bring the basket to Bavlorna!"

Inafina says, "Ah! Our first mission for our king. It is an honour."

"A prince! I am not old!"

"My apologies, prince."

So Oswen and Inafina have to manhandle the clumsy, heavy basket, with at least one other Harengon present to help - Oswen is in close quarters; deception 16; her hat nearly slides but she notices it at the last minute to pull it back over the disguise ears. We reach the edge and have to take the stairs down. We get to the skiff; the Harengon hoists it into the skiff, right on top of Kindle and Bel! Both of them make a slight "oof!" noise, but good rolls mean they keep mostly quiet. Oswen is relieved that they stayed put. Inafina is even given another oar.

She hastily thanks them, unties and rows away as quick as she can! It's much easier with two oars.

"No! That way!" points one Harengon. Course correction! Oswen waves goodbye.

Oswen hears, "Can we come out now? It's really heavy!" - she says, "goodness, sorry!" and moves the basket and contents to help them out. "I appreciate your enthusiasm Bel, but I'm glad you stayed in the boat. That's what I tried to signal, Inafina! With the empty boat illusion. Sorry it wasn't too clear."

We fill the others in on what happened. We're through the toll, at least. Deep into Hither. We pass under a section of the Causeway, tall reeds and cattails growing. This must be always wet. The basket gives us an excuse to get to Downfall. This space under the causeway seems a good place to have a short rest.

### 100XP each => LEVEL 3

During the rest, we have something of a group heart-to-heart. During this, we notice that the plants around us seem to dull in colour and the air grow colder when we become sad, and vice versa. It seems this domain reacts that way and perhaps finding a way to cheer up people in Downfall might help loosen Bavlova's grip!

Oswen ritual-casts Detect Magic and examines the stolen goods. It's a ragtag mixture! Some stuff is worthless, but presumably the best that was found in each stolen "haul". Surprisingly, there is *nothing* magical. All items are mundane. But there are few interesting things... D100->27. 2d6->6.

* A few actual valuables, surprisingly.
* No gold but there's a rather beautiful-looking garnet; a pearl; carnelian; bloodstone; moonstone; quartz.
* Oswen, History 19+3->22. She assesses that these are worth between 25-100gp each!
* Some are smaller, and lower value.
* **She's really interested in the pearl as a spell component** and it looks like it might do the trick! She asks the group if she can take that one. It's stolen, so they don't see why not.
* Bel asks why we don't take them all. Oswen says she's not sure what Bavlova expects and perhaps if we turn up with too few interesting things, suspicions might be aroused. We don't know what "normal" looks like for a haul. Money is useful but only if you've got somewhere to spend it - she says, "well, Bel, you pick one more."
* He thinks a while and then decides to take the moonstone. Good choice! Oswen had considered that too. 

We paddle on. Bel thinks it's about an hour further, so even though we've not eaten - and it feels like it must be close to lunch time! - we continue.

Bel digs around in his chest and shares out a portion of rations, sort of as snacks. Then he looks at Oswen strangely; "you look more hale and hearty than you did when we first met!" Oswen is a bit surprised, but then looks at the group and says, "you know, maybe we all do? Perhaps this adventuring life suits us, strangely, even if we don't entirely suit it! Mind you, I still don't fancy fighting any more giant snakes any time soon."

The waters get very misty and really deep. Inafina tests the depth and the oar, held at the very tip, doesn't touch the bottom. The vegetation is very different; floating lily pads, lotus flowers. More large reeds, not many mushrooms. "This must surely have been a lake already" opines Oswen.

Through the mist, rough shapes can be just made out; low hills, bits of land, really large mangrove trees. The lake narrows down to a channel, perhaps once a river in or out of the lake before the flooding. We notice the water flows, pushing us; so this might've been an exit river once. Orvil flies ahead along the river to make sure there aren't any other rapids or other dangers. She asks him to keep within 100ft for now, looking through his eyes the whole time.

Soon, he sees a couple of bullywogs in a boat around a corner; there's also, a little further downriver, what looks like a very strong rope about 15ft above the river, from which hangs a lot of tattered and patchwork clothes, like a giant clothes line. He can hear croaking, talking, laughing; we decide to proceed. As we round the corner, the two bullywogs see us. Frog/toad bipedal humanoids. "Oh! Hello. Welcome to Downfall" says one, with a rather unnerving giggle added at the end. One wears a kind of guard uniform - leather armour and gloves, along with a leather helmet of sorts. It is paddling the boat with oars. The other - the one who called out to us - is sat back with a plate of grapes! They're dressed in a frilly-necked, but sort of shabby clothing. There's a master-servant to it all. They continue; "What are you doing here in Downfall today?"

"We are on important business! Agdon Longscard sends us with tributes for Bavlorna."

"Oh. The rabbit! Well, if you're here, King Gullop 19th would be honoured to your acquaintance; you'd best pull into the dock over there, then make your way past the balloon repair and over the stepping stones. Watch out for the middle one! I feel you probably have to go through the balloon factory - our thing, you know! Our great invention! A grand tour of the factory is mandatory... Then go over the bridge with the Chattering Heads. Don't mind them, they've always got an opinion! Then you'll get to the Grand Gazebo. At this time of day, his Royal Majesty will be holding court there."

Oswen nods a thanks - expecting this to all be a sort of trap! - and as instructed, we pull into the dock.

A bullywog is at the dock. "Oh. Hello!" "We got told to go and see the king..." "OK!"

Wow. They don't seem too on-alert here!

There's a huge balloon nearby. A strange cone seems to funnel bubbling gas coming out of the marsh into the bottom of the balloon. It inflates a bit, but slowly deflates and we hear gas escaping - so this is the repair balloon. Two bullywogs are climbing around on it, trying to find the hole. "It's... I've found another one!" and they're trying to stitch it up. We'd help, but Kindle is too heavy to climb the balloon.

We have to leave them to it and press on.

The stepping stones are reached quickly. Orvil flies over and counts 12 so which one is "the middle one"? He makes a guess. Oswen leads the way to two small ones that are about half way along. ATHL 17, no problem jumping the 2ft or so. Perception 19, the two are small but the next one is rounded on top. So perhaps it's slippy. She decides to go for the bigger of the two small side by side stones - no problem. She knows the next one will be difficult somehow - so takes a deep breath and jumps. DEX save, only 4+2! She's very wobbly, struggling to keep balance; the stone is moving. She jumps back one (ACRO 14). The stone in front is making grumbling noises then exclaims, "goodness!". Oswen lands on the previous stone only to find Bel there - he almost falls but just makes a sideway jump to the other small rock.

"So rude! Stepping on me. Not even asking."

Oswen says, "I'm most terribly sorry, please forgive me, I didn't know you were there! We were only told that one of the stones was difficult and I though just meant slippy."

"Difficult?! I can't believe they called me difficult. And to think I got these stones to line up so they could cross over."

"You did this?"

"Yes!"

"That's very clever."

"Hmph. Do you want to cross?"

"Well - if we haven't offended you too much..."

"No. It's fine. Which bank?"

She points. It speaks Primordial; Oswen just hears sounds of grinding and crashing boulders! The rocks start moving and deposit us on the opposite bank.

"Thank you very much!" says Oswen. "Is there something we can give you in return?"

"No, that's fine - you gave me an apology. Nobody gives apologies any more. They're all so rude, even though they pretend to be polite! I'm glad to help you! But stay out of the water. There are **Merrows** about. They attack anyone who falls in!" - and the stone sinks back into the water. (This was **Galeb Duhr**, a rock elemental, but we don't learn that until general conversations much later on).

"Bel, what's a Merrow?" "Foul-tempered sort of fish people! They're cannibals." "Goodness! We'd better not fall in." "I've only ever heard terrible things about them!"

Inafina smells burning wood. "A fire. Up ahead." - we investigate. She leads us to the right and we see three, round, huts made of wood, brick and mud. Smoke is rising out of the roof and windows of one, crackling and glowing inside! Oswen says, "I wonder if someone's in trouble!" and rushes forward, up the stairs and to the doorway. A 25ft high ceiling; seems to be a huge workshop. It might even be the balloon factory! A bullywog is stood with a bucket of water trying to put out a fire. Oswen immediately runs in and starts using prestidigitation around the edges and calls back for help. People splash on what water they can.

It's a mess. Scattered and broken shelves, wisps of smoke curling up from smouldering wreckage some of which suddenly bursts back into flame. Oswen has to keep re-casting spells to keep it down.

The bullywog is in a big leather apron running around the room in a terrible fluster. He's speaking Sylvan, Oswen realises. "Quick! Grab a bucket! We have to make sure the fires stay out!" - there are three other wooden buckets. Kindle puts down the tithe basket just outside the door and gets to work. Bel does the same. They have to run back out to re-fill from the swamp. Inafina pauses a moment; why do thinks keep re-lighting? Insight 14 (plus high passive perception). Tiny embers seem to be hopping around in little groups, then hiding! They run over to wood and set it on fire. "Oh!" she calls out. "Some kind of little fire imp or something - look! They're lighting the fires for fun!" The bullywog says "Put some water on them and see what happens!" but Oswen calls out in Sylvan, "Hey you lot, you've had your fun, but please stop now, we're getting tired!"

Lucky persuasion roll 19. They stop moving around and then jump towards her. Wow. They're sort of animated coals! Six of them. They bounce up to her and speak. Tiny little high pitched voices, hard to hear... She can't quite make it out. She calls in Orvil. He's smaller and has better perception, so perhaps he can get in close. He's reluctant but comes in and listens. ADV perception 17. "We were told we could run around. We got taken from the cauldron, from the others. We were put here and told it was time to have fun! Put everything on fire! Put everything on fire!" Oswen hears that via Orvil and says back in Sylvan, "Well, thank you, it seems like you did have fun. Shall I take you back to the others at the cauldron now?" "Yes yes yes!" - but they look like they want Oswen to carry them. She asks if there's a metal bucket or pan she can borrow. Kindle has a pot, so the coals are ushered into that. Oswen asks the bullywog, "where's the cauldron?!" "On the other side of the lake! Goodness..." - he finishes putting out fires.

"Oh my. Well. Thank you! Thank you for helping. I'm **Duke Ickrind**. I'm overseeing the repair of the factory but these new fires keep popping up. It's scared everyone else away. They caught one of the saboteurs! The other one got away in a balloon and *stole* things! Stole things from the cottage! Everyone's in trouble now." "Bavlorna's cottage?" "Yes! The witches cottage. The hag. They stole a balloon! But we caught one of them. A former Knight Of Warts, I believe!" Oswen perception 18+1. As he says that, Oswen realises that Bel has snuck away. Then a Message. "I can't go in there!" She thinks back, "Yes, I just realised! Keep hidden! We'll be out in a minute."

Well, the coals need returning. And apparently the king needs seeing. Oswen asks, "How long does it take to get to the cauldron from here?" "You're new here." "Yes!" "I guess... The easiest way would be to paddle in a boat all the way to the other side. It's kind of that way!" - he points. "Or, I guess, you could go the long way around if you didn't have a boat. You'd have to cross the bridge with the heads and the royal gazebo, the proving grounds and the sinking palace, past Big Barkless and the toadstool patch; and it's sort of on the lakeside near all of our huts - near Noble's Rise." "Thank you. We do have a boat but we're headed in the direction you describe anyway! We'll take the long route."

He says, "Well if you're new to town you'll have to see his Royal Majesty..." - he takes out a big brass broach shaped like a fly with green glass wings that flutter. "If you're going to see the King, put this on! It will help win the king's favour." "Thank you so much!" It seems reciprocity is alive in Downfall. He starts fussing over the mess and cleaning up as we leave.

Outisde, Bel says he thinks it was the cage that was "stolen" - or more to the point, the people inside it rescued. The fires were used as a distraction. We'll have to be on our guard, the King might recognise Bel! As might anyone else. Is it time for the disguise kit? Then Oswen realises she still looks like a Harengon, but has been talking and nobody seems to care. "Eating rubbed off a lot of the makeup", says Inafina! So Oswen gives back the ears and uses Prestidigitation to clean up. Back to herself. Meanwhile, Bel starts painting himself to look rather different. "We need to call you something different" says Oswen "in case they recognise your name." "Yes... How about... Bigtop!" "Makes sense, we're all from the Carnival now. Bigtop it is!"

He finishes his disguise. Orvil has been flying around and sees another of these strange clothes lines on the far side of the huts. It's headed towards where the other one was, but at an angle. Perhaps both lines are tied off to some kind of post out there in the mist. They seem *very* sturdy though - it might be something very different that they're for...

Orvil asks the coals to just be a bit patient, it's quite a long way to the cauldron. She asks if they're cold? But they curl up on top of each other and basically "go to sleep", turning cold anyway. OK then!

So now, it seems we should continue on the way to see the King.

Inafina moves around the huts, on the other side of the "factory" to find a wood plank bridge. Quite long. She starts crossing then realises that there are numerous wooden spikes, stuck into the lake bed, with bullywog heads mounted on top! In the middle of the bridge, is a scarecrow, sat facing the heads, feet dangling off the edge. The heads are all arguing with each other and gossiping! As far as Oswen can gather, these used to be kings and are debating whose rein was most glorious. One was apparently in power only 4 days - another only 3! They must have reached "...the nineteenth" quite quickly.

Inafina takes a close look at the scarecrow hands. Crab pincers! This is Clapperclaw.

He turns, sees us, cowers a bit and seems to not look at us. It rattles strangely, like coins or something. Oswen asks Bel to Message the scarecrow, "We know the heads are listening. We are friends. You must be Clapperclaw. Is there anywhere we can talk?" It thinks back "Yes! Am I in trouble?" But Clapperclaw speaks with a young girl's voice and sounds very embarrassed. The place to talk is back the way we came. Too many bullywogs in the royal gazebo. So Oswen gets Bel to message, "OK, lead the way!" Out loud, Clapperclaw says, "I'll be back all of you! Don't get into any trouble while I'm away!"

We retreat back a distance, hidden behind the big factory hut. The voice that Clapperclaw speaks with isn't the same voice that Clapperclaw has in his head. Oswen says, "Did Bavlorna steal something of yours?" "Bavlorna? No, no, not at all. No, well, I escaped here. And I was minding my own business and going to make a new life here, away from evil Granny Nightshade, then this awful rabbit knocked me down and stole my head! His brigands wouldn't give it back to me, and when I pleaded with them, they gave me this... This pumpkin with coins in it!" - he's very ashamed. "I had the most glorious head. It was this beautiful stag's head, with the most beautiful antlers!"

Oswen says, "That's awful. We're looking for stolen things and think we might know where to find them. We'll certainly keep an eye out for your head."

"If you found it I'd be in your debt but I don't know what I could give you?"

Oswen thinks a minute and says, "Well, once we've done everything we need to here, we will need to get to either Thither or Yon. It sounds like you want to avoid Granny, though! So perhaps, Yon, if you know the way?" She's not being too persuasive though - nat 9 - perhaps mentioning Granny was a bad move. Bel steps in to try and smooth the way; persuasion 19; Clapperclaw admits he doesn't know the path to Yon but *does* know the path to Tither. He hates Granny who's very evil and bad, but "she created me! Well, created this. She stole my soul from **Gehenna**..." (a place) "...I died a violent death when I was six. I was a young girl. I was a soul in this firey place, the pits where people go if they die violently - or so I was told - but she stole me from there and put me into this, this, *thing* she had made, all put together from parts, and well - she made me do all these evil things in the forest. I didn't want to do them anymore. I found the path while I was helping her - I don't know if many people know about it, it's a secret. It connects Hither and Thither and you don't need either of their permissions to go between them! I can take you through the mists along this path. But I wouldn't go any further with you."

"That's OK. If we find your head, then, that's what you can do for us - show us the path, but you don't need to go any further."

"I would like that. I'm going to go back and keep the heads company now."

We go with *her*, to cross the bridge. And there we are - just like that - the king's gazebo. It's grand! Well, it was once... Made of marble, it is situated atop a mound of soggy earth. The white stone is streaked with algae in parts, though, and one of the supports seems to have sunk a bit, leaving the canopy slightly askew. Marble steps lead up to an area with numerous red and gold throw pillows. All around are Bullywugs dressed in big gowns, white laced tunics, big frills and so-on. A Soggy Court indeed.

A particularly fat, flabby Bullywug with a tall crown of woven lily flowers sits atop a dais, cross legged, wearing a top with huge puffy sleeves. He is flanked by two knights and has a large, leather-bound book across his lap. He mouths words as he reads from the pages. Next to him is a tiny crocodile wearing a frilly collar!

At our approach, he doesn't even look up but starts to speak. "Ahem. Hmm. Have you no herald to announce your presence before the great, grand, first and last King Gullop the Nineteenth?" - he slams the book closed, causing most of the guards to jump to attention! He looks at us, licks his eyes; "Oh. Very peculiar. You should have a herald! You too are royalty of sorts." His eyes narrow. "I can't say I've ever heard of you. But surely you've heard of me."

Oswen bows deeply. "Oh great king, your name is known across the land!"

"Well - Oh - well - of course I am! Yes! Thank you. Let me introduce you to members of the court!"

We are introduced to various people with what are probably all fake titles. Earls, lords, barons. There's also his advisor, the "Croaking Sage". "Welcome to the soggy court!"

We all bow and Oswen says, "Thank you sire, you are most gracious. It is no surprise you have not heard of me - I am not nearly so famous in any land as you."

"Well, you are the most polite, *most* polite that I have met in a long time. Snoodle likes you too!" - the crocodile, we guess. He calls out; "This is not how you treat honoured guests! The rule of hospitality! Goodness, please! Hurry! Bring something!"

People somewhat lazily fetch some big goblets. Some strange smelling, probably off alcohol is poured. Mushroomy, but alcoholic so probably safe (after a fashion). As these are poured, D4->3. Inafina notices that the wine goblet she has been passed was poured by differently. She was given a goblet, but the person waits and looks at her... Insight 15; the person wants to pour the wine but is trying to delay it and looking at her frantically and looking at the goblet. She looks inside. Perception dirty 20. A scrap of paper rolled up; she quickly takes it; with relief the wine is poured. Inafina goes to Oswen as if to toast. "Cheers, your majesty" and uses the clank of goblets as a pretence for handing the paper. SOH 16. Now Oswen has it... She turns to Bel and says "The great King has given us a gift. In return, I think we should regale him with your music!" Bel, with a glint in his eye, puts down his chest, gulps his wine - grimaces subtly - takes out his dulcimer and starts to make a big show of it.

This gives Oswen a chance to check the note. It's in Sylvan. "Find **Illig** the **Baron of Muckstump** at once! The revolution lives on!"

Interesting...!

Bel plays on. WIS save; he's had an idea... Yes! It's a great idea. He plays an Enthralling Performance. At the end, a few minutes later, Kindle - with his high passive insight - and Inafina, too - both realise that Bel has been very naughty! He has in fact *charmed* the King.

While it happens, Oswen, perception nat 20+1 (bit of a waste); she looks for the person who poured Inafina's wine. They are motioning at the King's book, then sneak away.

Oswen takes advantage of the King's apparently good humour after that, "Great King, we wonder if we would be permitted to stay a while in this wonderful town of yours."

"Of course! You are welcome to anything in the Soggy Court. You have proven yourself! And in fact - you have literally proven yourself! You bear the favour of the duke even! You're really making friends and a bit of a name for yourself! I should be careful - you might be after my crown next!"

Oswen laughs, "Ah, I start to understand why your name is so widely know given your sense of humour. Of course, a head so small as mine could never hope to bear a crown so large."

He invites her to sit with him on a big pillow next to him. Oswen feigns delight, takes a *small* sip of wine and sits. Bel moves on to other tunes. The king starts to lean in and almost conspiratorially says - at first loudly - "You have the most wonderful musician in your entourage. None of the people here could play music like that" but then quietly - "I am very afraid! I fear for my life. Everything is going wrong!" - loudly, "Bring more wine!" - and so-on... Fully paranoid, afraid of his head! Given the nearby bridge, that's not too surprising. He confesses that the escaping and stealing recently was a particularly bad moment... He thinks there were two satyrs! Bavlorna likes to capture Satyrs, we should be careful with ours, especially one so talented. "This book! I did not mean to have this book. I bought it from the Darkling merchant, from Charms. Trinket, Bauble and Charms! Why did I ever let them park themselves up here? I didn't know it would be *this* book." He points. "**The Big Book Of Bad Blood**". He opens the cover and motions at the front page. "**All the people I hate and all my enemies**" - and it is *signed Bavlorna*. "Would you - would you do me a favour?" he asks. Oswen says, "Great king, it would be an honour." "This book! Take this book. Give it back to Bavlorna. Give it back! Just... Just tell her that I didn't steal it! I realised it had been taken from her and I've done everything in my power to get it back. Something stolen being returned."

Oswen nods. "She will surely recognise the wisdom in you taking care to find someone you trust to take it back to her." She whispers too - "I doubt you could trust too many in the court!" "No! No! I'm sure that Count Illig is out to try and usurp my throne. He hasn't turned up for court today. He must be plotting!" He hands Oswen the book. "Do me this favour and I will grant you a favour in return when you complete the task. Come back and name what you desire." "Very well."

She puts the book in her backpack.

As the king tries to distract the court, we sense our cue to leave. We sneak off, carrying on the course we were following, given the Duke's description of a route and figuring we might bump into Illig along the way.

* Do we read the book, or return it for favour, or what?
* Do we find Illig and try and stage a revolution to overthrow the king, or keep his favour?
* Do we need a balloon if we have Clapperclaw?

We continue and reach a kind of fork. That's a strange - well, it looks like a tree, perhaps a banyan tree once, but where the trunk is a building! It's foggy so Oswen can't see much. At the front of the building are two bullywugs and crocodile!

Oswen shrugs and goes to talk to the Bullywogs. "A royal visitor! You have come to the sinking palace." "Do you wish quarters?" "No, thank you, we are just passing through". "This is the sinking palace, where the king and his closest subjects live. On the other side are the Royal Pools and the Royal Docks which can ferry you to the other side of Downfall."

We're invited in. There are three connected circular rooms with various bullywog knights and nobles. Beyond is a pool, for swimming; crocodiles appear to be guards.

Oswen tries something - people are sat around gossiping. "Have you heard have Bavlorna is angry after the balloon was stolen?" "Yes of course! She's livid!" Conspiratorial whispers "...The king had better watch out. This could be exactly the thing that pushes her over the edge and gets rid of him, making room for the next person!" "But is there a Gullop 20th to take his place?" "No!" "So who would it be?" "It could be anyone crafty enough... Someone the first! Someone the third! The ninth! Depends on who it is." We hear that the 19th is meant to be very powerful, he *boiled* his predecessor...

Some think he's not a good ruler. **He's only been in power for four days!** An important person escaped, saboteurs set fire to the factory and a balloon got stolen. *And* he allowed "that storm balloon to moor up and set up shop" "What's a storm balloon?" asks Oswen. "It's right there! Moored next to this island, right next to the jail." "Is that what the ropes are for?" "The ones with clothes? No! The balloon is moored with ropes, but not those. *Those* go to Bavlorna's cottage. Surely you've seen it." "Too foggy! We're not too good with fog. Not as good as I'm sure you are..."

They continue, "It's odd; she usually comes and lords it over everyone on her lilypad but she hasn't left her cottage in days. The last thing we saw was that Darkling merchant, from the Storm Balloon, the older one, heading towards the cottage."

Oswen says "But I heard those were sent by Bavlorna's rival, Endelyn." "We don't know anything about that and don't want to get involved!" Oswen goes conspiratorial too. She asks if they'd better off without Bavlorna, but they were given dominion over this whole land by her and *think* they're going to have dynasties that will rule for thousands of years. So they if not like her, seem to think owe her a debt. Oswen asks, "What was the price of that gift?" "We are her subjects. She is the fey ruler of this realm. We are the city that has grown up around her keep, so to speak!"

"You've all been very hospitable, thank you. We need to continue to the proving grounds - do you know where they are?" "Of course, they're right outside! I don't think anything is on until later though. Some of the prisoners escaped, so now we don't have anyone to fight **Morgort**. She's the only one in a cell." "So Morgort is a prisoner herself?" "She was one of the saboteurs! She will likely be sentenced to death by combat in the proving grounds. We could do with some nice entertainment!"

We politely exit and follow the path around to what seems to be the jail. Oswen opines, "I don't think I like these bullywugs too much - they all seem a bit bloodthirsty! I suppose they can't be *all* bad, but those nobles weren't that nice. This is the jail? Does the door open?" - she tries it. She walks straight in.

There are two cells. One has a puddle of water; the other, with a very sad-looking Bullywug wearing rags, is - we presume - Morgort. Oswen says "Psss! Morgort!" - the Bullywug looks up. Thick mangrove roots appear to serve as bars of this strange jail. A small round door seals off the cell. The pool in the other cell is very smelly, stagnant and bad. Morgort seems frail. "What do you want?" "We heard you tried to burn the factory. With these!" - Oswen shows the coals. Margot says "I do not regret anything! The night of warts! Do what is right and what is just!" "What is the Knight Of Warts?" "*I* am the Knight Of Warts! I am driven by my heart. I do not regret helping the faerie dragon who is a noble soul. Balorna is the real enemy!"

Bel steps forward. "Do you remember me?" "You must not be here! Why have you come back?!" and we figure she sees through his disguise pretty easily. Oswen says, "Because we agree with you. And we want to do something about it. And we wonder how to get you out of here..." "Wait, where - where's Sir Talavar and the faerie and Wigglewog?" - we tell the story.

Bel tries his best to tell the story and ease the news of Wigglewog's passing (persuasion 21).

Morgort is crestfallen. "Then... That makes my mind up. I was afraid of the proving grounds, but now I know that no matter what happens, he will be waiting for me. I do not fear passing through to the Golden Mud!"

Oswen says, "There can be honour in passing and yes, you might meet those who passed before you, but do not seek that! For every person who lives is a person who can threaten Bavlorna."

Kindle asks, "Surely we're not leaving her here?"

Oswen doesn't want to. "But if we take her, they'll look..."

"What if she were to escape?"

"Maybe we could make it look like that" agrees Oswen. Morgort says she'd leave Downfall. We ask her about Illig; he's opposed to the king, but only because wants to become king himself. He doesn't share "our cause". He wants to depose Gullop for "his own reasons". We learn that since we have the king's favour, we can certainly get to Bavlorna's door.

Morgort knows of nobody else except Wigglewug who were trying to help Sir Talavar.

Oswen insight 17. She realises that with the general amount of scullduggery and treachery, it's entirely believable for someone to have freed her who worked for any of the factions. A plan forms.

* We leave, loudly talking about how it'll be fun to see Morgort fight at the proving grounds.
* Fog Cloud is cast as we go.
* We sneak back in and free her.
* We escape while the cloud holds.

Oswen examines the door, but investigation only 7, can't see a way to open it. Inafina sees that the lock is pickable (investigation 15). The mangrove roots are made of wood, so if you could control plants you could do something, or burn them - but *that* would look like magic and point at us immediately. Morgot wonders if the merchant in the storm balloon might have something?

We know that the merchant isn't great... Kindle suggests he can cast Silence as a ritual but it'll take a while, then chop at the roots with the axe. Non-magical means. We'd have to distract the palace while that happened. "Bel, perhaps another performance? Nobody recognised you last time!" Bel will have to Message him frequently to see if he's finished.

Oswen and co return to the palace as a distraction. The combat should be good we claim - as a prelude to Bel singing songs of giant snakes and some made-up things! Performance 16. In between songs he checks with Kindle to try and get feel for how long it'll be. Once Kindle is through the bars, we'll nonchalantly head back that way, Oswen casts Fog Cloud and we use it to cover our escape. Fog is not unusual here.

It doesn't go that way. Bel's distraction is successful, but while he works, Kindle discovers that the piers at the palace will give us a way to travel across the lake if we walk onto them. But there's another pier, behind the jail and *that* is what the Storm Balloon is moored to. Once he's got the bars open he goes to look, and he returns, Morgot has made good her mistake. When Bel messages, he tell us about the newly found pier and we meet there. We approach the balloon.

It's a big, black balloon. Underneath is the basket which seems to be - well, a shop. There's a sign, "Wonders Wares and Fair Fares". The balloon itself appears to be a storm, not material, somehow contained by the wires and ropes. The shop seems open so we go in.

Two small, purple-skinned goblinoid, very slight creatures are inside. We've never seen anything like them before. A sign says "Available for a limited time only!" - and there's a list of things. There are various shelves and tables with mundane things for sale; it seems a regular merchant shop. The two creatures introduce themselves as Trinket and Bauble. They seem to have a fair bit of attitude... They draw our attention to the 'special things', but these aren't for purchase with gold. What, then? "Payment depends on the item! Each item deserves its own form of payment."

* Dusk Mallow Pie with decorative bite marks
* Ink portraits (magical paper) within frames, that rearrange when looked at to whoever is looking
* Moonlight Monocle for those who struggle in the dark
* A bundle of dry wood, great for starting fires!
* A mug of Bumble Beer, a "very sharp" flavour
* A very good thimble - fingertips not provided (provide your own).

We can't buy any other special items - only the stuff on the board - until their boss "Charm" comes back. Oswen examines the monocle - Arcana 1, then nat 20 + 5 -> 25. Essentially it provides Darkvision; but it's a monocle, which is unusual. What payment is required for that? "I would need all the colour from your eyes!"

Oswen also asks about Thieve's Tools. Available for gold, as lock-picks, small hammers and such neatly packed into a handy box! 25gp though.

They do have magical inks. In conjunction with her awakened spellbook, it would allow her to copy the Darkvision scroll pretty quickly, but that'd cost ~90gp! (We consider the quill to effectively give a 10% reduction in required cost). Bel is willing to trade the Moonstone to fund the inks and tools. Oswen's going to owe him for that... "It's fine" he says, "My mission is to help! I just wanted this because it was pretty."

We're look at 125gp, but trading the moonstone. Bel tries to haggle! It seems part of how he's built - any time price was brought up he was already saying things about how it should probably be less! Persuasion 24. It's agreed that we can have the inks and tools for 100gp. So, in the end, they just trade the moonstone.

One comes to Oswen intent on getting her to buy the monocle! Her eyes are brown and says brown is a colour he doesn't have. It feels like a dodgy deal! "You don't have brown" asks Oswen. "No! Not *this* brown!" "That must make it quite a special brown." "They're all equal!" "Well then, I guess you wouldn't want to trade my eye colour for something *else*, then." "Like what?" "Let us know a *weakness* of Bavlorna." The other comes up and holds up the ink portrait, trying to sell this to Bel. "You could always look at this picture of yourself!" "I don't want to give you the colour of my eyes!" "No! You only need to give me your sense of rhythm!"

This is *definitely* our cue to leave. Whatever their game is, it's not to our advantage. Fey gifts and trades are often too tricky. As politely as we can, we try to bow out. They point out that once the boss is back, they're away! "Limited time only!" they shout after us.

Bel takes the Thieve's Tools. He's got good dex, Jack Of All Trades and expertise in SOH!

We return to the palace and a find a corner for Oswen to transcribe either the Darkness or Darkvision scroll. Oswen was leaningt towards Darkvision but Kindle reveals he can grant that, for a limited time, as an ability he has. With that in mind, she goes for Darkness instead. Could come in handy - especially given that Fey is rarely fully dark, so there might not be too many people with Darkvision around (and that often doesn't work in magical darkness anyway). Could help cover an escape better than Fog Cloud.

We realise that the various piers beyond the swimming pool aren't all piers - one is very low, almost submerged, but as fog clears briefly, we see it's a long low bridge that connects to the other side. Off we go! Let's see what lies over there (we still have to return the coals!)

While crossing, we see through a gap in the fog, a crazy-looking old villa that seems to hover in the air - but really it's just because it seems to balance on a column atop a well, like one of the Oh Wells, with wooden stairs that go around it, up and out to the house. The big "clothes lines" attach to it.

Ahead of us is a very big tree with very pale white wood. That must be Big Barkless! A clothes line is attached to Barkless, too. Are the clothes lines stabilising the strange house? They're not taut. Inafina perception 7, can't see much. Oswen, nat 20 + 1 perception; slight chills... On the clothes line attached to Big Barkless, she sees two small frog-like creatures with huge eyes and strange slimy skin crawling along the line towards the tree. When they get nearby the jump down and run off; Oswen has seen these things before, at the Carnival - one of the three thieves (of which Sowfoot was one). A lornling, a strange small misshapen clone of Bavlorna herself.

It seems she can only trust clones of herself to of her bidding!

We get to the other side and look around the tree. Inafina goes "ow!" suddenly. She takes 1 piercing... from four or five pinpricks - Kindle points to a hollow in a tree; giggling, four heads pop up, tiny; sprites with wings who have tiny little bows and a sling. They start yelling insults and fired the bows. They're goading us to get close, so we don't want to get close! We ignore them and carry on around.

Inafina hears (passive perception) hears strange, haunting music - and feels gold. Then the rest of us start to feel it. A strange chill. Loneliness. The tune is being played on a flute, from a field of oversized toadstools ahead of us. Oswen decides to investigate and creeps closer.

There's a very sad looking wood elf, sat amongst the toadstools. He plays the flute. He has pale *blue* skin and black hair. The toadstools around him seem colourless and grey. We've seen this before - sadness emanates from him. "Hello, I'm Oswen" says Oswen. "What has made you said?"

He says "I am Octavian" - but nothing else

Bel comes up to Oswen and encourages her to keep trying. Oswen ADV persuasion, only 4,12+0 -> 12. "You will only feel sad if you stick around with me! Everything is blue. There is no future where the colour will flourish. Beware the wicked hag! She's not to be trusted."

Oswen says, "No, she's to be defeated. That's why we're here!" and casts a minor illusion of brightly coloured flowers in front of Octavian; but as it appears, it immediately loses its colour. Fascinating! "I'm sorry! That's me! I cause that because I have no heart." "Did Bavlorna steal it?" "Well, I made a deal with her..." Bel encourages him to speak - offering to trade stories or songs. Bel discovers that:

* Octavian used to love - a wood elf, but a brush with the fey and he saw how rich emotion could be
* He sought out the greatest of all emotions - love; he says his own people don't love openly and freely
* He did! But he ignored the wisdom of his elders - elves live too long; the people he loved, lived only bright but short lives.
* "Everything I have loved has left this world before me. I can scarcely even remember the bittersweet sorrow that accompanies that loss."
* That's because he can no longer feel; laden with the loss he struck the deal.
* Bavlorna "helped" by replacing his still-beating heart with that of a goat!
* He can no longer feel; he is closed off to the world of all feeling.
* "My heart, she has; what she's doing with it - I know not! But she's using it as a source of power, I am sure, for it was a very rich heart."
* Now the only emotion he (thinks he) can show is sadness.

"The thing is, she didn't even trick me! She asked for my still-beating heart and I refused her; I told her no. She insisted that this was the only way and still I said no - then as punishment she took it by force and replaced it with this goat's heart that not only cannot feel, but is wrapped in magic and will not let me die."

He can't even get angry about it! Just sad.

He asks for our help. He says he knows of a way to undo the curse, but we have to get the heart back. Oswen says, "We've made quite a few promises the last few hours - and so I'll make another, but make it the same way as the others - all I can say we'll try, and I promise we'll do our best."

He says he knows he should feel joy and is grateful but can't really feel anything more.

We continue on. There's a small hut; Oswen knocks; no response; she tries the door handle; the door opens - then a *terrible* smell comes out. She sees a small chest, and scattered around are 6 fraying silk cushions. There's a stench of decaying fish. A lit brazier hangs from a rafter.

Oswen examines the chest; nat 20+1; it's not trapped; she opens it; inside, the source of the smell! It is filled with cookware, spices, some old fish bones and - a mummified toad. It's magical in some way. She uses her spellbook to fast-cast Identify.

Words appear in the spell book. Strong aura of evocation steeped into the toad. If the toad is thrown into a pot of water or other liquid, it would cast a Darkness spell centred on the toad! How curious. This isn't hers to take and the Fey has rules which she's not in the mood to break. Since there's nobody here, she has to leave it. Sigh. Just another mystery.

Onward. Another small bridge. Oswen, perception 19+1->20. There's a watchtower - it overlooks the inlet we came in on, and the clothes line hangs from there. We'd seen the line but not the tower before due to the fog. There's a mound with a bit of smoke on the end of a rising promontory. Ah! The cauldron! We get a better look at Bavlorna's cottage too. A balcony with door is set into the steep, pointy roof at the top. There are stairs and balconies along the side including one facing us with *cages* having off wooden beams. Bel shudders - "That's where we were kept". One beam is present without a cage. Perhaps that's the one from the recent escape!

Oswen is distracted by the cauldron for now, ignoring the huts; she runs up, excited, the others in tow.

A bulbous, greenish-black cauldron with a thick lid sits above a bed of hot coals on six sturdy iron legs. A wooden handle hangs from a lanyard on the lid. It's over 3ft tall and more than 5ft in diameter and very hot. Oswen gets the coal bucket and asks, "Are you awake?" - the coals stir into life, starting to glow. "What is it?!" "I think we're here" "Let us out!" - so we set down the pail next to the cauldron. They hop excitedly into the pile - and all the other coals start jiggling around too!

A tongue of flame extends from under the cauldron and starts to take shape. A voice speaks; "Hullo - you've brought them back - thank you! My name in **Min** - what is yours?" "Oswen" "Well it is a pleasure to meet you Oswen. Thank you for bringing them back" "My pleasure. Are you heating Bavlorna's cauldron?" "That's her cauldron yes. I'm just a Magmin who keeps things warm. She put me here then forgot about me, so I look after the coals now! Why is that?" "Well, we were hoping to convince Bavlorna to leave and let Prismeer return to normal." "I see... Well... That might be quite difficult!" - Oswen persuasion 14 - "I think others have tried to escape her. But to defeat her? I wouldn't know anything about that. To kill her, you mean?" "Oh, I don't know about that! Just hoping she'd leave and let things return to normal. We don't really have a plan yet!" "Yes! Well I guess you could get her to leave - she'd return to the safety of one of her sisters. You'd need to destroy the holds she has here; the reasons to be here. Hmm. Maybe - maybe we could burn the whole of the land down, then she'd have no reason to stay? Say! You wouldn't happen to have any dry wood, would you? I haven't heard the sound of dry wood burning in a long time. I love that sound." Oswen says "I think we can get some..." "I can't really leave the cauldron; these coals are very naughty and if I don't watch them they'd get up to mischief." "Yes, we need to find you something else to look after and keep warm, so the cauldron can go cold; that'd be one less reason to stay. And maybe burn those ropes!" - the Magmin also warns us not to touch the lid, it has a password. He'll tell us if we find dry wood!

Inafina and Oswen try to find some wood. Oswen remembers the unoccupied wood - the hut itself is dry and was in some degree of disrepair, with some parts just lying around (adv survival, Inafina 19). We come back and present it - "is this any good?"

The Magmin hugs the bundle, smiling. It ignites and crackles. He seems delighted! "OK! So the password is **Spittlespew**". Bel tries to get more information - what's this cauldron to Bavlorna, why's it important? We don't get much. The password releases the lid, else the cauldron runs away. "If you have anything you can put her stew into, it's quite important - it will turn whoever drinks it into either a giant frog, or a giant dragonfly, for one hour!"

We're not sure we like the idea of using a hag's stew but perhaps for *us* if we need to fly, perhaps? So, we use the password, Kindle uses a rag to lift the lid, Oswen drinks the last of her water bottle; she fills it with stew. It's one potion-worth (essentially Polymorph). We don't know if we'll get frog or dragonfly!

We've not done a great job of convincing the Magmin to open up, so we move on. We investigate the two huts left - one is signed King's Mount and inside a Bullywug is arguing with a giant toad! In the other hut, we hear whispering, hushed discussions. No windows in the hut. She knocks on the door - the whispering stops! The door opens a crack - "Yes, can I help you?" - a bullywug - on a gamble, Oswen shows the note we were given. The bullywug's eyes open wide and we're hurried inside, nervously!

A group of bullwugs are gathered around noble. This must be Baron Illig. Aside from the one who opened the door, bullywugs Gullibek, Voolp and Grundelkratz each introduce themselves to us. "We knew that the moon and stars are all working in our favour! The time is now!" says one. Illig makes a speech starting, "Muckstump and its allies - the loyalists" (and we learn the fourth name now, Glorik). He has a plan! Under a rug on the floor is a crude drawing of Gullop and an arrow at one aye and a dagger in the other, from four people approaching. The idea is to pretend to be very sorry for lateness; they'll pretend to trip! A dagger will be thrown; he'll die. Our arrival distracts him and he's scared of other things. The time is now, they claim!

Oswen notices a large wooden crate behind Illig with Bavlorna's name written on it in Sylvan. She points and asks "What's that? It says 'Bavlorna'". "Yes! Yes! Offering. I am smart! When I kill the bad king, I will bring this to Bavlorna as an offering. I know what she likes!" - he opens it; a rolled up cape of moss; a heavy crossbow, a hunting trap, lots of woodland animal carcasses. "I know Bavlorna is excellent if amateur taxidermist! She loves to receive animals and she creates things with them. She has a gallery of taxidermy. I will win her favour! It will legitimise her rule. I will rule for a *hundred* days! Longer than any other king of Downfall! You will help us!"

"What do you need us to do?"

"You will distract him! Do what you do. Magic. Something. I don't know. Then I will - well, dagger in the eye! I will be king!"

We try to persuade him to wait. The king is already on borrowed time! Bavlorna is angry; if he were to be deposed, she's still angry and might take it out on Illig despite the offering! Give it a day or two and maybe you can just take the throne without all the disk. Bel's deception role is low, 13, but it's enough for them to try and wait a day or two.

We head out of the shack. What next?

Inafina is ready for a fight. Oswen is reluctantly in agreement; we can't see many other options. She hopes to convince Bavlorna of another path - somehow! - but that seems unlikely. She is full of hopes - finding the treasure room to return stolen things; fixing the wells as perhaps the hut on the well is a key thing; Kindle is concerned for all the other creatures and well, yes, maybe that's how we can help. Oswen opines that it's amazing - we might well die. *But* we have a rare opportunity to make a difference.

Orvil flies over. He's been listening in on the King, who has decided to have a contest amongst nobles and knights. Whoever loses, gets put into jail!

We retreat to the mushroom grove - we figure nobody else wants to hang out around a depressed elf - to check Bavlorna's "hates" book. We do find something useful - a list of names of people who snuck into the carnival and, some names circled, against those the things that were taken from them in retaliation. So now we have a way to know to whom things might be returned - if we can get back to the correct plane, and if can find them. The Carnival itself might know. At least there's hope. That gives Oswen resolve to keep this book and not let anyone else have it, but then Inafina points out that it's a strong bargaining tool to get into Bavlorna's house so we take a copy instead.

Further investigation, Oswen, 16.

* Octavian (the sad elf) is mentioned in a scrap of paper, not on a page, that's held between them. It describes how his heart, in sorrow, has gone so cold that she uses it to keep things chilled! So it might be in a cellar/pantry or similar in her hut, not in the stolen items room.

* Agdon is mentioned - she's sure Agdon isn't giving her the best of his pickings. "I am minded to pin his scarf back on the tree!" is a mention. Well *there* is a moral dilemma.

Oswen doesn't think that's a fitting punishment - too strong - but Bel, when asked, says that the ruler of a domain has the final word. They don't have to obey any other morals from other people. Each domain operates under its own set of beliefs.

"So in a way, we'd just be restoring what Zybilna did originally - but with risk; it'd be done in Bavlorna's twisted way!"

While we talk Inafina is reading on and says "Hey! She mentions that he gave her a pointless stag head. That sounds like Clapperclaw, right?"

"I wonder if she kept it or threw it away... It's - well that makes it harder! Because Agdon really did give her something valuable there, just not something Bavlorna values. So having him punished, despite him apparently being a rather terrible person, is wrong; because he is doing what she asks. He's keeping things, but he's really trying to give her the good stuff." She thinks for a moment... "If we can get rid of Bavlorna, but keep this book, then we could show it to him. He'll owe us, because it sounds like sooner or later  Bavlorna would turn on him. And we can point out that we're restoring order to the realm and Zyblina will be coming back, so he'd better turn things around or be in real trouble!"

So we decide. Grasp the nettle. Return to the Sinking Palace. The king has given us something to return to Bavlorna - they can check, he really has! - so we need a boat.

We get round to where the guards are. Oswen asks. "A royal ferry, then!" they say. We get a slightly larger but rather gaudy boat! They look to the rest of the party, expecting them to "prepare the way" - Inafina insight 13, just enough to realise that they must all keep up appearances. She goes through the motions and the other party members catch on. Orvil rides along on Oswen's shoulder.

We are conveyed through the persistent mist wall that gives us a clear view, now close, of a different side of this strange villa. It looks even more precarious and strange as it looms above us, wide and tall, balanced on the well. The bullywog pilot of the boat looks rather fearful! Inafina perception 13, Oswen 12 - not much noticed, but Bel and Kindle see clearly. Kindle points up. "Look!"

On the clothes lines, the Lornlings are all looking down at us. Strange, frog-like eyes.

Oswen shudders. One suddenly moves, heading up the line to a balcony. Many frogs are there which are pushed out of the way; many jump away, noisily splashing into the water some distance below.

We pull up to the landing and wooden stairs that wind around the outside of the building. We see the strange greyish stone well here, but it's tall - about 25ft extends above the water before it connects to the base of the house. There's a trapdoor at the top of the stairs. We disembark and the bullywug hastens away!

The house is a combination of wood, mudstone and stone block work. The house is most likely magically maintained - yet looks mossy, muddy and damp. Probably perfect for its inhabitant!

Oswen draws a deep breath and says, "right, this seems to be the way..." and starts up the stairs. Oswen, Kindle right behind her, Bel of course at the rear - Bavlorna will recognise him! - so Inafina third. Bel quickly looks into the water at the dock before leaving, using it as a mirror to adjust his disguise - a stick-on moustache and glasses! Maybe, just maybe, Bavlorna has a short memory.

Oswen reaches the trapdoor and pushes the hatch open. Damp, mossy, wooden floor. Humid and smelly, the worst coming from a pool (!) in the middle of the room that surrounds the top of the well. It takes up most of the room - some 35ft square with tiled sides. It *could* be deep but seems to have mostly evaporated, only about 1ft of water left. The head of the stone well gives off a particular bad smell as we get up onto the floor and get close. Acrid, rotting, pond scum rotted to jelly.

Inafina notices (passive perception) that a far corner of the pool is a tall, dirty-looking, free-standing mirror in an oval frame. The bottom has clawed feet, stood in the water. Closer to us, a large lily pad seems to float just *above* the water, tendrils hanging down below. The wood walkway around the edges is about 10ft wide, very cluttered with shelves, tables, misshapen tools; stacks of mouldy, dirty plates and scraps of food cover all surfaces. A few broken children's toys here and there but, across the pool and in the far corner, are mannequins all piled up, in some *really* bad clothes / fashion. We're reminded of clothes on the lines outside. Across to the other corner, a spiral staircase heads up. A small staircase nearby heads into the pool and, we see, five closed doors and four windows.

The door on the wall closest to us is next to a window. Looking out, we see it accesses a balcony (maybe 'the' balcony we saw before?) that's just covered in *hundreds* of frogs. It runs the length of the room we're in.

She asks Orvil to land on a mannequin. One without a head. He lands on its head. Perception 6 `:-/` and nothing happens. "Try one with a hat!" thinks Oswen to him. He flutters up and hands on a hat. One has a straw hat, threadbare, a fedora eaten away, a baby's bonnet, a witch's hat - the fedora is the easiest landing pad! The hat tilts a bit as he settles. This time, perception 21, he notices that the witches hat moved slightly. He's sure that it's something in disguise! Orvil warns Oswen so she whispers details to the others. She goes over and looks closely - investigation nat 20 + 5 - a Darkmantle, disguised as a witches hat! Camouflaged. It is waiting for prey... This is an Underdark creature. It has no business here!

She retreats, warns the party - "as quietly as we can!" - and we form up alongside the pool, with Oswen getting a good line of sight to the "hat", Kindle just in front being protective, giving Inafina a blessing as he goes by that increases her alertness. Oswen throws Ray Of Frost. 24, definitely hits, 1d8->7, solid damage and it'll be slowed down by the frost. Icicles form, it changes colour to a strange, skin-ish colour, strange yellow eyes appear on the conical part of the "hat" as the brim turns into squid-like tentacles. It takes flight.

Initiative:

* Oswen 21
* Inafina 20 with advantage thanks to Kindle
* Kindle 16
* Bel 16

Inafina's next. She hops over Oswen, moves in front of Kindle and tries something new - a radiant attack she has become aware of; it hits, only 4 damage but the creature looks like it's temporarily blinded (save failure) by the bright light. It seems reasonably injured too.

Kindle and Bel exchange glances; "After you!" says Bel. Kindle pulls out a tiny little dinner bell! He rings it; it projects a strange larger size of version of it; clanging loudly - Oswen cringes at the loud noise! - the Darkmantle is hurt (Toll The Dead, wis save failed). It takes 1d12->6 damage. Bel, on the other hand, *did* get the memo about being quiet! He pulls out his crossbow, fires, hits, 5 damage, and that does it. The Darkmantle is dead, pinned to the wall.

Oswen retrieves the crossbow bolt, puts the Darkmantle back on the mannequin's head (with Kindle's help), then gives the arrow back. Oswen arcana, 19+5->24. She notices a slight flicker in the mirror where, momentarily, she realises the Hall Of Illusions. She gasps and points, "Oh! That must be a portal - or something of that ilk... I saw the Hall Of Illusions". She doesn't know how to activate it, but should we destroy it? Insight Oswen 16+1 -> 17. Destroying it would stop Bavlorna being able to send her minions through - **but** at *some* point, **she wants to make it back to Leonidas**.

She turns to the group. A little teared up. "This could be a way home. But it's way for Bavlorna to hurt people. We have to destroy it."

Bel tries to convince her to take it with us. "It's too big and too dangerous." "Kindle can carry it!" Oswen sighs. "Look, Bel, I know it's not easy, but in your heart you know it's the right thing to do. If we take this, Bavlorna might even be able to reach us *through* it. We don't know what it can truly do." Persuasion is only 12. Bel tries to persuade people in turn that Kindle should carry it! Persuasion only 9. Kindle won't carry that great big mirror.

"Well it's sort of decided then!" says Oswen. Inafina agrees. "We must destroy it!" - she tries with the spear but it just glances off! (Nat 1 + 5). She'll have to go into the water to retrieve the spear; nothing bad happens, and surprisingly the water itself doesn't smell too bad. That's just the well. She notices the lily pad tendrils responding. She asks Kindle to help. Reluctantly he wades in and tries his mace. He tries; 12; it only just hits. This is a magic mirror... It just manages to get enough damage for a crack to form, that then spreads over the surface and little chunks of glass fall away. The spell is broken.

Oswen notices the tendrils move on the lilypad, nature check 14 / arcana 16; this is a magic item! It is currently attuned to someone. If she had an hour, she could attune to it herself. It doesn't seem to have a personality; it seems just an object, a plant, alive but not aligned. Perhaps now is not the time, but it could be an interesting experiment later, if we get the chance.

As for the well, arcana only 9. She can see it's tried out. The water level would usually be a fair bit higher, maybe a foot of water or more missing from the pool. The top of the well is totally dry, water evidently not having flowed from it for a matter of days. She can't see inside so asks Kindle, who reluctantly wades over - "Oh, it smells *awful*" - he just keeps down his lunch! - "a plug of jelly or something? Something's blocking it." Oswen says, "Anything Bavlorna wants happens here, so she wants this blocked. Let's clear it."

Inafina gets up close and jams the spear down into roughly the middle. Attack 12 is enough, max damage too, 11. There's a rather nasty glubbing noise as the spear sinks in - dex save! Only 11. She doesn't manage to get the spear back, as whatever she's jabbed in there wrestles it out of her hand. It's a creature! It jumps out of the well. A strange, gelatinous ooze, that slops out. Water starts to flow immediately. The smell is this horrible cube! "Look out!" shouts Inafina as the cube splashes down next to her, Kindle only just getting out of the way on the other side. Oswen is close to the other side of the well, looking on in surprise and horror.

We maintain prior initiative for brevity.

Oswen throws ray of frost (24) and hits, it does seem to work but only 1d8->3 damage. Inafina rabbit hops in alarm back 10ft, then throws another radiant damage attack. It hits for a max 7 damage and that damage, too, appears to work effectively. We're all taking notes! She sees the spear lodged inside the cube, *inside* it - she thinks she can get it out but would need to stick her hand into it. The smell is acidic... There are dissolved "things" in there too. Oh dear.

This time Bel acts before Kindle, seeing Kindle in imminent danger. He says, "You smell so terrible you should have a bath!" - OK, well, interesting insult; Vicious Mockery. Cube rolls nat 20. Bel instead gives bardic inspiration to Kindle.

Kindle looks down to his mace; he saw the way that the spear got taken; but he has a firm grip on the mace handle and takes a swing. He hits, squishing a channel through the cube for 6 + 8 (his first-attack-surprise) damage, manages to keep a hold of his mace, but sees that it doesn't seem too damaged though, so he grasps his Yondala symbol, raises his hand and casts a new spell we haven't seen before; he summons the Spirit Of The Hearth to cast Spiritual Weapon. A 5ft tall glowing *wooden spoon* appears and attacks too, dealing 5 force damage.

A strange pseudopod forms and tries to pummel Kindle but he slides out of the way. Then, on either side the clue kind of extends new pseudopods - its attack was a distraction! - and tries to engulf him. Dex save - nat 20! - he gets out of the way, ducking and sliding, fully soaked by the pool but free of the cube's influence.

Oswen tries another ray of frost. Only 9, but the AC is 6! But d8->1 damage. She invents a new curse word.

Inafina, insight 11, is unsure if attack with hands is safe. She saw Kindle's mace just squish through, but it didn't hurt *him*. But his hands didn't touch the cube. She doesn't want to be in melee range but Kindle's all alone and needs. She goes into melee range and starts hitting. First strike hits, 6 damage. The cube wobbles and ripples from the force. She's not hurt! Encouraged, she kicks for 5. Again, no harm to her - "flat surface" attacks - palm of hand, soles of feet - are key.

Bel sees something similar to Inafina - friends in danger. But they seem to be surrounding the cube, so, he jumps into the pool, gets right up to the creature and starts attacking with his rapier. 7 damage. "Take that! Stay away from my friends!"

Kindle swings the mace again, right up above his head. He orders his spoon to attack too! The mace hits for 5 damage; the spoon hits for 10. The cube attacks him in return but again misses, and he dodges its grapple once more.

Oswen is aware of needing to hold back resources for Bavlorna and the cube is looking messed up now. She decides to hold back a bit and does one more ray of frost. Bizarre repeat of rolls - nat 4 attack for 9 which 
hits, but only 1 damage. She shouts out an apology - "those started well, but they're not doing much anymore!" - Inafina hits twice, the second one only just; 5 damage, 5 damage again. The cube dissolves! It turns into a strange vapour; Inafina's spear falls into the water of the pond and she retrieves it.

Bel sees other things and with Oswen's help, investigation 15. He spots two things of interest along with a handful of coins (which may or may not have been there already) - some 17gp, which he collects. There's a metal mirror and a strange flask which Oswen checks - Arcana nat 1, nat 2 only 7. It's some kind of potion. Bel has a try. Also gets a 7. Inafina says, "Oh for goodness sake, give it to me!" - gets 6. Kindle is watching with bemusement and looks over shoulders. 3. Nobody has a clue.

Oswen puts it in her pouch to Identify later, when we've some time.
