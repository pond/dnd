# Oswen: Part 1.8
## Day 10, 3-4pm in the afternoon
### Yon, in the mountains, in a storm

We don't think we need to spend the night here; we've no idea if this strange storm ever even stops - it could be Endelyn's doing. Bel plays music to lift our spirits while Kindle uses the fire to make a late lunch.

Surprisingly, after we've been waiting around an hour - with no expectations - the storm outside does start to subside. It's not a blizzard anymore, so we don't need goggles are not at risk of being knocked off the path, except for those rocks we saw. Clearly there are hazards. None of us have any mountain experience, although we've all heard plenty of stories, except Inafina; this is of course unusually stormy, but there's usually wind and descent is the way out of that. Giants are definitely a Thing in regular mountains, and she's no reason to presume the Fey has no equivalent.

We decide to head out. There's only one way to go - along the path.

Dim light continues outside despite the storm clouds having dissipated. Despite us being *sure* it's not night time, it's a clear dark night, with a bright moon. "This must have something to do with the lightning rods and the tower" opines Inafina. While our mountain might be clear for now, some others around us still have storm systems.

Inafina leads; survival 18. We don't know where we are or which way is "into" Yon vs out of it. But we did see that tower - so - we think we might go that way. We can stay high or go low, and Oswen suggests that "low" is a better option if the storms come back so she suggests trending downwards.

We start down, carefully. We soon see an area that looks like a kind of valley - a flat-bottomed mountain plateau, still elevated but low compared to the mountainsides around. We see various paths around, and start to realise that there are lots of paths and such plateaus, and perhaps, then, all of the domain Yon is mountainous. We should've asked people that!

The wind drops as we descend, just as Inafina predicted. It gets easier to talk to each other. About half an hour in, for a section which starts to lift up to a small rise along the way, we see another big flash of light; the storm seems to be coming back. We don't know if the periodicity is predictable but that tells us at least one hour of storm for about 30-40 minutes of reprieve. More interestingly though - the hill we are going up has two figures, silhouetted on the ridge by the light. One is slender, elegant, almost like a dancer? The other is shorter, maybe 3ft tall. It has a big, round head and thin body - with something sort of spherical apparently flying around its large head.

We approach. We can see more clearly as we get close. Suddenly the tall elegant one points our way; the big round head changes shape, narrow and flat, then big and round again. We realise that it's possibly like a coin shape, not a ball. It's quite irregular too. Then a rapier is produced! It points at us and calls out. "WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?" - but the slender one pushes the sword down; a female voice, a little nervous, shouts, "SORRY, WE'RE JUST A LITTLE CAUTIOUS!"

We shout back, "WE UNDERSTAND CAUTION! WE MEAN NO HARM! WE WILL APPROACH SLOWLY!" - suddenly that orbiting ball thing flies out to meet Orvil. It's a huge bumblebee! Oswen shouts, "THAT'S MY COMPANION ORVIL. HE'S WITH US!"

The two regard each other and the bumblebee flies back. Oswen gets capybara vibes from Orvil. Judgy bumblebee.

The tall person is a beautiful, slender, female elf wearing a crescent moon mask. She looks rather like that marionette we have... The other is dressed like a swashbuckler. The rapier is sheathed for the moment. He has a little moustache on that curious head; we're basically looking at a 3ft tall dandelion, the flower face being the front. "I am **Amidor**!" the other dances forward, "And my name is **Gleam**."

Via passive perception, Kindle and Inafina both notice that Gleam has no shadow. Inafina straight-up asks, "Are you made of light? You have no shadow" - but we do remember a story of someone whose shadow was stolen. Up close, Gleam looks tired, as if she hasn't slept in a while. "Yes, my shadow was taken. It's doing things that I would never have done!" - we remember that saw a shadow that would match someone who looks like Gleam with, the Lornling and Sowfoot back at the carnival. "Bitter End" - another name for Endelyn Moongrave, we learn, one of several nicknames, such as "The Dame Of Unhappy Endings" and "Creeping Lyn" - was responsible. "She snipped off my shadow - "... but before she can finish, Amidor insists we say why *we* are here.

We explain as best we can. Amidor is a little unconvinced, but Inafina is persuasive (ADV, 18+2->20).

During conversation we realise that these two aren't travelling companions, even though they are protective of one another. They just happen to be here together, right now. Amidor says that we should go and hide somewhere before "Endelyn comes out and checks on her lightning rods - she does that in the evenings, when there's a break in rehearsals before the night shows begin". Gleam adds, "I know of a place to hide..." And we have to "get away from the cyclops - he's after his Queen Bee" - his bee is called **Pollenella** and is Amidor's true love! The cyclops is a beekeeper. Amidor says he rescued Pollenella from the Cyclops' hives because they're truly and madly in love (!) and "in this life, this the only thing that matters."

Whenever it's not stormy, the cyclops can apparently see very far and tries to throw rocks at them if he sees them. So *that* is what we saw.

We follow to the hiding place. It's a sort of grotto; a sheltered space under a ledge, which Gleam uses now and again and has even left a few belongings there.

* She's a bit lost, really.
* She sleeps badly; she's been cursed. The removal of her shadow curses her as a Shadowless. Nothing in the realm of a fey will trust something without a shadow, since the shadow can be off doing evil things.
* She'd love to have her shadow back but the curse would need to be lifted before it could return.
* Her and her sister are the **Selenelion Twins** - and Kindle and Inafina both recognise that name; they thought that her and the twin sister were said to be the best acrobats the big top ever had at the Carnival. Inafina was brought in to replace them.

Oswen asks more about the curse. It's caused by Endelyn's Scissors Of Shadow Snipping. When the scissors were used, she *became* cursed. Oswen, Arcana 27, thinks about that and checks her notes. She thinks Remove Curse *would* undo what the scissors have done. Oswen says to Kindle, "Could it be that simple? A cast?"

Oswen has a scroll; Kindle has that spell too; he says, "Well, let's give it a try! We need somewhere comfortable and safe. Is this where we will be for the night?" Gleam says yes. Kindle decides to ritual-cast Tiny Hut, which Oswen hasn't seen him do before. While he's doing that, Oswen explains to Gleam that we'd like to try something magical that's meant to be good against curses, but we can't be sure it'll work. We're sure it won't *hurt* though, and Gleam agrees.

Kindle's hut is amazing! The sounds and cold of the storm are totally blocked out; we can see out, but the temperature inside becomes warm and we set up camp.

Then Kindle tries it - he casts Remove Curse. There is a bright flash of *dim* light (!) - like a warm flaring of a hearth - which then dies down, slowly. As it does, Oswen looking keenly, sees a shadow! She points - "Look! Look, there!" - Gleam dances and the shadow dances with her. "I think worked!"

She's overjoyed - frankly so are we! Oswen sheds some tears. "Kindle you're amazing" says Oswen, teary-eyed. "Well it was your idea to try!".

However bad this domain will be - and we've little doubt it'll be our greatest challenge yet - we have at least done one good thing.

Amidor says that we have now earned ourselves an honourable knight as guide in the land. He and Pollenella would like to help. He offers his services and we of course happily accept.

* The big mountain we saw with the tower and amphitheatre - the whole thing is called **Motherhorn**.
* It's also called "The Mountain", verbally capitalised!
* A very creepy place... Strange mechanical contraptions powered by lightning.
* Creeping Lyn has set up all the rods we saw to capture the power of the lighting (hey, it's a magical domain, that's how it works here!)
* We ask why! Well, to run the "ridiculous show" that she has - Gleam has visited. Glister is still there, trapped - a "guest", really a prisoner. Endelyn can't harm her - the Rule Of Hospitality actually applies in this case, because they originally went willingly - but of course she can still make Glister's life miserable.
* Gleam was banished from Motherhorn because "we are the embodiment of the sun and moon".
* One of the strange contraptions is called the "**Orrery of Tragedies**" in which Endelyn has seen her own demise - **she cannot be killed unless it happens during a depiction of, or an actual solar eclipse**.
* So that's why it's night - it is never day - there can be no eclipse.
* And that's why Glister, embodiment of the sun, is kept hidden away.
* The lighting rods have both moons and suns depicted on them; and those were already in the realm before Endelyn arrived; and a rod with the moon, aligned with the real sun and viewed from the right place, would depict an eclipse.
* Endelyn believes in the prophecy so much that she might even be vulnerable to it - her confidence in the prophecy might shake her confidence in herself. She might even flee; she certainly wouldn't stand and fight.
* At other times she believes herself invincible and would fight recklessly, holding nothing back.
* **Bavlorna was about the Present. Skabatha was about the Past. Endelyn is about the Future.**

They talk with us about how we defeated the other two hags. As part of that, we show the strange marionette. "A shame you only have one!" says Gleam - "it would be a horrible thing for a sister to do to another..." - and we realise the masks could've been drawn together to look like an eclipse. Perhaps, then, if Gleam were in front, in the line of sight of Endelyn, and we held this effigy - which is specifically an effigy of them, so it is a literal depiction - sun-side front, behind her - then that's an eclipse, even though the moon is much bigger than the sun in this case. It's not perfect, but it's something.

In conversation we learn where **Hurley** is! He's at the castle (and not happy - almost nobody is). Endelyn manages, in her case, to convince people to make unwise bargains by frightening them - she shows them prophecies in the Orrery. Whatever Hurley saw, he wanted to bargain to avoid it. She doesn't play fair, of course - she showed Hurley that he would never be able to pursue his dream as a performer at the Witchlight Carnival if he stayed there. He'd always be just a guard. She gave him the opportunity to perform *for the rest of his life* - but she took away his talent! That was the unspoken cost. We would never derive enjoyment from the performance, and is bound to always perform.

Amidor mentions a couple of groups that might help, but they've become sworn enemies - they'd likely not work together - the **Brigganocks** and the **Korreds**.

We ask if they've seen the strange girl with the pig mask; D20s are rolled and the outcome is that yes! Amidor saw her yesterday, "being very creepy! I think she was headed towards Motherhorn - but she was on the path headed to the Fey Beacons and the lake. The Fey Beacons are a kind of gate... She might be trying to get to another plane." Oswen says, "Well, if we have any chance of catching her, maybe we need get there quicker - but she's a day ahead." Amidor doesn't know how the gate works; it has something to do with lighting beacons, but they're 200ft tall!

We'd need to head to Beacon Lake.

And what of the Brigganocks and Korreds? Amidor says that Korreds have hair as strong as stone (!) - they're up at **Lockbury Henge**. The Brigganocks are across a valley and a lake, in a mine, in one of the nicer areas of current day Yon; near where the Queen's Causeway used to be, with a forest and meadow around them. They're very small, tiny in fact, and very clever engineers. Apparently there's Brigganock engineering behind a lot of what's going on in Motherhorn and Korred hair, turned into ropes, is used a lot too.

Trouble is, the Fey Beacon lake is to the North, beyond a causeway that ran through the mountains with a stone arch bridge; Motherhorn is far beyond; the Henge is mostly West, past the storm ridge, and the Brigganock mines are to the South. 

We figure despite the annoyance of the diversion that the Lake is our priority - if we've any chance of catching up with Sowfoot.

Pollenella will stay with Gleam; there is an appropriate melodramatic parting speech from Amidor! It's all very Banderas' Puss In Boots.

### Maybe 6pm

We're told that it's been long enough for Endelyn to have done her checks - we might be spotted by the Cyclops, but we won't be spotted by her. She'll be headed back to get the shows set up at Motherhorn. We decide to leave immediately since Sowfoot has a big head start.

Amidor leads on. We move as quickly as we can. D8->8. We see a number of things going on around us, but we're focused and lucky - that "8" meant no encounters, basically. They can be good or bad, but either way, we keep going. It takes about 90 minutes to get over a ridge to this very large lake - some 500ft across, with 8 vast rock columns forming a ring around it, each - as we were told - some 200ft or so high. From the ridge vantage point, before descending, we can see that a brazier has been lit on top of one of the columns. Inafina helps Oswen try to look - but it's no good (Oswen ADV perception only 11). But Orvil, flying out in the directions Inafina points out while helping Oswen, perception 20+2 -> 22.

It's confusing though! There is a green-skinned, male wood elf walking down some stairs circling one of the columns (oh, right, there are *stairs!*) and as they descend, Orvil sees to things; the elf looks kind of tired and dishevelled but somehow manages to look regal. He carries a torch so there seems little doubt that he lit the brazier. He seems resigned, but resolute. Then we see 8 **perytons** that cackle and taunt the elf on the way down. The elf just seems resigned to this behaviour. Then the perytons fly around to the top of the brazier. They do some kind of strange dance around it beating their wings in unison and so-on, which blows out the brazier eventually! The elf meanwhile has got into a boat. There's also a creeping shadow - looks like Sowfoot - sneaking up the stairs that the elf just descended. The perytons are following the elf to the next beacon. It looks like she's trying to get up unnoticed, but surely lighting the brazier would be immediately noticed by the perytons? Perhaps they only extinguish things lit by the elf. Amidor doesn't know the story of any of that.

Our path of approach, if we got down to the bottom quickly, would bring us some distance away from either Sowfoot or the elf. The elf is going around the pillars one at a time, with Sowfoot and the elf starting at "12 o'clock" from our perspective; our path brings us down to "8pm". We have to descend but ideally won't be seen by Sowfoot. Stealth:

* Bel 24
* Inafina 16
* Kindle 14
* Oswen 8

We don't know if we've been seen. We get to "8pm", at the lakeside, part way in between two pillars. We move around, trying to use pillars and rocks for cover as best we can, to get to the elf; but the shortest direction that'll catch up with the elf goes past Sowfoot's pillar. Too risky. The elf is climbing up a second beacon now, of those that we've seen him at. When we get to the base, we wait and see him on the spiral descending the second pillar. Orvil checks and sees that Sowfoot's pillar is lit. Oswen decides to burn some fly time to get with 120ft and use Message to say: 

"We are friends. A foe has lit the pillar you were at previously."

There's a brief reply; it's more a conveyance of emotion - surprise, puzzlement, confusion... "I see... What does that mean?"

Trouble is, as Oswen flies up, the eight Perytons fly at her. Initiative!

* Oswen initiative 4

All the perytons are headed her way. There is *no* way she wants to fight them, but they are very, very fast. Best she can do is get 50ft back, towards the ground. She's almost down, with now about 90ft vertical between her and the perytons. The party below can see this and that Inafina is beating a hasty retreat. Insight is only nat 1+6, sigh, so she decides Inafina is in a mortal danger.

Other initiative:

* Kindle 18
* Bel 16
* Inafina 14
* (Oswen 4)

The lead peryton is within about 30ft of Oswen, who is in turn about 10ft from the ground. Oswen doesn't want to fight but was too busy retreating to shout anything down to the party. Kindle (another dreadfully low insight roll) runs forward then casts Spirit Guardians, summoning flitting spirits serving Yondala around himself. The provide a radius of protection into which Oswen is just about enclosed.

Bel looks at the perytons. There are _eight_ of them. Another nat 1 on trying to work anything out! So he goes on instinct... He casts Slow in their direction, able to catch 6 of them. Amazingly, all 6 fail WIS saves and are slowed down. Now Inafina acts. She doesn't know that Oswen fears doing any damage, and after that nat 1 insight, she runs up alongside Oswen (10ft) with her boots and attacks the lead Peryton with Radiant Sun Bolt. 16, hits, for max damage, 10, then goes again, 16 to hit again, hits but for minimum damage, 5. She says to Oswen, "It's OK, we've got them!", and is super surprised when a scared Oswen says, "No no, but we don't know if they are friend or foe, I didn't want to hurt them unless forced!"

The others continue to swoop down. Some are fast, some are slow, and getting close to the ground. Thanks to Slow and the guardians, they don't quite a hit on Oswen, but one is within about 10ft of her, reeling back as it gets to the spirit guardian edge.

Oswen gets down to the ground and hides behind Kindle (!) using her newfound L3 Minute Meteors spell. "I didn't want to fight, but it looks like we have no choice..." One goes out to the nearest peryton, but it dodges that, half 9 -> 4 fire damage. Another is sent towards the injured Peryton, with a cluster around; she aims to get that cluster in a blast and it works - they're all surprised, 9 damage each. The injured one is very injured now and won't take much to go down.

Another fast peryton flies in and gets up against the guardian barrier. The badly injured peryton starts to retreat! Oswen is relieved and says "if we hurt them without killing them they might back off!"

Kindle now calls down Sacred Flame, at the new arrival - but it dodges. So, he draws his mace and gets ready. "Yes, but I'm trying to stop them from attacking you! BACK DOWN!" he yells out. So much for stealth!

Bel tries Vicious Mockery on the closest. It works! 6 psychic damage. He also passes Bardic Inspiration to Oswen. "I don't know what your plan was, but I hope that it works!"

More closing perytons. One gets on top of Inafina. It does hit the Guardians in so doing - which slows it immediately - but succeeds with some of its saves and only takes 3 damage. At least its dive attack was slowed; so it swipes with talons - but misses badly. In return she gets the spear in twice, and a solid kick. The damage is close to minimum all three times but it's still 18 total. It might be reconsidering its life choices!

Interestingly - now the other perytons start to disperse. They saw the meteors hit and hurt a cluster. These creatures are smart. By chance of die, the two that were not hit by the meteor break free of Slow; the four that were hurt continue to be Slowed.

Another close-up peryton attacks Inafina too now. Talons *just* miss, while the beak goes wide too; it departs with Fly By out of range, so now there are only two nearby - three had got close up.

Oswen can no longer hit more than one peryton at the time, except for the two near Inafina so she targets them to try and scare them off. DEX 16 save, 2d6 -> a solid 10 fire damage if they fail, else 5. Both take the full 10, but fortunately weren't badly injured and aren't taken down. Arcana, dirty 20; perytons are magical creatures; monstrosities - not Fey. They don't belong here at all. We probably do want to destroy them, but we don't know their role and if they can put out the beacons they're inadvertently our friends. She tries shouting in common, "You can see we're hurting you, fly away and leave us alone or die!" - ADV intimidation, (10,19)+0 -> 19. They back away, but they don't speak - they can't - so she knows they understood. She puts on the helm immediately (we're dropping out of initiative order) and tries to communicate. WIS13 save for them. She can sense that it's resisting her if it wants to... But it lets her in.

She thinks, "I'm sorry we hurt you but you attacked me and we were frightened."

A flood of thought. *They* are cursed! Recently. A troop of mimes! The Waterdavian Mummers! They tried to seek out Endelyn as they didn't think they were getting the recognition they deserved. They were a main act at Motherhorn until they demanded more... She cursed them all, telling them they were the worst mimes, they might as well just be perytons instead! That's quite some imagination. They can't perform, they can't speak, they can't even mime effectively in these bodies! They harassed the elf because he's **"a sanctimonious eleven prince who, being royalty, obviously is a terrible person and had been living at Motherhorn for the last year..."** - their understanding was that he had a bargain where he had to live there a year. The year was up, he asked to leave, he was told he had to light all eight beacons. If all were lit, it would return him home - or at least show him the path. (Oswen figures that is true!) The perytons think that this prince of the High Forest should not be allowed to leave. If *they* can't leave, *he* can't leave.

They don't know if this is one curse or 8 curses!

The elven prince is tired because he's been trying to light beacons for weeks. Nobody else has come - they didn't notice Sowfoot! - Oswen tries to convince them to just *look* at the beacon! Persuasion ADV 15,20. Yay. They see the lit beacon and fly to put it out, then retreat to minister to their wounds. The ones who are uninjured fly around, determine to harass the prince but leave us alone - for now. They agree to put out that one beacon but in return we must do something for them. Oswen says that if they can wait overnight, she can try a spell that would remove a curse - but she doesn't know if this is one curse or 8, and she lacks the power to do this 8 times! She'll certainly try at least once.

This leaves us with a Sowfoot problem. She must be very aware of of us - briefly thwarted, but only for a short time. Perception 19, Inafina and 20 Kindle - both see Sowfoot running to try and hide, having realised she's discovered. Grasp the nettle. We need to run to intercept. Oswen sends Orvil across the lake as the fastest "spy" we have, but we've got to go around the lake edge. Bel casts Fly on Kindle; he gives Bardic Inspiration to Inafina; both chase after Orvil, now in the air! Oswen is debating whether or not her wings have enough fly time to cross this big lake when she's scooped up unceremoniously by Kindle and we all depart Amidor and Bel, running but waving with Bel shouting "good luck!", as we head over to where Sowfoot was going.

Sowfoot is trying to make a run for it. She's about 200ft away, and looks like she might be heading towards the slope we originally came down on. Escaping! All we can do is keep chasing - we've nothing that works at such range. Kindle is flying very fast - 60ft - so goes 120ft with a dash, Oswen carried along with him. Inafina has to work hard to keep up (40ft range, 80ft dash, + Ki point, 40ft dash as bonus action). Within a few seconds, we're 120ft foward, but Sowfoot is moving too; we are within 80ft "at start of turn" for simplicity's sake.

Close enough. Oswen's meteor spell is up for 10 minutes, so still runs - she lets loose both meteors. 5 damage first, 11 damage next as both hit. L2 Chromatic Orb is thrown too, fire damage, it hits; 15 more; Sowfoot falls, facing us as if she has final words; we close in. She's down, gasping. "You will never free her!" gasps Sowfoot. Oswen says, "Give us the horn and we'll let you leave." Sowfoot laughs. "You will NEVER free her! I've given the horn to Lyn!" and at that, Inafina steps forward and slams down her spear. 7 damage. Lawful Neutral... This creature is not lawful! Sowfoot disintegrates into a pile of skin and bones.

Oswen is wide-eyed at Inafina, but then hugs her and says, "Right thing to do."

Sowfoot has a satchel. We examine it. Treasure; bargained or stolen, who knows. She was going to take that to whatever plane she wanted to reach. We're unsure of the morality, but take that.

* Various pieces of jewellery, some costume and some 'real' including both gems and precious metals
* Masquerade masks of various kinds
* Other 'pretty things', trinkets of very varying value

We figure Sowfoot just couldn't tell what was good or bad and perhaps didn't care either way. We keep it all in the satchel and Oswen carefully stows it in her backpack.

Oswen's expression is dark. "I'm tired, we should find somewhere to camp, then we can try the spell tomorrow."

We head back around the lake, and this time the elf is nearby, so Oswen goes to speak to him. He asks what's going on. We do our best to explain. He has no idea about the perytons either, so we explain - to our surprise, he goes over to bow and apologise. "It was in jest! But I fear it was not taken in the spirit given; I am sorry that I 'booed' your performance!" - the perytons stamp their feet, in an unclear move; he continues, "I am very tired, but you clearly have not been treated well by Creeping Lyn, much like myself. What say we call a truce... Let me light my beacons once we find a way to break your curse, and you can return to Toril with me."

(Lake! Oswen facepalms - she'd cleaned her water bottle by the time we last visited the Unicorn's curse-curing lake; she could've filled it there, as maybe it would've worked to cure the curse.)

We all agree to a truce, to set up camp here, and exchange stories. Kindle once again ritual-casts his remarkable hut spell. We set everything up. We can't all fit in the hut, so the perytons have to huddle as the weather outside turns bad.

The prince introduces himself. "I am **Prince Alagarthas** of the Misty Forest. My father is **King Melandrach**. But, who are you?" Each person introduces themselves. Bel is from the Fey; Kindle is from another plane; Inafina likewise. So when it comes to Oswen, she says, "I've heard these names - Waterdavian, and Toril. Where is that?" and Alagarthas explains. At the mention of all of the things he then describes, including trading at the Sword Coast, she realises that the plane they're going to is *her* plane - the place she was after the Fey, where she met the Witchlight. **So her world is Toril!**

Alagarthas explains that he was having visions of a hag who could see the future. He came to ask to see if there was a future where he could save his brother **Neronvain**, who had been lost to darkness. He had been "tempted by the wrong people during a great war". He was eventually sentenced to a fate which sealed his future; the orrery showed his demise as he continued to seek ways to further his evil goals. Alagarthas asked her to help find the path to his salvation. She showed how; but in return, he had to stay for a year as a royal "guest".

"What did Creeping Lyn show you had to do?" asks Oswen.

"She told me the people who were speaking to him were speaking to him through an object that he wore on his person that nobody had noticed. I have to remove that object to bring him back to the light. But I fear I am running out of time. She didn't send me back after the year!"

"How long have you been here?"

"A year and a month."

Time. Oswen is about to warn him about the difference in time passage but he's aware. In the end there's an accord; he will light the beacon, which is very likely to point to the Misty Forest, while we're not sure exactly where it might go for any of the eight mimes - only one person must light all beacons. They agree that it's a good idea to let the prince light them, since he guarantees they'll be helped home to Waterdeep.

Amidor was hoping to get back to Pollenella but we convince him that she's safe and it's not practical (or very safe) to try and travel back, then out here again, tonight and in the morning. Instead, we get food, bed down, and will get up early to light the beacons. Before we do that, Oswen resolves to burn the Remove Curse scroll. She needs to know what sort of spells she's going to require tomorrow.

The Perytons group together. She gets them to stand as close as they can even though she doesn't know if that helps! With Guidance from Kindle, Arcana - terrible rolls, a 1, reroll to 4, blow Inspiration and only get 3, so even with Guidance (3) and +10, is only 17. She *thinks* though that she can target the curse, somehow; it's the ability to perform, not an individual. She's very uncertain though, so elects to still proceed with burning the spell scroll. It'll save time over waiting until the morning, either way. She tries it...

...the spell is cast. The scroll burns up in bright blue flame!

Strange spectral strings appear above them. Then the strings seem to be cut. The forms shift. The perytons shrink down; mainly human, but there's a half-elf, a dwarf and a gnome there too. Well, it worked! There is much rejoicing!

This is great but in the increasingly bad weather we do wonder about accommodation! The hut can't fit too many people inside and Kindle can't leave without the spell ending. The prince helps us with bits of driftwood and a ledge, so we're able to build a lean-to and we have all our cold clothing which we share out. We can also build a small fire that they can keep going. It's good enough, we hope, to get through the night.

We keep watch but there are lots of people to help out. Through the "night", the Mummers keep people company, doing their share of watch; there's a growing relief as they gradually realise that it's true, for sure, that they are their new selves. The injured rest. Alagarthas meditates and after four hours, starts lighting the beacons. It'll take another four hours!



## Day 11, Fey Beacons lake, early morning

We awaken. Oswen doesn't change spells - she realises she should trust her friends. Kindle can remove curses; she doesn't have to do do that alone.

Alagarthas has nearly finished lighting the beacons - the Mummers are already up, eager to see what path is shown. The last beacon catches alight and immediately the lake surface shimmers and flattens, to show the Misty Forest itself - not stormy waves, reflecting the sky. Alagarthas is running down the spiral and calling out, "I think the portal is the lake! Maybe, jump into the lake? Head in! Hurry!" - and at that, he simply does a dramatic backflip summersault dive, shouting before he does, "Thank you for your help! I hope your mission goes well! We'll see each other back in Toril!"

The Mummers suddenly realise that the portal might close once he jumps through! They chase in, calling back that we should come to see a show in Waterdeep... They vanish through the surface. A few seconds later, the lake changes back to normal as all beacons extinguish simultaneously.

Bel says - "Well - I guess we know *one* way to get back, for you three?"

That's a strange thing to say - oh, but of course... Bel lives here. There's no reason for him to come with us whent his is all over. Oswen says, "Ah, of course! But I hope you'll visit, even if you don't want to stay?" "Well, yes, but I must report back to Sir Talavar to tell them what's happening - but it seems we are dealing with the Hourglass Coven anyway!"

Amidor wants to leave - to get to Pollenella! "Yes, thank you Amidor - we will make haste!" says Oswen. As we start to move out, Oswen confides to the group, "I'm not saying this will be easy. I don't think it's going to be. But I'm also not sure it's this simple. I'm not convinced that taking down Lyn will solve everything. I don't know if that's enough to break the magic at the palace. What about Baba Yaga? And the hags aren't really dead - they're in another plane; they could come back." Kindle says, "Yes, we need to understand how they overpowered Zybilna in the first place and prevent it from happening again."

An hour or so later, we're back at the ledge. Gleam and Pollenella are still here.

"Where next?" asks Amidor. "Well, how about Lockbury Henge?" asks Oswen. "We'll try to get the Korreds on our side."

It's a long trip. We get underway. Group stealth is all over the map!

* Bel 8+4->12
* Kindle 2+4->6 (yikes, but he gives the Watchful bonus to Inafina)
* Oswen 14+2->16
* Inafina 19+7->26

Suddenly there is a thundering "ROAAARGH" and, rising over the peaks on the other side of the valley is a giant cyclops wearing a beekeeper veil. It has huge furs, a massive staff and many trinkets seem to dangle of its clothes. "THIEF! Bring back my queen!" he shouts, in Giant (Kindle translates). Kindle asks Amidor, "Are you *sure* she came of her own accord?!" and Amidor is Joffrey Shocked meme; "I can't believe you would suggest that I would *steal* her! Goodness!" so Kindle says, "I'm sorry but - how do we tell the cyclops that?!"

At the end of the huge staff is a beehive. The cyclops is moving to cut us off. Amidor runs ahead, unsheathes his rapier and starts calling out threats and defence lines - but we're tiny! The giant looks confused. Oswen, passive insight, knows the cyclops doesn't understand Amidor. She tells Kindle to shout out and translate, so Kindle tries! The cyclops walks closer, but there's a swarm of bees around. They're on a lower, grassy plateau now, on either side of a field, as if in a standoff. The cyclops says, "**Mudlump** cannot make Honey Mead without the queen! It's the best mead in Yon! He stole the Queen Bee! The bees refuse to make honey now!" and Kindle shouts back, "OK, just give me a minute..." and we move forward to join Amidor and explain. We try to talk him down - is there some accommodation here; some way to have the queen spend some time with her subjects, from time to time? Help them make the mead?

Bel pulls out his instrument and starts to play a song. He's casting Speak With Animals. He's trying to talk with the bees. For ten minutes, he talks to the bees with Kindle helping translate between him and Mudlump, Helping, leading to ADV persuasion 21. The queen says that she's in love! Awww. She does not want to return to the hive; she thinks life is boring and doesn't like the responsibilities. There must be so much more to life than laying eggs all day! Mudlump doesn't understand - he thinks maybe it's an illness he can cure? A craziness? A madness? What is this "love"? It's bad Star Trek time. Kindle's turn to persuade, Bel helping - nat 19+2 - trying to explain the concept of love.

This strange translated bees-to-giant conversation leads to an accord that if Pollenella can pick a queen from the hive she's free to go. And that happens! It seems very easy to do. There's a rather bizarre (to our eyes) ceremony when the queen bee is actually crowned and Pollenella is released. She looks for a moment crestfallen; her grown is gone; but Amidor reassures her - he still feels the same, the title was nothing; he wraps her in his leafy arms! She is comforted. Mudlump smiles. "It is resolved then! It is resolved and the hive can continue!" - he reaches into his bag and gives us a huge urn of honey mead. Kindle's eyes light up! Mudlump marches off, new swarm in tow.

Well that's one of the strangest things I've seen in a while, and it's got some competition! Does Pollenella mind if we still call her Your Majesty, out of habit?" asks Oswen.

She doesn't mind at all - "though I am, of course, just 'Pollenella' now."

How strange. But a good ending. We resume course. Group perception - all bad!

* Bel 7
* Kindle 8
* Oswen (ADV via Orvil) 14
* Inafina 13

Oswen has a bit of a feeling of paranoia... She feels like we're being watched. We know each other well enough to take that seriously. We stop to investigate. Oswen 22, Bel 17. They make a show of looking for something else, foraging or similar, but notice three elongated goblin-like moonlight shadows flitting behind nearby rocks, following them. Bel runs out with his rapier and pins one shadow against a rock! The other two jump out to try and engage him. Oswen shouts out, "Oh don't be ridiculous! What do you want?!" and Inafina throws a radiant sunbolt near them - they're shadows; they'd better be careful... ADV intimidation, Oswen, 17+0. The shadows stop and freeze. They whisper... "Don't hurt us! We earned our freedom... We owed her a duty and she bade us follow 'these meddling travellers' who had arrived... The ghoul warned her... Let us go! We will trouble you no more."

"Where are your would-be-shadow-casting counterparts?" "We don't know and we don't care! We're free!"

Inafina insight 23. If these shadows are of the fey, they can be bound to a promise; so she says, "Promise you won't reveal our location and we'll let you go." They promise! "We just want to be free to roam." "OK then!" and we let them roam. Off the go, up the side of the mountain.

"It seems Creeping Lyn likes cutting shadows... We'll have to watch out for that. If there's any way to get hold of those scissors of hers, that'd be a good way to stop her doing that to *us*".

Gleam says, "Yes! She keeps them in the **costume department**."

Onward. It's going to be one of those journeys.

"You might want to rope up" says Amidor - more mountains! So, we get kitted up again; we know what the weather can do around here. "Amidor will protect you, Pollenella!" - she lands and he hides her in a clock pocket, safe and sound. We continue up into the mountains; climbing high, on the difficult route to Lockbury Henge.

We reach a very imposing flat-topped (table) mountain. We must walk through a storm to get there; dramatic lightning flashes all around - we hope nothing hits us. Even so, we have to go slowly to avoid risk. We climb carefully for a good hour to get, if not above the storm, certainly clear of the worst of it. The wind is still very strong.

Once actually on the flat top of the mountain rather than close up on its flanks, we see the henge. There are 8 massive megoliths on a boulder-strewn plateau. DISADV perception but flat for Inafina as it's hearing-based; 22. She's sure she heard a sound of activity before we crested the top and runs ahead a bit, as much as the ropes allow, seeing briefly a wisp of smoke disappearing into the wind. It comes off a hastily put-out camp fire, next to a table with rocks of various types on it.

Everyone gets to the edge and Inafina points to the table, more or less in the middle, so we head over. It's square, with two small stone benches on either side. The eight megoliths - standing stones - some 20+ feet tall each, are apparently all made out of different rocks. Nature checks are very low, so we've no idea what types of rock there are. At least two are obvious - one obsidian, one marble.

There's a chequerboard pattern of black and white stone on the table and it turns out the rocks we saw from afar are actually very well carved chess pieces. A partly-played game is underway. Oswen calls out in Sylvan, "I'm sorry we interrupted your game, please don't be afraid, we're not here to cause any trouble!" - just shouting into the wind. What a strange place to live, she thinks, in this windswept place... Persuasion, nat 1, so reroll, 19+0, quite the turnaround. No immediate response even so.

Inafina survival 14. She's looking at the camp fire. She notices two sets of sooty footprints, quite small, that go from the campfire, towards two of the big megoliths. One is a greyish-colour and looks like it's stacked from many thin layers and another, powdery white, just a single block. She walks around the nearest, the grey one; footprints seem to disappear into the rock.

Meanwhile at the table, Oswen looks at the chessboard. INT-based insight, 14+4->18. Mid-game, but the grey coloured pieces can beat the white coloured pieces in a single move. She laughs and calls out (in Sylvan) "I h
hope you don't mind, but I quite like this game..." and moves the grey piece to win. As she does this, Inafina is startled by a grey-coloured creature leaping out of the grey monolith, hands in the air, laughing and dancing in circles, calling, "I win! I win!". From the white stone, jumps a white-coloured creature of the same kind, looking unhappy; "Not fair! You had help!"

They go to the chess board and climb up. The grey one smiles at Oswen. "Yes! Yes. I thought so! I thought that it would be possible!" - she picks up a rock on the ground, squeezes it really hard, and when she releases it, there's a **star sapphire**! "Thank you. I've been wanting to beat **Jagu of Clan Chalk** for the last three days!" - she hands Oswen the sapphire. "You too are a queen?" she says, tipping her head. "I'm queen **Argantle of Clan Shale**. And you are the queen of...?" Oswen says, "Well, I think I'm the monarch of the Witchlight Carnival." "Where is that?" "We don't know! It moves between planes. It could be anywhere right now." "That's exciting! Alright everyone - it's fine - it's a queen!" calls out Argantle.

From the other rocks, six more creatures emerge, each matching their megolith. They gather and are full of questions. All are about the same height as Oswen, but with hooves, a broader build and with massive hair and beards, apparently made of rock. So we explain. We're here to try and rid this land of its curse, in the form of Creeping Lyn; we've done what we can in Hither and Thither, but this is the last domain we reached and she knows we're coming. They offer alliance! "What do you have in mind?" asks Oswen. There's a clamour! "The Brigganocks are in cahoots! She uses their technology." "Should we visit them and find out what's going on?" asks Oswen. They are confused. "They're clearly awful. We tried to make them stop and they wouldn't stop at all!"

Then suddenly they stop and grab their heads - yelling, as if drowning out some awful noise, stamping feet, running around; two dive into their megoliths. We ourselves can feel, just slightly, something... Inafina, perception 21 in particular, can *hear* something. Distant mining. Very quiet, but for these creatures clearly it's deafening. So *that's* the issue - they're mining, but they don't realise how badly it affects the Korreds - or perhaps don't care.

The Queen composes herself again, runs over to a boulder, picks up the whole thing that's four times her size, runs over to the plateau edge and hurls it in the direction of the noise, screaming, "DEATH TO THE BRIGGANOCKS!". There's a huge boom of thunder at the same time as the boulder slams noisily into the mountain.

Argantle says that the Brigganocks are helping Creeping Lyn build her contraptions. They hide blueprints and guard them closely. They mine for more and more materials, which is causing a lot of difficulty here. The Korreds even crafted 'scary statues' at the mine entrances but it didn't scare them off. They have an earth elemental on their side, and **overheard talk of a hidden secret tunnel that connects the mines to Motherhorn**.

"Well, any friend of Edenlyn is an enemy of ours, I guess" says Oswen. "We can try to do something about them, find out what's going on, why they're doing this and stop them somehow..."

"Then this is cause for a pact!" says Argantle. "We must seal this alliance the Korred way!" She calls upon the other clan leaders; there's not been a proper gathering at the Henge for a long time, for fear of "Bitter End" (Endelyn) seeing them in her Orrery and plotting against them. She wants everything in the mountains, they claim; they tried to take down one of the lightning rods and she punished them by cutting off locks of hair (and we see a chunk of the queen's hair is indeed missing).

Dozens are called! So not just 8 then. There must be 50 or 60 in total by the end. Drumming on the henge and stomping on the ground starts; then there are dancing in big circles; we are invited to jump into this and things start getting gradually wilder and wilder. Clouds above clear, and it's almost - for a moment - as if sunlight might break through, but is held back by magic. Performance or ATHL:

* Inafina, nat 4, Performance only 9, inspiration, 5, sigh; 10
* Kindle 20
* Bel only 13 for some reason
* Oswen 9

Today's rolls are generally really awful, with just a very occasional better roll... Kindle alone sees that he kind of learns a new dance and can make the hair move. He can almost command it. He thinks he might be able to do that for ropes made from it, too. Maybe that'll be useful at the tower, but only for Kindle, as the rest of us just aren't "getting" it.

### Around 2pm

We decide to head directly to the mines; they're the closest thing. Prudence suggests assuming that these people are in cahoots with Lyn, but we can't assume that. We'll be stealthy and defensive, keeping an ear out to find out what their real deal is.

The Korred dance seems to have been the reason why the clouds above cleared and at the very top edges, they almost seem to be catching sunlight. At least it's not a storm! They're well above Orvil's max flight height so we don't try to look over the top, besides, we already know the sun is being blocked magically.

Amidor finds a ridge line that connects to a far Eastern ridge that gets us to the mine. There are a few mountain lakes along the way. Inafina, perception 22 as we pass one. She points - "What is that?" - On the path ahead, in the far distance, appears to be a wagon. At first we might've mistaken it for a rock, but it's moving, slowly, in our direction. We stop and watch, and that's how we figure out that it's a really distant wagon. It seems to move of its own accord, though; next to it walks a tall, thin figure in a long, draping rope and cowl. Looks a bit menacing. We can't really hide anywhere, we're on a ridge, so best we can do is meet this person with due caution and hands on weapons!

This isn't a good place to be caught out - the drop-offs either side are steep. Bel calls out, "Stop where you are; stop, I say!" but the wagon continues to trundle on a minute. Only a few feet from us, it finally stops. The figure is just standing there. The wagon rotates itself around its centre (!) and we see it's painted with windswept mountain storm scenes, very dramatic. Almost as if a theatre wagon. The cowled figure raises a skeletal-looking arm, pulls on a cord and the side of the wagon pops open to reveal, in fact, a tiny theatre! The curtains draw back and marionettes appear, becoming animated.

Four characters enter stage right... from a misty portrayal... And of course, it's our party being represented. A dandelion, a bee, a dancer appear from stage left. There are re-enactments of things that happened to us *in private*; it continues to replay everything we've done right up to this moment. Even with a wagon appearing and meeting the characters.

Oswen says, "Impressive. How did you know all that took place?"

At that moment, a banner drops down over everything, saying "To be continued!" and the curtains close. The hooded figure steps forward and puts its hands into its robes - Oswen sees infinite darkness within! - and pulls out a beautifully folded, perfumed, gold-traced envelope with a wax seal. It is handed to Oswen. And another, to Kindle and so-on, but the four of our party. The figure moves back, pulls back on the cord, the wagon collapses itself, folding and folding over and over into a dot of darkness that disappears; the figure bows and as it bows it too collapses. All that's left is a robe.

Without looking at the envelope, Oswen says, "An invitation to the performances no doubt". We debate about whether or not opening the envelopes would constitute any kind of contract or other binding act. Arcana 20+10 (!) -> 30; there's no magic here. These are just envelopes. Each one has wax seal with an insignia of a skeletal face with a bridal veil - reminiscent of the vision we had of Endelyn - and a coloured chalk drawing of the marionettes of each of us that we saw before, and no other words or runes. Oswen says out loud, "This was given to us without being stated as a gift, and without being requested, so without considering it to be any kind of binding agreement requiring any action on our part, I open it to find out more!"

So she does!

Inside is a card with the same drawing on one side. On the other, "Invitation To One Private Audience With Endelyn Moongrave. No Strings Attached". There's an insignia underneath, which is the same as the wax scull.

"Well, there's *that*" says Oswen. "Quite some magic, to do all that, at this distance."

That's a problem for another day. We continue now for the mines. It takes another 3 hours to get close, further than we thought, with the the route being precipitous and difficult most of the time. It's quite near the stormy mists at the domain's edge. There's a big cave entrance here, with some carvings on it, a few gem stones in sockets, with some missing. It's only 5 feet tall though. Arrayed around the entrance, we see the statues the Korreds mentioned - but they're literally just depictions of Korreds, trying to look scary! But they're very good - we might've assumed petrified creatures, mid-action, had we not heard otherwise from the Korreds themselves.

There's a tapping noise coming from within; sounds of mining and work. Rock spires all around make it hard to see the entrance from anything other than the path we took, so it'd be easy to miss if you didn't know the way. Amidor knows that this is *the* entrance. There aren't others (notwithstanding possible secret tunnels!).

We can see that a tunnel behind that's a bit taller; so we risk going in. Oswen goes first as she was shortest. Inafina next, then Bel, Amidor and Kindle blocks the rear. He goes last as he knows we can't see past him! Gleam cannot go down - she says she really hates the dark cramped spaces (she's the sun!) so she's quite happy to rest at the entrance. We tell her we'll try not to be too long but we can't be sure!

Oswen casts Mage Armour and Kindle gives us dark vision to 300ft before we enter, but once inside, we see that the tunnel is winding and there are very few lines of sight anywhere near that long. Fortunately, the roof opens up enough for Kindle to fit, but only just! The problem is more the width - only some 3ft. It's quite claustrophobic. As we enter, the tapping stopped; as we start to go deeper, it restarts. Something knows we're here, but our continued movement seems to mean it doesn't care? Confusing. The tunnel begins to spiral down. 

The tapping sound is like 100 tiny pickaxes. That's probably exactly what it is.

CON saves - another set of lousy rolls, even Kindle not doing well enough for a pass.

* Inafina 10+1
* Oswen 8+1
* Bel 1+0!
* Kindle 13+2

...and so it is that, somehow, remarkably - *we all fall asleep*.

When we come to, we're all lying down, pinned to the ground with ropes. Inafina ACRO tries to wriggle free; nat 1; can't get clear. Oswen ACRO 10. But she wants to see if Orvil is around; perception 18+1. He's on the ground next to her, asleep too. Bel and Kindle aren't doing much better and Oswen can't see where the others are. But Inafina is going for her knife. She's stashed it in her boot and is able to *just* reach it thanks to SOH 20+4 -> 24. She would immediately start trying to set others free, but as soon as she's more able to move around she notices someone walking towards them. A human! Slender, dark leather armour. She passes the knife to Bel quietly and crouches, guarded. He looks friendly, with a strange wisp of light that illuminates his face; it's in a small lamp carried by a mouse-sized creature perched on his shoulder.

"Greetings trespassers!" he says. "Didn't anyone ever teach you to knock?"

Inafina says, "One knocks on a door. Your mine has no door; the tunnel is wide open; there is nowhere to knock!"

"Pft. You can knock on a door frame!"

Inafina realises that she can't see in the dark so an hour or so must've passed, but the mouse-thing provides light. There are two other such mouse-like creatures on this person. She asks, "My name is Inafina. And who are the four of you?" "I'm **Molliver**, this **Trig**" (the one with the light), "**Zarli** and **Oyla**." Hearing this, Oswen - 17+4 - remembers the name. She calls out, "Valour's Call! Hey, we're on your side!" - from her position, tied down on the ground. At this, to Oswen's surprise, we start being untied by various Brigganocks... The mouse creatures are the Brigganocks. Woah.

"How did you know about us?"

We explain what happened at the Wayward Pool and how we came to know about the two groups and the rescue of Elkhorn in Thither.

He seems to brush off the Valour's Call stuff for now (low insight roll; no idea why). Inafina tries to be persuasive to get him to help; persuasion 19+2 -> 21. "Well, no bad feelings... They are trying to protect their turf... Why are you here anyway?" So Inafina says, "Well, apparently, some say, you're all in league with Creeping Lyn. Mining causing trouble, giving her technology... We wanted to find out for ourselves."

The Briganocks get very defensive! And Molliver seems to know nothing about how Elkhorn got caught; they were in the palace and had assumed they were still here. Inafina 18 on insight - there's something being dodged here. Why didn't he go to the palace? But he definitely doesn't know what happened there subsequently; he's been here for a while. He claims to have parted amicably with them and is staying here for the Brigganocks' protection, as Endelyn is being bad to them.

Of course the Brigganocks think the Korreds are in league with Lyn - they provide her with the things she has at the theatre. "She kidnapped our chief engineer! She has him captive. We're not working with her at all... She's stolen our plans, too! The Korreds are helping her!" - and so it goes on.

The statues out the front they thought were to try and "suppress" them, so they fight back by mining all hours.

We suggest that maybe evil Lyn has set people against each other to help get her way. They aren't sure, but take us to their current Acting Chief Engineer.

The mines are, considering in particular the tiny stature of its miners, a wonder to behold. Their job was to mine and sort Wishstones. The clue's in the name! Whenever someone in a mortal realm makes a wish, it coalesces as a wish stone down here. They find them, sort them, find the evil wishes and throw them into a chasm to never be found again. "So what is done with the good Wishstones?" "We used to find a way to send them to the mortal world. Sometimes the wishes come true; well, they help someone." "But now that's not possible?" **"No. We just accumulate them! Endelyn found us and stole a lot of them. We think we lost several thousand!"**

And *this* is why they've been digging a secret tunnel. It's finished! But they can't talk about that...! Molliver says we shouldn't talk about that until we get past talking with the Chief Engineer. We're not allies yet!

We reach a huge hall, full of contraptions. Harnesses, pulleys, scaffolds, and more. It's really quite remarkable. Here, we're brought to the Chief Engineer.

"If what you say is true", he says, "then we should maybe meet them. We should meet them and have a discussion and clear the air."

Oswen says, "That sounds very wise, but it will of course be very difficult - there is much distrust on both sides."

They insist that if the Korreds are indeed *not* allied with Endelyn, that they come to parley. It would be acceptable to do that at the mine entrance, rather than inside the mine.

We agree; the best we can do is take the message to them and try.

### 7pm

Annoyingly, it's too late to head out on the ridge back to the Korreds. But we think that for all we might like to use something like Sending in the morning, we ought to go in person and talk to them face to face. Upon that decision, the Brigganocks think and decide to elect a representative to come with us as a show of good will. A Brigganock call **Uli** will join us in the morning.

Uli's "just" a miner - he's not a leader. But that's good; and he has an honest face, with an earnest disposition. He used to be, some time ago, a major of one of the little settlements scattered throughout the mines. We learn, in talking about this, that Brigganocks - despite their tiny stature - live to around 60 years of age.

Later, we're brought to a "huge" area - really just a cave big enough for people as big as us. Molliver hangs out here too. There are tunnels all over the place. Occasionally, to our surprise, a normal-sized mule turns up - and this explains the tunnel shape and size. The cavern we're in is a turning place for them. We have to squish into a side passage so it can turn around. It's the end of a workday and a bunch of Brigganocks jump onto the *building* built onto the back of the mule! It's a sort of 4-storey inn, strapped on. It's almost a mini-village, as it seems quite self-contained.

Realising we're in the way, we suggest that - despite being very appreciative of their hospitality - that we should perhaps camp up top! They agree it might be safer; if we wandered a tunnel we might fall into the "bottomless" great chasm. Oswen asks the others to wait a while and enquires about whether she could be shown the chasm - she's curious. There's a discussion. Apparently, they don't usually do this kind of thing - we aren't sure why - but do agree to show it to her. It's necessary to travel in a very specific direction though, because they don't want her wandering freely ("to Wish Come True" - their city, apparently) as we're not *that* trusted.

Molliver will escort us to what we learn is **Ribbonwish Chasm**. In the end, the Brigganocks want us all to go together - again, security.

We go through several tunnels, winding down further. "This is the bottomless chasm of Ribbonwish, where we throw the malignant wishes into the night sky beneath."

It certainly is huge, even to us. It goes as far as we can see to the left and right. The far side is at least 100ft away; a grotto of stalactites and stalagmites. There's a truss bridge, 5ft wide, covering the gap. Oswen looks down. It must be really quite deep. Kindle's used his day's Darkvision ability, but he himself can *just* see it - at least 300ft down. But it is not, at least, anything magical - except that he reports that it looks like the night sky. The glittering "stars" are the evil wish gems, shedding a dim light, blueish-purple in colour. There are a very large number - but it's by no means anywhere near full.

Well, it is quite intimidating, in its own way - but it's nice to know that someone is looking out for the good and bad wishes!

They say that a long time ago some Darklings tried to get down to steal some gems, but while looking for a way down, they got vertigo and fell off the bridge! Now they haunt the mid way point. They call the bridge the "highway to the other side". They do go across from time to time - the Darklings don't bother them.

We're brought back to the mine entrance, to set up camp. Gleam is relieved! We were gone a long time. Uli is interested in Kindle's hut, so stays up with us. Kindle sets up his ritual with Uli watching closely. He's full of questions. We answer as best we can. Initially, Endelyn didn't interfere with the Brigganocks as they performed an essential function keeping things going and she needs those things herself at the mountain. But she's now kidnapped the Chief Engineer, which seems counter-productive; perhaps that was part of some plot against the other sisters? The Brigganocks think it's a plot against *them*. They think she's building something. She did, after all, also steal blueprints *and* a large number of the wish gems, both good and bad. Perhaps they power something?

We show the sort of food we prepare (while noting that if we can't forage, we only have about 6 days of food left after this). Uli is particularly interested in cheese! He nibbles away at it while we carry on chatting. We try the mead - and it's *really* good, though of course a bit sweet. Uli has a tiny bit. Uli and Pollenella end up talking quite a bit. We've no idea how come Uli can converse with her, but they seem very comfortable (but not in way to make Amidor jealous!)

Perception, everyone:

* Oswen 4!
* Inafina 11
* Bel 9
* Kindle 21 - at least *one* of us is observant!

Kindle gasps and tenses up - "Everyone down! Quiet!" - but then realises we're in the hut and it should be fine. Even so it's unnerving - he points to the sky; we see a strange contraption - a big kind of wooden bird, but with dragonfly wings, rather large, buzzes around. There is a platform on its back upon which stands the scary, skeletal form of Endelyn in her strange black lace shaped ballgown and with a veil. Hoop skirt, the whole thing. It's quite something. The effigy from Bavlorna - actually, we think now, made by Skabatha - doesn't do Endelyn justice. But that was probably at least part of the point!

She is, as we we were told, surveying lightning rods; eventually she flies off, back towards Motherhorn. There's a big storm and her veil whips behind her in the wind, but she seems otherwise unaffected and flies quite well regardless.

Eventually, we all bed down for the night.



## Day 12, Brigganocks mine entrance

We have a long walk back to the Korreds ahead of us and a very difficult conversation to have with them when we get there.

We pack up. Uli decides to ride on Kindle's shoulder as Kindle is the tallest! Off we go, Amidor in the lead, back along the ridge. This time it only takes 2 hours, and Amidor just shrugs about that and says "that's just how it works here - maybe it's the weather, or the ground, or the light or something!"

So, sooner than expected, we're at the stormy mesa. Uli hides in Kindle's armour! We do warn him that it's very windy up there and Brigganocks don't like being out in the open. We can use the Rope Of Climbing for this, to make it easier. This time, at the top, the Korreds are just hanging out - Shale (the queen) and Chalk are there playing chess and others are out; they greet us on arrival.

Oswen gets into the spiel, then warns them not to say or show anything they wouldn't want a Brigganock to see or hear, and we reveal Uli; we do our best to be persuasive but of course it is very delicate. Especially with an actual Brigganock here! He'll destroy the megoliths with his picks and shovels! But of course, there's only one; and he's very small.

Persuasion with Guidance, ADV from Bel, Oswen: 18+4->22.

After much discussion they decide that all 8 clan representatives would like to go and meet near the mine entrance. We are very glad. It's good that they talk together and each come to their own decisions, without our bias - we're outsiders!

They ask if we trust them. We do. As luck has it, there are 8 of us - including Pollenella and Uli - and 8 of them. They can "bring us through" but only one each. We surmise some kind of magical fast travel. We have to hold a hand of a Korred - Uli is given to the Queen as a show of good faith. He's very scared, but brave!

We stand in a circle. "Ready?" they say - and each one walks into their own stone, melding with it, and each of us somehow melds too. It's very strange. For a moment, we *feel* the mountains - the bones of them; the crags, ridges, boulders and caves, as though reaching out into them, and at one with them. We feel their heights and peaks, depths and valleys. Everything! Every chasm, rift or crack; every rock or pebble.

We emerge from stones close to the mine entrance! Quite a way to travel.

Uli and the Queen are somewhat closer, now, having shared that experience. Uli politely asks us to wait and heads into the mine, scurrying as quickly as he can.

We wait, each processing the experience we all just had.

A short while later, a mule, led by Molliver, emerges; lots of Brigganocks emerge. One the older members hobbles forward with a cane. They gather around and formally address the Queen Of The Korreds. Molliver lifts him up to be able t speak eye to eye.

They basically chat. They talk of histories and recent times of strife. The Queen asks why they mine; why do they take stone? They argue that they don't take it - they extract the wish stones that are embedded in the tunnels; those don't belong there, since they manifest in the realm when people make wishes under very specific mountains in very specific places. This is one of them! Without their mining, there's a risk that eventually it might even shatter the mountain from inside as all these strange crystals appeared.

There is then a discussion about times of day to mine or not - the Brigganocks are actually relieved! They've been run ragged in shifts trying to keep the deliberate 24/7 annoying mining going. The Korreds will of course remove the statues, not throw rocks at the mountain, and so-on. The Brigganocks even invite the Korreds into the mine to assess things - a huge step, we think.

To our surprise, *everyone* is invited to Make A Wish to close a deal. It's quite a squeeze! 8 Korreds, and even 8 of us - Gleam again choosing to stay, but Molliver talks her into it. Our party is relieved as there are many dangers for someone left out alone on the mountain.

It takes a while, of course; but we reach this city. It's built into some kind of natural terrace inside a cavern, upon which is a quite beautiful - in miniature scale - city. Towers, lights, decorations, carvings, full of colour, glittering gems. The mules are "parked" nearby in the cavern, yet the air is clean. More talks; details of the understanding, a firming up of alliances.

Very early days. But this is the beginning of something good.

There are no questions of our plans. It boils down to recon and rescue:

* Hurley
* Glister
* Chief Architect

The Brigganocks can help us infiltrate the tower via their secret tunnel. But there are two issues:

* We need to cross the scary chasm on a bridge that might not take Kindle's weight!
* **Udo** on the other side, who lives on the back of a mule, must give his permission for us to pass.

"He's old and a bit crotchety. He's likely to have a test or challenge! That is his way."

The Brigganocks and Korreds are a powerful force together though - miners and artificers of sorts; but also stone shapers. They create a device of metal and stone, that resembles a small music box. And that, in fact, is what it is, after a fashion. "If you need a distraction or reinforcements at Motherhorn, **simply wind up the music box and set it on the ground. It will send the tune through the stone and the Brigganocks will storm through the tunnel; the Korreds will stone-travel and assault the walls. Distractions on two fronts.**

That's really useful. We thank them.

The Korreds depart to their henge. The Brigganocks get back to work or leisure. We're pointed towards the chasm and left to get to it! Molliver will at least guide us there. Now it's our turn! OK then.

At the bridge, we're surprised to see Uli with a cart. "I have here two wish stones which I think you should have!" - he hands Oswen one; "This is a wish that you made".

It take Oswen a minute, then she goes, "Surely not - from all that time ago, when we first got into the carnival?"

"Well, I hope that it will help you make this wish come true. We *all* want it to come true! But *this* - this is a wish that concerns you, that I think you should have as well. It says, 'I wish for good luck with my lady love tonight'."

Oswen takes the other wish stone. Leonidas. She just holds them, one in each hand, her staff now in the crook of her arm; looking at them.

Uli says they're polished and cut; they belong to her; she hardly hears, then catches herself and regains composure - "Why, yes, thank you. Thank you very much." "How do I use them?" "They carry a little whisper of magic in them. You will know when the wish stone wants to express itself! Once it does, the magic is used up and you will have a beautifully cut gemstone after! Hmm - you see, I thought you were familiar, so I checked on the wish stones and found these."

We bid him farewell and Oswen's being all polite and when he's gone she's just back staring at these two gems. Inafina puts a hand on her shoulder and says, "You'd better put those somewhere safe." Bel walks over; "Yes, don't drop those into the chasm!" At least gets a smile! Oswen puts them carefully into the pouch. She says, "I didn't know that's what he wished for. I might have hoped! I'm not sure I *should* know, as it seems quite private and depending on the passage of time and his own luck in life, maybe it already came true that night and now he's moved on. Anyway... We have more important things right now."

So we look at the bridge. Kindle gingerly puts out a foot and some weight - it creaks - but it does seem sturdy.

Oswen says - "Well, I'll go first. I'm the lightest. Let's see what this haunting is all about...", but then she pauses; Amidor, Pollenella and Gleam are with us. This could be very dangerous - he has led us well, more than any reciprocity would dictate. Amidor will come if we need protection but doesn't know the amphitheatre layout; Gleam however does, so she could help us perhaps try to find the sister - but she'd need to be very stealthy, as she's well known there.

* We have no idea where we'll pop up. If we get to the amphitheatre, she explains it has a stage. There's access to underneath it and a lot of machinery behind. The whole theatre really is a contraption! Lots of movement. The main floor where performances are held has lots of stairs and corridors leading to seating, prop rooms, back-stage - but that's technically the bit that's *under* the stage - and so-on. Motherhorn's "main entrance" leads directly to the amphitheatre, in fact.

* Now... The prison - that's upstairs in the actual castle itself. The only way to get to it is via the main library at the ground level of the castle, right behind the amphitheatre. There are lots of doors out of the library, but one in particular out of the back leads into one of Endelyn's props rooms where she keeps all her masks. Tucked away, almost hidden, in the left hand side of that corridor is a spiral staircase that leads up to an upper level. Up there, one corridor goes to the orrery; the other goes to the prison.

* From the orrery there are more passages - one to a balloon dock, two to theatre boxes above the main stage - Endelyn tends to watch from there - and there's an audience room towards the back of the castle where she tends to host guests. Gleam has never been higher up the staircase than this (but Endelyn does go up).

* The stage workshop is below the stage and that's where many people hang out when not performing.

* At stage left there's a passageway to the dressing room, props room and general activity prior to a performance, then back to performance quarters.

We suggest Gleam and Amidor, along with Pollenella, get to safety. We can meet them at the place we've stayed with them before.

Now it's time; Oswen walks onto the bridge. Perception 13; she gets to the mid-point, about 50ft along, before noticing **three flame sculls** that had been hiding under the bridge, that fly out and surround her. Insight 12; she's not too familiar with these, and isn't sure if they will attack - the Brigganocks said they had no trouble with them... As she's trying to figure things out, **six fire rays streak out in her direction, one from each eye!** - in a split second she internally curses for not having Mage Armour up before going across. **Four** hit her, for a terrible **48 damage**. She only has 29 hit points; just short of being fully killed outright, but she drops like a stone. At least, for whatever reason, the magical rays of fire don't seem to set her clothing alight.

Initiative:

* Inafina (nat 20) 27
* Bel 22
* Kindle 16
* Oswen 5

Inafina runs in, flying on her boots, and uses Radiant Sun Bolt to attack the closest scull. She is able to use her bonus action to attack 4 times; 3 hit; low damage, though - 5, 6, 7 damage (1d6 rolled 1, 2, 3). Bel doesn't block the bridge entrance; instead, he looks around in a panic, and on his Bandor, plays Levitate; he levitates Oswen 20ft up in the air and 20ft back towards his side of the chasm. She's 30ft from that edge now. He also grants Bardic Inspiration to Kindle.

The flame scull attacked by Inafina now spins around and throws two flame rays at Inafina. Both hit `:-(` so she takes 22 damage! She only has 11hp left...

...Kindle runs forward and uses Channel Divinity to create his twilight sanctuary (d6+5 temp HP at the end of every turn). He can only get so far long the bridge and in fact ends up more or less directly underneath the levitated Oswen, but goes as near as he can then casts Moonbeam, centred in the middle - more or less where Oswen was - catching all 3 sculls; 11 potential damage; CON saves. Kindle gets 6 temp HP. The next flame scull, now on its turn fails its CON save despite ADV, taking 11 damage from Moonbeam. It creates a Flaming Sphere over Kindle then slams it down. DEX save; but he fails badly, even Bardic Inspiration at max would not help; 2d6 -> 5 damage; and Kindle holds his concentration spell up. The next scull acts; CON save; also fails despite ADV -> 11 damage. This scull throws fire rays at Kindle, hitting once; 11 damage. These sculls are awful. He has to use Bardic Inspiration this time to hold his spell.

(The sculls heave each moved out of range of Moonbeam after damage is taken, so now none are within that space).

Oswen fails a death save (d20->8).

Inafina gets close up and starts using her spear, two-handed, to see if that does any better. Miss; hit for 10 damage, it's *still* up; then another miss. 10 temp HP gained, though. She shouts back, "We might have to run!"

Bel runs up onto the bridge and gets behind Kindle. He moves the levitating Oswen behind him and releases the spell so she floats down onto the bridge behind him. As a bonus action, he casts Healing Word on her, L2; she comes round, with 17hp. Her first words are, "Wait, what happened, where am I?" "Stay behind me!" he shouts. He's trying to be brave and defend her. He gains the maximum 11 temp HP.

The scull by Inafina succeeds its CON save this time and only takes 5 damage, but gives the impression of being almost down... But it's not, and now flies out a distance, intending to cast Blur *on itself*, making itself hard to hit - but Inafina hits it with the spear as an opportunity attack. It's only d8->2 + 4 -> 6 damage, but that's enough. The light goes out in the eyes and the scull falls down onto the bridge, apparently lifeless...

Kindle uses his action to move the Moonbeam over to catch the less damaged sculls and avoid Inafina. As a bonus action he gives L2 Healing Word to Inafina; 13 points. He moves closer to Inafina along the bridge and his Moonbeam potential damage is now 10 (2d10, so 11 and 10 isn't great). (The flame scull holding the flame sphere over Kindle had taken damage and actually lost spell concentration, so that's gone and Kindle doesn't have to worry about it).

The second scull only takes 5 damage from the moonbeam. It casts Magic Missile! 9 damage. It flies out of Moonbeam away. The third isn't in Moonbeam range. Oswen sees it mutter something - Arcana 26, fireball! She yells out "Watch out!" and casts Counterspell. After that she shouts "These things can do fireballs!". History 13; she remembers now a few things about flame sculls - the unfulfilled spirits of spell casters who take on a cause and defend a certain area. But they're mindless due to whatever happened in their undeath; but they're resistant to things that other undead are - cold, lightning, and probably fire in this case; they will recover within an hour or so unless holy water is sprinkled on them or the curse of undeath is removed with Remove Curse or the magic holding them together that helps them reconstruct is removed with Dispel Magic. So she shouts out, "Could try removing a curse on one!" then throws Chromatic Orb at the second scull, thunder damage; it hits - crits in fact - but the 6d8 damage roll (48 potential damage) is horrendous, only 16 damage. She stands her ground. "Thunder works!" she shouts.

Inafina can see that Oswen's attack worked; she heads over and attacks with the spear. The first hits, but only 6 damage; another 6 damage; it goes down; DEX save - 16! She catches the scull before it falls using her spear - it slides down the handle. She doesn't know if Kindle can remove a curse or if that'll even work, so spends a Ki point to continue on the third scull with her radiant sun bolt; crit fail and a hit for 9 damage. She moves back a bit, scull on her spear handle!

Bel tries what Oswen did and casts Shatter. It fails its save despite ADV; 16 thunder damage taken. "Kindle! Grab it!" he shouts, while granting Bardic Inspiration to Inafina.

Kindle tries something inventive...! He uses his climber's kit to try and hook the flying scull, to reel it in - but he misses. Only 6 temp HP gained.

The flame scull misses with one flame attack, but hits very heavily - 3d6->17 (woah!) - damage. He's heavily injured. The scull now tries to retreat, too. Oswen has to just go for it and attack; another orb; hits, standard, but 18 (more than the crit!) damage and it falls down.

Inafina has to go and find the scull. Perception 12. It takes a while - a few minutes - but she locates it and flies back up. So, now we can all at least cross the bridge; and we gather the sculls. We have no holy water, but Bel tries Dispel Magic. Oswen helps Bel assess what might be needed (expertise in Arcana -> Help action). His Arcana check is 19. This is enough - he figures it out - and he manages to dispel the magic *on all three*, as a group... They turn to dust.

We all just sit, a bit of a mess, chatting about it having a rest. And a while later, a mule turns up, with a house on its back. A wizzened, gnarly-old Brigganock turns up. "That's great! Someone managed to defeat them after all! We've always just had to run past them!" (Oh, *that's* what "no trouble" meant!). He explains that they were victims of their own hubris - fooling around on the bridge at the half way point - so they always hate anyone who tries to cross. They don't leave their post, so running past them can work.

Oh. We could've just run. But we've made the bridge safe. "I'm Udo! Who are you?"

We explain everything that's happened before and ask if can have his permission to go into the tunnel. Thanks to the bridge fight, he agrees. Bel helps Inafina chat to try and find out more. Persuasion ADV not great, 15. 

* The tunnel feels like a last ditch attempt to try and get back the old chief engineer, but he holds little hope that it'll work.
* Lyn has an army of strange creatures that do her bidding.
* On a prior recon mission a Brigganock came back and said there was a female Warlock who had allied herself with Lyn and - "well, she's the jailer for the engineer" says Udo. The word "torture" is mentioned. We shudder.
* The engineer is not being kept in the same place as Glister - he's being forced to work, so is probably at the stage workshop most of the time.
* "His name is **Golmo**".
* They keep him in a little cage!
* The warlock is **Skylla**. We must be careful. She is very dangerous!

He offers to let us rest here. We will certainly at least have a short rest! Bel plays Song Of Rest, which 
helps us heal. When all that's done, we don't feel so bad, after all. Oswen and Kindle also get back a spell slot.

Madrick was a warlock of Zybilna, recalls Oswen. The League Of Malevolance has a warlock of Baba Yaga. The abilities depend a lot on the patron, so we can't really say what this person might be able to do. It would be unwise to underestimate them either way!

Oswen notes that Kindle is quite upset by what happened. Just as he regains a spell, he casts it! Aid is invoked on the three of us. We all get max and current HP +5. Very good. But Oswen enquires, "So - what *did* happen? I went on the bridge, saw the sculls and then woke up behind Bel!"

Kindle explains (in very emotional terms). Bel explains in more measured terms. She was knocked out, but badly hurt. Inafina ran in, Kindle too, and Bel was able to move her to a safe place and do some healing. Kindle called down Moonbeam; and so it goes on.

Oswen thinks and goes, "So you're all heroes, and very brave and you saved me. Thank you."

Bel insists that Oswen stays with him - at the back! Oswen considers at least casting Mage Armour, but she's low on L1 now. We're trying to be stealthy and avoid combat but Bel and Kindle persuade her (26!) - so she casts it.

Udo asks if we have candy. Chucklehead was handing it out in the village after we defeated Skabatha, so we have a fair bit. It's exchanged for food from a strange underground garden he has cultivated - amounts to about four rations! Very useful.

(End of Part 1.8)
