# Oswen: Part 1.5
## Day 5, getting late
### In Bavlorna's house, in the village of Downfall

We have just defeated a gelatinous cube! It blocked the strange, tall well upon which Bavlorna's house is so improbably balanced, the top of it appearing in a square pool area on the house's lowest level. Water is flowing out of the well now, the level in the pool therefore slowly rising. Oswen has plenty of breathing room but there's no point standing in a pool getting soaked! She gets out; the others follow suit.

Oswen examines all four other doors. None have locks. She uses a nursery rhyme - "eenie meenie" - but modified for current circumstances, to pick a door. She ends up at the one closest to the mannequins. She opens it; the room looks like a closet. Piles and piles of clothes; bundles of yarn, spools of thread, scraps of cloth. Investigation 6+5 -> only 11. She doesn't really understand the room, but does notice two 1-foot tall pin cushions sewn into humanoid shapes. One is on a rocking horse, one has wooden wings. 

Bel is the only one with a high history roll. 22. "Those are her sisters! What is she doing making effigies of them?" Oswen says "I've read about this being a way to hurt, or scry or something, I'm not sure. It's not a good sign. We should take these in case we end up facing the sisters and need them as a distraction to show that Bavlorna was doing bad things."

She puts them both into her backpack.

She walks to the next door. But she hears a strange humming from behind it. A swarm of some kind. "Hmm. Maybe later!" she says and moves down to the next door on that same wall. "A very good idea" says Bel, the rest of the party moving with her. Kindle listens at the middle door - "Yes, I agree, a good idea!"

Bel grants Bardic Inspiration to Oswen. Oswen opens the door. There's a cupboard. The ceiling has a hook, which hangs on a rope. It looks designed for a bird cage. It's not big enough for the big cages that a person would fit, but Sir Talavar's cage would! The cupboard seems to be locked and there are no obvious handles, but there's a sigil, engraved on copper. Oswen Aracana dirty 20, plus investigation 21 (using the Inspiration). Yes, it's an arcane sigil, the centre rotated upside down but the outside in the right location. A sigil for locking. She tries rotating the centre upright - can it be that easy?! - it clicks inwards at 180 degrees rotation and the sigil changes to one of conjuration. Now she must rotate further to ensure the correct sigil is formed. Her 20 arcana prior is enough for that and it works.

The door swings open. Inside are long wooden drawers, narrow and square cross-section. She examines a few. Some are filled with strange things - trinkets, bits of collected items; one is filled with dried flowers. Another folded-up monogrammed handkerchiefs with different monograms. A few contain love letters addressed to various people! She keeps quietly looking through and finds two spell scrolls!

* A scroll of Slow
* A scroll of Expeditious Retreat

Into the backpack! "I can see why Agdon gets hooked on this - keep an eye on me, Kindle..." says Oswen.

She next investigates all those mannequins. There's a strange clothing theme here, after all. Investigation 21. Nothing magical. The hats look like things Bavlorna might have made herself. At the back behind them is a framed drawing of Bavlorna herself, but smoothed out with youthful-looking skin.

The pool seems to have settled at about 3ft deep. The lily pad bobs about, still slightly above the surface. The broken mirror is mostly submerged, as is the well itself.

There's one more untried door. Oswen listens; no sounds; she opens it and peers inside. WIS save, 18, all good; as she walks in, Bel behind her gets a fright! Staring at us is a horse of sorts. Well, a head, with glass eyes, slightly askew. Lips are peeled back with pointed yellow teeth that don't seem from a horse. An 8-legged body made of wire and wood has part of a shoulder apparently sewn on. There's a strange smell.

A table is covered in the usual plate; another table has various distressing saws and knives. There are animal parts here, too, all over the place. A crate with Agdon's writing, "Bavlorna", is here too. So whoever said that she liked dead animals was apparently right! Flies hover around a second crate, its lid open, containing a fresh - well fresh*er* carcass. This is a taxidermy room, but she's combining different animals together into chimeras. A hobby perhaps, but she's not great at it - some look horrific; others hilarious. Very odd.

There's a drawer with key in keyhole, but that's easy; the key does unlock it. The draw inside has segments, In each are different coloured glass eyes - except one, that's bigger and made of wood. It seems different to all of the others. Arcana 14. *Something* different. Perhaps an inherent magic - perhaps it belonged to something or someone who had enchanted it. She can't figure out exactly what. It's not "looking at" her, so she grabs it in a way that covers the "vision" part (pupil) and puts it into her pouch, in the dark.

"It's time, then" she says, and heads to the spiral staircase. The others follow in the same order as up the exterior stairs earlier.

The staircase opens up into a narrow hallway. The walls are covered in scores of portraits depicting grumpy, sad, frightened and/or angry people of all kinds - elves, halflings, humans, bullywugs, goblins and so-on. The styles vary greatly, from finely-made oil paintings to hurried pencil sketches, but all are in very ornate gilded frames. To Oswen's right, near the stairs, is a 2ft wide, 5ft tall mirror hanging. There are two doors opposite each other along the hallway and one close by at the nearer end. Inafina with passive perception overhears muffled sounds of conversation happening in a room behind that closest door. She mouths a "shush!" and we quietly move into the corridor a bit.

Oswen creeps down to the pair of doors along the hallway, choosing the one across from the mirror side. It's especially damp inside. Lots of moss and mould. Some fog appears to flow inside from a balcony through a half-open door to one side. There's a big dining table, covered in yet more dirty plates. Above each door are hunting trophies - but these are mounted goblin heads! A sideboard cupboard with dirty glass sits to one side. Swarms of flies are all over the plates and half-eaten food. Surprisingly there's a filthy chandelier with a few lit candles, providing dim, flickering light.

Oswen investigation 18. She sees a lornling. Then another. They pop out from a goblin head she's looking at! They look curious. Looking at her. They look... Scared. They are chained! They're being held inside the heads. She whispers to Kindle, asking if he can get the heads off the wall quietly. He manages to lift it off a hook and lower it. She looks to see how they are attached. Small locks. Bel tries to use his recently-acquired tools to pick the locks. The first is harder, takes a while. The next - nat 20! He aces it. The two quivering lornlings look up, trying to figure out what we're doing! They don't speak. Oswen says, "You're free. You can head down the ropes to escape in the lake? If you wish."

There's a bizarre look of gratitude. They start to leave, but then one comes back, sticks its thumb into its mouth, blows on it and it looks bigger and misshapen - more like Bavlorna! - then the other looking at us, to make sure we're watching, runs around it while the first eventually grabs at it. Then the other lornling runs counterclockwise, and the one blown up in the middle starts to sneeze over and over. They speak! "Withzbadinth. Wisherdins. Widderdins. Wishershins." They repeat the actions. Oswen tries to clarify; shaken heads. "Diddershins!" Runs anticlockwise. Ah! Run *that* direction only. Nodding! They head away.

There's another door here - well, until we get discovered ourselves, we seem to be doing well making discoveries.

A bizarre room. Foggy, smelly, with a strange huge copper contraption - some kind of still - with numerous long necks that come into condensers that drip what seems to be a mushroomy-smelling alcohol into barrels. All around the room are other barrels, full. This is a distillery, and it reminds us of the drink the king served. This must be for them, perhaps to keep the bullywugs happy. "If we need to pay off the bullywugs, we can pay them off in alcohol!" says Oswen.

There's yet another door. There's a bang; then a cawing noise; then "get out!" then smacking noise. "Get away from the meat!" - and in fact two bird-like sounds, and someone who sounds annoyed. Well, that sounds like *something* and noise in that room is clearly something Bavlorna ignores! So, Oswen gets the rest of the party up close, they strides in. Before she gets a chance to say anything, she sees down a corridor a kitchen or butchery, a mad-looking red-cap-wearing butcher - female, stained apron, but long white beard - and two vultures that apparently came in through a smashed window are trying to get at meat on the table.

It's a gory sight. She's chasing the vultures around a blood-stained butcher's block covered in bits of meat. She sees Oswen. "Help! They're trying to steal them eat!"

Oswen decides to feign help - she throws a ray of frost at one of the vultures; it might frighten it off. She just gets a hit, solid 6 damage. The vulture freezes and falls to the ground, dead and frozen! The other one takes one look at that and flies out - this time smashing through a window and onto a balcony. And through that opening, Oswen spies an **empty hanging cage**.

The butcher introduces herself as "Bloody Toes". She asks Oswen to throw the carcass off the balcony. A good excuse to get onto that balcony - so Oswen complies. It's too big for Oswen, so Kindle comes in "This is my friend! He'll help!" and as the "cook" heads off declaring, "I need a drink!" we make a show of dragging the vulture to the balcony.

Three iron cages. A gasp. Sitting up is a Satyr. "Hello there?!" "Sssh! The cook might be back any minute." "You have to get me out of here! She's going to butcher me! My name is **Vansel**" but he's embarrassed because he's naked. Oswen says, "Just one moment" and rushes back inside to examine the meat parts on the table. Nature 14. This was... Probably humanoid. Something furry. She goes white as a sheet and looks at Kindle wide-eyed - Kindle positions himself so Inafina can't see the table, because *he* sees a Hare's foot.

Oswen whispers to him, "I never thought myself the killing kind. But surely, that would be justice."

She sees a butcher's apron thrown down by the butcher. She grabs it and goes to the Satyr, "This is all there is. I'm sorry. We'll get you out. It's dangerous. Be as quiet as you can."

While Kindle distracts Inanfina by keeping watch for the cook, Inafina and Bel examine the cage. It's just and old-fashioned padlock, but the cage needs pulling in by a rope a bit and Kindle's strength is needed. Bel gets to work. SOH 22. Easy. He helps out Vansel who then looks closely - "No! Bel?!" "*SSH! Nobody knows it's me!*"

We all get back to the main kitchen - just as the red cap comes in, bottle of mushroom wine in hand - eyes widen - "Hey, wait a minute!" - and Bel moves to fire his crossbow, hastily drawing it. Kindle is quick off the mark and immediately uses another L2 slot to cast Silence over the red cap, over at the door and gives Inafina his Vigilant Blessing.

Initiative thereafter:

* Inafina (again with advantage) 24 - when the three of us were on the balcony, she *did* see the table
* Oswen 12
* Bel 9
* Kindle 4

Inafina sees the red cap walking up the corridor; she shouts out but can't hear it - she's within the edge of Kindle's spell. She throws a radiant blast for 7 damage and runs closer, but doesn't want to block the corridor.

Oswen runs to get a line of sight and throws a ray of frost; it hits for only d8->2 damage (d8), but at least it'll slow the red cap down a bit.

Bel's options are a bit limited because Inafina's attempt to shout let him know about Silence (along with everyone else) and if his enemies can't hear the effects of his spells, they won't work; so his readied crossbow is his best bet. He fires, but it's been a while and he's a long way away - he misses! "Drat!"

Kindle casts Toll The Dead. WIS save; the red cap fails; d12->9 damage.

Well, we've all had our turn... The apparently-surprised red cap finally gathers themselves together enough to retaliate. She runs up to Inafina and tries kicks with iron boots! DEX save only 6+5->11. She takes a horrible 18 damage, and is prone! She only has 2hp left.

Inafina gets back up; flurry of blows; all hit, 16 damage (but Inafina herself is on the edge of falling). Oswen sees this - she decides to blow L2 Scorching Ray, and it works. All three hit, and the red cap is taken down. Oswen runs up to Inafina shouting, "Kindle!" while trying to drag Inafina out of the silence zone.

Kindle is flustered - "oh my - this is - well - fine..." - he drops Silence and runs up, but Bel beats him to it! Bel casts Cure Wounds, new version, 2d8+3->12. Inafina is looking a lot more chipper but still quite beaten up, so Kindle casts Healing Word for 8 more. She only needed 7 for full health. She thanks everyone. "That kick! It was extraordinary."

(DM rolls d8). The body of the red cap suddenly withers. An effect of this fey domain, perhaps? Rapidly, it ages, then crumbles to dust, as if time were hugely accelerated. Vansel is happy to see that! But how do we get him out? While we're talking about it Vansel looks around the kitchen and gets a cleaver. Oswen asks, "Are you sure?" "Well I have to escape. I can't just stay here." "Well, we have to keep looking around and seeing what we can find - but we're talking Bavlorna herself, I think...?" "She's in that room over there!"

He points to a door at the end of the hallway.

Oswen looks at Inafina who looks at Kindle who looks at Bel and we have that "ah shit" moment; there's probably not point searching more and we're about to go for it when Vansel says, "But her bedroom is upstairs..." Ah! Perhaps something up there might help?

But there are other doors and we gather ourselves... No panic. Back to investigating. The door back towards the hallway we entered through; silent; it seems to be, when opened, some kind of pantry. That's it; the food can't be trusted. Oswen tries another door - the one close to the balcony. Buzzing, again. Orvil flies out through the balcony and can see that it's a downward-spiral staircase, but covered and he can't see in. Inafina listens and insight 15, sounds like a *lot* of bees or wasps. It sounds like a hive, right by the door. Oswen moves left to the door closer to the corridor to Bavlorna's room, to see if that has a hive too.

She goes to put her head up to the door to listen. But it's cold! Freezing cold. Wait! She whispers, "It's cold! Octavian's heart - it must be here - but it's *so* cold. Can any of us stand that?" "For a short while perhaps..." The best at investigating is Oswen, it transpires. With some Guidance and Orvil helping, she steels herself against the anticipated cold and opens the door and dashes inside.

A meat locker. Oh! No. All kinds of animals - *and humanoids* hanging off meat hooks. Just *awful*. A layer of ice and frost emanates from a chest in the middle of the room.

She backs out and closes the door quietly. "It must be that. There's a chest, but it's very cold. How can we transport it? We need something to wrap it in - the heart - if I can get the chest open. But we have no blankets! We really didn't come in too well prepared. Bel has a cloak and pajamas; Kindle has a blanket. It's nice a think. He gladly offers it up, Kindle being Kindle. "I can carry it".

So Oswen goes back in, armed with blanket, and her and Orvil examine the chest's closing mechanism. Just a top that opens. She readies the blanket and opens the chest; with Guidance, 15 nature, the frost-covered wooden coffer emanating extreme cold is opened and, frozen into the middle, is a small jar. It has a still-beating heart inside! The heart itself is not frozen, but emanates cold. She uses prestidigtation to try and melt surrounding ice; that's enough! She wraps the jar hastily in the blanket, hoping that it'll be enough to contain the heart. The pulsating cold in the room stops; strange, the heart needed to be in the chest? Ah, the heart has been cursed... With Nature 15, bringing it to Octavian and removing the curse should be enough.

Back in the kitchen, Kindle keeps the jar wrapped just for protection and carefully puts the bundle back into his bag.

Vansel is hum-ing and ha-ing. "I think I know how to get upstairs! I do I do! Follow me!" and goes to the balcony. We follow. He points out a way to climb onto the roof. It's pitched; you can clamber up to a balcony on the top floor. It's a bit tricky, having to scoot around a corner of the roof, so we decide to rope up.

Vansel says he's pretty good on surfaces like that. He offers to lead the way, along with Bel.

(Later Vansel explains that he and Bel are descended from mountain goats! "I'm pretty sure I'm descended from some kind of stay-at-home goat..." replies Bel).

Vansel, Bel, Kindle, Oswen, Inafina.

Orvil flies around going on about how it's much easier than wings. Oswen suspects he's worried about her and is hiding it with humour.

Bel and Vansel - nat 20 on the climb! No problem. They tie the rope to a place mid-way and to the balcony. They tell Orvil who tells Oswen who tells the group. Kindle gives the Vigilant blessing to Inafina again since she's going last and will be watching and guarding our rear - then starts his climb. ADHL ADV with rope - needs Guidance for himself, 4, that's good, total 17, he makes it. Oswen next. ATHL ADV., 13. Just scrapes it. When you're 3 foot tall and a wizard, heights seem that much higher. Inafina uses her monk ACRO instead, getting 22 with advantage. Doesn't even really seem to use the rope.

Well, we made it; we're on the balcony. Vansel is at the door and he and Bel work together to open the internal latch using some wire to lift it from the outside.

We're in!

Vansel stays on watch on the balcony. The rest of us go in. Oh! Be quiet... We can hear conversation from below down some stairs. We're right above Bavlorna's room and must be very quiet. Stealth:

* Inafina nat 20+5 -> 25
* Oswen 8+2 -> 10
* Bel 17
* Kindle 15

Oswen bumps into a table; we freeze; but the conversation downstairs doesn't change. The room is lit by a Will-o-wisp in the rafters that drops down a bit as if to observe us but otherwise does nothing. Oswen investigates, 14. On a tall chest of drawers, 4ft high, stands a watering can. There are four clay pots that seem to have been knocked over, with plants that are half-fallen-out and withering. And a chest - padlocked and sturdy. Oswen decides to spend a spell slot on Detect Magic, to see if there's warding on it; the *lock* has magic. Some kind of warding against lock picking. *We'll need a key.* She points to the lock at looking at Bel and Vansel, shakes her head to indicate, "no, don't touch". She motions finding a key.

Quietly, she rights the four clay vases, pats down the soil and asks Inafina to fetch the watering can; it's full. She waters the plants. As she does, they start moving - it seems they're small twig blights. Oswen suspected sentience. They soak up the water; one looks at Oswen with - luckily - thankful eyes! It reaches up to a bud on its head. A little flower opens. It pulls out an iron key!

Oswen whispers "thank you very much!" and the blight does a strange, leafy bow. "Do you need more water?" - it nods. Inafina attends while Oswen unlocks the chest with the acquired key.

The Will-o-wisp has watched the whole time. Now, though, it floats down next to her. The wisp, seeing her unlock it, floats back up. Perhaps the lock's magic and wisp are connected.

The chest padlock and top of the chest have in scrawly but somehow beautiful cursive, "**B.B.**"... Bavlorna. Detect Magic is still up, and as the key turns the magic turns off. There was some kind of animation magic on the chest too, which is turned off.

* There's a 12-in tall marionette inside! Faces are on opposite of its head. One face is a moon, the other a sun. It's surprisingly beautiful. It might well just be a beautifully crated toy. Not magical. It is *very* well crafted; why is it in here?

* An unpunched ticket from the Witchlight Carnival. A different design, though. Looking closer, Oswen sees that it looked like it in most regards except the signature - it's signed Isolde. That suggests Mr Witch & Mr Light took their names from the carnival, not the other way around. Perhaps this is also evidence of what happened - **this could be the leverage**. Oswen takes it.

* Three scrolls tied together with a lute string. Nothing fishy about the string, says Detect Magic, nor the scrolls. Oswen carefully slides one out, without breaking the string, and has a look. A scroll of Dispel Magic! Handy. Checks another. Grease. The third? Hold Person.

Inafina insight nat 20+3 -> 23. She looks at the marionette. "Everything in there is very precious. Whatever that is *must* be important. We just don't know why yet. It must be significant." - Oswen carefully takes it and puts in the backpack.

Well, there's one more door. Oswen listens. Perception only 9. Can't hear anything. This feels like pushing our luck... She opens it a crack. Dark inside. She says "Can't see a thing!" and then, just like that, Kindle grants us all Darkvision!

It's a crazy mess of toys, broken furniture, child-size *caskets* and weird oddities - a stag scull hides on a wall; a wooden faceless mannequin wearing a fancy helmet; a white porcelain jar with chicken legs; a 5-foot long bronze statue of a giant frog squatting with mouth agape, filled with a darkness even our Darkvision cannot see through. And then - a weak croaking sound, from near a chest in the middle of the room.

It's a lornling, dying. Gasping. Next to it, a shadow; the shadow of a - a thing! A dagger is tucked into its belt. The lornling has its throat pierced. The shadow has a knife and holds a huge spool of thread; it's surprised to see us come in. The thread looks stolen. The lornling points and gasps, "thief! murderer!" as its last words.

Initiative:

* Inafina adv. 22
* Oswen 17
* Kindle 14
* Bel 9

Inafina looks around the door, sees what's happening, immediately throws a radiant bolt. Nat 20! 2d4+3->8, but the shadow is vulnerable - 16 taken - it is destroyed. Oswen whispers loudly, "Kindle, is the anything you can do for the lornling?" - he casts Healing Word. It stops the lornling from fully dying. It sits up. "Thank you" it says. Unusual to hear one speak. "What was that thing?" asks Oswen. "I followed it in here. It slipped under the door. I had to squeeze in after it! It's a shadow. It's someone's shadow! I saw it sneak in."

Oswen remembers something about someone's shadow being stolen... Well, that's gone now! Perhaps a different shadow.

"It came in. It was looking for something specific. THAT. The threads of despair!"

"Do you know what they do?"

"No. But Bavlorna uses it to stitch her mannequins in! The clothes that she gives to people..."

Oswen can still see in the last few minutes of Detect Magic that it's magic thread; it emanates with Enchantment. The mannequin is magical, the inside of the frog's mouth too (Conjuration). But there's nothing around that seems stitched with this thread. Were she to try the Dispel Magic scroll on the bundle of thread, she won't know if that'd help anything else.

The mannequin's magic is one of Transmutation. The helmet on its head is definitely magical too, but Oswen suspects that taking it might make the mannequin react. The lornling sees her looking; "If that mannequin does not wear a hat, it will attack. It must wear its hat." "Any hat?" The lornling thinks. "I have seen it wear other hats."

There are other hats in the room; Oswen picks one. Inafina is tall enough to swap them. With Guidance, helped by Orvil who flies with the new hat hovering just above, she tries the ol' switcheroo. SOH + Guidance ADV -> 23! She removes the helmet; the mannequin starts to animate aggressively; Orvil drops the hat and the mannequin freezes. Oswen, Arcana 13. A helm of telepathy!

She announces, "Oh! It's a helm of telepathy. Now, I know what you're thinking, but..." - and waits for the joke to land. Tumbleweed.

Bel clears his throat, points to the stags head, "isn't that Clapperclaw's head?" "Guess so!" says Kindle; he walks over and picks it up. "It's very big!" - he carries it under his arm.

Oswen checks to see if the lornling is OK and can get away OK. It agrees to leave before we do anything else! A wise move. It heads out towards the bedroom's balcony door, saying "I see nothing!" as it goes.

The porcelain jar... It has legs painted to look like legs of a chicken. Varnished, white clay. Beautiful actually. There's a small cover. "We're *really* pushing our luck now..." says Oswen and opens it, looking inside. Two broken pieces of a wishbone. Not magical. She tips them out onto the floor. They fit together, so she tries fitting them together even though they seem to not be magical. As she does, she hears an unfamiliar voice! Distant, quiet:

* "**Scabatha forgets the first creature she sees when she wakes up, although her memory of it returns each night when she sleeps. A creature forgotten by Scabatha in this manner is invisible to her senses!**"

The wishbone crumbles to dust! Well - that's useful info. The frog remains but plunging a hand into the darkness of its mouth seems unwise. Oswen pushes around with her staff - half a foot; one foot; nothing. Another half a foot... She senses as she pushes that there's a strange kind of goo or something. Light resistance. She pulls the staff out to examine it. Nothing adheres to the staff. 

Inafina tries with the wooden part of the spear. It's longer. Two foot, three foot... Same deal. "Try the other end" says Oswen; "Maybe metal gets a reaction, but be gentle". So Inafina does that. No change in behaviour. At that length of spear pushed inside, it should've hit the floor. So this is some kind of portal-like effect.

Oswen grabs a cup and tries to "scoop out" some of the darkness. The cup can't be filled. It's hidden when "submerged", there's again a bit of resistance, but when pulled out there's nothing inside. Arcana 17; she thinks back, has she read about this before? It's an extra dimensional space of *some* kind, but she doesn't know what kind. She can't tell if it's safe, or habitable; she's not willing to send in Orvil.

Inafina decides to risk an arm! It might be safe enough for that, if her head is clear. Maybe she can grab something. Bel holds onto her leg in case she's grabbed. He gives her Bardic Inspiration! She gently starts to push her hand into the darkness. It feels like pushing into water, perhaps. Not wet, not cold, but oddly, things seem to brush against her arm... WIS save for fear, 3+3 -> 6 + bardic d6 -> 5, 11; it's very scary and she needs encouragement from the group to proceed... She pushes deeper though... DEX-based perception 18+5 -> 23, suddenly she feels a bit of fabric! "That's fabric - that's - that's cloth or something..." Oswen says, "See if you can pull it!" Inafina tries. As she does, she pulls out of the mouth of this brass frog, a strange - well, *black hole* that starts to empty out junk!

Eventually, she's left with a strange portal in her hand, that's turned inside out. She can invert it, so that the hole is on the inside (!) and does so. It lies on the floor, a great big black hole. When laid out, it's 6ft in diameter. But she can fold the sides of this thing up, so it's a bundle that's not a hole. It forms a soft, silky black handkerchief.

A portable... Hole?!

### 250XP each

- We have a portable hole (and Kindle puts Clapperclaw's head in there - he experiments a while and soon gets the hang of it)
- Scrolls
- A helm of teleportation
- The special ticket to the carnival
- Information on a vulnerability of Scabatha

Oswen goes to take the bundle of thread. She immediately feels self-doubt and frustration! She drops it and says in a rather out-of-character way, "Well that's a stupid idea." Inafina insight 17 recognises that the thread was the reason. So now we need to find a way to wrap it up.

Who was stealing it anyway? And what for? They were willing to kill the lornling. Perhaps one of the sisters? It's strange; it only brings negativity, so it doesn't seem like a "good" person would try to steal it in such a manner using such a creature as the shadow. Oswen insight 18+1 -> 19, wondering who/what might want this. We did hear that the sisters have rivalries but she can't know any more than that. But the thread is innately magical, so Dispel Magic wouldn't work - it can't be "defused" by any powers she has - and it seems bad to let anyone have it. Destroying it might be a good bet.

In any event, Bel donates even *more* clothing and the thread is wrapped up, and stored in the strange folding hole.

We should probably run for it. We've used a fair few resources. But this is our best shot at Bavlorna and she'll be really angry when she sees all the things we've done. Others might suffer for it. So it seems it is now or never. We tiptoe back to the main room and let Vansel know. He should keep hidden up here, or at least on the balcony to flee if need be! Then we need a bit of a plan to get down and surprise Bavlorna.

We could go down and run anticlockwise as a group to try and confuse her. Inafina suggests maybe trying to talk; we don't know Bavlorna, should we give her a chance to explain herself, or atone? Kindle finds this place confusing. He's not happy with the treatment of people he's seen. He's starting to get gloomy! The state of things. No warm hearth.

"That settles it" says Oswen. "I can't ignore what I've seen. And if I'm making a mistake, the Fey will ensure I pay for it. I say we get rid of Bavlorna - if she runs, she runs; if she stays and we best her - so be it. Of course, if she bests *us* - well - that's that! But at least I'll have given it a try. Who's with me?"

Bel says, "Sure! What about the *other* person in the room though?"

Oswen had almost forgotten! The person from the strange storm balloon. Passive perception 15; her ears can easily pick up the conversation downstairs. So now she starts paying attention. A scratchy, high pitched male voice; "...oh yes! It's such a terrible habit and she doesn't even know. She looks so ridiculous!" - then a female voice, cackling. "Yes, Endelyn was always thinking she was the prettiest! She's a fool and doesn't know how ridiculous she looks... A bit of a toy, really!" The man agrees, then starts talking about her "other sister" - Scabatha - "that clockwork key she has in her back! How ridiculous that is." 

It's basically gossip! Inafina's insight (17) can tell that the man is just saying things Bavlorna wants to hear, perhaps stalling and buying time for something. She whispers as much - "he's still there, because he's stalling for some reason - he's not leaving any time soon..."

"Do we tackle them both? Or maybe he'll be on our side?" thinks Oswen, out loud.

The only way to find out is to talk to them. Get down there and try to convince the guy to leave - not his fight - a businessman wants customers and this drowned land has none.

Inafina says she'll go first. She can dodge things that might get thrown her way. Kindle insists on being next - he'll block the view of the other two. Oswen says she'll go third, then, so that Bavlorna is already distracted by three people and might not spend too long trying to look past Bel's ("excellent", she says) disguise. If all else fails we can run up here and jump off the balcony - Oswen has Feather Fall. Inafina will be aided in conversation by Bel, keeping him out of the limelight. Inafina's a Harengon - that ties into Agdon. That works.

3, 2, 1, go!

Down the stairs. A wall to the right, a door at the bottom of the stairs leading to the kitchen, most of the room on our left and a window at the far side. The usual detritus around, including the usual broken plate. There's a bookcase with mouldy books and a cabinet with overgrown moss over the front. Two large armchairs are next to a circular moth-eaten rug, roughly in the middle of the room.

Sat in one of the chairs closer to us, back to us but quite imposing in size or at least bulk, is who we immediately believe to be Bavlorna. Toad-like, but cracked and dried skin, eyes that bulge enough to see them even from our awkward perspective in a strange hand-sewn garment of some sort. Her mouth hangs open, even when she's not speaking; flies fly in and out when she's not! Two versions of her - lornlings - cling to her shoulder and knee.

In the other chair, the man. He's tall, lean and kind of ageless. A grey complexion; old-timey-kinda draped black clothing, as if a friar or priest! He has a wide-brimmed hat obscuring his eyes, but two pinpricks of *light* shine below.

The furniture here was once very fine, it seems, but no more. There are strange mottled stains everywhere, patched repairs abound and abundant general decay. Inafina notices right away that the creature in the far chair is roughly the same size and shape as the shadow we tackled - and she sees no shadow on the floor near it. He's surprised to see the four of us! Bavlorna though is not surprised; she simply says, "So finally! The rude intruders who've been destroying my home decide to enter the room. What act of desperation compels you to enter my home" - she turns to face us - "little darlings?!"

Infina doesn't miss a beat. She points at the man and says, "Well, he had his shadow in your treasure room that killed a lornling and tried to steal your thread!"

A lornling pops out from behind a pile of food. *The* lornling! "It's true! It's true! He murdered me but they saved me!"

The man, who we know as **Charm** acts offended. "Accusations! What about the rule of hospitality?!"

Bavlorna challenges him for daring to cite Fey rules. She glares at him - mouth staying open - flies flitting in and out... Quick as a dart, he stands up and tries to make a dash for the window. But the lornlings are even faster, somehow; they zip so quickly as if a blur. That's scary. They start grabbing him - hair, clothes and so-on and begin to pull him down to the ground. There are only 3 but they seem quite strong too.

Oswen calls to Charm, "Mr Charm, if you would assist us in a fight, I'm sure we can assist you with freedom! Reciprocation!"

He looks at us; "I'll do it in return for the spool of thread that Endelyn wants!"

Balorna yelps. "Ha! I suspected you were one of her spies, you and your balloon and your underlings coming here. I knew this wasn't some casual visit. Always plotting, backstabbing sisters!" - then she looks at us - "I have a deal for you! Do three things for me and I'll grant you what you need. I'll give you a boon."

* "Fix my pool! It's blocked."
* "Find my missing book! It's been stolen."
* "Get me the package of animal parts for my taxidermy."

Oswen calls out, "Deal! How long have we got to get the animal parts to you?" "How long do you want to wait before you get your prize?" Oswen ponders and then says, "What kind of boon?" "What are you after? *You* want to get to my sisters, don't you! I know. You want to get to Thither. I can give you a balloon..." Oswen says, "Ah, I see. So we can have anything we want?" "Why, what were you thinking of?" "You didn't answer my question. Is it *any* boon or only *that* boon?" "I'll consider others!" "OK!" "Why? What is it? What is it you want?" Oswen says, "We'll have to get back and get a boat. We'll be as quick as we can."

Oswen turns to Charm again. "Charm, you sure there's no deal?" Inafina notices that Charm has started to slip from the grasp of the lornlings. He could be a problem... He's seen us and he'll return to Endelyn.

Inafina says, "Not so fast! You haven't answered the question..."

"I don't need your help to escape!" he insists and that's probably true so (as Bavlorna is saying "Do *we* have a deal?") Oswen runs down the stairs, between Kindle's legs and gets in a position to throw Thunderwave at both of them. A boon would be twisted and we'd be obliged to take it; she's figured the same as Inafina - we can't let Charm go if he's seen us - this isn't great but we have to tackle both.

Initiative:

* Kindle 19
* Oswen 16
* Inafina only 13, despite ADV roll
* Bel 6

Kindle casts Bless on the three of us (+d4 on attacks and saving throws) and Oswen throws her Thunderwave. Potential damage only 2d8->7+1->8. CON13 save, which Bavlorna *just* misses - 5+7! - she tumbles off the chair and is pushed against the wall. Charm resists - the noise hurts him a bit but he doesn't get pushed away.

Oswen shouts "remember to run around!" and Oswen starts doing it herself.

Inafina runs between Charm and Bavlorna; she stabs Charm with her spear, but only for 1d8->3+3->6 damage. She tries to strike Bavlorna too, hitting for a max 1d4+3->7 damage. She starts to run in small circles too. Bavlorna looks amazed; "What are you doing?!" - but then she starts to sneeze! She can't cast spells! But Inafina's in melee range, right there in between her and Charm; she tries to grab at Inafina, surprisingly strong (+6), trying to stop Inafina from running. It's a whopping 22, and Inafina is grabbed. "Stop running around you crazy rabbit!"

Charm looks at all of us and says, "Stand back! Stand back!" - he pulls out a stiletto sword, trying to stab at the lornlings who are holding clothes. He misses one but skewers another, killing it outright!

Bel rolls acrobatically down the stairs for a dramatic entrance, then casts Bane. Oswen is almost is almost shocked at some of the things he says as he magically berates the two of them. CHA saves, Bavlorna fails; Charm fails too! They're both cursed (d4 deduction from attack rolls and saving throws). Bel also gives bardic inspiration to Inafina. He kicks his legs and starts running in circles too. Bavlorna is furious - but sneezing again!

Kindle isn't sure who to go for! "Um - um - I guess - all right...!" - he runs over to flank Charm with Inafina and attacks with his mace. Hits; 8 damage. Charm's not in danger yet but does look a bit beaten up! "Stay down!" shouts Kindle, getting enthusiastic (but trying to hold his Bless concentration).

Oswen uses her last L2 to throw scorching rays at Bavlorna. 7 damage on the first hit; barely seems to be scratching her. Thanks to Bless, two more hits; 10 and 8 more; but Bavlorna still looks kinda OK, except for the sneezing! Oswen does the circling thing.

Inafina attacks Bavlora. The spear hits but for a lousy 1d8->2+3 -> only 5 damage, unarmed strikes in a flurry, two more hits, but still only d4->2+3 -> 5 damage, then 5 again. There's a long way to go yet. Bavlorna in return tries to *bite* Inafina! Despite Bane, it finds its mark. Oswen notices disturbingly that she seems to be trying to *swallow* something but can't due to the sneezing. Even so, Inafina takes 13 damage. Only 8hp left.

Charm attacks Kindle now. The first swing misses; but the second is a crit! Bane doesn't stop that. *19* damage, because there's a strange necrotic effect. Kindle is very badly hurt! Only 5hp left. He *just* holds Bless.

Bel sees these two bad blows landing, threatening to turn the course of battle. He decides that protection is better than revenge and wants to heal Kindle, *but* that would mean he has to stop running in circles, leaving only Oswen able to do that, and who knows what might happen to her! But Oswen shouts, "I'm still going in circles!" and that makes up Bel's mind. He runs over to lay hands on Kindle for Cure Wounds in a giant, strangely Mirthful Leap. It only adds 11hp back, which is a lot less damage than the scimitar can deal, but it's better than nothing.

Kindle holds up his holy symbol and calls on Yondala to "protect us all!" - he activates his Twilight Sanctuary. At the end of each of our turns for the next minute, we gain 1d6+3 temp HP. So we have that *and* bless. He gets 7 temp HP himself as his turn ends.

Oswen is running low on options. She continues to focus on Bavlorna; Ray of Frost hits thanks to Bless, 6 damage, no vulnerability to cold either. She shouts, "Oh, by the way, we *did* fix your pool. You had a gelatinous cube infestation!" - and she gets 9 temp HP from the Sanctuary.

Inafina sees the danger. Charm is a problem. She attacks with the spear - thanks to both Bless *and* the Bardic Inspiration, she *just* hits. A maximum 11 damage; Charm gasps in surprise; a strange pool of darkness leaks out of him - and then he *explodes* in a flash of embers! CON (not DEX) saves from everyone, DC11.

* Inafina kinda wasted nat 20+1->21, takes 3 damage
* Oswen 16+1->17, takes 3 damage
* Bel sadly can't make it - 3+0+1 for Bless -> 4! He takes 7 damage **and is *blinded!***
* Kindle makes it, takes 3 damage

Inafina recovers 6 temp HP after taking the 3 damage. Bavlorna meanwhile also is only hit for 3 and isn't blinded.

Bavlorna has a choice of the room, though she's still holding onto Inafina; she does Withering Ray at Oswen, but thanks to Bane and Oswen's mage armour in the boat, it *just* misses. She tries to bite Inafina but that, too, *just* misses thanks to Bane. She commands a lornling to get into her mouth but it refuses! "No! I don't want to be eaten!" - we surmise it might've given her health.

Poor is Bel is blinded! "What - what's going on? Where is everyone? Why's it so dark!" - Kindle says Generic Reassuring Things in response. So Bel decides to cast L2 Dissonant Whispers, because he just has to *think* about Bavlorna for *that* to have a chance of working. He starts to chant a strange, disturbing, discordant melody. WIS save. With Bane, she matches the DC so makes the save. It still causes 8 psychic damage. He's feeling around, and has a hold on Kindle's fur; he picks up 8 temp HP from the sanctuary, but then suddenly exclaims, as he sees Kindle, "Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't know what I was grabbing!"

Kindle runs alongside the still-grappled Inafina and attacks with the mace; hits; a solid further 8 damage. Oswen tries another Ray Of Frost, hitting for 5 damage; and Inafina tries again. She gets in a spear attack for 8, but misses with an unarmed strike.

Bavlorna tries to bite Kindle this time! Thanks - again! - to Bane, it misses. So now she tries her withering ray again, this time at Bel. Disadvantage on those rays due to being in melee, and this misses too. She's still sneezing as Oswen - getting dizzy! - continues her circles. Bel in return says, "No! No you don't. You're an awful, awful person!" - and with his last L2 spell, casts Dissonant Whispers once again. She still saves, annoyingly, but she still takes 6 damage. Not what he wanted for the cost of L2, but we're chipping away...

Kindle attacks again. Crit! He *really* means it. 10 damage; Bavlorna is very badly injured now. Just clinging on. She's uncontrollably sneezing and her strange dry form seems to be starting to crack - fall away! She's starting to panic...

Once again, Oswen sees this and just can't help but feel a pang of sorrow and pity. 

...Strangely, mould around the room is *fading*. Was that all directly part of her control over the realm? That gives Oswen the strength to run forward - one thing *can't* miss, even if Bavlorna resists the worst of it - her last L2; Thunderwave, up close. **BOOM! Nat 1 on the save - 11 damage. Bavlorna is no more** - she's splattered against the wall, almost like a frog imprint!

Instantly, the room begins to change. Mould dries up and dies. The smell and damp mist abate; a breeze begins to blow through. Clattering down onto the floor, from where Bavlorna was splashed, is a small key.

Lornlings around gasp, stading open-mouthed; but then small will-o-wisps pop out, as the lornlings turn into puddles. The will-o-wisps fly out of windows. Motes of light drift up from Bavlorna's remains on the wall, drifting away out of the window.

Oswen runs up to Inafina, badly injured with really only the temp HP keeping her up, and calls to Bel for help. He casts his last Cure Wounds for her. She gets 16gp - which is *exactly* to full health! She gives him a big hug and thanks him. Bel removes his disguise! We check on Kindle; he's OK, injured but alright. Oswen says to him, "We did it, big guy!" as Kindle pulls us all into a hug.

Oswen looks around; "Hey! It *is* fixing itself. Some of it. Maybe what we hoped for will happen, at least a little... Even without Zybilna being freed!"

We don't know about the flooding, or all those who were drowned in this awful event; but the mist and smell is certainly clearing from round here.

She kneels down and looks at the key - it's a strange key, with three symbols that are arranged as if circling a gap in the middle, like something missing. What could this be for? She asks Inafina to have a look; the two of them converse and while doing so, Oswen notices (investigation 16) the same symbol on a cabinet. She goes over to see if the key works. It fits into the keyhole; but it would be a shame to be incautious and get caught out by a trap. So the others let her spend few minutes casting Detect Magic as a ritual. Vansel is fetched by Infina and the rest of the group check an adjacent room.

Three tall windows are shuttered. This seems to be an aviary; but the birds in cages are taxidermy. It looks like they might've been magically animated once but have lost magic now. Above the window to the East balcony is "Thither"; to the Northern balcony, "Yon". It seems to be a way of sending messages - at least for Bavlorna - using these strange (un)dead birds. Yikes. Inafina opens the shutters on the third window, just to let the light in.

Oswen's ritual finishes. No traps! Inside however it is a multicolour feast for the magical eyes. She opens the cabinet to examine what lies within. Three magical potions, amongst many non-magical (and probably poisonous!) - with hand-written labels.

* Shrink
* Grow
* Vanish

All that remains is to check on any other rooms we might've missed and get out of here. We wonder what effects our actions have had on the town below. We know we need to get the heart back to Octavian and the head back to Clapperclaw. Vansel says he'll come with us, thanking us for saving him. Then he exclaims, "Oh! Wait! I nearly forgot... The rule of reciprocity." He looks around, finds a small rose of all things - small flowers are starting to sprout out of the woodwork! - picks it, studies it, then says to Oswen, "What's your favourite colour?"

Oswen thinks back to carnival. Leonidas had a green jacket he favoured, and wore it that night. "Green" she says.

"A beautiful colour" - he kisses the rose, which turns green, but then changes to look almost crystalline, rather than natural. "A gift in return for freeing me" he says, handing it to her. Oswen's magical vision is still up; this is a magical item - a green chromatic rose - "Your highness, a beautiful rose to keep you safe." "Thank you! This is wonderful!"

We find nothing else of interest in the house, checking floor by floor; it's decreasingly grim and all improving minute by minute. We do find in the pantry that lids of barrels and jars down there have popped open and there's a procession of **Campestri** - happy, smiling, colourful mushrooms chatting away! They burst into song at our arrival. Bel has heard of these and tells us they love to sing. Bel spends a moment teaching them a new song; he says they remember it forever. They recite it back once learned - a little inaccurately, but good enough!

Down at the pool level, the bobbing lily pad is still there. It almost looks lost. Oswen calls to it, suspecting sentience, "Why not follow us? Come with us, and see if you find anything you want to do." Arcana 5+5->only 10; she doesn't understand how it might work but thinks spending time with it could be useful. It drifts down the stairs, then rests afloat on the surface of the pond.

Down there, the Bullywogs are in a panic. The king has been murdered! So much for them waiting. "So, we don't have a boat..." says Oswen - but the lily pad seems to be waiting for us to get on - "...but I think we can all squeeze onto that? Kindle, you'd better go first and stand in the middle, see if it takes your weight".

We all get on. The lily pad seems overloaded so moves slowly, Oswen apologising as we go, "But not far now!" - and she asks it to go towards where the mushrooms and Octavian are. We don't really want to be going through the palace right now!

We reach the south end of the bridge from the palace, which is the lowest place at the water's edge. Here, the big tree is fully alive and movnig, tugging on the rope. A giant toad has now fully escaped; Inafina helps - Animal Handling 15 - she helps get it under control. It opens its mouth and another bullywug is pulled out by his feet! We learn that Illig has taken over, but the old king isn't dead... So the new king isn't the new king... The old king is badly injured, so must surely die soon!

Oswen tries to speak to three wight but it's enraged as the bullywogs had been attacking the sprites. We all in the end figure we'll leave them to it! Their town, their rules - without Bavlorna corrupting things anyway.

All around the mist is clearing; navigation on the lily pad was quite easy and now we can clearly see the nearby mushroom "forest" and head there directly, looking for Octavian. He's in the same spot! "We have great news!" says Oswen. "We've found your heart!"

"Oh! What? Yes! Oh, I can sense it!"

We take the bundled heart out of the backpack and carefully unwrap it - still in its jar.

"I feel like I would be very grateful and thankful for this! I feel I would be very much overjoyed."

Oswen says, "That's OK - it's good that you know how you should feel, but now, hopefully, you *can* feel at least some of it."

"This can remove the curse" he says, "but someone needs to read it" - and hands her - well, not a scroll. It's a tube with runes in rows; the tube is rotated to read it. A scroll that's always rolled! It's easy enough to understand the spell - Remove Curse - but that's a higher level spell so would involve some risk. Kindle sees her concern and gives her some Guidance. "Just be calm and read it carefully... Think about being at home in front of the fireplace!"

Oswen tries. It goes really well! 18+5+1 -> 24. As the curse is lifted, something really interesting happens. The spell doesn't just affect the heart; it seems to emanate out wider, as if pushing against the space around Oswen. There's a burst of colour, but then - the heart disappears. It is replaced by a dead, desiccated lump of tissue - for a moment Oswen is horrified but then realises this is the goat's heart that was put into Octavian. He suddenly gasps, picks up Oswen and hugs her - beaming and smiling, almost singing, hugging all of us in turn. Suddenly, all around, little daisies spring up. Even the clouds part a little and dappled sunlight breaks through to some of the area around.

"It's a curse!" says Oswen. "Of course. The simplest thing, just a very powerful one - I think that's how Bavlorna did it. Or they *all* did it. They cast a curse on the whole land, and all it needs is powerful enough to remove that curse."

What's more, there's more to it - the old, desiccated heart is a big part of it. We shelter in the mushrooms as she ritual-casts Identify. There's a form of abjuration magic around the heart, which had a sort of invulnerability that protected and nurtured the curse in this area. But Octavian is no longer a conduit for keeping the curse in place. The Identify spell says that, if she's ever in a pinch - *eating* the heart would be akin to a potion of invulnerability, that being the magic that was imbued into it!

She explains - to obvious disgusted faces! She feels the same but it's useful anyway.

**The curse is lifting - the effect spreads slowly but surely. Water nearby is definitely clearer. Mist clears faster. Moss and mould retreats. This part of the domain, at least, is getting freed.**

Octavian asks for one more favour - he wants to get out of Downfall. We want to leave to another domain, but we figure we can pick up Clapperclaw, get away from the arguing Bullywugs on water and figure it out from there. There's a boat tied nearby, which Vansel and Octavian take. We lead the way on the lilypad, which is a little faster but still heavily laden, and head towards the bridge with the spikes and heads. That's where he should be!

Sure enough, with no mist, we can see from a distance that he's on the bridge - apparently trying to calm down the various over-excited heads. We call over - "We have your head!" - "OK! Hold on! Can you come up here and I'll jump on your... Lily pad?" - so Kindle gingerly lowers himself into the boat to make it easier for the lily pad to hover, and we collect Clapperclaw. Then we float back down. "The head's big" says Inafina, "So we need somewhere to unpack it - do you know anywhere safe?" "Yes! Back to past the balloon factory."

Ah! Where we came in. We know the way. As we go, we notice a storm balloon rising - out of control! - that crashes into the side of Bavlorna's cottage, then crashing into the guard tower on the other side of the entrance. It's done for; it collapses down onto the ground. The two darklings jump free and run off, chased by bullywugs.

Oswen looks to Inafina. Inafina looks to Oswen. "Do you think... Is it finder's keepers in the fey...?" "Yes, if something is lost. And those two left it behind..." "Well, we *could* have a look, just quickly...!"

Then Oswen suddenly sits up and goes, "Oh! No! I'm not sure I can risk it. Technically, they offered us deals for everything in there, and even if they've abandoned it, I'm not sure if the fey wild would consider that deal previously offered a sort of contract. If I were to just, say, take that monocle, it might be bad. I can't be sure and we don't really *need* anything, and these two need to be helped to safety."

We decide against looting!

We get to land and unfold the portable hole; Kindle pulls out the stag's head. Clapperclaw is overjoyed! "How do we do this?" asks Kindle. "I'll take this off and won't be able to see until you put that on!" and simply pulls of his head. Kindle pushes on the stag's head. "Is that right?" he asks.

There's nothing for a heart-stopping moment - but then the eyes blink. "Ah! Great!" - he puts down the pumpkin; he rolls it and pops out coins inside, handing them to us. 10gp! He's sure he wants us to have it. "Agdon put them in there to annoy me."

Clapperclaw can take us to Thither, but we must now head East to the edge of Hither, and he explains that the forest path he spoke of before is beyond the causeway. We'd be going back through Agdon's territory. We have a boat and a lily pad. Everyone wants to get out. The lily pad can easily float along the river we used to get here, against the current, and help tow the boat if need be in addition to padding (since it's against the current). We start out, looking ideally to park up somewhere on dry land before the causeway, and before Agdon, but clear of Downfall and the bullywogs.

As it transpires, we get to he causeway without finding anywhere better, but upon searching between its great pillars find some dry land amongst the swamp. The water level is receding again; but it could rise; so we camp as high as we can, up against one of the pillars that is atop this mound of dry land.

It's been a long day!

Kindle is happy to cook. Everyone pitches in to hunt, mostly fish, but we also forage. We have enough without needing rations, given that we can create a fire - Oswen gets that going with magic as usual. We end up with an amazing fish stew made by Kindle.

Octavian and Bel decide to play music. Oswen joins in on the flute - performance 15+0, one of her better efforts! Soon we're all chipping in and it's a strange party; levity in the air.

Octavian says at one point, "I never did thank you properly! Hmm, well, I have this! I'd like you to have this" - he says to our group. He hands us pipes he plays sometimes. "I know it's probably not something you might necessarily ask for or buy for yourselves, but it's also not something suitable for me anymore; it just remidns me what happens". They're Pipes Of Haunting. Oswen finds them interesting - she could certainly play them - though they seem more Bel's style. "I can't play it!" he says. "I never thought it would be as useful to have a wind instrument because then I couldn't sing while I play!" Oswen gets the pipes by default!

### 1375XP each -> exactly to LEVEL 4

Finally, at long last, we rest. Watch is taken, with enough people for ADV perception checks (not in order):

* Inafina (with Octavian's help) 24
* Oswen (with Orvil's help) 16
* Bel (with Vansel's help) 21
* Kindle (with Clapperclaw's help) 23

Each successive watch notices that water seems to be getting lower, rather than rising. By the third watch, Kindle is happy to finally see the moon and stars in the sky! It's no longer overcast. No more perpetual twilight; there's a familiarity. Fog lifts. The weird rotting smell is abating too. When twilight gives way to dawn, it's visibly more brightly coloured too.



## Day 6, underneath the causeway

Inafina awakes feeling more lithe and agile than ever before (ability score improvement: +2 DEX).

Oswen has learned some DEX tricks for ACRO (Proficient now) from seeing others do so well the last few days, and her mastery of magic reaches expertise for ARC. She feels a bit smarter, too... (+1 INT rising 15 to 16). She learns Message, Magic Missile and Dragon's Breath.

Bel and Kindle also find themselves with bolstered abilities (scores) and Bel learns some new spell tricks, rather like Oswen - Hold Person and Unseen Servant.

**We all now see the changes. The brighter colours, clearer sky, lower water - life returns to this realm! It's what we had hoped for, at least in part, and perhaps more than we ever expected so soon.**

Bel wants to make tea for everyone - this is received with enthusiasm! "I think you'll be surprised how much better a day can be if you start it in a civilised way. Just because you're out camping, doesn't mean we have to give up on the advances of society!"

The boat and lily pad once more get underway, hoping to avoid Agdon, but suspecting his prolific presence, especially in light of the obvious changes now to this realm, might well catch up with us. We decide to tackle it head on and head for the stump.

The area is ever-more changed as time goes by. We can see the area around the stump is much drier. The rickety walkways are treacherously high above the water now. A few boats look like they might even be grounded. Some of the huge roots are visible now. The more robustly-constructed side stair set doesn't even reach the water level. Harengon run around, unsteady on the wobbly walkways.

Two rafts depart and head towards us as we approach; Agdon is on one. He points! "I knew it! I knew it! You had something to do with this!" and Inafina shouts back, "We certainly did!" Agdon calls back, "I misjudged you. You're trouble!" and Inafina retorts, "You may or may not have misjudged us, but we're not trouble; we're the end of trouble. We're where things start to get better. You can be part of it. All of you!" "Come up to the stump and we'll talk." "OK!"

So we paddle to the rather dangerous walkways, all the way to the stump. The lily pad can rise up to the stair base; but it needs to be lighter. Clapperclaw, Inafina and Oswen ride it up. That leaves a crowded boat of Kindle, Bel, Vansel and Octavian to climb ropes to reach the bottom. Oswen keeps silent! Inafina calls as the lily pad rises - "Keep a *close* eye on your belongings, everyone. He's *much* faster than he should be."

Curiously, it seems that (DM dice roll) Agdon is none the wiser about Oswen - though she lacks her Haregon makeup now! He's focused on Inafina.

Clapperclaw doesn't like Agdon - they captured her - and Oswen whispers assurances, "We'll keep you safe, stay calm" - Kindle is being *very* protective too, with Vansel and Bel flanking too.

Up top, Agdon says, "I see you've brought bodyguards and muscle. What have you done?"

"These aren't bodyguards, but they are muscle. We rescued them from Downfall."

"Why is everything changing?"

"Bavlorna is gone."

There's a gasp. Mutterings, questions. The harengon are startled.

"But there is a better way. A future here, if you want it. Agdon, you're a thief at heart..." - she tries to convince him that there's a better way; he can be a king of something new. The other harengon are worried that Agdon can't protect them without Bavlorna's deal. So Inafina challenges Agdon - if nobody can catch him, he must be the fastest and the best! "No one here is fast enough to catch me! No-one!" - one points at Inafina and says, "But she caught Bavlorna!"

It's on! Bel gives bardic inspiration to Inafina. Kindle says that he thinks Ogden is kind of a bully and while he might be redeemable it's too much of a risk to let him lead a band of brigands; he adds Guidance. Clapperclaw is also very much not a fan! She had a *very* bad time with these people. Inafina finds *that* convincing. Agdon must at least atone for that behaviour. A form of reciprocity. She's going to really try to catch him.

Agdon runs for it! Inafina needs to be able to grab him, an unarmed strike - and then needs to be able to hold onto him (ATHL check).

* The grab attack roll is 22. AC19, she gets hold of him - by the scarf!
* He tries to pull left and right, very quickly, trying to wriggle free.
* With 4 on guidance, 5 on bardic inspiration and just 11 on ATHL (a -1 stat), dirty 20.
* It's a draw; Agdon's +7 ACRO roll is also 20. Stalemate.
* There's not much Inafina can do. More guidance and inspirtation, another ATHL check is only 9-1->8, d6 now is only 2 for inspiration, d4 guidance is only 1. A very low 11. He escapes.

Inafina is crestfallen but Bel calls out, "Look everyone, she *did* catch him! Sure, he twisted away, but he *said* that 'No one here is fast enough to catch me', yet she did! And did you see? She held him a moment! And that's all you need! He was caught and he has lost!" - Bel's trying to be a bit deceptive here, casting the idea of that brief grapple with the scarf as Agdon being caught. Oswen breaks her silence! To Agdon's astonishment, she adds, "Oh my goodness! He's right!" - there's a gasp as the presumed-voiceless person speaks.

ADV Deception: 26.

Agdon tries to argue that he got away and is very persuasive (19) but it's not enough. What's more, Agdon's indignant reaction to Oswen speaking is the deal breaker; the fact he was - in the Harengon band's mind - so easily fooled is the end of it.

"It was fun while it lasted, wasn't it, though? Bavlorna's not here to protect you anymore though. And she's not here to protect us either. It's too risky now."

Agdon's ears are down. He's sulking. He looks to us. "You've ruined all my fun."

Oswen says, "There are two kinds of fun - fun that's actually good, and enjoyable, and positive. And fun that's selfish, for one person, and done at the expense of others. You need to find the first kind of fun and stop finding the second. Or you're just going to end up pinned to a tree again."

"Pah! You're just like all those other people who've said that to me for the last 300 years! You all suck!" - and he storms off, scarf uncharacteristically trailing on the ground.

Oswen is very conflicted! It seems sad; yet she knows how badly people like Clapperclaw or Jinglejangle have been treated. Really, the rest of the haregon just taking their loot and leaving is injustice in itself. So she shouts, "You lot! Wait a minute! The law of ownership. Who said you owned all that stuff?"

"Agdon said it was ours!"

Clapperclaw sasy "But it's not! It's not yours. Like this head that you took! It's mine."

There's some argument.Surely they can take one thing... Oswen says, "Some if it - might be lost. And yours for the taking. The people who owned it are, sadly, gone now. But you need to find out. So you have to go and visit the places you stole from, if you want to keep something."

"But that's impossible! There's so much stuff here!"

Kindle suggests that they take one item each, that they know was lost. If they can figure that out. E.g. it was from deep water, where something was flooded, but they found it beforehand. There aren't many, and the divvy those up, and it *just about* works. The rest was obtained through banditry.

Kindle suggests we bag up the rest with the portable hole. We take it to the Inn At The End Of The Road. It can spread the word and give things back where they're found. That'll also bring customers! And bring a bit of community and connection. Oswen asks Orvil to fly off and start doing some searching, while the harengon sort through the things - inevitable arguments!

Kindle catalogues the rest diligently and puts the pieces into the portable hole. For all our differences, the brigands were led astray; we hope they've learned a lesson?! They were trying to make the best of a difficult time as the floods happened. We bid them farewell and hope they can find a more - legal, normal, positive way of life from here. There are plenty of opportunities in a land freed from a hag.

As for Agdon, he's long gone - last seen disappearing into the woods.

Orvil aces the search for the inn - perception nat 20, for 22. It's in a more clear area that's easier to spot thanks to lack of mist, and lack of water making things more distinct. It's amongst low, rolling hills. There are even paved roads visible. He decides to try and catch the attention of the Tabaxi, "doing a Lassie" - but CHA-based performance, nat 6 - 2 -> 4! Epatus, the tortle, sees a bird kind of, well, fucking out. He holds out some bird seed! It's not going to work. Orvil keeps trying to fly a pattern that is *surely obvious!* - Epatus calls for Tsu. Tsu is able to talk to Orvil directly, and asks what's wrong; he explains - turn the inn around! Head for the stump! Um... Please! "Lead the way!" she says, and starts pulling on levers.

A while later, the inn is within sight of the stump. Orvil flies ahead to find Oswen; the harengon have disappointed. Yay! The inn is here.

The lily pad transports people up to the inn from the stump. Tsu, the tortle Epatus and the cub Steinn have a big group of new people. Everyone catches up with a big chat. Clapperclaw explains that he needs to get to the start of the forest at the end of the mist, so that she can take our group through. It'll lead through mists safely; she can take us to the Woods Of Thither, to **Nib's cave** - a friend of his. Octavian and Vansel have meanwhile noticed some maintenance issues! They offer to help with fixing up, cooking, cleaning and so-on. They're trying to cheer Tsu up. The cub takes an immediate liking to Vansel. The two decide to stay! They'll help refit the inn, get the rooms repaired and help run it as a proper going concern.

We offer to let Clapperclaw look after the lilypad - we think it'll be happier in an area with water and no danger! Besides, it's a bit... Conspicuous and Oswen can't speak for the others but it reminds her of Bavlorna and she'd rather not be. If Clapperclaw feels the same, he can just leave it happily in a pond somewhere!

Kindle wants to put his cook's utensils into the portal hole. Of course! It's better than carrying them around at full weight in his pack.

The cub is thrilled to hear that Octavian and Vansel are going to stay. He's opening up a little.

Clapperclaw gives Tsu directions, as she says we might as well bring the whole inn across. We might pick up more people along the way. It'll take a day.

Kindle and Tsu work with his catalogue of taken things and they figure out how to document things, keep them at the inn in a storeroom and hand them over if found. "We need to have a sign made to let people know!" Oswen helps on that, with her quill.

People get to work - fixing up the house, cleaning, fishing - in what water remains (rivers are becoming distinct now); this is a hilly landscape with beautiful trees in some areas. Some have died, but others have not; the area is grand, even in this early stages of recovery.  All across the land, we see signs of improvement. Tsu explains that the original realm had beautiful, majestic mountains to the West; and to the East, one of the most beautiful magical enchanted forests she'd ever seen. In the middle, the bridges and causeways leading to the island that held the Palace Of Heart's Desire.

When not otherwise busy, Oswen and Orvil keep looking to see if there are signs of people returning who might've been lost, but without Zybilna being freed yet, she doesn't hold out too much hope. 

Tsu wants to thank us. Oswen says, "But what for?" "For bringing back life and hope! And... Helping me fix the inn! And bringing me a family" - she looks to Vansel and Octavian. "The house appreciates it too. I have some old inks that maybe you might like, given how much you like to write?"

It amounts to enough to copy a L2 scroll, or two L1 scrolls. This is a huge thing for Oswen and she's very thankful. She isn't sure what to copy right now! Many options. She decides to keep the inks for later. Dispel Magic would be a good one, but that's L3. As she puts things into her pack, she notices the small bag of gems; stuff that was going to Bavlorna, but never reached her. There are also a few valuables. She adds *those* - as trinkets can be easy for people to identify - to the store room, but we agree that the gems are impossible to figure out and that one seems to fall to us, then, to keep.

The day goes by with chores, watching the landscape, chatting; we don't have books to read, but we have plenty of company. Surprisingly, the sign - being trailed as a banner by the inn - already starts to work; people flag us down and some of the stolen items are returned. A promising start!

The day draws towards twilight - sunrise, then twilight, with little between (and Oswen realises how much she'd missed that with the strange, overcast skies of "before"). As it does, Kindle kicks everyone out of the kitchen! "I have a proper kitchen today! I need space to do my work - I am going to cook us a family meal."

We play music to entertain ourselves while he rattles away in the kitchen. The cub Steinn is getting much less withdrawn. Kindle calls out for help lifting something so Bel heads in. Shortly after the dining room is set and we're invited in to sit down for the meal. There are whole fish, braised with mushrooms, potatoes, leeks and all kinds of other herbs and additions. There's a soup to go with it. Kindle has been very busy. We sit and dine - it's amazing food.

As dinner wraps up and conversation gets more lively, Bel starts to share a story. He tells of the Summer Court - what it's like to be there, with Queen Tatania. The intrigue, the festivals, the pageantry. He talks about the rivalries people have, but there's sadness too as the reason he ended up there - the reason he is a bard, in fact - is to continue the oral traditions of his circle; his tribe, of sorts, of satyrs that lived in a particular part of the fey wild. But they succumbed to a wasting curse and were lost; he believes he is the last of them, who escaped. He's not sure why he got away when they didn't. He doesn't want that kind of devastation to happen again and that's why he volunteered to be a courtier... To make sure that the stories aren't forgotten and have people keeping an eye out even for the most far-flung corners of the Fey Wild, that Summer Court might otherwise overlook.

Other stories are told; Oswen's, in brief; why she's here. And then Kindle - he's asked why he worships Yandala, a Halfling god. "Well, I owe Yondala and her followers a lot. I owe who I am to them!" He explains that he used to be a Bugbear knight in "a previous life", much younger. He hoped to be a great fighter - a leader - maybe even a general! He looked up to the great Bugbear strategists.

One day he was in battle against a dragon and it went badly. He was left for dead, with most of his company slain. When everyone left the battlefield, halflings who lived nearby came through - he thought they were scavenging at first! He mustered what strength he could, grabbed a spear and ordered them to not take from the dead! But in fact they were trying to find injured people who could be saved. They brought people back to their parish, showing a level of hospitality - an openness and kindness - he'd never experienced before, despite them being bugbears. He was nursed back to health and during that time he learned about their god and who had taught *them* to be the way they were. This spoke to him - real, and true, and important. More authentic than things he'd learned as a warrior. So he became a cleric.

"So we have to make sure that when we're dealing with the other two sisters, we don't let it turn into vengeance for the terrible things they've done - and they are terrible, if Bavlorna's anything to go by. It has to be - to free Zybilna, to protect. It can't be about atonement, or judgement, as best we can manage anyway."

Talk about protecting those you love jolts Oswen a bit. "It's selfish, I suppose... But... We've been here - four, five nights? I can't even remember, it's been a blur. A short time by any reckoning, but I'm changed. I can feel it and I know it. I'm faster to attack. I don't know if that's wise. Do you think Leonidas will recognise me, eventually, if I get back to him? Will he recognise *any* of us?"

"We don't know. We don't even know how time behaves."

The tortle clears his throat... "We're not static souls. Everyone is changing always, all the time. We touch each other's lives, when we are in physical contact; we grow separately when we apart, but we grow back together when we are near. That's just the way life is."

Octavian agrees that "being static" is to hardly live at all - he says that's why he left Elven society. "For all the heartache that this entails, I wouldn't have it any other way - I have experienced so much more in my life than I would have, and loved so many more people, each love being whole and real and eternal. It's better to live with the pain of loss having had the experience of love, than to have it cut out - as was done to me."

Oswen thinks for a minute then looks to Inafina and says "But, you were the first I bumped into. Literally! But if you don't mind me asking - where are you from? I actually realise I don't know much about you, at least not your past. Just your present!"

Inafina doesn't mind sharing; it's in the air tonight, it seems. She's not from the same plane at all! She's from a world where she grew up as part of an Order that lived in a mountain city above the clouds. A holy city, that pilgrims would visit; but she was born there. She grew up as a sun worshipper, learning the ways of the monastery. There were great heroes - great monks - who had lived very long lives, wise beyond words; she idolised one in particular, who still lived, and wanted to be just like her. She was a bit of a rebel in some ways - a leader, one who led people to reach out and spread the word, rather than being a closed society. She believed in sharing knowledge. Before she became a full member of the Order, Inafina had fancied herself to be a follower of this great leader and joined one of their escapades out. But *something* happened - and she's cagey about what it was - which somehow brought great shame to her and her family. She embarrassed herself in front of her hero. She felt so disappointed... What's worse, she was told by the Order's leader that, to save her family from the shame, she should leave and never come back. If she wanted to go out and teach, and spread, and do all the things this great hero did, then maybe that is her calling - but she would never be welcome back into the monastery. In her shame and despair, she left; she wandered down the mountains, to hills, to valleys; by chance, she stumbled across the Witchlight Carnival. She put her skills to work there - people had never seen them before. She's a performer, a gladiator, great marshal skill which she channelled a performance art.

Oswen is very moved by this. "That just feels like another example of excessive judgement; of people being too heavy handed."

"Until I've become as great a hero as the heroine, I could go back, I think" says Inafina. "Once I've gained enough wisdom."

"Well, I don't think they deserve you today, never mind tomorrow" says Oswen. "Clearly, I've lived a comparatively easy live! Free of such judgements, by and large. I've been very lucky, despite all the things that have happened."

Oswen then goes - "Oh yes! And somehow, against all the odds, we need to find someone who looks like a goblin that once went by the name of Earnest but is now a monkey, and get the money-Earnest back to Marigold to see if the two can be swapped back! So there's Burly's brother Hurly, Dirlagaun's cub Star, Earnest... Mcuh has gone wrong."

It's been a beautiful meal. Tea and spiced pumpkin to finish. Steinn starts to yawn and we all feel that! It's bed time. We ask if our previous rooms on the top floor are OK to use? Tsu says, yes no problem. We retire to bed. We don't even need to do watch - but Kindle just wants to. He joins the others downstairs. So in that case we *all* pitch in.

* Inafina (with Octavian's help) 15
* Oswen (with Orvil's help) 17
* Bel (with Vansel's help) 14
* Kindle (with Clapperclaw's help) 22

It's not really needed, but it's good practice to keep up!



## Day 7 at the Inn At The End Of The Road

There is an amazing oat porridge with berries, glazed nuts and honey, along with tea. The Inn is at the mists; Clapperclaw is looking out and figuring where the entrance he wants is. The inn is moved to the right place and the inn lowers down, with a rope ladder to let us off.

Hugs all round. Even Steinn! He gives us a little carving he's made from a piece of wood, of a little lion cub. "We shall treasure this, thank you" says Inafina. He says, "This is so you can remember what I looked like because the next time you see me I will be all grown up!"

With all the goodbyes over, Clapperclaw leads the way, Orvil flying overhead in small circles. Once we get to the mist entrance, he Clapperclaw suggests we should rope up! Orvil perches on Oswen's shoulder and ropes are tied. Clapperclaw, Oswen, Bel, Infina, Kindle - order of height, so we can see over each other. As he is about to pass into the mist, Kindle waves to the inn; people wave back; as he moves into the woods and the mist, he hears the sounds of the inn starting to move away.

We're told to *not* wander off and carefully the person in front of you.

It could be a long time, or a short time. It's hard to judge. We can't see anything much in the mist, apart from trees when very close. Is it 10? 15? 25? minutes?! Suddenly, the mist clears; a sweet scent on the breeze; dappled light, warm browns, dark greens, verdant. There are even some purples, oranges and reds from aerial orchids in trees. This is a lush, thick forest. We're through.

Clapperclaw - whispering, interestingly - says, "Welcome to Thither! We can untie each other. Stay with me and I'll lead you to Nib's cave. That's as far as I go. Nib can be trusted! He's a friend."

### 200XP (for completing the loose ends).

Clapperclaw leads us on. Oswen ADV (with Orvil) perception 17, Inafina perception 20. This is a *very* beautiful, "proper" Fey forest, just like Tsu said. Very old trees, brightly coloured, vivid creatures all around, but... Something's not quite right. Colours aren't quite as bright as they *should* be - and here or there are patches of something dead; a dead tree, or dried-up undergrowth as if the plants hadn't been watered properly for. It's sad, but perhaps not too surprising given we expect *some* kind of affliction in this new domain.

An unusual sight along the way - a faerie ring of mushrooms, which we recognise, but Clapperclaw warns us that these are corrupted! "I think it has something to do with Granny Nightshade. I think *some* still work, but you'd need to know the secret to activate them. But then you wouldn't know the secret to activate it on the other side and you might get stuck."

We reach a *very* mossy cave! Ferns are growing all over it - quite glorious in fact, and it looks deep. Clapperclaw assumes us it is safe, but asks if we have a lantern. Oswen hangs the lantern she was given by Madrick off her staff and lights it. We head down stone stairs, which open up into a very wide cavern. It's impressive. Water dripping can be heard, and it's cooler and somewhat damp, but the ground where we are at least is dry. Clapperclaw leads us down a side passage; it weaves around before opening up into another cavern.

Here, is an old man. Well dressed, complete with waistcoat, jacket and cravat, he sits besides a spinning wheel with lovely furnishings around - none of it would look out of place in a grand old wooden house. A kettle on the stove steams a little. But the thing which draws the eye is the **mountain of gold and gems (mostly gold)** that is heaped behind him! It's more wealth than Oswen thought might exist in the world! There must be tens of thousands of gold pieces here.

He looks over, pushing glasses up his nose. "Oh Clapperclaw! It's good to see you again". Clapperclaw introduces us. "Friends of yours are always welcome here!" says Nib. "Come in! Have you had?" - we politely accept the offer of tea.

"I'm Nib and this is my atonement!" he says. "Atonement?" "Well, yes I..." - then he stares at Oswen for a moment - "You're - you - the things you're wearing. They look like they're from my world!" Oswen names a few places she knows of. "Yes! Yes, I was a great landlord in a place called Baldur's Gate! One of the great cities." He explains that - well, he wasn't the best person. He had visions that caused some self-reflection and became guilty. He wanted to atone for the sorrow he'd caused. He heard of a great and powerful wizard in the Fey, Granny Nightshade. He sought her out and asked how he could atone - but she cursed him. "But I feel this is a fitting punishment!" - all his accumulated wealth appeared alongside him, and he is cursed to stay here until he has found ways to "help good people to make up for all the bad that I did. I am a good judge of character! I used it in the wrong ways before, but I intend to use it for good now."

He shows us something he can do with his curse. He grabs a handful of gold, which stretches out strangely and turns into thread; he spins it quickly, singing as he goes, and spins the thread into an object - a beautiful-looking cittern of sorts. "This is an instrument of the bards. One of the storied ones, that I'd seen before." This is golden - unsurprisingly! - he walks to Bel. "I can guess that this is just the right thing for you?" - Bel says, "That's very kind of you!" but Oswen chips in, "But what do you need in return, sir?" "I don't need anything from you, except to use these gifts for good. To help offset the bad that I've done. This is why I create them." 

He invites Bel to take the lute. If we spend time with him, to let him know us better, he can "divine the gift that suits you best."

So we spend time telling him our stories, of how we came to be here and what happened in Hither.

After this, he looks to Kindle and his amulet. He asks if he might be allowed to spin gold around the amulet! Kindle agrees; the strange gold thread is rapidly spun around. When finished, it's still the amulet to Yondala, but all the more beautiful.

To Oswen - "Young one. What is it that you need? Do you find yourself under threat? Do you need protection? To be wrapped in something that shelters you? Or perhaps you are a collector of knowledge. Perhaps what you would like is a book! A magical book, that stores knowledge; that will help you in your studies."

Oswen thinks the cloak sounds interesting but she has magic she can use to help protect herself only sometimes it's not powerful enough; the book sounds like it would help. So one is made. It takes a while; an Arcane Grimoire, +1, quite beautiful. It ends up titled "Oswen's Observations".

Inafina - a belt spun of a golden dragon's song, or boots that will let you step on the wind? The boots sound interesting! "Wind Boots", he calls them; she is able to step on air currents, to effectively fly, as if walking on invisible stairs.

We are all very thankful! Clapperclaw is too - but it's time for her to go. She's going to try and find the inn! We wish her the best of luck. It's probably not gone too far away! More hugs, well-wishes; she heads away.

Back to four of us, again.

(End of Part 1.5)
