# Oswen: Part 1.1
## Session zero, 22-Jan-2024
### In Which We Meet A Halfling

Oswen, a 22 year-old wizard halfling, was drawn into the Fey when was 14 years old. She arrived in Toril about a year ago, and doesn't understand the process that got her there, or that got her back. This drives her to study magic. Her appearance and her own sense of age may well differ from that of anyone who knew her as a child, since time in the Fey Wild can pass differently.

Most of her memories are from her time in the Fey domain, but she does remember two parents. She has no idea how to find them. In the Fey, she was raised by Dryads, and found her memories of Toril becoming quite fuzzy very quickly. To her dismay, upon returning to that plane, she realised that while she did have a clear memory of her parents' faces, she can't remember their names.

The Dryads were independent, nature-loving people who tended to trees and animals. They taught her how to live off the land (although the land of the Fey Wild differs from that of Toril rather substantially!). She learned of the Fey Wild rules; people of whom to be wary; to stay out of the way of more powerful Fey who can be very whimsical and impulsive; and so-on, and so-forth. She remembers a great deal of "be wary"! She enjoyed talking to the Fey wild animals; dancing the night away with Satyrs (but knowing not to accept offers of drink!) and used to watch herds of Centaurs from afar but was always too scared to approach, given their huge size.

She finds Toril social interactions difficult. It's nothing like the Fey. Worse yet, the animals don't speak. A difficult year figuring out how to interact, but her insistent excitement about all the new things she was seeing carried her through. That said, she thinks of her Dryad home often and misses it.

More to the point, the new things are *very* new. Too new; she has a sneaking suspicion that she might not have come from this realm originally at all. Her parents may not even be on this world.

A saving grace was her arrival in woods (at a Fey Wild crossing, not that she understood it), where she was happened upon by elven scouts. It took a while for her to communicate with them, her magic letting her understand *them* but they didn't seem to know Halfling or Sylvan. They knew a few scraps of Common, which was enough to end up being led to a path that led her out of the woods. They even gave her gold to get things started - she remains grateful to them to this day, and probably always will.

She eventually arrived at a small inn standing alone on the road. She was taken in by the kindly innkeepers (**easter egg note - the inn at Ashara's Crossing, see Riglan, campaign 6**), who marvelled at what she considers her limited magic. The guests were interesting - they seemed to be some kind of secret society! They helped her with a backpack, some food and water, and sent her South, over a bridge over a river, and into a powerful nation which took her in - the city of Ordulin.

People here look after each other (in essence, social security). She remembers are classic poor/poverty, hard work, farming kind of vibe where if you didn't earn, you didn't eat. This leans into the idea that she might not have come from this world as a result (unaware of the sheer size of Toril).

Dates in Toril are meaningless to her. People keep referring to times of trouble and **some scary war that happened some way North a few years ago**. Apparently she'd come from a forest close to that war, so they were asking her about it.

Being at Ordulin was a revelation. She had access to libraries, books, materials; to study however she wanted! Yet so many of her questions could not be answered - it felt like she wasn't *from* here. There was just a pull. A draw to wander afar. To learn more, to study. Her own life is a mystery that must be solved. This always created a bit of a distance between her and even people she ultimately would call friends - they couldn't understand why she wasn't content. It might have come across as being ungrateful (low charisma!) even though it wasn't.



## Day 1

A cool, overcast day outside. Oswen awakes in her quarters in an apartment building in Ordulin. She has an hour until work; breakfast is served in a shared kitchen. Friends and workmates greet her. Smalltalk. Talk of a change in season perhaps being due. "Oh! That's good, that means I must have seen all four already!" she answers. It'll be a busy day - trading, warehouses, mills - harvest time.

She plans to read before work, as usual. "It might be cool enough to read in the garden today" remarks a coworker. A male human friend of hers, yawning, comes downstairs - this is **Leonidas Hallman**. Most people she's met are human, actually; a few half-elves and a few halflings who Oswen had learned *were* involved in that strange war in the North some years ago. Leonidas' family makes wine, so once he's finished this "gap year" of work experience between studies, he intends to return to the family vineyard. He plans to wander the markets before work. The housekeeper asks him to fetch goat milk!

The garden is nice for reading on a cool day. The market is hot and busy all year round! Oswen goes to read.

It's very beautiful out here; balustrade-type seats around the edges, flowering bushes all over and, in the centre, a huge, grand flowering Wysteria tree. It's spectacular. Could almost rival some of the Fey flowering trees. There's a stone bench she likes to sit on to read.

Between the very sweet smell of the tree and the overcast light making the sky look strange, she is almost nostalgic for a moment! The book is from the library, which talks about fey paths. She's read about 8 of them now and none of them seem to make any sense, not matching up with her own experience, but maybe book #9 will be the one!

Investigation 12+5->17. Good first roll!

She's always had a knack for books. In just 45 minutes, she thinks she's probably flipped through and found enough bits of knowledge to make it interesting... There *is* something here. This is the first one that's not just talking about strange forests, "ley lines", abstract teleportation or plane magic - this one talks about portals, specifically, fixed or sometimes transient, where the "veil" is thin. This is in many ways a less scientific book - it says that they often require belief, or a key - a thought, some words, hand gestures, a pulled face - anything.

She sits back on the bench and recalls how it happened - a very blurry memory now - playing hide and seek with some friends in the fields, going to the bushes near the woods but *everyone* hides there, so going further in, and finding this amazing hiding place. She pushed through the bushes, and a big cloud of pollen burst up, and she sneezed - so many times, she couldn't stop - 6, maybe more! - so surely she'd be found, but she was in luck; nobody came. But then time passed, and more, and *more* and she started to get worried, so she walked back the same way - but it wasn't there. No woods, no bush, no field.

Was it the sneezing? Or the thought of wanting to hide? Magic pollen? Who knows! But this book says that it was *something* like that. She stumbled through.

Anyway - to work! She heads into the library. Today's task is to sort out returned books, cataloging them and putting them back where they belong on the shelves. She falls into the rhythm.

It's lunch time. Leonidas hasn't come back from the market to work - not for the first time! - but when she heads down to the kitchen, she sees him there, kinda sweaty - he's been doing *something*. "What've you been up to?" "I was watching some kickball going on near the market, but then they needed an extra player because someone didn't turn up and I know how to play so I joined in. Thanks for sorting all the books without me... I'll do the later shift and that way, I'll make up for not being here. You can finish up early today - 3pm! I know you like to read your books and wander around a bit." Oswen thanks him - that sounds good. "I appreciate you covering for me." "I always do! I don't mind."

Not long after, work is finished. It's about 3:30pm - distracted by thoughts of an early finish, she spent too long at lunch and arrived late for the shift. She wants to ask someone about the book, a scholar, so - university. Uuuh - somewhere. History only 7+3->10. She can't remember the name of a gentleman who used to come and visit the library from there; he'd be a good place to start; she used to spend time chatting with him. He was particularly interested with her Fey Wild experiences. She asks a fellow librarian if they remember. Same History roll again, unfortunately! "He's old, from the university, he has grey hair..." - it doesn't narrow it down. But she'd recognise a picture if she saw one. The librarian says they usually have pictures of staff up on walls, so she just has to figure out what faculty he's in and check there.

OK! A plan! She heads off, excited, gets to the main gate of the grounds, then ponders faculty. There's a sign here. A directory.

* Natural sciences
* Arts and literature
* Engineering
* Arcana and religion
* Economics
* Law
* Esoteric and occult

From that, she thinks - could be natural sciences, arcana and religion maybe, or esoteric and occult. Hmm, the book she found that was interesting wasn't so science-minded. It was more mystical, almost; so, she heads to Arcana & Religion hoping that might be the correct faculty.

The various courtyards all have beautiful statues and fountains. She'd like to study here, but that would be putting down roots, and she has this nagging wanderlust. She carries on through to reach the faculty of interest and starts looking for pictures. Investigation 11. No... Doesn't look right. Names don't ring a bell. Bad guess! Next guess. *Must* be natural sciences. A much better idea - should've gone there to start with!

On arrival... OK. A smaller faculty. Easier. Investigation 16. Oh dear! No. She even looks at the list twice, since it's smaller. She's looking frustrated and a woman passing by introduces herself - **Ilya** - "you look like you're, I don't know how to put this, lost?! Do you need help?" Oswen tries to explain what she's here for. The woman asks if there were any particular characteristics that might help identify him. Another history  check; 16, ah! He had a strange tattoo. She thought it was chicken's foot, and describes it as that! It's against his temple, visible when he takes off his hat whenever he walks into the library.

Ilya has seen him. "He's quite mysterious! I don't have any classes with him. But I believe I think he's over in Esoteric & Occult."

It's always the last place you look - with due thanks, Oswen darts off to this new location. *This* department is one she's never been close to before. Quite small. She walks into the smaller main building and finds the name quickly. **Madrick Roslof**. What a name. Hard to remember, because it's strange to her and she always thinks of several wrong names that are alliterative or similar. He must surely have an office or a class or something; there are classrooms on this level, and on the floor above, she finds corridors with offices. But which one? There doesn't seem to be a directory for a specific person. Ah! But the doors have names on. Of course... So she walks along until she gets to the door. "Associate Professor Madrick Roslof".

She knocks politely. Perception 18+1. No reply. Knocks again. No reply!

Oh. There are *five* unopened letters shoved under the door. Curious... She tries the door handle. Locked. She looks to the left and right. Neither of those doors have letters. One to the left is ajar. She goes to *that* door and knocks. "Um - oh - sure - that's fine - I mean - come in, I'm leaving in five minutes though so you'd better make it quick - staff hours end at 4:30, you know that" - then he looks up and realises that this isn't a student. It's an older human woman with glasses, wearing a buttoned up waistcoat, frilly collar and had already taken a coat to make a show of putting it on, but now pauses.

Oswen says, "I'm sorry to intrude, I am Oswen, I was looking Professor Roslof, but his door is locked and seems to have several letters as if he hasn't been here a while..." - she's almost interrupted in reply. "Yes! He hasn't been here in a few days. Someone should find out where he is - who's been teaching his classes? Were you going to take his letters to him?" and Oswen replies, "Well, I certainly will if I can *find* him..." "Could you give him this as well? I was hoping he'd be in today so I could give him this - better late than never, I suppose". She hands over a small gift-wrapped box with a bow and a gift card hanging off the tag. Oswen guesses - "Birthday?" "Well it *was* his birthday. Three days ago. It was going to be a really big deal, because he's 90!" "I don't suppose you know where he lives, do you?" "Yes! Out in the **Karolov Pumpkin Farm**. He bought that a couple of decades ago. Everyone thought he was mad! We assumed he was retiring; but he just kept teaching, well, I guess that's what you do when you have tenure... My semester finishes tomorrow, so I won't see him for at least another month... It's nothing valuable though...!" she says as she scrutinises Oswen a bit more. Oswen says it's not a problem, she's obviously not wealthy (and was flattered to be trusted really - hardly a Fey Wild common occurrence).

Full of a feeling of newfound importance, Oswen takes the letters and carefully puts everything in her bag, heads out to the main gate, looks left, looks right, and thinks, "I have no idea where Karolov Pumpkin Farm is."

She starts asking more or less random passers-by. Persuasion 4. People just appear to think she's in the way and bustle past her. Many of them think she's a little girl! Halflings aren't so common here. Those who make the mistake immediately look terribly embarrassed - at least one says, "Try asking at the city information centre" - pointing down the road, which Oswen knows heads to the central square. "Why didn't I think of that?". It's a bit of distance so she jumps on one of the free public transport wagons. They're curious things; she's always been interested in them; they run on metal rails for some reason, which seems to be how they know where to go, because there's no horse, just a driver. She's not sure why if there's a driver, it needs rails. The driver mostly just seems to be there to give people information, help them on and off and start or stop the wagon.

It rumbles along, stopping frequently, but it's much faster than walking.

### 5pm

The square is lively, but there's a shifting feeling now as people finish work and the evening entertainments start to happen. Food stalls are being set up, some music - lively, different, a slight hint of partying with Satyrs!

Oh! But the centre closes at 5pm. She runs! There's just a minute to spare. At least she's not the one here. She runs up to a counter. "I'm sorry it's so late. I was looking for a map that can show me where the Karolov Pumpkin Farm is?" "I don't think there's a *map*, but I'll look it up..." - she pulls out a huge book. She asks Oswen to spell it. She's only heard it, but makes a decent guess at the first letter ("K" not "C"). That does the trick; there's an address. The person helping shows a map and some carriage tracks that get some of the way - "take the **West Gate line**, from just outside, every ten minutes", but there's a fair way to walk after. It's out of town. Might take an hour to get there. "I don't suppose you have a horse or a pony or..." "I'm afraid not. But I'm not in a rush." "Well it's a lovely walk, a beautiful part of the town, towards the West. The land rises... Anyway, so you'll see this stream here, and then these old fields..." - and so-on.

Oswen does some maths and decides it's still not too late, so she thanks the helper and heads out to catch the carriage. It arrives in only a couple of minutes. It is a long way - by 5:30pm, end of the line, at the edge of the city. Last stop! There are a few buildings, a square and gate. She alights. Perception 4+1; she doesn't notice until someone bumps into her, knocking her over - three young men who've run around the corner and bowled into her at pace. "Oh, I'm so sorry!" says one, helping her up, then "Hurry! There it is!" says another. Oswen notices others running too. She's too low down... People are running towards the gate wall, some climbing up. "What is it?!" she asks. They just tell her to come with them. "This is the best way to see it!"

So, she follows, and gets helped up onto the wall. Adv athl - 4,20-1 -> 19. No problem. The person who bumped into her feels so bad that he makes sure his friends budge over to give her a good spot. "What *is* that?!" - eight objects, flying over the sky, huge butterfly wings! Arcana 8+5->13. The wings look kinda Fey. Strange. She looks closer... **Those are carriages** - like, wagons, gypsy caravan - with butterfly wings, but being pulled by things that also have butterfly wings; some by more than one; leaving a trail of glittery dust behind them on the wind. *Unmistakably* Fey. Trailing behind, a long ribbon dragged by one of the carriages which is larger than the others - four wheels and a strange balloon blimp on top too. It still has wings. It is pulled by what look like four foxes, again, butterfly wings. It's quite a theme.

Everyone around is agog. The whole assembly does a sort of spin around, then lands in fields a distance from the city.

Hmm, history 13, the dryads talked about a travelling carnival a few times. It belongs to the Fey Wild but doesn't spend much time there! It's a bit of the Fey Wild that visits the material planes. Once every 8 years it spends a day in the Fey Wild before leaving again.

**If it can get *into* this plane, it can get back. And they know how that works.**

Without a word she jumps down off the wall and *runs* out the gate. She's not alone! Lots of other people follow her lead - for entirely the wrong reasons, all excited at the spectacle - well, there are safety in numbers. After about 5 minutes of running, she's getting tired and slows down; about ten minutes more, there it is. This strange crowd from the city stands a distance out of town, in darkening fields; this might not be safe; but - perception 18+1 - she is able to make out and understand things that many others can't fathom.

* A tree is walking around
* Magic is cast and two trees in the middle of the field stand up and start talking to the edge
* The first tree goes up to some bushes; those bushes stand; and so-on - an area is being cleared

Walking trees and bushes - meh, no big deal. No big deal in the Fey Wild. Very big deal here. **The Fey Wild magic works in this domain.** It's not only usable in the Fey.

We all creep closer. It's now easy to make out various creatures - not so unusual to Oswen; more so to the city crowd. A Fearie, 2.5ft tall, flying. People gasp as it flits up into the air. The faerie draws the ribbon attached to the caravan we saw in the sky, dragging it along the ground. As it touches, it expands and turns into a rippling, shimmering blue colour; picks up some sunset colours; then it turns into a *river*. Well, *that* is certainly new! It snakes all the way around this area. It has (fast) flowing water and everything, but sometimes is flowing *up* slopes and is a continuous circuit. It's big too, some 20ft wide. It amounts to a moat, so now, we can't get close.

We stand precariously at this newly-formed river's edge.

Caravans start to redistribute around but aren't unpacking. Some of the boys change to underwear and jump into the river, intending to swim across; but as they do, some *huge* rabbits come hopping towards the other bank; they stand up on hind legs, wearing clothing, yelling, "No! No, get out of the river! This is a terrible idea! Do not cross the river. Do *not* cross the river. There *will* be an entrance! You *must* only use the entrance!" - and continue yelling really severe warnings at length. This draws even more workers, a dozen or so, all shouting the same thing.

The people in the river hear this and stop, treading water, unsure. One of the rabbits even jumps in to meet them to try and explain again. Oswen tries to help but nat 4+0, nope! They get the hint eventually just from the caravan staff. They come back onto the original bank and start to flick off water to dry themselves before putting on clothes.

All of a sudden, caravans just open. Things spill out that seem to be setting up the carnival all by themselves up; they "unpack", some almost exploding out into huge structures. One even turns into a *forty foot* high big top tent. Suddenly, a beautiful bridge forms up over the river - starts upright as a plank, falls, growing longer as it does, thumping down, then railings and lights and more spring up along the sides. "Open At Dusk" says a sign. It seems that there may be a fair amount of time left for the setup.

Oswen ponders. This seems like it will be here a while... And means there's somewhere to mark progress on the journey back, or even seek shelter if need be. She decides to press on, and try to find the Karolov Pumpkin Farm.

### 6:45pm

It's getting dark. She gets there before it's fully dark, though. A weird place! Big hand-painted sign; "Karolov Estate" has been changed to read "Karolov Pumpkin Farm". Huge pumpkins in great patches. Small lanterns, curiously, are hung up apparently at random amongst the fields. Some of them look unusually large... She walks past a patch where she spots three each of which are more than 3ft across.

There's a big farmhouse which has lights on.

Perception 2+1=>3; she thinks she might see movement in the pumpkins but looks closer and can't see anything. She presses on. Cooking smells, smoke out of the chimney. She knocks on the door... A delay... Thumps of a cane a wooden floor from inside. "What is it?" - the door opens.

A man stands there, looking out above her. "Down here!" "Oh! Hello... Oh! Oswen!" (remembered I think via DM dice roll) "I was just thinking about you. How strange! What are you doing here? Come in!"

It's a beautiful cottage, but it's filled with too many things that feel - nostalgic. Fey things. It has 8 windows, set around this one single huge room - the whole farmhouse, just one room. A fireplace at one end has a bed nearby; opposite end of the big room is a big dining table, lots of shelves; there's a storage area for scrolls and books; three armchairs, each different. 

He fusses about "not expecting people", tidies himself up, puts his walking stick into a rack with three others and chooses a smarter one. Straightens up a bit taller. "You must be hungry? Are you hungry? Do you eat?"

"Well, thank you, yes, I do eat, but I'm quite small so not much..." - he invites her to join him with food. He serves her a bowl of... Marshmallows and flowers.

Oswen thinks for a moment (what? This feels very Fey!) and says, "Well, I wanted to ask you about a book I found, and went to the faculty where you teach, but they said you hadn't been there in a few days and asked me to deliver your mail!" "Goodness! That was not what I was expecting you to say!" "Well, apparently, yes, I have your mail, and I believe it was your birthday? 90th? The lady next door gave you this..." - she hands things over. The present, it turns out, is a framed picture of eight people standing side by side. He's one of them. He points at this; "These were the original eight of us that founded the faculty of Esoteric & Occult Knowledge! And there she is - she was probably the youngest member. She can't have been more than 21 or 22 - the age you are now?" "I think so. So, it's strange, I was coming to ask you about this book, it's related to the Fey again, but it seems more accurate than the others. And I can't help but notice quite a few things that are familiar to me in here as well. And then quite by coincidence this carnival landed..."

"Yes! The Witchlight carnival. I've been waiting for its arrival. It comes once, every eight years."

"Now long does it stay for?"

"As long as it needs to. Usually no more than a few days - 3 days minimum usually, never been longer than 8. It's quite marvellous. I was there 64 years ago."

"Have *you* been to the Fey Wild?" Perception 13 - a glint in his eye and a small smile. "Yes. But I think you knew that - I think you knew why I had such an interest in talking to you in particular. There aren't many others I can talk about the Fey Wild to. The first time I went into the Fey Wild was in that carnival. And that's when I met her... That's when I first met **Zybilna**..." He smiles... "And she is the reason why I became an adventurer. When I retired from adventuring life, I wanted to share everything I'd learned, which is why I persuaded a group of people, some of whom I'd adventured with - those who remained of adventuring days" (a wistful look) "and we gathered another 5 and started the faculty. Zybilna is the source of my magic."

"*You* have magic?!"

With a wave of his hand, all of the walls in his house come alive and bloom with flowers, vines, bees - all manner of things, beautiful, the finest illusions Oswen could imagine. There is a smell too, sweet cinnamon, freshly baked bread, the sound of laughter; all she can do is gawk at it!

He says, "I know you know this magic."

"Well - not quite!" - a vast of flowers appears - "that's all I can do!"

"Yes, but imagine. Reach into that vision. I think you can do better than others... Look; that looks like what people *think* a vase of flowers looks like..." - then he creates a different one, somehow surreal, but yet at the same time more realistic. "And this what people *want* a vase of flowers to look like. Your heart's desire. People want to believe things. If you give them what they want to believe in, they will believe in it."

"So - an illusion is more successful if you can guess what someone *wants* to see? Or might at least expect to see?"

"Yes. Don't be afraid to push things a little further. Good illusions, I believe, are not so much about creating exact copies of real things. Make it better!"

Oswen gets out the book and lays it on the table, then says, "Well, actually, it sounds like this might be a bit redundant now...!"

He flips through. "It's all true, though. Good information. Not the stuff you usually find in books! In fact the Witchlight carnival is one such portal. As are the pockets of ancient and unstable magic in the forests North of here, which you came from. **I think you crossed through the fey wild into the forest through one such portal; but finding it again and knowing the key to get in - that might be harder.** Besides, you don't know where it leads. The Fey Wild is a very large place. The Witchlight carnival connects to a very particular domain of delight... But I..." - he sighs - "...I'm 90. I don't have much longer. I found some great treasures and I recorded some things that I've seen. And I want to leave them for someone. And no-one I have met in the last year has been as kind to me, given me as much time, and actually cared about the things I know as you have, Oswen. That's why I was thinking about you when I saw the carnival arrive. I was going to come into town tomorrow to find you, but you found me first! Can I tell you a secret? I may need your help."

"...OK..."

"Zybilna has always been there for me. She is a big part of who I am; the things I can do; the person I've become. But she hasn't answered me for nearly a year now and I'm very worried. She's never done this before. In 63 years, she's always been there. She's always responded. She might be a day or two late sometimes, but never a year. Her domain is a domain of sheer delight called **Prismeer**. I know that one of the Fey portals that opens up in the Witchlight carnival opens out to Prismeer. There's a link. I've been through it. I just don't know what form the portal takes each time the carnival is setup - it always looks different. It's run by two gentlemen (well, a bit of a stretch of the word) - Mr Witch and Mr Light."

He takes out a single gold coin and gives it to Oswen.

"I'm very worried for Zybilna. She's a *very* powerful Archfey, so I can't imagine what might have happened. I'm worried that something has happened to her. Will you try - get a ticket - attend the carnival, one of these nights it's here, and try to see if you can find out what's happened to Zybilna? Someone there must know."

Oswen says, "But I shouldn't go into the Fey of course - I might not be able to get back for a long time!"

"You may need to go in to find out. There must be a way back; there always is."

"But we talked about this - one of the first books - it says that time I spend there, isn't the same as time here. So..." - and she tries to figure out how to say this nicely, but low CHA - and he finishes her sentence anyway:

"...Yes, if I'm not here when you get back, I have a faithful companion who will give you your reward."

"Oh, no, I just meant you might not get the answer if I can't get back to you in time!"

"If you can help Zybilna then that is all I need. I'm worried. If you can return with proof she's alive and well, all the hard-won earnings of my adventuring career will be yours. I keep them in a secret chest in a secret place."

Oswen stands up. Draws herself up tall. "I'll not refuse that which you offer so generously, since you clearly spent time thinking about to whom it should go. But I want to help for the sake of helping. Friends don't leave friends behind. I can't leave today, like - right now - because everyone would be so worried. But I'll get the ticket and come back tomorrow."

"Well, you'll need as much time as you can. It opens at dusk and closes before dawn; you really only have 8 hours in it. Everyone gets kicked out at the end. If I know Ordulin, there will be queues out of the door! You'll think about it?"

Oswen says, "No, silly, I'll *do* it. I'll be there tomorrow. I'll get there very early, to be near the front of the queue."

He looks *hugely* relieved. A big smile. "I always knew there was something about you! Don't forget the gold piece for the ticket. You must *not* enter without a ticket."

Oswen nods. "Well, we both spent a long time in the Fey Wild, it seems; there are always rules, and they should *never* be broken."

He asks, "Would you like some spiced pumpkin?" "I've never had it." "I've been brewing it all day!" - he walks to an old fashioned cauldron over the fire, with a long cup ladle; he pours two piping-hot, amazing smelling cups of spiced pumpkin drink. "A little extra kick in it!" he says with a wink. "You'll have to give me the recipe..." replies Oswen. It's delicious - rum or brandy in there. He sits in the armchair, relaxing. Before Oswen leaves, he hands her a lantern. "Well I have torches and candles, but I suppose this is better... Is it... Ah, oil?" "Yes. It'll last an hour." "Thank you!" - she's a little confused, because this lantern is halfling size, with a beautiful brass ring and hook, which happens to fit into a groove in the rough red glass set into the quarterstaff top. As if by magic.

She says, "I don't know how long this will take. But I'll be back as soon as I can."

"That means the world to me."

Oswen steps out onto the verandah as the front door is closed softly behind her. She whispers excitedly out loud - "Did you hear that Orvil? Did you hear?! I'm not alone! *Others know the way!*"

She heads out into the night.

### 8pm

Oswen can hear the carnival from quite a distance away. As she gets closer, she's astounded! It looks so different... Falling faerie dust veils of light stream through the sky. Illusory dragons fly overhead, twsting and weaving patterns in the sky; illusory pyrotechnics burst in the skies elsewhere. Lots of singing, lots of laughter. Huge fey dragonfiles are flying with riders on them! She didn't think the ones she'd see in the Fey Wild would ever do *that*. The first, biggest tree that had started to animate walks around, a bright yellow cloud above it with children gathered around - she's not sure what for. A short queue of maybe 15 people are still at the front gates, with more arriving yet.

There's a box office outside on her side of the moat now. "ENTRY 8 SILVERS". People stand outside in costume, wearing fake (!) faerie wings, handing out flyers. Oswen approaches and is handed a flyer immediately. "You look like you could do with a night at the Witchlight Carnival! We're open every night for as long as we're here!" "What time do you open? And can I buy a ticket today for another day?" "Oh, no, you can't buy a ticket ahead of time. We open at dusk, just as the sun is gone and the sky turns purple. We stay open for 8 full hours!"

Oswen thanks them and continues on her way, as she can't leave in the carnival tonight. Now she's passing people on the road, headed presumably to the carnival, many of them quite young. Faerie dragons are taking off now and then, streaming away, apparently spreading the word - because as she reaches the city walls, a flurry of flyers rains down from above!

She presses on, taking the wagon back to the library and reaches the staff quarters at around 9pm.

A few people, including her friend Leonidas, are sat drinking wine. "Oh! We saved you some food!" he says. "Where have you been? Have you eaten?" Oswen confesses she hasn't - and is quite hungry, grateful for the food. One of the housemaids leans in - **Jayleen** - "You smell lovely... Where have you been?! What is that? Cinnamon? Nutmeg?"

Oswen recounts the story, but leaves the carnival to last (lest it eclipse the story of Madrick).

The food is a light barley and chicken stew with bread - just what the doctor ordered!

People listen and ask questions. Eventually Oswen plucks up the courage to confess that the professor gave her a task, which involves the carnival - and she might not be back... Ever. She's bashful, it's not that she's ungrateful but they all know she's not from here and might find clues to her origin on this new quest. She just doesn't know - but won't be back for a while, maybe not ever.

She's told she must tell the Head Archivist, of course.

Jayleen heads away a while; then she comes back accompanied by **Mavrik** - he's a fixer; the maintenance guy. The head housekeeper, seeing him arrive, pulls out a bundle from a bag - a large bottle of wine! She goes to the pantry; gets a large ceramic jar with a cloth and cork top; pops it open and puts things out on a plate. Finally she heads down to the cellar and returns with another round of cheese, to add to the mostly-eaten one on the table. Insight, 17+1 -> 18 - Oswen is a bit embarrassed - it's a weekday night, 9-or-so-PM, everyone's sat down - this things are usually only brought out on birthdays or holidays; Oswen realises it's a celebration of *something*. She exclaims - "Oh my goodness! Did I forget a birthday? I'm sorry if I did!"

Mavrik looks confused. "No! Well - Jayleen told us you might be leaving tomorrow..." - and explains where all the food comes from. It's amazing, and the wine is very special. "So - off to adventures, Oswen?"

"I - " and tears up a bit - "- I don't know what to say..."

("Say you'll miss us!" Jayleen / "There's no way you couldn't miss me" Leonidas)

Mavrik says, "Joking aside, you've been wonderful to have - it's been a year, next month." Jayleen adds, "I hope you think of this place as home in _some_ way... I know you have a lot of other thoughts, of course... I hope you find the answers you seek. But don't forget us! And you will come and visit?"

"I won't be at the library forever!" says Leonidas. "I'm going to be a great vitner one day! I'll make amazing wine, much better than this stuff!"

Oswen clears her throat. "Of course I won't forget you. And it was strange how I did fit in and you were all so welcoming, it did feel - well, 'right', but there was as you say always this undercurrent, a calling, because I think I lost, sort of two lives - whoever I was before I got pulled into Fey world, then the life I had there, when I get pulled to this one. But that doesn't mean this isn't now a *third* of those lives! And I'll certainly never forget it. And - if I possibly can - I promise to return one day."

Now there are more detailed questions about the carnival. Oswen hands over the flyer. She describes it as best she can - doesn't know these people, but the carnival - while its owners might be a bit shady! - has a good reputation and she thinks it's safe. It's not here often, only every 8 years and for it to be on the doorstep is a rare thing.

"I could come with you to the festival" says Leonidas; "It's not like I have anything else to do?" "Why don't you all come?" asks Oswen; but they can't *all* leave! Not mid-week. Oswen encourages the others to get there as soon as they can because it's only here for a few days - nobody's sure how long, and it'd be a bad thing to prioritise work and miss out. Jayleen is sure can make it the next day.

Oswen agrees to meet Leonidas at the ticket booth at dusk. She needs to get there quickly to avoid having to queue as she's a lot to do and only 8 hours to do it in. He agrees but she knows he's unreliable! It's reinforced as he starts talking about an ever-increasing list of friends he might bring. As is she... So she says, "If I'm late, don't wait for me. I'll see you in there!"

After the customary thanks, and hugs and so-on, although there's doubtless more of that before tomorrow evening; with the bottle drained, cookies and cheese eaten; Oswen heads to bed. In truth she's a little disappointed - she'd hoped to quietly ask Leonidas if he wanted to come with her. And in a rather more reliable capacity than, "I might see you there!" - but that's how he is, and she'll just have to see what fate has to offer. She's not sure if he'd be a good travelling companion anyway but at least it's someone she knows!

She tucks up in bed; it takes a while to sleep, as her head is spinning with a hundred ideas and memories.

### Overnight

Perception 8+1 -> 9, oh dear! She sleeps soundly, noticing nothing much. Strange dreams borne of a mixture of excitement, anxiety and fragments of memory.
