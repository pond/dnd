# Oswen: Part 1.2
## Day 2

Oswen wakes up just after sunrise. There's a cool morning breeze coming in from the open windo - wait - open?! It wasn't open last night! In a hurry she checks her belongings, coin purse first. Everything is there. Looks around; perception 12+1->13. A shingle from the roof shifts and clatters outside. Pops her head out of the window, looking up; a shadow on a building opposite, someone scrambling along the roof. She sees a shape fall, then there's a strange melodic sound, a strum, and the shape floats rather than falls - then it runs. It's small, with a cape and hood up.

On an impulse she jumps out of her window - acro 11, inelegant, landing on all fours, then gives chase. Going around a corner she catches a glimpse of the creature, looking behind itself as if to check to see if anyone is following but doesn't notice her; it darts into an alleyway some 100ft ahead. She pushes on, full tilt, but stops abruptly to look around the corner at the alleyway. Perception 16+1->17. The creature turns to the right, next to a tavern. Ah! She knows this bit of the city well and thinks if it does down there, she can take a diagonal cut-through with some diagonal stairs that she can use to make up the distance.

She runs as fast as she can, but ATHL 12-1->11; there are some stairs that take a bit of time to run down. She's not caught up but the gap is half what it was. As she pops out of the cut-through, it's not noticed her, but she might not be able to catch up so she shouts - "Hey, what's your name? I'm Oswen!"

It spins around, yelps, then says in a low voice, "It's gaining on us!" and runs around a corner.

Oswen does her best to keep up, but is *she* "it", or is there something she hasn't seen?! She focuses on the corner; DEX save 11; swings around the corner but smacks into someone much taller with - *not* heavy thud. A squish? She stumbles back, looks up; light brown and tan, tall, lean-looking... Bunny. "Oh my! Oh my goodness, are you alright?" it says. It quickly grabs Oswen's hand to stop her falling backwards.

Oswen says breathlessly "Yes I'm fine it went that way run!" and tries to keep running. The bunny runs fast at first then seems to slow down to a fast walk. "I'm **Inafina**, what's your name?" "Oswen! That creature ahead was in my room I think! And then it ran. I'm trying to catch up. Can you help?"

"YES!"

Inafina asks "You just want it stopped?" "...yes?!" and Inafina dashes forward, very quickly, in some kind of jump and graceful run just rushes away. Goes around a corner. Then hears, "What?!"

Oswen turns the corner just in time to see a portal at the end of the street closing.

Inafina says, "It wouldn't let me through it! I'm sure that was a portal but I couldn't go through. Now it's a wall! Was that a thief? Did it steal something from you?"

Oswen says, "...No. The window was open, but I'd left it shut, and I woke up, heard something on the roof, then saw that thing. I got close, shouted out my name and I *think* it said, in a strange low voice, 'It's gaining on us!' - and I think maybe *I* was the *it*?"

"That's odd! When I turned around the corner and yelled at it, it spoke with a female voice; it said, 'fast as you are, can't catch me, no no no!'"

"Well that's just annoying..."

"I would agree! Are you alright?"

"Oh I'm fine! Thank you. I'm so sorry, I just ran into you and dragged you into this..."

"It's fine. It was my turn today" - and Oswen sees a satchel full of posters. Oswen says, "Yes, I think I saw some people like you last night, at the river, when the carnival started setting up."

"I'm one of the acts there!"

"What do you do?"

"Kind of like a performance - well, gladiator. I'm very good with this!" - and she pulls a stick off her back and performs various acrobatic and athletic twirls and somersaults. Oswen takes a few steps back, alarmed but impressed.

"Pleasure to make your acquaintance!" - extends a hand; Oswen shakes it and says, "I think I'll be at the carnival at opening time tonight - I actually have to find something there..." "Well I'm working, so I'll see you there. My show is in the Big Top during the Extravaganza, but other than that, I think I'm on wing duty - we hand out the faerie wings! Have you been to the carnival before?" "It's my first time. It's fun, I haven't done it in a while; why don't you meet me at the front gate and we can go and look at things in the carnival together." "OK. That's very kind! Thank you. I'll see you there."

Inafina turns to leave, then looks confused; "Do you know the city well? Which is the busiest street for me to put posters on?!" - Oswen gives directions. Inafina heads off.

Oswen starts to head back to the library. Lots of posters become visible along alleys! Hopefully the rest of them will be better placed.

A giant rabbit though. That's new. 6ft tall! Huge. She's never seen those in the Fey Wild; she didn't realise the ones she saw last night were that big either. This one looks bigger though.

And what was with that creature? She's sure she saw Featherfall - spell casting - but with a musical strum; a bard? And definitely a magical portal. Dimension Door! She's read about that. That would explain why nobody else could go through at least. Also means the fugitive would be close by, but nowhere to know where.

She gets back to her window and tries to climb in, but it's three foot up - ATHL 15-1->14 - she manages it, just about. Now she has a proper check of the room - not just for missing things, but for new things too.

Investigation 7+5 -> only 12. Well, she does find *one* thing; a big black feather that seems to be caught on the window sill where there's a big splinter/split in the wood that she's caught her hand on before. She'd been meaning to speak to Mavrik about it but never got around to it. She takes the feather. She wonders if it is magical; arcana 16; doesn't seem to have magical significance, but it's... Different. It would be a crow's feather, but it's far too big and the shaft of the feather is solid, not hollow, so it's heavy.

Nature 2+3->5, no idea what the creature is but this isn't like any animal feather she's ever seen. So perhaps it's some kind of artefact, something made; or perhaps there's a large crow-like flightless bird - I mean - turns out there are giant rabbits that speak, so why not?!

Then she spends a while gathering all her things and packing them up carefully into the backpack.

She hears a voice, from above her! "Are we going somewhere today?"

She looks up - it's Orvil Culbertson, her some-time visiting sprite. "Oh, hello. I guess you weren't watching lat night..." - she looks up at the glowing green, translucent ball of light; it has an impression of eyes as two black dots that sometimes change shape, giving an impression of emotion; and sometimes, a black line of a mouth, happy or frowning, usually not. She explains briefly last night's events and the carnival. "We might be going home!" she finishes up.

"Is that good?"

Oswen is stumped for a minute. "Well of course it - I mean - I think it - I mean - probably - I mean - I don't know."

"Well that sounds good then? I just thought you were happy. And I thought you liked that boy!"

"Oh. I kind of did, but he might be coming? I'm not sure. He's a bit unreliable... And yes I like it here but I need to know what happened."

They talk a while. He asks why she's sweaty! She explains and remembers the feather - does he know what it is? With his help - ADV arcana; 17+5->22! "Oh yeah" says Orvil. "That's a Kenku feather." "What's a Kenku?" - Orvil launches into a long description! A cursed race, some say; look like crows, but humanoid really but sentient, but can't speak, only have mimicry. They can repeat with perfect intonation anything they've heard before and it's been a Thing - part of an ancient curse! - that they can't speak but they're very intelligent and love to communicate. It's the Kenku's dream to be able to speak with its own voice. Why do you have a Kenku feather?" Oswen instead answers - realising that this *is* what she chased - "How would someone grant a Kenku its own voice?" "I don't know. Maybe one of your books in the library? I don't think it would be easy otherwise it would've happened! The same curse that took away their voice took away their flight. Are you thinking of lifting the curse on an entire race, Oswen?!" - she explains where the feather came from; doesn't know if the creature is friend or foe. Perhaps she could help, but doesn't know - maybe not. Then Orvil looks startled and suddenly vanishes, in a puff of light green sparking motes/dust, that sink to the floor and fade away.

Oswen goes to the door quietly, then yanks it open quickly!

There's nobody there. Rats! There goes that theory. She goes back to packing. Once everything's ready, she heads out for breakfast. She's reminded about seeing the Head Archivist - that's where she's going next. She lets people know that she'll be back late afternoon to say goodbye properly, then heads away.

At the Head Archivist's - "You're here early! The library's not even open yet. Are you alright, Oswen?"

"Not entirely..." - and she explains that she has to leave.

He smiles and puts his hand on her shoulder. "Well, I think that it is a grand sounding adventure! I think your reasons are very good. I will personally miss how organised you have made this library! Know that you are always welcome back here. Would you like a letter of recommendation from me before you go?" "Oh! Certainly - thank you!"

Crisp parchment; a beautiful quill pen; the letter is written - "To Whom It May Concern". It is folded; he ties it with a ribbon; the library wax seal stamp seals it. "I have one last request of you before you go, unless you're in a rush; you see, there are these books that we've never been able to figure out how to categorise..."

He leads Oswen to a collection of quite esoteric books that might be fact or fiction! "Can you help me figure out where makes the most sense? I thought with your background in practical magic and experience with the - supernatural, should I say? - you might be able to figure out which of these are true, or likely to be; and which are fantasy."

There's a stack of about 20 books! We get to work.

Investigation 12+5->17. Not too difficult - three groups. Takes about an hour. Definitely true; definitely fiction; three where she just can't tell. Then she remembers the "occult and esoteric" group in the university and suggests a section perhaps be made in a similar vein. While working, they chat and Oswen asks about Kenku; she's told there's a book in the library. Once they're finished, it's about 10am. Afterwards she decides she'd like to flip through the Kenku book:

* Feathered humanoids that wander the world as vagabonds!
* General conventional wisdom - driven by greed, which was part of their fall from grace
* Can perfectly imitate *any* sound they've ever heard, not just voices
* Their talent of mimicry also extends to handwriting - some of the most accomplished forgers in the land
* Wear ill-fitting clothes to hide their feathered bodies, but their arms and legs aren't feathered
* They tread lightly when they walk and have talons
* The move very carefully - the curse is that they used to fly and had beautiful singing voices
* They were *created* to serve a master whose identity is lost to the mists of time
* They coveted beautiful and rare objects of that household
* They could sing but not speak and longed to speak so that they could persuade people to give up their treasures!
* One day they disguised themselves, snuck into the master's library and stole the Secret Of Speech
* Then they disguised themselves as beggars on the street, to beg for pretty things
* The city discovered this - punishment was to strip them of flight *and* lose their singing voices (Oswen thinks that's *very* harsh)

So no wonder they end up being drawn into nefarious activities - the forgery ability alone would make them of great interest to criminals.

Laster, the Archivist asks what she's doing in the afternoon. She hadn't really thought it through! He has her last pay packet; he hands her 45 silver pieces (woah). "And I know how much you love that spell book of yours, so I had this prepared - we were planning to do this on your one year anniversary here, but since we won't get a chance to, we thought we'd do it now!" - he opens a reading room and, inside, is Jayleen who'd disappeared off during breakfast. Seems she'd been doing *this*!

* A pot of beautiful glistening ink, that looks like it has crushed gemstones throughout
* A beautiful quill
* An empty space on a leather desk for a book to be placed

Jayleen has her hands behind her back. "Look" says the Archivist, "We found this and thought you might want to - I'm assuming you know how to do this? - to copy this into your book" and he takes out a scroll and puts it onto a sort of lectern where it falls flat and easy to read.

A scroll of Find Familiar.

Oswen's eyes widen. They're explaining that it'll probably take an hour and there's paper to test out some of the inscriptions with normal ink on paper... Etc. etc. - this is the best thing she's ever seen; she's zoned out. "This is for - wait, what? - this is for me? This is - this is *wonderful*!" "It was Jayleen's idea!" "Well, I've read that all wizards need a familiar, yes!" Oswen gives her a big hug - around the leg, it's all she can reach - then the archivist too.

She's left to copy the spell. She *does* practice carefully first with paper. Practice - Arcana 4+5->9, she's never done this before! She's read about it. It's *hard*! It's better to read the whole spell first, she realises. On the "real deal" (DC10) 6+5->11, just about makes it! Hands are a bit shaky - this is *expensive* ink - but it works. She can tell.

The spell is expensive to cast. She doesn't know when she can afford it but what an amazing thing to have.

### Lunchtime

She heads out of the room. She finds people taking lunch in the garden. Jayleen is full of questions and wants to see the spell, so she shows the spell in her book. "I know it's not perfect, it was my first, but it *will* work." Leonidas is here. "You're a real wizard now!" She looks sheepish; "I guess so." Leonidas pulls out a paper bag with treats he bought in town and shares them with people. Jelly-filled pastries. Wonderful.

He mentions that he thinks he'll have as many as 6 people tonight! He's full of questions, but Oswen can't answer too many of them.

People need to head back to work. They ask when Oswen will be heading off - 5, 5:30pm? She'll definitely say goodbye before she goes.

Oswen heads towards town, on a bit of a mission. 10gp *worth* of charcoal, incense and herbs, says the spell... Investigation 13+5->18...

* She figures she can find herbs
* Incense is difficult, probably pay for that
* Charcoal - maybe a smithy, they have stuff they don't know what to do with!

She starts with charcoal. Finds a smithy. Persuasion nat 20 + 0! She's helped this smithy before, finding specifications in a book in the library to help figure out a problem they had with the forge. The smithy is happy to give Oswen an equivalent of 4gp of charcoal! She's very grateful, even if it's rather heavy and has to hang in a sack over her back, using rope to fashion straps.

Before leaving Oswen asks if the smithy knows of any brass braziers?! "There's one in the Temple of the Traders; otherwise, you could just ask one of the stalls in the market? The ones doing the toasted marshmallows or the grilled lizards?" and Oswen realises that she's seen those braziers - and yeah, the metal probably is brass. "Just don't ask during lunch or dinner!"

Full of thanks, she heads to a temple, thinking of incense. With the name in her head, she thinks that Temple of the Traders might not have silly prices... Investigation 3+5->8. She can't think of many other temples since the name is stuck in her head! Nature 11+3->14; as she heads there, she finds pockets of gardens. Some communal, some belonging to restaurants - and some just apparently in strips along the roadside. They seem to be decorative, but there are herbs here. She takes a closer look, and realises she can forage some. It takes a little while, half an hour or so to pick things from different areas rather than clearing out a whole chunk, but she estimates she has - d6->4 - 4gp worth of herbs. Great stuff! It goes into the backpack.

On to the temple. Early afternoon now, it's a bit busy, but she's seen eventually. She tries to negotiate for only 2 gold of incense. One joss stick is produced! Apparently incense is expensive. "Is this for an offering?" "Of sorts, yes!" "Did you need a place to burn it?" "Well, if you had a brass brazier I could borrow..." "That's quite specific! It might take a few goes to light it though." It's out in a garden. "You're most welcome to use that! Do you have things to light it with?" Oswen considers her spells; "I think I can manage. Here - have this as a donation, you've been very helpful, thank you" - and hands over 8 additional silver. (Seems right - 8 for the ticket, 8 for the church). "Well that's very kind! Thank you very much. I will say a prayer for you! May good fortune come upon your future exchanges and dealings!"

Oswen heads to the brazier outside and carefully, after checking to make sure she's not being too closely watched!, pours out the charcoal first, which almost fills it! She puts the herbs down, and the incense, but with a covering of charcoal to help it burn; then she casts Prestidigitation. It lights.

She gets out her spell book and starts to focus, reading the incantation, as the fire grows. The incense and herbs eventually catch and start making a very sweet-smelling smoke that gathers on the inside of the rotunda in which the brazier is situated, occasional breezes blowing it away, but after a while it starts to coalesce and take form. Oswen realises she can shape it, like an illusion; to coax it into a particular shape. A presence.

At first, she's thinking of an owl... No. Wait. Cliché! A hawk. Yes! That's better. Not so good in the dark perhaps but that's what she thinks would suit her. And so, glowing and green at first, then hawk-coloured - a (fey) hawk appears. "Oswen! Hello. I'm a hawk!" it says. Oswen is startled. "Orvil?! Is that you?" "Yes - but I look different! And I'm... I'm *real*!" Oswen says, "I don't know what happened. I was given this spell - it's called Find Familiar..." "Well I don't mind. I'll be your familiar! What does a familiar do?!"

There's a discussion about what this all means and what can be done. Orvil is surprisingly excited about being hidden in a pocket dimension - he says it was beautiful! Warm, cookies on the table, a fireplace, a couch with a sheepskin, a rug and hot cocoa.

What a strange outcome, but not an unwelcome one - she'd worried that Orvil might be jealous of the familiar.

### In town later

She's the sights in town, buying an oil flask for the lamp, some dodgy-looking and very expensive rations (1gp for two days! So expensive...) that at least should last a very long time, along with a couple of days of fresh food from the market (2sp for the two days). She buys an extra one of her favourite pastries - an empanada full of peas, potatoes and sweet spices - for Inafina.

### 5pm

She returns to the library at last. Lots of people are sat around. There's an introduction for Orvil The Hawk! Jayleen is beaming. "You've found a way to call the familiar already?!"

Leonidas is *not* here, so Oswen hopes she'll manage to catch up with him at the carnival.

The housekeeper hands her a parcel wrapped in red and white chequered picnic cloth. "Thank you!" - it's food, another day's worth, along with a glass bottle full of water. The backpack is quite full now! She's carrying all-in, equipment plus bag, some 32lb - with a bodyweight of only 35lb. "Adventuring is going to be hard work, I think - lots of carrying" - Orvil says he could help but "I'd rather not!" 

It's all goodbyes, hugs and tears... People stand in the courtyard doorway and wave goodbye, as Oswen heads off on her adventure, to wait for the wagon. It arrives just a minute later and she jumps on board. She can see back to the doorway - Jayleen and the housekeeper have waited, and are there, still waving.

She waves back, until out of sight.

Soon, she's back at the Western gate. There is already a crowd here in the square! She weaves between people and legs; perception 13+1 -> 14. In a very human city, non-humans tend to stand out - especially someone who seems to be a bipedal elephant. They wear a bright blue ballerina's outfit! The trunk is raised up and holds, waving the sign, "Witchlight Carnival Caterpillar", so figuring that's probably faster than on foot, Oswen pushes forward to see if there's space.

ACRO only 6, it's too busy! People up at the front are asking all manner of questions about tickets, discounts and so-on. Since it's 20 minutes on the road if she's quick and since it doesn't open for ages anyway, she decides that queue or not, she'd better take her chances on the road. She just can't make it through the excited crowd of tall humans.

There seems to be a small group of people hesitating at the gate. Some touts are offering walking tours, but they don't seem carnival people; risking their ire, Oswen just runs past, shouting in her wake, "What are you all waiting for? It's just up the road, about 20 minutes!", drawing a few kids who take the hint and follow.

A giant, big-eye-lashed caterpillar is coiled up and munching on a stack of lily pad leaves just outside the city gates. It has big seats on top. She waves, shouts "hello" at it and keeps going!

Her fast speed isn't enough to beat the kids so she gets bombarded with questions. She tells what she knows, and says what she doesn't. She warns them about the river, but they're sceptical since "the river is much further away" and they can't comprehend the idea of a "new" river, magically created.

Surprisingly, she doesn't get passed by the caterpillar and soon, is in sight of the carnival area. There's a river, but no bridge, no tool booth - nothing. The caravans are inside and some people mill around. The kids are dismayed, but Oswen explains about how it appears towards dusk.

Shortly after our arrival just as the sun starts to set - perception 13+1->14, a guy with a top hat, somewhat portly, full 1920s gangster suit (!) walks to the river banks, looks across at us and a few others milling around who were already here and yells, "We'll be open soon! Just stay on that side until the bridge is up!" He pulls out a pocket watch and clicks it; a burst of colour and light explodes out of the watch. The lights turn into butterflies which fly around to the caravans and as they reach each one, the caravans do the self-set-up thing that she saw last time, but she's got a clearer view. An entire carousel ride appears out of a cake box! Someone holding a hula hoop puts it on its side, somehow stretches it to a large size and it forms a portal; unicorns emerge, walk over to and become part of the carousel.

A harengon and a tiefling start to paddle a large lily pad each across the river. On "our" bank they fold up the pads which go small enough to fit in their pocket, pull out toadstools which become large enough to sit on, and as the tiefling start playing music to entertain people, the harengon does various acts of acrobatics. Over time, more lily pads get carted over and more things get set up - including what look like wine barrels, but have coals inside and are used to cook treats sold for a copper or two.

### 6:25pm

As this all happens, Oswen periodically searches for Leonidas - investigation 23 - and until now, there's no sign. But then against the odds, the caterpillar arrives and *he's driving it!* with some friends behind. Oswen hopes she's in the right place for where the queue *should* be for the tickets.

A pixie girl, very pretty, flies over with a box of face paints. "We will be opening soon! Would anyone like some face painting?" and a card drops down with illustrations of options. Oswen points at a cat (rabbit people, crow people, elephant people) and shouts to Leonidas - "You should be a cat!" and turns herself briefly via Minor Illusion briefly into a small dog. "OK!" he says and comes over. 1 copper. Oswen pays. The artist works very quickly but it's very convincing.

As she's finishing the crowd gasps - the sun has set. Suddenly all the lights of the carnival start to glow much brighter and this time the bridge builds itself, brick by brick, instead of the wooden "falling plank" that happened last night. The ticket booth appears at the end and lights up. Oswen grabs Leonidas' hand and runs for the booth. Adv ATHL 14. Not the first in line, but close enough! Leonidas is behind, his friends a bit further. "I don't mind waiting" says Oswen, "if you want to go back a bit to join your friends?" "It's alright! Everyone's paying their own! I'm excited to get in."

The booth looks like a cupcake! A purple swirl of "icing" as a roof, topped by an animated ice sculpture of a winged ballerina.

Fireflies come streaming out from the carnival over the bridge to form faerie lights that snake along trees on the path leading to the bridge. There were about 10 in front, then D10->8->2 more people after that. It doesn't take long... Oswen gets to the front of the queue. Off to the side, Oswen had noticed a painted sign of an elf wearing a jester's hat; but it springs to life when someone approaches. "Welcome to the Witchlight Carnival! We hope you're having a delightful evening... Please do buy a ticket over at the booth..." and so-on.

An elderly goblin called **Nikolas** perches at the window of the "cupcake". Inside, it seems to be a starry night, spinning around. The goblin is quite high up and looks down to everyone with a spyglass. Spotting Oswen, she presses a button. The window at the top shuts, there are some clanking noise and a window at Oswen's level opens, revealing the goblin again! "Tickets?" Oswen side-eyes Leonidas. "Two please..." On request, she gives their names. But with Oswen's in full, there seems to be a problem. "I can't sell you a ticket! You already have one..." - she presses a button and her chair spins around and moves over to a drawer. She opens it, pulls out an ornate wooden box **with a clasp that says "N. M."**. She opens it and a slightly different ticket is withdrawn - beautiful, with a silvery-blue foil. Oswen's name is on it! "Someone organised a special ticket for you. A mysterious benefactor!" Oswen's confused; that's not the professor. Who could it be? She's handed her ticket and Leonidas gets his, so only 8sp all-in.

Leonidas trys to insist on paying, but Oswen points out that *she's* the one leaving and she feels like she owes him a lot of his friendship and it's the least she can do. He blushes, which makes her blush, and he says, "Well that's very kind of you - thank you."

The goblin tells us that the ticket on the edge has 8 faeries; whenever a ride is experienced, "they will punch one of those faeries" (!) "and when you finish punching all of your faeries you'll need to pay for any more rides. Cards of faeries come in 3s and 8s. Oswen - yours is special! You have *two* rows of 8. You must be very special. And before you ask! I can't tell you who it was that bought this. Go on now, go inside! Move along!"

We're given a map showing all the rides - and cloth faerie wings, which we're told we must wear to show we've paid. So, we put them on. Oswen says, "This *might* be a bit much... We'd better go in, we'll look less out of place!"

The early arrivals are mostly stood in a cluster, in wonder at the rides. It "feels" like the fey wild here; colours are brighter, it's not fully dark somehow even though it's night over the bridge; even sounds seem brighter. There's a sense of excitement! (Inspiration).

More people are arriving behind; Leonidas' friends catch up and he introduces them.

### 7pm

A stilt walker comes out somehow carrying armfuls of cotton candy and, on his back, a big display - Carnivale style - of more cotton candy. 1cp per bundle. Sure - why not! 3 flavours, she's told; laughter, mirth and giggles. "Mirth!" It's very airy, only mildly sweet. Somehow it tastes of mirth. Weird. Some people laugh briefly after each mouthful - Leonidas included - others get the giggles. Oswen whispers to him after, "You *do* have to be careful with fey food and drink!" "It's very unusual." "I don't think anything would be bad, but it might be unexpected."

Walking across from the big top, walking past a calliope (steam organ) that's just starting to play, towering above it - a 15ft tall Treant. Oswen runs towards it. "Hello! I'm Oswen! I think I saw you at the start of the carnival - you awakened all the bushes?" It bends down and slowly says, "Oh yes, it was me!" - she now sees the gold 'cloud' is various ribbons in the branches, along with some emerald swirls up above. Then he stands up, spreading branches - "It's time for the welcome gifts!" - and oh, actually, *now* she sees the gold clouds that form from thin air, apparently made of sycamore seeds, golden, that rain down as the cloud disperses.

"My name is **Northwind**" he says. Oswen thinks he sounds actually quite young. A teenage treant! "Catch my gifts if you can..." - she shouts back to Leonidas and friends, "Catch the seeds!" - DEX check, 19+2 -> 21! She's doing well. She catches two, but isn't sure what to do with two of them. Nearby, she spots a squirrel - not humanoid, but fully dressed, like a hotel or inn porter - which scampers down. "Well done!" it says. "You've got two of them! Well, that means you get a choice." - he hands her two dandelions. "Make a wish and blow it into the wind!"

It's tough to figure out but Oswen thinks it means that she makes one wish, but can blow both dandelions into the wind. 2d8 -> 5 each time. The wish is simple, "I hope I'm able to discover what is happening to Zybilna so that I can tell Madrick".

The seeds blow away. Each person seems to have a different dandelion stick in their hand - some get cherries, some a lollipop, some coal! Oh dear. Oswen's surprisingly both turn into a gold piece. So she has two gold; but it's unusual, doesn't look like "normal" gold, but they seem to have the right weight to them. They have different pictures on each side; a regal-looking queen and a witch with cauldron and broomstick, complete with pointy hat.

She goes back to Leonidas. He's got a shimmering, four-leaf clover. "Oh, that must mean good luck!" says Oswen. "I do feel lucky!" he answers and pins it to his shirt. "Where shall we go?" "Do you want to go around together, or run around with your friends?" "Why don't we do the first ride together, at least" "OK. Then... If you're feeling lucky" (points at map) "let's try the mystery mine. But let's go the long way around, past the pixies and big top, so we get some idea of everything else on the way".

She looks back and sees a queue stretching all the way down the road! There are already throngs of people here. It was a good thing she decided to come early.

There's a mother playing a game at a stall who's just won a painted wooden crown, two face-painted children squabbling over who gets it. A giant dragonfly swoops overhead, its rider making rather uncertain "woah!" noises. Witchlight hands (the fake wing wearers) dodge but get splashed by a drink the rider carries. Two of them scowl a bit at this, but the third points and says "Oh! You're scowling!" - and the other two suddenly compose themselves and smile, looking around nervously, seeming happy because everyone around is cheerful. Further, as the two girls nearby continue to squabble, the stall person looks distressed and then produces another crown so they can have one each.

Oswen's heart sinks a bit. It *was* too good to be true - she was worried there'd be some undertone, and hoped not, but clearly there is; **there's a fear of some kind, of people not being happy**. She doesn't say anything about it out loud - Leonidas is having a great time.

The calliope has a monkey wearing a huge cloak with moon and stars; sewn on are many buttons of all kinds; it turns a handle which keeps the mechanism going that makes music, or so it seems. People are gathered around listening. A goblin dressed as a ladybug walks up and rattles a tin up; as this happens there seems to be singing; it's the monkey - "Spare a button if you please / I'll sew it next to all these / I offer nothing in its place / Besides a smile upon my face".

Oswen never does up the top button on her shirt, so she pulls that off and drop it into the cup. The goblin beams. "Thank you! I'm **Marigold**. **Earnest** will be so delighted! He loves buttons. A lot of people just don't have buttons to spare these days!" - she rushes over and hands it to him. Earnest's already wide smile gets even wider. "Thank you!" - he puts it on his cloak and a magical needle and thread appear from his pocket and sew it on, almost instantly. He never stops cranking the handle.

Oswen leans in to Marigold as if conspiratorial; whispers; "I'm on a mission! A friend wants me to go Prismeer to look for someone they've lost contact with." "Prismeer? You're in luck! This very carnival is a tribute to Prismeer. They say that the patron of Mr Witch and Mr Light is actually the *ruler* of Prismeer! Do you want to know what *my* mission is?" "OK!" "My mission is to *find Earnest* - Earnest is the organ grinder. That" - she points - "the person in that monkey *is* Earnest, but that's Earnest's monkey; it was a prank you see, the minds were swapped, but it went wrong because the monkey got scared and ran away with Earnest's body!" "Oh dear. Well, if I make it to Prismeer, I'll be sure to keep a look out." "It'll be a frightened, strange-acting middle-aged man!" - she shows a picture of O.G. Earnest and monkey. "You're a darling! You're a dear! May good luck be on your side!" "Thanks!" - and we move on, but none the wiser about how to *get* to Prismeer.

Now we're going past the Big Top. People outside are dressed in all manner of costumes. Illusory dragons carry signs, "Big Top Extravaganza, 11-Midnight". Perception 4+1->5! There's a slight disturbance, hard to see what it is; investigation 6+5->11, something in the crowd; they're a bit distressed but the Witchlight hands are intervening. She says to Leonidas, "Let's see what's going on" and we push through. There's a young girl crying. She had a huge lollypop that was covered in ice cream, but apparently a "mean person" ran over and knocked it out of her hand deliberately. "It went that way!" she says, pointing. "It just said, 'silly little girl' and knocked it out of my hand". There's a mother but she says she was looking at the timetable. The Witchlight hands have produced another lollipop to stop the tears and another offers face painting, but Oswen saying "this way!" and runs in the direction the girl pointed. Leonidas hears and runs after her.

We go around the side of the big top, towards more of the "crew" areas. The tent is 30-35ft fall with three main supporting poles making three 'spires' of sorts. She pops in Orvil and tells him to fly ahead and see if he can spot anyone fleeting. ADV perception, still only 12. Maybe there's someone there, near a group of others, stood at the edge of a tree line? Creepy looking! They don't seem to be running though. A girl, wearing a pig mask! Sullen... School uniform. Oswen approaches and tries opening with "Hi, I'm Oswen - are you lost? I don't think we're supposed to be back here."

Oswen Arcana 21. A shiver runs down her spine... The "girl" seems to have very pale, almost grey skin. Not breathing - undead! She says "undead!" out loud; the "girl" steps back into shadow and disappears, but just before that, whispers - "You won't find him here - he's run that way, to the lake". Oswen saids to Orvil, "You hear her - see if you can spot them!" and as Leonidas looks confused, she says, "Sorry, just bear with me, we're on the hunt for someone who might be scared or bad or both!" "Is this a game?" "Sort of! Won't be long!" and we run together, chasing after Orvil. "But they Mystery Mine is back that way!"

Orvil adv. perception again really bad rolls, 4,8+2 -> only 10. Gets distracted by a huge display in the middle of the lake with an ornate crystal fish bowl.

That's the end of that. Oswen is disappointed but we have no choice but to turn around, as she apologises to Leonidas. Leonidas is keen to just try a ride; "Well there are these swans?" "OK..." (A twinkle in his eye) "...As in you and I go on a gondola swan ride?!" Oswen clears her throat and says, "Yes, I suppose - ..."

There's a jetty extending into the lake. Giant swans pull beautifully carved, ornate wooden gondolas draped in flowers. A white swan awaits, preening feathers. We approach; a pixie is there to punch the tickets. They explain that each ride lasts 45 minutes (yikes!) but it does go all around the carnival on the river and "if you know how" you can speak to the swans and they'll explain a lot about what we're seeing and carnival mystery. We're each given a garland and a boarding ramp gives us access to a waiting gondola. We both overhear the pixie saying, "**Feathereen**? I think this one is a bit of a *romantic* cruise!" and we depart with only the two of us on board (a sign said they could take up to 8 people).

It seems easy enough to speak to the swan - it speaks to us. We introduce ourselves. It saw us run up and asks what we were looking for; Oswen tells the truth about it - animal handling adv., 2,12+1 -> 13 , and learns that the odd but helpful undead child's name was **Sowfoot**, an undead elf. She travels with the carnival. The swan thinks there might be three such unusual creatures with the carnival. The others are **Gleam's Shadow** - gleam has lost her real shadow which seems to wander around on its own. A year and a bit, or more, which corresponds to when Sowfoot arrived. And there's a "nasty frog-like creature"! All three of them steal things. The swan doesn't understand how they get away with it because Mr Witch and Mr Light don't ever allow it. Just the other day, in another world, she saw some kids swim across the river and sneak in without tickets; Sowfoot **stole the ability to smile** from one of the children (!). Gleam's Shadow on the "world of clocks" - a young couple sneaked in over some vines - the man's **sense of fashion** was stolen. Disastrous! Oswen says, "Oh, that sounds very nasty, but since people were sneaking in, perhaps Mr Witch and Mr Light thought it fitting punishment, although it seems a bit extreme to me." "It's unusual - none of the staff were briefed. And that toad creature - snook up to a businessman when we were on Eberron. It stole his sense of time!" "Did the businessman sneak into the carnival?" "Oh I think he *forced* his way in, he certainly didn't buy a ticket and people said he was very rude, insisting he had a *right* to be in here."

The swan doesn't know where these stolen things are taken. They must be taken somewhere, apparently.

"I wonder if that's something to do with Zybilna?" says Oswen. "Well she's the queen of Prismeer. She'd never have anything to do with creatures as foul as these." "That's just the thing - she might have gone missing - she's not been heard of..." "Oh! Speaking of missing! Did you hear what happened to **Candlefoot**?!" "who's Candlefoot?" "He's the ticket puncher at the Hall Of Illusions. He's madly in love with **Palasha**, the singing elven mermaid - a star attraction of the carnival - the most amazing singing voice. A beautiful glass fish bowl" - Leonidas interjects, "Oh yes, we saw that!" - "and when she's not performing at the Extravaganza or during the **Crowing of the Witchlight Monarch**, she sits by the lake and sings. It's a free attraction. But poor Candlefoot, everyone knew he was going to do this, even Palasha I think and was just waiting, but you see, Candlefoot is a bit of a strange one. He's always been a bit sort of - bleached out. He had been stuck in the Shadowfell for a while, drained of all colour and a bit sad, but around Palasha and she sings, he's filled with the Fey light. More colour than I've ever seen! In return, he's so devoted to her and looks after her every need - well he was going to propose to her. He prepared this beautiful song, this rhyme; he stood in front of her and we all waited to see and he barely started when he *lost his voice*. Palasha was so ashamed that she swam away and he's been too embarrassed to see her since. He's very, very washed out! Had to mime everything." "Do you think his voice was stolen?" "It must have been! I'm not sure how that happened though. This was just last night! The visit to this world was meant to be the big thing - get married while we're here, it's only for a few days. I do feel for them both..."

The ride goes on. We're told all about:

* The Feasting Orchard. All the food stalls. Huge trees have popped up and grow all kinds of treats. Jousting and archery too.
* The Dragonfly rides that Oswen saw before. The dragonflies on a strange sweet-smelling swamp. Very popular and busy. Looks like a lot of fun. Leonidas is really excited about that one!
* We go under the entrance bridge. The queue is maybe 60 people long.

Oswen asks as we go about Prismeer. The carnival goes to a different world every few days, and the rotation of different worlds involves so many that it takes about 8 years until the world that's visited is indeed the Fey Wild and Prismeer. The last time they were there was only around a year ago. Everything seemed fine at the time!

Insight 19; Leonidas is trying to be romantic! He puts his hand in between the seats so that it can "accidentally" bump hers.

Oswen says, "I don't know where I'm going, but it's probably far away, and it might be very dangerous, even though it's probably very wonderful." "I know. I know you're leaving." "But - you could come with me? If you wanted?" - he looks conflicted. He's not really thought about it until now. He's not organised anything, is worried about the vineyard... So Oswen laughs and says, "I had to ask. I know it's difficult. So, let's say, we've just got tonight. And then whatever happens, happens. And who knows when I'll be back..." - DEX save, 17! A bump! Feathereen has been eavesdropping and decided to bump the gondola so we fall onto each other.

Leonidas falls onto her. "Oh my! I'm sorry" - his face is bright red. But then leans in to kiss... Oswen reciprocates. Feathereen quietly chucks and Oswen calls out, "Not subtle, Feathereen!" "But effective!"

* We go past a few stalls beyond the entrance, hand-in hand now.
* Past the Mystery Mine - a fake-looking, scary mountain! The entrance appears to be some kind of cave, shaped like a dragon's mouth. Mining carts go in, magically moving, laden with people; a dwarf outside seems to give instructions; we can't really see what happens inside but people pop out again pretty quickly, eyes full of wonder, some looking very scared but others looking inspired.
* Snail Racing is hard to see, but there are big grandstands with loud commentary and cheering. Oswen suspects that Witchlight snails move quickly!
* We go through some mist.

Feathereen is quiet for a moment, then asks, "Do you think that, in a world full of magic, there is still true wonder to be had? Or is everything including our own lives, just an illusion of some greater being?"

Oswen makes the best minor illusion she can, of a flower that grows near her favourite tree at the library and hovers it in front of Feathereen. "This is as real as I can make it appear - but it's still obviously not the real thing. I'm sure better magic would make it more convincing, but the more powerful the magic and magician, the greater the ability to see through it. Someone would have said something."

"What if we're *all* figments of imagination of one extremely powerful being? Would it matter, so long as we feel that something is real?"

Oswen "You've answered your own question. It doesn't matter, if you can't know. And it doesn't change wonder. There is wonder for me in that little illusion - it's something I learned to do, and I get a bit better every day. And there's even more wonder to see the real thing growing. There's still true wonder in the world every day, just have to look closely."

"But how do we know we exist?"

Oswen says, "At the core, we don't know if anything truly exists. But again, it doesn't matter; if we believe it to be real, it's just as important to us. And if we truly believed it were all an illusion, *we* at least feel what we feel, and experience what we experience, so, we'd care about *us*, even if we felt that things around us weren't real."

Then Oswen says, "Zybilna and a person called Professor Madrick Roslof were quite close. He's a bit of a friend of mine too now, and he's in this world. He says he owes his own magic to her. He spent much time in the Fey, like me. And they kept in touch, and she'd always answer, but for just under a year - so, from *after* the carnival's last visit, she stopped answering. And he's become worried. He's asked me to check and see if she's alright, but I don't know to find a gateway to Prismeer."

"I don't know either. I'd ask Mr Witch and Mr Light if I were you! They control everything about the carnival. It has often been rumoured that there is a gateway to Prismeer here in the carnival; I don't know where it is, but I'm sure the two of them would."

We exit the mist, going past the staff area. Feathereen asks if we can look to see a bugbear wearing a leather harness and vest, wave to him! "That's **Burly**." With help from Orvil - adv perception 1,14+1 -> 15. There he is! A bugbear. He seems to be guarding wagons. Oswen uses Prestidigitation to create a shower of sparks hoping to get his attention and waves. Feathereen calls out "Burly!" "Oh, Feathereen! This is a cool world!" "It sure is! Do you want a game of cards later?" "Yes, always! You know me!" Feathereen says that Burly is very intelligent and wasted on the wagons. She has conversations with him like the one she just had with us. "He misses his brother **Hurly** tremendously though... Nobody knows what happened but everyone knows he never really fitted in. It think we lost him in one of those words; just disappeared one night." It was about 3 months ago.

Feathereen confesses that this world might actually have a curse...! Things kept going wrong last night and the Witchlight hands had to work extra hard to keep the mood up.

We get back to the jetty. We thank Feathereen and jump off the swan. Leonidas' friends are there - they'd been looking for him (Oswen whispers, "I won't give away our secret!") and he looks sheepish, so Oswen speaks up and says, "Oh it's my fault really, I really wanted to ride the swans and I know it's a bit slow for exiting people like you and Leonidas but he was very kind and agreed to go with me but it did take some time." "We want to go to the Mystery Mine!" Leonidas looks to Oswen; "Did you want to..." and Oswen says, "Well, that's where we were headed in the first place. Why not."

D20->8 + 1 -> 9 by DM request.

We go past the calliope again, nodding to Marigold on the way by, past the unicorn carousel, in front of the Big Top, then past the stalls and the "bubble pop tea pot", we couldn't see from the river. It's a huge tea pot that rocks back and forth as if on the boil. People seem to *float* out of the spout in big opalescent bubbles. Sometimes two people merge bump into each other and their bubbles merge, becoming larger, with the two people inside.

We reach the Mystery Mine queue. 8 people in front. We hear the explanation; the dwarf we saw before is dressed as an inventor. He has some kind of contraption with levers and dials that looks like a massive eye which has a soft green light on the iris, shining on people, as he asks them to think about the things that frighten them most. The orb captures it and makes it part of the ride! Leonidas' group gets excited, talking about demons, dragons, demonic dragons, undead demonic dragons... And so it goes on. Leonidas joins in. Oswen's thinking about that - difficult to answer. There were scary beasts in the Fey, but she kept away from them with the help of the Dryads. Then she has an idea - Orvil won't be much use inside a ride so she asks him to just fly around, scout the place out, look for anyone unusual. Maybe we'll get lucky.

Very soon it's her turn and all she can think of in the moment is - finding something terrible out about Zybilna, but by the time she tries to tell Madrick, she returns to find he's passed away.

We all get into the same mine cart. Only one is allowed through at a time. We are cranked up a steep slope towards the dragon mouth; arcana 16; ah, it's a pocket dimension - Orvil is suddenly cut off, not just telepathy but even the sense of him. There's a familiar feeling of a shift. And it makes sense because suddenly, there's a *huge* vista ahead - a rollercoaster weaving and wending through a landscape of volcanoes, mountains, swamps, a fey world ahead with multicolour trees. The mine cart moves faster than anything real could. Hoards of undead spill out of the swamp; WIS save, 19, Oswen isn't scared. Leonidas neither (nat 20) and one or two friends, but others fully freak out.

We climb a mountain; volcanoes erupt, fire elementals and magma giants reach out... ADV WIS, 1,6+3 -> only 9. For some reason, Oswen is caught out by this. Perhaps because these things are so big - she's never been this close to giants before, real or otherwise. Leonidas tries to calm the group by putting his hand through some magma! He's fine.

A shadow falls over us in the next section; a loud roar; crackle of lightning across the sky - a huge blue dragon. WIS save 14, that's a success; after Leonidas showed the magma wasn't real she manages to not flinch as lighting arcs through her. It's very impressive all the same.

In the fey world, there is a crumbling castle - all skeletons - a queen sat on a throne, just a desiccated husk; the others don't seem to scared, but Oswen knows what this is. After the castle is a ruined cottage; rotted pumkins in front; inside the house, empty, long abandoned, out the back yard and there's a tomb stone. People realise this is Oswen. ADV WIS 3,7+3 -> 10, *just* enough but it still gives her a fear of failure. It's close to home. She confesses that this *was* her fear, but doesn't explain it.

The cart swings by a shadowy place. Shadows reach out! A boy calls out "It's shadow demons"... One more WIS save, nat 20 (seems a waste!) + 3 -> 23. But there is a *real* fear, from a *real* shadow demon reaching up towards the cart. Something's wrong. This is perhaps Gleam's Shadow? She stands up on the side of the cart and tries Thunderwave to push it away (CON 13 save - it rolls as 12 and fails). The damage roll is higher than she intended! 2d8 -> 13 (5,8). The shadow is dispersed to nothing, and it looks like some of the mechanisms are damaged inside the ride too - oops! - oh dear. The ride pops out as Oswen hears Orvil freaking out, "I saw it I saw it I saw it!" and the dwarf runs around. "Are you alright?!" - the side of the mountain has been cracked and some parts have popped off.

Orvil is calling for Oswen, so Oswen shouts to the dwarf, "Tell people it was my fault! I got scared and cast a bad spell, it was very stupid, I'm so sorry, I'll be back to pay for the damages but I have to run right now but I will be back, Leonidas I'll catch up with you!" - and as she runs she's saying to passers by, "Amazing ride, totally fooled me, I cast a bad spell, sorry the disruption..." and all that kind of thing - following Orvil's path. It goes to the Pixie Forest.

D20 luck, only 4+1 (just rolled a nat 20, so there we go).

A beautiful stand of oak trees moved into a single space during setup; a flea circus style pixie carnival; Orvil flapping around it; "it ran into those trees!" - Oswen slows to investigate (16+5->21). Snagged on a low branch, a torn piece of cloak; some small black feathers attached. "It's that kenku!" shes 'thinks' to Orvil. "Did you see where it went?" "Into the trees!" so she runs in. A pixie stops her - one punch to go in! - OK, sure, thanks, yes, very hurried! "Is this your hawk?" "Yes but this only works for one person..." - and hands Orvil a mushroom-shaped vial. "This makes you an inch tall. But don't know about the hawk..." so Orvil will just have to keep watch around the trees.

Oswen drinks the vial and shrinks. Quite the change in perspective!

The circus ahead is massive. All the rides are free since the ticket was clipped on entry. Numerous inch-tall tiny sprites seem to run it. The Kenku could be anywhere, so she asks people - a crow like figure, acquaintance of mine... "He? She? Headed that way" "They!" "They headed towards the extreme hide & seek!" - of course. Hide and seek it is!

Investigation nat 19+5->24 and stealth a lucky 16+2->18; that's more like it. For the next 5 minutes she searches pretty much the whole maze-like area. Nobody finds *her* and on exit discovers that she's been declared the "winner" of extreme hand and seek. But she *does* find the Kenku. It's super surprised. She says, "Please don't run, I don't mean you any harm, I just wanted to see if I could help you directly, so you don't have to sneak around. I'm Oswen, what's your name?" Persuasion 19+0; it seems her luck has changed for now.

The Kenku answers in a steady male voice first. "I'm **Kettlesteam** because" - makes a whistling noise. It sighs, or copies a sigh? The next sentence is NOT a patchwork of imitation. It's a steady voice. "I know that you are trying to find a way to Prismeer. I have been listening in. I snuck over to the library. I followed you. I overheard. I thought you had something that would help you - I am sorry for breaking in - I searched your things but was disappointed to find you didn't have anything." Oswen says, "I'm sorry we got off to a bad start. But why would you take something that might help me? Should I not go to Prismeer?" "Well, why are you trying to get to Prismeer? Is it to help Madrick?" "Yes, he's worried about Zybilna". "Well Zybilna is my patron too and I don't trust Madrick so I was going to try and find out what happened to Zybilna so that he didn't have her favour." There are a few mistakes as he speaks. "Sorry, this is not my voice, I'm not used to it." Oswen nods and says, "I don't quite understand because I thought Kenku sadly lost their voices, but you seem to speak steadily, with just one voice, rather than having to put together as series of impersonations?" "This is why I am finding it difficult to use, but I borrowed someone's voice. Too hard to explain otherwise. I'm trying to... I made a fey pact with Zybilna several years ago. She rules over Prismeer but something's definitely wrong but I can't get in contact with her anymore. Now I know that Mr Light and Mr Witch know Zybilna, because she's the patron of the carnival. But they've been giving me the cold shoulder ever since I tried to question about it after they arrived yesterday. They've barred me for talking to them again even though I've paid for two tickets now! All I can do is try and get their attention by causing trouble until they will see me."

Oswen thinks for a moment and then says, "Well, I know what you can do now. When you take a voice, can you give it back?" "Yes" "So you could take *my* voice if you needed to speak to me, then give it back?" "It's more difficult than that - I can only do that once a day." A small corn husk doll with a thorny stem tied around its neck is produced. "I borrowed this guy's voice..." "Yes I heard about that and I wondered if you trusted me enough that we could work together. I trusted the professor just because I didn't know him and he seemed nice and I had no other reasons. But now, maybe there's doubt. So why don't we work together?" "Well... OK... Alright... If you promise to find out what's happened to Zybilna when you enter Prismeer - I can't enter it, that's part of my pact! - then I'll give you this doll and if you take the thorn out, his voice will return. It must be near him when you do it."

Oswen says, "I solemnly promise. I will do what I can. And I'll find *you* first, if I'm able to get back here; where might you be? I don't know how long this might take."

Kettlesteam creates a small bubble - a tiny trinket forms, a chain with a ring hanging off it with a bright costume gem that the ring fits around. "If you hang this outside your window in the sun, I will find it".

Oswen takes it. "Deal. I guess it's shiny enough to see from a distance!"

Kettlesteam says, "If you have any more trouble, come and find me. But we need to find a way to get Mr Light and Mr Witch's attention."

He tried to cause so much trouble that they had to intervene. Oswen's way ahead. "The swan mentioned a Witchlight Monarch...?" "Yes! The Witchlight Monarch gets a private audience with Mr Witch and Mr Light. The title is given in the very last hour of the carnival to the person who has done the most to brighten the mood." Oswen says, "Well, with this doll, and with you kept secret, you give me a way to get closer to that - this voice belonged to a staff member" "Candlefoot, yes!" "yes, but thing is, you didn't know, he was going to ask another staff member for marriage. And the crew all knew, so it went really wrong when he lost his voice. Now it can go right, and everyone will be overjoyed, which must surely help? I hope you don't mind, but I'll have to take the credit? To get this Monarch thing?" Kettlesteam is a bit suspicious at first but then agrees.

Oswen asks if there are any other things that they know of which tend to boost morale, that she could just sort of "arrange" to be nearby, or to cause... "Yes! Yes, well, participating in the Festival Activities and doing well; sharing the winnings, especially, helps cheer things up. Oh! And there's a chance during the Big Top Extravaganza, during the end of the shows, yesterday they invited audience members who might want to perform. A group went up and it went well and was going to improve everything, so I had to run around and pretend to be hecklers..." Oswen cries out, "Kettlesteam! You know that's very bad. I know you were trying to do the right thing... You need to find ways to get what you need without hurting people!" "But why! People do very hurtful things to me." Oswen says, "I'm sorry to hear that. That's wrong. I won't hurt you. We're friends now, and I'm relieved, because I'd rather a friend than enemy any day! Enemies are stressful. So, we've got a plan!"

We leave the maze, Kenku skulking off in hiding. Oswen, finding she's won the hide & seek, wins a big box of amazing cinnamon cookies. She declares that she can't possibly eat them all - she'll take a few for her friends, one for herself and the rest is for all to share. One of the sprites says it's very kind, but she must eat all the cookies while small - they don't get bigger. OK, she hands out the others too and just has one herself. It's delicious, but she figures it'll be very small in her stomach one she grows again.

Oswen hangs out in the circus, trying to join in with minor illusions and so-on, in the spirit of things.

### 9pm

She leaves and grows back to full size. Orvil is filled in! Does he know where Leonidas is? Nope! Well, better swing back to the Mystery Mine to see if that's repaired.

Luck: D20 -> 14+2 -> 16

The dwarf is on the side of the ride, checking things. The ride is running but he's fixing it up on the fly. He sees her approach. "I'm so sorry about before, is there anything I can do to help?" "Oh it wasn't your fault! It was *sabotage* - the Reality Tuning Crystal was taken out. I'm **Zephixo**, by the way." "I'm Oswen!" "Oh! You could help at the ticket stand? My helper there is lovely but maybe not all that friendly." "I wonder if someone just thought it was pretty and wanted it? I've heard there might be some thefts sometimes - not that Mr Witch or Mr Light would ever approve!" "Hmm, well, apparently there's a troublemaker. I hope someone finds him or her soon!" Oswen says, "It feels like a lucky night. I think things will improve. I'll certainly help on the ticket booth until you're done" so Oswen heads over to help out the Temp!

It's a tall, lean Harengon. "Ticket please!" Very dry delivery. Oswen calls up, "Zephixo sent me! I was on the ride, and offered to help out because I feel responsible." "Oh! Oswen!" - it's Inafina. "Oh hi! I found you." "Ah yes! I'm helping with the ticket thing!" so Oswen says, "Why don't you ask for the tickets and clip them, while I give people instructions about the things to think about?" "Sure. Sounds great!"

Eventually the repairs are finished and Zephixo takes over. Inafina asks how things are going. "I'm glad you made it!" "It's been an interesting evening. Someone got injured?" "Injured?!" "Come with me to the first aid tent." So we head there. The story is told; a saddle on a dragonfly was loosened and someone fell. They were badly hurt but **Kindle** (**Kindle Bostromi**) was there and he's a healer that we picked up on a previous world. "So the person is OK?" "Yes. He's quite drunk! But he's recovering. I must warn you - don't stare at Kindle. He's very sensitive about stuff like that. He's perfectly normal where he's from..." "OK..."

The tent is near Lost Property. Inafina calls out, as we go past Lost Properly, "Good evening **Dirlagaun**, how's it going?" and there are series of growls in response. Two children come running around a corner squealing in delight; Oswen sees a strange phasing kind of effect in magic; a displacer beast appears! It wears big butterfly wings and a silly hat; then another appears, to the excitement of the children. It puts a paw out and says, "Caught you!" and Dirlagaun tells us that there are two lost children. Oswen asks Orvil to do a quick fly around to see if any distressed parents seem to be around.

Inafina mentions that Dirlagaun lost her cub a few months ago. Oswen asks if this is normal? Apparently there's a history of finding a portal to Prismeer, but they used to return - and now they don't.

We go into the first aid tent. There's a quite drunk older man, reclining in a bed, speaking in very slurred tones. His leg is up on a pillow and is dressed and bandaged. Standing next to him is a huge 6ft 8 bugbear. It's all fangs and claws as usual, but wears a shoulder guard with an emblem and an amulet with a hearth as a symbol and Oswen recognises the sign - a halfling god; **Yondalla** family, hearth and taking care of people. So Oswen says, "Ah! You worship Yondalla?" The bugbear turns. "Hi Inafina. Oh, hi - um - yes, I do, I did a hermitage with a halfling temple to Yondalla. They took me in and tought me the ways. Who are you?" "Oh I'm sorry! I'm Oswen, a friend of Inafina's." "My name is Kindle." "Nice to meet you Kindle."

Kindle goes back to trying to placate and make the guy happy. Oswen heads over and says, "And please, take this - once you're recovered, why not come back and ride the dragonflies now that the teething troubles are solved - you can get ticket!" and hands him one of the two gold pieces she'd got from the Treant. Inafina's eyes go wide. "Oh! Where did you get a Prismeer coin?" "Northwind! At the start of the evening." Inafina explains that the coin is very special.

A decision is made for the three of us (Kindle, Inafina and Oswen) to head out and wander around. Oswen's a bit distracted by wanting to find Leonidas, but also wants to find a way to give Candlefoot his voice back. Does she trust these people? Nat 20+1! She feels a strange and immediate bond to both of them. She can tell that Kindle is just by nature good and kind-hearted. And Inafina helped out from the very start, in that strange whirlwind meeting of theirs. Very nice people at Ordulin, but she's not met anyone quite so staunch as this.

So Oswen suddenly stops. And says, "I have a confession." And she launches into the tale, a shorter version, but starting with the bird in her room and eventually ending with her showing the doll. The conversation gets quite deep into timings, Prismeer goings-on, people heading in but not returning, the carnival getting there just before the trouble started. The notion of giving Candlefoot his voice back is raised and they both think it's a good idea. So, our next stop should be House Of Illusions.

Outside, there's a big cabinet - like the fake fortune-teller arcade cabinets - but this one has a young, pretty faced witch wearing a witch's hat. "Tasha: Creator of the Hideous Laughter" - Oswen's excited, "I know that one! But I don't know how to cast it..." A pair of halflings are stood nearby, walking hand in hand. The male appears to suddenly be taken by the beauty of something, which he points to; her attention is drawn to it; he uses the moment to pull out a ring, she turns and sees it... Oswen _thinks_ it should be an illusion - but insight 8 - she's surprised as the woman bursts out laughing. He's mortified; closes the ring and runs into the house of illusions crying. That's horrible! A moment later, the lady gets up and is horrified. Hideous Laughter! She had a spell cast on her. These people are real. Oswen runs in after the man, to tell him that it wasn't her fault - he should try again.

WIS save 10, HIS check 18 (definitely Hideous Laughter, Tasha, AKA **Igglwiv** - the name Oswen learned for her first, from books; a very powerful witch. Oswen read books that said Igglwiv is the adopted daughter of the most powerful of all hags, **Baba Yaga** - *that's* who is on the back of the coins. But on the way to the door, Oswen herself falls prey to the spell. A few seconds later she tries to gather her senses; nope, WIS 5; the girl helps Oswen up - "Poor Rubin! He must think I'm horrid! I think he thinks I was laughing at his proposal!" and Oswen, finally getting breath back says, "Yes, I was running in to find him and let him know!" - and runs in. A colourless mime is waving his hands warning her not to go in and she calls back, "I'm just going after Rubin, then I'll be back to get my ticket clipped!"

INT save, 15. A hall of *so* many mirrors, but she's able to figure out what is a reflection and what is real. The corridors are perceptible. She listens; she thinks she knows where Rubin is and runs there. Investigation 13. Takes a minute. But then she sees Rubin. He's standing in front of a mirror. He looks worried. In the mirror, instead of a reflection, it's a young reflection of him. Standing next to it, whispering to the reflection on the other side of the glass, is a scary-looking young girl dressed in school uniform with a pig's mask. Oswen runs up and says, "Don't list. It's an illusion. The woman you were with - she didn't laugh at you - we both got hit by the same spell... Tasha, the laughter; she's mortified; she thinks she scared you off!"

ADV persuasion 17. He was about to step *in* to the mirror! Sowpig inside stamps her feet, annoyed, then steps backwards into shadow. As he comes out of his trance Oswen says, "The one with the mask is a carnival trickster - don't listen to her." "What one with the mask?" "Oh, I thought I saw someone in the mirror - I must have been mistaken!" "I don't remember anything since I came in here!" "Oh goodness! I'll help you out" and takes him by the hand to lead him out. Outside, people look all worried. "Nothing to be worried about Mr Candlefoot - just a misunderstanding." The girl runs forward and is about to run into the spell again! Oswen warns her of the area and we walk around. The two are able to sort it out. Oswen whispers to Rubin - "You know, the swan gondolas are very romantic..." - so he nervously suggests they go on the ride. Such a shame, as he'd done such a good job with so much good planning! He looks like needs some support, so we head off with them to drop them off there. As she is distracted getting onto the boat, he produces the ring. She puts her hand out, "Yes, I do!" - claps, cheers, and so-on. The mood improves.

We're headed back to the illusions when Orvil checks in - "Found him! He's queueing for the Mystery Mine again!"

First thing's voice. A man's lost voice is very important. Candlefoot is sat on a stool looking dejected, since not many people are going into the hall. He has his hole punch ready. Oswen says, "Mr Candlefoot - I'm Oswen and I would like to go in, but first, I made a discovery..." - he starts miming but then Oswen says, "...that's the thing, you see, just bear with me..." and she turns her back, fishes out the doll, removes the thorns around the neck and hides the doll away again. She turns back and says, "You can introduce yourself properly now." He tries to mime his name! She says, "No. I found something, quite by chance - a lucky find. It seems your voice was taken, I'm told? I think I found it. Can you speak?"

He starts to say "I don't have a vo - " and then is astonished! It's strange hearing what she associates as Kettlesteam's voice from this man. He's very excited. Then he realises he doesn't remember his poem! Then decides he'll propose at the end of the Extravaganza *while she's on stage*. Kindle thinks this is very romantic. Inafina isn't sure. Oswen suggests that it might take the limelight from the performers at the end of the show, so instead he decides to do it back stage. Inafina convinces him to keep it simple. Oswen asks permission if she can come to see the proposal too? Kindle and Inafina think they can get her backstage and Candlefoot is happy for her to come.

Oswen talks about her "friend" (goes bright red, they have high wisdom, they know what it's about!) "and I might be going, so this is our last night..." and we head over. They don't want to ride. He's already inside, so Oswen waits near the exit. It's only a few seconds. Three of the guys think it's even better second time around; Leonidas looks OK. He sees us and looks excited - "Oswen! Where have you been?" "I wanted you to meet some friends I made." "Oh - um - hi, I'm Leonidas..." - the other two introduce themselves. Leonidas' friends are surprised and Oswen goes to them, as Leonidas shakes Kindle's hand, "Look at how brave Leonidas is!"

The others want *another* go so Oswen says, "Well, the house of illusions is weird, but well worth a go I think - very confusing - could be fun. And we should ride dragonflies, and we could do the archery..." etc - and in fact Snail Races gets Kindle's interest, so we go there first. And so it goes - the four of us, moments with just Oswen and Leonidas, very close...

...and then it's suddenly Extravaganza O'Clock.

Fireworks go off, huge, booming and sparkling. Haengons run around with big cones to magnify their voices, "3 minutes! 3 minutes! No standing room!" so Oswen wants to rush off. Kindle and Inafina are happy to come along. She realises she's at seven tickets clipped; feasting orchard yet to come; but Leonidas has been doing the mine a lot and with all the stuff after is already at eight. Since we're with "staff", we're allowed to clip Oswen's ticket twice. Inafina heads off for her performance and Kindle shows us the best seats in the house!

(People behind aren't too keen on the huge bugbear blocking the view! But they shuffle around to make room).

The lights dim. It goes dark. Then a huge fireball! It changes into a burning ring, then unicyclists leap through the ring via a ramp, various staff members in masks, fake wings on, acrobatics and circling around. "WELCOME TO THE BIG TOP EXTRAVAGANZA!" - the voice isn't coming from them, it comes from a stand behind - a huge, floating lilypad rises up. Standing on it is the portly gentleman who was dressed like a mobster with a top hat from earlier. Pocket watch, cane... "Welcome to the Witchlight Carnival. Feyrun, how are you? How are we tonight?" - at least a fair few ofthe crowd know what 'Feyrun' is, Ordulin education standards being as high as they are! And so-on.

Inafina does crazy trapeze acts from the top of the big top, both solo and with others, tens of feet above the ground - tightrope, trapeze and more.

Act after act - magic tricks (including sawing people in half), songs and dances; then it goes dark. Squeaking noises. A huge bejewelled fish tank has been wheeled in. Inside, a beautiful elven mermaid.Candlefoot has good taste! She starts to sing - haunting! WIS save, only 8. A crazy rollercoaster of emotions, Palasha's song controlling emotions magically, essentially. The entire audience is enraptured. Oswen is squeezing Leonidas' hand so hard it hurts. After a while, she realises she's been watching him and not Palasha. He's teary-eyed and looks over too. They draw in close, hugging side to side. The song moves through live, love, growing old, losing a loved one, being ready to move on, the quietness of death.

There's a moment after the song finishes when for a few seconds nobody moves - then there's deafning cheering and applause. Oswen and Leonidas are on their feet clapping.

A tall flamboyant elf in a bodysuit and extremely big headdress with feathers and fruit and birds, painted face with big rosy cheeks and red lips, white skin, bejewelled eyes, a flamboyant gleaming gold wand, covered in butterfly wings that spread out like a bouquet of roses. Arcana 15. A *very* powerful magic item. It seems to react to the audience; it changes colour and gets brighter with good mood.

This elf looks to the "mobster" and nods. Oswen is now sure - one is Mr Witch, one is Mr Light. She's not sure which. The two bow. The elf says, "As Mr Witch has said, I hope you have a fantastic time tonight. We're only half way through! You still have the chance - *everyone* here - to be crowned the **Witchlight Monarch** which we will announce at the 8th hour. Now head out there and enjoy yourselves!"

People start to leave. Kindle leads us backstage. Infina is almost finished changing into her normal clothes. She beckons us over. Inafina tries to convince the guards to let us go backstage - "The rule is that what's good for people is good for the carnival and they're good for the carnival so...?!" - Oswen has learned that Inafina is a stickler for the rules, so is impressed that she's trying to bend them but also have them somehow make sense. It confuses the guards enough to relent.

Backstage, Palasha is leaning out of the top of her bowl chatting. Then a hush falls. Candlefoot has somehow felt a really smart tuxedo. He's monochrome body matches his clothes. It's a stunning effect and clever way to use what might have been viewed as a Shadowfell affliction. Palasha looks worried at first - but then Candlefoot clears his throat and recites his poem - the theme is all the ways that she makes him better. There's a rhyme, flow and rhythm.

He's slowly approaching the bowl as he talks. He starts to lose his monochrome and, surprisingly, his tuxedo changes colour too - becoming a beautiful blue. He gets close, drops to one knee and produces the ring. "I would be the luckiest man if you could give your life to share it with me, and we could make a new life together. I would give you my all!"

Palasha *sings* her acceptance; Candlefoot glows in technicolour brilliance! If anything, Feathereen was understating things.

Everyone cheers. Faeries flying around with magnums of shares pour all over the place, liberal with aim! Both Oswen and Leonidas get glasses shoved into their hands. Oswen turns to Leonidas. "To us. However brief. We don't know what our future holds, but we'll be lucky if it holds anything like that." Leonidas bends in a for a kiss. Why not! We drink. He has this strange thing he insists upon where they interlock the arms used for drinking - difficult with the height difference.

"I'm hungry!" declares Leonidas. "Me too!" - The four of us, reunited, head over to the Feasting Orchard.

The air is heavy with the smell of flowers, pies, all manner of other food. Stilt walkers pluck treats from trees. Musicians play, pipe, drum, strum; people sing and dance. Bullywogs (large frogs walking on hind legs) carry big tubs of custard with ladles! They offer to put custard on treats.

"Fairy cake eating contest starts in a minute! One punch to enter."

Oswen draws herself up to her full height and says, "Sometimes, racism can be a good thing. Stand back everyone, this is halfling business!"

She enters. There are 8 seats. Eat as many cupcakes as possible in 60 seconds to win! A cart laden high with all different cupcakes is pulled up.

"Ready? Set? GO!"

A huge hourglass full of coloured sand is spun.

Oswen can safely eat 4 cupcakes. Thereafter CON saves - halfling advantage! First is 18. Fine. 5 cupcakes. She wants another! ADV next, dirty 20! She eats *two* at once. 7 cupcakes! Trying again. Just scrapes DC 10 on the 8th. 9th! Gets *TEN*. People are astonished. Oswen is even surprising herself. Nearby a contestant barfs a bit - but strangely, they heave up custard. Oswen in the back of her mind does *not* think that makes it better! An eleventh! Twelve. Thirteen. Two at once again! Fifteen. TWO MORE! Seventeen. The crowd goes wild! 18... 19... "She's going for the record!". 3 seconds each, and she's had a few two-in-one. *20* is met. Still time! The 21st is too much - 1,2 on con save - D8 -> 6, takes *three custard damage*. And then on number 22 - she makes it (dirty 19). No problem.

The crowd goes *wild* - A NEW RECORD! She's hoisted up... CON save 9, DC 10 - Kindle sees the danger and shouts out a warning; he casts Healing Word. This brings her up to full, D8 -> 2, 6 damage, 1 left, so she *JUST* holds it all in!

**The cost? She thinks she'll never be able to face another cupcake.**

She's presented a beautiful box containing a... Cupcake. But it's magical. "This has been made with pixie dust as icing. If you eat it, you become invisible." She runs up to Kindle. "You stopped me being sick, and you wanted to see town but you're worried about how they'll react. Here!" - and she hands him the cupcake. He's very touched but Oswen does say, "To be honest, I'm not sure I could bring myself to eat it..." We'll need to find a solid box for it so it doesn't get squashed in his box.

"Let's check the stalls - they might have boxes."

Perception 10 (after all those high rolls for the contest, it's not too surprising). Leonidas is a combination of impressed and disturbed! We're chilling out. They're eating; Oswen doesn't need to!

We move over to a nearby stage and sit on the grass to watch the performance. A gnome strums and sings. History 9, something familiar but she can't put her finger on it. A pale, snow-white frog is sat in front of her croaking along to the singing. She finishes, stands and bows to applause; then heads over to a pear tree; looks around; then in a quick leap, floats up and ends up perched on a branch, reclining.

Oswen asks Kindle and Inafina, "Is she familiar?!" "Yes... She's not staff... But she's around a fair bit. Her name is **Ellywick**. She's a bit of an enigma! She writes beautiful music."

Oswen decides to spend some time as we wait ritual-casting Detect Magic. Perhaps Ellywick is illusory. After ten minutes, it's working - and a *VERY* strong sense of magic. Mightily magical. Most of the equipment is extremely magical - the lute, the frog, she herself, her blouse, a pouch, her backpack, a hat with a feather, earrings... Oswen shouts up, "Hi, I'm Oswen, I hope I don't seem rude, I'm just a bit concerned - is it *safe* having that much magical energy around you?!" Ellywick smiles and floats down. "Oswen. I know! Oswen Hafflethwaite. I am **Ellywick Tumblestrum**. Have you made it through your golden ticket? "10 out of 16. But how did you know?" A mischievous grin; "I might have maybe arranged it..." "But N.M?" "Oh, that's **Nikolas**, the ticketmaster!" "Oh so it was *his* box and your ticket. I *see*."

Oswen detects that this entire *creature* must be magical. She shimmers with dimensional magic. Upon realising that, Oswen gasps. "Oh - you can travel between worlds? Directly?" "Yes! Yes. My goodness. You're very learned!" Oswen blushes and says, "Well, I don't know how to assess that for myself - but - well, first, thank you! So much. For ticket! But why?"

"Well I was doing some divination. Following the threads - it's what I do. I can't directly intervene - causality and whatnot, there are rules! - but I find knots and tangles in the threads of fate and sort of - y'know! - untangle them. I'm part of a cadastre of sorts, we divide up planes, a force for good; let's just leave it at that."

"Am I a knot?"

"I thought that you probably were! So I thought I could help you help the world. You seem kind of like the 'helping the world' type. Maybe along the way you might just find what you're looking for - answers to questions you have. I know you need to get to Prismeer. There *is* a portal here."

"Can you help find it? Or is that intervening?"

"I can tell you that it is in one of these tents. It's an actual portal, which is both a window to another world, but also not a physical window; it must be opened with the right key. I understand that the key is a phrase, or a short poem. A verbal key. I don't know what that key is. I think it's probably one of the mirrors in the hall of illusions. I do also know that **something has gone wrong within Prismeer. For some reason, I can't walk there. Something has closed that domain of the light off from the multiverse! I always had an open and welcome invitation with great hospitality from Zybilna, so something is wrong.**"

Oswen thanks her. "Yes, well, it appears lots of people want to know that. But not Mr Witch or Mr Light, and given that I was hoping to ask them about the portal - that's perhaps not the best plan in the world! They seem to be involved."

"Hmm. Well. I'll continue with investigations of my own. If you haven't solved things by night's end, find me. I'll be right here!"

Oswen goes back to the table. She recounts the conversation. Suddenly, she sees a shadow pass over the side of the group - a huge bugbear turns up. It's Burly. "Oh! Hi Burly!" "Hullo". He wears a big pumpkin on his head. "How did you know it was me?" "The clothes!" "Ah... Hm... Hello Kindle!" "Hey Burly. Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be guarding the wagons?" "Well apparently Management want to see you..." and he points to Oswen. Oswen looks a bit freaked out. "Me?! Oh no. I wonder if I broke the rules..." Burly says, "Oh no, they seem in good spirits! Come with me. I won't let anything happen to you." "Can my friends come?" "I think so?" - so we all go.

On the way, Leonidas asks if he should be worried. Do we need protecting? "I don't have a weapon!" Oswen says, "Well, Burly said we'd be safe. I trust him."

Near the staff area, Burly waves a hand a doorway appears in a big wall of thorns that stops unauthorised people getting through. He leads us to the most ornate, lived-in looking wagon. Leaning against it is an old-looking guy dressed as a clown, puffing on a pipe that blows big blue bubbles. He *glares* at Oswen - or is it Burly? Burly totally ignores the clown; opens the wagon's door; says "After you!" - the clown moves to object but Burly just stares. The clown glares back. All four of us enter.

The wagon is bigger inside than out. A beautiful, white marble dining table, a low chandelier, shelves and shelves and racks and racks of glasses, baubles, masks, whole racks of clown costumes, a rack on the other side that's a rack of near-identical "gangster suits", and a massive wine rack.

The elf is here - Mr Light. An overly theatrical bow. "Ah! Come in! It is a delight to meet you. Ah! I see you've met some of the Help. I am Mr Light and this my long-time associate Mr Witch." Now Oswen realises that Mr Witch is also an elf, but darker, ashy-grey; he nods and lifts his top hat politely; he doesn't speak.

Oswen says, "I hope it's OK to bring my friends." "Of course!" says Mr Light. He gestures to his sceptre. "The Witchlight vain picks up every nuance of emotion in the carnival - and *you* have made the carnival great. In fact it is rare for us to reach maximum happiness as soon as midnight! I really want to thank you for that." Oswen answers, "Well, I've just been enjoying myself. The carnival is great!"

Mr Witch clears his throat. "I sense you have a purpose here. Are you here to find things you lost as a child?"

Oswen hesitates. "Well, I do have a purpose. And at least *part* of that - the sort of strange quest I think I'm on - well, I do have a hope that maybe I'll find answers of that nature. But it's not the main reason."

"Explain!"

"Well, a friend of mine - just like me - used to live in the Fey Wild, but then found themselves here. Unlike myself, they were able to stay in contact with acquaintances in their previous life. But then, about a year ago, all contact stopped and they've become worried. So, when the carnival arrived, it seemed like a good place to come to see if anyone might know anything, or even help me get back there. I haven't been able to find a way back to the Fey since I left."

"So you're looking for a portal?"

"I guess so! If there is one?"

"Well... The mythology is that there is indeed a portal somewhere in this carnival! Portals move around. They're unpredictable..." Oswen insight 13. Something is being held back. Answers are predictable to hide things. So she says, "That's certainly true. If I were able to find a portal here - if there really is one - would I be permitted to travel through it, or is that forbidden?" "Oh, if you find one, you absolutely can travel through it - no rules against that! We know there must be a portal somewhere as sometimes people disappear for a while to Prismeer, but then they come back."

Then they try to talk about all the reasons to not go to Prismeer. Oswen ADV Insight only 8,9+1 -> 10. They're very convincing! It certainly sounds convincing. It sounds dangerous and bad. But she promised Kettlesteam. And she *thinks* she promised the Professor too, though can't remember if she used the word "promise".

Mr Light changes the topic of conversation. "You're in the running to be the Witchlight Monarch! Let's focus on happy and fun and enjoyable and bright tonight."

"Sounds good to me! What happens if I win?"

"Well! You get the charm and title of the Witchlight Monarch, a *very* fancy title and very meaningful. There can only be one Witchlight Monarch on any given night!" - he makes it sound impressive but really this just means that there's always a Monarch on every single night on every world. But that said, he doesn't seem to be lying, so perhaps there is something more to it. Maybe in the Fey.

They're hiding *something*. Perhaps her friends know more; she can't think of anything to say, as basically a stranger and not one of any significiant power or strength, that might convince them to suddenly open up! So instead, she might try asking her friends again.

With that in mind she brightens up, acts all enthusiastic and says, "Well, I can't deny, it *does* sound like fun being that Monarch thing... I suppose I need to enter more contests?!" "You just need to have fun, and make sure the people around you are having fun. That's all we ever ask."

Things wrap up. As we start to head out, to thank her for "lightening the mood", Mr Light waves the Witchlight Vein over the faerie wings. **This imbues them with the ability to fly - for real - for ten minutes**, in any number of 1 minute or more bouts. After that the magic is exhausted. That's pretty good and Oswen is genuinely grateful!

Outside and once clear of prying clown ears (!) she says: "So, if we were to find a way to get to this portal and figure out how to open it, given that we've done pretty much all the rides" (to Leonidas) "and eaten a lot of food, would it be - would we all be having - a kind of fun, investigating this?"

The answer is interrupted by "psst!" - Oswen looks around... Standing, poorly concealed next to a thicket of brambles, is Burly. Good! "Ah! Good. Burly. I thought you might be around. I wondered two things - one, what's with the clown?" "**Thaco**? Thaco's an asshole! You can't trust him. He's just surly and he hates me. He's the oldest employee here. Been around since the 70s" - whatever that means!" Oswen says, "OK, wow! Noted. The other thing was - your brother. Do you think he went into the portal too?" His ears flop down. "That's the only thing I can think of. All his stuff is still here! He didn't say anything either - he didn't say goodbye and I'm always in the same place." Oswen says, "Yes, and others are missing, and we think the same. We want to get through and go looking for them." "You seem like the only people who might have a chance! Mr Witch and Mr Light - they are good people. They've always been good to us!" Kindle and Inafina nod. "But they're hiding something. Something's happened. Their behaviour has not been the same for a few months. I feel like someone's got something over them - they're being asked to do something against their will. There *is* a portal. I don't know why they spoke about it that way..." - he thinks for a long moment - "...I overheard something the other night. And there was another time I was *trying* to eavesdrop, but I saw a black crow person wearing rags listening in - I chased them away! **But the first time I did overhear something about them having their hands tied - 'the agreement as unpalatable as it seems', they couldn't risk 'their secret being revealed'.** I think they're being blackmailed."

Oswen nods. "Well, the crow turns out to be a friend, of sorts. It's Kettlesteam. They were trying to listen in for the same reasons all of us would - the same suspicions. It does seem likely, what you say."

"So how do we make them tell us what's going on? How do we get them to show you where the portal is and how to use it? We need something."

"You all like them?"

All three nod.

"Do they know that?"

"Well - surely - surely they do?" but then Burly adds, "But if we need to blackmail them in return, you could steal the watch! The Witchlight Watch that Mr Witch has. Without it, he can't pack up the carnival!"

Oswen says, "I don't know if I could. I'm no thief and it goes against what I - like to think I stand for? But if it came to it... But - first - I think - well if some of the staff, as many as we can gather, if we spoke to them - let them know you support them no matter what, no matter what their secret is, say we can help, they don't have to do this alone; they know people are missing - they must be worried about them too. And probably don't like those three thieves any more than we do. We'd have to make sure they aren't listening in, just in case, if we do this." Burly says that he's only ever seen them around for people who didn't pay. But Oswen describes seeing Sowfoot in the mirror in the hallway, trying to influence a guest. On the *other side* of the mirror.

- We maybe need to rally the troops!
- Find a way and a time and a place to mass-confront Mr Witch & Light without "the three" being present.
- Detect Magic, illusion hall, see if we can at least find the portal mirror if it's there.

(Counts as a short rest - Oswen regains her L1 slot via Arcane Recovery).

We proceed to the illusion hall, to see if we can find that portal. Oswen gets two punches to let her and Leonidas in. Kindle doesn't like it inside; in fact as a general rule, Witchlight staff don't like going in. Oswen smiles at Leonidas - "Just you and I again" - and she holds his hand and they step inside together - avoiding the laughter spell zone!

The first area is strange and confusing because the very tall mirrors are arranged to catch the light in a curious way. Disorientation appears to be the goal. There seem to be different pathways to take, but the layout is (intentionally) confusing - but the worst of it is in the entranceway, it seems. After that - the mirrors are *astonishing*. They show Oswen as a child. Then the next shows her as an old woman - Leonidas likewise appears young and old. Different mirrors show different versions of a possible future, or different ages. No two mirrors show the same reflection. Leonidas hypothesises that perhaps carnival folk all seem to have difficult histories; often it feels like they "ran away to the circus", so perhaps they don't like being reminded of childhood or possible futures? He and Oswen agree that at least, so far, this is pretty amazing and can't understand why the others don't like coming in.

Oswen has to spend ten minutes to cast her Detect Magic ritual, so she gets to work while Leonidas stays close, but keeps looking into mirrors, chatting idly. She warns him to watch out for Sowfoot! Perception disadv 13,13+1->14. She notices movement out of the corner of her eye... It makes her uneasy. It's not Leonidas or her.

Eventually, the spell completes. Other than mirrors in the entranceway, which are just confusing, all here are magic. A question of school, though. Spot the odd one out! We move methodically from place to place, but despite our best efforts, there doesn't seem to be any different mirror. Arcana 15; the mirrors have a very powerful magic, actually, more than would be expected. There is *more than illusion* here. Tied in, there's necromancy, divination, transmutation, conjuration, evocation. Everything more or less.

It there's a distinctly different mirror here, she lacks the ability to find it. Perhaps hidden? She tries to find anything hidden or similar; investigation, 19. Nothing seems hidden.

We exit and explain to others - kinda fun, don't know why you don't like it! Kindle says, "Well - I mean - it can be a bit creepy in there? I know there are some other people have told us that they've seen disturbing and gruesome things... It might just be a rumour?" "Well Sowfoot did appear inside a mirror, I saw that myself. And there was something moving in the corner of the eye, I never could get a good look though." Kindle mentions that whenever people have gone missing, it's been in there! The cub was the last. Oswen says, "Trouble is, I couldn't find a thing - every mirror seemed identical, nothing seemed hidden; strange magic, very powerful, but no one mirror stood out. Maybe it's all of them! We know we'd need a password or passphrase, so we're back to square one; we need to see if we can get something out of Mr Witch and Mr Light.

Oswen, history 15+3->18. She thinks about the dryads.

* The power of names; not to give your name away.
* The rule of reciprocity; not be flippant about giving and receiving of gifts (owing favours).
* You must always offer hospitality.
* But it is easy to break the rules accidentally!
* Value is perceived differently; part of it is the power of promises and agreements.
* In the fey a promise is bound and enforced by the fabric of the plane.

Oswen says to everyone - "If Mr Witch and Mr Light are being coerced, there's a possibility they're bound by an agreement. That they broke a rule, or did something unwise, or even - thinking perhaps at the time it was good - got drawn into some pact of some kind. If that was in the fey, it won't matter what anyone says to them, unless the pact *allows* them to talk about it. They might be unable to speak about it no matter how much we want to. So..." and Oswen looks to Inafina in particular! - "...I hate the idea of stealing that watch. And I don't know if even that's enough to break a fey promise, but, maybe Burly's idea is the only way we have?"

Inafina asks, "But what do we want from them?"

"I suppose, one of two things; to know what's going on with them and the carnival - these strange decisions and behaviour, the strange three new additions. But ultimately - really - I suppose just the portal. We're looking for a way in. And they might be able to give us *that* without breaking any promise. But equally they might be able to give us *that* without stealing the watch."

We wonder who else we might talk to. Burly only happened to overhear something because he was trying to catch Kettlesteam. Mr Witch and Mr Light are normally very careful and don't speak openly outside of the carriage. It needs to be someone deliberately eavesdropping.

Oswen has her hawk. And then there's Thaco... He's always hanging around. And the Kenku was eavesdropping too. Oswen asks Orvil to see if he can find Kettlesteam. But she also calls out, "Kettlesteam if you're nearby, let me know!" - Investigation: a high 21. Orvil and Oswen manage to find Kettlesteam after about 10 minutes, hiding at the edge of the staff area. So Oswen says hi and she knows this is now difficult because Kettlesteam can only repeat things its heard. But that happens to be exactly what we want!

Kettlesteam says:

* As Mr Light - "Someone is going to find out about this! They'll shut us down! They'll shut us down and they'll hand the carnival back to her. I don't want to swap back... I like this carnival. The other one's just too depressing!"

* As Mr Witch, more calm - "We agreed to this pact. Our hands were forced, *but* our eyes were open. We let the Hourglass Coven take what it wants and in return we stay in business and **Isolde** continues running our old carnival. That *is* what you wanted, right?"

* "Yes! But at what cost?"

Oswen awkwardly hugs Kettlesteam! "Just wonderful! You are amazing!" - then to others, "Who is Isolde? Anyone know? Or the Hourglass Coven?" - blank looks. Who might know? This is old. Whose the longest serving in the carnival?" Burly tells us we can't hang out in the staff area. Especially not Kettlesteam! We start to move on.

Kindle and Inafina aren't sure who was earliest. We all start asking around. Who's been here first? Before you? Etc etc. - some have been here up to 45 years, but joined with Mr Witch and Mr Light already in charge. The Carnival is old. All roads lead to Thaco! But even *he* only joined once Witch & Light were around. All the staff here seem to be too recent.

We seem to be at a dead end. Leonidas reminds us that the main aim was the portal, and it doesn't seem like a secret - everyone knows there's one here. Oswen figures, then, that if we don't think coercion is great or whatever, maybe get the Monarch title and just *ask*!

We have about two hours left - but the last hour of that is "being the Monarch". Time to have fun! But not much time. Hurry!

We haven't done the bubbles. So, to the teapot! 20ft tall, beautiful whirling paintings that move! Dragons. They fly past and breathe out huge streams of bubbles. A door at the base has a short queue to the ticket punch. Strangely, at the ticket booth are 7 old goblins drinking from mismatched teacups. A water pump and spout is attached to a very large flower; every now and again they refill the tea cups. They take turns punching tickets. The goblin that talks to us has a necklace made out of silver teaspoons and enamel pictures of different locations on the handle; "I'm *Tricklewise*. I will punch your fairies!" First, he points to a sign. It says, "The word that you intend to say, try saying it a different way".

He says "You understand what happens here? You go in the teapot and out pops toil and trouble. Hand me your bramble thicket? I must punch it!" - oh, rhyming slang. 14 of 16 punches now, for the two of us. "Have you enjoyed your powder flight?" Does he just mean night? She hedges her bets and says, "The Carnival has given us a good singing rhyme" (time). Tricklewise beams. The other six goblins grin too; apparently, rhyming was good. One reaches into a pocket and hands her a tea bag! "Scatter leaf tea, this little bag be; open, spread it on the ground, circle round and round, protects from good and wickedness! Just don't leave where you've put it and don't make a sound. Sip a tea and safe you'll be from wickedness and the holy." She takes it and Leonidas says, "Thanking thee, grateful are we, for this bag of delicious bee".

The door opens and in we go! (The carnival mood lifts again).

Leonidas strides in first, riding the high of his closing quip. He pops out in a bubble at the top. The doors open for Oswen who rushes through. She pops out too. She's seen this done and wants to try and merge them - but ACRO 7+2->9, not great! Wobbly. Again, 3+2->5. Goes way off course. Leonidas is laughing a lot and tries running her way. He gets 16, she gets 14 on the third round - that does it! We merge into a single bubble, floating above the carnival.

It's quite high up. Oswen says, "You get a nice view from here." "Yes... The carnival against the empty countryside, that strange river; and look! Over there! We can even see the sea from here." Oswen looks up. "The stars too, look, much clearer now we're further from the lights below."

Hands are held. Another bashful kiss. The bubble pops and we feather fall slowly down.

Oswen grins and says, "Well, there's just one thing left. The carousel, then we've done everything!"

Leonidas grins too; "You've always been a completist."

Unicorns stand motionless around the carousel. Beautiful colours. People climb onto a unicorn each then a female centaur sets it in motion - Oswen, nature 18+3->21, not a centaur! She's the ticket puncher. Oswen's last two. At the front of the queue, Oswen says, "Hi! I'm Oswen. You look marvellous, but forgive me, I don't want to be rude - but - not a Centaur?" "No! I'm not at all. I'm simply a human who made a bad deal..." - and she looks sad. But that's not allowed, so she "pretends" to cheer up. Persuasion 15+0 from Oswen. "I'm **Diana Cloppington**." (Whatever her *real* name was, she gave it away). "I was a warrior. A great warrior once. I had my favourite warhorse, but in the middle of the war she went missing. So I heard there were some people who could grant wishes and make great magic happen... This was a long time ago... I came here to find a doorway to Prismeer. That's where the wish granters were. I sought Granny Nightshade of the..." - and makes strange coughing up noises, weird brown tree sap coming up! Mushrooms blister up on her, and she's in pain; she stops, groaning; they settle; "I'm sorry I can't talk about it! Would you like to ride the unicorns? You can speak to them in your mind. But to earn their trust you must learn the names of all 8!"

Oswen apologises for making her talk about a forbidden subject. But we'll go in! How do we find the 8 names?

She pulls a rope across, that says "Closed temporarily for essential repairs!" and gives Oswen a clay pot of gold paint and paint brushes. "All you have to do is correctly guess the names of the 8 unicorns. They come in pairs, and in each pair, one of the unicorns has missing letters in its name."

We approach a unicorn pair.

A fabulous light yellow and blonde called "Fortune". The other is muscular male, brown with white patches. It has "B...". **Fortune favours the Bold**! We paint the names; the unicorns both stop being frozen as if part of the ride, become 'real' and nuzzle. We smile and head to the next pair.

One which is brown, chestnut, deep, red highlights; long lustrous brown mane, called "Fall". The other is particularly fabulous looking! Snowy white, glittering horn, big eyelashes. Super over the top. "P....". Oswen was ahead of this at the first word. **Pride comes before a Fall**. The rear up in excitement, urging us to ride them on the carousel!

Third pair. One is in an action pose! It's as if it is trying to do some kind of acrobatic roll. It's grey, mottled. Angular, cut; it is called "Stone". The other has short, fuzzy, clipped hair. A strange colour - greenish-brown. Two missing letters. First and last are: "M..s". **A rolling Stone gathers no Moss**. The roll is finished; the unicorn stands up. The other almost purrs in Oswen's mind.

The last pair has a strange, macabre-looking unicorn, then a strange, smaller, runt-of-the-litter called "Nine". The almost-Frankenstein unicorn seems patched together; ".t.t..". This one needs a roll. Oswen history 17 - ah, right. **A Stitch in time saves Nine**. All of the unicorns are now animated.

Diana looks relieved. Insight only 7, no idea why. We are invited to choose a unicorn and ride. "Let them speak to you!"

Leonidas chooses Bold. Oswen chooses Nine.

Oswen WIS save 13, but she chooses to fail anyway as it feels like someone is trying to talk to her in her head. The unicorns are talking.

"What mystery are you trying to unfold? Maybe we might know for we have been with the carnival for centuries".

Oswen thinks back, "Mr Witch and Mr Light are not the original proprietors of the carnival. Do you know what the deal was that caused them to take over from Isolde?"

"Yes. Isolde is the Eladrin elf owner. She and her magic sword ran this carnival that we were part of. She helped and saved us and enchanted us, and gave us this as a home aeons ago. But about 50 years ago, these two Shadar-Kai, with a tragic story between them - but also one full of hope, unusual for Shadar-Kai - were running this sad and depressing domain of dread; a carnival that was the dark mirror of this one. It too travelled between worlds. Where this is full of light and joy, that - is still a carnival - has a sinister edge, like something might go wrong at any time. It was designed to give hope and take it away. Make something fun turn dangerous. Isolde and the two - not known as Witch & Light then - had a bet, that the carnival was the reason why they were so dour and that they were cheerful, hopeful people after all. Isolde took them up on the bet and they swapped. *They agreed to run each other's carnivals until both happened to cross paths on the same world again*. Now - Witch & Light made a deal with the Hourglass Coven - who can somewhat control fate - to make sure that the two would never meet again. We can tell you no more of that."

(By the end of the story all 8 unicorns are contributing parts)

Oswen asks, "Can anything be done to lift the curse, or whatever it is, on Diana?"

"Granny Nightshade - **Scabatha Nightshade** - delights in twisting people's wishes. Only she can undo what she has done. You would need to *make* her lift that - either that, or someone more powerful, someone like Zybilna, except she's been **frozen in time**."

Oswen says, "Goodness! How? By whom?!"

"By the Three. We do not know how, but they have seized the domain and rent it asunder such that each of them might have their own kingdom. The Three rule over the parts that they have taken. **Hither, Thither and Yon**. They are a coven, and powerful as a coven. But they're so riddled with distrust that *each is convinced that their sisters are secretly plotting against them* and *each has a specific weakness that they try and keep hidden*. We can tell you no more!"

The ride stops.

Diana comes over and gives Oswen a hopeful look. Oswen says, "We think we're travelling to Prismeer. We know it's damaged now. We know about Nightshade. If we can help we will. I can't promise. Too many unknowns. But we'll do our best."

She nods. She obviously knows this stuff but can't tell anyone.

Oswen adds "Really. We'll do our best. A few of us are going. I think we've a chance - a real one. Don't lose hope."

(End of Part 1.2)
