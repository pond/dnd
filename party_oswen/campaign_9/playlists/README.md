# Campaign Nine

The ongoing adventures of halfling wizard Oswen Hafflethwaite, harengon monk Inafina Greyfoot, bugbear cleric Kindle Borstromi and satyr bard Bel Bottom.



## Part 1
### New Horizons

A knighthood and a keep is all well and good, but when invited to a costume ball gatecrashed by a creature from the Far Realm, you'll need a good deal more than either to figure out what to do - and soon, the party realises that there is far more at stake than they ever could have imagined.



## Part 2
### All Things Are Possible

The hub of all planes! A wondrous place, but there is work to be done. The path leads to ever-darker places - they must all work together or lose themselves and fail their task. Then, at a moment of relief, just at the moment of meeting powerful new friends, scrying shows the fall of a whole world to a terrible creature and from that moment, nothing will be the same.



## Part 3
