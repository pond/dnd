# Campaign Nine

The ongoing adventures of halfling wizard Oswen Hafflethwaite, harengon monk Inafina Greyfoot, bugbear cleric Kindle Borstromi and satyr bard Bel Bottom.



## Part 1
### New Horizons

A knighthood and a keep is all well and good, but when invited to a costume ball gatecrashed by a creature from the Far Realm, you'll need a good deal more than either to figure out what to do - and soon, the party realises that there is far more at stake than they ever could have imagined.



## Part 2
### All Things Are Possible

The hub of all planes! A wondrous place, but there is work to be done. The path leads to ever-darker places - they must all work together or lose themselves and fail their task. Then, at a moment of relief, just at the moment of meeting powerful new friends, scrying shows the fall of a whole world to a terrible creature and from that moment, nothing will be the same.



## Part 3
### Of Many Domains

An insight into the mechanism of reality's alteration is found. The party travels between wonder and terror, as the first steps are taken in the plan to defeat the rising evil... They'll go on a ride they'll never forget.



## Part 4
### Broken Worlds

The universe never fails to surprise! The party is entranced by shattered planes, beautiful people, an astonishing citadel and other wonders - but after bearing witness to a terrible, great flood, they must venture to a world's edge and do battle to restore balance. Just when all seems well, a friend brings news of the escape of an imprisoned being, and the stakes raise higher yet again...



## Part 5
### The Eternal Night

...and to the prison we must go, traversing where domains of shadow leak into domains of light. Unexpected alliances and dangerous enemies abound as a desperate plan is hatched to find a vital artefact, but how can one escape from a place which is inescapable?



## Part 6
### Gods And Monsters

We must travel to a world overtaken by evil - but do not find what we expect. Rapidly embroiled in intrigue and hopelessly outclassed, a high-risk plan to pit two extremely powerful adversaries against each other is hatched. It looks like there are many ways to fail and only one way to succeed!
