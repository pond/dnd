PROLOGUE PART 9.SOMETHING - High Cs if we're straight into something epic?
PROLOGUE PART 9.1 - Genshin Cameilia Nights?

**GNOG: A NEW CAMPAIGN**
In Others: Dance of Sabzeruz is a weird bossanova track with the Sumeru riff that could be a montage of Taz & Gnog (and maybe others) hopping between planets and places, just exploring, hanging out, good times.

**WATERDEEP TRAGEDY**
BSG S1 Kobol's Last Gleaming, very introspective and sad; Earthsea/Waterdeep style instrumentation at 0:45 on, and just happens to have something extremely close to the Earthsea/Waterdeep refrain at 1:40.
