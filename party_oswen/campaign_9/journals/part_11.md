# Oswen: Part 2.11
## Campaign day 29
### Trade Gate, around 8:30am

The Trade Gate version of a Travelodge wasn't exactly luxury, but it did the job and we wake up after an uneventful night feeling better-rested than we have in a good while. As light streams in through the shutters, Bel sits up, yawns and stretches, then - seeming in a particularly good mood - asks the rest of us if we had a good night. Actually, yes, we did.

We decide to eat in town for breakfast, so we get dressed and kitted up and head out. It's a lively morning. Bel sees to have somewhere in mind already - it turns out to be a waffle show he'd spotted just while we were wandering around the previous day. "I really want to try these - they look unhealthy! - see, there's this syrup that's poured all over them..."

People-watching is interesting. Some unusual races, including - Inafina tells us - some semi-celestial beings. She is reminded of Captain Inda. We muse about how they're doing - would they be at the Radiant Citadel by now?

Suddenly, WIS save, Oswen - dirty 20. Familiar magic sweeps around the room and then rests on *her*. She cuts the connection off. **Detect Thoughts**. She whispers suddenly - "Trouble afoot! Thought detection!" - but then Inafina is struck. Another good roll, 17, *just* enough it seems - she struggles but manages it and says "me too!" in hushed tones. We see Bel looking confused - it seems he almost fell to it, but reacted and used Countercharm. Nat 20. "Kindle! Think of pumpkins!" he exclaims. But Kindle is hearty and easily resists.

Inafina's on full alert. Perception ADV 21, based on hearing - she's thinking, *quiet* table. But nothing! There's nobody by themselves and all tables have regular conversation happening. Simultaneously, Oswen ARC 20, the spell just fired - there's a very brief moment where it could still be detected - she immediately casts Detect Magic. She focuses specifically on Detect Thoughts -> ADV perception -> 16. That's enough; an alley just beyond the room, she can see the top of a head! She tells Inafina. "Look! There!"

Inafina could kick through the window, dash out the front and around, or try and jump over the bar and weave through the kitchen to go out of the back door. Window risky - back door? That would be faster. Maybe 50ft, vs the front at 100ft. But the front door is clear, no risk of tripping over kitchen hands! Front door - dash as bonus action (Step Of Wind). And now she's face to face (sort of!) with a female dwarf (!) clearly concentrating on a spell. Inafina's arrived way quicker than expected and in a hurry swipes with the staff and misses wildly, but the second strike hits and the dwarf is stunned - their spell fails immediately.

Bel arrives at her side, and throws Bardic Inspiration to Inafina. At that moment the stunned dwarf tries to back away. Inafina - reaction, unarmed strike with her big foot hooked behind - the dwarf falls backwards and is prone. Clumsily they get back up and Inafina threatens her with the staff - "You can either talk or I'll put you in the ground!" - with bardic inspiration, intimidation, 20.

The dwarf apologises - "this is not what it looks like!" "What is it then?!" "Who?" "I only know who they fell! I don't know their name. I ran into them last night. I met them in a drinking hall - they came back to my room..." - Inafina is convinced (insight 12) and Kindle's face, too (insight 21) softens.

It transpires that this person took something important from her - and they didn't look the same when she caught them stealing it and running. A shape shifter of some kind. "They - they could be *anyone!*"

She's very worried - being targeted, she thinks. She doesn't want to talk here. It's dangerous.

We convince her to return to the hotel. Since we'd headed to breakfast, we never did check out and pay for another night just to keep things simple.

She's **Lili**. We introduce ourselves. Lili is somewhat skilled too. Inafina's original strike with the staff landed more heavily than she intended, yet barely left a scratch! Lili's skills lie in getting into areas people normally cannot and getting things where people normally cannot get them.

Oswen takes a punt - "You're not related to the Golden Vault, are you?" Oswen sees a reaction but isn't sure if it is guarded - like secrecy - or hostile - like a dislike (Insight 10). Oswen decides to take *another* punt - "We kind of got involved with them..." - and shows the locket/key. At this Lili jumps forward - alarming Kindle! - but only to enthusiastically show a similar key, on a very short key on a chain.

That's a relief!

"Something to do with the defence against Vecna then?"

"I don't know! I was told just to get this box. And I was supposed to deliver it. And I..." - she's worried, embarrassed; "I was told to be very careful and not trust anyone! I've had no contact with people for weeks - I just thought - they were so *nice* - we had a connection... I just wanted a drink... I met this beautiful woman, and..."

But now, she's not alone. And she's not stupid either. She was tricked - probably studied and examined for a  while before the trickster struck.

She doesn't know what the box contains. It must be precious; she confesses that she had to work her way into a casino in Avernus (woah!) and, after a long time, she built trust and a reputation. She got into the "inner rooms" - the VIP rooms - and from there she was able to sneak *into the vault* and take this.

Well, we had a similar experience - but hers was more hardcore! Very, very impressive. We have to coax it out of her, but the casino belongs **to Tiamat** herself. She's terrified that Tiamat might even know! But we realise that *someone else* was probably doing the same thing as her. Working in, spotted her first, then just waited until she'd got the object - did the hard work - then moved in and stole it, using the insights they'd gained observing her all that time to help.

So how do we find this thing? We don't know what's in the box and Lili has limited magical resources. We figure - not a local crew; this could go all the way back to Avernus. So, they'll be leaving the city. A ship? Well, possibly too easy to trace and find out. Speak to the harbourmaster, done. Go to a gate... This is a shapeshifer of some sort. Blend in to a crowd instead of standing out, hiding in plain site, as Lili had originally hoped.

She'd have exited on the Concordant Express. The what?! There's a *train* that moves between planes! We hypothesise that if Lili hadn't gone for a drink (she'd said "What if I didn't...?!") then the plan must've originally been to follow her somewhere. And town is too obvious and open/public. The train - more options. We figure this bad person might've been going on the same train as Lili - and sure enough, Lili has a ticket.

But how do we know this person is on the train? Lili is torn - but **the train leaves in half an hour!**

Kindle has Divine Inspiration available; Oswen has Divination; time is short. Oswen makes a call. "Kindle, see if Yondalla can help. I'll try it my way. Between the two of us, maybe we'll get an answer."

Kindle reaches out and asks Oswen what to ask. Yes/no answers.

* "Our new friend Lili had a box stolen from her last night. Will the person who stole the box be on the Concordant Express that departs in half an hour from now?"

- **YES**

* Lili asks - "And will they have that item with them?"

- **YES**

* Bel asks - "And are they disguised in a way that makes them stand out, like, hiding in plain sight?"

- **NO**

...so they're trying to blend in. The spell ends. Oswen says - "I really don't think I can do any better than that! I suggest we hurry and get some tickets!" - Lili leads the way, and we **run**! We're down an arm of Trade Gate we've not previously explored. Everything is rounded metal, stacked up in a kind of retro-futuristic Art Deco way.

We reach a station of sorts. There are schedules on boards on the wall. Planes are named. Different schedules go to different planes in different orders.

At a desk - "4 tickets to the 10 o'clock please!" says Lili. She insists on paying.

Looking at the boards, the 10 o'clock looks like it goes Clockwise. We have a few minutes before boarding. Lili is nervous - she might be recognised, so we lend her the Hat of Disguise; Bel then takes the Helm of Telepathy, as he'll try to detect the scoundrel on the train; and Kindle will use a Prayer of Healing so she can attune more quickly than normal, and soon she's able to change her appearance and Bel can scan surface thoughts. But we don't have time right now and must be careful until onboard.

We need a reason to scan the train. And in this, we learn that we need to upgrade to 1st class. There's a second section to the train that we couldn't otherwise access; and wouldn't that be a *great* place to hide if you'd just stolen something?! We have only a handful of seconds - we get to the ticket counter again, just about to close for that departure because it's about to depart; no refunds, we're told! But Bel puts on the charm and asks if there might possibly be one cabin left for the five of us? Yes! Bel produces his bag of Trade Gate coins, grabs a handful and drops them on the counter in a deliberately ostentatious move. A few are taken; the rest are given back; we swap our tickets. Gold foil, black paper, writing in white - very fancy. "First Class Caboose, Cabin C".

Just in the nick of time - an announcement is made while we're getting the new tickets - the train is already boarding.

We head out, following others who are hurrying out. It's a beautiful, gleaming, polished metal thing that's at the platform - a series of long carriages. The design is striking. Everything is sort of oblique, leaning backwards, as if being pulled at speed but frozen in time. Our cabin is near the front. We think there must be almost 100 people queueing and boarding. Inafina notices something like 12 cars; it's long.

The creatures running the train are really strange. Geometric shapes of various kinds, with appendages that seem suited to specific tasks. Lili tells us that they are *Modrons*. They're not exactly friendly, but certainly unfailingly polite, efficient and - as far as we can tell, at least - very precise.

Perception: Oswen 8 - it's very strange here, super interesting!

Inafina 23 - notices these "modrons" flying or at least on *top* of the train; guards? - then notices the front of the train, the thing that pulls the carriages isn't a bunch of horses or something, it seems to be a giant modron! There are wheels and the train sits on a metal track, yet the tracks seem to curve up and enter the modron engine where hands seem to be holding parts of tracks! Does it construct the tracks as it goes? But she hears some commotion and disapproving noise from 1st Class; further away, sounds of interest - busybodies - from what's happening in 1st Class. A large wagon with thick metal sides is being rolled up to a double-height car near the back, with way more modrons and it looks like the metal is thicker on that car - no windows either.

We're being beckoned inside but Inafina hangs back as the other three go inside to observe this curious wagon. Clearly, some kind of prisoner transport. There's very little gap between the wagon and the rear car, but she sees what look like 3 entities escorted by - something. Not modrons. Creatures with spiky pikes, with uniforms - dark red robes with silver piping, wide cowls, metal shoulder pads, bracers, big pads... But the prisoners are much harder to make out. Just three forms. One is big - Kindle sized. The other two are smaller.

The train is about to go - Inafina's the only one left at the platform! She hurries inside. She catches up with us and tells us what she saw.

Inside is a - well, foyer, basically. It's big and spacious. Comfortable, wide armchairs. An aesthetic that reads "Fritz Lang Metropolis". Bags are being taken to cabins.., We hold onto ours! Lily is anxious to get to the cabin so she can gain a disguise, so we hurry in there and Kindle starts his incantation. Ten minutes later - and during which, the train departs - it's done. Bel can use Helm and Lili changes to look like a very - almost perfectly! - generic old woman, hunched over.

Oswen is looking out of the window. The "train" flies - it is already quite high! - and announcements mention that gravity *does* work as normal, so be careful! We also learn there is **no teleportation allowed** with wards to protect that. Cabins 4 and 8 have food. There's apparently a band, but that's in the "entertainment car".

* The next stop is Elysium in **45 minutes**

We have no idea when the thief might leave the train so have to assume, however unlikely it sounds, that they might leave at this first stop. No time to lose. We need an excuse to walk the train... And who knows what we'll find at this last, strange, "prison" car that Inafina saw.

While at it, Oswen HIS 19+5->24, thinking about what this creature might be and that's enough to realise it should really be Arcana -> so that 19 becomes 19+13 -> 32; a *Changeling**. They can only take on forms of people they have seen. They don't have their own form; almost primordial. But it requires concentration and effort to keep that form. They can change their size/mass somewhat, but not too much.

Bel is getting into his best clothes! "We're in *first class!*" he says. He hides the Helm with his top hat! So, we all brush up a bit - we have our ball clothes from way-back and can get at least smart, but not out-of-place. We'd better get started "scanning" 1st class as that doesn't really need a reason; it's only if we get to regular class that we'd need a reason.

In this carriage are three cabins, with us in C - the third. 1st class is near the front, but our cabin is at the "other end" of our car. Cabins B and A are nearer the front. In terms of distance, this isn't like an Earth train - it's big. Carriages are some 20ft wide wall to wall, with rooms wider than long inside - 15ft wide, 10ft deep, with a long corridor, 5ft wide, running the car's length with the rooms alongside. At the front and back of each car is a 5ft deep walkway with a toilet, then outside each end of the car, a further 5ft kind of outside balcony with railing - so, 50ft long in all.

To start with Bel tries a superficial read of anyone he can detect in B or A. Nobody in B, except for a valet that seems to be thinking in modron ways that don't raise any suspicion. In A, one creature; they're feeling a bit aggrieved. Service has dropped! Things aren't what they are. That kind of thing. That's as far as he can reach - nobody in the forward toilet or on the outer balcony. Behind, there's the rear toilet but there's a modron above the car. "Head on a swivel, watching" - very regimented! Six other creatures within 30ft beyond, in the caboose.

"I think I'd better make a quick trip to the bathroom..." says Bel. "I'll be right back!" - he wants to get to the next carriage's bathroom, since there's one more car forward, between ours and the engine. He's buffeted heavily by strong winds as soon as he opens the door to the railing - almost loses his spell for a while. The door beyond can be seen through; there's a modron, who puts out a hand to indicate "no entry". Bel nods and closes the door. What was the modron thinking? "I hope he doesn't try and come in here, I'll have to tell him he isn't authorised to enter the vault!"

He reaches as far as he can forward; just more modrons, both inside and above, all guards.

Bel returns and explains about the discovered vault. Maybe our thief presented themselves as someone important with a valuable item and had it stowed there. But for now - all we can do is try and find them! We all head rearward now, into the caboose car. We find a place to sit, just to give Bel time to scan his way through the car.

Two groups of 3 act like they all know each other - social niceties - but in fact the three on one side really hate the three on the other. That's interesting; if a shapeshifter had taken one of their place, they'd act the part but wouldn't likely have those emotions. There is one other group at the other end of the car, in smaller groups.

* One sits reading a book - that's the superficial thought. Not a bad way to hide surface thoughts if you wanted to! **Question mark on that.**
* Middle-aged couple, very loving and doting; again, the emotions seem real on both sides. Unlikely to be our target.
* A father with two daughters, teenagers; one thinks about boys, the other about how much she wishes she was playing some game (with a name Bel doesn't recognise) with her friends and her father for a boring social event she hates; and the father is worried. Worried about finances, how his daughters hate him, if is wife is cheating on him... Bel pulls away quickly.
* An old man sits with an old lady; old money? She seems to be flitting through attempts to remember things! The old man has rather disturbing thoughts! They seem to focus on the 14 y/o girl!

Bel pulls away again. He whispers, "Do I *have* to do this? There are some very private things..." - Oswen gets the hint, but we think we don't have much choice.

We think we might split up. We'll go next to the food cart, and so long as Kindle and Inafina can see people, they can watch and listen and judge that way. Bel and Oswen can continue to walk the train and if Bel sees something suspicious, Oswen can then try her own casting to dig deeper.

For now, we proceed to car 4, for food and drink. The howling wind between cars makes it hard to notice the beautiful views! "A table for five?" - but Bel and Oswen say that they'll keep walking, so it's a table for three. Inafina and Kindle settle in with Lili while Ben and Oswen walk slowly to keep the scan going. Two tables; one with a couple, one with a group of four.

* The couple - an argument! Bel tries not to read the words as, again, it seems very intrusive. Emotionally one is frustrated and one distressed. Again, he works on the theory that true-feeling emotions seem harder to fake, so he moves to the other table.
* The four - older - a couple who think rather alike, and another couple who likewise seem rather alike, the two couples trying to get common ground on something; they haven't met before. Emotional doubts on one side, suspicion; genuine interest on the other; seems legit.

He motions to Oswen to keep going. Car 5 seems to be for entertainment. It's an aquarium! It's a sort of tunnel and dome of air, made out of thick glass, with the outside of that, up to the car walls, filled with water and all manner of sea life. The roof is glass apparently too, since light floods in.

* A mother with two very young children. Oswen's told Bel that even her size is too small for the changeling, but could be as big as Kindle; anyway, here, he only needs to worry about the mother. She's focused on explaining types of fish. That's a bit like the guy with the book - a distraction - **so, a question mark. Noted.**

* Bel sees a shark (!) which he thinks might be big enough and checks that too. It's a shark. He spots a big turtle... The turtle wants to avoid the shark.

Car 6! It's been almost half an hour since we departed. 15 minutes left. Oswen messages back to the group, "Once you've finished food and drink, you can pretend to be interested in car 5 - it's a big aquarium".

This seems to be for entertainment. There's a small stage with a stand-up comic. Small tables of seating. 8 people plus one comic and two modrons.

* Comic: Focused on the set. Tough crowd. Bel whispers to Oswen to try and find something funny.
* Then there are two couples, four individuals. Both couples - emotional context works fine.
* The first individual isn't laughing as they're not paying attention; they're worried, anxious, doing calculations, they've swindled someone! "She'll never know... It's fine... Except... I've pulled this kind of a scam off so many times before - by the time she *uses* that map..." - Ah, right, next person.
* A second seems aghast at the comic and think they could do a better job, even making up better punchlines. **That's a question mark, then.**
* Next person is unsure if they can have a drink, as if someone had said they shouldn't have one.

An interruption - announcement - leaving the Outlands soon, passing into Elysium. 15 minutes to stop. The scammer leaves, presumably to disembark.

* The last person... The connection immediately breaks. Sat the furthest away, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a trench coat, collar turned up, briefcase, nursing a whiskey. Face obscured.

Bel makes sure he's facing the comic and says, "Possibly not our thief but someone knew I was scanning, even shallow, and broke it. Wide brimmed hat, far end." Oswen nods and uses Message to call the others to this car. "Keep watching the comic!" she says. A punchline, some weak laughter. Trenchcoat laughs louder. A moment later, the rest of the party joins us. Oswen makes a show of quietly greeting, waving them over. She Messages about trenchcoat guy. Inafina looks; perception 19; their head has turned; we are being observed. She whispers a warning; "They're watching now".

Oswen whispers back, "Watch them closely and be ready to move" and uses Detect Thoughts directly on the trenchcoat and _immediately_ pushes deeper. Trenchcoat would know all about it - but apparently they knew anyway. DC18 save - they can't stop her getting in.

* "Oh. Powerful..." - they themselves are concentrating and now *she* has to save! lucky 19; she saves; they were pushing with Detect Thoughts back again.
* What she detects is kind of horrifying; she's detected it before; **this is the mind of a mind flayer**.

Not a changeling. A mind flayer. But not murderous. "Is this the same person before? Or are they all... But they're not who they seem to be?"

She whispers to the group, "Definitely not our thief, but a new problem"... - but then the arcana drops - and Oswen immediately heads straight in their direction. Eye contact attempted. They look alarmed. Oswen calls out, "Friend, perhaps I could buy you a drink?"

The head is raised a bit. Oswen is being shown who he is - as if to say, "Are you sure?". She nods and says, "I'm sure you're thirsty". "I would *never* ask that of someone of my kind if I were you!" and Oswen laughs, which throws the comic who isn't even at the punchline - but then **Inafina hears a blood-curdling scream!** - and there's a bizarre sense of **calm** washing over us. Arcana check Oswen, dirty 30, we've passed through a planar barrier. Elysium. **Very** powerful plane-wide effects are upon us... She's pretty sure that even if she wanted to, she couldn't attack or harm anyone. So she says to the mind flayer, "Well, this new location appears to preclude violence anyway!"

Oswen didn't hear the scream but the mind flayer did and he pushes the chair, grabs his cane and briefcase and starts to run towards the rear. Oswen is then passed by Inafina who was already on the move when *she* heard, and Oswen finds herself very much on the back foot! She runs in and finds Inafina, who sees a mindflayer looming over a body on the floor.

* Inafina thinks it's an attack, and doesn't recognise the one on the ground, but realises this must be the same person she was just chasing and she's very quick - so this person Oswen was moving towards was a mind flayer, and cannot be the aggressor.
* Bel might as he was detecting thoughts and Oswen does, it's the person who was a "scammer" who just left.
* The door closest to us is open and a dwarf-sized person with *smoke* coming off them and hair made of fire is there, looking shocked, probably the one who screamed.

Oswen goes, "Bel, isn't that your scammer?" at the same time as Inafina looks at the fire person and says, "Did you see what happened?" just as guards arrive. The mind flayer says, "Lock down the carriages! There has been a murder! The suspect is one of these three!"

Oswen turns to them and says, "I know you're quite powerful and not a threat to us as people from our plane might normally consider mindflayers to be - no offence..." - he responds, "There has been a tragedy here. The game is afoot!" - in her mind - "My name is Ignatious Inkblot. I am a renowned investigator across the planes and solver of mysteries." Oswen says out loud, "Please to meet you Mr Inkblot, our goals may be aligned, for we seek a shapeshifter who stole something of great value and escaped on this train, we don't know if that's your murderer but it could be - there is certainly much afoot - that is why were scanning minds for thoughts." "Ah! Understood!"

"Can we be permitted to continue our search?" asks Oswen "For after all, we were in the car with you when this happened and perhaps we'll detect something that helps?"

"We don't know how long ago this happened - in between him leaving the entertainment car and him screaming. And nobody else entered or left."

"So whoever it is, they're further to the rear. We'll keep searching. I guess we want to keep this quiet if we can! Don't want a panic on our hands!"

We come to a deal - we'll help each other. He says "We need to get everyone from 6, 7 and 8 to gather in 6 so I can question them."

"OK. And don't forget, the changeling might be convincing but their emotions probably match their words."

Modrons are instructed so we're allowed through to 8. Here in 7, Bel takes a head count via the helm. Only four people. Quick check...

* The Azer (flaming hair) - genuinely freaked out. **Inconclusive.**
* End cabin - a Cambian - yikes - the modron valet from before is there - thinking this is all a waste of time. Wonders how "Ethelyn" is doing. The Azer perhaps? **Animosity towards the dead person though**. Fairly confident is not the changeling. He seemed to like the drow.
* Middle cabin - female drow - "I wonder if I can take the rest of his maps now? We're being corralled into one room. I should've taken them when I had the chance." **Might be the killer but seems a bit unlikely**
* The valet seems genuinely concerned about the passenger. But "no matter what they ask I will get in trouble... I must obey my programming..." - and based on that Bel delays further to scan the two guards; they seem worried about the paperwork and no longer being trusted. OK, well, all just generally anxious.

We move onto 8 to round up people. We walk to the far end first, to sweep backwards. Only three people here.

* Cabin C - a small, well-dressed gnome. Not the shapeshifter. But for the investigation, thoughts are scanned; anger. Huffy! "Surely they do not have authority to pull me from my room" - etc.

So we knock on the door to very politely ask him to move to car 6, on the basis of those thoughts - invasion of privacy but we're worried about safety. The persuasion roll is low but a high modifier means that they comply, but unhappily!

* Cabin B - worries, something sounds very wrong, guards wouldn't lock the cabin down otherwise; wonder if they can help...

We knock; a glowing countenance figuring slightly off the ground with wings made of light. They're happy to move to car 6 and even offer to "raise them" - bring the murdered back! We say they should ask the investigator.

* Cabin A - last one - very dark thoughts. Murderous intent! That seems a bit obvious but Bel looks quite shocked and takes a step backwards and whispers, "Well, that seems like the one, but it's almost too easy... Be very careful..."

Knock... Door opens... A short, wide, almost dwarf-height human, a cleric, male. Very ornate priestly garments.  While Oswen is doing the usual "I'm terribly sorry" routine, Bel digs deeper and succeeds - and hears - "Just my luck! It's them! Oh, wait, what's this. Someone is reading..." and Bel shouts, "WATCH OUT! MIGHT BE THEM!" - and Bel hears, "Dammit, why isn't it working!" and so Bel calls out, "He's trying to use something to escape or attack but it's not working!"

Oswen says, surprisingly calmly at the guy - "You can't attack. We're in Elysium."

Visible rage. The face starts to almost bubble. The form shifts. And soon we're looking at a demonic, grey slaad. So now we don't know if this *is* a slaad, since they can change form, or a changeling looking like one! Bel says to Oswen, "Ask why he knew us". Oswen does so and Bel pushes deeper with the spell. The answer Oswen hears isn't the same as Bel hears. "Because you are the one that Vrakir told me to hunt down. I will claim your heads and be elevated among the ranks of slaad - given a brood to lay my eggs!"

Bel steps back again - "Oh, this is our history - he's been sent by Vrakir!"

Oswen asks, "Did you kill the guy in car 7" - but the slaad makes his save and we don't get an answer telepathically. But the response is somehow puzzled. He says, "No, I'm only here to kill YOU" and spits acid - but it just dribbles down their face.

While we are in this temporary stand-off, Inafina runs to fetch a guard. She points and says, "As you can see this passenger is not who they claimed to be. You have a stowaway!" - but the modrons don't care, they've got a ticket!

Oswen says, "Well, they've stated they claim to kill us. How long does the train stay in the plane of Elysium before exiting to the next?" "Around 10-12 minutes to the station, 5 minutes there, 40 minutes more... But we might not be allowed to leave until the crime is solved. Unless we don't stop there."

Tricky. "We all have to come to car 6, either way!" declares Oswen. And so, this very curious group move through and find Ignatious holding court.

In the course of things, we are appointed lieutenants to search rooms... But first the deva (luminous one) has raises a hand and asked if they could just raise the individual. Yes, that's an option! And so Ignatious agrees. The person is raised, but is confused with no memory of what might've happened. Oswen investigates (28!), and finds evidence of 3 magic missile impacts and, coupled with where the body was and how it was laying - it points to anyone from Cabin B car 7, through to car 8.

* We check 7B - dirty 30 investigation - it was shared with the Drow and victim.
    - Victim: A beautiful ornate leather satchel with a formal and an informal set of clothes, cartographers tools and 3 map cases filled with half a dozen ancient-looking treasure maps.
    - Drow: Spellbook; a spare, it would never be left behind; Oswen finds Magic Missile in there. Some spider silk gowns. Writings about how to find Time Dragons. And a poison dagger! Oh... Crumpled up, as if taken hastily, is a map - stuffed into the pocket of one of the spider silk gowns.
    - It's a fake! It purports to show the location of a Time Dragon's lair. Same style as the others.
    - Implies the Drow doesn't know they a fake, so if she did kill, it was to steal what she thought was the real thing.

* We check 7C - 18 investigation.
    - A suitcase on a writing desk and a doctor's bag on the bed.
    - In the bag is a cloak, and two travellers' outfits, scorched leather armour pieces (scorched because a Cambian wore them), a potion probably of healing
    - In the suitcase is a collection of a dozen or so odd-looking compasses, which all point in different directions as well as a set of tinker's tool and a book in a strange language. Fast-cast Comprehend Languages ritual via spellbook. It's written in modron! It's a book about the deep logic on modron programming. She says that, in confusion to the group and Bel picks up on the "programming" bit and we think it definitely curious that this is here.
    - Some spare bits of cogs and metal plates and screws lying on the table.

* We're all interested in 8A! 25 investigation, with help.
    - A description and bad drawing of the four of us!
    - Instructions in Infernal but Comprehend Languages is still up; instructions from Vrakir; "I compel you to hunt down and kill these four. If you return having failed me, I will destroy your control gem". We don't know what a "control gem" is! "My agents tell me they are in Trade Gate. Find them and kill them. Bring me their heads and I will return your control gem to you."
    - A small jar with frozen slaad tadpoles. A brood, probably. Perhaps for what's left of us after we've had our heads cut off. Inafina says, "Why is it always tadpoles?!"

We return. Back in 6, accusations are flying in all directions. Some fingers do point at the deva too - a good disguise!

The guards are asked. Nobody moved between cars 7 and 8 in a relevant timescale, so that points to the Cambian and the Drow. So, Bel puts a superficial thought detection on the Cambian and says to him - "It's no good. The game is up!" and gets back a "No, you're bluffing! It's perfect. There's no way he can find any evidence!" and Bel looks to Oswen and says, "Whatever he did it's not nothing, because what I said rattled him but he thinks he performed a perfect crime. It doesn't mean it's the murder, though."

With nothing to lose and emboldened by Elysium's apparently very effective protection, Bel decides to push deeper. WIS16, the Cambian knows there's someone "looking"; Bel knows the name, Abernathy Vernus or Verne for short - "Where's the evidence hidden, Verne?" - "Higglesworth" but the answer is "What *are* you on about" so Bel turns to Ignatious and says, "Higglesworth. Ring any bells?"

The valet raises its arm. "I am Higglesworth!". Oswen is not permitted to inspect him. He refuses. At this Bel goes, "Ah! That's what he meant by obeying his programming. This Cambian has some sort of hold over him." He says to the guards, "In 7C there's a book about modron programming, along with some mechanical parts. I think poor Higglesworth may be a victim himself!"

The guards approach Higglesworth and say, "Stand down and let us inspect you". But Higglesworth doubles down. "If you try I must defend myself!"

Oswen tries, "Higglesworth, we realise you are worried and must follow your programming. Are you able to tell us what that programming is?"

"Yes. Would you like to know my original programming or my original programming. There are two protocols that apply here."

"How about we start with original?"

"I must look after the guests in car and do everything which they ask. As part of my hospitality training, I must never cast aspersions, incriminate, or harm the reputations of any of the guests."

"Thank you. And what about the new?"

"It is in two parts. I must obey the instructions of Verne" (at whom he points) "and to defend myself if anyone tries and inspect me or open of my compartments. I cannot lie about anything."

"Please tell me what objects, if any, Verne put inside your compartments."

"I cannot answer that. I cannot incriminate any of the guests."

"I'm sorry, yes, of course, your old programming still applies".

That in itself is incriminating. But Verne says, "Ask him! Ask him if I killed Quintus!"

Oswen says, "Well of course not, that was her" - and points at the Drow, with of course a flurry of denials arising - and says to Higglesworth, "Did you see Verne killing Quintus?"

"No. I did not see Verne killing Quintus".

"Did Verne leave your sight from two minutes before we entered Elysium until we came knocking on the door?"

"Yes, he was in his room, I left his room."

"Did you kill Quintus?"

"Yes!"

Oswen says "The programming from Verne might have included saying just that - it avoids incriminating a guest, and it follows instructions, but it would be a lie. Higglesworth, is there any conflict between the answer you just gave and your programming?" "No. I did not harm the reputation of Quintus nor incriminate him. I merely fired the wand."

Oswen nods and looks to the Drow, "I can't ever be completely sure but I am confident I owe you an apology. Mr Inkblot, given the things you have heard, is that sufficient to realise that Verne here reprogrammed Higglesworth and performed essentially a tool?"

Ignatious thinks it won't stand in court! "The devil is in the details! We are missing the murder weapon and we are missing a motive." Also we haven't proved that Verne changed Higglesworth's programming, but again when we ask about it, Higglesworth cannot answer for implication of a guest. And when Oswen asks if *she* did it, the answer is a definitive "No".

The debate continues but then there's an announcement - stopping in Elysium in 5 minutes. We ask Inkblot if there's any way to avoid stopping for fear that a perpetrator might escape. He goes off to try.

While Inkblot does that, we ask Verne if he knows Quintus. Quintus recognises him from perhaps a prior meeting. Not wanting to "out" him in front of the Drow for fear of another murder attempt, Oswen asks Verne to step out onto the balcony and, out of earshot, get into it. Verne and Quintus *do* know each other - sort of competitors. Verne makes compasses "attuned to your heart's desire" while Quintus specialises in maps and the 'conference' was for people of unique talents. It seems that they were both trying to get to Ethlynn's cabin (the Drow) and Quintus happened to make it there first. "But that... There's a gentleman's agreement that rivalry and competition should always stay healthy! We respect each other's skills. He has broken that if he did indeed kill me, which he didn't, obviously, the modron did..."

We explain that Verne seemed to like Ethlynn, which would explain even more the rules being broken.

Ignatious returns. We have about half an hour and we'll leave Elysium and will stop there, since he's convinced the conductor not to stop here. We initially want to try and keep all this information quiet, but realise we're being drawn in too deep. The three of them aren't exactly upstanding characters in any way. And Kindle isn't happy keeping it quiet. Inevitably, then, there is a confrontation - Ethlynn is "shocked" that Quintus' maps were bogus, and that Verne's compasses wouldn't lead her to a Time Dragon either; Quintus won out by simply being more charming; she is just a scholar, apparently, who wants to research them! Well, books and covers, I guess. "It's the last time I trust anyone!" she exclaims.

"Is that enough?!" we ask Ignatious. "Just the missing piece - the wand!"

We go to Verne's cabin and bring the book and spare parts to show the guards. They confirm that the book would let someone do what we suggest, but we'd need to incapacitate Higglesworth to undo the changes if he refused to let us otherwise. Else he'd have to be returned to **Mechanus** to be reset to core programming, and that would take a while.

At this, Ignatious now asks that we *do* stop in Elysium - because he thinks there's enough evidence to unload both Verne and Quintus, Higglesworth stays on board to get take to Mechanus; "Higglesworth - " says Quintus - "- is there a wand of Magic Missiles in a compartment somewhere and is that the one you used to strike Quintus?" "Yes, yes." "Did you put that wand back in yourself?" "No" "Can you tell me who did?" "No" "But can you give me that wand?" "Yes!" and Higglesworth reaches to rip off a metal plate and gives the wand over!

So, at the station, the train stops and the two are removed.

The guards are also instructed to keep an eye on the slaad, claiming he has more questions. He's a guest - once the train moves they must let him return to his room... Ignatious gets back and explains. And he can attack us as soon as we attack him and we can defend ourselves. We just have to make sure nobody else is hurt. And we must let him strike first. Guards will be nearby to observe and witness.

Ignatious asks how he can help, and we explain about our thief. We come up with the idea of asking the Deva to help - they are called **Omid**. We can't be *wildly* convincing - the story has omissions because of Golden Vault secrecy and so-forth. Omid says they "cannot mete out justice" (not that we're asking for such a thing) but they believe our story and "I am permitted to right that wrong" as far as the theft goes.

This conversation, at the room in 8B, means we need to "walk and chat" through 9, 10, 11 and the boarding car, but obviously the prison car is closed to us.

The four of us will go with the Deva but Lili excuses herself - we've been lucky so far she hasn't been spotted. We don't know if the changeling can see through the Hat Of Disguise like the deva can...

We head out, making smalltalk as we wander intentionally slowly into car 9. The dining car. Layout is quite different; lots of dining seats and booths. Drinks are in small tin cups on the whole. Food seems to be sandwiches and what seem to be strange, hot, cut sticks of potato with sauce on. A modron seems to retrieve food from a dispensing area. It's busy, with 20-something people here. We're looked at with suspicion for obvious reasons so Oswen makes a show of getting some of the potato sticks to try out. It gives Omid time to look around.

The sticks arrive in a cardboard cone, with a meaty sauce poured on top. Oswen offers it around. As we get through to the end, Omid shakes her head; we step out into the windy area between cars and into car 10.

It's almost full - there must be some 40 people here, sat in two rows, two seats on one side and 3 on the other with a 5ft wide central aisle. Barely 3ft wide seats - cramped! - at least there's space for luggage at one end, all piled high in open-sided compartments. Of course we have to slow right down to be able to look at anyone. It's noisy with all the talk. A few watch us closely, most ignore. Oswen can't see much so she asks Orvil to perch on Kindle's shoulder, holds Kindle's hand and looks through Orvil. The deva is a distance ahead. Inafina tries to keep an eye out for anyone looking shady, but it's noisy and crowded, and smelly; her keener senses are overwhelmed somewhat and she can't really focus on anything (perception nat 1 + 7).

At the end - nothing. Omid looks a bit concerned, but says they're OK to keep going. Outside, there are people smoking on the balcony, or skullduggery, or whatever! They go silent when we step out. 

Car 11. There's a queue of people next to lavatories! Bel has to use the helm to scan inside them (!) since he doesn't have much choice, despite the invasion; in one, someone very relieved, and in the other someone very stressed. Money, work, life in general... This reminds him... There *were* a few "maybes" in the earlier cars. But now, with Omid, we're almost sure we're not missing anyone and if we find nothing, those "maybes" could warrant a closer look.

Some 30-odd other people. Inafina this time gets more into it. Dirty 20 perception. The same kind of thing as before, except 2 people completely avoid eye contact. Inafina works that into the smalltalk - "...I mean, take those two people there for example, they don't look so happy..."

We get to the end. Inafina's behind Omid, who whispers. Those two people are *definitely* not what they appear to be. But these aren't changelings - could be demons of some kind!

Up to no good, says Omid; for sure, but we have to leave it for now. As Omid themselves says - "The risk of collateral damage is too great".

Another caboose is car 11, since 12 is the prison car. This one is busy again, 30 people or more and very messy. Boxes stacked up, a large contraption of goodness-knows-what purpose that someone must own and a small area with a modron behind a small counter, almost as if another ticket office. There's an area for oversized luggage items too (that the contraption didn't even fit in).

This seems to be for people who can't even afford a seat. Oswen says, "there, see, I wonder what that is?" as if that's why we came here, and we use that as an excuse to wander slowly over. Inafina perception 21, actually gets into examining it; a vehicle of some kind, but with nozzles, and it seems some drip a bit of - well, acid?! The whole thing is quite steamy and warm. It's very odd. Oswen wonders if this might be some kind of getaway ruse; arcana 18+13->31 (!) - well it's a machine, definitely a vehicle, that sprays acid as Inafina thought. A driver sits in a cab but it's small, not even gnome or goblin size. And then she sees - creatures, inside, hiding! Stowaways! Elementals; fire mephits? She gestures to Bel to check with the helm.

6 mephits, hiding! They're worried - they don't want to be spotted. "I can't go back to prison again!"

Another one for the back burner, no pun intended. We know they're here now. And if 6 fire mephits try to run wild - wow. Bel indicates to Oswen and Oswen laughs, and calls up softly, "Your secret's safe with us". A tiny smoke ring, shaped like a little heart, floats out!

Our presence here causes frustration, but we keep up our ruse. Omid works through the crowd, very worried, shakes their head. "I'm sorry! No... Are you sure you don't want to just walk to the front?!"

Given they've offered, we agree and head back. Kindle wants more potato sticks on the way through. Inafina perception 21, all the way. As we turn, Omid ends up at the back because it's so cramped. But as we start through, Inafina notices that the two demons are gone. She motions to Oswen at the empty seats and Omid notices too. We might not be able to ignore that, then! "Keep your eyes peeled!" says Oswen. And through the crowded cars, Inafina sees two people - mostly identified by familiar hats - a car's length ahead. They're getting away from us. Inafina decides not to wait; she tries to wave through people, ACRO 19, she's some 30ft away from them as the reach the end of car 9. They step outside, their hats blow away and she sees what look like a husband and wife, very well appointed and well kept - elven - open the door. She waits for the rest of us - "Definitely up to no good! They've taken the appearance of husband and wife, elven, well appointed, to fit into first class" - we give chase as best we can, but ask Omid to keep looking for our shapeshifter on condition that we'll keep on the demons. In car 8, Omid therefore falls behind a bit.

Unfortunately while Bel is graceful in pursuit the rest of us get overenthusiastic and actually start to half run. It's particularly obvious with Kindle thumping behind - but even more so as Inafina is staring right at them and once they've reached the end of car 8 and turn to close the door behind them they see us immediately and run for it!

Inafina feels she must try and stop *one* of them in car 7, since that's relatively quiet now, so she picks up to full speed. Calls out behind her, "Gonna try to grab one!" - jumps clear across 8 to 7 and tackles the "wife". She grabs and pins down the lady. The "husband" shrieks. The azer opens the door and screams, "Not again! What's going on!" and Inafina calls up, "They're demons in disguise, you shouldn't worry, please go back into your room!"

The rest of us arrive and the "husband" is being very agro of course. Bel puts the helm onto the protesting husband, since those protests ought to help bring real thoughts to the fore. Oh. He's actually truly concerned! What? And the woman, too. Bel is alarmed and actually calls out, "Sorry, but I have to know..." and pushes deeper on the guy, but WIS 16 - saved, Bel gets nothing. Bel says, "I can't find out more but they *seem* genuinely concerned about each other!"

"Of *course* we are! We're bloodsworn!"

"But why are you in disguise? And why did you run?"

"Would you rather we walk around like _this_ in first class?!" - and just like that, they've changed. The woman is a greyish green, very folded skin, bipedal - almost slug-like - with small hanging arms and four large jagged hooks on the end. No apparent mouth or eyes, just, uuuh, pustules... The "man" looks rather like a large lobster, but with - well, there's no nice way to say it - putrid, wet look to the skin, almost rotted, but amour platings on top and six legs.

"Well I take your point" says Oswen at *that* "but why did you move seats?"

It turns out they had been waiting for a first class cabin and one had become free!

Lots of apologies are due... Omid joins in when she catches up and hears what happened. How embarrassing. Better safe than sorry - maybe?!

We walk all the way back, all the way to the cabin our own room is in. It takes the better part of ten minutes. We get to Lili - but, _**nothing**_.

Well, it seems our changeling is not in any of the cars. They could be a modron. Or what about the prison car? Oswen thanks Omid - we hope they can enjoy the rest of their trip!

At that moment, an announcement. We pass into Ysgard in 15 minutes. OK, so 15 minutes until the slaad can attack. A lot going on. We fill in Ignatious. Does he happen to have the pulling power to get us a look into the prison car? Well, he might be able to find out *something*, so he goes off to check. We head back too and wait around in car 9, so Kindle can have his potato sticks.

While he eats, we discuss what to do about the slaad. The problem is, *where* to fight. There are people packed in everywhere and they'll get hurt. Oswen suggest we could try something a bit high risk... Banishment. We could get to his cabin, try to stop him getting out - Kindle can use his mass for a start! - and then Oswen gives it a try and keeps hidden for a minute! High risk but our best bet of resolving things quickly.

Once we hear the announcement that we're soon to enter Ysgard ("if you look out the windows, you will see the Valkyries and spirits of Valhalla") and with no sign of Ignatious yet, we return to 8A where the slaad is holed up and wait outside (!) ready to pounce. On the way Bel uses his bandore to cast Protection from Evil & Good on Oswen. Kindle tries to sort of block the door and Oswen can see through his legs for a line of sight on the spell.

Nervous waiting!

Suddenly there's a sense of glory replacing the pacifying feeling. Euphoria, elation, conquest; Inafina, energised, looks out of the window instead of kicking in the door! Spirits, riding giant spirit elk, horses and more, a sort of huge scene - an army running to war - yet all spirits. Given Inafina is distracted, Kindle has to kick in the door! Easy (nat 19 on high STR).

The "cleric" is ready! They are just finishing grabbing 2 battleaxes and is about to charge. No surprises here!

Initiative:

* Inafina 25
* Kindle 23
* Bel 22
* Oswen 11 (even after burning inspo)

...at which Inafina yelps a battle cry (!) - definitely not her usual chill monk self! - and leaps into the room, brandishing the staff, but swings rather wild; it bounces off the carapace hidden behind the cleric illusion; the second hits. Lightning (d8->4) seems to have lesser effect, but 14 damage from the strike; Stunning Strike, DC15+2 (17) (due to dragonhide belt); failed. It's stunned! What's more, it looks *very* surprised. Since he's stunned, she jumps back out of the room to avoid blocking the room and line of sight for Oswen's spell.

Kindle attacks. He's feeling the effects of this plane too! With a great roar, quite frightening even for those that know him, he swings down his mace - **NAT 20**. 1d6, plus a Surprise Attack feature, for 2d6 more; but that's doubled, so 6d6+3. 10 for the mace, 20 for the surprise; 30 damage total. Wow. He channels his divine strike too, for 1d8 extra - crit doubling to 2d8 - the rest of us have never seen anything like it - 9 more damage. 39, in one hit.

Bel grants Bardic Inspiration to Oswen calling out, "Get it done!" and looking around Kindle and over Oswen, fires his crossbow but it goes wide; the line of sight is too heavily obscured.

The slaad is stunned and really can't do much. In her own way, Inafina was a scary as Kindle as we see the impact she had as the slaad tries to do _something_ - it's almost pitiful.

Oswen casts Banishment. It's an aberration, likely to resist magic well; but she tries her best. CHA 18 - and it's doing a +4, ADV roll. The spell lands but just sort of "slides" off - curiously, taking the shapeshift with it. "Rats!" she shouts, "Sorry Bel! I have to try again! Keep him in the room!"

There's commotion outside which helps hide our noise; the spirits of Ysgard are very loud.

Inafina gets a hit with the staff, max 14 damage again, DC 17 CON save but it makes it and isn't stunned. She calls a warning that it's shaken off the effect and swipes again. Hits, 13 more damage; flurry of blows; two more hits for 12 and 8 points. She's not able to disengage though and has to stay in range.

Kindle channels his divine spark; divine energy gathers visibly around, channelling through and slamming into the slaad. It makes its CON save but takes half 2d8+4 radiant damage - 7. Not what he really hoped for, but it's still something.

Bel tries casting Command. The command is: "Halt!"; ADV WIS save; and this time, he fails despite advantage. WIS might be a weak point? Additionally Bel does something we've not seen before - he weaves strands of fey magic that look almost like a stream of flower petals, which is strangely beguiling, encircle the slaad and try to charm it. Another WIS save - but this time it resists.

The slaad considers escaping, but it has been commanded to halt. It just looks around, angrily - and seems to heal a little, worryingly. Oswen calls out, "This doesn't have a high chance of success but I'll keep at it" (and then looks at the slaad and calls out) "Unless you'd prefer to be killed instead of sent home, of course!" - Intimidation 12 plus Bardic 5 - and casts Banishment again. This time, it thinks for a minute, then says:

**"As long as Vrakir has my control gem, I'll have no choice but to hunt you down again"**

...then just vanishes. Oswen gets into the room and says, "Wow, lucky! But I've got to keep focused for a full minute..."

...and at that point Ignatious turns up and is hurriedly shushed by Kindle! It's funny how long a minute can be when you're stood in silence, but that said, it's plenty noisy outside.

A minute goes by and Oswen thanks Bel, whose inspiration helped her think of that little intimidation attempt. We discuss what it means; perhaps we have to confront Vrakir head-on, but it's the Arcanaloth we're really worried about.

Ignatious learned a few things by speaking and listening to thoughts. "The challenge will be _getting into_ the prison car; you'll have to convince the guards but there is a jailor, an overseer, in charge. A deva, apparently by the name of *Rema* - but that means they'd have *seen* a shapeshifter. That could be helpful as we could just ask them, in that case!

"So, what clues do you have?" he asks, in a curious tone. Oswen methodically reviews what we know; then he says, "So why did you ask me to go to the jail car?" - almost with a wink. He chuckles and wishes us well with our puzzle! Inafina insight 26, gets the inkling that he's kind of hinting that *we* should go there. It seems he thinks we might already have all the clues we need.

If Rema can see shapeshifters, then unless one of the prisoners was already meant to be such, surely Rema would've spotted the deception. So maybe the shapeshifter can impersonate a Deva? We didn't think that was possible; could our shapeshifter have met this jailer and replaced them? Wouldn't that make them very powerful? Maybe not, but it just seems unlikely. And at the same time, it's kind of the only option possible. Ignatious is leaving as we're talking about this, but is listening. He mentions that Rema the jailer is *in the car* with the prisoners, not outside. So that leans into our earliest thoughts of perhaps replacing a prisoner - but with the added benefit of not being in prison. And the car is isolated; no people allowed inside.

We need a plan to get in there. We head to find Lili and let her know what our theory is, so we do that first, heading back to our cabin and bringing her up to speed. Ignatious has tagged along, apparently intrigued at what we'll do next - now that we've figured out what *he* figured out a while ago!

Our issue is - how do we get inside? The modrons are, Ignatious tells us, *not* in charge of the prison car. The modrons on the roof are apparently just standard procedure, to make sure passengers don't try to do anything silly!

We need to find a way in. We hope that the shapeshifer doesn't know the normal routine on board and come up with a convincing-sounding ruse to be allowed in. A half-way inspection? But we don't know when "half way" is for the jailed people. The whole journey is about 48h. We decide to head to the rear cart before the jail cart; that's where the conductor was, at that little desk by the "contraption" where the fire mephits are hiding. It takes us a few minutes. Interestingly, each car now feels different. Just like us really, each car is more... Boisterous. The effects of this plane. Both aggression and cheer!

Standing room only at the rear car, as usual. The group hangs back and Oswen winds her way between legs - after whispering to the mephits in The Contraption, which is now even more smoky than usual, warning them of Ysgard's effects. "Keep lying low!" - steam rises. Someone argues with the conductor at the back; Oswen watches; the conductor is level-headed. As she suspected, they aren't affected by the planes.

Once it's her turn, a bit of smalltalk; she learns that the next plane - in 29 minutes - will be Asheron. Another battlefield! Similar moods, unfortunately, but a different "feel" - pain and suffering (when one creature deals damage to another, both take equal psychic damage). Yikes! The modrons *are* affected somewhat, but they know how to avoid much of the effects from each plane. She tries to convince the conductor that she's a bit uneasy about the prisoners; when do they disembark? She words it clumsily and might have given herself away, except Bel arrives in the nick of time and joins the convo, leading to Nat 20 + 4 -> 24 deception.

* Jailer *and guards* are inside, more than equipped to deal with anything!
* If it *did* spread beyond, the onboard Modron security is more than enough.
* The prisoners are to be taken to Fields of Torment, the prison on Asheron. That's our next plane; we don't stop in Ysgard as nobody wanted a stop there; it's about 42 minutes until that next stop.

Inafina meanwhile witnesses an altercation which leads to violence. One person stabs another and they fall, nasty injury, should've killed them. Yet the bounce right back - they stand, say "well played!" - the two clap each other on the back. Inafina approaches; "Goodness, that looked like a terrible wound?!" "Well, you're in Ysgard! A good place to air grievances!" "Is it impossible to *die* here?" "My! Is it your first time in Ysgard? Yes! It's an effect of this plane - a Hall of Valhalla - where the Valkyries fly and the glorious battles of the ages play out. Nothing can ever truly die here. The stories live on forever."

We regroup at the forward door, where Kindle and Lili have waited. We discuss *many* options for plans. Bel even tries to Dimension with Door Oswen and himself into the car, saying, "and teleporting isn't even allowed" thinking it'll fail - **and it works**! Horrified, Inafina immediately starts running and pushing her way through to the far end door with Kindle and Lili in hot pursuit.

Inside the jail car, a very surprised Oswen and Bel suddenly appear. We exchange glances - it worked?! - and we see what look like some kind of spirit guardian. They have the long robe-cloak of the Harmonium along with armour and wield flanged maces. Oswen, perception 19+1->20. A dimly lit, smokey car, shafts of light coming down from a narrow window strip along the roof. Jail cells are either side. It's two storey! The jail cells are tall and narrow, going up two storeys; essentially there's a mezzanine walkway, and we're below that.

The guards is positioned by a staircase, halfway along the length of the car. We *don't* see the Deva but we see the three occupied cells vs the empty. Luck roll D20 -> 15. Oswen, WIS save; nat 20 again! 25. The staircase guard is walking up. Oswen has the presence of mind to control her surprise and quickly puts her hand over the mouth of the astonished Bel's mouth!

At least two pairs of eyes are on us - from inside the cells. The cells are made of open bars. Behind the locked doors, what she sees is impossible - there must be a dimension shift or some kind of other plane, yet she can see right into it - the cells are far bigger than they could possibly be for the width of the car. She estimates the central walkway to be a generous 10ft wide, which should leave only 5ft for the cells but they must be at least 15-20ft.

We withdraw to the end of the car. One cell has a human in a wide-brimmed hat, hiding their eyes, sat on a stool with arms crossed. One is a nycaloth, Oswen thinks - she's only ever read about them - huge, some kind of fiend. All spikes and scales and armoured shell plates. The third has run to its cell door and looks like it wants to talk - Bel shows a "shush" sign! - looks very familiar, and Erinyes. A fallen angel. Very crazy eyes!

Strange shackles hold them in place. They look disconnected from our plane - multidimensional shackles?!

The fallen angel beckons us over. Oswen casts Intellect Fortress on Bel as a precaution; we move over. It whispers. It wants out! "Let me go and I will owe you a boon!" - Oswen history 12; well they're devils and lawful... Who knows! Could they help us get Vrakir off our backs?! Then she remembers what Kindle would say. We should not do deals with the devil! She nods, in a non-committal way and we withdraw once again.

The Erinyes is trying to whisper about guards and keys (that look like stones) and more. Oswen looks at the door we're near, which looks totally normal. That seems unlikely; if cells are locked only with a "stone" (key) held by the guards, it's likely that the prison car is similarly secured.

We might already be criminals after freeing Vrakir's slaves. She's in no mood to make things worse. She calls out loudly, "GUARDS! YOU HAVE A SECURITY BREACH!" - the Erinyes is enraged. The human shakes his head, slowly!

A shout from above. "Enough with those tricks -" footsteps on stairs - but then they see us!

We try to persuade them that their jailer is a shapeshifter! But of course we have no evidence. We're starting to back away; these people are marching with weapons drawn.

Oswen says, "Surely the very fact that we're here, that I called out to you knowingly, and that we have such a strange story, gives some pause for thought? We could have sneaked around, but instead we make our presence known and put ourselves at risk of attack."

The two guards ignore this and try to grab us. We don't resist that. The deva says "Throw them out immediately!" and Bel says, "Don't believe her and don't trust her. The only reason we came in here was to unmask her. We can prove it, if you'll give us a chance". They completely ignore everything we say.

We're taken to the door; it's unlocked - sigils are drawn to do that - and one of them marches us back into the caboose. "These two were caught breaking into the prison car" says the guard to a Modron. "Please do not let this happen again." At this, more guards are called. They escort us all the way back to our cabin. The Modrons insist that nobody is allowed inside the car, and we've broken terms of carriage in so doing! We use Sending for Ignatious; he's able to pull rank - but we're on thin ice. *ANY* things go bad and we'll be thrown off at the next stop.

We're stuck. Ignatious says he'll come up with a plan - we certainly out of ideas. But Ignatious tell us - after much discussion:

* A deva definitely has truesight. If we can prove that this is missing, we prove the jailor is a fraud.
* It must be done innately - quickly - no time for conversation.
* But Oswen doesn't have Polymorph and Bel doesn't even have Disguise Self without his hat.
* We have ideas about another Dimension Door into the car, illusory appearance as e.g. Lili or Bel, but it just doesn't work with the magic available
* Ignatious solves it; the two demons we met - they actually shapeshift (but we'll have to sweet-talk them!) - two of them both as Bel and Lili as Bel
* Approach the jail car; convince the guards that we need to know who is who - Ignatious will march them over - the rest of us must hide. We choose Bel as he's already been a troublemaker!
* The jail cart guards and the shapeshifter (probably) *don't know* there's a passenger deva on board
* So march them over, get the jailor deva to help
* And they cannot, as they're fake.

Bel will make *all four* of our party invisible so we can get close by, to assist if things go bad. We would be stationed as close as possible at the exit door to the car... But we also have to convince, says Ignatious, the two guards and fake Deva to come out into the caboose, so that if it gets violent, crimes are happening in the train car, within the modron jurisdiction.

The accusation needs then to be something criminal; e.g. accuse the shapeshifter must have replaced the deva, since the guards expected a deva, so high chance of violence - all it needs is the accusation and the modron would be forced to act.

This hinges on us being able to sweet-talk the shapeshifting demons. Bel says to Oswen, "While this is happening, you and I need to sneak into the jail car and find Lili's object! Or how would we justify searching the shapeshifter to get it, otherwise?" - well, we're invisible; we can try and sneak. If all else fails, Lili will fall back to accusations of theft.

Let's go talk to the demons. At the door - a hesitation. A sigh. Bel knocks - asking Inafina to step out of view first! A click of a lock. The door slides open.

The male demon, in their true form, regards us. "Can I help y - wait - Oh no, no no no!"

Bel produces one of his best bottles of wine and holds it out. "We wanted to apologise. Properly." He launches into a detailed apology. 19+12 -> 31 persuasion. He's doing well! The shift from apology to "and actually yes this is really a bribe because we need your help" is tricky, but deftly handled.

It's agreed. It helps, too, that Lili - who wants back her stolen item - is invested enough to be one of the people in disguise alongside them.

"So, Ignatious - I guess it's up to you to draw the three of them out of the jail car?" we ask. "Let's do it!"

Before Bel makes us invisible, he grants Bardic inspiration to all four of us and Ignatious. Then - pop, we're gone. Ignatious marches the Three Bels (new tavern name?!) - to the caboose. "Guards! Conductor! Guards!" he cries out - and launches into a reason why we must have the deva from the prison car to identify the "real person" in his lineup. "I'm meant to be keeping an eye on this one; but I went to the bathroom, came back and there were three of them!"

A modron knocks on the jail car door. A guard opens, annoyed. The persuasion there helps because Bel is one of the "troublemakers" from earlier - and the guard can plainly see *three* of them!

So that works - the guards call down Rema. It takes them some effort to persuade her. Rema comes into the caboose with *one* guard. One remains in the jail car. Bel and Oswen try to immediately sneak in, but even with  advantage and bardic - Oswen only gets 10! Well, there's a guard still *right there*. As we sneak in - on the way to the stairs - and it's the Erinyes who gives us away. Of course! They have True Sight! They start whispering and pointing at the guard, "he's got the key! He's got the key!" - Oswen Arcana 28. **Of course. True sight.** The Erinyes - *they knew all along* that the deva wasn't a deva. But for whatever reason, they kept it quiet.

Suddenly there's a kerfuffle from the caboose, but we press on. Oswen investigation 1,17 + 13 -> 30! She almost misses it because it's hidden in plain sight. A traveller's backpack. Totally out of place for a deva! It leans at the far end of the mezzanine, next to a stool. It clearly has a box inside. No traps. As she moves towards it, she sees a strange item *floating* in one of the jail cells - that's otherwise empty. A twinkling. Semi-invisible, hidden. Orvil can't fly in - he can't go through the bars; an invisible barrier; ah, yes. It's some kind of multi-planar thing. Get the box first! Arcane wards of warning on all sides - so that goes into *her* backpack. As for the other backpack, it looks like it has personal effects. A notebook, a few other personal thing. Nothing obviously out of place, but a disguise kit is an odd one for a shapeshifter. She takes it to bring to the caboose.

Next, at that strange object - she tries to push her staff between bars; it has resistance but it's doable. If she taps the object it moves. What's left is a rod. Unusual. All kinds of writing, an unknown script, nothing she's ever seen. Arcana only 17. Clearly magical! Used to contact someone? Hidden here? Hidden by - the shapeshifter? She asks Bel if he can see it; he can; she gives him the staff but instead he draws his rapier. Via SOH finesse, he manages to flip and spin it over and over until it is at the bars. Oswen then can just about pull the rod out through the bars. That goes into her backpack too.

Bail! But the Erinyes tries to get our attention and Oswen whispers, "I'm sorry. Maybe we really could use your help. But we just can't risk having the Harmonium on our backs on top of anyone else."

"I don't belong in here! I don't! I don't!"

"What did you do? What did they *think* you do?"

"Well I did - I mean I was caught - I did have it - but I didn't take it - a mission to defeat a big red dragon... Thought it was just a dragon slaying... I'm always up for that!... I've been accused of stealing and hiding a book, very important, and I didn't - I don't know what happened - next thing I knew I was arrested; I must've been knocked out at the lair? Everyone was gone when I came to but I was surrounded by Harmonium. Accused of conspiracy."

"What did it look like?"

"A very evil book - of vile evil, or thoughts of vile evil, or something? An artefact?"

That's the book *we* took. Oswen can't hide the recognition in her face.

"You - you know of this book? You have to help me! I've done bad things! But of this I am innocent!"

Oswen says, "I'll try. Be patient."

Back in the caboose, modrons have used a Cube Of Force - we'd never have been able to run from them! - as the deva, now partially back to their true form, half-way, grotesque - is yelling, but we can't hear them. The two demons are - well, something else, passengers and Lili is Lili. Ignatious is mid-diatribe with his pipe. The guard looks confused. Oswen makes herself visible in a corner and tugs at the cloak of the confused guard.

She tries to convince the guard, but insight 19 ultimately - they aren't that interested. They probably won't do it, what with everything else going on.

Later on, she catches up with Ignatious; does he know of anyone? Could we get off at the next stop? Bel messages Oswen... "Should I try and slide that stone out of the guard's pocket?"

WIS 13 save, not enough to think better of it. "Amazing as it seems, that Erinyes is innocent. The Harmonium are wrong and won't listen. Do it!"

Bel's SOH's vs guard's perception is a solid win - he manages to unlock the door and sneak the the stone back. He whispers, "The rest is up to you".

He doesn't tell us until later - the **Erinyes has given him a phrase. A contact phrase, to reach her.** We can discuss the boon - whether or not she gets free. We did our part, apparently.

Wildly illegal, but the right thing to do. We now *definitely* can't ever go to that prison plane upon which we stumbled the once!

Back at our cabin, minutes away from the next stop, Lili says - although the next plane is not much fun, she wants to depart. Ignatious wants to stay. He likes being on board; he's actually assigned to watch for weird stuff going on. We thank him profusely. He gives us his card - a silhouette, illithid wearing a hat with a pipe.

So, at the next stop, we will depart. The modrons are secretly pleased, despite being very polite. We do apologise for the trouble!

We hand the box to Lili and *then* show her the rod. "It was their contact I think... Do we mind if we keep this? We might know someone who can figure this out." Yes. No worries. Now, Lili and all of us need to get - well, anywhere but about here roughly. Lili talks at length about what she "really needs now" and as she speaks it becomes obvious to us that she means to go to Sigil! But that's closed - we don't get to describe that though because we now step outside of the train and - oh my goodness.

The fields of torment. Ash and fire and writhing bodies, or at least limbs, and floating above some strange giant stone prison and what almost looks like a river, flowing from two sides and meeting in the middle, but it's demons and devils in the blood war. It's deafening.

"Let's get out of here!" says Oswen, hoping the 1-in-400 chance doesn't strike; no more bardic; so she chooses to get near Trade Gate just to get away from *here*. So she grabs Lili's hand and says to the group, "brace yourselves!" and - pop! - market square, Trade Gate.

Bel wants to get to a bath ASAP! "I'm paying. We're going to a *nice* hotel!" His keen eyes had seen this one during earlier visits - **Silk Road**.

This isn't quite what Lili had in mind and she's not quite able to grasp Sigil but Bel gets 3 rooms - for him and Inafina; Oswen and Kindle; and Lili; "How about we all get cleaned up and we'll meet in Oswen's room".

That done, Lili gets out the box. All of her stuff **and the chapter house** are in Sigil so now she wants to try and get the box open. But Lili was told strictly to not open it! Oswen Arcana only 4+13->17. It's very complex. Hard to see how to turn the wards off. In the end at Lili's suggestion, Oswen does Identify, but it takes 10 minutes to ritual-cast.

* The box itself is magical
* It contains something which is being protected
* It doesn't protect the outside world from outside; it protects what's inside from dangers outside

"I don't think we should open this. The thing inside is being protected, hidden, from outside. We need to ask MK." She casts Sending (D20->7, interplanar is fine) and says, "Met someone called Lili. Her chapter house is trapped inside Sigil. Have a powerful magic item she recovered. Need help understanding. At Trade Gate."

A response. "Intriguing! Don't know Lili but sounds serious. Give me a couple of hours. I'll come to Trade Gate and contact you".

OK, well, that's time for some good quality food and drink... No idea what day or time it is, but whatever. Let's go and relax! Bel says that the restaurant here is good, but we also like the idea of going into town. Lili's exhausted and asks us to get her food - she's been awake a good day and a half. She entrusts the box to us so she doesn't have to keep guarding it; we're confident now that it's not extra-planar in any way itself, so hide it in the Portable Hole.

D20->14. The area around the main market is becoming somewhat familiar. We can see the changeover of the daytime stalls to evening stalls, so now we know the time of day. Unless we've skipped _entire_ days here then the passage of time on the train wasn't all that different from the passage of time here.

The sort of thing Lili was after was some kind of pastry wrapping a meat filling and we find several variations of that, so pick up a selection from different places. There's some kind of frozen fruit desert, from a stall run by an ice devil! We try that out, sitting down at a nearby outside table, eating quickly as it melts fast. Oswen has to check in with Kindle - "About that Erinyes... They were wrongly accused, and it could help us with Vrakir. Are you OK with what we did?"

"I wasn't there. I might have done things differently. I'd have to read the situation. I don't know if they could be trusted. But you the made the decision you made and that's fine by me, because I trust you and that you're aware of what you're doing. And if anything were bad to happen as a result of it, I know you'd own up to it and try to make things right."

We get back to room and knock; no response; Oswen assumes she's asleep but Bel is worried - but then remembers that we haven't swapped the helm and hat yet. Using that, he can check she's alright. Then - hoping it's not creepy! - he picks the lock, we leave the food and tuck her in, then sneak out and lock it again. Orvil elects to find a perch in the hallway and keep an eye on the door overnight.

The rest of us finish food. "Mordenkainen said two hours, so I suppose we don't sleep yet; we'd better wait for him" says Oswen. We rest a while. Bel plays his Song of Rest. A while later, a Sending message - "I'm in Trade Gate. Meet me at Wayfarer's Rest, Upstairs Room." "OK! Be there soon!" We write a note for Lili and push it under her door. Oswen swaps in Arcane Eye and pops one into Lili's room, at least to keep watch for the next hour; Orvil comes with us and we try to find the address given.

We ask at the market; easily found. It's a fancy-looking lounge bar in one of the arms of Trade Gate, same as the train station. We head in and get greeted, explain about being expected in the upstairs room and get allowed in. MK is there sampling an array of food, with a decanter of pink wine on the corner of the table. He stands to greet us.

After some smalltalk, we get to business - the box. He recognises it straight away! "Ah! We've been really needing this!" - we get into the who and how. As for our shapeshifter, MK hopes we have them in custody? Ah, well, no, the modrons do. He can't interview them to try to find out more - never mind, but a dead end. At this, Oswen suddenly remembers the rod! She'd even forgotten about it when Identifying the box. MK doesn't recognise it either, so he has us eat ("I can't possibly finish all this!") while he spell-casts Identify, takes only a minute, then has a rather faraway look; Oswen gets the impression that he's *listening* to the spell speak to him. For her, it's more visual impressions.

"You had a run in with quite a dangerous creature, I think! Can you read the text on this?"

She can't, but could with Comprehend. MK doesn't think it worthwhile now, but he can't read it either. He thinks the shapeshifter must've been some kind of Warlock. This is a rod of a pact-keeper; an embodiment of the strength of the pact between a warlock and their patron.

(Huh. I guess now we're a target for *them*, too. Start forming an orderly queue behind Vrakir and Drax.)

"We can probably guess who the patron is" says MK "because the text is written in a language I've only ever seen when it has been used by creatures from the Far Realm. So this is an agent of one of the Great Old Ones. **What interest would the Great Ones have in the codex?!**"

The what?! Ah! That's what is in the box.

* "This is classic Golden Vault!" he exclaims
* He's had visions of futures for months (this we know)
* One such vision required access to - "keys, should I say?" - long forgotten, which require translation of some kind; a book, the Book Of Planes
* A hidden codex is used for that (at least, according to MK's research) which had been hidden, but could be recovered should there ever be a need to access portals if Sigil was ever closed
* I don't have a way into Sigil; "This is the next best thing"
* Sigil is the city of doors. It's possible to find a way into any plane from there. But with that hub closed, we're "all very disconnected" and some planes that were shut are *nearly* impossible to get to. But only if you have the codex.
* Oswen, HIS 20+5 - "Like Eberron, for example?"
* "Yes! Or more importantly - like Athas" (a desert world; that's where the half-giant gladiators came from; similar to Goliaths, but more classic half-giants)

"But what about Athas is so important?" asks Oswen.

MK leans in and whispers. "So. Athas is important because one of the pieces of the Rod is there. And there's no other way to get to Athas. It's been closed from within. We have no idea what's happening in that plane; no idea at all. Someone very powerful from within closed it by *damaging* the weave. It requires very powerful magic to puncture through that and create a stable portal to that plane. *No-one* Has the metal component required to access that plane" (Oswen realises he means a Plane Shift focus) "because metal is *very* rare there for some reason - something happened and almost all of the metal on that plane has been removed or destroyed."

So the codex decodes a book he has, which gives him access to such a plane as a planeshift teleport.

The amulet, of course, can't do it - or MK would've already done so, long before he gave it to Oswen. He fears the weave simply too damaged there.

There's not much we can do right now re. Far Realm. If Oswen is able to ever get back in contact with the entity there - from the time with Zorhanna and again in the dream - then maybe we can ask questions. Until then? She doesn't even know the name. At least MK says that given her description, he's sure it's a Great One.

Right. The codex. MK with Oswen's help examines the box and eventually it's decoded enough to open. The box is opened, to reveal a few-inches-each-side small jewel encrusted chest sat within a display case. Oswen, ARC 20+13 -> 33. Oh, easy. She's read all about *those*. That's the key that is used to open Leoman's Secret Chest - well, to access the pocket dimension where the chest is hidden. She doesn't have that spell - it must be cast *on* the chest. Oswen doesn't have that and MK grabbed things in a hurry when Sigil was closing, so isn't sure if he has it. And he does - albeit only in scroll form.

He doesn't waste time; he picks up the small chest and casts immediately. Where the tiny chest was, there's suddenly a big and heavy chest! He drops it and jumps back. "After you" says Owen. MK grunts as he heaves open the chest and then almost squeals in delight! "Ah, yes!" - a dodecahedron. But then he spots something else - another book. "What's this?"

Oswen examines the book. "Coded", she says. It doesn't take long to play around with the codex enough to realise that it also deciphers this book, not just MK's Book Of Planes. She decodes the title page; "Forbidden Sequences And Forgotten Names".

Oswen and MK make eye contact. "Oooh!"

Investigation 15+13->28. It takes a bit of time, but with the two of them together, we discover that this is the *original* text. The Book Of The Planes is itself a copy. There are many such copies - that much MK already knew, but he thought they copied each other. Maybe some did, but there's a whole second section here which he's never seen before. A book of *names*. Real names of important Celestials and Fiends.

Even MK recoils at that. "This is *bad* - this power is *very* dangerous. It can be used to compel these beings as a means of controlling them." He takes a step back

Oswen looks up and says, "But in the right hands..." - and she's flipping pages and using the codex.

MK is horrified - "tell me you haven't memorised any!"

Oswen says, "I'm only looking for one! What's wrong?"

"No! It's *compulsion*. That's compulsion. That would give you the power to override the free will of another being."

"But that being is overriding the free will of many others."

"But do you see how dangerous that is?"

Oswen WIS save 16. She doesn't quite (DM DC says 20). She's not convinced. But Kindle can see the conflict, the other three having simply been onlookers until now. "We're talking about *forcing* someone to do something they don't have to do."

"Well how is that different from Charm Person?!" pipes up Bel. That's not helping! But with that, MK explains, you can't compel them to - say - harm themselves. With these various arguments, adv WIS save - it would be a 16 again, but with ADV hits 20. She just scrapes into the DC.

It took a lot and then it's as if the spell is broken and she too looks alarmed and steps back. "OK, OK I get it!" - indeed the temptation is a good chunk of the issue.

"So what now?" she asks. "We have this awful thing we don't want!"

We have to hide it again. Why not destroy it? By way of a demonstration MK has us try to destroy it. We can damage it sometimes, but it repairs immediately and often it just *absorbs* magic. A mace, a sacred flame, a firebolt, anything.

Well, we keep the codex and put the book back in the chest and hide the chest in the little chest (!) and then MK says the best he can do, basically, is use one of the Golden Vault's hidden vaults. "Only one person really knows where each hidden item is" he says. "So that would be me, in this case. But 1 is better than 5."

It's decided that enough new information between everyone has happened that we should convene. And that means the fey wild, but people need time to travel. 24 hours. So it'll be tomorrow evening by whatever clock they have, hopefully they can do the maths and get to our fey wild keep at about the same time. We decide to stay in Trade Gate, in that case, to avoid any time slips. MK sends word using the Stone, but for security reasons they'll convene in Trade Gate so it just looks a bit like normal travel. Then when sure we're not being observed, we'll all to to the Keep in one go. We can take 9 in total with the amulet but others will have to make their own arrangements!

MK adds, as we're about to leave - "Don't suppose - well - we need to give Lili something..." "For completing the mission?" "Yes." He fishes out two gems - "Would you mind giving this to her? I don't suppose you have a magic item of some kind you don't mind parting with?" Oswen has an idea of what could be good. MK also gives us Lili's new mission key.

We part company with MK, intending to meet back again tomorrow. We head back to the room. Oswen's realised via Arcane Eye that Lili is awake and eating her food.

We head back and knock on her door (Oswen dismisses the spell). Lili invites us in and we bring her up to speed, but she doesn't need to know the details of what was in the box. We pass on the key, the gems and - Oswen gives her Piwafwi of Fire Resistance.

After some chat, we all retire to bed. We *definitely* setup watch:

* Oswen 8 (!) - well, it's been a day!
* Inafina wakes up Oswen, then ADV (listening) 24. People walking around normally it the hotel. Lili talks in her sleep!
* Kindle 27 - alert to the point of being on edge, but watch is uneventful.
* Bel 10 - fast asleep! It was a *big* day for him on the train especially.



## Campaign day 30

In the morning, Oswen wakes Bel and we gather together and sake off the night. Oswen holds up her journal. "A month" says Oswen, "even though it feels like a year. We've been on this recent quest for 30 days, well, by our own personal clock, so to speak. It's funny, only 30 days since we were shuttering the cottage." We head down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast.

Lili comes down and finds us.

Over breakfast, we quietly compare notes on the Golden Vault. It seems they're equally obtuse with her. It pays well, "I always feel like I'm doing something for good, at least" she opines.

"I'm gonna go into town and resupply, then I'm off on my next mission! says Lili. "Gotta pay the bills. And there's apparently a universe that needs saving! Hah." Then she has a sudden moment of earnest sincerity; a dropping of the guard. "Look. You had no reason to trust me, Inafina. Much less to help me, all of you. I know I joke about this just being a job but you know it's not. Knowing that we're working towards the same goals just reminds me that I'm making the right choice. I really want you to know how much that means to me. I have times when - well, you know! You're in a Situation and questioning Life Choices."

She almost lucks tearful. "I hope you know how lucky you are to have each other - as someone who does this alone - I wouldn't have it any other way for me, but I see how you are, with each other. It's really precious. I hope our paths cross again someday!" - and on the verge of tears, she bolts out the room before we get a chance to reply.

Oswen looks at her departing out the door and says, "I hope our paths cross again too."

We finish breakfast in the silence of contemplation.

Eventually Bel breaks the ice; "So, what to do today?"

"I wonder if there's news, since we seem to be reflecting on recent acquaintances, of that captain - Inda, Indra?" "Inda, yes". "Perhaps the harbourmaster might know if they're back in?"

We ask with the Harbourmaster. The Lambent Zenith isn't back in berth, though we didn't have any specific date we expected them back.

We're headed back down some stairs and Bel's up front, Inafina and Oswen behind and Inafina notices Bel's Bandor is missing - "Oh my goodness! Bel! It's missing! Where's your Bandore gone?!" "I must have left it in the room... That's funny... To be honest I haven't really thought about it much. I feel like I'm outgrowing it a bit? Does that sound weird?" Oswen ARC check on Bel, 19, come to think of it - he hasn't used it for magic in a while. She says, "Well, I think we're all finding new ways to do things. Perhaps it's not needed for spells as much as it once was. Still, for sentimental reasons, before we check out we should pick it up."

Oswen and Inafina exchange glances. Bel's now fretting about whether it was left or even stolen while he was asleep! We decide to get back to the hotel and check out. Bel finds the Bandore propped up against a chair, so all's well. **It is an interesting reminder of how this journey changes us all.**

Oswen didn't give that rod for the warlock to MK. She wants to try divination to find out more. Not wanting to stink out the room, and Bel suggests temples. Plenty here! But which? Religion 13. She doesn't know which. But she *thinks* that - at least on Toril - creatures from the Far Realm might be worshipped the same as gods, but aren't part of any particular temple pantheon. So she says, "Let's find something for Yondalla and hope she understands why we're using her house."

We discover a shrine. That'll do nicely. It's tucked behind an inn and not directly visible from the street. She starts her ritual and as she does, has to think carefully about the question.

"Yondalla, forgive the intrusion. As you must be aware, all planes are under threat. Amongst them, great beings in the Far Realm are scared, and one has been contacting me, trying to convey warnings. I wish to contact them back, but lack the knowledge of how and wish to acquire such knowledge. Please help."

This time the smoke doesn't swirl. Instead it settles and calms. Smells change, no longer incense but more - nostalgia. The smell of pumpkin soup and fireplaces library books on shelves. She then hears something - children - chanting a nursery rhyme. She's struck with a sudden pang of sorrow, almost certainly unintended, at strong nostalgia for being sat under her favourite tree in the library courtyard. Then there's a sense. **It's not for her to find them. It requires patience. They must find her. At the places where boundaries between wakefulness and sleep are thinnest, there she will meet that which she seeks.**

At least that confirms something - the dream she had of Vecna's takeover wasn't just mere fancy. She *was* being warned by something from the Far Realm and given how it "felt" she's confident it was the same entity. But quite probably not the one linked to this specific rod.

We have some options:

* Try to trace Arkhan The Cruel
* Find out more about the Eye

Difficult to know where to start on either. We've probably gone as far as we can with the Eye; if that might've been on Oerth then the two of the Eight over there may be better placed to dig around. But Arkhan deserves more study. Mr Know It All's doesn't open until 2-4pm (!) so at Reader's Nook we look around for shops that look like they might deal in that kind of knowledge. Features of note; almost, legend; bordering on biographical. The shops here are all small though and generally aren't themed. Luck of the draw territory. Maybe then, this is more of a library / large shop sort of thing!

We've passed a few along the "main hub". **Bookwyrms** springs to mind. It's some kind of chain - we've seen them elsewhere; certainly, at least, in Sigil. The sign has a brass dragon with spectacles and chin resting on folded arms above the "B". Inside is a big brass dragon with a plaque describing an original brass dragon that apparently started the whole thing, a long time ago. It's a marketing ploy of sorts but the basics of the history seem believable enough.

An assistant directs us to memoirs; maybe a long shot, but he might've written about his own exploits. Investigation 29. It's alphabetic - in moments we find no memoirs or biographies about them. Options after that include maybe religion (because paladin) or legends, myths even; they have a section on legends that are supposedly grounded rather more in truths. Half-true books, so to speak. Investigation 26. The books here are written more as legends. Epics, poetry, too embellished. Last resort only.

Try again. History. They have a section arranged by plane and epoch. There's a guide to epoch names per plane. We go for the newest (current) but it feels like a needle in a haystack, knowing only a name. The assistant says, "Ah, but you have a name! You're in luck. This is a Bookwyrms!"

They pull out a book of some kind, a wand and stand near the shelves. We spell the Arkhan name in Common and thee held book opens, flips through pages quickly then seems to settle on pages that seem to be still writing _themselves_. There are three books in particular that we're told have a mention of Arkhan. We're given time to look.

* Author: Artus Simber Jr - "Into Death And Back Again / A Firsthand Account of The Lost City of Omu and the Tomb of Annihilation"
* Author: The Order of Tyr - "Oaths of Nobility and Oathbreakers"
* Author: Guild Of Explorers and Adventurers - "Selected Expeditions vol. 73"

The second is interesting. The third might be relevant to the hag's cauldron vision, though and could be close to our own sort of perspective. There are some 55 brief write-ups in there, though, but at least the format is standardised. Investigation 29, some lucky rolls for that. Some 50 of them in the index don't sound at all relevant. It doesn't take long scanning through for the next 5. And what's more, **it matches the description of the vision we saw**. Their goal was to try and take down some particular enemies, which isn't so interesting, but in the course of that found a withered hand artefact which isn't named here. It refers to a Dragonborn Paladin with whom they became allies, but this person betrayed them. They did succeed in the mission and kill the sorceress. It's sort of a glowing review, from the perspective of *their* goals. There is a specific date - which by Oswen's reckoning is from about 20 years ago.

All of that lines up with the hag's cauldron and that by itself is useful validation. It gives us a specific date when this Dragonborn went to Avernus, but curiously, *this* particular adventure (despite the book's location) had taken them *off* Toril. So it happened elsewhere. At Know It All's, the book of "about 20 years ago" was confident that the Hand was on Toril, so there's some quite rapid movement (or the book's author is mistaken).

OK, so shift focus to Oathbreakers. That's just the final chapter, investigation 22, there's a mention. Arkhan is mentioned only as an example of how a Paladin could - according to reports of those who travelled with him - give the appearance of following a particular oath when in fact they're no longer practicing that and have secretly been Oathbreakers. The book paints such people in a very negative light! Usually such an act causes the person to lose their power, but some can draw on dark magic of varied kinds to avoid such.

That leaves us with Artus Simber. A whopping 30 on investigation this time! Her speed and inaccuracy, consistently, is about the best it's ever been for the time we've spent here. She learns quickly that Artus was deeply involved in *part* of an expedition **only four years ago**. Arkhan is referred to early pretty soon, after the first couple of chapters - then constantly, more or less. Arkhan was involved deeply in their exploits. Even briefly, she reads about the Paladin "healed the barbarian" and a moment where they performed a power that must have been a "gift from his God" involving his strange, mummified hand - and he even was known to say, "for Tiamat!" - clearly believed in Her and they thought that she had given him this hand, which evidently to them was in and of itself powerful.

This adventure *was* on Toril. That's where this Lost City and Tomb are. Jungles, to the South, Sword Coast. "Same continent" says Oswen, almost absent-mindedly.

The account claims that plans of a lich called Acererack were thwarted. Arkhan was still present. "Force Grey ended up splitting up after they returned to Waterdeep and completing the mission that was assigned to them by the Black Staff to go into the Jungles Of Chult" - it ends, "That was the last time that I saw Arkhan, Hitch, Calliope and Jamilah".

We realise by cross-referencing that the Oathbreaker book's information about Arkhan arises from talking to the group described in the Adventurers book. This group was fooled; they didn't know Arkhan was a paladin of anything other than one of the "approved" good-aligned pantheon. They'd assumed Tyr, which is why they spoke to that particular order. So that's why he's thought of as an oathbreaker. In fact, given that about four years ago he's openly crediting his power to Tiamat, he's an oathbreaker of a different kind - the paladins of Toril consider anyone who gets power via a god other than those they list as an oathbreaker, but from his perspective he's got some kind of oath or similar relationship, just with Tiamat, and we guess simply went to Avernus to confer with her about the Hand. We do know then, that Tiamat is surely aware that he's in possession of that object and it seems a creature as old and clever as Tiamat didn't know what it was (though it's not impossible that it was recognised only in terms of its sheer power).

This means the Black Staff knowingly dealt with this individual, aware of his alignment and what's more whatever they did was apparently successful. Which would seem to indicate lawful, especially given that they didn't - say - kill everyone for fun, or vanish to another plane, once the mission was accomplished. We also get the impression that while Arkhan clearly can travel between worlds, the others in his group may have been as unaware of that possibility as we once were.

20 years is a long time. 4 years is too, but it's not as long as all that. However, there *was* the dragon war since, and the war against Tiamat, who we know was pushed back. It might have made him change plan. But, this is the strongest lead we've got. And we met those people from Toril who'd run into Black Staff's tower at Waterdeep when Vecna took over. They don't know anything, but it points to Black Staff having escaped. So where is she, because she certainly knows more about this individual than we do.

We decide to buy the book. Black Staff may know more info about Arkhan, but this book also clearly has a deeper insight too. It's only 15gp! That's cheap. The assistant says: "Well I took the liberty of signing you up to our Bookwyrm's Hoarders Club! Here's your Hoarder's Card. Gives you a discount off your first purchase!"
