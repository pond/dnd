# Oswen: Part 2.4
## Day 10
### Cottage at Ordulin

First thing in the morning, Oswen creeps out of bed to consult her spellbook; it seems new things might challenge us soon.

Leonidas hangs out for breakfast, but will head to town later. Oswen mentions that the Vault replied and we should be ready to travel. Well, we kind of always are!

In the mean time, we wonder if we could get into the university library here at Ordulin and see what that might have as a starting point of research. Perhaps Professor Roslov had some key, or pass for that... We search; Oswen, investigation 19+8->27. In an old writing desk, she finds a strange, old-looking brass key. It doesn't match anything we know of on the cottage or sheds, but also has no other indications for what it might be; but it's in the same drawer as a four digit code written on a piece of paper (!). Again, there's no indication of what that's for.

If this *was* for the library, it would be for a staff-only area, or a secure area. And if it's a secure area, that's where the good books are! Could be the archive. Roslov's group were studying anything considered 'occult', which is really just another way to say, 'we do not understand this yet'.

Best bet is to head there and sneak around. Orvil stretches his wings; "about time! I was starting to get bored hanging around the house!"

We all walk in together. Leonidas says he'll dig around the public library (but doesn't expect to find much). We carry on to the University and follow signs to the library. Along the way, there's a quad - a student area - where there's a big banner and flags, "The Young Perdue Society". Oswen tries to not roll her eyes. At least it's a bit of a distraction! The Occult Studies department is easy to find; if occurs to Oswen that maybe the key or code are for something in his office. But it has been reused and is now some kind of training room.

A woman comes by and asks who we're looking for. We explain we have a key left for us by the Professor and wondered if it opens something in his office; were his old belongings taken anywhere? But then she looks concerned and asks to see the key. Turns out it's a university key. "So this would belong to the university" she says. Bel tries to convince her that, well yes, but maybe there's something he wanted us to see? Persuasion is only 11. She puts the key in her pocket. "I'll make sure this gets to whoever will be able to file it away or return it to the university!"

Oswen Messages Bel as this is happening, "Mage Hand or something? We need the key!" - but Bel's good with SOH and knows he can't pickpocket with Mage Hand, it's visible and just too obvious. He responds back with a single word, "Distraction".

Oswen winks at Inafina and tries to start a performance to feign an argument about "needing the key". The deception isn't good, but it's *just* enough to give Bel advantage on his pickpocket move. And that's just enough - he got 23 or 28, and her perception roll was 26. So he manages to retrieve the key. The woman just leaves us arguing, walking around the interior balcony to stairs at the end, heading down to the lower level. We retreat one she's out of sight and say "won't be long before she realises that key is missing - let's get to the library!"

It's open to the public, but only students can take books out on loan. It spans four floors! Hmm, where might we look for whatever this staff or archive area is... There's a big sign showing all the levels, but nothing like archive or staff area are listed, just public stuff. There's a "staff only" sign by one door, so Orvil flies up to investigate. He tries to be stealthy, hiding on top of book shelves, but stealth - nat 1 + 3! He gets spotted quickly and shooed out. Rats!

She's rarely used Manifest Mind, but this seems like the time. She manifests a small drift globe (since it casts dim light) just on the other side of the door. A staff area; break rooms, kitchenette, small office and lockers. At the far end, stairs lead down. The "drift globe" innocently drifts down the corridor and down the stairs. Someone is coming up the other way, dodges it, looks at it a bit surprised, but seems otherwise unbothered and carries on their way. There's a small foyer at the bottom and a grated iron door with a lock. That seems good. She tries to push the spectral manifestation through the grating but hits a magical barrier. Behind, she can still see somewhat through grates, are shelves; some with boxes of stuff, some with books.

Oswen shuts down the manifestation lest it be discovered by more enquiring minds than the person on the stairs, then we confer. We have to get there physically. The most stealthy is Inafina - very quiet - and Bel can cast Invisibility, but he has to concentrate, and suggests that the rest of us could climb into the portable hole. If he's in a pocket dimension, would it even work? So instead, he'll be invisible and holding his spell. We'll get into the portable hole. We get to a bathroom! The hole is unpacked; Oswen hands Bel her satchel (it'ss also a pocket dimension); everyone gets in; Bel casts Invisibility as we're doing it; then he folds up the hole and runs for it.

In his enthusiasm, he's not too quiet... ADV stealth, 8,6+4 only 12. He runs back to the bathroom, and opens the portable hole! He's freaked out. He got to the staff room door but realised he couldn't sneak through it without being spotted; too many people around.

Oswen says, "Kindle..." (!) - and apologetically suggests that he is "deliberately" clumsy, she'll bring in Orvil and he'll chase the bird but deliberately bump into things and knock stuff over. This works very well! This time, Stealth is 21 and as someone is running *out* due to the commotion, he slips into the door. Quickly, he's downstairs but isn't sure what to do there. Oswen, Arcana 21, the barrier on the door is not just a barrier, it's a ward; and there's some kind of password needed. She looks around; a slab of obsidian has finger marks on it. She whispers, "Well maybe the code is for the door and the key is for something inside, or we need both to get in and inside is just whatever it is..." - the obsidian slab has finger marks on it, and she risks 'drawing' the numbers with her fingers on the slab. The ward drops. Then, there *is* a keyhole and it's just a normal lock at this point. We get inside, and Bel re-locks; the ward comes back.

Bel helps Oswen with the higher shelves. ADV investigation 18,18+8 -> 26. Inafina tries but has no idea what she's looking for! (4-1 -> 3). Oswen's focus is just - Far Realm. She finds a section with kind of random books that seem to have a Roslov feel! Things about realms, different sections and so-on.

Oswen: Chaotic Good. We'll bring these back; this is for the greater good! She bags a few of the books in her satchel. There are little notes next to a few artefacts; she brings up Detect Magic; very few things in here are magical. The ward and obsidian slab at the door are, of course (and she notes with relief that there's a slab inside the door, too, so we can get out!). Of all the objects, only three seem to be magical:

* A puzzle box of some kind, with lots of writings about how people have tried to solve the puzzle. It looks like someone gave up on it! Abjuration, protective; perhaps that's just aiding the puzzle difficulty.
* A broken item. Brass, almost like a toy of an eagle, but with parts broken off. Magic is around the transmutation domain.
* A strange emanation in the area near where we found the books - a strangely-shaped piece of something. Metal-like but not metal. Maybe resin; twisted; almost 1ft long, a strange cloudy purple translucency to it. She's not able to figure out the magic school at a distance. The purple isn't "normal", it's a strange colour. Could be Far Realm; hard to tell.

She whispers to the others, "keep an eye on me in case I go weird!" and reaches out to touch the shard.

Woah. It *is* Far Realm! It... Needs attunement. She needs more. She uses Identify, spending a minute to layer that on as well; it is a shard that needs a Sorcerer, not a Wizard. Needs that innate ability. It'll be safe in the satchel, and she doesn't think this is a good thing to leave here - and she's *not* bringing this one back. She takes it. Behind it, are some hand-written notes in a box; gathered together; she collects those too, and figures, "That's it, we shouldn't risk any more - time to go!".

Oswen shoes Bel the "code". Bel takes the satchel, we all get into the hole (with the box of notes), Bel traces the code on the slab, unlocks, we get outside and up. He heads back to the bathroom and we all get out as quickly as we can. "Play innocent and rescue Kindle!" - and after much confusion and noise, we do eventually all end up outside, and scarper!

(Inafina pretends she did *not* see us taking stuff! She insists we hold onto the key so we can return them some other time.)

We go to the *public* library to read, since that isn't going to attract attention. We're allowed a private reading room. Oswen shows everyone the shard. We figure it's something to show the Vault. Maybe the notes will say where it was found; so we start reading those first.

* It was discovered several years ago and brought to the library by an expedition that had returned from a merchant mission which had come across a shipwreck. The shard was amongst their discoveries when they retrieved bodies and belongings from the wreck for proper burial.

* The shard had been given to the Department Of Occult Studies because it was particularly strange! Some preliminary experiments and study make up the rest of the notes.

* "Weird" emanations; whispers heard originally but not subsequently, they were unsure if real or imaginary; studying it for too long makes you "feel a bit mad"; might hear voices or a voice then, or at least an awareness of another place linked to it.

* Nobody could otherwise decipher it, but came to the same conclusions using the same simple magic that Oswen used. And they were no more minded to risk random sorcery than we are!

* Further research was put into the ship, tracking its course before being wrecked. Even more mysterious result; most of the recovered items were given away to various museums, mostly in Selgaunt, because the ship was not of a make, or used technology really known to, any of the civilisations around the Sea Of Fallen Stars. Yet it is an inland sea and all the surrounding cultures are known!

* It is described only in writing. A galleon, badly damaged (in fact, scattered in pieces) as if it had crashed into something, but that wasn't consistent with the place it lay when found - more like it was damaged, then drifted there. The damage on more intensive study was considered consistent with the ship having somehow been *hurled* by a storm or hurricane with such great force that it broke apart on impact with whatever it hit, scattering contents far and wide.

* There are redacted writings! Some of this describes the bodies removed. Much has been blacked out. Why?

* The piece left at Ordulin might have been done without the approval or knowledge of the university at large, since it seems just about everything else went to Selgaunt - *everything* discovered and all notes have been signed away, says one sheet.

INT-based insight check; nat 20 -> 25! This ship "fell" from another plane. We have skimmers that can drift; maybe "they" have 'skimmers' that can fly, like Bel's balloon did. And if one fell into our plane out of control for some reason it could crash and scatter as described. Makes more sense than some weird storm! We're interrupted by Leonidas, who was told we'd been put in this room. He's found two books but, as he feared, they are rudimentary.

One talks more about the Far Realm as a simplistic mythology. It does however mention that Elder Brains and Beholders are linked in mythology to beings that escaped the Far Realm and adapted to life in the material planes. At least that's not too wild a suggestion.

The other book is a kind of hocus-pocus "rituals to the other side" kind of vibe; the Far Realm is unknowable and ineffable. "Some things are beyond our minds!" finishes that book's brief chapter on the subject.

It's all getting a bit intense... Bel suggests food, then we can continue with our other books. So we head out, get some street food and sit under the Oswen's favourite library tree to eat, with a few other students around. Then suddenly Inafina shudders; she hears something before she sees it. A tiny hurricane appears! 5ft by 5ft... It whirls towards Oswen. "Well, this is new!" she says; it calms a bit and lifts and, underneath where it was, is a small chest. Arcana 26. Must be an air elemental! So why does she know what's in the chest? And that it's for her? She gets a sense of a countdown too. Ten minutes! She has ten minutes to decide if she wants to open the chest and take what's in it out.

This is Oswen. Of course, she opens it immediately.

Inside, is a rolled up note tied with a gold ribbon, a golden key and a small silk bag that seems to have coins in it. "Ah. It seems we are being invited..." - she shows everyone. As she takes the objects the elemental engulfs the chest and disappears. Other people are watching all this in astonishment!

We quickly unroll the note. There is a sequence of runes; that's it. Arcana 21; the runes are puzzle that needs to be solved. If she can arrange the runes correctly, they are a sequence for a teleportation circle. Not that *we* can cast that but if we're going to Selgaunt anyway - we could pay again. We check the coin bag. 50 platinum pieces! None of us have ever seen one up close before. But we realise, too, that these are not Sembian currency. There is lettering; we realise these are legal minted tender for trading in Baldur's Gate. So that must be the teleportation destination. And the other thing... Well, we're being watched! We finish food and return to the private room. We of course invite Leonidas.

In the room we put the key up to the pocket watch, which causes a keyhole to just appear in it. The key clicks into place and then the *key* (not the watch) plays Major Image. We watch in astonishment! It's blurry; a figure, their face hidden; a voice, which sounds altered; how strange. "Interesting, alarming news; very intrigued; it is time to meet face to face with your handler!" ("*Handler?!* I'm not a dog!" says Oswen). "Secrecy utmost, of course! I trust you are more than capable of deciphering the puzzle on the note. Have provided means for travel in the event you need to pay for passage at any point. Looking forward to meeting you." - then the image shifts to a place, a picture of a kind of big gate with a statue of a basilisk above it. Many carvings on either side. We figure it must be a location in Baldur's Gate. Then it shifts again; a small inn, next to the gate - "**The Inn Of Last Chances**", a narrow, three-storey, unassuming wooden building. Then there's an indication of time and day.

We have two days; 8pm. Oswen says, "Right then. I guess we read the other books on the skimmer!" - Oswen pulls out the leaflet from last time. We have a couple of hours for a Selgaunt skimmer. We'll keep it public; less suspicious. We are after all taking the books from the university for longer than intended.

We all head to the lagoon to get the tickets, still 3sp each, Leonidas in tow. There is brief time for goodbyes! Oswen gives Leonidas the one sending stone. "You can message me one a day on this and I can reply, or vice versa, so long as I'm on this plane, no matter how far." "That's nice! But I'll be OK! Please don't worry about me..." Oswen laughs. "I always worry a bit."

Bel encourages us to hurry and we get aboard the skimmer. This time, instead of taking in the view, we get a table to hunker down and look at the other books. Bel occasionally gets drinks, or wanders off from time to time, not too big on attention span! Nonetheless, Oswen makes amazing progress - ADV investigation a maximum 20+8 -> 28. We together manage to read about half the books we picked, gleaning a fair bit of info.

* There are very few academic texts or even true, "verified" facts about the Far Realm. The books we read are couched in caveats; lot of 2nd hand accounts; most things written by researchers doing interviews.

* Nobody seems to have ever travelled the Far Realm before, or if they did, they chose to stay there, got stuck there, or died there.

* Some people have entered it briefly, but came back injured both physically and mentally. Some theories even go so far as to say that "part of their minds might be still there". Excruciating pain is mentioned by some! Loss of self. Oswen knows that feeling - that strange pressure and the psychic damage.

* Oswen wonders how Zorhanna survived for a few days, but apparently stayed intact? Was something protecting her? She was, after all, in that kind of "bubble", which we think was *inside* the entity that Oswen originally took for being the Far Realm itself.

### 6pm (or thereabouts)

We realise all of a sudden that we're approaching Selgaunt. Children are running past, excited to see it. Soon, we're pulling into port. We disembark - at least it's familiar now! And we know a good place to stay. We have this evening, tomorrow and then our meeting the day after at 8pm. We get to **The Bowery** and pay for 1 night again, 2gp; we'll head to the temple to try and get a teleport to Baldur's Gate tomorrow. (Later, we revise this, realising we have until 8pm and having found out that Baldur's Gate is pretty rough! We'll travel on the morning of the day of the meeting and get 2 nights instead).

We did like The Golden Otter for food a lot, but this is a new city and we want to try new things. This evening we are not in a rush and Kindle suggests the Selgaunt Market, that we pretty much walk past every time we're leaving the skimmer port!

Trinkets. Trinkets and more trinkets - we'll need to pay our way at our new keep in the Fey Wild. This is the perfect place! By request, D20->9, D6->5; we find a few trinket stalls; one in particular is second hand, **Cherished Memories**. Those sorts of trinkets would have much more meaning. We aren't sure how much we'll need, so sort of want to fill our boots! He lays out a box of what he has. (D6->5 => 5)d8->27; we find 27 things that we think ought to work very well. He'll sell the collection for only 1sp each. We call it 3 gold for good measure. We thank the storekeeper and head out - and Kindle almost immediately points over at a big food area - being 8ft tall and led by the nose can have its advantages!

There are various long tables, fold-out, for people to sit and eat the street food from the many vendors in this section of the market. A circular area has bean bags and stone benches. A big tree is illuminated with a band playing underneath. It's very lively! People are in their winter clothes, but while it's chilly here, the number of people and cooking areas mean that it's not too bad. The smells are amazing, even including outdoor bread ovens.

We try all manner of things. Kindle is a bit of a bottomless pit, of course, given his great stature! There's a lot of variation here as this is a seaside town, compared to Ordulin's farm setting. We stick mostly to savoury stuff, quite a lot of shellfish, but also try some more exotic things; food from further East and South, across the Sea of Fall Stars.

Eventually we end up on beanbags and the stone benches by the tree, having intended to dance, but being far too full! At one moment, Kindle heads away, then returns - blowing on cups, apparently too hot for comfort! - with four mugs of what turns out to be a sort of carob caramel drink. It's quite rich after everything else, though Oswen's OK with it; maybe a bit much for Inafina after all the food, but it's alright if she takes her time with it.

We are approached by a couple of younger kids, who stand and stare. Oswen starts making minor illusions; Kindle fighting things, other stuff we've seen; this seems to frighten them off though! They run and hide behind the tree trunk, peeking around, except one girl with a shawl who seems wide-eyed with amazement. Oswen keeps the show going; a mother comes over and apologises. But of course, it's no problem.

We get to talking about Baldur's Gate. Oswen, HIS 21; she recalls the Sword Coast being a bit more - uuh - challenging than the cities to which we are accustomed. She's read a fair bit; some things about government operations, people being a bit poorer and less looked after compared to Sembia; but what does this mean for visitors, especially a Satyr and Bugbear? She knows each city has its own laws, too.

Inafina suggests we chat to stallholders. Given the variety of produce, they seem to be at least able to trade with a lot of these areas. Bel gets to work! Persuasion 18+7->25, wow. It seems that for Baldur's Gate, we keep our weapons very visible as a deterrent, keep our wits about us - other people won't come to our aid. Sounds like a "watch your back" thing. All this said, none of the stallholders themselves have ever been - it's all 2nd hand.

Eventually we walk slowly back towards The Bowery, taking in the sights as we go. Tomorrow we figure we'll talk to the temple and arrange a teleport for the next day (so we change to two nights at The Bowery), to give us more research time here in Selgaunt and be less at risk in Baldur's Gate.

Before bed, she messages Leonidas on the sending stone. He messages back. She feels warm and fuzzy inside.



## Day 11
### Selgaunt

In the morning, after breakfast, Oswen asks if anyone minds us going to a scroll shop, in case there's magic that can help with investigations, or protect us from pick-pockets! Investigation 15, looking for a shop. We end up at **The Rune-Pository**, highly recommended. Inafina takes one look at the pun name, and says "...No. Just no..." - but Oswen talks her into it!

Inside, the shop is divided into different parts. "Items For Practitioners" - seems to be wands, orbs and so-on. "Tomes" - contains, well, tomes. "Scroll Exchange" - that could be handy. It seems scrolls of one level are exchanged for scrolls of another. A final section includes inks, parchment, spell gems and so-on.

* Considering swapping L4 Ice Storm for - L4 Greater Invisibility; then spots L4 Arcane Eye. There's L4 Dimension Door, too. She certainly wants to swap Ice Storm for Arcane Eye. Might be worth paying for Dimension Door, but only she could use it given her small stature. Maybe Greater Invisibility, just in case.

* L2/L3 - available are Blindness/Deafness; Stinking Cloud; Spider Climb; Nystul's Magic Aura; Daylight; Cloud Of Daggers; Locate Object; Major Image. She swaps L3 Slow for Major Image. L2 Darkness for Spider Climb. L2 Darkvision swaps for Blindness/Deafness. Then she asks about something that's similar to Comprehend Languages but you can speak, too; she can't recall the name - they have it; Tongues. Worth buying. She figures Locate Object isn't that powerful but since we have a spare L2 Hold Person scroll and she has that in her spellbook, plus Bel can cast it, she swaps that too.

That's swapping a L4, L3 and 3 L2 scrolls; 10gp per level, 130gp! Woah. Dimension Door, 480gp; if she tried to buy Greater Invisibility, L4, that's a hefty 500gp. Tongues, L3? 150gp.

And then, we'd want to copy as much as we could. She thinks she'd prioritise inks for Arcane Eye for sure. 160gp of ink (since only 40gp per level thanks to the quill). Those level 2 scrolls, as well; 6*40 -> 240gp.

As we're debating, the shopkeeper notices the Helm Oswen has; offers 1,200gp. Very kind, but too valuable. (Oswen realises she'd mis-remembered the helm too - it can detect thoughts as often as she wants, not just once a day - that latter part is for its unpleasant ability to cast Suggestion once daily). Major Image is useful for persuasion often and so is Tongues, so that's another 240gp. Wow. So:

* 130gp on various swaps
* 150gp for L3 Tongues
* 500gp for L4 Greater Invisibility, but kept as a scroll for now, not transcribed
* 160 + 240 + 240 for ink! 640gp, more ink than there is in the world, surely... Yet they have it

All in, 1420gp. Oh may. They do at least offer a discount...! If buying inks, the exchange fees are halved. So that comes down to 65gp. If buying scrolls *and* inks, they give us a 10gp for the levels of scrolls bought - that's 70gp back too. 1285gp now. Oh, and there's a bulk discount on top! 1000gp of ink for 900gp.

* Oswen adds in, then, 3 levels of ink for her existing uncopied Intellect Fortress, 1 to top up the four she has and let her copy Scrying when she understands it enough, and may as well get 4 levels more for that Greater Invisibility spell. That's an extra 960gp, so one spare (!) to get it to 1000gp.
* Turns out it's a special, beautiful box of various coloured inks in pull-out drawers; **The Archmage's Palette**.
* In digging around she's not sure if she's calculated it right, and might even have 5 lots of ink (because the quill is efficient), but this kind of highlights the need for a "proper" ink solution. Bel is especially enthusiastic just because the box looks so impressive!

She'll have 10 levels left over after copying *all* these scrolls. Wow. So the grand total now escalates thanks to discounts: 900+65+150+500-70 => 1545gp. Oswen tries to barter a bit! She offers a bottle of the elven wine; flat persuasion 16+0 -> they don't need that, but do round it down to 1500gp (or as they put it - "3 Sembian Platinum bars!"). The shop staff gather around to watch as we pay; this is a very high value transaction. Kindle tries to look menacing!

It takes a while to weigh out 1500gp!

We leave and, needing some privacy, head back to our hired room to copy spells and look at the notes we took with the abstract sigils on it that we *think* would get us to Baldur's Gate.

23 levels of spells to copy, will cover *everything* except the L5 she can't yet do, and still leave her with 7 other levels' worth of ink. And it takes less than an hour in a reading room while the others get a bit bored, but Inafina actually seems fascinated to see the ink flowing and sparkling, with the sheer speed of it all. It's mesmerising. Kindle and Bel both take the time to do an audit of their equipment; Kindle sorts out a bit of mess that'd built up in the portable hole; he climbs into it, in fact, occasionally popping his head out to hand things to Bel!

Oswen, Arcana 10+11->21, has turned her attention to the teleportation runes. She figures out there's a sort of cipher there. She's *quite* sure it will work but can't check! The magic is beyond her for now.

### Midday

Quite a morning! We look for a cafe for a short break, before going to the temple. There's a courtyard cafe near it, we recall, and end up there for a while, with a light lunch. Barley and fish, almost soupy, with bread. Oswen shows people the sorts of spells; Inafina and Kindle understand what they can do, but not how, while Bel's much more into it, as he understands more aspects of the magic and, indeed, understands some of the spells in full. Oswen uses Sending for Rundar, over at the library, asking if he can meet us there; and, he does.

At the temple to the God Of Knowledge (Oghma), we manage to find the same priest as last time. They'd offered to refund the cost if we passed on the knowledge we gained. We give Rundar and the priest the whole story. Then Oswen shows Rundar her best-guess Baldur's Gate runes - does he think they'll work? "It's anybody's guess, really!" he says - not the most comforting response!

The priest agrees that we can come back in the morning for a scheduled teleportation casting; we'll do our best to verify the runes in the mean time. We already have paid, basically; the priest gives us a metal token so whoever is "on duty" tomorrow (he's not here) will know we get the casting as-is. Oswen perception 2+1! 3 only. She notices nothing unusual.

Oswen's not sure how to verify a teleportation circle sequence and evidently, neither is Rundar. We retreat to another cafe! While the others have drinks, Oswen frowns at the runes. Kindle offers some Guidance; this time, Oswen's getting the hang of it a bit more; 17+11 -> 28, Guidance only adds 1; Bel offers some inspiration too; d8 -> only a 2. The total is 31, though. That's very high.

She shouts out, "Oops!"

"What do you mean 'oops'?!" exclaims Kindle. Two runes were backwards! Well, at least we'd have been able to visit somewhere new... Or the spell would simply fail.

### 2pm

We get to the main library. We still have the Far Realm books we've not quite finished yet on the skimmer, and librarians there can help us find additional books too. But most importantly, we have those redacted writings from the recovered information about the crashed galleon. The researchers immediately tell us that this is not here; it's in the *museum* archive and might even be considered a state secret. To access those, you need to go to the Library Of Congress is the only way to access them. It requires a special application to access state secrets, understandably.

There's one thing we might be able to work out, from the description - where was it from? The researchers help us. Investigation: ADV, yet another nat 20 + 8 -> 28, once again, Oswen aces the investigation! An "Astral Galleon", constructed usually in shipyards around planar hubs, of which Sigil is best known. And with this, we realise that this kind of ship isn't made on a specific plane (though there are some unusual vessels which are rather more uniquely identifiable).

We do find one thing of particular interest:

* It talks about how these vessels are able to move from plane to plane
* These vessels cannot travel in the Far Realm
* There is in fact no known conduit that such a vessel could use to get there
* So how come it had that shard on board?

So, it looks like we need to focus on that shard. That's the thing Roslof didn't let go; that's the enigma on board the galleon. We need a sorcerer.

The staff say they're not the right people to ask. Scroll shops - no, sorcerers don't need scrolls. That's a wizard thing. Likewise, schools or universities. The temples have people who gain power from their god - paladins, clerics and the like. We start to check books on sorcery, flat investigation, 14+8->22.

* It's innate magic.
* Essentially the academic books describe it as "unknown".
* There isn't too much research written on sorcery academically, then, for that same reason; it's innate, not taught; it isn't rigorous/written.
* Similarities with druids, but druids channel different kinds of magic; a different expression of it.
* The most "out there" sorcerers are the most powerful - they have somehow **reached out and touched the Far Realm**. Psychic, psionic, generally terrifying magic; almost insanity. Such people are very, very rare in Sembia and Cormyr. There are notes that they might be found in more "barbaric" (!) nations.
* In general, sorcery tends to be frowned upon. They tend to keep a low profile, with one exception; those who **appear to be touched by the divine**; some have a connection to extraplanar magic from the "positive" planes; celestial; they can act as priests and people might never know any better. Really, their magic is indistinguishable in observation from magic given by petitioning a god.

If we want the most dangerous, but also the most likely to understand - we need those "dark" sorcerers. Those who can cast storms, or cause general chaos! And it sounds like **we're going to the right place** - if this kind of thing is going on anywhere, as far as we can tell from these books, Baldur's Gate could be as good a place as any to find it out.

It's scary to think that there are 'secrets', then, considered too dangerous to be open? The librarians suggest that perhaps it was more of a matter of privacy; perhaps it's less about the objects, but more about, say, the body of an important person being there and for some reason the identity has to be hidden. Oswen's not too convinced by all that. The arguments don't answer the question. She's not debating that this choice, based in knowledge and wisdom, might not be correct; she's just realising that she has no way to assess the extent or nature of such choices.

The library staff are happily debating this with our party! At one point, the librarian brings back some things that used to be classified, but were declassified later. It's a location of weapons, munitions and magical items for the defence of Sembia during the war with Cormyr. It seems reasonable, of course, that this would be kept private at the time. And at least it was eventually opened, and not kept pointlessly private forever.

Well, whatever any of this means, Oswen finds herself with more interest in, and enthusiasm for, a visit to Baldur's Gate than she did before.

The librarian asks - if we find out - **do they have libraries there? What kind of information do they store?** "I'd love to know how cities like that operate, without the existence of a nation! What's the social contract used to create cohesion and adherence, to the societal good? I've always been curious."

### 5:30pm

It's been an interesting discussion but the library is closing! Looks like an early evening dinner for us. A group of people are gathering in an area nearby; a growing group with some music playing. It looks interesting, so we go and investigate.

People have gathered around a small stage. A woman steps up onto it. Behind here are some big banners: "**Lacon**", and underneath, "**Sembia United**". Oswen, history 23. Nope. No memory of that... Is this person on stage "Lacon"? Or is that a movement, or even a place... Oh! Wait. Councillor Perdue mentioned the name - she wasn't paying close attention. It's a person, then. And this, then, is a growing movement that must be opposing Perdue's movement.

"...we are one! There is no Sembia without *all* the people. We are fine as we are! We do not need an army. We do not need missions to other places. People come *here* because we *are* the centre of commerce!..."

And so it goes on. She's certainly confident! Seems to be appealing to a sort of "national pride" view. But TL;DR when Oswen asks about compromise, Lacon suggests that this is what the Senate is for - while Perdue would "gate" the Senate for people with specific qualifications. Crowd hecklers argue that "this is because we want to be led by people who know what they're doing, not just the popular!" - some booing - Lacon, to her credit, seems to try to calm things.

"We do not need to be a perfect society, but we do need to be a just society - for *all* Sembians. Not just the smart, the rich, or even the right. For *all*."

Someone heckles. "If that's true, why do you keep secrets? Perdue would open the archives! What are you afraid of!"

Things start to get worked up. Oswen asks Kindle to push forward and get her onto the stage, with Bel in tow. Inafina lights up her staff too and starts to dance as Oswen asks Bel to play something distracting - something catchy - just to knock the crowd off guard, distract them and stop the escalation. As Oswen starts some brightly coloured, shifting minor illusions, Quick-thinking Kindle casts something we've not seen before - Calm Emotions, using his holy symbol. He's targeting the most riled-up part of the crowd. Bel, with dancing Inafina and illusionist Oswen's help, 23 performance; it's working, but a few are resisting Kindle's spell so Inafina glides off stage, slips between people and using her great strength is able to firmly but calmly move people apart (ACRO 17+8->25).

Lacon calls for calm! "Selgonians! Do not let philosophies divide us physically! We *must* talk about these things, yes; but talk about them with civility. We are a civilised people; there is no need for violence or insults. I stirred your passions more than I intended and, for this, I am truly sorry. It is a beautiful night - do not let this tarnish a wonderful winter's evening! We have food. We have music. Let us find what we have in common and focus on the things that keep us together."

The rally was brief but firey!

Lacon - bodyguards flanking - comes to thank us for helping. "I hope it wasn't too alarming that we jumped on stage like that" says Oswen. "I trust my retinue. I never feel threatened - not in my own city."

We have food and chatting, Oswen deliberately initially steering conversation similar to that with Perdue; steering perhaps more towards the issues of secrets; Oswen helps Kindle ADV insight 21; is she also hiding things? She's determined to convince people things are good the way they are. No interest in change. Very proud of Sembia and Selgaunt. She believes it all, rightly or wrongly. She thinks the government they have, for all its flaws, is the right collection of compromises. So she's not hiding anything. *But* - it is very rehearsed. A seasoned politician.

Oswen trusts this person, to a degree. So we lay it on the line - the short version of why we're here. The classified galleon secrets. Why is this kept a secret?

Perdue wonders if it's related to a recent thing that happened and a lot of people were not informed to avoid panic - Sembia was threatened, there was a war; powerful entities at the border; but it was dealt with "the way we have always dealt with these things as Sembia - we have just one thing we have to do at Senate, and that is to look after our people - so we did whatever we needed to, to keep the people safe. We hired mercenaries, we made deals where we needed to, we asked for help and we paid for assistance to lead the threat away. All of these things are in the archives."

The conversation goes to and fro. We have to submit an application; there's no way around that. And a councillor cannot shortcut it - even if they submitted it in person, it's supposed to be handled equally by all. Lacon does at least offer to meet us before her council session at **7:30am tomorrow, Senate Hall** to help us fill in and place the application.

Inafina, perception 23. She hears it... As we start to leave... Someone moving, from behind a food stall. Surreptitious. They sidle up to us! All cloak-and-dagger like - they here we're looking for information... And it's a Perdue play. We should give our story to him, so he can pass a motion to pass into law the information we seek. It might be freed as soon as - well, Perdue wants to act immediately. If we presented our case and stood on the floor of the senate, we could do it tomorrow! It could be voted on and might even be law in a matter of a day or two.

He makes the whole hard sell; no more lies, no more secrets; we don't even know the extent of what's hidden. He even hands us four buttons - they have Perdue on them! Badges.

Oswen politely thanks the chap, asks where we might find Perdue if we want to take him up on that offer; he's in Selgaunt; he'll be at the Senate Hall too. 

The mysterious individual leaves. Inafina spins around to Oswen to speak but Oswen just says - "We aren't doing it. It feels dirty to me too. I'm not going to try and rush political change for an entire nation for something about which I only became aware barely a day ago!"

Anyway, there's more debate, but we know one thing - go to bed early! Early start tomorrow. Oswen suggests taking watch; just in case...

* Kindel: 13
* Bel: 7
* Oswen walkes up Bel: 12
* Inafina wakes up Oswen: 19

...and Inafina, apparently on a pointless duty given the quiet night prior, hears sounds in a neighbouring room; someone getting up, coughing. Then footsteps in the hallway outside. A shadow at the door - our room is dark; the hallway is list; then there's a sound. Something slid under the door. She immediately springs up to run for the door and yanks it open. A human is scurrying towards the staircase. "Who goes there? Show yourself!" she calls out. The person turns. An older man, 50s. "Oh. Um. A delivery. Just a delivery for your room!" - insight only 9, she believes it! He has a uniform, of sorts.

Inafina apologises and checks the letter. It's a beautiful envelope; official senate stationary, it seems. There's a wax seal. It is addressed to the room number, so Inafina opens it. **"Welcome to Selgaunt. Crazy city isn't it? Quite the rally last night, too! I remember the last time we spoke in Ordulin. I hear that the bureaucracy is causing problems for you. I am here to change that. I will be at the main concourse tomorrow morning before Senate is called to the Floor. I would love to help you get the information that you need to do your job. Please meet me in the morning. It will be my pleasure to help you."** - it's signed, of course, Perdue.

It's not addressed to us - it's addressed to the room. So - (1) he doesn't remember our names and *(2) someone followed us to the room*.



## Day 12
### 6:45am

Inafina wakes everyone. She shows them the note, pointing out the implications of the address. This is a bit shocking; we were followed, but we were watching for it. "We never miss anything!" claims Bel. "Well, not strictly true..." says Oswen "...but it certainly doesn't help with my trust issues. That's dirty fighting."

We put on our posh clothes, grab some breakfast and head to Senate Hall via one of the trams.

It is being lit beautifully, the first thing to be struck by the rays of the winter sun. We get to a kind of concourse and see a large group of people gathered. Senator Lacon is alighting from another tram and waves to us. She greets us but then says - "wait, what is that!?" - and realises the group is something to do with Perdue. She looks unimpressed. "That's against the rules... You're not supposed to gather a politi - sigh; never mind. Shall we go through them or around?"

"Let's go around" says Oswen, but WIS save - 16+4 -> 20 - doesn't mention last night's events with Perdue. She thinks better of it for now.

The group do see us and then a group of them start to walk in our direction. "Ah! Yes! My dear friends from Ordulin!" shouts out Perdue.

Lacon and Perdue start to argue. Oswen is addressed by name, to her surprise. She politely but firmly tells him she's thankful for being reached out to by his representative, but not through eavesdropping; thankful for his carefully written letter, but not by it being delivered by following us; and thankful for his enthusiasm today, but not for being pressured through his group and mentioning things lie how he spent all night drawing up his petition.

He does back off, but still walks with us chatting. This seems intended to try and put Lacon on edge (and probably works!)

At the Hall of Records, we get the paperwork and Lacon helps us a bit fill it in; Perdue, to his credit, helps too. We sign it. Then Lacon signs it too - and Perdue, too!

We are advised to check in whenever passing through Selgaunt again. Otherwise, a letter is sent to the address written down (which Oswen put in at the Ordulin library, C/O Leonidas). We've no idea how long it'll take. Processing times are highly variable.

We thank them both; pleasantries are exchanged; we head off, towards the temple district.

"That was... Strange" says Bel.

"I'm not sure I trust him" says Kindle (insight 25).

"Very awkward" says Inafina, unsure (insight 10).

Oswen notes Inafina's uncertainty, but Kindle's conviction; Perdue did nothing *wrong* yet there's something not *right*.

As we walk, we start to hide away valuables as best we can; the helm goes into the backpack and so-on. We make weaponry more visible.

At the temple, now in full sunshine, we hand over our metal token to the person in charge. This is a younger priest. He is being very careful with the spell, perhaps not so familiar with it; but his fastidious care is reassuring. It takes almost two minutes to get it all together. Then he calls us over; "Are you ready?" "Yes. Thank you very much for your help." "I find it is helpful to keep your eyes on the ground, then lift your eyes up at the other end!"

The last rune is drawn; seconds before this, Bel casts Disguise Self; to our surprise, he looks human - one of the people that were at the rally last night.

The runes light up; we are hurried into the ring. We step in...

(Kindle and Oswen follow the advice, Oswen thinking it might be a bit of a rough teleport given the warnings he gave; Inafina is sure it'll be fine - her balance is good! Bel likewise.)

...Inafina, CON save 14+1 - it's rough, indeed! Bel is fine too, but we agree the young priest is definitely still learning. But everyone has to learn, and he took great care to get it right - and, here we are.

### Baldur's Gate, some time around 8am

Curiously, it's pitch black! Kindle casts Dancing Lights. We are in a small room no more than some 15ft square. it's cramped! We stand upon a small teleportation circle, inscribed on the ground. There is a pile of boxes in the corner - this feels more like a store room than anything else. There's a door, of course; Inafina puts her ear against it. ADV perception 23. Slight sounds on the other side; distant; voices. She motions to Bel to indicate he should come and try to take a peek (he has Darkvision). Kindle turns off the lights. He has a quick look... Just a corridor.

Oswen says, "Well, we were invited; I'm not sure if we should be cautious or not, but I say, we just stroll out there and find those voices you heard!" - so, she does exactly that.

The corridor has torch light. It seems to have quite a few corridors off either side, or maybe servant's quarters? On the end, a flight of stairs going up. Up she goes. At the top, there's no door; it just opens out into a kitchen area. It's quite loud up close - many sounds of food being made. There's a rather rotund half-orc that Oswen sees first, at the main stove; a female voice says, "Four eggs! Four eggs, toast, and two tomato!" - the half-orc acknowledges. So we're in a restaurant or something like that.

Oswen tries a guess - "Sorry to bother you, is this the Inn Of Last Chances?!"

Without skipping a beat, the orc says; "Have you guys just arrived? No. This isn't the Inn. Stay on the stairs and out of the way. I just need to do this order!"

Eventually the half-orc gets someone to cover his work on the stove and talks to us; he gives us directions. "Head outside and through the Crew Territories, you'll have to make it through Heapside and up to the Eastway. You need to make it to the Eastway! Right next to the Basilisk Gate - you can't miss it - where everyone comes into the city! Have you got weapons?" Oswen nods. "You're going to want to wear them openly. You're not in the nice part of town, my love..." "Thanks for the warning. I don't suppose you have any city maps, do you?" He thinks for a minute... "You're very green, aren't you! Well... You're in the edge of Eastway right now. Between Heapside and Eastway. This is the **Elfsong Tavern**! The Inn you want is right inside the Basilisk Gate - East side of the city." Oswen thanks him. "I'm sure we can figure it out! Where's your front door?!" "Ooooh no! Not the front door, you don't. You don't want people seeing you! Head out of the delivery entrance" - he points - "and remember, keep your wits close - and your valuables closer."

Duly advised, we make our way towards that doorway but before we exit we do stow valuables and so-on and do our best to show what weapons we have. Oswen checks that Orvil is OK with flying up to spot the Basilisk Gate given the apparent danger; he is happy to do it, since he thinks it's safer up in the air than down on the ground!

We exit into a very narrow back alley. It's wet and smells bad. There's someone passed out in a stupor in a back doorway. Buildings around are some 3 storeys high. Shingle roofs above, plants growing out of gutters. It's noisy - the city must be busy. Someone skulking up the alley, ignoring us, walks past, conspicuously keeping to themselves. Oswen sends up Orvil to spot the gate. Two gates - the one to the East, which is what we saw via the golden key; and another, to the South-East of where Oswen stands. That's less busy. These both lead to outside-walls regions East. To the West/South is a big port.

Orvil, lucky perception roll 21 with his stats. He sees some really large birds, almost like vultures, flying towards him; but then they seem to think better of it. Perhaps his highly acrobatic flying as a hawk made them think he couldn't be caught. He sees fighting on the streets. One person is being mugged some distance away! There's kind of a traffic jam both outside and inside the Basilik Gate, but outside is harder. It looks like no animals are brought into the city; all the horses etc. stay outside. No carriages either. Some hand-pulled carts move slowly along larger streets. There's some kind of quite large market close by with a large statue of some kind of man in the middle. It's on a main road leading to the gate. He flies close and spots the Inn Of Last Chances, on the town-side (inside) of the gates.

Orvil flies back and reports.

Well... We're early. The day we were given is, in fact, today; but the time was later. We confer. Perhaps the Inn is a place to have as a base. It's very busy up there; lots of crime, doubtless, but perhaps we'll be a bit more lost in the noise? Certainly this back-alley is a bad plan. We figure we'll try to get to the main road and to the market.

D20->12. As we exit the alley we notice someone at the other end of it that's been eyeing us. Inafina calls back, "What's the matter, never seen a Harengon before?!"

Whoever it is scowls and leaves from their end of the alley. Whatever they wanted to do, they seem to have thought better of it.

This big street is busy. People mostly walk three-abreast, sometimes moving aside for carts. Sidewalks are narrow but people seem to ignore them anyway, walking on the road just as happily as the sidewalk. Buildings lining this main road seem in better condition and we can, now, see clearly down this street to the docks and sea. We get shouted at for blocking the way, so we start walking East-ish.

It's oppressive; busier and busier... Street signs kind of make sense but some are just large business signs, hand-painted, that cover some of them. We learn the other gate is **Cliff Gate**. There's a sign in a more formal "font" saying, "Upper City" too. Perception rolls are - not great!

* Oswen 5 (she's too short)
* Inafina 7 (it's too noisy)
* Bel - similar
* Kindle - high.

Kindle warns us - some people in the crowd have taken an interest in us and are tailing us. We go "on alert" and get ready for either a show of strength or a fight. We get to the edge of the market square and Kindle wants to prove it - if we walk into the market and visit essentially random stalls, he will be confident. We of course agree to his plan. The statue in the middle is actually quite glorious! It is of a bald-headed human wearing chain-mail, holding... A... *Hamster?!* We decide to show that we're tourists and check that out.

"Heroes Of Baldur's Gate - The Mighty Minsk And Heroic Boo"

...not really any the wiser but Kindle checks carefully to see if we were followed here; yep; and what's more, we're being flanked. Oswen sends up Orvil to see if she can spot, from above, a way to avoid or confront. The best option seems to be to confront. Three either side. Insight 9, Oswen doesn't have a preference. There maybe 15 stalls here. One group is next to a stall that just has jewellery; the other next to pots and pans. The latter could be makeshift weapons. She says, "Let's go! Confrontation time!" and leads her party to the three near the jewellery stall. The other group speeds up. Oswen calls out, "Watch the flank, the other three are coming in fast". She casts Mage Armour.

The other group gets in quickly; they sidle up near Bel and Inafina. One presses up against Oswen - with a little dagger. Oswen is told to make no sudden moves! She calmly says back, "You have *no idea* who you're dealing with. You think someone with no apparent weapons would be stupid enough to walk these steets?" "Oh, we know *exactly* who we're dealing with. Come peacefully down to this side-alley! Just come with us and - y'know - let's not cause a ruckus!"

The nice old lady at the stall next to us says, "Oh, good morning dear! Can I interest you in anything?"

Oswen says, "I don't suppose you have anything to help defend against this knife that this rather unpleasant gentleman has in my ribs, do you?!" - the lady backs away and the assailant's tone changes. "I *really* wish you hadn't done that!"

They start trying to grapple. He gets 16, so he grabs, but Oswen gets ACRO 24. She wriggles free. As for Inafina; she's used a Ki point for Patient Defence, but either way, the assailant gets a "hit". Her ACRO roll is only 8+8->16; and another 21 for the counter, so she's grappled. Kindle avoids being grappled altogether. Bel is grappled too. Initiative:

* Inafina 19
* Kindle 16
* Oswen 13
* Bel 11

The one how tried to grapple Kindle looks him in the eye; "Come with us!" and Kindle says, "No! Let everyone go! You't just grab people in a public place!"

People in the crowd around are starting to see what's going on and are backing away. The lady at the stall sweeps up her stall by grabbing entire table cloth, folding it and retreating!

Inafina tries to break the grapple. Nat 3! Only 11 ACRO. It's unsurprisingly not enough (c.f. 15). She wants to use Burning Hands but it's far too busy and she'd hit a lot of innocent people (and besides, she tried to escape rather than attacking).

Kindle casts L3 Spirit Guardians, calling upon halfling bakers, chefs and inn keepers! They flit around, brandishing rolling pins, pots and knives. He asks them to protect his party, stall keepers and passers-by; they are "non-hostile". As for the six assailants - go for it! "Let my friends go or there will be no turning back from this" he warns. "I will not let you harm them!" - the guardians roll high for 22 potential radiant damage. WIS saves all round.

Just a second later, one of the assailants (i.e. next in turn), one of the non-grapplers, skinnier than some of the others with a satchel and belt full of knives; he gets hit hard by the spirits. He's very badly injured. He tries to disengage and get away - "Fine! Let - let them go! They don't want to talk! This is not the way! Call off your spirits!" Another, in half-plate armour, taller, bigger, with a large war hammer of sorts, backs away; the four thugs let everyone go, to our surprise. They step back a bit. People in the market scatter even further at the sight of the spirits and the thug retreat.

Inafina is very annoyed (mostly bruised ego).

Oswen casts L4 Banishment on the person who had the knife on her, sort of to prove a point. CHA 17 save. Gets a 16; vanishes. Pop! She calls to the skinny one; "If you don't want the same fate, tell us what's going on. Why did you attack? Speak up, man!"

They keep retreating because Kindle has the spirits up. Kindle tells the spirits to back off. Oswen says, "You can run, but you won't get away unless you answer my question!"

"We were asked! We were asked to follow you and pass you a message."

"What message?"

"I can't do it *here*..." - but digs into his satchel and pulls out the envelope, holding it at arm reach. Inafina snatches it and reads it.

> "**Enemies are gathering at the gate. It may already be too late. Do we stay or do we flee? The end has come. Don't you see? We must abandon our homes. Bring only those you cherish and save the ancient tomes. Our world will be remade in fire - renewed and reborn, the entire. We, the only who can resist, must retreat to that place beyond, which bends only to Her will, the fortress city of Sigil.**" It is signed by *Morden Kainen*.

She gives it to Oswen. Oswen reads it. Oswen raises an eyebrow. The skinny group leader says, "We were told to look out for you!" - and throws a folded piece of paper down on the ground. Unfolded, it's a rough drawing of the four of us. Oswen drops concentration on Banishment to return the thug to this plane. She says, "Is this some kind of joke? Who gave you that paper?" "I've never seen anything like it before - it floated above the ground, grey face, long hair, appeared in the fireplace of the **Blushing Mermaid** and it stopped time and gave this to me and paid me this!" - he shakes a bag of coins. "I'm just doing the job I was paid to do."

Oswen nods, and says, "Next time, try not doing it at knifepoint." She points to Kindle and says, "Patch him up a bit, could you?" - Kindle drops his spirits and casts Cure Wounds. Then Oswen says, "If this is legitimate, there's nowhere to run. But I suggest you make what peace you can, and spend your remaining time well."

This freaks them out. "We'll split the pay!" they say. "We need to go!" - then, "You're crazy. You're all crazy!"

Oswen shows Bel and Kindle and says, "I wasn't kidding. If this is real, then what I felt in the Far Realm is real, and *we* might be the 'who can resist' and able to travel to another plane somehow, but most of the people in this city - or back at home, including Leonidas - cannot do that. We need to get to the Inn Of Last Chances."

As we start to move on, we see some kind of city guard of some kind - two members - walking into the market. Then someone points in the direction of the commotion. They approach quickly. "You there! Explain yourself!" - they point at Kindle. "We've had reports that you summoned undead!"

Oswen laughs. "Oh, I'm sorry! We thought we'd do some performing. We sometimes do street performances. Us and six others of ours - oh, they left, I'm sure you can ask the stallholders - we were enacting a scene. Look!" - Bel weighs in to help. As Bel is talking, Oswen casts Minor Illusion. "See? It's just illusion!" - Bel, deception 22. It's enough but the guards are grumpy. "Don't cause any trouble! We don't like disturbances in this city. We've got our eye on you!" - but they seem focused on Kindle. Bugbear life.

We move on. It doesn't take long, despite the busy streets, to reach the wide causeway running parallel to the city walls and we can get to the Basilisk Gate. We keep close to building walls to keep away from the worst of the traffic. Orvil knows where the inn is though and helps guide us by "thinking" to Oswen.

The gate towers above the 25-ft tall wall; the basilisk statues either side are really huge. There's far more city beyond the gates, but more ramshackle and cramped apart from the wide highway leading to the gate. Guards at the gate seem to be collecting tolls. We don't have any paperwork or similar, but we don't see anyone else with paperwork either. Those "tolls" might be going straight into the pocket!

The inn is unassuming, except for its position so close to this gate. It's tucked against the city walls. 3 storeys, as we saw; the top is at the level of parapets atop the walls. It's quite narrow though. A door, a wide bay window on one side, a small window on the other.

We go in.

The entrance opens into a small dining/waiting/sitting room in that bay window space, with a front desk, small fireplace and a couple of tables where some people are sat with drinks. There's a large bathroom down here too. Stairs at the back lead up. Oswen goes to the front desk; an older gentleman lowers spectacles and looks down. "Good morning... We're..." - he looks the party up and down - "...a room for four? It's very early. I'll have to charge you extra!" "How much extra?" "Half a day!" "How much is that?" "How many nights?" "One, I suppose!" - he looks disapproving. "I see. How many beds?" "Four!" "Second floor. Dormitory level. Or a room on the third floor. That'll cost more. 2 gold." Oswen makes a show of looking like that's a lot of money; on the dorm floor, each bed is only 2sp. "We need our privacy, if you know what I mean. It'll have to be the third floor." "You have your own toilet!" "Well that's something!" - we give him 2 gold pieces in exchange for a brass key.

We get escorted up by what might be the man's wife. Room 16, apparently. Top floor, at the back.

The third floor is a lot of steps given the quite high ceiling height. The lady checks the room; looks relieved; it's ready, in fact. She wasn't sure, clearly!

The room faces north. The city wall looks large and the window is easily reached from up there - not quite as secure as we might like but it'll have to do. Once we've some privacy we all study the note. What does it mean?

Bel notes that it rhymes. "Amateur!" he says!

The biggest question is - why us? We don't trust that this was written by the claimed author. But they seem to be giving up, planning to leave. Oswen doesn't subscribe to that - she would not abandon Leonidas. Sooner go down fighting than run and hide!

We will have no answers unless our contact at the Golden Vault can help.

We don't want to get involved in more crime or city guards. This seems too important. So, we hunker down and rest up here. Oswen throws all the tricks at it; Detect Magic - not magical; the paper and the ink is certainly very high quality. Spell ink! A very expensive choice! Identify - it's a letter. Not magical. She knew that. Investigation - dirty 20; this was not written in one go. The handwriting changes a bit, as if from a different day. A different writing "session". The "Do we stay or do we go" was written first. The more fearful second part came later, so it *is* answering its own question. The second half script is written in a more hurried way.

If this is deception, it's good; the two part writing, the hurried script answering the question in a dark way, the use of expensive materials...

(Oswen uses Arcane Recovery to get back her L4 spell from earlier, too).

There are no clocks we can hear in Baldur's Gate, unlike Ordulin. So we're not sure what time it is! We try to keep track, so that we're ready for our meeting - but then, a note is slid under the door. Oswen calls out, "You could just knock, you know!" - and opens the door rather than picking up the note first. She wants to see how it is. It's the man on the desk from downstairs. "Oh, sorry. Thanks for the note."

The note just says, "**Sorry for the runaround. When you're ready, come meet me in the cellar**".

The *cellar?!*

We arm ourselves (!) and collect all our belongings, then make our way downstairs - and out, as the man at reception points downwards, to the back of the building. The bathrooms are there, but there's also a back door, slightly ajar. We check that. Set into the rear yard are horizontal bifold cellar doors. We open them up and head down.

Gentle lamplight on a table. Beer kegs along one side (but this is isn't a tavern, it's an inn...?). Some food, big bags, commercial, against a wall; there's a passageway, too, so perhaps this is part of a wider underground network used by other businesses too.

There, at the table, is Eggsy.

Next to him is a well-dressed, middle aged man who looks scholarly. Not Morden Kainen! Both stand at our arrival.

Eggsy greets us. "I didn't know that you'd be here so soon!" The other introduces himself as **Keenan**. "A pleasure to meet you. Though I wish it were under better circumstances!"

"No kidding!" says Oswen and shows Eggsy the note. "What's *this?*"

Keenan takes it and examines it. He asks us to take a seat while he pulls things out of a case he has. He starts setting up strange glass vials, drips and contraptions that he seems to use to analyse the letter somehow. After a while he looks surprised... "This looks authentic! But why would *he* have direct contact with you...? Oh! I see! Well, the briefing I had in mind might not be that useful after all! Let me explain..."

* Morden Kainen is kind of a founding member / patron of the "Order Of The Golden Vault"
* Keenan is our "handler" - was to hand us information pertaining to Oswen's vision (relayed by Eggsy)
* He hands us a sort of journal - "You can read that in your own time"
* This is the (authentic) writings and instructions of the last agent who investigated this mystery
* "The mystery of the visions" - visions of doom - filed under "god of secrets" (!) - 'borrowed' from the Harpers
* But the Harpers do good work on *this* world and the issue goes beyond that

"How do you feel about a trip off-world?" asks Keenan.

"What happens to time?" asks Oswen.

"A good question! Where we are going, we hope to be somewhat *outside* of the river of time! We could, in essence, re-enter it at different points if we know how. Never *back*, but perhaps a smaller or larger distance into the future."

"What happened to the 'last agent' who wrote this journal?"

"That agent - our understanding is - has - left us... They did not survive. Flip to the end of the journal... He gets captured. He had infiltrated a cult... The journal got rescued."

So we understand - this isn't just "steal an amulet". It's more serious.

Keenan hands us a key. "Don't rush into this one. Only when you're ready."

Oswen looks curious; she says, "According to *that* note, by one of your founder members no less, it's *already* possibly too late. Why we would wait? Define 'ready'."

Keenan thinks a while. "You might... Well, want to maybe be more equipped. Understand a bit more about the context of what's going on. Morden Kainen famously, at least according to rumour, is prone to melodrama."

"Well I should hope so, or the cause - whatever it is - is already lost. We have spent quite some time trying to read about planes and incursions and other things, but haven't really got very far. And Baldur's Gate doesn't strike me as a centre of academic excellence!"

They laugh. "Correct. But it *is* the..." (whispering) "...home to a very important gate. Why do you think this city is all about its gates? You may have seen Baldur's Gate, between the upper and lower city? But the real secret - the real Baldur's Gate - leads somewhere else entirely."

He does at least explain - things having been a bit obscure so far - that the key we have is our "next mission", lined up, which requires someone of "our skill". So that's not the "trip off world".

Ah, so that's how we prepare. The "trip off world" first, then key second.

We agree.

Keenan and Eggsy won't come. When we get 'there' (the "other side" of the 'gate'), we'll find ourselves in a very strange and wondrous place. Keenan hands us a small book. "If you open it and you look in it, you'll see a little gem. That will tell you where to go. It will show you the way." Oswen nods. "Thanks. So... Where's the gate?! To Sigil, I guess?"

Keenan gives her a quizzical look. "Hmmm. I see why Morden Kainen has taken an interest in you! Yes. You *must* keep this book on you. Take the gem out, hold it to your eye and make sure you're all holding hands when you walk through Baldur's Gate. Don't be stopped by anyone! You *must* walk *through* the gate."

Oswen says, "Thank you both. Seems like there's no time like the present, unless you know otherwise? We'll just head straight over!"

"Well then. Good luck!" says Keenan. "Good to see you again!" says Eggsy. "I hope we can work together on something soon."

We bid farewell and - rather confused! - head upstairs and back to the front desk of the inn. We give back our key; "Looks like we're not staying the night after all! But you can keep the gold." "What? No, at least have one gold back?" - so we accept.

So, now, we need to get up to the actual Baldur's Gate gate, with as little difficulty as possible. With Oswen and Orvil's help - Kindle, survival ADV 23. He knows how to look intimidating and stride purposefully while Oswen makes all the decisions on directions. She casts minor illusions and other distractions to make us look more serious!

### 7pm

Soon enough, we're the giant gate. It's still open, but there's a sign - gates close at 9. Plenty of time *but* we observe for a moment to observe that the guards are interested in. They just stand around chatting. When people approach from the outside, they're stopped and asked to show papers. In the other direction - not so. But we're on the outside!

Tricky. No papers. We decide to break into the upper city via flying over the wall, then walk out!

We head some distance away to a quiet bit of wall behind a building. Bel makes Oswen and Inafina invisible. Inafina uses her boots and Oswen uses a charge on her wings. The two of them invisibly fly over the wall and land, checking the distance, finding a good spot and then Oswen uses Message to let Bel know the direction and distance. Then Bel uses Dimension Door to pull himself and Kindle through. The pop through close to Oswen and Infina.

Now to test the theory! The book is opened, the gem removed; we join hands, Oswen on one end of the row so she has a free hand for the gem. We get to the gate, Oswen looks through the gem and we walk through.

The guards do notice us at the last minute - but seems surprised, perhaps because they don't recognise us! - "Good evening m'am...?" says one and starts to move to intercept, but Oswen and the others are striding purposefully. As she steps over the threshold she feels as if a bright light is surrounding her, *very* intense. Suddenly she feels like she's pulled upwards at an immense speed! Then there's a feeling of a dimension, mirror-imaged, split into two; then she sees a huge torus, hovering in the middle of two mountain peaks, impossibly sharp and thin, one mountain upside down as if reflected on a perfect lake. The movement briefly stops and it feels like she can see a far greater distance than either her own or Orvil's eyesight should ever allow. Everything very sharp, for hundreds of miles. Then, more brightness; she stumbles; we all kind of do; and now we're talking, having walked through a gate...

...into a small cemetery. Slightly askew tombstones, a tilted angel statue, a small crypt entrance with small garden with a few primroses and a strange vine covering all the walls.



## Sigil
### Day 12, not long after 7pm (Torril time)

Not quite what Oswen expected! Did walking through the gate "backwards" bring us to the wrong place? Or was it as simple as...

She turns 180 degrees. The cemetery has its own gate entrance and there's a street beyond. She points, says, "Ah, there I think!" and walks out of the cemetery and onto the street. As she does, she doesn't look through the gem, wondering if perhaps this is bidirectional. She asks everyone to try and keep in mind how we might return to this location in future, as it could be our only way back.

The arch we walk through from the cemetery is quite beautiful; marble, covered in carvings of stylised faces and animals. There's a low wall with a wrought iron fence covered in vines around the edges of what is, in fact, a very small cemetery; too big for one family, perhaps, but still seems like it might be a privately owned thing. There are some statues and a tiny crypt in the middle up some stairs. Maybe 20 graves.

The street is highly decorated, from pavings to lampposts. The paving stones of the street are carved into shapes and made of different kinds of stone, almost a mosaic. The pavements either side have much smaller tiles, where these tiles *are* mosaics - beautiful artworks all along. There are similarly beautiful houses - wide, two-winged estates, high ceilings, two storeys or more, balustrades and gardens; castle-like manors, four storeys or more, with turrets and flags flying; a few more humble dwellings here and there.

Crystalline glass carriages are being pulled by pegasus, or animals we don't even recognise, as people alight, very well dressed. We realise almost nobody walks on the streets. As we get our "eye in" we realise there's a feeling of a gentle curve to everything. Oswen looks upwards to some very light cloud, with a soft light, a bit like early morning or late evening. A Fey Wild sort of vibe... Diffused, but no sun. Through those thin clouds it takes her a moment - and then she sees, and is dizzied by it for a moment, an upside-down city up above! And it's everywhere; it folds down to the sides, too, in all directions. It's as if we're on the inside of a wagon wheel, looking up towards the hub only instead of seeing spokes, we see the inside of this strange space, as if the wagon wheel's rim were hollow.

Oswen looks to Kindle, worried that he might be very disorientated given his particularly large stature. He is fine and explains later, that it's a bit like flying. He does reach out a hand to steady himself on Inafina's shoulder for a moment, even so.

Weirder still, the road we're on traverses the inside of this tube's circumference - the 'shortest circle' - rather than along the circumference of the wagon wheel. The entrance from the cemetery ran in *that* direction. If we want to walk along that inner wheel circumference, we'll need to find a road going that way - perpendicular to that one - as both ahead and behind, on the *sides* of this road, are estates.

Oswen asks Orvil to see if he can make any sense of it while in flight, or if navigation is just too confusing. He flies up and realises that the "hollow rim" diameter isn't too big, while the wheel itself is quite large. More strange, though, is a realisation that roads aren't on gentle curves - houses and estates cause all kinds of steps and straight edges, with what could well be quite awkward transitions for where, he thinks, "down" must be.

The area we're in is clearly very wealthy though! Oswen connects, looks through his eyes, and finds it even more confusing from the air because of the straight sections and has to give up trying to get an idea of direction. But she does at least recognise a few things in that moment of disorientation!

* Immediately around us, very beautiful estates, castles, chateaus and so-on
* Some very ornate *temples* in this area too
* All manner of different architectural styles; no apparent consistency
* Four buildings stand out - they're so large she's not even sure they are buildings at first; megastructures, we might say
* One is some kind of huge court, huge columns, 70ft at least but with an impression of just one storey, 30ft high pitched roof, marble and slate, ornate carvings everywhere - a large temple for giant-sized creatures
* Two more face each other; one looks like a huge Dwarven forge complex of some kind and the other is cold, granite, another compound or complex that is maybe some kind of town-within-a-town, filled with various small stone buildings and the odd fort, high walls, watch towers
* The fourth is the strangest; architecturally distinct from anything else, rising out of the overall district in a dark grey and rusty-steel colours, gothic style; a gothic stone wall, giant rusty wrought iron spires - some eight *hundred* feet wide, rising hundreds of feet too; then what looks like it is hanging above it, looking almost like a mace, but connected on a column - an upside-down citadel, as if that part has a different sense of up and down

Oswen relays that to her party, pointing things out if we can see them from where we stand.

Well, not much to make sense of! The gem will show us the way, said Keenan... So she looks through it. The gem though is, despite appearances to the contrary when held in the hand, strangely *not* translucent when looked through. In fact it's quite dark, but there's light from a specific point and she realises she can see that this indicates a direction. Orvil flies back in. We elect to keep our weapons handy, not hidden like we might in Waterdeep; and we'll walk. So, Oswen points - "we walk that way!"

"And how do we get through there?!" asks Bel.

Oswen lowers the gem. The direction is directly to the estate! But a little up. As if further along the inside 'edge' of the wheel. We need to get around the estate somehow. D20->5 as a luck dice... Hmmm, only the DM knows if that's good! Well, first, cross the road. But then almost immediately - there's a clopping noise and a **"watch out!"** - as turning a nearby corner and moving at speed - a Bariur, like a centaur, but more goat-like than horse-like. They stop just in time as Inafina darts back.

"Sorry!" calls Inafina.

"That's OK!" - the Bariur pulls an onion-shaped carriage. Oswen apologises; "We're new here, and not sure how to move around the place!" "I can help you! My name is **Alden**. I drive for **Tea Street Transit**! At your service! You can hire me by the mile, the hour, or the day."

"What sort of payment do you take?"

He has to think a while! "I think... We need to take metal." Oswen says, "Ah, we're familiar with paying with metal." "That's good! I'm from Isgard - I don't normally take payment in metal - but the company I'm working for does. We tend to trade in valour! Would you like to get in?"

We nod. "Yes please, I think - well, perhaps, by the hour?" "OK!" - he seems very happy - "That will be..." - and pulls out a leaflet, flips some pages and thinks - "...1 gold piece for an hour." We can pay as we go, too. So Oswen gives him a gold. "I've never seen one of these before! Well, this is **a great start to my first day!**" - and we learn this is "**The Lady's Ward**".

He discusses the route he guesses from our vague directions; we don't know any better, so we just go with it. We end up on a ramp leading up to a raised road, giving a vantage point of the area around. There is smalltalk. We learn that Sigil has very few permanent residents - probably 3/4 living here aren't residents. People come to "get things done; to meet on neutral territory; to escape the wrath of Gods. You'll be surprised how many people do that!" "So the gods can't reach here?!" "The Lady. She bans them from entering Sigil. Doesn't mean that their *agents* don't try to cause trouble, but there's a balance in this city. If anything goes too far, or too much influence is gained, well, the Lady - she steps in. You don't want that! You want her to be as uninvolved as you can possibly get her!"

He starts describing landmarks as we go. The big 70ft columned building is in fact a court. Well, *the* court, in a legal sense. There are other smaller ones, but this is the main one - the 'high' court. The **Fraternity Of Order** are based here. We get to the edge of the crazy gothic structure... Turns out this is a prison. If you have a run in with the Fraternity Of Order, you end up here. "It's where the **Mercy Killers** call home. You don't want *anything* to do with them! It never ends well for anyone when the Mercy Killers set their sights on you. No-one escapes justice." Oswen asks about the other two big buildings. "Kind of opposites of each other - peacekeepers called **The Harmonium** run the barracks. Across the road, those forges - that is the armoury. It's for the Harmonium to police the city." It seems *very* large for Oswen - which gives some idea of how large the city is be. "There isn't an official census, but estimated more than a million souls live on Sigil".

*A million!*

Oswen checks the gem again. We're headed the right way, but need to try and bear right. There's an area he hopes it will be in and an area he hopes it will not! So Alden will check back once we're close to the decision between the two. We end up coming close to the Armoury. As we go past, we see **The Great Foundry** - a whole bunch of smoke stacks, like a massive factory, nothing much Dwarven about *this* structure. We need to go further head... And Alden's cheer drops a bit. This is where he didn't want to go... "We are now entering the Lower Ward" he says. "Is this a dangerous bit of town?" "Well, not really - the Lower Ward is shrinking, but it can be a bit creepy; it's the industrial heart of the city, so without it, this entire place would fall apart. But we're not going into it, we're going *through* it."

There's a bit of smog. Wind seems to carry smoke away from Lady's Ward and into this Lower Ward area.

Various strange structures, some of completely alien architecture, including buildings that seem to be made entirely of metal plates in strange, biological-like shapes, or very intense perhaps-temples, 150ft high stone edifices in front, perfect geometric stone with a thin strip in the middle with a light. Inafina notices on the left some kind of extremely grand temple, but it is destroyed. A central dome must have been some 300ft high over huge columns, but it is partially collapsed. There are spires to the side with onion-shaped domes rising around 250mt. There are strange gold-painted rings, looking like portals, along with stairs going up as if a pyramid, some 150ft; there are two strange stone-arches several hundred feet look like they used to cross above it all - but again, these are smashed. Looking closer, it wasn't crushed, it looks like something exploded. There is activity here - lights, buildings occupied and scaffolding - it's under repair, but it will surely take a great many years. "It's up to us common folk to rebuild *that* - the **Athar** have taken it, the 'godless ones'. Some people call them names! The 'Defiers'... But they have a perspective, based on their life experiences. You'll find that everywhere in Sigil. A city with a lot of philosophical opinions about the nature of existence."

The gem still says - onwards!

It gets hard to see any distance in this area. The smog is quite bad. Inafina and Bel seem particularly sensitive to it, used to much cleaner air.

All of a sudden, we are over a chasm! It's startling. Bel asks if it's when the temple exploded. "Oh, who knows! They say that exploded then God Of Portals died." "Died?! A god died?" "Yes. Well, that's what they say. It was once a temple to **Aoskar**. The Athar who have taken it back are deliberately repurposing it, without rebuilding it fully, because they want a visual remember that gods can die. But *this* - this is **The Ditch**. You probably don't want to go down into the Ditch unless you are trying to do something very bad! It is also technically our only natural body of water. But it reeks... It waters are corrosive, a dumping ground for things people want forgotten or hidden." He whispers... "Some people say that the waters are a portal tributary to the River Styx!"

(The party don't really know what that reference means, but it seems pretty significant to Alden).

Next we reach a building that gives us the creeps! "Right, we are crossing over into **The Hive Ward** now. The one place the Harmonium tries to leave alone... Not sure what happened... I'll say this, it's the place with the most freedom! If anything happens to you, you'll probably end up over there - I just hope you don't." He points to strange floating weird nest-like objects with smoke coming off each, chimneys, but all spiked and barbed. Almost likes like a village, lots of connecting walkways, but in the low-level fog and smog it looks particularly creepy. "That's **the mortuary**! If you're not rich enough to have a private cemetery, and you haven't been murdered and dumped into the ditch, you'll end up here."

Oswen checks the gem. Mostly, to the right, it says. Alden finds an off-ramp to descend off the causeway. We realise we'd climbed a lot. The mortuary isn't a kind of domed nest with smaller nests floating around it; it's more of a mushroom, on a long stalk. Strange tendril-like shapes form what we'd seen as walkways above.

Alden asks if we have clothes to cover our mouths with from the smoke. We do our best... Apparently it's mostly just a specific thick layer of humid smog, like a thick wet cloud. Alden is trying to buck up our spirits, pointing out that we've seen the worst of the city! Most is much nicer.

The landscape below feels like - well, high density housing, low cost, but a lot of colour. Smaller buildings, some leaning a bit! Lots of people walk at street level; almost no carriages. A mixed group of all manner of people. The streets are wet, as if there has been recent rain. Magical signs glow all over (as if modern-day neon). Alden checks with Oswen on direction - he seems keen to take us right to the door! Oswen points up a street. The main street! We go along. He tells us about places as we go.

"This whole area is the **Gatehouse Night Market** - the smog layer makes it dark all the time. The area we're in right now within that is **The Greasepit** - but I kid you not, the best food I've ever had is in Sigil! If you don't eat animals - a cluster called The Vine, just over there... All vegetables."

Oswen is checking the gem frequently as we're clearly getting close. Then it shows a whole building, brightly lit, through the gem. Its door even glows. Excited, she says, "That's the one!" - Alden is surprised. "A strange place to go! Well, OK!" - above the door is a stylised lightning bolt, with a pearl at the bottom. "Why did you want - you could've just said you wanted to go to **Fell's Tattoos**? Oh! Of course, you didn't know that was what it was called."

He says he'll wait outside; we're not out of time yet.

We gather our things and go to the door. It's narrow but tall. There's no sign, so Oswen knocks, as this doesn't feel like a shop. No answer; cautiously, she pushes open the door.

We walk into a dimly lit but very clean room that feels a bit strange; there are a few sofas to sit on, some large and some small. One is just the right size for Oswen, while another is actually a bit too *big* to properly fit Kindle. Both are unusual. Various mirrors are placed around but there are no pictures of tattoos, which is strange. There's a circular doorway leading to a room in what we think is the back.

A tiefling walks out from the back room. Purple skin, long forked tail, huge curved horns, yet looks a bit shy, putting back on a shiny jacket; seems to have just got a tattoo. Walking behind is a 9ft tall, skinny, horned being, with a long face, silvery colour, silvery-bronze skin all over in fact, wearing a robe that drags on the ground. The tiefling thanks "Fell" for the tattoo. So, we know who the tall person is. Fell's horns are bit like ram horns in their curve and positioning, but he's otherwise hairless - not even eyebrows. A square-ish brow, long rectangular nose. His robe is supported by strange wide shoulder pads.

The tiefling leaves. He turns to us. Strange glyphs appear next to him. He looks quizzically at us. Oswen (*just*!) with Investigation 11, thinks that the glyphs must be some kind of communication. She struggles a while. They change to new shapes. Almost pictographs... This person is talking, and is being very patient. She heard the tiefling speak in Common so apologises and says she doesn't understand the words in the air. It shifts again - "Oh, I'm so silly!" she says, as she realises she can cast Comprehend Languages.

*Now* she understands.

She starts to explain why we're here. At the mention of Golden Vault and gem he asks to see the gem. She shows it. He opens his hand and the gem just floats over, to levitate just above his hand. Suddenly he creates various beams of light somehow, that are directed into the gem - and light explodes outwards, into floating holographic-like pictures in all colours. The glyphs appearing next to Fell express surprise. Oswen is surprised to also be able to understand the gem too - **it is a language of its own** - stories, snapshots, some of it repeating things *we* said to the Golden Vault, along with other things. A potted history, some of which includes what we did, but not all of it. It's non-linear and we get the impression that this is how Fell things - almost concurrent, several times at once.

The gem is floated back to Oswen once Fell seems to have seen what he needs to. He "asks" us to move to the next room to take a seat and, as he does, walks over to the main door and seems to lock it magically, barring it physically too for good measure.

Bel is unsure but Oswen says, "I don't know why but this feels fine." We move to the back room.

When we sit, Fell leans back and his feet are revealed; they're very small and he massages them, as if in a bit of pain. Kindle sees this and offers to help. Fell is taken aback a bit but allows Kindle to help. Normally his kind, Fell explains, don't walk; they float. He touches a chain around his neck - there's a symbol on it, and he explains that he was disowned (!) - cast out - from the **Dabus** - the children, the creation of the Lady, who run the whole city. They keep the place running. He touches the symbol; he was cast out because **he believes in Aoskar**. He smiles. "She's not dead. She lives! But we are not permitted to worship and it's blasphemy."

Something of a debate happens! Perhaps gods are related to continued function of something as well as creation, and *we* haven't noticed portals acting up. So perhaps he's right, if that's how that god works.

A wall of text appears next to Fell discussing all kinds of concepts. Oswen engages with the debate a while hoping to get on Fell's good side! Then she segues into the issue of the "fear" / the story Fell saw from the gem. Now a new wall of text appears, discussing options about what it is we experienced.

Fell thinks we were sent to him, specifically, *because* of his belief in Aoskar - in *doors*. All doors require keys, well, portal doors at least! "And that is where the Golden Vault comes in. I am sort of a conduit for information. Nobody really pays much mind to me here, in the Hive. It is a place largely free of scrutiny and oversight. Do you have a current mission? Or are you a free agent, who is learning?"

We explain. Learning, we think! "Ah, so I am to train you!" 'says' Fell.

We are to learn more about the Golden Vault and the true complexity of creation. Oswen has seen the instability of "incursion" in the Far Realm; not even deliberate, malicious incursion, just an introduction items and objects from one plane into a more mundane plane (the necklace). It can up-end the status quo; destabilise. That's where the Golden Vault comes in.

"We move things from location to location. We have just sent a very powerful artefact to a very secure location to keep it safe, that had been brought here to Sigil. Do you believe in some greater good? What is your guiding light?"

It's hard to answer. Oswen just tries to do what *feels* right. Bel believes in music of the planes, he says - we've not heard that before. He is "searching for the notes of the great cosmic song, to find my place in it and to add to it - to make my mark in the never-ending song of creation". Kindle of course has Yolanda. Inafina has more of a personal philosophy than a belief in a deity.

Fell is a little surprised, but thinks we must align in philosophy with the Vault. We must believe in a good or evil, a diving line. Yes, we do, though Inafina is more about the natural order of things. The discussion continues along these lines; what is good or bad; how do we trust; why do we trust *him*? We answer as best we can.

We learn that it is believed almost any - if not perhaps *every* - other plane can be accessed from doors within Sigil, if you just have the right key; and indeed, perhaps even different versions of a reality on a single plane. Different, separate, concurrent versions. This is a kin to when Zybilna cast her Wish spell and rewrote our own history, after a fashion.

There are some yawns! It was getting late when we came to Sigil and it's a lot later now. Fell suggests we "find a place to call home". Perhaps here, perhaps in another Ward.

Bel likes the idea of good food. The area isn't always dark - beyond the Night Market isn't foggy if it rains, for example - and in Yon, we were OK for a little while in that strange permanent stormy night too. So we figure, we'll find somewhere here.

Fell tells us to come back and talk whenever we want. **He hands us a key.** "This is for a small apartment not two blocks away! It's one of our - well, like a safe house. It's empty right now". We thank him.

We head outside and expect Alden to have gone, as it's been a while - but he's still there. Oswen apologises and gives another gold, since it's been surely more than an hour, but he refuses. We explain briefly about meeting Fell and being offered an apartment here, and he offers to escort us to the address - even though it's very close.

We ask if there's a way we can get in contact with him in future for further transit. We just ask Tea Street Transit we want Alden. But how do we get hold of them here, in this ward? He walks up to the side of the road and points at a jar. It seems to have a strange coil of light inside. "Lift this coil out - and you can send a message through it to one of a number of different services in the city". He shows us the one for Tea Street Transit.

We thank him again, he heads off and we decide to check out the apartment first. Stairs lead up the side of the building outside, solid stone, and we are on a third floor. There are two rooms on each floor; we have one facing the street, not a back alley. Inside there's a small, grimy window which opens, a small table with four chairs, a small area that could be used as a single-pot stove fire area, a simple bathroom and one bedroom with two bunk beds. It's very spartan but will do fine.

We drop off a few non-valuables and then head out in search of food, in this night market area of the Hive Ward - the so-called Grease Pit. Alden told us about a place for non-meat-eaters. We've never heard of such a thing, so of course our natural curiosity leads us that way.

It's all set up in narrow alleyways between buildings that run off main streets. Stalls or small shops with little seats and stools outside or by the windows just inside line the alleys. There's a lot of food we don't recognise at all - and a lot of *creatures* we don't recognise. We certainly know we're on another world! Tieflings are familiar... And scarily, mind flayers; we've never seen them in person. There's some kind of yeti with fluffy white fur, and then to our surprise - tempered only by a belief that somehow, in some way, this is a "safe enough" place - there are demons and some strange monstrosities, but they're not attacking, they're just mingling. It's *extremely* strange. Inafina insight 17 on that; the monstrosities perticularly are bipedal but with huge horns coming off their shoulders, wrapping over their heads like helmets and - grotesquely - open rib cages with organs visible within, pulsating, held back by some kind of clear gel sack. As they eat she can even see the food going down. That said, there are large, burly characters standing around; some own stalls, some eat but seem to have eyes out at all times for trouble. There's a feeling of people minding their own business. Somehow this *works*.

Oswen investigation 21 to find the food of interest. As she does, she sees a strange sort of minor illusion; to us, we'd call these colours neon, but they're of a shade and luminosity that she has never considered or imagined before, even from the Fey Wild. Some look like graffiti on the sides of buildings, but some of them have glyphs she recognises from Fell. These must be signs and names. As she keeps watching she sees correlations with some of the food stalls. High up signs visible from afar, guiding people to stalls hidden down in this maze of alleys.

Boards by stalls carry menus. Many are in two languages - Common is fortunately ubiquitous while the other language seems to depend on the stall. With so much unfamiliar writing, so she uses Comprehend Languages - she has to touch menu boards understand them and figure out the plane from which the language arises, but before she does, she's immediately distracted by the barrage of casual conversation language around her that she now understands. She also is able to visually "read" things from one or two people who appear to "speak" with runes, like Fell; but the same runes, written down, can only be read by touch.

She runs over to touch a menu board. The party is caught by surprise as she's small and nimble, and have to give chase! That said, there are plenty of smaller creatures. Gnomes and fairies, and 2ft or 1.5ft tall strange alabaster skin glowing beings; she recognises some kobolds; and there small devils - imps perhaps. Furniture she realises is of all sizes, but some stalls are mostly huge, others mostly tiny; a few are very mixed. She ends up by a tall, leathery-skinned, seriously looking, heavily tattooed barbarian-like man (but he's not especially large built). The language is *Athasian*, she gathers implying a place called *Athas*. Interestingly the language feels like an ancient form of parts of our world, perhaps akin to Netherese. It's a strange thought to read something in current use that seems to *predate* and be a precursor what is, to her, an ancient language.

The proprietor leans over to look down... "Barbeque? Grill? Oven bread!" - Oswen says, "Yes, oven bread please!" - a piece of hot bread, served in folded paper, is produced. He holds up four fingers. She asks, "Ah, I'm sorry, we're very new. What metal?" He touches a beautiful copper necklace; well, more of a collar or choker. "I see!" says Oswen and pays 4 coppers.

It's a sort of pita bread, but is filled with salad and toasted nuts. She takes it back to the group to share. Some of vegetables aren't immediately recognisable but it tastes good! She's a bit spun around now though, so Survival is only 2+4->6; Kindle picks her up for a vantage point. Orvil says he's relieved, as all the faerie dragons flying around make for a crowded airspace. She tries again - nat 1, reroll, nat 2 again! No good!

The buildings are 3 storeys or maybe more? Some have mezzanines. Up on buildings there is a strange layer of activity made from tiny flying creatures - there are even large things that are almost birdcage-like, hanging off balconies, that are actually eateries themselves.

"I haven't got a clue where the vegetable place is, but we could just wander around more...!"

Above another laneway entrance a distance away is a big neon sign floating. Part of it looks like a leaf. "Oh, wait, maybe over there?" and points for Kindle, so the group make their way towards it.

Closer, the neon leaf seems to be connected to a neon vine and snakes around a corner and along another alleyway; there are lots of leaves and sprouts coming off once we get into there. It's all an illusion but a very complicated one and, apparently, permanent. This is "The Vine", which we were looking for.

At first glance it looks very similar; it's in the details where we see dishes that just don't have any "animals" in them. It is quite warm compared to Torril, especially winter, so stews don't seem that great an idea, and we fall back to the old favourite - Things On Sticks! This section is popular. There's a Cambian at a stall we choose... Red, ember glowing skin; folded wings, horns, a wide grin, but not an evil one somehow?! Wears an apron.

A devil, in an apron, cooking vegetables on sticks.

We order "four sticks". The smile widens - almost unnerving at that - and he points to an Infernal and Common sign about options. We go for "mixed", to hedge our bets. Surprisingly, these are very cheap indeed - just 1cp each, 4cp total. They're quite light, and we realise that some people buy them in quite large numbers. We're just experimenting.

A short way away, Inafina is surprised to see strange metal creatures. Geometric, gears, machines, wings, quite small.. They are Modron, not that she knows it. They're feeding things in between big rollers; she thinks it might be making juice, so she leads us over. Up close, we see either upside-down pyramids, cubes, or perfect spheres making up the bodies of these curious creatures. They seem to be alive, despite being made of metal. When we enquire about it, the speak roughly in unison - it starts with "Arborian Cane Juice" and gets more wild from there. We don't what they are, but one of them is pale blue. Bel points out that one, so we go with pale blue. They fetch long blue stems, almost like giant blue asparagus, and feed them into the rollers. We're handed glass jars of juice. 2cp each. But we realise we should mix it up, since it's made it fresh, so we end up sampling and sharing a lot of colours.

We spend some time finding other bits and bobs, and eventually wind our way back to the lodging feeling tired, and a little confused, but also strangely grounded - however strange this place looks, it *functions* in a way that we understand.

Up high, out of the crowded alleyways with a clear view of the sky, Oswen realises there are various flying machines up there. *That* would be a quick way to get around...

...back at the room, we realise we have no alarm spells prepared. We'll have to risk it! We tuck into bed and, surprisingly, sleep soundly, despite our strange surroundings.
