# Oswen: Part 2.18
## Campaign Day 42, equivalent of morning
### Shadowfell, Tovag, a The Sturdy Boot Inn

In the morning, Kindle raises John. He is reunited with his wife. We all know Brn is going to ask us a very difficult question about his parents soon, given all this dead-raising business; but for now, there is at least some joy in this dark place!

We plan to head on to the city. We might have found the blade - maybe that's enough - but we have promises for Mirianne and Brn. We'd better have a conversation with Bart.

It gets started with us offering to tell him more about us, if he wants. He agrees. Bel leads, of course (persuasion 31), while Inafina watches closely (insight 18).

* No apparent recognition of Vecna, Golden Vault, Sigil
* He does react to Gloom/Glorm - he's met other people who've used that name, but he doesn't know where it is

He thinks it's a hidden town, out here in the frontier. He has not been beyond the confines of the mist; Inafina gets the impression that it's been a choice. *It seems that leaving the domain might be something people are regularly asked to do and understand!* "I have no shame in saying that I don't believe in laying down my life for whatever vendetta that Kas has against this so-called Vecna".

The conversation ebbs and flows, before we eventually gently enquire about Bart himself. He says he's part of a group called "**An Other Way**". This domain has people focused with a single purpose; Kas's purpose. "He has destroyed the land and robbed us of our futures for it. He has literally taken lives and left just mindless subservient soldiers behind." An Other Way people think he's deluded. But now we're saying Kas was right? Vecna is out there and *should* be destroyed?

And so it goes on.

He was a scholar. Other researchers, scholars, historians etc. were all in this domain and existed because Kas believed the sword must be found. Kas is sure that's the only reason he's failed to find Vecna. "**The Finders Of The Way**". And from this, some researchers found doubt. There's probably a sword, but it's not what Kas thinks and wouldn't prove he is right. An Other Way is formed.

But Bart's group then found part of a sword. He believed so much in An Other Way that he *slaughtered the other people in the expedition* except his bodyguard, who was also part of An Other Way, *to prevent the sword from being taken back to the capital*. He wants to deliver it to people in An Other Way. But when he met them, they refuted the sword's existence; it must mean *they* are wrong. They wanted to take the sword from him and that was *another* altercation. He thinks he left them for dead, too... A crisis of faith. He knows he must defend himself and won't give up the blade until he figures it out.

We explain aspects of what he's said that seems both wrong or right. When it comes to the blade, he knows it's magical; but it seems dormant. Ultimately a very old woman spoke to him about it in the city. It was her son that told Bart to speak to her. She told him of a fable, but insisted it was true; a long time ago she was from Gloom. "My research - my scrying - my searching - it all pointed to the capital city. We'd always thought that must be wrong! But it wasn't - it led me to the royal army and the royal forges. She was, once, the master smith of the palace. He son is now."

Mirianne is trying to process. Her mother? Old? She has a *brother*?

Bart thinks "her life is in jeopardy now - she only did this because she doesn't have long left - she said, 'the veil will be dropped when this leaves my possession because we will no longer appear as one. You must reach Gloom and reunite it with its hilt. That is the only way to break the curse that I am under. And hopefully you can do that before I die. You must hurry to Gloom. You will find the hilt there.'"

Oswen can scarcely believe it. Eventually she decides to reveal that we have the hilt. We show it. He casts a spell, brow furrowed. "That's odd. My spell tells me the hilt is in that direction." - he points to the Capital. Yes - the hilt was meant to "look like" the mother and vice versa.

But what exactly would it mean to break the curse? She'd be able to see her husband - but doesn't know he has passed. And Bart is torn; he made a promise. In the end, the two of them (Oswen and Bart taking a good half hour over the options, while others have tea!) for Oswen to use Sending with Bart's wording based on his description of Nerys.

25 words or less. Wow.

"Bart's Working With Us. We Also Have Hilt. If rejoined, How Would You Leave Tovag? Our Own Means Is Limited In Number. Regards, Oswen!"

Only 24.

A response in old woman's voice; "Praise Lathander! Unbelievable serendipity. If true - reunification unravels enchantment, including freedom and transposition. However, requires arcane forge. Only Tovagen Or The Teeth."

Oswen laughs, despite herself, after that first reply - "She's much better at using long words to convey meaning than me!" and then sends back, "We should try to meet. Much danger for us in Tovagen. Are you able to safely get to The Teeth, or is it too far?"

"(Laugh) (Sigh) Mobility impossible. Currently incarcerated! Escape unlikely; perhaps reunification circumvents the situation? Hilt procurement suggests Bernald deceased... The game is up. Watch your back."

Oswen has to use her last L3 Sending given *that* message.

"Hoped to break news in person. Mirianne is here. She is safe. We will be careful. Coming to you. Help is on the way."

An almost panicked response, but wondrous too; "Mirianne? Beloved Mirianne? Such dreams! Focus on reunification. Do not approach. Death awaits here. Hopeful to see her."

We discuss the exact meaning briefly; it's somewhat cryptic; but Mirianne is sure that it's clear. We must get to the Teeth and use the forge, rather than getting to the city; it seems that knowledge of the blade has already spread ("the game is up") and the city is now too dangerous for us to approach.

Bart agrees that *when it is time to unify* the sword he'll hand it over. In the mean time, no.

Our location will be no secret. But at least we could then still split up to try and make sure that the hilt and sword weren't found at the same time.

As Bart goes to pack his bags, Kindle points out "If we are doing this, isn't there another promise that we will not be able to keep?" - so we debate what to do with Eloitious and daughter. In the end, L4 now as L3s spent already, Oswen uses another Sending. "Circumstances overtake us. Time is short. To keep our promise, you must *both* meet us at The Teeth *tomorrow*." Quite the Ask, especially the time factor! A response; "Delightful to converse! Preparations with immediate effect. Will travel tirelessly and make the rendez-vous. Ranna will be delighted. Tanner."

Hasty goodbyes to the innkeepers. They thank us for saving them, Kindle in particular - a little uncomfortable for the attention. "We don't known who sent you or who you serve" says John, "But if there is a deity who commands your respect, then through your actions they command our respect as well." Kindle leaves behind a little prayer book - actually a book of hearth stories - giving them a hug, wishing them peace and comfort for the rest of their days.

That done, we can waste no more time. Oswen says, "Let's go. And move fast!"

A big party now. The four of us; Bart and guard on horses; Mirianne and Brn; we have the cart and we keep it; there is now a spare horse... Kindle likes the horse (and Brn insists on going with him).

Kindle looks a little distraught. He later confesses that he felt a bit of a fraud. He couldn't bring himself to tell them what he suspects will happen - that the domain will collapse - "and now I'm like all those priests that I've held in disdain before. They lie to spare someone pain. The comfort and safety of ignorance."

Bart is very jumpy. Inafina's very worried about him and asks Oswen quietly at one point if we're bringing him out, if we can. Oswen's like Kindle; would like to save everyone but doesn't know how; the lawful Inafina is worried that he *killed* his party, but is it the sword doing that? She spends much of the journey watching him closely. Insight 17 (*with* heroic inspiration). She can't figure it out. There's something else going on. So - she asks him! Persuasion luck 19+2, 21. While talking, she realises he's fighting demons; arguing with himself - sometimes almost audibly - because the foundations of his world and beliefs are being pulled out from under him. And he killed for it! That was a righteous cause; but now it seems that cause was wrong.

He made a promise to Nerys and perhaps put too much weight on that - it "served as a replacement for my conscience; I needed to cling onto it. Its meaning. It's the only way I can justify what I did."

Over the course of the conversation, Inafina gets to the truth of it; the sword *is* trying to wear down Bart. It does speak to him. And he wants to be rid of its burden - but also finds it difficult to part with it. But the sword mostly "woke up" when he met *us*. And its influence is weak so far; Bart knows when it talks to him. And we learn that he *does* keep it in a bag of holding of his own; *it definitely can speak "out of" a pocket dimension*.

We don't stop at Wayfarer's Inn, but it's already a little late when we pass by; we're a bit worried.

We've made it up into the mountains. It's much colder. There's mist lying close to the ground. It's quite scary. The pass ahead is well-named; even though it's a very long way away, there is clearly a gate-town with two massive watchtowers on either side that do look like teeth.

The horses begin to struggle a bit due to the steep road, now gravel. Kindle dismounts and walks with the horse; the rest of us walk alongside the cart. Fires and smoke from the town ahead. Clouds have formed around the range tops. It's now *very* cold; sometimes the horses slip on icy patches. It's slow going through a series of switchbacks. We hear distant howling - wolves of some kind - the sounds of the valley echo up here. We push on, since we must.

Finally, with the moon already down, we make it to the gate. Credentials are demanded. We show the token and lift the back of the wagon canvas for inspection. There's still some uncertainty - lots of people for trading! Lots of horses too. Bel gets into his best deceptive mode and even put in hints of bribery... And indeed, one perfume bottle ultimately is taken. A small price though - the gate is opened, just wide enough for us to enter.

Now we're in a huge gatehouse. We wait as a portcullis is raised on the other side, then travel through to what can best be described as a vertical town, climbing down the other side of the mountain. It's a bit less steep but still steep - terraces, only about one building wide, tight twisting roads winding through them. It's busy though, even at this time of "day". Lots of traveller services seem obvious immediately and there's a garrison too. Bart looks nervous. He's sure he's a wanted man here.

At least - since Bart knows the area - finding a big inn is easy. It's four storeys, set up into the mountainside with entrances on multiple terraces. Best we can get is two rooms of four, on the same floor but with another already-occupied room of four in between. 2gp a night per room. Four horse stabling; 2gp total. The carriage isn't anywhere secure but there's no charge for it to be left where it is.

Bart and bodybuard pair up with Inafina and Bel, while Kindle and Oswen stay with Bel and Mirianne. We figure we'll stay at the inn for food to reduce the chances of being spotted by anyone that recognises Bart or his guard. Bart can use Disguise Self, but it can be 'seen' through. We end up with pork (hog), crusty bread and some vegetables. We still don't know how they grow things without sun!

It's late, but we do spend a bit of time trying to figure out how we might get into the Arcane Forge. It's for the garrison only usually. We spot the Captain while scouting things out a bit; captained by a vampire. That means they'll be quite powerful, including possibly mind-reading the presence of the sword. Perhaps Eloitious has enough 'clout' to get somewhere there?

Time for bed. Alarm is set up of course and Watch is established.

* Oswen 19
* Inafina adv (hearing) 17
* Kindle 17
* Bel high (not noted)

...other rolls also not noted but good all round and, surprisingly - no drama at all.



## Campaign Day 43

We wake to smells of breakfast, regroup and head down to eat. It's busy, including some guards eat. Bart uses Disguise Self immediately (but it probably won't help against the vampires). Oswen casts Sending to Eloitious, giving him the name of the inn, the fact that we need to get into the arcane forge and a warning of a vampire guard - a basic "head's up". In his response, it's surprising - he can already see the teeth; "should be there within a couple of hours". But the Captain, he says, would outrank him so he can't help there Him and Ranna will get a room at the inn.

Well, Bart is in disguise and so long as we keep clear of vampires... We go scouting. The forge is not hard to find, set into the mountainside with great plumes of smoke coming from chimneys. It sits within the compound of the garrison. There's a public interface of sorts though - a shop is set into the garrison walls. It bears the royal armoury seal. That doesn't seem helpful but we head in anyway to see what's there.

It's a classic sort of gift shop; immaculately presented, lots of royal insignia and so-on on just about everything! At least the quality seems good. Everything is apparently made locally. There's a shopkeeper and assistant. The shopkeeper is a Drow, with a human assistant. Bel gets into smalltalk but the TL;DR is that they really aren't likely to *let* us use the forge. But Inafina notices that the distance from the back of the shop to the entrance of the forge is small and the shop has a few things that are waiting for repair back there.

Bel can bring Mirianne into there magically and she can work the forge, but (A) she needs around an hour and (B) if someone else is there then it's a problem. He'd need a way to disguise them in there somehow. So we need some kind of distraction, but for a long time!

Oswen by request - INT-based SUR check, 14+5+4 -> 23. Bel's talking about getting to the other side of the forge wall, no further than that and she realises that part of the outer wall connects; Passwall would do it. Orvil flies up and over to check - there aren't any gaps, so it's just a thick wall. There's am area he spots where it's clear - a weapon's rack would have to be moved aside as the "opening" would be behind that, but it's the least obscured and isn't near any people or busy working areas. Bart could cast an illusion on the opening to make it look like it's still a wall.

Oswen would need a short rest to dial in Passwall but otherwise it would work.

* Oswen opens the doorway
* Bart disguises it
* Bel will try to keep shopkeeper and assistant distracted just to reduce the number of people who might go into the forge
* Mirianne with sword and hilt goes in with Inafina and Oswen, with Kindle and Brn staying with Bel
* Bart will come in with Oswen and co.
* The guard will stand on the outside, next to the disguised doorway - could run in to warn us

We go for it. Inafina (ADV perception 25) listens for few people to be nearby, so Oswen can try Passwall. The passageway opens; she makes it look like a small but normal tunnel so if it does get spotted it might not seem too strange. Inafina and Mirianne creep in and move the weapons rack aside. Bart walks in and casts L4 Major Image to create the illusion of the wall behind us, on the outside of the wall. Out there guard stands nearby - but not directly in front.

Bel gives us a minute or two, then heads into the shop with Kindle. Bel fumbles his way through the start of things, almost annoying the shopkeeper at first, but then gathering himself and getting Kindle to fetch things. Then he starts into bartering. He wants all the information about every product!

While Oswen had rested, Mirriam spent the whole time reading and re-reading her father's instructions. Once inside, she wants to go straight to work. Oswen Arcana ADV with Bart, dirty 30! Figures out how to get the forge started really quickly. Inafina listens for anyone coming - it's noisy though so ADV perception is only 15 - but she does her best. The forge startup in particularly is quite noisy and Kindle (perception was high enough) hears it, so knocks over a display of noisy breastplates to mask the noise. More delay tactics by very clumsily and slowly picking things up again.

Bart WIS save - works. He's able to give up the blade. Mirianne says Mending would speed things up - Kindle has that but he's outside - fortunately Bart does too.

Oswen ARC - nat 1; re-roll 5; heroic inspiration re-roll 14! 27 total. She senses layer upon layer of enchantment woven into these objects to try and hide the properties and suppress things. It's very powerful. But this is all being undone. She starts to feel a rising panic; this sword could get into our heads very easily and very quickly. "Do you have Intellect Fortress?" "I have Protection From Good & Evil" "Let's swap!" - so we both cast at our highest levels to cover the other three in the room.

It's hot, bright and Inafina is finding it hard to look at the sword and Bart, and trying to listen for things in the courtyard. Perception (flat) 11.

We've been here a long time. Nerves are frayed. The sword is glowing hot; and then Inafina hears footsteps on the stone out in the courtyard. Has Bel failed to keep the distraction going? She sneaks out towards the entrance. A swarthy-looking older guy, looks like a Smith, is walking from the gatehouse of the compound towards the entrance. She has to do something. The entranceway is place to get changed into work gear. She wants to wait just inside, hoping to knock him out, but she'll be easy to spot. There's nowhere to hide. Quick as a flash, she grabs an almost-forgotten vial of Invisibility! The guy comes in, then starts to walk inwards.

She manages to get a good hit with the staff, 12 bludgeoning and Stunning Strike but he resists that. She goes with the feet. Nat 1, total miss, almost falls over; more focus points; tries again, nat 2 and he dodges; then finally she *just* scrapes a hit, 19 damage, *that* takes him down. Non-lethal force is surprisingly difficult. She sets to work gagging and binding him and ends up dragging him into the room where we came in, in a corner.

Back at the forge the three there don't know what has happened. WIS saves now! ADV for all except Oswen thanks to Intellect Fortress.

* Inafina (3,20) -> 23
* Oswen 14 -> 21
* Bart (3,13) -> 16 + 1 -> 17 (+1 from Ring Of Protection)
* Mirianne (1,9) -> 13

Dice make sense in a way. Bart was already under some prior influence and Mirianne is closest to the sword. Her eyes widen; she drops it with a look of abject terror spreading over her face! Inafina's perceptive enough to recognise a coming scream - Inafina, unarmed strike essentially to hold her and cover her mouth - attack roll 18, works, it's muffled. Bart is OK but only just - he's on the edge.

There's a red-hot sword on the ground, but it's cooling *rapidly* and an intense presence is emanating out of it. No doubt this thing is sentient. It communicates telepathically. It's reaching out violently to connect to with minds it can "see". She looks around in a panic; a scabbard by the wall, it'd let her sheath it; she does that and tries shoving it into her "handbag" of holding to reduce its influence, maybe. It "speaks" to her in her head. She says back, as loudly as she can to it in her head, "Bide your time, I will come for you." (Dirty 20 deception) - the sword is shouting at her, "DO NOT PUT ME AWAY!" - but she does so.

Mirianna is in Inafina's arms, terrified and not recovering. Oswen wonders if this is a curse; she tries Remove Curse and it seems to help a *bit* but we have to leave NOW. At least she's not frozen on the spot.

We dash out through the tunnel (Oswen 9 perception does *not* notice the smithy near our exit!) and we through and out the other side. Oswen dismisses Passwall. Bart goes to the guard; "We need to go now! Help her!" - Mirianna needs support. Oswen says, "Get to the inn, get to your room, we'll be there in a moment". Oswen sends Orvil into the shop (!) to cause some ruckus and let Bel and Kindle know to leave. We head back to the inn too, in another direction, straight to the room.

Initially the five of us congregate in the room with Mirianne trying to get her calm. "It's... It's hopeless. I'm sorry I should never have done that. I should - I don't know - why - this is a mistake. This is a mistake! That **THING** is evil. Why have we put an evil thing back together?" Oswen remembers Nerys! L3 Sending. "You must know by now. We are all safe. How are you?" - Oswen feels the spell having to push through and that gives an answer itself (ARC 25). "You've done it! My Mirianne... He *is* dead. This town - the decay - a lot to process. Be careful with the sword. Resist it."

Oswen has to blow yet another. ARC 20. "Painfully aware of sword abilities. Find a safe place in the Outlands. We will come to you as soon as we can."

"I will head to Sigil and see you there. Please protect my baby girl!"

(Facepalm)

But what of Eloitious. Inafina checks at the front desk; not yet; OK, so we have to wait. No Bel or Kindle either. Oswen gets Orvil onto the roof to watch the street. Brn, Bel and Kindle and walking back with a huge crate! They made a deal, it seems. We'll have to put that in the portable hole. Seeing that through Orvil, Oswen realises she's still not figured out the amulet yet and starts to study it. INV/ARC, either are 26 total. This is clearly the conduit. She thinks about the sequence of events that made this happen. The mist. It guides you through the mist. Any of the boundary mist. "Give me a direction for the fastest way to reach boundary mist."

Orvil relays - the mists are all over the mountains. If we can fly somehow, or otherwise climb up, that would help. Then another message from Orvil. Eloitious and Ranna have come through the gate. They are headed towards the inn. Oswen apologetically asks Bel to get out there and find the two of them to get us all together as quickly as possible. Then suddenly, Oswen HIS 25 - "Wait did we -" she starts to say; then there's a *huge* resounding "boom", almost like an earthquake, rocks tumbling down - **the arcane forge has exploded!** The wall behind the furnace has blown out "- turn down the fire...".

Turns out Mirianne had run the forge flat-out, but then in her terror had never cooled anything down so it had just been getting hotter and hotter.

* Kindle is busy stowing things from the crate into the portable hole
* Ranna is hugging Oswen and full of questions
* Brn is trying to console Mirianne with Inafina, having seen as soon as he came back with Bel & Kindle that she was very upset even if he doesn't know why
* Oswen's getting lots of alarm calls from Orvil at all the unpredictable person and guard movements outside caused by the explosion
* Eloitious is grinning ear to ear!

"We must get to the mists!" says Oswen, "up the mountain somehow!"

"Do we have a minute?" asks Bel.

"We can give you a minute" says Oswen, warning Orvil that'll be leaving "in a minute!"

Bel squeezes us all into one room. Oswen scribbles a hasty note saying, "To the innkeepers - we all had to leave in a great hurry, the horses, carriage and its contents are yours to do with as you please as an apology for the inconvenience" and signs it, "Oswen, room 21".

Bel starts casting Windwalk. We need to stick together. Then suddenly - "everyone, follow me!" cries Bel as his spell completes - we turn into mist! We squeeze out of a window. Outside, we can see below a block or two away that the vampire captain is calling out to people wondering what's happening. He looks *right* at our misty clouds moving away and seems intrigued. We can't do anything - we're mist. He turns into a bat and starts to fly to follow us. He can't keep pace, fortunately, but we suspect he'll be on our tail as we materialise.

Up and away to the mountains. Bel is trying to find the edge of the mist *and* a flat enough "landing space" for us. A tarn does it - the bank around is good. The mist flows over the mountain here and almost "nips at our heels". We have a head start on the bat but we don't know how much. The very long process of coalescing begins again, Oswen waiting nervously to see if the vampire captain will appear. She pops Orvil out immediately - and he can see the bat flying towards us. It's probably only a couple of minutes away.

"We must all hold hands and walk into the mist! And do *not* let go. It'll try to pull you away."

Ranna holds Oswen and Eloitious' hands, Oswen holds Inafina, then Mirianne, Brn, Kindle (Kindle has to bend over!), then Bart then the guard, then Bel.

Orvil is popped back away. We start to walk along into the mist. It engulfs us. Bel decent acro; Oswen 25 (!) too; Inafina 27; Kindle stumbles a fair bit. We can't see anything. It carries on for a while. She's getting nervous. She feigns confidence; "Don't worry, just keep walking!" "But how deep is this fog?!" as it seems to keep going on and on. "A mystery!" says Eloitious. "It's supposed to be endless..." "Not to us!" says Oswen, again, *hoping* it's true.

There's a cry and a clank. People start pulling on hands; Bel and the guard have slid off the side of something! They're being pulled down; Bart *just* manages to hold on; Brn is in the air, suspended between Kindle and Mirianne! We do manage to pull them back, just, but as we do that, the mist is rolling back where they were; and we can see - it was the grave we had to dig.

That's it; we've made it to Gloom. Oswen says, "Welcome to Gloom, but I suspect a problem - for those unfamiliar, the domain we were in is leaking through here. There are numerous shadows and demons potentially around, and I wouldn't be too surprised if that Captain finds his way through. It's night time, so Oswen says, "Sorry Mirianne but the smithy was too smashed up after last time, how about the inn where we got rid of demons? Brn's place? If that's not too bad for you?" "I don't think we should linger!" they both say. "OK, fastest way out of town?" "Where's my mother?" "She's headed spireward, towards Sigil" "We should go there too!" "How would you normally get there?" "There's a stone archway that would be a portal, not a day's walk from here." "OK, that's probably the way your mother went. Let's do that."

Orvil is popped out - once again, a hawk! He "says" (now thinking-only) that he liked being able to speak, but he hadn't realised how bad his eyesight was until he got his hawk eyes back. Speaking of which, ADV perception 23, watching for the bat. No bat. But he does see something very not good - the shadows are here. He warns Oswen. Oswen says very quickly, "Bart, **Gerone**" (the guard), shield your eyes, this is going to be the brightest thing you can possibly imagine and will blind you if you look at it. And  Eloitious, Ranna, cover any skin with fabric if you can, this is going to be a kind of bright light that hurts your kind, but it's the only way I have to fight the other things here, I'm sorry, they're on top of us, I have to do this now..." - **Driftglobe, daylight**.

Ranna shrieks! She has been incautious. Oswen takes off her cloak and throws it over Ranna, like a blanket. "Put your hands up, inside it!" - but she grabs Oswen's hand under the cloak; Oswen can smell the burning - says again, "I'm so sorry I just don't have any other way to fight all these things at once." "What *is* that?" "That, my darling" says Eloitious, "is sunlight."

Awkwardly, stumbling, we start to head away, half of us with eyes closed, trying to get out of a graveyard and out of town. Mirianne takes point and we get out of town soon enough. Interestingly, we are not pursued beyond the boundary. Oswen shuts down the globe so we can carry on normally.

As eyesight acclimatises back to the dark, people start to witness the (fake, but beautiful!) night sky. Oswen does her best to explain about day and night, Eloitious too. And he talks as if he experienced it; he must be VERY old. First generation into that domain. Maybe he's a key, thinks Oswen, into rescuing more people or plugging that leak in Gloom. We have the locket. We could go back.

But what of Nerys - did she make it out? Oswen realises with a shock that she didn't check. L4 sending, "Did you make it out of town? We headed for the rock arch portal. If ahead of us, you may choose to wait." - to her relief, she gets a reply; "It's a long way but I'm on my way there. I will wait."

We're lucky she made it out; perhaps it was daytime. The few minutes we were still inside the Shadowfell could've been many hours here. We're lucky, too, that it wasn't much longer.

As we walk, we walk. Eloitious was a stablehand in the castle that Kas ruled, back before prison. They were already searching for the sword - it had already been taken by then - but he'd allegedly grievously wounded Vecna, yet failed to kill him. The sword had vanished, or he'd lost control of it or *something*! A long, long time ago. Kas was paranoid and killed a *lot* of people, thinking they'd taken that sword. But one day mists rolled in, took everyone in the town and then next thing he remembers, it was eternal night. The sun never rose again. Everyone in the town, the castle, the countryside, taken. "That was not the end of the killing. Once he realised he was trapped, Kas... Lost sanity. For a while. The domain expanded; mists rolled back; a very large area was taken. The landscape of it is as I remember - I left the town once, trying to find a way out. We eventually settled on the other side of the mountains in the Keep where you found us."

Onwards, we continue; talking more, then as we're deep into it - "Can I speak?" says a voice.

Huh?

"Vecna *is* evil. Vecna hungers for everything. His thirst cannot be quenched. He *is* the embodiment of evil. I agree with you. We are on the same side. I am not lying to you when I say - for as long as any of you can imagine, it has been my purpose to undo Vecna. I am not lying to you when I say that I seek to destroy his grip over the universe."

Oswen pulls her bag of holding around to look at it and says, "And I *was* lying to you when I said I'd take you out later. But I think you knew that. The people I'm going to hand you to are more powerful than I. They will be able to further your aims more than we ever could."

"I only desire to destroy him. I have other needs which I am sure some of you completely understand. If you were to draw my blade, you must feed it. I have hungers. But in return - *in return* - the power to crush Vecna can be yours."

Oswen senses very powerful spells she'd have access to. She looks to Inafina. "Lots of incredible monk things you could do with the sword? Respect from the monastery? And Bel, wealth, power, all the finest silks. And Kindle, the biggest hearths? The greatest saviour?"

But the sword tries to disagree. "No! I am not some 'C-grade deceiver'. I don't promise you the world. I promise only vengeance. I promise protection from Vecna through his destruction."

Oswen nods. "Good. Then if you tell the truth, we are taking you exactly where you need to go."

"Very well. Do not let me fall into the wrong hands! If you are to be attacked, draw my blade."

"*Can* you mask - *can* you - mask the emanations of the magic you carry?"

"No. Why would I do that?"

In the end, we walk all the way to the stone arch. It's starting to get a bit lighter on the horizon. Sat there is a woman - in good health, for someone in their 90s! A strong frame, even so. Loosely tied hair in a thin braid, but wearing rags. She stands and holds herself as upright as she can as we approach. Then she gasps - her eyes see Mirianne - someone who must be her daughter. She starts to head towards us, but can only walk slowly. How did she make this journey?! Mirianne seems uncertain at first. Brn pushes her. "What are you waiting for, that's your mother?" "But I've never met her before!" "That doesn't matter!" he says and pushes her again.

As they meet and - almost cautiously - embrace, a cold hand holds onto Oswen's and squeezes. It's Ranna. She's understood the emotion. She's almost overwhelmed. Oswen laughs, "and there, now you feel love yourself." "But this is a different kind of love. This is - painful. But beautiful. It's..." - she can't even really complete the sentence. "Thank you. You didn't need to keep your promise, but you did. I will not forget it."

"You are most welcome."

We give the two space to get acquainted.

Ranna and Eloitious will forge their own way from here, and we can point them in the direction of interesting parts of this plane, at least (they might even prefer to start back at Gloom - and as mist, they can fly quickly). We bid farewell, wondering if our paths will cross again. Ranna wants some time with Oswen first. She says she's never had a real friend before and would consider Oswen one. Oswen smiles; "yes, we are friends!". "If you find yourself in need of us - I can't speak for Eloitious, but - I would come to your aid, as a friend". "Thank you. And if you have the means to call us, we would endeavour to do the same". And with that, they head off.

While the vampires have an idea of where they're going, Mirriam, Nerys and Brn are another story, as are Bart and Gerone. And the sword is now something of a liability. We have little choice but to rest here. Bart and Gerone would provide escort and support back to Gloom in the morning if the other three want that, but we're worried that the town is lost (and indeed that incursion needs solving!).

Oswen figures - sending stone. So she gets the 'group chat' stone and says, "Sharp metal object acquired as hoped. Strong evil emanations hard to resist. Shadowfell incursion active in Gloom. Evacuees present with us. Assistance sought."

Alustriel is the first to respond. "Good to hear from you finally. Was worried. Much to discuss from past week. Reconvene on the morrow with meeting plans."

Mordenkainen: "Somewhat occupied currently! Tomorrow sounds better. Glad you are in one piece though I had every faith in your success!"

Bigby: "We must reconvene; there *is* much to discuss. Say, has anyone heard from Zorhanna?"

Vi: "Some victories, some losses. On balance better than it was, but not going smoothly. Won't be able to meet. A bit busy!"

We plan to make camp, explaining that the "doorway" to Sigil here won't work because Sigil's closed (and Oswen checks the arch; Aracana 22; it's active and works, but the other 'side' is simply closed). Nerys is already aware, having tried it. There's a difficult decision of how to keep watch for both others coming for the sword, *and* watch each other in case the sword "gets in our heads" again. Bart says that we could at least put it in something vaguely secure, and Alarm it for *anyone* coming within - say - 15ft radius.

We discuss other options but in the end settle with that idea. The sword is the only item left in Oswen's bag of holding with other items kept safe inside the portable hole, or her backpack and so-on. Three tents (one of which is Kindle's hut!) are set up around the alarmed sword, at triangle points, around the 15ft radius circle. Double-watch, then, to watch each other and surroundings.

* Oswen perception 19 with Orvil helping; and Bart. Oswen INT save 18. The sword *is* talking to her; she can hear it; she assumes the same is happening with Bart. It keeps trying to "reason" with her. She's minded to distrust it and ignore it and soon, the sword's constant harrying becomes mostly just annoying.

* Inafina adv (hearing) nat 20 -> 27; and Mirriam. Inafina WIS save 13; Mirriam also quite low; both hear voices and exhortations. The sword's tactic with them is to work on fear. "You barely made it out of there. It's only going to get worse. You *must* talk with the others. You need help and I can help you." Insight 16. She's not sure if it's truthful or lying; it's definitely hiding something though. She'll bring it up with the group in the morning. As Kindle arrives, she says, "It *never* shuts up!"

* Kindle perception 19; and Nerys perception 18 with Brn. WIS saves. Nerys actually walks around and over to Kindle to try and convince him to use the sword. Passive insight 18, so he knows that she's been influenced. He reminds her of the decades she lost trying to keep the sword hidden! Kindle won't agree, but does persuade her to talk to the group tomorrow.

* Bel and Gerone; average rolls. They're also a bit influenced.



## Campaign day 44

We've had a rest, but we're on edge. We awake to Bel and Gerone's argument getting louder - and find Bel tied up! Gerone says, "He's not himself; he's a threat to everybody! I tied him up!" and Inafina says, "*none* of us are ourselves. Oswen, the sword made *some* sense last night... Maybe we should listen..."

The arguments go back and forth and Oswen separates away and lets them have at it for a bit and studies the locket having read up on Legend Lore (she'd seen this coming from when she first bought the spell and picked up some ivory strips in one of her random shopping moments some time prior, but this will use a lot of incense!)

* Her mind is flooded with information!
* It's not magical, but very powerful and significant. It's evidence of something that magic has tried to wipe out of existence.
* The locket was **given to Kas by his best friend, Vecna** as a promise that they would forever be together - always have each other's backs. It was a pact.
* The **power the locket carries is simply because of the significance of that pact**.
* The locket is how Kas escaped. Its very existence is what created the link between Gloom and the Shadowfell. Now that the locket isn't in that town, the conduit there should be broken; but Kas is already through.
* She doesn't know how Kas got that locket into Gloom though. **Whoever did that is an ally and still at large on "this side"** and that ally is aware of this whole history.
* All other evidence of this friendship has been erased; the magic certainly *feels* like Vecna's history rewriting magic. Perhaps it's an early form of that technique.
* The locket is a reminder that **Kas is an oathbreaker** - the spell Oswen cast indicates that Kas was the betrayer. *But* Oswen still doesn't treat that as definitive since the locket's story indicates that Vecna's history rewriting magic was active when the locket was last meaningful to them both and that means her own spell *might* be being similarly influenced, although it *has* been able to see through this "hidden secret" and report that, *and* Vecna probably tried to erase the knowledge of the pact itself anyway so it wouldn't matter who broke it; so her confidence is reasonably high - just not absolute.

**She thinks a Shadar-Kai would need to have been the ally**. Plant the locket so Kas can escape. Why? So Kas can get the sword, and they either work together or whoever orchestrated it thinks they could rely on Kas alone, to kill Vecna. She deduces part of that from the way that Bart was pursued by Raven Queen associates who seemed to want the sword. So there's a chance that Shadar-Kai and maybe the Raven Queen are a third faction here. Or is it fourth, if Kas is the third?!

Camp is getting louder.

Oswen walks over to the arguing group. Channelling all her confusion about everything, she uses Prestidigitation to create a smell of Roslov's cottage - pumpkins and spice - right in the middle of the group. It snaps her own party members out of their obsession. The Gloom people are confused and the Bart & Gerone are indignant.

Oswen politely kind of orders her own group to ignore the sword for now. We'll get help soon enough. Bart and Gerone want to go anywhere the sword is *not*! And the other three are minded to take back Gloom/Glorm now that Oswen says the connection to the Shadowfell is broken. They'll all go there together; Bart and Gerone can provide protection and it'll give them time to learn from the villagers about the Outlands.

Nerys thanks us for the things with which we have helped. Mirriam and Brn have got closer and she'll look after him. But Brn is conflicted; he wants to travel with us, too. He's finally made peace with the fact that his parents can't be brought back. But he's going to have a lot of people who will look after him and he brightens up at the idea of being helped to run The Cheerful Cauldron - he's always liked the cauldron! And one day, we say, we will try to return.

There are hugs all around. Brn gives Kindle a particularly long one. It's hard for him. "...OK... I guess this is goodbye." Inafina, "It's farewell - that's what you'll be away for a while, but you *do* plan to see someone again." "Well I hope you come and visit me some day." And with that, they head away.

Kindle is quiet.

"It is for the best" says Bel. "He can't come with us. He's a child!"

Inafina says, "Well Oswen, you've promised us a talk about that sword once we find the others. Let's just walk in the opposite direction to get the sword away from them, and wait for a message."

Kindle asks if the sword is talking to any of us, as we walk. No. Oswen double-checks the sword in the bag; a sulky, "What?" and she says, "Just checking!" and puts it back. No switcheroo!

Bel thinks it's too quiet and starts to play music.

Oswen's getting nervous. Alustriel has her amulet and now she's not too sure who's contacting who or if Alustriel remembers *we cannot fast-travel*. So she casts Sending for Alustriel; says, "We are heading Spireward about half a day out of Glorm on foot. We cannot fast-travel. I have no teleport or planeshift". "Oh, you don't?! I see. We can fix that! Tell us where you will be so we can go there."

Oswen sends up Orvil; he's looking for any kind of landmark that they might know. Orvil (perception 5,8+4 -> 12) doesn't see much of interest. We aren't near any settlements, that's for sure. The whole area is too nondescript. There are a few distant options but nothing clear; there's one Spireward, that's not much better than the others but it's Spireward so we do that. All we can do is walk.

It's not a good result and the mood degrades as we cover ground. Arguments are common about the sword. It's definitely weighing on us. All Oswen can do is keep deflecting. We encounter various curious people along the way but this time, it's "head down, walk on". If we speak to anyone, the sword might do too!

It takes a full day, some 24 miles, to reach the hills Orvil originally spotted. It's going dark. A gentle rise of wooded hills with a handful of windmills and small farms, so there must be *some* kind of civilisation. We need to ask directions, but the concern about the sword is ever-present. Inafina decides to run ahead. A few hundred feet out, she reaches a farmhouse which see sees has lights on and knocks on the door. A tall humanoid - a greyish-brown bear of sorts, answers. They wear an apron; "Yes, can I help you? Are you lost?" Inafina explains that - well, yes we are! "There's the village in a dell, around behind this hill. It's sort of our village!" "Would it be OK to go there to spend the night? Is there an inn or something?" "Well, I think so, yes!" - the bear-person seems quite concerned. Inafina's mood probably leaked out.

Insight nat 1 + 7 -> 8. As she leaves, the person is still stood in the open door; she doesn't know why. She returns to the group and points out the dell behind the hill. Inafina realises she forgot to ask the village's name! So we can't use the group sending stone until we're there and can ask.

It's tucked in between the hills and windmills. It's strange to build such a low point between hills, tucked in deep. There aren't any gates, towers or walls we can see. Most buildings are 1 storey, only a few 2 storeys; maybe 40 buildings, no more. We can see a market centre with a well so we get to that. Some closed shops; a stables; the market area is empty right now. But there's a two-storey inn facing the well and, next to it, some kind of official-looking building on one side and a single-storey tavern on the other. There are a few people out still - not bears, all different kinds. They nod politely, but continue to watch us.

Inafina (with inspo) insight 25. She'd been getting paranoid. The sword may be giving off bad vibes. But no, it's just a small town! They know we're from elsewhere, it's a strange time of day (no market); they're curious and one is even approaching, then waves, as if to help. Inafina waves back and speaks to them. "We're a little lost! We're wondering what the name of this village is?" "Lost? Oh that's no good at all! Welcome to **Caerthorpe**. Forgive me, you all look tired - have you been walking all day?!"

There's talk of going to the inn, but Oswen suggests the tavern first (she's hoping we don't have to stay the night alone with each other, this sword, and potentially influenced villagers). The helpful villager takes us over and introduces us.

The other three start ordering while Oswen uses the stone to tell people the village name and describe its position as best she can. Alustriel answers; "I'll come and get you. Don't think we should all meet there. A bit exposed! Everyone else, meet at the Keep."

The soup is very good. Hearty, a lentil base, some cream, root vegetables. It's served with a meat pie too. We definitely feel better for having some hot food. Bel's spirits pick up further when he spots a barrel on tap. He gets a round for us.

There are maybe 8 others in the tavern, but between them and us it feels lively. People are courteous and friendly but otherwise give us our privacy. Inafina's listening; there's an air of worry and concern since Sigil is closed, but it's talked about as a thing that affects other people rather than themselves. Then two new people come in; people wave and greet them by name; they look part-elemental, air-like, a sort of moving mist or spray!

We've just finished our meal when the door opens - and the conversation stops. Everyone turns to the door as Alustriel walks in, just as herself and, apparently, this is quite attention-grabbing. Well, she's quite a regal elf. She seems rather oblivious to the impact; she walks up to us and says, "yes, well, I figured you'd probably be in here - can't imagine you anywhere else! - have you finished your dinner?"

"Yes, but it's really good if you want to have some yourself!"

"No, thanks, I'm good. Shall we go?"

Bel thanks the bartender (we chirp in agreeing) and pays. We try not to look *too* uncomfortable at all this attention that Alustriel has given us! We head outside and to the square. We'll walk out of town before casting any *more* big spells. We're still watched as we leave - Alustriel certainly gets attention.

It doesn't take long. We find a spot out of view and - ... She uses the amulet but, interestingly, it's not the same as for Oswen. There's a twinkling sound as tiny little lights surround us and then, a moment later, they clear and we're in the keep's courtyard.



### Fey Wild keep

People come running out to greet us. Froderick is first and is greet warmly; he wears a smart waistcoat. From the corner of the courtyard there's a sudden burst of song, as it seems a small circle of Campestri have set up in a shady area. And then Leonidas arrives, descending a ladder from a wall where he was doing some maintenance.

Oswen and he hug, but Oswen is a bit stiff and awkward. "What's wrong?" And she points to her bag of holding and says, "This. The thing in this." She turns to Alustriel. "We have to get rid of this. We have to get rid of this quickly! It'll be after *you* next. You're more powerful."

"We're ready for that!" she says and produces a tiny miniature chest. Then she casts a spell; the chest grows much larger. "In it goes!" she says. "Quick now!"

Oswen tries to fetch the blade. Of course, it *knows*. "STOP IT! Stop this at once! Do not put me in there!" - WIS save 16 + 7 -> 23. The blade gives an impression of surprise at her resistance; she more or less throws it into the chest, slams the lid and Alustriel does something; the chest gets small again. "Is that... I can't remember the spell" says Oswen. Alustriel says, "Leomund's spell. I got this one from Otiluke. Lemond was his student."

Alustriel is sure that the sword is safe in there. It can't reach us.

Oswen and Alustriel exchange staff and amulet again. Oswen politely enquires how things are going with the spell book. Mordenkainen had many. Oswen is out of sorts, though, but wants to proceed anyway. It's night time here, and we're all tired, but we wouldn't sleep anyway as-is.

No Tasha, Zorhanna or Mordenkainen yet. Rigby's here. We don't expect Otiluke or Vi and Otto is busy with stuff too, we're told. To Oswen's surprise, Bigby asks if she's heard from Zorhanna; almost as a reflex Oswen tries Sending. She feels it try to push interplanar, but even though it should work, it fails! Bigby says, "...we've tried that. We haven't heard from her and she hasn't contacted us at *all*. It's been a while. It's just a bit strange."

Oswen sighs. "Well, maybe we'll have to go after her. But one step at a time."

Alustriel assures us that Zorhanna is very accomplished and knows how to look after herself.

We end up heading to the library for wine and to converse, since people have all already eaten. Froderick is as ever amazing and she thanks him. Oswen wants to invite everyone else, but Alustriel interjects. "It's better for people to not be able to be *compelled* to reveal what they know."

She's right, of course, but this does not help Oswen's mood!

It takes a while for Mordenkainen to arrive. And then we get into it.

We start by talking about the sword, since for us, at least, it's so front of mind. Oswen mentions how the four of us have disagreed about it, but at least it's now with people who know what to do with it.

"Ah. About that..." says Mordenkainen.

Sigh.

* We have the eye and sword
* They think they know where the hand is and a plan is underway to get hold of it
* Vi is working on it, Otto helping, an extra complication (and we learn that in fact Arkhan will be manipulated into to getting back to Toril "...because we felt that was easier than sending you into Avernus!")

They want to enlist the sword's help to kill Arkhan.

"So I'm going to give you the Eye. And you'll have to take the Sword as well."

Oswen: "?!"

"The Eye has to find its way to Arkhan. He's quite a powerful paladin already. The Eye will make him even more powerful. That's why we need the sword. We have to kill him with both the Eye and the Hand; that will destroy both. We're thinking - with any luck, that will also greatly weaken the sword in the process. The moment we do that, Vecna - if he hasn't yet been put on alert! - will have his remaining eye firmly on us. We need to get a lot further with another plan of ours in the mean time. We need the Rod of Seven Parts. And that is going slowly. It's taking a bit longer than we thought. We think the plan is back on track though. We found people who can put it together."

* Oswen describes their Shadowfell adventure and the probable **involvement of the Raven Queen**. We may well need to try and talk to the Queen to find out what she is planning.

* They have more information on the **Grand Design of the 'machine'** that Oswen deduced at the Workshop. Its location is known. But we can't attack yet - too soon, Vecna is too strong.

* **Need to hear from Zorhanna** on a related basis; her theory was Athas was consumed to power this kind of magic and another plane could be consumed to power the machine again. It requires a vast amount of potential to be used at scale. Otto needs to be warned if that's true, so he can defend (or evacuate) planes, or find a way to thwart whatever might be underway there to open the plane up to exploitation.

* As discussed earlier - **take the Eye to lay in the path of Arkhan**, in a way that makes sense to him and does not arouse suspicions.

It seems for the four of us, it's Raven Queen or Arkhan.

Alustriel says there's technically a third option - but they don't know how to do it yet. "Somehow talk to the Lady of Pain and get a better understanding of what she knows. But that's very risky!"

She offers us an "out". "We're already asking a lot of you. And things are getting more tenuous". We fall silent for a moment. Oswen says, "I don't want to ever carry the Eye or Sword again, but the Sword does know us now; we'd at least stand *some* chance of convincing it to help..." - but she tails off, unwilling to speak for the others or even herself.

Mordenkainen offers to "sequester" (hide) the locket, at least until we decide if it should be destroyed or kept given its conceptual power.

Bigby pipes up. "There is one other thing, if none of the options on the table are 'speaking' to you..." He sighs and pulls some things out of his bag. "We know we're going to need allies. Our resources are stretched thin as it is. We know that there are those who wield historic power. The kind of power that will help against Vecna. Those who come from a time before him are of special importance. We can't rely on the Netherese; they can't be trusted; the dragons are occupied though we may call upon them yet; I've been considering reaching out to - other allies; they'd only be allies of convenience. They're difficult for us to comprehend. Their motivations differ from ours greatly, but we do share a common concern of Vecna asserting control over reality. **We need an envoy to speak to the giants**. They have memories that stretch back to before-times. When the time comes to assault Vecna's stronghold, we're doing to need the kind of power that the giants wield. We're pretty sure that Vecna has the allegiance of specific factions in Toril's lower planes. We were told that by people who escaped Toril - a strong lower plane involvement. We have very few allies in the upper planes. By our very natures we don't have natural allies there. But I do have a strong history with giant kind."

(Oswen's mind is stuck on: The Netherese?!)

Inafina says, "We barely made it out of there. It's only going to get worse. I think we need to finish what we started."

This gets Oswen out of her distraction! She's surprised. She looks to Bel and Kindle.

Bel answers first. "It's a risky dance but if we are both hurtling towards the same destination, we could benefit from riding the storm of that eye and hand. Anything that assures their mutual destruction can only be a good thing. And it will weaken Vecna."

Kindle doesn't answer directly but just says he thinks he could wield the sword fairly confidently and resist it. Bel points out "...though it doesn't just affect the person wielding it!"

The plan would be multi-stage and very difficult.

* Arkhan needs to get the eye, without it being suspicious
* Then he needs to actually use both
* Then we have to somehow corner him
* And somehow slay him!

Oswen thinks a minute and says, "It's been a bad day. For the four of us, for our friendship. And we've never really had that before and it's not actually our fault, but we have to recognise we'll probably have this sort of conflict again and possibly even worse."

Kindle says, "I agree, but we survived it. It tested us... We did not cave. Any one of us on our own, probably would! But united..."

Oswen sighs, "well, I guess that's that. I've no idea where to start; I suppose - well, *when* is Arkhan likely to be getting to Toril? If he's not there already, maybe we plant the Eye and leak information to him about where it is, so he thinks he's found it himself?"

People turn to Mordenkainen. He says, "What I'm aware of is that Otto has a plan underway. He needed to wait until Vi had left Baldur's Gate. The last thing he wants to do is risk her safety and the safety of her Resistance. They have moved Northwards. Our plan - Otto's plan - is to lure Arkhan to Baldur's Gate. There is still an open rift at Elturel. We need to give that a few days. The best deception always holds more than a kernel of truth; if we get the Eye to Baldur's Gate, there are some *very* bad actors there to whom we could leak information. That information will *definitely* find its way to Arkhan without us needing to do it. That'll get him to Baldur's Gate quick-smart!"

But he must be confronted and defeated *before* he has a chance to escape back to Avernus.

Discretion is needed - enough noise for the 'right' people to know about the Eye, but not so much noise that Vecna hears about it.

Mordenkainen says we have a "sympathiser" at Baldur's Gate; she can't be fully trusted but has a "vested interest" to help us. "She has motives of her own as well. She's been known to change allegiances through time!"

Oswen says, "Well it's a start. It's a start and it'll have to do."

"We can organise a meeting for you with her."

"On Toril? Baldur's Gate?"

"Yes".

Oswen pulls face. "Baldur's Gate. Couldn't you have picked somewhere *nice*?!"

"For what we're trying to do, you'll be thankful for Baldur's Gate's nature!"

We're too tired now. But tomorrow. And then there's the subject of spells. We need Leoman's Secret Chest, for a start. Alustriel shows the spell. Oswen is nearly out of ink, but Mordenkainen has some. Oswen copies that spell.

She also is shown Teleport and Teleportation Circle. She doesn't understand the first - it's quite a distance beyond her - but the second is within reach and thanks to Mordenkainen's ink she gets her own copy, but in exchange, he takes the Amulet Of Health they acquired a while ago. It's an attunement issue! Ice Knife and Silvery Barbs are copied, too.

Mordenkainen is keen to show us an object that might be helpful but, again, that'd be tomorrow; Oswen would need to trade for it! 

**(Side-note; relative to the RIPA campaign, we're now about 1mo behind, originally something like 6mo after Toril fell - even though we've experienced only what we'd call, very roughly, around 22 days since first meeting the Eight and scrying the Fall, we've been on many planes. In Outlands time, months have gone by and RIPA are now only a little ahead, with two rod segments - returned from the Astral Sea - and are probably now in Eberron, via the means established by Otto. Alustriel knows about Lambent Zenith by now).**

Late that evening, she and Leonidas get to spend time together. She cries a little, angry at herself for it really, but saying it's mostly out of relief. We're so lucky, despite the dangers, given we're free - far better off than many others we have encountered. He worries about her; she worries about him; they don't really want each other to worry! She wishes she'd brought him along from the start. It's too late now, really, and became so very quickly as danger escalated even way back in the Fey Wild. She fell into the whole thing accidentally, sort of.

"I trust your strange new family. *Our* family. I don't know what is going on with you all out there, so I just have to trust it. To trust us."

"One day we'll settle. Once it's safe. If it's ever safe!"

"I don't want to hold you back."

She laughs. "You're actually usually the one pulling me forward - in my head anyway - the thing I hold onto. Otherwise, I'd just be doing it for - well, I don't now. I don't think I'm selfless. I'm selfish - doing it for people *I* care about."

Eventually they sleep, curled up into a ball, in a hug.



## Campaign day 45

There is a smell of coffee and bacon. Leonidas and Oswen get dressed and head downstairs.

Kindle is helping the chef bring out food. The hearth is going. Froderick is happy, and has put up decorations! Surprisingly spirits are very high. The library team are present; it's a big group, all gathered around the Keep's large main table. Alustriel laughs at Bel's jokes while Bigby entertains with displays of lights. And of course there are various animals around the place, as usual.

Oswen HIS 16. She remembers Alustriel talking about the rod yesterday. "Yesterday you said you had two pieces; what does that mean? So is that two, plus ours for three, or are you counting the one we sent to the Golden Vault?"

Alustriel looks a bit sheepish... "Ah, the one you sent - you mean the one that - ... - the one that never arrived? That the Golden Vault never got? We got that one back!"

Oswen is shocked. "What happened?!"

Alustriel relays a story but, her being her, rather inaccurately! She does acknowledge she doesn't have the details. The Lambent Zenith never made it, and a team was sent to a wreck in the Astral Sea. They did find survivors and the piece itself - but had to kill some kind of astral monstrosity!

Oswen thinks back. Inda, Figaro the tiefling, Kycera the chef and Githyanki Lysan and Zastra. They made it, we're told? Wow. That's relief - along with a druid, a dog and a tree. Uuuh - OK.

"I'm glad they're OK. Shame about the ship though. It was a good ship."

"Rescuing people alive is more important. You can remake a ship!"

"Of course."

Oswen lends Alustriel her spell book. Alustriel says she's a bias; she was trying to collect back things that were not in her memory. She'd memorised mostly more powerful things that she might need at a drop of a hat with plenty of magic *items* to cover a lot of lower-level things (such as her staff). Not having the staff made her realise those aren't written down. It'll take her a long time, but Mordenkainen's not due back for a while yet.

Around lunch time, he arrives with a serious look on his face. He asks if we've heard from Otto. No... Bigby neither. They both exchange a glance. "I might try and contact him" says Bigby; he casts Sending. Meanwhile, Mordenkainen pulls out a classic Golden Vault box-within-a-box-within-a-box. Arcane lock. He shows Oswen how to unlock it. It's opened and, **suspended in the middle is the Eye**. It has a kind of wire basket around the edges so it can be removed without touching.

Then he produces something else. "I realised I hadn't been giving you anything for all the work you've done, so I had this made..."

It's a sort of flat instrument case, maybe 3ft long and 1.5ft wide, very ornate. He seems quite excited. He lays it on a low table and people start to gather as the activity and his enthusiasm has been getting their attention. Inside is a silky, starlight white robe, like a mage's robe. It has long lapels that hang down the front, a hood embroidered with silver silk thread; there are accents of blue/blue-green that match the blue of her current robe. She looks closer. Pumpkins, mushrooms, butterfly wings, fairy wings; other things to do with the Fey, and Sembia, and - well, seems to be just about any story she's shared. It seems he's listened closely.

She gives him a quizzical look and fast-casts Identify. Her eyes widen...

"At some points in a wizard's life they find themselves in need of an article of clothing that can kind of go it all. This is a newer style, but the original model - the enchantments and patterns - have been around for thousands of years. I don't want to send the wrong message, but we've been putting you in harm's way. You've been risking your life and your safety for us. I just thought it was only right that  I at least offer you this. You are under no obligation to take it! It can be a very personal thing. Don't read anything creepy into this..." - he tails off.

She clears her throat and says, "I'm actually a little lost for words. This is far more fancy and showy a design than I might admit I'd normally be comfortable with, but I see all the details. And it's our story and I'm deeply touched that you would have paid so much attention, and remembered it, and put this effort in. As for its utility, well I understand what this is and it's certainly a very powerful thing."

"Well this isn't from the Golden Vault - this if from *us*."

Oswen looks at Alustriel and realises that this is modelled from her robe as a base pattern.

(Well this explains why everyone here from the Eight gathered around so readily - not just curiosity or only Mordenkainen's excitement!)

She says, "Well, thank you! I feel a bit over-privileged; we work as a four, and indeed, as an extended team, the people of this keep and you. It's not just me, it's never been me. But I'm certainly grateful and if I feel over-dressed for an occasion, I can always use an illusion or another cloak! It's certainly undoubtedly very beautiful and very personal."

She hands over the Wand Of The War Mage +2 and Ring Of Protection, then carefully folds and packs her old cloak. Her hand rests on it a moment before it goes into the bag of holding. She's had that... Forever, really!

"It helps the group too" says Alustriel, "since they won't have to worry about you so much!"

Suddenly breaking the mood - Bigby hears back from Otto. "He's riding for his life! Arkhan is pursuing him, on Torril!"

**Sounds like it's time for us to leave.**

We don't know Otto as well as they do. But Bigby thinks that if Otto thinks he needed help he'd have asked. So it's more just a question of telling us to make haste! He's on Torril and close by, so we elect to go to Baldur's Gate immediately and get that side of the plan in motion as quickly as we can. But who is the "contact" (untrustworthy as they might be) there? Who do we look for?

"There is a small inn, 'The Flying Fish', just outside the city walls - a place called Wyrm's Crossing. Meet a female cleric there. They're the only one who can organise a meeting with the contact."

(We're given a short description, a half-elf, and a name - goes by many - but to gain trust, we should use **Shadowheart**).

Oswen hastily gets used to the new robe, but puts her cloak over it to make it a bit less "showy".

Best Oswen can do is Inn of Last chances, which she thinks is closer to the right side of town to get down to the bridge over the river and the inn in question. Hasty farewells, as if often the case; a quick hug for Leonidas, who opines that in her new robes she looks as "resplendent as any princess!" which makes her blush, and with one last look at the group and an intake of breath...

*POP*

### Baldur's Gate, Inn Of Last Chances

...the amulet moves us all into the dead centre of the crowded main room of the Inn of Last Chances - ARC was Nat 20+13 -> 33, a bit *too* accurate! - people are surprised and angry, Bel dropping a gold piece on the bar "I'm so sorry for the trouble!" - and hasten out of the door. As we step out without enough care, we almost collide with horse-drawn carriage; this is the main road to Basilisk Gate and there's a huge crowd. It's very noisy and an extremely jarring transition.

Oswen survival 11+5->16, head *away* from the gate. We're aiming for a settlement *built into* the huge bridge over the river. And we're on the wrong side of Hawkshead Hill. "That way!" she says, almost leaving the other three in the dust! Kindle is getting dirty looks because he's a bugbear; some scuttle away, others look like they might want to fight. And we notice that everyone is armed to the teeth. Armour and weapons are very obvious. She remembers that vibe. "Make sure your bags are secure, keep a sharp eye on all belongings and if you've got any scary looking weapons, make sure they're visible!"

It's dusty, smelly and hot. The sun is high; it feels like summer. Oswen is kinda head-down, keeping her group close but remembers **this is Toril under Vecna** and is not minded to try and talk to anyone.

Inafina's perception is almost overloaded; sound and smell is all over the map. But her *insight* (15+7) still functions. It's not just people wanting to get into the gate that's causing a lot of noise and angst. There's more; a feeling of desperation. Selfishness, something running deeper than "it's just Baldur's Gate". *Everyone* she sees is on guard and people have no tolerance at all. She bends down and whispers a warning to Oswen to not trust people and try not to reach out for help unless strictly needed; she suspects outcomes would be poor.

It's strange. She overhears people seemingly being polite at times, but it seems shallow; fake; as if it were just an expectation, going through the motions, with a deep suspicion hidden below. Ah! **It's a kind of paranoia. Nobody knows who they can trust. That's going to make our lives a bit more difficult** given what we're trying to do.

It takes 40 or more minutes to get to the bridge. We go through a sort of caravan and bazaar area, which Bel thinks might be a **good place to hide and to get information**. After that, set back across some fields, is a beautiful white stone keep, perhaps the centre of an independent village before the city sprawled out. We're getting around the big hill now and there are quite a few more slum-like areas, along with farmland; the smell gets worse with animals, manure and so-on in the mix and, soon, we go past a huge slaughterhouse which hardly improves the mood! Then we reach an area with a sign "Sow's Foot", saying livestock animals can't go past there, as in, can't go back behind us, into the city further.

It's all a bit of a blur and gives us an impression of how much, for all its faults, there must be to investigate in this big city but as is so often the case we're on a mission and time is short.

The road turns and starts to go uphill going through a pass of sorts between the hill and an adjacent moderate height escarpment. Buildings have ended at this point and it feels for a moment like a road between towns, but very busy; we're small, on foot and need to watch out for the wagons, caravans and other heavy/tall movement here.

We go past a small sort of guard house at the top that can see either side of the pass and can see down into another settlement. It's almost quaint! Two church spires; well, maybe one is just a bell tower, the other part of the church, hard to say at this distance. The river beyond is vast, maybe 1000-2000ft *across* and the giant bridge, joining to a settlement on the far bank, crosses at a narrower, but still wide point with a huge rock (which we learn later is **Wyrm's Rock**) at around the half-way point which allows it to have two spans. The bridge itself is extraordinary; it's massive, with buildings on either side of the carriageway.

The vast majority of people around are human. It's not just Kindle getting funny looks. Oswen, Inafina, Bel and Kindle (in that order) decide to head down to the bridge and start searching for the inn as we cross - we don't know if it's *on* the bridge or across in the other town (or elsewhere! If it comes to it, we'll ask someone).

The settlement here was clearly an existing village before merging and being considered part of Baldur's Gate. The church is quite impressive. The area still has a feeling of independence; a sign says, **Twin Songs**. An abbey on the other side of the village is perhaps the reason for the name - religious institutions on either side. Oswen religion 16, doesn't recognise the iconography; where she'd expect symbols of a god she sees something else. And the abbey is the same. No statue of a goddess or a monk; a sort of faceless statue instead. She points, locking eyes with Kindle and says, "Faceless statues. My best guess is there's only one religion left now, and that would be Vecna." He points at words above an entranceway, "Last Hope Asylum" - it's not even a church. Perhaps that's how you rewrite history without rewriting the physical space; invent new uses/meanings for specific types of "thing".

The bridge, closer up, looks more like two bridges than one, such is the size of the central(ish) rock. There are even two drawbridges either side of the centrepiece which we think could be lifted to isolate each side, as well as the centre itself, for whatever reason.

A sign indicates that we're entering Wyrm's Crossing and Baldur's Gate "insurances, indemnities" etc. etc. "do not apply here". So that's the legal boundary of the city, essentially. There is a complex list of strange exclusions, listing trade guild guarantees and more; "activities on Wrym's Crossing are not the responsibility of the Flaming Fist" it finishes.

Inafina remarks, "For a city that feels lawless it certainly seems to have a lot of laws!"

Orvil flies up to start looking at buildings lower on the bridge piers, while the rest of us slowly move forward and search. Inafina insight 17, "we don't know which end it is, but it might be difficult for us to ask - didn't they say that it was a cleric?" Oswen nods, "Yes, not anymore I guess!" "And if you *were* a cleric you wouldn't announce your presence." "Yes, definitely; so we need to find the place first and then we'll do our usual tricks - a bit of mind-reading if we really need to, else, just watch and try to judge - assess as best we can."

The bridge buildings aren't just businesses as she expected; there are residences here. Some are broken though - as if building extensions have fallen off into the river! Given that prior list of "inapplicable indemnities", it seems that people just do whatever they want here.

Inafina quietly warns the group that we're being watched more than we were before, perhaps because there are more people here that are 'static' - part of the bridge's community, rather than a river of people just passing through. The area looks run down and poor, too, and we're clearly not poor. Oswen suddenly feels *very* self-conscious about her new robe. She pulls her old cloak around and over to try and hide more of it.

Orvil ADV perception 22. He spots an inn matching the description on the Baldur's Gate side of the central rock. It's certainly very small! He relays the position to Oswen who leads the way to check it out at "ground" level. We don't rush; we're on alert, given all the attention on us.

The name over the door - **The Flying Fish** - confirms it. We head inside and are greeted by a woman missing part of one ear, partly covered by her hair most of the time. "Afternoon. Can I help you?!" "Are we too late for food?" "Food?! Yes. We don't serve food here. Only rooms. We don't do board."

"Oh, of course, my mistake; we hoped to meet an old friend here."

"Can't tell you names of guests!"

Orvil tries to fly up behind the desk to see if he can spot anything that might give away resident names. But the owner spots him immediately, and starts swatting with a broom! Inafina uses that moment to check the book on the desk; SOH 17+5! 22. She spots just one person booked in. **Alurum Mysorina**. HIS is 1-1 -> 0! So while Oswen pretends to fuss and apologise, and once Orvil is "chased out" (but Oswen just pops him into the Fey the minute he's outside), Inafina says, "So how much would a room or rooms be, for the four of us, for the night?" "2 rooms next to each other?" "That'll be 2sp for each room, per night." Inafina makes a show of search for coins. Two keys are produced and given to us. "Room 3 in and room 5". Inafina says thanks, she appreciates the security about not giving names away, *her* name is Inafina and if by chance the innkeeper does hears of our friend Alurum then could she please tell her we'll be at - well, what's a good nearby tavern - "a *good* tavern?!" - "well, OK, a close by one" - "the crossing, a bit bigger and cheaper, the **Hiltguard**... Might be a bit more your speed..." Inafina laughs and says, "honestly, we're not that fancy, but I take your point. Well, we'll head there and be here for the night after."

We make a show of going upstairs to check out the rooms. There are six in total and once we're out of earshot crammed into one of our two, Inafina explains quietly what happened and why she said what she said. Oswen HIS 17 recognises an old-fashioned elven name. It seems likely that this one person staying here is who we want. And given Inafina's directions, we agree that we should go to the tavern.

Realising we'd rushed it a bit, we spend a little bit of time packing things away more securely. Just before we leave, from within the room, perception 22, Inafina hears a gentle knocking on the door across the hall. She hears the innkeeper telling the lady there about our enquiry. "Were you expecting anyone?" A low female voice answers, "Not presently, not particularly now... That's interesting, well, thanks for the message. I'll look for them there I guess! Thanks!"

The door closes and footsteps of the innkeeper head away down the stairs.

Oswen decides to front-foot it, heads over the door and quietly knocks. "What now?!" "Sorry, different person!" "I'm not expecting anyone. I know there's no room service!" Oswen chuckles and says, "Yes I didn't want to scare you, the innkeeper was very good about not giving any information on people who stay here, so we're the ones who asked about you by name - we could just meet in your room if you feel safer there, else go to the Hildguard if you prefer?"

The door opens. A person stood there is holding a spear, levelled a bit above Oswen's head - but quickly adjust downwards. It looks expensive and glows with radiant light. Oswen points at it and says, "Ah, for sure", she says, "you must be" (whispers) "Shadowheart?" - the half-elf has white hair, tied back; black eyebrows, shadowy-grey armour. "My name is Oswen and we have been sent."

"You're not a dwarf!" - and we realise she was maybe expecting Otto.

We explain who we are; about Vecna; we learn that the abbey should've been of Silune, the half-elf's goddess. The church was for Lathendar. She knows of Vi in person and Otto only by voice.

A question of trust arises. How can we prove our story? We could call Otto on the sending stone; she'd have to do it, to hear the response.

D20 -> 14. As Oswen opens the bag, Shadowheart drops her spear and starts clutching her head! She doubles over with pain. A mark on her hand starts glowing! "What was *that*! You don't have - you can't have? Do you have?!" - all half sentences. "You - you wouldn't happen to have encountered creatures from the far realm?" Ah! So *that's* it. We tell the story of the shard, in brief.

"So you don't know who you were talking to there... I think I do. **A very, very old and very powerful Elder Brain**. I'm connected to a very old and powerful Elder Brain myself - not by choice, I was infected, as were several other people I've met with and travelled with since!"

"You recognise the feeling of it?"

"Yes. I'm certain that's who the shared is connected to."

"Right. Well, I'll have to be more cautious about their help in future I suppose!"

"Ultimately, they were true to their word with us; if they weren't, I and my fellow travellers - warriors - would have turned into mind flayers by now. We were all infected with a tadpole."

"Oh. We knew a giant who had that problem. They went on a quest to try and figure it out, I hope they succeeded..."

"Are you telling me there's a way to remove one?!"

We explain there *might* be something with the Githyanki. They say they tried it and it didn't work - at least, their approach. "But your friend might have a different fate."

Anyway, Owen gives her the sending stone. "If you introduce yourself however you want, just say you're with Oswen's party at Baldur's Gate and wondered how close Otto is getting, or something."

(While all this happens, Inafina, insight 21, is reading to see if she seems legit. And it seems that she is - she's very suspicious of *us*, but gradually relaxing. She's somewhat isolated and friendless for some reason; why is she here, at this place?)

After a while she says - "well, how can I help you?" - so *that* worked! Otto is crossing the plains of Elturel, apparently. Hard to say how far away - maybe 2 days.

Oswen starts to talk in more detail about the Eye, but before she can say much, Inafina interrupts to ask straight up... "I know you don't really know us or trust us yet. But that works two ways. We're told to meet you, so there's some trust at the core, but the things we carry and our task here are very dangerous and very delicate, respectively. I wonder - can you speak more about yourself? Tell us how *you* came to be here? Everything is in confidence." Bel tries to offer some supporting words too; ADV persuasion 17+2 -> 19.

Shadowheart looks concerned. Weighing up the situation. Hasn't confided for a long time.

It takes a while, coaxing things out. "I'm not lying to you. I'm here for my own reasons, but my friends have been captured. I'm trying to find a way to help them, but it's not looking hopeful. I met your friend - Vi - because of her role in the Resistance. My friends are, well, kind of strong-willed! They perhaps underestimated the seriousness of the situation we were in. *You* appear to have a better grasp of the gravity of this - *grip* - that Vecna has. They got taken; I don't know where; Vecna has the imprisoned somewhere. I have two other old friends who managed to escape capture and are in hiding - it's too risky to try and get in touch. We stand out. A bit like you. The two of them more than me, especially here in Baldur's Gate for one of them."

"Unusual races?"

"A little bit. One of them is a tiefling - well, *looks* like a tiefling, huge horns on their head! - happens to be the *estranged* son of Duke Ravengard, commander of the Flaming Fist. Estranged by account of the events that caused him to get those horns on his head - but he's a good man and he did it for the right reasons. He's done a lot of good. But his father doesn't view it that way."

"How many of your friends got captured?"

"Six."

"Any leads at all?"

"None. It's harder to hold onto hope with each passing week. But Vi is right; there are much bigger problems at hand. That's why I believe *our* goals ultimately are aligned. As is this double-edged sword that you want me to introduce you to!"

"Yes - quite - and on that topic,who exactly *is* that?"

"She is a - I believe - she is a lich. Or at least a very powerful wizard. She might be both."

"That's not an encouraging start. But that said, we've found allies in the most unlikely places and of the most unlikely kinds in our travels."

"Exactly that. She's been true to her word with me; I crossed swords with her once, but I enlisted her help to try and find my friends. You see, I recall her as someone of impressive influence and power. But she is somewhat a shadow of herself. **It seems Vecna suppresses those who oppose him, anyone with power; for whatever reason she's decided not to pledge fealty to him**. 

We explain what we need to do regarding the Eye and Arkhan. She looks very conflicted; Inafina senses huge misgivings.

* She figures her role is to introduce us to the lich.
* She worries that the plan is hard; it's difficult enough convincing the lich to help at the "best" (FSVO "best") of times. Shadowheart went through a *lot* to get any sort of boon from her.
* "I don't trust her. I really don't. As long as there's something that she can gain out of it, I think she'll help. But I just don't see it in this plan. How are you going to persuade her?"

"Do you think a revenge angle help? She gets revenge by helping to further the weakening and defeat of Vecna?"

"She'd probably help to defeat Vecna, but it's the artefact. I don't know how you'd persuade her to *give away* this artefact to another person. And even more worrying for me, what if she chooses to do something else? How do you *make* her do you what you want?"

"We don't have that plan yet! We didn't know much at all about this contact until speaking to you."

There is to-and-fro. We've been here before; not enough information and analysis paralysis. We might just have to make this up as we go along, *again*!

In the end it's agreed. We head to the tavern we were thinking of before while Shadowheart moves out to get in touch with this mystery lich.

We go through with the tavern idea; we'll get food and drink, get a feel for local life a bit. It might be useful later, who knows. The Hiltguard is one of the bigger buildings on this part of the bridge, with rooms on several levels, mostly downwards into the stonework. It might've been an earlier building in construction as it seems built into the fabric of the bridge itself.

We order some ale and a hearty stew. We choose an open spot, where we're clearly visible at the end of a communal table, to gauge reaction. When we walk in there's no noticeable change in conversation, but they do still stare as they do it! At least here, she doesn't think a single person who is not very aware of *everything* around them, including us and our unusual appearance, so in a strange that's calming - everyone notices us because of course they should, we're not humans, and that's just part of life in this version of Wrym's Crossing. Maybe it's always like this, Vecna or not.

Food and ale arrives. Bel pays.

If we try to strike up a conversation, people are superficially friendly. There's no "crisis point" being discussed. People aren't pointing towards some imminent doom or specific world event. Things are just generally, almost *routinely* on edge; there are common complaints but they seem almost painfully mundane. Basic survival seems to be the main issue! People are *very* poor, borderline destitute, with several of them clearly looking like they are injured with injuries that seem they might even be permanent.

People might owe money. People are looking for a score. A way to ease their debt and pain, probably at the expense of others.

Oswen knows we'd like to help. Kindle could heal, but can't regrow limbs, or heal blindness, or fix debts! And the attitude is entirely forgivable in the circumstances. If we try to help, we'd be a fly's wings beating in a hurricane.

Inafina, listening, perception 13+7->20, a hushed smuggling deal going down. Negotiation over pay. No idea what they're smuggling as the language is very coded. And she gradually realises that anyone making *any* kind of money here is engaging in crime. This place isn't policed. There's no constant surveillance.

"Can we use this?" she asks. "If this is where all these deals go down, we could just have this shiny thing, this important object; it gets bartered for, or stolen, or whatever. Maybe it'll draw Arkhan to it, somehow."

Oswen has to check in with L3 Sending to find out where Otto might be coming in - North gate into the city, or via this bridge from the south? Turns out, he's somewhere significantly N-E of us and will come in from the North.

In the end, after a long time spent with the spellbook, Oswen elects for a longshot. We end up back at the inn, window open in our room, trying Divination. She's thinking of Gond and the TL;DR is, how can we persuade the lich. It's a weak connection. The smoke swirls; equations form, pros, cons, possibilities. Plans of action form but then dissipate as if someone were crossing things out. And in the end, it coalesces to a statement, written in the smoke - "**Probability of convincing the lich to do your bidding: zero**".

Bel sighs. "Rats! That's just typical, isn't it? Another wild goose chase!"

After we talk more, Oswen wonders if it's a question of reverse psychology. Perhaps we need to shield our minds against reading and try to tell this lich what we *don't* want. "Arkhan mustn't get this, he'd be too powerful". Something like that. It's our least worst of several plans, but it's still a terrible plan!

We need a break so Inafina and Bel go to their room. Kindle and Oswen remain. Kindle is concerned; she knows a talk is coming. "Are you OK? Did you want to check in on home?"

She goes bright red and then after a pause says, "I - I honestly didn't even think of that!" - with everything going on. Besides, scrying is really the only way to check on distant Ordulin and she couldn't do that much in a day.

A note is pushed under the door at that moment! Well, we might as well talk face to face. We open the door and let her in; the news is - the lich will meet us; she goes by many names, but Shadowheart knows her as **Velindra Shadowmantle**. VS has suggested a place in Little Calimshan (which we learn is the name of that caravans and market-like area we'd passed through on the way here). We should meet in **The Noon Sun**.

"I still don't know that this is a good idea. Remember she is *veyr* powerful. She only helped me because there was something she wanted and me getting what I wanted helped her getting what she wanted."

Oswen nods. "I agree. But I just don't know any other way."

"It closes its gates soon. Maybe an hour. I can't get you in after; you need to head there right away. She's waiting!"

That's not what we expected, but it'll do. We thank Shadowheart, hope she gets news of her friends, say if we do find anything out ourselves we'll let her know and we hope we meet again! **We start to rush out** - but she grabs Oswen's hand just as we're leaving:

"Be careful."

"As much as we can be - yes."

So it is that we rush back up the same road, still very busy, doing our best with at least a majority of the traffic going the same direction. As a result it doesn't take long, 15-20 minutes or so.

It's off the main road, with 15ft high walls, beautiful towers with onion-dome tops along the walls, around 30ft tall each and a few others inside too. It seems quite big; in a way, a little town of its own. Alternating red and beige blocks of stone are used in decorative ways and the domes are covered in metals or ceramics right up to the tips. There are guards standing at the gates; as we approach they nod and warn us - "The gates close in 40 minutes!" - "Thank you, we know!"

Inside there's a beautiful kind of open-air designed central building visible, with market stalls and many animals in a main stables section. Buildings are usually multi-storey and seem to often have living spaces above. Walls and gates and archways seem to section off parts of the town within, each of which are guarded. We ask one of the guards about "Noon Sun". They point the way and we hurry.

The dress is different; people sit outside places with cups of tea; Bel really wants to spend more time here. He wonders why they kick people out at night!

In the adjacent section, the guards have different uniforms. Strange for such a small space to divide itself thus and Oswen can't help but ask a guard. Turns out they represent different cities of their nation, which all have differing customs and dress codes. They point the direct way to the Noon Sun too. Easy to find. A low building with a sweeping roofline made of cloth, dropping down from a tower into a corner. Oswen casts Intellect Fortress at L5 to cover the whole party except herself. Her new robe hopefully provides sufficient protection; a lich shouldn't be able to (say) read minds naturally; it'd need magic.

We're greeted and asked if we're here to drink or meet someone or similar. When we mention the VS name, eyebrows are raised and we're immediately taken up to a balcony on a first floor, secluded, with a barrier of various potted plants. "My lady, your guests *did* arrive!" they say.

"Take a seat" says the lady in question.

Plush cushions. A low table. "Sorry we're late!"

"I'm curious. What do you have over Shadowheart? I like to know who I'm dealing with and what their assets may be."

Oswen says "She and we have some common allies and some common goals."

"Like that, is it! Very well."

"Well, we don't know each other. Trust is low initially, but hopefully improves; trust is earned!"

"Yes. Shall we, then?" asks VS - she casts magic to move table out of the way - "I presume we're not here to chit-chat and drink cups of tea!" - and then she casts Zone of Truth. "If you would like, join me in it." She steps in.

Oswen simply says, "I _said_ trust is _earned_ - that's a one-sided spell and you know it!" and steps in. But her CHA save is only 13, so she fails that save.

Inafina next, ADV save dirty 20; succeeds. Velindra raises her eyebrow. "Wouldn't have expected that". Kindle 19, which actually fails. Lastly, Bel; succeeds, just. "Now *that* I expected!" says VS.

"So" says Oswen, "You have the advantage".

"I have nothing to hide from you."

"Well, you do; your motivations, allegiances, powers, objects of note you might have or require; all of these things could be lied about."

"Very well. I will answer some of those. I'm extremely powerful, but not as powerful as I would like to be. There have been some limits placed on my abilities. Limits that have taken me some time to understand and longer to accept. Other changes, which *could* work out in my favour in the long run - such as this spell that we stand in right now - six months ago I wouldn't have been able to cast this, but **in a world with an absence of divinely granted magic, everything becomes arcane.** It's taken me a while a master some of these other forms of magic but they have their uses. A bit of a blunt instrument though. So, why did you want Shadowheart to call in a favour."

"We an object that is very powerful and we've become aware that a companion object is being used by a creature that's now on this plane. If the two were brought together, they could be extremely powerful and it would be very very dangerous and really could distort the balance of power on the world if that happened."

"Alright. And you have it?" - she waits. The question is hanging. Then says, "You haven't answered my question."

"We are not powerful enough to wield this artefact. It would consume us and we would lose ourselves. You on other hand might be."

"Are you going to tell me what it is?"

Oswen says, "Of course, this early in our discussion, I'd rather not. But since I'm compelled to, were you to ask me directly, I see no point in delaying. The creature with the one object is Arkhan the Cruel, with the Hand of Vecna."

"I have heard of those. Thankfully he is safely busy in Avernus serving his fickle mistress."

Oswen shakes her head. "He rides across the plains of Elturel at this moment."

"In which direction?"

"Towards us."

"That's a problem? Why is he coming here? It wouldn't have anything to do with your presence here would it?"

"Regrettably yes. Because we have other object. We have the eye."

"But does he know that?"

"I don't know."

"So why does he come here?"

"He chases an ally and *he* knows about us."

Inafina insight 25. When she speaks, she realises Velindra kind of disregards anything that Bel or she says. She's focused on the people who're affected by the truth spell. Bel is talking a lot but VS isn't really responding.

Oswen does her best; truthfully saying that she's afraid of Arkhan having both. He'd be too powerful and would never partner with *us*, he'd just kill us. VS wants to know if we have the eye carried openly; technically no; VS gets the idea (good!) that we have it; then casts Dominate Person to force Oswen to "show it" (WIS save only 15). Inafina jumps to her feet as Oswen starts to comply; Bel casts Counter-Charm. A flash of anger from VS! Re-rolled WIS save is 21. And that saves.

Oswen is very angry. "I don't have to do that!"

Now a force-push is thrown against Bel. He is knocked flying backwards. Oswen shouts to VS, "You can't let him have it - he won't partner with you, we must be careful!" "I don't intend to let him have it; why would I let him have it? You're foolish enough to bring an artefact that powerful here, when you know that he is coming here? Do you have any idea what he could do to my city? Give it to me. You have caused enough trouble as it is. You have *no* idea what you've got yourselves into. Give it to me."

Oswen HIS 17. She remembers that divination to Gond. Something about it... Felt important...

Bel calls out "don't give it to her".

Oswen ARC 31. She's trying to assess how powerful VS is. Difficult to resist her spells. Can we resist? Can we attack? We know almost nothing about her - artefacts, anything - there's a *slim* chance we could hold her off, but we might not all survive. In fact we'd probably not. She seems so powerful... It would take someone very powerful who had a powerful artefact to take her down. And that's when the plan is obvious.

Still under a zone of truth, "It looks like I have no choice if we want to keep our lives. But I won't forget or forgive this."

Bel starts to run forward to stop Oswen, but the Zone drops and Bel is stopped in his tracks. VS must be using something telekinetic. Kindle and Inafina moves together, but Oswen stands between them and VS and says, "The only way to defeat Vecna is if we live another day. We've lost this battle. We haven't lost everything yet. Stand down. You *must* stand down. *Trust* me."

Inafina INS 16; Kindle, very high; Inafina is uncertain but Kindle steps back and that's enough.

From the bag of holding, Oswen pulls the "suspended" eye. She shows it but does not offer it. VS says, "thank you" - reaches out, takes it - a almost maniacal look; a shift in the face; she's being influenced; and before we even get to look away, she **rips out her own eye** with the other hand and then forces in Vecna's eye instead.

And she smiles!

"Oh my. I'd forgotten how this feels. Thank you... I don't know if this is what you intended to happen today but it doesn't matter. I'm not cruel... I do have the best interests of Baldur's Gate at heart... And if you do as well, then surely you can see how this is not defeat, but victory for us all."

She reaches into her coat and pulls out a silk bag. She puts it into Oswen's hand; "you've done everyone a fantastic service. You should be proud of yourself. You may have just saved all 150,000 souls here in Baldur's Gate"...

...And she teleports away.
