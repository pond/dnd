# Oswen: Part 2.10
## Campaign day 23
### Wonderhome, Outlands

Today we move on. The refugees know about the halfling hills beyond, and may choose to move onto there, but our path takes us elsewhere. We have the difficult monastery on the lake edge to consider, along with - if we dare - the mine where the Giants encountered the malign 'consciousness' that now afflicts their dreams. We consult sketches of maps.

The pragmatic choice seems to be, to try and figure out this strange consciousness issue. We don't really know anything about it but if we could at least investigate that, then on the way back we can get to the monastery before going around the lake to finish up back at the tower.

We have learned nothing of the Eye or Hand at Wonderhome, but they just aren't into ancient evil historical magical artefacts! Trade Gate is probably still our lead option there.

With that decision made, we bid our farewells and head off towards the River Ma'at. Oswen with Bel's help remembers (HIS ADV 23) the information from the giants, which is useful in conjunction with her written notes as they were a bit terse and rushed! The two of them have a decent idea of where to head, but Inafina confronts the "elephant in the room" - what are we expecting to find and how do we deal with this "mind invading" things? We have no specific defenses and could just end up as badly off as the Giants, or worse, given that we get the impression these creatures are a primitive version of mind flayers and might even *consume* intellect.

Oswen swapped in Detect Thoughts and Intellect Fortress in the morning, but that's no guarantee and at her highest spell level she can only help 3 of our group. We fall quiet for a while, all lost in thought as we walk.

The direction we take is roughly West, as much as that makes sense in the Outlands. No roads lead there directly. Bel and Oswen discuss route options; and then we realise - **we had the scale all wrong**. Talk of "the lake" was something we took to mean the lake by the giant tower and near Trade Gate. But no... It turns out there is a *vast* lake spireward and anticlockwise (sort of West of the tower). Between references we can see visually, especially with Orvil's help, and the drawn map, we start to realise that it's all on a *whole* different scale - hundreds of miles in size! As they begin to realise the scale, it starts to seem more like an inland sea.

To start with, we need to negotiate a small river between the plateau upon which the Ma'at starts, over to the West (ish), and Wonderhome. We ask - still on the outskirts of town, with plenty of people about - and are told there's a bridge, downstream. We think we'll then need to come back upstream, kind of West and Rimward, in order to access the plateau via a more climbable set of hills and slopes out that way. Directly West it's just all cliffs.

One step at a time! We head for the bridge. There's actually another small town there, just beyond the sprawl of Wonderhome. There are all manner of residents - Gardianls, Barriors, humans and a cluster of Dragonborn, especially over the river. There's even a small port, straddling the river.

Perfect; people who travel and hear gossip! We could ask about the Hand and Eye but local knowledge about any stories "going on up on that plateau, in the caves" - things that get into your head - could be very handy. We are spoiled for choice, though - there are three taverns and two inns! Never mind anything else, or places that are closed; it's quite early after all.

Inafina, insight 19, as we figure - stereotypically! - a more seedy or busy bar would be better. One certainly seems more boisterous - "The Troll", by the bridge. It's built *into* one side of the bridge, helping anchor it. She points it out and we go there.

Lots of ("real", not disk!) food and drink around, even early in the day; parts that seem to stretch *under* the bridge deck where you can sit on terraces. We order some light breakfast and try to find a place to sit that's in the middle of the action. But the whole place is busy... no free tables, but big tables so we could ask to join one; or maybe sit at the bar. Some of the characters seem to be from lower planes, so we figure we'd do well to avoid them! We start at the bar, anyway, to get things going. 2gp for all four, breakfast and a drink.

We try to strike up a conversation. Bel leads, of course; persuasion a lucky 19+12 -> 31. There's no pretence, interestingly; this is about local knowledge and insight. Clearly not the first time these sorts of questions have come this person's way in the last hour or two! What we get in return is a series of recommendations of people or groups we could talk to.

But there is **nothing** about the strange goings-on up there - whatever creatures might be in the cave. They just get traders and merchants; they don't usually come in from that way. No trading town out that way. Only if there was, who knows, maybe a mine or something... Well, we do know of an old mine. Perhaps ask the barges, then. As for travel, the Harbourmaster can tell us how to get to almost *anywhere* that touches the lake. Well, the Ma'at *cliffs* certainly start there!

Once we're done with food and drink we start with barges. There are a few, so we figure we should try to see something dusty - rock dust, or gravel, or similar. Not wood or crates/other goods. Kindle - perception 12+8 -> 20. Easy! Some gravel is being uploaded from a barge with a couple of similar ones adjacent that seems to be a specific area for that kind of barge and the heavy items they carry - heavier duty cranes and pulleys. We try to enquire about anyone who might've traded with, now or historically, a mine that might be up on the plateau - near the Ma'at - but nope. Nobody's ever heard of it.

No good, then. The last thing we do is to track down the Harbourmaster. There's an area that definitely looks administrative so we go towards a small building there. It's quite busy inside and we're never sure if we really meet that person, but someone overhearing points at a boat that might be "heading in that direction" - but that means headed *below* the cliffs. But they do go that way routinely, so we track them down; we wonder if they've ever seen any kind of cave entrances or similar, or just a big bluff of rock? This group of people is unusual, all with some kind of mixed ancestry which makes them hard to place in terms of origin or even species. They're civil but not directly friendly - we are, after all, interrupting their day.

We're told - of course there are caves there! But some only go in a few feet. One of them seems a bit grumpy and tells us we're asking the wrong question; clearly, we want to get to the top of the plateau! There are some old tracks that are disused but might still be walkable, if we can find them. Or we might forge our own way. They claim that our plan of going a certain way up to less steep mountains and cliffs doesn't really help and most people would be forced to go all the way around, for a journey that takes some 3 weeks (well, maybe 2!), unless very familiar with certain passes or tracks that they know. It's snowy up there and glaciated, which makes it much harder than it seems by looking at the distance we are now.

There's a pier along that way and they do take passengers. However uncertain we are about these cliffs, it would be foolish to ignore local knowledge and we ask what the payment would be for the four of us. "One blue tile each!" "Is there a place where we can exchange metals for tiles?!" "Ha! Well if you have metals - to convey you there, 1 gold each. If you can keep warm yourselves, then no more than that; otherwise, rent the cabin below deck to keep warm."

We have cold weather gear, so pay the 4gp. They depart as soon as loaded. Meet back in an hour.

We wander around town. Our eye is caught by the "Wondrous Bazaar", a trinket/gadget shop but this close to Wonderhome that might be what passes for magic items. We go inside. We're greeted by a Tiefling, with sort of dusty, burned-red skin. "Welcome. You look like you're passing through?" - smalltalk; we're invited to browse.

We try browsing but it's rather chaotic. Each thing is individually separated and well presented, but with no apparent ordering. We go back and ask if there's anything that might fortify mental defences against potential attack. He leads us to a set of beautiful crystals, each placed inside a display case. Oswen tries to figure them out, but Aracana is only 17. Maybe! She's read about stuff like this.

There are other options. These are expensive, require attunement and the mode of operation is a bit vague. A stone of luck, perhaps; essentially +1 to saving throws. Oswen is permitted to spend time Ritual-casting Identify for the two. The crystal, a blue one in the less expensive tier (the most was 50,000gp!) - ah, the Ioun Stone of Self Preservation, 10,000gp. A +1 bonus to INT saving throws; it's locked into that. The others are Ioun Stones of various power levels. A Stone of Good Luck on the other hand is much more powerful so she fears a high price (Stone of Good Luck is a +1 bonus to all ability checks and saving throws) but the price is only 1,200gp. That sounds too good to be true but Oswen is excited. Requires attunement of course but would surely come in handy. That's the one, at least it's a start.

We elect to pay for this, but keep looking... So Oswen spends time on Detect Magic as a ritual, too. As she's doing this, the seller looks interested. "What are you casting?" "Detect Magic - see if anything else catches my eye, in colour or intensity. I can stop if you prefer?" "I would rather you didn't!" Curious. Well, just the one stone then. Done! We are wished safe sailing across the lake.

Outside, Inafina (insight 20+7) reveals that she didn't get a good vibe. Doesn't trust the shopkeeper. He probably didn't want Detect Magic up in order to hide something. At least the stone is legit, though we may have overpaid?

"*Is* it a working stone, though?" asks Infina and Oswen gets that sinking feeling.

We find a quiet corner close by and Oswen re-does Identify fully for the stone. It's *cursed*. She'd have advantage on checks (once a day) but the next two would be *worse* off. It doesn't need attunement even for that. But if she attuned to it, she'd become cursed herself!

Rats! BUT - better *we* have this than someone else. Bel is angry and wants money back, but Oswen tries to convince him, that we now understand what we have and if someone else got this and didn't realise quickly enough then the consequences would be worse. But Inafina is indignant too. Lawful, after all. She wants to find some kind of Law in this town, in what little time we have left!

Bel's mostly annoyed that we were "had"! Oswen accepts fault; and she'd rather keep the item, to avoid it falling into unsuspecting hands. We won't demand our money back. But she accepts Inafina's point - stop other people getting "had" too. Bel starts asking around (persuasion 12+12). 24. We're directed to an office with a constable who asks if we have a crime to report; we explain. If we formally make a charge, we would have to come to the shop. We agree, but we're aware that it's our word against theirs.

Once again Bel leads the way. There's another customer in the shop when the five of us turn up - an "oh shit" surprised look, then concern, on the face of the shop keeper; they say something to the other guest and then start to run! "Stop, you cheat!" shouts Bel and swiftly casts Hold Person. It works - the shop keeper gets to the back door but then freezes in place. "Well," says the constable. "I think that answers the question!"

The constable ties the tiefling's arms, sits him down and says - strangely - "Explain yourself!"

He tries to talk out of it. He says we can have our money back. But the constable isn't happy, as others have made complaints previously. He's targeted tourists. "Is it *my* fault they're so trusting?!"

Bel reaches boiling point. "STOP!" he shouts, and gets into a proper rant. "We want reparations!"

The question is, can the shopkeeper ever be trusted. SOME items here are legit. So, maybe overpriced for tourists; but they sell what they say they sell. The constable ends up imposing conditions.

* All items must be Identifiable. There'll be a sign outside warning people to do so.
* For a short while this will even mention that the seller cannot be trusted!
* But even so, they can sell provided people Identify.

The seller is unimpressed and says they'll just pack up and leave. Well, that's their choice!

The constable gives us back our 1200gp. We are told we can keep the item or hand it over and they'll deal with it. We hand it over - it feels more correct, rather than it feeling almost now like we scammed the seller in return and got the stone for free. Even though we think we might've been able to magically remove the curse.

It'll be messy for the seller - the goods in the shop will be temporarily confiscated and re-identified. Anything dangerous or cursed will be removed. Whether or not the seller decides to stick around and try to do the right thing, or something close to it, well - so be it.

We get back to the boat barely in time.

Bel is bursting to tell the story! He starts recounting it rather unprompted. But the people on the boat are actually interested in the gossip. One person bought something as a gift and is now wondering if it was bad! There's a bit of accidental reverse racism - can't accuse a Tiefling...

A short while later, we cast off. We sail around an hour downriver before entering the huge lake, or sea. It's a very different feeling here. There are quite big waves, again reinforcing the feeling of a sea, but it's fresh water so doesn't have the "seaweed" smell. We turn and almost head back on ourselves to keep closer to the bank and get across towards the mountains and cliffs, the closer ones being an extension of a huge set that stretch rimward well beyond what we can see. As we get closer, ice floes float past near us, glaciers visible at the shore. Some of the crew prefer to go below, perhaps because some feel the cold more than others.

We start putting on our warm gear!

It's quite beautiful, in fact, sailing between the ice floes towards the ever-growing mountains. There's a lot of life around too, both birds and fish shoals clearly visible in the clear waters, even though swimming deep - presumably beyond the reach of the birds.

The cliff close to where we will disembark, towards the end of the day, is 120-150ft high and impressive but not sheer. It could be manageable - we hope so! There's a bit of a kind of rock beach at the bottom from fallen parts. It's a red coloured sandstone, with the giant tower being golden grey sandstone - either from a change in the stone higher up, or perhaps just because we are looking at a heavily weathered face.

We pull in to a pier that's on a larger scale size, as if for very big humans, with almost (in our terms) Nordic-like inscriptions. There's a stone building of sorts that looks partly carved out of the cliff itself and built around, forming a kind of "fin" shape, a sort of headland. The outcrop stretches up high where, above, are crumbled remains of what might be a watch tower. Perhaps there are stairs.

We disembark, are wished luck (and wish it back in turn) and head towards the building for a start. Doorways generally seem 10ft high, with 12-13 feet high floors. This seems Kindle scale! At the end of the pier though are bigger gate-like doors, 15ft high perhaps, that seem more significant. Orvil flies up to look at the roof and there seems to be some kind of walkway or track leading up - he can see it *outside* because some of the exterior is crumbled away. Treacherous but passable. The whole thing looks rather military.

The big door is also stone and heavy, though we can't see any locks. Inafina perception 14 sees no obvious traps, at least in terms of obvious contraptions or triggers but the whole place looks fully abandoned. The stone doors look so old that they may be jammed. We check windows - it's just window slits without glass but there's an area which is crumbled and we can climb in. They're 8-9ft above the ground, but Kindle can help and Inafina can get in via her boots and lower a rope for Bel - but he finds it easier to just *jump*.

Inside, it's very dark. Bel gives us all Darkvision. It lasts an hour, so should be more than enough. Orvil indicates where he saw the broken bit of walkway and Oswen tries to figure out the way. Survival 4,8+5->only 13, so she keeps hitting dead ends from crumbled areas. It takes a while before we almost accidentally find our way in, after a partly collapsed wall. There seems to be a big assembly hall, with statues; their size and style makes them look like half-giant-like. Stout and large, almost like dwarves but not in the way that duergar enlarge themselves. The overall build is different, it's more just the style of the build. It's all swords and round shields too. At the back of the hall there are broken display cases, perhaps looted. The stairs are accessed there so we begin - Oswen says she'll go first, as she's the smallest. Kindle last. If Oswen breaks something then Inafina can wind walk or jump. It's hard going though as the steps are huge - 1.5-2ft each, so she has to haul herself up each. ATHL 6. She has to keep having rest breaks!

Kindle haltingly asks if he can help, reading the between the lines - carry. Oswen looks grumpy and says, "right, fine, yes, OK, I don't really have magic for this!" So Oswen piggy-backs. Inafina now leads, able to wind-walk out if anything collapses.

We reach a section where Inafina gets a sense that things are dangerous. Something lives up ahead and it might not be friendly. The stairs spiral between rock tunnels and outside again into what should be, but sometimes isn't, part of the building. Whatever is up ahead must know about us as we've not been too quiet. Orvil has a quick look but is immediately attacked! It's some kind of a huge bat thing. Its first attack hits and Orvil is *immediately dispelled*.

Oswen is horrified. That's never happened before.

In the fraction of a second she had, she saw a kind of nest of these creatures. They look pretty aggressive and scary yet in many ways they have much more right to be here than we do. She warns the group, "be ready to fight" - almost hoping they won't fly down to the group - but Inafina hears them. Soon enough, there are three. She calls out, "No choice, it seems!"

The largest is coming right at her. She uses her staff and hits twice (25 damage total) and then tries her Burning Hands too. Maybe fire will scare them off. It's a big cone of fire, 3d6->only 8 potential damage though, and the one in front seems to panic a bit and shrieks, trying to fly around her almost. Of course this takes it into the rest of the party! Oswen is up high - so it's heading straight for her. It *just* scrapes a hit, 11 damage. STR save 17-1, 16, she manages to hang onto Kindle. Bel tries an attack of opportunity as it goes overhead on the way to Oswen; hits, 5 damage.The bat keeps going! Hopefully it'll find somewhere to lick its wounds.

Up ahead are still two more. Bel casts Cloud of Daggers - 9 damage to each.

Oswen looks around; the bat that flew back looks like it's trying to turn around. She must be food. She drops down off Kindle and throws out Scorching Ray. All three hit - 21 damage, more than she wanted to hit it with, really; it's very badly injured. Another shriek this time, a different kind of call, the other two up front apparently responding - and crashes into one of the window slits to force itself outwards. Up ahead - the same thing; they try whatever they can to squeeze out sideways.

"Well, let's go before they change their minds!" shouts Oswen. Bel throws the daggers up high to the ceiling and we carry on under. It amounts to difficult terrain at the nest; pretty gross actually, mucus, gunk, bits of decaying wood and bones and half-eaten - things. At one point Oswen pushes past a torn, mouldy backpack and a boot. Oh dear. Not just animals then. There's a squeak and we see three young ones inside a carcass. Bel holds them at bay with his rapier as we push past!

At the next section we find the first badly crumbled wall area. The nest then has a good way in and out for the bats, while being also sheltered by being a bit further down and inside.

Inafina tests the stairs here. They're loose. Just resting on each other, but easily able to slide away on the broken side of the wall. Unclear how much weight it would take. Kindle is likely to be too heavy. There's no flat space for the portable hole. Inafina's on the other side and throws back a rope. Oswen next. She opts for a slowly and carefully approach. ATHL ADV for rope - only (2,3)+1 -> 4! She has to pull herself up on the ledges, and almost inevitably, as she pushes upwards, a block below her falls away and that starts a few more bricks away too. At least some bricks are anchored into the wall, but that stair is only 1ft wide.

Bel is unimpressed - he just has to jump it. And boy, does he! A full 30ft, with an elegant landing; Inafia barely gets out of the way.

Kindle stands below, looking uncertain! He tries to keep his weight off and use the rope as much as he can (the other three on the other end of the rope). ATHL total 16 is enough, but we've caused more damage and if we have to come back down this way again it'll be really tough. Outside we can see the bats circling and we don't hang around. Kindle picks up Oswen and we carry on.

It's easier to navigate other such places having done it once. Oswen knows to be much more careful on the push-off and Kindle gets good at using the rope to help minimise his weight. Eventually though the stairs end, after a slow, difficult climb, terminating in rubble due to the ruined watch tower. There's a window slit on the right so we look outside. We might be only some 10ft away from the top of the plateau vertically, but there's no walkway and the route ahead is blocked. If we could clear the rubble we might be able to make more progress.

Inafina uses her boots to squeeze outside and look from the outside down, to see how much rubble lies on top. It is unfortunately a lot; it looks like a two storey guard tower once stood and most of it is now just piled up. The side facing the lake has fallen.

In the end we can't come up with anything more efficient than:

* Kindle uses L4 Stone Shape to convert the window slit into a wide opening with a bit of a ledge
* Bel can jump from there to the top, alongside Inafina
* Kindle keeps Oswen on his back and Bel casts Levitate so the two of them are floated up

It's still not exactly a safe place and we retreat hastily to stronger ground!

Ahead, is now a dusty, high, desert plateau. There are sparse, scrubby trees dotted around and strange stone platforms/blocks scattered - harder stone that has survived weathering better than the ground around. There seems to be a change of terrain far away towards the rim, but it's hard to make out in haze. Specifically clockwise rimward we can easily see it giving way to snow-capped mountains and forests, though.

We spend a while thinking of what to do next. It's not late, but it's early evening. We wonder where the Ma'at river tributaries might be relative to us. He can't see from here, but suggests climbing up onto a rock formation - or Inafina might even climb the air to the top of the crumbled tower behind us! She agrees but tells everyone to stand clear as when she puts her weight on the top it might all collapse. She gets up and finds something to balance on up there, on what looks like the least dangerous part of remaining wall. It gives her a 20ft advantage.

The usual cues for a river don't seem to work - the Outlands has no sun, so nothing directional to glint off a distant waterway. But a long way away, she *thinks* she can see something darker and wider that is probably a more downstream part. A meandering strip of vegetation.

Hmm; that didn't really work and instead we start to walk in, but keep choosing mesa formations to climb and keep trying to get a view. We walk for a good hour before reaching one the bigger mesas, and Bel and Inafina climb - it's tough to get up but they manage it. Inafina perception 15. She can see a gorge, well, perhaps a few gorges. Those might be relevant.

Well, let's at least get a proper look at one. We take a bearing to the closest, and after another hour or so of walking we get to a steep-sided gorge with a narrow, but with fast flowing water below. It's almost more of a mountain stream than a river. The surface is at least 10ft down. We can see strata in the sandstone, with two distinct steps in the cut. We aren't sure whether to go upstream or downstream... HIS check from Oswen (12) doesn't help.

Given our lack of insights here, we elect to instead camp a little early. We'll move a distance from the river and Kindle can set up his Hut. While he does that, Oswen brings back Orvil. Bel and Inafina work together to help Inafina with her Lute skills. Soon, camp is all set and a rather aggravated Orvil is back! Oswen is apologetic but Orvil says he flew in without being asked and may need to be more careful in future.

Over dinner we discuss options; there aren't many and Oswen decides that, if Orvil can't see anything in the morning, we will head downstream. There are lots of things we could second-guess but for *this* tributary, at least, even Oswen at 3ft tall would struggle to call it a river, as the Giants consistently did (at 20ft-or-so tall each). We should find something bigger.



## Campaign day 24

Oswen's up early, eager to get moving after yesterday's slight false-start (but at least we got up here). After a quick cup of tea, the group eagerly watches Orvil fly up and away.

Orvil, lucky perception roll 18+2 -> 20. The stream joins a few others, turns into a very deep gorge, but this doubles back on itself twice, in two very wide "U"s, so if we just blindly followed it you'd travel a long way but not get very far! The river gets relatively quite close to us on one of its loopbacks, with a higher saddle between us and it that stopped us being able to see it earlier. We could get there in maybe a half a day. This section is much more interesting too - Orvil can just about make out two great stone arches that span its width! It's still in a gorge, but not quite as deep as the earlier parts too. So that might make it more accessible. That sounds like as good a goal as any to get started. From there, if we've not found anything of direct interest, we can search again.

The land is not barren. We see occasional creatures - especially nervous but curious desert mice - and plants, but no other travellers except, far distant in the haze and shimmer, what we think at one point is a caravan of travellers. Just before what we think ought to be lunch time we are well over this "saddle", which in many ways to Oswen felt like a sand dune due to shape but was apparently made of solid rock. At this point we easily see these strange stone arches that Orvil had tried to describe - these **levitate**! Huge stone blocks, very similar in colour to the Giants' tower, hang motionless in the air with gaps between each. There are two such arches, about a mile apart from each other. The river has terraces leading down from our side, and from here, we can see what seems to be... A huge hole in the ground, maybe 300ft across, in between the arches and set into the upper terraces of the river. Surely, that's our mine.

We press on, now heading directly towards that sunken area, between the arches. The closer we get, the more impressive they seem. They rise 50ft up or so. Oswen can only make vague guesses about whatever magic holds them aloft. The mine complex is more obvious now; a higher terrace excavated by using a lower terrace for initial access, and it goes down in layers itself inside. Clearly this is abandoned; there are no signs of recent access and no "new" or workable using equipment. Perhaps the Giants saw the levitating blocks and decided they wanted those. But if so, who put them here and what do they mark?

Cautiously, we approach. Oswen figures we investigate the arches first, since they're the most striking thing and might give us some inkling about this area - who set this up, perhaps, or even see if they're some kind of warning. Up close, we see the blocks are decorated, intricate but large scale, characters and glyphs carved in binds or carved, inset circles.

Oswen tries Comprehend Languages, which takes 10 minutes. She tries one on the ground first. Some of the markings are arcane sigils, part of the magic that keeps the stones aloft; some relate to attract and some to repel. It's simple but powerful. The rest is some kind of saga. She only has the first part on this block; whoever put these up was putting up a monument of some kind. The saga starts by telling of the First World. This stone is simple. Kindle helps lift her up to the second block. This is complex. It talks about misunderstanding, jealousy etc. - the "birth of individuality" - tore apart the First World. This resulted in all the Material Planes. The "elder races" retreated from the Material Planes. They settled in the Outlands. The greatest of them are the "lesser" Gods (this word 'God' is not used, it's more just the best the translation can do).

Bel offers to Levitate Oswen to the third stone. She hopes it's worth it and agrees. Each of the Children of these early Gods divided up the Outlands. Fiefdoms established. Individuality increased; they consumed parts of the Outlands; it was once infinite but is now broken into many Planes by their consumption, leaving just the remnant upon which we stand (or in Oswen's present case, above which she levitates).

There is talk of going to the edges; how the Allfather created his domain, how the first Dreamer created its own realm - **Gzemnid's Realm**. That's something that Oswen recognises from when the Giants were talking about some sort of below-surface nexus. She muses on "Dreamer" a moment; ARC 25; *Beholders* - every one is created as the result of a nightmare or dream of another Beholder. So who created the first one? Perhaps the first Beholder is this first Dreamer. 

As long as Bel can keep her levitated on, pulling herself along from stone to stone. She is ending up in a rather dangerous place, right up high above the river! This stone talks about schisms and factions developing. Wars happened in the "realms above the ground". But the tone then is, 'more importantly' things happened below the ground / the Realms of Night / never-day / a similar word. Many different forces tried to seize areas connected both up and down. Fiefdoms/kingdoms were created by invaders, from planes far away evolved in their own ways each; beings of thought; mind flayers / their lineage is implied. So **they were extraplanar invaders**. They wanted to carve out their own layer - the god of the invaders, not being part of this original pantheon, could not create a new plane here.

Now they lie between the surface and "children of Gzemnid's Realm", implying - close by!

There's time, maybe, for the next one. 2 minutes left. She goes for it. Here is a direct mention of the "Caverns Of Thought". They tried to come up but were repelled by the "kingdoms above"; they wanted to take other worlds. They ended up confined to the Caverns of Thought, held in check by the Beholders, a sort of checkmate. They *were* sealed in. A cautionary tale.

That's all Oswen has time for - she quickly starts to pull herself back along stones, only to see on the *top side* of the stones that the inscription runs in reverse on that side. So now she can get Orvil to help. The short version is that people are warned not to break open the seal, which is essentially marked by the two arches and so - **don't dig between the two arches**.

The mine predated the Giants, but it was the Giants who inadvertently broke through. The mine here might even have been used to get the stone blocks for the arches but that certainly seems risky, if you're not supposed to dig there! Perhaps the seal came later.

All of this might have been a sufficient warning - except Oswen has no idea what language this is in and clearly neither did the Giants.

Well, perhaps the giants didn't break a *magical* seal, just a cavern barrier and that's let these mind creatures "get" to them but not actually escape yet. Maybe we can see something magical at this breach. We start to search the mines. Oswen investigates things (investigation 31) while Inafina listens and looks for caves or other signs of a tunnel (perception 21). Working together, Oswen sees areas more recently disturbed - even a couple of blocks that look ready to go, which they must've abandoned when the encounter happened. And off down a carved-out area, there's a tunnel carved to a side.

There are, despite the passage of time, signs of some kind of physical confrontation; rain hasn't fallen that far in and it looks like dried blood on a wall. The giant must've retreated here to try and get away and rested here. The thing it encountered was by *its* standards large. Now we have the various entrances and tunnels available, Oswen tries Detect Magic but - nothing on the outer edges. Obviously, the levitating blocks shine brightly as one would expect. For a giant, this big tunnel would've felt a tight squeeze perhaps and maybe the giant thought the huge creature would not be able to follow (and indeed it has not).

So whatever *this* is, something *outside* - the surrounding area - tried to attack. It wasn't something inside the tunnel; the giant escaped by going inside. There's a difference between what we see here and what was recounted which we cannot yet reconcile, but we walk on into that tunnel anyway, with Oswen wondering if *any* magic will show at all.

The tunnel leads to an older, natural-looking cavern. It looks like someone rested here, tending to wounds. It's dark. Oswen doesn't want to risk light so Kindle helps with his Darkvision for those of us that need it. The cavern, now she can see it better, has sorts of natural rock arches that lead away in two different directions, but these arches are carved on the facing walls with the same kind of language she'd seen earlier. They aren't magical or warded, even though they look arcane; it's just how that language appears.

Inafina's perception tells her that it was a left-hand, downward passage that was used. There are signs of where things scuffed on the floor; she even then finds a small scrap of cloth. Very slowly and quietly as we can, we head into that branch. It pitches down quite sharply and we descend quickly, at maybe a 30 degree angle. It also begins to turn and more or less doubles back. It eventually ends at a sort of room, with blocks stacked up along the sides; they almost look haphazardly placed but Detect Magic is still up (just) and now it shows something odd. A disturbance, just a strange set of glows and, more a sensation... *Old* divination magic. Arcana 27. The Inafina can see that the Giant passed the blocks; one is slightly shifted; and that broke a series of arcane sigils broken on the right, but not on the left.

Oswen asks Kindle if he might be able to just *ease* that stone back without disturbing the others. With Bel's dexterity helping, Kindle is able to do it. The stone clicks exactly back into place. And - Oswen's spell fails, immediately. It's unexpected. On a hunch, she tries a dim Minor Illusion of a dim glowing orb. Nothing. She whispers, "It's an anti-magic field. None of our spells will work here. I'll try back a way in the tunnel."

She doesn't have to go far! As soon as she leaves the room, she detects a *very* powerful Abjuration effect; the spell "bounces" off this as if a surface of a sphere. Her spell *was* still running, but suppressed. She can't see any magic in items on the party either. She whispers to ask the party members to come out - it lasts just long enough to see their items start to glow again, and she explains what she's seen, but doesn't know what it exactly means.

We don't know. "Why would anyone want a room like that?" asks Bel. "And why would this be so fragile, if it were the seal?" - all good points.

As another test, Oswen goes through the room and past the "repaired" sigil set at the other doorway, to the passage beyond. Now her minor magic is working again. Whatever this place is, the effect - strong as it is - remains confined to just that one room.

We really don't want to encounter any of these "brain" things. But we don't know what's going on and we must press on. Cautiously! Oswen brings up Detect Magic for safety - and *immediately* senses a _strong_ divination effect ahead. It's a kind of sensor; a scrying eye; it floats around in the hallway up ahead. It's already seen us; she sees it actually rotate and react. She warns Bel of the rough area; he reacts with Dispel Magic; this works, but Oswen thinks someone or something is already alerted. They just didn't get to see much of us.

"Those eye things couldn't leave because of that room. But probably, one *was* in there for a while, which was the old divination remnants I saw."

But we don't know which "side" of the room the scrying eye was meant to be on! We have a whispered conversation, wondering what to do. But only a few moments later - another one - a scrying eye comes around the corner of the tunnel and moves towards us again. Bel once again dispels *this* one but we can't do that all day. She says, "This is too dangerous but retreat leaves us with nothing; we must press on and see what lies ahead before another eye - *if* another eye - appears".

We hurry a little. We get to a long stretch of corridor. Suddenly she runs into range of an arcane eye, 30ft ahead, on her detection spell. The sense is that these things are being sent out and moving out of the corridor. She hoarse-whispers a warning - but then, WIS save. Nat 20! 25 total. Something tries to push into her mind. It's not magical. She calls out - "It's trying to get us!" - and reacts with Intellect Fortress.

Bel says, "me! It's trying me!" - WIS save ADV., 14,15+0 - then says, "Sorry! I have to!" - and starts humming; it's some kind of counter-charm; rolls 16+0.

Inafina is next; ADV, dirty 20; Kindle next; 27. They're fine.

But now Bel says, "Stop. We need to not do this."

"Do what?"

"We don't know even know what we're doing. Why are we dispelling these eyes? We don't know it's malicious. It's not harming us."

Inafina suspects influence; insight 21. Bel is behaving counter to himself. He's unusually calm. He's never this calm; it's not that he panics, he's just animated and persuasive. This is flat and unemotional.

Bel continues. "But yo are right, Oswen. We need to press on or this will all have been for nought. Would you not agree?"

Oswen sees Inafina's reaction. "But how far should we press on?"

"Oh I'm sure it's only a little while longer! It might be around the corner! Just five minutes. Five minutes! And if we're nowhere, then let's turn around and go back."

Oswen struggles. She doesn't want to fight Bel but he might become violent or perhaps, worse, try to run and give himself to whatever lies ahead (since she's sure now that he is not himself). Instead, she guesses at Protection from Evil & Good maybe helping, so says to Kindle words to the effect of, "Well, if we do, perhaps Kindle we should help Protect Bel from any more Evil?"

Kindle's even smarter. He doesn't think that would work but has a Dispel Evil and Good L5 which he uses - and this works to get rid of a Charm effect, sort of, immediately.

Bel is both confused and alarmed, understandably. "I was having a _conversation_ with something" "What did it say?" "Well, it's not so much what it said, it's what it _showed_ me... I don't know what to do. I know where it is! I know where this thing that's talking to me is; it's down this corridor. I could sense that it's trapped."

Oswen isn't sure. What we've heard and read suggests a malignant thing. But this _might_ not be. Bel had no sense of either. "It felt more like it was... Scared, to be honest."

But why are we even here. Kindle isn't sure. Bel isn't sure. None of us are sure! Kindle as ever wants to head to safety, since he's cast his L5 for the day and isn't sure he can protect us or rescue us again from this - _thing's_ effect. We know what the giants are suffering, but we *might* have already fixed it. We don't know. We could come back here if we had to, one day! We'd ideally need a better route than the bat-infested crumbling tower. We actually go. We start to make our way back up, out of the tunnels and into daylight, but we only get just past the magic suppression room and into the upward-tilting passage when Oswen slows to a stop.

"I'm so sorry. This feels wrong. I might be killing us all with this - I just don't know what will happen. But that thing - Bel, there were so many words you could have used. And I don't know if any of them would've had the same impact as _frightened_. So are we. So was the creature in the Far Realm. I have to try. Even if it's a trick, and I'm fooled  again, I don't want to harden myself to trying; I don't want to give up on the world just because sometimes I trust someone I should not. But that's me. And I don't want to put you all in terrible danger. It has to be your call. If you want to hang back and wait, that makes sense, and you should."

Bel answers pretty quickly. "I don't want that thing doing what it did again. But I feel like I need to know, too. What about you, Inafina?"

Inafina sighs. "I won't lie. It felt good to head away, actually. But I know what you mean. And maybe, just maybe, something positive comes out of helping what everything I know tells me must be a bad creature. A dangerous creature. But I won't separate myself and won't stay behind. I'm curious as well. I'm sorry - Kindle, it seems so unfair to leave you last and leave you having to make a harder choice than we had."

"Oh it's never really a difficult decision for me! Do we go to safety, and have food or dinner? Or go and face something we don't know with possible risk of death? Hmm!" - he laughs - "BUT - I am never going to leave you alone, because that would be worse. So I go where you go, because I want to look after you. I want to protect you *all*. And I can't do that if I'm not where you are. There's no question; I'm going with you."

Oswen nods. "Thank you. All. *Again*. I feel I owe you all many debts! Let's finish this, somehow, then. Whatever the outcome."

And she turns and heads back down the corridors. Just after the suppression room, with Intellect Fortress still up, she looks shouts down the corridor hoping there's an "eye" there and says, "Very well; if you can hear us; we fear your mean to trick us. If you try to invade our thoughts once more, we will depart permanently. But for now, we approach, in hope of meeting some mutually agreeable accord."

**The creature speaks!** In our minds... But this isn't an attack, it's more like a Message spell.

"Agreed. No tricks. Come further down to the chamber with the moved rocks."

We move forward. After a few more turns - and only a few minutes, as "possessed" Bel had indicated - we seem to intersect something, that is maybe an old mine shaft that collapsed on either side. It's as if the mine shaft had intersected this tunnel *after* it. We see a room at the far end and start to walk on - but the creature calls our mind, "No, not there, yet. Back this way."

Must mean the mine shaft - "moved rocks", Oswen guesses. Looking closer, it seems as if one end of the mine shaft has been partially cleared. A room here, perhaps beyond, collapsed. Oswen calls out, "Are you trapped beyond the debris?"

Now a raspy voice, not in our heads, calls out hoarsely but words can't be made out. Then telepathy again. "I am on the other side. I am not trapped. I do not know how to explain. I need to show you. I know you do not trust me to show you things."

Inafina isn't sure if she trusts that; insight is only 16. She says to Oswen that's uncertain. But Oswen says, "I got us into this; I have to try. Keep an eye on me! If I go - weird, don't hesitate to take me down if you have to!" - and calls out to the creature, "I accept being shown visions if that is your wish."

"I need you to come a little closer"

Oswen pushes up into the rubble. And then she sees it - a tiny hole where you can see right through. And then, four Dancing Lights come through. The rearrange and dance around a lot. "Put your hand into this hole! It is small enough" - says the head-voice. Yikes. Well, we've come this far... She takes deep breath and complies.

Her hand can wriggle in. It goes as far as her short arms allow. Then she "hears" - "Don't be afraid. It's OK. Please do not recoil!" - and can't help but shudder a little as some kind of tentacle touches her arm, then wraps around her fingers. It feels very strange and is certainly scary! But she holds still. It repeats, "Do not be afraid" - intentions might be pure but that seems even more scary - only suddenly she is *blasted* by an overwhelming barrage of visions, all apparently sent pretty much at once!

INT save: 13+9 -> 22, she *just* holds it together. Psychic energy is transmitting through her hand, she's sure she *feels* it, and this direct physical connection could have caused her harm but she manages to focus and channel this information into something coherent.

She sees the creature. It *is* a Mind Flayer! But this one - what?! It was *shunned* and chased out of its Colony. This is on the other side of the room, but a long way down in the Caverns Of Thought. The creature is in a corner it found, a long way away. As far as it could get. It found a place it could survive, but it's certainly not fed in a long, long time. It can only feed on brains (!) and thoughts of living things... So it created an Abomination, to collect brains for it. Bring it creatures.

That's a horrifying thought, but this is just how these things survive.

The Mind Flayer was severed from the Elder Brain because - and this is a revelation; it learned wizardly ways (don't ask how, it's easy to guess, sigh) and ended up being 'infected', in a way; this is really hard to deal with. Part of that wizard lived on, in some horrible way, but it meant the Mind Flayer developed skills and a personality which are entirely forbidden.

The big problem though - the "pet" escaped. That was created on the other side of the barrier. It goes to the surface world to hunt, essentially and bring things back. But there was some kind of turmoil, and the entrance way collapsed. The rock fall Oswen faces is quite new. At first it was OK, but then the "pet" started eating brains itself, then got independence and is now just a wild creature, eating all it wants and delivering nothing.

The Mind Flayer thinks it has been terrorising things and attacked a giant a while ago. The giant came right down here and he made contact with that Giant.

"I am going to die; there is only a part of me that can live on as a tadpole" (!) "so I controlled this giant and I fed it my tadpole". This is "spoken" to her. "What does that mean? Do you control the giant?" "No, but the tadpole is a psychic being. It emanates psychic energy around it, which might be disturbing to people. But ultimately it will find a way to meld with its host and turn the giant into another Mind Flayer with my memories."

This Mind Flayer is afraid of what his "pet" is doing - it must be very powerful by now and surely must be stopped. It would not yet have a full personality with full thoughts. It's "half autonomous", mostly instinct. He fears it will seek out the giant with the tadpole and consume the giant before the tadpole matures. He dies and his lineage dies.

"Can you feed me some brains, to keep me alive? Or guard my tadpole so part of me lives? Or maybe at least... Dispatch the eater of knowledge?"

She takes a moment to let it sink in then turns to the party and says, "Ah, I just need a minute..."

She realises that the arcane eye was free to roam with the stone dislodged in that other room. This is how the Mind Flayer knew of the giants and where they went. And that's how he drew the giant deeper and managed to "feed" it the tadpole.

She says out loud, "Well, we can certainly try to dispatch the out-of-control eater."

"Thank you".

"Can I feed you without my own death?"

"Of course. You can feed me animals! But the less intelligent, the more I must eat, of course."

"If you got enough food to live would you still want the tadpole?"

"I don't control the tadpole anymore. It is beyond my control. It is independent of me. I just worry for its survival."

"If we remove this wall of rock, are you strong enough to make new - 'pet' - and have it fetch food, like before the rock fall happened?"

The response indicates that if the *whole* blockage could be removed then this Mind Flayer would roam free, and would feed on anyone it can. The giant apparently tried, though, and it was just too much even for them.

It takes a while then she decides. "Kindle, can you perhaps mould this fallen stone so that it creates a pipe, of sorts, big enough for your arm or a bit bigger, so although it might go further than 5ft, it's only at most 1ft across if that? No. 5ft max. OK, we at least give that much a try. In fact it's shorter than that, as the Illithid was able to reach Oswen's hand - just - so Oswen says, "That's as much as we have the power to do, but it gives you a quite strong opening to reach the outside if that helps at all. If this is not enough and you do pass, as you fear, then I am sorry; but as you say, your tadpole is out there. And we will try to tackle the Eater. Is there anything you can do to help us find it?"

"Yes. It will find *you*. It is drawn to thoughts. If it is nearby, it will come to you."

"Ah. So it's probably already on its way. Thank you for keeping to our agreement and not attempting to involuntarily invade our minds again. We shall depart, and will not be back here, but I hope we do find and dispatch the Eater; and in the mean time, perhaps you will find a way to make another."

It senses it wants to say more, but won't push its luck! That'll do. Pragmatic choices for self-preservation... If not weakened, it would've attacked outright. We need to place warnings around this domain.

We get past the suppression barrier before Oswen explains. And she explains that she did the bare minimum, so that creature is subject to nature. But the giant was captured and fooled; that is not something she considers natural or "good" or even neutral for an intelligent being, capable of acting beyond its instincts. And the fact that this Illithid did hold back because it was weaker shows it has the ability to assess and moderate its behaviour, even if only for self-preservation. The tadpole *must* die.

This is one of those rare moments where the group doesn't necessarily agree with what has been done. But on the flip side, nobody really can give a strong answer to other courses of action. Different compromises, but compromises all the same.

Most people would probably say we should've killed it.

Now we have a literally much bigger problem. What can this aberration do, where is it, how do we see it coming... What does it even look like? Well Oswen can answer that as she only knows of it from the visions. It's a mass of muscle and sinew and no skin. Pretty nasty. Doubtless got a lot of tricks under its sleeve. Oswen offers a suggestion that we certainly try our best to keep out of its reach and hit with ranged attacks only, no melee, because that sounds like just the sort of thing that'd get you grabbed and pulled in.

We make haste to the surface. It's not been all that long; still very much daylight - late afternoon / early evening maybe.

"How are we going to lure it out?" asks Kindle.

"Lets get down there, on the lower terrace where we've a lot of room and 360 degree visibility. Then we're going to start challenging each other. Puzzles. Questions of fact or mathematics. We will almost exhaust ourselves on matters that make us *think*. We'll just keep doing that... It'll probably come at us at night, when we dream, but we'll have to just rely on Watch for that if so!"

We start. It's arduous!

Requested D8->6. We've been at it for a couple of hours. Bel is really over it. We all are! "We have to keep going somehow" says Oswen "though I'm more or less out of things to talk ab - "

...but Inafina interrupts. "What's that?" - some kind of raft; well, more of a reed boat. Actually on closer look, quite elegant. It's punting with the current. It has only one occupant - a beautiful-looking young elf, perhaps? Whoever they are, they see us out in the open and waves. It's within range of Message so Oswen sends, "Nice to meet you. We are here to attract and battle a dangerous creature. Please keep your distance for safety." There is a reply; "Oh! Would you like help? I'm happy to help - I am capable. Let me help!"

We do all see the same thing. Well, this is strange. Oswen Messages again, "We welcome help but I do warn you this is an exceptionally aberration and death is a real possibility!" "In that case you will NEED help!" - the creature starts quickly punting and steering to shore.

Oswen relays the convo to her group as the elf makes its way to shore and asks Inafina what she thinks; of course Inafina can't offer anything until there's been a conversation she can hear but she's on alert.

The reed boat reaches the shore. Inafina at this distance, insight only 10; Oswen perception just 15. Not great. Bel "puts on his heirs" and walks to greet. Oswen notices as the disembarkation happens that the movement is quite slow and halting. She calls out to Bel, "Oh Bel dear, just one moment" - to get him to stop approaching and give him an excuse to just come back our way. "Oh, OK..."

The elf gets slowly and clumsily out of the boat. ("Kind of slow and clumsy movements for a young elf, wouldn't you say?" whispers Oswen to Inafina). The Elf picks up a spear from the boat and starts to head our way, walking with the spear. Oswen casts Detect Magic - yes, as she feared. An illusion spell. As the elf gets close and starts to say, "So what are we fighting, dearie?" - itself an old person thing to say (!) Oswen calls out, "Stop right there and drop that illusion."

The reaction is indignant. "How rude! Well. Very well. Well this is how I see myself! But fine!"

The illusion drops slowly at first, then faster. We see a dark, moudly-brown skinned old crone holding a cane. She's covered in wet rags and seaweed. She has long limp wet hair clinging to her face. There are even barnacles growing on her! Detect Magic reveals more now that the illusion has dropped, except for a necklace and rings that appear to be magical; and a bag she carries has something magical inside too.

This is certainly a hag, but she does not try to attack.

Oswen explains that we were going to fight a creature that can be deceptive. That was why we didn't like the illusion. A discussion ensues but this *is* a hag and there's definitely more to this than meets the eye. Oswen, HIS 18; different types of hags revel in different kinds of suffering, she thinks; some - night hags - like to give nightmares. Others love to create instances of bad luck. And so-on. The question is - does this hag revel in the misery of the creature being defeated, and thus want to join in, or does she revel in something darker? Perhaps it's just about *someone* losing. Revelling in misery or the pain. "Well, I think I understand - there's something about battle you enjoy - what is it particularly?" "So many questions! What do you enjoy about it? Maybe we have something in common. It's hard to articulate."

She claims she'll step in and help us *if* we're struggling when Oswen asks if she'd help us and not the creature. "And what if the creature was struggling?" "Well, then it only seems fair to give it a bit of a fighting chance! It's four against one, no?"

Ah, that creates a problem; for then we would need to fight the hag too, but have no quarrel with her right now. How about she just watches and helps neither side, so equally fair? She offers that she might grant us a boon but would offer something in return.

Inafina's been trying to help but Oswen still can't get much insight (13+10)+1->14.

Kindle notices Oswen and Inafina aren't comfortable. Kindle rises up and simply says, "I think you should leave!" "What? That's very rude of you, bugbear!" "You are a complication! That is more than we want to deal with right now. We don't want to fight you; I suspect you don't want to fight us. And we *definitely* don't want to fight you *and* this creature at the same time. We must, though, and will fight you, *if* you refuse to leave!"

She harumfs. "Fine. No gift, no boon! Not even going to wish you luck!" She hobbles back to the boat. "This will not be the last time we see each other, I am sure! Maybe next time you will accept my help!" - and she pushes out. She even waves goodbye!

"Didn't get a name" says Oswen.

"Huh. Thought she wouldn't want to fight us" says Kindle. "She just wants to revel in the glee of other's suffering."

Weird. That's that. Kindle insists on setting up the hut as it'll be dark soon. It's as Oswen feared; this thing is going to come at us at night. Sigh. Well, it makes sense; it's a hunter, after all. It could even be watching us right now and we wouldn't know.

After dinner, as we start to relax for a moment and talk about going on Watch, usual order - Oswen, Inafina, Kindle, Bel - and Oswen is getting ready, but we're all still inside the hut, then Bel says he'll get rid of some dirty water from dinner. **He wanders out of the hut towards the river, but as he starts to come back, Inafina suddenly sees, rushing out of the water like a crocodile from behind him, the bizarre mass of flesh that matches Oswen's rather graphic description.**

Initiative! (Bel at disadv., Inafina adv and nat 20, for 29 total)

(Due to bad shoulder, can't type complete details). Inafina with step-of-wind is *just* able to get within 30ft and hits twice with radiant bolt (21 damage). The strange creature rears up and she seems to have its attention, but it has no eyes. Bel is very startled, turns and screams! Oswen runs out, gets as far as she can - 30ft means max 90ft range - as she sees this terrible thing and throws a L3 Chromatic Orb, Acid, 5d8 -> solid 29 damage. It's screaming _in her mind_, bizarrely. "If anyone has any psychic attack ability, use it!" she yells.

But now the creature acts. Things seem to bubble within it, but then there's a bright flash of bizarre, bewildering light, all centred around Bel and Infina (Oswen notes that she never saw anything being cast, somehow, so she wouldn't have been able to counter-spell even if she was close enough). WIS saves. Inafina uses Inspiration to reach 17. Success. Bel, 13, fails, reacts Countercharm, nat 20! The creature maybe does or does not know that happened - it is hard to tell! - but in any case, moves forwards and slams down onto Bel. He dodges out of the way in the last moment.

Bel heard Oswen. Psychic Lance! 27 damage potential... But it has magic resistance and saves. It's not incapacitated; and even stranger, it doesn't flinch at all at the lance. Bel shouts back, "Psychic damage doesn't work!" - and he runs for it. Via Mantle Of Inspiration he chooses himself and Inafina as they're the only ones in range, granting 16 temp HP and enabling himself to react to both run and effectively disengage. He ends up 35 react-dash plus 35 untaken movement - 70ft - he ends up next to Oswen! Inafina is able to react and move closer, to engage the creature directly.

Kindle ends up alongside Oswen and Bel and fires his heavy crossbow at the Large creature looming over Inafina, calling upon Yondalla intending to use Divine Strike. Nat 1! Oh no. He reloads.

Inafina lays into it with the staff. Two hits, both with charges, decent damage tho it resists Stunning Strike - and suddenly it teleports 30ft sideways! Inafina immediately dashes up, putting herself in the narrow space between the river and creature - Flurry Of Blows - two solid hits sinking into the bizarre brain-like flesh and it goes down - and WIS save... 15... Fail. She's stunned, 4 psychic damage, and falls back into the shallows at the river's edge - memories flood into her mind. She senses no less than 8 separate consciousnesses devoured by this thing.

The others run up, but Bel is fastest. Inafina's out cold. He tries Healing Word. It heals her fully but she stays down - Bel cradles her shouting dramatically, "noooo, she's dead!" - and it's that shaking motion that wakes her up! He hugs her tight and he hugs her back.

Prestidigitation sorts out the mess that's over Inafina's clothes as the monster essentially disintegrated into a disgusting mess of flesh.

Inafina (HIS 5-1->4) can't tell much about the visions that flooded her mind. A traveller and companion; a mage for hire; a fisherman; that's about all.

It's dark now. Remembering the illithid, we work together to carve a brief warning message in Common on the tunnel entrance. Kindle assembles a new hut and we bed down. We do take watch, but the night passes uneventfully and in the morning, Inafina senses that, through good fortune, her staff has fully recharged.



## Campaign day 25

Over breakfast, we discuss the battle, then the day ahead. The "fallen bell" monastery. But also - the "infected" giant. Oswen HIS 22, knows the Githzurai (meditative) and Githyanki (aggressive) hate the Illithids, so maybe they have information on what to do; Trade Gate would be the best guess for a place to find some, but hard to strike up a conversation! Even so, we should try.

First, the monastery.

We work towards higher ground to see if we can get a bearing on where the "fallen bell" monastery might be. Back up on the plateau. Looks like we'd need to cross the river, then head Clockwise-Rimward along it for a while before going across ground to the monastery itself.

We make a beeline directly towards the monastery, knowing the river crossing on that bearing will be quite distant. Inafina leads - she's OK about the fight and going down, but is certainly more alert, listening intently. She tries to follow Oswen's pointed-out path but SUR 11 - it's tricky. Perception 25, meanwhile. It's slow going and we reach the river at twilight. Down here Inafina mentions that she thinks we're not alone; not perhaps followed, but "noticed".

Oswen wonders if we should encourage them to show themselves, but Bel suggests crossing the river first - we might just lose them. Kindle fast-casts Water Walk and we travel across. Now we're at the base of quite imposing cliffs; Oswen perhaps should've chosen a more Eastward route that might've avoided them, but it was a fairly big extra distance. We figure camping here is not the wisest; so we use a mixture of abilities:

* Since it's getting dark, Kindle can "walk up the shadows" and carries Oswen - but does need to use the ability twice as he's somewhat encumbered and it's a pretty tall cliff
* Bel uses Fly on himself
* Inafina has her boots

If anyone *is* watching us, that must've been quite a strange show!

We decide to set up the camp with the cliff at our backs.

* Oswen 14 - doesn't notice much, a bit distracted by reading
* Inafina 20 - hears rustling, but it's a distance away and never comes closer
* Kindle 27 - hears similar noises, but is sure that's wild animals; dim light on the horizon in the direction of the monastery
* Bel 12 - the group wakes up to find Bel asleep!



## Campaign day 26

Kindle checks outside in the morning and (survival 23) finds nearby footprints - animal tracks - implying small, four-legged creatures. He even finds a possible burrow.

After breakfast, we pack up to head to the monastery. Oswen leads with Orvil helping. That leads to a +22 Survival. It's easy to see the fallen bell from Orvil's perspective, almost 100ft above. We make good time - about 4 hours - where towards the end we climb down into a sort of veil where there's a huge bell lying on its side, on the ground. A bit of it is pushed into the ground but most is above it. The bell itself seems to be inhabited! So the monastery *is* the bell; Oswen had assumed it would be in some building adjacent.

The scale is "off" too. It is far bigger than we thought... A monastery and several buildings inside the bell. Surely not? We get closer - and find that yes, it is a large bell, but not as big as might have been thought; the buildings are also quite small. Smaller than gnomish, bigger than Brigganock - once close enough, Oswen estimates that floors are each about 3ft high in the monastery. The bell itself is huge - who knows what sort of building it could ever have come from? The diameter is some 50 feet.

Curiously there's a pool and some water flowing down into the bell through a crack in a small waterfall. The top of the bell has collected enough soil to even grow some shrubs and even a few small trees!

A bunch of Guardinals pop their heads up - otters, mice, raccoons and more.  Possibly some from here *were* watching us last night, in that case. They're dressed in plain robes of different colours - peach, green, off-white and one has a dark blue robe who leaves the group and approaches. They hold a 3ft long stick.

We are asked our business. The Guardinal who has approached is a capybara. Bristly fur. Refers to the name **Fallen Bell Monastery**, so we're at least right about that part!

Turns out the bell fell a long time ago and the giants have been asking for it.

A deal is offered - do not spread knowledge of the giant tower and they will grant proper ownership of the bell. We don't know if we really hold that authority, but we risk it anyway.

Transpires that these people are pacifists, and try to avoid violence. So do we; a discussion ensues. If Oswen wished to face her guilt about moments of violence where not *all* other avenues had been investigated, she could spend time here; debate and talk, think, learn. "Come to peace; understand your part in the great balance." She likes the idea - once Venca is dealt with - if they would have her, after all the mistakes she *might* make. Inafina would also like to do that.

We are being taken to **Sifu** - the old master.

Up close the monastery looks somewhat makeshift. Even Oswen won't really fit inside, as she's about as tall as a whole floor. We're told it's OK; Sifu is normally on a verandah outside, meditating. Sure enough, we find a red panda sat but upright in a flat, circular sand area off to one side. The Capybara presents our group, mentions that Oswen and Inafina might return to learn more one day, and excuses themselves.

We explain our story. He asks about Inafina's order. She explains as best she can and, to her surprise, he knows of her Order; and even names her plane. *They call her world **Theros** - myths, legends, virtues, principles.* She's never heard it called that before! Now she has a name for her home destination. For a few minutes, they chat about philosophies and religions. WIS-based proficiency roll for Religion, 18, she does OK and much of it is of "blast from past" variety. She'd not heard much of it in a long time. Her order exists because her world has to take gods very seriously, given that they live on the material plane and actively meddle. "The light from within", instead of relying on gods, was her Order's basis. It's the 1960s animation school of meddling Greek gods model - the interference of gods is largely *not* welcome.

Kindle's uncomfortable at that; Bel takes it in his stride; and Oswen is amazed - she'd not considered gods *right there* on the same plane. Just other corporeal beings! What even does it mean to be a god?

A long philosophy discussion ensues. One day we should return. And, in the passing of that, our request is granted; the giants will not be spoken of. We spend a little time in an orchard, by permission, getting fresh fruit. Time passes. It would be easy to get lost here, whiling the days away, forgetting our troubles. But the giant is in an unknown state... We have obligations. We'll be back.

We learn that there's a trail to Trade Gate that would take 2 days, but we can do it quicker if we don't mind stopping in at the keep. We say our goodbyes, find a quiet corner and with Bel's help, it's a sure-fire amulet portal to the Fey Wild. Nat 20!



### Our keep, Fey Wild

Pop - we appear *right in the library*. Head librarian Kamersaal is scared so much that he jumps up a foot and drops a pile of books he was carrying! We apologise and help him pick them up. We know we shouldn't spend *too* long but we're offered tea - well - surely there's time for that...!

Soon enough people - and various creatures - are assembled. We see more and more animals have made homes here, except in the library. Bird nests don't play well with books! It feels like a light afternoon tea, as the time here by chance "feels" the same as the time it was at the Outlands - early afternoon.

By request we tell our story. Our library here has nothing to help with the "tadpole". Bel plays music that's mostly gentle and restful, but now and again picks up to match our stories. It's an unexpectedly Inspiring performance.

Eventually, the same difficult goodbyes... We have to depart. Another use of the amulet, this time to try and get to Trade Gate, aiming for near the tavern. 18+13 -> 31. We arrive in a side-street. That's probably for the best!



### Tradegate, Outlands (Still Campaign Day 26, but we've had many planar discontinuities)

We cautiously peer out into the main area. Everyone is worried that we might be spotted by people who chased us before! We estimate it's around 4pm from the now fairly familiar "not sun" of the Outlands. Quite busy. Bars are starting to pick up.

We decide to try and ask a barman! Music comes from a nearby bigger bar - not the one in which was last caused a scene! - it's called Giant Space Hamster, which the group doesn't recognise. It seems rather strange!

It's lively inside. There are two storeys with a very long bar down the longer side wall, with a stage the other side with a tired-looking duo playing - despite their appearance - quite jaunty music. A big kitchen is open via a low partition towards the back and the central area has a large, circular fireplace, a hearth, with a big metal conical "cap" hanging above for a chimney.

At the bar, a bartender waves us over. Bel leads the drink orders and we strike up a conversation about illithids - but they don't know all that much. We do get into the two "gith-foo" types. The githzerai have a monastery near the gate to Limbo. It's up on mountains surrounding the gate town of Xaos, pretty much all the way across from where we are - about as far across the Outlands as we can go. Legend says that they are honour-bound to assist people in great need if they manage to find this place.

Well, that's a tough call - a long, long way and we don't know how long we or the giant might have. But we should also speak to githyanki, for extra context and possibly other options. The beer is great, so we order another and sit down to wait. A while later, the bartender points to a group and explains their roles. One is a leader of the group, Zarael, with two other githyanki. They all sit around a table but near one side, so they can keep an eye on the room. Zarael has a greatsword; the others are also armed, though not as impressively.

They look intimidating, but this is essentially a matter of diplomacy with other cultures. Bel watches closely. Insight, nat 20! He figures a good way to approach: Go up with a bottle of wine. We pick a good one, and clues up the barman to start with a few glasses but if things go well the rest of us can join and he'll ask for more. We can't hear what Bel says when he goes over there. Initially it looks frosty - scowls, posturing. He puts down the bottle and glasses and bows, says something - there's a tense moment... Persuasion, via inspo., another nat 20! Suddenly one of them laughs, the others join and Bel beckons. We head over.

They're here trying to track down a tyrant, and think they've narrowed down the plane. They're just passing through. It turns out the two we flew with on the Lambent Zenith were crechemates, so there's some common ground. Bel even has got as far as mentioning the Illithid. When it comes to *that* conversation, they describe a "conversion" that takes *only a week*.

Well, it's been longer than that for our friend! But they are a giant - only they are unaware. This is the first the githyanki have heard of such a thing. The size might be the reason for the slow change, but who knows! It's also remarkable that the giant didn't even know. The tadpole insertion amounts to a surgical procedure.

Usually they'd say, kill the infected for their own good - but in this instance the infection is moving very slowly. Perhaps there's a chance; if they got to a citadel/creche in the Astral Sea, perhaps? They aren't sure. It would certainly be quite the quest for this giant to try and reach that domain - what spelljamming vessel could even carry a creature of such size?

Zarael's group are going off-plane, then back here and out to a citadel - they leave in "two cycles". If we can find a way to transport the giant, they'll take them - *if* the giant is prepared to come, given the many dangers!

On the way out, Oswen pays the bartender 5gp on assurance he can pass on a Message, if for some reason we are unable to return, or the giant refuses.

It's 8 hours to the tower and late, almost 5pm. We'd get there a little after midnight; Oswen is keen to push on now, even if we get tired. It seems time is short. We hurry away. We don't have any quick fixes for that. Kindle uses Light and we save a bit of time going over water with Water Walk, bringing things down to around 7 hours.



## Campaign day 27, midnight

At the camp, everyone is asleep. We wake Zorhanna and explain, apologetically. Inafina, meanwhile hears strange mumbles coming from the camp - bad dreams. A long, long conversation. In the end - tell the giants, but offer no solutions immediately; just answer their questions as best you can.

Eventually we, too, head to bed - but within the tadpole's sphere of influence; WIS saves:

* Inafina 12
* Oswen 19
* Bel 13
* Kindle 10

### Daytime

Oswen sleeps and in the morning is thinking, well, maybe it's not so bad - but the rest of the group has a very different opinion, having had terrible dreams!

Inafina sees a note on the ground inside the hut! It's folded; she immediately reads it. "Was called away. Seemed urgent. Will let you know when I know more, good luck today - stay safe" and is signed with a big "Z".

"We may have less time than we thought" says Oswen; we rush through breakfast.

The giants are already up and are starting to disassemble the scaffold. The new project is a permanent outbuilding as a sleeping quarters area. We politely ask if we can have a meeting with all of them. The good news about Wonderhome and the Fallen Bell is given and agreement is reached regarding ownership of the giant bell - but then comes the difficult part. The "tadpole".

The news is delivered as best we can. It is taken well, relatively speaking. They must think on things. We withdraw; we're told we can use the observatory if we wish.

We don't really know where to look for anything we want to look for. So Oswen decides - a bit selfish! - to look for Leonidas' parents farmhouse. Arcana 22, it takes a while, but she finds Toril, then Sembia, then Ordulin's outskirts and finally, the vineyard areas. Now she has to work off pictures and stories from Leonidas, but it's enough that she's confident she finds the right one...

...and it's surprising! There are *garrisons* around. She spots who she thinks are the parents, at work, loading up a cart. They don't seem happy, but seem to be trying to hide it. It "feels" like a kind of military occupation. The cart in due course rolls away, up the road. She follows the cart, which rolls to the next farm. The drivers go in through the gate without pausing and bang on the door. An older couple emerge. A woman carries a much younger child - a grandson? This leaves the old man to carry crates from the barn to the cart. Details are fuzzy, but it looks like harvest. Then there's some kind of altercation, based on posturing. Soldiers start pushing the old man who seems to be gesturing in a defiant way; the old lady puts the baby down on a barrel and tries to break up the dispute. The soldiers push both to the ground! They barge into the barn and start throwing things around, as best as Oswen can see from the angle. Then they emerge with crates, that it seems were hidden. The older couple seem to be pleading for them not to do it - Oswen's guess is that this is their only food.

Follow the cart... To the town centre. A warehouse. Things are being loaded onto much larger wagons. The town centre is a shocking sight - some shops are boarded up, one has broken windows, graffiti... People who are visible on streets seem wary, almost furtive. Some villagers appear prosperous and based on what she sees, they seem to be "in" with the army.

Sembia is a market economy; the state never taxed produce. But now it looks almost - feudal. Who knows if this is Vecna's doing - at least directly. Why would he want produce?! It could be other people, taking advantage of the situation.

She remembers the "flipping tiles" vision. This is a new reality; we'd seen some kind of "perfect day", weather wise, but maybe the changes are deeper and this is whole new form of life. Same people, but somehow on another track. The kingdoms that became Sembia overthrew feudalism thousands of years ago, but it seems either things went backwards quickly, or history is rewritten. Based on what we know, the latter seems more likely. Not that it makes sense in terms of any obvious goal, or rationale. And it's curious - we know the people and the place looks physically correct, yet, somehow, it's a totally different style of life.

Back to the parents. She really can't see anything (perception, *with* inspiration burned - nat 2, nat 3 plus 1). Land looks less productive, though. Somehow less - abundant. Maybe Leonidas remembers things with "rose tinted glasses", but then, everything looks average-to-run-down. People not motivated to take care, or put in effort? HIS 18+5->23. Given that gnomish device we suspect is in use... It's a sort of **clumsy splicing of realities**. If this kind of rule had been going on for many years, it probably even have farms here. But this has been kind of - overlaid on the prior physical reality. In a few years from now, these farms will probably be gone.

**So Vecna has not yet managed to change all of history but *has* imposed a different reality**.

This is why people seem to act as if they know things aren't right but simultaneously believe that's how it has always been. **But that gives hope**. Vi may be able to tap into that feeling. These people aren't broken down and beaten yet. We got there soon enough.

Now Oswen asks Inafina - would she like to see the monastery? It takes a good minute of thinking before she says - "well, it might be the last time I can, I suppose?" - but she struggles to describe it. One monastery is rather like another! HIS, 11-1 -> 10. Oswen at least finds Theros, which surprises her because it doesn't match her mind's eye (in fact it looks to our eyes rather like mythologies of ancient Greece). There are many mountain ranges. Oswen's going to need some luck. INV - and Bel helps with Bardic inspiration, which maxes out! - so 6 + 13 -> 19 + d8 -> 8 -> 27. She manages to piece it together.

A particular shape of mountain; a large snowfield; a glen; beautiful rhododendron trees and - a monastery, high up. It's beautiful! She moves over and shows Inafina how to look. Inafina does - and is overwhelmed by emotion. WIS save, 15. She didn't expect to feel all that! Training was about controlling that kind of thing. She catches herself, surrounded by friends and feeling the warmth of it. She had friends there; they might be in the training grounds. There, she sees a few younger monks. They are unfamiliar - it has been many years! - so she tries the main hall. Somehow, she can see inside, at an angle but good enough. There! Her old master mediates, alone. She's started narrating what she sees, but it ever-more embellished with stories and nostalgia. "I wonder what she'd think if she saw me now? Whether she would approve, or our old differences would still dominate..."

Inafina INS 24. She notices her old master, movements very familiar, stiffening up a bit. An ear lifts up, slowly. Her hand position changes slightly and makes some kind of signal - Inafina recognises that immediately - it's a simple silent language, of sorts. It says, roughly speaking, **"So you return, child, after all this time..."** Inafina has no idea how to respond, or even if it's just coincidence. All she can do is watch. The old master settles back down, tilts her head back a bit, eyes still closed; the ears relax. The hands come back together to signal more; **"...things still stand, forgiveness will be given if it is sought/asked"** and Inafina feels surge of annoyance, perhaps resentment, but she recognises much of that is her own stubbornness. She says out loud, "If I can, one day I will return" - but doesn't expect it to be heard.

She stops watching and thanks Oswen unusually politely and says, "I'll get some air" and pads away. We don't push it. Oswen moves the view a bit so that Bel and Kindle can at least see the monastery and grounds. And she asks them the same - do they want to see anything?

Kindle smiles. "I have my family here", he says.

Bel says, "Well, I was just there not long ago!" - he's fine.

For want of much else to do, Oswen decides to use the Sending Stone - "Searches ongoing. Not much new. Insights into world under Vecna - a splicing of realities, not a replacement of history."

Vi replies: "Interesting. In line with my own observations. Good to have it confirmed. Will work on this premise. Slow going!"

Alustriel: "Any luck on assigned missions?" - and updates on hers - "For mine, found her, but encountering difficulties with time portals! Working on it!"

No other answers, which makes us nervous but we have to hope the other three are OK.



### Afternoon

We withdraw and it's something like four more hours before the giants approach us. They have reached a decision. The young, "infected" giant will embark on a personal quest. He will seek to have the tadpole removed, thinking he knows the dangers. Giant history history includes quests of a "might not return" nature aplenty! The elder has given their blessing. This would be his "coming of age", or otherwise. He will be equipped, ask for their God's blessing and spend the rest of the day making preparations. There is even to be a parting feast.

He intends to try the Astral Sea. We say we'll go ahead - even though it'll take him much less time to reach it, we can try to get some groundwork done on finding a way for him to reach the Sea. We can leave the giants to the privacy of their preparations, and get our own research *finally* started in earnest on the Hand and Eye.

The usual farewells, albeit with more finality and we immediately head off for Trade Gate. We don't make any faster progress than last time, really, but get there just before midnight.



### 11pm (ish)

We're back! We need information on how to transport a giant... Perhaps we'll see a good shop that might give us a lead. The main market area is relatively quiet. Food and drink places mostly. Less street food here, more restaurants or bars. Most things that are interesting would only be so when open.

So, we figure we need a loud conversation about "how on earth do we transport a giant", hoping to be overheard - at least until we can come back here, tomorrow - so that means the sky dock area and a busy tavern. We haven't been here at night before and it has a different feel. Curiously, the streets are *quieter*, mostly seeming to be a thoroughfare. Sometimes in an alley we see furtive-looking conversations being held.

There's Pig & Whistle - unwise, we think! - and Giant Space Hamster, which could be OK but the liveliest is a big tap room. Rowdy, though. Hard to be heard. Then a rather more high-end looking place, up some stairs on a second and third floor, easier to spot now with lights and music - **The Captain's Quarters**. Bingo! Oswen says, "That's the one!"

Bel gets to be Captain. He can use his hat of disguise. Perfect - if a little... Elaborate...

Well, the plan is to have a loud conversation about "our first big commission" but how can we do it, transport a giant? Bel's over-the-top outfit gives all the impression of being a novice crew, over-dressed to impress. It's - perhaps accidentally - a perfect way to make ourselves the target of perhaps derision or jokes, but in so doing, be seen as no threat, and have people watching and listening.

Up the stairs, we're greeted by a - creature - at the door, that seems made of long leaves, with a big upside-down fish bowl on its head (!) and inside, indeed, is a fish, swimming about. It seems the fish controls this strange construct and speaks telepathically. We're asked if we want a private room etc.; no, "a lively room with the company of others!"

A pixie flies out, apparently summoned. "Right this way, please! Have you had a busy day?"

Bel starts his routine about a big contract but no idea how to make it work. Deception nat 20! He's doing a good performance overall. Inafina perception 17. She can hear all sorts of things, but plenty of it is sniggering and she catches a few people making quite sarcastic comments to each other. She whispers to Bel - "Perfect! Keep it up!" On reaching the table, Bel exclaims, over the top, "Thank you, very much!" and sits with a dramatic flourish of his cape.

Tiny menus are delivered, but with magnifying glasses!

As Bel is reading one, two burly people but with clown faces (?!) walk up - "Hello ladies!" they say, apparently in a teasing mood. Inafina picks up on this probably being a well-natured joke, of curious sorts, and says, "I'll have you know I'm a male Harengon!" - but they point at Bel. "No, this one! What brings you lovely ladies of the night into this fine establishment."

Bel claims, "There are no genders where I'm from! Hello ladies, to you also!"

They laugh. "We are ourselves new to this part of planes, having found ourselves here following someone else!"

"An accident of sorts?"

"Well, yes, somewhat... We appear to have lost them. No matter."

There's something a little - off - about them, thinks Inafina but Insight 13 or Perception 13, she can't put her finger on it. She gives Kindle _a look_ but Kindle - perception with inspo 2, 4 + 8 - just shrugs. Oswen sees *that* and looks more closely. Perception 18+1 - they're not breathing. Ah! They're undead! That explains the clown makeup.

Oswen says, "Well, ladies or gentlemen, living or not, we welcome you to this plane and hope you find success here."

"Why are *you* here?"

Bel hams it up. "Oh, calamity! Just as we get our first big contract..." - and so-on.

They can't help much, but surprisingly they do say - "Well, since it's your first gig - if we do cross paths, we won't harass you!" - from which we can guess that perhaps, usually, harass is what they do. Unbeknownst to us, these are Space Clowns.

Later, in person, we wonder - what about Enlarge/Reduce? They could be shrunk to fit on deck, then once in the Astral Sea, towed; we were told by the crew of the Zenith that you just "float"/drift on the astral sea and don't need food or drink. And being a bit distant - on the end of a rope or something - might help avoid *some*  of the nightmares for the crew, but then, they don't even need to sleep out there... She checks her notes; it's not a spell she knows, but she realises it's too brief. Only a minute or so. She *does* have a powerful potion that'd do it. But he'd still be very big, even at half size. Other options? Arcana 28 - in fact, *Fly* could work - he'd be fast - and it only took a few minutes to get from dock to portal on the Zenith. That could be enough. Ten minutes. We'd need a fast ship. Or a robust one. Or just... Anything willing to tow a giant!

The Githyanki's ship - could that be enough?

We've drunk and eaten our fill and really now just need to kill time until the rendezvous tomorrow at Giant Space Hamster. We need a room. We head back to the market area - quieter, feels safer - and look around. Something modest, but big enough ideally to have room for the four of us. Found! **Staying Inn** (!) - Four beds, 1gp a night, easy!



## Campaign day 28

In the morning, we spend much of the day just learning more about the facilities here. We have the Hand & Eye in mind; scout out possible places to ask. To our surprise, we find an outlet for the grand Bank - so if need be, we can portal here and withdraw our money! Bel is very happy.

We pick up various few knick-knacks, since the ones we "paid" Froderick with at the Keep won't last forever.

* Bel spots an ornate furnishing shop, surprisingly large, with rooms that are "themed" to different kinds of looks. He wants to remember it for future use!

* Oswen sees a very well organised and categorised shop of spell components; all manner of ingredients, some very rare. Lots of small drawers and glass jars. It's all well labelled and priced.

* A cul-de-sac contains non-magical books and scrolls, old, that seems to be called - as an area - "**Reader's Nook**" with lots of small shops. Of course, there are magic shops, too. Items and scrolls.

* A workshop area claims to be able to build anything for which you have a design.

* The main market is bewildering when at "full tilt" but it feels like you could buy - well, almost anything. We learn that the traders 'rotate' in and out often too, so it's always changing.

* Kindle and Inafina aren't really "buyers of things"!

**The Hag's Nest** (investigation 20) catches Oswen's eye in particular. "Open 6-7". She has a hunch that this might be a good place to ask about Venca, or at least Igwilv, given all the weird, interesting things in the window. And another, open 2-5, **Mr Know It All's**, apparently a book store but not in Reader's Nook and looks pretty esoteric.

Eventually, we're due to wait for our Githyanki friends in GSH. The bartender recognises us, of course; we "park up at the bar" and wait. After an hour, they show up. We present options; they don't like the idea of towing a giant! Bel goes into full tilt; persuasion 13+12 -> 25. He offers payment. They'd previously turned it down but treat it as hazard pay! And the giant must not attack the Red Dragon that they have with them. He'll fly to a portal they create and then drift with them on the Astral Sea. It won't be very comfortable, but it'll work.

We are to all meet "where the dragons are", not far from where we are, so Oswen uses Message to check on the junior Giant to see where they are. An hour away. We go that meeting point and, when the giant turns up, explain about the dragons. He's fine with it - given the circumstances. He doesn't have a history of wars with dragons and has lift in other planes a lot. We ask if he can carry us, which he does, and we direct him to the dragon staging area meeting point up in nearby big hills / small mountains. Hidden in a small valley out that way (heading counter-clockwise towards Excelsior, ish) we spot three young red dragons - and the githyanki. The dragons react immediately when the giant appears, so Oswen shouts the githyanki, "This big fellow has no quarrel with them, so you'd better make sure *they* have no quarrel with *him*!"

An uneasy truce is sprung up.

Before he puts us down, Oswen - on his shoulder - gives him a kiss on the cheek; well, as best she can reach. "Good luck. I hope it goes well and we see you again." Bel says similar, giving Bardic Inspiration. Kindle and Inafina hug a finger!

Back on the ground, Bel casts his Fly spell - biggest thing he's ever flown! - the dragons snarl and get airborne and the giant, now holding an ornate carved tree trunk as a staff with a shoulder-strap bag, waves and gives chase. The dragons, we see, are deliberately testing him - being evasive - the giant does his best to keep pace. Bel is like an anxious parent. We can clearly follow them up, easily visible, even at a great distance - a strange shimmering portal opens, and they all go through - in an instant - the portal closes.

"I've lost the spell" says Bel. "I guess he's on his own now".

We start to walk back towards Trade Gate. Along the way Oswen turns to Inafina and says, "Do you want to talk about it?" and Inafina replies, "Not much to talk about. But I need to get back to the monastery one day, to speak with the Master in person."

Inafina doesn't mention that the Master seemed aware of the observation until quite late on when she suddenly just sort of blurts it out. She'd thought it private and maybe silly. But then she realises that if the Master was aware of observation, perhaps other creatures - such as Vecna - could be too. Caution may be needed when using the tower to observe a specific person rather than an area. There's a danger of discovery, but hopefully, pulling the focus away quickly would be enough to evade detection.



### 9000 XP each for the giants -> LEVEL 10

We get back to town around 4pm. We head for Know It All's, because it closes soon. It's run by a tortle, "Mr Know It All" - a nick-name, hopefully good-natured! We ask about the Hand & Eye. One book is found ("I knew I had this somewhere!"). It's quite small - more of a journal thank a book - "**Diabolical Creations and Items Of Malice**". The tortle flips to a section about Vecna and Kas. It was written some 20 years ago, so won't give the *current* location, but it's start. Oswen reads - HIS dirty 20 - she reads quickly and makes a few notes, cross-referencing mentally as she goes. Only takes 10 minutes! It includes information on the sword, too - specifically it points out that the sword is *not* in Kas' hands, was used to cut off the hand and cut out the eye and is believed by the author to be the thing that gave Kas the power-hungry motivation to betray Vecna in the first place. It describes the abilities of the Eye and Hand, has some accounts of where those both surfaced throughout history and **places the current location of the Eye back in Oerth and the Hand on Toril, with a specific red Dragonborn paladin!**

In thanks, we buy an empty journal he makes - well, two, 100 pages each, 5gp each and some high-quality hand-made blank scroll paper, 5 sheets, 2gp total.

It's worth waiting around, we think, until Hag's Nest opens. We grab some street food to pass the time! 4 meat-on-sticks for only 1 silver total. Eventually, we head to the shop and wait for it to open. Well past 5pm, the sign is unchanged but we can see activity inside. We knock on the door. A croaky voice says, "What is it?" "Are you open?" - "No, I'm not - wait - what is the time?!"

We're allowed in. It smells strange. Something bubbles away in the back of the shop. Shelves are covered with curios and relics. As she walks around, the hag leaves behind a strange cloud of soot and dust that settles - she seems to constantly sweep up around in front of her. We ask about the Eye and Hand. The reaction is quite sharp! We are asked to clarify... We're not sure who's side this one is on. Inafina, Insight only 12, so she's still not sure. We follow into a back room, on request. The hag insists there's no point; even if you do take down Vecna, another tyrant would just pop up again.

At the idea of this being for a world we consider home, she goes "Ha!" and transforms into a kind of beautiful vixen, Oswen-high. "So this is about revenge? Is it about revenge?" "I suppose... Part of it..." - before she even finishes, the hag exclaims, "Perfect! I will help you! Sweet revenge!"

A curtain is pulled back and a cloud of fumes waft out. Oswen CON save 16, OK but Inafina 10, an acrid smell makes her choke; Kindle and Bel likewise; it seems Oswen was low enough down to avoid the worst of the fumes. The others are mildly poisoned!

The Hag uses a "spying ball" to help us find a trail - clues or hints. Far too dangerous to scry at who _currently_ holds it; she can help unravel a chain of ownership, though. Show how the current owner took possession. "Which one do you want to know? I'll show you one only!" - home turf seems like a home advantage so - if perhaps the Hand is still on Toril - we opt for the Hand.

It's all very theatrical - the "spying ball" seems to 'connect' with a cauldron, bubbling away, things being dropped into it taken from jars - shredded butterfly wings, an eyeball and more - until suddenly the smoke clears and we can all clearly see a picture on the surface of the liquid. It's disorientating - there is depth and clarity.

It's a red Dragonborn. Large, muscular, scary; wicked-looking, spiked, blackened plate armour. They are in battle and defeating a Death Knight. Then it shifts. The Dragonborn throws a severed head of a pale-looking woman into a chasm. Then a shift. The Dragonborn flies over to a group - a large Goliath barbarian in war paint and other adventuring types - a female halfling cleric dressed in white, a gnome bard, two elves... Brother and sister?... (_Yes, Vox Machina, but we don't know that_) They throw a withered, green, putrid-looking hand onto a large stone and gather around it. The Dragonborn then, with them together, seem to use a magical ritual to weaken something about this hand, some bindings, so that it can be destroyed. The Dragonborn raises a huge axe with one hand, holds the other hand steady with his free hand - but as he swings down his axe, he says a prayer _to Tiamat_ and chops off *his own hand* and immediately the severed hand merges with his bloodied arm. He laughs, swinging the reassembled arm around in a circle and - teleports away. Another shift. **A hellish landscape, perpetually burning, people burning from a burning sky perpetually, things like meteors raining down - clearly one of the nine Hells - Avernus** - and there appears this Dragonborn; but waiting for them, apparently, is a withered-looking Tortle wearing necromantic clerics garb and wielding nasty-looking weapons of his own. The vision ends there.

"Might not be on Toril anymore then..." says Inafina after an awkward silence. "Did anybody recognise any of those people?" - of course, we didn't. (And we didn't know that the scene we saw of the group trying to destroy the hand _was not on Toril_ - but as a group looking at the vision, at that time, we assume it).

"That is **Arkhan the Cruel**" says the hag. "Do you know where he is now?" "No. But he is quite a frightening and well known figure. The **Tortle is Krull**, his lieutenant. Their exploits should not be too hard to trace! He is a paladin of Tiamat and does her bidding. Furthers her plots." So Oswen figures the last place we saw would've been **Avernus**. As for what we witnessed? A betrayal.

**After some more talking, there's nothing more to learn. We have a sombre dinner. Before bed, Oswen uses the Sending Stone - "Hand of Vecna likely to be held by Arkhan the Cruel. We will try and trace his current whereabouts. We're at Trade Gate now.".**
