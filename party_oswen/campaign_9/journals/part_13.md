# Oswen: Part 2.13
## Campaign Day 31
### Siabsungkoh

We're at the house of brothers Karem and Kasem, hoping to help resolve the business about staying, leaving, and store licences!

The door is opened; Karem has answered. "Everything's taken care of" we say, with intentional ambiguity. We're invited in. After a short entranceway is a sort of elongated courtyard with rooms coming off it. In the middle, under a pavilion, an older lady in a wheelchair, with a blanket over her - the mother we assume. She waves. "Come in! I have sweet tea and dates!" There's also a younger girl, Kasem sat next to her; he stands to welcome is in too and fetch some extra chairs.

"This is my mother **Aroon**" says Kasem. "Pleased to meet you." "This is my sister, **Karena**" and we greet her too and introduce ourselves.

It seems the mother is well aware of the concerns between the two brothers - but when asked, says she hadn't really thought about the stall. She's just happy that Karem found love! "You think I don't know what happens under my own roof? You don't think I have noticed how happy you are, every time that mouse gentleman is around? You used to be so happy as a child; then one day you stopped. It's like you were carrying the weight of the whole world on your shoulders. I know what it has been like for you. I know you feel - trapped." She turns to Kasem. "And you have been carrying the burden of the family ever since your father passed away! You've sacrificed your own happiness and I will not have it."

They argue back. At one point she says, "But you have involved outsiders!"

Oswen has to interject, apologetically; we rather involved ourselves! She haltingly tries to suggest an option of the three of the houses joining together. But even joined, there still need to be people to run the shop. But now the sister speaks up; "I could run the shop with you!" "But you have to stay and look after mother!" And then the mother, "Do *I* get a say in this?!"

And so it goes on. The mother says why she came here - the plane already only a fragment - it was a place of happiness and joy; to be together, raise a family, be in a community. To "keep all of this alive". But Karem does it for what he considers a duty; "That is the wrong reason! But I am glad I raised you well - you remember duty - but it must be balanced."

Inafina opines that this little town - this fragment of land - is beautiful and has a cohesion and strange sense of calm that reminds her of her monastery home. Others from outside may well feel that too, and if the opportunity were there, perhaps want to settle. If work were available... So perhaps a new coalition of stalls could be amongst the first to offer that new vision for a future of this land, instead of a slow decline.

Kasem is still a bit upset; he's wanted to keep the family happy, yet now they're saying he's wrong; but he harumphs; "Maybe it *is* time for a change... But how can I ever speak to her again? How can she ever forgive me?"

Their custom is song and sweets. Kasem claims to be terrible at both! So we agree that Bel will learn some of their song and Karena helps make some sweets, while Karem and Kasem work together to get Kasem well groomed and in his best clothes. This does take a while though and it's midnight; he's going to chicken out, it's too late!  "Imagine turning up at midnight!" "Shows commitment." "Or shows that you're crazy!" Karem thinks it's romantic. Everyone encourages. The mother quickly fetches one more thing; "Give her this" - and hands Kasem a beautiful ring in a small box. "What? But that's *your* ring!" "Yes. It belonged to your grandmother. It was given to me by your father. And now, it's time for it to move to the next generation. I've been saving this! I was going to give it to you two years ago... But I held onto it; I knew one day you'd come around."

So Kasem relents and we head off at pace.

Bel knocks it out of the park; performance 15+12 -> 27. Kasem is calling out and singing; lights turn on in nearby houses; heads pop out of windows. One window to which he sings is closed and shuttered. Inafina - ACRO dirty 20 - uses her staff to run up from around a corner (since the rest of us were keeping out of sight!) and uses her staff to flip open the shutters from below. *That* works - after a moment a head pops out, long black braided hair - but clearly having just woken up. "Kasem? Is that you? Are you crazy? What's going on!" (Bel is making encouraging noises - don't give up!). But Kasem is worried that she's too far up. Now Kindle has to run in, and hoists Kasem up to 2nd floor height.

...An apology is sung; sweets are presented...

"Oh you fool, I'll never understand you! You don't talk to me for two years then come in the middle of the night like this... Is this an apology?!"

"Yes, I have been a fool..."

"That you have! You're lucky that I *wait*."

The ring is held out. "I still feel about you the way I always have", he says. "Shall we make a commitment to each other?"

"This is a lot...!"

"I know! I'm making up for lost time."

"I accept your apology. Let's start there. You hold onto your mother's ring and we'll have that conversation another day... You big fool you!" (the latter said fondly). "I'm glad you came around. But it's the middle of the night and we're keeping the neighbours awake." She gives him a kiss on the cheek. "If you're serious, come get me in the morning and prove to me that it's not just because you're drunk on courage."

Well it's better than nothing! As we pack up and head off, being upbeat, Oswen tries to convince Kasem about one more thing - meet Sid Squid. At least say hello. So we get past and Sid is once again woken up, with apologies, but she probably expected it! And she'd expected us to sleep here, too. Kasem and Sid Squid agree to talk about it once all families are together. It might not happen, but least the "door is open" so to speak. "I hope the other two food stalls just chalk it up to a weird couple of weeks...!" "I think they will."

And with that - everyone heads off to bed.



## Campaign day 32

We awake surrounded by animals. We talk, a song is sung, spells are swapped. Over breakfast we ask Sid Squid - Sid for short, we're told! - about the big green crystal, if we're allowed onto it. There's some surprised; are we going to trade? Well, more for information (about the Eye, but we don't say *that* part). The gem will get us to the "Passage Of Respite". Through there we pay an entrance toll to the city, but that only gives us access to a trade area. To get into the citadel itself, "you will need an introduction from one of the People of the Radiant Citadel. I am *not* of the Radiant Citadel, but your friends from last night are. You will need to be vouched for such that they can welcome you as an ally. I suggest you make haste to the Aroons and ask!"

So we thank her and scuttle off, as behind us Sid starts getting the stall ready and the market is just starting to wind up. Lots of very interesting stalls with breakfast food, but not of the kind with which we are generally familiar. Although we'd already eaten some rations - ageing but still decent fruit from the Outlands - Bel can't be stopped! He queues briefly to get us some food, hot drinks and some pancakes. Not bad.

At the house, people are preparing food ready for the afternoon market. Kasem has headed off to speak to his loved one; Karem is packing! "Moving quickly!" "Yes! Strike while the iron is hot. I want to get to the Citadel and find Oliver right away!" "You're going to the Citadel? Oh! That's almost suspiciously convenient. So are we..." He agrees to help us, but mother Aroon is required to fill in the details. It's not something he's ever done before. She even gives him a necklace that's needed as "proof of lineage" when asking for access to the Hall Of Ancestors. And he is to hold onto it - "So that wherever you go, you remember where you came from."

(We sense a veiled sadness, mixed with happiness, in the mother - for obvious reasons).

"I have been mentally preparing for this day for years. I knew it would come. It is important. It happened to me too; I left home, left the comfort of the Citadel to come here."

It takes a while to get everything sorted, saying all the goodbyes (including waiting for Kasem to get back - now in much better spirits). We are told more things about the Citadel; be aware, be sensitive, don't make assumptions. A true melting pot. "Always be respectful - remember, it is full of proud people that they are the last of their respective kinds. As long as you remember that, you won't set a food wrong."

It's after 11am when we finally get underway. We are led down to the shore. Up close, the crystal is truly beautiful; 30ft tall, glistening in the late morning sunshine as waves sparkle and lap gently at the shore. A few people are there, looking over at us; "This is good timing - looks like a few of us will go together." The whole family has come to see us off.

Long hugs. Karem actually leaving, for real. He's also a bit sad - but also now full of hope. Another four people are there, and wait patiently as they can see the poignancy of the moment.

Karem walks up to the diamond-like gem looks at it and a strange refracting light - prismatic rays refracting - solidifies into a ruby-like ramp, and a facet on that side opens as some kind of portal. He starts to walk up; every few steps he turns look back at the city in which has lived his whole life. He waves to his family. Then turns to us; "Let's go". We all go in, but he stays at the doorway; a last wave; then the door closes.

We are now stood in a closed-end crystalline hall, but it's unnerving; we can see out easily, like being stood on very clear glass, right down into the water. We wonder how long this will take but almost immediately the gem starts to gain altitude. There are some kind of lean-against ledges in this interior space, but it's hard to make out geometry since from inside, everything is just very clear, but with refracted angles all around. It gets misty outside, then flashes; light the brightest lightening we've ever seen. "This reminds me of the mountain before Yon" comments Oswen. Bel asks, "But is this actually safe?" "Too late now!"

Then the gem bursts out of the storm, which we can now see was a huge storm with an eye where, in the centre, gleaming like a beacon is - *it*. A crystal, of sorts. Very long, beautiful, set amongst the clouds. It shines - it isn't just reflecting or refracting. All around it we see what can be best described as a spiralling *forest* with jagged edges, made of limestone, or chalk or even bone maybe. We start to get a sense of scale from that. It's enormous. We realise this forest is in fact a city, just very heavily wooded and lush; it must rise *hundreds* of feet, so the crystal spindle must be at least a mile long.

The five of us (with Karem) get quite excited, each pointing out things we see as we approach, every one of us spotting things different from one another as our attention gets drawn this way and that. We see other gems, like ours, hovering near the lower part of the spiral. We presume that must be the trade area.

One of the other passengers realises we are very new here. "You know, legend has it that the Citadel itself is built on the fossilised remains of an ancient being that coiled around the crystal, hidden in the deep Ethereal - hidden from the rest of creation by the Keening Storm. Only the Conchord Jewels are able to safely traverse it."

Another says, "Every culture you meet will have their own lore, their own stories about the history of this place. It goes back a very, very long way; most of what happened really now only lives in the realm of myth. The citadel is hidden in the keening gloom, protected but also isolated."

We just watch and wait as this extraordinary journey continues.

Our jewel floats down to where others are hovering - to the bottom of the spiral. We get right into a sort of dock with one other likewise docked; the portal reopens and we simply walk out.



### The Radiant Citadel

A group of six people are stood on what seem to be docks, ushering and welcome. They're sort of guards, of a sort, but not dressed in military uniform or carrying weapons. Everyone heads in the direction indicated. We walk past an ornate gate, covered in blooming flowers; well, it's more of an archway - no door. Stood there is someone in a colourful trimmed robe with rich patterns. We are welcomed. "Do you have your entrance toll?" "Ah - how is that paid?" asks Oswen. "We accept all currencies. A single coin."

We each pay 1 gold piece. Oswen, ARC 17+13->30 (!) - two guards near the official both wear a familiar design of helm, which looks like her helm of telepathy comes from. So there is a similar culture. She thinks in their direction, as loudly as she can think, "I am honoured to meet new people, and I have an object I think is from your culture - I do not know if you are allowed to speak to me, but if you are, I would love to hear more about it." At this, one guard nods, looks to his counterpart and leans into the priest, whispers something; the priest exclaims, "Ah! Right! It sounds like you are planning to be at the Citadel for a while, venturing beyond the Trade Discal." "If we are permitted." "Well it seems you know the customs and are prepared. Your questions will be answered, if you have them, in the Hall of the Ancestors."

In we go!

We walk past this Passage of Respite; a long precession way, flanked by beautiful statues and murals that seem to describe histories of many cultures. It's long to provide the opportunity for context and contemplation. Oswen soon is trailing some distance behind her party and Karem. Inafina has to head back and usher her on! We can study this more later perhaps. Oswen at least manages to count no less than **twenty seven** cultures described. And she doesn't recognise any of the cultures and, more than that, every one of them seems very different from those that she *does* know.

Once past the end of this 'corridor', Oswen comments "Well, we've seen some pretty outlandish places, including Sigil itself, but this might actually be the most remarkable of them all so far."

We look around. Humans, gnomes, elves, halflings - at least they seem to be of that nature - but with very different skin colourings and tones from that which she has before seen. A melting pot indeed, but not quite in the way she might have expected. And here - now we're in the Trade Discal proper - it's bustling, very busy - *but* not crowded, somehow. There are lots of areas of parks and gardens. It's less about lots of private buildings and more about stalls being set within this natural environment. And multi-level; there are things up in the trees and people travel vertically as well as horizontally. In that sense it would almost be elven, except very much not!

Karem says, "I don't have anywhere to stay in the main city... This is the more interesting part of town to be in. Why not get a couple of rooms here? I need to find Oliver anyway." We agree to meet "near the **Singing Fountain**" - he points - "in an hour" -  Karem is confident about finding Oliver swiftly. After that we'll figure our a room. He dashes off.

We wander around. As we get our "eyes into it" we realise it's not just a market; there are buildings where larger establishments are needed - tea houses, inns and so-on. In fact just about everything is represented except temples; some shrines, nothing more. Most likely because these are last-of-their-kinds people; no gods now perhaps? Or no contact? She asks Kindle about Yondalla and he stills feels in contact with her. "Perhaps their religions are just different that way" and points to the shrines, so we go up and look at one more closely.

Under a tree there is a low stone altar, a stone and painted mosaic back with stylised writing on it, an offering bowl and some sticks of incense that are burning. There's an array of floral wreathes, trinkets and so-on all arrayed around. Much of that seems familiar and unsurprising. We don't know what the religion is, though.

As we continue on, Oswen notices various magic shops including a scroll-only place called a "Scriptorium". Signs here seem to be written in multiple languages including Common, and she spots one called "Calligrapher's Alley" and she asks the other three to wait for her! That causes surprise of course, but she just says "it's a secret! And if you want to wander on that's fine, I'm sure I can find you. Worst case, I'll meet you back at that fountain."

One of the many businesses down the alley seems to advertise supplies specifically; she opens a sliding door and heads in. There's an old catfish-faced humanoid. They have greyish skin, long whiskers. They have glasses on and have a habit of looking over the top of them.

She asks for decorative, robust paper for a gift, and ideally a scroll case too. The shop owner walks on their fail fins, upright, quite adeptly, to a wall with various options. There are scrolls for vertical or horizontal text and scrolls that open horizontally or vertically; there are various choices of parchment types, or even silk scrolls, with rods made of all kinds of different things. And so it goes on. Something not "regal", more homely; a tone that's warm not cold; and so-on. Scroll dowels are in a wood of *his* choice, by Oswen's request - a white wood, carved - because *that* part references the place from which the scroll was obtained.

So she has it; a textured scroll with leaf patterns at the back, matched but simple parchment on the front, white wood dowels. It's all sized, stuck and put together. Perfect. It can be hung on a wall if need be. She's very happy! It comes to 3gp and 3sp, which almost seems cheap (and she realises that there's some kind of commerce tax going on and that's what the 3sp is for).

She heads back to rejoin the group. They're patiently waiting, looking in windows of shops nearby. Bel is eager to know what she got, but it's a secret! They'll find out later. "Rats!"

Inafina sees something of interest... "The Way Of The Guiding Hand" is one. Martial arts? But as we're heading that way, two small pangolins run between our legs and past us. They're made of... We look closer, surely not?! Floating connected shards of a ruby-red crystal! Constructs, or... We have no idea. Nobody else seems to care particularly, so we figure that's just part of the melting pot. Oswen clears her throat and calls after them, "Excuse me, uh, sorry for the interruption..." - one stops and turns. Sniffs the air. She tries to enquire about them being quite wonderful creatures, but does not know what - type - they are? The answer is telepathic, or even *empathic*; they are the "Children of the Crystal" - concepts being conveyed - spirits of the peoples here. Small pieces of a greater whole. There are big versions of them. Not offspring, more like splinters. She thanks them for their time.

We head into "**The Way Of The Guiding Hand**". Manuscripts - lots of them. Writings, teachings, meditations. Beautiful sash belts, hand wraps, soft shoes, robes and more. Various different kinds of staff and spear, along with practice weapons. There are slings and similar things too. She focuses on ropes; fighting ropes, a bit like whips; could be handy. There are some charms of some kind in display cases and a few hanging on a wall. Oswen helps Inafina decipher the use of some of those charms. ARC 28 (with help of Detect Magic to help sort out things which are "merely" beautiful from magical items). She also spots some hand wraps and a pair of boots that are magical. One necklace of beads seems to have spell magic imbued in them. Another is a sort of amulet that would, she thinks, imbue the wearer with health. The latter might be interesting; the former looks like it needs an ability to cast spells through the necklace - that's more Oswen's domain than hers. The hand wraps are bleached muslin, and it looks like they'd be more useful. Could make her able to hit a bit harder, should need arise! She asks the shopkeeper; 250gp for them - before Commerce Tax. She raises an eyebrow at that, but Oswen points out that she's spent *far* more on spells and this seems like a very convenient way to have a bit of a boost. So in the end it's agreed and we pay!

The shop keeper shows her some forms to practice with. Essentially once properly wrapped, a strike has a kind of extra wind force at the end; extra 'oomph'.

We don't want to get too far away from the fountain, but note that the Trade Discal is very large and in different sections for certain things. Bel wants a music store or, better, to hear some performances and we're all in favour, but we also note a strange area a distance away that looks like a curious combination of paddocks and warehouses.

We're next to a Scriptorium and even though Oswen isn't sure what she might even have interest in, the others encourage her in. A dark-skinned gnome with hair tied up in a bun asks if he can help. All she can think of is something to help us find things, or solve mysteries?! Well, there's Clairvoyance, but we'd need to know where to put the sensor. Another one is Legend Lore, but he's not so sure that would be useful to us. An expensive spell to cast potentially. Needs ivory strips and burns a LOT of incense. It's sort of Divination but very targeted. The shop keeper is almost dismissive.

Oswen thinks a while and says, "I'm not sure we can afford it. But while I recognise it's very specific, it might actually be sometimes be more in line with the sorts of things we search for than you might think."

But then another one is produced - Locate Object. She knows that and we both agree that it's more useful for finding things you lost and have a rough idea of the whereabouts. That's why Oswen was more interested in the "lateral thinking" of Legend Lore. But can we possibly afford it? It's 3000gp for the scroll, we'd need to somehow find about 200gp of ivory, there's tax on top *and* a huge amount of incense would be burned. But even so, we do have money "in the bank".

Oswen - with a bit of help from Bel - tries being at least a *bit* persuasive. That tax is a killer! ADV Persuasion 15. If we're travellers and sure we're not buying the scroll for use *here*, so it could not be cast from the scroll within this plane, then the commerce tax could be waived. She's going to take the scroll, but he offers her a room to copy the spell; it won't consume the scroll so he can re-sell it, then give us what we need - inks etc. - to copy. He doesn't know, presumably, that she can do this "fast" but doesn't seem to care.

Oswen once again apologises to the group and disappears into the room. And rather than copy the spell, she gets her note book and sketches an outline of the blank scroll she bought and uses it to practice laying out the translation of Kindle's amulet poem. HIS 19, she's *fairly* sure she knows the poem well but realises she can't be 100% sure. Trouble is, looking at the amulet would be a dead giveaway. She finishes practicing on her best guess of the poem to at least be confident in the layout and how to size and space it on the "real thing". But it'd take a good half hour to write the *real* thing in good quality.

She finishes then fast-copying the other spell and emerges to greet the group. The shop keeper realises she can fast-copy and isn't too surprised!

Before we leave, the shop keeper notes that we're obviously _researching_ something. If we have access, "head into the **Republic's Libraries in the Palace of the Exiled**. If you have a chance, perhaps, if this works at all for you - spend time in the **Preserve of the Ancestors**, speaking to the spirits - the **Incarnates** - there, for they possess the accumulated knowledge of their peoples. And if still unable to find what you're looking for, try the **Court of Whispers**. That's where almost all _current_ information is traded. But you *will* need to have permission to enter the Radiant Citadel before you are able to do that."

It's fountain-o-clock. As we walk, Oswen wonders out loud, "I wonder if that ship got here - like, how we'd know? We'd need to find the Golden Vault, I suppose." "How would the ship navigate *that* though?" asks Bel, pointing out at the distant storm. "I don't know. Perhaps the Golden Vault is somewhere outside, not actually inside the Citadel? Or maybe they transfer to one of those crystals we were in, parking up outside?" "But where we birthed it definitely looked like it could take ships. But you'd need to be quite the thrill seeker to dare that storm!" "Perhaps there's more to it - objects, or even a person from this land, who maybe is able to navigate it?"

Bel is quick to notice, as we walk, a building that's very out of place. It's next to a very colourful area, but the building is plain, light marble, temple-like columns but familiar insignia and logos. A branch of the central bank! We might have time to make a withdrawal?! It's close to that other area that we saw with the paddocks and warehouses. So we head in.

This place is familiar, not too unlike the Sigil branch inside visually but at the same time it feels out of place. We're greeted, explain what we need and we're led to a desk. A cashier looks after us. Bel has our identity cards! We withdraw 5000gp, in the form of 10 gold trade bars, each worth 500gp - except it's 9 bars, and 450gp because there's a rather steep fee, apparently - because it's the Radiant Citadel.

Since we're there, we ask about getting through the storm - it requires great skill and very specific knowledge about safe ways through. Usually that means local knowledge. A mis-step can result in death!

We hustle to the fountain. And yes, it does indeed sing. It's got a fractal, natural sort of shape with a main fountain in the middle and smaller away from the edges. Water jumps from angled spouts between pools in short bursts and each spout makes a different note when that happens. There are huge, beautiful flowering trees. We wait around a bit. There are food stalls, and it's probably close to lunch time, but we wait for the Karem. Fortunately, he's not late so we don't get to worry if anything has happened! Oliver is indeed a very dashing Musteval with large ears - and slightly shorter than Oswen.

It's decided that we'll all stay at the same inn - hopefully there's room - and we learn that if we end up in the Citadel proper, accommodation is free! So only one night. Oliver almost apologises for the location; he usually travels alone... Well, is it lively? We like lively! His eyes widen. "Oh, it's very lively!"

We pass through that paddock/warehouse area. It's for very large, bulk trades of all kinds. We end up tucked under another layer of this strange, winding place, and quite close to the crystal itself - the "**auroral diamond**". Soft lights seem to move through it and this close, it feels like there's a constant light show happening. There are two trees (but true giants, going up 100ft or more and arching up to apparently connect with or maybe just push under the next layer of the spiral above) with things built around, and at least two layers of things built aloft, between their trunks.

Music plays from almost every building. Very much a nightlife place. We are brought to an inn - **The Pompous Brat** - a surprisingly confronting name! It has a kind of Spanish Mission style, colourful, impressive looking; in dress, there's a sort of Havana/Cuba lively area feel. Rooms open onto a common area with a verandah / balcony. People all around are hanging out chatting - and flirting! - "but not me! I'm just here to make friends" says Oliver and he and Karem (fortunately) laugh. We see a goliath - except dark skinned - she's 7.5" tall if not taller with no hair except a single braid that seems to be wrapped into a circle atop her head. She greets Oliver, obviously knows him and then we are introduced too. We're asked how many beds - no apparent surprise if we had some shared! - but in our case, one room with four beds. Just the one night.

8sp price, but 9sp and 6cp with "the accommodation tax". We're show to our room. It's up a level and has a window opening to the back, which is fortunately not too noisy. And "happy hour starts at 4:30pm - in about an hour". Oh! It's later than we realised. Time zones...

So, music shops. Or music. We're in a very different part of town with certainly a lot of music, so we'll explore. We chat to people on the way out and learn that the Court of Whispers has some *amazing* performances but there are great cantinas here too; we end up with a quite of places to try. And yes, there are music shops too! We get told in particular though about an old guitarist, semi-retired now that runs a kind of academy here and we seek out first.

It's a humble-looking, flat-roofed two storey building sandwiched between two larger others with a sign "Guierrmo's Fretted Instruments". In we go! There's the distinct impression that this is a residential building and a kind of converted front room forms the shop, so it's quite small compared to the exterior impression. Guierrmo is an older human. Are we here to learn, to just chat, or "to meet the old Guierrmo?!" - and Bel opts for the latter. Bel takes the conversation's lead. "I must admit - I have heard how famous you are, but I have never heard you play."

Guierrmo is on a kind of Flamenco guitar; he plays a very virtuoso style, fast performance. Bel is fascinated.

It's about chord progressions and speed; being nimble. Guierrmo explains that it must be thought about differently. Bel plays his instrument and sings, and/or plays alongside others. His Bandore is used as accompaniment. Guierrmo says that his guitar is *his voice*, it's a main melody. It is front-and-centre. It takes a while and Bel does OK eventually - performance roll is middle-of-pack, but his natural talent elevates that to 23. It'll take a lot more practice to get good, of course - and his own instrument is in part simply not designed to be played that well.

He's invited to performances tonight. The other three of us think that sounds good. And Guierrmo recommends a craftsman who makes amazing instruments. "There's nothing like it, if that's the kind of music you want to play - nothing quite like it anywhere else!"

And just like that, we have a schedule for our evening.

It's a lively, friendly area of town, albeit with a lot of drinking. It's like there's a rule of "there are no strangers". People just start conversations. Soon enough, we get wrapped up in that and end up drifting around and chatting, with no specific goal, just taking in the atmosphere.

As part of that, we're asked where we are from and Toril is surprisingly recognised. There were apparently a lot of refugees - hundreds - from there, on the other side of the Trade Discal (quite a walk) in dormitories that were set up for them. The people we speak to don't remember the exact name of where they were from and we don't recognise the name, but head that way anyway - if these people escaped Vecna, maybe we can find something useful for Vi. We find them - red-skinned, emerald, slightly glowing eyes, 4.5-5" tall, slender. Not humans; almost-human features but narrow faces and instead of hair, what looks almost like feathers - long and trailing, like tropical birds. Oswen approaches one at random more or less; "Hello! My name is Oswen." The look a little startled then answer, "My name is **Lambaka**".

Oswen asks about Toril. Lambaka says he thought there was something familiar about "her look" - and indeed she is described as "Feyrunian". Indeed, they are from another continent. They escaped; not the first to arrive; others escaped too. Their forebears escaped Feyrunian - a long history! - but they escaped when they saw the Feyrunian cities, those on their land at least, being attacked. They've always had evacuation plans should aggression increase again. They escaped in a Conchord Jewel that lived in a sacred mountain.

One asks if we've heard of their land, **Maztica**.

And yes, indeed, that is where the beans come from. That's - well, awful. Feyrun has done some very bad things. Their land is rich in gold and gems - that was why there originally was an invasion, and port cities were established. Their people fought back for centuries, before succumbing. Disease, famine and more. Warfare. Awful. The first of their people left a few hundred years ago now, to come here. Other people here too; similar stories; but Lambaka and his extended group are much more recent. They're not recognised by the Incarnates in the same way, yet. A mixture of peoples (we see a few who look somewhat different).

Oswen vows to try and make it better known - this history - when she returns. *If* she returns.

Anyway, the last thing *they* overlord's tower - a symbol of their military might, from which they controlled the country - was blasted and destroyed. "It is magically protected; it has ruled over everything it sees for at least the last 150 years. From it, the forces and the magic came to enslave one of our ancestor spirits, a flying snake spirit. And that broke our people. It is a very, very powerful institution - yet it was destroyed in less than a minute."

Comparing notes - yes, Vecna. They have a different nane, but the same person. They have legends about this - if Vecna (or their name for him) were to return. They knew he wasn't destroyed, merely denied, in distant history. And if it *is* him, then their ancestor spirits - "**the Dawn Incarnate of our people**" - would have their ancestral memories of this creature and how he was outsmarted last time. How he was driven from their world.

(So if we can - we should try to speak to that Incarnate.)

We are invited to join them for dinner. The food is provided by the city, but they say there is plenty. It would be rude to leave. We meet more and more, and hear more and more stories. Some ran to the mountain from a distance, aware of trouble. Others were nearby. Each story is different.

Eventually - and feeling not so bad about the city taxes, suddenly - we part company and head back, not quite in the same mood and with much to think about. We're surprised to see that the auroral diamond has dimmed! It seems to have a "night more". What's more, we're so used to things like the Outlands that for a moment we weren't really thinking in terms of where the "sun" was. And we realise that in fact it was the diamond itself; the very tips brighten and dim. Not just the "light show" in the middle.

We hasten towards the performance area where we were meant to be. Things are already underway, but it's someone else on the stage right now. It's a sort of small auditorium arrangement - outdoors, with tiered seating just on the grass with stone edge work, and a central performance area. Perception 17 (Inafina) - distinctive ears and a tall man waving to us - we wave back and head over. We squeeze into place alongside Karem and Oliver.

Various different performances come and go, but it's not too long until Guierrmo appears, on his own on a stool; lights shine on him in the dark; there's a hushed silence. Then he plays. It's a long, detailed, complex song, but sombre and profound - finishing to rapturous applause. He plays one more, this time lively - everyone gets up and dances and we're encouraged to join in. And so it goes on; all manner of performer. A lot of fun. Eventually Oliver and Karem say they'd like to get some "proper" food and drink and invite us a long; they're not going anywhere private! We join them.

Drink is served in buckets! It's ladled into cups. We ask Karem how he's finding things. He's been before but it's been family business. This is quite a different experience. Then Oswen thinks of something and shows Oliver her Golden Vault locket; he's not got one, but he's worked with people who've got similar ones. But he *does* know the name Golden Vault. Inafina notices him almost touch a pin on his cloak at one point, which seems significant to her because of the way he *stopped* himself touching it, as if that might give something away. She'll have to describe it to Oswen later (and she'll guess at a Harper pin).

Oliver and Karem chat about futures, with Oliver trying not to push Karem since he's only just left home. When we are asked what we are planning, a combination of a drink or three plus this place feeling strangely safe means Oswen just openly discusses everything - a short version, of Vecna and the Eye and Hand. Oliver hasn't heard much about Vecna directly but certainly plenty of stories of planes experiencing disasters of some kind and has heard of many who've fled Toril specifically. Some were even put up in the Palace Of The Exiled, so "something big is definitely going down" he says!

He shares stories he heard with some time spent in Waterdeep about the Hand. Oswen HIS 19. His stories are anecdotes and at best second hand, but much of it line up with what we read. "I would say that the Shield Bearers, and even things happening in the Court of Whispers *here*, has shifted tone and ramped up since this started to go down." Stuff is going on deeper within but he hasn't been able to get anyone to talk to him.

* We learn that audiences within can take many days!
* Oswen goes with Oliver to get drinks but also make sure he has a quick escape from here. We both think it's a safe space, but she wants to make sure Oliver is aware of just how fast & powerful Vecna's invasions can be - without freaking out Karem.
* We end up with a sort of slow-ferment firey brew that has various things which go with it, to be drunk carefully!

The evening rolls on. Inafina hears - ADV perception 25 - hears a familiar accent. Feyrunian. More specifically, Sembian - it's not like she's spent much time on that plane with her carnival travels, but has had plenty of town around Oswen's friends and the town now. A group of some 6 people sat around a table having drinks, talking loudly at each other. She shoulder taps Oswen to point them out. Oswen agrees. And she's had even more to drink now she wanders over to that table and introduces herself out of nowhere!

"I'm Oswen, from Ordulin in Sembia - are you from anywhere near?"

"Ordulin? You're an in-lander! I'm from Saerloon! Well. Was..." - and seems uncomfortable - does "she" know? - and tries to explain, we weren't there on the day but were scrying... That seems to change the mood a bit though. "Oh. Right. You *do* know what happened, then? Even though you weren't there?" She explains about Vecna and being in several places - but he doesn't recognise that story at all. "My name is **Gawi**" he says; but another in the group, who had been silent, finally starts to blurt out what they've held back. "You knew it was going to happen? And did nothing?!" - and so there we are; the guilt is back, and yes, we believed, but others didn't, and that's why we were scrying in the first place.

Eventually things calm enough to hear this man's story. He was on a trade run, through Neverwinter, then up and inland with valuable merchandise to Silverymoon. He saw it attacked - he saw the *mithil* attacked. He was in the market, trying to conclude some business. The ground shook, people ran outside; they could see Silverymoon Tower full of mages, throwing out spells, defending against a hoard of demons that were suddenly swarming the perimeter. He saw extraordinary magic being cast, the mithil reinforced; but eventually some gargantuan demon crashed through. One of the wizards turned into a dragon, the two fought; this caused a lot of destruction in the city by itself. Then someone appeared and some kind of shock wave went out from them - people had been running towards the tower, told that where they were evacuating to; and suddenly he was teleported out, appearing in what he learned was the Outlands. He's sure his family is gone - all accounts of Neverwinter said that invading hoards steamrolled through the countryside to get there, bursting out of the ground, and bursting out of the Neverwinter chasm.

(Neverwinter too, then. We weren't watching there.)

We eventually learn that all of these people are trying to connect with The Fixers. But she can't remember what that was. HIS 14. Familiar. If we come across any... "We're trying to organise a meeting through someone. All we have to go with is this" - and one holds out a scrap of cloth, with an insignia on it. "This is all we have to go by... The Fixers use this insignia somewhere, somehow." Not the same as Oliver's pin. THAT jogs her memory - HIS 22 - she has seen it on several items that Vi owns. Vi went... Where was it... Baldur's Gate...

"One moment" she says... Sending to Vi. "At Radiant Citadel. Many Toril refugees. Could do with contacting Fixers here. Do you know of any?" - a reply. "Oh. Private channel?! Yes! **Armando** is recruiting at Citadel. Court of Whispers. Password - **<two words>**. Use with care." Oswen side-eyes Inafina, who knows what that means - insight 24, has some doubts and suspicions about whether this group is legitimately what they say, and why they want to meet any of Fixers. So she takes over the conversation. These are people who feel a great sense of anger - but also guilt. And they want to *do* something but don't know what. So they've followed a wisp of hope. She smiles at Oswen. It's OK.

In the end, we learn that they can reach the Court. No gates anywhere, you can wander around. It's more about audiences with people. She uses Illusory Script to write the password, Armando's name, "referred by Vi via Oswen" for the one guy who was most angry! He can read it. But please burn it after! Or have Armando change the password.

* Other groups from Toril are here, we now learn.
* Court of Whispers: Toril agents who go in trying to trade information and organise ways to contact other Toril people and find out more about what happened. They're trying to form a resistance.
* A large contingent of people from Toril and from **Abeir** - a splinter / mirror dimension of Toril (and **that's news to us?! What?!**) - a cataclysm some time ago happened when the two merged, but then sundered again... Another day, another Toril cataclysm! So sounds like Vecna might have got both Toril and this "mirror plane" at the same time. But the more it is described the more it sounds like really a kind of adjacent plane, some areas map to areas on Toril, people are similar, some of the ancient history is the same.
* There are large groups of them - thousands! - being looked after in the complex of the Palace Of The Exiled. (Surely that's not sustainable).

Eventually we leave them to their own devices and return to our table. Inafina's watching Oswen and asks - "are you OK?" "I guess. But it did bring back some bad memories. At least a lot more got out than I realised."

We later head home; Oliver and Karem want to carry on dancing but Karem assures us he will be see us tomorrow for access to the Citadel.

We see the swirling maelstrom of the Keening Gloom, but a distance away; we also see what seem to be stars, very large, multi-colour, orbiting. Those are the Conchord jewels. We even see our ruby red one. The auroral diamond is glowing softly; dim; lights moving and blinking slowly around and within.

"I certainly hope he never does come *here*. It would be a terrible thing, if this fell."

(During the night, Oswen creeps up to the roof to finish the scroll for Kindle).



## Campaign day 33

We awaken. Today we hope to enter the citadel proper. We figure we'll have breakfast nearby, if available, so that we're easily found by Karem and Oliver. So we head out. No shortage of places! It's "daylight" - morning - both the top and bottom ends of the crystal appear to be very brightly lit. The ground beneath us of course shadows the lower light, but it's odd to see it bouncing off the storm clouds in the distance, as if from two suns. The centre emanates a brighter, but still soft glow.

Pan-fried dough discs, folded, with peanut and honey and butter inside and a Mastican - hmm, is that now better spelled Maztican? - style brew. To our surprise, Karem shows up - and is dressed to impress! Kaftan, headdress, elegant jewellery with Oliver in town. "I can't understand how you can drink and dance that much and still look that good..." says Oswen who isn't sure but thinks she *might* have a bit of a headache.

We're thinking about those crystal birds. Inafina points out that she's seen lots of them - all manner of different animals. They're treated routinely; not like they're animals, but just like "real things". They don't seem to behave more cautiously or "proper" around them - so hopefully these aren't a form of policing! Even so, Oswen can't shake the notion that there's some shared mind here. A joined or perhaps even single consciousness.

In due course - it's time. Oliver has many errands to run and leaves us in Karem's capable hands. We start going up the spiral. Cultural characters vary from area to area - not in a ghetto sense, just almost like a "theme". Some areas are mixed. There always seems to be a lot of tradition and ritual happening somewhere. It's as if these close neighbours are still figuring things out. Individually rich in culture and tradition, but as a group, it feels somehow... New.

There are a few market areas but they're much smaller than the Trade Discal. It seems that the Discal is disproportionately large and in fact has sprawled out from around the large warehouse area. Exactly how that construction happens? No idea.

We pass the Palace of the Exiled. Or Palace of Exiles. Or Exiles Palace. Or - apparently lots of different names depending who you are! Terraces, domes, minarets, spires, with a blue theme, emerging as if growing out of a forest of flowering shrubs and trees. It's very impressive and quite busy around here.

"And there is the House of Convalescence" says Karem, pointing to a large building next to the palace. Apparently it's where all the sick get taken and treated. Recent arrivals are usually taken to the palace and are the most likely to need that facility, which is why they're nearby. "This is the main centre for most people who find their way to the Radiant Citadel as refugees - which is the usual reason people end up here." Certainly, other than the Trade Discal this is the most lively area we've seen.

(Karem also tells us where the Court of Whispers is, but we don't pass by it on our way to whatever this "registration"/signing-in will be).

We reach a tree-lined road that seems to head inwards toward the diamond. There are some small shops and inns "This is it - the Preserve Of The Ancients is ahead, where the Incarnates and Dawn Incarnates, and the Hall Of Speakers lies. Let me do the talking!"

We're at what seems to be a cave within the diamond itself - a huge, jagged entrance, some 20ft high. Karem flags down someone with a decorative chain around their necks that give the impression of being an official marker as we head in. The walls are all of the diamond and there are lots of the crystal creatures. One looks like a small lynx - it bounds up, a pale white blueish stone, opaque. Oswen looks to it, "Well, you're very beautiful!" and it rubs past her leg like a house cat might, except it's made of stone, weathered almost, smooth, but hard as stone is. From there it tends to run ahead of us, then stop and wait looking back, then run again. We seem to have a new companion.

An obsidian eagle! Well, there's a sight - it makes a high-pitched whistling sound, perched up on trees *inside*. Things are opening up into a giant cavern containing an actual *forest* inside this crystal. The dome seems - well, endlessly high. Is this thing hollow, or is the ceiling crystal; you really can't tell. It's kind of twilight, though, so not bright, but plenty to see by. She wonders how these trees get water - but guesses they must be 150ft tall in some cases, real giants. Must be very old.

Orvil suddenly pushes more loudly into Oswen's head than usual. "That makes me nervous!" - to the stone lynx. "Oh! I'm sorry. Don't worry, I won't let it do anything bad!"

Birds of paradise in crystal form, multicoloured, bright, dart in - flying like fantails, darting in and out, apparently examining us. And there are deer, or antelope, but feathered - crystal feathers - pale white with light blue markings. Karem stops a moment. "It always surprises me how marvellous I think this looks!" "I worry that this might spoil you for other planes! There is much beauty elsewhere, of course, but this is... Certainly up there with the best."

Eventually the first official hands us off to another, who will "present our petition" to one of the speakers. Curiously familiar language for Oswen. Eventually an older lady appears - she is the Speaker Of The Ancestors for Siabsungkoh, the people of that place being a remnant of one of the 15 core cultures that run the Radiant Citadel day to day. She greets us.

* Her name is **Avyrn** AKA "The Speaker Of Ember"
* She will introduce us to Ember ("though I think you have already met" - huh?)

We are led to a medium-sized Ruby pangolin, much bigger than the one we saw before. There are smaller ones around. So Oswen says, "Ah, so they are all connected?" "They are all of our ancestral spirits, yes. We are more than happy to vouch for you, to join as one of the Peoples Of The Citadel. But if that fails, Ember has agreed to take you in as one of ours - if that is necessary."

We are invited to sit in at an area that is a sort of amphitheatre. Near the middle are 14 others, each with a companion - not all animals; some trees - again made of crystal, or stones. Ember and Avyrn join them. A coordinating official comes into the centre and sings; a particular song of welcome and praise; other songs join theirs, in other languages. "Don't worry, not everybody has to sing!" whispers Karem to us. With that done, one of the 15 takes the centre and talks about **preparing for influx of a lot more people** potentially - so they *are* aware of what's going on - "Clear out the upper parts of the spiral and make more habitable areas" - no demiplanes then? A vote is taken. Not everyone agrees. There is then a debate. "We cannot continue housing people indefinitely..." - but for a while, others argue they certainly can. Of course, a long-term plan is needed. "Most people don't stay - they get back on their feet and move on; but if they choose to stay we welcome them - they enrich our city".

"On that note" says Avyrn, standing, "I have some people I would like to propose to the Dawn Incarnates. Not to come as refugees, but to join as People Of The Citadel. They do have a place to go. The refugee provisions do not apply to them. For some of them, though, their world has fallen - Toril - one of the two. So, they *could* come in on refugee provisions but they want to contribute and choose not to. As the Speaker of Ember, I would like to propose that we allow them to commune with the Dawn Incarnates such that they can be tested."

There is some push back... Is this an appropriate time?! There's a lot going on... The refugee process is faster anyway... And so-on. At one point Avyrn mentions, "They are of more significant. Their place in the stars is preordained." Well that certainly raises *our* eyebrows!

A vote is taken. And it is in our favour.

Karem is quite excited, beckoning us to go down - we thank him profusely and then we are led to the centre of this amphitheatre. It is quite intimidating! "Head along the path any time you are ready and the Dawn Incarnates will meet you in there."

"Thank you..." - and we follow the path immediately, which leads out of the amphitheatre and towards the trees. We see that the various companion beings we saw from the 15 are joining us, the pangolin closest. The eagle is here too, flying from tree to tree. There's a black and orange striped stone alligator! A moonstone water lily somehow floats in on a stone stem; a pearl carp. Very unusual but very beautiful.

Eventually we reach wherever it is we are meant to be; Ember tells us where to stand. All these creatures gather around us.



### The Trial of the Dawn Incarnates

We will be tested; why are we here, what do we want. We don't speak, we think. The group agrees to aim thoughts at Oswen. She does her best but they're in her head and her thoughts are firing off in all different directions. Some of their questions provoke new anxieties - "Do you think that what you search for will endanger people here?" for example - well it might! Questions overlap; at one point she has to hold up her hand and says, "Please, slow down" out loud. It does, but then begins again.

"When it comes to it, will you fight for the people? Will you fight for their survival? Will you do more than watch and record?" asks a pacing tiger - to all of us. Inafina thinks back immediately, "Of course" and Oswen is simultaneously thinking "We already have and would continue to do so"; before Bel and Kindle can even answer the carp floats up and think-speaks. "Each of you are..." and it uses a concept with a word attached that feels like, exile; but it's to *choose* to leave; emigrant almost, from our homes. We don't live amongst our people. "...So what people do you stand with? What is your place? Where is your place? Who are your people?"

* Oswen says, "Someone else asked us a similar question recently. All I could answer was - however strange it seems - all of them" (mentally gesturing around her, at everything) "but I hope one day to live a simple life with Leonidas on whatever world we may find for us" (which might not be answering the question; it's more, could this be the home?)
* Inafina says, "I thought I'd return to my home. And I will. But I think I have outgrown it. I don't know where I will land."
* Bel and Kindle answer, but we can't hear each other.

The eagle points out that many of us have more than one home. We don't all live in one place. "*We* are all displaced. None of us still have intact worlds to call home. We must all create a new way to honour everything that we have come from, while walking in the light of the future."

Oswen for the first time suddenly truly confronts the possibility that she might never be able to return to Toril. She might even have changed so much that she can't even return to Leonidas.

She is surrounded by 15 examples of creatures from worlds that were destroyed. And yet they live on. Perhaps that strange library in our keep will be all that's left, truly. She's shaken quite a lot by this, and they've had a long time to come to terms with it and she hasn't, so she finds herself almost accidentally lashing out a bit mentally - "But this is new to me, and hasn't even happened to them; so these questions are premature..." -  "...in your lived experience yes!" 'says' the lily - "...but not in understanding how mature your empathy is. When confronted with what you see around you, do you understand it? Do you empathise it?"

A firey scorpion, made of stone, seems rattled. It comes forward and questions her tenacity! And her conviction. "Maybe this isn't the right place for you. Maybe what you seek you can get here as a visitor. And your quest for the truth or for glory or whatever your quest is. We know your type. You will move on to the next place and the next. We know those who leave a wake of destruction behind them. We don't want to draw that attention to ourselves. We will fight if we must be we fight for our own."

Oswen eyes the scorpion. She turns to the lily. "Understand it? One day I might, but I hope never to. Empathise? You already know that I do." And then she does her best to answer the scorpion. Whatever happened to its culture must've been violent and unresolved. Much anger remains. If she was the only one standing, if she had to kill the perpetrator of the crime? It is not her place to gauge what is justice, in the general case, but if she could do that with Vecna she would.

Now a pear tree. "Your thoughts on justice... If you can ensure the safety of many by caging this villain, but you do not get to mete out justice - how would that sit with you? To swallow your pride and face the humiliation in return for centuries of peace and calm that are assured? How would you weigh this?"

"It would not feel like humiliation, truthfully; I am worried that if we are only able to push this creature back and hope it does not escape again, then future generations will have to deal with it. But if that is the best we can do then that is good enough."

"I will rephrase. If you have the chance to exact retribution at the risk of the integrity of the planes, versus caging them without the satisfaction of punishment for the crimes? But assured centuries of peace?"

Oswen nods and looks at the scorpion and thinks, "Probably not what you'd want to here - but I would gladly forego any of my own concepts of retribution or reciprocity, the satisfaction of feeling like justice is done, if it were at least enough that this creature was finally caged; for that in itself is justice. And all we want is stability. This creature is the ultimate expression of imbalance; nothing can survive, it must be stopped. There is nothing to weigh here."

A feathered nest uncoils - and turns out to be a serpent, which was coiled in the boughs of the pear tree. It is feathered and flies in a figure eight, iridescent, beautiful; "But if all is lost. If the worlds crumble and all that remains are the people who we save, running from refuge to refuge, how would you deal with that?"

"Once I had picked myself up; got past my grief and stole myself to action; I would run with them, defending their backs, and do that until my strength left me. And you know that."

"Then, little one, you can see through the eyes of empathy; there are no winners. War is a horror unto itself, with no winners" - and unexpectedly, there is a glimpse shared of its own pain, centuries of war; a people beaten, once strong and proud, but warlike; eventually realising that pursuing the glory of war would wipe them out. To resist and fight to their dying breath would relegate them to phrases in song. They chose to live. "Sometimes, everything that we stand for is too dogmatic and one has to reevaluate on the reality. It is better to live than it is to die."

"I judged people from my own cities who made that choice, but lately I think I judged them harshly."

The tiger moves to stand in front of our group directly. It looks at us, then at the others; they all retreat back a bit. Then the carp swims to the pangolin and both approach. "We will get **Sholeh**. We have decided."

Oswen sees the lynx - she hadn't noticed it; it was hiding on the periphery. It trots off, then comes back with an older lady. Think - Avasalara (The Expanse), but with more plain clothing. She has a stern aspect but is one of those people for whom one has immediate respect, for reasons that are hard to identify. "I am Sholeh. I am the oldest of the speakers. Isn't this a beautiful place? It was like this when my cohorts and I discovered it." "It certainly is". "It was here in our moment of need. Have you ever experienced that?" Oswen thinks of the keep in the Fey. "Yes."

For a moment she seems to shift; and we don't see a lady, we see a strikingly beautiful bronze dragon instead; then it shifts back; she gives us a smile. "We were wondering what was going on in there. Some have gone for lunch and returned... They must have had many questions for you." "Huh? How long has it been?" "It is mid afternoon now. We have concluded all other business. But I will convene the Speakers. It is great that there has been such a good decision."

Fruit and tea are offered, Oswen distracted by everything she's been forced to confront. She has hope at least... And Sholeh indeed proclaims that the Dawn Incarnates have decided we are authentic, "people with spirit and with integrity", and so-on. It's a rather glowing review and Oswen can't speak for the others but it almost makes her uncomfortable to hear the various positive descriptions of our group and she finds herself blushing and shifting in her seat, fidgeting awkwardly.

She concludes: "We welcome Oswen, Bel, Inafina and Kindle to the Citadel. They are marked now with the Incarnates approval."

Oswen whispers to Sholeh - "do we - do we bow or something? What do we do?!" "Drink tea or some such equivalent thing with each of the speakers! That will be the last of the formalities. Welcome to the Radiant Citadel! You are free to choose a place if you wish to stay. If not, we will always provide a roof over your heads when you are here. The people of the Citadel will recognise you as their own. Just as you will be able to tell those who are of here."

And so we have (a lot of) tea. When it comes to the amber scorpion, Oswen is curious. She asks, trying to be sensitive, about what happened. The world was **Senza**. There was a confederacy of city-states, once considered the most learned of all; academies ran, reached out to other planes and nations, teaching them. Their version of science, art and philosophy; magic, mathematics and alchemy. They were, then, also a source of great power. Magic and the weave there could be turned into physical creations, used to power amazing artefacts like a fire might be used to "power" boiling of water. And they were invaded. It happened with subtlety - an invasion from within and pressure from without, calculated and patient. Without their will and without even their full awareness, the whole world was slowly being taken over by a new power, which had managed to slowly elevate itself in a manner akin to a powerful religion - an authoritarianism which could not be questioned, up against a society that used logic and discussion. When they did try to fight, they were rounded up and murdered. The best and the brightest taken down; the resistance was obliterated. All this for the resources of the planet.

"We don't want to name these people, because these old wounds cannot ever be allowed to heal while we pursue revenge. If we wanted to, we could try and strike back again; but to do so would be to risk the lives of everyone in the cities. We would be declaring war."

In the end the world itself was extracted to the point where it was destroyed physically. So even a war, a victory against the invaders, would bring war to many planes; they've spread far and wide. And they have to coexist with these people now.

Apparently there is just a peninsula left, hidden in the Ethereal. "I should like to visit one day, if were permitted." "It is beautiful, but only a shadow of what it was."

In time, all the tea is drunk. Karem has been waiting patiently, talking to various people. And we emerge; "A very successful day" says Avyrn.

As for "the mark"? If we ask ourselves whether or not we have a connection, a belonging with someone else? We see a strange glow on the forehead, a glyph that shows briefly. Not always in the same place for everyone. But it's there and we have it too. And in the end:

* Kindle has it on a tusk
* Inafina on the tip of an ear
* Bel has it on his palm
* Oswen the back of her preferred-staff-holding (left) hand

It seems we have done all we need to do now, and Karem doesn't need to stay with us - he can go to Oliver. One last thing he points us at is the **Shield Bearers** and **Claviger Academy** is (the latter - the people who maintain and pilot the jewels and serve as ambassadors to other worlds). There's also the **Office Of The Citadel**, where you go if you need anything - an administrative office. If looking for housing, say. People go to ask for financial assistance, too.

Karem will go and find Oliver. We might meet them tonight; we decide we'll stay at the same hotel.

* Palace for people from Toril
* House of Convalescence to see if anyone is ill or sick that we might be looking for
* Court of Whispers for - well, *answers* hopefully about whatever we ask - notably the Eye
* Shield Bearers - they've been more active since Toril fell so might have a perspective on everything

We head out. There's a moment of privacy; Oswen says, "Is it just me? I think I need a minute after that... What did everyone else hear?"

We all got different questions, and were each focused on by different Dawn Incarnates. But the tiger, carp and pear tree all feature heavily. But when Bel asks, "What did you give?", Oswen is startled.

* Bel offered to find items of cultural significance and *gave* them his magical Bandore as that's significant to him (at least, he has pledged it to them, once he no longer needs it in our current quest).
* Kindle offered to help use his skills in the hospital, should they be needed.
* Inafina says she thought all she had to offer was her physical skill, so she would help people move quickly if they needed to, or defend them. Or to listen, as a fast-moving scout.

And Oswen... Wasn't asked that. "Well this is awkward... Maybe something I said was counted as offering, but I don't know what or why it was less clear for me specifically." Her best guess is that it was related to all the pointed questions about what she would do if they needed to be defended.

Well, onward to the Court of Whispers. A shadey alleyway of sorts leads through an entrance, after a large courtyard, to a building with "Court of Whispers" on a sign. But in fact this is just a gate - like big city walls that have liveable spaces within and, inside, it's a maze! Interior and exterior hallways, some exterior ones covered, others alongside buildings with it cantilevered out to form an awning by the first floor hanging over the ground level.

It takes some time, working our way towards the middle, feeling like there must be _something_ significant there - well, there's certainly a very large courtyard with many wide, umbrella-arching flowering trees - pink and yellow flowers, pendulous - fan palms and fig trees too. Various widely-separated benches are used by people having conversations, tea, playing chess and more.

We muse about what questions we might ask - where is the eye / how can we find the eye; is there a pattern to the worlds Vecna takes; that kind of thing? Are there more personal questions? But we don't know where to start. Oswen with Inafina's help, perception 19, we notice one person that seems to be helping others and clearing tables. They work here. So we approach them.

* We heard that there are amazing performances here...
* ...and we have questions that are hard to answer anywhere else, but where do we start?

We *do* need to *trade* for information. The most common exchange is material goods. But other information, or coin, sometimes is traded too. An outer courtyard has people from Toril who may be looking for more - a courtyard of old chestnuts. We then do our best to answer questions about who might know about the eye; since we say that it tends to be held by people hungry for power - tyrants perhaps. We are directed down a hall - first left, second right, through an archway with jacaranda flowers and we will be in Nightshade Court. Reliably a place "where these things may be discussed" - and rooms, especially the teahouse off the court, would have highest chances of some indications. We ask if we should be cautious; well, we are told, it always pays to be cautious; not to shout one's business from the rooftops!

Well, it's a more... Interesting area. Some curious businesses, some of which might be fronts - a massage parlour which seems to be just used for clandestine meetings. Except it's not really all that clandestine! Even Kindle comments on it. "It's so obvious what you're doing if you're here at all. So why try and hide it?"

True. But maybe that's the point!

Four businesses come off the main courtyard itself once we're in it. There's the tearoom, with various hanging screens for 'privacy'. In one business, two people are making carvings at workshop tables. We suspect quiet conversations amongst those who seem otherwise preoccupied. A third place looks like a library, or at least some kind of repository of documents. The fourth is a business that's outdoors, just a stall on the edge of the courtyard that sells banana-leaf wrapped bundles of food. And there are various rooms.

*That* vendor - maybe they see and hear more than they ought to.

We head over. It's a Bullywog, forest-green colour. They hold a fan trying to keep cool. "Warm day! Strange, with no sun! But it's warm for sure! Cold drink?" "Yes, certainly please." A big urn is opened, and cold drinks are spooned out, 1cp each. The banana leaf things are fragrant rice with different fillings, like meat or sweet coconut. One even has fermented prawn with chilli. 2cp each.

We ask about a few things but we're asked in return if we have any idea where this object is; or at least where it isn't! We don't. So we excuse ourselves for a few minutes and Oswen wanders over the shrine and says, "Well, you know the drill..." and starts to set up for Divination. Inafina is listening out for things... Nat 20->27. A donation box! Big piles of offerings behind. We 5gp in the pot. And then Divination starts.

She thinks of Gond this time. "As you probably know, we seek the Eye of Vecna. Are you able to give us any idea of its location?"

Smoke billows out. A familiar presence; a shape forms and a hand comes out - "Hazelnut?" - "thank you!" - it withdraws and there is a munching sound. "Yes. Interesting. Not something I can see! It has been hidden deliberately... Hidden from plane sight, inscrutable to magic. So it is hiding *in* plain sight, I think! But this I *do* know. It is not in the inner planes, the outer planes or the Outlands. It is somewhere on a material plane. But if it were on any of the major worlds, we would have heard by now surely. Ergo! A "minor" plane, a small plane. Perhaps even a sub-plane. I'm afraid I know no more." The divination ends (but just in case he can hear, Oswen thanks him).

So now we can't tell the vendor where the Eye is, but we can tell him where we think it isn't. The vendor has made ten meat-on-sticks and we get to pick. We have one each. 2sp per item. Well, call it a gold!

We tell the vendor where we think our object is probably *not*. OK then - we are directed to the teahouse, to find someone where who is a member of the **Manivarshan**. Just ask for that.

The teahouse has a nice breeze blowing through, apparently by nature of its design. Cloth screens are put down in places, gauze-like but translucent enough to not see through. And they have little bells on the bottom. They ring in the breeze, obscuring conversation while giving a rather ethereal, calm feeling. Someone is walking around with a tray, wearing a beautiful, intricate headdress. "Good afternoon". "Hello! We were hoping for some tea - and uuh - a member of the Manivarshan?" (So awkward!)

She goes to check if "he" is free - and he is; "he is looking for company, in fact!"

We order tea for him and ourselves and are taken to a side area, screened off, the curtains are parted and we realise we need to sort of duck or kneel down and crawl. A middle-aged man wearing an open shirt is sat at a table surrounded by cushions. The linen shirt has a plain colour, but there is embroidery on the cuffs. He too wears a headdress, but it is more plain. He's very hairy! Dark black long main hair, moustache, beard, bushy black eyebrows - it almost all merges into one!

He smiles. "Please, take a seat. It has been a dull afternoon!"

"Thank you and sorry to hear that."

"Not always a bad thing. You may call me **Burron**" - and we introduce ourselves in turn.

The "Manivarshan" title means that he's from Manivarsha. But he's called _the_ Manivarshan "because of what I do." "Information?" "Yes. I collect interesting information. But unlike the others who run information, I am loyal to Manivarsha - I am and always will be someone who keeps Manivarsha first in his heart."

We get into it. We describe our side. He describes the Eye, which he knows under a different name - many names in fact - and it is a subject of interest. We are not the first. Well, we aren't too surprised, but at least we have confirmation. And of course if he knew where it was with any precision, others would've already found it. But he says he does have *relevant* information. If we can ask the right questions he can give us that information.

First question. "Are we being observed, magically or otherwise?" - No. That's why this area is special. Resonance of the crystal, or some such, interferes. Inafina insight 13, not sure. Oswen, Arcana 23. Could just try it - except she doesn't have that spell right now. We'll go on trust.

Just because it's magically hidden doesn't mean it is unused. Is some creature using it, or is it stowed away somewhere?

"I will give you this much. It is *currently* being used, but not as intended."

"A mechanism - of some sort?"

"It is... Active. And the only reason anyone could possibly know where it is, is because of its effects. But it's not being used..." - he tails off. Then, "I assume if you are asking about this artefact you know it is intended to be used." "You have to replace your own eye." "Yes. What I'm saying is - that is not how it is being used currently."

"You say 'currently'; how recent is your information?"

"Current as far as my knowledge goes as we speak. That is all I can answer for that question."

"Do you know what they eye's 'usual effects' are?" The answer isn't clear, but we get the impression that those "usual effects" would usually mean - what you get when attune to it, and that means it's in your eye socket.

"So is it being used to - do you know - power... Something else?"

"We need to have a discussion about any further conversation." "Payment?" "Yes. You have very much exhausted your free questions!" The TL;DR is that he must be given an item. And it must be magic. In the end, **Oswen gives up the green chromatic rose**.

Three questions.

* Who is using the eye?

  - I don't believe *anyone* is using the eye; I believe the eye is influencing things. And I say this because of the effects the eye has. It corrupts. It sews mistrust and spreads evil. We know this. You know this. Now, there are possibilities involved. Nothing is certain... But nobody is using it, I believe; or if they are, they are being *very* careful. Allowing it to exert its influence. It changes and alters its surroundings. And that is why I can give you any steer at all.

* So - any guesses about planes "exhibiting" degraded behaviour or corruption?

  - He says we only have two questions left, so he can only give us two places! "But I like this game. So I will tell you the *three* places where I suspect it is. Otherwise, we can't play!"

  - The first option: A lot of stories seem to point to **Lambaklouha**, an ancient sacred island. You can get to it with a bit of help; there are people here who are from **Dayawlongon**, the plane. It is an archipelago, all that is left. They go back and tend to what is left of their world. But there are tales - very recent, within the last few months - of a disturbance involving a long-forgotten (and they had thought, long-dead) guardian of their land living on Lambaklouha. An ancient **Bakunawa** - an embodiment of... Hmm... I suppose - an early conception of a dragon of sorts, but a spirit. It lives in rivers, in water, a spirit of life-giving, of conception.

  - Next: People who live in the "shadow of the sun". An interesting one... There is a disturbance, a big one, happening over there. The **Silent Roar** and the **Rose of the Twilight** are involved. If you stick your nose into *this* then you are definitely putting yourself into danger! You will know this land... I can see you are Accepted - recently Accepted - so you will have met an exile from **Akharin Sangar**. She who was exiled, ever since the Archangel **Atash** took control; saved it, saved the plane, really; *Shoreh* has lived in exile here.

  - Finally: "The last is very close to my heart. The last place I believe - and I hope I am not letting my prejudices colour my view... The **Mists of Manivarsha**, where I believe an ancient corruption has returned. It could be; or it could be something else. These are the three.

There are merits and doubts in each case. We might, for example, ask in Akharin Sangar if it were even possible for such a powerful and evil artefact to be manifesting its influence on a nation ruled by an Archangel. But it is an item of tyrants. There are few creatures who fit that description more than an Archangel. "So *now* your prejudices are showing!" says Oswen. "Well have you *met* an Archangel?! They are _immoveable_. A being created of pure righteousness, who absolutely believe in their very nature that they are incorruptible. That they embody everything that is true and good. How could that lead to anything _but_ tyranny?"

And then there's the Bakunawa, an ancient protector of their people. But the archipelago has long been in decline - destroyed and corrupted by invaders originally, all but withered and died out, so much so that those ancient protectors were believed to be dead. "Yet suddenly one rises" says Oswen - "Yes." And there are reports of it attacking settlements of people it had sworn (but failed) to protect.

"And what of your home? These mists?" The mists hide an ancient civilisation. They mastered architecture, construction, the arts, agriculture, seafaring; they prize athleticism and order. Courage and showmanship. These sorts of things. Power is a pure fire, forgiveness are the deep waters. A land of contrasts and contradictions and complexity. "In our ancient history there has been imbalance. It has taken the civilisation of **Sagarpoor**, where I am from, centuries to harness and balance its environment, where we all live in harmony with the Raging River that flows through - a mighty river, flowing through - the uncontrollable monsoons - we tamed it all. But in the last season it all unravelled. The river rose to destroy again. The only memory we have of it doing that is from centuries prior, only as song, a cautionary tale. *Something* is destroying the balance that was so hard-won. But I cannot see the forest for the trees! So I present Manivarsha for free, as the third."

"Do we have a third question?"

"Yes"

"If you could have any food or drink from this place, what would you like most right now?"

"Hmm. It would be... For a sweet tea, that is enriched by the honey of the frangipani flower that grows in the gardens of Sagarpoor. But you will find no such tea here, for all the trees of the flowering frangipani lie dormant. It is not their season. Which is why I crave it even more! It always makes it taste ever more sweet when the season does come around."

"If I were honest, I think my gut leans to starting with that Archangel. A tempting target for Vecna."

"I urge you speak to Shoreh - she" - but Oswen holds up her hand.

"However, in our travels, we've often decided to do something taht feels right, even if it might not necessarily feel like the most on-target course of action, if you catch my drift. And the universe seems to in general appreciate that! I don't have a religion, but if I did it might be founded in such a thing."

"Serendipity?"

"Yes! Well, with that in mind, I think we start with the Mists."

"Oh! Well, your timing could not be better! For they celebrate the Great Games in four days time - and that is the best time to visit Sagarpoor."

"I assume you know a good way to get there?"

"The Conchord Jewels can take you there directly. I can arrange passage for you. Would you like that to be your third question?"

"You mean, how do we get there?"

"Yes!"

"If you wish, scratch the food and drink!"

"A distinct pleasure doing business with you."

"Likewise. Whatever we find, if we are able, we will come back here to let you know." 

"I will continue to keep my finger on the web to sense what flies might come through! In my line of work it is best not to underestimate or overlook even the smallest tremor."

We finish our tea and head away. We have been told where to go for travel; we can leave at any time. The Conchord Jewels are operated by the Clavigers. Since we are people of the Citadel, travelling to one of the 15 planes, the Clavigers will organise it.

We head away and Oswen sends a "group chat".

**"Vecna Eye on Dayawlongon, Akharin Sangar or Manivarsha. Investigating Manivarsha first. Many Toril refugees at Radiant Citadel. Some had prior evacuation plans; helped them enormously."**

No answer, but that's no surprise. People are *busy*.

Our attention turns to Bel. He thinks it is time to give over his Bandalore. We will miss it. But he says, "I think I have outgrown it. This way, it won't sit unused. It will be the pride and joy for someone else, just as it was for me." So - what can we do to help? "I have to find the Hall of Harmonies!" Let's head back to the middle - ask for directions. We find the same person as before, and are told it's a bit early; but we can "get settled in". Bel says he'd promised his instrument, which changes things a bit. "A princely gift to the city! It is no wonder you were accepted by the Dawn Incarnates; you are one with a generous heart."

We are led to an archway and directed down an alley - straight down until you can go no further. "It is the largest structure in the court."

At the alley's end is a three-tier structure, a sort of open air amphitheatre in the middle, constructed it seems to maximise acoustic performance. Strange curving part-domes that almost look like armour or scales curve up around the sides; maybe 'petals' is a better description. Anyway, there's a stage with a lot of equipment but nobody there yet and lots of seating around. It looks impressive but seems casual, rather than a formal concert hall.

We wonder what to do next, right as someone pops their head out from the wings behind the stage. "You're very early!" they call. Bel explains why we are here. "There is an instrument section or something...?" "You're looking for the Quartermaster?" - and we are directed to a side-corridor. It leads to a very large room with a great array of stands and equipment, all instruments on display. A woman there is walking with a feather duster, wiping and polishing with linseed oil, checking drums... As we enter she looks up briefly, says, "Evening!" and then goes back to her busy tasks. "Um - are you the Quartermaster?" asks Bel. "Were you expecting someone else?!"

Great start.

He's strangely uncomfortable and awkward. He lacks his usual eloquence. He's trying to give this instrument away; it means a lot to him. Inafina tries to help out, explaining about being Accepted recently and Bel agreeing to gift this to the city.

"Well that's unusual - I mean, I don't mean unusual - that is - " she walks up "- this is a fine instrument. I mean a *fine* instrument. I won't play it, test it, because if it is what I think it is, I don't want the... Consequences...!"

Bel agrees. "Yes, you need to know what you're doing with it..."

"Wow. Well. That's quite something. This is one I don't have. Come in... Look. I hope you don't find this creepy? But I have a stand - I know about these instruments you see - a stand that has been empty because nobody has ever brought one of these in." And she puts it there; it even has the correct label, "Fochlucan Bandore". Then, after offering the rest of us tea, she sits with a notebook and starts asking Bel all about the instrument. It's almost like an interview! She wants the lineage.

Oswen checks. "But it - it *will* end up being used by someone, won't it? I think - I don't want to speak for Bel, but I think - he hoped it to be used, and loved, as he has used and loved it."

"Oh it *absolutely* will be used! This is not a museum. These instruments are used by the Citadel. Any of the orchestras or groups who play here are welcome to use these instruments. Sometimes, they go out on extended loan. Like... There are even some pieces here which have a rich tradition of history to the Citadel itself" - and points to some guitars made by Guierrmo. "As you might imagine, almost everyone tries their hand at playing them, but most move to different instruments! It is difficult to pick up and play one of his guitars when *he is in the audience* unless you are very confident and skilled."

Bel nods. "We just met him last night."

She asks - "So what are you going to do for an instrument now? Do you want to look at something now? Something that suits the direction you are going in?"

"How does that work?"

(The three of us nod enthusiastically at Bel!)

"You're clearly a proficient musician. What are you familiar with?"

He lists things he can do, preferences, specialities. It's quite broad. Eventually the Quartermaster (**Rani**) outright asks if he wants to try one of Guierrmo's guitars. "I - I guess? OK - I mean - sure! Sure, why not?!"

There are two in particular she thinks are of interest. And of those one stands out easily. A mandolin made of a rich orange-brown wood, with a tight grain and a lot of ornamental decoration. The whole thing is very beautiful, thinks Bel. "Give it a go!" she says. "That one, you do need a certain... Proficiency. But you - I think you might be alright! I do warn people not of the - art - to not touch it. Could cause quite a headache. Not just for those of us listening".

Bel plays. The sound is distinct. It certainly reminds us of Guierrmo. A virtuoso feel. Bel leans into that, and starts speeding up. Occasionally he stumbles, but he seems to get lost in it. Seems quite taken.

Rani says, "It seems like a fair trade. Does it call to you? We have some interesting drums too... Forgive me if I get this wrong, but I feel like your understanding of drums might match these" - she gestures - "but you aren't aware of the percussion instruments of..." and names a few planes we've never heard of. There's a whole other section of percussion. One looks like a xylophone but instead of different sized bars there are different sized drums, all on a rack. Rani demonstrates various things and seems proficient in them *all* somehow! A fair number of them are worn on straps and swung under the arm into position to be played. Others are held in one hand and tapped with another, almost like a tambourine.

Bel is torn. He just can't decide. The three of the rest of us exchange glances. Eventually Inafina opines, "you know, the drums are amazing, but you do have a drum. That guitar - we even know the person who made it..."

Whatever he takes it is on loan, in exchange for his gift, but the loan is - well, indefinite. And it gives us an excuse to come back here. Oswen is *not* mad about that. Not at all.

Paperwork is arranged and signed. There's even a carry case. It sits across his shoulder and can be reached very quickly.

Rani must go now - a performance starts soon. We want to stick around to watch it. Go to the drinks stand, "tell them that I sent you, the drinks are on me!" - and she dashes off!

Bel is in his own world, fascinated at this new guitar. We find some seats. Bel, Inafina, Kindle then Oswen. And just before the performance starts, Oswen hands Kindle a scroll case.

"What - do you want me to put this in the bag?"

"Have a look inside."

He is confused and Oswen chuckles. He pulls out the scroll. "Wow! This is very beautiful! Where did you find this?" "It's from here. It's not magical. Remember I went to that shop?"

He unfurls it and reads, and doesn't immediately react; blinks a couple of times, then very carefully closes the scroll and puts it back in the case, sits for a moment, then looks to Oswen and smiles. "I don't know when you did that... But... It's a beautiful gift... Um... I really - I really appreciate it, thank you. That would be - I - I know exactly where I want to hang it. But I'm afraid if I tell you - I'm afraid to tell you."

"Then keep it a secret."

"I hope we will get to hang it there."

He leans over and gives her a kiss on the temple. She says, "Least I could do." Oswen knows Kindle doesn't convey much emotion usually; this is perhaps the most emotional she's seen him - at least in terms of what he conveys. He's very steady. The rock for the group.

Lots of performers assemble on stage, with a conductor coordinating. Eventually they all come together in a huge ensemble - our party hasn't seen an orchestra before, but this is effectively what it *becomes* but after various groups or even solos worked independently - and dancers then arrive, adding visual flair. It's not a stuffy event either; people start dancing in the aisles, along with an area a distance in front of the stage where people have more room to dance.

There's an intermission when we get some snacks and food; then even more. It's amazing. At times we mingle; we speak to another group from Toril. They were visually very recognisable; Sword Coast dress. This place - it has nobility of course, but nothing is gated off. Anyone can walk from top to bottom of this crystal, into any court, freely.

Conflicted; do we just like this place because it feels safe? It doesn't have that same constant pressure and undertone of the Outlands or whatever? Maybe. But right now - this is just **fun** and Oswen leans into that, after overthinking for a while.

Eventually, Bel's stomach gets the better of him. We head away, performances still going, new people arriving; Oswen can't help but think - "This *could* be enough. Could I be happy here? Would this be all I need?" - but what of Leonidas' needs? How can she introduce him to all this? How can they find a common understanding? He is missing out on *so* much. **He cannot and must not be railroaded into things he doesn't want. But she can't pretend she hasn't seen all these amazing things. She can't pretend this all hasn't had an impact on her.**

Bel leads us to an unusual restaurant. Big ovens with smoke-cooked goods of various kinds. It's all served with unusual sauces and crispy breads. It's great.

Kindle talks to Oswen about where her head is at. He mentions the old cottage. Building a home. That's grounding - she'd almost forgotten! The simpler things; yes. Those are good.

Later, with food mostly finished but just taking our time, Oswen raises a question. We're always worrying about Vecna invading here or there or wherever. Well, we're deep in this mess whether we want to be or not. So how can we get Vecna to notice *us* - to interfere with *him*, so he's forced to direct resources or even himself to deal with whatever we've messed up now! Slow him down. Annoy him. Yes, that would be dangerous. Might even be lethal. But isn't that a good way to worry less about him invading another plane? If we're going to "help save all worlds", let's do it properly!

We agree on the danger. We agree on the idea. We will ask the Eight. Or Five. Or whatever they are.

Tomorrow we must find the Clavigers. Ask them to take us to the Mists of Manivarsha. Or as close as they can. And then? Yet another strange new world.

We turn in for the night. Orvil, who has been unusually quiet these last few days, offers to take watch all night.

(End of Part 2.13)
