# Oswen: Part 2.25
## Campaign Day 56
### Unknown of time of day, Anauroch desert, Toril

Wind! It's windy, but a hot wind. Oswen stumbles; we're on the slope of a dune, sinking into the sand. Bright sun beats down. It's hard to see for a minute, not helped by wind being blow into your eyes too.

"This way!" calls Kindle. "The other side!" and starts climbing. "We're going *up?!*" exclaims Bel - his hooves are not great on sand at all. Eventually we reach the shelter of the other side of the dune. Oswen pops in Orvil.

"What? Where are we? Why was I away so long? That's not fair. What's going on?!"

Oswen has to apologise and explain. She asks if he can fly OK in this wind and bright sun. He looks around and flies up - DEX check nat 20 + 3! He's a natural, spiralling up on thermals and defying the gusts of wind. Owsen looks "through" him. Where *are* we? It doesn't help. Desert everywhere! "What exactly am I looking for?" he asks. He'll have to fly out of range; Oswen explains - mountains, possibly ruins in the foothills.

The mountains are easy. A long chain, curving. He can't see any more than that with the wind and sand. So, we set up the carpet. In some respects it's the carpet's natural environment! Once we get high enough, it's windy but not sandy and things get a lot easier, though it's *really* hot. The decanter of endless water is put to good use immediately.

It takes an hour before we're even really all that close to the foothills. And it's *hot*. CON saves, at least with ADV thanks to the decanter and clothing.

Kindle is just about OK, but it's not the best day be in plate armour, mithril or otherwise!

We start trying to look for signs of any ruins. Inafina, flat perception 19+9->28! She spots ruins near a big escarpment at the base of one of the mountains. We head in directly. It only takes a few minutes to reach the escarpment and once there, although it's very weathered, we realise it looks like it's been excavated or quarried. The shapes of the tops of remnants of buildings, mostly submerged in sand, are visible around us.

"So how in the world do we find this time gate?" asks Bel.

"Alustriel said that the 'tear' that we call a gate can be detected by the presence of **Phaerimm** - she said they're some strange sort of huge flat worms with four arms around their *mouths*, and they can kind of fly; they feed on magic, so they might go for us because we're magical. She said they're highly intelligent - they even have a society! - they were the arch nemesis of the Netherese empire."

Bel says unprintable things about finding *them* as the way to find the gate.

"She said I might be able to sense eldritch eddies; the shadow effects, echoes, of the extreme and indiscriminate magic by the Netherese mage experimenters. They pushed the boundaries of safe magic use a lot and sometimes the residual effects of what they did combine in sporadic bursts of magical energy. Out-of-control magical effects. They'd be very rare in our time - perhaps non-existent - but close to a time gate, one of these tears in reality, they might be seen on our side too."

That's not exactly helpful, but Oswen has some ideas about Conch - if the gate is on the ground, then experimentation was on the ground too and not on a flying city. We set down in a sheltered spot tucked up against the escarpment so Oswen can check Alustriel's book.

* Conch existed initially because it was along a river. The 'low' class always held onto their roots - before they became the Netherese, they were a collection of tribes of small fishing villages along the river and near the sea. River folk.

* Conch was a trade city, then, but very wealthy comparatively. The mines for gems, spell materials and a magical mineral were found here. It was essential to high-level arcane practice and the maintenance of the flying cities.

* This is why the permanent portals were created to transport material from the mining companies up to the flying cities.

Maybe then putting experimentation closer to the source of the materials made sense? And it might mean that anything dangerous could be "contained" by the mass of the mountain around it. So instead of big building, like a university or something, perhaps we need a way into the mines. But Inafina, who's been listening to Oswen recount all this while Bel and Kindle stretch their legs, asks if perhaps it was just the overuse of magic that caused the tear; it might not have been an experiment awry that caused the tear. But on the other hand, at least we might have another way up to the city - go with the mine shipments (assuming they are actually manned, rather than just crates of materials being sent).

Maybe, then, it's not buildings we want; it could be the mine. It maybe makes more sense to have ground-level experiments only happening because they're near a source of raw material and being encased in a mountain might make for a safer outcome if things go wrong. Any ground-level entrance is buried deep, but maybe there are tunnels higher up, whether natural or otherwise. Orvil flies up the escarpment, trying to spot anything; perception 17+6->23; he notices eddy currents in the winds near the base that suggest *something* in a particular direction so he flies back, lets us know and since it's close to the ground we just walk. It's only 150-200ft or so.

We approach the crumbled rock at the base of the escarpment. What Orvil found seems to be some kind of hole/shaft, but it's probably been dug by something. Oswen gets a bit closer, noting what seems to be a huge nest with eggs! She tries the Wand of Secrets and unfortunately, it indicates - the nest. Orvil flies up and looks down at the nest; it seems an *insect* nest, but with *very* big eggs.

Orvil gently lands, feeling nervous! He looks closely. Perception 15. The nest is built *over* something. He also looks nervously at the hole a short distance away and communicates to Oswen that maybe something might come out of - ...

Initiative!

...well, no, wrong, nothing came out of the hole; but two giant scorpions burst up out from under the sand. It seems Orvil's light landing was enough to disturb them.

Inafina runs to the Southernward one and tries to hit with the staff. It glances off, but she gets the measure of the creature and tries again. Crit! With one charge, 2d8 + 2d10 + 6, the electrical effects seemed very effective and she gets more confident. She also uses Stunning Strike and that, too, works. Then she kicks hard with her right foot, pushing away a nearby giant claw, for 12 more damage. She stays where she is, but *really* doesn't like the look of the huge scorpion stinger!

Suddenly, out of the hole in the ground, appears a strange sort of purple whirlwind. It's like a maelstrom of crackling force. Oswen ARC only 17, so she's not *sure* what it is, but it certainly *looks* like raw magic energy. That might be one of the 'eddies' that we were looking out for. She shouts out, "Don't let it touch you! I think that would be Bad!" but it moves straight towards the group... In fact, more specifically, Oswen thinks it might be drawn towards *her*. Suddenly a blast of energy lances out from it towards her. Bel reacts, casting Silvery Barbs, hoping to distract - he doesn't know what it is, but it's acting like a creature and he reasons it might work the same way - but it's no good; the beam strikes her square in the chest, pushing her back with a strange force a little, before she recovers; "Ouch!" (6 damage) - but now it reacts and goes for Bel. Is this thing alive?! It his Bel, who also says "Ouch!" (10 damage). Oswen says "That's - that's very odd, it's acting like it's alive?!"

Kindle starts to act but just as he's starting to move into action, Oswen suddenly calls out, "Guard dog! It might be like a magic guard dog; if we use magic, it comes for us!" - and Kindle decides to test that. He runs towards the second, Northwards giant scorpion, the one which Inafina did not get to and draws his mace. He attacks and hits, doing 23 damage in total (the attack surprising the creature). That doesn't use any magic, but as a bonus action he casts Spiritual Weapon - his rolling pin appears - and he has that attack the scorpion as well. This hits, dealing 10 more damage.

To our surprise, the storm appears to - for want of a better expression - turn to face the scorpion and Kindle now. The crackling edges sort of extend his way, instead of ours. Bel shouts, "No you don't!" as Owen shouts, "That worked!"; Bel runs towards Inafina's scorpion to spread the party out a bit, then casts Starry Wisp across to the one by Kindle. It hits for 20 damage and that is enough! The creature falls and *now* the eddy "turns" towards Bel.

Orvil tries to drag the nest aside a bit. Parts come out in his beak but he's just not strong enough. But there is *definitely* something under there (so Oswen knows that now too).

Oswen tries to apply her knowledge. ARC 27... This thing is a Construct (but she's pretty sure not *constructed*), from residual bits of magic. An accidental thing. It's kind of pure magic. Spellfire. It must be very resistant to magic and many kinds of magical damage. It's sensing rather than seeing magic. It's like magnetism, it's drawn that way. It seems a bit unstable, but she wonders if throwing magic into it might empower it rather than destabilise it. Instead she goes for distraction. She throws a chromatic orb L2 cold in a direction to lead people away then starts to run for the nest.

Unfortunately the eddy doesn't react to where the orb lands. She surmises it's interested in the caster, not the destination. And she doesn't realise it's able to react and "swipe" at her as she runs past, and gets a little close; she sees it "reaching out" and crackling in her direction, but she rolls in the sand and dodges it.

Inafina hits once with the staff and one charge; low damage, only 10. Next is another crit, but also quite low main damage; another charge though, for 19 total. That kills the scorpion. "Can I hit *that?*" she shouts, pointing at the eddy; "No!" says Oswen; so she runs to the nest and helps Orvil push it aside. It's a trap door! This nest is a very deliberate attempt to hide this entrance. And it's surely not ancient; it's not buried in sand, the nest isn't that old; she shouts, "It's a trap door but something's not right!"

The eddy focuses back on Kindle. Lightning and fire lash out, but Kindle's new armour and his agility seems to help deflect both. Kindle moves to try and attack in turn. He hits decisively with the mace, bringing in a divine strike too, which would be 7 damage; the stability *does* flicker and it's as if a small part of its mass was shed, but it seems to react immediately and a strange sort of force wall emanates out, like a kind of 'arcane shove'. STR save 21; he's leaning in and slipping in the sand, shield up; no damage and not knocked over. Kindle pushes on - the spiritual weapon hits, dealing 9 magical force damage and *that* doesn't have as much effect (4 damage taken).

"So what do we do?!" asks Kindle.

"Well I was thinking of going down that trapdoor!" shouts Oswen.

"Won't it follow us?"

"Probably!"

Bel runs up to the trapdoor and flings it open while shouting, "Not your *best* plan, Oswen" - and then tries a Starry Wisp. Maybe it'll do *some* damage. It's radiant. That actually seems to work! So Oswen thinks, well, OK, *certain* damage types work and others don't.

Orvil looks into the trapdoor. "I'm not going in *there*, I can't see anything!" and flies up. Oswen thinks about damage types; just about anything from Chromatic Orb is either damage *it* dealt (thunder similar to force) or needs a sort-of-living target (e.g. poison), but there *is* cold damage. So she throws a L1 Chromatic Orb for cold; it hits, 3d8->only 12 damage but it does all seem to be taken. She calls, "Wow, cold works!"

So Inafina runs up and tries hitting with the staff as well. It works; she gets a couple of staff hits, but the damage isn't too great - 8 and 10 - but now we can all see that it's shrinking. She wonders what it'd be like to hit it! She'll use her feet, since those are in boots, and tries flurry of blows. It's weird to kick it, and seems almost impossible to actually miss, and she does not get hurt in the attempt. The first two kicks are a bit weak just in case - d10+6 -> 9, and another 9 - the last is very solid though, a max 16. The eddy is about half the size it was. "It think we can take this down!" she says and backs away a bit, in case that force pulse thing happens again.

The eddy closes the gap. A swipe similar to that which Oswen saw is aimed at Inafina. The first goes wildly out; the next is *very* close but she dodges that, too (attack 18 vs AC 19). Kindle attacks and hits with the mace, but again, low damage; only 8. And again the eddy pulses out! STR saves - Inafina 19 pass, but Kindle fails! He's knocked prone and takes 9 force damage. "Why does it only do that when *you* hit it?" asks Inafina. From the ground, Kindle attacks with the spiritual weapon and that hits, for 11 more damage.

Bel sees that progress is being made and sends another starry wisp - it worked last time! It hits and 20 more damage means it's now visibly thinner as well as smaller. Oswen does likewise, hitting with a chromatic orb for 20 more damage. The fire elements die out completely at this and then, with little crackles of static and some smoke, the whole thing dissipates. She runs over to look at where it *was*. She can still sense some kind of arcane residue; it's sort of *on* the sand. She calls back, "It's possible that another one of these might form any time, so let's get moving!" but as she's saying this she's looking closely at the sand. ARC 24; she recognises *some* kind of structure here, in the sand patterns, the residue and the way it kind of dissipated. Six or seven different spells, maybe, sort of - merged together. But strong, too, the structure, if considered in physical terms, being one of a much more substantial construction. It's as if the spells didn't cast, but got stuck and bound together, but "leaked". Eventually, with all the magic released, it's as if those spells had been cast, energetically speaking. **This thing is drawn to the weave itself**.

From over by the trapdoor, she hears Inafina calling - "Well, so, you said we should go now? You've been there a good two minutes? Are we going?"

Ah, yes. We get to the trapdoor and Inafina warns us; "This is new, relatively. And deliberately hidden. Whatever it is, it's *not* some incredibly well preserved entrance into ancient Netherese territory." Oswen sends down the drift globe and Inafina says "I'll follow it and go first", and steps onto the ladder. But before she goes any further, Kindle calls, "oh, wait one moment!" - and casts a spell to grant us all darkvision - even Orvil. And it has huge range, at some 300ft. Inafina can now see down more clearly and actually asks Oswen to bring the driftglobe back out, as it's too bright to see past. It's a shaft that goes down some 50ft and ends in what looks like cavern floor. "Down I go!" she says.

It's odd; this looks like an entrance to a mine, a building behind her - there's even a door - and a mineshaft going under the escarpment cliff. There's some sand drift and a bit of collapse visible but it seems otherwise dry and stable, with enough space for us, including Kindle. The ceiling is even high enough for him at 8.5-9ft. She signals that it seems safe and everyone descends.

We travel the shaft along a short way and end up in some kind of bigger cavern that looks like a nexus point with several other tunnels leading away. There is what looks like unassembled scaffold, extremely rusty, lying in a pile against one wall along with tiny remnants of wood or cloth here and there. What might once have been collapsed crates, too. It's dry overall and Oswen says, "If this really is Netherese then the preservation is extraordinary - this ought to be at least 2,000 years old! - I guess it only happened because it's so dry."

We're not sure which tunnel to try. Oswen spends a while - since we seem to be in a relatively safe space - ritual-casting Detect Magic, wondering if anything might be bleeding down a tunnel (though chances are *everything* around her has residues given the nature of the mine). In due course, she is surprised to see that there *is* a variation in residue, even on the walls where something seems to have scraped on them - a magical creature or another eddy? - and a middle passage stands out with brighter, stronger indications.

Only about 70ft along that middle passage things widen out and there's a left-right branch (a kind of "Y" shape). Inafina is taking point to check things seem safe, with Oswen coming up after to look at magical aura. *Shards* of magic embedded in the walls. Intriguing! She goes closer. Crystals. It's not like something exploded and got stuck; these seem to be scattered in the rock itself. She describes it to the others, but the crystals are so small that without Detect Magic there's little to see with the naked eye.

But with Detect Magic on? It's like a river of stars! Very beautiful.

She's never seen anything like this before and doesn't recall reading much about there being so much - so much *stuff* under the ground that's magical like this. But now, the larger passages and greater number of crystals make it harder to determine a particular path. And now she thinks that the previous cavern had scrapes that were caused by a *creature* and this creature (or construct) had come through this way (in either direction) and not needed to push its way through as passages are larger.

Inafina tells us to wait and looks down the right passage way a little. It's smaller, with a lower ceiling. Dead end! Mining equipment though, or what's left of it. Oswen takes a look and sees a seam of this crystal here. She wonders if she can get a chunk of the material; but we have no tools. Anything on the ground is far too rotted to be used. Inafina produces a spear - she doesn't use it much - and that's enough to chip off a coin-sized piece.

Now we check out the left branch. It branches again! Inafina PER 19, sees a couple of strange tendrils hanging down from the ceiling and they emit light; in fact, they're almost filaments. She stops and points to Oswen, "What do you make of those? Creatures in their own right or like whiskers on a hidden cat?" - Oswen NAT 12, she's never seen this before. Reminiscent of glow worms but not the same. The light isn't magical. So out of caution, we all agree to try not to brush against any of them. This means we're moving cautiously.

It's getting like a maze now. Branch upon branch. Oswen can't distinguish options magically so we opt for "go deeper" as our main approach, trying to get further from the escarpment face.

Inafina ADV perception (from cautious movement) 1,9+9->18. She hears something from a corridor ahead at yet another junction, but it's a dead end; Oswen gets closer and detects a *strong* magical signature. She whispers a warning to Inafina and tries to move in quietly and get a better view, but suddenly sees something *very* odd. It "phases" in and it's big! Something 7ft long, tapeworm-like; rings of teeth; four arms. She gasps, "It's them! It's the... The Phaerimm" - but she barely gets to finish before it attacks!

The attacking creature can see that Oswen has a spell up and heads for her. This seems to be a common theme! She's hit telepathically with a foreign language; the "tone" is clear enough though - hostility. WIS save 16 - it was attempting Detect Thoughts, violently! She's then hit by something that causes her 6 psychic damage and makes her, essentially, Charmed and retreats a short distance.

Orvil knows Oswen has been charmed so just flies forward to keep it in sight and flies around in tight circles.

Oswen is now fascinated by this creature. It's *very* magical. In fact it might even *live* on magic - feed on it. And it just wants to be friends, so it must want something, so she tries Detect Thoughts; they don't have a common language so maybe it's thinking about what it wants. It's current thoughts are a bit of a jumble. It's a scout. It has detected prey. It must tell the others. They will be feasting tonight.

"Oh that's lovely!" she shouts. "It's going to tell it's friends we're here, and they're going to eat well. Apparently they're having a big feast! Isn't that nice?"

Bel is astonished. "Snap *out* of it! What's wrong with you?" - he uses his mandolin, "So much for being stealthy!" - and there is a strange, discordant series of notes. It's Dispel Magic. Oswen is shaken out of her charmed condition; it's strange, a different kind of charm from one she's encountered before. It wasn't a spell, it was some kind of innate ability that was targeted more like a weapon than a spell. "Oh this thing is really bad news" she calls "and we *must* stop it before it gets away!" - Bel throws Bardic at Inafina too. "'Fina, let's not be dinner!"

"*Really?!*" she shouts back, as she runs in to attack! She hits, with one charge, 21 damage - good result - and that hurts it quite a bit; she attacks again; nat 20! But the damage rolls, despite adding a charge, are terrible and the crit is lower damage than the prior hit. Only 19. She has to hit it once more, unarmed and that does the trick (11 damage). It falls to the ground.

Oswen investigates the remains (INV 31). It wears no clothes, but there are some strange pockets of skin that seem to be used as just that. She finds an Orb of Time - it tells the time of day! "What a curious thing to carry around." But it might make sense if these things travel between planes often.

Seeing the way this scout was fleeing, we check a different branch but Inafina hears the same noises she heard before. Se we figure - we've cleared this little area, at least, so we might as well continue that way. Bel casts Calm Emotions. It'll help us avoid the charm effect, but only for a minute. Kindle follows suit with Twilight Sanctuary too (via Channel Divinity), granting 17 temp HP all round.s

Inafina hurries down a leftward corridor and realises there's a huge cavern beyond. She stops short of the entrance. There's a thrumming noise. The others catch up. Oswen realises Detect Thoughts is still up; she "hears" the strange language she heard before. Two voices, directly ahead. She indicates "two" with her fingers and points into the cavern.

The room is big, maybe 80-90 feet across, with a sloping floor dropping some 20ft and there, in the centre, is a huge tablet, rising out of the ground, covered in arcane writings. There's a rippling of magic and reality stretching across it into empty space on either side. She's about to back away and try to talk to the others - but then she realises *she too* is being detected via thoughts. And now, two much larger Phaerimm appear, some 12ft in length. The mouths are huge! At ~5ft across, they could swallow her whole.

The two arrivals get the jump on us. One starts to cast a spell, and Oswen doesn't want to take chances after last time and she Counterspells. CON 21 save required; it fails and its spell fizzles. There are plenty more where *that* came from, she's sure, but at least that's *something* averted! But now... It teleports! It blinks out and reappears in front of the monolith, as if to block access. She thought that the monolith was probably the gate; it seems that this thing is trying to block access. Before she can think more about it, the second one starts casting what looks like the same spell to her - so it seems she'll find out what it is (Synaptic Static). Crackling of arcane energy appears around Oswen and the rest of the party can *feel* a sort of dread along with electricity - we're all hit by the effect (20ft radius). INT saves all round.

* Inafina 11 + 5 (from Bardic) 16
* Orvil only 5!
* Oswen ADV 29
* Kindle 15
* Bel (using Heroic) 17

Orvil takes 22 damage - he's gone. He survived Velindra Shadowmantle and Arkhan The Cruel, only to be taken down in an instant by these strange creatures.

The second one moves to block the way to the monolith too.

Inafina shouts, "guard your eyes!" and throws her sunburst at both. She knows they might dodge and not be hurt, but it has to be worth the risk; she pushes as much Ki power in as she can. It's a *very* bright detonation. DC 19 CON save. The damage roll is 8d6 at that point, which rolls alright if unspectacular - 31 - good *only* if they fail. But they are very big creatures. Annoyingly, one sees it coming and does dodge. So, 31 damage, but for 3 Ki points and no stun effects or similar. So now, she runs into melee range with the one that took the damage, wind-walking to avoid wasting time on the steep drop to the centre area. She doesn't realise that she might be blocking area effects from the others, because they haven't really done that before; but perhaps that's because she's usually in melee range!

Bel is thus finding it hard to figure out what to do. The cavern geometry makes things hard and Inafina is close to one of the slightly-injured creatures, the two of which are side-by-side. So he plays a rousing melody on his guitar - Protection From Evil & Good - which has to be by touch, so he helps Oswen with it, as well as granting her Bardic Inspiration.

Oswen tries Psychic Lance on the uninjured creature. It tries to counter; ADV CON only 15; + 4 with Bardic -> 19. Her spell goes through. Now *they* need INT 21. Magic resistance; they match the DC and resist. 28->14 damage. Damp squib and a L4 burned to boot. We're going to have to start doing *much* better than this if we're not going to fall here!

Kindle uses Steps Of Night to fly across and attack. His long arms mean he's within reach and he swings his mace, but they dodge.

Another blast of the same spell from before, from the first of these strange creatures - Synaptic Static. Oswen tries to counter again and she's successful; that spell once again fizzles. It's very annoyed at being confounded twice! The other one wants to attack Inafina, Kindle and Oswen - at at once - but requires range, so it teleports back a bit to get distance from Inafina (Mind Warp ray). Critical miss for Inafina; hit for Kindle and disadv for Oswen (thanks to Bel's Protection spell) leads to a miss. 2d8+4 -> 10 psychic damage, but thanks to Calm Emotions he's not Charmed. CON save, ADV thanks to Warcaster, to hold his concentration - he does so.

Inafina crit misses the one that backed away, but then hits, and with two charges on the (getting tired, 3 charges left!) staff gets 27 damage total. With a flurry of blows, she does 41 more. It's looking quite injured now.

Bel only really has magic for things this intimidating, so despite having seen that they seem to have some kind of magic resistance, he has a go with Starry Wisp but it misses. He gives another Bardic to Oswen and then says "So are we trying to split up?!" to which Oswen answers, "Oh! Yes! Good idea!" - and he 'mirthful' (!) jumps down, actually towards the creatures and the monolith, close to Kindle initially, but then runs sideways to get more distance.

Oswen figures - chromatic orb. Well, acid is nasty but should do *something*... She goes for the one that's close to Inafina. CRIT! 12d8 -> **62** damage. It melts! The other one screams angrily. She also summons the Manifest Mind, right next to her.

One left, but it's pretty much uninjured and there are tunnels everywhere - a good chance that more will join in this fight. We need to move quickly.

Kindle tries again with the mace. This time he finds his mark (26) and does 7+strike-7->14 damage and uses his Shadow Touched ability as a Wrathful Smite; WIS save (with ADV tho) which it makes; half damage, 4->2 damage, 16 all up.

The creature tries to consider another Synaptic blast. It can only hit three of us, but goes for it anyway. Counter, ADV CON 21 again for it; 3,4+6->impossibly it once again fails! Now it teleports away, trying to run. Oswen calls, "We *must* stop it!"

Inafina can reach it thanks to her speed, and tries to attack, trying to stun. She hits (13 damage) and *does* manage to stun it. For a moment, it can't move. She hits again for 9 damage then another flurry, all three hitting, for a solid 37 damage. Now she pulls back about 10ft with the rest of her movement. She's wise. We're unlikely to take this creature down before it can get help. She figures the more likely thing is that we'll end up in a dash for the portal.

Bel has other ideas, sure that we must not let it get away. He sees Inafina's stun take effect and takes Leirol's Silver Lance at L4, doing 21 force damage immediately. "Oswen!" he calls. "It's nearly down!"

Oswen runs down the slope (ACRO nat 20) to see past the monolith and Kindle and uses L5 scorching ray - 6 rays, all of which hit with advantage including one crit, for a ridiculous 14d6 (84 max potential) damage, of which she does a decent 49. The creature is destroyed completely.

"Everyone to me!" she shouts "Quickly!" as she runs to where the melted creature was, close to the monolith. Quick INV 21. Dust of Disappearance this time. "There's much more to see here, and much more to discover, but I don't want any more fights. Everyone with me. Join hands."

So we join hands. "I don't know if we just walk through it, but I'll try?" - and she walks towards this strange rift first, the others in a hand-in-hand chain behind. ARC 25 + bardic, 9 -> 34. **This means she's able to time it to what looks to her like the most stable moment in a periodic fluctuation that she's observed.**

We step through, everyone kind of pulled in *with* her. It can't be simultaneous, we were in a chain, yet the others are somehow along with her at the same time. She'd hoped that holding hands might mean they are "one object" and that seems to have worked, yet any not include the ground, indeed the whole plane too?

It's a strange, warping effect, like a corridor, very fast movement, many branches; she tries to use her intuition; and then dark, and then not dark, and the people - voices - "Hey, madam, sorry, it's very dangerous to be here, how did you get in? I'm sorry you can't be here!"

A second or two in order to get bearings.

Arcana apparatus all over the place. Large rods of crystal material are set into the sides of a chamber. Oh! *The same* chamber. The huge tablet is present. It dominates the space. But no rift. The rods are glowing; something is in progress. People around are worried and possibly annoyed by their presence but they're trying to be deferential. It's her robes.

Oswen says, "I understand, I know the intrusion is unwelcome; I just wanted to double-check that everything was in place. Walk me through it!"

"The - the experiment? I - I don't know!"

"Well we're just here to check. Who *does* know?"

They run off, looking a bit freaked out, "I'll get the foreman!"

They've headed away the same way we came in, so we've no choice but to follow. As we do, she realises that strangely, she can *feel* a tether to her own time. She could "will" it and she *thinks* - probably with joined hands - that we could all pull back. And somehow she "feels" like they have ten days of stability. Bel whispers, "...what?!" and Oswen whispers back, "I know, just roll with it!"

There are lots more magical lights here. The crystals are an energy source which seems to be slowly expendable. That must be why they keep mining for more. Not sustainable. Mining baskets full of the stuff sometimes are taken past and, at one point, we pass a room that has racks of them all piled up and some tables with much more polished, chiselled cut gem versions, made into rods.

The person heading out goes a different way to us, heading off on a branch from the one we're interested in - the one we *think* is an exit. The tunnels are the same pretty much but the air quality is very poor and there are a lot of people working, carrying the crystals on baskets strapped to their backs.

Remembering that Inafina had a theory that maybe there was a way to get up to the flying city along with goods deliveries, we start following a rail that came from the monolith room and looks like it might have carts on it, not that we see any. We end up in the first branch room we found. There's an unloading room; carts on strange skids instead of wheels are being loaded up and dragged out. A large person, 7.5" tall, *looks* human but is surely too big! He is writing things down in a book that gives the impression of being some kind of ledger. As we walk through, people part ways. Oswen realises that we're in a good place because people are assuming she in charge and probably that the other three are lower class / assistants.

Inafina is interested in the very large "human". Insight 19+9 -> 28. They look up from the notebook and there's a short nod in Oswen's direction. But for all the surface appearance of deference, there's a flash of disdain and dislike. Inafina clears her throat and hoarse-whispers "Big guy. Doesn't like us. Something going on. Speak to him."

So Oswen heads straight for us. Inafina, still observing, sees him steal himself for the encounter. Now the dislike - almost hatred, annoyance - is even greater. He puts on a smile. "Good day arcanist. Is everything alright?"

Oswen looks to Inafina who gives subtle nod, so Oswen says, "Yes. Things are in excellent order."

"I am pleased to hear that arcanist. Will that be all?"

Oswen says, "Believe it or not, I'm not here to challenge."

"Of course. Neither am I... We... Live to serve the arcanists!"

"Yes but some of us are kind of assholes, right?!"

"I - I wouldn't say - but - wouldn't openly disagree - ... I am certain you are aware that it is not safe for you to be here without Magan -" (sounds like the plural of something) "- would you rather not be in the safety of the imperial Minehold?"

"Can't stand 'em. Came down here wanting to chase the carts to the departure area."

He looks confused.

"Don't worry about it. How about you show me and my three very capable protectors here the path you take to ship all this very valuable material upwards."

*That* does it. The look comes back, sees Inafina. He thinks this is a test.

"Of course."

He whistles and someone on the other side looks up. "What is it, captain Grifud?" "I'm taking the arcanist and the retinue to examine the safety of the transport process to the Minehold. Please ensure there are no accidents in my absence. I shan't be long."

Oswen suddenly has to suppress a yelp of surprise. *We can all understand every word and speak it.* We think we're speaking Common, but she knows we're not. She wonders if either Common had a root here 2000 years ago and it's so unchanged that she hasn't noticed much, or if it's something to do with the time gate magic.

He gives us a look of some scrutiny. He's figuring out *something*. Maybe he knows we shouldn't be here! He explains some of the processes and shows Oswen some of the paperwork. Things are taken to the "tower building". The deposit from the "road of" gems is never mixed with that which is mined from the mine face, "as you know. Only these purest items from the road of gems are sent up."

We end at the long tall shaft we came down, and now this time we go through the door that we saw before. It's daylight outside! This was actually at ground level. She looks back and sees many rickety ladders and shafts; all along the cliff face things are being mined and lowered down in baskets through the sort of shaft that we found in our own time.

Oswen does not understand how that trapdoor and scaffold / ladder we found in "our time" could have been so well preserved.

He keeps explaining things and we realise that "the Magan" are blue-skinned, glowing beings, some 7ft tall, wearing basic clothing - almost monk-like - and they seem to have at least some degree of telekinetic ability. Then we notice two in full armour, stood motionless at the entrance. From context, clearly these are a security measure. "As you can see we have kept them every 30ft in pairs, to make sure nothing happens; we pass escort by escort, no chance of anything being pilfered and it's all sealed in chests anyway..."

...and we are led on between some outbuildings to the edge wall of the rear gate of a quite impressive tower.

"If there are no notes, I would ask my leave to return to my workers in the mine."

"No notes, excellent as expected, thank you for your time."

He seems to hesitate as he's handed her paperwork which she briefly flicked through. She spots that these are magically signed with a small stamp or seal. She realises she has to copy it but do it quickly! But not copy the signature, just the insignia. With Heroic Inspo, INT-based DEC check, 22.

"Have a good day arcanist" - then he walks away.

Well, we're at this tower, with Magan stood here in ornate armour either side of the rear door. "Attention Magan! What would you do if I tried to walk through that door with my retinue here?" says Oswen, wondering if the Magan can speak. They look at her but say nothing. She casts Detect Thoughts. No thoughts whatsoever! She thinks they're likely constructs. ARC 29. She touches one; no reaction; they're corporeal, but they're constructs made of magic in corporeal form. They can understand her eyes. She thinks, as loud as she can, "Look at the three behind me" - no change. She says out loud, "Look at the three behind me" - and they turn to look. PER 13, enough to notice that there's writing on the gate - a sign - and lettering above the gate, carved; she can't read the lettering above. But the *sign* - *that* is in Common. "Keep clear at all times. Punishable by fine" and so-on.

She withdraws out of earshot; after a certain distance the Magan "reset" to looking straight ahead. We need somewhere to talk. She asks Bel if he saw anything that looked like a tavern/inn. Some are service buildings. Administrative. There are long buildings, three storeys, with poles out of some windows where clothes hang - so that's accommodation, probably for mine workers. There *was* some kind of inn but it was small and Bel doesn't really think it might be that interesting, thought it looked... Tidy. He points South-East towards a large, ramshackle collection of buildings that seem constructed almost on top of each other. "THAT might be more interesting!"

OK, we'll try.

It's busy. Quite a few people are going this way, but most give her a wild berth or even scowl at her. "Umm, I think Bel this might be *not* a place for an 'arcanist' to go less noticed!" but we press on. Maybe we'll overhear something. Nobody stops us, but they're not happy we're here. We go in. Conversation stops a moment before resuming, but we're watched.

Nobody else is dressed like us here; more commoners and so-on. She goes to the bar. "Hello! What's on tap?"

A muddled response - but they recover quickly and offer choices. Ales mostly, almost offered apologetically. "Ale's good!" - one is pulled and is slid over. He gives her a number. It's 4. Oswen says, "I'm unfamiliar with the purpose of the number". He looks *very* confused. "Consider it a test!" - he says "Four demos". Hmm, currency. Oswen says, "Ah, of course. We have been travelling and have strange units." She produces a gold, standard something-or-other from Toril. He looks at it puzzled, weighs it, puts it into a box and pulls out six silver-like hexagon coins. "Thank you!" she says.

Bel isn't put off. He goes up to the bar. "I would like one as way!" "Well, yes, will your patron be..." "...I shall cover it!" and then Kindle weighs in, and Inafina too. But they get something from a different cask. He gives a number. "6 Demos on the tab. What name shall I put it under, *madam*?" "Adulare. Zorhanna Adulare."

"Adulare? Elven connections?" "Oh yes. Substantial."

"I apologise! I should not assume of course."

"It's reasonable, given my physical stature!"

We retreat to a table near an empty corner of the room. People are watching closely. As we get close to the corner, one guy looks worried. But we sit at the adjacent table and they relax.

Oswen says "This is going to be difficult, because first, we have to talk in some degree of code, given the walls have ears; and although it seems my standing in society should grant relatively easy access upwards, we don't know any of the ways or rules that govern it. And they're making assumptions; if I get asked too much, I might not have an answer."

It's curious because we're all wearing desert garb. But her robe and spell book make it obvious that she's got magical ability. They must have either detected, or just been assumed to be powerful enough that nobody questioned us being in that apparently quite high-security area of the mine.

"And what's more, I don't know if this is anything like Tasha, or a dream, or *what* this is but we're actually interacting with people. They see us, they react to us, and we're about to drink something. This cannot possibly have no impact on the future. Everything we do is causing ripples. I don't know what that means for the place we left and whether it'll be the same when we return. Anyway. Let's see how 2,000 year old ale tastes!"

It's getting busier. We're told it's dinner time now and given a menu. Oswen says, "Oh, we have this now!" and checks the timepiece. "At least *this* shouldn't be out of place." And it's...



### ...just after 5pm, city of Conch, ancient Netheril

A group of people cheer. Curtains against a wall on one side pull back and there's a stage. Two Megan, but smaller and in colourful clothing appear. One kind of *mimes* but there's a sweet-sounding voice. "Welcome to the House of Wine and Vinegar"... An act is introduced.

"How can it be two *thousand years* and this be one of the most magically advanced societies that has ever existed on Toril to our knowledge, and indeed one of the more magically advanced anywhere given the power of the magical artefacts created, yet it be basically the same?!"

Universal constants. Like Common, for that matter. The sign above the door at the tower was the clue - she says, "Up there, I *think* they might speak Neth -" and stops herself and changes to "- the, um, local dialect and we may have a comprehension issue."

Inafina points out that three of them don't really get spoken to, so they could carry on in Common so long as *she* she speaks Netherese. And for reading, Comprehend Languages.

"I'm so stupid!" says Oswen. "Surely in Sigil *something* exists that we could've bought to help with a language barrier, in a place full of every creature from every world. And here I am, having not thought to bring anything. Very silly. But nobody *else* mentioned it either, in fairness."

We order food and it amounts to a short rest. Bel strikes a bit of a rapport with the barmen. **Jorn** and **Sorfin Arborwind**, elves, married. They like to tell stories. Bel learns that the House of Wine and Vinegar has a large drinking hall, game hall, community centre and is unofficially the *hospital* for all of the commoners. There's a priest with a close gnomish friend, an inventor, who try to fix up people who get injured in the mines and don't charge for it. That's an entire wing of the building.

"Of course, it used to be a whorehouse" says Jorn, off-the-cuff and quite casually! "We just kept the name."

We notice that the tab being run doesn't get questioned; but not because she's an arcanist. Everyone seems to get one. Perhaps these two run a charity of sorts, as well.

As we rest, Bel decides to join in on the stage! His song helps reinvigorate our inspiration for the time ahead.

Apropos nothing, and two beers in by now, Oswen says; "I know - I know I can bring him back, but it's always difficult when Orvil goes. We talk all the time and I think he'd love to see this, but I wasn't careful and put him into danger."

We talk about options and we aren't sure how to find out information on getting to the upper city. In the end, Inafina suggests we could just try to go through a portal and see what they say; in the mean time though we should explore! This is an extraordinary opportunity.



### 7pm

We pay and leave. It's getting dark. The path leads us around the southern side of the tower and we see a long, wide road stretching away. There seems to be another further up, but we just go down the one we're on.

The behaviour of avoiding us continues. Everyone here seems destitute. A lot of poverty, and so a lot of distrust. The housing construction is not so bad, but they look like a lot of people are crammed into each. Clothing is poor. Quite a few children, but they don't look too happy or well feed. It feels *almost* like a slum. It's busy and, in scale, it feels just about at the level of a city - or rather, the *population* of a city squeezed into a large town.

There are some beautiful buildings here and there, grand, stone - but not in good repair. That makes it feel like this city/town used to be more prosperous and important, but society has shifted and perhaps this is a society in decline; issues perhaps ran a lot deeper than just their overuse of the weave.

"It's not what I expected but, now I see it, it makes more sense than what the books had suggested."

We reach a bridge over the river. It's *very* grand - 30ft wide, carved flagstones, walkways either side, wrought iron decorations of seahorses and so-forth all along. That really leans into the feeling that this whole place used to be a lot more rich! There are ornate metal-post lamps with magic light all along. On either side as we cross, we see a large number of piers all along the river banks - the river some 180ft wide - snaking away in each direction. We can see lights of other bridges now too, so all these piers are likely to be for river-based trade rather than simply local fishing or "crossing the river" traffic. Lots of barges visible, but nothing that big.

Lizardfolk are more common here. It's lively down around the docks; we cross and reach an area which seems to be a market. Well, a *dock* market specifically. There is a combination of Common and Netherese. It's a bit of a warren of narrow market streets. We take a closer look. The stalls appear to be selling stuff that's pretty much directly off boats. We don't see many of the poorer works here now; a different class; traders, not exactly *wealthy* but not destitute.

Inafina's ears are working overtime, ADV PER 24. While we have glances and people moving aside like before, but it's rare for her to hear anything about us. There's just one "why are the arcanists coming down to the dock market themselves, don't they have people to do that for them?" - but other than that it's mostly just trade chatter. But there *is* an undertone. Coded language, almost. One group chatting in Common to some lizardfolk *seem* to be talking about mundane things but in a way that suggests there's actually something else going on. Could be anything - illicit goods, plans for theft, or rebellion, no way to know.

Oswen SUR 19, has some idea how things should be laid out. And they are. Interesting; again, millennia pass, basics don't change. The cost of food is low. Equivalent of charges in coppers, but even more expensive stuff is charged that way - e.g. the equivalent of 120 coppers. That's evidently the standard denomination used in this part of the town/city; that's unusual to her - in a village, sure, but a town or city this big? Strange.

Around the edges are smaller warehouses, some with physical shops attached. There is also a fish market (closed this late in the day, of course) and so-on. It feels like a centre of trade for a lot of purposes.

Inafina whispers, "There *is* carpet. I mean - I presume there are protections against it, but we could just try to *fly* up? Wouldn't being able to do that demonstrate magical ability?"

There's a fountain in a sort of circular area surrounded by stalls, but it's broken and there are signs of repeated graffiti cleaned off. INV 18; well, there are signs of rebellion! Remnants of "death to arcanists" (!) and a not-yet-cleaned drawing of a flying city on fire. A couple of guards approach. "Can I help you?" they say, in "that" tone of voice. Oswen says, "I can clearly see what this used to say. A better job should be done of cleaning it!" "That - that is not our role! It is not safe for you here. We strongly advise you return to the Netherese enclave!"

She tries to act haughty, then deliberately cuts herself off, and says it's embarrassing but she wanted to see the city and got lost! Only DECEP 14, but they roll a 2 so it's enough. One sheepishly says that if we *do* want to explore the city, we might do well to disguise ourselves as commoners. Anyway, we get pointed towards the enclave - in fact, an obviously much more brightly-lit area sort of North-West - and Oswen uses the excuse of being very short!

The guards depart. We want to explore more. But - commoner... Hmm. Can we use Disguise Self? Kindle points out that he saw a stall selling clothes. Lots of racks of simple clothes.

* Oswen ends up in a short t-shirt that ought to have been a crop top for a normal person, which says, "My eyes are up here" on it
* Inafina gets a big long t-shirt that's almost like a skirt that says "I went to Conch and all I got was this lousy t-shirt" on the back
* Bel got a hypercolour t-shirt that doesn't change colour (wait, are these legit?!)
* Kindle ends up in a rather fetching combination of long-sleeve loose top and trousers, in the same colour, with white stripe running down the arms and sides of the legs.

We need to change. "Bel!" says Oswen, taking off her hat and pulling the strange t-shirt on over her robe. "We need an inn!" - and Bel finds one; **The Bill Of Lading**. Inside we meet - **Bill**, inevitably. A room for four? One on the ground floor; one on the third floor. We opt for 3rd. Shared bathrooms, separate baths though, on each floor. We pay for one night.

Upstairs, it's cramped but we'll make it work. Two bunk beds. Could even be used as a dorm; not much space. Oswen says, "Sorry Bel - but it's only for one night". It's time to get properly changed into our "commoner" clothes.

Back outside, and aware that the dock market area is not necessarily that safe, we remember that there is the chance of theft and we should be alert. Bel switches to his cane and uses his Hat of Disguise, looking very like a local.

We head down a road roughly in line with the way we came in, that continues away from the market to a sort of 5-ish way junction and, in the centre, is a magical sculpture made of marble. An old man, clearly an arcanist, sits on a throne with some kind of staff. There are five small models of flying cities that rotate around. Oswen makes a sketch of it. There's a wall of force stopping her getting closer - this explains the lack of graffiti!

Everything is in Netherese. She *really* needs to find a way to read it without spellcasting. "One step at a time. I have to learn the language, at least the basics, not sure how long that'll take... Book shop. This is probably a 'tomorrow' problem but we can at least try."

It's not a brilliant plan, but the best idea we have is to go to the brightly lit area around the enclave and *maybe* there'll be something there. We cross the river via a North-South bridge we can see a short distance away. Now we see trees. And as we head West towards the enclave, buildings get significantly bigger and more grand. Two are more temple-like, almost cathedrals, with towers and even a rose window. We look closer and they *are* temples. One, closer to the docks, is to the Lady Of Fortune.

Most signs here are in Netherese only. Just a few have Common. Streets are cobbled and in better condition. As we turn North again, she sees a big four-storey building that reads "university" to her and has lights on. Worth checking out later. There are more temples here. Buildings are quite beautiful, often with ivy. We see one or two arcanists now, accompanied usually by Magan, but they now see us as commoners.

The enclave is very easy to see from here - but it's also noisy. A column of light, apparently decorative, stretches up into the sky, pulsing in various colours. 30ft high walls seem to enclose it but we can still hear sounds of music and revelry. There are fairy-tale like, twisting towers, pearlescent, soaring up over 100ft, with light coming from them. A party? Several parties?! Is this a normal night?

Oswen's initial feeling is, bluntly, one of disgust. She *knows* she shouldn't apply her "modern day" Ordulin sensibilities here. It's thousands of years ago and she doesn't know much at all about any of these people, and certainly does not know if that party is a one-off thing or commonplace. But even so. That's her response.

She spots a temple to Mystryl - the goddess of magic. That's surprising. She can read the arcane glyphs. Mystryl not Mystra, but close enough. "Oh" she says, "potentially - as they say in Neverwinter - 'bingo'". She puts her hat back on and leads the group towards the temple.

The doors open in front of us automatically, via some kind of magical trigger. There's a 30ft high cathedral space with an elegant, almost bone-like set of buttresses and trusses. Pendant lights hang down, arcane fire within. There are sculptured tryptics depicting great deeds. The whole thing is over-the-top, in many ways. At one end is a 20ft high statue of _Mystryl_ - since this depiction looks very different from any Oswen has seen before. She looks more like a warrior goddess than a mage! 

A priest approaches. "Good evening" (in Common) - a confused expression, it's the hat! He tries Netherese too. "Oh! For today - Common, please" says Oswen. "We do not judge; is there something we can help with today?" - they are happy to sell incense and of course it's sold in Divination quantities. "This will be 5 gold taels". It should be 25! Oswen offers a donation, then... It's gladly accepted. In the conversation, we cover things like where our coin is from; the Academy; how it's "harder to get into these days" - it's expensive but also magical talent is getting harder to find.

* In the priest's word, it's as if it's being bred out of the population down here for some reason, but increasing in the city above.
* The way he speaks is almost conspiratorial. He serves *magic*, Oswen realises. He's talked about other worlds and **other times**.
* He's already noticed weave damage and Phaerimm attacks that have caused a rapid decline in magical energy.
* Some are furious that the arcanists in the High Netherese enclaves continue with their rampant experimentation and use of magic. That just draws the Phaerimm in more.
* "They're getting more desperate and more savage! We've known about these attacks for at least the last 200 years. They've started siphoning magic out of the land itself as a means to attack! It's causing crops to fail. Plants and animals die; land dries up. As if the earth can no longer sustain itself."

Inafina INS 27. This is entirely being told as he believes it. He knows about conspiracy theories! But he thinks this is all true.

We learn that Karsus on Eileanar is gathering the most powerful arcanists of all the cities to run a ritual that he claims will end the Phaerimm threat once and for all. Oswen HIS dirty 20... It's claimed that Karsus brought about the fall of the empire; and we start discussing things; we hear a similar take with some differences but the bottom line - a particular ritual lead to the collapse of the weave entirely in Toril for a brief period of time. Not the spell plague, but even so, for a few years *no* magic was possible. It drove the arcanists crazy. Rebellion, uprisings, total chaos and civil war and the Phaerimm capitalised on that.

Hmm. So the Phaerimm still had magic... There must be a difference between innate magic and specifically invoked magic, the latter failing but the former apparently not?

Eventually she gets to cast Divination. The question is simple; how do the four of us gain access to the upper city? Sprays of colour, dancing light. It flies across the room, surprising the priest; it reaches the statue, which moves and speaks!

"My child. Oh! You who are of magic, and yet not of me. Curious. You have the birthright with which to enter; you who are, by skill, an arcanist - just not by name. Pass the trials and enter the upper world. This is the path and the permission you seek. But act with expedience. My time is short."

It turns out that nobody else saw that last part.

The priest offers us some items that we might want, in exchange for our donation. This turns into a bit of a shopping episode. These items are kind of common here, but she's not seen them before. The things we opt for are:

* A mask that can somewhat alter her appearance
* A bracelet that can help with strength, but is a "consumable" item with limited uses
* A handbell that can summon a Magen!

The handbell is expensive, the other two cheap. But either way, the prices are *low* compared to anything in Toril. She's really taking them for study. Because the priest has expressed interest in currencies, she gives him a variety. He's seen the Sigil ones before! We can tell that not only has he encountered people who've travelled here from other times before, **the Netherese themselves have definitely *actually travelled* through time** and many words. "More than 100".

Pleasantries exchanged, we head outside. As soon as the door closes, Oswen leans against the wall and puts her hand on it. Sighs heavily. "I'm so sorry. We can't stop it. If there was anything we could do, we would. But I think you know, for us, it has already happened" - and *then* explains to the group what happened with the divination.

The bookshop forgotten for a moment, we start to head back to the inn but very quickly reach the university building. Two Magen guard the door. "If you can speak, please tell me; or if you can come with us, please lead us; or if you can point, please point - to the nearest bookshop." One opens the door and points inside! "Thank you!"

We head inside. All signs are in Netherese. Oswen fast-casts Comprehend Languages. Yep, an academy. Various signs; a library and some kind of shop. There's even a display that gives a short history of Netheril! It starts at year zero. She starts taking notes. Fishing villages unite under king Nether. Make contact with elves of the Eileanar. They skip some stuff that our modern-day history books have. And so-on, and so-forth. The creation of the first Mythallar to create the first flying city. She spends a bit more time on *that*. Some 3,400 years are covered. **"The great mage Ioulaum creates the first Mythallar flying city and elevates the arcanists into High Netheril"** - only some 500 years after the first founding. "The silver age" - the empire outgrows the "verdant lands of Netheril" (now desert!) and fly cities over the "backwater coast", introducing civilisation to the "barbarians and primitive people". **"The golden age" - 1800 years ago; undersea enclaves established, "Deep Netheril".** Attempt to steal Netherscrolls uncovered - a degree of paranoia is being revealed here. **Experimentation with travel to other worlds**; 900 years ago. 400 years ago - the Arch Wizard Karsus founds the flying city of Eileanar. Emergence of the Phaerimm; the last of the Nether Scrolls are stolen. There's a date for "today" - sets it at **_year 3517_**. "Arch Wizard Karsus develops the ritual of remaking". Well, we're meant to be *roughly* 2000 years back from the collapse of our time, but we don't know how much between this 3517 year and that collapse. However, the divination would imply fairly soon, but that's a god's idea of "fairly soon".

We are greeted by someone speaking Netherese. Oswen makes out that she's "practicing her Common" because of our "visits" to the "barbaric lands". We learn about "speaking stones" - they help use any language. They sell them in the gift shop and that's run by elves, so always open!

Since she can read the signs, we know the way. And we find that this gift shop isn't just nonsense, at least not to us. Magic for these people was an everyday convenience. Lots of magic items here. We ask about speaking stones and are shown a variety, apparently selected purely based on appearance. Oswen asks Bel to choose one - he picks that's purple and has a strange felt texture which is actually really nice. ARC 23... Interesting and completely new! It has lots of charges, and it's as if in this world it'll never run out as it refills quickly from the wave. A speaker touches it and hangs it back to you and then after that whatever we say is spoken in their language. It can't change your *appearance* though so people will know you're using a translation device. And it's not Comprehend Languages, either, so she'd need that to understand the response. It's very Netherese - they *tell people stuff* and want to be understood, but don't care much about the answer.

A lot of items that we find as we browse are familiar to Oswen. And there are books - "A Handy Guide For The Aspiring Arcanist" subtitle, "Customs, Phrases of High Netheril" - that's a definite thing to get - it's aimed at "common" people who want to get into the school so it *does* have a Common to Netherese section. It's not full, but it'll do. She also finds a wand of Detect Magic. Handy!

25 for the stone, 10 for the book, 200 for the wand. She pays and as we leave she says, "Can we stay here?!" - but really, she'd *rather not*.

We head back to the inn with the plan that, tomorrow, we will try to sign up for the trials tomorrow. She reads a sign for the administrative office, which is closed but has opening hours posted - 8am.

Back that the inn, we settle down in the cramped but serviceable quarters.

"This is really difficult. All this is done... Dead. We'd always try to stop it. But this time we can't; it already happened. This makes my head *and* heart hurt in a manner to which I am unaccustomed! There's sort of no point in getting involved in any of the intrigue, any of it; any plots or plans."

Oswen stays up a little late. She's studying the book, focusing on the language section. INV 19+15->34!



## Campaign Day 57
### City of Conch, year roughly -550DR (~2000 years ago)

We get up early in the morning, inspired as ever by Bel's morning song. We properly stow our desert clothing but keep our "looking like a local" clothing handy. Oswen wears her t-shirt over her robe and keeps her hat off, and Bel uses the disguise hat again, just to get us from here to the academy. We thank the innkeeper and book an extra night, since we know the trials won't be today, then ask where's good for decent, inexpensive breakfast, since this inn only offers accommodation but not food. The market is recommended, or a baker down the street. We opt for the baker. It's good!

Very different vibe in the morning; lots of goods trade. Deliveries go through security checks into the Enclave.

At the academy, Administration is open. A tortle is at the desk, looking at us over their glasses. We are greeted in Netherese and Common. Oswen "Oh, thank you. I am practicing Common! I wish to go through the trials." "Well, we would have to enrol you as a student."

Enrolling involves a 100gp fee, and a few forms that she's able to fill out quite quickly. She would need to get assessed if she wants to take "the exams" (AKA The Arcane Trials). "Yes please!"

Fortunately, Oswen's "retinue" can be "brought with you" - and can even be in the room during the assessment, but obviously can't assist. We opt for a "no cheating!" rule, though Bel offers some Inspiration beforehand. We're asked to wait a while in a room, a simple academic affair that looks like it's quite old; after a while an older man arrives wearing older robes that match the robes we saw people on the street wearing last night. "I am **Arcanist Mugslulu**" "I'm Oswen. Oswen Hafflethwaite." "In your form, you said you had some previous experience with magic. You have some proficiency?" "I think so, but of course, I do not know if you yourself would rate it as strong or weak." "Well indeed, that's what I am here for!"

An arcane ward is raised to prevent spells from helping her.

She's first given some scrolls and asked to identify the spells. She can read them, but hasn't seen those spells before; ARC 27 though, she's at least able to figure out what they should do in theory. She notes that they're, well, a bit horrific actually; it's troubling to read about domination/compulsion-like effects and so forth.

Next, without using magic items, she's asked to tell him what something says - he holds up an old script in a book. It's old but she can read it easily so she describes what each rune means, though she can't necessarily connect all of those into a complete meaning. Next, she's given a handbell and asked to identify it. It's very familiar! "Well, that's a little unfair for me, because we bought one of these in the gift shop just last night!" - but she acknowledges that without the likes of Detect Magic, it *could* be enchanted in some other way.

Next he asks if he's real! She tries her recently-discovered innate Detect Thoughts ability. Nothing. "No! You're not in the room."

The real Arcanist enters and reintroduces himself. The two are now in the room together. Apparently, one is incapable of acting on its own behalf but is physically present, not just an illusion.

A strange rodent with bat-like wings is shown to her. It looks unhappy. "Can you tell me what unfortunate spell or effect has befallen this creature?"

She figures she could use Identify to identify a spell as well as an object and it'd be more concrete than Detect Magic, so she fast-casts the Ritual. It's unexpected. The Geas spell. And the creature has been given an impossible task and therefore is in great pain. She asks the Arcanist if he cast that spell; no; nor did he give the creature its task. And the spell will last _months_ - it was cast at Level 7! But she does not have Dispel Magic... Bel does, but he's not able to cast.

The poor creature is put back into a box. Then she's asked to light a doll on fire. She says, "We *are* talking about getting into the high cities here. That's all?!" "Yes. I need to assess your ability and readiness to take the trials." She casts Firebolt; it all but destroys the object and now it's burning. "Now I need you to put it out!" says the Arcanist. Ray Of Frost hits very squarely and puts it out. Only cantrips.

The next thing is apparently the last part of the assessment. "For this, I require that you trust me, for we need to connect mind to mind. Do you agree?"

Oswen says, "Yes. But be aware that you may not receive a flattering impression after" - she points at the box - "showing me *that* creature". So of course he casts Detect Thoughts, and goes in deeper and she lets that through. He's digging around for specifically thoughts of submerged, or covert issues related to harming the high Netherese. Is she a member of the rebellion?

She doesn't attempt to hide her distaste at some of the practices; she's sure that not everyone up there agrees with each other on methodology anyway. And she *definitely* does not want an uprising right now - she needs them to teach her!

The arcanist says she's passed and will lodge her paperwork. She has to sit a class and then take the trails if "you do still feel comfortable" - then return to Administration today, before the closing time, and pay the fee. "Welcome to the High Netherese Academy of the Arcane Arts" - she's handed a certificate and a small pin.

Her "retinue" must remain within 10ft of her at all times else become stuck! Doors are secured.

Before he leaves, Oswen asks to see the creature in the box. It's permitted; she walks through the ward wall, then asks Bel if he can try to dispel the magic. They both know it's well above what he could normally dispel - but it's a nat 1. It fizzles. But that's probably good luck; "I wouldn't do that if I were you! That is school property!" he says, and takes it back.

Once he's gone, she gives him a hug. He's a bit distraught, but that was cast at the very limit of what Oswen can cast herself, and even then only once a day. "These are not nice people. We must be on our guard."

There are, to her surprise given this ad hoc unscheduled enrolment, that there are 6 other people in the class she must attend. Most ignore her, one looking haughtily, but one points to an empty desk next to her, so Oswen takes it. "I'm Kiara. What's your name?" "Oswen. Nice to meet you."

Oswen feels a bit of sympathy for her poor three friends who must now sit in on a lecture given by two academic Arcanists!

There's a big diagram which explains what's involved in the Trials. The other students here have decided that they want to attempt the Trails having finished all requisite lessons and have passed a threshold. They have the financial means, too. Some have been practicing things for weeks. Kiara lacks confidence; she's attempted and failed twice before. The third attempt is the last permitted. She's clearly from a wealthy family though and so is everyone else except one, a quiet boy, guarded, dark-haired, looks like he's from a "lower class".

She needs to remember the diagram. HIS 5+5->10 but with Bardic high roll, 18. She remembers some missing steps at the last minute. Bel offers some inspiring words (again). While this goes on, Oswen casts Detect Thoughts with a spell slot. Kiara is on-the-level and glad another girl is in the class! All the others are boys. She's good-hearted but seems oblivious to economic disparity; accidental privilege. She shifts her attention to the guy in the 2nd-hand robes. Judgy and quiet. Dislikes everyone in the class.

But then... ARC 31. *False* thoughts. Almost explicitly mundane. Covering up. The dislikes are leaking from underneath. She remembers her own detection "security check". This guy has a magic shield of some kind; it's broadcasting, well, preprogrammed thoughts of some nature. Oswen uses Telepathic Utterance to warn Inafina and ask her to keep an eye out, in case he tries anything - unwise.

Oswen keeps scanning the room. Two people here are twins. Only *one* has magical aptitude. They got their via their connections, and one of the two is understandably very nervous. Surely they won't get away with *that*.

That haughty character? Annoyed at the waste of timing and biding time. Parents will pull strings. So, not confident through ability. The last student is another one who ignored her when she arrived. He's a bit stressed. He doesn't *quite* understand everything, but is trying his best. He can only afford to sit the exam once.

There's just enough time for a superficial pass over the lecturers. Nothing. Shielded; not a lack of thoughts - a bouncing-off - divination magic is being deflected.

Back to the one who can only sit once. As things progress she watches closely him and Kiara. She's interested in if Kiara might *ever* be good enough to do this on her third try, or if that worried guy might eventually get there, albeit not on the first time. She notices him not paying attention sometimes - he drifts off - so he ends up with gaps in his knowledge. Kiara is really nice but just *doesn't* have the aptitude. At the lower levels she's solid, but she doesn't quite have the finesse, discipline and accuracy for the high level. She gets frustrated at herself, but laughs it off.

Ultimately, though, Kiara just doesn't want to disappoint her parents - they want her to be an Arcanist. That's the only sure path to social status. Her father and grandfather and so-on - all Arcanists.

Kiara is genuinely lovely. All this - this empire - is all going to be destroyed, but maybe Kiara could have 5 minutes of happiness. She does her best to coach! INT based persuasion, nat 1 -> reroll for Halfling, nat 5 -> 10 total, sigh, blow Heroc Inspo only 8 -> 13, add Bardic, only 4, 17. Well it's not a *total* disaster. The bottom line is she doesn't practice enough.

Of course all of this takes time. 4 hours of time. Kindle is patient. Inafina is patient. Bel is out of his mind with boredom.

The quiet one, the one with the hidden thoughts - *that* one is good. Nailing it. Oswen takes time out to talk to Inafina. "So, he's definitely up to no good because of the shielding; any thoughts?" - and ARC 20, she's noticed that he's holding back magically. She doesn't know how good he is, but he's not revealing it all. She might even find him a difficult challenge for herself. Spell attack roll to check how well Oswen is doing - 23 - she's nailing it. So *she* gets attention, annoying some of the others but Kiara loves it, and Oswen would be sure she's getting noticed by the Quiet Guy - but he doesn't seem to care. So, what does Inafina think about all of that? INS 21. The quiet one is vaguely interested, perhaps puzzled by Oswen's appearance, but is disciplined enough to focus on what he has to do. Whatever his intent, he's single-minded on the trials.

At the end of the class, everyone goes for a late lunch. "You are welcome back later; we have practice in the Target Room in the afternoon. But if you are thinking about Enrolling, please make sure you do so soon; the class finishes at 5 but so does the Administration Room". Ugh. Classic. By the time you know for sure if you want to enrol, it's too late to enrol!

Kiara is keen for Oswen to join her for lunch. Oswen waits a bit, though, waiting for the quiet boy, **Darian**. He heads straight for the admin office. Oswen follows. He notices and once we're queuing. There's a bit of an exchange; she reveals that she knows he's hiding something; TL;DR, she won't give that away but he doesn't really want to speak to her and doesn't want her to ruin "everything that he's worked for". He starts paying when it's his turn - coppers and silvers, bags of them, from a ratty old backpack that shouldn't hold as much volume or weight so must be a kind of Bag Of Holding. He's 28gp short; Oswen telepathically urges him not to be offended and "finds on the floor" the 3 platinum he "dropped". Of course they don't believe it, but don't care, they have the money!

Over lunch, during resting, Oswen figures that Psychic Lance is probably not going to help in these trials but Bigby's Hand is more general purpose. She swaps those out.

Our turn. They want to go to lunch but Bel holds them up and slams a bag of 50pp on the desk. "There! What's the paperwork?!"

A silver token - a ticket of sorts, with arcane writings on it - is returned in due course. It's a registration. A small packet of information with rules is included too.

* No magic artefacts
* No spell scrolls
* No helpers
* Only one designated wand and book or other arcane focus

We get back to lunch with Kiara. Under a trellis of blooming wisteria - but isn't it the wrong time of year?! - sits Kiara, with bodyguards and a (smaller) blue Magen. There's a spread of food in front of her. Oswen asks to sit, then asks permission for her "retinue" - actually, people she's been through a lot with - to sit too. It's no problem at all.

It's a pretty nice conversation. We just chat about stuff. The party is introduced and Kiara asks if Oswen's family are "silver empiracists" - Oswen guesses that this is people from before the age of Magen, who prefer 'real' helpers rather than Magen. And we learn that Kiara is from... Tulthantar. The one that disappeared into the Shadowfell, returned, tried to re-establish the Empire, went to war with the Elves and crashed into Mythdrannor.

The afternoon lesson is more practice and trials. The haughty guy heads off mid-class to register. Three of us, then. The lecturers set up a mock trial! "Your last chance to practice, if you're attending Trials tomorrow."

The first step - reading a spell. And Kiara got very unlucky here on her second attempt, as it's quite high level and she couldn't quite figure it out (L5, she needed an Arcana check and failed it). The spell is Alternate Future. Oswen is amazed, it could be a *phenomenally* useful spell. The assessors are quite impressed at the ease with which she casts it.

Next, a spell attack - "activate" the trial by hitting three targets which are 60ft away. Easy. Scorching ray - 21, 27, 29 to hit! All three hit. "Showing off, are we? The astute would just use Magic Missile!" they comment.

This marks the start of the trials. She has to go through a maze to sneak past golems and retrieve a small cup. Not a chalice - just a teacup! - on the other side. "Hell of a waste of a spell" she says. All she can do - L7 Teleport to the other side of the maze!

Next, she has to make it over a series of pits and traps. Has to use Bigby's Hand. There's a saucer at the end. Goes with the teacup.

The third step... Find the path to the other side of a chasm. There are blocks she can jump onto to get over, but they're all invisible. This one tends to kill people (!) - over a river of lava - that's why they have this Alternate Future spell going on. Well *this* she can do; True Seeing for herself. Truesight, L6. It lasts an hour. Interestingly, each block only appears when she's already on one. Fortunately ACRO +7 -> 25. She figures that stops people just using Fly if they somehow detect the target. This trial eventually yields a banner.

In the actual trial, she's supposed to put the cup onto the saucer and put the banner in the cup, fill it with hot water, she drinks it, a construct appears which matches what she fears; and she must battle it.

That, apparently, is all that's needed for the test. The 'future' rewinds. She's back, with assessors looking impressed.

The haughty guy is next. His names is **Mikkale**. He's grumpy. Did not go well. In fact he *snaps his wand!* "Ridiculous! I obviously did get onto it. I just clipped the edge!"

Next, the ever-curious Darien. He reads the scroll in a strange way. Low, boomy. HIS 9. She's not encountered that before. He starts, the future rewinds and he comes back; he seems pleased. But he has a bit of argument about this strange thing. What is this magic? What is it? While this goes on - Oswen once again casts Detect Thoughts. He's very worried about interactions between any other magic and magic he has active. He's *petrified* by a creature based on his fears being manifested; he can't prepare for that; he has no control over that. His surface thoughts are that *they* have been preparing for something and this was never mentioned at any time. They haven't prepared for it. As much as Kiara is afraid of disappointing her parents, Darien is afraid of letting down a *great* number of people.

Oswen sends telepathically - "Apologies for this method of communication, which does not permit reply. I am *not* an Arcanist; neither of us are; you know this. Maybe I can help. I don't know how. It's up to you. We have a room at The Bill Of Lading, near the dock market. Follow us there."

It's time to go home. Without explaining why, Oswen says to her party that they should  return to the inn (but not hurry). Kiara wants us to go partying but we make polite excuses, wish her the very best (and she wishes Oswen luck) - maybe we'll see her up there one day.

We make it back to the inn. At the room, Oswen explains what's been going on. We'll wait just in case Darian turns up. Nat 19 on the INT check, 24 total, 2 more successes.

ARC 32... Suddenly detects _someone_ scanning her mind. And then there's a knock on the door. "Come in, Darian!" she calls out. The door is not locked or latched. But then there's a clack of a latch being released using tools and the window opens! It's Darian. "Not bad, I didn't expect that!" says Oswen.

There's a bit of a heart-to-heart. Darian casts Tiny Hut, since he claims there are scrying censors all over the city - there's been increasing paranoia and talks of rebellion for *decades* by now. He knows about other worlds, about the future predictions and about the ritual. Its casting is believed imminent! It'll take days, maybe a week or two, but within a month at most, he thinks it'll complete and everything will fall. So he wants to act quickly. He says that she, if she wants to learn circle magic - something he has never heard of - she must do it faster than his group act! And that's fair enough.

Maybe we can help. A meeting is proposed, at 9pm at a public baths that'll be closed at that time. After Darian departs, Oswen confesses that in offering to help, she doesn't think she's risking sacrificing the future. If asked to help, she'll do her very best, but ultimately, she really believes that anything we do here can't change the future. It doesn't make sense to split into multiple realities to her, given Sigil is supposed to be access to all such things; she believes that it's circular. Any - *all* - travel backwards _has already happened_ in "the future time" and all consequences of that _have already happened_ too.

If we headed to the Baths, we could go past the House Of Wine And Vinegar; Bel is interested in going back and experiencing more, as ourselves, perhaps in our "commoner clothes" (definitely no understudy-Arcanist pins on display!) - so we head out. It's a different experience with people no longer giving nasty glances or parting ways as we walk through! At the inn, we're recognised by the owners - but no mention is made of our rather different attire - and offered a table "up at the front, by the show". It's a 40 copper-per-person deal for the show plus food. Relatively expensive for these parts but we can afford it (!) and try to enjoy ourselves.

The skits at times are somewhat subversive - classic entertainment in parody or satire, making fun of authority.

"Again. Two *thousand* years. But this could be another town in our time. On Toril, or your worlds, or the Outlands. Anywhere."

Part of Bel's earlier argument for going here was to learn things. Have conversations, keep ears open. We mingle. Oswen and Inafina (latter - ADV PER 19+11 -> 28) - a lot of disgruntled people. There's an Overseer of some kind here who is advising caution; not to act yet; it's interesting - people speak openly. "There were *twenty* people brought through with injuries from the mines today - twenty! - the doubled production quotas are just too dangerous".

Suddenly there's a kerfuffle. Doors swing open. "Make way!" - we hear there's been some kind of disaster in the mine, some kind of explosion; people are heavily injured.  Oswen immediate says, "Bel! Kindle! To work!" "On it!" - then she asks "Anyone else hurt?" "We don't know; part of a tunnel collapsed!" "No. I don't want more bodies on my hands!" "Just *show me*" insists Oswen. It works; we're shown by a miner, injured himself but not too badly and we rush past the tower and Magen to the main tower. An overseer is directing people, double-takes at Oswen and Inafina, recognising us from when we first arrived. "Wait! What are you doing here?" "You know I can help. Where's the collapse?" - he seems to wrestle with things internally for a second then gives up on differences. "This way".

A ceiling section has collapsed. Inafina listens for signs of life while Oswen has cast Bigby's Hand. People have clearly recognised Oswen as an arcanist, even if not dressed as such. As Oswen moves big boulders swiftly, others run in. At one point she gets people clear and attacks, pulverising some boulders and it's enough to create a bit of a passage for more people. It's all done in a huge rush, since the spell only lasts a minute. Some are dead and beyond any help - just crushed - but many are rescued.

She's had a good chance to see things while here. It's clear where stress fractures are present, and the use of explosives in such areas is reckless, but they're under huge pressure due to "the quotas". "Idiotic!" Oswen opines. "If they want more, then pushing so hard that safety gets forgotten is stupid; it works against them, disasters such as this are inevitable!"

Once back at the ramshackle buildings, we help physically where we can. Bel and Kindle have healing magic; Inafina and Oswen do not. They can at least each be a pair of hands. A cleric and gnome artificer are the sum total of medical help for the entire population, outside of the Enclave. They're doing the best they can. Kindle is horrified.

"Healing potions" says Oswen. "We need to run. We can't risk the carpet, but we have to run and get as many as they have in that shop. Cost is irrelevant."

Kindle says that he, too, can push more healing out but it's not *sustainable*. They need more *healers*. "But anyone with magical aptitude gets taken up to the cities!" says the gnome.

OK, so maybe someone like Kiara can be convinced to change career plan! but in the short term, healing potions. The gnome says where ships that bring them in can be found. Smuggler barons control it! "OK, let's go, no time to waste" - and the hear that the trade is typically done *in the public baths*. What *is* it with that place?!

To the baths. Best speed, on foot. Clearly closed. It's in heavy disrepair, boarded up windows, holes in walls. But "in the day", we can see that the baths should surely have been beautiful. Once-gold domes and mosaics... *In the day*. Now, it's just a derelict mess.

Oswen is in a rush. No time to waste. Yet *another* Detect Thoughts (L3 now, L2 exhausted). There are *lots* of such thoughts inside. Interesting! A variant of Common, a bit broken, front-of-mind; and something else, reptilian/draconian. Given what we saw in the dock market, perhaps the lizardfolk are the smugglers? So we just push on and soon find people. We're watched for a while but ultimately ignored.

Inafina flat Perception (sight-based) 20+9. She spots the person we were told about, this smuggler baron. Deals with healing supplies. Seems to be busier, a whole section of the baths area seems to be for him alone. "Sorry for the intrusion. What's the etiquette? We're here to buy." "You have coin, I have goods! Whoever has more coin wins."

Two cases of healing potions are on display. "I can do bulk deals." "Bulk deals - yes!" "These here, 20 healing potions. 1000 gold pieces." A total rip. Bel starts to argue, but Oswen (apologetically) interrupts. We clearly have need, and one pays a premium for being in need and in a rush! Surely, additional magical supplies might be thrown in to sweeten the deal? The smuggler is astute - "Well, if you buy *two* cases, 2000 gold pieces... Well, I can throw in medical bed, splits, bandages... All these things here..." - Oswen is about to agree, but Bel starts persuading - *and* casts Charm Person. Woah. That's sneaky. It's a 30 roll, so absolutely successful. He gets the price down to 1500, which is still much higher than would normally be the case, but a far better deal.

We pay from party funds; Charmed smuggler is convinced to "take the night off" given he's sold literally everything he has; Oswen checks her "watch" - 8:35 - we have about 58 minutes before this person knows what we did! Bel expresses "Caster's Remorse", but too late now. It's a lot to carry, but Kindle can lift a lot plus we have the portable hole, bags etc., and Bel uses Levitate on the bed which we load up with lots of things too. We rush back.

The priest - she's called **Cyrleine** ("Cyrleine Of The Pond", technically, a kind of hedge witch with a staff of healing) - and gnome artificer - she's called **Tacinbok** - are shown all the stuff we got. "How did you manage to get all this?" Oswen answers, "A deal of questionable providence, for which we might pay dearly in an hour or two! But that's on us, not on you. I'm so sorry, we have to leave straight away! Our magic's more or less tapped out now anyway, and there's a very important meeting..."

The "clock" might be more of a curse than a blessing, realises Oswen, as her anxieties rise as she knows *exactly* what time it is. We get there at 8:56! And there, we see Darian. He's... Skulking. It's his Thing. We're basically introduced to what amounts to a resistance cell. It's a question of us maybe being of mutual benefit to one another, but only if we make it up to the flying city. They realise we cannot help them get there. They already have *one* agent up there, just one, who has to be very covert; we're told some of the ways to recognise such, and how to get messages back down. Surveillance up there is very tight; the only way up is from the palace at the Enclave or when ore is moved. But when ore is moved, usually no humans - no living things - ever go with it; only Magen do.

We learn that there is indeed now no permitted "air traffic" between the cities on the ground and in the sky.

Kindle is feeling the passing of time nervously - Bel's spell will expire soon! - so we make haste away for the inn.

Back at the inn, Oswen with Bel's help does well with study again (2 more successes, 6 total). She also has time to start preparing spells for tomorrow...

* Ice Knife for Invisibility
* Teleportation Circle for Levitate
* Legend Lore for Dispel Magic
* Intellect Fortress for Misty Step



## Campaign Day 58
### City of Conch

Bel sings his morning song; Oswen creates a one-day temporary scroll for Longstrider, just in case. We leave the inn and go to the usual bakery to grab breakfast. Kindle is being quite protective today; he worries a lot.

To Oswen's surprise, an academy representative is waiting at the door and greets Oswen. "Please come with me. Retinue may watch from the gallery." Oswen asks about the time loop spell - would they be able to see anything? She's told that for the purposes of the spell they use a different version of the scroll that allows people within a certain radius to watch. Of course, they cannot assist. We're taken up to the examination hall.

Darian and Mikkale are already there. Kiara comes by to wish us all the best.

A sort of snow globe is produced, with three spectral butterflies in it. Upon request, we all place a hand on the glass. The butterflies one by one land on the inside, one per hand. We're told to *take* the butterfly; we simply make a sort of pulling gesture and the butterfly comes through the glass; we're left holding an origami butterfly made of parchment. D6->5, but Darian D6->6, so he's last. Mikkale gets a 2 and goes first, Oswen second.

Mikkale is accompanied by some kind of tutor and a lady with lots of jewellery who we think is his mother. They go in and the doors are shut. We don't get to watch what happens. But it shouldn't take long - due to the time loop, it only takes a minute or so per person by our standards. And in due course we hear noises from inside - it sounds a bit argumentative though... Then the door swings open violently, Darian storming out, a huge cloud over his expression. His mother is trying to console him - "It's alright dear, you get two more goes! Your father didn't get it on the first time either!" "I was given a faulty scroll. I'm sure it affected my performance!" he shouts back. "It's uneven! Something's wrong with those platforms. There's no way I could've missed it."

Scroll? But *after* the initial reading, so once in the main trial, since he mentioned uneven steps? Did he use a scroll in there?!

"Oswen Hafflethwaite" is called. It's time. Oswen gives over anything she's not allowed to take inside to Kindle.

The four of us are guided in; Oswen is taken to a circle and the others are directed to seats by some banisters. Before going, Bel says, "Oswen, you could do this in your sleep! You're going to fly through your trials!" - a not-so-subtle Bardic Inspiration.

The spell-reading is easy; it's the same L5 spell, more or less, but she does notice a few variations. Three targets appear. She uses Scorching Ray again, but a nat 2 means one misses - Firebolt, another nat 2! - she gets it on the third try. Embarrassing...

The golems, maze and tea cup next, just like in practice. The maze is maybe a bit longer though. This time, she uses Invisibility and tries to navigate the maze. SUR 19+6 -> 25. She only has to sneak past two golems. ADV Stealth nat 20+2 -> 22 and 14+2 -> 16. It only takes one minute. She gets the teacup.

Now the traps, and some invisible terrain that's hard to see, which is a bit different from before. She hopes that Levitate will work and uses that to float up to the ceiling, then pulls herself along, hoping that'll circumvent range restrictions on self-moving. It's a little nerve-wracking but it works. She calls back, "I should've used Spider Climb, would've made more sense" - but she makes it, lowers herself and gets the saucer, but it takes another minute. She's about a couple of minutes in now.

The room reconfigures once more; the chasm, the platforms, a banner hanging from a string at the ceiling. But she can see it in advance this time. Then the platforms start to move; and as they move, they disappear. Different from before - more theatre, mostly and a bit more elevation overall. True Seeing, L6, to spot the platforms, but this time, the acrobatics that seemed so easy before are much harder now. She has to blow Heroic Inspo to not fall - only 14 with advantage. She can see into the Ethereal Plane, so can see that the steps are shifting in and out; she jumps, just about scrabbles on - another 14. Well, the dice gods are telling her this isn't a physical dexterity challenge and at only 3ft tall, the extra elevation of the "real" steps is tricky. OK, that's dumb. Maybe levitate will work; she tries pushing herself off the step and rising up at the same time, to get above one and drop down; it takes some practice to gets the distances right, it's messy and inelegant and she feels really stupid because it was child's play before.

It takes a while to figure out but she burns some time on it. It takes a good 3 to 4 minutes, so that's 6-7 in practice. Not great, but she's still in the game as she finally gets the flag. The room resets again. Oswen is angry with herself for making such a mess of it! But they say, "It really doesn't matter *how* you complete each step, so long as you *do* complete each step."

A pitcher of hot water is pulled out. Cup, saucer on cup, water in cup, flag in cup. Yuk, drink weird flag water! By now it's very clearly magical as the flag has sort of dissolved into it with arcane radiances clearly visible from the now-glowing liquid.

WIS save: Another bad roll. Only 12; Bardic 15. She's angry about her performance and mostly concerned about why she's done such a bad job so far. The area around her turns dark, low light; trees all around; the fey wild, but dark. Not Shadowfell, it's a clearly twisted version. About 50ft away there's movement in bushes. A small, red-hatted, red-robed person darting across a path. She walks in the direction it seemed to be going, since this is meant to be something to fight, she thinks? But the red-clothed creature was hardly scary. Then there's a flash of light ahead as four tiny lights dance around, surrounding her, a bit like will-o-wisps. The person in red comes out from behind a tree; it's a girl, show says "Stop following me!" - and it's Oswen, in red. A sort of malicious look. "You're not welcome here! You're an impostor!"

It looks like she's getting ready to cast a spell. Initiative: dirty 20...

..."Weird!" thinks Oswen, and starts low. L1 Chromatic Orb, lightning. 27 to hit, hits, 3d8->14 damage. It *seems* to take effect. "You cheated! You went before me!" says other-Oswen and casts Mage Armour. "You can't hit what you can't see!" she says, and runs behind a tree.

Oswen realises that True Seeing is up and this *is* a version of her. Not an illusion. It's a halfling wizard. She tries to reposition to see behind the tree. Easily seen. She's dug her hands into the ground... Interesting... Oswen's Levitate also brings her up 10ft when she sees *that*. She uses Scorching Ray again, L3 since the L2s are out, which means 4 rays; all hit; 26 damage. Whatever this other creature might be is *almost* bloodied but not quite. Quite hardy. Oswen's mostly worried about what she can do next; she's no idea what this person's capabilities are.

An emanation of fear comes outwards. She pulls undead out of the ground. Oswen has ADV on such WIS saves but the bad rolls keep coming - a 4 and a 4, so only 10 total. And she's already used both Heroic and Bardic (to not much useful effect), so that causes fear; intellectually she knows there's no rationality, but she's afraid anyway. A strange shadow finger now reaches out and touches Oswen. ADV WIS save this time - 21. It would've been a curse, she thinks (Bestow Curse).

So, Oswen has to drop down and tries to back away. But skeletons rise up out of the ground, so Oswen feels she has no choice but to go up as high as she can. She reaches the tree branches and pulls herself up further, as far as her movement will allow. ADV WIS save again; 22; she snaps out of it. She curses!

A skeleton starts to climb up the tree, quicker than it should.

The "red Oswen" steps out and sends arcane bursts towards Oswen. Purple-black, necrotic; all three hit, Oswen remembering in the back of her mind, "Oh, yes, I keep meaning to look up the Shield spell!" - and it's 34 necrotic. CON 18 by luck so, astonishingly, she holds onto Levitate. She's in a tree though so she responds in kind with L4 Scorching Ray. All five hit - and *two crit!* - 42 damage, all-in.

She knows that she might get hit again, so pushes away from the tree - it's a risk, but the skeleton is coming - not intending to hide, keeping her eyes on Red Oswen and pops up Manifest Mind right next to her.

Red Oswen starts to cast something and it looks *nasty* - a big circle of necrotic energy expanding - Counterspell! It succeeds, just! A nat 19 nearly, but rolled to a nat 1 on the CON 21 save at the last minute. The spell collapses. Red Oswen is very angry and spitting venom verbally.

"Sorry to keep doing the same thing but it works really well..." she calls; she uses L*5* Scorching and gets **_three crits_** in the rolls. Bizarre. 18d6! *61* damage. Red Oswen is burned up. It's *terrible* to witness. Screaming in agony and managing to make words; "You cause the world around you so much pain and you don't even know it. You! It's always been about you!"...

...the assessors are clapping and she's back in the room. "You faced your darkest fears - what you might become! And you prevailed!" they say. Oswen says nothing.

The group is reunited and Oswen is given a feather - a wing, that's pinned to her robe. "Oswen Hafflethwaite. You may choose an Arcanist's name. Will you go by Oswen, or will you give yourself an arcane name?"

"Arcanist Roslof", she says.

"Arcanist Roslof, welcome to the ranks of the High Netherese. May your magic keep the Empire aloft for a thousand more years."

It's Darian's turn. He's escorted in, but is by himself; just before he goes in, Oswen says "Bel, I'm sure you've got some nice words!" - so Bel does so, essentially granting Bardic Inspiration (that D10 rolls as a 9, which gets Darian over the Arcana check to get started). Less than a minute later, he steps out. And they ask for his name! He too has passed. He just keeps the name "Darian" - Arcanist Darian.

We are told we can go to the library and request a spell as a reward. Our names are apparently going into the Roster of Arcanists, and we can access the Enclave, all Academy sites on all cities, and so-on.

As we walk, we compare notes. A red-clothed version of himself, or herself. Settings varied but the actions blow-by-blow were more or less the same. Oswen was actually more freaked out by the horrible burning death - she *is* afraid of that. The setting for him was slums near the mine where he grew up; for her, the Fey, albeit twisted. ARC 24. The magic is not as powerful as they make it out to be. The tea - we both think - taps into a childhood setting. This nemesis is just a preprogrammed construct.

We're no longer injured after the time loop. "How low did you get?" she asks. "I got really badly injured. But I did bring a healing spell for myself. I've nothing left - I had to use just about everything." She nods. "It did hit hard." He says, "The circle of death nearly took me out" and she agrees; "I was lucky to Counter that". "I don't know that spell!"

We reach the library and are asked, "What spell would you like?"

Oswen can't resist. She asks for the Alternate Future scroll. She can't resist it; she realises she's unhurt, still feels a bit inspired by Bel's morning song, has full magic; it's wild. She has no way to explain what's *actually* happening with the weave but it's too good to miss! We're even given ink to copy the spell if we wish; of course for Oswen, she can do so quickly.

She gets some more time to read the book but is distracted a bit; heroic inspo -> no help; Bel helps. Bardic. She gets another chunk of reading sorted in the end.

Then... A mild earthquake! Strange alarms sound. We're told to run and get to the Enclave - and then they both teleport away! Oswen looks to Darian. "Do you trust me?" - she's thinking of using Teleport too.

But he says - "Huh? What? That's what happens - they teleport away...! The Phaerimm are attacking the city!"
