# Oswen: Part 2.7
## Campaign day 16, Sigil day 5, Emberbend outpost
### 10,225 XP for everyone for everything up until now. Closer to L9 than L8 now.

We've just finished overcoming the attack on the caravan.

Eventually, we all catch up with the caravan which has slowed right down. There are injuries; we help as much as we can with whatever resources we have left. They now have a escort guard, anyway and it's not far to Emberbend. One animal was badly injured but healed; everyone is exhausted; some cargo was lost - **but nothing was killed**.

On the way, the four of us chat about the battle - Oswen is *not* a fan of fire damage; and she found lots of damage types that didn't work reliably and few that did except Thunder, which is very noisy. Both and Bel and Inafina found radiant spell effects were good against against pretty much anything. Kindle too, with his spiritual weapon and divine strike. We think Force would work, given what we saw from others - quieter than Thunder!

Oswen points out that had it not been for the sheer luck of Banishment holding and for those helping, we'd probably have been done for and cautions the group that avoiding combat has to be our highest priority both in the outpost and the Hold.

We four of us are now resolute on one point: We want to rescue absolutely anyone we can. Nobody left behind.

Inafina and Jemima are quite close now, given their experience. Jemima says Inafina reminds her of her own monastery sisters, who were quick to help. She was impressed by Inafina's skill and channeling of inner strength. Inafina confides some of her history and how it was particularly meaningful for her to be fighting alongside another monk - something she thought might never happen again. Inafina reminds Jemima about Oswen's request for a "private word" and that seems more urgent than ever. Jemima is of course now very aware that there is more to us than meets the eye!

"Life is harsh. I grew up on a world that lies adjacent to the plane of fire. I escaped *through* that plane, as did Jordun. A savage world. There is nothing for us to go back to there. What you see around you here is paradise compared to where we come from."

Inafina goes quiet for a bit. Then says, "Well, even so, I'm sure you wouldn't want to see the people who endure it killed or put to even worse slavery..."

Jemima steals herself. She clearly has "thoughts" about her world! "All I know is that, at the end of the day, you gather around you the people who matter. You create your family. And you guard them with your life because beyond that nothing else really exists. Nothing matters. These bonds we have with each other are the only thing that survives."

Inafina nods - "I've had similar thoughts due to recent events. And I'd certainly guard you my own life, not because of any feeling of debt after today, but because of what I feel grows as friendship between us."

"Isn't it funny? I knew from the moment I saw you - I knew - well, I knew that if Loren sent you down to see us that you were worth paying attention to! But in my heart of hearts, when I saw the four of you standing out like a sore thumb, I knew instantly that you were like my people. You are one of us. I don't mean furry and cute (!) I mean... Inside."

"Well, yes. But we *are* also furry and cute."

We reach the gates. We point out that we can give up our room as we can sleep in a magical "hut" outside. Jemima doesn't think we need that; they'll use the market area as a triage. Then she seems to steal herself up, as if for something bad. Bart looks nervous too. The gates open; we head inside. The various inhabitants have come to move wagons and unload into the warehouse. Klax is there. The drivers and guards, the most exhausted of all, are immediately sent below. The horses are led into the warehouse - out of the worst of the heat, hopefully!

(Kindle whispers at one point to Jemima, "I can use magic to create a certain amount of water - I'd need to do it in private obviously - but it'll help with the horses and all the extra mouths to feed").

Some of the dock workers on "our side" are called to help set up big, tall tents so the horses can rest there; not just indoors. A bedraggled, exhausted caravan trader, holding onto his wagon just to keep standing, straightens himself up as best he can as Klax strides over and starts getting straight into negotiations for the arrived goods. At least we understand the language; Common. He's going from wagon to wagon, tutting, "This is not what we agreed on!" or checking amphora; "You've spilled water! Or used it perhaps! These are not full. Several crates are missing."

Kindle watches keenly. Insight 24. Klax doesn't seem to have been instrumental in this, but is *certainly* delighted to be able to seize this as an opportunity. He's pressing the issue while the wagon master is exhausted, as he's more likely to make a mistake.

We're all exchanging glances. Kindle is about to step forward, angered. Bel steps in - "Good sir, you are clearly exhausted! Allow me to barter on your behalf?" - he nods to Bart - "Shall we, friend? Let's get a good price for this follow!"

Klax is angered of course. "Who are you?! These are not your goods!"

The exhausted wagon master looks to Bart; Bart nods; the wagon master stutters for a moment, but then says, "I delegate the trade negotiations to you. Honestly - I need some rest!"

(Kindle starts casting Guidance on Bel the moment this all begins to kick off).

Bel is in his element. He stands up tall, dusts himself down - "Bart, if you may, please, the bill of lading?" - it's handed over. "Let's inspect. I hear you Klax; there is of course a shortage. I understand." So now Bel starts his own examination. Klax tries to argue about things, like quality; he gets increasingly aggravated. Inafina realises that if there was any plan to get on his good side to get on the boats, that's *certainly* long gone. Bel does at least stop Klax from ripping off the caravan! Then he tries something audacious - deception roll is 28! - he argues, "We were out there and we saw..." - he describes the attack - "...and I heard that this is *not* the first time it's happened..." (there's the deception) "...so this is a hazardous route. There should be a premium! Hazard pay! They risk their lives. Their animals are injured. People and animals nearly died. It's very treacherous getting goods out here to you. They should be compensated for that! They should be paid the original amount agreed, despite the losses."

Bel does promise to make up the shortfall in the water, as if it's a concession. "How?!" scoffs Klax. "We have our means! Leave that to us. Don't you worry about it - we'll get it done. But we will need some time." Klax tries to push for things to be loaded on boats immediately. Bel insists that we need the day to fully fill the water containers as agreed. Klax seems persuaded, but of course is full of threats and suspicions.

Good work. He's bought us the time he needs. And Oswen is almost relieved that there's definitely *no* option to try and "befriend" Klax now.

Oswen needs to find Jemima to talk ASAP but it's basically a field hospital down below. It's crazy, packed with people, all stalls removed; Kindle starts creating water, almost on automatic. The others start pitching in, but Oswen figures this is *nothing* compared to what's coming. She catches Jemima's eye and heads over. "I'm not sure there'll ever be a good time..." - but Jemima shushes her! "They're resting". She takes Oswen down a hallway that's where our room is. Oswen elects to go inside.

We get into it. Jemima makes some very good points - why do we trust our spy? Everyone on the Hold that considers it "home" is irredeemable. Our spy wants something. What?

* Maybe Vrakir is weakened by losing the book and our spy wants to take over - but he didn't seem like the type to fight both Vrakir and the 2IC.
* This brings a more sobering possibility - that the spy intends to either steal the book of us in turn (presumably at the cost of our lives), or even just double-cross us - hand us in, and gain favour.

Talk to Arden - he's clever. As for the attack? It would seriously disrupt the Hold - no water, no slaves. Who or what would want that? Talk to the caravan - neither of us can do better. We know it's not Klax because, Devils Vs Demons. They do NOT work together.

Outside, the others are looking across to us as we emerge. They look concerned; we look nervous. For one thing, Oswen figures talking to people who aren't quite as badly exhausted or injured for *anything* they saw might help. Their leader *is* in a mess but is refusing to lie down. He's worried about everyone. We try to get him aside, assure him we'll help, and after explaining (evasively, of course) who *we* are, more discussion flows.

* This *did* happen before (Bel didn't know)
* A smaller attack - hellhounds, the goat things; no giant; that time, they managed to outrun. Once they got within sight of the walls, the pursuers gave up
* They got home OK but that might be because they were very careful and only travelled at night
* Put down to just random treacherous conditions
* That's why they kept running this time - they hoped they could get close enough for the same thing to happen

We learn that Klax's boats are usually only at the Hold 2-3 days at most. By the time he returns, they are ready to go. They carry away *some* stuff, sometimes; tasked with taking items to other cities. Never asks them to transport high value things like the rubies though.

* All they had is water, food, wood for the mine...
* The mine - that's what the slaves do - doesn't know what they dig for

We're trying to argue that we will gain all the information we can to try and stop this happening again. But the leader understandably thinks that they might have to have a very difficult conversation with the outpost - they don't think they could risk coming again.

We talk to the three less injured. The same story. These three do think that the original "attack" wasn't really serious - their heart wasn't in it. So then Oswen wonders - reconnaissance? They saw the destination - yes, outpost - returned, came back with more forces. But this was a demon attack, apparently, yet (history 15) blood wars - now Jemima reminded her of all that - demons are not cunning. Devils would have elaborate strategies; demons would just throw *everything* at it. If they wanted to destroy, they'd do it. This caravan would have been destroyed last month if this was demons wanting to annoy devils.

So someone is pulling puppet strings here. (Which brings her mind back to Vecna, but with absolutely no proof).

These guys didn't notice anything much more. So now, we think, Arden. He's got books open, trying to figure out poultices! But that's more the domain of the husband and wife. We convince him to help us instead with our puzzle, to try and stop this happening again.

The TL;DR is we don't have enough pieces of the puzzle! Repeatedly, we are encouraged to talk to members of Klax's crew. They are the only ones who know what is going on over there. Our last piece is our "spy" - what might they get out of this?

* An Arcanaloth is neither a devil nor demon. A kind of "Ugoloth" (sp?). Another form of extremely sly, evil fiend.
* Very intelligent. Very powerful.
* They move on their own time, but enter into contracts for power; surprisingly - extremely lawful, though. Devils use this against them, trying to trick them into signing agreements that they later realise have them at a disadvantage. It ends up like a contest of wits.
* No reason for a creature so powerful to *serve* as a subordinate to an Efreeti. "Even one as powerful as it seems Vrakir and Jarazoun would be?"
* Well, why would they serve them? Perhaps they were tricked into a contract that forces them to. But then they couldn't help others to try and screw over the Efreeti. So, however their contract is worded, what they're doing is not enough to break it.
* Are we being manipulated to do something they can't do?

**Now at the top of our suspicions**: Nebukath wants us to steal the book because for whatever reason of presumed contract he can't, but would then steal it from us.

* It was Nebukath who arranged the attack most likely - but not certain - kill the caravan, the slaves die, Vrakir has to go on another raid, so he's away from the Hold. Much easier to steal things.

One other thing - if we liberated the slaves, it'd enrage Klax and Merregon because their contracts with which they are "paid" are for the *slave* souls and the slaves have to die for those contracts to be cashed it.

We move on. Who else might have ideas? Well, Bart has been talking with the caravan, knows how the trade works, was involved in the battle... And besides, he might be a bit shaken by the battle, which was certainly touch-and-go. We seek him out. He's now talking to the caravan master. They're having that difficult discussion we were told about already!

Bart is saying - "I understand - in fact I would insist. It's not worth your life! You are an old friend of mine. Why would I wish this upon you?" "Well, we've had this arrangement a long time. It's good for you, no?" "Yes, it is; but so is you being alive!" "So what will you do now?" "I will travel... I knew my time here was limited. So long as this uneasy arrangement existed, I saw a need to be here. A need to keep people alive. But there's not much more I could do. I am no longer the person who this community needs; I can no more ask you to stay than kill you myself! There's nothing for you to apologise for; it is I who must apologise to these people here who have relied on me. For I am about to let them down. That is on me. You and I? We are not over - we will continue to trade - to build our empire! Just in a different place. I knew this day would come." Bart squeezes his friend's arm. "But for now, you must rest! Stop this ridiculous running around... Or you *will* expire!"

Once Bart is done we find a quiet corner. He thanks us for our part in the battle. We suggest we play a part in the problem; our mere arrival; he likens it to the last few grains of sand landing atop a dune, that cause the sand to slide.

Inbound? Food, water, mining tools - this caravan. On alternate two weeks, Bart arranges a caravan of metal and luxuries. He's not moved much since he knows who that's for... Metal can be formed into manacles and chains. Luxuries like wines and sweets - for other Efreetis and their Erinyes. The food brought in isn't just for the slaves, though that is why we want it to go there; the Duergar eat too. They're the only other ones that do. The wood - a lot of wood goes over there - I believe most of it is consumed (as in eaten) by beings that survive on combustion. Salamanders and fire elementals. Slaves perish before long but the outpost does what it can to send as much food and water as possible. Most fall to exhaustion; or some are eaten by the dragon. "We like to believe we're doing what we can from afar but unless we can rescue them we are merely prolonging their agony."

Oswen cuts into that sentence. "We intend to". "If by some iceberg's chance in a river off lava you are able to do what you say, if your heart leads you to do this, then my friend here I'm sure would be more than happy to arrange safe passage for them out. He need merely stay until you return." (He means Jordun). "But if you *were* to do that, everyone *else* would need to get out too!" - and we point out that our *original* plan probably meant that anyway. Well, he will speak to the wagon master... Like us, he thinks there are options with the caravan. He doesn't know about the dragon though.

"There are a couple of obstacles though!" he says (only two?!) - "First, the quite stubborn women who run the show; secondly, there's Orta and Llena". Oswen says we have ideas about that. Bart will talk to Tatoun. And if we can get Loren to go, Arden will go. Else he won't.

"Talk to Loren" he insists. We must. And Jordun, too, is very important in all of this.

We head upstairs, to the bar, under the guise of being thirsty or hungry after battle. We don't know how busy the bar will be and talking to Loren could be tricky.

Klax and the rival group led by Meregon are both there. As we arrive, Klax notices us and works us into his complaints to his wider group - "these meddlers are going to cost me a pretty penny, keeping me waiting here". Oswen can't help it and fires back, "Easy to say. But we both know that if the caravan tried to leave exhausted and got attacked again, they'd be killed. And a dead caravan is bad for business!" but Klax of course doesn't give ground. He argues he should be at the Hold now, refilling his boat. Meregon laughs. "Why are you so concerned? I thought you had that place stitched up! It should not matter if you are there today, tomorrow or the day after - unless, of course, you're afraid that someone *else* might beat you there."

Klax argues time is money! He manages to work that into yet *another* angle arguing that his crew would be better off joining him.

"I've had enough!" says Meregon, standing. "Fine. Anyone who wants to go with Klax? Be my guest! But those of you with more than an once of self-determination - come with me. We will leave dock and get out of here."

(Contested roll vs Klax behind DM screen)

"You fool! Never give them a choice! Those who join me will receive double pay for the first *year*!"

At this... Meregon loses *his entire crew*. They all decide to defect! There really isn't much we can do, even though it's a bad blow to us - any last glimmer of ideas we might've had regarding Meregon and the Hold could be lost. Meregon tries again, to save face; but again, fails. The two get into each other's faces, things getting very heated. Loren interjects - "NOT in here! Take it outside, right now!" - there's only Meregon and one bodyguard left. Doesn't look good.

They both charge out... And the crew follow. We seize the opportunity - we don't know who to help or how and we now have an opportunity to speak to Loren. Orvil is stationed at the door to report on what happens outside.

Oswen asks Loren if we should be doing anything about that. "This has been boiling for the last year and a half! It was always going to come to a head. It was foolish for Meregon to try, anyway. I bet you he was going to sneak ahead to the Hold while he was sure that Klax was delayed."

Oswen then launches somewhat breathlessly into what we're here to do. Of course this discussion doesn't go well. It's more that Loren is pretty sure we'll die and they must evacuate *now*. Not a question of wanting to stay! We just don't know enough about the Hold and, via a few questions, Loren is well aware. She agrees to talk to us tonight after closing; it's not secret knowledge; but either way, she'll start the process of checking things are in place for a rapid evacuation. She seems largely unsurprised - this isn't the first time they've had to bail on a location and indeed she seems so prepared that she must've been almost *expecting* it. She seems to have surprisingly little connection or care for this physical place, the bar.

We definitely do *not* have any kind of viable plan, that much is very, very clear.

People start to come back from outside. Loren cuts off talking and returns to work. We return to our table, to finish our food and drink. Klax is covered in ichor - steaming - he has gashes along his arm, but is in high spirits. He heads up to Loren and says he'll buy everyone a drink (again). He looks to us. "Even YOU meddlesome rodents!"

Orvil is still hiding near the door. Oswen "connects" to get a quick summary. There was of course a fight; Klax severely injured both Meregon. The bodyguard claimed Klax was cheating, but Klax, mortally offended - he is NOT a cheat or liar - killed the bodyguard outright. At this, Meregon attacked in full fury, but was wounded so badly that he had to portal away. Klax has now declared himself the owner of Meregon's boat, too. Oswen pops Orvil back into the demiplane so he can't be spotted flying back to her and relays the info in whispers to the group.

Kindle, insight nat 20 + 7, is trying to figure out how to crew all three of the boats. It's what he's always wanted, but he needed the extra hands. He has almost got them. He's gained 5, but needed all 7. Kindle says, "I'm big enough to move one of those poles; and between the two of you" - he looks at Inafina and Bel - "and you could be a second person." Bel argues we're not his favourite person!

But that's the key. Now is the time! Klax is on a high. He expects people to fawn at him. We've seen it done before. He's got us drinks.

* Oswen is the leader, our history is our own but the other three follow us
* We're in it for the money. We made our play with the caravan, Meregon was going to be in on it, but Klax beat us
* So he needs bodies? We need cash. We're in.
* Bel's our negotiator. Klax has seen him in action before.
* Kindle's the muscle. Inafina? Lighting fast. Good at emptying pockets!

Now is the time. Oswen and Bel take their free drinks and approach Klax, opening with thanks and contrite admissions of our shortcomings in recognising who was truly the strongest force in this outpost.

Bad start - ADV deception Bel, (1,2)+10 -> 12, at least with Guidance +4, 16. But Klax insists as a result of this that he talk to Oswen. So Oswen starts the pitch, Deception ADV (19,1)+3 -> 22. Guidance is only on Bel!

"Hmm. Well. I will agree. BUT. This one here" (Bel) "cost me close to 800 gold today." Bel protests; Oswen snaps, "Quiet! He's dealing with me!" - and Oswen nods. "Seems fair." "So, 800 gold off your share?" "Yes!"

Bel wonders what our share is... He hasn't said. And he doesn't. Oswen is happy to *pay* 800gp outright to get this mission done.

Klax says, "Now, I don't know if you're trustworthy or not, but just to be safe..." - he waves his hands and "pulls" runes out of the air. A scroll appears. He sears words into it, signs it and hands it to Oswen. "Have a think about it" he says. "I'm sure you'll require some of your... *claimed* magical skills to read this document. Take your time. I'm going to have another drink!"

We return to the table, Oswen makes people do a show of toasting as if doing a good deal, then Bel tells her that she really should read the contract! She fast-ritual (spellbook feature) casts Comprehend Languages.

She tries to find the literal wording - what it *does* mean, not what it *might* - and how we can match the letter of it, and still do our mission; or better yet, get out of it. This amounts, after reading, to a religion check. 19+5 with Bardic d8 +4 -> 28 total.

* It lasts for one journey. The protection Klax provides as part of the crew lasts only until we return to Emberbend. At that point, the contract is renegotiated.

* We will receive a share based on the spoils; 800gp will be deducted. If the share is already 800gp or less, then we will owe the balance.

* We are bound by contract not to steal anything from Klax. We must not take any of the bounty for ourselves. We are, unless invited, not to negotiate with Jarazoun or Vrakir. Klax is the only leader of the party.

* Should the contract be broken by us, then the cost is a year's servitude to Klax for whoever signs it from our side. If Klax were to (somehow!) break it, then he is beholden to a request of honour, bound by law.

Oswen copies the contract in Common as she deciphers it.

The wording at the end is curious; that last one seems ill-defined, wide open to a lot of things, as if he didn't really worry about that ever happening. It's a bit of a trick too though, as one might speak inadvertently and have that *taken* to be the request even if you didn't mean it as such.

That Religion roll - there aren't hard-and-fast rules. Try to be aware of possible loopholes; for example, maybe we could claim we *borrowed* the boat to get back to Emberbend and left it for Klax at the dock in perfect condition. But the wording of the contract varies between very specific and really quite vague, which is likely deliberate; and it has been translated, albeit well, but something will have been lost in that.

Discussions are tense for a while. If we sign - point of no return.

Oswen's party all believe in each other. This is extremely high risk. She believes in the threat of Vecna, and believes what the Vault said about this book. There's really only one course of action she can see.

She walks to Klax's table. "Where do I sign?" "Ah! Here!" - a pen appears in mid-air; she signs; the contract rolls up in flames, but doesn't burn. He opens his jacket and puts it into a strange pocket, looks like maybe a bag of holding vibe; but she *just* (perception 14) spots other scrolls there.

"We will depart tomorrow at midday. I expect you on the dock at least an hour before to help with loading."

"Understood."

We finish drinks. Kindle is glum and concerned. Bel surprisingly is optimistic; he has to be. Inafina is more aligned with Kindle; "It's going to be very difficult for *us* to exploit any loopholes and very easy for him. He has a lot more practice!" But what choice do we have?

We all want to go and check in on the people from the caravan though Kindle's expression of that is really more a question of getting away from devils in a bar.

We head downstairs. Bel chats. He tries to keep us up. "We found a way! To get over there, and maybe even to get back? That's good, right?" "That's good, yes" says Oswen, but sends Bel and Inafina on ahead. She catches Kindle's hand. "I hope you don't think less of me; I'm not comfortable dealing with someone so... So *awful*." Kindle's more about being worried that he can't help her, if something goes wrong. There's been a loss of control in favour of the contract. Kindle is unusually forthright about his desire to kill Klax - Oswen can only agree! - but he's never been the murderous type.

Now we're down below, there's one thing we must focus on - the escape plan *here* - evacuation. For this, we seek first Jordun. It turns out, though, that we already started the ball rolling a while ago and, especially after speaking to Loren, we don't need to do anything much to convince people to leave. They can't wander off alone into the desert - likely death - but leaving as a group? That's a very different proposition. None of the seem to want to stay here. Without doubt, Loren's attitude to leave has convinced everyone else.

With that in mind, we go to Orta and Llena. They're concerned that if their adoptive son **Malek** comes back here, he would be worried about them. He wouldn't be rash and get himself into trouble, of course, but he just wouldn't know where he is. If they're not trapped they can contact him, *once* they reach a destination with that ability. Maybe Oswen this time is doing this selfishly? For herself, to feel good, after this Devil's deal? Either way, they like the idea. They sit to write a message and clearly have done it before! Messaging services must be familiar to her.

She relays their message - the important part is them saying that they are leaving Emberbend and they'll let him know where they settle. She sends it and does get a reply - after a few minutes - it's a very clear response, as if he wrote it down or used a standard format (again, he must be very familiar with messaging services). It feels a bit odd relaying quite personal and family-intimate message, but basically confirms reception and looks forward to seeing them again. He certainly seems happy to have heard from them after quite some time, while they've been in Emberbend and unable to send anything out.

We regroup, rest a little, except Bel who's stayed in the room and seems to want to be isolated. Oswen fiddles with her spellbook (Fog Cloud swaps for Thunderwave, since it's L1 & thus Chromatic Orb lets the damage type change to something quieter if need be).

Oswen seeks Bel. He's mumbling to himself, deep in thought... "I'm sorry to interrupt... Are you OK?" "I'm fine! Of course, uuuh - I was just trying to figure things out. To think." We get into a bit of discussion and Oswen fetches the others - it's a huddle. What are going to do?!

Hours pass. No solutions. Very little progress at all in fact.

Loren eventually arrives - it's taken us that long.

* The slaves; dozens of different kinds of beings - Loren has no idea how many, but she's heard numbers as high as 50
* The workers; maybe 6 different kinds of being
* There are guards as well as the dragon on the upper deck (overall at least a dozen)
* Guard towers are *all* manned with Erinyes; devils, but not Cambians like Klax - less crafty - warriors
* Crew do unload on the lower dock and transfer things once lifted by crane on the upper platform to store rooms
* Very dour duergar - work crews and even small communities (overall at least a couple of dozen)
* Salamanders (elementals) - native to the area
* Vrakir, the "tyrant" and Jarazoun, 2IC
* Many legends spoken of the "eye" of the Efreeti, which protects the most important parts of the Hold - **it's a Beholder**

Loren could try to give us more details, but it seems hopeless. Oswen holds up a hand, shakes her head, thanks Loren; but then sheds a tear. Kindle looks alarmed and holds her shoulder but she manages to say, "No, not sadness. Not directly, anyway. It's frustration and anger and - a fair bit of fear... I can't do it. I just cannot go there and leave them. Yes, if we don't get the book" (she's not even been careful with her words, in this moment) "everyone dies. But they die anyway. They die worse, if we leave them. I don't see how the Vault can put the fate of everything in existence on our four shoulders, with such vague wording, so few instructions, so few words, and no items of aid; just some gold pieces and a contact who's going to try to kill us. This isn't on us. It has to be on them. I refuse to accept that we have no choice. We always have one. If we fail this, if everyone does die, then I'll be damned sure I'm at Leonidas' side when Toril falls. And then the gods can judge me. But I won't accept judgement otherwise."

She looks to Loren. "You said it. Your words. We can't lose ourselves."

A sigh. "We can't fight. Any kind of battle happens and, likely, we bring the Hold down on our heads. The force is overwhelming. We die. We could sneak. That *might* work. For all the theoretical power of wards and scrying, a *beholder* on watch, by all the gods, and the likely betrayal of Nebukath - *maybe* it works. We get in, Dimension Door out, walk across that upper platform like we're meant to be there. But it relies on pure, unguessable luck. The boats must depart at just the right expected moment, else our early departure raises alarm. The boats must depart before Nebukath thinks we've surely been gone too long, yet no alarm has been raised, and goes to check for himself. How long would he wait? Surely, mere minutes. We'd need to get back to the docks, be on board and departing. And then we'd get attacked anyway. The dragon, the Efreeti; who knows what else. Every last detail would need perfect luck and perfect execution and even *then*, we'd likely be caught in the escape. For sure, Bel, we'd need to somehow lure the dragon here *tomorrow* and fight it, then do all this in the Hold with whatever we had left of ourselves after such a battle."

"So that's as close to a 'no' as makes no difference. No fight, no sneak. That leaves something we considered before, but discarded because success is unknowable. We don't know the people - the *creatures* involved well enough, their motivations or their weaknesses. But maybe, just maybe, we can try educated guesses, in part based on what we witnessed here, just today."

* These alliances of evil are balanced finely, based on either contracts, or fear, or playing a long game.
* Contracts have loopholes. Devils spend their time trying to exploit them and one-up each other.
* **Seeding doubt**: Jarazoun doesn't overthrow Vrakir. Either he can't figure out how without breaching a contract, or he isn't strong enough.
* **The leverage on that**: The young Red is promised a hoard and slaves, but red dragons usually hunger for more; their power grows with their hoard. Vrakir is *giving away* untold riches right now. We might seed doubt - Jarazoun and the young Red working together. Jarazoun says he just wants the book. He cares nothing for the Hold, would give it and the treasure to the young Red as a lair.
* **Seeding more doubt**: Of course, Jarazoun doesn't trust the Red not to attack and get the book too - it must be valuable, if Jarazoun is so keen on *only* having that object. Likewise, the Red doesn't trust Jarazoun; if he has the ear of more people here, he might mount an attack. Or perhaps that must-be-powerful book he speaks of would give him the ability to kill the Red single-handed.
* **Wild card**: We know nothing about Beholders. We don't know why it's there or stays. If it got wind that (allegedly) Jarazoun would happily give the whole thing away to a dragon, perhaps it would be angered.
* **The duergar, half a plan** treat this as work and home. They might just cut their losses and flee if they realise it's all coming down. How are *they* getting out? That could be important.
* **The guards, no plan yet**: No idea why they're there. But if we can have them distracted as part of a wider battle it'd be useful.
* **Unknown**: The mine. It's not on the map. Why? Where does it go? Is there possibility of escape?

Our primary goal is as much violent disruption as possible. We want all primary factions on that Hold in all-out war, ideally. Having the Hold destroy itself would be a perfect outcome but is well beyond what we might reasonably expect to achieve.

We still don't know how we get out. In the confusion, we might get to that drawbridge. And from there might be able to move islands. That certainly gets us out the easiest. Water for 50? Kindle can make some 10gal, just under 40L, of water a day. That would be less than half the water needed for a single day to keep the slaves alive in the desert. We don't know the distance from landfall even *if* we did get the islands moving.

The ships look like a no-go. Yes, we could save a few slaves that way and get directly back to Emberbend (or just downstream - contract loophole, Klax must offer his "usual protection" until we return there), true. But there might be a run on the boats - Klax and his own crew, plus perhaps the duergar, if people are fleeing due to chaos we cause.

**We can't speak to Meregon** - it's his boat - maybe? He might know the rules of ownership. But he's not just teleported, we realise, after Oswen "looked at" Orvil's memories of the fight more clearly. It was a plane shift; he retreated back to one of the Hells, or something like that.

And another issue - we've **forgotten about the Trade Master and his dark spirit** who will doubtless react very badly to the Hold falling and the town evacuating. Loren's escape plan includes that, she's happy enough about their stealth approach, but we can't just subsequently blunder back into town and expect to walk out as if nothing had happened.

Loren suggests now is a good time to talk to Jordun. She will fetch him; brings him back and wishes us good night.

Jordun first talks about their own escape plan. Loren's plan is quite well known and he's happy with that. He's *not* going to go to the Hold, too risky and he's needed here. We easily agree. Next, we ask - as tactfully as we can - about the condition of the slaves.

* We of course acknowledge that much will have changed since he was there.
* He sits and thinks a while about what might be important or useful.
* "I really hope my people are still there. If they are, your problems will pale compared to their ability."
* He thinks they'd be strong enough to fight, and very much minded to, but would lack weapons.
* Access to weapons there is of course between difficult and impossible.
* If his clan is there, he would hope that one of the leaders may still be alive; but Jordun suspects, given the elapsed time, probably not. **He names a few - Oswen writes those down.**
* When new groups arrive, there is actually often infighting and animosity; species or individuals might even be mortal enemies outside the Hold and it takes a while to balance back to a truce, even as slaves.
* The rescue does not need to be passive. If we can kickstart and uprising they could help a lot, but we need to keep the Big Bad off their back - especially the dragon.
* They need a means to fight.

Kindle and Inafina listen closely (Inafina ADV perception 24). She asks if any form of uprising or riots have happened before? And what about his method of "escape" - the rules?

* He got out due to a wager between a trader and the Hold, regarding exchange of slaves; and people wanted entertainment.
* Such things are rare; he seized the opportunity.
* There *have* been prior rebellion attempts, obviously, but they are usually put down quickly by the *Duergar* guards - the duergar are really only there to be jailers. The Erinyes, he remarks, don't get involved; he's not even sure what they're for. They seem to never leave their posts, just staying in watch towers. They do sometimes tease/torment the slaves but otherwise nothing much.
* There is one in particular that he has a special hatred for - the one stationed in the watchtower over the prison yard (leftmost corner, overlooking the main work area).
* Big blocks are hauled there from the elemental plane of earth. Wood is used to build scaffolds that are used to mine the rocks. Vrakir and Jarazoun have magic that allows them to get up there and pull the big blocks down from the elemental plane boundary.
* Kalimrax isn't there to do that. Instead, he seems to watch the skies. He lairs above the strange "sculpture" of Vrakir's face (on the right of our map). Spends a lot of time up there. Just as well; if wandering around on the upper platform, everyone has a bad day. He's very bored! Entertains himself in cruel ways. He used to eat the slaves, but Jordun thinks that actually annoyed Vrakir and now this only happens if it seems "justified" - a slave offends him, say - otherwise "he reserves his malice for the workers who come on the ships". Oh, yay.
* Kalimrax is of course very arrogant; thinks highly of himself as red dragons tend to; he and Vrakir do clash often but for some reason Kalimrax seems to ultimately defer to Vrakir.
* Vrakir sometimes stands up on the platform boasting of his might, especially if he comes back from a conquest and "fresh haul".
* Jarazoun really runs the Hold. People usually negotiate Jarazoun. Vrakir's army marches out the front gates and goes away for weeks, comes back briefly for maybe a week, then leaves again.
* He hardly ever saw the Salamanders, but once, at the height of a rebellion attempt, they popped up onto the ridge, as if looking to see things were getting out of control. They watched and once the duergar got things under control, they went away again.

Oswen, religion, dirty 20, on Erinyes: Very powerful devils. They are not foot soldiers. Klax is a Cambian, who are she thinks technically lesser. She realises that Klax ought not to be that scary compared to an Erinyes! She recalls that all Erinyes are subjects of Azmodeus. He is a fallen Seraph (high angel) and brought the Erinyes with him when he Fell. They're all beautiful and statuesque, but actually filled with hatred. They wish to corrupt everything... Ultimately, they are unwaveringly loyal to Azmodeus. If they are there, it's probably because Azmodeus instructed them to be so. Oswen is sure that, as might be expected really, they can see invisibility and through illusions, don't really get affected by elemental damage - lightning, fire, cold - and while susceptible to silver, are resistant to other physical damage.

It is, in her best guess, unlikely then that the Erinyes are taking orders from Vrakir. She voices this; Jordun agrees - "They are all very beautiful - very striking! You can readily tell them apart from one another. Now, each seems to occupy a different tower. One each. Only one tower is occasionally empty, except when on high alert - the one behind the gates (the inward-most one of the 'triangle' at the main gate). But he doesn't know where that tower's Erinyes normally is, when not at the tower. The others though perpetually seem to be stationed at their towers and don't seem to sleep!

He mentions a bit of detail about the Erinyes who messed with slaves before - they use a whip of entanglement, just to mess with them. Not much use to quell an uprising, one at a time!

That seems to be all we can really learn. Jordun has been amazing, though it seems to have added as many questions as it answered! We might need to prove ourselves, though; is there anything he can give us, or tell us, to help? Well if he *gives* us something, we could just have killed him for it. But he's also confused; they would surely be willing to fight at any chance. Oswen is worried they'd be paranoid, think it was a trick; but *if we give them arms* they will fight, whatever their suspicion! In his culture, that's the most valuable thing you could do.

The last thing we ask is if Jordun knows where weapons might be found *here*. We have a few that we could give away. He has a few too. We try to convince him to ask the others for anything they can spare.

He leaves. We're alone. Divination? To see if Vrakir might be at the Hold? This reminds Oswen of MK's divination - Oerth and Toril already beyond hope. But if she can't save her own world, would not the pain of that motivate her even more to spare others of such a feeling? Kindle is interested and plucks up courage to ask - he talks to Yondalla when he uses that spell. But who does *she* talk to?

Oswen looks blank. "I... Never thought of it. I've just asked."

Kindle puts his head to one side. "Isn't there a God for knowledge? Oghma?"

Oswen sits looking open-mouthed for a minute. "I have God? I must have a God. I never worshipped anyone. I'm aware there are many, but I didn't realise or didn't *think* that there might be one listening."

Well, she thinks a while, a tries to come up with a question. "Oghma... Will Vrakir be at Brimstone Hold within the next 72 hours of now." It takes a while for the ritual, the room gets smoky.

The smoke coalesces to show a hellish landscape - it changes colour, to all black-and-red instead of grey-and-white; burning trees, flaming boulders in front of a castle built into the side of a mountain. Defenders are present. An Efreeti stands at the head of an army of Salamanders, Imps and more, pushing to attack. **He will not be there**.

And that's it; the vision fades.

Oswen clears her throat. "Well, that's unexpected - and a very direct answer. That's our first clear good news in a while."

A knock at the door. It's Jordun. **He has another 6 weapons with him!** That's great. We wrap and stash them carefully in the bag of holding. "The caravan guards wish they could offer you more but their weapons are in scabbards and chests on the caravans - none of them want to risk going into the warehouse to get them!"

Each chest has another 6 weapons in - some 18 in all. A tempting target for a night raid.

"Loren suggested you were struggling to find a way to get all of the slaves out".

"Yes. It's hard enough even to get *ourselves* out without being killed in the effort."

"I never thought that would be something you would try to solve - it would be very difficult for any one person to try and solve getting 50 slaves out as their job! The plan with any rebellion would always be to overpower the defenders and escape. They would probably try and escape out of the front gate. That's the highest capacity route out. To do so, they would need to be sure that the defenders don't slaughter them as they run. So the biggest hope you could offer would be to occupy the defenders and give them a chance to get away."

Well, the Erinyes - tricky - really. As for the dragon...

Bel's plan. It has to be. Bel convinces us - yes - and tonight's the night. We'll go to the old ruins. They're behind a ridge and red flaring light would look perfectly normal in the night.

He plays music while we rest longer. It's late, but not too late.

As we start to head out, we find Tatoun there. He's packed and ready. "I've one other thing I'm able to give you. But I want it back!" - he produces a sort of robe, almost a cloak; it's what we caught a glimpse of before. Not scales, perhaps skin? Either way, fire resistance. It's extraordinary looking. Essentially a very soft leather. He tells us it's made from a dragon wing. It would give some stealth advantage at the Hold, in that fire-y environment, too.

We run out. One hour to the ruins. We choose Oswen to swap attunement of the Helm to the new cloak. Bel is given the potion of fire resistance as a backup plan, while Inafina's dodging is good and she'll try and draw literal fire.

Once there, Bel tells Oswen what to say to goad the dragon. Kindle offers some Guidance too. The ruins are close; Oswen casts and does her best. Unfortunately ADV deception is only (1,9) -> reroll 1 is only a 5 -> only 12 total, D4 Guidance is only a 1, **result is only 13**. Kalimrax is shocked at being contacted out of the blue at all; Bel was trying to convince it we'd uncovered a plot against it and accuse it of being a fool to be deceived by Vrakir for so long. We're at the ruins with a better offer. The response is along the lines of, "How dare you puny wizard presume upon what Kalimrax knows or thinks? I won't parley; I will come to eat you!"

So, it's coming to attack with no chance of surprise. Hunker down, using what we can of ruins for cover - and wait. And it's a long wait! Half an hour passes and we're getting nervous, and Perception rolls are very low for Inafina and Oswen but Kindle sees a silhouette against the fire in the background (perception 22).

Kindle elects to stand out, in the open and casts Protection From Energy L3 on himself since he intends to stand out in the clear and attract the first attack deliberately! Then he casts L3 Aid, too for everyone else; we're bolstered by 10hp. We have to stay close enough, at least, to be within his Twilight Sanctuary as well. We move our cover positions to be as close as we can. But Kindle has no chance of dodging fire breath and would take a lot of damage, so Oswen quietly steps into clear view a distance off to the side. Inafina's meant to be dodging things, and tries to grab Oswen's cloak to stop her, but it's Oswen that goaded the dragon. It's Oswen the creature knows. She casts Light on her staff, getting up onto a bit of a plinth on the ruins. Inafina crouches close behind.

Initiative:

* Inafina 27
* Bel 23
* Kindle 10
* Oswen 4

Inafina has her own plans, despite Oswen and Kindle trying to draw its ire. It gets within about 100ft, swooping down, flying low. It might even land. She dashes up and outwards, 90ft total, trying to draw the dragon even wider of Oswen and Kindle. Two radiant bolts miss the mark, one wildly, but she's certainly made herself known.

Bel moves to the edge of his cover range and throws Bardic Inspiration to Inafina. This means he's moved out of Kindle's spell range along with Inafina. Only Oswen remains in potential range. He's brought himself out in the open too, so gives up any notions of stealth and casts Mirror Image. Suddenly - four Bels.

The dragon picks a target... (D4 roll)... Inafina. "Delicious fools! I love roast rabbit!" - out goes the fire breath. DEX save. She rolls very low -> 12 and heroic inspiration is a nat 1; she adds Bardic; d8->6, total 18, and *that* is enough. She rolls completely clear, no damage. The dragon now changes focus - Oswen, with her lit staff aloft and flies at her. It moves in fast - it's only 20ft away horizontally. Looks like an ~80ft flying speed. It's still in the air, maybe 20ft up and back.

This is quite intimidating! Kindle steps sideways, in front of Oswen, raises his shield, mace raised and since he does have Twilight Sanctuary, we're in dim light & he can fly up via Steps Of Night. He goes up almost the full 30ft and attacks directly with the mace; 25 to hit; 11 damage. "How *dare* you" roars the dragon. Oswen then tries Scorching Ray but converted to cold; two of three rays hit for 16 damage; she shouts, "Cold works!", and jumps down off the plinth for a bit of cover. 13 temp HP added from the Sanctuary.

Inafina gets in close and tries to hit twice with the staff. Nat 3, nat 3. Both miss. Flurry of blows. An unarmed strike hits for max 13 damage but a Stunning Strike CON save is made easily. The next attack is at least at advantage, hits but low roll this time, 8 damage. At least her Cloak of Displacement is still active and helping her if the dragon tries to counterattack. Inafina is back in the Twilight Sanctuary so she gets 1d6+8 -> 5+8 -> a very good 13 temp HP.

Bel sees Inafina struggling. Another Bardic Inspiration her way. Fey Touched -> gives Bless to Inafina too, himself and - tries for Oswen, unsure if she's in range. He sees that we're starting to get rather clustered together, himself having run into range of Kindle's spell; so then he chooses to jump over a chunk of ruins to give us some separation. He's just still within the aura range, gaining 10 temp HP.

Dragon - breath weapon not restored; "Where have you run you *sneak*?" he shouts and lands heavily onto the ruin plinth where Oswen had been stood; ignoring Kindle, looking around; sees Oswen. He leans forward and claws down but this gives attacks of opportunity from Inafina - she hits for 12 bludgeoning with the staff, 3 lightning charges 3d8 -> only 7 on top. Kindle's attack misses sadly. The dragon is now clawing at Oswen. Claw, claw, bite; 22, 21, 27. 11 slashing; 15 slashing; 3->1 (cloak) fire; 10 more piercing. She's left with 31hp.

Kindle now jumps to attack Kalimrax from behind, flanking in essence; "You leave her alone you big bully!" - manages a hit with Divine Strike for 13 more damage. Then he casts Healing Word, 7hp for Oswen. Oswen shouts, "I think discretion is the better part of valour right now" - Disengages, retreats her max of 30ft, hiding behind Kindle; d6+8 temp HP -> 9 this time.

Inafina tries sh*t talking the dragon to get its attention, positions to flank - she's on the plinth - and attacks with the staff. Even without rolling advantage - CRIT, 3 charges blown; 13+27 -> 40 points total! Second attack hits conventionally, 13 damage (again); 3 more charges, 15 more damage; Focus Point, flurry of blows - hits twice, once thanks only to Bless; 12 and 9 more damage. Her temp HP maintains at 13.

Bel looks at the dragon. "No, It is *your* mistake to think you could outsmart *us*! We would never intent to parley with such a foul creature as you - we lured you here to your death!" - he casts L3 Cloud Of Daggers right into its space. 6d4 piercing -> 16. "Yes!" continues Bel. "You die here today!" - Bardic back to Oswen.

The dragon thankfully once again does not get the breath weapon back. This time he tries to do is buffet us down with his wings. STR save, but with d4 for Bless. Inafina: 15 with Bless, 20 with Bardic. She holds fast. Oswen rolls high on the save and only 1 on the d4, but 18 total is enough. Kindle unfortunately only gets 10 - he's shielding Oswen - and is knocked down. Bel's too far away to be influenced by the effect. Now the dragon tries to escape - it starts to take off.

Only Inafina and Oswen can try an attack of opportunity. Inafina swings her staff - but Inafina just misses. Oswen grabs her magic dagger from her belt and gets a hit for 4 damage. It seems woefully inadequate; the dagger sinks into a wound on the dragon's neck. The dragon arcs up, pulling the dagger out of her hand and draws in air for its fire breath - which it gets; but this causes the injured neck to explode! The lifeless body now plummets down onto the ruins, Inafina (DEX save dirty 20) managing to dodge out of the way at the last split second as Kindle shouts a warning down on the ground, still prone.

### 3875XP -> LEVEL 9 for starting evacuation, starting weapons plan and dragon defeat

It's past midnight. Much as we'd like to harvest the dragon, we need to *try* and get up early to fetch weapons from the warehouse. Might be impossible during the day but we have to try... So, we pack up and head as quickly as we can back to the outpost. Kindle with Inafina's help knock out a tooth (!), not for weaponry, but for "proof of kill" - Oswen thinks Jordun, if nobody else, will appreciate it. The tooth that falls that is bigger than she expected! Won't be a necklace, that's for sure.

About 1:30am (Toril equivalent time, best estimate) we arrive back. It is of course quiet. Guards on the wall are confused and challenge us. We're covered in blood! Oswen makes out that we tried to hunt in the desert for different food and found a strange beast but it got away from us - Deception 17 seems good enough; we are allowed inside. We go straight down via the stairs near the gate. We get some strange looks from the carvan folk camped up there as we stride through! To our surprise in the central area, we find *all* of the residents, tending to people. We give the tooth to Jordun; there's a brief discussion about tomorrow (maybe someone can organise a dockside distraction in the morning to help us); and a **target location of waiting at the ruins is agreed**. The caravan will once healed; it'll be a bit risky as they'll be unusually leaving without goods (as they must go before we return) but we'll have to chance it and hope the guards here don't stop them. Jemima and Loren have a good plan for hiding people inside, at least.

At long last - sleep. Bel sings us to sleep; we awake inspired.



## Campaign day 17, Sigil day 6, Emberbend

As early as we can, if not as early as we'd have liked, we're packed and get down to the docks to pretend (!) to be part of the crew. We were told "at least" an hour before departure; it's about 10am; so we get to the tavern and have breakfast. People seem to be whispering sometimes and giving us knowing looks. The caravan leader comes up. News has reached him that we "want something from his caravan" (more knowing looks) - he'll accompany us down. We finished and head to the docks with the caravan leader. He takes us into the warehouse.

He starts "selling" us weapons. Bel fakes a debate on price - nat 20 on deception, 32 total! - and this is very successful. Bel has been "robbed blind" but handed gold. And that's that; we get a stash of some dozen or so more weapons, safely sheathed, in the bag of holding. Between the chests, Jordun's stash, and things we might give away, we should be able to arm at least half of the slaves and then they will hopefully liberate more weapons rapidly from guards they dispatch.

Bart slides over at one point - "do you have room for these?" - two armfuls of rope. "It might be useful!" - well, sure! Thanks! Into the bag.

Oswen (History nat 20 + 5!) is thinking about Arcanaloths. They're like her; learned, not innate casters. They can cast to a very high level. She thinks she read about them being immune to charm or poison effects (and she warns Bel about that) and resistances to elemental damage types, but less rare types like psychic or just magical weapons can be good. They have magic resistance too, so we have to be careful with spells against them. Banishment is unlikely to work, for starters.

When it comes down to it - the best she can figure is Silence! Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best.

As for herself, she read up on Teleportation Circle. If we can hold bad guys off for a minute, and if she can draw it big enough, with a few people in the middle including her, her party on guard at the edges, concentric circles of slaves ready to jump in - she figures she *might just* be able to get everyone to the ruins. They'd need to be told *exactly* what to do especially on *exit* at the ruins.

Eventually, at the dock, Klax shows up. "What are you lazy louts doing?! Load the boats! Hurry up!"

We start loading! Bel uses Mage Hand a lot. Kindle and Inafina can brute-force it. Oswen just sort of coordinates a bit in the warehouse as she lacks the physical stature to do much else. And by midday - as expected - everything is loaded. It's bright, hot, we're overheated just from the loading anyway; the heat from the lava is huge. Oswen is sure the cloak must be helping, and hopes the others are doing OK. Thank goodness, at least, for our "location appropriate" clothing from Tatoun.

Eventually, we're told to get in the boats. It's quite harrowing; a literal jump over the hot stuff. Kindle and Inafina have no issue; he's ready to help Oswen but she's sure she's OK. ACRO 2+6 -> 8! Good thing Kindle was ready to catch her. Bel hops over last.

Klax's boat is in the distance and already heading off. His second "actually his" boat is next, and we're third, in the possibly-not-Klax's boat that used to belong to (and might still belong to) Meregon. At least we don't seem to have to do anything for this. The Cambians summon strange charred creatures that are *in* the river and pull the boats along! That explains how they manage to make headway upstream. The only "downside" - they look rather like tortured souls... Oswen has to try and not focus on it.

We shelter as close to the centre of the barge as we can, up close against the tarps covering the cargo. We have a water amphora - seems they put one on each boat, one more on the middle boat - and even that's heating up.

The landscape is bizarre. Strange jets of flames fly through the sky sometimes; one minute Outlands, next minute, fire plane. It reminds Oswen of the overlap of the fey and prime material at Loch Wynnice. Oswen, perception, 19+1 -> 20 -> sees even more strange creatures, swimming in the lava - ah, salamanders. They're kind of eel-like, but look to be made of fire. It's all in the domain of "this is impossible" - normal rules just don't apply.

It's slow going. Three rather excruciating hours pass. It's even more of a strange boundary area now; it's loud! Crunching and grinding sounds rumble all over. The river, which higher upstream had essentially been in a canyon, but opens up into a lake that looks to be on fire in places - "clouds" of fire above the lava. We see a series of large floating islands, including an area where a few seem to have collided and - ah, there it is - a bridge. And looming suddenly as smoke blows aside, is the large rock with the huge Hold atop. From this approach we clearly also see the 'sculpture' - the face of the Efreeti, mouth and eyes pouring lava. Everything is on fire. Oswen does at least some benefits in all the noise - it's really loud, in fact - down inside the Hold it's surely quieter, but most likely, it's by no means silent.

There are other volcanos visible here and there. In one place we see the lake bubbling up lava as if there is a volcano hidden beneath the surface. The boats now start to head around the "back" of the sculpture - we don't go under the bridge side - to get to, what we know from our map is the dock. We do note with interest that the bridge connecting to the rock island is followed by what amounts to a series of rock dams, crashed into each other; you wouldn't need to move them, actually, as they form a very difficult terrain - but passable - land bridge. It'd just take ages and you'd be fully exposed the whole time. **Teleport is probably the only way**.

Then we see the "angels", the Erinyes. Charred wings, wearing circlets, blackened, standing on turrets. They seem to be on fire themselves, as if that's just something they always do - as if they emanate the fire. They hold various weapons but just watch; there's no apparent reaction to anything.

Brimstone Hold rises out of the lava about 15ft before the walls start, so it's on a plinth (ish) of rock overall. Walls are plated with slag iron - some of which glows red - it must be unclimbable, simply due to heat. Just like on our map, we pass between two tall towers to head into the dock. The mooring point is obvious. Everything is treacherous! Handhold ladders carved into the stone get from the dock to the upper level and crane. Trying to escape by boat looks even less possible now, as descent by ladder would be really hard.

The Erinyes are looking around. They do see the boats. They seem to stop paying attention. We're not being studied. It doesn't help us understand their motivations; they know Klax, after all.

We are kept in the boats until crane unloading is done - then we start to climb out. We each have to wait our turn. We're the last. Seeing everyone else leave as we just wait - for some 20 minutes or more - is kind of harrowing! When it's our turn, though, we're happy to climb up.

Inafina, despite low ATHL, finds she can "walk" on the vertical wall. She helps Oswen. Kindle's size  doesn't seem to stop him using this treacherous ladder and he's able to aid Bel. It takes a while but we make it. The lava from the big sculpture falls some 20ft into a pool, like on our map, then falls some 40ft further in a thin waterfall into the "harbour". We *think* we might see movement in the mouth...? Something big and blobby in a chamber behind, lit by the lava. *That's* odd. And then Oswen realises - **that must be the beholder**.

We can hear the sound of people working tools against stone down in the "quarry" over to one side. Cambians from the boats just fly over to the buildings in that direction as if they're finished with work. But there is stuff to unload by the cranes; however, as we get there, we can't help but be distracted by what we now clearly see in the "prison yard".

A giant chunk of basalt is covered in scaffolding. Slaves work away, trying to chip out blocks. They have *stone* tools... Duergar are yelling, cracking whips and so-on. The wall on the far side seems to rise about 25ft. As per our map, the only apparent way down over there is to the barracks, not the yard. What's more, the yard slopes *downwards* towards us, perhaps because this area itself was quarried - the drop on our side is some 40ft!

Oswen perception 18. There's a winch, with lots of chain attached, perhaps used to bring stuff up from the prison yard. It's certainly heavy duty. He thinks he could operate it if needed, but it'd be noisy because of chains. There's no way to readily communicate with the slaves - unless one got close enough for Message but you really couldn't explain anything useful in 25 words to someone not expecting it! They are *very* varied, as we were told but - standing out because they're significantly larger than most others - are some who look like Jordun's kind.

Klax is up here too. Some of his crew are there with him; he's boasting but also barking orders about moving stuff *carefully* into store rooms. That helps us! He's going to start negotiations. Bel asks another crew member how long the negotiations take; the answer is that how long they *actually* take is a good question, but Klax has lavish guest quarters and tends to stay below until at least the next day.

Those who are left are grumbling. We use this to our advantage. We start moving goods with the whole group, but try to convince them to let us finish it (since Klax hates us and we want to make a good impression) so that we're the last people in the store room. People look a bit puzzled though; Inafina insight 14 is enough to figure that they're wondering where the dragon is. They keep looking up at the mountain. We use that our advantage too, saying, "we don't know where it is either, but let's not waste any time!" - it's interesting to see how scared they seem to be of that dragon, but clearly don't know it's either not here at all, or at least, not coming back ever.

Looking over at the mountain, where everyone else is glancing, we do see a cave to the right of the face. That must be the lair. Quite possibly, therein lies a fortune.

We aren't that kind of group. That's not for us to worry about.

When we get to the nearby store room, we ask if that's where everything must be left. No! Some goes to the other store room. The crew member misunderstands and thinks we're trying to leave stuff up top in the tiny building that has the access stairs. He doesn't realise we know more about it and *we* realise that we might've tipped him off to us knowing more. We follow down the stairs to the large store room, some 30x40ft. "Here!" we're told. "Put them in here." "Everything in this one place?" "Yes - everything we bring down lives here."

We get back up and find the other crew have left us to it. We grab the next load of stuff. About four people are left moving stuff. People don't chat. We look around more carefully this time and notice, surprisingly, a door that's not on the map. This is in the southern wall, which ought to lead to the long corridor on our map. There are crates, amphoras of water, piles of wood and *metal* tools here.

Next time; two people left, two others bailed to the big 'staff' buildings. "Good job, carry on" shouts one, laughing. The two left ignore us when we suggest they bail out too.

Oswen, INT-based stealth check requested; only 11. We're trying to observe things and not look suspicious. She realises that the towers are all accessed from this level, at least, they all have doors here. Those towers only lift about 10-15 feet over this upper level. The triangle of three towers near the gate are lower than the others. The top of the wall from the innermost of the three, that connects to this raised area, is barely higher than it. The final things to be unloaded have been left at the "Northernmost" crane and that is close to the winch, which lets us get a better look. It's not a platform. It has two chains on either side of what looks like the entrance to a tunnel. It seems to open some kind of gate, right down near the floor level.

Oswen needs to see. She can't risk Orvil; no birds here, he'd stand out! She brings forth her Manifest Mind instead and hopes it doesn't get seen - a dim light glow against all this fire? It's the **entrance to the cells**. She can't spend too long there just "looking through other eyes" and can't easily see what's inside, but she does clearly see at least three of Jordun's people in the main yard.

Our stalling means that the other two finish their unloading and leave. It'll take a few trips to clear the palette. Each time we try to gather more information, with Oswen moving the Manifest Mind when she can but otherwise leaving it down there.

* No access at the ground level to that Northern tower with the door up on our level
* What looks like a security 'gate' between the two towers of the triangle on the yard-side wall is indeed such a thing; really heavy stone doors; we don't know how we could ever open those (but there must be a way)
* Looks from the map like there's a guard room tunnel "north" of the dividing wall? There is indeed another entrance, with a heavy portcullis - but no winch, so how is that opened?
* D20 requested. Nat 20 rolled! As she watches, she sees movement; a Duergar is in the hallway behind the portcullis, winding something. So it's opened from the inside only. Two come out, brandishing spears. Then the gate is lowered.

We're back in a situation where we keep finding more problems without solutions. Since we now figure we can't escape by boat, even on our own, we can't steal the book now as we had hoped. Instead, we take a last set of things down into the store room. We're by ourselves, so Inafina takes the moment to listen at the unexpected Southward door. Perception 16. She actually hears things from the *west* door instead. Two gruff voices are arguing; but she doesn't understand what they're saying. We all try to listen but it's not a language any of us understand. No surprises there - it's likely Undercommon or at best Dwarven.

Oswen has to blow Comprehend Languages, fast-cast. Yes; Undercommon. Sadly, it just seems to be an argument about cooking! Spices and potatoes. It makes sense that there might be a kitchen adjacent to the store room. They argue about spices and where to get them from. Then the door opens. A Duergar steps in. He sees us holding a crate; orders us to "put it over there"; then he stomps around; turns to us and says, "Where are the space?"

Oswen - passive Investigation 23 - can make a good guess. She points. It is there; "Right. It is." - takes it, walks back out without a word of thanks. We watch closely trying to see anything we can in the kitchen room beyond. It has a door in the far wall, in keeping with our map. Just the two Duergar in there. The door is shut.

Oswen tries the handle on that South-side door. It does open. And the corridor she expects to see is there. The stairs to the East head upwards. Doors where we expect, no extras.

At that moment, the door at the West end of the corridor, in its South wall - that'd be barracks - and a Duergar in full armour steps out. "You're not allowed here!" and Oswen says, "Oh, I think we went the wrong way - how do we get to the ship crew buildings? Do we have to go back up?" - deception is another low roll, only 11. The Duergar knows she lied. He marches over. "What are you hiding? You're not allowed here." "Well I'll go then!" and she retreats; the guard just slams the door. Well, the direct approach worked but that same guard would recognise her again if he saw her.

Oswen's stuck again. But we can't stay here and we can't get the book right now.

We figure, well, the only thing now is the crew quarters. The Cambians went into the Eastward building, so we try the Southward. The crew have occupied all beds - in some cases just with belongings. "No room here" they say. That only leaves the other one. We have no choice so we have to head to the East building full of Cambians. There's a succubus too. One free bed. They laugh at us. "Only *one* free bed. Can the four of you all fit on one bed? If not - we'll take the *rabbit*. The rabbit can have the bed!" The succubus suggests, "Or you can sleep with the cargo, like the worthless things you are!"

We feign annoyance and slam the door on exit, and stomp unhappily down to - exactly where we wanted to be. We now have a *reason* to be down here. There's a Duergar down there from the barracks - they're laughing at us, probably knowing the reception we'd get up top - we are thrown a moth-eaten pillow and generally goaded. We again act like we're annoyed, but again, we're not; they hope we "won't mind the noise", which presumably means they're having a drunken evening.

We try scheming.

* Erinyes have true sight. No fooling them. Up top, it'll be dim light at best. No way to hide on that upper platform. That leaves only these passages as a way to access the yard.
* Opening the guard gate and the prison gate could be noisy but it sounds like there'll be plenty of other noise.
* Invisibility and the hate of disguise *will* or should fool Duergar.
* This points to a way that maybe one or two us might get through - except for opening that prison cell door. That one's accessed from the upper platform only. If it was liftable, the prisoners would've done it. Even weakened, we're sure that the (say) three of Jordun's people, if unable to lift it themselves, mean we can't ourselves. Winch is the only way.

Bel can make 3 people invisible. And he can impersonate the Duergar cook. So we wait.

* We hear sounds of cooking finish
* We hear sounds of plates and things being put out from a more distant room - our map gives us a good guess that it's the adjoining room being used as a mess hall
* More noise and distant arguing; then more noise in the kitchen, from cleaning and so-on
* Goes quiet for a bit
* Noises from the corridor, to our South (and during this time, Oswen ritual-casts Comprehend Languages as *now* it's useful to know)

More complaints. A mention of an ogre! "Refuses to come out from his cell. Apparently someone's lost their doll and they won't come out now." "It doesn't matter! It's still a slave! Ogre or not, if it doesn't come out tomorrow I'm going to prod him until he moves!"

More sounds of doors shutting. That's probably about it; people are bedding down.

Long, long RP with nothing but brick walls. Oswen's feeling like there's hardly anything that can be done, but Bel points out the map is constraining us, and we don't know if that's all there is to this place. In fact, we don't even necessarily trust it at all. Ideas of Oswen's to get to the slaves somehow and talk to them, give the weapons etc., are parked as the only way she can see to do that must involve at some point being out in the open in the yard, and the Erinyes have true sight, so we'd be seen, one way or another. So we figure we must explore down here and see if we can't find any solutions.

If Bel does his thing, what if we meet someone? Oswen could cast Tongues for him, so he can talk his way out of it, and/or if we get into a fight for any reason, Kindle is primed to cast Silence to hide the noise, as we realise it's actually surprisingly quiet down here without people moving around. The rumble and crash of outside is more of a low hum here.

Bel doesn't want to be in front if visible since he'd just walk into a room and potentially bump into someone! He'd prefer invisible people in front. That's a good point. We could use a potion and all be invisible, but anyway, can we have something in front that lets us see a bit further? Orvil as a bird is a "no". We look around the store room and find no small creatures, but notice cobwebs. Orvil isn't too happy about it but agrees in the end that a spider form could work. And while it takes precious time, we have too many risks otherwise and agree to cast Find Familiar, using some of our incense, up in the top room so the smell isn't noticed.

It takes 70 minutes, but at the end of it, we have a fey spider. The others just rest up.

* The spider is out
* Invisibility for three of us
* Inafina will lead, listening at doors; then Oswen; then Bel; then Kindle
* We'll hold hands to keep a chain going and know where we are
* Kindle shares Darkvision - very useful since the Duergar have it and there are no lights
* Inafina gets Kindle's initiative blessing

The clock starts, an hour to go on just about all our spells.

Oswen hesitates and turns back to the group, whispering - "I'm sorry I've been so indecisive and hesitant. It's two things... One is that I've just been putting off going out there. I'm very scared, for all of us. More than I think I ever have been before. But it's not just that. We helped save all of Prismeer, yet did so with the help of so many others. Here, it feels like something much smaller, yet much harder, and for whatever reason, I care so much more about it. I should care most about that book, but really the thing I'm most scared of is failing to rescue the people here. Now we've seen this place, how could we ever leave without giving everything we have to try and get them out? So... We can't put it off any longer."

Inafina listens; no noise; she opens the south corridor door. We quietly move out, heading East, for the other rooms inside (barracks and kitchen to the West, already known). Stealth ADV except Bel:

* Inafina 28
* Oswen 16
* Bel 16
* Kindle 19  

Inafina sees a glow up ahead. Inafina (perception 1+7) freezes! The light moves and disappears, but Inafina doesn't know where. She tries to *hear* it (adv perception 22). An echo; a door closing. As best she can reckon, something has gone into a door that has barracks beyond up the top of the stairs to the East. Figures it might be a salamander. We proceed to the door to the North corridor on our drawn map - all accurate so far! - and she can't hear anything, so cautiously opens it and peers northwards. A long corridor, light at the far end - flames. But they move. Another salamander.

She whispers to Oswen that she thinks salamanders patrol the halls. We should head north as planned, but everyone should keep an eye out and check for hidden doors etc. - Oswen can't Message else be visible, so has to whisper it down the line. Investigation all round:

* Inafina 6 (busy checking ahead and listening out)
* Oswen 23
* Bel ...can't beat Oswen
* Kindle  ...can't beat Oswen Investigation, but Perception 16

Oswen finds nothing along the walls but stone. We reach the end of the corridor, with stairs to the East and a door North. Up the stairs, we can see things level out and there's another door.

First, our original plan was - check the storeroom. No sound from the door (perception 21); Inafina looks inside. 40x30ft or so, a door at one other end, full of weapons and treasure! Books, old armour, all sorts. Inafina insight 22, this stuff looks similar to the kinds of things that Klax collected. Suddenly, she hears a door opening back in the corridor - we all get into the store room and Inafina keeps the door open a crack. Crackling and bright flame - a salamander goes past.

We check the room. Highest investigation is only 17. No hidden doors.

These are *not* thing brought over by Klax, since that's all in the other store room. This could be stuff taken from conquests? Inafina checks the other door, expecting a staircase to the top exit; this is exactly what she finds. Oswen wonders if there are any wards or magical signatures for weapons here; arcana 22, no; they may even be Elven. We take a few more, from the back of the shelf so that at a glance it's not obviously stripped and raise the alarm. We store them with the others in the portable hole. Kindle goes for longer weapons - polearms and suchlike - as they fit and help people fight against creatures that may be hot, and injure their attacker if fought very close up. They should fit the large tribespeople better too.

It seems we must press on to the Arcanaloth's office and see if he has any ideas for ways to the prisoners. We get up there easily enough and, inside, we find him; he's all businesslike immediately (and can clearly see through our invisibility). Oswen asks for help with the prisoners, but he's dismissive and wants us to immediately get the book. She tries to push, but it's not getting anywhere. Kindle, innately (passive insight) sees that Nebukath is quite selfish, but more than that, it's going to be *very* hard to ask this administrator to help us get to the prisoners to help them escape.

Oswen tires a different tactic and asks why the Beholder stays around. "It was here before us; it has its own reasons. But don't you worry... We don't need to deal with the Beholder. I have a secret passage, here, that will get you through. But you must be careful and time it just right. You still have the map I drew?" "Yes" "There's a secret door in my chamber! You need not brave going into the Mouth, where the Eye of the Efreeti is. But you are hesitant... If this is not the right time, there is only one other. When Klax is in the audience chamber with Jarazoun. It would be tomorrow, but I do not know when Vrakir would return. That is why time is of the essence!"

Oswen suggests to Bel, hoping he'll get the message... "What if we *did* talk to the Beholder? Maybe Nebukath knows?!" - at this, Nebukath just sighs. He's thinking something. Insight rolls are low, but we can tell the mood. There's a flash of kind of giving up on us for a moment; then he seems to become detached. A change in how he behaves towards us. "Well, perhaps you *should* talk to him, if that's your desire! You'll find the passage through that door."

Oswen points out that we are who we are. He shrugs. "My mistake. I guess I picked the wrong people. Be my guest."

Inafina, dirty 20, insight - trying to tell, is he just being kind of petulant, or is he just giving up entirely and thinking we're going to die? Her assessment: He's actually given up on us. He thinks we can't do it; he's getting rid of us. We're worthless to him.

She grabs Oswen's hand, holds it tightly. "See if you can spot that secret door." Oswen is surprised, but does so. Investigation. The far wall is just obscured by a bookcase. Investigation 26. Two big books look like they've been used more; "The Blood War"; devils vs demons; the other is called "The Maleficarum" - malicious, demonic intent. The Arcalanloth is trying to "one up" the others here. So, perhaps devils & demons? She pulls the book out. It does look slightly magical and is clearly *very* valuable to the right person, but no door has appeared yet. A small flap of skin is inserted like a bookmark. Curiosity killed the cat, but she opens at the page. A sequence of arcane runes... She recognises them as *part* of the magical sequence used to activate a teleportation circle. There is a suggestion that there's a destination circle has been deactivated by removing runes so you couldn't jump to it, but this book completes that sequence.

She can't cast Comprehend Languages; she'd become visible & besides, it'd take a good 10 minutes or so to do as a ritual as she's used her fast-cast ability today. What she *can* tell is that this circle would be a very powerful weapon in the blood war.

Nebukath isn't keen on giving her time to cast anything; "Are you going to get the book or not? If not, can you please leave?"

**Inafina** says, "We'll get the book".

Oswen lets go of her hand.

"Tip the Maleficarum in my bookshelf - don't touch any of the other books - and the doors will open."

(Oswen is trying to write down as many runes as she can and anything else, but she can't make head nor tales of Infernal and can't copy - nat 2 on a check).

Inafina tips the book. The bookshelf slides sideways, collapsing into a narrower form. Only about 1 book wide. Oswen can see why there were no curved scratch marks on the ground. Apparently, only one book on each shelf was actually real, too.

A hallway beyond, very dusty, is 60ft long. Inafina whispers, "form up, same order as before". Nebukath comes in too, apparently back on the fence about whether or not we'll succeed, but we at least have his interest. He takes Inafina to be the leader at this point - she's been leading the chain of people and was the one who said we'd get the book. He casts Death Ward on her, which is worrying! "Hurry along" he says. "And come back the same way! Do not try and go another way, because it will take you into the lava chamber where the beholder is. And that would be a very bad idea."

Inafina says, "We'll be as quick as we can, but we'll be very careful and moving slowly. It might take a while" - and starts to lead the hand-in-hand group down the corridor.

Nebukath pushes the book back in. The door closes, but we can see the mechanism inside can be worked from our end easily enough.

We get a few feet along when Oswen squeezes Inafina's hand *very* hard, hoarse-whispers, "Stop right there!" (and stops) - "What in the nine hells do you think you're doing?" - about as blunt and angry as she's ever been with Inafina. Inafina says, "We had no options. You know it's true. We can at least get the book. And then we decide if we take probably the greatest risk we've ever taken. And Bel knows what I mean by that."

She starts moving again, pulling Oswen along. We get to the far end and there is a crack that Orvil-spider can squeeze through. Oswen uses Orvil to see what's in the room beyond.

He emerges behind a tapestry. Once he's worked around that, he's in alarge, lavish room full of lavish beautiful tapestries - but all are burned; singed and blackened. There's a beautiful, soft flow of light from a large brazier in the middle, made of very polished brass inset with rubies. The fire within looks probably magical, casting beautiful shadows. Plush-looking silk cushions are scattered around. There's a large brass armchair, with singed, burned cushions. Upon an ornate marble table stands a set of brass goblets and a decanter which seems to be full of a ruby, glowing, firey wine, with bottles in a cabinet behind of the same. As if this all weren't strange enough, there's a fountain set in the floor, mosaic tiled, with the same liquid bubbling up from it.

As the four of us venture in, Orvil squeezes under the South edge door which is a sort of vestibule connecting the quarters, this room and it *does* have a grand door to the West which would lead to the audience chamber if our drawn map is accurate, although our drawn map shows only a secret door (we think) in the South-West corner of the room we're in. Oswen connects Bel's hand with Inafina, says "I'll just be a few seconds - be right back" and goes there to investigate. Investigation 23. Moving a tapestry aside she sees a bit of a shimmer in the wall which her hand passes through, to touch the back of another tapestry.

That's enough, but she has a close look at the fountain too. That seems *very* odd. The 'water' (wine?) is seeping through somehow, bubbling out into a circle around the upwelling. It smells like a potent wine, but seems magical; arcana 21; it's the same as in the bottles and goblet. Now she notices that brazier too. That is *very* magical. Many runes on it. Ah, and in fact there are runes on the fountain too. Four specific runes are missing... So this could be the teleportation circle for which she has the completing sequence.

This fountain *itself* is leaking something through. It's as if this were a portal.

She whispers, "I've no idea if what I'm about to do is bad. Watch the fountain, and if I yelp, run for it!"

And with that, she writes in the four runes.

The fountain suddenly drains - the liquid swirls down and away. A portal opens in the centre; a swirling, weird-looking thing. This then clears up and almost looks like a window, but smoke comes through. It smells *very* sulphurous. Infernal; a hellish demon; this is keyed to some specific place, like Sigil's are. Not somewhere *we* want to be! The exit on the other side is in the air, not on the ground. Embers, smoke, heat haze; but there's a hellish, cracked landscape, filled with lava and myriad flying creatures. Huge flies and wasps.

She closes her eyes for a second to check on Orvil in the antechamber. It's empty. The path out is clear. Then Bel shakes her shoulder. He's scared. Kindle says, "I don't think we should have this open!" - she opens her eyes - the room is beginning to fill with weird smoke and ash is now blowing up. Bel points. "There are thousands of them coming at us!" "Thousands of what? I can't see anything?" - then she realises that some of the "ash" is in fact, flying fiends. Thousands of them. "Oh, that may be a bit more chaos than I had in mind..." - and not knowing the faintest thing about what she's doing or what any of this means. She scrubs out the four runes she'd drawn, but as the portal starts to fail, there's a loud screeching sound from the other side as the things there realise. "Best run to Vrakir's chambers, I think!" says Oswen, fearing the noise must have been heard. She checks via Orvil... In the antechamber, Orvil sees a door open from what should be Jarazoun's room. She says, "Grab my hand, follow me" and runs for the hidden door she discovered earlier.

We push behind the tapestry, through the illusory wall and now, as things just keep going from bad to worse, we're in the place we never wanted to be; the audience chamber. Just one door away from the beholder.

While the others get to look at the room, Oswen is looking via Orvil's eyes. Jarazoun has emerged into the antechamber. He's looking around. To her surprise, he walks towards the door to Vrakir's room; he says something in Ignis including "Vrakir?"; seems to be checking. Now he walks into the room we were just in. Orvil hurries after - adv.stealth 19,20+4 - where were *those* rolls earlier! - and the tone is one of confusion and annoyance. The room is, after all, full of smoke. Jarazoun walks into the middle, and can see the empty fountain so knows *something* happened. It bends down and brushes a finger along marks where Oswen had written her runes, now smudged out. He walks to the brazier, puts his hands on it and says a series of words. Command words, Oswen thinks. The flame grows large and turns into a Fire Elemental. He speaks to it; the elemental moves over the fountain and appears to stand watch.

Now he leaves. Orvil follows (stealth 19) and moves towards the audience chamber door. We're invisible, but Bel isn't! He tries to hide; nat 1, he can't... But Jarazoun seems too busy shouting loudly for Nebukath. Then he turns his head towards Bel. Now surprisingly he speaks in Common. "Why are you hear? Go and get Nebukath for me! Right away! Tell him to meet me in my chambers!" - Bel was quick-thinking a story about hearing a strange noise and coming to investigate, 32 Deception, but it's a bit pointless but Jarazoun is leaving anyway; so Bel just calls after to say he'll fetch Nebukath.

Once Orvil notes the coast is clear, we move into the antechamber. It's cramped because there are two huge statues, we see, almost life-size, of Eefretis holding scimitars. Oswen Arcana 21. They're golems, sentinels. Inevitable it would seem. They will move if something activates them. We don't know the warding; it's all high risk. Dimension Door inside perhaps? Oswen, Perception 21, can't see visible wards or runes on the door. There is a lock though, and that's magical and very unusual. Requires a very specific key. It *could* be picked, but any kind of failure is likely to be disastrous.

She doesn't want that kind of risk, nor to put all that on Bel. So we use the adjacent room to mask the noise of Inafina, Orvil and Oswen getting into the portable hole, so that Bel can use Dimension Door to bring himself and Kindle into the room. He feels more comfortable casting the spell from there too as he doesn't need to worry too much about being quiet and the distance is easy to judge.

He steps through with Kindle. No noise from outside; looks like we bypassed the wards. He opens the portable hole for the rest of us.

The room looks very palatial. A circular bed is filled with unusual shimmering cloth and phoenix feathers. Silk tapestries hang. Somehow, nothing is scorched. A side table has some of the wine we saw before in a bottle, with a ruby-encrusted goblet next to it. A large desk is present and, off to one side, is a black tome, cover emblazoned in fell words; on the back wall, opposite the door, things are badly burned and there are deep scorch marks and cracked stone radiates from a very grotesque looking face, twisted in a hateful scowl, moulded into the stone itself. Its forehead has a blood-red gem which glows a bit.

Arcana check on the gem is only 17. It's magical, of course! It's protected by a glyph of warding, so can't be taken.

Oswen, again has no idea what this means. She turns her attention to the book on the desk; is that "the" book we want? Luck dice roll, D20->19, it's actually a Mimic! She backs off and warns the party. As best she can recall from the visions shown when we were "given this mission" it does look like the book we're after. So where is *that* actual book? It's far too big to fit in any drawer in the desk.

Very carefully, trying to keep well clear of the mimic, she checks all around the room, investigation 31; there's a chest near the bed (nope). Warning Kindle that he might need to cast Silence if the mimic attacks, Oswen tries to check all the drawers in the desk. There are scrolls of maps, writings etc. but all in a language she doesn't understand, then spots what seems to be a gem similar to the one in the wall. It's there together with a bunch of other texts. Ten sheets of paper, all written in Infernal.

Arcana 26, no ward on *this* gem. Very beautiful and expensive though!

She warns the party that she really has no choice but to ritual-cast Comprehend Languages. She is starting to suspect that the "thing in the wall" might be the book, trapped somehow? But there's also a strange parchment, like a scroll, beautifully illustrated (as in decorations on the scroll, not part of its contents) and it looks well used - but is completely blank.

Ten minutes later, Oswen is visible and can at least start to read the ten ish sheets. They've been written mainly by the same hand, over a period of time, in Ignis (Elemental). She learns:

* Vrakir discovered this place
* It already existed before him (which we know from Nebukath's comments)
* An uneasy truce with Azmodius, agreeing that the Erinyes can stay to guard and watch *the portal* and in return, he is allowed to operate out of Brimstone Hold, so long as he upholds supporting their role and doesn't interfere
* He doesn't truly understand what the portal is; he's asked his "beholden Arcanaloth" to learn as much as possible about it and the Arcanaloth can now open and close it, so they have control; this is now bargaining power between them and Azmodius
* "Perhaps I shall be beholden no longer to this agreement for I have discovered the mightiest of all books in the Dracolich's hoard; though this I speak to an ancient and powerful force, a God I am sure. I shall hide it. I must keep it away from all of the prying eyes."
* He has managed to secure a demiplane - a Scroll Of Demiplane - within which to hide it
* He also had to secure scrolls of Glyph Of Warding and Disintegrate to protect access to the demiplane
* "I must go to the Plane Of Fire and secure flawless rubies to use as the focus of the spell. I will know how to activate and deactivate it through spoken command."
* **It does not say what the spoken commands are**.
* There's an impression in some writings that he's losing himself as time goes by, as if he's being spurred on; perhaps he, too, could be a Vizier or Kalif and rule over other Efreeti; this power he will gain will make him unstoppable
* He must grow his ranks and wealth

Oswen, History 15; she's aware of the Demiplane spell, though it is far beyond her current abilities (L8). That must have been the spell on the beautiful parchment, she thinks, and that's why it's now blank. However, this casting seems even more exceptional since these gems seem keyed to accessing something kind of permanent.

We don't know the spoken words or how we might find that out. There's probably a way somehow, but Oswen pleads with Bel to risk it - try Dispel Magic. The warding is powerful, so it's a bit of a long shot. **Thankfully, this time, the dice gods are very kind** - natural 19, for 23 total. Both the primed Disintegrate and the Warding spells are dispelled. Great! So Oswen tentatively tries to touch the gem. It's certainly got magic in it; she can pry it out, perhaps? Arcana ADV (since she knows a bit of the magic here) 25. If she focuses on the gem in the wall and tries to imagine a Demiplane - somehow - it ought to activate?

"Stand back, just in case" she says, and gives it a try.

It's a curious sensation. She feels as if she has just cast a spell - Demiplane, no less - and suddenly, a strange effect appears around them. The mouth of the face opens and seems to engulf the world around them! They're not exactly pulled into the Demiplane; it's more that it surrounds them. The space they are now in has a portal on a wall behind through which, clearly visible, is the room they were just in. This is a weird plane, though. It seems to be decaying somehow. Kindle grabs hold of his mace immediately - "this - this place feels VERY bad!" and Inafina agrees, her "six sense" for danger 'shouting' loudly.

The floor of this otherwise empty room has an open book on it, pages fluttering as if in a breeze, but there's no wind. The paving around seem charred as if they're disintegrating. The walls are riddled with fissures that feel more like vines, seeping clouds of darkness in wisps. WIS saves:

* Oswen 8 (3, 3 + 5 with advantage!)
* Inafina 23
* Bel 7
* Kindle 10

Yikes. Bel sees Oswen struggling and Reacts with Counter Charm to cause her to reroll. Another 3 - and an 18, plus 5, 23. Bel and Kindle, though, are now Frightened. They want to escape as soon as they can. They run out through the portal!

Oswen grabs the big leather and wool cold weather clothing from her bag, and puts them on. But as she does this, there's a sudden bombardment of voices, one in particular very powerful, trying to break through into her head. All manner of languages. Right now she understands them *all* as Comprehend Languages is still up - no wonder her WIS save was so difficult - at first they're saying scary things; threats, doom, profanity. But as she approaches the book they change. They start saying, "Come to me, I've been waiting for me" - and that kind of thing. "You are the one, it is our time". Attempts to convince.

This book is smaller than the mimic. It'll fit in her satchel of holding - thankfully, since Kindle took the portable hole when he fled. She has to work hard to fight through. Picking up the book with the gloves seems to have no ill effect; she wraps it in a cold weather cloak and shoves the whole lot as best she can into the satchel. It's bulky wrapped up, hardly fitting, but it does go in.

At this Inafina immediately notices two invisible creatures become visible. Two large Nycaloths. They attack!

(Auto-roll Initiative via the DnD Beyond map updates)

Inafina acts first, thanks to Kindle's gift. She hits with the staff first, 9 damage, lighting only 1, but that does nothing. She tries to hit again to stun, but misses; she uses a flurry of blows; the first hits, but for minimum damage; the second also misses. Kindle, in the other room, overcomes his fear. Bel tries too and uses his Counter Charm reaction on himself but even that's not enough. He's still scared.

Oswen is close to the same creature attacking Inafina. They're from lower planes, so she risks trying Banishment; CHA 18 save - they get ADV on that save, though; it works. She shouts, "We need to run and close the portal! I won't be able to hold the spell when that second one attacks!" - and she runs for the door.

The other creature chases her, rather than going for Inafina. This is both bad and good, in equal measure; it's certainly not what she expected, but of course, she has the book. Ah. The creature *does* get out of the room and into Vrakir's quarters. It attacks twice, hitting both times; 11, 12 damage. CON saves are 11, 16 so she holds the spell (just!) but she has an open wound; CON save is nat 20+1, so somehow, she manages to resist whatever this nasty, infectious wound is. It closes. She calls to Kindle as quietly as she can, "We need to get this thing back in the portal and we need it *quiet!*"

(She should never have run out - she really didn't think it would follow)

Inafina doesn't know what Oswen is saying so runs towards the portal - firing a Radiant Bolt which misses - then gets close and attacks *through* it, as if an open door. An Unarmed Strike hits and Stunning Strike works (nat 1 on its save). She's able to now squeeze past it and via Flurry Of Blows tries a heavy kick to push it back... She hits, using Shove, and since it is incapacitated it can't save against this; it's big but just works; it's pushed back into the Demiplane. She whisper-shouts, "Oswen, close the damn thing!"

Bel, save, nat 20 - no longer afraid!

Kindle *lifts* Oswen up, because the Ruby is way up on the wall as the mouth "opened". She just tries to do the reverse of before; touch the gem, "will" the plane to close. It does. She grabs her dagger and yanks out the gem. She pockets it, along with other one. It's pretty obvious now that we've been here, Vrakir will know immediately, so we don't bother putting anything back. We look at the chest... Looks valuable; and it'd annoy Vrakir even more to lose it. OK, sure, we're not here to loot but all disruption is good. Bel is certainly keen! We open up the Portable Hole, since some of us have to hide there anyway.

Kindle, remarkably, is still invisible - for a little while longer. We get into the portable hole. It's far too risky sadly to Dimension Door into the cells; we'd most likely appear in solid rock! Instead, our best guess is to return to the original store room, gather our thoughts and take a higher risk option for getting into the cells - whatever that looks like.

Bel uses his last L4 and steps through with Kindle; the hole is unpacked, we emerge and figure out what to do next... Since for now, we seem to be stuck right back in that same store room!
