# Oswen: Part 2.16
## Campaign Day 39, approaching midday
### At the gates of the town of Gloom AKA Glorm, Outlands

There's a guard house, but it's empty. The gates are open. We walk in, Oswen up front with Orvil flying above within the 100ft range; Kindle behind; Inafina and Bel side-by-side in the middle. Just inside the guardhouse we see a guard, smoking a pipe and paying us little attention. The road in town has somewhat uneven flagstones with muddy tracks but it's better than just gravel or mud, however further in town it's more broken up. Not much upkeep.

Stables, a wagonneer, businesses open but few people around, with an obvious town centre ahead. We get there; a raised area, some seats and some kind of communal oven. It's very quiet. A child plays with a ball made of dried dried vines, kicking it against the side of a building. Inafina calls over; "Hello. My name's Inafina! What's the most popular inn or tavern here, do you know?"

The child turns. A boy, maybe 8 years old, very pale, looking puzzled. Then he points to a building across the square; the he looks again at us all, his eyes widen and he runs away, forgetting even his ball! We place the ball up on a small wall in a nook so it won't blow away hoping he might return to find it later. We think he saw Kindle and got frightened! Kindle shrugs as Inafina chuckles.

The indicated building is a place called "**The Cheerful Cauldron**" (!) - a picture of a smiling cauldron and arms extending from where handles would be normally. In one hand it holds a ladle full of piping hot soup. In the other, a tankard of frothy ale. Our expectations are rather low, but we hope to be surprised... Oswen pushes against the door but it seems a bit stuck. She puts her shoulder into it, but it doesn't budge. Kindle tries and it suddenly pops open!

Kindle sort of falls inside as a result. Dry leaves from the courtyard swoosh in with us. Immediately in front of the door is a kind of semicircle area with a fews leading down to a lower area. The person behind the bar there is sat down, looks up, surprised, stands bolt upright. Things inside rattle as the open door lets the wind blow in and the fireplace almost blows out. We hurry inside and close the door behind us.

There's a table with one person, a booth seat with one person... And that's it. The door to the kitchen opens momentarily and a head pops out; nods to us, "feel free to take a seat... Any empty spot!"

It's kind of midday... We figure, fine, table service ale and soup or something... So we sit, but choose the bar - seems like the least weird place to be where we can at least talk to someone. The bartenders eyes widen as we do that and he hurriedly wipes down the bar surface. Four tankards are being prepared and Oswen says, "hello, four of your favourite ales please?"

"Oh. Right. Yes? Yes. Hold on."

The barman tries to get a keg to release ale, even tipping the barrel to eventually fill one tankard full of bottom-of-barrel frothy ale. He looks over. "Ummm... Maybe... A cider or something?"

Kindle has the ale (preparing his holy symbol, just in case!) and the other three agree, "Cider sounds good."

The barman seems to cheer up a bit. He opens a cupboard and pulls out a big glass container of container, pulls the cork, there's some fizz; he pours three. That looks alright. We're offered food by the cook - anything with a list of certain vegetables and some goat. Fine! It's 10 coppers for the drink and 4 for the food.

We get given four big bowls with a spoon, fork and folded cloth napkin. Then a big bowl of carrots, potatoes, beetroot and so-on, along with cubes of goat meat. But none of it is cooked - we figure this is related to the big cauldron that is suspended over the hearth-like fire. We take the big bowls over to the cauldron and, at this, the cook says, "Hello? Hello? We have guests!"

A face appears on the cauldron. "Oh hello! Wonderful. What do you have there? Root vegetables? I love root vegetables? And goat! Put it in!"

So we carefully (to avoid splashing) put the ingredients inside. She points to a stool to one side with a couple of bowls of some kind of sauce. The cauldron starts boiling as the food cooks.

The cauldron starts smalltalk. Their name is **Caulbin**. We introduce ourselves. The cauldron has been here as long as they can remember; "I woke up in here". They vaguely remember who woke them. "She was a... Friend? But a bit of a nasty streak about her. Probably not so popular. She made me to create potions. But people say that something went wrong and instead, I developed a personality! Well I think it's better. I think I'm a lot better than a cauldron which can only make potions! Oh. I think it might be ready..." 

But it's not quite and this gives us more time to talk. We mention Tovag; the cauldron thinks, and remembers **Mirianne**, the blacksmith's daughter who used to talk about it. But she hasn't been in a while. The cauldron would like to see her again. We agree to make enquiries. In another minute or two the food is ready; we thank them and ladle out food into our bowls. As we do, the cauldron chats about the history of Gloom.

"It's a transliteration of the original name of the town - which was nothing to do with being gloomy! But people started to find portals. It used to be really bustling but over time, whatever is on the other side of all those doors started to seep into the town and people started to leave or disappear. But that started before their time. Stories that Caulbin has heard.

We take our bowls back to the bar and ask about Caulbin's story. "When did it all start?"

"This used to be a bit of a crossroads for people headed to three of the Gate Towns. But then the first portal was discovered; not sure where or when that was, but mists would roll in to the town at night. People started to go missing in them! More and more of these doorways were discovered. Whenever a resident went missing, a portal was found in their house. After a time people just stayed away because - well, you know. It's tough because nobody stays anymore. We have rooms as an inn but nobody stays overnight in Gloom! That's when people go missing."

At this, Oswen says, "How much would it be? Do you have a room big enough for the four of us?" - the barman checks the two other patrons are good for drinks, then shows us upstairs. Inafina (perception 24!) notices that both of the people in the tavern are watching us, with a look of surprise but also worry. Over her shoulder Inafina says down into the room, "Don't worry, this is going to be just what we need" - one of them looks darkly down into his ale and mutters into the tankard as he drinks.

There are some bigger dorm-style rooms, with more beds than we need but he's happy to let us use such a room ourselves. The smaller rooms fit two each, unless beds are shared and there are some single rooms. So we take the smallest dorm room, with 8 bunk beds. There's bathroom nearby; one night for now, but we might need more later. 1sp per person per night - we pay 4sp and head back down to finish our stew. Bel remembers to ask about the cauldron... There was a witch. In the "old days". Didn't cause any trouble. Liked the style of food - they already used a "regular" cauldron then. One day she said it was her last time visiting and asked if there was anything she could do for them; jokingly, they suggested a cauldron that could *make* food forever. The witch realised she could kind of modify and combine a couple of spells - but that did also give it a personality, as an unexpected - but nice - side effect... So the witch gave it a name and that was the last they saw. However, it can't actually *make* the food. It must be cooked. Anyway, the inn got renamed "The Cheerful Cauldron" as a result.

Apparently the witch would turn up with injuries sometimes - she'd been getting into scraps _somewhere_ - but never harmed anyone in town. "That was the good old days".

It's good stew and we thank the cook and the cauldron!

We see, peeking out from low at the kitchen door, is the kid. Wild-eyed. Kindle is last down the stairs and the kid bolts away. We learn their name **Brn**. Apparently he's a good kid but hasn't spoken in two years!

We have a key for our room and the door downstairs. Kindle looks after them - he's the only one who can open the door...

Blacksmiths? First we go to the town square and sit near where the ball was perched - it's gone now, hopefully Brn got it! - for a while. We chat for a while, about our plans and all the while hoping Brn might show up. It's chilly; we draw our cloaks around; clouds in the sky don't seem to move, yet there's a constant cold breeze blowing through. Inafina perception 22. She notices only three other people, scurrying purposefully between buildings, heads down, hoods up, going about their business. And then she spots the kid, hiding behind the oven, holding his ball. Curious but scared. He's not scared at the sight of Kindle; he must be scared of Kindle seeing *him*.

Inafina says, loudly enough, "Well, I wonder what people here would think if people knew we were going to try and fight the monsters?" - and Bel pulls out his guitar, starting to play a tune. And this time he *really* nails it! Nat 20 performance. We even see a couple of doors open and heads pop out. As he does that Oswen takes that lead and says, "I mean it's all relative - I'm small and Kindle's really big, and could look scary, but of course, we all know he's not at all!" and in response Kindle creates Dancing Lights for the music using his ring. "See?" says Oswen. "Wouldn't hurt a fly!"

A few more people appear, getting closer. One or two start to clap along. A younger guy appears and even starts to dance! At the end of Bel's song he tips his hat. "Welcome to town! It's good to have you in Glorm!" and heads off. At that, Oswen says, "What a strange name" and another person nearby says "It's the mountain dialect for the Place Of The Hazel Trees. You can see there are lots around." Oswen nods. "A nice name."

Kindle gently lowers the Dancing Lights down and Brn plucks up courage to walk over, holding his ball. He stands directly in front of Kindle and points at the ring. Kindle makes the lights reappear. Brn is wide-eyed, entranced. After a while the lights go away. Brn points back at it straight away! So Kindle takes the ring off and shows it. Brn drops the ball and takes the ring with both hands (it's obviously very big for him). He tries shaking it and listening to it. Then he taps it and then gives it back to Kindle, pointing. Kindle plays dumb! "What is it you want me to do?" Brn points more insistently. "Did you want me to make the lights again?" Vigorous nodding. More lights. Then Kindle cleverly asks, "What did you want the lights to do?"

After thinking a while Brn beckons us closer and points at the lights - it seems we must follow him - so we do so. He picks up is ball and we (and the lights) all follow along. He leads us behind a building, along a back lane and to the back of an abandoned-looking building. He points at the door. And points at Inafina. Does a kicking motion. Inafina laughs and says, "We might be able to get in *without* destroying the door" and looks to Bel. Bel checks the door; but it's not even locked. It's just jammed, somehow. Something blocks it - maybe even a bar inside. Oswen has no gate spell left after the battle for the box, so Inafina tries to kick it. She tries to be gentle but the strike does max damage! 16. A wooden bar indeed has been placed across the back of the door; as the door breaks open, we see the two scattered pieces.

It's dark inside. Unnatural. At this Oswen turns to Brn and says, "You need to stay back. Do NOT come inside, unless we say it's safe. Understand." He pulls his face and shakes his head, tugging at Kindle's clothing. Kindle tries to send the lights inside - as they go into the darkness they're snuffed out. Brn looks dejected. Oswen says, "Don't worry, we have other things we can try - but this is why we said to be careful - it looks dangerous."

Oswen Arcana only 16, it's magical spell darkness. It's not something innate. She says to Kindle, "Best I can do is the drift globe, might overcome it..." (L3 Daylight vs L2 Darkness). She brings out the Driftglobe, lights it dimly and pushes it into the room, so it is swallowed by the darkness; then warns people to watch their eyes - this is probably *NOT* going to be subtle! - and brings it to full 60ft radius daylight.

Wow. You can almost *hear* the light suddenly burst out! She has her eyes shaded but can see enough to see that *layers* of darkness are *moving* - fleeing from the light. She's strongly reminded of such things - the door opens to steps down into a quite large open cellar - barred from the *inside?* - and there, a body has a shadow clinging to it. It almost seems to be *feeding*... There must be a half-dozen smaller shadows fleeing too.

"I don't know if that person is alive, but we need to try..." - and she starts to run in, shouting to Inafina behind her, "Don't let Brn inside, far too dangerous!"

Initiative:

* Oswen only 14, despite ADV from Kindle
* Inafina nat 1, 10 total; she's caught off-guard by Oswen running into a fight but telling her not to come
* Kindle 6
* Bel 4

Oswen uses Alustriel's staff, remembering Magic Missile - Oswen herself has no radiant-like damage, which she really needs - 3 missiles hit, 10 damage; it looks at her with behind eye sockets and mouth filled with blueish-flame. Bat-like wings unfold, horns made of shadow, big teeth; a demonic look; it's fed on... Something from what seems to be a human on the ground. It's not blood. But they're very pale.

The creature speaks a language she doesn't understand. Sounds ancient, infernal and evil; maybe Abyssal. Not devil language though; she figures she'd recognise that. And she can tell that the daylight really bothers it. The other shadows are clinging to walls to try and get away from it. As a bonus action Oswen brings the drift globe right up to the roof but more central to cover more corners. The creature snarls and she shouts back, "Kindle, Radiant would be useful!"

Wisps of blue light seem to be trailing between its mouth and the human on the ground. That's where the strange blue flame-like light is coming from. It looks around, as if to find shadow but finds none; so instead it launches itself at Oswen and tries to rake at her with a claw. It almost hits but the daylight is too bright and it misses so she dodges what would've bee 16 psychic damage; even so she gets an approaching sense of overwhelming hopelessness... No way they could possibly save everyone... This mission is unwise... But that passes quite quickly.

The creature continues to look around trying to find a way away; it retreats and she strikes out as it departs with Alustriel's staff, hitting, 7 bludgeoning, but some of it just seems to just *pass through* this shadow creature. But it does *something*. It's heading for but doesn't quite reach a hiding place behind a barrel.

Inafina obeys and stays back until called, looking after Brn; she says "very dangerous, please keep back!" and reaches to hold his hand (as her "second attack") since she sees Brn trying to run in; she doesn't stop him seeing what's going on - the sounds might be even more scary than the reality of it! - but she can see the creature through the door is within 30ft and hits with Radiant Sun Bolt. It'd be 11 damage but it seems to do far more damage than that - 22 is taken. She uses a Focus Point and tries again twice, but only one hits; and that's another 22 damage. The other shadows look - fearful?! She shouts to Oswen, "The other shadows are part of this, beware of them!"

Kindle runs in and throws Sacred Flame. The strange creature just fails (thanks again to DISADV from the Daylight) to escape the effects; another 22 damage - and it disintegrates; it screams as this happens but there's a sort of doppler-shift effect as it is not dying, it's *being pulled back* to some other plane. That's great - but there are several other "minor" shadows still around and, more importantly, someone is hurt. Kindle runs to the fallen human and tries casting Lesser Restoration (bonus action). A certain stiffness to the body seems to relax; were they previously perhaps paralysed? And Inafina notices Brn react to that and she says, "You can go in soon, don't worry, still too dangerous!" - he looks up at her, and suddenly there's a look of hope. Insight, only 13; hmm, hard to say why? This is a friend, or seeing Kindle is not scary?

Bel isn't sure what to do, so just - attacks. Plays some chords on his guitar and streaks of stardust are released. They fly out; hits one of the shadows, another 11 damage to deal 22 (fourth in a row!) - that shadow disappears. *This* is destroyed. The others seem even more keen to get away! At this, Oswen, Religion 21; are these separated shadows, like we've seen before? But each of them carries a tiny bit of that blue light. No. Whatever these are, they're scavengers. Their fear arises from knowing that they can be destroyed by us - not just sent back, but actually killed.

They flit around frantically trying to find a way out. One finds a crack in the ceiling and squeezes through into the space above. Three remain. Oswen tries Magic Missile, one each, at least to get some damage in. They're hit for 3, 4, 4 damage each. She summons Manifest Mind and sends it up to chase after shadow that went above. It sends back telepathically a room that's clearly a smithy. It's a mess, equipment strewn around, things pushed up against doors and windows - trying to stop something coming *in. Oswen calls out, "My goodness - this *is* the blacksmiths!"

Inafina says, "Take care with the stairs!" and lets go of Brn, then shoots another radiant sun bolt; max damage 15->30->it is destroyed. She goes for another one. She gets a hit but it's weak this time and - Focus point - misses (nat 1), then crit, takes out a second shadow. One left here, one upstairs; she runs inside and looks up to a barred trapdoor-style cellar door and just has time to pull the bar across to release it, but it's not open yet.

Kindle uses Sacred Flame on the third shadow; 34 damage taken, obliterated!; then tries L1 Healing Word on the now-seen-as woman on the ground, who is regaining consciousness but seems very badly injured. Brn now runs inside and hugs her; she pulls him in for a hug; speaks weakly, "Brn, child, what's going on, why are you here, the shadows, beware the shadows!" - she looks up to see Kindle; looks scared; Brn *signs* in Common - "Not enemy, friend!" - and holds onto Kindle. Oswen recognises the basic, but effective Common Sign Language.

Bel calls out, "Oh my goodness, pandemonium!" "Upstairs!" says Inafina. Bel looks to Oswen "are you coming with me?!" and she's confused but says, "maybe!" - he grabs her, and uses Dimension Door. Just like that, we're upstairs. It's dark, but for the soft glow of the Manifest Mind. He gives Oswen some Bardic Inspiration.

She realises the drift globe will try to follow her, be blocked and go out! She dashes over the cellar trapdoor and opens it just in time for it to drift up past a surprised Inafina, shielding her eyes as it goes right past her. Now we have very bright light. There's a (very, long-)dead body on the ground... Clearly, a struggle; some sort of shadow "residue" all over things - a kind of soot-like substance; and there, there are *two* shadows. It was worth bringing the light up.

She tries something new; she uses the staff to build a Wall Of Force to stop the shadows escaping.

Inafina runs in and, though it takes a full four attacks, she takes down the last two shadows. And we all feel a change... That encroaching sense of gloomy darkness dispels. Inafina perception ADV 1,20+7->27; Oswen 6; Bel 16; and downstairs, Kindle 25.

* Kindle notices that the woman has felt the change too. She gasps; "Father!"; she tries to get up, weak. Brn looks scared again; he's trying to hold her back, as if she shouldn't go. Kindle sees that Brn is looking to him, too, as if wondering *if* he should say something.

* Upstairs, Inafina can just hear a faint sound, something small and metallic, clinking down onto the ground. She tells Oswen who investigates; 31! She sees a *tiny* ring of dust settling around a small locket, which has burned a hole through the metal table above. It looks red hot. Fast-cast Detect Magic... There's a spell holding the locket closed and the remnants of some kind of pocket dimension that has just dissipated!

On top, the table looks like it was burned a while ago. It's as if the locket was burning through the table, disappeared, but then reappeared, almost as if no time has passed (but judging from the table, weeks have gone by). There's a tub of water by the bench - probably for cooling - and tongs, too. The tongs look as if they'd been used to hold the locket - was it in the forge? Then put on the table to be worked on; and then things went... Strange. Someone was heating it deliberately. The spell, abjuration, similar, needs to be countered - but she has a Chime of Opening, which seems a bit less dangerous.

She uses it. The Knock spell arising causes the lock to release; it springs open; there's a picture inside - if it's painted, it seems almost perfectly so - of two people. It's still cooling, so she uses the tongs to very carefully bring it over. We call the others up, but use kinda coded language to warn Kindle about the body - but the woman sees the body too soon and is, understandably distraught. "Father! No! Father!"

Brn is holding onto Kindle and almost hiding. Brn has seen this before, Kindle can tell, and is traumatised.

We wait a little while, for this to play out and give them some space. Then Inafina goes over to Brn and says, "I know this is very sad, but if it weren't for your bravery and your help, they'd both have died here. And maybe others as well."

Oswen and Bel are still with the girl. Oswen studies the body. Medicine check, with Bardic; 21; the life force was drained slowly and they've been dead for a few weeks. It's remarkable that the girl survived so long - Mirianne, it must be - she looks almost sickly. With a rest, hopefully, she'll be OK. But it's been too long for the father, by just about any spell.

Looking at the locket needs a magnifying glass. The picture is remarkable; how's it done; history 15, the people are familiar for some reason. A man that seems very handsome, long blonde hair, very fair, in gleaming plate armour; his arm, in a friendly gesture, is around a smaller, slighter, also quite good looking man with black hair, tied back with a circlet and wearing wizardly garments. Visibly carries a spell book. Heroic inspiration (from the hour attuning to the staff, when Kindle did his Thing too) - history 23 - oh. **A horrifying feeling!** A very, VERY old picture. **It is Vecna and Kas**.

It could be any of us, side by side. Friendship, good times. Love, in fact, probably platonic but even so. She just sits a while quietly.

Inafina notices; insight dirty 20; "What is it?" Oswen shows it. "But why is that *here?!*" - yeah, good question.

Bel has comforted Mirianne and she's calmer. "We have to... Bury him?" she says. Then she looks over to Brn; "Thank you; I don't know where you found these people to bring them here... Thank you..." - Brn is signing back and Oswen is watching. He "says", "I'm sorry I was too late. I couldn't get anyone to believe me. I was hiding. They're watching me all the time."

Oswen signs back, "Of course. Is that why you dare not speak out loud?"

Brn looks astonished but then signs - "No! No, they took my voice, so I couldn't tell anyone about them" - which Oswen hasn't heard of before; she tells Kindle; asks if he can help but Brn is already ahead of us. And we learn something horrifying - his voice has been "taken by" the people who run the inn. His parents were killed; the two there simply take their form.

And the story starts to come out. The locket was found at Mirianne's mother's grave; it was hanging on there. She had been asking around to ask whose it was, but neither of them could open it. Father started getting obsessed with opening it, going a bit crazy. Mirianne went to the inn to ask for help (Brn nodding, he remembers all of it). But the (at that time, still alive) people running it didn't know either. Brn was very young when he and Mirianne became friends and developed this "secret language", which fortunately, is Common Sign Language and that's how Oswen understands it.

Oswen asks and finds that Brn suspects others in town may have been replaced too, but he isn't sure. He's confident that the Sheriff has been though; he keeps putting up notices, that offer reward for adventurers. They come and never leave. Lately, things got a fair bit worse, as the situation seemed to escalate.

Mirianne already knew the locket was ancient from its techniques and metal, but does not know about the picture inside. We talk more about the odd events in the town - when the mists roll in, things get bad; in keeping with a bleeding-through of the Shadowfell. Oswen is forced to ask how Mirianne's mother died, but Mirianne doesn't really remember. Her father said she was ill and weak, and passed away from that. But later in her life, while still a child, the mean kids would bully her and call her the "mother killer"! Blamed her for the death. Her father always denied it. A baby couldn't be evil like that.

Mirianne figures, after Brn tells her the date, that she found the locket about 5 months ago.

* She wants to bury her father and show us the mother's grave
* Bel can disguise her
* We store the locked with the father, wrapped up, in the portable hole for a while
* Brn has become scared; he needs to get to his false-parents but they may realise he's done something and punish him; that's how he lost his voice originally
* Oswen says she thinks he should come with us; he looks happier at that, but asks her to promise that we "won't let them hurt me" like before.

"I won't lie to you. I can't promise very much at all as a fact, because I don't know what they are - what we'll be facing. But I can promise that we'll keep you close and do everything we can to keep you safe. And you've seen what we can do."

"Promise you will take me with you?"

"We won't leave you with them. In fact, we'll be trying to get your voice back, but first, we have to look after Mirianne's father. Come with us to the graveyard. It can't be much more scary than here!"

The sun is already getting low. Time is short. We hurry, partially disguised, to the graveyard. There are a few more people around. But now we're paranoid - which are real? Which are spies? We realise that our movements are now the same kind of furtive, yet purposeful and private movement that we observed in others. Brn, at least, has a bit more confidence!

Oswen whispers to the others as we go, "I hoped we might be able to find people, solve this somehow, fix the doorways and save the town; but I'm not sure there's much town left to save. Yet, I remember Otto's words - don't lose hope - so we have to keep trying for that."

At that opportune moment Orvil, perched on her shoulders, chimes in that "there are lots of ravens around - they could be watching us!"

The graveyard has a low mist, just above the ground, already developing. The trees seem almost barren. There's a groundskeeper, who may be a spy too, near a crypt; he just watches us, but could be equally suspicious of us. "This is just like Tasha's dream!" - except this is a much smaller, less "glamorous" graveyard. One small crypt and a lot of headstones. We follow disguised Mirianne, but she's very jumpy. We reach a grave with an empty plot next to it! The gravestone reads **Nerys**.

Oswen re-casts Detect Magic; is there anything special about this grave or the area around it? Odd. The mist itself is magical! Imbued with a certain amount of weak but strengthening enchantment school magic. The grave itself has nothing.

We start digging, but after a short while the groundskeeper comes marching up - "What do you think you're doing?!" but Mirianne pulls back her hood. "I'm sorry! I hadn't realised you were here. I haven't seen you in a while." Bel says, "She was looking after her father" and - the penny drops. The groundskeeper is rather distraught and asks about last rites or embalming. Kindle takes down his hood and the response is surprisingly deferential - apparently the groundskeeper recognises something in him, but is surprised when Kindle says he can officiate. Inafina insight 24. She's *sure* this groundskeeper is a "real" person. The initial reaction in Kindle's presence tells her that he's been *taught* to behave that way. Inafina whispers, "We're not with them. Whoever they are..." He looks almost caught out and tries to backtrack but Mirianne grabs his hands and says, "We *have* to bury father *before* nightfall! Please. This kind priest here saved me and he can perform the funerary rites. We *must* do this before nightfall or his soul will be lost; he will become - something else - please don't let the mists get him; you understand..." "Yes... But... I still need to - *we're in danger here* - I *have* to collect the fee... I'm sorry..." Oswen interjects, "What is the fee?" "It's a platinum piece! Those are the rules I've been told to enforce!"

Oswen reaches into her bag and pulls out two. "One for them, one for you to tell us who they are!" He pushes one back. "I will tell you if you can save us." Oswen counters with, "I can't promise to save you from something I don't know but I will try - we will try - just like we tried with Mirianne."

Apparently, *before* people started to vanish, before the mists, weird objects started to appear. And the more numerous the objects, the more strong the mist, the more people disappeared. "People here are not who they appear to be!"

People are lured to the inn and everyone ends up "sacrificed to the mist". He doesn't know why some are spared. He thinks a trinket is assigned to each person and, shortly after it appears, they disappear - die, taken, mind lost. One way or another. "It's a curse. Everyone in this town is cursed."

He's convinced the trinkets are linked to doors. It might be a reasonable theory. He thinks that finding the trinkets closes all the doors. Oswen opines that perhaps it's not many doors; just visions, facets of the same door, seen from many angles. If we can get through to the other side, we can close the door from there, once and for all. We now finally mention **Tovag** - her father **Bernald** had been saying, "I'm on my way, my love. I will find Tovag" - as if he expected to find her there.

We've started digging again while we talk. The groundskeeper has talked about just burying him in cloth - do we have a coffin? - we could bury them together in the mother's coffin? It's been done before. Oswen Spidey-sense, she argues *for* that. *Is the mother still there?*

Kindle carefully removes the body, and Kindle puts down some lights, then does the funerary rites. As he does, Oswen uses the lights to examine the locket - the body of the locket itself. Scratched onto the inside, a clumsy sort of inscription; a personal touch; the letters "K", "V". On the back there's an inscription in a language she doesn't understand so she has to start ritual-casting Comprehend Languages.

By the time the holes and dig-out are done, she is able to read a line of poetry:

*"Once two, become one. Two minds of like heart. Two souls of the same spirit."*

Nothing much to point to Tovag, or related to it, a desire to get there. Even so this is an item of great emotional significance. Arcana 27, remembering back to her more occult studies that had led her to Professor Roslov way back when - items of great personal significance can hold a person's soul to a place; speak across time and space; channel one's consciousness; anchor oneself to that item. It's *possible* that Vecna or (probably more likely Kas) might have their consciousness "leaking through" from it. But who brought it here? Did it just *fall* through? Mirianne was sure someone *hung* it on the grave. Tempt her with it. **There could be and is likely to be a third faction of some sort at work here.**

We have revealed a beautiful white wood casket, with floral designs. It's held up very well for 30 years. It's latched, not nailed, so Mirianne doesn't want to see, also holding Brn back - Inafina reaches down to open it with Oswen watching intently. A dancing light goes down. Just a black, lacquered hilt. Ornate, beautiful. She whispers to Oswen, "Mirianne's trinket? Could that be *the* sword hilt?" and Oswen nods. Detect Magic is still up. The earth had shielded this before; it's very magical, but incomplete. It contains an *extremely* old magic. The more she looks the more Oswen is almost pulled in - a strong evil - and she finds herself almost falling into the hole and Inafina has to catch her. Even from a distance Kindle looks up sharply and says "what's that?!"

Oswen looks to the groundskeeper. "I'm so sorry - what's your name?! I never got your name! I'm Oswen." He looks at her curiously; "**Elvon**. I'm Elvon." "Well, Elvon, I think your theory is looking pretty strong." "What theory?" "The trinkets." "Has some taken..." "Yes." "Oh no!" "No. Not bad. Maybe she's with others, after all. Maybe the father's hopes were right." "We do need to put the body in here? What do we say to them?!" - they'd see it was empty.

Oswen quietly pockets the hilt - "this is dangerous!" - "What are you doing?!" - "destroying it, I hope!" - "I hope you know what you're doing... Is this going to blow back on everyone in the village?" - "I'm just trying to help; we're out of time..." - the mist starts flowing into the hole now, which hides things. So we try to pretend things are OK. Bel is able to keep them occupied, even plays sad "funeral" music.

Once that's all done, we say to Mirianne and the groundskeeper, "I think it might be best if you two stayed together tonight. Do you have a home nearby?" "I sleep in the crypt!" he says. "It's a hallowed place. That's why we keep the deceased there until rites are performed. But no others may enter!" So we say to him, "Well, that sounds as safe anything. In that case, Mirianne, you'd better come back to your place with us."

The "sun" has just dipped below the horizon. As the groundskeeper hurries away and the mist rapidly builds, Oswen asks Orvil to keep above it and help us chart a path. People are closing doors, shuttering windows; we rush of Mirianne's place. We hear someone calling out, "Brn! Brn! Child! Get back here!" - and Kindle motions a "shhh!" to Brn. He plucks up his courage and keeps going with us.

We don't know how safe it is at Mirianne's; she closes doors, puts in blankets to keep the mist out; meanwhile we search for - evidence! Kindle helps Inafina look while Bel helps Oswen search; maybe there are writings or something else to explain what's going on. The perception roll is high, 24; hidden above an area that's almost an altar, a kind of shrine, picture of a beautiful woman, tucked up high; almost invisible; a very thin notebook, between wooden boards. She shows Oswen who flips through it.

Diagrams of swords. Calculations. Formulae; temperatures; schematics of how to separate a blade from a hilt. So what's going on? "I have to look" says Oswen "even if it's risky, especially now. We don't know what it broadcasts." So she pulls the hilt (out of her backpack, too risky to store with the Eye) and we can tell straight away that it matches the diagrams.

Someone very skilled carefully separated the two. Oswen goes to Mirianne and shows her the writing. "Do you recognise the handwriting?" "Of course, this is my father's. My I have a look at it?" - and she flips through. "What? Where did you find this?! It describes a very complex way of removing a blade from a hilt in such a way as to not damage either." Oswen says, "I know. And here's the hilt." "Why do you have that? That's the same hilt. Wait, what does my father have to do with that hilt?" Then she gets a bit suspicious. "Why do you have this?" - she's brandishing the notebook; slots it back into the space; "But I clean this house! How have I never seen that?!" - but when slotted into the place, the pages roughly match the wood grain. It's good camouflage. Oswen says, "And as for the hilt, I didn't really want to tell you but we have no choice - it was in the casket." "My *mother's* casket? Why would she be buried with this hilt?" "I don't know!"

**She flips through. Later in the notebook, she finds pages that are *not* in her father's handwriting. It's someone else's!**

She shows it to Oswen but can't read it herself. Oswen's Comprehend expires and she's forced to recast. People just stand a wait this time - which is quite stressful! - but then Bel announces he'll make some tea, getting Mirianne's help as a distraction. And Kindle starts to put up the dome. It'll feel safer.

The spell kicks in; this is old arcane script. It describes a cult, in essence! It's a way to complete a ritual. It talks about what is required; how someone who can create a shield to hide an object. **How to disguise something from scrying.** It talks about the requirements of it; that one has to willingly give up something that they treasure most. Knowingly. Not "kill" it, but forever be separated from it. That thing which is treasured most, takes on the characteristics of the thing you're trying to hide. **Their essences are swapped. But that thing, given up willingly, must forever remain lost; if the caster ever sets eyes on it again, the spell immediately breaks.** 

Oswen doesn't know who wrote this or how. Ancient script either way. Must have been a learned mage.

Oswen says, wrapped up in the academia of it and almost speaking as if Mirianne's not there, "I _think_ Mirianne's father must've come across the Sword. I don't know how. And must've recognised it for the danger it presented. Or he was told to perhaps. And he managed to split. But then he has two parts, which is safer than one, but only if they're hidden. His wive must've been in on it and - I guess - they made that sacrifice. She swapped with the hilt. If I'm right. But if I'm right, who or what, swapped with the blade, if it was swapped at all? How could we possibly find it? And the swap would be into Tovag, given what we were told. Must be how it works. Kas keeps thinking it's there. But it's here, we have it. And that means this locket is the key. But not the locket. He wanted to open it. **The key is the picture.**"

Mirianne is confused. He'd got over his wife, always talked about her as if she was dead. But then this locket appeared. It ate away at him. Perhaps he never shook the thought that he could find her, after all this time... Maybe he regretted it and wanted to undo it all?"

* **The locket was a trap**. Vecna or more likely Kas placed the locket.
* The father is lured via that will influence to rescue her.
* He goes to Tovag, sets eyes on her, that breaks the swap spell. The hilt shines as itself and can be found and recovered easily.
* But if *we* go to Tovag and rescue the mother, she'd still register as the hilt and be in the Outlands and be in terrible danger.
* We need to find her and the blade; only once we have the blade and made it plus hilt as safe as we can, could we safely bring the wife through.
* We think if she saw the grave or was close to it, that *might* be enough to break the swap.

"So - I didn't kill my mother...?" - Mirianne is in floods of tears.

Bel then says, "Oh. I have some bad news. Look around you..." - the smithy is no longer invisible. We are completely enveloped in thick fog. Oswen is holding the locket. It feels like an anchor. It's powerful enough, that emotional connection between it and Kas, to open the doorway. **And in fact it *has* already done just that, as we talked**.

Kindle uses Eyes Of Night to try and assess whether we can get out of this - 30ft Darkvision is shared with everyone except Brn, but Oswen gives him the Googles Of Night and holds him close, telling him not to worry. The area around is starting to look - how to describe it? Ethereal? It's heavily obscured. We're still in the blacksmith's, but the walls of the room are starting to look - phased, as if there's an overlap of planes.

We all roll badly for perception, except Bel, who's very on the ball; 18; "We'd better go!" - he sees through the window that shadows are riding in on the mist, heading straight for us.

Oswen says to Brn, "I've not forgotten about getting your voice back and I won't. But you'll have to be patient, because right now we have to run!" - aracana 26, looking for a way *in* to the Shadowfell at this point. The anchor - that is, the locket - is likely where a portal would come from, so if we keep together and keep hold of it we'll just phase into that domain. If we decided to run, we probably do have a few more minutes...

...so quickly she shouts, "Kindle, carry Brn! We must all keep close together, try to hold hands while we run, don't get lost in the mist... I've an idea; let's run for the inn, Brn, don't be scared! We're going to find your voice. We're going to find Mirianna's mother. We're going to find that sword and then we're going to find our way home!"

Kindle picks up and throws Brn onto his back! Then he draws his shield and weapon and charges for the door; Marianne in hot pursuit, "RUN! I know the way!", Oswen says, "Holds hands!" but not sure if anyone's listening, so then she and Bel chase after the other three and Inafina's in the rear. As we run, Oswen calls out, "The amulet I have will become the portal, but we have a few precious minutes before we to through".

Inafina's sending out radiant blasts behind us as we go, trying to keep the shadows away. Ahead of us is the path through the town square towards the tavern but the shadows swarm - Kindle shouts a warning and Inafina runs around to the front, shouts "GUARD YOUR EYES!" and throws a maximum 3-ki-powered Searing Sunburst ahead of us (20ft radius at 150ft range), 8d6; 28 damage if a DC17 CON is failed. All nearby shadow fail, so the next few seconds of running is cleared - but there are more beyond. That said, they are vulnerable to that damage - 56 damage equivalent, every single one dispelled instantly. The ground even has scorch marks. Other shadows screech and retreat; Bel is shouting, "Yes! Keep back you! More where that came from!" trying to be intimidating... They hold distance, the effect being a kind of hollow sphere, the walls made of shadows, as we move along. Whenever one breaks ranks, Bel, Inafina or Kindle are ready with targeted radiant attacks.

At the inn we see four very scary-looking figures emerge. These *used* to be the "parents" and two fake patrons we saw before. They're sort of morphing into something else. Arcana 28 for Oswen; husks kind of dissipating off, insides glowing deep purple, covered in layers of shadow; "Shadow demons, like in the cellar!" she calls. Then unexpectedly, she laughs. One of them holds a trinket on a bracelet, and seems to be holding that, as if it's important; it's magical and belongs in our world. "Let's see if we can find our voice!" while pointing at the trinket.

We need a lot of bright light. Inafina can do it for a moment. Kindle casts Light on Brn! Driftglobe's back out, albeit at maximum standard light. That'll at least give them something to think about. We only have a few seconds left, we don't know how long.

Initiative!

* Inafina ADV (from Kindle) 22
* Oswen 20
* Bel 14
* Kindle 7

Inafina sees the demon - looks like they were once "mother" - is the one with the trinket. Seems to be getting ready to act; looking at Brn, starts saying, "Naughty little boy! I warned you what would happen if you betrayed our trust!" - she reaches for the trinket and looks like she might try to break it.

There's a bit of distance, maybe 50ft. She might be able to get to that one in time... She gathers herself (Uncanny Metabolism) and throws another huge 3-point powered radiant blast, "AGAIN, GUARD YOUR EYES!" - 36 potential damage this time, DC17 CON again; this destroys the two patron shadow demons immediately, as both fail the save and take double damage. The other two make their saves. Inafina dashes forward, 50ft, uses another focus point to get a bit more energy (i.e. bonus action can be used for e.g. two attacks) - tries to grab the trinket; unarmed strike only 15, but it's enough; she's kinda grappling now; she punches right into the face with her free hand, stunning strike; hits, 8 damage -> 4 taken; but stunning strike CON save is 1! Stunned. It seems to become fully incorporeal, too. She realises she's falling backwards, because the trinket she holds has just pulled *through* the shadowy arm. This thing can't be grappled! She manages to hold her balance with an inadvertent step back.

Oswen thinks through various options but she's still too far away. In the end she goes with a high level Chromatic Orb, Lightning against the "father", knowing it'll only do "half" - 27 rolled, 13 damage taken - pulling along the manifest mind and moving the driftglobe to try and ensure good light coverage over the two of them. She gets as close as she can... About 20ft away.

Bel gets in between Oswen and Kindle (that is to say, Kindle not yet having acted on his turn, a small distance behind Oswen). He throws Psychic Lance at the "father", 23 potential damage, all taken as the demon fails the INT save; and better yet, it is Incapacitated. Bel throws Bardic over to Kindle for good measure. "Don't drop the kid!" - very inspiring...!

Kindle calls down Sacred Flame. The "father" doesn't manage to dodge and the 20 damage is doubled since it's radiant - and with 40, it's enough to dispel the demon, which shreds into dark ash. He gets closer, to bring his lights closer to Inafina and the remaining demon.

At the start of Inafina's turn, she rabbit hops back away from the "mother", then strikes twice with radiant blasts. They both hit, with 18 and 30 damage taken respectively. It's surrounded by light; it hisses in rage at Kindle at Brn; looks down at Inafina - "I won't forget *you*! I will haunt your nightmares, child!" - and it tries to escape. Moving *through* Inafina it heads into shadows behind our light area and hides there.

(It rolls stealth against future Perception checks). Inafina and Kindle can both see it; Oswen can't see it though. She runs around to that side of the inn and thinks about Thunderwave; but she knows now that Force would work; that means she has to blow a rather higher level version than she wants. So L4 it is! 5d8 but only 17 damage arising; but it dodges the worst; 8 taken. The damage still makes it move and yell, so that's enough for Oswen to know it's still up!

Oswen Arcana 24... A sense of panic... The shadow fell is about to wrap around us. The mists have overtaken the shadows! It's rolling around us. She shouts, "I'm a fool! We have only seconds; we must regroup!" and turns to head back towards the inn door. In a hurry Bel tries a Starry Wisp, but Oswen's shout scared him, nat 1; it completely misses and hits a wall behind, though at least that scares off some shadows hiding there!

Kindle runs over with the boy. Marianna has run up too, just Inafina at distance. Fingers firmly crossed, Kindle drags the beam through the inn diagonally, right over the "mother" that fails the save and is dispelled.

Inafina's on the very edge of the fog, which starts to rush in suddenly now - she has only a fraction of a second to try and roll out of the way towards the group - ACRO 18+7, 27 - she kicks off with both feet *and* the staff, flipping back up and over it as a lever, landing softly next to us as the fog clamps in around us.

We're enveloped...

...it feels like a tornado at first. We grab onto each other, holding tight. But then, we're in another land.



### Shadowfell

Fog rolls away from us. It looks like a battlefield, on the slopes of a hill. Broken bones, crushed helmets and armour, arrows, twisted broken swords, smashed wagons. It's almost as if set-dressed for a play! The fog, now below us, spreads away over other hills and valleys below.

There's a half-moon, with fast wisps of cloud. There are lights. Fires? Small keeps, dotted in the distance, looking like they're present for defence. It looks like there's a larger town a distance away.

Kindle swings Brn around. He's unconscious! Kindle cradles him. Oswen gently takes off the goggles. "We'd better get somewhere safe; if this is anything like the Fey Wild, we've no idea how time works and we don't know if other people who were pulled in, were necessarily pulled in here, or at a corresponding relative distance - but if Brn's parents are alive and did arrive here, they'd surely head for *closest* lights. That town is a long way away."

Mirianne is saying, "What? Where are we?" while Oswen is talking. Inafina then answers, "We're somewhere in a Shadowfell domain. We think this is where everyone will have been brought from town."

"Are they dead?"

"We don't know. But if they're alive, your mother - there is a tiny chance, a tiny one - that she is here and alive as well."

Oswen notices the Manifest Mind somehow came through and checks on Orvil who'd been hidden during the fight - she calls... (Orvil, CON save - nat 1 minus 1! - zero). The usual fey light that normally turns into Orvil explodes in a puff of black feathers! But - it's not a hawk. Orvil's a raven. Oswen goes, "What?" Orvil goes, "What?" - doesn't seem to even realise - suggests walking to the nearby top of the hill. *Then* he notices a wing - "Wait! I'm different!" - then he hacks up a hairball, or *something*. "My eyesight is *terrible*" he complains. Out loud! Everyone else jumps. The trouble is he mimic's Oswen's voice - it's quite strange.

At the top of the hill, we have a look around. New Orvil hasn't got the hang of raven eyes and just sees mist and bones! (Perception 10). But he does at least see a lot of lights down in the valley, peeking through gaps in mist, on the other side of the hill. Oswen, perception 16, looks the same way. A huge wall of mist and fog seems to block off the valley's end to her right. To her left, the row of hills levels out into plains, where the larger town is visible. Behind us, across a narrower, shallow valley is a keep; another one is along a ridgeline, near the end of where these hills drop to the town. There are keeps across the valley too.

The wall of mist is about 1 mile away. The encampment Orvil saw is only about another mile along, downhill; maybe 2 miles from the mist. The keep is some 2 miles away from *us*, 3 miles from the mist. We don't know who is who; the encampment might be an army that is "good", or "bad"; the keeps might therefore be the opposite. The town is 6 miles away. And whatever we do, the town is likely to be our destination.

"Let's start small. If we encounter something bad, we might at least stand a chance of fighting it - we're all getting quite low, and need a rest" - so she points to the closest of the keeps, the one 2mi away along the ridge.

"Should we try and have a rest here first?" asks Kindle; he can use his Prayer of Healing, it'll only take a few minutes. Well, not a bad idea in case we encounter bad actors at the keep. But we'll have to keep our wits about us - we've no idea what is out here that could be a threat.

Marianna stands watch, looking over the sleeping Brn too. Kindle casts his prayer; 2d8 healing and a short rest equivalent. Bel plays his magical song, too, giving us Heroic Inspiration. Oswen swaps Legend Lore out for Bigby's Hand.

Brn sits up. "Oh. How did we get here?"

We explain briefly. He remembers seeing Kindle "kill" the fake "mother". Then he thought he got hit in the chest and woke up here. "How did I get my voice back?!" We suddenly realise he didn't have it before! Inafina checks the trinket; it's broken. It must've been smashed in those last few seconds.

Oswen takes Brn to the top of the hill to give him the lay of the land and explain what her plan is. On the way back, Brn trips over something - "What's this?!" - a strange weapon, partly buried. He shows it to Mirriam. "That's... Weird" she says. She looks at it closely (investigation > 20). "This technique... This is - a technique my father uses. I didn't really think many other blacksmiths did this" - at this Oswen runs up and says, "don't touch the blade" - and casts Detect Magic. But it's not magical! Not the Kes blade in the father's hilt. But she *does* detect something odd around - low level necromancy over the entire battlefield.

Trying not to alarm Brn she says cheerily to the group, "OK, we need to leave right now and move very quickly towards that keep!" - worried this could be an undead field that might rise back to battle at some trigger.

We start walking. She whispers her concerns to Kindle. The weapons and armour show way more damage than you'd expect in one battle. So - as Oswen fears - does this army rise over and over, fighting again and again?

Mirriam's very concerned by the axe. It's definitely the father's technique. She puts it down, looks at another. She points out trademark metal layering in the blade for strength. It's a rare technique, we've not seen it elsewhere - certainly not in standard, non-magical weapons. So how can we explain that? We left the father to rest. She does leave the weapons behind, as Oswen is concerned at what they might mean if we were seen with them.

Conscious that the position of the moon relative to the big camp below might mean we're visible on the ridgeline, Oswen chooses - despite being a hurry - to walk just down off the crest, down towards the side where the encampment is so we can keep an eye on things, but below the position where we'd be silhouetted. She spends a while observing it - very big, some 1000ft wide, maybe twice as long. Definitely a camp - campfires, torches, tents. It's either a war encampment or refugees perhaps.

She to Orvil - "You know where we're headed, that keep?" "Yep" "OK, go check the camp..." - and the group meanwhile moves more carefully.

He flies away. A few other ravens and crows are around but don't pay him attention. He can see war machines; some siege machines, lying down rather than standing up. There are cavalry sections. Definitely an army. But it looks like the army has been camped here a long while; the war machines look old, sunk into the ground, having apparently been there some time. He flies in closer. Lots more birds down there. Soldiers, wandering around, dejected.

It seems organised in a way that has it faced in a particular direction - curiously, that direction is facing the mists, as if it wants to march outwards.

He sets down at the top of a larger tent, almost a marquee.

Suddenly, out from the tent steps a large, 8ft tall skeleton! WIS save. Only 7. He takes off in fear. This catches the skeleton's attention. None of the other birds around seem to react that way, he realises, so he's been caught out. That's enough recon for one day! He flies back at top speed to catch up with Oswen, but occasionally looks back and sees that the skeleton is watching the whole time. Beyond a certain distance he's sure he can't be seen, yet the skeleton (in full armour) is stood motionless, watching where he *was*.

Thinking back, he realises that some of the shambling and dejected movements were because it was a mixture of soldiers - some were alive, some were undead. Possibly even ghouls. There must be thousands of creatures there, though, one way or another.

Once back in range with Oswen he "makes his report", which certainly raises an eyebrow. They confer and do wonder if perhaps this army is some sort of attack force that Kas wants to bring out, from the Shadowfell and through that mist wall somehow. Given that people have been interfering and he's struggled to find the sword, that might explain why they seem to have been waiting a while? But we don't know how time works here relative to the Outlands.

Our guard is up even more, now. It takes over an hour to reach the keep.

Once we start discussing this out loud, Brn is surprisingly fascinated by it all and has endless questions. Mirriam on the other hand is not comfortable at all. It's not surprising. It doesn't help much that Bel is also quite out of sorts - the Shadowfell is pretty much by design the exact opposite of the Fey Wild, after all. He's talking constantly, trying to distract himself from his nerves. Oswen gives Bel the "task" of checking in on Mirriam and finding out more about her, what her upbringing was, just distraction really but there could be some useful details.

Just near the keep, we stay off the ridgeline and Oswen gets Orvil to fly in. There are a few roads leading up to the defensive main gate, on a craggy, rocky area. We'll actually be forced to drop onto a road for the final approach. The road continues down to the valley and the army, while another goes up to the flatter part of the ridge then switchbacks down to the flood plain beyond; that way to the town, then.

Orvil looks into a window, within 100ft range of Oswen. It has 20ft high stone walls and a gate with a small courtyard behind. There is a small area for stables. A central keep building is quite big, 4 storey, robust, squared off. There are watch towers on opposite sides of the outer walls but nothing in the middle area, just flat roofing. Orvil heads for the closest window, but then notices someone stood on top of the gate, on watch most likely. Looks human? Armoured though. It's still in range for Oswen to see that so she calls him back.

"It's not like we have many options, but it's certainly a bigger keep than I expected" she says.

We get onto the road and approach slowly. At the gate, the guard is leaning over with a heavy crossbow. "Travellers, state your business."

Oswen says, "We've just brought here from a village in the Outlands. This looks safe. Where we came in is not safe! We hoped to maybe stay here briefly, before moving on?"

"You realise this isn't an inn!" - huff! - "Wait here a moment".

Then there's a sound of a bell, sounds of people running up and down stairs, someone runs up and talks to the first soldier then runs back again; the whole time, we're being watched by that crossbow guard; then that guard finally moves away and we hear a lot of grinding and crunching noises as the gates are drawn open. Standing behind the gates is an old gentleman wearing almost a friar's robe, but short. He has a small round scull cap. His hands are steepled. "Good evening. Gold night tonight. Terrible weather to be travelling. We don't get travellers in these parts! Come in. The master will receive you!"

With some trepidation - at this rather curious welcome and well aware of the Shadowfell reputation for domains lorded over by creatures of great power, but also great evil - we follow. A woman stops in the courtyard to watch us; she's carrying a wicker basket covered in cloth. Bel nods to her; she nods back. Everyone, we realise, is watching us. We're asked to clean our boots on a small wet trough with brushes. Bel baulks at it as the water and brushes look dirty, so Oswen uses Prestidigitation instead. The castellan/monk notices; "Impressive... Well, welcome to **Tanner's Court**" - he bows rather theatrically. We are beckoned in.

Old money glory. A little faded, but not terrible; nor is it especially excessive in appearance. There are some vases with dried flowers; old brass chandeliers with soft lights, continual flams, and the feature pieces seem to be some beautiful tapestries on the walls.

We are led along this wide hallway to a sort of grand entrance area with stairs leading up either side. It reminds us of Zorhanna's place in layout, but this is much more spartan - bare stone with narrow carpets, square sections of stairs and 90 degree corners instead of sweeping curves. "Come through! The master is just in his contemplation chambers."

He knocks on double doors underneath the stairs. "Master! Master, the visitors are here!" - and we're asked our names; we introduce ourselves. The door is opened and we are announced! A runner carpet leads in to a low dais, 3 steps, where there are two large throne-like chairs. The one to our right is occupied. There sits an older-looking gentleman, 60s maybe, human, distinguished-looking, with grey hair swept back and a circlet holding it; wearing a deep green velvet jacket and satin trousers.

There are braziers on either side, but again it's continual flame use for light. The person stands up and walks down the stairs, holding out hands in welcome. In a calm, deep voice he announces, "Travellers in the night! This is rare. Welcome to my court! I'm **Eloitious Tanner**." He moves quite gracefully for the age. Perhaps a fighter or similar once.

He doesn't shake any hands; Bel steps forward and starts with standard courtly smalltalk; he does a bow and offering as if to receive the hand of the host; Eloitious waves it away, though. "That's not necessary! We're a humble household. A humble keep. I welcome you. I will have a room prepared for you if you would in the mean time like to join me for perhaps a bite of supper?"

Oswen has her suspicions about that lack of skin contact. Inafina insight 21, well, the wording seems deliberate; as if it were offering some form of protection; there doesn't seem to be subterfuge unless it's through that very careful wording. But he does keep his hands to himself; not much skin shown at all. Looks old, but surprisingly athletic for that age. But she notices something else - a conspicuous absence of mirrors *anywhere* in the keep. Without realising it, then, she is sharing Oswen's concerns.

Well, regardless, we follow on into the dining hall. Oswen trails. As quietly as she can, she casts Message to Kindle. "He's a vampire I think. He might have no ill intent, but we must be careful." ADV stealth 19.

Eloitious and Bel are in conversation. Then Eloitious smiles at Bel, turns his head to the side; "You are very astute; perhaps I am mistaken, and this well dressed courtier is not the spokesperson of the group after all?" - he stops and bows to Oswen! "You are indeed correct. I *am*, as you've noticed, not one who walks amongst the living - I wander the halls of the everlasting. But fear not; I mean you no harm. In fact I offer you my protection. At least while you are within these walls. Beyond them, my power does not extend. But no injury or harm shall before you in here. In the court."

Oswen says, "Thank you and forgive my indiscretion, Bel here *is* our Spokesperson as you can tell he knows the ways of the court and I do not. But we do thank you for your hospitality and hope you can understand our caution."

"No-one wanders through these hills unless they are able to look after themselves. And no-one braves the endless night of Tovag without a good reason."

"Well, at least I know we *are* Tovag now! We weren't even sure of that!"

In the dining room, he says, "I hope you will appreciate that I won't be joining you for supper! But I want to make sure that any who travel through these lands are well-nourished. The protection I offer you is actually self-serving, for you see, although I can control my urges, **Ranna**, my beloved, doesn't quite have the same control. Which is why she won't be joining us tonight."

So he protects us from the hunger of his - wife? Daughter, he says. An eternal companion, though. But who does it serve *him*? She could feed upon us!

"It would draw attention to us. I would rather the other lords of the land leave us alone; should any travellers meet their doom here - or worse, *rise* - that would seriously upset the balance of power. Especially now. In the vacuum."

"With Kas gone?" says Oswen.

"So you do know a little!" he says, tapping his finger to his chin.

The food is solid. Good cheese, nice bread, warm soup, slices of ham. Not fancy but good. Good wine too. We notice that he sips on the wine too, even if he doesn't eat.

Bel helps Oswen do the talking; Bardic given to her; Kindle and Inafina listen, Kindle leading since he got Oswen's message. Oswen ADV perception 13, tries Heroic doesn't help, but Bardic is +9 for 22 total. Kindle, ADV 19+8 -> 27.

Oswen tries to find out more. He says why we're here, but omits the part about searching specifically for the blade; but with truth, she says we're looking for people and were drawn here directly. And that army? Is it readying to leave?

There are big gaps in our knowledge! The army is "...the latest gathering. When the Tyrant *was* still here..." - and he says that in a way which gives Kindle and Inafina a sense that he's being really careful with chosen words, very guarded; Oswen's mention of Kas not being here had in fact *confirmed* a suspicion he had himself but had previously been unable to verify - "...he has for as long as anyone can remember been gathering the army. It's one of two things he does; one, find the sword; two, find vengeance. He realised that Vecna, his old arch enemy, had escaped the Realm. So he amasses his army to march through and attack! He doesn't know why he does it, really; the army goes through and, no matter how large it is, it never succeeds."

He goes on. "We don't know what happens, but sometimes the undead shamble back through the mist; nobody is ever able to relay what happens; Kas can't leave himself and his undead return with gaps in their memory. He's lost his temper, almost his mind sometimes, accusing his generals and even local Lords of working in conspiracy with Vecna to cause all of these failures. He always sentences them to permanent death when that happens and it can take decades for him to amass another army. So he searches for the sword, or some means of defeating Vecna for good. That's his punishment, I guess. But we're all trapped in here with him! Over the years, those of us that have learned how to survive have turned into what you see before you. But there are some of us who believe that the cycle has to be broken, somehow... In my younger, more impulsive days I sired Ranna; I know that to be a mistake and she resents me for it; she revels in the power she has, and delights in the hunger. But I will never do that again! I don't believe it is in our best interests ever to perpetuate that cycle of torment."

Inafina and Kindle are pretty convinced. Someone resigned to a battle that cannot be won. But he's talking around Kas's disappearance.

Oswen says, "Well, we're confident Kas has left, although I suppose it could be an exact double, but a double with at least as much magical power."

He sighs. "Kas is not a wizard. Kas is a warlord. Albeit one with a lot of power. But not a whole lot of magic. The tyrant has never created a simulacrum of himself in the centuries that we've known him. But nobody has really seen him - nobody has entered the castle - in a long time; they are forbidden; it is forbidden ground unless one is invited. And only the Tyrant himself can invite you."

Mirriam finally loses patience. (Nat 1 on a WIS check!). "Where did - we walked through a *field* of dead, with battered weapons - they are unusual in make! Do you know where those weapons came from?"

He looks surprised. "So you walked through one of the fields of dead. They're not as you think! But without someone to command them, they don't rise. The field near here is contested. A delicate balance of power between three lords, myself included. None of us can get the edge over the other! So none of us dares outwardly claim that army. And if we do claim an army, it just gets taken to be part of the main army anyway. The army there though, I believe it was sent from the Capital before it fell. Can you describe the weapons?"

She describes the technique.

"Ah, yes. Reasonably common; the royal armoury has many of those weapons."

That's in the Capital; this and Kas's Castle are a distance away, larger than the town - a few days of travel. These are the "frontier forts" of Tovag. The frontlines of "this pointless war".

(Long RP follows, not noted word for word) - We get into it. We avoid talking of the sword, but learn that there *might* be a chance of lying our way into the Castle; Eloitious hadn't considered it for fear of meeting Kas there but we think - hope! - he is gone. In the end, too enticed by the prospect of escape (since we had a way in, we know Kas had a way out and we promise we'll share our findings of an exit with Eloitious) he agrees to talk to someone who *was* invited to find out the process. None other than his daughter.

"**Marvon** will show you to your room."

We are told to enjoy the Keep; public areas are unlocked; under no circumstances should we go downstairs! He can extend this hospitality for 24h.

The room is being prepared; we wait in the library. Oswen looks around. Lots of old poetry! Some philosophy. Some old manuscripts turn out to contain musical scores, usually for entire orchestras. There's a lot of art, too and books about various artists. One section is full of books about nature and animals. These are rare, at least from a Toril perspective. Oswen hasn't seen many before. But history and magic are conspicuously absent. Religion, too.

While we wait we walk more about Vecna and Kas; perhaps Kas was wronged by Vecna - Kas wasn't "the betrayer" - this explains why he seemed so obsessed, in a *wronged* kind of way. Who knows.

Once the room is ready, Marvon arrives to lead us upstairs. A blood-curdling scream from below makes us jump! Then there are lots of yelling and screaming noises. A big argument. Marvon sighs. Apparently this always happens "when she doesn't get what she wants".

Before bed, Kindle and Oswen discuss ethics at some length. Letting Eloitious loose on another plane is one thing - but what about Ranna?! We find no answers.

Eventually we start to prepare to sleep. We let Mirriam and Brn to sleep. Brn wants to help on watch but we manage to talk him out of it!

Bel and Kindle are very alert overnight, but notice nothing untoward. Inafina (10) falls asleep! Oswen (16) does OK though and also - nothing strange. We all notice occasional strange noises and it's weird that it's forever-night, but that aside, it's a surprisingly "normal" sleep.



## Campaign Day 40

No dawn. Weird!

We pack up and head downstairs to see if Eloitious or Marvon are around. Marvon is there, tending to the keep, with another helper. We're offered breakfast and, at first, politely decline since we can reach the village for supplies, but he insists it's no trouble and we opt into whatever they're already cooking. A small bowl of hard-boiled eggs is produced in due course, with a tray that has an assortment of jams and preserves, along with hard bread - almost oat cakes, a kind of breakfast biscuit.

Just as we're finishing, Eloitious arrives. After smalltalk, we head to the library. He produces a rolled-up map, clears a big oak table and lays it down. He points to where we are. Infina starts making a copy of the important bits! We're near the edge; the fog wall boundary "ebbs and flows, like a beating heart". The closest town is only 1-2 hours away along the road, mostly downhill. It's called **Abergest**.

He shows where the main road out goes; through a pass and then, once through, out of the ranges; we're on an elevated plateau here, apparently. We then drop down to fertile plains. The city is **Tovagen**.

The conversation with his daughter did not go well (as we indeed heard!). "I don't suggest this lightly... But..." (he goes quiet, lost in thought for a moment, giving us a strange, searching look) "...Ranna is very strong-willed, suspicious and impulsive - but extremely passionate too. Once she sets her mind on something it is hard to change her course. She has refused to share the information with me; she's not refusing to share, just not *with me*. I fear this is simply her ruse to meet you."

"I think that could be accommodated", says Oswen.

"But this is exactly what I was trying to avoid! I'm sure you are very capable. But I must warn you. She has a way with words. Even with me, she often gets what she wants and I have known her for..." - a pause, a change of mind on stating a more precise duration - "...a very long time."

There's an alternative route, meanwhile, to the city. The pass is guarded with watchtowers. There's a toll gate. A group as small as ours might make it. If for some reason we "did not want to announce" our presence, we could travel _higher_ into the mountains. There's another way through. Eloitious points. "This is an old route, which cuts through the mountain. Old tunnels. I can't say I have been through there in a very, very long time; I don't know what awaits you in there. They're old. Old warrens. Could be inhabited; it could be dangerous."

We will give it thought.

"There is a gate town here, on the other side of the toll gate. It's a service town of sorts, but it does have a lot of goods. You can drop into there from the high pass easily enough. The watchtowers don't pay attention to the town - their concern is watching and controlling those who would come through the pass. Especially if they arrive to the gate without having been seen leaving beforehand!"

He goes to a drawer and pulls out a large emblem, palm-sized, wrought metal with red silk tassels at the top. "This is mine; I can't give it to you; but if you found a way to get one of these, anyone trading - and the armies and of course the lords - have one of these that allow them to travel back and forth. The temporary ones are smaller. Rectangular. Those are not identified for specific people, unlike this one. They're given one as they leave the plains and go through the pass to these highlands and return them when they had back."

We ask about Ranna. He doesn't know what she'd want. He's not even sure if he'd want to leave her behind, or bring her. He says he has the means to "control her powers" but others don't have those same means.

Time to see Ranna. Oswen choses herself and Kindle, but Bel wants to go. He has counter-charm, he's persuasive; it's a good argument but it just tips over to Kindle. Oswen and he are not persuasive but we're mentally resilient and Oswen can bolster that. She really values Bel's character but also really wants a - more devout opinion. Bel concedes and instead opts for Bardic for us both. Bel then plays a song we heard on the Radiant Citadel; it's Protection from Evil and Good on Oswen. Oswen casts L4 Intellect Fortress on Kindle *and* herself for good measure, in turn and the two of them head off.

Eloitious takes us to spiral stone stairs heading downwards one level. Downstairs, he unlocks a heavy wooden door and walks along a corridor; then we reach a room with a beautiful, heavy oak door. He traces some kind of sigil or other pattern on the door; it's disabling some kind of ward and it unlocks. He pushes it open and gestures for us to enter. So we do. Eloitious says he'll keep watch outside the door.

As soon as we walk in - DEX save, Oswen; 12 - a gust of wind and, suddenly, next to her is very beautiful 13-14 year old looking girl. Permanent teenager! Beautiful makeup, blood red lipstick, pale, but probably would look just as striking without it. Dark red, auburn curling hair. An intense but beautiful brocade purple and silver dress, with gloves on. She smiles - very toothy! - "Aaaah! You are the guests! I *knew* you would come and see me. *Fantastic*. Please. I was just playing a little game! Come and sit down with me!" - she grabs Oswen's hand and pulls her towards the corner of the room.

There stands a very over-the-top gothic mansion dolls house. Very ornate. It's split open on the hinge, with all the rooms visible.

"I'm Ranna. And you must be... Hold on..."

Oswen ADV WIS save, 27, as Ranna attempts to read her mind. Oswen pushes back. Ranna scowls. "I just wanted to know your name!" Her mood has changed.

Oswen says, "My name is Oswen but if you want to read what's in my head, well, let's see how this game goes."

Ranna gives her a dark look. She thinks for a moment. Then she perks back up. "I'm sure you don't want to play little girls games anyway - alright..." She sits on the ground. "Sit with me. You too!" (Oswen says, "Oh, that's Kindle!") - so we both sit.

"You're very warm! I can feel your body heat radiating off, like a furnace!" says Ranna.

Ranna confesses that she was invited to dance for the Regent at the city. "You see, I am an excellent dancer!" - she leaps to her feet and does a twirl; bounds to the four-poster bed, swings around it acrobatically, does a sort of ballerina kick and a finishing flourish and a bow. We applaud! "I don't need your applause! I've honed these skills over a long time. The Regent; a solo performance; I was *invited*."

She continues. "How do *you* plan to be invited? What skills do you have that the Regent would want?"

Kindle, insight; 15; he is thoughtful; what has or has she not been told? That seems out of line with what we discussed yesterday.

Oswen figures only Kas can do that but this is an interesting thread anyway, even if nonsense; so she says, "We don't know much at all about the Regent. But you must know something of them, since you danced."

"He was frightening! Not a nice man at all. They call him the Tyrant. But I don't think they should've called him the Tyrant. The Smelly Old Man With The Angry Face would be better!"

Oswen laughs at that. Apparently his hair is greasy and smelly these days, and he has a long, poorly kept, excessive moustache. "And he wears armour I *swear* he never takes off. It smells like something is rotting in there and it's not just him!"

We ask about the invitation. "It was brought to me... Would you like to see it?!"

"Yes!"

She grabs Oswen and Kindle and pulls us towards the door. Oswen says, "Ah, is it upstairs?" "It's in my room!" - she calls out to Eloitious. "Eloitious my love! I need to go to my room! They want to see something I have!"

Eloitious opens the door and stands there arms crossed. "You're not going upstairs my dear!"

Oswen tries to counter... "Surely we're not leaving so soon? It's true it's a child's thing, but the doll's house alone is very beautiful and worthy of more inspection." Deception 22. She might be swayed... Kindle, insight 19 (blowing Heroic Inspiration). He says, "Master Tanner, I don't suppose *you* could fetch the thing for Miss Ranna from her room?" Oswen chimes in trying to be persuasive to go along with it - tell Eloitious where it is or similar - however despite using the Bardic - D10 only 1! - total is 18, which isn't great.

Ranna tries a new tactic. She tries to Charm both of us! Oswen can't be charmed; she acts a bit like she did with the mind read attempt and laughs, saying, "You play a good game!" - Kindle ADV save, 25, fully resists. And that means we're immune to her charm. She is *really* laying it on. Sparkling eyes, gleaming teeth. Even emanates a kind of perfume!

Oswen says, "No lie, no deception. You are very beautiful and very persuasive, and you play a good game. But there is so much more we can do in here first."

She realises what's happened. The demeanour changes completely. A loud huff. She turns to Eloitious and says, "Fetch me my music box!" He looks to us, "Are you going to be all right for a few minutes?" Oswen says, "Your beloved is charming. We will be fine, thank you."

As the door closes, Oswen senses the charm being re-established. Kindle grabs Oswen's shoulder; Ranna immediately side-eyes, senses Eloitious has gone and now she's changed again. This time, it's menacing, almost maniacal. "And what will you give *me*?"

Oswen lets her know that we found our way in (she already knew) so we think we might find our way out. Ranna gets excitable. She'd certainly want to get out; to get to other lands. "I want to eat all the food, drink all the drink!" She wants to see it *all*! She has grand dreams. Many of them sound absolutely fine - were it not for her method of feeding. "Nothing here possesses even an ounce of joy. This world is shrinking around me!" - Oswen mentions Thay at one point as an option but the response is, "Ugh! I hate vampires!"

Insight from Kindle on her little speech, 21 with Bardic. Kindle and Oswen are both using a bit of coded language. She's not lying about much of it - has had bad experiences with vampires here - and she's read of many other places. She does want to *taste* those foods and drinks, at least; she wants to sense it all. But she has desires and hungers of her own as a vampire and all of it, all of these different things, are unchecked and unbounded.

She almost whips herself into a frenzy. Almost an unbridled passion; she loses herself in things. And now Oswen understands Eloitious's description of her. Amazing in a good mood, but it turns bad on a sixpence.

She wants a taste of Oswen's life. "How?!" "I have a special ability... I can stop any time I want..." "You mean literally drinking my blood, don't you?!" Oswen isn't fully sure what that involves. Arcana with Heroic, only 19; it's not lycanthropy, so it won't "infect" her, but clearly this is extremely risky. She's persuasive; 17; against a lucky roll of Insight, 21.

Kindle's unhappy. Oswen's aware. So she counters, "You know I'm interested, if perhaps not for the reasons you think. But how can *we* make sure you don't take too much?"

She suggests we wait for Eloitious to return and do it with him present, and him aware that it's voluntary. And she'll take it from the wrist, too!

Oswen thinks a minute. Then says, "Agreed. Sorry Kindle. But I think this can work. We'll talk about it later."

Ranna is besides herself with excitement. When Eloitious returns, Oswen starts to explain. Eloitious shouts, "No!" - his eyes get a wild glow. Fangs appear. He's scary. "No! There's *one rule* in this house! You do *not* feed on intelligent beings! Did I not make that clear?!" - Ranna hisses back and now it's just vampires fighting.

Kindle and Oswen try to step in. Oswen apologises for perhaps overstepping boundaries and rules. It turns out Ranna has done this before, but never knows when to stop! Kindle points out the wrist and physical intervention rule. Eloitious thinks a while. Assesses it. Looks carefully at Oswen. Then after a long, long pause... "Fine. This is the *only* time. In fact it's the *LAST* time you try and pull something like this on me!"

Oswen tells Ranna that this is a good opportunity to learn the good *and* bad. If Ranna were to feed on the unwilling in a world where she chose to *not* hang out in a place that welcomes her kind, she could be vilified; hunted; she must try to understand the positives, *and* the risks. The boundaries we have in our "living" worlds.

Oswen D10->6; the 10 minute time is nearly up. We don't know how much longer she have with Bel's spell; but it's too far gone, she's got to chance it.

"How about this hand?" - left hand - so Oswen offers it back. Oswen's a bit shaky. Ranna wipes her hand down with clean cloth; "It just stings a *little* at first, but then it'll be amazing. It's going to be alright..." - she lifts the wrist up... Then there's a piercing. "Ouch... Not too bad though!"

Oswen feels a moment of panic, but the spell suddenly drops and that panic changes to a strange warmth. WIS save ADV 22; joy, surprisingly; memory; she realises she can *choose* what kinds of things she wants to feel. Whatever she's feeling, Ranna's feeling, she thinks. So Oswen runs her emotions through. Dancing; listening to Bel's music; fighting a terrible creature; eating good food; fear of that mind flayer... 2D6->6 HP lost (so max HP down 6 too).

She says, "That's some of it. What do *you* want to know, time is short?"

Ranna looks up, flooded with these strange things; "I want to feel... I want to feel like the centre of the world! I want to feel like the centre of attention. The most important thing ever" - Oswen insight 17, she realises that Ranna doesn't know the concept of *love*.

Oswen says, "Understand, this is very rare. This is very precious. And it *is reciprocal*. It's not all about you; the feeling must be shared, else instead of being one of the best feelings, one-sided it can be one of the worst." And she thinks of Leonidas. Another 2d6 but only 5 this time.

Ranna is getting wilder. She loves the feeling... She almost loses herself at the *idea* of being a centre of attention. But then she feels *actual* love! **Her eyes widen and she pulls abruptly away,** disengaging immediately, to Oswen's surprise; she almost pushes Oswen away, instead pushing herself to the corner of the bed; she's curled up, knees up to shoulders, head down. She shakes her head.

Eloitious comes over to Oswen looking alarmed at the wrist; "Oh dear!"; it's spurting blood, as Ranna pulled away improperly; "Do you trust me?!" "I'm in no position to do otherwise" - Eloitious bends over, licks it (!) and it seals the wounds; another 1d4->1 point of piercing. "Thank you" says Oswen. "Is she OK?"

Kindle is triggered by compassion. He goes to Ranna. "Are you - are you OK?!" - she looks up, crying tears; blood tears. "I will never feel that. I will never feel that! It's so beautiful! Oh." Clearly she believes she will never be capable of having that kind of feeling; so she doesn't feel that way about Eloitious.

She sobs quietly for a while.

Oswen meanwhile looks to Eloitious. "Don't take it personally. As you know, there are different kinds of love; the love of a family is not the same as with a romantic lover."

Ranna's smart. She knows her physical appearance puts her at too young of an age. Oswen can't help but sympathise a little. But Oswen may have made things worse; the only way to experience that feeling is to drink it out of people, but it's hard to control and she can kill those from whom she drinks - and to kill them would make her very guilty.

This is a vampire. Powerful, capricious, dangerous. And somehow - not actually evil. Guilt doesn't match with evil. That's why, ultimately, she agrees to Eloitious's rules.

It's quiet for a while.

Ranna clears up and gathers herself back together. "That was... The most amazing thing, thank you..." - then to Eloitious, "Did you bring it?" - he hands over the music box. She winds it; it opens, pretty music plays. She opens a panel in the bottom and pulls out a folded red envelope. She opens it. "A fair trade. You'll need use some trickery with it! Change the date and all that... But... It's yours." - she hands it over.

"Do you promise, if you can find a way out, you'll come and get us?"

"Yes."

"Don't forget me."

"Not likely to. But don't forget what I said. If you break the rules up *there*, you can end up with an army on your back! Pick the places you visit with care."

She smiles wryly. "Let's pick this conversation up another time. You'd better get going. Unlike me, you don't have all the time in the world!"

On impulse, Oswen gives Ranna a hug. Surprisingly she hugs back. "Thank you for coming down to see me. I had a lot of fun today!" She dabs away a last tear. "Good luck."

Then she snaps at Eloitious, "I'd like to be alone now!"

And so we retreat.

As we leave the room, at the edge of hearing, the sound of sobbing. She's crying again. Eloitious hears it too.

As we're walking to the stairs, "That was a very, very dangerous thing you just did. If you take risks like that too much, one day the dice will not fall in your favour."

Oswen nods, and explains a bit more about Vecna and him taking over worlds; the "nexus city of the planes" (without naming Sigil, since that name would mean nothing to him) being closed; the stakes we're at now and the extra level of difficulty introduced by Kas's unexpected involvement. "You're right that I must not take risks lightly, or often. But the stakes are extremely high. Sometimes, it seems the only choice I have."

Upstairs, Bel comes running over. He's been fretting terribly. He looks Oswen up and down. "I know I don't look great! But I'll be fine. It went well, although, rather sad in its own way."

Marvon comes in with a package of food! "Wow! Thank you. That's great!" "This might be nicer than rations, if you're on the road." "Definitely!"

A loaf of bread, a jar of preserves, a chunk of cheese and in a waxed cloth, several slices of ham. "If these are as good as the breakfast preserves, we're going to enjoy this a lot!" and hugs Marvon - he's being hugged by this big rabbit... He's rather awkward but seems to appreciate the gesture. "Good luck; travel well! Stick to the roads! I'll see you to the gatehouse."

Eloitious says, "I hope you understand I'll say goodbye to you here. Good luck. I hope to see you when you have some good news."

"Yes. Us too."

We walk with Marvon to the main gate. The guards crank it open and he waves goodbye as we walk out onto the road, turning this time downwards, towards the small town.

(End of Part 2.16)

* SENDING STONE: We have a one-a-day cross-planar stone for Vi, Allustriel, Mordenkainen, Otto and Otiluke.
* OTTO'S SONG: If we are in need, Bel plays this and it'll be heard across planes.
* KNICK KNACKS: From Trade Gate for Fey Wild.
* OSWEN TO MAKE SURE MAZTIKTA IS NOT MISTREATED


SUMMARY OF THE EIGHT:

* Jallarzi / Otiluke: Oerth, Greyhawke, ongoing fight to defend that city.
* Vi: Establish comms, starting Toril.
* Mordenkainen / Golden Vault: Find and secure artefacts - and find a way to destroy them!
* Alustriel: Help with rod assembly
* Zorhanna: has good skills to try and find the base of operations
* Bigby: Evacuation. He is good at moving people between places and planes and he's small so gets overlooked!
* Otto: World defence. He's happy with that - *diplomacy*, convincing governments to act together

* Jallarzi and Otiluke - OERTH - before going, Jallarzi says to Oswen - **"I don't know what it is, but something in me tells me that you have a very important role to play; and there's a connection between my patron, myself and you. I am certain that our paths will cross again. I don't know how or when, but I know they will. Take care and thank you for everything you have done - for rising to the occasion when so few others I know would have.
* Alustriel - will work on how to assemble the Seven Parts. Meanwhile, will FIND IGWILV/TASHA, then tell us where to go - get info about Vecna; an earlier version of Tasha in a mirror dimension; "The young Tasha doesn't know she turns bad and cannot know! She'll find out eventually, but we need her help."
* Mordenkainen - GOLDEN VAULT: Two important artefacts to track down. Eye & Hand of Vecna. Stretch goal, Sword of Kas? **We are asked to find info on this if we can while waiting for Alustriel**. Rumour says that they can only be destroyed by a person using both the eye and hand together, who is killed using that sword. We will ask around at Outlands. MK simply says he'll check "the seedier planes"!
* Vi with Bigby's help - TORIL, resistance. Portal via ruined tower outside Misty Forest & then who-knows-where. Otto also going, at least for some of the time, to see how they make all that work. It's a question of world defence for Otto - diplomacy, getting the groundwork done in advance, as much as possible.
* Zorhanna - Observation at giant tower in Outlands and general recon. Trying to find what world Vecna might hit next. Otto can then travel to begin evacuations having "studied under Vi" at Toril. Zorhanna would follow quickly behind.

OLDER STUFF

* Jemima 'caretaker', Loren runs the bar
* Tailor Tatoun arrived, got injured and left behind, decided to join Jemima and help out; still trades with his old company if they stop by (!)
* Lawyer and bookseller Arden; lawyer; owes some kind of debt to Loren
* Husband & wife, Orta and Llena. Nursed back to health here. Adoptive child **Malek**'s location? Maybe offer Sending to contact? Else they expect him to one day return
* Jordun ex-slave tribes person wants to find others of his kind in Brimstone Hold (one more works on the docks already)
* Half-orc Bart organises the caravans; just here as a trader

"We haven't reached where we need to be yet, but we are a *long* way from where we started."

OBLIGATIONS
