# Oswen: Part 2.5
## Sigil, campaign day 13 / Sigil day 2
### Hive Ward (The Grease Pit), morning

We aren't sure what to do today. We're here on nebulous grounds; to "get better", to be able to tackle whatever the next mission is from the Golden Vault, and perhaps to advance our understanding of the threat of which the Far Realm creature was so scared. We have a shard from a ship that crashed on our plane but didn't get further with that investigation really, save to say that it was definitely an interplanar craft.

Morden Kainen wrote us a letter and that's *weird*. Prone to drama or not, per Eggsy, we think finding him could be good; but this city is overwhelmingly large and people don't seem to register their presence (we certainly didn't) so we don't know how to do that. Perhaps Fell can assist.

He's busy with a customer when we get there. We figure that it's "business hours" so we'll try to keep things simple and not try and tap him for a wide range of information! So, instead, we ask how we might find Morden Kainan. Since Fell is also part of the Golden Vault, that's not hard - he already knows that Morden has a tower in "Market Ward". An address, of a kind, is drawn in the air. Surprisingly it seems close by - the next ward over - so we figure we can be adventurous and go on foot.

He asks why and we give him the abridged version. He says we're in the right place to investigate multi-planar incursions; Sigil is connected to *almost* everything. Just not the "deep" Ethereal and Astral planes.

There's what Fell describes as a "useful library, if you want to learn more" - it's next to the Hall Of Records, that used to be part of a college on Sigil. It had seven towers, six of which became the Hall Of Records when The Fated - who run the city - foreclosed it due to unpaid taxies and levies from that college! The seventh tower was the library, and still is, but is run independently. It's in the **Clerk's Ward**.

He gives us an overview of Sigil for good measure.

* The "fanciest" part is the Lady's Ward, where we started
* The Lower Ward holds the factories, which we went past
* The Hive Ward is where we are
* The Market Ward is adjacent
* The Clerk's Ward is after that, then you've wrapped all the way around to the Lady's Ward again
* There's "The Undersigil", a city-beneath-the-city - we'll save information on that for another day!

Fell also warns us that magic works a bit differently. It's a nexus _between_ planes, but not _in_ a plane. **Summoning spells and banishments do not work** - that writes off a chunk of Oswen's spell list! Worse, if one attempts Summoning, it might actually _work_ but only do so by pulling the summoned creature from somewhere else in Sigil. One minute, a fire elemental is having a drink at the bar; next minute it's stood next to you, very annoyed.

Deities are absolutely banned, too. He mentioned that before but elaborates; there's simply no way for them to enter Sigil. After some discussion, Oswen learns that it's not that The Lady fears them - she's powerful enough to stop them getting in, after all - it's more that those gods represent a potential threat to everyone else in Sigil. She doesn't want to deal with that. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, they *were* allowed, but they've not been let in for a very, very long time. They just caused too much trouble! He does remind us that the gods have many *agents* within Sigil, though. They just can't get out of balance, as if they do, the Lady intervenes.

(It's not just gods; any being of sufficiently high power might well be prohibited from entry).

Fell tells a story. A faction called **Incantarium**, very powerful magic users, had a huge tower - the Tower Sourcerous - in the Clerk's Ward. But its members tried to gain too much power. They believe the multiverse started from a single point of great energy, but has spread out too much now and is thus weakened; they want to collapse it all back, so they absorb the magical essence out of things to feed back into the core of the Tower Sorcerous, hoping to consolidate magical power back into one point. It went too far, and they were banished by the Lady, tower and all. However, the Tower returned about a year ago; it landed in the Clerk's Ward and destroyed a section of buildings there! It's making a lot of people uneasy.

Oswen thinks... "That's coincidental timing", she says. Fell counters by saying that he's fairly sure that if the Lady Of Pain wanted them gone, they'd be gone. So perhaps they're not the threat - perhaps she thinks they're needed for defence.

If she's that powerful, could anything truly be a treat? Are things running from something they believe to be a multi-planar threat perhaps running wisely as they themselves are indeed at risk, but the wider multiverse ultimately could not be destroyed? Fell points out that it isn't believed that the Lady has any concern *outside* Sigil. She will protect this place, but anything happening outside doesn't bother her. The entire multiverse outside it could be destroyed, so long as Sigil itself remained in balance. There have been prior threats that were severe enough for her to "close all the doors" and isolate Sigil; once things calmed, she re-opened them and lets Sigil rebuild things anew. Fell believes that our current multiverse, everything we know, was seeded from Sigil after that last reset. The city in which we stand is the cradle of creation. It's so old that, for all intents and purposes, it has **always been here**. It could, depending on your perspective, be considered to exist out of time.

Indeed, Fell says that it's believed *some* doors - if you can find them - open to past, or future versions of the same plane. And, he reminds us, even different "versions" of that same plane, as he'd said the previous night.

Eventually we wrap it up and thank him, head out, and follow his directions to head for Market Ward.

Oswen aids Inafina, survival 16. Getting to the ward is easy - finding the tower, less so. It's a large, sprawling area, feels "middle class" and (unsurprisingly) is not just a bunch of connected markets of some sort. Orfil flies up periodically to give a view, since the air is less crowded here. One thing that catches the eye is what would be, to us, a Roman-style gymnasium; it's a big very building that we can't see inside, but there are various courtyards outside with people doing various forms of training. Some of it - military-like drills - we easily recognise. Other things are curious - almost activity for activity's sake?

One area has various spikes and arches with thorns coming off, part of a labyrinthine set of buildings almost piled on top of each other rising on a hill almost 300ft up. Orvil has to keep low here as the sky is very busy! There's a huge building at the top, with a massive causeway and raised bridge; and, to our astonishment, a *red dragon* emerges from great doors there. All sorts of winged creatures fly in and out. Then, even more frightening - **a beholder**. Oswen stops dead at that and stares. "I never thought I'd see one of *those* this close" and points.

Oswen (self-set DC13 WIS save to stay on mission) WIS save 12. So, she convinces the group to get closer - surely we won't get an opportunity like this again! - but we're certainly quite scared. We make our way towards the onramp to the giant causeway. Once on it, it's strange. The causeway looks like it is a moderately steep ramp, but once on it, "down" is directly downwards and it's "flat" from our perspective. Looking up above us, we see a strange, almost over-the-top glowing radiant angel flying towards the building; then - loud thuds! - the red dragon starts walking towards us!

There are lots of people on the causeway, who make way for it but otherwise pay it no mind. As it walks past, Oswen can't resist. She waves and goes, "Hi, I'm Oswen!" - persuasion is only 9. She's too quiet to catch the attention of this huge creature, especially over the loud thudding footfalls. As it passes, she realises it's even trying to take care not to 'swish' its tail too much and knock people off the causeway. If it tried to take off here, the downdraft would probably throw everyone off the sides!

We carry on. We see Dwarven lettering on the building that she recognises as such but can't read; underneat, in Common, "**The Central Bank Of Abbathor**". She says, almost disappointed, "Oh, it's just a bank!" - HIS check, 20(!)+5->25. She knows the name... It's a minor/obscure god on Toril; the **Dwarven god of greed**! It's "blamed" for the 'curse of gold' of Dwarven myth. She says, "Well, even so, I don't see why a beholder needs gold..." but Inafina says, "Well, it's probably the only way to buy the vegetables on sticks. I mean - it's gotta eat *something*!"

The building is made of huge marble blocks. The main door is at least 50ft wide and high - the whole thing is on a dragon-friendly scale - and closer, now, we see a great list of some 60 or so names underneath the main heading. "Sigil" and "Mithril Hall" are included; so she thinks it's a list of cities. She thinks another couple are Toril cities she's vaguely heard of including one called "Maztica" but no others, so whatever this means, it perhaps requires a city to have a minimum level of wealth, which puts Mithril Hall into perspective if true? Or they could be branch locations?

The beholder has wandered inside and is floating away to another level. Through the open door, Oswen sees a giant statue of a dwarf, 40-50ft high, huge gems for eyes and a metallic sheen that looks very like platinum. Too much money by half!

"I don't think this place is for us!" says Oswen, "But it was interesting to see." We turn to look out from this vantage point, wondering if maybe we can spot the tower from here. Well, we think we can spot the *area*, but it's on the other side of an enormous plaza with a crazy amount of activity going on within it - *that* appears to be 'the market'. The tower is to the side of what Fell called 'The Great Bazaar'. So - we head back down and find an off-ramp that leads us there.

At ground level, it's surprisingly nice despite how crowded it is. There are numerous plantings and even a kind of miniature canal system with flowing water. It feels like mid-morning here, but we realise it's felt that way more or less the whole time - at least, once we got out of the smog!

We manage to not get distracted by shopping this time. We think we have what we need and don't know what things might exist in the world that we don't own but might want! "We don't know what we don't know". We find the tower, which is relatively humble and slender, with the top 30ft looking like it's mostly just stairs up to a top observation room. The living areas seem to be in the lower floors only. The first three aren't circular, built are built in with the buildings either side on the street. There's no sign; a private residence feel; a door, two high windows either side.

Infina strides up confidently and knocks. There's no response. Her ears are up. She listens. Knocks again. "What? It is. Is it? Oh. It's *our* door!" - from inside, then footsteps and latches and a chain... The door creaks open. A ~5ft tall round-faced woman, well dressed with pinned-back curly hair, stands there. "Can I help you?"

We ask if it's possible to see "Mr Morden Kainen" and explain about the letter, showing it to her. After reading it, she looks surprised then beckons us inside.

A hallway, pictures either side, rooms either side, stairs; we're directed to a waiting room on the right that she calls 'the library'...

...and what a library! As soon as she sits, books catch her eye; a few she's only heard spoken about in almost mythical terms. One is what looks like a First Edition of Iggwilv's Demonomicon! What is *that* here?! The more she looks, the more she realises is rare and precious. She can't help but get up and wander around for a closer look (the rest watching her - Oswen doing Oswen stuff).

She jumps a bit at a voice - "Go ahead! Take one out if you wish!"

She turns to see a ~5ft 10 human man, bald, but with a "Ming The Merciless" goatee and lightly tanned skin. He wears a light green and emerald robe, tied together with a sash. "So, you got my message!" he says. He walks over, reaches up above Oswen and points at a book, as if asking which she wanted.

Oswen shakes her head, "No, thank you - I'm not given to fan worship, sir, but quite an honour to meet you! Well, my name is Oswen Hafflethwaite and these are my friends..." (She introduces the party). "I was wondering if you could perhaps explain a bit more?"

Morden says that he divined us, so that's how we were identified. *He* wants to know more about *us*. Tea comes out and this time we tell the longer version of the story, from the ball and Far Realm up to more or less "now". There is a back-and-forth; he even takes notes in a small notebook. He knows of Lazy Zorhanna, too. It was our induction into the Golden Vault that was how he started to become aware of us. As for his note, he acknowledges us that he might be "prone to theatrics" but stands by his letter. He thinks "we are well past the point of no return", but claims there is a way forward even so. There is hope.

He asks if we want to do a mission - off the books. For sure, yes!

He invites us upstairs now, his study. As we ascend, we can't help but notice how very decorated the whole building is. Quite a remarkable place! The study itself has a mirror that is almost certainly magical, a crystal ball on a pedestal and numerous other items of note that would be quite remarkable, except for us having seen the study at Paliset Hall. Some kind of Silence / anti-scry spell is cast. We have privacy.

"A great power has been rising unbeknownst to most of us, who really should have been more aware of it. It's an old foe, one who I have defeated before although he was less powerful then than he is now. In the intervening years it seems he has attained equal power and status as a god, through forbidden means! Not content with just being an arch-lich, he seeks something more. **His name is Vecna**. Not generally a threat to the world where I come from, or you, but his threat has now expanded beyond his home world of Oerth..." - at this Oswen jumps and says, "Oh, I thought was a low-magic plane!" - "...it generally is! I think that is why he was able to rise to such power unnoticed. He is a planar traveller himself. He has died many times and is now not only undead but godly. We were not aware of this threat until very recently. **My divination spells suggest that Toril and Oerth are sadly - they're un-saveable at this stage.**"

(From this point on, Oswen isn't fully listening - her head is spinning)

"Knowing the history of how things are, I fear the Lady Of Pain will close off all the portals to Toril some time soon, just as she has already closed off the portals to Oerth. We only became aware of this when reports started surfacing of those portals not working. Now, recently a friend of mine gave me a very precious book. She's the one who connected me with a component, an artefact that helped me do this divination that led me to you. You know this old friend of mine, but perhaps under a different name - she's **Tashsa**."

Oswen is jolted out of her reverie - "So that's why you have her book?"

"A signed copy in fact! Now, Tasha and Alustriel have concluded that the only way of saving Oerth and Toril and the other planes to follow, which will collapse under his influence, is to obtain the parts of an ancient artefact. And this I have done - I have obtained a piece of it. But my fear is that if this accelerates, then... Well. I also have doubts about the Incantarium appearing! I wonder if it's just connected, but maybe I'm just paranoid! Do you - ummm. I trust you. You seem capable but you also seem... Iconoclastic?! You seem... Like a spark of the unexpected. Something which Vecna has not planned for. I am a known quantity. So is Tasha so is Alustriel. In a way, so is all of Sigil! Look - I hope you don't feel pressured but I have a very, very important task for you."

Oswen says, "You said, 'way of saving Oerth and Toril'"

"I believe it is possible"

"The portals to Oerth are already closed. Is it not already lost?"

"No. It is not. This artefact... If it can be achieved... There are people already on-task for it. But they are ways away yet from achieving their goal. There are several different agents. Many dominoes falling. We have contingencies upon contingencies. But as our options start to narrow, I... I want to nudge fate along a little bit. Incantarium's presence here worries me." He pulls out a silk bundle from a drawer. He unwraps it. Inside, is a beautiful crystal rod, jagged at each end as if broken from something larger. "This is part of the Rod of Seven Parts. It is one of the middle pieces. I'm not sure yet which piece. It is a powerful artefact in and of itself, but nothing compared to what it could be when all of its pieces are brought together. I don't need you to do that! That is a much bigger plan that is already under way. At least... I *believe* I don't need you to do that! But I do need you to protect this - to make it possible for this bigger task to be achieved. So that it's done. Completed."

"How?"

"I think the Incantarium knows that this rod is in the city. They must not be allowed to find it. They must not be allowed to absorb its magic or we are all lost. Our version of reality - the one that we want - will be gone forever when Vecna achieves his goal. **The only way to stop that happening is for you to get this safely to another vault.** There is another secret, safe location of the Golden Vault. I can't do it - I'm being watched. There is no way to the Ethereal from Sigil so I can't do that either. A friend of mine, **Inda Malayuri** is someone I trust very much . She is beyond reproach - a Deva - a being of pure goodness and light. She has a Spelljammer."
 
"A what?!"
 
"A ship that can traverse planes. She knows how to slip undetected through the Astral Plane to the edge of the Deep Ethereal - to the Golden Vault's location of **The Radiant Citadel** where it should be safe from the Incantarium. Either way it gives us a chance to get that piece to the people who have the other pieces, or will have. Either way it cannot stay here in Sigil. If I am right, and the planes start falling, it may reach a tipping point where the Lady Of Pain does something she has not done for a very long time. She will close *all* the doors. That would make it impossible for the rod to be completed. Inda Malayuri and her crew are on the **Lambent Zenith**, at a Skydock in the Outlands, near the city of **Trade Gate**.

Oswen looks at Bel, in particular, and thinks of herself too. Of course she zoned out earlier - her world will be destroyed with everyone on it, including Leonidas and all the others she cares about so deeply. But what of the Fey, of Bel's people? "If Toril falls, what happens to intersecting planes, like the Fey Wild?"

"I don't know. But my understanding is that most of the power and the populations lie in the Material Plane. My prediction is that Vecna will go after them first. The intersecting planes, like the Shadow Fell or the Fey Wild, have their own protectors that may hold back the tide for longer than the Material Plane can. But as soon as he has conquered Material Planes, he'll go after the Lower and Upper planes too. The Inner and Outer; the elemental... Then ultimately, the Astral and Ethereal. I think his ultimate goal is to lay siege upon Sigil and lay claim to the nexus of all reality. That's why she'll close it off and ride that out. But we - *I* - don't want to see my world fall. Tasha is distraught, as her world has already been closed off; it might not be lost, but Vecna is certainly there, taking it over. We had agents that were trying to stop it happening, but everyone there is now trapped. They'll have to go underground until we can reach them some other way. It's only a matter of time before the other planes start to crumble. Eberron, Krynn..."

Oswen holds up a hand. "A list of names we don't know doesn't increase the urgency. What we know is urgent enough. I can't speak for the others, for their homes in some ways are perhaps less at risk right now, but they'll know I'll answer."

"Eventually all of them will fall. Only once we stop him, can we try and undo the damage and restore things. I'm - sorry to bearer of such bad news. I really wish your first visit to Sigil could have been one filled with wonder, discovery, gastronomic delight and endless shopping, as mine was!"

Oswen's face is set in an unusual way. It's kind of locked down. Businesslike. Her done of voice is neutral, kind of blunt. In fact, it almost borders on rude!

"How do we most quickly, and with least chance of detection, reach this city of Trade Gate?"

"I know a gate that will take you to the Outlands. Not to Trade Gate directly, but I can get you very close! You'll still need to travel the rest of the way there."

"It sounds like we should leave immediately."

"I like your sense of urgency! The place I can get you to - just be careful! - have your wits about you. Be centred... Don't fall into temptation. And that's not something people usually say about this place or its connected plane; it is the gate town to the **Blessed Fields of Elysium**. I have a doorway that can get you to the town of **Ecstasy**... A town not without its problems. It is a place of polar rising influences; the light and the dark; it is ruled by the Light Caller and the Night Whisperer. You must *stay on task*, it is vitally important, and be on guard *for your mind*!"

He hands us the rod. We don't know it, but it's the second piece. Oswen asks if it's safe in a Bag Of Holding - yes it is; so we put it in there, just in case that helps it stay hidden. Morden tells us it's hard to divine anyway; another piece of rod is required to do so. But it's wise to take precautious. This second piece is very powerful, too - "it is able to create gates. To short-circuit space and time. It can make something that is 500ft away from you appear but 10ft or closer from you and allows anything to traverse that jump. It has been used to breach city walls and allow armies to pour forth past fortifications."

**(The second rod segment casts Arcane Gate).**

He tells us where to find the door we need. Oswen says, "Fell told us that every door requires a key." "That is right... The key to *this* door is to bring an item that has two opposing, different sides. A coin is not enough!"

Oswen facepalms. The marionette of sun/moon is on a shelf within our cottage at Ordulin.

"Well you can make one!"

Great. Arts and crafts... "Well, we can, and we'll check the market - it seems quite big!"

The gate is the entrance to an alleyway that so happens to be positioned exactly in the right place so no light ever enters past the entrance. If lit on one side it's always dark on the other. It's in Clerk's Ward. He gives us directions. "I would like to give you something else" he says. "You are a wizard, are you not?" "Well, yes, I try!" "I have set of spells that *I* created!" - he pulls out a scroll case and rolls up three scrolls. He gets suddenly quite enthusiastic. "He puts them in refined these myself - I discovered them - they can be very useful at times! They've served me well over the years. Hopefully they'll serve you well too! I would sign them but if you use them it'll be gone."

Oswen thanks him, says, "We'd better be going I suppose" and people start to get to their feet, her mask drops for a moment, and she's suddenly looking very short, very small, in a big world, and very scared. And she asks, "You're sure there's a chance for Toril?"

"Yes. I am certain. We can undo this corruption that he has spread through the planes. He *must* be stopped. His point of view cannot be allowed to overtake everything."

"We'll get to the ship and we'll get the ship underway. After that I suppose it's out of our hands."

"Yes. Give it to Inda. She and her crew will get it safely to the Radiant Citadel. If you can make it back here, I would love to see you."

(So we don't go with them)

We head downstairs and out. Outside Oswen just looks at the group and they know what she's thinking (Leonidas, and everyone else). And she clears her throat and says, "Well, that's a *LOT*. Let's see what we can find in the market for use as a gate key."

We head into the crowds.



### 4000XP each for this and all other things since the gala
### Market Ward, City of Sigil

Oswen wanders up to a random stall and just starts fiddling with objects on the table and not really communicating. Kindle notices; he walks up behind and looks down expecting her to speak. His ears are flopped down.

Oswen clears her throat and says "well, I suppose it just hit me. Kaden and Verano. Our friends. And others. They all went back to Oerth."

"Yes. Oh! But maybe they're not there anymore."

"Well, it doesn't sound like what this Vecna is doing really leaves much room for escape."

"Perhaps they didn't get there?"

"Well, we don't know. But it seems bad. And - well, you're not from Toril, but I'm from Toril. And Leonidas is there."

"You don't really know that!"

"Well, technically true. But Leonidas is there. And all our friends in Ordulin."

"Morden Kainen sounds crazy anyway. But shall we go and get them? Do you want to deliver this piece first?"

"I don't know if we should go and warn anyone or if that would help. It's just a lot to take in. And he did seem a bit... Eccentric. And I have to try and be optimistic but the way he talked Oerth, like it was already gone and closed off. Why - why is nobody, apparently aware? If entire worlds were being killed of and dying you think it'd be the talk of the town!"

"Were they being killed off, though?"

"That's what Morden said. But to answer your question - well, this thing we have, this rod - it seems almost beyond vital. We *must* make a key; we *must* get this delivered. And I suppose every second counts! Can you see any stalls? Anything that we might use to make something like the marionette, something - contrasted; two sides. I'm too short. It's really busy here."

(The others listen on quietly)

We trade ideas. Then Oswen has a lightbulb moment. If we can find a newspaper, or even perhaps a fiction where two people have opposing views - like those politicians Selgaunt, in fact - because as the saying goes, "there are two sides to every story".

So let's look for a stall that's more about books, stories, pamphlets - even politics, of which Sigil seems to have more than its fair share!

Meanwhile Inafina finds (perception 16) a stall with fans, one of which have day and night on each side. We buy that, because it seems like a good bet, but don't stop there. Inafina says, "Wait, do we need one, or one *each?*" - and we realise we don't know! OK, so we might need *four* things. It didn't sound like it from Morden, but then again, better safe than sorry. Orvil works on Oswen's theory and looks for stalls that might be political or stories. Flat perception 19. He flies up and sees the middle of the great bazaar. Someone is handing out flyers. OK, he reports back; we head to the middle to see what that's about, keeping our eye out as we go.

It's for "The great debate". "What's the debate about?" we ask. It's a classic debate! Two factions of Sigil. Perfect! We have two sides, opposing in debate. One is the Athar, who we remember claim the gods are all false. The other side, The Mind's Eye, who are seekers who see experience and exploration as the path to divine godhood. *Everyone* can be a god.

Another group come around as we're checking this out, trying to quell the crowd around who are already starting to argue about the fact there's even going to be a debate! The very idea of a debate has made people argue about whether it's even worth debating. "How strange", thinks Oswen. We're all bombarded by many voices at once; our highest Perception roll from all four is only 13. But Orville saves the day - from up above, 19+2 -> 21 perception. The Harmonium are there; they have large badges; in a scuffle, one falls to the ground. And he spots as it tumbles it has two sides - one side is a shield with a sword going down the middle; the other is a sun shape with a dove. War and peace. He conveys that to Oswen.

But how do we get the badge?! Inafina refuses. It's illegal! But Bel whispers, "I need a distraction!" and despite Inafina's whispered protests, Oswen gets Orville to fly around the guards and distract them. Bel ducks down between them and (stealth nat 20) palms the badge. We quickly slip away.

Oswen apologises to Inafina, but says, "It's for the good of everything! And if we get back to Sigil I promise we'll take this back to the Harmonium and hand it in."

Kindle wanders off, saying he has an idea. When he comes back, he's holding a stick with a strange folded paper fan on the top, which spins when he blows on it. "Different colours on each side!" - it's purple and yellow. "Well, might work!" says Oswen, rather charitably, "but I don't know if purple and yellow are opposite, exactly. How about, something like - lead and feathers? Art or something about heavy and light?" Kindle goes - "Ooh, or - THAT!" - he goes to a stall and comes back with a lollipop. It's sweet on one side and sour on the other. "Hey, that should do it!" says Oswen. "But you can't eat it until we're through! So buy another one if you want."

"Right then... Now we need to find the door. We have instructions..." We could use Alden of Tea Street Transport, maybe. We ask about the location and find out it's actually near Morden Kainen's house. Oh! Very close! It's in a little alley. Oswen goes hunting. Survival 14! It takes a while.

It's quite unassuming - we were told it was an old cellar door, covered in flowering vines, but to actually *see* that is strange. Oswen expected something more - maybe unusually big, or radiating arcane energy or something. But then again, Baldur's Gate was just a gate unless you "knew". Inafina points to a carving on the capstone of the cellar. It looks like the head of an owl, with huge eyes.

Initially, we try waving our objects at the door! No response.

Oswen studies it magically, arcana 21, but there are no clues. The trick to the door isn't magical.

"What about these vines? We need to clear them to open the door, I think?" asks Bel.

Oswen checks. Nature 19+5->24. It's something she's seen all over here, but not on Toril. Someone said it was "Razor Vine". It's very sharp and needs a lot of care.

Oswen tries freezing it; Ray Of Frost hits easily (18+11->29) and does 11 damage. It freezes; she tries then to crack it with her staff. It falls in brittle sharp shards. A few more of those later and the door is clear. So now, just try the handle. As Oswen reaches for it, Inafina says, "Wait!" and puts her ear up against the door. ADV perception, high roll total 24. "Did you hear that?" she says. "Voices!" She hears lots of small voices, quiet, but all saying the same thing in unison. They're discussing that the door is very cold (!) and they don't know why; and *then* she realises she's hearing it *in her head*. She asks the rest of us.

Oswen perception 17; yes; Kindle 16; same. Bel 13, makes the DC. We all hear it.

Oswen knocks gently. We hear panic and loud noise! She then says and "thinks loudly", "We mean no harm, we were hoping to pass through this door to get to the city of Ecstasy. May we pass?"

"The cellar is abandoned. There's nobody in here! There is no Ecstasy in here."

"Who are you? My name is Oswen."

"We are Entity. We live in the cellar. We are the cellar Entity. We are one. We are many!"

"Do you know how to access the Sigil gateway to get to Ecstasy?"

"What? No. There's nothing here. It is only a cellar. It is our home!" - then there's whispering, indistinct.

"May we visit your home?"

Silence.

"We have... Gifts? Things of opposites" says Oswen.

Little voices. "Food? Bring us food! Offerings of food!"

Easily done. "We have dried fruit, nuts, jerky, and some bread? How do we get it to you?"

"Bring it in, or leave it at the door" (different overlapping thoughts).

"OK, coming in then!" says Oswen. She nods to everyone to hold their "opposite" object - just in case - then with Inafina's help, we lift open the door. Light floods into the space below. Scurrying sounds, "Bright! Bright!", things moving down stairs. A dozen pairs of shiny eyes, all over the ground. Oswen lays out a ration's worth, since these creature seem small. They get closer and we see them in the light. They're kind of rats, but they've got translucent heads with huge brains. The brains even glow a bit.

There's a big gathering down there. As one gets close, separating from the group a bit, the glow in its head diminishes. It picks up a chunk of cheese and nibbles at it. Then we hear the others thinking, "Come back to the many!" - and the movements of the close one are different suddenly, much more rat-like. Only as it returns to the others does it get more "intelligent" / unified, brain glowing again.

Oswen says, "Ah, I see. You have to keep close together to stay connected. May I came down and look around?"

"Yes!"

She starts down the stairs. She's got the pamphlet. As she walks through the door - it activates! There's a sort of swirling tunnel instead of a stairway all of sudden. The rats gasp. "There's magic!" Then they scatter, in panic. Inafina's thinking to them, "Don't worry, we thought this would happen, it's fine! We're headed away, we hope you like the food!"

Oswen continues walking. The others quickly give chase behind, Kindle last, having the presence of mind to close the cellar doors behind. He says, "I guess we didn't all these things?" and puts down the lollipop on the just-visible top step, for the rats. Meanwhile, Oswen can see the bottom part of Kindle sticking out from the portal; we're all through on the other side. Then he comes down and we're all...

...where?

### The town of Ecstasy

There are various strange-looking creatures who are looking at us in surprise. From their perspective, we've emerged from nowhere. We're stood next to a well, with a stone arch above it, a cornerstone showing a picture of a hawk. "Hawk" says Inafina - "Maybe that's a daytime hunter, and the Owl hunts at night."

Nearby, 3ft tall mice with huge ears, very well dressed - dashing - regard us in surprise. One has plate mail, polished, with a hat under his arm. Others have court garb. There are four. (We later learn - **Guardinals**). Bel says, "Sorry for the intrusion!"

There's a bear, too; some half-something folk - e.g. half human, half pearly-skinned almost sphinx-like face, four arms. It's quite surprising. One by one, they lose interest and walk off, but the Guardinals approach. "What are you doing here? Where did you come from? How did you get that gate to work?"

Bel says, "Trying to find our way to Trade Gate; from Sigil; we used a key."

The courtly one wants to know what the key is. They'll only tell us the way to Trade Gate if we tell them the secret. Oswen says, "Believe it or not, you just need to have this on you!" - and hands him the pamphlet.

"Are you giving this to me? Do I have to find my own?"

"No, you can have that"

"Mighty good of you!" - he folds it and hands it to a "squire" to his right, in a floppy hat. "I am a mouse of my word. We shall take you to Trade Gate! Come!"

So we get an escort! Better than we hoped. They march off and we march off with them!

"First we must face Spireword!" says the noble. In the distance he points and there's an unfathomably tall spire of rock. We look around; this area is reasonbly brightly lit; to the right it's quite dark, as if shrouded in twilight though - maybe some 20mins walk away. Our area is more like dawn. "Then we must turn left!" so he pivots 90 degrees left; "That way!"

"My name is **Jerrem**. This is might knight, **Darrem**, my Lady, **Mirrem** and my understudy, **Koln**." They are Mustevals.

"I'm Oswen and" - she introduces the others/.

"I am on my path to being one of the greatest actors of the stage!"

This catches Bel's attention. Competition!

Oswen asks, "How did you get into acting?"

"Well I was not always from this town; I made my name here. I grew up out in a mine village, out in the Outlands. But here" - he gestures around - "the whole city is my stage!". We see there are strange plints rising out of the ground made of various materials - marble, crystal, basalt, iron and more - 70-100ft tall, beautiful. Dwellings are scattered below them. The largest one that we can see rises a *few hundred* feet up, shaped like a tower, beautiful ornamentations that look almost grown, rising to the top. Jarrem points to the twilight side and we see a counterpart there. The twilight "aura" seems to be centred on it.

"Are there stages up on the plinths?" asks Oswen.

"Yes! But you must be careful. Although Ecstasy is a town built upon pure good, to keep things balanced, there can be bad - I was nearly pushed off a plinth once!"

He explains more about gate towns, when we say we've never been to one. This town is a monument to everything good, *but* everyone keeps a lookout - if things get too placid and good, the city is at risk of being sucked into Elysium itself! To remain anchored here, there must be some balancing forces. At certain times of the year, random acts of "low-level evil" (!) are engaged upon. Pushing someone off a stage, or booing loudly, or lying. The last two don't see so bad as the first in terms of consequences!

There's more conversation. Then they offer to share bounty (!) - Koln pulls out a box from a bag, and it's full of cupcakes! Kindle is especially happy. We're very grateful but say we're sorry, we don't have much to give them back. "Do you know any good songs?" asks Jerrem. Ah! Bel's time to shine!

Accompanied by song, we make it to the edge of the city. Leaving the stone plinths behind, there's a *literal* edge, with a sort of grand ballroom stairway down to a surrounding plane. Directly in front of us is a colourful forest of gigantic mushrooms. "It's just like the Fey!" says Oswen. Further in the distance there's something that _would_ be a mountain range except all the mountains are the same height and the tops are flat. We ask but the four Guardinals don't know; they suppose that this way, "everyone is equal". There's a wide river glittering even further away.

Now and again, Jerrem turns Spireward, then sticks out his arm to the side and points in its direction - "We go that way!" - it seems a very simple method of navigation, but apparently an effective one.

**"There are only two things you need to know. Where on the axis of Spireward to Rimward you are; then from that point, are you going around the wheel or against the wheel."**

Having faced Spireward, we turn to the right. "Against the wheel", explains Jerrem - so that's anticlockwise. "If you went with the wheel, you'd end up in Faunel" - which is, he says, a kind of wild beast-people town! That sounds frightening until he explains that most of the Gardinel people come from there. It's a gateway to a beastlands plane beyond.

We're headed close to the mushroom forest. The sky around us starts to darken a little, a bit like the way that the one of the two towers' darkness behind us at Ecstasy is expanding out. Kolm explains this is normal - effectively, this is how night-time happens here. It spreads from that tower. The darkness is relatively crowded with twinkling, dancing lights, which Oswen realises are a facsimile of stars; they'll spread out with the darkness to about the right density soon. There is a low mist that forms and hinders visibility. Off in the mushroom forest there is a soft, diffuse glowing light, blue and green, much more visible now; some distant caverns glow, too.

D20->5. There are shapes flying through the sky. They cast even darker silhouettes against the sparkling false stars. They make no noises other than whooshing noises, like wings on the wind. We ask the Guardinals, but they can't really seem to see them - big ears, small eyes; so we go quiet, and they can listen. "Oh, it must be an Avariel! One of the owl ones..." - they look nervous. "We should seek shelter!" - and Koln is already scoping out areas to hide. "Come with me!" - we follow, but Oswen explains that we also have a magical shelter than can keep them safe if they need it. "But can we move with the shelter, or not?" "You'd need to stay in the shelter." "Then we won't get to where we need to go!"

The four scamper along, followed by our party. Then Koln, in the lead, disappears into a small hole in the ground! There's some scrub that hides an entrance; it's a bit of a cavern. The others follow quickly - Jerrem next. Kindle only just fits - he goes last, feeling a bit nervous. Fortunately the small passage doesn't last long before opening up into a series of caverns - which are almost like Swiss cheese! They travel along, occasionally finding a lookout up to the surface to check on the Avariels. They're nervous the whole time.

Kolm asks Inafina to come with him. The two run ahead and reach a kind of edge, not a sheer cliff but very steep. There's a big hole in the side where the tunnel exits. Koln listens carefully - Inafina too, perception 23. The flapping noises have gone. The area in front is clear, but there's a 20ft drop that's a bit steep. After that, the ground fans out to a different kind of terrain. Inafina realises that the mushrooms of the forest, now much closer, actually have very tall stalks - they're not short at all. We just have to get under the cover of them.

We use the rope of climbing to help us clamber down. Kindle follows last, with a remarkable ability - in this low light - to actually *fly*. He coils up the rope first, steps out and unusual shadow/twilight clouds appear under his feet and he sort of just walks down with them. Each step forward causes another cloud to form where he wants his foot to land; behind him, the clouds dissipate in grey puffs of smoke. The rest of us aren't sure if we've seen him do that before, but he says he's been able to do it for quite some time. The right occasion just never arose before! Bel smells cinnamon buns - that's the clouds! "What a nice way to fly", remarks Bel - though Kindle acknowledges that it's not too stealthy.

With all 8 of us on the ground, we make a run for it to get to the mushrooms. These really are mushroom *trees*, with big trunks some 2-3ft across, fibrous and even woody in parts, with bright yellow speckles of moss. Around 15ft to some as high as 25ft above, there's a glow from the underside of the caps of the mushrooms. The glow illuminates a suspended dust of spores forming a kind of haze around, blowing with the wind, but staying up high for now. This makes the Guardinals happier, because any winged creature approaching would disturb the spores and be easily seen. The spores cast strange shadows, like clouds on a sunny day, but small and round, all in the strange, dim, multicoloured light. The ground itself is soft and spongy, mostly moss; lethargic lizards are scattered around, usually on mushroom trunks, blinking at us as we pass.

Oswen turns to Bel, "Reminds me of bits of home!" "It does, yes! Except - well, I've ever seen lizards like these. They're quite large."

Here and there are fairly giant bugs - millipedes and other insects, scuttling about. They're not person-sized, but some are at least a foot long. Again, they just seem to be going about their business, not threatening. We press on.

At Mirrem's behest, Jerrem is encouraged to share songs. Bel's already sung a few earlier, so now it's his Jerrem's turn. They sing a little duet. We all try to remember it as best we can, as we're sure the Campsetri back at our fey "keep" would love to learn it too. (A slight nagging pull at the back of Oswen's mind - "...if this Vecna character hasn't got to them already...") - it's a bit 1990s cheese ballad, but fun to hear.

D20->18. We reach a babbling brook. The Guardinals suggest that we stop to enjoy the water, maybe have some food, and relax for a while. "Maybe we set up camp here?" - so it seems we *do* sleep - we weren't sure if they did! - and it was just a question of wanting to press on as far as they could. Kindle sets up the magic hut, with enough room just for all 8 of us, especially given 5 are small! Then we set up camp proper and Kindle gets to work making food. Bel makes tea.

Inafina and Koln climb the tallest mushroom they can find. There's no need to hold breath through the spore cloud - he has a bandana he offers her; they wrap one each around their mouths and noses. Inafina uses Wind Walk to help the climb. At the top, they climb onto the cap. It's a good choice of mushroom - there's a great view, with hardly any taller ones around. Flat perception 16. Koln keeps asking what she sees - he really can't see far! - so she explains that we're up high but definitely can't see *too* far in this dim light. We do seem to be past half way through. The brook we're at leads out of the forest; a slight gap, like a 'crack', in the canopy shows its path. She points and Koln says that's where we want to go; if we had a way of making a raft, we could float instead of walk. The brook exits to a lake. Not far from it, on the far side, is some kind of huge construction site where a very, very tall building is being made. Koln, when told about it, says it's an observation tower under construction. "They say they're going to put huge crystal balls and lenses in the top! Some giants from Isgard are building it. They have these strange contraptions that can lift things up really high. They look a bit like the lake birds - cranes - but they're made of metal and wood. Look rimward?"

Inafina looks rimward, towards silvery mist at that part of the lake. "Can you see a town?" - this time, perception dirty 20. She can see lights through the mist. Koln says he can see sort of a glow! That's our destination. "That's Trade Gate". She makes out what seems to be a huge sprawling market, but there are taller buildings and lots of different coloured lights. From here, it actually looks quite beautiful. The most striking thing - dark, so harder to make out until she spots the occasional blinking light on edges - is some kind of rising platform or tower; it's very big, but she can't make out much more.

We get back down and confer with the others. Oswen has tried to find some things to eat in the forest but it's unfamiliar territory (survival 14) so we mostly rely on rations. At least there's hot water to rehydrate things and the Guardinals share, so we manage to make quite a good combination in the end.

After dinner, Jerrem offers a performance of his latest play. That sounds great! They hang a cloth from a backpack that forms a sort of "back of stage", then get into costume and everything. The understudy plays music. Jerrem steps on "stage" in a black wig, with black moustache, with priestly robes. He starts a monologue about difficulties in the world; the destitute; the homeless; but spoken as if rather *imagined* by someone with a more noble upbringing! The sentiment, nonetheless, is honourable. We learn that this is a story of a kind of Guardinal saint, who set up an orphanage. Later, Jerrem dives behind the curtain, hurriedly changes and emerges to play a different part, joined by Mirrem. This time they're villagers, too poor to look after their new child... And so it goes on. An orphan joins the army, rises through the ranks, becomes a great general, goes back to visit the then-old priest running the orphanage in his last days. They have a heart-to-heart, but that bit is a little odd as Jerrem has to play both roles.

"The smallest thing that you think doesn't think matters - from the smallest person - can make the biggest changes in the fate of the kingdom!"

They step out altogether on stage and we applaud enthusiastically. Kindle is particularly excited by the last line, as he calls out, "Yes, that's Oswen!" - which does embarrass Oswen a bit, she's not saving kingdoms alone! - but then people start to yawn. It's time for bed. We pack up outside and set up the bed rolls inside the hut. They've actually set up individual small tents inside!

We all get to sleep. Oswen sets up an Alarm around the perimeter; this place otherwise seems safe, and it means we don't have to do watch.

Bel keeps her company as she sets it up. He asks how she feels. He's checking in.

She stops for a minute and says, "Oh, I'd been keeping busy, I suppose?" "Yes..." "But" - she gestures - "this is quite wonderful here, and everything is new; we just have to get this job done and trust in others." "Do you still have it?!" "Of course!" "I'm a bit worried about it... It seems very powerful."

We talk a little more. Oswen says she'd like to stay involved in all of this. Bel agrees. He mentions that we do still have our "unread" new mission, for "when we're ready". Oswen suggests that we should 'open the letter' at Trade Gate. If it requires us to travel - like, *really* travel - we'd be in the perfect place to do so. But if the mission is nothing to do with any of this Vecna stuff, Oswen isn't sure how she'd feel. "Obligated to complete it all the same, I suppose" she says. Either way, we're not finished yet.

She realises Bel is being protective. "Thank you. We do need to look out for each other - I worry for the Fey, too, because it's so close to Toril. All of us are worried. I hope you're OK as well, and if you aren't, please don't keep it from me because you think I've enough to worry about already - I'd always rather know what's going on, and help if I can."

"Well, for now at least, I am fine. I'm made of strong stuff! But I'm really only OK because we're together. If I was by myself, I think I'd be feeling a bit frightened and hopeless by now" - and he gives her hand a squeeze. She hugs hide side and we head back inside the hut, the Alarm spell complete.

We all get to bed, without feeling the need for watch.

## Outlands, campaign day 14 / Sigil day 3

In the morning, we wake to find the four Guardials already up. We gather some water and wonder how we might float downstream. Inafina and Kindle try to work together to find fallen mushroom heads, but (ADV perception 12) they can't find any. It seems like most of the mushrooms just rot when they fall and the ground is mostly mats of moss, which won't float.

We spend a while debating options, when Kindle chips in and says, "Well, why don't we just walk?" - at first we all think he means we give up on the brook and try to chart a path through the forest, but then he says that, given a bit of time, he can get us walking on water! We all have to keep close by, but after ten minutes, he says that it's ready. We look down and see small, sweet-smelling white clouds, thinner and closer to the feet than his "fly" clouds last night; almost like steam from a mug of hot chocolate.

"Let me just test this out first!" - he nervously steps onto the water. And it's that easy! He seems surprised. "Look! It works!" - so we all eagerly run out, quite excited. For a while we lose ourselves chasing in circles and laughing at the absurdity of it. Then Bel asks, "How long does this last...?" - Kindle thinks about an hour, but he can keep re-casting it, with 10 minute delays. It still seems a better option to at least get to the lake than trying to navigate blind through the forest, so we stop messing around and make haste down the brook, treating it like a path.

After a while, Kindle advises us to get to the bank so he can re-cast. Oswen sends up Orvil while the Guardinals produce biscuits. They seem to have no end of food from a food-producing bag of holding of sorts. Oswen sees through Orvil's eyes - as he doesn't have to fly out of range to clear the mushroom trees - that we're probably only an hour further away as the "water route" is very direct. We can certainly reach the lake, but might want to walk around the edge rather than across it. She also has Orvil at the huge construction. It is enormous, perhaps some 200ft tall, covered in scaffold. The strange contraptions the Guardinals described are already at work, carrying up great blocks of stone, operated by just four giants in total.

As Orvil flies down, Oswen asks the group - "Would it be OK to go and - I mean, maybe we shouldn't waste the time - but it doesn't seem *too* far to that tower, and I'm really curious about what they hope to see."

Kindle is unsure. The mission is time-sensitive... He's not sure what to say, he doesn't know if the Guardinals should learn of our mission. But they are a bit curious too.

Inafina makes the call. "We've never gone wrong by being inquisitive before, and we might miss something that could help us later otherwise. It doesn't look like it will take us that much out of our way, from what you say; so let's do it."

Kindle's ritual finishes his spell, so, off we go.

About 40 minutes we exit the forest into bright sun-like light with clouds moving rapidly across the "sky"; the spire is clearly visible. The construction site is easy to see. We'd need to cross to the opposite bank to make it there. There's just enough time for us to get to that shore and then we start walking around the edge on that other side. The Guardinals are in awe, but somewhat frightened. Oswen tries to reassure them - "Look at Kindle; he's much bigger than the five of us, but very gentle."

Even Oswen starts to feel a bit intimidated up close, as the huge structure looms larger and larger. It transpires that from a distance it was harder to judge true scale. We get close to some blocks that could hide our approach. Oswen has no idea if the giants are friendly, but skullduggery is not a good way to make friends and besides, we might get stepped on or knocked by the huge construction machines. We elect to walk out in the open, as visibly as we can.

The giants all have blueish-grey skin. Two close to us are lifting a huge block, big enough to need both of them to move it, which is moved over to a crane and hooked up via straps and some kind of platform. One then turns a crank to lift it. We realise it's just like smaller hoists on loading docks, but looks grand because of the sheer scale - especially when the arm swings the block over our heads, casting a shadow on us as it passes. They're calling out in giant. Oswen uses her Awakened Spellbook to ritual-cast Comprehend Languages in just a few seconds; she can do that once a day. The runes lift off the book itself, floating in the air, as it casts.

"Heading your way! Goran! Heads up! Heads up!"

From the top - Goran - "Keep it level! Level! Don't knock anything!"

Oswen says, "We should let them know we're here but not right now - they shouldn't be interrupted, it sounds difficult for them while using that crane."

The swing of the crane is taken a bit too fast (DM dice roll); it starts to swing outwards and knocks the side of the scaffold. Oswen is calling a warning to the party, but she's helpless to act; no useful spells. The block after hitting the scaffold swings and rotates, which causes it to start to slide off the side. The giant up at the top tries to grab it but can't else he'd fall; the scaffold is leaning too! The block then starts to slide off and fall. Bel, in a flash, runs forward, pulls out his Bandore and casts Levitate to stop it falling. It's *just* in range. He stands there, eyes wide, arm outstretched dramatically; he slowly lowers it to the ground.

Kindle shouts out, "Is everyone there OK?"

Goran swings down on the scaffold. A third giant pops their head out asking who is there. "That was - uuuh - absolutely not an accident! Everything is fine! We have everything under control..."

The crane operator lowers the brick with Bel's help while the third, new arrival, thanks us. Kindle gets into it, and eventually negotiates a switch to a simple form of Common. It transpires that they don't mind discussing the purpose of the tower and decide to take a break as the scaffold needs to be repaired and made safe before more of the proper work can be done anywhere.

The tower is clearly complete, after which the "Eye In The Sky" can be placed atop it. We're taken to a hut, while another goes to the Guardinals, scared and hanging back, but one of the giants seems very fond of them and gently offers a hand to carry them. He ends up with one on his shoulder in the end, another in one hand, and two in the other hand.

Inside the hut is a contraption of metal and a great deal of glass. There look to be various possibilities for adjustments in the frame that'll shift various glass lenses and plates. In the middle is series of great glass prisms and mirrors. It's quite elaborate. Oswen is fascinated by it - "This is amazing! What is it for?"

"It isolates different forms of magic and allows us to look into other planes!"

"*Into* other planes?!"

"Once it's calibrated yes! It's not finished yet. We have tested it though in the workshop. We won't really know until we can mount it somewhere high enough to get it above the interference of the terrain on the ground. That's why we need the tower."

"If that works it would be a quite spectacular achievement" says Oswen.

"It works in theory! It's my life's work."

Overdue, we introduce ourselves. The one holding the Guardinals introduces herself as **Tilia** (shortened versions of their real names). **Goran** is a builder. The crane operator is **Nyelia** and the inventor/engineer is **Ormenom**.

Oswen asks if others would be permitted to use it once built, or if it's only for the giants, which would be reasonable given that they did design and build it. But Ormenom is keen for others to use it and ultimately wants to amplify its power to look further and further. It can at least see immediately adjacent planes right now, if it works. He's never tried, but technically, he even ought to be able to look into Sigil!

"If my theory is correct and if we can get the right testing data, I might be able to amplify its power enough to look into distant planes. Maybe one day, even, *any* plane! Who knows! To be able to do so, without needing to travel there..."

Ormenom welcomes us to use it at any time. We thank him; that's very kind of him.

Oswen is very enthusiastic. She does with apologies have to warn about those who might misuse this - scry as a prelude to an attack, say; but all the same, its potential for wonderful things is remarkable.

They explain they're from Isgard. Everything there is for glory; conquest, might, heroic deeds, kingdoms. Epics. There's little room for intellectual musings! That's why they moved to the Outlands.

The break over, we part company. They get onto scaffold repair and Kindle considers the width of the lake... He thinks he we can get across within the hour, so we wait while he casts his ritual and then walk out. Oswen thinks this novelty will never wear off. It's quite bizarre walking on the surface of the lake. As we walk out, we see all kinds of fishes and eels, swimming under our feet, looking at us in curiosity! They seem totally unafraid. We decide to keep our eyes peeled just in case there's anything bigger in the lake that might be hungry...

...soon enough, we're at the other side. Our arrival surprises a lone fisherman, sat on the bank. They have a face that looks a bit like a carp, with really long whiskers. Oswen asks the Guardians if he might come from the same plane as they do, but they think it's probably a lower plane. They have a high sense of self-preservation! They think there's a somewhat demonic aspect (!) to this creature.

Trade Gate is relatively nearby. It only takes another couple of hours of walking. The Guardinals are now preparing to leave us.

"We have taken you about as far as we can go. We, umm, really shouldn't go into Trade Gate."

The rest of us are a bit oblivious (VERY low insight rolls!) but Bel (16) picks up on something... They've done - *soemthing*. He asks! "Why are you avoiding Trade Gate?" "We certainly haven't taken anything we shouldn't have taken!" "So no biscuits or cup cakes or anything, then?" - there's a pensive quiet. Bel winks and says, "Your secret is safe with us."

Oswen thanks them. She fetches the Brigganock / Kored alliance music box. She explains what it is and shows how it work. They seem astounded that it can make magic! They all take off hats and bow. We bow in return.

"It has been a pleasure to cross paths with you and we shall see each other again one day - in the stars or the stage!" - they turn, and scamper off.

Oswen wrinkles her brow. "I'll miss them. They were a lot of fun."



### Trade Gate

Well, then. Trade Gate. From the side we approach there is, in fact, a large and beautiful ornate gate. Across the top there seem to be depictions of many other planes. It's made of forged iron with stained glass - very impressive. Oswen, investigation 19, thinks she recognises things she has at least read about. Outer planes, with Trade Gate shown in the middle. It links directly to what, if memory serves, was called Bytopia.

Beyond, the high platform of the sky dock is very easy to see. Inafina says, "Well, it's busy and it's big. We need to find a map or information or something, or perhaps just get up *there* and ask? If it's anything like a sea port, there should be some kind of administrative office."

So now we need to navigate. Oswen gets Orvil to sit on Kindle's shoulder so she can get a dual view of down at her level (which doesn't see much) but occasionally a high view from him (but it can be disorientating if trying to walk). We head in; market stalls everywhere, lining a main street. Many others are entering. Side roads each seem to lead to a market which looks like a different type; it reminds Oswen of Sigil's Market Ward a bit, possibly even rivalling it for size and diversity? It's certainly more pleasant, since it's in the open air! Further, the diversity of races of people here is almost overwhelming.

There's perhaps some "ghettoizing", with lower planes market stalls in one area, for example. So some groupings are based on type of product, but others are based entirely on demographic. Market Ward seemed a lot more mixed. Devil-like stalls are certainly kept close together and just in one area! Oswen notices that and on the one hand it makes sense, but on the other hand it strangely makes them feel more intimidating and dangerous than at Market Ward, when they were all just mixed in together as if nothing special. The lack of influence from the Lady Of Pain might be a reason - less reason to trust; less reason to peacefully coexist. More of an uneasy tension.

Oswen notes a *lot* of centaurs and bariaurs here, almost over-represented. She doesn't know if that's significant, but very few of them are running stalls. They seem to be more working in an official way - clipboards, or perhaps security; ornate beard trimmings with beads and other decorations. Well, if they're official... We should ask for help finding **Inda Malayuri**, the captain of **Lambent Zenith** - where would we start?

After some general chat, the centaur suggests either some of the well-known watering holes; or even just the sky port itself. But for that, we would need the Captain to actually be at the ship. We realise we don't even know if the ship is here! So instead, there's a suggestion to "talk to a colleague of mine" - and he points to the big building up on the sky dock. Well, we'd figured that out, but it turns out it's quite an elaborate root to get from down here to up there! One building leads to another, up stairs, another and so-on.

Oswen remembers the directions and coupled with Orvil's help, assists Kindle with navigation - he can see most of the crowds. Navigation - ADV Survival 22 - is good. We have to get to a bathhouse off to the side of the market square. The square is quite open, fewer stalls and more buildings, a big public space. Quite a few sell food. That reminds Oswen that we should top up a bit, so we spend a bit of time replenishing our reserves. A fair amount of it is fresh, too, for the near future. It's a relief to get some new food.

Other stalls here sell all kinds of mugs, jugs, pitchers and the like, all in brass; there's some very beautiful cloth; just as Kindle spots the bathhouse Oswen says, "Sorry, just one moment..." and quickly searches some of the nearby brass stalls to see if something that looks like the shape of a wine bottle, but in brass, is found anywhere. There are in fact several. Some have inlaid coloured sections, enamel paint. She picks one she likes that "feels right" for Leonidas. It's only 2gp.

Back with the party she shows it and looks a bit bashful; "I have to believe that there will still be a world left for me to give this to him."

Bel nods. "I'm sure there will! It's a thoughtful gift. It's quite beautiful and we've never seen its kind back in Ordulin before. And look at this!"

He draws us over to one of the open-front shop buildings. "**Ssussura's Silks and Satins**". Bolts and bolts of cloth. "...Ah! There! This caught my eye." We go past numerous silks, woven tapestries and all manner of others - hard to see how Bel saw past it! - but reach a strange, almost shimmering cloth, as if patterns on it are changing. It's quite remarkable. As we look closer, patterns and pictures shift and change; it's beguiling. Oswen nods back, "This is quite unique. If you think you can use it, or just want it as-is, then you should get some."

"We could create some dividing curtains in the Keep. Or! Or..." - he pulls more off and wraps some around Oswen, then more around Inafina - "...imagine this sort of, draped thing, like a robe..." - Kindle rolls his eyes!

"OK. Let's get a decent length, then. Who do ask?" says Oswen. Bel fetches someone. It's a sort of snake person! Good thing *we* aren't mice... "Ah! The glamour weave! Beautiful cloth" they say. "Only made on one world and thankfully I have connections there." "Which world?" "Eberron." "I've read of it, but I've never been." "Not the easiest place to get to, or get goods from. But I have my ways. How much do you want?"

Bel's eyes narrow. The bartering is afoot! "Depends on how much it is!" - Kindle helps by playing the other side of the coin, the 'less enthusiastic buyer' - lots of other choices, probably expensive - etc.; the price is bargained down to 5gp a yard.

Bel decides to take ten yards.

The shopkeeper is delighted! It's more than they expected, evidently. Roll after roll is folded, to measure out the yards. It's quite captivating to watch, as the fabric constantly shifts and evolves. Bel insists on self-funding it. He asks if he can put it in the bag of holding; we stow it carefully.

We get back on track and head for the bathhouse. We aren't sure if we go in or not. Oswen, History 15+5 -> there's a stairway at the top; so we have to get to the top. There's a charge to get in, so Oswen asks the person at the desk taking payment what we do. Turns out we don't come inside. He gives us directions to an external stairway at the back of the building.

There are various steam and perfume aromas coming out of windows. Oswen asks Bel if he's interested in going in there, once we've finished with our current mission? He's been very nice to her lately and she worries his desires might be overlooked as the other three of us are much more rough-and-ready. "Maybe, if we're not in a rush, it would do us good to soak and relax and reflect? But only if there's time!"

He's obviously keen. Oswen will try hard to make time.

Soon enough we're on the roof. There are signs here for "Star Port". Kindle mentions that it's quite odd that this is the route! If you had a lot of cargo, what would you do? Or a large crew?

There are probably several ways up. Perhaps we were just given the route that was closest to us when we asked the centaur.

On it goes. Various walkways, other buildings, then a platform with a sign pointing towards "Sky Harbourmaster's Office". Bingo! We follow the sign.

We enter a building with arched windows - no glass, just open. It's breezy! The sky port seems to be run by teams of Aarakocra, which makes good sense. One sits in an office at the end of the space, behind a desk. So we head over. "Yes? Can I help you?"

Oswen explains that we're looking for a particular ship and captain. We learn that the ship *is* currently docked. We are invited to wait; we can't go to a ship unattended, but we do think that there are probably some minimal maintenance / security crew on board (if it's anything at all like sea ships) who might be able to help us find the Captain. So, we wait. The Harbourmaster calls another Aarakocra who flies in through one of those open 'windows'. "D16, Lambent Zenith" he says. We're invited to go with the new arrival to accompany us to the ship.

We're "ground dwellers" so taken on a rather longer route, apparently, over kind of rickety plank walkways, tied together with rope and with rope handrails. One things lead to another until we see a glorious galleon, painted a very slightly faded sky blue, sails tied but visibly a strange, very reflective gold. Masts look as if they were painted with white accents and gold trim, but there's a lot of blue. Even though there's some fading with age, everything is in impeccable condition.

It doesn't seem possible that it can fly! "They're all spelljamming helms" explains our guide. "Most have been recommissioned as cargo haulers." On Oswen's further enquiries, "It's tied to the helm, really. It takes a lot of magic to take it out of a plane, but once you get beyond a material plane into Wildspace or especially the Astral it gets far easier. In fact travelling in the Astral takes almost no energy at all!"

We are escorted to the deck. Our guide nods to a crew member who seems to know them. We're taken to the Sterncastle and our guide knocks on the door while chatting to us idly. Nothing. "Let's try the Captain's Quarters" - and these it seems are at the prow. We're led there. More knocking. But then, from stern when we just were, someone shouts - "Was that - someone? - the captain's not here!"

Oswen introduces us and asks about the Captain. "The **Pig & Whistle**!" We hear it's not far and well known so if we ask around we should be able to find it easily. "Not far from the bottom of the cargo lifts".

As we head off, the guide continues chatting. We ask if we can get to the cargo building? Sure! Another building, kind of like a warehouse but with a pulley lift. We ask if people are allowed... "Why not; sometimes people *are* cargo" - Kindle frowns at that! - but anyway, we ask if we could go down. We're taken to a lift and wait until someone has other stuff to send down. The guide heads off and we wait. Before long there's a ringing of some kind of bell; someone calls "Clear - unless you're going down, step off the lift!" - so we stay *on* it. It seems this thing might move on a schedule, or perhaps someone below called to request it for loading from below.

We end up, after a long descent, in another warehouse. We wander outside - it's very busy. Oswen does her usual trick of helping Orvil compensate for her lack of stature; flag investigation, 17+8 -> a very high 25. Soon enough she finds it - the sign even has a suckling pig with a whistle sticking out of its mouth. Weird! "That way!" she says, pointing.

We cross through a market and reach the building. It's a wide, heavy door with good smells coming from partly open windows. It's humid inside and strong-smelling. We approach the bar, but as we do - Inafina perception 17. She sees a table that has someone who looks like a Deva, and the only one (even though she's only going on a related description). A hair, brown, bowl cut; wings, one of which seems mechanical, the other of beautiful white feathers. Well dressed. A leather tunic with white designs painted, short sleeves, shoulder cap, bracers and gloves; she's sat with a few others, including a tiefling and an orc with hair in pigtails, tied back. Quite a juxtaposition! Two others have their backs turned.

Inafina points the way and head over, somewhat nervously. The two people with backs turned suddenly stiffen up and turn. They look similar; dressed in oilskin sailors outfits (curious, they sail in the sky!) with green skin and brown freckles. Noses look almost melted! Thin, somewhat gaunt faces with tight-pulled skin and large almond shaped eyes; no hair, except for a strange Manchurian style tied high and plaited with large brass rings at intervals along. They're armed.

Oswen is a bit flustered - "Sorry, um, we mean no harm?!"

The deva finishes drawing on her drink and announces, "What's going on? What do you want?"

Oswen hastily introduces us. "We come bearing an object of... Some value... From a certain Mr Kainen?"

We're ordered to speak plainly by the two that we figure are kind of guards. Oswen explains plainly. They say, "Fine, give it to us then" (the rod) - but we're not about to hand over something to someone without proof of who they are! This goes down badly; these two guards get prickly.

Inafina, dirty 20; there was no reaction or recognition to the name Kainen at all. She tries to smooth things over - but Kindle notices, while she talks, that *every other table in the tavern has stopped talking*. He clears his throat and says, "And we do seem to have attracted rather more attention than we intended, for one reason or another. We *are* very new here... Have we done something wrong?"

Nobody replies. Kindle's high passive interest shows that we, as a group, are people of interest; that is to say, we've attracted the attention of everyone in the room because of what we've said. Well that's the opposite of what we wanted.

Bel, insight 17; realises that we never got to really ask if the Captain was who they said they were. But we never got that. And while we've spent all this time trying to find these people, they don't know us and more importantly, they don't even know who Morden Kainen is.

Oswen history 18; she never really encountered people as different as this before, with such a different attitude. She has no way to understand this culture given the impasse we're already at. We thought we were approaching politely, but clearly that was totally wrong for this group. Flat INT check, 17, enough to give her the idea of bypassing the people we're annoyed so much. She tries Message.

"I'm very sorry. We approached this all wrong. We need to find Inda Malayuri. We need her help."

It's a more contrite approach - she hopes it'll work.

There is a quick reply. "*I* am Inda Malayuri. What do you need my help for and who is Mr Kainen?" - but as she's "thinking" that, Inda speaks to the bodyguards - "My brave Githyanki knights; stay your vocal swords! Today is not the day that a fight is needed. They are not a threat to us."

Oswen says, "Thank you. I wonder if we would be permitted a private audience. We would happily pass our weapons and spell-casting focuses to your guards if need be."

She stands; part of her arm and her shoulder are prosthetic to. "There is no need. We can go to my quarters if you wish to speak."

"We would be very grateful!"

And then, surprisingly, a Message to Oswen; this conveys in concepts, not words, "Don't try anything! We are going to my ship, where I have dominion."

There is no strong trust here, but she's confident we can't harm her.

In reply, Oswen thinks; "I will tell all, in full, but we have garnered attention here that might threaten my group's safety. I can explain why in private."

So, *we* might be at risk, not you!

Inda, with barely perceptible gestures of her eyes signals people at the table and...

...wait, what? The tielfing is moving alongside our group as we're all standing; the two guards have unsheathed silver astral swords, flanking us all; Inda stands and marches out of the bar but the Orc is strangely just missing. It's like we blinked and missed a few seconds. We walk too, following Inda. Kindle, via passive insight, Infina too to a lesser extent, has a "Spidey Sense" - something is overall *wrong* in the whole room. She hears chairs being pushed back.

Then, a group of strangers who were seated, start to move to block our way to the door. Kindle immediately moves in front of Bel and Oswen, who now can't see much (she pops Orvil up onto Kindle's shoulder). Inafina can see clearly that Inda's group has created a kind perimeter around ours, with Oswen in the middle. Inafina surmises that Inda probably believes Oswen has whatever important object we were talking about, and is to be protected. In fact, Inafina has the Bag Of Holding with the rod segment.

"Now where are you all off to in such a hurry?" says a menacing voice, loudly, at the exit. A burly, large gith is in the way. Infina shouts back, "We're all 'off' to the outside, where the air is cleaner!" - at this moment the Gith gets flanked by two smouldering-looking creatures, burning with some internal fire! (Inafina whispers hoarsely to Oswen, "It's probably a fight, and don't use fire!")

*Another* table stands, a menacing stance to our right; it seems a wider fight is looking likely. Some other people are now trying to find other ways out, not wanting to be caught in the middle.

Inda's guards take battle stances, facing outwards. "GET BACK, you SCUM! Anyone dares make a move for us loses their HEAD!"

Oswen, in the middle of the group, sees via Orvil the strange fire creatures. We're not in Sigil so *maybe* Banishment might work? Anyone in the Outlands is *probably* from "elsewhere"! It's just a punt, really. Worth a try. She does something new - she manifests the Spectral Mind *behind* the group, at the door, then uses this to targets the left hand of the two creatures (from her physical perspective, not the mind's) flanking the Gith and casts.

To her relief and surprise, it works!

Witnessing this, the group at the door immediately take a battle stance and launch an attack (DM dice roll to determine whether they run or fight). This causes Inda's githyanki to engage. This causes the group who'd stood a distance away to leap into the fight too.

This is a bar brawl of sorts - some 20 characters involved! The DM chooses to avoid taking forever to run this turn by turn. We work on character choices and filling in gaps by narrative.

Oswen, Aracana 27 - she sees *through* the manifest mind - sees that Kindle had started to cast Calm Emotions! Oops! She calls up, "Sorry Kindle!" - but Inafina acts next. Perception 18. She is closer to that table of four. She assesses them and spots the Captain; doesn't look like he's the hardiest. Could be clever, or rich, might be a rogue or caster. One of the others looks like a magic user type, which could be an issue if they use a spell that gets into her head. "Colourful emo" would be a good description. Two huge horns, bull-like, but not a Tiefling. A bigger-looking one seems to be *growing*, some magical trait perhaps, while the fourth and last is a woman who stands back a little and sees to be just watching. She has a satchel; could be considering taking something out.

Insight 18. Between the magic user and that strange fourth person it's hard to tell which is more dangerous. Ultimately, she opts for the magic user. She is very fast and moves quickly to attack with the staff. She hits twice, stunning with the second one, using staff charges for 14+14 damage total, so switches to the satchel lady and hits. 8 bludgeoning damage *should* happen; the woman's eyes widen and sort of - glitch! A strange fluffy tail sweeps across her face from behind; she reappears, suddenly, elsewhere. She's in the corner of the room, looking frightened. No damage. Inafina shouts over, "And you'd better stay out of the action if you want to keep yourself in one piece!".

Oswen sees the githyanki near her, with its huge two-handed sword, spinning it around over its head in a dramatic gesture and ending up in the middle of the group by the door (now short one member). The sword (of *her*, we later learn) sinks into the other magma elemental (we learn later). This cleaves through and even grazes the gith alongside! The gith rolls backwards as elegantly as a - well, large hippo, basically - ever really could, and pulls out a strange staff which has a cone-shaped end. Oswen's never seen anything like it. It is metal, with a wooden base. "EAT LEAD!" says the Gith. It pulls on the staff and soe kind of huge thunderous boom comes out with a bright flash of fire from the cone end of the staff, throwing the Githyanki back some ten feet (it's a kind of Blunderbus basically).

Bel tries to cast *L4* Hold Person to try and hold three people; he's going for the Gith - but the spell doesn't take hold; the enlarging character at the table where Inafina is, and this time the spell works; and for the captain on that same table. This works too. So for a moment, that side is kind of neutralised temporarily - two are held, one stunned and one in a corner, scared.

Near the door, emerging from the ethereal or similar - "phasing in" - appears a strange shadowy wisp; meanwhile the gith is fiddling around with their staff; "You've just made yourself a target, hoppy legs!"; the staff is swung around to face the group; but then, that wisp turns into Inda's orc! She emerges with a great dagger, almost a shortsword and sneak-attacks the gith, aiming for the arm carrying his strange staff/weapon. Sadly, despite the advantage, the gith's thick skin and armour is too much and while the blade hits, it glances off.

Kindle can see very clearly that the time for calmed emotions is long past and, having stopped casting that spell early, switches to Moonbeam; he drops it down on the gith and the magma elemental next to them.

Inda leaps off to the side, drawing a hand crossbow and fires no less than three times at the gith. Only one hits - again, that skin and armour are tough to beat! Only a d6 plus mod -> 6 (magical) damage. The gith's weapon is now ready... "Hand it over little one, hand it over and no-one gets hurt!" he calls to presumably Oswen. "Think about it - it's not that precious to you and you don't need it. *I* on the other hand could *very* much do with it!"

In response, Oswen - from behind, at the manifest mind - casts Chromatic Orb, L3, lightning type; 5d8->20 damage. The damage seems to come out of nowhere. The gith spins around to face the manifest mind. She backs it away as far as she can to the door, drawing his attention further.

Inafina says, "Sorry mate, nothing personal" and tries to knock out the spellcaster, but sadly, Crit - 20+9 to hit - 29, but fortunately the damage roll is terrible, 1,3+6 -> 10; not enough! Surprising. She tries again, at advantage as she's still stunned, but since she's surprisingly not down, Inafina burns another Ki point for another stun attempt. The second attack hits too, this non-crit doing more damage, 11; that does it; the creature falls.

The other two are held. Inafina runs to the corner to face the scared lady. It feels bad but - "I suggest you convince your captain to call off the attack!" as she goes - but as she runs, the lady pulls her hand out of the bag, and throws a handful of powder at Inafina, whispering something arcane. The powder gets in her face; DEX save 19; thanks to Evasion she rolls *totally* out of the way, landing off the side. Just as well - where the dust hits tables and chairs, they corrode! Some kind of acid? So, she continues running up, shouts, "Well *that's* not very nice!" and tries another staff attack. She hits, but even with two staff charges the damage is only 18. The lady makes a cutesy show of being dismayed but now Inafina's not having any of it.

The githyanki at the gith gets back up, having being knocked backwards (at least this meant it missed Moonbeam). It goes for the elemental again, trying twice and hitting once. Then it gathers itself - apparently self-healing a bit? Seems to get a second wind. It's not done! It kicks twice; the first at the front door, which breaks down, the other kicks the magma elemental and despite it being quite weak, the elemental is even weaker in response and is thrown backwards.

There's a clear path to the door. FSVO of clear.

The elemental tries to attack the orc; miss, crit, but not much damage. The gith, now facing the manifest mind, has four options for attack! The githyanki, the orc, the mind or other of our party members. Dice roll -> Orc. There's another very loud bang and at point-blank range (even with nonsensical for a "gun") disadvantage does hit; 16 damage this time; but the orc uncannily dodges, only taking half. The orc retaliates, in a rather strange way; it tries to *trip* the gith! The orc manages to sweep their legs from under them; the gith falls over. It's accidentally quite funny... Then the orc disengages and positions itself on the other side of the moonbeam effect. If the magma elemental wants to attack the orc, it must go back through that area.

The very large creature at the other table continues to be held. The captain however breaks free. A surprising result after assessing the situation; "We have no quarrel with you! Be at peace and leave...!" - it steps back, dragging the unconscious body of its teammate back. Inafina's got good ears. She hears it. She says to the strange woman, "I don't know who you *truly* are, but it looks like it's your lucky day." The woman smiles - sharp, feline teeth and a glint in its eye. At this Inafina says "Hmm, or possibly *my* lucky day!"

Bel's holding concentration on his Hold Person spell; but he's got other tricks to try. He attempts Command on the gith. WIS 15 save. "Drop!" - but the gith once again succeeds (rolled 19). Drat! Fine, cantrip; Vicious Mockery. The gith fails *that*. Well, better than nothing... 2d4->8 (!) damage and disadvantage on its next roll.

Kindle moves the moonbeam out of the way of the door and onto magma elemental and the gith, who are a little off to the side now. He moves forward shouting, "Go! Go!" - his mace is out and he's positioning himself to try and block attacks and provide a clearer exit.

The githyanki by the table of four moves forward to guard the Held creature so that if it tries to break out of the spell, it'll run into the sword. Inda calls, "Yes, no time to waste!" - but doesn't run ahead. She's trying to usher us out.

We don't need to be told twice. Oswen starts to make a move with Bel, and Inafina rabbit hops away to avoid any chance of attack and runs. (DM rolls) Kindle successfully blocks them and the other githyanki rolls in front to help. Inda and the other githyanki start backing out. As Inafina runs, perception 19; she's got her eye on the woman with the bag, but has to turn to look at the door and just as she starts to do that, she "blinks" to move - with a puff of fur - moving suddenly next to her fallen comrade. She has *seven* fox tails out behind her! And her hood, falling down, reveals fox ears. Inafina is *sure* she's not trustworthy. There's more to this.

Inafina thinks... **I don't think this is the last time we'll see her. I think she'll come after us once she's revived her friend.**

The other githyanki and Kindle back away as Inda exits; Kindle leaves the moonbeam blocking the door. As we start to feel outside, Oswen shouts, "Should I let that fire thing back again, or...?" "If you can keep it out that's one less thing to deal with!" says Inda. Inafina shouts, "I think the fox lady will be chasing us..." but then Inda spreads her wings, "I don't suppose you have any means of flight?" "How long for?" and Inda points up to the platform. "OK, can do!" and Oswen popups the faerie wings. "These are good for ten minutes!"

Bel casts Fly on himself. Inafina uses her boots to start running up in the air. Kindle casts the Twilight effect around us, causing dim light to form; we're harder to target - and he can use Steps Of Night, that thing we saw him do in the Outlands, which needs the darkness. The two Githyanki create a silver disc that the 'surf' upon in the sky and the orc has once again vanished - we assume some kind of teleport or similar. Inda's tiefling is still nowhere to be seen but then, Inda speaks into a sending stone; "Figaro - change of plan! We need to depart immediately". We figure that tiefling is this "Figaro". We hear half of a conversation from a couple of Sendings and it seems we're causing considerable inconvenience.

Oswen is dragging the Manifest Mind at a distance behind. Orvil is on her shoulder. She can see via the Mind that the gith, one elemental and the fox lady have all run outside and appear to be calling for reinforcements! We hear shouts at a distance indicating that they're sure we're carrying something valuable; and others join the fray, hoping for a promised share in this illicit bounty.

We make our best speed - slowed than Inda - up to the mighty platform. We know which ship to aim for, of course; we make a beeline. We start to hear sounds of orders being called out. We see Figaro (the tielfing) on deck, pointing - that's the person calling orders. There's a whole lot of crew, but Inda mentions that many were on shore leave and there has been no time to call them. "We'll make do!" she says.

Given her urgency, we decide we've no choice here - we have to leave with her. Through the manifest mind, Oswen has kept a view below and sees a mob of at least 20 people coming up on a loading platform. The Aarakocra are freaking out, guards are appearing down below in the square; it's pandemonium. The gith is on the lift and now trying to make out that we've stolen something. "That's mine!" he's shouting.

Ropes have been cast off. Sails are going up. The githyanki stand near the boarding ramp, teeth bared. Some of the mob make it up and start to run forwards but stop when they realise the people they're facing. The ship now drifts out some 30ft, at which Inda calls, "Full sails! Full speed ahead!" - and the sails billow; the ship speeds away from the pier.

We are now unexpected passengers of the Lambent Zenith!

**Inda turns to us. "Right. So what *is* it that you have which has caused such a ruckus?!"**

(End of Part 2.5)
