# Oswen: Part 2.21
## Campaign day 46
### Beacon Hill, immediately after Velindra falls, just after dawn

Oswen sinks down to the damaged, gory, broken earth and grass, sitting in a slump next to the darkened patch that marks all remaining of Velindra's prior physical form.

"How *bad* a thing must be, that its influence could make one feel sorrow for a creature such as Velindra Shadowmantle; that one could know she had been wronged; that she might not have deserved the consequences of obtaining something for which she felt such desire. I don't know how bad her actions in undeath have been - who she's hurt or killed, or worse! But in her own way, she *did* save Baldur's Gate, and I am torn about whether to make sure they know that, or allow her to pass in obscurity to one day again rise, however far into the future that might be, as a forgotten, handless, one-eyed shadow of her former self."

She stands, dusting off her clothes. "But - right now - I suppose we must consider Vecna. It is surely impossible for him to be unaware of what just transpired. Even though I would very much enjoy spending a moment longer in this place to say our goodbyes, I wonder if a swift exit would be more prudent!"

Kindle says, "Otto needs to be told what happened", as Carpet floats gently over the rubble towards us and hovers nearby. Inafina goes over and kind of awkwardly hugs it!

Oswen pulls the group sending stone out. "Eye and Hand destroyed. Otto, if nothing is attack, you can probably stand down." She might have said more, or been more eloquent, but she feels drained.

Vi replies first. "What?! It's over? Have I missed everything? I'm nearly there! A few hours away!"

(Maybe we'll wait if we can).

Otto - "It's strangely calm here. I have my concerns... But... Well done, I think? Right?"

MK - "Fantastic news! I had every faith in you. Well done. This calls for a celebration! Call in when next disc-side!"

Alustriel - "This is a great victory and much needed. You may have turned the tides of this cosmic battle. My sincerest gratitude for your sacrifices." (Oswen is surprised at that response; it's more effusive than Alustriel has ever been).

And Otiluke too, everyone answers! "That sounds impossible! Yet I must congratulate you for this resounding achievement. If only we could report equally victorious news here."

Oswen looks at the party. "Votes, then; return to Baldur's Gate and say goodbyes, or flee, in fear of reprisal?"

"We need to get back to Baldur's Gate" says Bel. "We can't just leave the two of them waiting like that!"

Oswen had assumed Otto had his own ways to travel but it's a fair point about Shadowheart. We get back on the carpet and head for the Upper City. From the air, the epicentre of the wave of force that emanated from the Eye and Hand destruction is very obvious. Flattened grass; scattered stone and bones; all _outwards_.

"It's so strange to think that there was a massive battle here - but there are no bodies!"

"Lucky for us that - I guess in the rush of power? - Velindra wished them away, but overlooked us. Or we'd have been fighting both of them."

The other three confirm what Oswen thought; the Wish seemed to be cast out of both Eye and Hand together. We suppose there's some logic to that since there's an analogy between Wish and the history-altering, reality-changing magic Vecna is using.

## Roughly 7:30 - 8am (!)

We fly into Baldur's Gate with sunrise well underway, but it's still early. Inafina, perception 1; she's trying to listen to too many people! Oswen, 18. The sun rises across the river, illuminating it in brilliant golden reflections. The gates seem quiet. Things seem calm. A few people on the streets starting their day.

At the inner city, we can see and hear people wondering about the strange swirling dome, which is still up. As we fly through and towards the Grand Hotel, it starts to dissipate like drifting cobwebs; the sun rises to obliquely light the streets; surreal, calm, strange.

Inafina notices Kindle looks concerned. Quiet. Thinking. She asks him, "What's wrong?"

"I can't seem to undo this spell that I cast!"

"You called it - Forbiddance? Stops portals or something?"

"Yes. I thought I was protecting this part of the upper city, but I can't seem to cancel it."

"We can still jump *out* though?"

"That's true. But I wonder if I'm screwing up some people's days!"

Inafina laughs and says, "Well, perhaps, but it'll come down eventually. And they'll never know. They'll never know how close they came to the brink. They'll think all those full ships and night of panic was all nonsense and silly and complain about it over drinks for years. And that's *the best possible outcome*. Nobody was hurt, nobody was scared, nobody will ever know."

As we're coming down to land we see people hurriedly putting up signs about some kind of Civic Thing. **"Archduke Ravengard to address the citizens of Baldur's Gate at 9 o'clock, at the gate of Baldur's Gate"**. Oswen raises an eyebrow, "Well, what we did certainly got *noticed* at least!

Oswen HIS 11, Ravengard? She's heard of a Duke Ravengard, Captain of the Flaming Fist, quite old in the books she read. He had a son? Maybe that?

She says, "Well, we should be there at 9, assuming nothing else bad happens... I'm still worried about Vecna, but honestly, what can we even *do* about that?!"

We set down, roll up the carpet and head inside. Cleggan runs up, stealthily; Oswen jumps as he tugs at her sleeve. "You made it through the night! Well done!" "Yes, we made it in" "Now you see how the 'other half' live." "They ahve so much!" "Well, come up to the room with us, see a bit more?" "I don't know if I should!" "It'll be fine. I'll make sure of it."

(There's some to-and-fro with a pep talk; Cleggan is *worth* a lot, in terms of personal worth, whether or not the world recognises it. And if anyone so much as *looks* at him funny, Oswen gives them the Death Stare - even if only to the tune of 14 Intimidation).

At one point, Oswen explores whether or not Cleggan might ever want to leave. He looks after 30-or-so younger kids; there was a person who was "like an older sister" that he once knew and he promised he'd look after them for her. When asked (gently), he says, "I don't know if she's still alive. She was sold. She left on a ship. I like to believe that she's somewhere now in a nice house, working for someone who's nice. And she has three meals a day and a warm bed to sleep in, in a room of her own. I don't know if she's still alive. I don't. But in my mind, that's the life she has."

Oswen gives him a hug.

"I didn't know if you were coming back" says Shadowheart. Breakfast #2 arrives - fresh baking, hot tea, bowls of yoghurt and more. We all sit and the party tell their story. Cleggan's eyes just keep getting wider and wider!

Shadowheart doesn't want to leave the plane either. She was contacted to assist us here but, "this is where we part ways. There are things I must do."

"You and us both. It's been a pleasure."

"I hope, if - when we meet again, that we won't end up on different sides; I would not like that."

"I won't ruin the moment by asking why that might happen!"

"You never know. Fate is mysterious and the future is unknown."

She nods to us, nods to Otto, nods even to Cleggan; finishes her tea; touches the symbol on the chain around her neck; and in a flash of bright light, disappears.

Otto asks what we're going to do now. Vi sounded like she wanted us to wait.

The rest of us finish up and pack. Otto will come with us, along with Cleggan. We head down, check out (with the usual smalltalk) and head to Unrolling Scroll. Otto knows more about it; when universities used to be run by religious organisations, they had Academic Prisons for people who tried to teach things not approved by the clergy, or held banned texts.

(There's a side-discussion about Velindra and the fight).

We get to the Scroll. "Oh! This *is* a university." He thinks all the people here were professors or lecturers; they remember something of how they used to interact; but Vecna for whatever reason changed the building into a book store. Once inside, we calm their fears; let them know it's safe now and the book store can reopen; and we describe Vi, who might visit. We do some fetching and carrying but by 8:50am agree to leave so that we can hear the address at the Gate.

### 9am, at gate "Baldur's Gate"

It's very crowded. A man stands in the middle of the gateway, darker skinned, grey hair, surrounded by guards. He looks distinguished but old, 70s maybe, yet he wears full plate armour and carries himself well. He carries a sword and a shield with the emblem of the Flaming Fist, but holds it in a way that suggests it is merely ceremonial.

The address starts.

"Citizens of Baldur's Gate. As you are aware, we were attacked last night. There were terrorists; instigators; agents of chaos. People tried to break the city - tried to break the spirit and the laws of Baldur's Gate. Fear not! The Patriar's Council, the Flaming Fist and I, your Archduke, made vows and pledges to protect you - and that is what we have done. The thread has been suppressed. The Flaming Fist has worked through the night and, in an abundance of caution, we shielded the Upper City with an ancient ward which, as you can see, has now been lowered - we believe the threat to be over. Please, remember to be safe, to look after your neighbours, but ever be vigilant. In Baldur's Gate we have a way of life that is the envy of the Sword Coast and many would seek to take that away from us. That is not going to happen! We will provide. We will look after you. We are Baldur's Gate, today and forever more!"

There's a sort of "rar" and clap, which most people seem to get into, but Cleggan is tugging at Oswen's sleeve. He hands her a note - "I was given this by one of by brothers. It's for you."

From Nine Fingers: "You will have no doubt by now understood the deceitful authorities we labour under. *We* know the truth, as do you. Please come and find me at the usual place. 9FK."

Oswen says, "Well before *that* - I'd say, The Mark? If Jarlaxkle is there?" - we bid farewell to the book store staff (who are very much smart enough to know they should *not* spread information about the four Runes!) and head for The Mark. It seems open. Bartender there. And the darts guy! This time they know us. "You followed?" "I'll ask Orv -" starts Oswen, then stops. "Oh. Inafina?!" - nobody followed. "No alcohol for the kid!" says the barman. The trapdoor is lifted and down we go.

Downstairs two floors we look for Jarlaxkle. He's not there. Person behind the bar down here tells us that the ship got away last night. "Must have escaped the worst of it!"

We overhear some people down here are arguing about Ravengard. "Do you believe that? I don't believe it for a second!" - Oswen thinks for a minute and leaves them to it.

The barman asks us if we want to leave a message. Oswen says, "All is well. You helped save the city. We owe you." Barman says, "Are you *sure* you want to say that?" and Oswen says - "add, '...but what we owe you is not unbounded or infinite!'".

We leave and have just one last task, apart from perhaps waiting for Vi. Nine Fingers Keene. We head to the warehouse. Kindle is mumbling about something. Bel asks; he's concerned about how unfair it is for the city council to take credit for what happened. But we know that this is part of the game. The city is safe. That speech might've pushed away as many as it convinced. And in the end, it helps most of the citizens shrug and move on. Forget this even happened in a day or two. Isn't that what we wanted?

Yeah.

It's about 9:45 by the time we're at the warehouse. We just head right on in, Cleggan leading the way, escorting us with a purposeful stride!

This time we're taken through to some kind of office where 9FK sits. "Thanks Cleggan, that's all!" - but he stands his ground, Oswen says, "I think he can hear what you hear!" and 9FK reads the room. "Fine. Please, the _four_ of you - take a seat."

And so we tell the story again. The question of VS comes up, and a potential power vacuum. "Oh, no, there's no power vacuum - this is part of why I wanted to talk to you!" says 9FK. She's glad that her group played a part at thwarting the bigger play; but when she learns we're leaving the world because we must, Inafina perceptio, 20+8 -> "Typical, leaving the mess for us locals to clean up." She (insight 10) assumes that it's to do with Vecna and says, "It's true, I'm sorry, but if we do our job with Vecna you might not have a mess to clean up!"

She's misunderstood. "The unspoken, never-ending cold war that has been going on under here i Baldur's Gate erupted into outright war last night. That's why what Ravengard said is even more preposterous and ludicrous. The cults of Baal and Bane are openly challenging the Guild for control of Baldur's Gate. It's not the first time and they're not the first enemies we've dealt with but... Well. You work is done. Mine is just about to begin."

We do at least get some concession, since Vi is good with explosives! We'll ask Vi to consider helping 9FK and 9FK will listen to Vi one more time.

9FK has one more favour to ask. "Can you go and talk to that whirlpool and get it to stand down?!"

The Marid is still at the docks?!

"YES! It's causing a problem!"

"I'm so sorry. We thought it'd happily leave after flooding the warehouse! I'll straight there and speak to it now. But - that means - this is goodbye."

9FK hands over a small token. It's a copper coin with the Guild insignia on the back. She says, "This is how we communicate out in the network. Should you need to contact us, or if you need the Guild to hide you, present this. There will be no questions asked." 

Oswen asks Cleggan to head out - he's uncomfortable anyway - and then asks a favour. Oswen knows the order of things... But so does 9FK. And really, the Guild looks after those 30 people, but even so she does think Cleggan is capable. A rough childhood; few breaks; "he reminds me of myself. That's why I look out for him. But he does also - like so many of the kids we take in! - wants to grow up too fast. It's not great world out there for a kid. Not alone. This isn't an orphanage. We're not a charity. But they could do much worse than have a guaranteed meal at the end of every day and a safe bed to sleep in. And we teach them the skills we need to survive in this world."

Oswen say, "It has been a curious pleasure, Nine Fingers. I don't know if we'll meet again, but you're a friend to the four of us. And if *you* ever need *us* and have a way to get in contact, we'll come if we can."

We head to the docks. As we go, Cleggan returns the sending stone.

Oswen thanks him. "I'll miss you."

"I had a good time. A lot to think about. You've opened my eyes. Little people can do big things."

"That they can. But try to remember to have fun along the way!"

OK, so *now* the docks. And therein the Marid, having fun creating a whirlpool. We head out on the carpet. "Hello there! Umm - thanks for everything! - are you OK?" "There are so many ships! This is great fun!" "We wandered if you wanted to head back home?" "Can I go back home now?" "Yes!" "How?" "You have to release me!" "Oh! I'm so sorry, we didn't know how it worked." "Don't worry, I've had a great time!"

Oswen just needs to "think" that he's released. The Marid forms. "Oswen. It has been an honour to fulfil my boon." "The honour is all ours. Thank you for your help!" The Marid bows and dissipates in a sea of mist. The whirlpool calms.

"I guess we have to wait for Vi" says Oswen. HIS 14, she said she was sailing downriver. So we could potentially sail upriver on the carpet? We'd be slow with Otto but good enough.

"I'm not coming" says Otto. "I have work to do here. If you see her, tell her I'm back at the hideout!"

We shake hands, bid farwell, jump on the carpet and travel up-river.

Oswen guesses at least an hour to meet Vi. And she pulls out a bowl. "Do you mind if I slow-burn incense this? It should be OK. Carpet? Wiggle if it's a 'no'!" - no wiggle and Inafina thinks it's OK so Oswen starts on her long ritual. The group drift upriver on a flying carpet with the smell of incense trailing behind us.

Just before the spell completes, Oswen asks the group - "he - he did good, didn't he? Like really good?"

People nod. "He was... Instrumental!" says Bel. "Much to _crow_ about."

Oswen says, "would you all mind sitting at the corners and welcoming him? I don't think I thank him as much as I should. And honestly, he thought he was done; that Velindra would vanish him completely."

And so the ritual finishes, the incense dies down and instead, standing in the bowl is...

...the same hawk. She says to him, "I think you like this version a lot? I can change if you prefer?"

"No, this is... Me!" says Orvil, fluffing his feathers.

"You're surrounded by friends. And you helped save us. You helped saved the world. You helped saved other worlds. Not bad, wouldn't you say?!"

Oswen realises she's now able to relay Orvil's speech telepathically to her friends, without even realising she's doing it! That could come in handy.

It's some 20-30 minutes later when we spot a speedy little craft, curiously shaped, cutting its way through the water with a little churn of water behind it. It has a strange contraption of paddles that whirl away and propel it forward. That's got to be Vi! We descend to intercept. She's startled at first, but then realises who we are.

We catch up, with her still on the river and us still on the carpet. We also tell her about 9FK. She's been out of the loop for ages and we learn that *nobody* else in the Eight has come to see her and give her more information; one message a day is not enough to give deep information in what's going on.

Vi has felt somewhat isolated and is a sponge of information; nobody previously dared travel to a Vecna-converted world, though. Now we know that his grip isn't as tight as we thought. But we all come to the same conclusion one thing:

**Where is Vecna, and what is he doing that's so important that the intermittent 'broadcasting' of the Sword of Kas, or even Kas himself didn't make Vecna come running and nor did (at least, yet!) the destruction of his own Eye and Hand**.

On the one hand (no pun intended), the lack of oversight on a converted world is a weakness. On the other hand, whatever he's busy with might be _really_ bad.

Vi now tells us her story. She'd been *way* up river. The Sunset Mountains, to search for the Storm Horns, just south of the desert. A huge, huge battle happened there near a volcano. "The dragon war?" we ask. Yes; some writings suggest that, but it doesn't exist in "this" timeline - of course, that'd prove Tiamat exists. But the artefacts from that era have ended up scattered around there. And she found some stuff that could be useful! She needs to study them more and "find out how I can break reality with them" (!) - "...you're right; if you can find loose threads and pull on them, you can unravel _some_ of what he's done".

Vi decides to pull into Twin Songs and walk from there. So we accompany her all the way back and, once she'd docked, stow the carpet.

"Time for us to leave. Unless you need us to stay a while?"

Vi thinks about inviting us in for a cup of tea - "...you've got places to be. Don't be a stranger."

Oswen says, "We won't, but don't tell us where exactly you're staying. Just in case we're caught or whatever. If we come on world, I'll message you and we can meet somewhere."

Vi - "I would like that."

Oswen - "Good luck, and good hunting. You're *not* alone."

Vi - "Likewise."

Oswen grabs the amulet, our little group of four hold hands and...

...just a moment of hesitation - she looks up at the dawn sun, the glittering river, the waking-up city, hills and trees - an unfamiliar town, but a familiar world...

*POP*

## Outlands, Tasha's cottage
### Late afternoon

We're a short distance down the road from Tasha's cottage. It's late afternoon, as best we can tell. There's smoke coming from the chimney. We walk over and knock on the door. A head appears in a window off to one side, then the door opens.

"I wasn't expecting you!" says Tasha. "Come in!"

She doesn't know we're here after destroying the Eye and Hand. She wants the story, and we're going to have tea but after asking "are you tired?" and we explain that it's still really the morning for us, she says, "I can do better than tea!" - she casts a spell and a bubbling cauldron appears; soon we have each got a cup of a warm, spicy-smelling drink that, we find out (apart from tasting great!) heals 4d4+4 (Potion of Greater Healing).

Tasha's interests are more about the plane in general, rather than specifically about the battle. We explain about things like the inconsistencies between building architecture and use; how people can reconnect to divine magic; books appearing on shelves, and so-on.

When asked to describe more about Arkhan's party, and mentioning that we thought it odd for evil creatures to "have each other's back", Inafina insight 27 notices a particular interest in demonic things, at an academic level. Well, that *was* the sort of stuff we saw her studying in the basement when we found her in the dream world.

There's a knock on the door - it's Alustriel. "Welcome back! Interesting choice of place to go?! Ah, but of course; you don't have a base of operations here, do you?"

Oswen explains that she didn't know if we could be followed, so instead of the Fey Wild keep she picked Outlands - not expecting to end up right outside Tasha's place.

Alustriel wants to know all about Velindra. We learn that she used to be an agent of Szass Tam's, but maybe isn't now? There is some to-and-fro, because we don't really know the answer, although we have a lot of suppositions, gut feels and train-of-thought deductions.

"We have a history with Vecna. And this is a continuation of what we did. Sure there we re ears of peace in between, but now he's back, all those old feelings are too. The decisions we're making, the things we're going, feel right because we all agreed and we're all part of it but in those moments I forget that we've pulled other people into our orbit - not necessarily willing participants! And we haven't, maybe, given you enough... Respect. By not telling you everything."

Oswen explains that they should not feel bad. TL;DR we got ourselves into a lot of it, and we'd far rather know what we know, than be part of *whatever* on a plane such as Toril, or be fully ignorant of what was going on if we'd been in the Fey Wild. And we understand being kept in the dark about things that might get read from our minds.

It's time to put all our cards on the table. Tell you everything we know. You deserve to make your decisions knowing as much as we do, at least."

The TL;DR of *that* is - in a couple of days, we're going to Oerth. We need everyone to meet and our people in Greyhawke cannot leave, so **we go there**.

Oswen is given a sigil sequence. "This is a moving location, so it's safer" - Oswen guesses wrongly at a Spelljamming ship but in fact it's on a keep, that is moving. And when she's on Oerth, she'll do whatever she can to find out answers to any questions Tasha might about her home plane.

Oswen also remembers to ask that Vi be kept more in the loop if possible - though given that we're *all* hoping to meet on Oerth soon, it's not so important short-term! - and Alustriel being Alustriel, she's not entirely understanding, but Oswen is reasonably convincing about the importance of making sure people "feel" in the loop. Whether or not they're *actually* being told "just as much as anyone else" (in Alustriel's words!)

The plan is to meet at the moving keep, on this plane, on the morning two full days after "now". It's getting late now, so there's tomorrow, the day after, then the morning after that.

Alustriel heads out.

OK. We could do anything. So, we ask how Tasha's doing! Well, OK; she's been put on a couple of tasks. One of those is a better way to get to Athas. "You'll have to ask Alustriel about this, apparently we've lost contact with someone there..." - we realise - **Zorhanna**. Tasha thinks maybe a circuitous route could be found through "the planes I know" - we don't ask for more than that! "I know that my time here is limited. I have a deadline - an expiry date! But it's calming. FOr a start, I can't really do any _wrong_ - the repercussions of any mistakes I make are limited. It's not like I have to live with it for centuries."

But there *is* something we could do for her. "Can I see that sigil sequence that she gave you?" - well - hmm - OK, sure!

There is a bit more to-and-fro. More of a heart-to-heart, in fact. At the end of it, a tired Oswen, with Tasha suggesting that we sleep now, despite time-of-day; but Oswen says, "...Do you want to meet Froderick the Badger?" "Froderick the Badger?!" "Yes, he's a giant badger called Froderick..." "...sure!"

So Oswen grabs her hand, the party grab hands too and: *POP*



## Fey wild keep, apparently at sunset on this plane

We appear in front of the grounds. The sky is a firey orange, the fey sunset. Well, that's confusing! To Oswen's surprise, she sees a big bonfire in the woods outside the Keep and there are lots of animals nearby, startled - they are headed towards the bonfire.

"Oh, sorry! We arrived here because we thought it would be quiet - what's happening?!" we ask; and at that moment some of Oswen's librarian friends are walking out in costume! "You're just in time for Beltane" they say; Bel gets excited. A kind of Pagan festival. Oswen looks apologetically at Tasha - "Oh my, well I thought it would be quiet - I mean - this might be quite strange, do you want to check it out?!" but she says, "I love a dress-up!"

Bel is already changing into different costumes with the Hat of Disguise. There's other clothing in the Keep so we decide to head in. Froderick is inside, running around in an excited but flustered state. "You're just in time!" he says as Oswen gives him a hug. "Do you have anything to wear?" *he* asks *us*, to our surprise. He leads us to the dining room, where there are boxes and boxes of costumes! "Froderick, you're amazing - and I'd you to meet a friend of ours, this is Tasha" - and introductions are made.

We choose costumes and are soon ready to go. Outside, we hear shouting and general kerfuffle - the woman who looks after the kitchen has led the preparation of a *huge* feast, being carried on a huge board with handles, like a giant stretcher. We ask if we can help - and are immediately called in to helping keep it steady. Some of it is still uncooked as the bonfire is to be used.

Oswen's a bit worried about a bonfire in the woods, but in practice it's in a big clearing and surrounded by lots of rocks. There are various big boulders, tree stumps and other makeshift seats in abundance - and various satyrs too. Bel gets involved, introducing himself with his Mantle Of Majesty.

Nobody's quite sure what's supposed to happen, so it's all rather uncoordinated. The Campestri - who've somehow put on face paint, made in many cases to look like fierce animals! - are dancing while the satyrs play.

Oswen HIS 23 remembers about Beltane. As best she can recall it's quite important; the end of the reign of the Winter Court, giving way to Queen Titania's Summer Court. The end of mischief and sculduggery, the beginning of passion and love. The biggest celebrations will be at the courts themselves and, all across the Fey Wild, there will be many others like the one here. There will be a reenactment and _someone_ will have organised all that, so we can just let the chaos continue until something resembling order coalesces.

Leonidas stumbles upon us; "Ah, I didn't get you a tree!" he says; "I'll be right back" - Bel explains that it's a strange tradition of giving a small tree to a girl you like. If she accepts it, they dance around the maypole together.

Oswen asks Orvil to fly up and see if he can see the Palace of Hearts Desire from here. It's hard to say; there are huge flares of colour jetting into the sky, as if every domain has its own lightshow centred on a palace. The sky is deepening into more red and indigo but the sunset as ever is very slow. There are quite a few palaces and Oswen, through Orvil, struggles to see which is which.

Tasha is dressed as a cat. Oswen asks, "So, since you know - as much as it saddens me - that this version of you is sort of time limit, are you are you aren't curious about your future. Not the dark, but the light after?"

"No! I have decided I'm not. Then I would only be wondering about what that life could have been and I would not be making the most of the life that I have. I am free to do whatever I wish knowing that it will all be snuffed out in the end. I've thought about all this since leaving the dream world. I've been through dark places, but I think this is the most positive way I can think about it."

"It certainly sounds it. Well then, if you get the chance and before it gets too dark - are you able to fly? Because the view up there over the trees is spectacular!"

Tasha pulls out a broom and flies up, to excited cries of "A flying cat!"

She calls down "It looks great! You should see this!"

We're about to think of various complex solutions but Inafina is already unrolling the carpet - and we're about to get on board when Leonidas arrives, with a small tree in a pot. She grins and says, "Why thank you, and of course I accept; but before we dance, how about we fly?!"

Infina apologises to the carpet for the extra weight but of course we're well below it's maximum, just only able to move rather slowly. That's all it needs. After a few seconds we're alongside Tasha, watching the incredible light show over the Fey Wild. The sky darkens into purples and indigoes, but then suddenly kind of bursts out into almost-too-bright stars and brightly coloured aurora, with the bright palaces sending up their streams of colour too.

Later, Oswen and Leonidas dance around the maypole per tradition; there's a feast of course; various re-enactments as promised, and much song. There's also other dance, for everyone; energetic dances around the bonfire. Food keeps coming, somehow! Much of it was put into pockets dug around the bonfire, withdrawn once cooked. It's very good. There's also a fair amount of drink and after a few, Oswen stumbles over to Bel and says, "Do you have anything inspiring - just - spare?" - and he does. Bel's hanging out with a female Satyr and Oswen says, "I hope you both continue to have a wonderful evening" and gets back to Leonidas.

"Hold my hand" she says. He does. Both quite drunk.

*POP*

...and we're stood as reasonably close as it's safe to get to the central spire of the Outlands. Oswen starts excitedly showing Leonidas things she'd talked about before. Some Mustevals come by and we learn it's almost noon. Still don't know what day though!

We wander to a small hill that's a better vantage point. Leonidas points out some strange crystal caves in the spire that seem to have towns in them; she doesn't know what those are - rarely has a chance to see it this close up. Then she notices strange lightning arcs that jump their way up. "Reminds of the Radiant Citadel. I'd like to show you that one day, but it's a much longer journey. We can't jump there with this amulet."

"Sit with me" he says, sitting down on the grass.

"Do you still have the same dream?"

"The farm?"

"I understand if you don't. If you want to be out here, exploring all this. It's very wondrous, and vast and endless. All these things you do that I'm not part of. Is the dream too small? Is what I have to offer too small?"

She looks at him almost as if she doesn't quite understand the question; then says, "But what else would be fighting for? I can do all of *this* even with this kind of strange war going on. But what I can't do is just have quite days, and weeks and months with you, doing something useful, a farm or whatever. It's the little moments that count the most."

"Do you think that would make you happy? It makes *me* happy. But I..." - he tails off.

"Truthfully, I don't know if anyone can say for sure if something new would make them happy. But we were happy at the library and that was a quiet life. And it's not like we never leave the place and it's just two of us and nobody else. Our groups mix, and we travel, and at the end of it, I know I'll have this sort of - a bit like the keep, only less... Strange. A quiet place, *our* place, that's the way we want it to be, just so. Our home."

After we've chatted a while, he says, "People may wonder where we are."

"Well yes, I don't know if it's been a minute or a week over there! We should get back."

ARC 29, no issues with the amulet on return. We arrive in the middle of the dance floor, with people around us yelping in surprise, but generally thinking it's in the spirit of things.

Kindle sees the commotion and comes over, looking flustered. "I couldn't find you! Then I noticed Leonidas was missing, so I thought you must be fine, but I wasn't sure... Where've you been?!"

"How long has it been?"

"Ten minutes or so? But I hadn't seen you for half an hour."

"Sounds about right. I just wanted to show Leonidas a bit of the Outlands."

"You went... *Somewhere else?*"

Oswen puts her hand on his leg and says, "We've all been through so many dangerous and scary things for such a while now. For one night, at least, it feels like we can relax. Are there any other bugbears around? I wonder, it feels a bit unfair, that you don't have some new like souls to meet. I suppose Inafina likewise... Where is she anyway?"

"Oh it's fine, I prefer the company of smaller folk! Hmmm. Yes, I thought she was with you?"

Oswen tries to connect to Orvil and it takes a moment until he happens to circle into range and she asks if he knows and he immediately says, "Of course, she's still up here!" - and we see that she's been floating up on the carpet the whole time, just watching the world go by. Oswen thinks, then says, "I think she's OK - if we encouraged her to dance and fool around she would, but I think she's doing just what she wants to do."

A commotion on the other side of the bonfire - Bel has dressed as King Oberon and made Froderick dress as Queen Titania! He starts an oratory. Inafina quickly flies down as she's seen the performance and we're all soon stood, watching the craziness; summer court fey start chasing winter court fey; Tasha gets chased and isn't sure why but is in the right mood! Inafina is certainly up for a chase, and soon she and the carpet are chasing and pouncing on people.

After a few minutes of madness Bel raises Roderick's hand to announce that (inevitably) "the Summer Court has won!", with people all piled around laughing and out of breath. Someone throws a bag of something onto the bonfire which changes the fire's colour to a bright green, like spring leaves.

There's that shift of gear, as some people start to slow down now, full of food and drink. Some party types get even more rowdy of course - satyrs stop for nobody! - with the music changing to a more drumbeat based form, almost tribal. Over the course of things we've managed to catch up with just about everyone we know at the Keep. Bel comes over with a wild look in his eyes and introduces us to his friend. "We're going to chase sprites! We won't see you for the rest of the night, I think?" - we wish them a very fine evening and they run off into the woods.

Kindle sits back to watch, contented, Squirrel at one side and Inafina on the other. Carpet wraps itself around their shoulders as if a giant cloak, to help keep them warm as they're quite a distance from the fire now.

A sort of bearded fox man wonders over and sheepishly, but drunkenly, asks if Inafina would like to dance. She looks surprised, and looks to Kindle as if asking for permission; Kindle says, "Do *you* want to? Are you in a dancing mood?" and she looks back and says, "Well, I'm not sure I'm very good but I'll certainly try..." - and the two of them head off. A fox and rabbit dancing.

Oswen and Leonidas let Kindle know that they'll probably head back to the Keep. Kindle decides to stay a while. We go to check on Tasha, eventually finding her surrounded by people as she's telling a story about the time she caught a demon, and the book she'll write. She decides to come with us (since she's not sure what room to sleep in at the Keep apart from anything else!)

Back at the Keep, Leonidas and Oswen help set up a guest room. Froderick always frets that they're not ready if we don't give him warning, but he's doing himself a disservice as there's really nothing much to do. Once she's settled in, Leonidas and Oswen head to their room and with all the dancing and alcohol fall asleep pretty much immediately.



## Campaign day 47 and 48
### Fey Wild Keep

The morning breaks over a bonfire that's now just a wisp of smoke. There are big boards with little bits of food left, but a lot of it was eaten. Nobody has cleared up - the party ran through the night.

Oswen gets up and tries to avoid waking up Leonidas, but he stirs and once he's woken up enough to form a sentence says he'd like to come with her, so we both get up properly. Down in the great hall there are all-nighters sat around the main hall, having tea. There is even breakfast food - apparently prepared the night before - and nobody at the kitchen to ask if they need help, because it was all set up, some people are bringing in dirty dishes and things.

The old librarian is there and he's cast a Ritual of Unseen Servant, so the dishes appear as if they are washing themselves. Oswen and Leonidas help dry and put away for a while.

Gradually more and more people stir. Eventually the chef arrives and asks for "four or five strong backs and shoulders" - all those big boards need to be brought back and cleaned. Oswen goes to check on Tasha and hears she's asleep in the room, softly snoring (!) so we head out, wondering what became of everyone else. Outside, as people have woken, they've started tidying, Kindle included. He says Inafina is out looking for Bel and that they'd spent the night under the stars, protected by the vigilant Carpet.

Orvil flies down and lands on Oswen's shoulder. Apparently he spent much of night aloft, cruising on thermals, but wouldn't mind a rest now, so flutters off to find a comfy place for a settle down.

### 9-10am ish

Most of the cleaning up is done. Bel and his new female friend - we *finally* learn that her name is **Panina** - were found asleep up a tree! She gives him a peck on the cheek as the rest of the satyr troop gather and bow.. "Message me!" she says. Froderick comes over and pays them with a tray of trinkets from which they can choose. It's only now that Oswen realises they were a performance group. They wish everyone farewell and head away down the hill.

There's a strange noise behind her and Oswen turns to see a strange sight... Oswen's never seen hungover Campestri before. A wobbly procession of tired sentient mushrooms, much more muted than usual, leaning on each other for literal support, heading into the cool shadows of the woods.

Bel notes that much of the hillside has turned to mud and of course the bonfire patch is bare, so he uses Plant Growth to help as best he can with the hillside area, causing tall grass and meadow flowers to appear quickly.

We head inside to check on Tasha again. She's up and not *at all* hungover - in need of breakfast, in fact. We spend some lazy time in the main hall chatting to people. We get to spend more time talking about Toril under Vecna - Leonidas wants to hear all about that too. When Tasha notices the library and runs off to check it out, Leonidas goes a bit quiet and Oswen thinks she knows why - she says, "We didn't want to risk anything other than Baldur's Gate, and there wasn't much time do to anything before the big fight. After that, we had no idea how long it'd be until Vecna found us. So, I wish I could tell you I'd scryed your parents, or visited, but I wasn't able to and I'm still no more sure about whether or not it'd be safe to do it."

"But from what you saw it didn't look like people had been enslaved?"

"Well, not in the most literal sense no. It's - for some people at least - sort of tolerable and normal if not fun, there's paranoia and suspicion, but also it's not as strong a grip."

With Tasha now embedded in the library, surrounded by stacks of books, Oswen considers Dukka's lycanthropy and wonders if they might have something on that here, but before she has much time to think back about the collection (investigation 24) she can't help but notice that - in addition to many Toril history books - she also has a lot of books related to lower planes. Blood wars. All that. Deities and gods also.

She sits down opposite and says, "What I know of your future isn't your future at all. It's Other Tasha's future. And so I say this with that in mind - all these demons, the gods, blood wars; a dangerous game. What is that interests you so much?"

"I'm trying to figure out the missing parts of the cosmic equation. The balance! Good vs evil, all that sort of stuff. But there's a long-standing conflict between order and chaos, even within the lower planes. But things don't always add up, as if there are unseen hands moving chess pieces. I know people can control demons; it's one thing to do deals with devils, but demons resist logic and laws. The only way to predict anything with them is to Command them and that's really the only way to understand how all these equations stack up and work. How to balance things, against a bigger picture."

A philosophical debate ensues for a good hour! We're only stopped when Leonidas and some of the other Keep maintainers invite everyone to look at the orchard and vineyards. They're in bloom. We're shown all manner of trees, vines and associated blossoms. Leonidas and the team are clearly very proud of the work done. There's a great deal of vegetable growing too.

"If this carries on, I think come autumn that we might have enough of a harvest here to feed a hundred people for the whole winter!"

Oswen didn't realise the fey could be farmed like this. It's quite amazing to see it all.

Leonidas invites our group, if we can spend more time here, to be shown around the realm. In our absence they've explored and found it's much bigger than expected, with lots of hidden things they've done their best to name.

"Once we figure any given section out, we always seem to discover there's always a bit more beyond! Did you know that there's a whole field of wild sunflowers?"

Tasha thinks she'd like to stay on as long as we're here. There's a lot of interest for her in the library, for a start. So that's settled - we'll spend today and tomorrow here, then all planeshift out for the meeting at the sigil sequence to the "Moving Keep", whatever that is.

So for this day and the next, in between explorations of the realm:

* Bel works on a new song.

* Kindle makes potions.

* Inafina paints a picture - it's from her perspective on the carpet above the Beltane celebrations, from memory, but with artistic licence as it's Bel and Froderick's performance with others watching (when she'd been on the ground by then) - the roll is 25 for that, so it's a very good result and quite a big canvas given it's two days. She presents it to Froderick, given he stars in it, as well as Bel, for the Keep. They decide to put it up in the great hall.

* Oswen practices and finds her suspicions proven; all the sending and messaging and Orvil and everything else seems to have given her an ability now to communicate telepathically at will, albeit at short range. About 60ft. She mostly focuses on learning more about this realm, spending time with Leonidas, learning a bit about growing and the garden.

It actually sort of flashes by far too quickly and it's the evening; so, one last big meal, stories by the fire and, after dinner, Bel plays his new song.



## Campaign Day 49

Time to go. It's a more muted and tearful departure than usual, since this time, we stayed a while with everyone and the emotional connections are very strong. Tasha thanks Froderick for his hospitality and has crafted an Enchantment to help him out - it's an enchanted broom, that he can command to follow him around and sweep. It's very good for cobwebs in the corners of ceilings!

Eventually, it's time. People have gathered in the library. The group of five hold hands, Oswen holds the amulet and then looks at Leonidas - "I meant it; it's often the smallest, quietest moments that are the most important" - and activates the amulet.

*POP*

...and we're in the Outlands, outside Tasha's cottage. Tasha can come with us to the meeting point, but apparently can't come to Greyhawke, but she's curious to at least go that far. "I can get myself home! I promised someone there that'd I'd bring something to them, actually..." - she runs into the cottage and a moment later comes back out, shoving something into her bag.

Oswen says "Just need a minute!" and starts to draw the circle sigils. A little later, the circle is done and there's another teleport.

This one is a bit rough. Oswen's a bit out of practice and it's a new sequence; it's got a kind of "falling through the floor" feeling and we all land on our backsides!

We look around, seeing that we're in some kind of circular tower (the red barn / rocket from Candlekeep - RIPA campaign, and they're past the point where it's on legs and moves). There's a bookcase and some other things around the place, some of which seems to have been hastily shoved out of the way.

Alustriel is there talking to a Dragonborn who excuses themselves and heads down some stairs. Mordenkainen turns up and greets us but looks a bit sheepish at Tasha; but she knows she can't go further. She runs down stairs shouting after someone called "Mayastan" - "I've got something for you!"

We find out that we're still waiting for Bigby. They do expect Vi too, she's been contacted, as well as Otto. But Zorhanna is still quiet - Alustriel thinks she's surely fine, but it's strange to have heard nothing from her. Oswen says, "Well, maybe we go there next? After this Greyhawke thing?" "Well, it's hard to figure out how to get there. We do have Tasha working on a way though - remind me to check up about that with her!"

Alustriel mentions that if *we* went after Zorhanna, we'd be at a disadvantage. She thinks that magic might not work so well. "But Zorhanna relies upon magic a lot too!" says Oswen. "Yes, but it's different when she's going in undercover, rather than us going over there trying to rescue someone. I will admit I'm concerned, but it's no time to panic. She has gone months without contact before."

Eventually everyone is gathered, including the delayed Bigby.

"So what's going on?" asks Tasha. "What are you discussing?"

Alustriel says, "I don't know that it's safe for us to talk here..."

Tasha sighs. "Right. So you're going to *there* and talk. And I won't get to hear it."

"I'm sorry. But I promise you, when we get back, I'll tell you everything. But we'll talk somewhere safe too."

At least Tasha has dropped off her package to this Mayastan person. We say goodbye; she thanks us for the time at the Keep and vanishes! We don't know where she's transported herself to, but at least she's safe.

Now it's our turn. "Ready?" asks Alustriel - and Planeshifts.



### Oerth

We all appear crowded together, in a rather cluttered, dusty room. There's a teleportation here but junk has been piled up in here and some of it even encroaches into the circle. Bel starts sneezing! Alustriel starts trying Prestidigitation but mostly it just causes the dust to billow outwards.

There's the four of us, MK, Bigby and Alustriel present. We're expecting Otto and Vi to follow independently. Jallarzi and Otiluke should, of course, already be here while Zorhanna is still off-radar and presumably continuing her investigations on Athas.

Bigby finds a door and shoves it open, Oswen close behind; we all tumble out. Kindle has to wait for everyone else to move out first.

"I thought it was being looked after!" says Alustriel. "Well we're obviously the first ones here... Maybe we should clear some of the space for the others following on."

So we do that, being careful not to damage the circle glyphs.

"Where are we?" asks Bel.

Bigby walks towards stairs at the end of a short corridor; "I can hear a street - that way..." (he points) "...I think we're in a cellar of some kind. We're under the street level."

Alustriel pops her head out of the doorway. "We're in the River Quarter, just outside the city of Greyhawke. Probably a good idea to don disguises, to at least appear less conspicuous!" - after some confusion, we realise she means - humans. Bel can use his hat, but the rest of us don't have *that* amount of disguise-self style trickery to hand.

Bigby helps by casting Seeming at L5. We're all going to look like various kinds of human for the next 8 hours, although it's a bit confusing for a moment as we all change at once and don't remember who is which! Oswen hasn't seen that before; it seems very useful. Bigby offers to show her the spell but Alustriel interrupts, "Not right now though! We've things to do!"

We gather at the foot of the stairs, then head up, stumbling a bit on the way out. Kindle's movement looks strange as the illusion of him is almost 2ft taller than his true self, but it's convincing enough to get buy. We look around and realise we're next to a large warehouse numbered **23**. On the left there's a working dock waterfront, next to a wide but very smelly river. It's quite different from what we very recently saw at Baldur's Gate; buildings are more run-down, with what look like hasty patch-up jobs, and seem to be in much heavier use. The river is far dirtier too!

Someone asks, "Alustriel, where do we go?"

"I'm Alustriel, not him! That way! We need to make it to the **Silver Dragon Inn** in the Foreign Quarter."

Oswen asks if popping up Orvil would attract attention; do they have hawks here? Apparently, fine; so up he goes. Oswen starts getting a lie of the land from the ~90-100ft maximum altitude viewpoints he provides. Northwards, a huge castle or keep of some kind, with gardens and things beyond; moving South things get progressively more dense and grimy. The city itself has an outer wall, but within, two other major walls seem to divide the city roughly East-West with big gates for traversal. In some of the areas outside the walls there's farmland, but also some significant forested areas.

Down on the ground, it's loud and busy!

Inafina sees all sorts of strange things. Deals going on, often looking potentially shady; people being shaken down; fights; but Alustriel doesn't break pace and where we might usually have got involved, this time, we sweep past. People here aren't paranoid like they seemed to be in Baldur's Gate, but here at least they seem unfriendly. They seem to avoid interaction, through "being busy" or just avoiding eye contact.

Orvil perception 14. The horizon is strange! Things there catch his attention and he thinks it's odd. Oswen hears that so she says he can investigate if he so wishes. Orvil sees that towards North and South the river seems to connect with a larger body of water, as if somehow connecting two seas, or perhaps a great lake? There are also *charred* hills, some of which have clouds of smoke blowing off. Far west, a huge line of mountains block further view; between them and the river, a huge forest. But this, too, has big plumes of smoke. When he tells Oswen, she asks him to investigate (if it won't take too many hours) but he reports it might take a good hour or so. Given that she doesn't know the dangers and doesn't how long we'll be here, she corrects that - "Ah, OK, don't worry about it, we can ask Jallarzi and Otiluke" - he also notices, South of the city, what looks like an large army encampment. A mustering field of sorts.

Alustriel suddenly stops briefly and a magical effect appears around us; we feel "shiny", as if exuding charm... Strange... Oswen arcana 31. Alustriel is using a ring on her finger to do this. Some kind of social advantage, Oswen theorises, but doesn't recognise the spell.

Close to the entrance to the city through the wall, there are two huge buildings with a strange walkway suspended up in the air between them. We walk behind, but many seem to be going in or queueing. Pulleys drop down from there and a lot of cargo goes through. Oswen asks what it is; Alustriel says that all visitors to the city report there. But we're trying to circumvent that and, now, Oswen understands the need for the magical effect that Alustriel created.

Some kind of officer walks up and starts quizzing Alustriel. Where are we from, do we have work, are we carrying anything they should know about? She seems to be struggling a bit (Decept. adv. - two 4s rolled!) and Oswen chips in to help (4, 14 rolled + 4). It still costs us 2gp each! We even get given a pamphlet of local laws. The gate is through thick stone walls some 30ft high and 8ft thick. We're warned to keep to the right (South) once through - Oswen gathers that 'our kind' aren't welcome Northwards.

Once inside the gates, Oswen says to Alustriel, "Seriously though, we *could* just let Vecna have the place..." (but really, however unfriendly this place *might* normally be, we certainly can't judge it when potentially under an unknown level and nature of Vecna's influence).

We bear Southwards, following Alustriel. Houses in this section seem actually OK, despite it being a "lower" part of the city. Lots of banners and flags hanging from them, as if from different nations, with mixed architecture throughout. Buildings exit directly to pedestrian walkways on either side of a road for carriages. We're looking for the Inn; Oswen can't see it, but Orvil (adv.perception 16+4) spots it. Four storeys, grandiose, with a fancy flowing silver script over the front that catches in the sun and is the thing which caught Orvil's eye initially, with the "S" of Silver Dragon Inn shaped like a dragon. Smoke rises from a few chimneys on a steeply-pitched roof.

Up close it's an impressive building but there are two bouncers standing at the door and, as we approach, they shake their heads. "Illusions aren't going to hide what you're carrying and wearing!" - they point to a sign on the inside of the entranceway:

**No metal armour. Shields and weapons must be checked at the door.**

Grudgingly we comply! It takes quite some time. There's a debate about Inafina's staff. She claims she needs it to walk (!) - deception 19, it's permitted!

Inside, to its credit, the room smells amazing!

Two humans are running around, very busy. One is burly with silver haired while the other is younger-looking and more slight looking. They seem to be in charge and wear matching necklaces. At the bar is a third person, tending to that area.

We're told to grab a seat. "We'll be with you shortly!"

The place is lively. We notice that unlike outside - all humans - there are very diverse races present. A dragonborn with a large lute plays (drunkenly!); some almost pallid-white-skinned individuals with long black hair, half-ogres, even a minotaur. And when we look at each other, we see that *we* also now look like ourselves.

We take seats around a big circular table and then after a pause, Oswen says, "What now? Why we even here?"

Alustriel just says, "Let me check with them!" and casts Sending. A moment later she says, "Ah, they're on their way" - Otiluke and Jallarzi - "and say, 'avoid the fish'"!

One of the two presumed-owners introduces themselves as **Olaf**. He asks what we want, and Oswen enquires about the time! Apparently...

### Afternoon

...so we figure "late breakfast" / not-fish - there's a house speciality of spiced meatballs with flatbread and dips, so we go for that along with a big jug of the "house ale".

Inafina notices (perception 17) that Kindle has picked seeds out of his salad and put them in his pocket. She whispers to him, "isn't it a bit dangerous for Squirrel?" - Kindle has the 'caught out' look! He withdraws his hand and there's Squirrel. Well, it's nice to have him with us!

Bel squeals in delight - he sees Squirrel too but doesn't realise it should be a secret!

A while later, the door opens and in sweeps an older man with darker coloured skin with an ostentatious, high-collared, pale grey/blue robe. It's been a long time... It's Otiluke. But conversation quietens as he enters; we get the impression he's "known" here. People even turn in their chairs to see. He sits and barely has time to say anything before the door opens again. A crackle of sparks are coming out of the coat check area; it's Jallarzi who seems to have been caught out with something! She's handing it over. Then she walks in fully and sees us, waving and shouting over. "Where's the rest?!"

I guess we're still waiting on Vi and Otto. Oswen tries Sending to Vi, since we *did* promise we'd keep in touch! "Everything OK?" "We ran into some delays at the gate! Be there as soon as we can, sorry" - and at this, Oswen sends over Orvil to try and be a distraction. A hawk in the face tends to make one less concerned about paperwork, after all.

The meatballs are great!

About five minutes into the food, Orvil comes back into range reporting success! The other two are nearly here. And in due course, in they walk, Otto first; cursing and arguing outside; lots of clattering noises as more and more presumed-weapons are given up; then, finally, after - "Would you like my underwear, too?!" - it's Vi.

Once inside, she stops and takes it in and there's a moment where she seems, perhaps emotional at seeing us, after all this time. She catches Oswen's eye show says, "We have meatballs! And I'm reliably told they may even have a small percentage of rat!"

We end up in a private room that it seems Otiluke has arranged here, which he requests from the older of the two owners. He's no stranger to this place! It's on the first floor at the end of a hallway and seems small with two single beds and a wardrobe, but once inside, Otiluke looks to MK and we know what's coming. "Oh! Give me a minute!" - and people chat while MK casts his Magnificent Mansion spell. The wardrobe door changes into a grand, shimmering entranceway. "Please make sure we are not disturbed!" says Otiluke to the older owner (name **Sivan**) and a bouncer is assigned outside.

MK opens the door and steps through. Oswen gives the bouncer one of her sending stones and says, "If there's any trouble, which I doubt, use this to call us and then *run* - don't fight."

He thinks for a moment. "OK. If anything goes wrong, I'll warn you."

We all head inside. The mansion is different. This time, MK has made it like an (as best an analogy to Earth can be drawn) Arabic palace. Cooling breeze, billowing curtains, archways, pools. MK says he visited a place like it once and felt inspired!

At long last, we get into it. Since the Eye and Hand destruction were important, we're invited to tell our story. We do so, sparing no Vecna-relevant details. Vi follows up, telling us that she stayed for a few days, watching for anything out-of-the-ordinary - "followup" from Vecna! - strange balance changes, even. But other than the inevitable power struggle arising from the untimely departure of Velindra, nothing else seemed to happen. This has her very worried and all of Vi's agents are on high alert.

"He can't be unaware. He must be biding his time," she says.

"Either that or preoccupied?" suggests Otto.

Everyone has questions. Most of all - were the Eye and Hand *actually* destroyed? We can't know for sure. And now finally and with guilt after all this time, Oswen realises she never asked Kindle his perspective in any detail - those few seconds while he held the sword before and after. He's almost embarrassed to talk, and perhaps afraid, a dark memory. People are patient. Oswen holds one hand. The other goes into his pocket again.

"I brought Squirrel because I've been really unsure. It was a very loud, very insistent voice in my head that threatened to engulf my very being. I've been very shaken since. I am unsure if I am myself! That's why I spend that time at the Keep just making potions. I felt like I needed something grounding. Something rote, ritualistic. I wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares, that I can hear the sword. I brought Squirrel to talk to! I worry that if I were left alone I would hear the sword again."

Otiluke requests permission to cast a spell; yes; and it's Remove Curse. Kindle doesn't feel any different. Oswen's turn. Defending Kindle to the others - they haven't *felt* this damned sword! - she asks Kindle if he will permit Detect Thoughts. He agrees and lets her dive deeper. She finds within a trembling child - a young, tired Kindle, not the big protector to whom she is accustomed. INT-based check 19; she understands.

He's afraid. He's terribly afraid that something will go wrong. Whenever he gets scared, when anxiety rises, he is worried that the voice is still there - that it has returned. And he imagines how scary it would be to hear the voice and so, he hears the voice. And that seems just as real as anything else.

She says, "I can't take that *inner* voice away. Except to say that, it's not the real thing. The real thing is in this chest. I think this is just going to take time."

Inafina has been listening and watching closely. Insight 23. "I want you to listen to me. Focus on this... Feel my hands" (he takes them) "and listen to my breath" - and she goes into what amounts to process of meditation, of mindfulness. As this progresses, us four forget that the others are there. It's just us. "It's wise of you to bring Squirrel" she says. "You can talk and commune with them, ground yourself. This meditation is something you'll need to repeat. Separate your anxieties and fears from the realities. Over time, the fears will quieten and then you'll *know* that the Voice is no longer there."

MK asks us for the small chest containing the sword. "I will sequester it far a way". We hand it over. "Destroy it if you can!" says Oswen. But apparently that would require a Wish spell granted by the Eye and Hand so, not happening.

The question of the locket comes up. Everyone gathers around to see it.

"Did you feel that?" asks one.

"What?" / "Yeah I did!" - mixed answers.

Some kind of veil lifting, apparently. As if something always believed true is revealed to be a fabrication. We don't feel it, but many of the Eight do. So now Otiluke tries Legend Lore with a specific question in mind. **It's an anchoring truth** - that Kas is the betrayer **is a lie**. Kas may have been the first one to betray Vecna because of the sword, but Vecna *created* that sword. Vecna's own faulty (?) creation corrupted his childhood best friend and 2iC. What's more, this locket is a key because Kas realised Vecna betrayed him in return - **he struck a deal with the Dark Powers to give them Kas in return for a boon**.

So that perhaps explains the involvement we found with the Shadar-Kai. Of course the Dark Powers must've been responsible for his imprisonment, but the Raven Queen is not always aligned with the Dark Powers and often has her own agenda and it seems this must be the case for that original pact since she (or at least, a rogue Shadar-Kai?) helped Kas escape.

MK says that this all sounds like opening a puzzle box - even more questions now and few answers!

If it was a pact, Vecna might not have asked for anything specific at the time. It could've been a "cash it in later" deal. To help him now, or to stop helping someone or something else now.

Who might know the truth of this? Well, the Raven Queen - but that's not an easy entity to reach, or from whom to get a straight answer! There's another group, almost as difficult to deal with but not *quite* as bad, called **The Moirai** - **Clotho**, **Lachesis** and **Atropos**. Three who act as one. But we don't know how to contact them.

As for others:

* Alustriel is now fairly sure that something bad has happened to Zorhanna. "We may need to pierce through the barrier and send a group to Athas to rescue them. We're working on that!"
* Jallarzi / Otiluke say things are getting worse. They think a rod segment is present on this plane but don't know where. The "previous" rod segment is needed to pinpoint it.
* If it *is* Here it'll be very hard to reach. Someone called **Iuz** has grown a lot more powerful; they think Vecna is giving Iuz control of the plane because it suits his plans. Iuz wants to eliminate deities on this plane so that he can ascend to Godhood. Iuz is a powerful demi-human - half-demon - with some Fey powers too. A formidable combination of strengths.
* He escaped a prison where he'd been held some time after his mother fled the plane, washing her hands of him! But that means she'd had, uuh, relations with a demon...
* ...**Ah, so the mother is Tasha** - no wonder she couldn't come here. These events happened *after* the Tasha we know. She was a tyrant - this was Igwilv, the author of the Demonomicon. But once she'd left, she compartmentalised the bad things she did and separated them from herself to live with what she'd done. So the Zybilna persona is directly after that.
* A source of great evil has been traced to a maze with a tomb. An evil thought destroyed a long time ago (a familiar story!) but now returned in a different form, probably truly unkillable now, directly subordinate to Vecna - a god not just of secrets, but also liches.
* This is **Acererak**. He has taken up residence in one of his old labyrinths (plural!)
* Vi talks about Toril. She think she might be able to unravel things - the more people wake up, the quicker things start to unwind. No use if it can be reasserted though.
* Bigby thinks he has a way where someone could find and sneak in to confront Vecna.

The Moirai are in hiding, they think and have closed off their planes. A plane where gods are fuelled by belief, a "crucible" plane. An early world - **Theros**. From there are well-tread paths to the Moirai. They chronicle everything.

We have a bone to pick with the Raven Queen in many ways; for starters, if she hadn't established the pathways between the Shadowfell and Gloom, Brn's parents would still be alive. But going back to the Shadowfell is not something we're keen to do.

Is she a deity? A debate! Hard to say. She has godlike powers but largely constrained to the Shadowfell; yet she is a prolific pactmaker, so not a deity else she'd have clergy. Instead, she has warlocks. So an entity, perhaps. Which means Theros as a plane doesn't bring us closer to her - probably just further away. But within the Shadowfell, the Dark Powers are indistinguishable from gods as their power is essentially boundless.

The overall group ends up kicking around everything for over two hours and we get tired. We're invited to find wherever we want to relax, though Oswen's party is clearly thinking that it's between the Raven Queen and the Moirai.

We end up a room to ourselves (well, actually two each sleeping two, but with a door opening in between). Inafina has seen Oswen very torn and when we get into the room, she's starting to talk about the options but Oswen goes straight up to Kindle, hugs him and says, "I'm so sorry I was preoccupied with my own nonsense and and never asked how you were after the battle". And soon it's a group hug!

It hadn't helped that we'd landed directly into Beltane, by chance, when we Planeshifted out.

Kindle is certainly relieved that the sword has been taken by MK. Someone else's problem now! We still have the locket, but so far that has not spoken to us...

Then quite at random, Bel suddenly says, "I wonder if Divination works with the Raven Queen?"

Oswen hasn't usually tried a "why" question with that. We're interrupted by a knock at the door. It's Alustriel. "Am I interrupting anything?" "Yes, but don't worry!" "Can I come in?" "Of course, please do."

She tries to reassure Oswen about Zorhanna, but Oswen is fairly adamant that sure, we're sending someone after her, but only because there's something on that plane that Alustriel *wants*. And she did *not* know about how much "our kind of magic" is weakened there - she wouldn't have sent Zorhanna if she'd known then what she knows now. Our four can't go, because we'd be at as much risk as Zorhanna; we're too reliant on magic. The people Alustriel has in mind are more - physical!

"But there's something else. I need to understand the dynamic between Kas and Vecna. It could be important."

"Well, yes, that's what we've been talking about, the four of us. I think - I think we're not sure which to do first, but personally I suspect we have to do both. Although Bel had an idea that's something I want to try. That said, if we speak to the Raven Queen first, we'd have to take anything we were told at face value; we'd know nothing more. If we spoke to those - three? - first, then maybe we'd have more background."

Alustriel agrees.

So Oswen says, "Look, sometimes because we can't know, but often just Because, we've been sent places with scant information and that's put us at risk. Now, Baldur's Gate I sort of understand but -" - and Alustriel interrupts, "- Yes, I promised I would not put you in that position again."

"So what dangers await us that you know of?"

"The Raven Queen?"

"The Moirai."

"Know this. They may try to bargain with you. They have very tempting information! I must urge you to resist. Nothing good can come of knowing your own fate, as appealing as that could sound. I *have* done some research into this. There is one way that we could secure a boon - a one-time thing - that you could ask of the Moirai. There are legendary tales of mortals who have gained their favour and that requires us to send you to Theros. A highly mythical world, driven by belief. The people there *believe* firmly and strongly in the old stories. These beings that they call gods, well, I don't think they _are_ gods in the way that _we_ think; they seem to have limited power beyond their realms. I think they could just be embodiments of myth and belief and they cannot survive outside of Theros. You must _not_ reveal this to them! Their entire belief system could come crashing down. But the Moirai do have a vested interest in the life of a particular mortal - one who defies the Tapestry - one they cannot control or predict. If you were to find this child, well, this person - probably not a child any longer, if the stories are to be believed - and bring them to the Moirai (convince them to meet) then I think you could ask of them a boon."

The myth: **A child created by Clotho, defies Lachesis and escapes Atropos.**

- Clotho spins the weave to create life
- Lachesis determines what each mortal's life shall be
- Atropos cuts the thread to end mortal lives

Alustriel continues - "Now, we don't know if Vecna has exerted his influence there. Bigby is of the belief that there are no signs of Vecna there yet; the evils that exist in that realm are simply that - local, 'traditional' evils. Very powerful but nothing extraneous. How long that will last, I'm not sure; and how it would look 'on the ground' I'm not sure either. You might see something completely different! That itself would be a very important clue. Perhaps he's not interested in that world because it doesn't have real gods."

Oswen asks, "And what of the Raven Queen? We may find ourselves going directly from one to the other, depending on circumstance."

"A mystery. She's very powerful in her realm. I'm not the best person to ask about that. I don't have much experience with Her, but I know someone who does. I would urge you to speak to Jallarzi. She's had run-ins with the Raven Queen. But I *have* heard reliable stories that the Raven Queen is capricious; she has been known to trap mortals in her realm if they are not careful. And she's been known to hold a grudge! If you were to double-cross her or draw her ire, she could hunt you for a long time. You must be very careful. Go in with information. Go in armed with knowledge."

We finish up. As soon as the door is closed Oswen starts setting up Divination, chattering - almost wittering - to Bel about the Raven Queen and questions. She has an idea but then Kindle says, "Wait, are you setting up to ask about the Raven Queen or ask the Raven Queen something?" and that makes Oswen pause - "I hadn't even thought of trying to use this to talk to her directly, so to speak. It might be a good idea for later - but what I had in mind was this..."

...she finishes the ritual and says, "Has Vecna taken over the world of Theros?"

Bel has opened windows to try and dispel the smoke but of course there's no real "outside"; the world fills with more and more smoke. And soon there's far more than there should be. It's a spell! We soon can't even see each other. Kindle almost panics and grants Eyes Of Night, but the room is still heavily obscured. It's almost as dark as night. Then two eyes appear like stars; then more and more stars appear, but the two eye-like ones are the only, umm, eye-like ones. And a *voice* answers her.

"Vecna will meet much opposition should he try and intrude upon my domain, for I am the God Of Secrets And Lies. He has *no* power here."

The smoke dissipates. She runs out of the room to everyone's surprised, calling out for MK - "I need books!" - and starts talking quickly about stars and the night sky with eyes and the god - a stream-of-consciousness almost, because **she knows that voice** - HIS (adv.) 21 - MK finds a book and she flips through, and there. **Nyx** - an upper deity of Theros responsible for night, chaos, subterfuge.

Theros has a pantheon of gods; the belief-created ones *plus* the "elder gods"; predecessors, not created by belief, such as Nyx and The Moirai. They don't need worshippers. Nobody's quite sure what their true origin is.

The others have caught up with her and she points at the book.

"No power outside their realm? I beg to differ. Kindle, I think we're going to find this a very interesting plane. And by the sounds of things, an underestimated one. So that's our next move. Next stop, Theros. But not before I've talked to Jallarzi!"

Mordenkainen lends Oswen the book. We head off to find Jallarzi, who's at the garden.

"Long time no see!" says Oswen.

She turns. Her eyes are sparkling with flashes of lightning and she's playing with fireflies that are moving around her. She opens her hand. They all fly onto her palm and disappear; her eyes return to normal.

We chat a bit about what they've gone through. It's been tough on Oerth. Jallarzi isn't sure how long Greyhawke can hold back the tide and she's not even sure why they haven't been attacked with the full force of Vecna yet. "It makes me nervous when I don't have an enemy I can see and battle, something to confront face-to-face! Just general turmoil."

After a bit more back-and-forth we get down to business. The Raven Queen.

* She can be contacted if we have one of her feathers. Jallarzi used to have one.
* A Divination spell? That could work, but you'd still need something of hers to reach her, because she's not a God.
* Jallarzi, a long time ago, struck up a deal with her once. Upon hearing this Oswen blurts out, "She's not your patron, is she? Oh, maybe that's too personal! You don't have to answer that" - but no, she's not Jallarzi's patron.
* "Things have not always been as they are now. I have turned to Pelor; Pelor has saved me. But I did cut a very bad deal with the Raven Queen once! I was trying to get out of a poorly-worded pact I had made with my patron in my younger years. I thought I could play them off against each other. Thought I was onto a good thing..." - she leans in and whispers - "...but the Raven Queen does not abide by any rules. She will not be tricked into any specific wording of a pact. That, I learned the hard way."
* She's no devil. She looks at the spirit of things, not the specific words. Very powerful, able to grant significant abilities. Vengeful though, hates being crossed and it takes a lot to earn her forgiveness. It took Jallarzi 10 years before she finally figured out how to release herself from the mess she was in!
* "She's actually quite easy to find when she wants to be found. All you have to do is have her permission to speak to her - to meet her - and you _slide_ into the Shadowfell. Her agents will take you to her. She's one of those people who is nowhere and everywhere at once!"

Bel suddenly goes - "wait a minute!" - and takes off his hat. It's adorned with several feathers, and he shows Jallarzi. "That one, perhaps?" she says pointing. Oswen asks if he remembers where he got it. "No, I would've just seen one and picked it up!"

(If it *is* from the Raven Queen, it could've been from the fight with the Shadar-Kai in Kas's domain when one fell and left only a cloak and feathers, which Oswen didn't realise were significant; but who knows, he might've picked it up anywhere).

Later, "dinner is served!" is called across the mansion. We end up all around a low, long table in an open archway hall, with people at cushions. Vi conspicuously sits next to Oswen. "I thought we could talk!"

We end up chatting. Our group talks about how we all met and how we came to have the Keep. Vi talks about the Fixers, a story the others know but our four does not. Her story is far-reaching, including her origin world of Eberron and near-impossible-sounding worlds like Ravnica, which somehow has the land area covered completely in a city, layers upon layers of construction. We ask as many questions about Oerth as we can, to relay to Tasha later.

As more people chime in and talk about days gone by, there's a feeling of perhaps not being on edge for once!

Oswen notices over time, though, that Alustriel is being quiet. She's not relaxing. Oswen uses Message to quietly and privately enquire, "Is everything OK?"

"I'm just worried about Zorhanna... And other women in my life."

"Your sister should be safer than we are, I should think, in Sigil!"

"My wife, too."

"Oh! I had no idea you were married. Congratulations I suppose! Where is she?"

"We've been married for a few hundred years! She is also in Sigil."

"Scrying doesn't work? Divination?"

"Can't reach in at all. *Nothing* gets in or out."

Eventually everyone retires to their rooms. Oswen says, "Well, whatever passes for tomorrow - all these time shifts are making my head spin! - I suppose we'll be off to Theros. Is everyone OK with that?"

Nods all round.

We get to sleep.



## Campaign Day 50

Oswen's a little torn between Theros and the news about Acererak on this plane as a source of old evil, given the two people here are stretched as it is. But in terms of the bigger picture it's probably better to try and continue to understand Vecna and Kas.

After some breakfast and the usual goodbyes, Alustriel confesses that there may be some risk in getting to Theros. It's not a journey taken regularly. Given its fragile nature, the plane isn't exactly cut off but *is* intentionally kept somewhat isolated. "I have a book that could help you, but I cannot send you there accurately; I cannot open a portal to it safely."

Alustriel was clearly prepared for this; she has the book in her Bag of Holding. It is called "**Of Serpents And Skies**". The author was a friend of hers from Sigil. "It could come in useful. It doesn't have maps but gives you a pretty good lay of the land."

The idea is that Alustriel can't open a gateway that gets us to any specific location on the planet. It'll open *somewhere* and then we have to find our own way. But it's a whole world! That's a big thing; it could take us months to traverse the land on foot. We don't have 'fast travel'. Alustriel tries to ask MK about offering us Teleport but seems awkward and embarrassed almost; Inafina realises it's because it's a higher level than Oswen can read and Alustriel is trying to save Oswen's blushes. "Oh, I'm not offended! It might take years to gain enough experience and power to cast at the level you can. But it's true, that spell is beyond me right now - indeed, it's only this amulet that lets me planeshift at all."

There's the option of making a scroll, but it'd take them ages (Oswen has the fast quill, but again, can't copy higher than L6 spells yet). And it'd be one-use, with some risk of failure added in. We'd need a good idea of exactly where to go and get it right first time.

Then the DM does a McGuffin! Bel has Magical Secrets, and it turns out he'd been toying with that for a while, trying a few different things and and pipes up - "Well, there's this thing druids can do that I've been aware of, which might help? At least so long as we're not a very long way from where we need to be..." - it turns out he can cast **Wind Walk**.

Others are heading off too now.

* Otto will stay on Oerth and help Jallarzi and Otiluke; he'll investigate the threat of Acererak, Otiluke will continue with Greyhawke defence and Jallarzi will try to find Iuz
* Vi will return to Toril and Bigby will accompany her; he thinks the giants could get involved
* Mordenkainen will pick up from Bigby and try to get confirmation of Vecna's base of operations
* Alustriel wants to figure out what's happening on Athas and try to rescue Zorhanna; and she remains quite fixated on Sigil - find out what's happening; get access.

In that case, we ask Alustriel to help us get to Theros and we'll take it from there. Once out of the magical mansion we're back in the small upstairs room at the inn. That'll do. Alustriel checks her spell book to make sure of the details. She produces a *huge* diamond! It can hold open a gate for about a minute, so if anything is seriously wrong we can come back - if we're quick.

"Where I'm sending you is - well, the closest friend of ours that we have, I think, if this works. But it's not accurate. But please don't freak out - don't attack her, please! - but don't look at her" - **because it's Medusa**! - "and she's one of the good ones! Don't believe everything you read about her. She's a Gorgon."

Alustriel seems to be needing an unusual amount of focus and having some trouble; Arcana 27 Oswen - it's Level 9, complex; **Gate**; a very precise location. But the location is dependent in this question on a person and that person moves around, so it's simultaneously precise yet unknown. The last word Alustriel speaks is "...Medusa" - and a perfect circle portal opens in the wall, 10ft diameter. Beyond is a dimly lit, rocky cave. A light sea mist. We can hear the waves.

"Remember if anything's wrong, come back through!"

Oswen pops in Orvil onto her shoulder and we all step through the portal. 



### Theros

This is interesting; no strange feelings, no transition, just like stepping through a normal doorway. The sea mist starts to spill into the room in the inn, as we step through. You can even smell the air differences from each of the other sides. We look back and see Alustriel but then immediately hear a shriek and the drawing of steel blades (plural). The rock wall of the cave is about 10ft away from us. The entrance is behind us ("behind the portal") and all Oswen can see back there is a silhouette of a woman with wild hair - snakes probably - with two scimitars drawn.

Oswen calls out to Alustriel, "Alustriel, it's fine, she's right here" and to everyone else, "Keep your eyes down" and then calls out, "Medusa, I think? My name is Oswen, Alustriel sent us. This is her gate. You can even look inside, she's right there!"

The swords are sheathed and then a slightly annoyed voice says, "I can't see through it, I'm on the wrong side!"

Alustriel calls through with a brief explanation - "It's all fine! Good to hear your voice. They're looking for the Child of Fate! All the best you lot!"

Medusa says, "Oh, *nothing serious* then, '*just*' looking for the Child of Fate!" - heavy sarcasm.

Our eyes start to adjust for dim light as Medusa goes and gets something from a drawer, then says, "It's OK, you can look up now!" - she's wearing a veil.

We get into discussions. We can tell Medusa about Vecna; she knows of other worlds etc.; and we learn that there are three 'tribes' or nations/cultures of Satyrs on Theros. We learn more about how she came to be herself; it's a curse; she puts on some (magically heated) water to make tea and we are taken to the cave mouth. It's a beautiful day, an azure-blue sea, fine blue sky, mid-afternoon and hot out there but cool here. We're told it's an island.

"I hide myself here to reduce contact with other people. But there's a big chain of islands here. Believe it or not I am very beautiful! I always have been. I caught the eye of what your people call something different; we call them gods here; one of the gods, he was young at the time and as young males often do, they assert themselves against the 'order of things'. They do what they wish. He decided I was the object of his desire. I knew he was not someone to trifle with because of his family - you don't want to get involved with gods, I mean, as you can see it doesn't end well! He was betrothed to be married to another, one of his ilk..." - and she pauses - "...the tea must be ready". She heads in and starts pouring.

"If this is painful to talk about - we don't have to..."

"It's OK, it's my truth. I can only tell you it from my perspective, though, I suppose. He - well - well, I rejected his advances. I had other plans. I was closed to being ordained as a priestess (an oracle) in the main city of Akros. I didn't come from a famous family; it was my dream. The night before, he came to wish me luck; brought some strong wine; he - I... ...well he forced himself upon me."

"!"

"But what could I do? I went to my ordainment the next day. Someone somehow must've known, someone jealous had betrayed me, and told his to-be-wife. She came to the ceremony, accused me and cursed me. Anyone who would look upon me would be turned to stone."

"And I assume - should you even wish it anymore - Remove Curse has been tried?"

She laughs. "Oh, of course. It's a more binding magic than that. If only it wasn't!"

Medusa doesn't know where _she_ is, the Child of Fate, but might know someone who has spoke to her in the last year. Her name is **Serena**. No longer a child. Looks like she might be in here 70s or 80s now. A slow ageing in reality of course - her story is almost as old as Medusa's "and I have been on the shores of the Siren Sea for centuries".

Akros is closest; and that's also where **Remos** is. Usually a day by boat. Pass its protective fortress, the Colophon, through the gates - through the Warriors - and that's that.

We ask if there's anything we can offer in thanks (for tea, hospitality and information).

"An audience with the Moirai would be very high on the list of any mortal or even some gods on this world. Obviously I have some questions for them... But I don't want to ask you to promise something you can't keep..."

"Well, if there is something you would like us to ask of them, I can promise that we will at least *try*."

Oswen persuasion adv from Bel, only 3,11+0 -> 11 so Heroic Inspiration -> nat 1! but Halfling -> reroll -> nat 20. A wild ride.

Medusa seems somewhat touched by our offer. She hands Oswen an object she picks from a collection. A beautiful looking wooden sculpture of a mouse, standing on its hind legs, tail wrapped around it.

"This is for you to remember me and if you ever needed to find your way back here, the mouse will show you the way. My name, before I was called Medusa, is **Euryale**. I haven't gone by that name for a long time, except for one person! The person nearest and dearest to me. **Asteria** (or _Princess_ Asteria, before she gave up her birthright). She has been a companion of mine for a long time, but I know it can't last forever, and each time she leaves, I wonder if it will be the last. And that wracks me with anxiety, doubt and pain. I fear one day it will affect the relationship I have with her; you understand, she is my nearest and dearest friend, the only true companion I have. We have looked after each other over the years - the decades. If, by chance, you are able, I would love to know from - well, mostly, Atropos - how much time do we have left? I've always wondered whether I *actually* wanted to know that. But I feel like I am already on borrowed time with her. I don't want to know *how* she goes. I don't want to prevent that. I just want to know how much time we have left, so I know when the last time might be. I'll still live every one as if it were the last, but in between her visits when I'm here alone, it's difficult."

She bids us all farewell. We board the carpet and she points the direction. Away we go.

We could Wind Walk - but for now, the weather is beautiful and the views are amazing, so we are content to take the carpet! There are quite a few jagged islands visible and a fair amount of ship trade. We can see snow-capped mountains rising out of horizon haze, pointed out by Medusa. Soon, we're no longer near the islands and crossing the 'main' ocean; probably not in the Siren Sea anymore. Ship traffic is even heavier here. About 3 hours in, the coastline is now visible. The ships are almost in a queue here. The cliffs look beautiful with a city atop them; ships sail into a sort of short chasm and then behind one of the cliffs we see.

The cliffs are big. As we get close enough we can estimate their size at some 300ft high. In the short chasm, we see on the right hand side a fortress; a bit lower there, maybe 250ft; on the left the cliffs rise as if the rock there weathered down less, the city rising with it in terraces and cliffs. We can't see gates or warriors yet - but as we get closer still we spot them; carved into the stone, 80ft tall, facing outwards and carrying weapons to flank the entranceway. The gap is quite narrow - 100ft across maybe.

There's a rope bridge! Suspended over that 100ft wide gap is a great swooping rope bridge, between city and fort.

"I wouldn't be surprised if they could move, like the titan guardians at Waterdeep are supposed to" opines Oswen. "We'd better fly down low-ish and come through the gates, since that seems to be the expected route and it might be a law thing."

As we get close, we see people at guard posts pointing and looking. People on ships, too. Oh dear! We have caused more commotion than intended. With that, Oswen asks carpet to slow down and fly up closer to a guard post. Once within earshot, she calls out, "Hello, sorry about our unusual way to arrive, is it permitted for us to enter the city?"

A halting "Y - Yes! Did you want to go to the city or to the port?"

"Umm... We'll start at the port?"

"OK! Well, follow those ships - there!" - they point.

"Thank you!" - and we do that, eventually arriving at the port. There's a somewhat treacherous-looking road carved into the side of the cliff in a series of switchbacks and lots of carts pushed and pulled up and down it. There are wooden lifts with big ropes and pulleys to bring things up the cliffs too.



### City of Akros, early evening

It's close to evening time. Maybe an hour or two to sunset. We set down in a space on the bank, people moving out of our way, roll the carpet and stow it, trying to make that as hidden as we can - backs turned to the crowd - else we give away the Portable Hole. That done we turn and Bel is, "Good evening, fine fellows! Where is the Harbourmaster office, please?" - neither he nor Inafina are getting strange looks; Kindle attracts some, Oswen less so but it seems halflings are not so common (though we do see some).

At the Harbourmaster's office we do the best we can. The only name we have is Remos, but we have no other names. There's a blacksmith, a councillor "up" and one "down" here that run a tavern. We get details, thank the Harbourmaster - who warns us about having drawn so much attention to ourselves, the gods may become jealous! - and head for the tavern. We're a little nervous at the attention in case of nefarious action rather than gods; Inafina is listening out carefully.

There's nothing surprising about the dockside tavern - **One's Own Luck**. A very familiar setting. People are well into their drinks! Definitely not a family place... Food smells, noise, a live music performance. A young, fit-looking guy behind the bar grabs two fist-fulls of drinks before walking out to the deliver them to tables, yelling, "Grab a seat where you can find one!" - there's not much; the end of a standing table, so we head there. Oswen has to stand on a stool, kindly offered by someone taller!

We order various ales. 2sp. We might check for food later. We drink and strategise and Inafina keeps an ear out, but 5,8+8->16, very noisy. One recurring theme though - a creature called The Leviathan, whether it's real or not. In the end, when ordering food, we find out that this isn't the Remos we want but that's OK! As for The Leviathan, opinions are divided and it's not something we can worry about right now - though we suspect, given our past history, that it probably *is* real and we might well end up with an 'unexpected' encounter. Not something to worry about now.

We have dinner (1sp each) and then head out to find a way to the main ("upper") city. It looks like the winding path is the way to go and, mindful not to 'show off' with the carpet again, we start our way up. There's a "no animals" sign and we realise the carts are being pushed or pulled by hand; our guess is that the road is too dangerous to risk an animal getting loose or becoming afraid. It's certainly scary in the upper section, given the distance of the drop. It takes at least ten minutes to get all the way up.

There's another set of guard posts and a tall gate in the 'goods received' area; the main city is walled and *this* it seems is Akros-proper. It's quite beautiful - white and painted stone, slabs of marble on the grander-looking buildings and almost all of it on slopes with very few flat areas. A rocky outcrop further back has even more structures, mostly temples. Ceremonial braziers are visible in some areas which seem to be 'notable locations', smoke rising from them. Guards patrol the city walls and the gate.

Oswen wonders out loud, "Who exactly are they patrolling to catch? What's the threat?"

The guards ask why we're here and we explain about seeing a Remos and try to distract them by asking which inns are good. But they do need us to prove if we have the means to support ourselves in the city if we're not traders; Bel pulls out a handful of platinum! A bit too overt. Well, it works and we're let in; we've also heard the name of "**The Akroan**", an inn that's expensive but would be appropriate if we want to talk to *Councillor* Remos.

Heading up - rows of houses, 2-3 storey shops, a sunken public area with market stalls and a performance stage, mature trees around here and there... Quite busy. Beyond the walls, rolling down other hills, are farm areas and some grand-looking estates/villas.

Oswen takes a guess at the blacksmith as the next choice. There are plenty of signs, pinned to the sides of buildings, that help us find our way around. Trades are collected in a specific district and the sounds of carpentry or smithing are distinctive; people seem to work late here as, while some shops have shut, several workshops are still going. We ask of one, "Hi there, looking for Remos? Do you know him?" - we're pointed the way, not far. There's a sign called "Remosteel". Hmmm. That's probably it. This one has a closed door but there's an "open" sign so we head inside.

There's a small shop, with a workshop behind; a bell rings as the door is opened but there's loud hammering and nobody comes. Oswen uses Minor Illusion to make a loud version of the bell. The clanking stops. "Someone there?" "Hello!" "Be right out!"

A halfling emerges from the workshop, with googles on their head. This is indeed *Remos Ganon* and we introduce ourselves. We start asking about Serena and find out that about 8mo ago he did have a strange conversation with her; something to do with a helmet with wings - he has a log book and is able to pinpoint things from that. She was looking for *someone* but it wasn't him. He wished her luck because she was looking for a *councillor* Remos. "It's not my place to say what these nobles do - but maybe he's not of noble birth - because it sounded like she said she was his mother! Didn't look like a noble to me... More, someone - touched by destiny, know what I mean? Tragic, maybe sad. Not quite there!"

Oswen remembers that Bel had been thinking about a new weapon, so since we're here - we ask about that. Bel shows his rapier and asks about other weapons in part-exchange. Steel is Remos' thing and shows Bel a dirk - a sort of long dagger - that's lighter yet stronger than Bel expected.

It's a well made, practical weapon. In comparison, the rapier is very ornate with beautiful decorations and handiwork. Remos is surprised at the notion of sale, given that, but - "...how about 25gp?" - the steel Remos makes is very good (+1 good, to be precise!) so that's a more than fair exchange. It's given a fresh sharpen and checked over, and is able to fit into Bel's boot within a thin leather sheath.

We thank Remos #2 and head out and find an alley to make ourselves look tidy! We'll get Bel on his best "I'm important" behaviour and head for The Akroan, trying to pass of as maybe-nobles.

There are big buildings this way, with large columns. A Hall of Justice; a great library; increasingly manicured with beautiful gardens, carefully tended. Bel as usual is noting places to visit - one in particular, **The Philosopher's Table** - but we almost miss The Akroan, taking it initially for a temple!

It takes some doing blagging a room. Only the "senator's suite" is available. They clearly don't think we can afford it, but of course we can; it's 5pp a night. 15pp total. And they want a (refundable) 15pp deposit.

We learn there's a huge spending vote happening in two days, which is why the place is so full.

We get shown around - the place has many facilities, including a "relaxation room" and even a gymnasium - until eventually shown our room. A double door on its own landing is flanked by attendants. "The senator's terrace", we're told. It's an entire half of this floor, looking out over the city. "This will do well very well, thank you!" says Oswen.

We learn from the doorman there, called **Manon**, that the spending bill is related to "The Leviathan Threat" - and grants a lot of powers, transferring from "this side of the gap to the other side of the gap" - to the fort - for purposes of defence. Public spaces might be converted to military use; there are already more patrols; it also sounds like a 'done deal'.

"As I understand it most people expect the outcome to be already decided, really".

There's a powerful faction trying to push for it. Oswen mentions Remos - one of the most vocal of the opposition. "He needs to watch his back or he might disappear like a few of the others have!"

At least 3 councillors had been arrested on various charges ahead of the vote, all from the opposition.

The conversation gets a bit more conspiratorial but in the end we find out that Remos uses the gymnasium and the doorman or his brother **Banen** (who does the night shift) can let us know when he's there. We pay 10gp for the information and the service; seems like the least we can do!

Once inside the room, we have a debate. It's interesting, we find ourselves on the opposite side of Ordulin - if Vecna's on the way, giving in loses less life (because *we* know it's possible, hopefully, to undo his reign, but they don't) and at the time we'd have argued for a military position. But here, we're not sure which is the right answer. We'll just have to speak to Remos.

Oswen decides on Divination next. There's incense here! Shrines outside. She only needs 25gp of it, at any price, according to the rules of the spell. Curious that it should work that way! Perhaps something intrinsic about the *nature* of perceived value? She could think on that for days - almost gets distracted - but then goes out onto the balcony to use a shrine and cast. There is debate about the question. Does the leviathan exist? If not, no problem. If so, is it a threat? So only ask that second question. If not, no problem. If so, will a military response counter it? But if "no" to *that* one, it could just mean the leviathan doesn't exist, so there's nothing to counter.

After some to-and-fro the others point out that this plane has its own priests and, given the things Medusa said, an Oracle. They must've asked these questions already and we could seek them out to find those answers. So Oswen figures - must be a question they don't know they should ask. There are many such questions related to the problem at hand, but she finally settles on one.

"Is the appearance of the Leviathan being caused by extraplanar interference?" she asks, open-ended, to the gods of this plane.

Smoke swirls for a long time. Then a vortex forms and, in the middle an eyelid opens, to a massive, blue eye, lightning and storm clouds swirling around. Not Nyx this time. A voice projects forth.

**"The Leviathan is the Titan that has lain asleep under the sea for centuries. It is of this realm but its release, and the release of *all* the Titans, is *not* an act of our doing. It is caused by the actions of *Another*. Not one from The Mother."**

As the smoke starts to clear, Oswen says, "Know that we mean all of you no harm, and if we can play a role in protecting you or the people of this world, we will do it." But Inafina has noticed people outside gasping and pointing. A maelstrom of storm clouds had built above the Inn while the spell proceeded and lots of people saw it. The clouds clear as the spell fades.

The others heard only thunder. Oswen relates what she was told, but isn't sure exactly what counts as "from The Other". So, she checks the book. Investigation 25. The god she talked to was **Keranos** - the god of knowledge and storms. Tumultuous knowledge; knowledge of things that are unknown. Not secrets - but more, things people do not understand; a "god of mysteries". The gods in the book are all considered born of Nyx, who is "The Mother"; Nyx gave birth to all "minor gods" - the belief-driven ones. To defend Nyx, these gods imprisoned all the other primordial gods - and they're now known as Titans - but there *is* one layer "above"; the three that are the Moirai. And Nyx's husband **Chronos**, estranged, is out there somewhere but not normally involved in anything as far as we can tell.

* Moirai - possibly even from another world; "above" the other gods
* Nyx - present and involved
* Chronos - husband of Nyx, outside of time, not engaged with anything or anyone
* Belief-built gods - children of Nyx, and present
* All other original gods - now known as The Titans

...but once the belief-built gods had imprisoned the others, they ousted Nyx, declaring their own hierarchy and 'court' of gods. Oswen thinks more about the specific wording of what she was heard. **Nature** 22, another half hour of reading, it's fully dark outside - 7pm maybe - a complication! Mortal *humans* specifically are considered *a creation of the gods* and therefore "not of the mother". They are the "abomination" that Nyx disagreed with her children about. Her children created the humans of this plane. So that's *another* possibility - a human on this plane is doing this deliberately. But Keranos almost capitalised the "a" of "Another" in his response. A very specific human, or another entity entirely.

The Children gave the humans free will, which means they'd be defying fate, choosing their own fate; defy the Moirai. But the Moirai wrestled back control and control fate of all humans too.

* It could be Chronos, but that seems unlikely
* It could be a specific human
* Could be extraplanar/Vecna
* Could be the Moirai

Oswen realises her question was poorly phrased - a risk of a yes-no answer and not asking *who* did this in the first place (she didn't really know to ask of such a thing). But she's fairly sure that the answer _implied_ - through the way "Another" was used - that this was not a visitor to this plane. Another of this plane. Could even be Serena...

...well, "Philosopher's Table?" says Oswen. She looks over and Bel is already changed into his evening-wear attire! "Shall we?" - he holds out his arm - Inafina loops hers in and says, "We shall!"

We step outside and Manon is still there. "Ah, Mr Bel! As requested your booking at the Philosopher's Table has been made!"
