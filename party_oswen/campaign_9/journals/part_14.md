# Oswe: Part 2.14
## Campaign Day 34
### Radiant Citadel

Oswen awakens to sounds of a guitar being played very softly. Kindle is asleep. Inafina *appears* to be asleep but one ear is up. Bel isn't here. Oswen ventures out. There Bel, looking startled. "I didn't mean to wake anyone up!" Oswen asks Bel to keep playing. We watch the early morning play out. Eventually the others join us; we pack up and go to leave. This time - for the first time ever - we are paying *after* a stay, not before.

We learn during checkout, chatting with the inn owner, that Manivarsha is not the name of a world. It's a name for something which doesn't even exist anymore - that's why there are Manivarshans here in the Radiant Citadel - it used to be the greatest city state of **Shankarbhumi** - *that* is the name of the world. And we get directions to the right office for the Clavigers.

Turns out a jewel will be departing there within the next hour... Moonstone. Blank looks! We're shown a box of display gems, used to identify transports. I mean, what's wrong with a number painted on or something?! But anyway, in due course at the right time - we head down to the dock area. Oswen hides Orvil away. Crowds and a new land; don't know how they'll react.

Surprisingly, lots of other people are turning up. Many remind us of "The" Manivarshan. Others though look very different, but all the people we see seem to be painted - decorative, elaborate designs on arms and/or faces. A jewel descends and we start to board. We're asked "Are you going to Sagrapoor as well?" and we say, "Oh, no, we thought this was going to Shankarbhumi" "Ah well Sagrapoor is one of the major cities!" - ah good! - and we ask about the painting designs. Today is the Final - the 12th day of the Shankar Trials, which only happen every 12th year. The longest running games known, they assert. This is the 1462nd Shakar Trial. Nearly 18,000 years, then!

There are 36 participants on the first day, that come from all around Shankarbhumi. The trials change every day and at the end of the day, those who don't complete their trial bow out. This year, in the Final there are 15 people left. The way in which people talk about that makes it sound like this is unusually *low*, which is quite odd to Oswen who's accustomed to games in Ordulin that narrowed down via pairs of competing teams - so a Final would by definition only have two teams competing. The culmination of the whole thing is some kind of sacred dance, dedicated to whatever area from which the winner comes.

(Oswen ARC 21, how does this crystal work?! It traverses between planes; how? What role does the Claviger play, vs the crystal? The crystal goes towards the Gloom but does not enter. It gets close, but then the whole thing Planeshifts. It's quite impressive given the size of it. She'd expected something like the captain on the Lambent Zenith had described - a kind of doorway that you could "sail" through. When the spell completes she sees that are now high up above a (very large, country-sized) *fragment* of a land. Ah! Another partly destroyed land - of course. It is surrounded by mists all around, huge. She points at the mists; "Are *those* the Mists of Manivarsha?"

"Well, we do call them that yes - as a way of remembering what happened to it. But the mists happened when the original world was destroyed. This part, where the Four Rivers used to flow, is all that remains of the world that was Shankarbhumi. It used to just be called Bhumi, the local word for 'planet'."

### Shankarbhumi

We can see *three* mighty rivers that meet in an area that looks like some kind of swamp. Not four, and moreover, what's the source? And how does it flow away?! "They used to all flow into the fourth river, but now it all flows into the mists. A mighty city-state used to be in an island where they met, risen out of the middle of the fourth river - *that* was Manivarsha, the greatest of all the cities. That title now belongs ot Sagapoor."

The crystal moves in and docks next to a huge city, which must - surely - be Sagapoor. It is raised out of the truly mighty river, at least a mile wide. The city extends lengthwise along the river, but extends out into it quite some distance. The architecture would to our eyes look like a mixture of old Indian / Cambodian. Buildings are mainly low but where the do rise, it's from angles, up at an angle, then up straight, then an angle - and so-on, forming sort-of-domes.

Oswen is talking - Perception 4 - but Inafina (perception 18) is looking around. She is sure she sees ruins, submerged, of another city reclaimed by the river. Swallowed up by the swamp. *That* she figures is probably the remains of Manivarsha. The rivers meet and flow to the edge of the mists. Whatever happened there, it can't have been good! In the distance, tops of old spires poke out from the tops of the swamp - and Inafina is *sure* that the mists *come from* that swamp and, perhaps, the ruins themselves.

We are welcomed to Sagapoor. The Clavinger will be back later today "with another group". They visit regularly and will certainly be here tomorrow.

We discuss our options. The "mists" - swamp - are a fair distance away. 2 or 3 days travel, perhaps. Difficult to traverse. And we don't really know what we're looking for. A boat would help us get there quicker. We'd better get the lie of the land and start trying to talk to random people to see if anyone knows what this might mean, get a feeling for anything... Amiss.

Getting more into Sagapoor, we encounter great throngs of people. It is very busy! We are invited to follow some of the people we'd met on the crystal. They're saying we must get to the riverbank. It's very festive and very, VERY busy! Lots of stalls, food, incense, people dancing, lots of different dress but only a *small* proportion have the paintings that we'd seen on our journey.

At the river bank, there are lots of decorative barges. People are piling onto them! In the middle of the river is a very beautiful, very decorated, multiple-domed temple. It is clearly a very major place. A long courtyard or showground seems to have people gathered in particularly large numbers and we assume that this must be where the next Trial is happening. But before we know it, we're on a barge and being pulled over on great ropes to the temple docks.

We didn't expect to be here, but this is the great Temple Of Sagapoor. It is dedicated to a river spirit called **Iravati** of the same-named river **Iravati**, which is the river on which Sagapoor is built. A sacred conch shell - a river conch - is present, gleaming upon a special chair. We learn that the river conches are generally highly prized and that particular one is considered sacred. It's certainly huge and gleaming, iridescent.

It's overwhelming. So busy. We figure out a scoreboard - 9 people left. Oswen pops Orvil back in. "Sorry, but can you fly over and give me a better view?"

Orvil flies around the temple, quite low. Perception 16. Through his eyes, Oswen sees the main contestant area briefly before Orvil is out of range. Nobody is in the temple, as far as she can see; it's all in that showground-like area, which has tiered seating set up all around. The temple appears to have... Water elementals?! They stand guard at entrances.

On the river itself, Orvil is sure he sees a glint of iridescent green, almost a green light. On his own volition he investigates. But when he gets close, perception - 5! - he can't see anything. Just a big river, big enough for waves.

The crowds are on the move. An event ended, another will start after a break. The next event is the "first dance" - just a name, for a showdown with some of the final contestants. The "last dance" is the last showdown. People seem very excited. We ask about a name we heard on the crystal - Neesha. People point to a tall woman with wavy, olive-black hair wearing a firey orange/red wrapped dress and black pants. She looks to be preparing something with gold rings and streamers. These dances we hear are "sacred dances" that must be devoted to someone. And Neesha is "of two places" but she "must pick one". What two places? **Tippurika** (another city) and **Manivarsha** - she is a descendant of the latter and claims to be Manivarshan. Apparently this is, to some extent, scandalous? People normally revere the riverine spirit of the river upon which the city *in which you live* is built. It's considered odd to bring up Manivarsha and remind everyone of what happened there.

There is changing. Different people's names - their chosen champions.

Oswen calls Orvil back and we try to find a way to get a better view - higher ground. Kindle can see some trees that Bel and Oswen could climb up! There are people in other trees, so *Inafina* and Bel give that a go while Oswen asks to get on Kindle's shoulders! Now we get a bit of a view.

The first dance happens. It's devoted to the city of **Ashwadhatu** - a male dancer called **Anuttom**, that city's champion. He devotes his song to the riverine spirit of the **Mehul** River. We are told by spectators that it's a river that flows from highlands, dropping down over many waterfalls and carving ravines.

Next, Sagapoor itself. This is **Jamdani**, a female dancer. It's a wide ranging, strong, warrior dance. That's for the Irivati river all around us, the widest of the three. Deep and strong. There's a lot of local support!

Then a hush... Nisha next! **Amanisha** in fact, is her full name. She uses her gold hoops with streamers. Inafina notices that the band seem to be preparing for something a bit different; it's much more lively; the dance is dedicated to the riverine spirit of **Adirohit**. Oswen notices people seem affected by that; they seem startled. Oswen asks, "Is that a spirit from Manivarshan times?" "Yes! It's not against the rules... But the river no longer exists, why isn't she dedicating it to her city instead of Manivarsha?"

It seems quite the scandal and is dividing the crowd. The dance hasn't been seen in a long time. Now Inafina understands why the band looked surprised; the music, too, hasn't been heard for a long time. It's a particularly animated and athletic dance. While breathtaking, somehow there is conveyed a sad and tragic side - whether that's coloured by the snippets of explanation shouted up to us by spectators, Oswen can't say.

Legends about a river being angry, engulfing Manivarsha because they were corrupted - disconnected - but others disagree about that last part, much myth and confusion; but whatever the truth, a very sad thing.

The judges seemed frosty at first but by the end seem to have warmed. When Nisha finishes and bows there is an eruption of applause. The judges declare it to be "permitted" and say it is a moving and worthy dance; they ask the conch in the big seat to be moved, to add a fourth city of competition - Manivarsha. It's a move to appease the crowd but works well. **But then someone screams in horror;** it comes from the end of the platform at the edge of the temple; then more; Oswen is already getting Orvil up directly, and he tries to get to look in the right direction but (perception 11) is busy trying to climb. But he sees the crowd from that edge cramming backwards. And now he sees on the river, close by, a rolling almost tidal wave rising up from the river. He thinks to Oswen that he *did* see something before, and this must be it; she agrees; she's relaying what she sees to her party by shouting over the noise. The middle looks almost like a 20ft high wave, building. Coming quickly.

Oswen calls down - "can  you get me there quickly? Can I fly or anything?" and Bel immediately casts Fly. Oswen calls down, "Follow if you can, but the crowd is moving your way, take care!" - Kindle calls up, "Do we need everyone?" and Oswen says, "I think we might need to get out of this crowd, it's gonna get messy" and Infina is already wind-walking in pursuit. Bel has already cast at 5th level, because he knows Oswen so himself and Kindle find themselves lifting off.

Barges and boats are being overturned by this wave! It has crashed into the city and is flooding lower areas there too. Oswen and the others are heading directly towards it; the only thing she can think of is to try Thunderwave. This crazy wave is a mile wide, spanning the whole river now, but there's an obvious "vanguard" and Oswen heads directly for it. She *might* at least be able to disperse and disrupt it enough to reduce damage.

Neither Inafina nor Oswen (awful perception rolls) can see what's under there. Orvil points out a different place to look - an effect he sees (ADV roll) -> Oswen 19+1 -> 20, an aurora in the wave, streaks and wisps of glowing green. It's certainly not natural (Arcana 24). But it's not a spell; it is some kind of - entity that is *part of the wave*.

Oswen changes plan, not Thunderwave; she will try Telekenesis to move as much water as she can, blasting it backwards, to disrupt and maybe reveal what's under there. She's preparing it while Kindle (with divine intervention) shouts "I must protect the people!" and flies to the edge of the temple area, where more people are, falling back a bit from us; yelling, "Don't panic! Hold your ground! Don't crush each other!" and casts *Control Water*. Oswen is astonished to see a trench opens up in the water, directing it around the temple; it's 100ft cube, which is enormous but it's still tiny compared to this overall effect. It'll still flood behind.

Oswen is expecting something to be revealed, but instead, the green wisp parts with the water, going around us; the whole wave is suffused with it. They move and flow like ink stains in water... She flies in, very close, staring; and it gives her *an emotion*. It behaves as if it's looking at everyone! Looking at *her*. With hatred?! She casts Detect Thoughts immediately. The effect is immediate - *seething* hatred. **Unbridled fury and anger**. Surface thoughts are - DESTROY. She pushes deeper immediately; *why* destroy? She is successful and feels herself falling deeper into this horrifying entity's thoughts. This is a magical construct, a creation, a *corrupted spirit*. There is no coherent thought; destroy; hatred; **destroy the Manivarshans**. The voice in its head is not its own. **It has been commanded**. They must pay, they must all pay, they must be destroyed, like Manivarsha, they must be brought low; the pride, the hubris; destroy them; wash it away.

She wants to cast Banishment but there's no specific creature to target. It really does seem to just be some *presence*; some of the green wisps are coalesced in front of her and she tries to use that as a focus, burning up the spell, but it doesn't work. She actually gets the impression that it *might* have done, but whatever this thing is, it just sort of shrugged off the effect. And now it's more or less passed by; the 100ft area is closed up behind and the wave moves on. The spell broke so early that she didn't have to switch concentration on Detect Thoughts.

All around she can see people being swept away, swimming, yelling; but nearby, she sees people trying to shelter in the temple but they are *under attack* by the water elementals she's seen via Orvil. She shouts out to the group and flies down towards them. Kindle has to hold his ground for his spell; Inafina and Bel flank Oswen, Inafina actually moving ahead. Some of the water elementals are using wave arms to bash and pummel groups! One even holds a person up by the neck. Oswen calls to Bel, "Try to get the crowd's attention and have them keep back, point out that the wave is being held at bay" and switches Detect Thoughts to the water elemental that's holding someone. "Punish these intruders! Defend the temple!" - it's just simplistic; they are guards. Bel activates a Mantle Of Majesty. Fey, radiant and glamorous. He sings as he flies, almost like a chant for them, which Oswen realises is a clever way to get the spell up as well as be an entertainer; but he can't hold concentration on Fly. And that messes up Kindle, who *must* stay in place to keep the wave at bay. So sadly, he can't do that - he has to just lift in song, use minor illusions, shout; and he's on form! Persuasion 29.

We fly down and Oswen touches the creature that's holding someone by the neck. She touches the water creature and casts Tongues; "They are not attacking! Please put him down! They are afraid!" - persuasion ADV is 18. "They are not attacking? Why do they approach?" and Oswen points at the wave! "This is harmless to you. But it is lethal for them!"

The creatures call out to each other and raise tridents - and now, they join Kindle in controlling the water. The temple is now safe but on the river it's just wreckage and ruin. She shouts "Thank you!" and then to Inafina and Bel, "Get down there and as long as fly holds, try to help everyone in the water; we'll swim our way out once the spell fails" then she flies up to Kindle and tells him what we're doing but to be prepared; she'll try to message him before the spell goes down so he can land, but she can't guarantee it.

At this Kindle starts carefully lowering himself anyway, as best he can. He ends up stood right on the edge of a stone wall. Precarious, but it'll be OK if the spell goes down and for now he has some extra ways to move!

The rest of us start trying to spot people who are in trouble in the water and help them out. Bel and Oswen can only do so much, but Inafina is faster. There are hundreds in the water, but her ears can pick up the cries that are quieter - because those, she thinks, are people actually *going under*. She keeps heading down, giving them a staff to tug on, then getting nearby people who *can* swim to help. Oswen and Bel work more with bits of broken wood, getting other people to help - anything.

It feels like forever but the wave has fully passed in barely a minute. Kindle changes his spell, starts trying to use it to push water towards the bank to help people, or pull people towards the island. It's *very* full of very frightened people.

In the last moments of the fly spell, Oswen gets back up to the water elementals and thanks them. At that moment, a couple of priests come out - shaking - "How did this happen? What is the meaning of this?" and so-on. They move downwards, injured people everywhere. Then someone cries out, a voice rising above the others - "Nisha! Nisha! Where is Nisha?" - the performance area hadn't been hit. The judges then call, "It's gone! The water took it away! We saw a spirit, it looks like a riverine... But it can't have been, it was not of the Iravarti..." "What's gone?" asks Oswen, now nearby. "I saw a wave arm come out and snatch the sacred conch! The Shanka! **It took the Shanka!**" and then someone else calls out, "Yes, and it took Nisha!"

More stories are called out. They appear to agree - the shell and person were carried on the wave. They point downriver - towards the marsh and the mists.

Oswen Messages Bel; "Regroup at my location by the temple doors now please". It takes a while as Fly wears out and it's very crowded.

They don't know who we are; but Oswen offers - given we've demonstrated our credentials! - to go downriver and search. The priests thank us, but are shameful; they say it's *their* job to control the river, but the temple doors were magically sealed and it took too long to unseal - they were caught off guard. "You will need a river singer to travel downstream. But I fear what awaits you when you get back to shore... The city is... It is a scene of devastation. This is the greatest tragedy to have struck is in the history of Sagrapoor. I wish there was more I could do to help you..." - but indeed, that is why we're offering to help. But only the "river singers" can traverse into the mists and return - nobody else can. "Do you have one to spare?" we ask - "Go to the city. Search for **Plabon**." "Do you have any idea roughly where in the city they might be? The city of course has its own problems right now, it'll be crowded." Apparently they live in a floating village of boats... Well, perhaps they managed to ride the wave somehow.

So we need to get to the city banks, then travel downstream as they were probably swept that way. We need boat. Kindle can do that! He casts Water Walk. OK, arguably better than a boat! He can also help 6 people close by. And - off we march. Kindle insists we get to the city first, to help the six with us.

It's a mess. Smashed barges, flower wreaths from the celebration, clothing, sandals, bags, and far too often - bodies. Past hope. Kindle is muttering under his breath. Oswen assumes prayer. She reaches up to hold his hand. Where we see people alive, we do what we can to shout instructions, but we can't stop. We only intervene when there are people struggling in the water, but there's no denying the trauma of all the cries for help to which we simply can't attend - just too many. The city is covered in mud, bits of boat, and more; it looks like the water got up high and very few places were unscathed. Water still flows out from houses. People look disorientated and lost, some wandering the streets apparently in shock.

We at least can give the six with us some instructions to help. They're thanking us for the parts we played. It's worse for visitors, who are totally shell shocked; they don't have a community here, and don't really know what to do. But soon, they wake up a bit - start offering places to stay like the Citadel, solutions for the injured and more. As soon as the next jewel arrives, word can be sent out and much more help can arrive.

The six head off and we are alone, proceeding initially along the bank. Inafina wants to help more people. So does Kindle. Bel is glum, frequently looking back to the ruined city, water still cascading down streets. Oswen insists it's too big for us; she's seen devastation before, now, in Toril. We've helped more here than we did there and now it's up to them - they're looking out for each other - we now need to find those responsible. And Oswen has a dark suspicion that perhaps it was Nisha herself that did this. She wasn't taken with the conch; Oswen suspects that Nisha herself is the thief.

We can at least walk back out in the river to help direct anyone who might be struggling or confused or similar, but we can't spend too long. Everyone wants help. We're literally walking on water! Kindle is particularly conflicted, often apologising, overly-apologetic, if we don't help - trying to explain we need to look for the river people, and so-on.

Oswen brings up Orvil again and his first words as he stands on her shoulder and flutters his wings angrily and says, "I Knew something like this would happen!"

Oswen is, like "huh?!"

But it turns out it's just paranoia. He was a bit freaked out any the crystal creatures watching and apparently all being connected and ever since has just had this sort of, portent of doom feeling, like something was wrong. And in fairness he thought it would happen at the Citadel, but he's still somehow unsurprised that something bad happened. "It's been too quiet for too long" he says. Oswen hasn't seen this side of him before; he's not been in the Fey a very long time. She even asks if he wants to go back. "Certainly not!" and more angry wing flaps.

In the end he takes to the skies and tries to spy river folk! Well - a collection of boats, hopefully intact. Perception 14. It's not hard, actually. The lashed-together boats are easy to see, still a tied collection, but beached and damaged. They're amongst mangroves. We head over in that direction.

Up close, we find some boats are floating; those are crowded. Many more are on land, much smashed. A lot of household detritus floats around. We get involved using ropes, strung out between us, to skim the top of the water and try to catch as many things we can since every pot matters. But soon we are nearly out of time, and have to get onto a (crowded) boat.

They ask who we are; we try to explain in short; we ask how they are doing. The floating village was designed to withstand storms but not a tidal wave! It was at least resilient enough to withstand much of the onslaught. Their Elder is safe - a judge - so heard first hand what happened. They mention an "abducted" contestant and the Shanka and this is a good time for us to mention that it's why we're here. We ask for the river singer Plabon. He's gone into the mangroves; some river kids are missing and he's searching.

("Orvil, please head up and see if you can spot any of them - I know it's difficult flying, but see if you can get anywhere.")

The mangrove "swamp" on the drier land isn't just a murky, muddy swamp, except where churned by the wave. It's not dry enough to keep going on foot without more water walking so Kindle does just that, also offering the feat to six of the river folk who might find it useful to recover things.

We head inland, finding stuff swept a long way in. Orvil is gradually stretching a head, but can really only go branch to branch. Oswen (ADV due to water walk) Survival 19. It's easy enough to follow the trail of the wave. We find a small collection of smashed up material collected against a particularly large cluster of trees with big roots. A middle-aged man is there, with four kids. We introduce ourselves; just come from the village; can we help?

"I've found them! Just - hold on..." and he tells the kids to stay put, then encourages us to move to an out-of-earshot location, because he wants to speak. "The kids are really freaked. One of them isn't a strong swimmer yet but the others refuse to leave him behind".

He has a tiny raft, which can take one small one. Kindle can take another. They spot the bird. "This is Orvil!" - one of the kids wants a pet bird some time. Oswen describes it as - a friend, not a captive or property. Be good to the creature and if it likes you it will stay. Oswen asks if Orvil wants to spend time with the boy and Orvil is happy to.

On the way back we talk to Plebon and he thinks we actually need a **Mahji** - something more than a river singer. "They are our best and most courageous navigators". He will talk to the Elder. The Mahji doesn't stay with the river folk - they're mystics of sorts, very skilled - and may or may not agree to go; but we should ask. "They are attuned to a different rhythm."

Back at the village there is some rare joy amongst all this darkness at the rescue of the children. Plebon is celebrated. There is a debate about what to do next - opinions divided on going on land up to the city, at least temporarily; others who thing that they're *boat* people. "Take away the boat and we are just people!"

The Elder arrives and smooths things over. People who want to go on dry land for a while, with no home here, can go with blessings and return any time - but he says they must be realistic about the state of the city now, which is no better off, he thinks, than they are. The Elder the points to us - he recognises us - "The tall one with the fur! He cast the spell that divided the waters."

We are invited to share their food. It's a communal thing. The have to create a stone fire circle as most of the boat ovens are still drying out, if not destroyed. Deep pans are added, river water is boiled and spiced; there are plenty of fresh fish and clams literally just washed up, knocked our or killed from the force of the water - food is plentiful, if for dark reasons. Half coconuts are used as bowls.

Talk turns to history. As sensitively as we can, we enquire about the history of Manivarsha. Why might something or someone of Manivarsha wish destruction of Sagrapoor?

* Plebon thinks there was another spirit involved - it was not Irivarti - other people saw the green wisps, which they all thought straight away was a riverine. That's what one looks like. But it was *not* a riverine, says Plebon. An impostor. It didn't behave like a riverine either.
* The legend is that the riverines raised cities out of the river and protect them; live in harmony with the people of the cities. Manivarsha, though, was destroyed by its riverine. A huge tidal wave descended upon Manivarsha a century ago and destroyed it - submerged it, sinking it.
* From what Plebon saw today, this wave was a minor, tiny version! The waves for Manivarsha must have been 50-60 feet high, at least, and not just one wave; several. "I sensed it. I sensed an intense jealousy in the spirit. I couldn't connect with it." (We realise he *talks* to river spirits; for real). "I think it is a spirit of an emotion. Am embodiment."

Oswen describes her experience and Plebon asks many questions; she does her best to answer them. "The words used are old; not the language, but the intonation and structure we use now..." he says, musing. "And you say it sounded male?" Oswen nods. Then he suddenly jumps; "Ah! Please come join us!" he calls out. A small, flat-bottomed boat is approaching, paddled by a fairly handsome man with a small head wrap over wet-looking long black hair, about chin-length and an open white shirt. "Please, **Dukha**, come join us!" calls Plebon again. "This is good timing! I was telling you about the Mahji who is part of our village? This is him! This is Dukha!"

He was much further downstream, it transpires, when he saw this huge wave roll down. He tried to follow it further downriver but it outpaced him and entered the mangroves and out of sight. "It was not a natural wave!" - and everyone brings him "up to speed" on our conversation. 

We ask what the significance of the conch might be, beyond it simply being sacred. It was fished out of the fourth river - the grandest and most beautiful - for the first ever Shankar Trials. It is imbued with the magic and sacredness of this land when it was still whole, before it was broken and before Manivarsha was destroyed. It is given to the winner and they take it back to their city, where it lives for 12 years, bringing great prestige, honour and prosperity.

Plebon asks if Dukha will help us follow the spirit and the wave - find the conch, rescue Nisha.

Oswen notes that Nisha surely would've won the conch. The Elder agrees and says that after her dance, she was so far ahead that "the competition was hers to lose". So while Oswen is privately thinking - well, then, maybe she *didn't* steal it? - Dukha says he thinks Amanisha is the thing we don't understand. Why was she taken? Where is she? She's at the heart of this, he says. And it's weird. Nobody has represented Manivarsha in the Trials for 108 years - not since the last Games before it fell.

We certainly _something_ is up, beyond the obvious, related to her.

Dukha asks what we want to do. Plebon says "they're in need of a Mahji", answering for us. Dukha is concerned, implying he wants to dissuade us. We do our best to explain; we're wrapped up in this now, having seen the devastation; the priests asked; there _might_ be a magic artefact behind much of it, and we want to take that away and have it destroyed; and - well, Nisha and the conch went --> that way (!) and everyone else is busy with the mess after the wave. Maybe we can find out where it came from and determine if it will happen again.

Dukha isn't convinced, but Plebon after a while pulls him to one side. Inafina thinks that Plebon is trying to reassure Dukha that it's OK.

Suddenly, one of the kids calls out - they eat around a different table - something in a language we don't understand. The elder stands, looks in the distance; it's evening, the sun has mostly set but there's enough light to see a raft with a lamp and three people coming downstream towards us. One of them starts waving and calling out. People start fussing around to get ropes and help them dock.

It's a much older man and woman on the raft, maybe in their 60s, and some unrelated younger person who seemed to be there to move the raft on the water. They step onto the bigger boat but are quite unsteady; they don't seem too familiar with boats. There is a formal greeting - as far as we can tell - and they are invited to the meal we think (given gesturing), but refuse (more polite gesturing) and then we're introduced and things shift to broken Common.

"We heard you were at the temple and you were responsible for the wave-breaking... We spoke to the elders and they said you might be here and you are helping. **We are Amanisha's parents.** We wanted to come and help you, somehow; if there is anything we can do to help you - to help find her..."

We sit and start to talk. Initially we ask about Nisha's strong connection to Manivarsha. The mother's grandmother was a young girl when Manivarsha was swallowed by the river. She survived because she was visiting a friend in another city. She remembers her city fondly and still has some artefacts, just childhood things, from there. "We always reminded Nisha of where she came from, so she would never forget. Maybe because of that, like a lot of other Manivarshans, she ha this romantic notion of it - she remembers Manivarsha in its glory through stories, pictures, items and artefacts." The mother has never been herself, but notes that "in each telling, the city gets greater." She didn't know, though, that the dance of champions would be dedicated to Adroit. That spirit no longer exists; the river is gone, so the riverine is gone. So the mother finds that odd. "It's just a marsh now."

The mother says her grandmother was descended from the Manivarshi line and Amanisha chose to take the name Manivarshi herself. It's been a tradition in the women of her line. But it's one of the largest families in that city and only one line of it is royal. Their line isn't.

Nisha seemed unusually interested in reading up and studying before the Trials, though; "I should have realised", says the mother. "This was the book that she read last. I don't know if this could be helpful to you? This was on her desk." **She hands over the book**, and also then gives us **a necklace full of shells and pearls**. "This is hers. She will recognise it immediately." She also **gives us a small conch**. It's something Nisha's sister and her used to use when they were children. It's for calling; you blow in it and it produces a sound. Each has a unique shape and, so, a unique sound. This might help alert her to our presence in the marsh and try to find where it was coming from.

There is a sort of blessing made for the four of us. "We hope you are successful in venturing into the mists downriver."

They tell us where we can find them once we return, whether we find Nisha or not. It's a place in Sagapoor, as they intend to stay there and help.

They depart immediately, pushing back up river.

Dukha reluctantly agrees he will take us; but "things here may not be the same as where you are from. You may see things and you must - I would hope - you -"... he pauses ..."- interpret them with an open mind; that you do not fear or cast judgement quickly on what you see. I cannot insist that you follow my instructions, I would not presume such but *please* try to at least heed my advice when I give it. I know the mists very well. And please, unless you have no choice, do not seek violence. Unless you *must*. Reach first for caution and curiosity than for your spear."

He would prefer if we did not go at night! And so - as requested - we heed his advice. He is going to leave and return at daybreak. He bids everyone farewell, then leaves on his boat.

For our part, rather than clog up their already over-full remaining boats, we can do fine on dry land. Plebon nods; he can take us to a mangrove area that's dry nearby. We're asked if we need insect nets - Kindle thinks we have it covered but they give us a small spare net anyway. It has a hoop and a hook, and is hung from a tree - ideally one overhanging a reed bed. They'll point Dukha in our direction in the morning.

We're taken over in a small boat to a serviceable dry area. We quickly get things set up. Oswen gets to work on the book straight away! Comprehend Languages & Investigation 25. It's written after Manivarsha had fallen.

* Much talk of the spirit; what it means to be Manivarshan; the dominance of the city, how it considered itself somewhat above not just the other "minor riverines" of smaller rivers but also the "big three" other elder riverine.
* The other cities had been raised by the riverines out of the river but Manivarsha stood as a bastion - the strongest river spirt but knew how to appease the river spirit the most; most attuned to the spirit; the spirit always brought bounty and they obeyed and worshipped the spirit.
* Adirohit was the most powerful and short-tempered of the spirits; considered the ruler of Manivarsha in many ways. Royal families in the city adhered to Adirohit's wishes and desires and were richly rewarded in the process.
* They'd win 3 out of 4 of the Shankar Trials.
* The most famous Manivarshan winner was the last one to win, their records never beaten (according to the book), was **Jijibisha Manivarshi** - (male) from a royal family. Interesting; there's a vague family connection to Nisha, then.
* There's a mention of the conch being recovered from Manivarsha so the conch was sunk with the city. Divers searched for and found it.

There are hand-written notes. Some things are underlined or circled. Margin notes talk a lot about Jijibisha, questions about how closely Nisha is related to her, "does the spirit of Manivarshi flow in me"; some things circled and "close to time!" with numbers written underneath, as if those were compared times similar to hers. That's hard to understand but Jijibisha appears to have been an inspiration / idol. Some pages are more dog-eared implying repeat visits - stuff about how the dance of Adirohit should be done, the exact movements, the song, the prayers.

The book omits the one thing Oswen's been wondering about - *why did Adirohit destroy the city?* - and Kindle helps her water walk, since the river people are close by. "Sorry to bother you again!" - and as gently as she can, she puts the question: *Why?*

The Elder says there are theories and stories. They are a separate people; no Manivarshans amongst them; but it is presumed a punishment of some kind. It happened out of nowhere. Sure, the riverines do sometimes rise in anger and Adirohit was certainly short-tempered, but this time it was with such fury that it completely destroyed the city. So it seems *beyond* a punishment. It was a cataclysm. There was always a strange relationship - the city would grow to excesses, then the river would "remind them who was in charge" (!) - but it was strange. Everyone had returned to the city after Jijibisha won his Trials and there were huge celebrations starting, when it was destroyed. That's part of why it was so devastating.

Oswen remembers to ask Plebon what he was thinking just before Dukha arrived when we mentioned a male voice in the spirit(s) connection she briefly had. All the spirits are female - the only one Plebon is aware of who's male is a minor river, *in* the mist. *The river is **Tinjhorna**.* It sometimes flows, sometimes doesn't... It became more established after the fall of Manivarsha due to waters being diverged. "You will see it when you head in, but Tinjhorna is a beautiful river fed by waterfalls - the waterfalls of the waters that once was Adirohit; once was Manivarsha."

In due course Oswen gets back to the group. Bel is fussing around, trying to figure out how to get a comfortable bed roll position on tree roots and dried reed bed edges! Kindle is watching; he can't really move much as he needs to stay inside the magical hut area that he's set up. In the end, a collection of pillows from the bag of holding do the trick!

We set up watch.

* Oswen 17 - she hears the sounds dying down from the boat people village; night birds, occasional fish splashing in the water, frogs; strangely peaceful.
* Inafina adv (hearing) nat 20 -> 27 - towards the second half of her watch she hears different sounds; like people - well, *something* - creeping through the undergrowth; going into the water; then shaking water off; she looks around and in the darkness, she's pretty sure she can see a pair of reflective yellow eyes, quite low down to the ground; and then it's gone... She keeps listening, but it doesn't return.
* Kindle (Inafina warns Kindle to keep a careful watch) 18 - he's on full alert, but doesn't hear anything unusual.
* Bel 21 - very jumpy, unused to sounds and in the end wakes us up a bit early just to get some company!



## Campaign day 35

We pack up. We can hear the boat people in the distance and someone comes over to check on us, and we go back to the boats with them and join in breakfast. Bel offers things to spice up breakfast and there's salted fish as well as a savoury porridge. We're just finishing up when Dukha arrives. We're told to not worry about washing up our bowls so quickly get into the boat.

We're asked if we have hammocks. No! We learn that we can't sleep on the ground. It's not safe... Safer to sleep up in trees. We're able to borrow things that can take the weight of three of us in one net, and Kindle in another. It lets us set up an elevated "platform" of sorts.

Dukha waves goodbye; "I will be a while, take care, please; look after yourselves..." - pushes off and we start to catch the current downstream. Once in the middle, we move quickly with little additional steering or paddling. There's a lot of forest around here. We have to be careful not to lean over the edge of the boat too much - there are opportunistic hunter swimming creatures who can try to jump up and drag someone down! River dolphins follow us at one point, and these are apparently a good sign - the area is safe - if they get skittish we need to be careful later.

By the end of the day, as the sun gets low, we head into mangroves. It's too far to get "into Manivarsha" as he puts it, in the night. We'll camp close and head into it first thing in the morning. He finds an area with larger trees and ties the boat up.

Between Oswen and Kindle using things like Telekenesis, it's easy for us to get our things up into the trees - but Dukha stays down below. He sleeps in the boat; it's "safe for me". The boat is tied on shore, but on a length of rope that means it is out in water some way. He doesn't seem to set up a bed. He gives us a few survival tips for things like access to clean water, e.g. in certain reed beds that act as a filter. It takes us a while to get the big nets set up and it's quite unsteady but if we're careful - and crawl up there, rather than walk! - it's decent. Kindle feels a bit blue for being separated on a close-by tree, but it's not far. Dukha bids us good night below and says he'll be on patrol, but asks us to *not* come down the tree. "For your own safety, stay up there."

Oswen asks Orvil to spend time with Kindle overnight and to keep him company. Inafina agrees to Oswen's request to take a careful watch by herself, to listen to Dukha's boat and see if anything similar to last time seems to happen - Oswen has a theory about Dukha and what Inafina saw last night... We'll all take watch anyway, and Orvil will help Inafina with sight.

* Oswen 13 - up a tree. Harder to figure out. The usual sounds; more frogs up here, sometimes they even hop onto then net briefly! Birds visit, maybe monkeys or something in the distance?
* Inafina adv (hearing) another nat 20! -> 27 - at the start of the watch she hears sounds from Dukha's boat and with Orvil's help she sees a shape creeping from the boat and into the water. There's a moon above, and Orvil's asked to fly around a bit to see if an angle gives away that telltale reflection in the eyes which she saw. The swimming shape moves away and then on land, a short distance from us, she sees a tiger emerge from the water and shake itself. She can't help but grin. It shakes, cleans itself, looks towards the tree and watches... And that's when at certain angles Orvil sees the reflective yellow eyes. It pads off after a while, sits looking at the water then jumps in! It comes back quickly with a fish. It eats it, cleans itself, looks at the tree; walks in a slow circle at a distance, always looking at the tree; then at one point, it dives off into the distance (and Orvil has been told to keep close as we don't know what we're dealing with) but there's a sound like animals fighting in the distance for a good half minute or so, then it stops.
* Kindle - he also witnesses the padding sounds and eyes; this was the tiger's return, after Inafina's night watch ends. Then eventually, he notices Dukha back in the boat, going to bed.
* Bel - even with Orvil's help, he can't really see much. But it seems to be uneventful.



## Campaign day 36

We wake as the sky lightens on the horizon, sunrise imminent. Dukha is still asleep. In whispers, we exchange information. Tree frogs observe! We have a rations breakfast, quietly. This attracts small flies - to the delight of the frogs. We pack up what we can and wait for Dukha.

He's very soundly asleep... So, we end up taking down the netting and packing that too, then Inafina tries to wake Dukha. He's seems tired tired. "You must be tired, you had a busy night!" "No, it's OK, I'm fine!" Inafina is observing closely, wondering if he has injuries. But he keeps himself hidden in clothes and a towel, then disappears around a big tree for privacy.

When he's back, and we're about to leave, Oswen goes over his rules; he agrees; but she says, "And we can be trusted a bit more with the unusual; we've seen a lot! Speak of which I think we owe you our thanks for fending off something last night?" - and after a bashful moment - we learn that there are more like him but they're not unified. And they do sometimes fall prey to their own instincts, which is why they live out on the river - away from other people. "The key is to look amongst the reeds" he says, as we push off, pointing to some. "And every now and then, if you see a large tree, look at the bigger branches - the lower ones - and you might see a pair of eyes. We will be passing through the territory of at least one."

He asks us about the wave. We go into as much detail as we can, focusing - with Kindle and Oswen having been right up front and centre - on the way it split, the green spirits inside, the male voice. And the water was clear, not muddy, in the wave. Dakha says he has seen this before, but only once - some 13 days ago - and Oswen remembers (via inspiration, adv HIS, 23) **that this was probably when the Trials started**. "I was talking to the riverine **Tinjhorna** down in the waterfall pools. And as I left, when I was leaving, I thought I saw glimpses of an unusual green - I thought it was just catching the light - but later on the boat, I definitely saw - them? Not reflections, going the wrong way against the current; I tried to give chase, thinking they were fish but they darted deeper and disappeared. "It could have been heading up river, towards the Trials. I didn't think anything of it at the time. I haven't spoken to Tinjhorna since, but if I had I would've mentioned it."

We can, if we wish, see Tinjhorna. An offering would be made; we construct a creative mat of lily pads, with decorations of flowers and birds nests! Orvil can help make sure we don't collect any that are still in use. Apparently it's about the aesthetics.

In the mists, Dukha must steer the boat. It helps if we can keep a lookout up front. Orvil and Oswen volunteer for log spotting duty while Inafina listens carefully to the sounds of the boat's wake and water channels to get a feel for if we're in the middle.

The disadvantage of the mist is offset by Orvil's eyesight (he perches on her shoulder, since it's too misty to fly, and Oswen looks "through him", her own eyes closed). A lucky 17+2 -> 19 perception. Inafina isn't used to listening to the water but her keen ears help; ADV perception 15. She's surprised to hear what sound like water over more rocky areas, small rapids, and splashes against what she thinks must be an unseen rocky channel edge - not reeds and mud, it seems? Orvil helps Dukha avoid logs and other debris - Dukha knows the channels but not the debris, since that changes. And now and again, the water clearer here, weed not present, she sees through Orvil buildings. Here and there, spires - like the tops of temples - poke up like trees, made all the more convincing by plants and weeds hanging off them. Reminded strongly of the flooded lands in Hither and how much it affected us, she checks in with Kindle. He's had time to prepare after talking to river people, so he's OK, but nobody is unmoved by what we all see over the sides. It's both astonishing in scale and horrifying - Kindle says, "How did this even happen? How does a whole city like this, become flooded and sink! How does this work? Did the river just rise and stay risen or did the city fall? It must be 50, 100 feet! I don't understand."

Some buildings are crumbled and toppled. It's as if a wave came and never receded. "Perhaps, the wave came because the city suddenly sank - lowered down - perhaps that's what the riverine spirit did..." but Dukha steps in; "Well the legends say that the riverines, who are worshipped by all the peoples here, created the cities - lifted them out of the water, almost - they created the ground, anyway, on which the cities could be built."

We drift through the city for more than an hour. The course is strange, with some sharp turns - until we realise that Dukha is actually following what were once streets. Then Inafina hears water rushing more in the distance. We turn another "corner" and now suddenly it's much louder! She warns Dukha. There are more trees here, with some taller buildings providing more "ground" for them. "Who has the best throwing arm?" he asks. A rope needs to be hooked up a tree. Inafina says "no problem!" - takes the end and walks up with her wind walking boots into the air! She's looking for a strong branch and soon enough has one, above a side channel. Kindle helps pull the boat in, behind something that's out of the current and it's lodged and tied off.

The rest of our route is by foot!

First, we look around to see if we can make our offering. There are many pools in this area, where the taller buildings have created sorts of pool-based oases protected from the stronger currents around. Dukha thinks this area was once ceremonial, based on surrounding architecture. The mist here is low-hanging, with the sun shining through, but that makes the mist even harder to see through.

Oswen, nature 15. An area that might once have been a rooftop courtyard, balustrades surrounding a pool, corral an area of water lilies. Flowering ones are easy to pick, with Inafina's help as it's a bit deep for Oswen! Dukha explains that you make something with lilies *or* birds nests, not both, so we focus on the former.

Kindle starts creating an arrangement, then casts a ritual; he calls us all together; and he casts Water Walk. *That* makes it easier. Bel helps weave a mat from a sort of flax and we fit the lilies into the overlapping intersections until a sort of decorative mat is produced. Bel then levitates it, to stop it from being damaged once we start to descend the waterfalls.

We get to the edge. Unnerving... The mist "falls over" with the waterfalls and we're able to see this huge horseshoe formation, with lots of beautiful small waterfalls falling down to the lower section where the mist is again pooled. We have to climb. Bel's unsure, but we have the Rope of Climbing to help. Dukha goes first, essentially abseils down while Kindle holds the other end. Well, that's the way! We find a place for the rope to tie itself off and we can all follow suit. As we go down we're surprised (not necessarily pleasantly) to realise that we can see the inside of a tall building as we go down, behind the waterfall. Lots of rocks and other things are lodged in there too though. It's confusing. Some looks like rock formations, but some looks like a building is superimposed. So here, it's almost as if the city sank into the rock itself.

Large boulders with smaller trees are at the base of this great waterfall, which has split into streams falling into numerous small plunge pools that flow out over more mangroves. It doesn't look too deep. The mist is different; it feels more like water spray from all the waterfalls and not fog. We can see through to some beautiful large trees beyond but this area still stretches away further than we can see. Dukha points the way to a plunge pool where there is a shrine to Tinjhorna. It's easier going than he's used to, thanks to Kindle's Water Walk spell.

Clear water, sea grasses and reeds, fast and clear without lots of buildings. Now and again, spray overhead creates rainbows. We reach a larger pool and a stone shrine, stacked up and made with an offering area, as a small shallow pool in front. "Do we put the mat there?" "I usually do! Then I just kind of camp up and pray and say devotions and... I don't know it works. Sometimes Tinjhorna hears me and appears."

We lay down the offering and start to wait. Oswen takes the time to switch out the teleportation amulet and switch in the telepathy helm. She also pulls out one of the last few bottles of elven wine and hands it to Inafina to share out! Kindle works on re-casting Water Walk too, since we might be here a while. Dukha has some though he is looking around for a camp site. While he's doing, we keep an eye out and sip at the wine, because we have to remember - for all the bad things - everything we're seeing here is extraordinary and a good many of the people who live in this world wouldn't even ever see this themselves. We try to take it in.

Over time, critters turn up, like the frogs in the tree - but here, we seem to be of interest to cranes. They wade up, looking at us between picking at things in the water. Then some river otters turn up! They're quite daring, probably looking for food. Owsen thinks about giving them some food when Orvil thinks - almost accidentally - "they look tasty!" - ah, a hawk after all. Oswen decides not to encourage the otters.

Good thing Kindle left Squirrel at the keep. Too much chance of acquiring even more furry friends here!

D20->5. Oswen attunes. It's been an hour. Dukha's back. We're just sat chilling. Every now and again one of us heads to the shrine to pray. To Oswen heads over and tries reaching out telepathically; seeing what she can find, thinking in terms of "revered river spirt, we are from a far land" etc. - fully a punt. Lots of animals! ARC 26... And then, she senses a presence. But it's all encompassing; the entire body of water around her. And she realises that the helm is connecting her to it without it expecting it, so she's sort of intruded (it failed its saving throw, surprisingly) and so she immediately apologises for the intrusion.

Now the presence focuses on her. It's much more aware of her. But the pool around her starts to ripple the flow up and form into a sort of lively, flowing figure. The water is always moving. But it has a shape and is a bit more opaque; a slender, younger man - if it were a human. Flowers in the hair. Wristbands made from woven bracelets with flowers, shells on a necklace. A brocaded silk tunic of sorts. Remarkable that such details can be discerned despite this manifestation being water. He leans down as if to smell the water lilies; looks to the group, locks eyes with Oswen and realises she's the one in direct contact.

Dukha is surprised and stands abruptly; "Tinjhorna!" - he makes a sort of prayer gesture and bows, then introduces us. "I bring you... New visitors to the land. I hope that is OK."

Tinjhorna speaks, in Common and out loud; a higher pitched, male voice. "Welcome! This is very beautiful, thank you very much. This is a particularly good one! What brings you here?"

Dukha answers. "It has been nearly half a moon since I was here last. But most importantly these people here wanted to meet you. I have spoken of you and they asked if they could come to your shrine and place an offering and perhaps meet you. I have no... Wishes."

Oswen is confident there is *no* similarity between this voice - in ears or in head - and the one she heard before. She explains that a big wave hit the city, and someone was swept downstream. We are trying to find them. Perception Nat 20 + 1! 21. Tinjhorna flinches... A recognition. "Yes! I heard. There was a big wave. I heard that it was terrible. But it had nothing to do with me." Well, certainly, we acknowledge that. Has Tinjhorna seems to have nothing to help us with though - no consciousnesses, no people came this way.

Inafina with Inspo, insight 24. Tinjhorna certainly recognised the described event but is answering not defensively, but *in fear*. We remember being told that the big river spirits keep the smaller ones in line. She water-walks to Oswen and says out loud, "Well" (while tapping her head with a finger) "I guess we'll need to keep looking."

Oswen "thinks" to him instead. "If I talk to you this way, can we be overheard?"

"I cannot talk about this. It is too dangerous. We can be overheard." 

Oswen isn't sure if that's true, but the fear is now very evident and very deep-seated. Surface thoughts are present - pain. Tinjhorna has been hurt - injured, even, somehow - in connection to whatever this thing is. She needs magical means of assuring Tinjhorna that they can't be overheard. If there could be security... It can be theatre... Something shielded.

She says to Kindle, "I guess we might need to stay a while and think about our next move. Perhaps a hut? Here sees good?!" And Kindle isn't sure if it's needed fast or by ritual; Oswen says, "There's no time like the present!" - so he burns a spell and she goes inside. She signals to Tinjhorna, "Come inside!" and once he's in, she **says**, "We are shielded here. If we speak, we cannot be overheard" - and to demonstrate she calls loudly out to Inafina, but Inafina doesn't respond. Dukha comes inside, looking surprised; Inafina and Bel stay outside, for whatever reasons. Dukha vouches for us, hoping to make Tinjhorna more confident.

Tinjhorna pushes the tunic down off a shoulder. The elemental form there is visible injured there; deep necrotic slashes. "You do not want to mess with... You don't want to mess with the forces that took Nisha. It is not safe. There was a wave created, but it's not a wave. It is the wrath of a more powerful elemental under the control of the Evil One. The Angry One. The Vengeful One... It is not in control of itself. But it is... It is the elemental spirit..." "Of the old river?" "No. It has been called - created - commanded. I can hear its pain. It was being commanded to create a wave. It is painful for it to do so. It is not what injured me. It is the Vengeful One."

"Can you describe what they look like?"

"It is ancient. Older than I. I was here when I was created. I opened my eyes and its hatred was all around me. I have always known it to be the Vengeful One. It has always abused me! A being of anger and pride and wrath. It lives deep... In there..." - he points downstream. "The **Marid** carried the girl" (we gather that this is the commanded spirit) "unconscious but not drowned down there. She must be his prisoner now." At this Kindle reacts immediately, looking at Oswen. She knows that look.

"But you must not go! You will not survive! Look at me! Its jealousy is a poison that cannot be treated."

Kindle examines. Medicine check. Looks to Oswen, shakes his head. "It's not something I recognise or damage I can heal." Oswen examines with an arcane eye - 30! - it's not damage, per se. It's a sort of powerful curse. Very powerful. She says, "This probably won't work, this is very powerful, but with your permission, I'll try something..." - but it's not a high level spell, still, it's been effective before... She tries L3 Remove Curse.

It does something. Whatever was kind of 'locking' the damage in place is broken. It *did* break the curse. The damage may be healable - she asks Kindle to try again - he casts Cure Wounds. The brown, ugly water clears... Tinjhorna has never seen anyone stand up to this _thing_ before. "Maybe you are not like the others who have come before you." "I can't speak for others, but for us, our strength comes from the way we work together, as you saw. We are stronger together."

"I am young. Perhaps there are older spirits who will know more than I. But as far as I have known, my entire existence, this realm here has felt like this... It is a place that is beautiful, you can see that, but it is where hope has died. Which is why I seek things of beauty. But like these flowers, beauty is transient. Everything decays. It is strongest, deep in there." He looks to Dukha. "You do not intend to take them there? Surely you will perish! You must not go to the stump. You cannot! I forbid it!"

Oswen holds up a hand and says, "We would never ask such a thing. Besides it sounds like we need seek older spirits first, to understand more about what we face - if indeed we face it. Where might we go?"

"I am a younger guest, really, in this area. This is really another spirit's domain though none have heard from her in a long time. I recall in my birth, I was called into being - let me share with you..."

The watery hands touch the sides of Oswen's head. INT save. Only 13. 9 psychic damage - but she sees what he shares, all the same:

* Nothingness
* Cries saying, "Child! *Child!* Awaken! **Awaken!**"
* Eyes open; a beautiful older female riverine spirit form, but fading rapidly as if being drawn away, "**Do not forget me! Remember to be kind! They do not know what they do... They do not know the power they have, forgive them...**"
* The presence disappears
* Awareness floods in from all directions now
* Cries and screams of anguish and death and dying, an overarching anger and vengeance and jealousy
* Very powerful evil around, *very* powerful

The only beautiful memory he has is that split second at his birth. That was surely Adirohit. He's never been able to speak to her or find her since. He *knows* that this was her realm. There are signs of her history here. But he lives here now. He inhabits - barely - the space left behind.

"There is only one other who you could speak to, but you would need to leave - to rise up - Iravarti. The eldest of the other sisters. But be warned! Iravarti is a true river spirit. A goddess. Do not attempt what you did with me with her! She expects to be treated like a goddess."

Oswen nods and says, "but please remember, I only used this out of ignorance and not disrespect."

"I fear if it looks to see where I am it would be bad for me to be in here. I must go. Thank you for my gifts. I wish you..." - he sighs - "...fortune on your journey."

He reaches out and touches us all; we have Water breathing. Oswen is surprised to see Inafina and Bel have come inside - how long was she "in" that vision? She didn't see them enter.

Oswen says just he departs, "She was right. People often don't know what they're doing. But they can learn. And there *is* hope."

So we're left in the hut.

On everyone's mind: "What now?". Oswen admits that in this instance, she sees little opportunity for redemption of, or talking out of a situation with this - entity, this thing, which seems so evil. The creature it controlled however, the Marid, she's unsure about but thinks - ARC check only 15 - well, she distantly remembers reading something - elementals; the plane of water's version of, well, genies. They can be summoned and compelled. Very powerful. If we could find a way to free it, somehow... Well, at least it probably won't then attack us. But maybe it's already gone; the summoning might have ended.

We could go up. Try to find another riverine. But we don't know how to contact them. If there was a greater certainty, Oswen would go for the knowledge - but time is a factor, and we have no certainty if we go back. We must take a risk. We must press on.

We want Dukha to return to safety. He thinks this area is safe; he'll know when it's getting dangerous; he'll depart then.

A raft must be built. Dukha shows us what wood to find. Oswen, atop Kindle's shoulders, goes searching; ADV survival (Kindle) - only 10! Oh dear. Unfortunately all he finds are thinner branches. Dukha makes the best of it but while he's being polite (!) Inafina uses her wind walking boots to look for larger floating things. Kindle had stuck to land by habit. The buoyant logs aren't so hard to push back towards the group down channels. Her and Bel had been collecting flax to make a kind of binding rope and Bel has continued that work, which means pretty soon we have a serviceable raft, punted down by pole, which will be good enough. It won't take any rapids and needs no sail - there doesn't seem to be any wind anyway - and we get underway. It's taken two hours, and water walk has worn off, but we're now afloat. Inafina has found a second pole, so she can help Dukha navigate. Kindle stays near the middle to keep things balanced!

Bel isn't too much of a fan - his hooves aren't great on the rounded raft logs - so instead he just sits. Oswen sits with him, in front of Kindle. We're like the dots on the "5" side of a d6. Apparently we want to keep away from the centre of channels as the current can be too strong. Stay near the sides. If nothing else, we don't want the water deeper than the poles are long!

About 20 minutes after we depart, the fog thickens - no longer like waterfall mist - and starts to feel cold. The light is poorer. There are more trees, but they seem less healthy. The water flows still, but it's dark and deep in parts. Everything inevitably feels more sinister. This area looks like it used to be a significant river. The original fourth? "Could be" says Dukha "but I'm not enough to know!"

Oswen gets the impression of steep cliffs 100-200ft away on "our side" of this river; boulders and rocks sometimes visible lifting upwards; sounds of occasional distant waterfalls.

Kindle gets tense. "This place feels... Strange. It does not feel right." The rest of us agree. "Give me a moment - I have a bad feeling - I'm going to cast something..." - and he grants Eyes Of Night, giving us all darkvision. Long range, too! He grants Oswen "vigilant blessing" too - she feels more alert, somehow. Oswen asks Dukha if he's close to where he'd leave; "Not yet... I've been through this area once before."

Kindle has cast Detect Evil & Good. He stands and looks around. "That feeling - I thought perhaps it was because there is a desecration here. But there isn't. There's just a... A feeling. Nothing that I can actually 
sense." He's surprised. He was sure he'd see something. So Oswen wonders if it's just a psychological thing or if it's magical. Detect Magic; Arcana 27 - nothing! No magic around. Yet we all feel it. A sense of unease here. She dons the helm and reaches out. Nothing within range either.

Suddenly, a few minutes later, Oswen sees a glow - and **then a strong rush of magic**, *under* the raft. Some 15ft below. It's fast! Like a magical darting fish. Or perhaps a shark. "There's something below!" she calls. "Sea-legs" stances all round. It gets stronger. But it's the *water* - and then, emerging out of the side, trying to push over the raft - two forms of magic. **This is an elemental - a Marid?** - and has been conjured - summoned. Not of this plane. Then, a very strong enchantment school. Something akin to being charmed. Charm, domination, compel; Oswen wants to read the surface thoughts - perhaps it is not a foe - but it's rushing for the raft and there's no time. So she reacts! L4 Banishment, CHA 18 save for the elemental. A visible wave of magic shifts the fog and the group hears Oswen's sudden chant and movements, but it deflects around and has no effect! (21 rolled).

Initiative!

* Bel 19
* Oswen ADV 18
* Kindle 15
* Inafina 13
* Dukha rolls a 1, but will be busy trying to stop the raft capsizing anyway!

Bel wasn't busy steering or casting so it makes sense that'd be jumpy. He lets loose with Psychic Lance. 21 damage, and it takes the hit. It seems stunned - incapacitated - but Bel isn't done. He uses Beguiling Magic, which he can do once a day; an enchantment of sorts; the Marid must DC16 WIS save or be either charmed or frightened for a minute. And it fails with a 15! D6->123 charm, 456 frightened. Charm. He calls out a warning to us; "It's charmed! Don't hit it!"

Oswen notes that it can't really respond to her right now. She uses the Helm and tries to get at surface thoughts, saying, "I'm going to use this helm to talk to you telepathically. It won't harm you. I hope you let me in." Its save matches the DC. She warns the others that it's certainly not "*fully*" charmed!

It wants to be freed. It is under compulsion. It is frustrated. It is coerced.

ARC 20. The magic on it is clever! It's a Wish spell. High level and dangerous to cast. And now she remembers about Marids. They're like genies; people find artefacts or are given boons and summon them, and they must grant three wishes to the summoner. It was tricked; it granted a wish to the bearer which forced *it* to do something outside what it would expect. She's a little surprised! It would be difficult to outwit such a creature. Whatever evil creature we're up against, it's clever. Since she doesn't know what the Wish is, it might not be able to even agree to the casting of Banishment. "Bel - you need to ask it what the wish used against it was! It'll know what you mean!"

She has to wait for it to come out of its incapacitated condition to say more. Kindle is uncertain and holds; he's uneasy; Inafina positions herself on the opposing side of the raft to better brace and hold the raft steady should whatever Oswen is trying to do not work out!

Then there is the moment when the elemental starts to come around and overcome Bel's charm effect, but while it shakes off its incapacitated state, it can't seem to shake the charm just yet. We have a few more seconds. Bel gets persuasive! "Please, noble Marid; I ask of you this one thing - if you can please describe to me - tell me - what this wish is? What is the wording of the wish that was used against you? We want to help; this was clearly an abuse of a wish!" - ADV (due to charm) persuasion 25.

The Marid replies: "It was the third wish. I will tell you all three. The first was to *overwhelm Sagrapoor with a wave*. The second was to *retrieve the insolent pretender and the prize she seeks to steal from me*" (and that's actually said in someone else's voice - and Oswen says in surprise, "That's him, that's the one I heard!") "and the third was to *defend me against all intruders*" - and there's anger. There's no time limit! That was the trick. Bel Arcana 19+3 -> 22 - "We're not intruders! We're not from this plane! We're guests!"

The Marid looks uncertain. "Questionable. But if you take anything that's not yours to take, you would be an intruder. I would have no choice. This compulsion can only be broken by returning to my home plane, or the words of the wish somehow being invalidated by a change of circumstances." Right now the creature is at its home, so the concept of intruder applies. If it moved to another plane, then it would itself sort of be an intruder and the concept would be invalid. Likewise, if it died, there's no "me" anymore.

For now, an uneasy truce.

Oswen asks Dukha, "You've been this way before; is there where even remotely safe to camp, to give us time, before we press on deeper?"

"Possibly... We would have to go to the edge... It is itself dangerous, but less dangerous perhaps tham this."

Oswen nods and says, "I'll take those odds. Thank you..." turns to the Marid and says, "I mean no disrespect, only to help, I understand you are compelled to resist this" - she's about to cast - "It is not my desire to hurt you! It was not my desire to hurt all of those people! It... Is an entirely lost being. Lost and consumed by hatred." And this is the first time Oswen has a doubt about it being irredeemable. "There *is* a history. It was something else once?" "Yes, it was... But it is no longer what it was. One cannot bear such sins as it has and remain innocent." And so, knowing it stands only a low chance, she once again tries L4 Banishment. One last time. But it doesn't work. She sighs and says, "Well, I will keep trying when I can!"

We bid it farewell; it vanishes underwater; the next minute is tense but it doesn't return after the Charm wears off. "So, let's find that 'edge' you were talking about."

Dukha is shaken, but we push on. We come upon some rocks along the side of the once-river. Here, it looks odd, like an earthquake had created chasms and we are in a sunken part. This isn't the edge of the river as there's more water coming down from above, perhaps the river itself split. Dukha is suddenly on high alert and keeps looking, scanning, checking the cliff faces. Inafina asks what we should look for. "We are in the territory of others" he says. "Not down here, but up there."

Orvil flies up. Above the fog line he scans the cliff face with keen hawk eyes. ADV perception, 20+2 -> 22. Behind one of the small waterfalls he spots a cave of some kind, flies in close; but it's a natural cavern. Empty. Big enough to camp in! It's about half way up, some 20ft. The rope can do that. Defensible too. The best we can do is tie up the raft and hope, but the rest of us can get up there without too much trouble. Oswen has to convince Dukha a bit, since he can't see it; but we pull the raft out and tie it in case waters rise, send up the rope of climbing; up we go; and Kindle, once he's done everything he wants to do outside, fills the cavern with his magic Hut. "Now we can't be easily seen or heard by others, but we can still see out."

We don't need to rest a long time. Just an hour or so. Kindle uses a Divine Spark and Oswen's headache is cured (12 healing -> up to full). Oswen recovers a spell. Bel plays a song of rest and inspiration. We feel better. Soon enough, we descend back down the rope and get back onto the water.

Oswen asks about the aforementioned "stump", which Dukha can't go to. Apparently it's at the centre of the place "which only the strongest-willed can reach", there's an island in the middle of "the stagnant heart of this water, where all flows, where it sinks into the ground. Legend has it that there is a stump of the oldest tree in Shankarbhumi on that island." "A stump? It was cut down?" "It was cut down. I've never seen it myself - just stories - we just call it the stump. We might as well give it any other name."

Oswen repeats, "_They do not know what they do... They do not know the power they have_ - is that what she meant? No way to know. Anyway, I think that's where we are headed."

"As we get closer, the fear will overcome you. And you simply cannot go further. Each of us have tried - a rite of passage - a sort of coming of age for my kind. To go as far as you can go. And there's no shame! But we all discover our limits."

Oswen says, "Well, it is not a rite for us and don't be too impressed if we go further because I *definitely* intend to cheat!"

"I cannot. But that is OK!"

"Do you know how long it will be until we get there?"

"We're probably nearing the area where people start to feel the fear. Some of us can go further; others not. I wouldn't consider myself particularly brave. I am no coward either! I probably have another 10-15 minutes or so."

It must be soon. Thinking ahead, Kindle has been laying out a ritual in a cramped corner of the raft to be able to invoke Water Walk again. We can sense the evil soon enough. Bel gives us *all* Bardic inspiration. Oswen casts L*5* Intellect Fortress for Inafina, Bel and Dukha - to help him get home if nothing else - and with Bel's help, we hope that is enough.

* Oswen is struck first. It catches her unaware - 4,7->only 12 - but Bel sees that and throws Countercharm at her; 17->22. Success.
* Dukha also 22. He looks surprised. "This is further than I've gone before... There's something about you - about us..." and Oswen laughs, and says, "See, you *can* cheat after all!"
* Bel 17. Good enough.
* Kindle 20.
* Inafina - 18,20 (!) -> 23.

We push through what can best be described as a *wall* of fear. Dukha and Inafina have slowed a little on the pushing, though. More caution. This area is bad. Trees are partly submerged. No leaves. Reed beds look sickly. More swamp, less mangrove. The water is slowing down too, even though we should be heading to where it all sinks down. Needs much more work on the poles, but it's not deeper, fortunately.

Up ahead the mist clears. It just feels cold and clammy. It's nice to have some visibility.

About ten minutes later, a second wave hits. Stronger this time.

* Oswen 18 - Countercharm *again* - no good - bardic blown, 23
* Dukha 20
* Inafina + bardic, over 20
* Kindle 20
* Bel + bardic, scrapes a pass!

We just scraped through. Dukha is amazed, including at himself. Nobody he knows of has ever made it - and points to an island we can now see. We don't know if that's the last wave, **but there's no time to think about it** - very quickly, a wave starts to rise, pushing us upwards quickly on the raft; a head rises up out of the water, turtle-like, snapping beak; it rises up and then swiftly chomps down!

Kindle is the biggest target; 21 against his 18; it bites, 7 damage; and now we're back in battle. Initiative:

* Bel (nat 20) 23
* Inafina 22
* Oswen (also nat 20) 22
* Kindle 18
* Dukha is barely holding it together now, unsurprisingly; he tries to keep the raft under *some* kind of control

Crazy numbers for initiative. Bel first. Dissonant Whispers L3... 5d6 psychic -> 17, and reacts immediately to get as far away from Bel as it can! It recoils back, and a huge shell breaks out of the water, pushing the raft backwards; the shell must be some 12ft in diameter, almost circular; but then as it pulls back, *four other heads* lift up out of the water. One seems to be trying to get away, the other four writhe in confusion but the whole thing is heading away, gaining some 40ft distance. As it's fleeing he blows another L1 for Beguiling Magic, but finds out that the creature can't be charmed or frightened! He warns us.

Inafina knows this is a very temporary state of affairs so she chases on the wind boots (50ft), standing on the back of the shell and jumps up to attack the same head as Bel with the staff; hits; 9 bludgeoning, plus a charge of 4 lightning; it is effective - and the head is severed! Now to the next head along, pushing off from the first, kicks the next for 13 damage, Stunning Strike, but no effect; another Focus point, two more kicks; 10 and 13 damage each. Another head falls.

Oswen, ARC 24, "Oh! No!" she calls. "It's a hydra! The heads come back, twice over!" - that's why they just sort of fall off. Each one that falls regrows as two, but there may be something it is vulnerable to. Fire is common. So she tries a big Chromatic Orb into the shell, fire damage, hits, 31; the fire explodes away off the shell and it clearly hurts, and now the necks almost look cauterised. They kind of crust over. The necks just writhe. "That does it! Fire!" she calls out.

Kindle gives L4 Moonbeam a shot. Closest he has to fire and he wants to avoid hitting Inafina. The radiant beam blasts down, lighting up almost all of the giant shell. 20 damage potential, but it resists much of that, taking 10.

The hydra turns to attack Inafina. The three heads come in for an attack. One hits, 6 damage. She dodges the next two. Not bad. But the necks look like they're recovering and Inafina shouts a warning. "Needs more fire!" she shouts as watches the Hydra starts to move way; she gets in an opportunity kick to the third head, dealing 11 damage.

Bel casts L3 Cloud of Daggers on the shell. 14 damage.

Inafina hits the third head and repeats her previous attack strategy. 13 damage, despite two staff charges. Another kick, hits but only 8 damage and nat 20 on its con save. A flurry starts on a miss, but ends with a kick and 14 damage. The third head falls. Oswen sees this and fires three scorching rays; all hit but the damage is really low, only 15 (6d6). At least this creature is looking pretty messed up!

Kindle moves the Moonbeam back over. Nat 20 again on the con save! And another 20 potential halving to 10 damage. Ash starts to float up into the moonbeam and there's a terrible shriek; and the last two heads disintegrate upwards as the shell sinks down.

Before Inafina can act, we hear a rasping voice calling.

**"YOU! YOU AWFUL PEOPLE! YOU KILLED MY PET!"**

A creature rises out of the murky water near the island. It's covered in wet, almost rotting clothing, clinging to a gaunt-looking figure; the clothing, what's left of it, looks like a ceremonial champion's clothing. It holds the giant conch. Kindle's Moonbeam lets us clearly see an ornate headdress, but with only wisps of hair left. This creature - male, on appearance - does not seem undead, but seems corrupted; perhaps almost demonic or infernal. Water on the skin starts to boil off in steam as the skin seems to be burning hot. On its face there **is one terrifying eye, that is looking bloodshot and darting around quickly** - that's the source of the fear.

There is no doubt about what this could be - it's the Eye of Vecna.

(End of Part 2.14)
