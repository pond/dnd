# Oswen: Part 2.20
## Campaign day 45
### Baldur's Gate on Vecna's Toril, leaving "The Mark" in outer city, around midday

We've met Jarlaxle and found out a lot, although perhaps little of it is good news!

Once outside, Oswen says - "Unless there are objections, I'd say - Orin's off. We've no idea if the information about those explosives is important or not, or if we could do anything about it either way. And it sounds like the risk is great. We've set in motion a few things to try and help the city, and now the best thing we can do to help it - I *think* - is to focus on ourselves and our plan for tackling Arkhan, and/or Velindra, and entourage."

Suddenly we see people running, down, towards the docks. Orvil flies up but can't see Shed 9 - because a huge wall of water on the docks is blocking his view. Yikes! We didn't want to hurt people (at least, not outside Shed 9). We head in that direction!

Orvil sees clearly what's happening and Oswen relays it. A towering 20ft high wall of water stands above the piers, in a strange, unnatural shape - a static wall of sorts. A frozen wave. It's not isolated to Shed 9 and covers a much larger area but at least it's centred there. It'd take 10-15 minutes to get there so we stop and just observe for a while. The docks area is flooded as the water runs off. Oops.

At least the explosives might be rather damp!

Orvil flies out to investigate more. Meanwhile, it's research-o-clock and we head towards the main gate to gain upper city access. There's a bit of a queue, annoyingly. It's busy, somewhat unusual patterns (insofar as we have any idea of "usual"). Inafina insight 21, a real mixture of feelings - things are heightened, but not for any particular single reason. A lot of impatience. People pushing, quarrelling. She notices many more guards at the gate, trying to control the crowd. Kindle can see that people are going through, but it could take 15-20 minutes at this rate. We resolve to just wait.

Nearer the front there's more pushing forward needed, since there isn't an orderly line. When we finally do speak to someone, it's only to then get put into another actual queue. At the front of *that*, we've ended up waiting half an hour. It turns out that the number of people city are being controlled, and perhaps that's why this has been such a slow process? Certainly "research at the Unrolling Scroll" was taken as "shopping" and we can see that it'd be low priority.

Flaming Fist patrols in groups of 4 abound, patrolling. No doubt *someone* high-up knows that something is going to happen! It's not hard to spot the Scroll, given its height, but the doors are shut and there's a sign on a pedestal: "Apologies, Unrolling Scroll closed to public today" - but Inafina, perception 20+7 -> 27, there are people inside! Is it even locked? Kindle tries it - and it's not locked, although it's very heavy. So he shoves his way in and so do we. Kindle closes the door behind.

The conversations stop and there's the patter of feet!

It turns out they've been told that it might be dangerous, flammable things, etc... OK, so they've heard! We bargain that if we help them unload shelves and stow things away, since it's heavy work, then we'd get to look at a few things (Bel flat persuasion 20). Everything is being taken down to a basement level. Oswen asks if there are any other ways in - not that they know - she shows them the wand of secrets, and says, with their permission, she'll check to make sure. A gnome agrees reluctantly, and there is a strange two-floor-height arrangement with a ramp. It has a rather... One of the librarians had mentioned "dungeons" - or catacombs, from what we see? The basement level has vaulted ceilings, with a stone circular stair in each corner of this large room. Maybe 4x4 of such areas, all connected, 15x15ft. So she makes that in-range. Six hits!

Now there's suspicion. Are *we* the ones who are going to cause trouble? Do they have zone of truth? No... But then an older gnome produces a lizard which he calls **King Julius** and apparently the lizard thinks we're truthful.

Three on the upper level, three on the lower. We start on the upper. An alcove, set into the wall, stone wall. Inafina Perception 21, feels around. One of the stones moves; she tries pushing it. The wall slides back a little then moves to one side... Slowly. And only a bit. It's jammed, basically, but Oswen goes "Ah, the slide-back-and-sideways, a classic move!"

There's a hidden room behind, illuminated by a torch Inafina gets and via Oswen's googles. Oswen steps inside. Sconces on the wall would normally hold torches and there are two beds, old and rotten looking. There's a chest at the end of each bed and a skeleton in a corner! It's propped up against the wall. Investigation 23. The bones are of someone younger, a young adult. Remnants of clothing suggest a librarian. Someone's quarters, but they died in here. Maybe they got stuck because the door shut... The chests are rusted shut, so she borrows a dagger off Oswen and starts levering it open (and Oswen protests, "Hey, that's a +1, be careful!") - clothing, books, personal effects. Both have things in, but there's only one skeleton.

The book in one of the chests looks like a journal so Oswen passes it on, and then we go for the second wand finding on this level. Another alcove. There was a sense of two things here. She says to Inafina, "I think, a door; or a hiding place; and trapped, most likely." With Kindle helping, Inafina perception 19. Another wall stone to press. But this time a flagstone below it that one would naturally stand on if pressing that stone. It stands out because it's not as worn. Oswen investigation 32 (!), a lever system, she can make out glints of metal between gaps of stonework when a torch is moved to and fro. She traces it as best she can, with a degree of intuition and logic involved; a row of a dozen small holes, hard to notice, on either side.

More work with the dagger; gradually lever out the stone. Oswen locks it in place, but does warn the librarians that a professional's eye to remove ammunition or similar would be wise! And then she presses the stone to open the door. This does the moving back thing - but goes a long way and reveals, on one side, a nook - essentially this is a safe; a hiding place. There's a shepherd's sort of staff and a backpack. "Oh my", she says, "this could be for an adventurer?" ARC 22. The staff appears to have a disabled magical ability; it's being suppressed. She figures a good chance of a druidic influence.

As respectfully as she can and in full view of everyone she pulls down the backpack and looks inside. A large, but very rotten piece of cheese! Empty waterskin. Small bag of coins, maybe 10gp total. Half a dozen potions! They look - old. But still magical, but of a different era, somehow. An escape bag; some food, potions (at least 3 are for healing, one is a poison antidote) and so-on. She examines the staff to see if she can figure out its magic. Religion 24; she recognises religious writing of some kind. Ah! A cleric, not a druid. But it's been severed from the deity. "Vecna" she says to the others, "would be my best guess".

Things returned and realising that this means 3 things up here are accounted for, we head to the lower level.

This area is very different. Separate rooms. With metal bars. I mean - yes, definitely a dungeon! Some even have old cots. Oswen's lost her bearings a bit and has to blow another one charge; three strong signals on the remaining secrets. A cell on the left; then a cell on the right; then a space *one foot* in front of her!

Oswen investigates in front - nat 1, nat 1! So that's no good. Inafina and Kindle, perception 16, can't see anything; Bel has a look... No good either... Then Kindle and Inafina notice *something?* - a faint, nearly completely worn-down carved symbol. We start to blow dust away to clean it up and get a better look. "Arcane sigil" says Oswen "which needs a password, or other way to disable it. This is a trap, for sure... Stinking cloud I think! Nasty. And it might be old but the magic is working just fine. But it seems triggered by someone coming from the *other* way - to **catch escapees perhaps?**" - she looks to Bel who says - "...Dispel? Yes! I can take care of this!" - he pulls out his mandolin and casts. The symbol is erased!

OK, that's safe! Left-hand cell. On the way, we note that it's strange how there are no bones, or anything like that; things seem essentially unused. Inafina perception dirty 20; not what she expected - we were thinking maybe a tunnel or something - a few stones are clearly loose behind a cot. So we move the rusty cot and the stones, but it's not a tunnel - just a nook, maybe 2ft by 2ft equivalent (though not square). There are some trinkets and a tiny scrappy notebook, along with a worn-down piece of charcoal. Inafina says "Oh that's quite sad - however it looks now, someone must have been stuck down here for a long time" - and hands the notebook to the "librarians" to examine. They think it's at least 100 years old and veyr fragile, but it's written in Common - Balduran dialect, in fact! - **this used to be an academic prison!**

It's claimed that the people were in possession of banned books. The overseers at the university discovered it; these people were then accused of teaching "forbidden knowledge" and they were sentenced to the prison "under the library" - that last sentence causes confusion; Vecna's Toril... There's even debate about the "university" reference. There's no university at Baldur's Gate.

At long last, the final indication from the wand. Inafina perception 23. The wall stones seem intact. She moves the bed out of the way but it catches on something - on the floor. A stone under the bed can be lifted. People help lift it, but it's heavy. Whoever was in this cell was strong! **Stone steps lead down** under the cell. More than that. She listens carefully and can hear air and wind; the distant sound of trickling water. She looks at Oswen with a twinkle in her eye and says - "ah! Found it. *This* is how they could get in."

Oswen goes down (but the space is small, a tight squeeze for anyone else) - Kindle casts Light on her staff as she descends. A 5ft x 5ft tunnel. It leads one way. It goes down about 6ft, then along but with a slight dip. It's bare rock and earth; this is hand-dug and unsafe. She can see now that the steps were carved into earth. The prisoners probably did find a way to do this; a monumental undertaking! She's curious and proceeds onwards. There's a turn, then the tunnel ends after some 150ft, opening into a larger space. She can hear water trickling beyond - she extends the staff and the light shows what's probably a sewer or other water system. Maybe a storm drain? The tunnel exits at an elevated point. Doesn't smell too bad, but it could go for a long way. There are bats and rats in quite some numbers. It runs side-to-side, so she could turn left or right. Perception 2+1 -> 3! Can't see anything. Survival 3+5 -> 8, no idea which way is which.

The Manifest Mind tome is still available; she hadn't dismissed it; she sends it first of all left, "upstream". Just a trickle, really. There are various grated entrances along the way. There are also signs of things living down here - big nests for example - which isn't too surprising but means she probably shouldn't dwell too long. After about 100ft, the frequency of nests is increasing so she pulls it back to turn right. Some sturges start flitting about the glowing, spectral tome. It meets a very big grate where the water cascades down towards a large stormwater and sewerage system. She investigates further downstream on that main channel - and sees humanoids squatting down here, movement, and she's been noticed; she withdraws and returns to the steps, heads up, and warns people above. Put the stone down, but then put a LOT of heavy boxes of books on top.

Ultimately we group up-top and wonder about the journal and that one skeleton. Some of it seems to be in code, so Oswen takes some time to ritual-cast Comprehend Languages. It's a made-up language, between two siblings. The author was a chaplain of the university chapel; a cleric; *she* was also secretly serving the goddess Silune, but that was forbidden. (Oswen isn't sure if that's Vecna-rewrite or actually the case). So that's what the book was about. Her brother seems to have been a warrior, riding in armies "north of the Black Gate". The tone gets more desperate; "I only have a few more days of food. They say it's for my own safety! But nobody comes to the door when I call. I was going to run away and escape! Everything was planned and  ready, but I need to get out of this damned hole!" Then, later, "I've heard nothing from the other side of the wall for days. I grow weak. Brother, I shall seek you in the next life..."

It sounds like she was put here truly for safety, but something happened to whoever put her here and in the end, she passed away.

Clearly this was once part of a university, but it sounds strict; perhaps that's a Vecna thing, we just don't know. Either way, a very sad story. But nothing more nefarious than that.

Oswen investigation 5+13 -> 18, finds references like "Why don't they understand that I can help? I know the locations of the **arcane sigils** around the upper city that would **raise the wards**! **This is something worshippers of Silune know**. If only they would let us practice openly, we could help defend the city! It seems forgotten by almost everyone else." So Oswen searches the journal to see if the locations are discussed; no, but there are cryptic references in one of the letters and a description that's more straightforward about how to activate wards. It's a strange one, too - "to whom it may concern" - Oswen copies everything carefully. She also looks for the names of these people - that particular letter is signed **Devorah Ungeread**, brother **Rylan**. No surnames, but it's something.

**Shadowheart needs to see this!**

Oswen signs. All the librarians are clustered around. She says out loud, "Once upon a time, there were many gods, such as Silune, Helm, Yondalla" (lists more) - and tells a little Vecna story. But she warns them. This prison. This is where academics can end up. Be cautious. Seek others who have that same feeling. That same memory.

There are looks exchanged. Not all of these people believe in a non-Vecna reality, but there are doubts. Books they find that don't make sense. They have a specific box of such. And, despite some protests, this box is produced.

These books? The archivists here *absolutely* swear that the book *did not exist* the day before they found it. A shelf they knew well, but a book just *appeared* on it. That is how these are found! It's not what Oswen expected - this is unstable, as if the original reality somehow bleeds through in strange ways. Momentary reassertions. Strange side effects.

Oswen mentions that Vi is on her way. She'll send Vi here, if she can. Then one, sheepishly, hands Oswen a pamphlet. It's a Vi pamphlet. She laughs. So they know, at least to an extent!

They agree to help with our investigations (but we keep helping stow away the books the whole time).

The white Abishai - what is *that*?! She's never heard of anything like it. Religion 23; she finds a line of enquiry that might work with the books available on Vecna's version of Toril. She's feeling strangely optimistic. Not for the upcoming fight - that's a nightmare! - but occasionally she laughs and talks almost at random about how surprising it is to find Vecna's control so... Loose.

* Investigation ADV nat 20 + 13! 33. White Abishai are devils, with convoluted rules and laws. Lawful evil. Each used to be a mortal, who somehow won the favour of Tiamat before they died. As a "reward" they're transformed into a hybrid draconic devil to serve her. **Each type is associated with a chromatic colour of dragon** so white - ice - cold resistance and cold-based attacks. But it's also a devil! **Immune to poison and fire - as are all devils**. Resistant to normal weapons, and probably have **some degree of natural magic resistance**. They can see through darkness; implication is that *magical Darkness* don't work against them. Vicious, savage; when someone is made the target of their ire, they strike unusually true and they punish those who would 'dare' strike them. Oh, and of course, **they fly**.

* Barbarian of the dark orders - can't get any information on that.

* Death Priest - unsurprisingly unaffected by necrotic damage or poison. Essentially, consider them undead plus extras! Likely to use a lot of necrotic attacks and life draining, and we're not great with that.

* Minotaurs very strong / hardly and can use **horns in close range to deal devastating attacks**. Keep distance. Of course, this one might be "above average" in unexpected ways.

* Manticores can fly. Weird hybrids of dragon wings, scorpion tales, lion bodies... They love to unleash **spikes from their tails that can fly out in many directions** at once, to attack other flying creatures. They speak to and taunt prey before devouring them - **eating intelligent humanoids** is their favourite (so that worries Oswen - she'd better play dumb, ish!). They can be **reasoned with or bargained** with if offered something better than you as a meal or target! They prize treasure. They will engage in trickery - very cunning.

So if we have to help, and then try to take down whoever is left - which do we choose? We need to help the *weaker* side, so that leaves us with less to deal with. **We will probably have to deal with that on the battlefield**.

At least the time spent at various points amounts to a Short Rest for our party members. Bel plays music, too - heroic inspiration all round.

Before we leave, one of the "librarians" offer to help us find one of the locations on the letter because their hobby is to examine curious architecture in Baldur's Gate and they have an idea where it is. We thank them, but do remind them to get back to the shop as soon as possible, as it might be rough night! It's already around 3pm. "There are four locations I think" he says. He has examined things more and is sure he knows about two of them. He might be able to figure out the rest.

* Oswen - history, 19
* Inafina - perception with inspiration used, 25
* Kindle - survival, 23
* Bel - history, 15

By 4pm, we have found all four locations!

- An easy one; **in The Wide** (the big upper city market) there is a statue of a bald-headed, large man holding a small hamster (!) in his hand. His other hand holds a two-handed sword, tip resting on the ground. He has split armour, a backpack and crossbow and on the seat of the trousers is a rune, with space to trace others with one's hand.

- Fairly easy again; **Ramethyst's Tower** - a big imposing blueish-black stone tower with no visible entrance, West of the Wide, close to the inner gate of Black Dragon gate, the main northern gate of the city. There's a small settlement just outside; a neighbourhood almost, called Black Gate. The Killing Fields are beyond that. One of the stones on the pedestal has a relevant sigil.

- The third one was harder and we worked together to realise we'd seen it before - the **Hall Of Wonders** (the High Hall is North-ish of there). There's an archway of stone and the keystone has the sigil.

- The last was the hardest. **Lady's Hall**, the most south-western section of the upper city and beyond the temple district. Elegant, rounded, white-stone chateau, three stories high. A huge old flowering magnolia tree has a big stone sign with a dedication poem; the sigil is on the back of that.

Once we've dropped off the book guy back at the store, he invites us to come back and see them again sometime to say goodbye properly!

Oswen uses L3 sending to Shadowheart; "We have locations of sigils to Silune which activate protection ward for Upper City. Then others can focus on Lower. Help needed. Meet at Elfsong Tavern!" - the response - "that sounds almost unbelievable; I will head there as soon as I can. Give me 30 minutes!"

We must hurry to Elfsong Tavern. Given the chaos at the gate, we elect to fly on the new carpet. We can hold onto our tokens. We're not sure how legal that is but this is Baldur's Gate - so - shrug. Picking a landing site is tricky. We elect for an alley; Inafina jumps off to check the area. There are some people around but she figures if we look like we belong there, we'll be fine. We are very early; we can have a drink while we wait.

### Around 4pm

Inside the low-ceiling main room we notice the faint, ghostly singing which we don't think we've ever noticed before - but we're usually in a hurry! We get a big round table in the middle, intentionally conspicuous. There are two spare chairs, so Shadowheart will have space and _maybe_ anyone interested in our business might be tempted to try and chat (which could be no bad thing).  4 ciders, 4 silvers. We might do food later.

Oswen keeps an eye out (15) and Inafina an ear out (24). There's certainly an air of worry that's now greater than the anxieties we'd already noticed from our initial post-Vecna arrival and people gossiping about much the same. All ships out are full. Some people know things. That kind of stuff.

Shadowheart arrives and is surprised we're being so open. We figure people already have *some* idea of issues so, sure, why not! Showing drawings of the Sigils and with Bel's help, HIS check 16; she *thinks* it's a "moon shield" (Silune's light is moonlight, after all). Very big though! It protects an area from infernal influences (but only such influences). Anyone already inside wouldn't be affected but anyone outside would be unable to enter. Whoever activated the shield would have to stay inside to maintain it; if Shadowheart did that, she wouldn't be able to come and help us.

Suddenly Inafina sits upright, looking surprised. The owl has contacted her. The owl has Otto - as in, physically! It's injured but escaping rapidly now. The manticore has been slowed, but the Owl is flagging and thinks it won't have time to get back to the city before its form reverts to a figurine. It'll take Otto as far as it can, but land before it turns. He's likely to still be a couple of hours away. It thinks Otto will know to put the owl figurine in his pocket.

"Should I fly towards the northern black dragon gate, or the basilisk gate?" it asks. Inafina asks it to just fly towards the city centre since we'll be flying out ourselves so not constrained by gate positions.

At this, Oswen decides. "We do want you fighting with us. But it seems likely that those creatures are going to attack the city even if we're fighting Arkhan and if any do get past us, there needs to be some protection on the upper city so that guards and fighters can focus on protecting the lower."

We'll take Shadowheart to the upper city and give her a token, quickly show her the locations then carry on. The carpet it a bit overloaded and slow, but Inafina is saving her wind walk boots for after we get Otto and need to come back. It's not that far to go. By about 4:45pm we're there. At the first sigil Shadowheart asks us to wait, so she can activate it and see if they even work! And it does - a strange tendril starts to extend out into the evening sky, loose. Strange. Oswen theorises that they might meet to form a shield.

Do we activate now? No, but we decide to activate three - the tendrils in the sky aren't all that visible, but a full shield would be! - and Shadowheart can lay low and wait for instructions on the last. Oswen gives her one of her pair of the sending stones, so we can let her know that way when we need to activate fully. We realise these strange tendrils aren't very visible in the evening, but will be more obvious after dark.

"Good luck. I guess this is it, isn't it? Everything's coming to a head?"

Oswen just says - "...yes".

"Silune's light shine a path for you and lead you home."

"Thank you. And you too."

### Around 5:15pm

We get on the carpet and leave, best speed, towards our best guess of Otto's flight path. Inafina is able to keep getting in touch with the owl to check on things. Otto is asleep; the owl does its best to describe things around it - but really, it boils down to flying directly at the city without much ambiguity, given the distance. Bel and Oswen try to figure out where Elturel would be, but ADV Survival only 16 but Bel gives her Bardic Inspiration too (suggesting questions for the owl) and that brings it up to 23. Part of the problem being there's no direct road between the two locations and we don't know how much of Otto's pursuit took place on road or on open land. By asking about locations of mountains and projecting back from what we can see ourselves, we thing we're not too far off course.

Once we're underway though, people can rest a bit. Oswen recovers 2x L3 slots, Inafina some focus points, Bel recovers his inspirations and plays a song to inspire us all again for what comes next, while the indomitable Kindle keeps watch.

A little while after that, the owl makes one last contact - its magic is fading and it's setting down Otto. "There's a little hill with a tree nearby. I'll set down near the tree."

"Thank you owl!" says Inafina. "We'll see you soon!"

Oswen sends Orvil ahead to start scouting. It's getting dark which might negate his sharp hawk's eyes, but he spots a small light in the otherwise dark landscape (ADV perception total 21). He flies back to telepathic range with Oswen, we know what's going on and so Inafina changes the carpet's course to follow him. About 10 minutes later, we're close; it's a weak Light spell, illuminating the underside of a tree's branches.

### Some time after 7pm

There he is - Otto, lying on the ground. We come into land as people start to jump off early. "This is the last of my magic!" he says, exhausted and the light goes out. He has the owl statue and gives it back to Inafina. We load him up onto the big carpet and make him comfy. Inafina prepares herself to wind-walk alongside and before we've even started, Otto is fast asleep. Best speed back! Should take a little under 2 hours based on the way out.

As we fly, Kindle casts L5 Greater Restoration on Otto. Our plan is to bring him to Shadowheart with an upper city token and she can look after him from there; he'll be as close to the battlefield as we are, pretty much.

### 9pm

The air of agitation around the city is much stronger - not helped by 3 silver tendrils quite clearly visible from the air. We're a bit worried that if it's a nighttime attack then Arkhan's forces might see this and try to counter it, but this can't be helped; we'll need quick activation.

Shadowheart suggests we get a room nearby in the upper city. Bel deliberately goes with Oswen to find a guard and plead the case - she helps him with Deception - in their foolishness, we have lost our tokens! At least Bel's dress sense and Oswen's new robes make it a compelling case. He rolls 1,19->31 - we pay for two more tokens to that guard (who happens to have tokens... DM fiat!) there and then.

Back with the group, he points at a grand-looking hotel near the Wide and our last sigil. That'll do. **Archduke's Quinta** - looks like an old, grand, converted farmhouse. Inside it's very ostentatious - there's even a fountain in the foyer! Bel pays **for the Grand Suite** - 50gp - leaning into Oswen's "if we're going to be conspicuous, let's be conspicuous!" idea from earlier. Porters help carry the bags and the carpet (!) while Kindle helps Otto.

The grand suite is the whole of the top floor. This one suite is bigger than Roslov's Cottage! It has six beds - two singles in two bedrooms and a king size in a third, which is part of why Bel went for this particular room. Otto and Shadhowhart, Bel and Kindle, Oswen and Inafina pair up.

Shadowheart has to meditate the whole time to hold the sigils up. Otto needs to sleep, so the four us will do our usual watch. It's late but we get room service! Bel wants *all* the trimmings. There's even a big bath.

Before bed Oswen activates the sending stone to Cleggan; "Are you OK? Anything to report?" - "Got some of the explosives, some injured, mainly OK. Some got through though. I don't know. How many words can I" (that's the general vibe).

### 10pm

Watch.

* Oswen ADV perception with Orvil helping (sight) only 12 - nothing.
* Inafina ADV perception 24 (hearing) - does hear three explosions in the distance; nothing too nearby, and we can't do much about it. There's far worse to come if we can't stop the incoming forces.
* Kindle 26 - noting to report.
* Bel 13 - nothing for most of the time...

...but then he hears a knock on the door. He goes and looks, but there's nobody there. He asks the hotel staff and they've not seen anyone either. Shadowheart hasn't heard anything. He searches the room in case it was a ruse to get him out while something was left or taken, but finds nothing.



## Campaign day 46
### 6:30am

(Oswen swaps Prestidigitation for Mage Hand, remembering that she might need to "grab" the sword and move it, and *fairly* sure that however powerful it might be, avoiding direct physical contact should at least help a little bit)

Bel wakes us all. He wants to get "eyes on someone"; he's jumpy, he wants to know where people are. He's more nervous than normal. Kindle asks what's up. "It's been 8 hours! Are they already in the city? Have they had their battle? I heard a knock on the door. There was nobody there. Shadowheart didn't hear anything!"

After some to and fro, and not finding anything visibly, Oswen decides to let it go. We probably need to get moving. We don't know who's doing what. Kindle wants to cast something - he needs something like 20 minutes to cast it - Forbiddance, close teleportation and portals; if he casts it here, it'll protect Shadowheart and perhaps Otto if he stays in defence. That's a good idea.

Oswen weighs up how she might see Arkhan. Messaging Velindra might work, but it'd be hard to get a question that provokes a useful answer. Scrying her wouldn't work as she's surely got good resistance to such things. She doesn't know Arkhan well though she has a picture. He'll have the upper hand on avoiding Scrying, he has the literal Hand too *and* it'd burn a powerful spell first thing in the morning. She wonders how she might approach it, given she knows no names of his "entourage"; ARC 19+13 -> 32. She figures Otto might have some idea. He's still very tired (technically now at least "only" one level of Exhaustion!) - "his two usual lieutenants; the death cleric **Krull** and **Torogar**, the minotaur 'bodyguard'". Apparently the Manticore is called **Chango**. She figures her best chance is Trooper (even though he gets a +5 to the save since she only knows the name!) and casts her spell over the next 10 minutes.

**It works!**

They're camped up. She's a little surprised that they're not on the move. She "looks around" from the static position near Torogar. He's by himself (and very big, some 10ft tall!). Some distance away is another camp; it's littered with ashes and has incense surrounding it. A tortle stands there - looks like the Death Cleric is performing some ritual (and if it involves incense, it's possibly a Divination-like thing). At a slightly elevated position a small distance off is a third camp where one human sits, wearing what look like spoils of war in a way that suggests things worn as trophies, rather than for utility. This is the barbarian. They're not huge, but somehow - not entirely alive?! Held together by magic. Doubtless tougher than they look. Above, she notices **two creatures flying**; one a strange deathly white, leathery with **a trail of frost behind it**; another that carries a rider. That must be Chango and Arkhan. If she'd managed to scry Chango, it would've been quite the win!

Perception is only 8. She doesn't know where they are but it's some distance away from Baldur's Gate, that's for sure. Time passes... Kindle's 20-minute casting is ending. Torogar's doing very little; sharpening axes. She's frustrated; the spell worked but it's not showing anything useful. The human then walks up and speaks Common - "Why are we wasting time?!" - "Don't question the champion. He is preparing for the assault. The gates of the wretched city are within sight. There's just one thing left to resolve. Be patient and sit down. We're waiting for Krull's augury. There's no point charging in unless we know where we are to go."

There's a bit of an argument about mutual distrust! Nothing surprising, really.

Krull has finished. He shuffles up. He uses his staff as a walking stick. It has an array of shrunken heads hanging off it; his eyes are white, as if blind, but he certainly seems to see where he's going.

"**She** has the Eye. She is not in Baldur's gate! She wants the Hand. The lord, Tiamat wants us to take Baldur's Gate."

Torogar grunts. "That is not going to go down well with Arkhan! He will *certainly* go after the Eye first."

Krull responds, "But even *he* would not dare refuse Tiamat's commands."

"But Tiamat hasn't commanded it *yet*. It would be easier for us to take the city with both."

"The augury is unclear. I did not see a clear victory; she will be a formidable foe. There is a chance that this is a foolish diversion."

"Well it's going to be *his* call."

Torogar holds up a horn and blows it a few times, then roars. The creatures flying above start to descend. The Manticore lands; Arkhan walks up.

Oswen gets a good look - even though he's some 50ft away still - because his head turns quickly and looks directly at the sensor. She's not sure she's seen a face anything quite so fearsome before - even at Brimstone Hold.

**"Someone is watching us!"**

She drops the spell, just as she sees Krull starting to cast something. (In the back of her mind, though, she does note that Krull's divination, whatever he asked, returned inconclusive results; there are elements of the future that are in flux).

Inafina is watching. She sees Oswen white as a sheet and she isn't saying anything. "What did you see?" Oswen responds, "I saw Arkhan. And now I'm *really* scared."

A moment later, Kindle's spell is cast. We *feel* the change as its effects spread out. a 200ft square area around here starts to smell of fresh pumpkin spice!

There's a debate about how Arkhan might split his forces and Bel has the same idea as Oswen eventually - make the city a more formidable target, to try and tip the scales in favour of pitting all of his forces to getting the Eye, so that he has the power to take the city. The most visible thing we have is the shield, so we agree to bring it up. Shadowheart and Otto leave immediately, Otto protesting the lack of breakfast!

Oswen rings the room service bell just after they've gone and orders for the six of us - once they're back from activating the shield, they can eat. It'd take 20 minutes but Oswen pays 5gp to persuade them to be faster. We don't care what they get. They'll try...

Outside we hear gasps and noise even through the closed windows; we open them and look - out there, in the pre-dawn, a vast shimmering dome has appeared. It looks like it's made of woven moonlight! It shifts and moves in gentle waves and pulses, like a silver aurora. People are staring and pointing in awe, or fear; Oswen, despite her fear, turns back to her party, eyes full of hope - "And Vecna didn't stop *THAT*, did he?! Ha!"

Kindle says, "But he's going to notice it"

That's the point, at least, for Arkhan. As for Vecna, Oswen says, "Well, I don't think we were going to avoid his attention once things like the Hand and Eye were in use, and, especially, combined; and then if we do destroy them, I can't imagine we'll avoid being seen at -" - and she halts, mid-sentence; a Message.

"What's *this* ridiculous stunt that you're pulling? I know it's you! You dare interfere? I shall have you all raised as marionettes!" - it's Velindra.

Oswen responds, "Arkhan's entourage was being directed to attack city by Tiamat. We are trying to make sure his forces were focused on you, avoiding city damage."

Otto and Shadowheart return with a tray of two different kinds of food that look like they were meant for other rooms. Otto starts to set up Alarm and other protections established in a zone around her. Shadowheart hangs onto the sending stone, in case of emergencies.

At Oswen's request, Otto checks on Vi by sending stone - but she's coming down on river, several hours away, having expected a battle to happen much later in the day.

So it's just the four of us.

We have a rough idea of where we *think* the battle should happen and so unroll the carpet outside the balcony, preparing to leave.

But then Message. Velindra again! "Whatever it is you're planning to do, stay out of my way. If I get even a whiff of your presence at Beacon Hill you're" - and it's cut off mid-rant. Oswen chooses to not reply! She says to her party, "Oh, somewhere called Beacon Hill apparently!" - and Bel runs out to find a concierge for help. Apparently, it's the ruins of an old windmill, a cemetery and a collapsed community hall where everyone inside died in a fire (!).

Upstairs, we wish the other two well and get on board the carpet. We grab some food hastily from the breakfast buffet, get carefully aboard - Otto says, "Good luck to you" - and says something curious, an short, old adage of some kind - amounting to Bardic Inspiration for all of us. D12, lasts for an hour. We lift off and start heading out and climbing. The air is quickly clear of 'pumpkin spice' smell and then we eventually pass through the dome too, which kind of ripples and flows around us.

Oswen asks Orvil to head up and says to him - "they have a lot of air support. I think we'll need it too. But it'll be dangerous - I don't know what they can do and they might actually be able to, you know, get rid of you forever, if you know what I mean? So it's your choice."

WIS save 3+2. Orvil responds, "Fortune favours the bold!" and soars upwards.

It's easy to spot the windmill on the distant hill with his eyes, even in the early dawn. There's a small community north of the gate, that's not covered by the silver dome; the latter covers *most* of the inner city, but there's an unprotected western area too. It looks like it follows some original city plan based on walls that it seems to track near the base.

There are huge crowds of people at various gates between lower and upper city. Things must be pretty bad down there. Oswen uses her stone to Cleggan, seeing that. "Get to safety, if you can. It's starting."

He responds. "Yes, we figured! Nine Fingers and crew are smuggling people into the upper city via tunnels."

Oswen reasons that Velindra might be in front of that windmill, on the hill, watching for Arkhan's forces. She's unlikely to waste perceptive powers on things coming from the city. So she asks Inafina to now come in very low, trying for a straight line course that keeps us in the "shadow" of that hill and windmill.

It happens so quickly, in terms of perceived time; we're suddenly only a few hundred feet away. Kindle holds his holy symbol and asks for Yondalla's embrace "to shield us from view" - and a strange sphere of twilight emanates out, helping to hide the party in dim light for a short period. The low dawn sun means this area is in shadow anyway. We all gain temp HP too - 13 each - even Orvil.

### The battle

Oswen wants to be positive. She needs to be. But she still can't help but be afraid and uncertain - **we are *so* underpowered**...

Initiative:

* Kindle 23
* Orvil 23
* Inafina 15
* Oswen ADV from Kindle 15
* Bel 6

...Kindle also casts L4 Aid. Max HP goes up by 15 for Oswen, Bel and Inafina. Oswen can see Kindle is spending time helping us out, but she's worried for *him*. In that chest is the sword. And she blurts out, at the thought, "dammit, we have to figure out how and when we bear the sword - the minute we do, they're going to know and *it* will sense the Hand and Eye I'm sure; we'd better wait until Velindra or Arkhan fall but be ready to activate that tiny chest quickly."

She also mentions to Kindle that once the sword is in his grasp, it'll try to take him over - and he's got to lean into it; tell the sword that *yes*, we are going to destroy the Eye and Hand together, take any help the sword can give.

Oswen asked Orvil to fly ahead at full speed. This takes him out of telepathic range, but he is scared and keeps just inside. He can see over the far corner of the ruined windmill - Velindra has moved up onto an adjacent mound and is casting something. She's moved into view of the opposing party, already quite close; Arkhan jumps upon the Manticore and the group start to move. **And they're all there** - Oswen says, "It worked! They're all here!"

Ground in the area around Velindra starts to rumble and shudder - and then swarms of bones start to rise up out of the ground. Cairns that formed gravestones begin to tumble away down the hill, as each cairn reveals a swarm of a dozen or so skeletons.

The human barbarian - bloodless frenzy - starts charging up the hill towards VS.

The carpet continues moving forward, 30ft turn by turn... Normally we're quite happy with its progress but this time certainly feels painfully slow! Oswen witnesses *extraordinary* speed. They seem shrouded in spirits, with strange headless spectral riders charging alongside it as it races upwards, as if they were a commander of a small battalion.

The carpet is keeping altitude, close to the ground but moving up to a broken-down wall around the windmill region.

Torogar dashes up after the barbarian. Oswen sees him also enter some kind of barbarian-like rage, lowering his giant horns and smashing into a skeletal swarm, hitting for 19 damage.

Arkhan and Chango take flight. Chango reaches as far as the barbarian where Arkhan jumps off; Chango then peels away and flies up higher. Arkhan calls to Velindra - **"That is mine! I demand it for my mistress. You can fight me for it - as I imagine you probably will! - but know it is only a matter of time before I unite the Eye with the Hand. You don't have to lose your head!"**

He swings his battleaxe to point; "Skeletons. How quaint! You sad little lich. You should know your enemy before you face them. Has your master taught you nothing?" - and just like that he wrestles control of one of the swarms from Velindra and continues running forwards, with a swarm added to his entourage.

Oswen almost feels sorry for Velindra at this point - all alone, facing *that* group.

Inafina leaps off the carpet and runs down to the ground, speeding along until crouching behind a crumbling wall. Afraid her ears will give her away, perception 10, she can't see much. She runs forward, crouching down, towards another wall - but as she hops over, she finds herself face to face with a mound of skeletons - but they are not yet animated. She realises the crumbling walls around her are from the burned hall! She promptly hops back and peers around a corner, trying to see what's happening. Stealth 24. Good hiding.

Oswen drops to the ground, cursing as Inafina runs off, saying to the others, "follow your heart but don't get seen!" and runs to the back of the windmill, then to the South corner. There's Inafina, crouched behind the wall - and in full view beyond the small dip, on the next hill, Velindra! Oswen starts to run for cover behind the same wall as Inafina.

Velindra sees things advancing towards her. She is a cautious person; she didn't live all these years by behaving foolishly. But then she laughs at Arkhan. "Really? Are we going to waste time on children's toys?!" - she moves to get in range and casts Dominate Monster on Chango! "Little pet" she says, "it's time to bite the hand that fed you!" - Chango reacts and pounces on Arkhan! But Velindra's vocal warning was enough to give him the upper hand. Claws bounce off armour. Through Orvil, Oswen recognises dragon scale armour, but she's not sure which kind.

Krull is hurrying as best he can - it's almost comic, an old tortle shuffling along as fast as he can breathlessly, almost *levering* himself along with the walking stick. But it would be a mistake to underestimate this individual based on appearances! He starts to cast; strange spiritual energy is drawn in, looking extraplanar, until soon he's surrounded by deathly spirits, wailing and screaming in torment.

Velindra moves her various swarms, four of them reaching an attack position. What they have in numbers, they lack in competence. Two hits for Velindra (on Arkhan and the barbarian) and one for Arkhan's swarm (to another swarm). The raging barbarian is not hurt as much as the hit would suggest. Arkhan seems surprised at the blow, though again, it really doesn't do much at all, same as the barbarian.

The White Abishai targets Velindra and flies forward and downwards, quickly, closing some 2/3 of the range but not being close enough to attack.

Bel speaks to the carpet, hoping it'll listen to him - "drop off Kindle until we call for you!" - then jumps down, chasing after the other two and ending up next to Oswen, asking why we're running into the fight - she says, "We're hiding behind a wall!"; a moment later Kindle follows suit, while the carpet drifts towards the ruined windmill before stopping behind it. Kindle's darkness fades as he crouches down near Bel and Oswen.

Orvil flies up to the highest intact point on the windmill and settles down on an eave. There's an entrance on the ground floor that Oswen sees as he does that. He provides an alternative viewpoint, closer to her perspective. She can see all the skeletal remains now.

The barbarian swings his greataxe in circles around his head and uses Frenzied Rush, calling out in Infernal. His headless spirits reappear and assist with movement of various allies he has within 30ft. This carries the Abershai and Torogar (smashing through the skeletons) close to Velindra. Arkhan likewise. The barbarian runs right up to Velindra and attacks. Oswen thinks she's surprised by the sudden onrush of aggressors. All three of the barbarian's attacks would hit; after the first she raises a shield and the next two miss. 8 slashing damage, 7 thunder. She reaches forward and uses Paralysing Touch... But (critically) misses.

The carpet flattens itself against the windmill walls and peers around the southern corner!

Torogar moves away from a skeletal swarm, which gets a nat 20 for opp attack (a second swarm misses despite a nat 16). Only 11 damage halved to 5 though. Now Torogar attacks Velindra. All three attacks hit. Oswen starts getting worried - Velindra seems completely outclassed; could it be that our plan to have Arkhan's forces whittled down might be foolhardy? We might need to burn resources helping her, if only to keep Arkhan up longer. Velindra takes 24 and 20 damage but at least she seems unfazed by from the horns (she seems immune to non-magical damage). She holds concentration on Chango and gets him to attack the White Abishai next. An opportunity attack provoked by that moment misses, then Chango rends in the air at the Abishai 3 times; two misses, one hit, but seems to only take half damage.

Arkhan yells, "Get out of my way!" to the two raging individuals in front of him, pushing aside the bloodless frenzy, moving in next to Torogar. He raises his axe and calls to Tiamat. As he smashes it down, he calls on divinity and Oswen is sure that despite his nature, *radiant* damage would have hit Velindra, but the first hit misses; she misjudges her dodge, though and his next hit crits. But then - Velindra vanishes! It's as if she's burst and disappeared. Oswen is *sure* she hasn't been taken down, but still gasps out loud initially. It's only when Arkhan takes a few wild swings into the space where she was that Oswen's confidence grows. Arcana 25. It's two spells. One was triggered as a contingency by a bad hit. The other is akin to Misty Step (Shadow Step, technically).

So now there's a battlefield full of them - and there's us. And they're looking around trying to spot someone and we're *not* all that well hidden... _Argh, by the nine hells!_

Inafina's about to advance to see more when Oswen calls in a loud whisper, "no, we must hold!" - but she hears (perception 21) a rattle of bones. Velindra is close, amongst the bones in the collapsed hall - and the piles of bones are all rising around her. She starts to move backwards, signalling furiously with her hand - move back, move back!

Oswen has to gamble. Velindra seems to be getting her ass kicked. She moves up to the outside wall of the collapsed hall; prepares scorching ray; if anyone but Arkhan is heading her way within 120ft then she'll fire. L2 spent.

Velindra stands, emerging from amongst her rising skeletons. Anger clouds her face. "Ridiculous!" she declares and walks forward, to a gap in the outer wall that sits in ragged, broken form around the windmill and ruined hall. A fireball bursts forth from her outstretched hand, exploding violently amongst the enemy forces - and her own skeletons, too. It's centred on Arkhan but as the dissipates we can see his paladin aura has protected those closer to him... Everyone in the area make their saves! The quite high 37 damage doesn't work so well as a result, and of course Arkhan is resistant to fire; the Abishai seems *totally* unaffected. The others take *some* damage but it's clear they've dodged the worst.

Still concentrating on her skeletons, she commands them - "Do something useful!"

Krull dashes forward (for some value of "dash"), but this is enough to get his spirit guardians in range of some of the skeletons. It's necrotic damage and Oswen is surprised to see it having an effect - she'd have assumed at least some degree of resistance. These old, rotting remains seem to *age*, as if rotting all the more, with whatever force it is that animates them being sapped (by 3d8->13).

A skeletal swarm advances towards Krull, dodging some of the guardians (6 damage) and attacking. The rest cluster around various members of Arkhan's currently quite tightly-clustered other party members, making various attacks with mixed success. Torogar is particularly hardy. The Bloodless Frenzy takes a hit and gets grappled, which is *something*; and now the recently-raised groups from the ruined hall dash towards the fray.

The White Abishai flies up and tries to take down the dominated Chango, recklessly clawing, biting and slashing with the longsword, recklessly. Surprisingly Chango dodges the sword entirely, but succumbs to the other attacks, taking 16 damage.

Bel doesn't know what to do. He asks Oswen; briefly we consider helping Velindra but it's too soon, she's not looking bloodied yet; so Oswen suggests - defensive position, keep yourself hidden. Bel sneaks to the corner of the town hall wall that Inafina was once at, the Southern edge, with a direct line of sight to Velindra. If she stays in range, he'll be able to act. But if she stays in range, she'll be drawing Arkhan's forces *very* close.

A Ray of Frost (via a Legendary Action) streaks out from Velindra's fingers, hitting Arkhan; but the damage is tiny, 4d8->2/2/2/1. Arkhan takes the full 7 damage. At least we can take note of that. Now Velindra is starting to curse. The four of us can all now tell that this is *not* going how she wanted, but that's bad for us too.

Kindle frets. He could heal her, but it'd be obvious. He asks Oswen - should he? And Oswen isn't sure, but thinks maybe Velindra *is now* at a point where she might realise she must take any help she can get. He whispers - "Yondalla has your back" and, standing in a place where she could see him, he heals her for 15 points. She spins around, "What?!" - sees him - he puts his finger to his lips, "Shush!" and hides!

Hidden away, he uses his ring to start creating balls of lightning, hidden behind the wall, ready to use.

Oswen starts to think of a *really* crazy plan. Could she persuade Velindra to actually give up the eye? Does she even have the ability to do so, given its terrible influence?

Orvil sees Velindra consider *something*, but then she turns back and throws another Ray of Frost, hitting Arkhan - but this time with more impact. 23 damage. It hits on his Vecna Hand arm, which is muscular but starting to wither especially near where Vecna's hand is attached; and it withers visibly more, as if the Hand wants to avoid damage and transfers it to Arkhan instead.

Orvil suddenly takes flight, streaking out across towards the mound where Arkhan's forces are gathered, but tracking north somewhat. He's trying to fly as if startled, but thinks back to Oswen as he dashes out - "I will stay close enough to distract them, if I find the chance".

The grappled barbarian breaks free by swinging his axe around in wild circles, scattering bones all around. Then he uses his spectral charge again, even helping Krull advance this time. Arkhan seems a bit sluggish - Oswen remembers something about the Ray of Frost slowing people down. Velindra must've noticed too, sending out another, this time (just) hitting Torogar. He's slowed, but at the last moment tries to dash up and gore her. He might be slowed, but he's fast *enough* to get to her and his sheer size gives him plenty of momentum. Velindra is caught off-guard and speared, but it doesn't seem to hurt her *at all!*

The sudden rush forwards is enough to scare Oswen into firing off her prepared rays of fire. All three streak at Torogar and all three hit. He does seem to take the damage, even though it's less than Oswen might have hoped (6d6 -> 15).

Chango flies *upwards* sharply, twists around and fires tail spikes at Krull... Yet all three miss.

A visible aura (an aura of hate) starts to emanate out from Arkhan. "Take her down!" he hisses at his assembled forces, then slowly moves forward. Orvil (perception ADV 19) notices that he seems to try to reach for a javelin, but the shrivelled hand suddenly jerks, as if fighting him; and instead, it points to Velindra and fires Finger Of Death. She resists the worst, taking only half of the 7d8 + 30 (!) -> 60 halved to 30 -> she's resistant to necrotic though, so only 15 taken. She winces and then laughs. "You think the Finger of Death on a lich would do anything?"

(Orvil-Oswen's thought is - no, *he* didn't, but for some reason, the hand did).

Arkhan's not done. He grabs his axe and activates some kind of divine magic (a smite) in preparation for his next move.

Inafina leaps over a wall to get close enough for Radiant Sun Bolt against Torogar; she hits twice, for 25 radiant damage total. She holds back from burning focus points right now, hopping back behind the wall again.

Velindra calls over her shoulder, "I *don't* need help" to which Oswen surprisingly calmly says to her now-nearby group, "Well, you heard the lady..." and readies Firebolt, but will only use that if someone starts to come at her specifically; and she brings up the Manifest Mind. She thinks to Orvil - "thanks, but keep safe unless it's needed!" - says to the group, "we should change position" - and jumps over the wall. She can't make it across to the ruins of the old hall's fireplace, so instead ducks into the windmill for a while. It looks like a keep in here! The windows are more like arrow slits. There's a ladder up to the next floor. "Maybe in here?!" she calls, while peering out around the edge of the doorway to try and keep an eye on things from her perspective in addition to the Manifest Mind and Orvil.

Velindra is toe-to-toe with Torogar. "Get out of my way you brute!" she says; "Why don't you just **die**" - with Power World Kill. Torogar freezes in his tracks, eyes wide - and keeps over backwards with a heavy thud. Velindra strides back into the main area between the hall ruins and the broken-down outer wall. The battle inches ever closer to our party!

The barbarian yells out, "Torogar's down!" - Krull responds, "I'm too far away. You'll have to deal with him!" - then strides into the midst of a group of skeleton swarms, to start tearing them apart with his spirit aura. Three of four groups resist the worst of 13 points of damage, taking only 6. Then Krull starts swinging a big maul around, 17 bludgeoning - but this seems especially effective, doubling to 34 - and 8 necrotic.

One swarm is swept away. But the remainder now act (though this means they have another round of saves against the spirit guardians; all three succeed, but still take 6 more damage each). They crowd in on Krull. Another comes in too, taking 13 damage in the process. But combined they deal 38 damage back to Krull. Various hits on other enemies do some damage; it's not a lot, but it's not nothing either.

The White Abishai is now finally in range of Velindra and tries its three attacks. The bite misses, claw crits, sword misses too; but the claw has no magic and the scratches don't harm her.

Bel runs inside the windmill; "Are we going upstairs?!" Oswen thinks - "Uh, yes?!" - and Bel dashes up. Much the same then happens with Kindle - "Oswen, where are we going?" - she shrugs and points upstairs, but Kindle realises she's not sure and stays down - "Don't I need to be here for - ...later?" - she nods.

Orvil has got the memo that Velindra is telling us to keep out of it and Oswen is complying, so he starts flying in a tight circle to hold position.

The bloodless frenzy barbarian starts slashing away at the skeleton swarms. He hits two, but that doesn't seem to harm them much; there are loud booms of thunder with each hit, though, and *that* does have an impact, scattering and cracking the bones (15 damage taken by two). To try and free people from being surrounded, he once again activates his charge. Arkhan makes it next to Torogar.

Inafina signals to the carpet that it should move around to a more hidden side of the windmill and get below a window up there.

Chango is still Velindra's control and fires three more tail spikes at the bloodless frenzy. This time, all three hit. 24 -> 12 (due to raging) damage.

Arkhan holds onto his smite; he reaches forward and touches Torogar - he casts Revivify. Torogar breathes again. "Krull! He's up but injured!" he shouts. Turning to Velindra, he says, "You can't take us down *that* easily. The Dark Order never fails! **BY TIAMAT!**"

Velindra is in close range with the White Abishai. She decides to not withdraw and instead fires a Ray of Frost at Torogar - taking him right back down again. This time he's unconscious, not dead.

Inafina runs inside as Oswen's saying, "We can use this to stay hidden, upstairs maybe better vantage point, Bel's up there" - as Oswen pops the Manifest Mind outside and Kindle moves away from the doorway to be better hidden. Upstairs, Inafina points out the just-outside carpet to Bel and sticks her head (carefully) out of the southern window to keep an eye on the battlefield.

Velindra meanwhile has dropped her illusion. No longer an ageless, elegant elven lady, she's instead a horrifying necrotic husk, held together with sinew alone. She casts a Frightening Gaze upon the Abishia. WIS save; ADV; but it fails. It's bizarre - a devil is now frightened of lich. It cowers away, starting to flee. She now decides, curiously, that Magic Missile is just the trick. Three of the missiles fly at Torogar, which takes him from unconscious to once again dead; one goes to Arkhan. Now she moves further away and back, increasing distance again.

Curiously, her magical illusion of self reasserts; Oswen isn't sure why she bothered with that; she instructs the skeletal swarms to focus on Krull.

Krull is getting grumpy. "Enough of this!" he says and utters a demonic / Profane word, one of destruction, which bursts out in a 30ft radius to target all of the skeleton swarms and even Chango (but not any of his allies).

* None are below 20hp - not insta-dead
* Some are below 30hp - blinded, deafened and stunned for an hour
* More are below 40hp - they're all blinded for 10 minutes
* Chango and one other (hitherto undamaged) swarm are unaffected

As Krull moves away, blinded opportunity attacks all fail except one, by pure chance, which hits for 5 damage. He moves to a new area and causes more damage from his spirit guardians; 3d8->10 necrotic, with most groups doing OK on saves (5 damage) and the previously-unaffected swarm taking a full 10.

The nearby swarms start to move into engulf. There are so many of them that several hits are inevitable; 3 hits and (from the unblinded swarm) one crit. 30 damage - it's enough to make Krull lose concentration on his Spirit Guardians. Arkhan's controlled swarm doesn't get any hits on other swarms in pursuit.

The White Abishai is still fleeing from Velindra! "What are you doing, you coward?!" yells Arkhan.

Bel asks, "What do I do? Get on the carpet? Go to the window?!" - and Inafina says, "Stay calm, wait for Oswen's word. The carpet's there in case something comes for us and we need to run." So Bel moves to the Eastern window and gets a good look out at the mess of skeletons piled up!

Things look cautiously optimistic when Kindle is asking Oswen what's going on. Even with Orvil in the sky, it looks like Torogar is down, the White Abishai is fleeing and the rest is just a mess of skeletons plus Arkhan. She asks Orvil to keep circling.

The barbarian starts attacking the swarms. It hits every time, 14 effective damage. It's making an impact but there are still a lot up. Chango meanwhile goes for Krull too, with tail spikes; 14 more damage total from 2 hits. He's pretty messed up.

Velindra sends a Ray Of Frost at Arkhan, hitting for 20 damage. Arkhan decides to give up on Torogar and give chase to Velindra, but he's been slowed by the ray. He comes running, smashing through the outer wall; as he closes, he reaches back and starts throwing javelins. He's *fast*, three streaking towards her. The first misses, one hits, and the third is deflected by a shield that she throws up. She pulls the second javelin out as if it's nothing. **Oswen finally gets it. Not magical - no damage!**

(Oswen whispers to Kindle - "it's strange, they're both very strong casters but they're holding something back - they've done a couple of big things, but not what I expected.")

She tries to throw another Ray at Arkhan, hoping to slow him further, but he dodges it this time.

Upstairs, Inafina sees that Velindra and Arkhan are starting to move beyond the Northern wall of the windmill - "they'll see the carpet if we don't move, and we'll be stuck here!" - so she runs over and jumps out onto it. Bel agrees he'll follow. Oswen stays put, using the Manifest Mind and Orvil to keep a close eye on the other two.

Velindra tries to take a risk. Arkhan is separated a distance from his forces. "Very foolish of you; thank you for bringing it to me" she says and steps right up into Arkhan's face. She uses Power Word Stun - and it works. In Oswen's mind she hears a frantic Orvil, "Are you seeing this?!" as Velindra draws a wicked dagger; "Is she going to take the hand already?" while Velindra shouts out to her skeletons, "Don't let them move! Not an inch!"

A cold fear grips Oswen at the possibility that **Velinda never intended to kill Arkhan unless she had to**.

She might have the hand while not particularly injured *and* we'd have Arkhan still fighting, too. With or without that Hand he's a formidable foe. Most of his allies, too!

Krull can see Arkhan frozen in the distance; he realises something's very wrong and wonders what he can do; his magic is powerful against the living, but only now does he realise that it's *not that great against the (un)dead*. He's besieged by the skeletons, who've managed to injure him continuously through sheer numbers. He looks up at Chango; "I'm sorry, but... We need to break you free. And to break you free, I have to do this..." - he casts Blight.

Chango saves against the worst, but takes 8d8 -> a surprisingly low 26 necrotic, halved to 13.

The skeletons continue their assault but their blindness means only three of many blows hit. Krull takes 15 more damage, very badly injured now, but still standing. Meanwhile, the White Abishai is nowhere to be seen!

Bel jumps onto the carpet - "Where are we going?" "Round the back!" says Inafina.

Kindle is agitated and asking Oswen what we do next; Oswen says, "we have little choice - I just can't believe it's as simple as *cutting off* the hand - we were told the bearer must be dead - so I don't want to jump the gun. It's difficult; I don't know if I'm right; but we must hold fast, and avoid detection if we can by Arkhan's forces to the last possible second."

In the end, after a bit more to-and-fro - best we can do is keep the skeletons up. No matter what, we need Arkhan's entourage weakened as far as possible. So, Kindle runs out of the windmill! He casts Healing Word on one of the swarms - but nothing happens... And he runs back in. Oswen consoles him - "don't worry, we had to try!" - but he'd been pretty loud; nat 1 on stealth, but with Heroic blown, 13, plus bardic 8 - a solid 21 - Arkhan is close by but stunned; Velindra is too absorbed in what she's doing.

Orvil sees the carpet flying around the windmill and unsure if he should hold position, continues to circle but gets closer to Arkhan and Velindra. The Bloodless Frenzy barbarian has realised Krull is in trouble and knows he should help. He grabs Krull and pulls him as far as he can out of the swarms, dropping Krull when he gets alongside Torogar's body (bonus action of Escape -> no opportunity attacks from the skeletons).

The carpet moves to near the South-East corner of the second floor windmill roof.

Chango continues attacking Krull, based on Velindra's prior instructions. This time he flies in and attacks directly. Only one hit - Krull's shell is hardy. But it's enough; 6 slashing damage takes Krull down (unconscious).

Arkhan tries to shake off the stun; CON save, DC 20; but he *cannot* shake the influence of Power Word Stun! Velindra starts to laugh...

Inafina says, "I'll be right back!" and jumps up off the carpet, runs across the flat top roof of the windmill; perception 18; Velindra is laughing, Arkhan is unmoving - stunned - and Velindra wields a blade. She makes a snap decision - they're both going to hate us, since we're fighting whoever wins, so what does it matter anymore so long as they keep fighting each other? - and throws a Radiant Sunbolt at Velindra. CRIT! Oh dear...! 15 radiant damage. She hopes it's going to distract a bit - and she runs back, jumping down to the carpet, to keep out of sight.

Oswen from around the corner of the door sees something hit Velindra; and just as she's about to act, Velindra, angry, looks around, reaches out to Arkhan and uses Paralysing Touch - trying to double up - and he's stunned, so he can't do anything. It's equivalent to a crit, dealing 19 Cold damage; and he fails to save against the paralysing effect, too. ARCANA 23, that was Inafina's magic she saw hitting Velindra and she works it out.

She says to Kindle - "we have to keep them fighting, by helping whoever is worst off, and I think that's Arkhan right now!" - but she has nothing which can directly help; so she instead takes a leaf out of Velindra's own book and steps out to get a line of sight, casting Blindness/Deafness (for Blindness) on Velindra, CON 20 save. But Velindra saves, and just seems irritated more than anything else. "What *are* you up to?!" she calls out, apparently struggling with deciding between punishing us or carrying on! Oswen ducks back into the doorway, watching through Orvil's eyes.

Velindra sends a Ray Of Frost to the bloodless frenzy (for whatever reason!) - but it misses.

Then she decides to focus on what she's doing - the Eye is speaking to her - to unite with the Hand. She hacks away at Arkhan's arm with her blade! Oswen would rather have not seen *that* but we have to know. Rolls - it's taking a while - she's stuck at the bone, ugh; she *yanks* the hand off instead!

We hear a strange "foom", a necrotic pulse of energy that shoots out, as Arkhan separates from the hand. He collapses to the ground.

**Velindra now has the hand!**

She starts to run, heading towards the Northern wall. Now only Orvil knows where she is (and so, Oswen and so, Kindle). **And this breaks everything we've been told; it is entirely possible to take the Hand from someone without killing them first.**

(Krull - death saving throw)

Velindra now tells the skeletons to swarm *anyone* left that they can see, to cover her retreat. She tells Chango, "Find the rabbit!". A skeleton swarms start to engulf Arkhan (24 damage -> 12 from armour, now looks Bloodied). Others surround the Frenzy (but he ends up with only 1 point of damage). The one swarm he was holding onto has had no new instructions and just keeps fighting other skeletons.

The Abishai can't see Velindra anymore, but fails to escape its fear of her.

Inafina says to Bel, on the carpet, "Oh no - she's sent Chango after me! It's looking for the rabbit!" and Bel says, "...I could disguise you!" - he casts L3 Major Image and creates a copy of Inafina, which makes it look like she's running around down in the "courtyard" area out of Velindra's line of sight, darting around as if looking and listening. From the air, Chango should see that clearly. "That's great! Thank you!" she says. "I think we should get down to help the others? It sounds like the swarms might go after them too!" - Bel moves to tuck the carpet in behind the windmill again.

Bel (via perception 20) did notice earlier that his Bardic Inspiration had been used when Kindle tried to heal the skeletons and throws another one Kindle's way.

Oswen didn't get the memo and is horrified to see Inafina suddenly just outside; Kindle too. But then - Arcana 26 - she realises it's magic and tells Kindle. As for what we do; we can't use the sword yet, Velindra's *carrying* the hand not bearing it; and the skeletons are coming for us - so we have to get out of there and try to pursue.

He tries to reason with her - "Velindra! Stop! What are you doing? This is a *bad idea!*"

"Ha! No. This is my destiny!" she retorts.

"I can't - I can't let you do this... I'm sorry... I can't!" - he intends to cast Silence over a wide area, with himself just inside the edge of it, Velindra a short way within. Then he'll retreat a short distance, so he's just outside. Velindra uses Counterspell. CON save for Kindle, +2, against her DC. He gets 15+2 -> 17. Not enough, but the Bardic takes it to 24. The spell sticks.

He calls out, "I've got Silence on her, but I don't know if this is a good or a bad idea! She'll escape it soon and then who knows where she'll go!"

Orvil sees Velindra cursing at Kindle; he sees Arkhan swarmed by skeletons and prone, so doesn't know if Arkhan is still stunned or otherwise able to act; he hears Kindle saying Velindra might escape soon. Perhaps he can keep the Hand in play and stop her running. Get her attention.

He flies in and tries to grab - 18 unarmed attack, that works as a Hit and she's cast Silence. He grabs the Hand in his claws and tries to fly away, but she swipes at him with the blood-soaked dagger she used to cut Arkhan. She rolls 13, matching his AC, injuring him for 7 slashing damage and 5 necrotic. But he had temp HP - and has two left, which is twice as much as he normally would have!

To Velindra's shock, Orvil grabs the hand, takes the hit - a strange spectral armour, smelling of pumpkin space, shreds away leaving him intact. And he flies back towards Kindle, carking loudly - in Oswen's head, she hears, "CATCH IT! KEEP IT FROM HER! DON'T LET HER RUN!" - but Kindle just hears screeching. But he holds it for now, as he doesn't know if Kindle understands.

In Orvil's mind, now, he thinks to Oswen - "if this is it, thanks for everything...", expecting immediate retaliation from Velindra. But Silence is a surprisingly powerful spell, depending on the spellcaster and in Velindra's case, she's almost powerless!

Meanwhile, the Bloodless Frenzy barbarian is somehow still up. Wildly picking up and wielding Krull's mall, he swings it in great circles, recklessly swiping at all of the skeletons around in huge, wide arcs. And it works - he takes down almost all of them. "I'm sorry my comrade; only the strong survive" he says and runs up towards Arkhan. He treats Arkhan's commandeered swarm as an ally and draws it along; he moves to defend Arkhan from the others around.

The flying carpet drops Bel and Inafina down by the Western wall of the windmill, about mid-way.

Chango flies into attack the Inafina illusion! Three tail spikes fly out. Two miss, but one is a direct hit - yet it goes straight through the illusion. He realises that it's a trick. Chango tries to tell Velindra, but she's inside the Silence sphere.

Arkhan is still trying to shrug off the stun *and* the paralysis - and this time, he shakes off both. And he *roars* in pain, frustration, anger - everything - blood curdling and primal. Direct from the Nine Hells.

Inafina moves forward and sees Oswen inside via a window slit. She calls through, "I can't keep hiding, how do I get Chango off my back?!" - Oswen, ARC 22, shouts back, "Dispel Magic will do it! And we need to act, Orvil grabbed Vecna's Hand!" - so Infina starts to run around the windmill, sees Chango and has to duck back to stay hidden. She prepares to run if called for.

Oswen walks out into the courtyard and shouts, loudly - Velindra is in Silence! - "Orvil, Kindle, try to get the Hand back to her Champion! We must stop the lich!" (DM fiat; she's heard a lot about the cult and maybe Arkhan will believe that...)

"WHAT?!" says Kindle.

Oswen says "You heard me! And Arkhan, don't *you* forget it either!"

She figures - either way, we're probably getting killed by Velindra now, if she survives! She uses Message to Kindle; "It's a dangerous game, but we have to keep this hand attached to *someone* so that we kill whoever *bears* both!"

Deception; despite blowing Bardic and Heroic it's only 17. His insight roll is surprisingly not enough to figure it out - and now he thinks we've been sent by the cult to rescue him! And Velindra hasn't heard a thing. Oswen runs back into the doorway.

Velinda runs towards Kindle, with Orvil in her sights; he's at a similar altitude to where he was before; she decides to step further, too, getting outside the Silence range. She can't see Oswen, who's back in the doorway; she assesses things; she casts Magic Missile. Two go to Orvil, two to Arkhan.

The last thing Oswen hears is Orvil saying, "sorry, I led her out of the sile -" - the hand drops and Velindra catches it. Meanwhile Arkhan takes 8 damage.

Oswen, battling grief - he's not really gone, he's just in the Fey, he's not gone! - now has to rely on her Manifest Mind.

(Krull - death saving throw)

The skeletons continue attacking. The barbarian Frenzy takes a hit (9->4), and Arkhan a hit and a crit (21->10). 5 damage from Arkhan's swarm to the other, halved to 2!

Hapless Abishai *finally* breaks the fear. We know that from distant frustrated shrieking.

Bel runs around to the Southern windmill wall again. "I guess we're playing our hand?" (distantly Oswen, a plaintive "Yes!") - and casts Dispel Magic on Chango. He uses his own Bardic - but it's not enough. That means he has to use his Heroic Inspiration, which *does* work, but **we're all getting really tapped out, yet Arkhan and Velindra are both still up!**

He's wondering who to give Bardic back to. Kindle still has his and Kindle's important, and Bel's important too - self confidence! - he helps himself.

Seeing a sudden change in Chango and hearing Bel's spell, Owen calls out, "REGROUP!" - and Inafina's held action is triggered; she dashes into the courtyard.

Velindra sees it too - and uses Paralysing Touch on Kindle. 18, matching AC. Oh no. He's injured, 10 Cold damage; but he meets her paralysing DC and is *not* frozen in place. He reacts by trying to push her down onto the ground (he's got good reason to not want to grab the hand, and he can't reach Arkhan due to the skeleton swarms). He hits (but uses Bardic to do it). She's not just pushed prone, she's also pushed back away from him (sadly, though, this is "sideways" rather than into the silence). Then he runs back behind the recently-arrived Inafina.

Kindle plays along - "Arkhan! The Hand is very close to you now! Seize it!"... Velindra hears *that*.

The Bloodless Frenzy uses Escape; it gets into Velindra's face and pulls Changon along into the frey. With the first attack, it grabs the Hand; but then throws it towards Arkhan - rolls a 1,2 with advantage! - and it lands amongst the skeletal swarm instead! - and then the Frenzy attacks a nearby swarm, rather than Velindra. He *really* hates those swarms.

Carpet peers around the South-East corner of the windmill, looking towards where Inafina went.

Chango is clawing at Inafina. His twice. But none of it works; it's not magical! He moves around, trying to command the space to protect Arkhan - who stands up amongst the skeleton swarms. Perception roll - reaches out, grabs the hand and shoves it back onto his arm. It's clearly *horribly* painful as necrotic tentacles spring out and the already-withered original arm is damaged even further.

For better or for worse, the Hand is back with Arkhan.

He reaches to his axe and reactivates a Divine Strike of some kind.

Velindra is prone. She casts a DISADV Ray Of Frost up towards Chango, hitting; Chango takes 4d8 -> 7 (!) cold damage.

Inafina overheard the deception. She moves closer to Oswen, deliberately blocking Velindra's view via the old hall fireplace. She can't think of anything meaningful to do - Velindra looks bloodied; Arkhan looks bloodied; each has a Vecna artefact. She readies an attack with her staff triggered by anyone trying to attack her party.

Oswen reaches into her pouch, grabs a gross not-potion and, wincing, chows down on a desiccated goat's heart. Potion of invulnerability. She shouts back to Bel, "good work; come forward, but with caution, it's a mess!"

A very angry Velindra stands. Looking at the Bloodless Frenzy and screaming, "GET OUT OF MY WAY!" she casts Disintegrate! He doesn't manage to dodge; 83 damage - and not halved, as this isn't a type to which the barbarian is resistant. In an instant, he's turned into ash.

"It's *mine*. It's *killing _you_*, can't you see?!" she says to Arkhan, clearly in reference to the Hand. She holds her ground. Looking to us - "I am going to make you all pay for interfering. Mark my words."

(Krull - death saving throw)

Looking to Kindle, Velindra attacks with Ray of Frost again, hitting and doing a very high 26 damage. Ouch.

The skeletal swarms do their thing. Quite a few hits on Arkhan this time, but his armour deflects a fair bit of it meaning 12 damage to him - and his skeletal swarm deals 15->7 to another.

The White Abishai appears over the top of the nearby hill.

Bel runs in and jumps amongst us. We're dangerously close together, but he moves the Inafina illusion to try and maybe confuse *someone*! (Velindra has truesight... So not her). He sends Bardic Inspiration to Kindle, seeing he's injured - the first hit we've taken, astonishingly, in this madness. Then he casts Mirror image - three copies of himself appear. Two Inafinas, four Bels!

Round 9.

Kindle is once again wondering what we do. ("Are we still attacking her?!" he whispers and Oswen says, "They seem about equal, so we're waiting, *again!*" "That Abishai is coming back!" "I am aware!" "It's not going to know we're on their side!" "....ah. Something, defensive perhaps?!" "Should I bring the Tortle back?")

Krull's not dead yet? OK. Woah. Bold move.

**Oswen laughs. "What in the Nine Hells are we doing?! Sure! Why not?!"**

Kindle casts Healing Word, healing Krull for 9 points. He lives! He calls out "...I'm back..." - And Arkhan saw Kindle do it.

It's *still* too early for the sword. If Oswen runs up with the chest, he'll grab it.

Carpet decides to follow us! It drifts along the ground, getting close, hiding behind part of the ruined town hall's walls.

Chango realises that attacking Velindra is pointless, so tears into the skeleton swarms and gets 3 hits. 10 damage. Velindra attacks back; she hits with a Ray Of Frost for 18 and Chango is slowed. He's very badly injured now.

Arkhan calls out, "Hold steady my friend! We are nearly there." He dashes forward; skeletal swarms swipe at him, two actually hitting! 17, 4 -> 8, 2 -> 10 damage. His prepared Strike on his weapon is held. He calls out "Tiamat! Strike her down!" and swings at her. The first would hit but Velindra reacts with a Shield. As a result the next two attacks miss, too!

Inafina continues to hold, ready to attack anyone who might come near.

Oswen takes out the tiny chest and holds it one hand. She's ready to use the command word, if either of Velindra or Arkhan fall. She moves out to get next to Kindle and sees Carpet. Clambering aboard, she moves over to get close to Kindle.

Velindra (Legendarily) acts again; another blast of cold, directly at Arkhan this time, point blank, hoping to hit despite that - but he dodges. On her *actual* turn she's fixated on the Hand. "This is taking too long. I don't have time to deal with your nonsense!" - goodness knows what her rush is?! - and through some kind of magic, she starts to draw the moisture out of him! (Blight). Arkhan makes the CON save, taking 8d8 -> 39 -> 19 necrotic damage.

It's a bizarre tit-for-tat. One moment Velindra seems on the ropes; then Arkhan.

"Stop that priest from getting close!" commands Velindra to her skeletons, seeing Krull up. But Krull is already preparing to cast a spell in anticipation - once again he calls forth his Spirit Guardians at L5, the most powerful level he is able (5d8 damage). He marches forward towards Arkhan and the remaining swarms. 26 potential damage. Three swarms are vanquished. The only remaining swarm left under Velindra's control immediately moves to attack but is also taken down by the Guardians, while the one Arkhan controls harasses Velindra, but of course does very little.

The Abishai gets in close - "I'm back, Arkhan!"

Bel sees Oswen on the carpet and in absence of other instruction jumps on board board - Oswen grins at him. He's worried about his friend Kindle so casts Healing Word L2 for 14 healing.

Kindle moves a bit, to get a better view; Oswen once again whispers, "*hold*..." - and so he prepares to grab the sword, should she offer it; and he casts, unusually Healing Word on himself. He's full.

Carpet holds. Oswen isn't sure but thinks it might be trembling?!

Chango is so angry that despite being unable to injure Velindra he flies in anyway (flanking against Arkhan). He rakes at her with his claws, out of pure anger. It doesn't hurt her, but realising she's being distracted on both fronts she uses Disrupt Life. A 20ft radius emanation hits Inafina too (unbeknownst to Velindra). CON save, Inafina remarkably - 19+1 -> 20. She makes it, Chango too; Arkhan fails. Inafina takes 9 necrotic damage, Chango likewise; Arkhan takes 19.

A now heavily injured Arkhan holds his smite, just and attacks - with flanking advantage - with three attacks. The first hits despite her throwing a Shield, with the powerful smite released on contact. She takes 19 damage fully, plus 10 -> 5, plus 4d6 radiant -> only 8, total 32 in that first attack alone. But that shield helps a lot and despite flanking, the next two attacks miss - both Velindra and Arkhan still stand!

...Arkhan reactivates his smite...

Inafina continues to hold her ground. She's looking at Kindle, knowing that they'll work together soon.

Oswen is twitchy. This has taken so long! But all she can do is wait. She prepares to open the chest with the command word if Arkhan or Velindra go down.

Velindra does something, uuuh, strange. It's a strange casting. L5, in practice, Magic Missile - by now Oswen is paranoid and assumes a good reason but has no idea what that might be. All streak in to hit Arkhan and, of course, all hit. 22 damage. Oswen wonders why he doesn't Shield against it. Must not have that spell!

Krull moves in behind Arkhan. Velindra is in the Guardians range; she fails her save against them so uses a Legendary Resistance to succeed. Oswen perception 18+1 -> 19, she sees that fail and sees that innate resistance be used; she notices Velindra taking only half of the necrotic damage anyway - a lich is resistant to Necrotic. In practice, Velindra only takes 4 damage. It's evident that she's doing everything she can to avoid damage now.

**Surely, _soon_**, thinks Oswen. One must fall. She quietly hopes it's Velindra. For some reason, Arkhan seems like an easier target, if only because we'll have the benefit of surprise. But that said, his entourage is still quite strong - if Velindra stayed up and we attacked, maybe they'd help. But we can't help her; we played our hand as assistance for Arkhan.

Krull has healed Arkhan for 20 points - but at point blank, Velindra unleashes another Ray Of Frost in his direction and that hits. 26 damage. OK - thinks Oswen - maybe she'll go down!

The skeletal swarm held by Arkhan tries to attack but it's pointless. The Abishai flies in and attacks her from another side. **She's set upon now.**

Miss, miss, longsword crit (but the other two attacks aren't magical and would've done nothing anyway). 14 more damage. A Shield went up but it doesn't work. She's just clinging on. Must surely be low on spells too.

Bel curiously calmly says, "hey Kindle, Oswen - the moment you grab that sword, I'll take you to another dimension! We'll emerge right besides whoever has both artefacts. Be ready!" (He's preparing Dimension Door).

Round 10...

Kindle continues to stay ready to grab the sword! "We have to play our hand at some point..." he mutters; Oswen isn't sure what he means (he wants to take an Action to do 'something' but can't as he's holding that to grab the sword).

Velindra tries another Ray, but this time, it misses. Chango continues harassing her, to little effect - she tries another Ray, which this time hits Arkhan, dealing 14 damage.

**Arkhan goes down**.

Inafina moves to get line of sight, sensing that Velindra might run; so Inafina is ready to run and tackle, to try and grab her.

Oswen says, "Keep close. We might have portal out together". But not yet - not quiet yet - hold - nobody has both Hand and Eye yet! She keeps her action prepared...

Velindra slices her own hand off! She yanks off the Hand of Vecna from the downed Arkhan (!) (Oswen later theorises that the Hand was happy to move to the proved-stronger person) and jams it against her own arm. We *feel* a bizarre, extremely potent and ancient arcane energy burst forth. A madness is in her eyes. Surrounded by Arkhan's crew, she casts Wish - she wishes that *all* of Tiamat's forces are "**sent back to where they belong**"! And they vanish.

...and that triggers Oswen to speak the command word and the chest enlarges; she yanks it open hurriedly...

...Kindle almost at the same time reaches back and grabs it; WIS save; he makes the save...

...Bel grabs Kindle's hand and Dimension Door activates. The two appear in a blink behind Velindra.

"What is *this?!*" she hisses - but her eyes fall on the sword with recognition. "TREACHERY! This was your plan all along! You shall not have it!" - and she prepares to run.

...Inafina pounces. 2, heroic inspo, 17 -> 27 unarmed strike. No more Shield. The bunny tackles the lich! She's knocked prone.

Bel's turn! He's freaked out, no time for indecision, tries Hold Person! - Velindra of course saves, but these things are *always* worth a try. With his bonus action, he uses Mantle of Majesty. He bursts with a Fey light, taking on the guise from when was being knighted by Titania. He can Command. "Velindra, YIELD!" - but she saves against that, too!

Velindra uses Disrupt Life. CON saves within 20ft:

* Inafina 7, hard fail
* Kindle fails - but he's holding the sword, which gives him resistance!
* Bel makes it

21 necrotic total (10 for Bel and Kindle).

**Kindle is ready. He swings**.

He has advantage since she's prone. Nat 19+9 -> 28. The Sword of Kas crits on a 19.

He applies Divine Strike, harnessing his Bonus Action to - for the first time ever, having resisted the sword's influence - cast Holy Weapon. The sword itself is wreathed in Yondalla's magic. We *all* hear the sword in our heads screaming in protest! "I do not bend to another god! *I* am a god!" - 4d8 Radiant on top of the hit (19) plus his Strike (10) plus the sword itself directly (14) plus bonus damage to Undead from the Sword of Kas (12) -> *55 damage* on the 19-based crit. And a lot is Radiant; and it's all magical.

There's a terrible, intense scream. It's not from Velindra. It's extremely painful! CON saves all round, DC 20:

* Inafina fail
* Oswen fail
* Kindle fail
* Bel fail

...6d6 -> 18 (could be worse!) psychic damage all round. Oswen takes 9. The Inafina illusion fails.

The sword slashes true, from Eye to Hand. Both are destroyed, resulting in the huge release of psychic damage, travelling out like a shock wave. We are sure it went a long way - maybe even a mile! - and even has a physical impact, bones and stones and already-broken walls being shredded apart. Somehow Velindra has enough consciousness left - "No, it can't be! I was so close! I will avenge..." - she's starting to wither and dissipate - whispering, almost - "...I will remember your faces, and when I return, I will destroy..." - and turns into dust.

Of course, she's not gone. She'll be back. But Oswen isn't sure how long that will take.

Kindle is trembling. "Oswen! Hurry!" - and she realises he's struggling with the sword still. With Inafina's help, she runs over to move the chest underneath. But he says, "I can't let it go!" - he's resisting the sword's desire to take more blood; Oswen casts Remove Curse; it falls into the chest, screaming, and Oswen says, "Well you got the Eye and Hand, didn't you?!" and slams the chest shut, speaking the command word.

It goes quiet.

After moment - "Is it over?!" asks Bel.
