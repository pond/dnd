# Oswen: Part 2.2
## Day 4, Solstice Week
### Loch Wynnice

In the morning, Oswen gives Orvil a mission to fly around the island, looking for possibly other exits, nearest banks and so-on. But it turns out that he can't fly to it. If he flew low, he always hit cloud banks. He'd fly through but emerge on the other side of the presumed island, facing the far bank. He tried many times. If he flew high enough, he looked down and saw *no* clouds or island; it was as if he were beyond the crossover of the Fey and material planes, in the same way as some people came over the mountains one way, others another, depending on Fey vs material originals.

We elect to try and strike up a conversation with the Dockmaster. The docks are very busy. The Dockmaster is an older gentleman. Many supplies are being loaded into boats. Our eye is caught by two very large people, wearing really long oilskins, boots and big gloves; it's hard to tell *what* they are; 7ft or so tall; hoods up; wooly hats pulled down; scarves! Bel wants to know more so tries to pretend he's plain clothes security for the event, and wants to know who those are... Deception 17. But his cover is immediately blown as the two figures *are* the security for the event! They know the way to get *to* the island (and remember Orvil's experience, we guess that maybe there's a particular course on the water that must be followed, else you get lost in the mist).

Decorations, food, and so-on. But was there anything different this year? The dockmaster told us he's done this for decades! "A lot more food than usual" he says; "must be a bigger party this year. They'll know!" - points to the two "guards".

We approach. We're in the way. Kindle offers to help lift things; this helps distract while Bel makes enquiries, again making up stories about who we are; ADV deception 26. It is indeed a bigger party but the mood is "off". The Head of Staff **Oren** is more stressed out; perhaps it's just because there were more invitations written. "It might also be because there's a new band?" says the other. "They're trying a few new things out. Oren's trying to put his own stamp on the party. And the chef is being... Difficult! She's rejected a few shipments."

During this, Inafina is observing; insight 17+6 -> 23; these two people have strange feet! Animal feet in their boots. As they move, she notices tails, being hidden below the oilskins. They're reminiscent of bushy dog tails and they do have gruff voices and kind of jutting, long jawlines - or snouts! Inafina says, "Forgive me, I'm sure you're covered up for a good reason, but are you derived from something like wolves or huskies? As you can see, I'm a Harengon myself! Always interested to meet new people."

They stop, look at each other, then back at her; one pulls down the scarf. A large winter wolf. "How wonderful! I can see how you must be very good at security." Their eyes have a shimmer that suggests ability to see through illusions or invisibility; their noses must be keen, and their hearing; they will be fast and strong, when not encumbered by all the oilskins at least.

As we leave the docks, we see the market is set up - and there's a book shop, magic shop and more. It looks like we'll have some fun before we get back to business!

Oswen asks Kindle if there's anything he sees that's interesting. He spots a gingerbread house (!) within the winter market. Strung up on poles are beautiful decorations that look like snowflakes and stars. There's a big pine tree here (but most others around are not) which stands out since it is still green which is being decorated mostly in white. The whole effect is made more special as occasional light flurries of snow are now falling. And, in front of the tree is an 8ft high gingerbread house! Strangely, there are no children.

Kindle seems drawn to it. Up close, he sees it is *actually* made of gingerbread, even with piped icing windows and more. "I don't suppose you'd mind telling me what it's like inside?!" "Of course not!" says Oswen, and her and Orvil go in. Kindle looks in through sugar windows, trying to see how much he can.

There are biscuit and gingerbread tables, a small rocking table and more. A *lot* of effort! There's even a set of shelves with decorations, cookie books and more. An edible writing desk has a pot of chocolate ink with a liquorice pen. It smells sweet and spicy. She calls out descriptions as she looks around. It seems to be just for display, which is perhaps why there are no kids? They'd eat everything. But who made it?! Investigation, 22. Nothing inside, so she checks outside. There's a small display carving that says it was gifted to the market, by a local baker - "The Annual Gingerbread House Display".

Oswen does a few Minor Illusions to give Kindle a good idea of what it looks and smells like, then suggests, why not check out the bakery? Well - we see straight away that stalls here sell all kinds of things, though; food, mitts, scarves, hats, earmuffs - and there's a stand with the bakery's name on it. But it looks like it might be almost sold out! There's a sign - "For more gingerbread, visit our bakery".

We'll do that - but Inafina points at some of the various stalls and says, "Remember how we needed trinkets last time? Or just things to thank people with. How about those?" - she points at a stall that sells what seem to wire reindeer, made out of wire with kind of a furry wrapping (like pipe cleaners). There are glass stars and blown glass hanging ornaments too. We pick up two reindeer, two stars and two ornaments. 9sp. Another stall sells enamel cloak pins and glass roses; and we see the human who was sat at the bar by themselves last night. We walk up and Bel tries to strike up a conversation - "See anything interesting?"

He introduces himself as **Kaden Lannis**. Soon to be Lord of **Esthome Manor**! His grandfather is not long for the earth... And his father passed when he was young. He's next in line - so he's trying to find a wife. But if he doesn't find true love by spring, his mother insists on taking her up on an arranged marriage. He's a bit melodramatic but we do agree that it would be bad to be forced into something.

We chat about it for a while; then Oswen, history 15, quite a few Fey creatures have innate Charm abilities. Female satyrs, faeries and more. Kaden is worried about Charms, because he needs "true love". We don't want to mess up his dreams, but we do warn him to be careful! Inafina's passive insight does note that he is *sure* he will find true love in the gala. The time is right. An amazing party. The most wondrous thing - surely *this* will be the time! He thinks it *must* happen; he feels this is his last chance.

Chatting more, we learn some things about his interests and more. He's from a different Material Plane - he calls it **Oerth** - not where we're from; when Oswen mentions names of a few places she knows, he refers to our plane as **Torril**. Apparently his plane is more mundane; less magical.

Next, we head over to the bakery lest it sell out too, like its stall did. Outside is a beautiful sign - "**Sweet Mama West**" (!) - with a strap line, "Baker Of Loch Wynnice's Famous Gingerbread House". In we go! There's a table with nothing but miniature gingerbread houses. In the middle is one that's "3D" with a little light inside, then a few smaller 3D ones, then some 2D ones (cookies). They're individually wrapped in a nice display. At the back, an older man is making candy canes as people watch, twisting and curling. This Bel's eye. Kindle starts examining gingerbread houses. In front of the main counter is a glass display with lots of different coloured, decorated small cupcakes. Inafina is excited about those! There's a log cabin cake too, just one, with a "Sold" sign. It's all very sweet-tooth stuff, but very artistic and well made. Perhaps more confectioners than bakers.

Kindle chooses one of the 3D houses. Inafina finds a cupcake with deep purple icing that she likes the look of. Bel goes for a traditional white and red candy cane. It's mint flavoured! 1gp, 2sp and 1sp respectively - paid. We head back out, with treats in hand. Kindle ends up putting his house, after examining it, into the portable hole. Oswen says, "Are you saving that for squirrel?" "I want to learn how to make one!"

Oswen's been holding back because there's a magic shop. Inafina picks up on it and suggests that next. It's quite a compact, small main street with lots of interesting but useful businesses on the whole, all close together. It doesn't take long to walk anywhere - the magic shop, for example, is only a couple of doors up. Two storeys, narrow. **The Breathless Word**, "Wondrous Items and Magical Supplies". We all head in (Kindle watching his head on the ceiling!)

It's dim inside, evidence of attempts to avoid sun damage inside. It's warm, and not stuffy or damp but still has that dry, paper-y smell. Everlasting flames are set inside glass jars for light. There's a wall of scrolls, a central display with some beautiful items, some rows of books and a glass cupboard at the back full of special inks, quills, ground up gems, parchment and other basic spell components.

The owner is a half-eleven female with small round glasses, hair tied up high in a bun. She is called **Valentine**. Oswen knows what she wants; something related to being more stealthy, first. First, an invisibility scroll is shown. Nope, Oswen had something else in mind... Next is something called Pass Without A Trace. Oswen knows that's the right thing - but also knows she can't understand it. It talks about aspects of magic that she is completely unfamiliar with. Bel has a look; nope! Same problem. Kindle checks it... He can't cast it either.

Oswen settles for the Invisibility scroll, just so she can get that into her spellbook. 90gp is the price apparently. Next she asks, is there anything that might help against charms (for Kaden)? Yes! The owner goes up a ladder; pulls out a scroll; comes back down. "Intellect Fortress". That sounds ideal and Oswen does understand this spell, but of course Oswen would need to cast and concentrate on it. There doesn't seem to be a similar potion or artefact; the closest thing this shop has is a strange swirling potion with a pink glittery effect, only small, feels very Fey; "A Potion Of Advantage" (which does what it says, giving a choice to gain advantage once within an hour of drinking it).

Oswen says to the others, "all three could be useful..."; meanwhile Valentine hum-s and ha-s, apparently wondering if she can trust us! Strange. Bel gives his most trustworthy face... Persuasion 22. She pulls out a potion that she doesn't have, nudge, wink... Turns out it's a potion of mind reading. We share her reluctance! We might use it ourselves, but then, we have the helm.

So we'd need that L2 scroll, the L3 could be really useful generally, but that's 5 levels of 50gp -> 40gp with quill of inks, which Valentine *does* have. So, we're looking at:

*  90gp for Invisibility
* 175gp for Intellect Fortress
* 250gp of magic ink to transcribe them - 200gp with the quill tho
*  75gp for the Potion of Advantage

...welp, 540gp. But she's always keen to exchange for items of interest! So we get into a bit of exchanging and haggling. We do have the Pipes Of Haunting, which seems like a neutral item; but also the Scissors of Shadow Snipping - but that seems dangerous and outright evil. Valentine agrees about those; she can't imagine ever selling them. She says she'd gladly have given us 1000gp otherwise, and advises us to never take less than that if we do find an appropriate buyer! The pipes are a different story. She pulls out a book - "I've read about these, look!" - and offers us the pipes for the 175gp scroll. Leaves us with 365gp on list price. We discuss and haggle; Bel persuasion 13+7->20; she offers 350gp and we accept.

We consider the book shop for information about the Shard Solitaire, but then again, there's a library at Palliset Hall. Then we overhear commotion on the pier - we head over to be nosey! Raised voices, ringing of hands. Boats have returned and several are being *unloaded*. The chef refused even more deliveries. But the merchants are adamant - they supplied exactly what was asked for and should be paid.

Inafina insight only 10; she can't see over the crowd. But Kindle can. Insight 21. There's a pixie who returned with a satyr, and they're trying to unload boats onto the pier with the wolves having to be guards against the annoyed merchants. The two unloading are trying to speak on behalf of the kitchen. And they look distressed; not because of *this*, but because they're between a rock and a hard place. They don't think there's anything wrong with this either... But they've got to do what the chef says.

Kindle mutters something to Bel, then winks at Inafina and Oswen - then the two push their way through to the front. Oswen and Inafina follow in the wake. He tries to say that people should be calm, that we'll be going to the hall first thing tomorrow morning, can chat to the chef etc. etc., Oswen here is a Witchlight monarch (she "gets it" and has the minor illusion up); persuasion for the kitchen staff, 14+7->21, it's enough for him to get the feeling that he should keep going with the whole patter for the merchants, to give the kitchen staff some space - and Inafina sidles in now, to talk to them about what is *really* going on.

They are distressed - the traders aren't wrong - the goods are in good condition, in fact extremely high quality, and are exactly was ordered. But **Anisetta** has scrapped the entire menu and had to start all over again, needing totally different ingredients! When she did the test tasting, Lady Zorhanna didn't like it at all. Hated it? Or just had no reaction? And this has Anisetta tied in knots.

Inafina tries to assure the kitchen staff that Lady Z just is under "regrettably a lot of personal stress this year, at the worst possible time" and that her 'flat' reaction was just because "her mind is elsewhere" (I mean - it *literally is*, we think!). They agree to try and talk to Anisetta and bring her back to speak to us, so we can reassure her that the menu is fine.

Between this, Bel, and the kitchen staff, we manage to get things into a fragile, at least "parked" state for now, holding the goods in good condition, the merchants head for a drink, the kitchen staff get back on the water, and we back to wondering what on all the planes is going on!

In the mean time we spot Kaden again and Oswen explains about the Potion of Advantage. It seems half the town is now gravitating towards the tavern bar and we're swept along with it. Kaden insists on paying, despite it being a gift, but we did get a discount, so he gets it for 60gp. And we encourage him to introduce a "new love", if he finds one, to us; we can use the Helm, not that he knows it.

In the, bar we try to keep an eye out for the mysterious tiefling but even Kindle - perception 6+4->10! - despite his height advantage can't see her. The reporter is talking to the traders, digging for dirt doubtless. Oswen grabs Bel and sweeps in. "If you want a story", she says, "I'll give you a story!" - and we pull him to one side - and then start telling the story of Prismeer, in as much detail as possible, hoping to stop him pulling away and getting into more salacious stories with other people. Bel, performance, 12+7->19. It works for a while.

Meanwhile, "Pst!" hears Kindle, near his ear - a small pixie - "...come! Anisetta has agreed to meet you at the lake!" and so Kindle sends Inafina through the crowd to get Oswen and Bel while he departs, and we extricate ourselves from the journalist on the excuse of picking up costumes (not entirely wrong) and Oswen sends Orvil out to get an aerial view to find Kindle. Easily done. We all end up at the lake, with the pixie (who flew to town from the lake island). "Do you have a boat?" - oh, no. But the wolves, still on guard on the pier, are amenable; they show us a small rowboat. The pixie flies ahead. Kindle sits in the middle, rowing; the rest of us squeeze around. We row into the mist, the pixie now glowing, lighting the way.

A short time later we pull up alongside another boat, with the satyr and an old female dryad. Bel says, "Chef Anisetta, I presume?" "Yes! You can just call me Chef." "Very good, Chef."

We get into it, trying to persuade her; a long story about how Zorhanna has behaved, but it's totally out of character. And Oren seems out of his depth, albeit trying his best. "I wish Lycoris was still around!" - but that would upset Oren. We kick around some ideas. "What if he just came on as, ostensibly, a 'menu consultant'", suggests Kindle (Insight 21, with combined INT-based Oswen insight 17, via help from Inafina).

In the end, it's decided. We have to find Lycoris. We can find our way back to shore - probably...! Oswen, Arcana 10+17->27 (!). As we travel the mist, Oswen senses something... A psychic emanation, reaching through the lake, desperate, pleading... Aimless. She tries her best to concentrate - CON, 16+1->17 just; she can hear that same voice she heard before. "I know you're out there somewhere! You won't be able to hold me here forever! Damn you! I will find my out and I will destroy you!", but Oswen is fairly sure she can't reply... Then it vanishes, like a voice briefly carried on a breeze.

Inafina notices Oswen's demeanour; she describes the encounter. A touching of planes, perhaps? At Solstice the veil between planes weakens. Oswen remembers Kaden, and says, "Oh of course, I'd selfishly assumed it was just *my* plane, and the Fey, but it sounds like it's sort of all of them, or at least many. So she's probably on another plane, at least mentally, but it could be any plane."

We make it back to shore. It's late afternoon; the snow has stopped but the clouds have cleared, with a beautiful clear sky but the sun just about to dip behind the mountains. The town's lights are on. Very "winter wonderland". The lake will freeze soon! We dock the boat and try to find Lycoris; we check the tavern first. The pixie is busy with merchants here, and boats are loaded - in a hurry as it's so late. Lycoris' group isn't here, so we go to the inn and ask after them at the desk. Policy; they can't tell us who is here and who is not... Bel, persuasion 22. If we write a message, she'll bring it to the room. So we write a message - "Oswen's company - with apologies for short notice, please meet at the room indicated urgently, many thanks!"

It doesn't take long - they must've been in the room; there's a knock on the door. It's them. We persuade Lycoris - she has to get her kit as she won't have time to come back tomorrow, she thinks, but there's plenty of boat traffic and a path free of ice is being kept by that movement. Lycoris is able to catch one of the last merchant boats going out, with some supplies, with leans into the "menu consultant" story.

It's getting late; Bel is checking the time - we need to get our own costumes. D8->4. There are a couple of people already there, but we're invited to wait; shouldn't be long. Before we go in, Oswen asks Orvil to fly out and keep an eye on the inn and tavern doors to see if the Tiefling is ever visible.

Only 10 or so minutes later, the previous customers are finished. Khorr comes over and invites us for fittings, one at a time. Kindle is first. His "tin man" costume fits straight away, without needing adjustments! Inafina next. The cap needs some ear adjustments to sit well on her head; the rest of it is fitted and adjusted if necessary, but it doesn't take long; that leaves Oswen with with Zybilna 'cosplay'. Khorr says he'd tried adjusting the other dress, but for the height changes needed it was just dumpy! He's made a new one instead. Oswen tries it on - and then Oswen senses a voice. It's Orvil - "Oh! I see her! I see her!" - Oswen says to Khorr, "Just one moment!" and closes her eyes to see what Orvil is seeing - he might just be flying her way. But she does see the Tiefling, wrapped up, moving quickly away from the tavern, looking at the clock tower. She seems furtive. She walks towards the clothes shop!

Oswen pokes her head out of the fitting room and says, "Hag's eye is coming here! Hide!" then carries on with her fitting! Bel corrals everyone *into the fitting room*. Khorr is very surprised, but Bel does some light deception - a friend that we want to surprise and shouldn't see our outfit... Is there a back door?! Yes, but we need to finish Oswen's fitting.

Khorr pokes his head out of the curtain as the door bell rings from the door opening and delays.

The fitting is finished and we have to sneak out of the back...

* Oswen 20+2->22
* Inafina 19+7->26
* Kindle DISADV 12,13+4->16

Bel elects to disguise himself, so that someone leaves the changing room. He has the Hat Of Disguise. He changes to look like an old lady. "Thank you very much, dear!" he says loudly, as he walks out with Khorr past the Tiefling. Deception 22 vs insight nat 1 (!). Bel notices that she's very nervous. Her perception rolls are similarly low; we get out and regroup at the front of the shop.

Oswen sneaks to the front to the window, just alongside. The Tiefling isn't visible for a while as they're in the fitting room. As she comes out with Khorr and pays, Oswen dons the helm of telepathy and activates it. WIS save for the Tiefling 11, vs DC 13, so it's not detected; shallow thoughts. Costume is good, seems expensive, "could get much cheaper in Baldur's Gate", uncertainty, "maybe I could ask for an extra spell? Maybe the'll give  me something extra?" - she's a warlock; she's thinking of her patron. On that WIS save, Oswen focuses on the notion of patron. The patron is three people - a coven of hags - the Crestfall Coven, which is the name we got last time; but Oswen learns that this Tiefling is the "front line eyes and ears" of this coven, who want to **enact their revenge this year on Zorhanna**. They managed to obtain a legitimate, authentic invitation for the Tiefling, *whose real name is* **Adira**. And since that's a warlock-patron pact, the Tiefling is obliged to obey and we're unlikely to be able to do anything to change her mind about that.

The coven plans to do - something. And since Adira is the *advance* eyes and ears, their plan isn't really underway so **whatever is happening already to Zorhanna is *not* their doing**. But they also are very angry! They've managed to escape wherever they were sent, have a seething hatred - and *most likely want to steal back the Shard Solitaire*.

The tiefling heads towards the door and Oswen hears thoughts of exit! She quickly runs around the side of the building, only to find the other three - so she keeps going, the other three then picking up in tow, to find a back roads route to the tavern, but we'll drop off our boxes in the inn first so the tiefling doesn't realise we were recently at Khorr's.

On the back street, we see more signs being put up - "room and board available" - with prices like "10gp"! With the inn, we realise, now completely full and more people still arriving, there's one last night for locals to profit. And at 10gp a room, profit they will. As we're leaving the inn after dropping off the boxes, we overhear someone who can't believe their luck to get a room - Lycoris's is freed up - albeit for 10gp.

We decide to go for tavern food again - to try and overhear conversations. But the tavern is *packed*. The only seats we can see are two, at the end of the very long main table in the middle of the room. It would be hard to overhear anything and we don't want to split up. We head outside to see if there's anywhere else to eat (though of course, we do have our own provisions).

Down a side street, we see a quaint, hand-painted sign, "Mo's Kitchen". We try there. This seems to be set up inside in a living and dining room of an actual house and this, too, is full, but for - with good luck - a four seat table. It's family run. We choose the same option for food from the two-option menu; then Bel orders brandy, Kindle orders mead and Oswen and Inafina order ciders. Food is slowly rolling out to other tables. The drinks arrive quickly, in home-owned glassware, but it's good stuff. Later, food turns up; the presentation is merely alright, but the taste is great.

We can't really talk to other tables here, since it's not a tavern; more of restaurant vibe. We don't recognise other groups here from yesterday. A couple, a group of four and two groups of three. Our table quietly chats but as usual Inafina is quiet and listens in (perception 22).

* The group of four won the invitations as a prize; they are adventurers of a sort too, winning their prize by rescuing someone.
* The couple appear to be old lovers, together for many years, and seem to have a familiarity with the family - perhaps they're regulars to this place and the gala.
* One group of three seem to have just met, separate guests, all going to the gala for the first time but bonded via ending up in a room share arrangement.
* The last group of three is a couple plus a friend. The couple have been before but the friend isn't going to the party.

We discuss our plan for tomorrow; Kindle and Bel helping with the sound check while Oswen and Inafina head upstairs and sneak into the study. At least the upstairs balcony gives a reason to be up there, for the sound check. The food and drink is good value - 4gp for everything. Outside, it's very cold, although the snow has once again stopped. Kindle's clouds of breath almost envelop his whole head as we walk. The lights of Paliset Hall are once again visible through the low mist once we're on the waterfront. The mist seems thinner, too.

Oswen says, "I have a risky idea. The mist is thin. The planes are close. This is the last night I'll get a chance. It might be a waste, but let's go to that oak. I'm going to try Divination again."

So we head over there and Oswen via ritual starts her spell. The question is simple; "Where is Lady Zorhanna's Consciousness Being Held?" - she figures the answer is easy, but the spell is visual; recognising the location will be difficult, but hopefully, it will be informative in a way.

The mists roll around us and shapes appear, as if a movie is being projected onto the mist. We all see it. She hears in her mind two things at the same time; **Lady Zorhanna is pocket dimension; Lady Zorhanna is trapped in the Shard Solitaire**. And that's her physical self, too. Arcana 18+10->28, a very lucky roll. Oswen hears/senses a strange language, that she's never heard before. She sees strange, organic, misshapen, bulbous walls around her, as if she's pushing through the inside of a brain or some such! The walls pulsate and have a strange, purple-ish hue - colour in divination? Strange - she's floating in space, she thinks, yet in this plane, "space" is this viscous, brain-like matter. She can sense psychic emanations. She knows enough from reading that she's pretty sure this is **the Far Realm**. It is likely that a tear in the fabric of reality happened - perhaps this is where the hags were pushed, since it seems liked to the Shard Solitare. But there is some kind of "alien" entity, something **aware that she is looking**. The divination ends rather abruptly, before she can see who or what that is. She just senses it. The intent was clear: Whatever it is, it wants to break through from the Far Realm to, well, anywhere else, and that would explain the timing of all of this. It's using **a copy of** Zorhanna's body to do this. Whatever is in this dimension, it's not her.

* Lady Zorhanna is trapped in a pocket dimension within the Far Realm, physically.
* Something else over there wants to cross over to here.
* Whatever is at Paliset Hall isn't Lady Zorhanna in any way, neither body nor mind.
* The Crestfall Coven are related to this at least tangentially but seem unaware of what's happening.

We retreat to our room - Bel is very cold! - to talk about it. Oswen perception 10 on the way back, she's distracted, but ADV Inafina on sound, 16,20+6 -> 26. She hears the sound of soft footsteps in the snow off to the side and behind them. Very light. A rustling of a coat and sheets of paper, as in a pocket. She looks around; a small, 3.5 foot shape, skulking in the shadows, following us. It's been following since the lake. Inafina says a code word we'll all worked out, if something is afoot and we want to signal to each other without giving ourselves away, "If you think Bel's cold, imagine what it would be a **squirrel!**"

With that, we are all on alert. Inafina springs forward - she tries to grab; misses at first, just getting a bit of cloak; but she's very fast, is able to catch up and try again; 21 unarmed strike; it's Verano, the reporter. He is wide-eyed but also looks wired! He's a real journalist! "You're a cult! Death worshippers, I knew it! I saw your ritual! You can't fool me! Don't sacrifice me! The truth - the truth will be told!"

Inafina lets go and rolls her eyes. Well, he's legit (insight 18). Perhaps it's time for a chance of tactic. She suggests to Oswen, "If all else fails - the truth?" He's a full conspiracy theorist, but still...

And so we lay it on the line in our room. He gives us his card - "**Verano Honneywell, Greyhawk Cronicle**". He's from Oerth too, and that being a low-magic realm, it's easy to see how higher magic realms could cause such confusion and suspicion. We learn he has nowhere to sleep so offer him the couch, which later he accepts. The TL;DR is that we manage to tell him what's *really* going on; it's enough; he believes us. At the gala, he says he could distract Zorhanna or the Tiefling; we elect for Zorhanna. There's the issue of Dworp too, but we'll figure that out after tomorrow's morning attempt to get to the study.

In due course, still writing notes after we've spoken, Verano falls asleep on the couch. We take watch, but nothing of note happens.



## Day 5, Solstice

We wake up nice and early. Verano is ready to go about his day; we grab a quick breakfast and head to the docks for our 9am boat to the sound check.

The band is there. How are they feeling? D20->7. Oh dear. The drummer won't even be able to do sound check today but does think that'll mean he's OK to perform later. We'll cover for the 'cellist' too as that'll help. Oh yes! That changes our plan - it was Inafina who could help with that. Kindle and Oswen are "sneaking" - OK, not sneaking. "Bodyguard and monarch helping with the sound check" is going to have to be our story.

All aboard!

The mist is surprisingly thick again. This time, though, we go right through. Popping out the other side, it doesn't look quite how Oswen expected; it's a rickety dock, not anything grand or even that well-maintained. But apparently, for the gala, they do something different. This is just a service dock. The boat is unloaded; Kindle can help carry lots of stuff to help the injured Dwarves minimise their risk. Two other Winter Wolves are here, not disguised, so now we know there are four of them. Credentials are checked carefully. Security is high. We are given strict instructions on the path to follow - no wandering off!

As we walk up onto the island itself, we see that it's quite beautiful. The gardens are amazing, with some beautiful sculptures and all manner of extra lights and decorations being set up. Inside, things are still being set up too; a satyr bounds up - it's Oren. We're told where to set up and told not to get in anyone else's way! The band is given a stone - "If you need anything, contact me!" - it's a Sending Stone.

We set up at the ball room, on the stage area. The room is amazing! Very beautiful. Pixies and faeries are busy all over the place, polishing, cleaning, adding little finishing touches like applying individual stars of delicate star motifs on the ceiling; rugs are rolled at the side of the room, ready to be rolled out when there are fewer dirty feet around. In the confusion, Oswen and Kindle peel off and head for the spiral stairs, going for the study.

In foyer, large columns are being placed, with nothing atop - we ask about that; there will be decorations placed atop later. The staff point at Ice Mephits flying around! They're live ice sculptures. We'll never know how they were convinced to agree to that job! We remember then that we need to get to the art gallery for keys to the study, and while there's a basement route, we're already up near the corridor and head that way directly.

Stealth wise, dirty 20 Oswen, only 12 for Kindle. As we walk past the parlour, Kindle sees Lady Zorhanna right in there. Kindle nudges Oswen gently onwards then knocks on the open parlour door. Lady Zhorhanna looks up.

She's an elf, with purple skin; a Drow! Snow white hair. How unusual. Kindle hasn't seen that before. He apologises for the intrusion and distracts her by explaining he's with the sound check and making a show of asking if there's anything in particular Lady Zhorhanna wants checking for. His persuasion check is to buy some time for Oswen. She has no idea how long she has and hastens into the art gallery. She Messages Kindle. "How long have I got? Think a reply" - his reply is, "Just hurry!"

The art gallery isn't quite as shown on the map. There's no visible door to the parlour, which is a relief. Vibrant paintings and tapestries all over, depicting seasons. It's beautiful. Pedestals have precious art artefacts atop them, around the room. Investigation lucky 19+7->26. On the back wall is a mosaic, which is quite different from anything else in the room and there's a shiny snowflake with a kind of polished sheen to it which stands out. Amongst other magic items around here, there's a little bag, clearly magical, leaning against the floor in corner of the room. Detect Magic; the snowflake is not magical. But there are four clearly magical items here - a magical quiver on a mannequin in a beautiful outfit; the mannequin also wears a pair of magical gauntlets; in a glass bell-shaped case there is an amazing magical serpentine or jade owl; finally, the bag itself. Rust-brown coloured, single handle, drawstring. No warding magic she can detect, but there is a very strange emanation; some kind of dimensional magic, coming from *below*. North-West. That's the store room... Strong dimensional magic; very odd; she sees strange, faint veins of purple, *not* good, almost like actual veins, coming "through" reality, just tracing in the air, as if following something she can't see. This feels familiar; the Far Realm "brain" space.

The bag feels inter-dimensional too. Some kind of Bag Of Holding. But first, she tries the snowflake. Feels like a button. Polished as it's pushed a lot. Probably opens the door to the stairwell. It's in about the right place. For fear of making noise, she doesn't push that right now; instead goes to the bag, it's a Bag Of Tricks, not a Bag Of Holding. She reaches in and to her surprise - expecting to take a ball for use later - feels a key. She takes a ball and puts it in her pouch, but then also takes the key. It's been almost two minutes! Poor Kindle, he must be really running out of things to say.

She messages Kindle, "Make a loud noise now, sneeze or cough or something; I'll met you in the foyer" - as he makes a noise, she presses the snowflake button. It is indeed a secret door, with staircase. She heads in; looks for a switch to close the door; another button, presses it. She runs down to the basement level, focusing on the Detect Magic anomaly.

It's a long, relatively narrow corridor / basement store room, maybe 80ft long or so, stacked full of all manner of things. It is clearly in regular use. She's following tendrils. They all come out of the same room from what our maps hows as adjacent staff quarters. She ventures on. It's a locked storage closet; but she is *certain* of a strong dimensional magic within. Message to Kindle; "I'll be there soon. Am in basement. Something is terribly wrong here. Danger. Don't approach". She considers the lock. No ward, but she can't pick it. Knock is loud. Message to Kindle, "On second thoughts, use that basement stairwell off the kitchen. Meet me down here."

Kindle has to use a persuasion check to get through the kitchen - but has ADV since Anisetta knows us, and Lycoris is there. And he gets a nat 20! So that's 22; "Don't make a habit of this! But you were never here and *we* never saw you!" - the staff focus on their stations!

He meets Oswen. He casts Silence centred low to avoid silencing the floor above! Oswen casts Knock, telling Kindle to step back as it could be dangerous. She cautiously opens the now-unlocked door and Kindle holds Silence for now. 

Floating in space is a pulsating rift of iridescent energy. A scar in reality. Light dims and brightens as if at a heartbeat rate, emitting a now-familiar purple, sickening light. CON save - only 9! She takes 8 radiant damage. Kindle isn't far enough back to avoid it either, but he's more hardy and avoids injury. Oswen staggers back into Kindle who catches her. Magically speaking it's just a *tonne* of interdimensional magic, but she only catches a glimpse as the injury causes her to lose Detect Magic. She waves to Kindle to drop Silence and whispers, "We have no way to close that, and certainly shouldn't get close. I don't know what it means that it's here..."

She tries to investigate (DISADV) 10, the aura is just too aggressive and she can't get anything from it. She closes the door. "Lets get out of here" she says, "and get into that study" - she reveals the key.

We get back up to the foyer, then up the spiral stairs. The band practice has started, so that's a good time to be using sound check as an excuse. As we go up, Kindle tells Oswen that Zorhanna was definitely wearing the shard. So now we need to find out more about it, how to get it off her, and maybe how to get into the vault...

Getting up the stairs and sneaking to the study door is easy. We go past the door to the guest bedroom, which is ajar; Oswen can't resist peaking inside. It's *very* well appointed. Sat at a writing desk near the door is a very tall human, some 6' 10", very built! Salt and pepper hair. **Eliphus**. He turns his head to look. "Oh. How... You sholudn't be here?" and Oswen just says, "Fifel gave me the orb." His eyes turn yellow for a moment! Maybe he *is* a werewolf. He ushers us into the room and closes the door quietly.

We start catching up. The subject of the vault comes up. Nobody knows where it is or how to get into it; except in their own bedroom, where there's a painting of a hart. *His* name is "**Oak**". A confidant, a personal assistant. He might be able to help. He's friendly and ought to help without any proof that we're working for Eliphus! "This is risky..." he says and hands us his bedroom key. He's going to go to distract Zorhana at the parlour to buy us time.

We do the study first. Before Oswen even pulls out the key, the door swings open by itself. Inside, the room is larger than we expected. Tall shelves are stuffed full of leather-bound books. There's a wooden writing desk under a stained-glass window showing a scene of an elf queen. On the desk is a very thick book with a cover made of soft white fur! Next to it is a tall white stand with a phoenix claw on top, upturned, supporting a flawless-looking crystal ball.

A set of magic inks and powdered gems in vials are arrayed next to the furry book. There's a drawer in the desk too, the front carved as if curving leaves. Oswen checks the furry book suspecting it to be a spell book and, indeed, it is. Arcana 23; she's certain this is Zorhanna's. Banishment, Cone Of Cold, Counterspell, Detect Thoughts, Fire Shield, Globe Of Invulnerability, Legend Lore, Mind Blank, *Planeshift*, Polymorph, Scrying, Sending, Teleport, True Seeing and more. Very high level stuff. Most are beyond Oswen's ability but here they are, in reality, manifest; not just stories or legends. One is *Time Stop*, which she was *sure* was a tall story and not real! It's good to see Planeshift there, too. That exists.

This is beyond her wildest dreams in some respects; WIS save 17+4->21, so she doesn't get too lost in it.

Kindle asks if we take it. It's a huge risk to be found out via this disappearing out of the study, but the risk of letting this creature impersonating Zorhanna have access to such power is even worse. We stow in the portable hole to avoid it emanating magical signatures in this plane.

Where to look for shard information? She thinks the shelves are tall, Kindle would have to look, it could be anywhere... The drawer might be a better bet. She expects it to be locked, but the presence of the door key in the room seems to be enough to unlock anything. Curious - but useful. She finds sheathes of paper. **There are notes about the Shard here**. It's only written once a year; Zorhanna appears to never take the shard away and can only therefore study it for a week each year.

A lucky Investigation - 18+7 -> 25.

* Zorhanna realises the shard amplified her power, early on.
* It allowed her to access a raft of psionic spells that she just seemed to _know_ without learning them before; she casts them using the shard.
* She knows a spell that she's only used once - Simulacrum - and for whatever reason, she was horrified by that and never did it again, but **Oswen figures that whatever creature wants to escape the Far Realm used exactly that to create a copy of Zorhanna**. And this would **normally take 12 hours and many valuable components, but the shard could do it instantly without that** (which is why she cast the spell, mostly from curiosity).
* All of that means **the copy can cast - at least once - Zorhanna's spells**.
* It can also create three illusory copies of the wearer, to confuse someone about who the real one of four choices might be.
* It can also cast Ice Storm (lots of ice and snow references for the Shard).
* She can teleport - a sort of Misty Step - with the shard; but if she "reaches further" into it, she can go further than the usual distance, almost doubling it (30-60ft) but it's risky - once she did it and felt like she was being crushed by tentacles of force and psychic energy!
* Banishment works through it too.
* It recovers spent properties at dawn.
* It is, in fact, a (very) large diamond ("it's the largest diamond I've ever seen!" says Kindle "It's almost as big as your hand, Oswen").
* There's a recent note from 5 days ago; Zorhanna sensed something different, something strange; a presence, on the edge of her perception; she tried using magic to find it, but couldn't pin it down. "I'll try again tomorrow. Maybe with the power of the Shard Solitaire I will be able to figure it out." So, something was coming through somehow anyway, on at least the day before she tried on the Shard most recently.

Unrelated, we see a note that Zorhanna wrote to herself, apparently from the previous year? "The guardian golem of the scrying pool and vault probably needs some fixing. It seems to still work on the surface - it can recognise me and I can pass it with no trouble, but its eyes are a little cloudy; can Golems get cataracts?! Either way I probably need to replace those eyes or risk security being compromised".

We leave and lock the room. Kindle, perception 16; sound check is still going.

We have to risk talking to Oak. There is unlikely to be time for negotiations if we've removed the shard from a thereafter-enraged copy of Zorhanna, and need to get to the vault before her! Bedroom, then. It's gloriously over the top. The hart is beautiful - a regal, huge stag with beautiful antlers. We approach. Within 10ft, the stag moves. "Oh hullo! Goodness gracious; are you here to talk to me? I haven't spoken to anyone in ages!"

We try to convince Oak to tell us where the pool is - check the security of the golem eyes... Deception even with Guidance is only 14. Well, we only learn enough that the golem is just the *first* part of security. But Oak is not fooled otherwise. However, it has insight and figures we're trying to help Eliphus, not Zorhanna. It doesn't know why we're doing that, but help is still help. It explains that it is a painting of a forest guardian in the *forest* where Zorhanna grew up; unlike others of her kind, her family are worshippers of **Elistrae**, a "good" deity - the only one, in fact - of the Drow pantheon, considered to have betrayed Loth. Their family are in many ways Drow outcasts, as a result. That's why Oak was created, by magic. Oak is taken everywhere with them - he doesn't spend the year here.

* The golem is formidable! Only Lady Zorhanna and those with her - but she's only ever gone there alone so far - are allowed through.
* The scrying pool is where she does divinations to speak to the Prince Of Frost (a Fey ruler), the consort of the Queen Of Air And Shadow - they rule the winter court
* The vault is under the pool. It must be drained. Oak doesn't know how (but we saw a switch pressed in a Divination).
* Then there's a combination lock; Oak doesn't know the combination.
* Then the vault opens. It only contains one thing - the Shard Solitaire.

"I haven't spoken to anyone in so long... Lord Eliphus has totally ignored me and Lady Zorhanna is not herself!" - at which Oswen says, "Ah, you know then; she's a Simulacrum" and **Oak explains what he saw when she put it on. A copy of her emerged next to her, causing her great surprised, overpowered her - but there was *no sound at all* for some reason (Silence spell assumed) and one of the two knocked the other one out, then dragged her out of the room.**

This leans into the assumption that the real Zorhanna hasn't just cast Planeshift to escape because the copy stole something - be it the spell book or some other focus - while she was unconscious (as well as clearly stealing the Shard Solitare itself). Oswen has some vague memory that some spell component is required for Planeshift to target the destination and, perhaps, Zorhanna doesn't have such a thing for "home".

We lock up and head onto the balcony to look down at the sound check. Once it's finished, we regroup and get to the boats. Lady Zorhanna is wondering around, watching, not talking to anyone. Strange. Maybe she suspects... Oswen Message to Eliphus (hoping he's in range), "Made good process. This Zorhanna is a Simulacrum. Forming Plans. Will be back for Gala." - he responds; "I had my suspicions! Not a spell I thought she had. Thank you for your help. Good luck tonight!"

That's that - we all head to the boats, maintaining our cover. As we leave we're all given small pies to eat on the boat, for lunch! Oswen and Kindle of us stay very quiet, with nothing we can risk discussing in the open. Bel and Inafina have a rapport with the band now and the banter keeps the mood lively. It seems the sound check went well; they think it'll be OK for the gala, which is their big break! Inwardly Oswen cringes... She hopes we don't ruin it for them - conflict is inevitable.

Once back at the bank, Oswen quietly suggests we all go the room briefly to "freshen up". In the room, Kindle and Oswen bring people up to speed.

We don't know nearly as much as we need to but we can't see how to learn more at this point.

As for Adira and Dworp - they could help steal it. Do we get Dworp or Adira to try and steal the necklace? Dworp is less obvious but has no real invitation (or enough height?). Adira has a real invitation but has another motive and would want the shard for herself. We can't visibly help Adira, but could we get someone else to be her accomplice? An alternative is to try and swap their invitations so that Dworp definitely gets in. If Adira does - well, so be it.

From the spell book, Oswen can see that potentially Zorhanna or her clone can readily plane shift, teleport or Misty Step, with or without the shard. The highest level spell is level 9 - Time Stop - so Zorhanna's copy is potentially capable of the most powerful magic that Oswen believes exists (were it not for the Shard potentially exhibiting even stronger powers).

We realise we kinda have nothing. But the best we can come up with is to have Dworp encourage Adira to steal the Shard as an accomplice, hoping neither know about the teleport ability. This hinges on Dworp getting in, so we need to see his ticket and see how good a copy it is. We go Dworp hunting. He'll be where the rich people are. We try the tavern first, not too hopeful - but Inafina, ADV perception 22 - she hears his voice. Bel manages to spot him. He's very close! Only some 10ft away, but in a tangle of legs. He's talking loudly and in an animated way while another hand slips into the pocket of the person behind him. Inafina, perception high at 24, but still can't see what it is; fits in his hand, small, quickly taken. He's trying then to wind up the conversation so Inafina calls out, "Why, Mr Dworp! There you are. Are you looking forward to the gala?!". Smalltalk. Oswen deliberately plays absent-mindedly with her green crystal rose from her pouch; dangling a shiny thing for the magpie...

Bel eyes Kindle, who stands behind Dworp; under his breath, Bel says "I'd love to know what you just moved into the pocket from the pocket of the gentleman behind you!" - and so it goes on. Dworp backs into Kindle - 8ft of armoured bugbear growling. "Why don't you come outside with us for a moment for some fresh air?" Doesn't take much convincing.

Outside, we even convincing him - "I bet your invitation isn't even real!" - to show us his forgery, after revealing the diamond, that "we're too obvious", and negotiating a split of value (even having to show him 4000gp to prove we could buy him out!). This is done back in our room. Investigation 21; it's good, but lacks some of the precious inks. Oswen knows where some of *those* probably came from and her Quill can replicate some of the precious colours, but *not* the gem inks - she has to buy those. Arcana 24, she *would* be able to give the quill to Bel to use for colours of his choice. Digging around, she has a bit of remnant ink and Bel sets to work, with Guidance from Kindle. Oswen points out areas that don't compare well and he has to do the forgery work. Amounts to ADV Deception, Bel, plus Guidance; 27 total.

It's *very* good. Dworp is suitably impressed. His real name, he confides, is **Eggsy**. And he says *he* will go for the Tiefling (calling her Mettle, since she doesn't know her true name has "leaked").

OK, book store. Some quick research. Oswen tops up some inks, and considers transcribing spells from Zorhanna's spellbook. How much ink do they even have?! DM roll -> enough for 15 levels of spells! Oswen is reluctant but the party encourages her; it's worth it, we have time, and could be very useful to us. In the end she looks at:

* L2 Detect Thoughts
* L2 Misty Step
* L3 Sending
* L4 Banishment

The quill means it's only 40gp per level but that's still 440gp of ink. We try to barter a bit, and it's not great but he agrees on an even 400gp. Not bad! But then Valentine reminds us that she's always happy to trade. Oswen digs around and finds a Polymorph scroll. She's transcribed that already, so while the scroll could be useful on its own, it's a good bargaining tool - and in the end, it's agreed that we swap this for the inks, like for like, no charge.

Next, we ask about Simulacrums. A whole bunch of books get produced! Oswen and Valentine (ADV) investigate. Nat 20+7 -> 27. What they can do, what their powers are... We find a very important passage. It's *just magic*. So if you **dispel magic high enough, it'll vanish!** It's a Level 7 spell. That means an Arcana check of 17 or better. She doesn't have the spell dialled in, but luckily *does* have a scroll. Bel could try first, then Oswen, with Guidance for us both.

Plan A: Dispel. Plan B: Dworp, Adira and a fight. Or the other way around? We're not sure. Turning Zorhanna into a puddle in the middle of the party would cause quite the ruckus! There's a risk with the journalist who's distracting Zorhanna, who might actually raise the alarm if the theft is attempted.

Oswen off-hand asks - we have a safe at the keep, can't ever remember the combo, would write it down but where's safe to store it? Valentine suggests - wouldn't write it down; would pick something personal and memorable for me. That might be a question for Eliphus, then!

We bid farewell and head back outside. It's getting later now and the sun once again is low on the edges of the mountains as the short day draws towards dusk. Town is very busy, even so. Even *more* people have arrived! Some are already dressed for the party, it seems. There's really not much time left, and not much else we can do. When we get there, it seems the whole inn has returned to their respective rooms to get changed! Lots of noise of people checking on each other; nervous energy.

We know ours fit well. Bel's costume is full-on! It's a puss-in-boots style thing. Huge hat, massive feather, swashbuckler affair, with a mask. He'd bought it in Ordulin and carried it all this way, not even knowing if it would be needed - and it was.

* We have to figure out what we open-carry and what we hide in the portable hole.
* Bel's rapier fits with his costume and Kindle thinks he gets away with his mace.
* Oswen's staff isn't quite the fit for Zybilna, but she wraps it in a silver riboon top to tail, so at least it looks a bit less recognisable.
* Inafina's staff also gets the ribbon treatment and a cardboard star (!) is fixed at one end - it's oversized fearie wand!

The clock tower rings 4. The time has gone so quickly! We figure the boats probably leave soon. Outside is dark, but all of the decorative lights are illuminated. The air is electric with anticipation. Then someone calls out, "Look!" and the crowd gasps, then claps and cheers. Oswen can't see, so Kindle lifts her up and Orvil sits on her shoulder. The mist has cleared over the lake as stars twinkle in the darkening sky. At the end of the dock, the two winter wolves have appeared, dressed in a full guard outfit - sash, sword, tipped hat, cuffs and more - with a velvet rope that is moved to one side as initial ticket checks begin, people starting to walk out. And instead of a boat - an arching bridge, iridescent colours, appears magically over to the island. Things suddenly look very Fey; the colours, lights and even the brightness of the stars.

Oswen, on Kindle's shoulders and with Orvil's help, tries to spot Dworp. Not a chance! ADV perception - 6,9+1 -> 10.

The wolves eyes are glowing blue as they check tickets. Oswen crosses fingers that this is innate and not a magical check! Then they suddenly reach out and grab someone who was *invisible*. Ah! They can see invisibility. "No ticket, no entry!" they say and the miscreant has to retreat.

Not far ahead of us in the queue, a very well-dressed gentleman produces his invitation with a flourish. The wolves look, but then shake their heads. "That's not an invitation and you know it!" But it's a blank piece of paper. Presumably, it was some magical illusion or something, that was meant to look like an invitation - but they see through that too. Oswen is now quite nervous for Dworp - but perhaps our old-fashioned, pen-on-paper approach is so "low tech" that it passes muster. Closer to them, now, Oswen recognises the blue glow as that of True Sight.

But if they have *that*, they can tell if Lady Zorhanna is a Simulacrum. When it's our turn, Oswen asks them, "Do you eventually follow along to the party, or stay here?" "We stay here until we're relieved by the other two." It's a shift swap. "I recognise True Sight. Can you do that more than once a day?" "No - it's something we're given - it's a potion. It only lasts for 8 hours!" So Oswen says, "Well, I don't mean to be alarming, but I've heard that there might be someone who isn't who they appear possibly even on the staff already at the Hall. When you get there, it'd be worth having a good look at everyone - even the Lord and Lady themselves - given that we both know how important security is this year."

She's not very convincing. But who knows. They might remember it later. We're hurried along, anyway!

We step onto the bridge. It feels as if it is made of ice. The way this is all going, we should have purchased some Fireball spells! Below, glowing fish swim in the lake, along with Nyads, Nymphs and other mystical creatures. The mixture of costumes and formal wear are all amazing. The walk is surprisingly short, descending down to a small meadow on the edge of the island where a unicorn stands, watching people coming in. The other two Winter Wolves are here, checking invitations again. Just in case. Or perhaps for show... Either way, we walk past. Next we meet a satyr, at the bottom of the courtyard with steps leading up; the fountain is running; soft music, choral, seems to play within the garden itself; and as we walk through, the satyr hands each of us a drink from a large cart with various choices and ties a small bow on our hands. We even get handed some kind of small gift bag!

That's it - we're in. The gala begins!



### The Solstice Gala at Paliset Hall

The garden is full of oak trees, with of course no leaves in winter, but decorated with numerous lights and trinkets, and bright lights illuminating from below. A main path heads towards the Hall, but there are lit walkways leading into gardens either side. There's a light dusting of snow. The main path splits to two stairways leading up to a higher level of the garden and we follow up there. We see overhead a carriage, pulled by a pegasus, flying down to land at the lake. It causes some commotion amongst the guests!

There are more oak trees on this level that would've provided a summer canopy over a beautiful fountain, which is frozen - but looks more like it is crystallised; multi-faceted and coloured, like a prism. We travel with the tide of people towards the Hall. Banners fly above the house; all lights and decorations are illuminated; the Hall, like the oaks, is lit from below but in this case it's in a kaleidoscope of colours. We hear chamber music - which isn't what the band plays, so it must be magically created. It has a sort of omnipresent feel.

Inside, in the main hall we see that the chandelier has been replaced by a kind of zoomed-in snowflake. The mephits are on their pedestals, looking like very convincing ice sculptures. There are magnolia flowers all over the ground and people are walking through towards the ballroom. The upper floor is accessible, so we go up, heading towards the balcony; there are wait staff offering drinks and canapés up there too. There's a strange magical effect here - it is as if there's a constant light snow flurry. The ceiling, extending away from us and over the grand ballroom, as ripples and streams of light green, faint pinks and purples, like an aurora, blowing across as if it were the sky. We head to the balcony to look down into the ballroom, to see who we can see. There are a few people up here too, but most have stayed on the ground floor.

Inafina notices that everyone seems very "unburdened". Nobody carries anything. Not even their gift bags; so she asks someone what we're meant to do with them. Turns out there's a coat check (which we missed). So we find a quiet corner and shove our four gift bags into the portable hole as well!

The ballroom is already looking full and we didn't think we were too far back in the queue! Some are large, surprisingly so - two are 9.5ft and 10ft tall with pale blueish skin and very intricate tattoos. Oswen is reminded of drawings she's seen of Golaiths, but these people are much taller. Very beautiful, muscular, sinewy almost, very few pieces of jewellery except each wears a kind of collar-style necklace with dangling sigils. They also wear circlets. There are runes, too, but not in a language Oswen understands. Certainly other-worldly and eye-catching. There are flying creatures, too - pixies and faeries mostly.

Perception, Inafina 19+6 -> 25. Lady Zorhanna is there. She seems to be walking through the crowd, putting on a veil of niceties and grace, but Inafina's high passive insight isn't fooled. The band stage is set up, but they're not playing yet. No sign of Lord Eliphus, but we do see the large, hairy Berengar, his friend and Nix, the gnome from the other day; and then, Dworp/Eggsy. She points him out to the rest of us. No sign of Adira yet. We haven't seen the love-seeking human Kaden or journalist Verano either.

Oswen remarks that we could just Dispel Zorhanna right now... Except for the commotion and not knowing more of her plan yet.

We notice more mephits as ice sculptures, then Oswen says - "You know, if they were motivated to do so, they could turn to attack; and there's a lot of them. I wonder if Zorhanna has something like that in mind, perhaps to distract people or scare them away, or to try and stop anyone like us from interfering?"

Orvil goes onto guard duty. He perches up near an ice sculpture - the mephit's face briefly appears and glares at him but it's not allowed to move! He'll have to be careful, though. He's watching for Adira and Dworp, in case they do go through with the plan to steal the Shard. And almost immediately - he "tells" Oswen that he can see Adira, at the far Western end of the balcony, hiding and observing. It's near the powder room entrance, though the door is closed. Oswen watches via Orvil's eyes. Adira is watching Zorhanna carefully and fiddling with the ring on her finger.

Inafina, insight 19, knows that when Adira and Dworp act for the necklace heist, it'll be a while yet - when it's very busy, maximum distraction. She's really trying to get a lay of the land. Oswen is about to head over intending to deliberately interrupt her observations for fear she's learning stuff the hags want, but Inafina stops her. If she's gathering other info, it's collateral damage. Interrupting whatever Adira is doing could just delay things.

Kindle points out that, if there's time to kill, there's no dancing yet, but there's food down below...

Downstairs, the foyer path through to the ballroom is now a queue because of (what we now know is) the coat check area. We know from our map that there's a banquet hall to the left, so go through there as a sort of shortcut. It's amazing in there! A motif of stars, leaves and winter flowers on the roof, a warm feeling of a fire despite there being no hearth and a great long table piled with all manner of food - with a lot of people clustered around. And here, we see Kaden and Verano.

The food really does look incredible. The chef certainly did a good job. We try all sorts of things, sampling small amounts of a lot to get across all the creations. There are two sprites hovering around, helping people out; Inafina sees that they seem uneasy. She points it out to Bel and he tries to get one to speak under the guise of needing help, but persuasion is only 12. As they make excuses, Inafina's direct insight 15+6 -> 21, and they're definitely uneasy. One glances towards the main ballroom. She makes excuses for the group and leads us that way, saying over her shoulder, "Is it the band? Or is it because Zorhanna's in there maybe?"

Once in the great ballroom space, we see Zorhanna still wandering around as before. She's holding a glass of sparkling wine that's missing a bit - but only because some of it has spilled over her hand. She doesn't seem to have realised. One pixies flies over with a tray of food but she waves it away. Oswen says, "Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I need to have a go..." so she goes up and strikes up a faux cheerful conversation about how wonderful everything is and how proud she must be and so-on while Inafina watches carefully. Insight even higher, 22. Conversation is definitely stilted and, with another high roll giving a perception of 22, she sees Zorhanna is talking but kind of trying to turn away. As she does, the Shard Solitaire catches the light, she sees something; repositions herself to try and see it again - yes, unmistakable. **There is a distinct crack in the diamond**. It's meant to be flawless!

Meanwhile, WIS save for Oswen! A lucky 22. She momentarily feels disorientated but does not fall over or succumb; as she turned to try and keep talking to Zorhanna, she moved through a strange area as if pushing through thick jelly! She stops suddenly and uses a spell slot for Detect Magic, thinking she knows what it'll be - and yes, it's those "veins" she saw, but now they're huge, thick, fleshy tentacles and pulsate and writhe through the air. They spring up from below, and we know what *that* will be. She looks at the room and sees that people just sort of "avoid" the area, because of the psychic emanations.

Everyone sees everyone else looking freaked out and we share the info we've learned.

Oswen can't close a rift. She's no idea how. Berengar used to adventure with Eliphus and he's down here. Oswen says, "Let's talk to Berengar" - Kindle looks around and points the way. As she heads there, ADV Arcana 10,16+10->26. Lots of magic obviously! Mephits are using some magic to look like ice sculptures. Lots and lots of illusion but a surprise of transmutation - physical manifestations of constructions. **When she approaches Berengar, she sees bracers on his arms at her eye level - very magical - enchanted to prevent the wearer from changing shape. A flash of insight. He's werewolf.**

She enquires as politely as she can... She's half-right at werewolf! "Were-bear?" and he winks. She then gets into the real conversation - the rift - Berengar pulls us to one side to avoid a panic! - Oswen gives the short version; but Inafina tugs on her sleeve - Zorhanna is making a bee line towards us! She politely basically tries to disrupt our conversation; and then asks where her husband is. "I haven't seen him tonight. Have you?" - he says no, hoping to ask *her* where he was. "Funny" she says "for him not to make an appearance at our party; I shall send someone to look for him" - Oswen says, "We could look!" she looks down. "And who are you?!" - Oswen introduces us. To her great surprise, Zorhanna agrees; "Shall I describe him?" "Yes please!" And she does. We must tell him that he really should be with the guests.

Our first thought is the guest bedroom. We can get through coat check "in reverse" OK, so we go that way just to have a look pretty much. As we pass, we see Oren and one other staff member frantically tagging and taking bags. That's good - Oren will be there a while. We know where he'll be for some time!

We go upstairs then try to access the guest bedroom. Three of the party stand nonchalantly at the corridor to block it while Oswen (stealth 18) sneaks in. She politely knocks on the door. "It's Oswen - are you in there?"

The door opens. Lord Eliphus is there, in a rich blue coat, trimmed white beard; he's fully dressed up, a bit like Beast in the Disney cartoon version of Beauty And The Beast. "Looking to escape the crowds? I get that. You can hide in here with me if you like." Oswen sighs, goes inside, reaches to take his hand. "You really do look spectacular. I'm so sorry that it's in such difficult circumstances." "That's very kind of you." She sees a bangle with similar magic to Berengar's.

Some more smalltalk. There's a painting in the room that he points at - "That was us!" - lady Zorhanna, younger and very beautiful, a reddish-brown grizzly bear to one side, a polar bear to the other. Oswen laughs and says, "How wonderful! What a curious adventuring group. But then I suppose we all are, in our own ways."

Oswen mentions Zorhanna wants him. She starts talking about the rift, but he puts his finger to his lips and looks up at the ceiling and around the room - Oswen realises; Scrying. Zorhanna can do that. Oh! And she can detect thoughts too and Oswen hasn't been at all careful about that.

In the end Oswen risks Message, hoping that Zorhanna is too far to use Detect Thoughts for that and being confident Scrying won't catch it. The TL;DR is:

* He doesn't know if he should push the panic button
* The simulacrum Zorhanna might hurt people if things don't go to plan
* He's been hiding away in case she realises he knows something is wrong
* Perhaps the tendrils are the real Zorhanna trying to escape? Perhaps the bad guy? Likewise, the shard crack; we don't know.

The conversation is wrapping up, when Orvil punches through and says "Adira is moving". Oswen excuses herself; Eliphus will head downstairs. The party goes over to the balcony. Orvil says she'd gone to the stairs. We're about to look, when the band start their act - "Good evening Paliset Hall!" - and off they go!

Inafina perception 19+6->25. Adira has reached the main ballroom. She walks towards three beautiful looking female elves - possibly the most beautiful elves Inafina has ever seen. She points them out to us. They were form-fitting long gowns, very elegant but somehow "old fashioned". Almost - sexy?! The three of them have glasses of wine. Adira has chat, then peels away. The three retreat into the crowd.

**"Oh the *hells*" says Oswen. "How did *they* get in? That's *GOT* to be the coven!"**

(Adira does at least then go to meet up with Eggsy).

And that's despite True Sight for the wolves... Something transmutation. Dispel Magic faded a while ago... Polymorph? On themselves? Oswen HIS 21, *if* it's polymorph then something odd is going on - it could perhaps be a potion - because otherwise they'd need to concentrate, they are *changed*, they *become* these elves effectively; but these hags are "themselves". But those "stop you changing shape" items - that would delay the hags, perhaps; they have their own minds; we'll have to trick them into it, probably; but that means we need to get them off Berengar and Eliphus.

* Get the bracers
* Somehow get the hags to wear them
* Hope this delays them from acting if we *do* get the Shard removed
* Hope this delays them from acting in other ways, fucking up the party and causing Zorhanna to go nuts as feared by Eliphus

No time to lose! Kindle spots Berengar; we head down and he leads us that way through the crowd. As we do, though, we walk past the two golaith-like creatures. They seem to be holding court. We overhear their plane's name, **Prometiia**. Oswen calls up, "Hi! Um - down here! Yes! Wow, we have what we call goliaths where I come from, look similar, but nowhere near as big and strong. You must be amazing in a fight!" They say that they had heard some of their kind made it to other planes. They start explaining something that sounds interesting - "...there are records of a group who went to this plane..." - but she realises she *must* hurry with Berengar. As politely as she can, she says she has an urgent meeting with a friend and was just passing by but she *is* very interested and *will* come back later to finish the conversation.

We get to Berengar - "Us again!" - and it takes very little to convince him that we need the bracelets. It's ages from the full moon! As he takes off the bracers, they turn back into bracelets, looking more like Eliphus's. *That* is helpful - our deception can be based around (say) the three "elves" completing an outfit.

Now we need Eliphus! Kindle perception - nat 20! + 4 -> 24. Rats! He's with Zorhanna. He also sees, though, that Adira is chatting to Eggsy; the three "elves" are in the corner near the banquet hall, watching - interestingly - Zorhanna. Kindle tells the group and Oswen risks Message to Eliphus - "Sorry to interrupt, we need to speak, quite urgent, apologies, Eastern ballroom". "What do you need?" "The shape change protection bangle. Sorry, not enough words to explain, trust me!" "I can't leave her side yet. Can someone brush past me at all?" Oswen sends back basically, "LOL, our pleasure! Be with you soon." Kindle sees him fiddling with the bangle, just sliding it off, holding it at his side. Oswen explains and Bel swings into action.

Bel brushes past - a solid 24 on SOH! - very easily palms the bangle, without Zorhanna suspecting a thing. He returns with a big grin! "Good work! Now we need a story for the fake elves, to convince them to wear the bangles and they mustn't suspect or if they try to drop Polymorph and can't, the bangles must be the first thing they take off."

Now we discuss ideas on how to get the hags to wear these bracelets. Our best idea is to enlist Oren, to tell them that they've won "most beautiful" and these bangles mark them as the winners for Zorhanna and Eliphus, who (obviously) can't possibly be interrupted mid-party.

Suddenly, the band gets to a break. Inafina and Kindle have a rapport. Inafina, insight 19, Oren is well known to us. But the band could help. So the band could announce that they are the most striking in the crowd, and would love them to dance - beautiful gold bangles as a 'thank you'. OK, so, we try that first. We move to intercept Yalara as they move to break. As we head that way, Oswen grabs four drinks glasses to give to them. They see us and wave; we get to them and hand out drinks, usual pleasantries (!) but then we get down to it... ADV persuasion, we don't lie, explain about the hags, dirty 20 persuasion - we hand over the bangles, and get out of their way... And wait.

We retreat back to near a wall, out of the way of the dancers. Kindle notices, given he's so tall, that Eliphus is giving our group a "look" and raised eyebrow. He points that out to Oswen. Oswen casts Message, "The band will announce three striking people in the crowd, ask them to dance and gift them bangles, can you help?" "Curious... But... Sure, that sounds easy enough."

After a while, the band returns back - they use a sort of sending stone to amplify their announcements (yes, it's basically a mic and speakers! - "We have something special to announce!" - which catches Zorhanna's attention and some staff, but people are busy and just shrug it off. "We have a waltz coming up next and would love to announce any trios of dancers to join us?" - they look around, making a show of asking for takers; at this, Eliphus heads to the stage, excusing himself from Zorhanna and adds his weight - "happens" to see three elves and invites them up, but he finds another group of three first.

And so it begins - a waltz starts. Eliphus takes the bracelets from us quietly while this happens, and eventually in "smalltalk" gives those to the elves. He gives little gifts to the other trio too - it seems he just carries such things. The mark of a seasoned host - "he's so thoughtful!", they would think! Once that's done, the ice broken, more people dance, some chat to the elves - it's distraction and diffusion. Perfect. Zorhanna, when Eliphus returns, seems angered somewhat, but it doesn't escalate.

Inafina sees Eggsy and Adira circling the room, splitting apart. She whispers to Kindle and points it out, then to Oswen, saying, "they may be looking to make their move..." and Oswen gets Orvil on high alert to keep track. Are they actually going to make a beeline? Inafina very good insight - 19 + 6 -> 25 - but it's unmistakable. Slow, crafted, moving naturally through the crowd. "We need to go!" she says, and as inconspicuously as we can, we get to the top floor. The balcony gives us a view, but Oswen has Orvil. She insists that we get into the corridor, hidden out of view, for the bedroom.

* Inafina stealth 15 + 7 -> 22 (good rolls today!)
* Oswen deception (saunters over, as if not going anywhere special...) 16 + 3 -> 19
* Bel a whopping 27
* Kindle however - not so subtle, stealth 6 + 4, 10

...but the rest of us manage to cover for him, given those high rolls. We get into the main bedroom and lock the door behind us. Oswen stays near the door and says "I have to look through through Orvil..." and starts constantly communicating with him. Meanwhile, Inafina approaches the painting. "Hello Oak!" she says. "Ah! Great! I can tell the party is going! Why are you in here?" and Inafina decides to just ask! Does he have any idea what three digits might be of meaning to Zorhanna... He says after a while, "Can I confess something? I'm merely a manifestation of Zorhanna's childhood friend. I'm not *actually* her childhood friend. I don't have memories. Only things I have seen. But the golem is the main problem!"

Inafina says to Bel, "Well, there's no point waiting...!" - and Bel uses the Hat of Disguise. Oak is very surprised! We explain about the hat; "Well, good luck!" says Oak. Kindle and Bel head to the bathroom. Behind are some small steps into an adjoined tower. Standing, blocking the way, is a golem of marble. Bel clears his throat and says in Zorhanna's voice, "Move aside!" as he walks up to the golem - but his approach alone is enough. The golem steps aside.

There is a room behind with amazing mosaics. A raised, tiled pool is in the middle. The mosaics blend seamlessly into a huge stained glass window, where there is a male elf holding a sword of ice, wearing a crown and wearing a long, flowing fur cloak, a blizzard around him. The Prince Of Frost. The water smells nice (!) but seems to emanate cold, too.

When Kindle tries to walk up, the golem stands and blocks the way. Bel tries to come back and help Kindle through - hold his hand - but the golem stands firm. At this, Bel returns to the main room and collects the Chime Of Opening. "Sorry, only I can do this!" he says and returns to the room.

Bel with Guidance searches the room for the special stone, but finds nothing. Kindle hoarse-whispers, "Hurry up!" and Bel says, "I'm trying!"

Kindle tries to help; he casts By The Light Of The Moon onto the area. *This* helps hugely. D20 -> 11, nat 20! Investigation, 22. He sees it! "Thanks Kindle!" - in the moonlight, one tile is clearly smoother than the others; he presses it. The water drains. The temperature in the room actually warms up, and it's only now that Bel suddenly realises how cold it was in there. At the bottom of the pool, once drained, the moonlight - still "on" - shows three rotating circular dials that line up with a circle in the middle. 26 runes for letters of the alphabet - *in Elven*.

Could it be so simple? Bel speaks that... "OAK", really?

The three dials, after being rotated, depress a little into the bottom, then whirr around spinning quickly. The tiles in the pool start to retract, sliding under each other in concentric spirals, to reveal a small, octagonal vault space about a foot deep. **SUCCESS!** There's an open jewel case in there, empty; a small velvet "neck" that would hold a necklace.

Suddenly, Oswen - in between checking through his eyes - senses Orvil being alarmed; she is immediately reconnects; Adira is very close to Zorhanna, Eggsy is weaving between people, to get alongside her. As if to dash... Adira then creates a Mage Hand! She slides it... Unclasps the necklace - (Oswen whispers, "Any second now!" and Kindle relays it) - and as it starts to slide, Eggsy jumps up (!), bumps up into a guest who reels back and knocks into a sprite carrying a tray of food. The food flies - it's all slow motion now! - as Zorhanna ducks back to avoid it; Eggsy bounces off, his hand reaching up to try and catch the Shard as it falls as canapés fly through the air! - and *boom* - the Necklace is gone.

Bel sees it. He grabs it with Mage Hand, and starts to run. Behind him, the vault closes and water starts to fill. Through Orvil, Oswen sees people noticing a commotion; everyone is confused; then Zorhanna clasps her hand to her neck and shrieks! And starts casting... Oswen shouts out, "Zorhanna inbound in seconds!" - Bel is calling out, "Open the portable hole!" and Kindle, at the bottom of the stairs, has it open in a moment; Bel drops the shard; and then - a flash of magic.

Zorhanna appears! Initiative...

* Inafina 21
* Bel 14
* Kindle 14
* Oswen 13

Inafina sees Kindle fumbling with the portable hole - he hasn't had time to close it, just to open it, so she runs into the bathroom and helps with that, then with the rest of her movement, runs into the middle of the room to confront Zorhanna. 5ft range. She says, "What seems to be the problem?" - deception 2+2 -> 4!

Zorhanna's turn (oh, crap...) - she shouts "YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!" and points her finger at Inafina. CHA save; 16+2 -> 18 - DC was 17! - somehow, Inafina saves against *Banishment*. Oswen realises with terrible shock what *almost* happened though Inafina has no idea what she just managed to resist. Kindle blocks Bel's view, but *he* sees Inafina appear to almost shrink and vanish, before popping back into view. Frustrated, Zorhanna - with her outstretched finger - simply tries to *touch* Inafina... Attack roll 16, AC 17! **Luckiest Harengon in the world** - and Inafina dodges.

Bel shoves past Kindle making into the room, sees Zorhanna, who says, "What? IMPOSTOR" - remind Bel that he looks like her! - and Bel tries Dispel Magic. But he only has a +2 to Arcana - needs 15 or better. Close! Gets a 13... Wouldn't have worked; but anyway, as he's casting it, Zorhanna Counterspells. Damn... What's even stranger, the spell is "reflected* back to Bel and Disguise Self is cancelled out. "It's all on you now Oswen!" shouts Bel, rather ill-advisedly, and gives Bardic Inspiration (d8).

Kindle is unsure what to do with everything happening so quickly - so he decides, well, do the Bugbear thing. He goes in to grapple her! Attack 16 vs AC 15 (it really is a day for just-made-it-by-one!); contested ATHL, almost impossibly, she wriggles free. "Stay in one place!" he says!

It's still slow motion for Oswen. She digs deep and starts to muster the spell. She grabs the scroll and fumbles a bit - D20 -> only 4! Arcana then 14; but she has the Bardic inspiration - and rolls max. So, that's 22. Zorhanna has no time to react and with a flash of green light, the Dispel Magic takes hold.

Suddenly, Kindle is holding melting ice! The spell is dis-spelled.

Oswen, wide eyed, points at Bel. "That wouldn't have worked without you... Does the hat still work? If you take it off and put it back on, or is it ruined?" - Bel tries. He turns back to Zorhanna, with the shard (uncracked). Oswen suggests a slight variation, a change of shirt ("I got food on it!").

We run down. Commotion! Bel performs as Zorhanna, apologising, she got food on her, etc. etc - Oren has run up, "What's going on, m'lady?!" and he explains about the food, freaking out, teleporting to the bedroom to get changed, realising that was a mistake... Addresses the room, apologises etc. etc. - ADV deception, 22.

Party perception roll. Highest is Inafina, 21. On alert, she sees the three elves are no longer dancing, unsurprisingly. Adira has disappeared. Eggsy is surrounded by people who are helping him, cleaning up mess etc.; so they seem to be unsuspected. Eggsy looks up with fear in his eyes as he sees Bel. Inafina whispers to him and he (Zorhanna) goes over, helps up Eggys and Bel / "she" says, "I'm so sorry, I must have backed into the sprite, how terribly clumsy of me, are you alright?"

Eliphus, nearby, comes over and holds Zorhanna/Bel's hand. As he does, he immediately realises it's not Zorhanna. It *looks* like her hand but it *feels* like something else. Oswen sees this and messages, "That's Bel in a hat of disguise! Simulacrum dismissed; we have the shard" "What? When did this happen?!" Oswen says, "A few seconds ago, sorry about the mess in the bedroom. I need to check on the tear..."

...but before she can act, Kindle notices the three elves making a bee-line for the group. He says, "Eliphus, this might be our cue to move to less populated area..."

Inafina notices too. She says loudly, "Let's get you both to the parlour so we can freshen you up and get the party back on track" and she *drags* Bel while Kindle *drags* Eliphus towards the parlour as Oswen just has to catch up with what's going on! She rolls with it, as ever.

Orvil is still up by the mephit. Oswen reaches up to grab Inafina's hand, so then she can switch to Orvil's view. It's slowing Inafina down so she gives up and focuses on moving quickly. Inafina, in that momentary slowdown, sees that the "elves" have seen us moving and are moving more quickly to catch up. She says, "Let's hurry, we don't want to keep the guests waiting!" with hopefully enough 'edge' in her voice that people get the hint.

As we sweep past Oren, Eliphus - quick thinking - suggests Oren attends to the three elven ladies who "might have feedback - they might not be too happy - please could you see to them?" He hurries off and intercepts. It seems to slow them down; they're a bit blindsided by his intervention and the very polite way in which he's enquiring if everything is OK.

In the parlour, people are there relaxing. Inafina goes, "Yes, and - um - I guess - art gallery, Lord Eliphus, I believe there are some wonderful pieces...!" Bel is fully in method now, a confused Zorhanna, "Where are we going?!"

Thank goodness! It's clear. Inafina and Kindle say in unison "The hags were giving chase!" and Oswen cringes and looks to Eliphus to see if he's figured out what they just said. He's a smart guy. Insight 20. "Oh. What?" Oswen says, "I was trying not to trouble you with yet another problem." "And they're coming?!" - and we explain about the "elves" and bracelets.

He pops his head out of the art gallery into the parlour; we hear him calling to a staff member. He asks them to fetch Berengar and meet in the art gallery. "And hurry!"

Oswen laughs as he comes back in. "Let's face it - surely this is the most exciting solstice gala you've ever had?" and he replies "Oh, you would be *surprised!*"

But then - footsteps - and instead of Berengar, **three "elves" enter the room.**

One says, "Fancy meeting you here". Another, "This has been a long time coming." The third, "Hasn't it now - m'lord, m'lady!" The first then says,  "You bystanders might want to give us the room." Second, "Consider it a friendly suggestion!" The third, "In fact, *don't* consider it a suggestion!"

Eliphus reflexively steps in front of Zorhanna-Bel.

Oswen quickly grabs a scroll from her pouch - it doesn't take long to cast - it's Grease! Right under the "elves". "Run for it!" says Oswen. Eliphus stands his ground, and says, "Go, my love! Don't worry about me!" - Kindle insight dirty 20, he says, "He means it, it's OK!" and then says to Oswen, "But - um - go where?!" So Oswen runs to the secret door entrance and activates it. Inafina, quick-thinking, uses Burning Hands to light the grease! They're on fire.

In the few seconds this takes, the three "elves" do an 'evil laugh' despite the fire, apparently expecting this to be a "big reveal" when they change into hags. But they don't. We see enough to see their confusion, but then we're through the door as one points and says "They're getting away!"

We're downstairs. "This way!" says Oswen and rushes to the store room door. At the door she says, "Whatever is in here is awful and really, really weird - it hurts - be careful, it can injure you..." So we keep maximum distance and Bel drops his disguise; then uses Mage Hand. The door opens.

The portal is significantly larger. A full crack in reality now, pulsating away, running from one side of the room to another. Kindle says, "Oh, that's *bad!*" - it *feels* like the Far Realm is on the other side now, to Oswen. The emanations match the veins she saw. "Any ideas?" she asks! "Why are we here?!" asks Bel.

Oswen sighs a heavy sigh. "Tie a rope around me, and tie it well" she says. So we tie a rope. She casts Mage Armour, for good luck. She approaches the crack. It hurts. Thrums. But it's... Familiar. Something she's sensed before, in her visions. She reaches out. Her hand goes through. She's about to look inside, but then (HIS check 14+4) - remembers Nix telling her that Zorhanna shouldn't really get trapped as she can move between planes, *unless she doesn't have her spell book*. She thinks a moment. Says to Kindle - "The spell book! Just in case!" - so he opens the portable hole, grabs it, hands it to her.

Now she steps forward - Bel shouting, "What are you doing?!" - Kindle holding the rope for dear life - and tries to poke her head in. Can she even breathe? At this rash act, Bel does the only thing he can think of - Bardic inspiration - "If you're going to do that, at least - *always wear your ear muffs!*" - so Oswen, before she puts on ear muffs she'd hidden in a pocket since it was cold outside...

...But as she puts her head in - she's pulled bodily through the portal.

She's standing on a strange shard of crystal. A huge piece of diamond... Some 20ft across, 25ft long, jagged at the edges. There seems to be not much in the way of "up" or "down" except for this strange thing she's on. She feels as if "heavy air" is pushing at her on all sides; a "squelchiness"; there's no sky, just dark purple with strange pulses of light, as if behind a layer of flesh. Then she hears a voice yelling!

(Oswen is *really* scared. Terrified. But she feels strongly she *must* endure this. Figure it out somehow.)

It's Zorhanna! She thinks Oswen is the bad guy! "The evil shows itself! You can't fool me!" - looking in the direction of the voice, Oswen sees a floating rock as bolts of purplish-black energy arc out! She barely has time to react; but she just manages to dodge. Oswen removes the ear muffs - "Wait, what? No, I'm Oswen. You saw me in the visions. I'm here to help!"

"I've had enough of your tricks, getting in my mind!"

Oswen persuasion is pretty decent. 17+0. DC apparently is 17! WTAF.

"...Oh. You? *You're* the one I've been sensing? Can you get to me? Why are you wearing a weird belt?!"

Oswen looks behind her. She has the rope, with a little tail. It doesn't go anywhere. *OH, ALL THE HELLS*.

"Oh. Did you have a rope tied around you?" "Yes" "That doesn't survive teleporting into another plane... Now we're both trapped here! Can you get to me?" but then she Misty Steps. It seems we're stuck here - but then Oswen gives her the spell book!

Zorhanna is astonished; then she knees and pulls Oswen into a big hug. "I could kiss you right now! Do you have any idea how - oh - oh my goodness - ..." and starts on a long confused speech about what she was doing and how strange it was to see a copy of herself; but Oswen interrupts - "We are in a *phenomenally* dangerous place, can we go?!"

We were so close... But, Oswen, CHA save. It's almost an 18, but then the dice rocks back to a 2+0.

Zorhanna feels it too. "Watch out!" she calls, but too late. A strange kid of blast, but slow, as if someone is pushing against us, pushes in from different directions. A presence is felt in Oswen's mind - the one she felt before, the "thing" that's trying to escape. But this time, it's aware of her and Zorhanna. She's learned to resist it but Oswen has not. She takes 7 more damage. "I have a headache!" but Zorhanna counters, "I need you to buy me some time while I cast this spell..." - and starts flipping through her book.

Oswen notices a familiar ability; ah, her spell book is awakened too!

A distraction, you say? Oswen casts Scorching Rays out in three directions. CRIT! 20+10 -> 30, and what's more, 4d6 each - an unbelievable 6,6,6,6. Max damage. 24 each - 72 - and *all* hit. It explodes in light and fire - and then, in a shock of realisation, Oswen realises what this is. This realm is a creature. One, collossal creature. This isn't a pocket dimension - it's a space, a void the creature has created inside itself, a biologically formed trap.

She throws out some rays of frost for good measure ("getting there!" shouts Zorhanna).

Suddenly, Oswen gets the distinct feeling that something ("it") is looking at her. Flying out from an area she hit are three strange spectres, emanations of the psyche. The visual is sort of like fast moving amoeba! Shapeless, shifting, formless. Zorhanna calls, "Just a few more seconds!"

"A few". Right-o.

Oswen fires again. What? **Another crit** - 17 damage each this time, one hit per creature. They merge and split, merge and split, screech, slow down, regroup... It's very confusing. But now, even more is moving - another "pressure" attack. CHA save. Only 12+0. 4 more damage, could be worse. She gets ready for upping to L3 rays, L2 exhausted, when suddenly Zorhanna says, "Hold on to me!" and Oswen grabs a hand. It's taken about a minute all-in.

Zorhanna _throws_ runes outwards. Space folds, collapses in around us; then we suddenly emerge in the *same room as the rift*. The rift is between us and the door. "Don't touch it!" says Oswen; "duck around" and she's about to run under it when Zorhanna grabs her and Dimension Doors to the other side.

It's been for us less than minute. A very surprised Kindle is gripping the end of the rope, but it's not taut; it looks like the others couldn't talk him out of letting go. He looks distraught, staring at the other end of the rope, severed. Oswen says, "Hi, we're back" - all she can think of - "YOU'RE ALIVE!" he cries, grabs hold of her into a big hug, still holding the rope. "I thought I'd lost you!" "Almost, but the spell book was the key." Then Oswen turns to Bel and says, "I'm sorry, that was dangerous and rash - *again* - next time, I'll listen to you. But at least it worked..." - she points to Zorhanna - "that's the real deal!"

We quickly start to "walk and talk". Zorhanna realises that the Shard power has been coming from and so-on. Then we mention - "don't know if it's still happening, but Eliphus is also fighting those three hags upstairs..." "WHAT?!" - she runs ahead!

We get up into the art gallery. As we run in, we see Berengar and Eliphus in bear form - **the hags have put out the fire, removed the bangles and turned into their true forms and are attacking**.

Initiative!

* Inafina 18
* Bel 14
* Kindle 11
* Oswen 10

Inafina sees Zorhanna is preparing some kind of spell, but it's not quite ready yet; so she takes the opportunity and runs up to a nearest hag, then attacks with the staff. She misses, and would miss again but for some inspiration; she gets a two-handed strike with one charge on the staff for 5+5+5 -> all taken, 15 damage, plus spends a Ki point to try and stun; CON 14 save is failed, so the stun works. For good measure she swings for an unarmed strike but misses wildly, despite the hag being stunned - she's a bit off-balance with the excitement of it all!

Now Zorhanna finishes her spell; a globe of frost appears around her - she seems to be using it for protection (perhaps Oswen might recognise Globe Of Invulnerability in due course). She moves behind Eliphus-bear for some additional cover.

Bel gets up the stairs and into the nearest corner of the room. He pulls out a playing card and throws it, to cast L3 Shatter into the middle of the group of hags. It's a perfect space - the hags are within the 10ft radius, with the bears just outside on either side. CON 15 saves all round; 4d8 -> 22 potential; from his perspective, the leftmost hag fails, despite saving advantage; the middle one succeeds; and the one Inafina stunned despite still having advantage (since it's a CON save, not STR or DEX) also fails, so the first and third take 22 and the middle takes 11. As a bonus, he grants Inafina bardic inspiration (Oswen just still has hers).

Kindle realises he's a bit too far away from the hags (he's behind Oswen on the stairs) to reach them right now; he runs into the room, moves sideways, near Bel to give Bel some cover; he can't attack right now but instead he casts L4 Spiritual Weapon - a rolling pin, this time! It appears in between the middle and rightmost hag; the stunned hag is flanked by Inafina, but due to stun it gets advantage either way; 22 - hits, 2d8+4 -> 9 radiant. He activates Twilight Sanctuary for good measure! He gets 13 temp HP.

Oswen runs forward to get a better look of the room, alongside Kindle. A quick Arcana check; 17+10->27; the three hags have a bond between them - when three hags in a coven are together they can cast very powerful magic. She looks to her right at Kindle and Bel and as softly as she can while still being heard (she hopes) says, "Focus on the right". Then she casts L3 Scorching Ray at the stunned hag, all *four* rays with advantage. All four hit, 8d6 damage, but it's only 21 damage! And worse than that - the damage doesn't seem to even have the effect it should. She calls out, "Rats! Don't use fire." (She then gets the max 13 temp HP back).

(Zorhanna exclaims, "Oh! Right! I should've told you! They're resistant to fire *and* cold!")

Eliphus, in his polar werebear form, seems to have no weapons. So he just runs forward and starts blocking and attacking the leftmost hag, as she's closest. Huge claws swipe out - but annoyingly, she wriggles out of the way of *both* attacks (including a nat 1). He's too slow.

The rightmost hag can't act - she's stunned.

The leftmost hag calls out to her stunned sister, "**Natheria** - snap out of it! This is no time to be dazed and confused, we need you!", then casts Lightning Bolt right through Eliphus, which continues across to Zorhanna; but when it gets to the frosty globe around her, it's stopped immediately. Eliphus (DEX save) can't avoid it at all and takes 8d6 -> 25 damage... But at least he gets 10 temp HP back from Kindle's sanctuary spell.

Berengar acts! He moves in between the left and middle hags and he, too claws at the leftmost hag who Eliphus earlier missed; but he hits both times, for 2d8+4 x 2 -> 9, 15 damage. He gets 11 temp HP too.

The middle hag calls out, "**Esodora**, watch out! The bears are making a sandwich out of you!" - Esodra replies, "**Myrrel**! That evil *bitch* has got some kind of spell-stopping globe! You'll have to use the most powerful thing we have..." The middle hag - who we now know is Myrrel - draws power from her two sisters and begins to cast. Her eyes go black and inky, black veins spread out... It's Eyebite. She targets Zorhanna, who she can *just* see positioned behind Eliphus. Zorhanna, ADV WIS save; with a +6, she rolls quite low, gets 17; the DC is 15, though, so it's enough - the spell's effects are resisted. Myrrel screams in frustration.

"You thief! All we want is the Solitaire back! It's ours! It's *ours*! We spent so much of our power to create it, but you just came along and stole it! We've lost too much time... You don't deserve it... You've done nothing to earn it, awful, beautiful people always taking things that don't belong to it! **Get to us, Thrall, apprentice!**"

As the rant is going on, Inafina continues her attacks. (Oswen certainly notices, though, the 'Thrall' speech). Inafina hits twice with the staff, with additional lightning; 35 damage total; a Ki point; tries once again to stun, CON 14, but this time the hag succeeds and cackles. She used a Ki point so uses the staff a third time with another charge, but this time for only 1d8+5+1d6 -> 11 damage. At least the hag looks beaten up! She gains a max 13 temp HP from Kindle's spell.

Zorhanna is limited by a lack of damaging spells and a focus on cold, or large-area spells that would decimate *everyone* in the room, so her best guess is Magic Missile - at least they'll definitely hit. But least goes L5, so that's 7 missiles - 7d4+7 -> 23 damage - that that does it. The hag Natheria wails and seems to *melt* into a pool of darkness... It's strange, it's rather like waking up out of a bad dream as she goes. The other two hags *scream* - loudly - Oswen in the back of her mind wonders what people in the Parlour next door must be thinking right now! She is bolstered, too, by a solid 10 temp HP from Kindle's spell.

Bel now targets the middle hag, Myrrel, with Hold Person - then at the last moment changes his mind, increases to L3 and targets both. WIS 15 saves, but they have ADV. Myrrel saves (nat 20), but "bear sandwich" Esodora fails and is held. Then Bel looks uncertain - "now what do I do?!" is written all over his face! - so decides to give Bardic inspiration to Kindle. That's all of us!

Kindle moves his magic weapon behind Myrrel and runs up in front of her, to flank her with it. He attacks with his magic rolling pin first. He'd miss, but uses Bardic Inspiration; that's enough. 2d8+4 -> only 7, though. Next he swings mace; hits, 1d6+3 -> 4, he's doing badly on those damage rolls!

Oswen needs something like lightning... She can't twist Scorching Ray into that, she's no L2 spells left and only L3 for this - Chromatic Orb then. CRIT! 10d8 -> a right-down-the-middle 41 lightning damage. She calls to Zorhanna, "Are you impressed yet?!"

Suddenly, appearing as if by teleport, or misty step or *something* is *Adira*. Oh! Thrall *wasn't a name*. It was a description. She looks shocked at the sight of only two hags. She tries to assess the biggest threat; Eliphus is hard to miss in his very large polar bear form. She uses a Bewildering Word - WIS save - and he fails it; he reels and becomes confused, and takes 2d8 -> 3 psychic damage (at least it's not just Kindle rolling low damage today!) then she positions herself between Inafina and Kindle, flanking Kindle with hag Myrrel and sneak-attacks with a tiny dagger for 11 damage.

Eliphus has his ADV cancelled out by the spell effects; he tries to attack but misses twice, again. He's having a bad day! He does get 10 temp HP back from the sanctuary spell.

(Oswen is suddenly struck by a thought - does he even know the real Zorhanna is behind him?)

Esodora manages to break Bel's hold spell, but it took her a while to do it.

Berengar-bear tries to attack but despite ADV (1,6) misses on the first - does hit on the second. 10 damage to Esodorra.

Myrrel is *really* angry now... She moves back, still next to Kindle; Berengar gets an opportunity attack though and hits for a solid 15 damage. It's not enough to take her down though. She now casts Lightning Bolt - straight at Oswen, going through Kindle to get there! 8d6 -> 23 potential. DEX save 

* Oswen a lucky 18 - takes 11 damage.
* Kindle would only be 11 - uses his inspiration - but rolls 11 again! Poor guy. 23 damage.

Inafina rabbit-hops away from Adira to flank Myrrel with Kindle. She hits with the staff and a charge; 16 damage; she tries again; another charge from the staff (it's getting low); another 16 damage. The hag is dissipated. Inafina shouts to Adira, "You know, this is one party you did *not* have to come to" but Adira calls out, "I don't have a *choice*".

Zorhanna throws another 7 missiles out at Esodora, dealing 23 damage. Bel can see Esodora is more or less surrounded but Adira is off to the side and uncomfortably close to him in this small room - so he decides to switch things up, casting L2 Hold Person on her. "Fine! If *you* have no control, then at least hold still!" - and surprisingly, she fails her WIS save. He adds, "We don't want to hurt you! Just stop it!"

Kindle moves the weapon to another side behind Esodora so she's now flanked on all sides. He hits twice, and his spiritual weapon hits too; 26 damage in total; **not quite enough!**

Oswen walks up to Adira. "This certainly can't be helping anything" she says and, since Adira can't move, removes the hag's eye ring and puts it in her pouch. Adira looks scared... Oswen says, "And I have a confession. I'm so sorry, we sort of used you, but you helped to do something wonderful, and now I'm obliged to help you. This is partly a Fey realm after all - reciprocity applies." (10 temp HP restored).

Adira breaks free of Bel's Hold. Oswen's a bit scared by that, but Adira can't immediately act against her. Instead, she looks like she's trying to find a way to escape.

Eliphus attacks Esodora - "You come uninvited to our party and cause trouble! You should have stayed away. It never belonged to you in the first place - you were harvesting nightmares!" - and he takes down the last hag.

Adira steps into some kind of shadow. Oswen, insight - with Inspiration blown and Bardic - thinks she might be showing some kind of relief? Almost gratitude? But she's afraid. Oswen calls out to the room, "Remember, *I* owe *you* one."

The room falls eerily quite for a moment. Then Oswen says, "Eliphus, look behind you!"

He shifts back to his form, turns and rushes over to Zorhanna who collapses into his arms. Berengar also returns to his normal form. Inafina starts picking the bangles out of puddles. Then Berengar says "I'm so sorry, but we need to clean this up right away!"

People start to tidy up; Oswen starts chaining Prestidigitation; Kindle heads to Zorhanna and casts Cure Wounds to lift her. "Thank you. I just need to get through the night!" but Oswen says, "We can't forget the tear downstairs. And what do we do with the Solitare?" "We need to figure all that out..." - then looks to Eliphus - "How bad is it out there?" "I'm sorry my love - you need to make an appearance - say something - on what has happened."

Bel has a brainwave. "We were an act! We were contracted in to make excitement!" - and she asks him to put back on the Disguise; he does. But her own garments are torn, if no longer dirty thanks to Oswen's spells; she casts Disguise Self too, to look "good enough". It'll buy her enough time to get to the bedroom and get some new clothes.

There's instant commotion. **Two** Zorhannas?! Oren is in the parlour; cries out, "WHAT is going on?!" - but pulls himself together. He sees through our deception straight away of course, but it doesn't matter; he trusts Eliphus.

Zorhanna broadcasts a magical "chorus of sighs" as she appears in the Ballroom; nat 18 in Deception with Bel's help; it works - for most people. "The music has been amazing! Hasn't it!" she says and polite applause. "Now I can put on my *actual* ball gown!"

Some food comes past as she's leaving - and of course she hasn't eaten in ages, so she grabs heaps of food. The sprite is overjoyed and flies back to the kitchen to spread the good news!
