# Oswen: Part 2.19
## Campaign day 44
### Baldur's Gate on Vecna's Toril, The Noon Sun, almost 4pm

We're at The Noon Sun in Little Calimshan, Baldur's Gate. Velindra Shadowmantle just teleported away - with The Eye Of Vecna in her head, after Oswen handed it over.

Bel is released from the telekinetic hold when Velindra teleports and collapses to the ground, choking; then he runs over to shake Oswen, "What happened to you? What did you do?!"

Oswen says, "Are you OK? You're not hurt?"

"Just - confused! We've lost it!"

Our plan was for her to take it, thinking she'd try to team up with Arkhan somehow. And when she said she'd never do that, I panicked and I think we all did but I realised we couldn't ever defeat her. And that's the point. How can we defeat *him* with those two objects if we can't even defeat her? So, how can Arkhan believe he's earned the eye? By taking - by force. And when he has, that battle will have weakened him. And if *he* fails, then she gets the hand - either way, they've had a fight and that's going to be what we have to do - take them down, then."

We have the rest of tonight and maybe tomorrow to figure out ways to combat either Arkhan, if he wins the eye off VS; or VS if she wins against Arkhan. She might be right about the city being in peril if there was a fight here and we also need to stop them teleporting away. We might need to find some rather unusual and probably rather grey artefacts in this city while we have time.

Almost as an afterthought, she looks at the silk pouch she's holding. In it are 20 diamonds. Each is probably worth around 5,000gp each. Bel's eyes widen.

She hands it to Kindle. "I've seen you use magic that needs things like this. When it saves a life, I don't care what value someone might assign in gold. The true value can't be measured."

Kindle says that tried to cast during the attack but it failed and he doesn't know why. Oswen remembers that the divination had a "weak signal" to Gond. Velindra also said that divine magic didn't work. We need to talk to Shadowheart about it! Time to go; we have to hurry before the gates close. We make our way back to the crossing. As we travel, somewhat nervous yet introvert, lost in our respective thoughts, Inafina is on alert. She notices (passive perception) some people who look - shifty! We're walking behind them at this point. They're talking about buying goods only accessible from a particular location - Wyrm's Crossing - and it sounds like these goods are illicit. Inafina clears her throat and suggests to Oswen that maybe Orvil would like to stretch his wings in circles above us; then signals to the group that we should get past this bunch of six. Once we have, we slow again, as if "stuck in traffic" again; once in front, Inafina whispers to Oswen that she should "keep an eye on those six" and that becomes the circling Orvil's task.

A lot of smoke rises from chimneys now, in the early evening and it's *much* busier. We get slowed almost to crawl, then a queue, just on the edge of the bridge - complaints from the group behind that the "drawbridge must be up, damn those ships!" - then we hear they're going to split up and try to sneak to the front of the queue. They don't all make it. Inafina asks Oswen to ask Orvil (!) to keep an eye at any who make it to the front; Orvil ADV perception 15; one queue jumps almost to the front, but not all do. The drawbridge is certainly up though - the one on our side, but not its counterpart on the other span - with a tall ship approaching.

Oswen has no view of what's going on and it's getting too noisy for Inafina to distinguish things. Then there's a sudden movement nearby and gasps of shock; Kindle has hoisted up a teenager who is holding some of Oswen's belongings! Oswen uses Minor Illusion to boost her voice and calls out, pointing at the child, "THIEF!" - they to claim innocence; "then why have you got my stuff?!" she shouts back. People are surging forward so Inafina does Burning Hands up in a cone above us, "EVERYONE GET BACK!" and Bel tries to help (but even with Heroic Inspo, Persuasion is only 17).

Oswen "thinks" - "Orvil; stay on that same group as best you can, follow the leader!" then casts Detect Thoughts on the person; they're scared and trying to create a commotion - a distraction. She calls up; "You got past three of us, almost four; a rare skill which we could use; you could be our ally or our enemy, up to you!" - Bel understands what she's doing, throws Bardic her way; she's also pushing harder with the spell (WIS 20 save, failed by our captive); persuasion high roll, 19+0+d10->24 total. She gets a read; surprisingly savvy, wise, not easily swayed or convinced. He has a quota to meet. He spotted her as a wizard - always valuable things in their pockets!

He's stopped wriggling and shouting, and Kindle has put him back on the ground; he hasn't handed over the stuff yet. Oswen asks, "What's your quota?" - he looks surprised. "What?!" "What's your quota - and if you lie, I'll know!" - he has to bring back 25gp. "25? That's a hefty amount. And no, I'm not an illithid. I will take back what's mine. But I will exchange at least 25gp - I'm open to barter! - for your assistance."

He returns the stuff. His mind is whirling. He has no loyalty to a crew. The crowd is losing interest as the drawbridge is back. Oswen says, "We're following some people. They're doing a shady deal. We need eyes that can't be seen and you're good at hiding and you know this place."

"OK... What are you giving me?"

"25 gold, unless barter otherwise?"

"25... Pieces, in gold? That's not going to work! I'll get shaken down! I need to return with items."

Bel steps in. He has lots of stuff from the vampire we took down. A couple of rings are handed over. He's adding up some things in his head... He has more than he needs now.

The kid briefly thinks about running, but we might be good for more. She says, "We *might* be good for more, if you do a good job, but if you try to double-cross us, now I've read you, I can find you. I can find you with a spell anywhere, this city, this land."

"OK! OK! I'll do it!"

We check our kit; we have everything. But we know there are plenty more like this. So we describe the people we saw and overheard, and where they're going. "Oh, right" he says, almost dismissively. "Members of The Guild." "Thieve's Guild?" "Of sorts, yes, though they're not *the* Thieve's Guild. That would be the Flying Snakes. I know where they're going! Where shall I meet you?" We opt for the tavern, Hiltguard. His eyes widen. As he rushes off, she hears him thinking that we're creepy and must be illithids. To him, it's just a word a kid uses for things that get in your head.

We move with the crowd that's surging now, much to the annoyance of the guards, but we don't need to get across. Our inn is on this side. The people were following are heading over the bridge. Oswen decides to rely on the child, thanks Orvil and ask him to come back. We check the inn first - no Shadowheart - so it's waiting game; we go to the tavern.

Musicians are setting up. Inafina hears a shout - "Here! You can join me!" - it's Shadowheart, over in a booth with enough spare space to squeeze in. But we're accosted by a tavern staff member and asked if we'll be ordering food; we will; so a couple of people are moved to another table, then their old table is dragged over to the booth to give more space. We ask for an extra chair in case our strange child joins us!

We talk about the kid for a short while, but then get into the question of magic. Shadowheart hasn't had an issue, surprisingly; Shadowheart hasn't heard of Yondalla though. And that's odd, because Shadowheart hasn't heard of her. And she was off-world when Vecna struck; she remembers other things, but not that.

Oswen says, "If we can find a lot of incense, I might be able to use that same spell I used on the locket to find out what's going on there. This feels like something we should understand. It might tell us more about what Vecna's done" (She's thinking of Legend Lore). But that said, in this instance it seems like maybe Shadowheart just *doesn't know* Yondalla. Simply never heard of her. It seems it might be a matter of knowing her by a different name, and *that's* a matter of history. Bel tries to help out (he has History proficiency). She doesn't think of "hearth and home" as a *domain*, Gods to her belonging to domains; she says she's *never heard of* things like his Hut.

"It seems so odd that it's matter-of-fact for the four of you, but I'm telling you - it's not one of the clerical Known Domains!" she says.

When we say "mother goddess of the halflings", Shadowheart thinks of a matriarch of a pantheon perhaps; like Tiamat is a mother to the evil dragon gods perhaps. So that god might be Pelor on other worlds - "the radiant sun" - the most compassionate of them all. "An overseer god, so to speak! Now, I didn't have access to my powers here either until I went to a building that I *knew* used to be dedicated to *my* goddess, Silune. I went and prayed. I felt connected again. I don't suppose you feel like you're disconnected from your goddess, Kindle?"

"She hasn't spoken to me since I've been here but we've been quite busy! But I did try to cast that spell and nothing happened."

There's a commotion at the door. Someone is being denied entry - but we hear a familiar voice. It's The Child. Oswen has to run over to rescue him!

At the table, finally everyone is introduced. He's **Cleggan**. At that moment, we have to order; Oswen finds a light cider for Cleggan and food-wise we all end up with soup, cut meats, bread, and fresh vegetables delivered for the whole table. Shadowheart whispers to us after - "I meant to tell you - never order the fish! Bad river water here! All the good fish are from out in the sea."

Cleggan gives his report. They went to a building which took some sneaking around. "I nearly got caught. Twice!" - some kind of chapter house, he thinks. Other people were coming in, some kind of bigger meeting, Guild members. That's why he was nearly caught. It's under a brewery. He doesn't think he could readily sneak in again, but he's sure something is going down there, something bigger than the normal. Significant trading! Purposeful, too and they were on high alert, being very careful. "There's a very bad feeling there... Something about what's happening that's not right."

Oswen asks if Cleggan knows if the Guild people have any particular affiliation to a god. Or demon. Or whatever! Inafina realises he's stalling because he doesn't know if he's joining us for food, rather than just drink. She whispers to him, "You're helping us. That means you're one of us now. That means you eat and drink with us, if you want to you. But you can go any time. You're not a captive!"

He opens up a little. "I can tell you something about them... You're not going to like it! They're worshippers of something, which is even by Baldur's Gate standards, pretty bad -" (of course, the kid only knows about Vecna as the encompassing and only deity) "- they're not right in the head! They're like those people that worship the illithids. They worship this!" He looks around, then pulls something out of his pocket and puts it on the table, as if it were the most dangerous thing in the world. A small pendant, but of wings and claws; a dragon; "they worship these crazy, evil beasts; some say they're trying to pave for the return of the gods! These dragons. Most of them were wiped out years ago. I don't know any more than that." He gives us the exact location of the brewery. It has a tap room, so we could go there to drink as cover.

Oswen knows about the dragon war and the thought-extinct cult. Perhaps this is something new, or perhaps - and maybe more likely - these are remnants and, like some people here, they've got some remaining memory of what used to be. Investigation on pendant, 26. Old, but mass-produced; it was made in a mould; it matches the pictures she'd seen from accounts of the war. **This is the cult of the dragon, still here and trying to amass power again**. Maybe Arkhan has something to do with it; he's been in Avernus; it might even be well-intentioned - an attempt to overthrow or interfere with Vecna using the only deity he can reach that might have in his mind, no doubt with him helping!, enough power. But that would probably be even *more* disastrous for the people of Toril.

We thank Cleggan then bring Shadowheart up to speed on what happened. But Cleggan asks if we have more work for him - should he stay around? We don't want to raise suspicions, so he should return his quota. If he wants more work, we will be outside this establishment at 8am tomorrow. He leaves and we get into planning.

* Get Kindle in contact with Yondalla and if works, tell Vi about it
* Warn Otto about possible confrontation with VS and Arkhan North of the city
* Find out more about this underground cult thing because it might be related (and if it isn't, we can just move on, except to note it as a possible problem for Toril in future - dragon war Mk 2!)

Oswen HIS 8, then 23 (via Heroic Inspo). Baldur's gate is famous for certain luxuries - for example, behind the Gond Gate from the harbour there's a famous path leading to a huge building before the High Hall, in the upper city. The Hall Of Wonders. *Now* she remembers. That used to be the Temple of Gond. A beautifully designed courtyard marks a beginning of a temple district of the upper city. *Wonder what's there now!* If there was a temple to Yondalla, it would be there. We just have to find a way to recognise it.

**But if temples are no longer temples, what are they? What's in that district?**

Once we're finished with food, the five of us go back to the Inn. We're trying to watch to make sure we aren't being followed or observed. Inafina and Oswen don't see much at all but Kindle and Bel are better table to watch around - hanging back, taller. Nobody that seems to be tailing us, or people we've seen before. Of course, we continue to be suspiciously observed as before.

Oswen uses the group sending stone:

"We believe Velindra Shadowmantle will engage Arkhan north of city. She wears the Eye. More details when we have them."

Otto responds swiftly. "I'm on the northern plains. Won't get there tomorrow. Going as fast possible. He's not far behind. Feeling pretty tired to be honest."

Alustriel: "Sorry, but glad you figured it out. Mordenkainen wanted to tell you. Thought it would be safer not to. Now for the hard part."

Vi: "Sorry I couldn't be there. Things a little crazy. Will get back to Baldur's Gate as soon as I can. I trust you have plan!"

That's all we get. Oswen Sends to Otto, "Know you're tired. If you need us to get to you sooner, let me know. Do you have Sending?" - "Yes. I do. But trying to be frugal with magic until I can rest properly!" - **so he's not resting and must be getting exhausted.**

We say goodbye to Shadowheart and all things being equal, we can meet 8am outside Hiltguard tomorrow. And there's the taproom to investigate too... Right now, it's not quite 6pm yet. We wonder when that taproom closes, because we could head out to the temple area *first* - an hour ish of walking either way, so provided the taproom is open 9-10pm or later, we should be OK.

Off we go. Across the bridge. Guards watch all the traffic and sometimes stop people, mostly those who are heading towards Baldur's Gate. At the taproom, we check the area out; no sign outside about closing time, so Bel goes in to ask. "Apparently it's last drinks at ten."

Fingers crossed! We'd better move quickly, although we keep a close eye on our belongings! We've at least put most of our valuables into the Portable Hole & bag of holding. Kindle has his mace out. We try to look threatening, but doubt we're really doing that too well, Kindle aside!

Passing Twin Songs again, Oswen notices a couple of carriages outside a building with a sign that says it's a coach service heading to Baldur's Gate. She hurries over and enquires about the logistics. Five coppers per person "to get to Baldur's Gate in comfort!" - six people means immediate departure. Oswen says, "If we have four people, but we're in a hurry, and we *pay* for six people...?" Only takes about 20 minutes. We don't worry about a return service - we don't know the timing. But she hears about some regular scheduled departures, if we can use them.

Well at least we can get there quickly! 3sp later, we're on our way. Just 20min later we're at least at the Basilisk Gate, the threshold which animals are not permitted to cross. Then it's on-foot time. The guards stop us as we try to go through. They shake us down for 1gp on entry. And that really is the cost, it's not a shakedown. We mutter and look grumpy about it but pay 4gp. We're given some paperwork, which looks like it's changed hands often, **"Visitors to Baldur's Gate, valid for 3 days"**.

The lower city is *crowded*. With everyone on foot - no horses or carriages - there's no need to keep areas clear. Even with a map, this'd be tricky. Touts are selling services, one shouting, "tour of Baldur's Gate, special entry into the Upper City included!" - 10gp each! The guide wants us to go through Baldur's Gate. He doesn't want to do Gond's Gate; he seems uncertain; we enquire; he waffles; Inafina insight 21; it's not normally publicly accessible. Other touts around have heard and are *not* approaching. They keep distance. Oswen figures that if we at least get into the upper city then we could navigate from there and this guy can get us through Baldur's Gate as part of a tour, so we agree to get into the upper city - he seems flustered, but it seems he can indeed do that; let's talk price! "40gp, right?" - no way, so Bel barters. It doesn't go well (nat 1!), only 13, but another tout says they'll do it for 8gp each. Kindle notices people converging through, the touts are sensing easy money. Oswen says to our original tout, "OK, so it'll be 5gp to get the four of us and you through Baldur's Gate and we'll pay you 10gp, a handsome sum, to get us there *quickly* and point us in the direction of Gond Gate, even though I know you can't go there yourself."

Of course, there's a lot of noise from all the other touts, who are talking down amounts the whole time. He's calculating how much he thinks he can get away with and is keeping quiet. "*Four* gold each" he offers - 16gp to her 15gp offer - "deal."

Then a child calls out, "I'll take you there for 5 gold pieces total!" - and another tout pushes the kid away. Oswen has an idea. She says, "You'll come *with* us through Baldur's Gate with this guide and I'll pay you 5gp. But you stick around once we're through." And the kid looks uneasy. Inafina insight 20+7 -> 27. They're all running a business (bordering on a scam for some of these prices!) and it's likely that some of them have arrangements with gate guards. The kid was never intending to go through - he's probably not even allowed in. Oswen says, "tough break kid, a deal's a deal" - Inafina whispers to Oswen, "throwing money about like this has got us noticed" - so Oswen adds, "but it looks like we might need a bit of security; someone to keep an eye on things for us; make sure what's in our pockets stays in our pockets." "I can be a pair of eyes... I guess?" "Good for enough for me! Let's get moving and we'll talk price on the road." (Inafina palms him a gold, surreptitiously).

The kid hangs back, but does follow along as we go with the tout. Oswen would sooner have just gone with this kid but the whole thing was just a mess! At least the tout doesn't mess around - he knows we don't need a full tour spiel, and instead does know the exact route, *avoiding* one or two major intersections as he knows the roads there are busy and instead skipping through quieter paths along. It's taken about 15 minutes to get there, and that's with someone who knows exactly where to go.

Near the gate, the kid catches up with Inafina. "I - I um - I cut someone off on the way! Tripped them up, I did!" and Inafina says, "That sounds like it's another coin, I'd say?!" - he holds his hand out - she gives him another gold piece. Meanwhile the tout and guard are having a "conversation" and then we're waved over. "Enjoy the inner city!" says the guard.

Inside, the tout leads us along the wall toward Gond Gate. It's no less jarring to move from inner to upper cities as it has ever been before; we might as well have teleported to an entirely different place. There are even those horse-drawn carriages, which we've seen before and didn't think much of - but now, knowing that animals like horses are not permitted through the gates beyond, carry more significance (money talks!).

We could probably have figured this bit of the route out ourselves but it certainly doesn't hurt to have someone who knows the way for sure. Eventually he points at a small gate, about 500ft away, with interesting mechanical contraptions on it that keep it closed. "Gond gate!" he says. "Here you are." "Thank you, that was very swift - which was what we needed."

Before leaving, he hands us four tokens. "You'll need to show these if any guards come by and check."

We realise there's nothing more nefarious or complex about the access of this gate other that it being closed, and them not knowing how it could be opened. The gate seems private, in a way, but the area behind it, once inside the wall (as we are) is accessible. We can see the House of Wonders - but it's a sort of cheap copy of what we saw at The Outlands. In this "version" of Baldur's Gate, we get close enough to see it called "The Gnomish House Of Adventures" - not a "house of wonders" and no mention of Gond (though the gate is still Gond Gate; it's like Twin Songs having a now-lost meaning but keeping its name anyway).

Signs outside tell us that this is a kind of museum and science centre now. It's been designed by someone who had surely seen Wonderhome, though the proportions are a bit off and it's a fair bit smaller; but we can't judge it too harshly otherwise, especially in Vecna's Toril.

A big cathedral nearby, twin towers and grand stone steps, catches the eye. Two suits of armour are positioned on either side of the main entrance. "The Hall Of Justice". So, a courtroom now. From up here she can see many more grand buildings of various designs, surely religious "before". But she thinks a more humble thing might be the one. Something that looks - homely. Investigation 27. There's a sort of settler's museum like place, close; but then there's one of "Fine Gastronomy" - two crossed ladles as the symbol above the door. "There!"

We head down. It's open, unlike many others. Turns out it's some kind of expensive restaurant! No, we don't have a booking... Of course it doesn't seem to matter. Inside it's almost grand. A marble floor, vaulted ceiling, but much of it seems to have been added - tiles, veneers. Private rooms off to the sides that are now culinary classrooms - once, perhaps, prayer rooms. We're taken through to a dining area. The staff all seem teenage; students, we guess. The menu confirms it - a student restaurant with a feedback card to fill in at the end! We only have a choice of 7 or 9 courses... 2gp each, which seems very low. Bel tries to barter! "We are walk-ins. We realise we are taking up someone's table. Do you have a kind of pre-show offering? A tasting, a short one?!" - this flusters the student who asks for a moment to go and talk to a senior. There's further discussion until eventually they return - "Yes, we can; no reduction in price but me can bring them out two courses at a time?"

OK, so that's all *that* kicked off. We have tea with the food and that's done through a rather laborious process, to stall for time with the food. Bel's being polite... The food *reminds* us of food at places he knows are at their best. But here, it's a bit off. We can't quite place it. But nothing is bad. Some have nailed the presentation, say, but missed the flavours; or vice versa. All that said, they do bring the food out quickly. It's not busy here and there are lots of students, but that seems OK; it's a teaching experience, as best we can figure it.

At one point, one of the teaching staff comes over to check on us. Bel manages to blag a tour of the facilities, saying that Kindle is an old student!

Once food is done and money is paid, we're given the assessment form. It's a positive impression overall, and we try to be constructive and encouraging with any criticisms. And then - tour time! It's so strange; this is obviously a temple, retrofitted into a school in ways that would seem awkward and odd were it not for the 'rewritten history' that means people simply don't question why things are the way they are.

At one point, Bel starts deceptively performing (23) to distract while Inafina unlocks a door (SOH 18, with Heroic Inspo) and that means, as our "tour" continues, Kindle can drop behind to try and reconnect with the deity. Bel is fully into it - naming restaurants, famous chefs, wines and more! Oswen has to slip away too, ADV stealth 16, but we have to be quick. We slip inside. This definitely would've been a prayer room, complete with a nook and raised area just below, but the nook just has a vase and flowers now. There are six tables and a chalkboard. She looks behind the vase; scratched into the wall is a circle of writing that resembles some of the things from the poem she copied in Kindle's amulet.

Kindle isn't sure how to do this. How to connect. Oswen thinks in terms of connecting *magic*; Arcana nat 20 + 13 -> 33. She talks through the way that Kindle normally does this; it seems that the amulet might be worthwhile; perhaps read the poem as a prayer. He get started. A little halting at first, but then he pulls out the scroll Oswen got made and starts to recite more rhythmically (Religion 19+1 -> 20); then he hands her the scroll and asks her to say it with him. She does her best with the old dialect of Halfling it uses, helped by her familiarity after having transcribed the poem from the amulet. She notices the writing behind the vase seems sharper now, as if the inscription is no longer as weathered; deeper carvings, almost. Kindle is repeating the poem. Then his hand, holding hers, relaxes. A soft twilight and quiet starts to emanate forth from the alcove, filling the room. It feels familiar; campfires, woodsmoke, friendship. Then that source moves - now it comes from Kindle! And then the smell changes too; a spiced pumpkin.

His hand tightens again as the effect fades. He looks over; "She replied! I think - I think that did it! I feel like I can't put those flowers back in that alcove... It's sacred..."

Oswen tucks the vase into her bag of holding (!) and says, "Well then, we'd better get out of here before we're discovered!" - she pops her head out of the door. The teacher has her back to them, the others apparently keeping her occupied as distraction. We sneak out and close the door; Kindle feels more confident and says - "Yes, it's a beautiful school. It really brings back the fondest memories - that sense of belonging to something that I've missed!"

The teacher almost gets teary-eyed. "It's a special school. There must be so many alumni who've had their lives changed by coming through these doors. It's bound to happen with a 300 year history! I'm glad you came in. I'm sure the students appreciate it too. I must get back to them now though."

The trophies in the main hall certainly suggest that this has all been here for a few centuries. **How did this get created? Is this a real school? How did this come to be, given that the construction is a temple? How could this be invented by one creature, rather than having evolved - maybe this really *has* been a school this whole time?**

It's only when we see how Kindle walks and holds himself now that we realise how different he'd been upon first arrival here, which Oswen had put down to the strange looks we'd all been getting and the unfamiliarity but now she reads more into it. He seems more himself suddenly.

There's still time for that taproom. We start to head towards Baldur's Gate. Inafina notices something curious; a three-storey building near a market area that's got a sign "The Wide". There's beautiful stonework all down the side, as if a huge magical scroll; **The Unrolling Scroll**: "Books, Scrolls and Tomes - Purveyor of Rare Manuscripts". And it's open. It's around 7:50pm. She is a bit conflicted but says to Oswen - "...well, there *is* this place..." and points.

Oswen WIS save 13, she hasn't been into a proper magical shop in a *long* time. It's three storeys. Rare manuscripts. But what even would she need? And what has Vecna's magic done to knowledge?

She says, "We don't have time. And we don't know if we need anything. But we do know the sword is very tricky to deal with. So, I'm going to ask them for something very specific." She marches off towards the building - Bel is concerned, we'll run out of time! - but in we go.

There's a huge central column on the *outside* that's the height of the building with driftglobes floating around in there. Big stones stairs lead up to mezzanines inside the walls with shelves, T-shaped, but the *centre* is essentially also a giant column of bookshelves with various ladders and walkways. There are numerous tables where people can sit and flip through books. A gnome and two older humans appear to be part of the staff.

Oswen asks about protection from an artefact we have that has a powerful influence. Forced to explain more, it comes out that this thing is sentient - which means (very politely) that we need "the restricted section", do we have a letter of recommendation?! The best Oswen can do is show her employee paperwork for the Ordulin Library. But that's surprisingly very effective. **And she learns that Baldur's Gate has no official libraries and this is the closest to it**. The conversation with the librarian at Selgaunt had been to ask what the public knew and had access to - they were sure that there *was* a big public library. **So that's missing under Vecna.**

We're led up an annexe to the 3rd floor. The gnome has taken an interest too, given he's spotted that we are headed towards the restricted section. There's a section that talks about sentient weapons or another that's for sentient protection. She raises that she's specifically looking for ways to shield against such an item's influence, rather than information about the item itself. "Ah! Well, that helps. It'll be one of these..." - the two people find four books. "I know we're not a library, but we're the caretakers of these rare manuscripts and they are not for sale. You can however read them here. You're a fellow academic."

Oswen thanks them for the opportunity and says that she shall.

The four books are variants on the same subject; the theory of *reasoning with* a sentient object is something of a common theme. Better than nothing. We all look. Bel's help for Oswen gives her 20+13 -> 33 and the librarians roll a 20 too!

* One passage is about **reasoning** - depending on how clever the item is and whether or not it believes it is bound to particular rules, it might be possible to logic trap them. Back them into a corner. But this does mean you need to **understand more about the item "parameters"/bounds** and finding *that* out usually requires conversing with such an item *before* knowing how to trap them and this is very dangerous. There is a caution side-bar about wizards who tried and "found themselves wanting".

* Another passage in a different book talks about **breaking the connection** - divine intervention in the form of a curse breaking magic, to "sever the hold of reasoned madness on the mind". It's *not* a Charmed condition. It's more of a trap. Unless you break such a curse-like condition, the object could reassert control much more easily.

* An item that hasn't had its old connection broken or severed, then **such objects may be able to communicate with their old thrall** if they happen to be on the same plane of existence. Only if the object has found a new person to control is that unlikely.

* Such objects tend to value those who try to resist more than those who succumb because that implies strength. Sentient objects, like any sentient being, crave purpose; **lose their minds**; treat them like other sentience.

The investigation takes 30 minutes. When done, we thank them for the illuminating process and their generosity in allowing us to check out the section. We're also invited back in future if we have any literary needs.

Kindle muses and asks if we think Ordulin's library is even still there, as the librarians say they heard good things. But we took the books! We don't know. Many theories. Perhaps everyone thinks that other cities have libraries, but theirs does not. And everyone thinks that, equally.

It's approaching half past eight. Dash down out to the inner city, trying to see if we can grab a carriage. We have to give the tokens back on the way out of Baldur's Gate; we hot-foot it to Basilik Gate. And doing this, Bel sees a lot of things *he* thinks could be amazing! He wants to come back some time.

We're in luck. There's a carriage at the gate. We're allowed to get in for 3sp and leave immediately. This is a slightly faster run as the roads beyond are quite a bit quieter now. 16 minutes! At Twin Songs, we make a beeline for the taproom. And it's not even 9pm yet! Not bad.

Wyrm's Crossing is busy. People loitering, hanging out; they chat, smoke pipes, drink openly, no police or law; relatively calm on the bridge itself, lively inns and taverns and a lot of chimneys pumping out smoke. Some areas that looked like they were just parts of the bridge are now revealed to be buildings, given away by light from inside spilling out of stone slit windows. We also see campfires on stone outcrops at the base of the arches - there are people right down near the river level, which seems treacherous if the river ever rises quickly.

Inside we think we need to give it a moment to try and soak in the place and see if we can get any insights into any indication of things going on below. We order some drinks just to look "in place"; the beer is OK, at best, but for 5cp each at least it's local and relatively inexpensive. We sit and listen. Inafina ADV perception only 15 total, it's noisy and hard to pick out specific conversations. Some do sound like they might be clandestine / crime; but the more she notices such things, the more she realises that *most* people seem to be talking about clandestine / illegal things!

Oswen (sight perception 18+1 -> 19) - people usually say "hi" to the bar staff as they arrive, but three come in who just walk straight through without being acknowledged and walk through curtains to a back room. The sign says "toilets", but there's clearly more to it than that. Oswen has seen them; she figures - Scrying. She's in a corner with our table; she swaps seats with Bel to get better cover, then gets the scrying ball and casts. WIS 20 save (with them having a +0 modifier); they fail. For the next ten minutes she'll be busy listening in!

They've walked past an old lady handing out toilet paper in exchange for coppers (!); the one Oswen is watching walks up and says, "The green and the black in the darkness of night"; the lady replies, "The white and the blue like lightning"; the original speaker says, "And the red rein over all". Weird code. The lady pushes against a stone on the wall behind her; it slides back and the three go down stairs that are revealed.

There's a sort of coat check where the three give over a series of weapons, some very obvious, some more hidden. The person there might know them as they seem to realise that one has a concealed weapon they didn't give up. It's all put into a crate that's pushed under a desk. From there, they enter what looks rather like a surprisingly relaxed common room. Bench seating, long central table with pitchers of water and wine, a block of cheese and some bread; low light. Some people here wear rather ridiculous regalia - high collars, claw and fang decoration, scaly leather that's not dragon but is fashioned to resemble it, that kind of thing. A ranking hierarchy is evident.

There's a huge map of the Sword Coast on the wall - from a distance South of Baldur's Gate, all the way up to Luskan and across to the Anauroch desert and Silverymoon.

The three slip over to a corner booth and sit. They're asked, "What news do you bring" by someone who approaches. Some kind of commander.

"It's in place. Our messengers rode all night from the river. It is true! **Her champion rides to take Baldur's Gate**. We must be prepared. We must get the city ready!"

"And the wyverns? Is everything on plan?"

"Don't you worry about that! I've got it under control. **There *will* be air support when the time comes** - shock and awe as people have not seen in many years. We will make believers out of them yet!" - another speaks - "yes. Like the black dragons sneaking through the swamp, nobody will know how our strengths have been gaining and our numbers building..."

**"But we *must* sow the chaos in the city to prepare for his arrival; we must take the high guard; storm the inner city, because there is the seat of power."**

One dissents a little. "Are you not forgetting the *three* thorns in our side?"

"It is but a rumour. There is no such thing as **The Dead Three**. An old wive's tale!"

"Do you seriously think that that ours is the only forgotten god in this land? Is it not possible that the Dead Three are forgotten too, yet just as real?"

There's a flash of steel - the person who'd approached has stabbed the speaker! "Blasphemy! You'll die for that insult!" - they slump and fall, eventually lying completely still and silent. It goes quiet. But after a moment someone hurries over and pulls the body away. People - uncomfortably! - return to their conversations.

"Any further questions, either of you?!"

"No - no, we're fine!"

"Good. Have a drink on me. In fact, have three."

"Thank you, Dragon Claw".

Oswen stays with the person she's scrying for the full ten minutes, to overhear any details they might give away while speaking in private. They're clearly shaken by the encounter, though. Three drinks are poured for each; they seem to feel obliged to drink all three.

Oswen HIS 1, reroll, 20 + 5 -> 25. The dead three? Ah, not religion. History. Baldur's Gate had a notorious history with 3 evil demigods or similar of sort-of-death. There was a sordid tale of treachery and betrayal. An "overall" God of Death was killed by three mortals, who then took on aspects of that god's power. One is "god of murder" or something like that; another was "god of the dead"; and she thinks the third was "god of cruelty" - or some other aspect of the death! - very not good. In theory they should be forgotten, but are they gone? If they weren't on the plane when Vecna took over they might have survived, but would have lost most followers.

There are so many strange inconsistencies. Kindle and Showheart connecting to gods. People remembering Tiamat and those gods exist, where not on this plane.

The scrying spell fades. Oswen hides away the orb, sighs heavily and sinks back into the chair. "Can't really talk about it here. But we're in deep. Deepest ever. Proper, big trouble this time... We need to finish up and get back to the inn. I've eaten two dinners and drunk too much! Nothing more to do here."

So, we finish and head out.

Inafina, perception 23. She has heard telltale sounds. We are being followed, covertly. She says, "After all that food, I want some air. Let's keep walking for a while!" - and hopes the others "get it" - but Oswen insight 4, doesn't understand, but trusts. We keep walking. We go past the inn. The person following us keeps going. She says to Oswen, "I wonder if Orvil might want to stretch wings - perhaps appearing at a safe distance, if you get my drift?" - two sets of footsteps behind; no conversation - but Oswen insight 3 *again*. She brings out Orvil at a distance. Through his eyes, she sees him focus in on two people who are following us - in cloaks, wearing the same kit we've seen before; the guild people. *Now* Oswen gets it. Inafina says, "Let's stop here and look at the river!" so we stop. And the two behind do the same. Oswen says, "hmmm, I think you're right Inafina, interesting view isn't it?!"

Cantrip Message to Ben then Kindle - "two Guild-cloaked followers tracking us".

Kindle saw it. Bel is susprised.

Oswen says out loud, "Given how much trouble I've realised we're in, I think we need to find allies where we can, whoever they may be. Hope for peace, be prepared for a fight" - and she turns to walk back and confront the two.

They turn and start to move away - Oswen calls, "Is there something we can help you two with?" - they look around theatrically as if wondering who we are talking to - and she adds, "These are trying times; better to make friends than enemies."

"We're not following you."

"The hells you're not!" says Oswen. "Explain yourself!" demands Bel.

They break into a run, back the way they came. Inafina gives chase. They're heading for the middle section, but think better of it (guardhouse!) and instead head to the side of the bridge. They vault over the side, cloaks extended; Inafina jumps and give chase on her wind boots. They're going in a wide circle around one of the big bridge pillars, under and around to the other side. The other three run to that side, seeing them emerging. Kindle looks to Bel and Oswen, uncertain; Oswen shouts, "Go!" - he activates his Steps Of Night.

Oswen and Bel are running in pursuit and Oswen jumps up onto the side wall shouting behind her, "I'm hoping you still have Fly, right?!" to Bel; he reaches out to grab her hand and self-casts at L4 for the both of us - and we jump together. Oswen shouts after them, "Look, whatever this is, we just want to *talk* about it!" - but Bel isn't helping, calling out "The tables have turned!", with rapier drawn.

They glide past, heading back in towards Baldur's Gate, unsteady-looking, having trouble staying aloft. Oswen tries Message. "Look, seriously, we're not your enemies as far as I know and Baldur's Gate faces a threat, we need to talk!" - persuasion only 6!

Inafina has caught them and they're trying to evade. She gets in front of them and turns, saying, "Seriously, stop, or I'll use force."

"We can't stop!"

"...Right, OK, land then!"

She follows them down close. They're aiming for the shore. It's close but they just make it, pulling in their cloaks and falling into a roll in the mud.

Inafina alights next to one. "I don't get it, why did you run?"

They're very guarded, swords drawn. Inafina ACRO 25, she kicks a sword out of a hand of one of them. The other stands to defend the first. She says, "Well, you're looking after each other... That's something."

"We were just told to follow you!" - she realises they're both young, early 20s.

"And then what?"

"Report back about where you were."

"To whom?"

They clam up. Once we're all there, Oswen says, "I've had a long day and this town is in big trouble. There's no time for this. **Takes us to your leader**. And make it quick!"

They look at each other. Bel tries to look threatening (intimidation, 7+8 -> 15, not huge but enough) - they relent (contested roll 14). As a show of good faith, Oswen starts using Prestidigitation to clean them up but they stop here and, moreover, one asks Inafina to hit them! We realise what *that's* about, so Inafina obliges, 11 damage; it almost takes them down! "Sorry, these days I sometimes forget my own strength..."

"It's a bit of a walk"

"Fine, we've eaten too much today anyway."

We walk along the river a while, in the mud, before walking up onto a raised river terrace area. There are squatter-style villages here and there, before we reach a small pier and dock. There's a small boat and apparently we all have to get in it and hide under a tarp, except Kindle who's too big. Bel uses Invisibility via his guitar.

We paddle out into the darkness. Now and again they pull into the shore, apparently to avoid patrol boats of some kind. Eventually they get into a dock at a bigger harbour. It stinks; the water is covered in floating rubbish; it's busy above. They row under a pier and tie the boat. Notches and handles provide a way to climb up from underneath - this is clearly used often. Up we go.

There seems no need for subterfuge once up-top. It's busy; people working, people drunk, people fighting; rain starts to fall. Oswen's mood is best described as "sour"! But eventually we get to a warehouse that's apparently our destination. Inafina (insight 21) has been watching closely once we're up here, looking for knowing looks or other people being signalled. They certainly more confident and relaxed now. We're on their turf. Nothing more than that, yet.

They walk in ahead and beckon us inside. It's dark. Oswen thinks about the driftglobe, but doesn't want it stealing! But she has no choice; she lifts it high and bounces it up, then lights it. There are at least six people looking at us with crossbows levelled.

"Drop your weapons. Put them on the ground" says one.

Oswen says, "Those would hurt, but it's not enough to take us down. We'll not move, but we're not disarming either. And neither will you. None of us have a reason to trust. YET. Why were we followed?"

"You can't come any further in until we are sure you're not armed."

Oswen says, "I understand. But you must also understand, you could strip me bare naked and I can still do this all day long" - and she throws Fire Bolt straight upwards. It splinters the roof! She says "Oh my! I'm so sorry! I can fix that too! I'm really sorry! But my point is - we don't need to move from here, unless we have to travel further to see someone? Uuum - the roof is on fire now - I'm sorry - I can fix that..."

But then there's an incantation spoken from somewhere else. A bolt of blue shoots across the air and puts out the first. A woman wearing a cloak comes out of the shadows. "That would be *me* you've come to talk to. What are you doing in my city and what business do you have with the cultists of Tiamat?"

Oswen says, "You *remember* Tiamat? Or is it just a story to you?"

"We know that's who they are. Fanatics and extremists."

"More than you know. What do you remember of the dragon war a few years ago?"

"They harnessed the madness of the dragons with a horn. They angered them, drove them mad, got them to attack cities."

Oswen says, "Close enough. We were spying on them. They've a plan. I didnt' realise they'd been gaining strength again; it seems that one of their own - a powerful wizard of sorts, a dark paladin, has emerged from Avernus and rides this way."

"We are aware of these rumours. He rides with a vanguard of accursed from Elturel. They say he comes from... Another place. From hell itself."

"Yes, a gateway he opened to one of the lower planes. Look, this is a lot, but basically - he's coming here to take the city. One of your city's own self-proclaimed defenders will intercept and we intend to help. We met with her, if you followed us, that's why were Little Calimsham. That's where the meeting was. And I scried having realised about that taproom - we have one of our own, riding ahead of Arkhan. Arkhan - that's the bad guy - and he thinks he won't be here tomorrow, but certainly the next day. And these cultists, they're intending to cause chaos - rise up, cause disruption, hurt people, damage the defences, attack the guard basically the city for him to take over. We need to get the word out!"

The strange lady is aware of some of this. They themselves have been trying to sniff out what they're up to and put a stop to them.

* Oswen HIS 18
* Inafina INS 23
* Bel PER 27

Over the course of conversation, our group realises that we're talking to someone who is called **Nine Fingers Keene**. And indeed, one of her fingers is missing. She's not the leader of, but is high up in the Guild and *is* head of this particular 'cell'. Via HIS checks, including things our urchin thief gave away, we know the Guild is a kind of ruling faction of the underworld here at the docks and on the river. They control Wyrm's Crossing; criminal dealings there are, in essence, taxed. They view the cult as encroaching on their territory.

These are not good people. They run thief rings, extortion rings, assassinations, assaults and so-on - so long as there's a profit in it.

Our angle is - there's no profit in chaos. And we have no interest in crime, this isn't our city, and we're not here to change the world order. In fact we want to stop it from being changed, forcibly. Bel plays the card - "If Arkhan seizes the city, the status quo will be broken; but you benefit from the status quo. you stand to lose everything if he succeeds."

Oswen also mentions that the Dead Three *might* be compelled to act. And here, we find believers; this "faction" is very mysterious to them - taking form on the ground as one cult for each of the Three; this Guild is something else. Nine Fingers thinks they're not to be reasoned with. One of the cults is comparatively reasonable, but the other two are fully crazy! Any way she looks at it, she thinks there's no way to involve them.

"So, are you minded to use your resources and do you *have* the resources to both help in defence and maybe, I mean, how can we even alert the Guard?" 

They laugh at that. "The Guard? you really think the Guard give a shit about Baldur's Gate?"

Oswen says, "They make money out of this place. They don't make money out of being forced out it, or outright murdered."

"The Flaming Fist is the most corrupt of *all* of the militia in this city. And that's saying a lot." 

Well, at least we can work on that ourselves if we feel we should. But we're told that there might be a way we can help. If we can find out information on who the higher-ups in the cult are, especially *where* they are, then this could be leaked to the cult of Baal. "They'd enjoy having that target!" she says.

Kindle is getting increasingly uneasy - although still invisible - his hand is on Oswen's shoulder and he squeezes it.

Oswen says, "There isn't enough time to get tangled too deep in this. We have our own fight to help stop Arkhan even get here. But we have the day, I suppose. We can do our best. How should I contact you, if we have information? I'd prefer to avoid burning spells!"

"You are already in contact with one of our aspiring young members... He can always get a message to me."

"Ah, yes. Well, that works. OK, so, have we answered your questions about why we're here satisfactorily?"

"Satisfactorily? No. But it will have to do! Neither of us have time to waste if what you say is true. I will need to verify it myself."

"Do what you must."

Nine Fingers turns to the other two. "As for the two of *you*..."

But Oswen interjects to finish the sentence, saying "...*you* were very smart in bringing this group here, else we wouldn't have had all of this information we now have!"

"Ha! All the same..." says Nine Fingers, "...dock duty for the next week!".

Then she does something unexpected. "You think it's cheap keeping all of these urchins and dispossessed and unwanted housed and fed? Paying of all of the Flaming Fist guards and city watch and mercenaries? Baldur's Gate answers to only one law and that is the law of the coin. Without it you have nothing. No power. With it, you can achieve anything. It's what this entire city is built on."

She turns to someone. "Fix the roof!" - and walks off.

Oswen says, "Sorry about the dock duty..." and starts to leave the way we came in. So we get back onto the dock. Well, now what! Bel says, "rats. We're so far away from a warm bed." Amen. It's a long walk home.

We trudge along and Oswen fills in the details for bits of that conversation that wouldn't have made sense given she'd never had time to fully explain the scrying. 

As we trudge home, Bel points at a building; "What is *that?*". It's beautifully lit by colourful shafts of magical light. It's tall and round, topped by a dome made by what looks like stained glass, with lights playing from within showing both there and on tall windows that spiral up the walls. The shafts of colourful light that catch the eye initially are in fact shining *out* through that dome. It's almost a tower, but each level of the building is floating! There are gaps in between, connected by stairs that don't seem to be load bearing. The whole thing is held together by magic, it seems.

"Wow. One anti-magic field and you're done!" says Oswen. But Bel is very keen, so we relent and investigate. Close up we see an animated sign above the door; "**Sorcerous Sundries**". "...We don't have to" says Oswen; now-visible Kindle's ears are are down, but he says, "No, it's fine..."

Fine, in we go. An elf greets us. "Good morning, how are you?" "Isn't night time?" "Is it? Good evening! How are you?"

Apparently this is the most magical shop on all of the sword coast - and so-on and so-forth. Oswen hides her scepticism at the many lofty claims! **Rivalen Blackhand** apparently is an archwizard responsible for much of the collection.

We ask about hypothetically battling a red Dragonborn dark paladin...

A ceramic disc descends, ridden by a severe-looking black-haired gnome with horn-rimmed glasses. She introduces herself as **Gilligun**. "Evelyn, I've got this!" - then to us - "Join me."

Once we're floating up on the disc - magically enlarged - she says, "News travels fast. Rumour had it that you might be through here."

She starts with potions, looking for things that can help with fire. She has three potions of fire resistance. 200gp each. And another one, "a potion of psychic resistance, I have only one!" - 250gp. 

* Fire resistance x 3 - 200gp (Oswen has one, fortunately, so that's one for everyone else)
* Psychic resistance x 1 - 250gp (Inafina has this for now)

Well, we'll take thsoe, but anything else? After a bit of to-and-fro, Gilligun says there's a "very rare item..." - we're taken to another level. She's looking for "...purple, silver trim, like a short riding cloak!" - she eventually finds it. Oswen recognises it. "Oooh!" - it's a mantle of spell resistance. 4,700gp.

Oswen checks her notes and asks about a Psychic Lance scroll. Yep! 2,400gp.

So we have 4,700 + 2,400 + 600 + 250. They have a LOT of incense too, and gem-based ink for spell transcription. So, 250gp for Legend Lore incense and ink? Well, 10 levels; 400gp. 8,600! We can sell Intellect Fortress back for 10% off, 7740, and sold for 300gp -> 7440gp. We can trade a recently-acquired diamond, 5000gp, leaving 2440 and we have that on hand. They're up for selling two and giving us money back - a rare diamond, apparently - so sure; that saves us tapping too much local on-hand currency (given it's hard to access the Sigil bank account). So we get 2560gp back!

Well, that's something.

As we float down to pay, Inafina perception 24. She sees an amazing-looking bright pink and purple - _item_ - which seems to be *trying* to draw her attention somehow. It's flapping. She points at it and asks, "what's that?" - Gilligan says, "Oh, don't mind it! It tries to attract attention of anyone who floats past it. A carpet. **One of those magical carpets.**" "A *flying* one?" "Yes!" "How much?!" "You're interested in it?" "Well, sure, how much?" She checks. "Well I can see why nobody's bought it. 40,000gp! The biggest one we have. It's 6ft by 9ft. It can carry up to 800lb. We do some maths. We're overweight. Rats. Wait! Bel has a climber's kit in his chest, heavy as anything, and it could just go in the portable hole. It's close, but we're just under. We can always throw a backpack into the portable hole if we must.

But 40,000! Wow. Well that *is* "only" 8 diamonds... There's a brief discussion about how we can travel slowly, but as crow-flies and can rest. It's quite the extravagance. But Inafina is quite taken by it and the opportunity seems rare. We've been able to use cloud flight, but it has risks at arrival and departure. Inafina keeps trying to argue its case; "...and it gives us more options and you can read books and you can have tea and..." and then Oswen realises, Inafina pretty much never asks for anything. "Why are we hoarding wealth?" - and the 10% off still applies. So that's 36,000. So we can give 7 more diamonds and 100*pp* back from the sale earlier.

Gilligun says, "wait, hold on!" - and gives Inafina a small card. There is a command word on it. As long as she's within 30ft of the carpet, a magic action uses the command word to get it flying and then after that she can "talk" to it like anyone else.

So that's that! It seems we have a magic carpet (!). And it's very strange; the carpet seems actually excited, overjoyed even, but it's just a carpet. It definitely seems to have a personality. Even Oswen can't hold onto cynicism too long. She whispers to it, "welcome to our party".

We stow things, tidy up and get back on the road - or not; the carpet rolls out in front of us. "How does this work? Do you know the way to Wyrm's Crossing?!" - and to her surprise there's a sort of empathic *feeling* that emanates out. Yes. Picture where we want it to go, and it'll go there. We climb aboard and Inafina thinks about the inn. And off it goes, just like that!

We get up, quite high. Some people on the streets below notice and point, but after a while we're just travelling smoothly and high, in the dark. It banks gently. The sides are a bit curved up to help us not roll off; Kindle and Oswen are a little worried (Kindle feels he's too heavy and Oswen's worried she might stumble off the edge) but Bel and Inafina are completely at ease. It heads straight for the inn. "We might need to find a way to get down without being seen? Because this thing is valuable!" - the carpet seems to hear. It ends up hovering on the river side outside the inn windows. We figure out which window is ours. But how to get in?! Inafina SOH 17, she's able to flick the latch and we get in. The carpet rolls up, flies in and stands itself in a corner. Inafina pats it and says "thank you!"

Oswen mentally notes - "neat, and there's a whole new series of security issues we must be aware of!"

It's late and we want sleep but Shadowheart needs to know about what Oswen scried. She's in her room - but we wake her, however, she's slept in armour! - and we give the short version of what happened. Shadowheart mostly wants to know *what* she needs to do; where she can be of help. We don't know if we're tackling Arkhan "late tomorrow" or the day after, but we don't want to be caught off guard. And in that case, she might be able to help us fast-travel.

Before bed, Oswen messages Vi via Sending; "People who remember an old god can reconnect with their magic by praying at what used to be a temple to that god." Vi replies; "I've heard rumours of that but never had a chance to test it myself. Could be useful."

Finally, everyone manages to get to bed. Of course we set watch!

## Campaign day 45

By 8am the five of us get to the Hiltguard to wait for Cleggan. Oswen is curious about what he might say after our Guild meeting the previous night. He's already there, waiting for us. "You won't believe - oh, actually, you will! - I was assigned a special mission today. No quota! I've been given a job. I am to accompany you and relay any messages you have back to HQ! Well - technically, keep an eye on you, but..." - he tails off.

"That sounds good. Now we need a plan. And breakfast. Where's good for breakfast, Cleggan?"

"I don't think you'll like the places I go to. Do you want to go into the city?"

"Well, we need to find out more about these cultists."

"I know where they hang out during the day! Quite a few go to the **Low Lantern**. In the docks. Never been there myself. It's in the city."

"Well then, we'd really better keep a close eye on our stuff... And each other."

Kindle is asking about defence and spells. The TL;DR is that while we want to defend commoners - often overlooked - we do know the cultists really want to get to the inner city, to foul up "government" insofar as it exists. So that'd be a good thing to defend, if only to foul up cult plans. Apparently whatever this spell is (side note: Forbiddance) requires 1000gp of ruby dust (!). We know of shops for that!

Shadowheart has an idea involving Word of Recall. As we toy with these magical ideas, Oswen explains things to Cleggan.

Oswen decides to update Otto. Sending, just to him. "**You're not alone**. Preparations well underway to intercept and defeat Arkhan. Your condition and position please?"

"He's close behind me! Cannot slow. He has five with him. Exhausted. Must keep going! Hope to be in view by tomorrow morning."

So Oswen sends to Velindra. "Arkhan expected to be in view of Baldur's Gate by tomorrow morning. Suggest intercept battle early, then?"

"I will choose the battlefield. He will gain no advantage over me. The hand will be mine. Do not interfere!"

So Oswen figures we're going to need a way to know when and where VS will attack, since we need to be watching, help *Arkhan* if need be (!) and then attack him ourselves. VS isn't going to tell us. HIS 15. Dragons have lairs; **perhaps VS has an area that's beneficial?** - she is likely to choose something that puts her at an advantage, her abilities amplified, centred on how strong *she* is, since that's something she can control. It does *not* sound like VS is planning to ride way out into the plains, though.

**She doesn't know enough about liches.** Need to find out more.

Shadowheart will do her own investigations. We'll head off with Cleggan since he's been told to stick with us. We don't use the carpet since it'd be too visible and obviously expensive; we'd become an immediate target. We cross the bridge to Twin Songs and pay 3sp to get a carriage immediately. Cleggan hasn't done any of this before and is quite excited! It's busy, but at least we're going "with" traffic as many are heading into the city for trade. We are dropped outside the usual gates and proceed on foot.

We'll have to buy another token/pass to get into the city. We have to convince him to let us do that; he'd rather sneak in; but it's a risk every time. We know it's a ripoff but tempus fugit! 1gp later, he has his own pass. "Keep it out of sight and keep it safe!" we say.

Inside the gate, he leads us off the busy main street and down into side alleys. A very different side of Baldur's Gate.

* Oswen survival 22 - gets a feel for how these alleys connect and how they're used; thoroughfares for those who want to be less visible and places for dodgy deals and conversations! Lots of goods delivered to backdoors.

* Multiple levels of commerce here, but a lot of it is criminal! It's hard to see how this whole place hangs together. This seems to go well beyond the normal definition of a "fragile balance". Sometimes Cleggan fills in gaps about who or what is happening.

* Inafina has her ears listening as best she can but when she does make out the low-uttered, quiet conversations it seems to be in a strange dialect. A kind of thieve's cant. It doesn't help that people tend to stop talking whenever we get close.

The docks are extremely busy. The Low Lantern is, unfortunately, on the far edge of the public docks, across from where we are. We have to be on high alert! Cleggan is good at spotting others trying to pick pockets and handy with a dagger, but only for trying to cut purse strings and so-on. At least he can call out if he spots anyone trying anything with *us*.

Oswen feels like *something* is going on and asks Kindle and Inafina to try and get some insight. Cleggan helps Kindle - 19+8->27 insight - while Inafina tries to listen out, but it's just too noisy (1,3+7 -> 10). Kindle has noticed that one particular ship seems to be separate from the others, shifty, actively keeping other people at a distance and not using any dock workers; hired muscle feel; moving things into one specific warehouse with crates that have none of the other sorts of markings we see from other ships. Each just has a single small insignia stamped on.

Oswen pops Orvil up high, some 90ft, hoping nobody notices! She asks him to start circling and keep an eye on the ship and its people. The warehouse is easy to see on the ground. From above, she notices that the ship is bigger than most; a big galleon; things moving on covered carts. She says, "Far too busy I think to get much of a feel for it now, though that said, the cover of a crowd can be good cover..." - we'll have a think about that warehouse. It seems important.

The warehouse is **Shed 9**, sees Orvil, who is able to fly around where the main big doors are. A lot of security there too - not the case with other sheds. Oswen thinks about that insignia; HIS 18; she doesn't recognise it - a triangle with a sort of stylised head in the middle and three symbols on the corners. Has a feeling of the occult and the three symbols might lean into the three "kings", but the cult are in three groups whereas this looks like just one. Perhaps it's something Velindra has set in motion somehow.

Orvil spots a large door up high, around 30ft, on one side with cranes - some kind of high load/unload area. No security on that one, though it's closed. There are one or two small doors at ground level and all have security. There are no windows, but there is one skylight - shut, and shuttered.

We're getting close to the Low Lantern. Cleggan brings us along the pier, full of signs on boards with deals and prices and so-on. Someone stumbles past, apparently drunk and falls into the water; another person who seems equally drunk manages to get down a ladder to help them out! A ship at the end, sails furled up, is our tavern - "Low Lantern" - two gangways, one saying "Exit only".

"Keep your wits about you. This is not a place to draw attention to yourself!" says Cleggan.

A guard/bouncer at the top of the gangplank warns us that we can keep our weapons but if there's any trouble, "into the drink you go!" - one is paying particular attention to an oblivious Kindle, who is saying, "...I wonder if they have soup...?"

The interior is quite dark, two levels below the main deck converted into one big floor for the tavern. The upper floor is kind of like a ring balcony with visibility down to the lower floor, where the bar is. Signs warn us to hold our drinks in case of "unexpected waves". Someone at the bar waves up at us, shouting, "Grab a seat, come up and order when you're ready". There are loads of signs trying to encourage good behaviour, of many varying ages, giving an implication of these things being put up just so they can say, "well, we warned you!" but that they don't really have much impact. The air is heavy with the smell of drink, very slow-cooked food and people. The floor is sticky.

There are quieter, dark booths with small glass lanterns on the tables along the sides up here. Some have no lamps at all. We look down and can't see much, it's quite dark; Kindle doesn't make out a lot; Inafina borrows the goggles from Oswen & sight-based perception 19. A couple of tables have lanterns clearly blown out and sit, skulking in the dark - one up here, one on the floor below. We decide to try sitting near the dark table up here first, since that's closer to the exit. D20 luck dice -> 12 -> we end up one table over, because there are people either side.

Oswen's not too happy with that so asks Bel to get a round of four drinks (not for young Cleggan) and when gets back, she voices that it's too much hassle going up and down stairs so says we should move down to be nearer the bar. The best we can do there is a long bench table in the middle, which is at least a bit closer to the dark booth down here and Kindle can sit so that he is able to see (should that be useful) the dark table up above.

Oswen goes to order food for the five us and also gets a half of cider for Cleggan. She has to clamber up onto a bar stool to get the barkeep's attention! The whole thing comes to 1gp. She asks, as if off-the-cuff, about the "big ship" and them being kind of - unpleasant. He claims ignorance but indicates a group in another (not dark) booth down here as one place to find out.

She returns to the table with the cider and a board indicating which table our order is for and tells the group what happened (quietly) and wonders if Bel could accompany her to chat to that other group. She asks Inafina and Kindle to concentrate on the dark booths.

Two are sat the table indicated by the barkeep. They wear raised hoods. To her surprise, they beckon to empty seats as we close on them, evidently intending to talk. "Thank you" says Oswen, "perhaps we could offer to buy you a drink?" (perception 17+1->18 - her low stature lets her see a different angle than most, *under* the hoods - these are purple-skinned, delicate features - Drow - and both have one hand under the table holding hand crossbows, aimed at each of us). They shake their heads, "No need. We get plenty of drink here. One doesn't come to the Low Lantern for the quality of its beverages!" (Bel, also very perceptive today, 21) - responds - "we've noticed that too, but that's not why we're here either! I assure you, there's no need to keep us in your targets!" and Oswen chuckles saying, "Oh, I wasn't going to let on that we'd seen those!"

Once we get into conversation, a trade is made; after some to-and-fro, Oswen hands over a 50gp-worth quartz crystal.

"The ship is called **The Guiding Hand**. It has arrived from Waterdeep. But that is not where it originated - it was from far further north, in Neverwinter. It carries treasure *of the explosive variety* and valuables to grease palms. On the manifesto it says, "entertainment for a grand celebration" but you see, the thing is, Baldur's Gate is not like Neverwinter or, especially, Waterdeep. We don't have festivals in this city. No celebration is planned in the near future. Interesting, isn't it? We know one of the guards at Shed 9. They might be persuaded - with the correct documentation - to permit a spot inspection by the relevant authorities, as long as there's no risk or danger of seizure. Were you merely interested in inspecting the merchandise?"

"Yes."

"We have a theory about who chartered that ship. Her name is Orin. She's a somewhat more recent arrival; she has taken over a grand old estate in the upper city - **Old Sharchaster Estate** - nobody knows what happened to the Sharchasters. Bad times do befall patriars in the city, but none quite as gruesome as the Sharchasters! They were found murdered and beheaded, to the last family member, in the crypts of the family mausoleum. Now no-one talks of them, and Lady Orin turns up."

"Hmmm. Did that symbol I described mean anything to you?" (The one on the chests) - TL;DR no, but they've seen it elsewhere.

They've also found it very unusual to hire an entirely new crew for a "pleasure yacht" like The Guiding Hand - with **nearly 100 heavily-armed guards** who then appear to be stooping as low as to carrying boxes around the docks!

The ask if there's any more information we want - for a price. Oswen fast-casts Illusory Script to lay out that Arhkahn rides to take the city, VS to fight, and the Tiamat cult are going to cause trouble. We want the heads, if we can get them, of that cult to disrupt.

Bel has something he got from our fallen vampire. "Oh. *Old* gold!" they say.

The indicate the darkened table on the floor above. "The answers you want are up there. They appear to be waiting. They've been waiting for the last two days. And that's why they've drawn our attention. Now you must leave our table."

Oswen nods, stands, folds the Illusory Script paper as if concluding a deal or contract, hands it to them and says, "Good doing business with you" - not too loud, but loud enough to be overheard if anyone is taking an interest. "And you", replies one of the two. "Now, please don't take this personally - but we will not be doing business with you again!" "Of course, such is the nature of such things." "But believe me when I say, it was definitely a delight."

We return to our table and dig into the food. Bel doesn't know why we were sent back to our table; Oswen insight 14, no idea and she bluffed as if she knew! He asks "what was on the paper?" She has to talk very quickly to explain while the others talk loudly as cover and explains what she wrote. Bel's insight is no better. Inafina had been watching and (nat 20) notices the Drow leave, but in somewhat of a hurry. They didn't look at us at all, almost pointedly. They paid when they left, so must've been running a tab.

Oswen guesses that perhaps the two are leaving town for some time, given what they now know. Or perhaps they must warn someone. Playing both sides? Cleggan doesn't recognise them. Concurs they left in a hurry. He says that this place is sort of considered "neutral territory". Very few people would risk the "ire of the Low Lantern" by engaging in violence here.

ARC 21; if they're sitting in silence, scrying wouldn't be useful except to see what they look like, maybe, depending on her scrying viewpoint. And she doesn't really know what those two targets are there either. Once we've finished food and drink, she says, "well, I think we need to grab the bull by the horns" - and so, she heads off, beckoning the others to follow and goes upstairs to confront that booth.

As we approach, one turns. "What? This booth is taken. Can you not see?"

"Why so unfriendly, gentlem - gentle - folk? - just wanted a friendly chat."

"We're not looking for friends! Begone!"

It's two people, sat opposite each other, at the back of the booth. So she says, "well, we'll leave you in peace then" and continues along to any other free booth. We end up in our original one! So first, she tries Detect Thoughts on the one that didn't speak. Surface only. "Are they on to us? Are they with the cult?" (a different cult) "Surely they wouldn't be so brazen as to break the truce?" - she realises he's speaking that out loud - the other answers vocally, and she hears the comprehension of that - "yes, but they *are* crazy. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't honour the laws of neutrality of the Low Lantern." "Yes, but maybe they're trying to spook us. We are definitely safer waiting here than leaving! If we leave we are open targets." "Shush! Keep your voice down! I think they're sat close by."

Oswen says to her group - normal volume - "The beer's no good but maybe _one_ more?" and then whispers, "They might try and run, and if they do, we pursue - be ready" - and with that, she uses the spell to push into deeper thoughts. WIS 20 save; the spell immediately ends. Very unusual. She hears a gasp and says, "Well, so much for subtlety - time to leave!"

We can hear movement and, "Where are you going?" "We have to go!" "No we have to stay! We have to wait! It's too early, we haven't been given the signal!" - they get up to go. Oswen pops Orvil up above the exit gangplank but they're going the *back* of the ship; "Cleggan, stay close!" she says; and we pursue. Initially stealth:

* Inafina 15 + 9 -> 24 (in the lead)
* Oswen nat 20 + 2 -> 22
* Bel -> 22
* Kindle -> 23
* Cleggan -> 6 (he's about to trip over and knock the drinks off the table but Kindle simply picks him up!)

The two escapees aren't looking behind them. They are making for the stern, and a set of stairs (Oswen 'thinks to' Orvil - move around to the Sterncastle; a closer exit for the ramp; Orvil perception ADV (sight) - 21; as he flies around, the two drow can be seen! They're at the end of the dock, talking to another three people. *Now* she casts Scrying - they *are* talking - and it succeeds; a sensor appears over the drow with whom she'd spoken the most.

She almost stumbles as Infina suddenly tugs her into a booth - the two were looking back to see if they were being followed - and then we resume chase as they start going up the stairs. Inafina hands Oswen over to Kindle so she can speed up, who now has both Oswen under one arm (looking closely at the ball) and Cleggan under the other, but then puts Cleggan down; but he runs ahead, trying to keep up with Inafina.

Oswen overhears the Drow basically selling us out! They've described us and that we're very interested in the ship, Orin and so-on; "and *also* were looking for the 'dragonheads' of the cult. They're up to something! An uncalculated, unknown element"... It looks like they're speaking to Flaming Fist guards. She gets the impression that the two Drow were confronted and we maybe selling us out to wriggle free! Draw attention to someone else. But they might be having some difficulty convincing them though. She keeps the spell up, but starts to focus more on the pursuit; asks Orvil to keep in contact with the two 'dragonheads'. They've emerged on deck and are making for the gangplank.

Oswen warns Kindle, "We might be spotted and chased by Flaming Fist guards once we're out there; if I can create a distraction I will..."

Bel overhears and immediately disguises himself; then he says, "Kindle! Make sure you hold onto Oswen!" - and he casts Invisibility on Kindle (so Oswen vanishes too).

Inafina is a distance ahead and is at the sterncastle. The two are at the top of the gangplank and see the guards. They look around, as if looking for another way out. She ducks back inside just in time to spot Cleggan about to run out, and grabs him. "No no, I have to tell Nine Fingers!" - Inafina says "OK, yes, but wait until we've gone and distracted all the guards or you might get caught!" "But I can climb *under* the pier!"

At that moment, the two we're pursuing start to do exactly that. They cross the pier width and start to go down a ladder. Cleggan uses rigging on the side of the boat to monkey his way down! Inafina looks back, "Bel? Is that you?" - a clichéd pirate is there! - "I hope it's you. Where's Oswen and Kindle?! Oh, never mind, I can guess... We have to go down the rigging, follow Cleggan!"

Bel is going to "walk the gangplank" and it's up to Kindle to choose his route as Bel strides out. He *is* disguised after all. Inafina goes after Cleggan. Acrobatics is only 12; she rushes it and has to rely on her wind walking boots. He's jumped onto a rope ladder on the side of the pier. There, he can see the other two have found a ship further on and boarded it; they look like they're going to cut the ropes of the lifeboat. So Inafina gets close on her wind-boots as Cleggan monkeys his way underneath.

Up top, the guards seem to have decided to arrest the guards. The Drow is trying to convince the guards to look in their pocket; they take it as a bribe; but then, as the two are arguing, a big globe of darkness blooms outwards. It's a spell. There are thudding noises, the sounds of a brawl; then the sensor starts moving quickly, out of the darkness and the Drow flee. One of them says, "We *must* tell Velindra! She needs to know!" "What, that's crazy? She's insane! She might just as well turn us inside out as reward us..." "Yeah, but she *might* reward us".

We won't want VS knowing about the dragon cult uprising, so that's a concern and we might have to keep an eye on them. Oswen goes, "Orvil! Change of plan! Track the Drow, as far is takes. I'll Message you later!"

Kindle is actually following Bel, chasing across the gangplank. It makes Bel look like a very heavy pirate! Bel has decided to head towards the dock; Inafina has seen the lifeboat starting to be lowered; Cleggan says, "This is where we part ways. I need to tell Nine Fingers!" - she says, "Good luck" - then, "How will I find you?" - she says, "We'll magically message you once we're free to find out where you are and arrange meeting." He heads off without another word, travelling fast under the pier.

Inafina needs to get her party's attention and there's only one way she can think of, but it'll also get a lot of *other* attention... She grabs her own Figurine and calls forth the giant owl. It comes flying out at great speed between pier and boat, heading up in a big arc out towards sea then swooping down back towards the escaping boat. The two inside are starting to row out. They're going towards the bridge. The owl starts to swoop in to attack, really intending to fly by and delay them. On her wind boots, Inafina now starts to run up towards the gangplank, calling out, "We'll use the carpet!" as she runs.

Kindle has to spend some time to extract the carpet from the portable hole. This means they're now both visible on the gangplank. Bel has turned and Oswen's calling "Onto the carpet! Quick!", and Inafina seeing this has turned back towards the boat.

Initiative:

* Inafina ADV (via Kindle's daily blessing) 25 & owl
* Bel nat 20 -> 23
* Kindle 11
* Oswen 8

Inafina, full dash in the air (!), but prioritising losing height first to draw less attention; meanwhile, the Owl takes a fly-by swipe at the boat, clipping it, causing it to rock violently and their rowing progress stalls.

The carpet is just starting to get underway. Kindle is hurriedly packing up the portable hole while on board. Bel casts Bless for Kindle, himself and Oswen but is too far from Inafina to do much else. He focuses on steering the carpet - getting up over the other ship, from which the lifeboat was taken, as its bulk is in the way and blocking the view.

One of the two in the boat glowers at the owl, pulls out some kind of item from a pocket, holds it aloft with an incantation and gouts of flame burst out. Two hit. 12 damage, 7hp left. The other one then pulls out an orb and starts chanting. This causes a burst of elemental energy around the boat and waves start to push it forward.

Kindle aims as best he can, at disadvantage, with his heavy crossbow; and despite all that, it's 25 to hit! Solid hit, then. 8 damage, even at this range. And a lucky Divine Strike deals another 8 on top of that. With his bonus action, he's looking to see if anyone needs help. The only thing he can see injured is the owl, but it's too far away at the moment.

Oswen drags the perl for the water elemental from her pouch. She calls on the marid; the pearl starts to sort of melt into a mist and that in turn transforms into a wave, a water column that rises from the harbour. The marid appears on a tower of water! She points at the lifeboat and says, "Thank for you coming to our aid - we need to stop that boat from escaping!" "Gladly!" - the marid puts its 'hands' into the water which causes a rising tide; the entire harbour now has some quite big swells, the big ships rocking dramatically from side to side. The column springs up ahead of the boat, counteracting that wave and lifting the boat on a hand of water. Oswen laughs, "Very well played!" - and then there's rather strange smalltalk between the marid and Oswen. The marid even says it recognises the carpet from a previous owner!

Inafina uses Step Of The Wind to reach the boat. She hits the uninjured water-based spell caster; 14 of the main damage, a full 3-charge on the staff but it seems to resist the ridiculous 3d8 -> 24, max damage, only takes 12. A shimmer on it, of a strange dragon shape, **blue**; she tries to throw in a stunning strike too, DC15 con - and it fails. They're not badly injured, but they're stunned for now. She hits the other, too; 10 bludgeoning and just one charge, again an 8 rolled and *this* one seems to take full damage.

The giant owl swoops in and grabs the stunned character, lifting them up and out, over the water.

Bel hasn't too much that works at range, but *does* have Psychic Lance, so he tries that on the one still in the boat. They make the save, though. "Rats!" - 29->14 damage taken. And then he gives Bardic Inspiration - to the owl!

The carpet is still just inside 90ft away from the held-in-place boat.

The not-stunned cultist has Inafina right in their face. She sees him wield a symbol, five-headed dragon, that it was clutching. It utters an incantation and a wave of energy blasts out. It amounts to a ranged attack spell but she's very close and sees him readying the effect - and she dodges. No damage! The other one is stunned and can't act, just hanging there in the owl's talons. Kindle takes the opportunity to attack that one while there's a good chance! The crossbow does maximum damage plus another radiant strike for 15 total. On top of that, he casts Healing Word on the owl, L2, healing for 15 (so it's back to full health).

Oswen throws L6 Chromatic Orb; it works, but the damage is mediocre (24). Recognising dragons & lighting and seeing fire, she figures - that one's red - chooses Cold damage. She sees a strange red outline when she hits, so that worked! To the Marid she says, "crush the boat!" "With pleasure!" - it freezes the hand of water solid, and as it expands it crushes the hull. The red dragon cultist reacts to try and hang onto something, such as a finger of the ice hand. Doesn't seem to have Fly, and doesn't seem to want to swim! It's reaching for the edges of its cloak though. She's at range, but shouts, "Inafina, he's going for his cloak!"

Inafina therefore continues her assault on the close by red cultist. She hits with 3 charges spent, 28 damage, badly injured; it resists the stunning strike though. So be it. She attacks again; hits, 14 damage, non-lethal; it is knocked unconscious. They start to slide off the frozen hand, so unarmed strike (bonus action) - 24 - she grabs an arm. Now she starts towards the carpet and gets the owl to follow. The cultist is starting to wriggle so it flies over and lets go above the carpet! Then it circles back towards Inafina to grab the other cultist.

So, there's one conscious cultist on the mat (blue dragon) and another (unconscious) on the way. He tries Hold Person. But the cultist makes the save. They're prone. "You dare... Tiamat will have the city! Her champion is here to end this reign of terror! And you and all who stand in its way will bow or you will burn." They're holding an orb. They activate it; Oswen recognises a bad spell cast in motion; Counterspell. Con save 19 vs her DC. The spell fizzles! There's some static that jolts out and the cultist drops the orb. Kindle raises the mace and pounds it down... 22 to hit... 12 damage. He also stabilises the unconscious red dragon cultist.

Oswen takes the orb. And she says, "and apart from Counterspell, I've Gate Seal too, so don't get any stupid ideas about running" - the reaction implies that its magic is all in the orb. That's gone into her "handbag" of holding. She says, "We both know Vecna shouldn't be ruling here, but Tiamat neither. You all had your chance and you lost the war. Arkhan will be intercepted and he'll never reach the city."

"You may have delayed me... You may have killed my brother. But you will not stop the inevitable! She will rise and she will rule! Arkhan will lay waste to any resistance. You are too late! As we speak our forces are unleashing..."

...as he speaks she recasts Detect Thoughts, this time using a temporary scroll she'd made that morning rather than burning her own energies (Master Scrivener feat). A good show up front, but he's petrified! "Tiamat will not forgive us... The plan will go ahead, it's too late to stop ourselves from disrupting every corner of Baldur's Gate, even if we are to fall; but my brother and I were supposed to rule at her side. Be her viziers. We were promised Baldur's Gate. I must find a way to trick these into letting me live long enough..."

She does laugh and say, "Rath Modar thought that too, but according to the history books she *ate* him!"

Inafina comes up. She drops off (with the owl's help) the other cultist and ties him up; she starts searching him for any and all artefacts, objects, symbols, anything! The figurine of Tiamat is attached to a heavy chain, looks like something a *much* bigger person would usually wear. Someone maybe Kindle's size... Or Arkhan, perhaps. She takes that, and keeps searching. "You are savages, looting the dead!" says the brother. She also finds a wand and folded up note. She hands all three to Oswen. Confiscated!

Inafina and the giant owl take up flanking positions, flying slowly with the carpet. The marid will stick with us too; it senses chaos to be made! We take a lazy course towards the Bridge.

"I might as well..." says Bel and tries Charm Person. It works; the cultist falls under the influence. He tells them their brother is alive; we're not your enemies, and so-on. "We can be friends!" he says.

This person is convinced that they're to rule Baldur's Gate as its kings. While this guarded conversation goes on, Oswen digs deeper; it fails and notices that it's failed; that breaks the Charm, though. She's looking for its true doubts and fears about the way in which its "unstoppable" plan might be stopped.

* Yes, things *are* in motion.
* They plan to break into and steal the explosives they know are in Shed 9.
* They don't know who those are for, but they do know that they're present.
* Their operatives are waiting to raid that warehouse the moment the ship is unloaded.
* Then they'll disperse underground and blow up multiple public areas...
* ...including the inner city. *That* forces the Flaming Fist to act.
* This means the Flaming Fist is focused on the inner city and not guarding gates/wall well.
* This should make it easier for Arkhan to enter.

Oswen considers using Sending: "Lady Orin has explosives shipment in Shed 9. Dragonheads intend to raid this and blow up city locations, including inner, as a distraction for Arkhan."

She could send to VS, but that could backfire. The best choice she has to try Nine Fingers, so that's what she does.

A reply - "Really?! Well we daren't steal from Baal's Chosen, but the cult won't escape with them either. Thanks."

At least we don't need to do a "pretend inspection" of the warehouse. But the question now becomes, what is Baal doing with it?

She tries a deception. To the cultist, she says, "Yes, I read your thoughts. And yes, it's true hour brother *lives* as do you. I'm no friend to Tiamat myself, but I'm no friend to Velindra Shadowmantle either. As I said, she intends to intercept Arkhan. But now I learn that Baal are involved. This whole thing is a mess and I'm more inclined to stop Velindra than I am Arkhan. At least he's known for a degree of *sanity* if at least self-serving. I believe he even worked with Waterdeep for a while?" - she senses intense fear, surprisingly; he thinks Arkhan is absolutely, irredeemably evil, necessary to lay waste to the city's patriars, but frightening and uncontrollable. He answers only to Tiamat. She nods and says "Yes, I agree; I'd be a fool to side with Velindra and try to stop him. But we don't know where she is. Where she might try to tackle him. Surely you have some idea of her favourite hiding places?" - but no, he has no idea. These two aren't even from Baldur's Gate and don't know much about the place. At least she gets confirmation that Arkhan will be storming the North Gate, though that's hardly news.

The key attacks do need to be to the south, the temple district, since that's where they want to draw the Flaming Fist. If their plan went perfectly, the patriars would call an emergency session and be gathered in one place, too.

**Demetrios** and **Arganos**, these two. What shall we do with them?!

(Bless with Heroic Inspo and Halfing Look on a nat 1)... She hears some last thoughts.

* He's very concerned that she has his orb. **The orb is how Tiamat communicates with him!**
* He's obviously thinking of many ways to escape. Rolling off into the water. But his brother is here. He doesn't have the orb.

Given she can't trust "the law", she's again got no choice; she'll have to drop these two with the Guild. We know where that is. It's not good to bring a flying carpet in, but we don't have too much choice. And nobody will mess with us, the giant owl and the carpet!

So we visit, unannounced, to the super-secret warehouse, with the two in tow. Inafina marches in one, Kindle carries the other over his shoulder. She calls forward, "Look I'm sorry about the lack of secrecy but we don't have time for this! Where's Nine Fingers?"

Nine Fingers emerges from the back of the warehouse. "You have many skills but discretion is not one of them!"

* They'll take care of the two brothers. We hope they won't be too badly treated, but we're not sure if they could ever shake off their cultist beliefs and so there might be no hope for them.

* Cleggan arrives late, but we're still impressed at the speed with which he did that *on foot* going the long way around.

* The TL;DR is that we don't know about these explosives. We can certainly stop the dragon cult getting them. But we don't know what Orin was going to do. And why was it all so overt?

"Is there any way to contact Orin?" asks Oswen.

"She might be at her estate..."

Well, then, inner city! We also ask Cleggan about doing some investigation work - can he pull on threads and find out more about Velindra and where she might choose to fight? He can, but will need a way to contact us. He'll come with us towards the inner city, then, and we'll see if we can pick up a pair of Sending Stones at a magic shop.

He has to wait while a more private conversation then takes place. This is basically doing business with the Guild via Nine Fingers.

* We don't want Tiamat's cult. No kings!
* As little disruption to the Guild's BAU.
* Too many cults in town. Not good for business.
* People elbowing in on her territory. Not good for business.

Could focus on...

* Can't attack Shed 9. Too much attention drawn.
* Attack the dragon cult after theft and try to recapture things.
* Alternatively just protect certain areas. They have the south-eastern quarter (of the "outer" city).
* Divert *some* resources towards another area; but they're less keen on that.

She says she *will*...

* Prevent attacks in the south-east quarter.

She *may*...

* Help prevent some attacks elsewhere
* Attack the dragon cult after theft and try to recapture things

The inner city protection is a good idea to stop Flaming Fist from being distracted. But that only matters if Arkhan gets inside. In theory that's not supposed to happen at all. If Velindra *wants* him inside for some reason, then who are we to stop it.

So while attacking the dragon cult after they steal seems to prevent less damage to other areas, it seems a more fair option. The Guild might capture explosives intended for *any* part of the city. And Oswen thinks - if we can't save everything, we can at least spread the minimisation of damage out. **We ask Nine Fingers to try and recapture explosives at random.**

In terms of ourselves, a giant owl and a marid "...aren't exactly our style..." says Nine Fingers!

We think this might be the last time we meet; we'll be doing our part in the north, they'll be doing their part in the south.

"I think we might meet again. It is almost home. And it has soul. And it has history, and its own stories. And when you feel them in your heart it is very hard to let go. You'll be back! I have a strong sense of it. I have work to do. Please, you can show yourselves out."

Outside, Cleggan is full of questions. Suddenly Oswen is contacted by Orvil; he guessed we might be here from talk about a marid and giant owl and flying carpet!

"I followed my quarry to a location..." - and telepathically shows her where. It's a small inn, in a merchant banking district. By a clock tower.

"What would I do without you! Thank you. I guess we'll all go together from here."

We commission the Marid to cause chaos at Shed 9. Inafina asks the giant owl to head north and see if it can spot Otto and Arkhan. Eyes in the sky. In fact, we'd better warn everyone.

"Expect Baldur's Gate escalation tonight, Arkhan conflict tomorrow morning. Otto - sending giant owl your way; wave to it if you want to be airlifted!"

Otto responds. "Thank goodness! My horse's legs are about to give way!"

Vi: "Thanks for intervening. I'm heading back as fast as I can. Hope to reach you some time tomorrow."

MK: "Be careful, you lot. I'm sorry I can't be there. Things escalated here too but don't worry!"

Alustriel: "Bigby dug into some old arcane writings. Might have a good idea where His extraplanar hub could be accessed. Fingers crossed. Good luck."

Our prior "connections" with the owl upon summoning was relatively mundane, but Inafina's connection seems deeper. She can communicate with it, she thinks, at theoretically any distance on this world! (2014 vs 2024 rules - magic changed a little in the world, who knows why; maybe we even have Vecna to "thank" for it).

We return to the big magic shop. "Can't believe we didn't remember this before - Sending Stones" - this time the half-elf who greets us takes the business, rather than the other lady. We later learn there is commission and a degree of competition. We are taken to a case with plenty of Sending Stones in it - 3 pairs. "Which one of these takes your fancy?" "How much are they normally? I don't know much about them." The process is explained; the list price is 350gp for the pair. But one is 400gp, made of a more beautiful stone. "Is that more powerful?" "Well - no, but it's a rarer stone. These were made by sea elves."

Enquiring about other options, there are aren't many. Oswen points at the 400gp one and asks Bel, "is it worth it?" "Well - it does look like one of a kind..." - and examines them closer. If put together, on the back there are runes that say, "Song of the Sea". Oswen shrugs. "Well, then, we might as well do all this with style! This and, just in case, paper birds?" "Yes, of course."

So there's a box of paper birds - 50 words a page, 8 sheets, 300gp - and the 400gp sending stone.  700gp all-in. Oswen considers negotiating but remembers that we did give a huge commission to the other salesperson last time. She sells back L2 Locate Object on a scroll too, for 200gp no less; a net balance of 430gp. It's tempting to buy another sending stone pair while we're here, in that case. 745gp on balance. That doesn't seem bad and we just sort of sit on money a lot. So - we agree. Bel can have one of the "nice" stones and decide who to give the other to. Oswen takes a regular and gives the one to Cleggan. *On loan*. She explains the rules.

In the conversation, she learns that if she uses her one-off sending stone, she'll know if any creature bears the other stone - if *nobody* bears it, the spell won't be cast at all.

We thank the assistant and head outside. Without missing a beat, Oswen uses her one-off stone and sends; "I am Oswen. I have one half of this pair. If you hold the other, respond. When I can, I will arrange to meet". The sending fails. She's a bit disappointed - no easy way to find that, then!

Next she examines that wand. ARC 28! A twisty sort of design, double helix, made of copper with an interesting divination rune at the top. Her eyes widen. **A wand of secrets** - well worth hanging onto! Next, the chain and symbol. ARC dirty 30. It's a holy symbol, but no ordinary one. It's similar to Kindle's, but not for the devout; **it's for the defiled** - it creates a connection to a deity. Such a person can call upon their aid. But it could be "cleansed" - a curse removed then a high level restoration of sorts. Greater Restoration or similar. Once that was done, it would have its original pure magic form. She can't discern what that would be yet. Maybe tonight - between her and Kindle. Lastly, the orb. She's never seen anything like this. It's unique, bespoke. A means to communicate **and perhaps to influence**, but she doesn't know it's two-way or not. She keeps it in the bag of holding. Even that might not be enough. Who knows. But it needs some kind of connection to Tiamat to start with in order to use it.

Next, we head to the area Orvil spotted and see if can find the Drow pair. The building is a gaming parlour, not bank! It's called "**The Mark**" with an archery-contest-like bullseye logo. Inside we go. It's quite small. Some chairs, a small bar, a dartboard with one person playing, about 8 people here. We ask about the Drow but we're kind of stonewalled - no response - insight gives us nothing.

We stop for a drink. Over that time, the bartender serves drinks; the person plays darts; Inafina is watching, perception nat 20 + 7 (flat); it *looks* like a bar but the board only has four drinks on it and behind the bar there are lots of bottles but most have dust on them. So *something* else is going on here. The person throwing darts isn't drinking - perhaps they are just watching. A very strange arrangement. "Oswen, your - *thoughts*?" - ugh, again?! L2 Detect Thoughts - then Inafina asks the barman, "are you *sure* you didn't see our friends?" and his surface thoughts are just that we're meddlesome and snooping around but we don't have a clue. But she also senses several people about 15ft below her. At least four - directly below. Surface thoughts; two just in conversation. One "everyone seems very nervous today - not seen quite so many frightened, nervous people coming through as I have today, something's wrong..." - another, "I hope nothing happens before my break, I don't want to get caught up in anything, this is more than I signed up for! Something's *obviously* about to go down" and then they go out of range, after moving away and downwards (stairs). "I wonder if I'll get to meet Jarlaxle while he's in town?"

She figures - what the hell! She uses Manifest Mind. A ghostly tome appears below, glowing faintly. People see it immediately. There's a small room with a coat check and a bouncer. They stand at the bottom of the set of stairs, before another set that go further down. The space is tiny, maybe 10ft by 20ft. So she starts moving it, moth-like path, heading for the stairs lower down. People talk about "that mermaid space, has spectral mermaid - but that's just creepy, so creepy!"

Down below is a MUCH bigger gaming space. A big bar, lots of flambuoyant people and a number of Drow down here. Perception dirty 20. The spectral appearance is noticed. One yells out, "A spy! It's looking at us! It's checking things out!" - some people stand. At least *one* of the two Drow are down here. She casts Message through the mind, "There you two are. I know you tried to sell us out, but you didn't have a choice. No hard feelings?" "Oh. From - earlier? You're the halfling! No we didn't mean any malice. Trying to get away!"

So Oswen sighs, brings the mind upstairs - it pops out from behind the bar - "Well, at least the drinks were better than the Low Lantern" - and floats over to us. We stand to leave. The barman says "Wait, that's yours?" Oswen nods. "And they were downstairs the whole time! You didn't even tell us." "Of course not! I wouldn't tell anyone if *you* went downstairs that you were here." "Well you already know about it, don't you!"

We descend a trapdoor, wave our way past the coat check as the Manifest Mind floats past too and get all the way downstairs. The two Drow stand and come over. "We didn't mean anything!" and Oswen puts her hands up, "No no, I'm aware, we were going to try and help but you did the Darkness spell and didn't need it."

"Something was up. Usually bribes would work! If not, giving them a more profitable mark would work."

"Yeah, look, whatever happens tonight, but trying to minimise the damage but it's not going to be good."

"I'll tell you what - the mark is basically *out*. Nobody down here is taking any jobs. Most of us are trying to organise a way to try and get out of the city."

We look around. There are quite a few different creatures - and she notices a mindflayer there. It's actively resisting her. She makes eye contact, nods apologetically and drops the spell. A thought in her head. "You are not of here. I can tell. You haven't been changed." "Correct. We intent to fight and reverse that change." "It is unwise to stay in the city. Things have escalated. I can feel it. There is nervousness and the distinct smell of chaos." "Thank you. I agree. Leaving promptly would be wise."

We get the feeling that everyone here would be, even by Baldur's Gate standards - kind of illegal. Drow. Duergaur. The illithid. A handful of goblins. Even a couple of strange, slime-based featureless creatures.

"Didn't know what you meant up-top by not doing business again but it being a pleasure. We were worried you might run to the nearest other faction and tell them."

"No. We just need to get out. We've pushed too far and too deep. We're not exactly inconspicuous! Our kind have never been welcome here. But we're all free agents. But... The sentiment has changed. Everyone is trying to leave. There's never much business to be done during a violent regime change. Especially when there are too many unknowns. We don't know how any new overlords would treat our respective kinds here. When you work primarily on the fringes and in the underworld, you very quickly get a sense for a change in the wind."

"Do you want to stay on-world, or change world?"

"We are seeking passage away from Baldur's Gate. We have places we can go. It's just a matter of organising it. Everyone is! It's not normally this busy!"

We are at least able to warn them to keep on piers away from shed 9. "Best of luck".

As we turn to leave, someone puts a fancy red leather polished boot out in front and extends a rapier. "Not so fast!" A huge, ornate hat full of ostrich feathers; a very tailored velvet short coat, a brocade, braided gold rope collar; "We haven't been introduced!" The tip up their hat. Their face is - well, flamboyant. A drow, dangling ruby earring in one ear, painted eyebrows and lipstick. Male. Oswen goes, "I'm going to go out on a limb... Jarlaxle I presume?" "Yes! I guess my reputation preceeds me. You have me at a disadvantage."

We give our names.

Conversation starts, but Jarlaxle uses Message while verbally saying other things, as a distraction. "What *are* you here for, little wizard? I am no stranger to those who reek of destiny."

"The rumours are true. The city is to be attacked. We intend to destroy its would-be attacker. Any help is welcome."

Seeing Oswen's now-familiar, neutral "I'm hearing this in my head" face, Bel figures out that the vocal communication is nonsense. So he steps in. He's very good at saying nothing in a lot of words as a bard!

"Getting tangled between Velindra and Arkhan is certain destruction" - then a pause - "Whatever is going to happen, people will get hurt. I'm here to save as many as I can. What are you here for."

Oswen grins - using her own reply and Message. "You're now my best friend. We're working with Nine Fingers. They'll disrupt the Tiamat cult's attempt to steal Orin's explosives from Shed 9. Can you help?"

"The Guild will double-cross you if it suits there needs."

"Don't doubt it. But we lack the power to protect an entire city. We need help."

"What is most important to you right now? I might be able to see what I can do. No promises."

He explains that he has a ship in port. Some can't leave or escape by other means.

(We're both getting the hang of counting Message words and co-casting after a response, to chain a fairly fluent conversation).

"Can we identify the likely targets for the cult to distract Flaming Fist and cause general mayhem, especially in the south?"

"So that's why you teamed up with the Guild."

"True, so, we've both forgotten the North. And even if we can stop Arkhan, he has five demons with him."

"Ah! Now you're talking. I have reliable reports from Elturel of his entourage! He has a **Minotaur** who is of infernal power. He has a **Death Priest** in the form of a deathless tortle. He has a... Well... **Barbarian of the dark orders**, is the best way to describe them. They live neither in this world nor the next. Stuck somewhere in between. Lastly, a deadly **white Abishai**, a kind of demon, who no-one knows anything about."

Oswen says, "That's four. Is the count of five inaccurate?"

"I don't know about a fifth. Are you sure?"

Oswen says, "I think I need another drink. What's strong, and not terrible here?"

Jarlaxle walks to the bar, nods to the barman, reaches over and pulls out a beautiful blown-glass flask. Pours two goblets, giving one to Oswen. "Sit a while" he says. Oswen looks to the party and says, "Sorry for the delay, but he's such an interesting fellow and he's been so kind as to get me this drink! Please, buy something for yourselves of course while you wait!" - she's putting on a show for the room really. But at that, Jarlaxle pours drinks for all.

"A friend of ours runs in front of Arkhan. Our news of five is first-hand from him."

"That's troublesome. Does the fifth lag behind? Or has it gone ahead? Is it merely not visible?"

"Don't know. We have an owl on the way, very fast, so we'll know a bit more shortly. Beyond that..."

Oswen thinks for a moment then casts L4 Sending, "Sorry for interruption...! But Minotaur. Death priest. Dark Orders Barbarian. White Abishai. Where is the fifth of Arkhan's Entourage", to the besieged Otto. "The fifth?! The manticore he is - *was* riding! Where has the manticore gone?! Tell your own to be careful!"

Oswen immediately says to Inafina, "Warn the own to watch out for airborne attack, manticore specifically. Do that now please."

Message back to Jarlaxle, "I asked. Manticore."

"I didn't realise it had come through."

"Apparently so. And it's gone missing. Look, I'm burning spell resources here. Can't be helped. Got to trust you. You could perhaps take me down, now, if you tried; but it would be unwise to try, so long as these three behind me still live."

"Why would I try and take you down?!"

She gestures vaguely at *all* of Baldur's Gate.

"I'm not from here!"

"So, what can we do? We were going to Orin next to find out about those explosives."

"Bad idea. Orin is insane. The chances of you getting *anything* coherent from her are very slim. And that's if she doesn't just murder you outright."

"Well, any other ideas?"

"If you need to see her... Well, at least be prepared. But hopefully you've weighed it up and what you need is important enough to risk this."

"All we need is knowing what those explosives are for. But if we're resigned to their being in use as a fact, and we know the dragon cult will be allowed to steal them, the guild can't interfere with *that*, then we have to hope they catch as many others as they can."

"Surely she's not the only one who was keyed in on the plan?"

"Well, there is the warehouse; it's broad daylight now, but after dark would be too late... The marid is going to flood it. I don't know who else we'd contact. Maybe we've just done the best we can? There are four of us and a big city and many players!"

"So what *else* did you have on your plate?"

"Well the last thing we need to know is *where* she might attack Arkhan. It's a battleground of her choosing."

"Her choosing?" - he thinks a while - "**I know where she'll be**. There was a huge battle north of Baldur's Gate about a century ago. Probably the largest thing that had ever occurred in defence of the city. Armies clashed. It's considered sacred ground, which is why the slums never expanded North of the city gates. They call it The Killing Fields. There must be thousands of dead bodies buried in mass graves up there."

Oswen pretty much interrupts; "Ah, she must intend to raise them. To use them on her side, but he can do that too I should think."

"Not if she gets to them first! And she has the home advantage. She intends to meet them with an army of undead, before he reaches the gates of Baldur's Gate. I can't say for sure, but if I were an all-powerful necromancer lich, *that* would be my battlefield of choice. A literal old battlefield, no less. She has a lot of magic at her disposal and a near-endless supply of bodies."

"Yes, makes sense. All we can do is keep chasing down the Orin angle I suppose, and keep trying to disrupt or otherwise destroy those explosives. You know the plans now, you know where to avoid and where to be if you want to help people."

"So what is your plan? To stop Velindra? To stop Arkhan?"

Oswen shakes her head. "Our plan is - ..." - pauses - "...poor, and crazy. We intend to stop whichever... Needs to be stopped."

"Let them wear each other down?"

"There is more in play than I can say. Information can leak in unexpected ways" - and points at the illithid!

"I won't pry... There is just one thing that I can do to help you."

Jarlaxle pulls out a strange kind of bullet from a bag. "Are any of you good with these? This is a chill bullet. It interferes with healing abilities! You'd need a sling. I do have a dart version too, but it won't travel as far."

Inafina takes the bullet. "I think I could use that! Thanks!"

"You must time it perfectly. Once used, you only have a few seconds before the effects wear off."

Inafina nods.

Oswen thinks back, "Thank you. We'd better not take up more of your time. I hope you can get people out, or save them if they stay. We'll be trying to do the same."

Jarlaxle nods. "We should meet for a drink some time, when things are less life-threatening!"

We stand, drinks finished, and depart.

(End of Part 2.19)
