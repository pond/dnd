# Oswen: Part 2.1
## Mid-winter
### The three months following the autumn rescue of Zybilna in the Fey Wild

Over the last three months, Leonidas and Oswen have been inseparable but avoided being too clingy! He works at the library and sometimes Oswen helps as a volunteer; other times, she reads, absorbing information like a sponge.

Inseparable too are Kindle and the squirrel at the cottage. Whenever he's around pottering about outside, it always scurries up onto his shoulder. They talk a lot, but they both speak very quietly. Nobody is sure what they talk about. They seem to be close friends now.

On the night the Witchlight Carnival departed, Kindle and Inafina were a little out-of-sorts - unsurprising really, as they felt rather adrift. Thank goodness for the cottage! Kindle found solace in maintenance of a literal hearth, while Inafina had a replacement location to call "home".

We end up with ponies; the road to the town is quite long and they're a good time saver. They're well-fed because they're fortunately very keen on pumpkin!

Bel was like a child on their first day in a candy store. Everything was new to him. He'd spend most days apparently trying to visit very last building in Ordulin! Cafes, shops, museums, libraries - he seemed endlessly fascinated. Unwise amounts of money were of course spent... But, as he said, "We're supporting the local economy" - who knew that people from the Faerie Court would have such views?! We suspect he overheard it spoken in town!

The green, orange and red leaves of trees when we returned to Ordulin fade to brown, then fall. We harvest the pumpkins in lat autumn; Bel finds books about this in the house and Kindle learns how to make pumpkin seed oil. Stark branches silhouette against low sun on bright, crisp mornings, or moody, low, grey clouds. Strange weather isn't new to Bel after our adventures together, but snow is - and on the first snowfall, he delights endlessly in making sculptures or having snowball fights. The childlike enthusiasm is infectious, and draws us all closer.

All is not entirely as it seems. Inafina notices that Bel is almost manic, but in moments of downtime seems contemplative and a bit worried, though. Sometimes he follows Oswen to the library, ostensibly to the library, but - according to Oswen - seems to hang around in areas about the Fey and Fey Wild. Not history - recounts of adventurers.

### Cottage outside Ordulin

It's nighttime, the fire is roaring and we're all together and Inafina plucks up courage to try and ask Bel if he's OK - we did say we'd go back to the Court and he hasn't yet; is it time? Is there something else on his mind? Kindle overhears and realises he's noticed that too. ADV persuasion only 14; he doesn't say *what* is worrying him but does say that he's been trying to learn about fey crossings...

...but then surprisingly he gets annoyed. "Don't you think I *want* to go and get my knighthood?!" he says, unexpected angry (DM roll). He immediately apologises. Inafina says "it's no problem, we'd just like to understand and help if we can."

It's winter now, he says. Titania is not ruling the court, and while he thinks she'd give him *some* sort of reward, time is passing. He doesn't want to leave it too long. We're apologetic - we should've realised and gone at the end of autumn! What a terrible oversight. But Bel points out that he couldn't find any crossings! "I don't know how to get there! I've never been *here* before. I've only ever been in the fey wild. I know how to get around but..." - this is part of why he'd been visiting so many places in Ordulin. It was a combination of general curiosity but also trying to find someone, *anyone* with Fey connections. But Ordulin is a very "human" city and he's had no luck.

Of course, libraries being libraries, the books Oswen read were more academic and hypothetical, rather than giving actual *locations* of crossings. ADV history 21. "There must be records of locations somewhere... Or..." - she remembers that some important crossings are time-dependent. There's one she read that opens for 7 days during the winter solstice... A conduit; a network that opens at that time.

Kindle says, "That's only about ten days away!"

Oswen suggests we all get to the library in the morning, so we can check the books and see if we can narrow down a location. We don't know how far we might have to travel. The sooner the better! We can ask around and see what people know.

"Seems like we'd better dig out packs and get ready for an adventure?" suggests Inafina. "We might need to ask around in a bigger city, even. Somewhere with a more..." (she clears her throat and looks apologetically at Leonidas) "...varied population!" Leonidas doesn't mind. "I knew you'd be off again sooner or later, and I've got months of studies left - just let me know if there's any way I can help. I do know that to the North are some very secretive elves that live in the woods, or far to the West are less human-dominated cities that are perhaps more remote, less advanced, but perhaps more in touch with things like Fey paths."

We spend a while discussing options while getting around to things that had been left alone - unpacking the portable hole and removing things we didn't need to keep, like the mirrors. Books have already been donated to the library. Mementos like Stein's wooden carving are placed carefully on shelves. We slim down our inventory and make sure we have what we need - previously-cut ropes were already renewed, rations restocked and so-on - but it all needs sorting and packing again. Bel had really "moved in" to the house, with his fancy clothes etc. all unpacked (and added to!) and instruments placed on display, so now Bel picks his new favourites and stows them in his chest.

Given we don't know the best way for fast travel, the librarian is our first choice - start there, and follow the chain of information.



## Day 1
### 7am (sun not even up yet)

Bel is already up and waking people enthusiastically! He's all ready to go, wearing his old - but cleaned and repaired - adventuring clothes. Kindle gets on making breakfast, adventurer-style! Leonidas is excited to join in and get glimpse of our adventuring life.

Shutters are closed, the fireplace cleaned out; Kindle tells the squirrel that we'll be away for a while, but lets him know about a hoard of nuts that have been hidden for him. He gives the spare key to the squirrel but Leonidas can get it if he needs to. Leonidas will check in now and then but otherwise prefers the library accommodation when we are away, because there are people there and (despite his apparent introversion) does like having others around.

We hit the road and in an hour or thereabouts we're up at the library and seek the head librarian **Kamersaal**, to ask about travel options and thoughts about finding more Fey-minded, unusual creatures; "the old ways".

Bel enthusiastically helps Oswen (who knows the librarian) by backing her up with extra questions, or information, or just general excitement. Persuasion ADV nat 20+0! "An old classmate of mine is a high-ranking archivist called  **Rundar** in the capital, Selgaunt, at the **Library Of The Republic**. He should have access to portals!" - and to our gratitude and joy, he even writes us a **letter of recommendation**. We need to access the "fabled cities of the west". To thank him, Oswen gives him one of the bottles of Elven Wine that we picked up in the Fey Wild.

Interestingly, the librarian doesn't recognise the Elven script on the bottle. It's not from the Elves of the north - heavily modified, as if an offshoot. Simplified in some ways. More modern, not more ancient.

The ponies are long-term stabled at the library. No more pumpkin for a while! But they won't be bored - they're "on loan".

So we'd better hurry! Oswen never knew about it somehow but it turns out there are gardens with pools to the West of the city, which (she'd visited the gardens) allow Skimmers to wait and take passengers (she's never seen any). We take a transport that way - one of the "trams" - and get there as soon as we can. There is a ticket office! Selgaunt: 3sp each.

We get four. The transport leaves in an hour. There is a book store, gift shop and cafe! Oswen and Leonidas excuse themselves from the others who wait at the cafe, to walk around the gardens.

Towards the end of the walk, Leonidas and Oswen talk about time. We know that when there's a meeting of planes such as this, time passes much more similarly across the two domains and this is a 7-day window, but there's always a risk it is missed, or that it skips a year or two! Oswen says, "Last chance to come... I mean, I know you'll say 'no'. And it's dangerous and I *want* you to say 'no'. But - I want you to say 'yes' too." "I'm going to stay here - I'm giving you a reason to come home" - and she hugs him, lost for words.

"Look!" he says. He points, paddle swans in the lake. "Do we have time? I'm sure we have time! Just a quick one!" We pay, jump into one and paddle away with our feet. Oswen giggles because Leonidas long legs reach the peddles and she has to sort of hide almost down inside to reach!

"At least this time we don't need to talk about living a lifetime."

Eventually, via a series of circles (!) we make it back. And as we do, we see a skimmer landing. It's quite dramatic. People are disembarking. "It seems we always have to run somewhere after a swan ride..." remarks Oswen as we hurry back to the caf√©! Bel is nervous and Messages - "we're boarding soon!" "Nearly there!"

Last quick moment of hugs and kisses.

Leonidas has to stand at the bank, waving, as we queue to board. It's quite a big queue - some 40 people. Once on board, Oswen hurries to the railing where she can see him. There are internal seats and dining areas, but everyone wants to watch - this is new for us all.

About ten minutes later, an announcement is made, as we're leaving the dock. "Do not climb over the railings!" people on the observation deck are warned. Inafina sees that Leonidas has run around the lake to get a better look at the ship leaving. More waving! He's waving a scarf that Oswen gave him. Kindle picks Oswen up onto his shoulders and she waves from there.

The ship's sails open, as it heads into a short canal heading towards the city walls; once outside, it lifts and starts to skim over fields, picking up speed and turning South. It's very fast - and very cold! Despite it being a fun view we are eventually forced indoors.

There isn't much to do, so we find some seats. Bel pulls out cards and we start playing. We notice some inquisitive teenagers watching, whispering and staring. Kindle smiles at them with his big teeth and they look scared; Oswen calls out, "want to join us? We can teach you the rules..." - but they're quite nervous. Then one comes over and asks if we were in the Witchlight Carnival?" - and to Inafina, "Were you one of the trapeze artists?" - and they're very complimentary about her act. They ask where we're from and we explain. "I *told* you they weren't just costumes!" says one person.

For 3 hours or so, we travel across plains or along field edges. Then we realise we can see the sea - and the skimmer bears East to meet it, heading out over the water. An announcement tells us that we're approaching the port; the four of us head up to the observation deck.

We see the beautiful, grand hill and cliff city, already quite close, the cliff illuminated dramatically by the low, late-afternoon winter sun. The marble-white Halls Of Democracy gleam atop it.

We dock and disembark. It is *busy*. Grand, newer architecture, bustling. More towers and rows of buildings with many storeys; but also more plazas and gardens, wide avenues, but narrow avenues. A grand plaza of market stalls and gardens is just outside the port, along with touts trying to sell guide services and the like. We figure we made it through the Fey Wild so we can make it through this! Nobody sells maps, though... And then we spot one of a few public kiosks that are used for information, with a big map of the city on a board behind one, so we ask there. We get a small city map from a kiosk and are directed across the plaza to a big building where trams can be caught, but when we mention we're looking for the library, we're told to hurry - it closes soon!

We hurry to catch the "N" line. A tram is ringing a bell, just about to depart. We jump on - the tram rocking alarmingly when Kindle jumps in! - but do get there just before it moves away. We expect to pay but, unlike Ordulin, we're told this is a free service. It's very hilly compared to Ordulin, so the trams actually make a bit more sense. It saves a lot of effort, not just time. Up ahead, we soon notice a beautiful domed building with a semicircle of columns - that matches the description we have, and when we get closer, the sign atop it becomes legible.

The tram stops right alongside. We're the only ones who disembark, but lots of people get on. We run! There's another plaza before the columns, with most people going the other way. A grand clock shows us the time is 5 to 5pm, so we only have 5 minutes to find the librarian! Inafina gets inside first, but is stopped by a middle-aged man - "no running in the library!" - she apologises and explains that we hope to very quickly speak with Rundar, an archivist, before closing time; where should we go? "You'll find the Senior Archivist in the inner library, tending to books there. That's on the fourth floor!"

The others catch up; we hastily thank the exasperated librarian, and quick-walk-not-run up the stairs until out of sight - and then run, up and up to the fourth floor, quite out of breath on arrival. There's a sign saying that books are not for loan, and telling us that this is the inner library and not to go behind the roped areas. Inside, a few people *are* behind those so we assume they're staff and (quietly) ask for directions. We're pointed in a direction and head that way.

Inafina; can't see anything (nat 1+6), but Oswen (13) *just* stops the top of a head poking out from a table behind a giant stack of books. Oswen clears her throat - "Are you Mr Rundar?" - his head pops up - he corrects our pronunciation, the **R "separate" - Arr-Undar**. We explain why we're here as quickly as we can and hand him the note of recommendation.

"Oh my! You're students of Kamersaal? Well! Of course. The library is closing - come into my office!"

We follow to his office. Other librarians are bidding each other farewell at the end of the day - everyone seems to call him "Rundar", not "Arr-Rundar". Bel asks about that! Rundar explains it's just too much work explaining the pronunciation. Inafina asks if he's from further East - well, not quite - West. He explains he's party of Elven descent. He pushes his hair back to show us a slight point to the ears. "It's my mother's tongue. We removed extra letters from my original name because at the time she moved to Sembia, elves were not very welcome."

We explain about the fey paths and connections, and a possible need to journey West and ask if he has any ideas of a good place to go to find this fey connection location out? It might be possible to actually research that *here*, in the archive. He also says he has sigils for a few locations in the West; he thinks two still work but he's not tested the third in a while! There's a library-city he knows about, which we could try if it comes to it, but that's hard to reach. A last resort as he has no portal. But has a portal to an embassy in the city of Waterdeep; and one to an elven city called Silverymoon. At this, Oswen shows a bottle of the wine; it *is* a western script, but it's forest elves, "green" elves as he puts it. "It comes from the Misty Forest. A strange place to make wine! This must be quite valuable, as it must be old... But that doesn't feel right. Unless they use different dates from us?" Perhaps that's a Fey Wild thing. He says the bottles might be more than 100 years old.

One thing at a time, though - we need to find out more. We have to leave the library as it's closing time (and the last one out must turn off all the lights and lock all the doors, so he wants to avoid that!) so we head away and he picks up speed to try and head out past people!

We ask two things - what time should we meet tomorrow; "the library open at 8:30" - and is there any good inn, nothing fancy, reasonably close by? After a few questions about what we're after, he suggests the "Dress Circle" part of town which has lots of bars and restaurants, and has views; or there is the market area, with cheaper food, but a lot more noisy. While the lively side sounds fun (and cheaper!) we figure Bel is more 'regal' and, hoping he'll approve of the choice, elect to head up the hill.

There's a way to walk if we don't want trams. That sounds OK... There are various stairs. D20->7. There's a stairwell alleyway behind a row of buildings at one point and, in there, we see a light coming out of a small doorway. Some kind of partly-underground bookshop, and it's open. We investigate!

Over the door it reads "Xtlal's Manuscripts" (and added underneath, apparently some time later, "and curios"). It's a messy space inside! Kindle decides to wait outside, as it's too cramped in there. It's packed floor to ceiling with all manner of books and objects, things stored in every corner. A middle-aged gnome runs it. "Welcome to my shop! Did you stumble across me or come looking for me?" - we explain.

We ask about fey wild texts, especially about fey crossings. He walks down a ladder to reach us - he's even shorter than Oswen! He starts to walk around his maze of various shelves, pulls a wheeled set of steps over to be able to reach higher steps, checks various books and starts handing one or two down to Oswen. He also references Pagan Festivals given the solstice link.

With help, Oswen investigation - 20+7->27. The pagan section bears fruit, with some strange classifications here. One curious book is called "Fantasy Parties", really a collection of lists organised according to times of year. At Winter Solstice, there are a few things listed. "A grand ball in a reenactment of the Fey High Society Party at **Paliset Hall**" which happens once every 8 years. Invitations are essential! Apparently it's a real high society Fey thing, so if reenacting, invitations must be made in a particular way, to look the part; dress up, masquerade ball, start at sunset, continue to sunrise. Always held at the solstice as that's the longest night. It's an instruction manual for how to throw this party, but mot of all alludes to the idea that this party really happens, where people who've made an impression - the fickle, the fashionable, the transient - get a real invitation. People compete! A secret, unspoken competition to be invited.

This tells us that there *is* a crossing, and they appear in many places, perhaps according to the invitations, because Fey and other kinds attend. So we now have two problems not one - where, and how to get an invitation (but we don't necessarily need the invitation!).

We still have the "where". Perhaps people who were historically invited, or are invited this year, might know. So that question becomes... How do we find such people? Probably more to the West.

We consider buying the book considering how helpful it was, but others might find it useful. But Xtlal says the books aren't for sale! He's not a bookshop. Well he is. But he wants to keep them! He only has one copy. Instead, he invites us to drink spiced mead and pay through stories.

We have plenty of those! We talk of the coven, the scissors of shadow snipping, show the music box that calls the Brigganocks and more. He writes everything down.

"Good luck! If you are in need of anything else, you know where to find me!"

A few streets later and we're at the Dress Circle. We ask Bel which place is the most befitting of a man of his stature? "What about this one? Looks like it has a good view!" he asks. **The Bowery** - sure! Delicate, almost art nouveaux, white and cream, covered in flowering vines and bramble roses, with a courtyard in the back. One room, four people, city view, one night... 2gp. Comes with breakfast in the garden courtyard from 7am. Great!

We check out the room. We're on the third floor. Selgaunt is all about stairs! The room style matches the building and the view is, indeed, good. A tea table with four chairs is stationed by that window and there's even a small toilet and tub private for just this room. We're able to drop off some of our heavier gear but we don't "disarm" completely. Just in case.

Now we're out for food. There are small, family-like places or great big places with queues and tables outside. We go mid-size to avoid queues, but also avoid somewhere Kindle won't fit! We find **The Golden Otter** - fun! - and go in, asking for a table. It's all white tablecloths and waiters - quite formal - Kindle gets some raised eyebrows but everyone is polite. We're taken to a booth close to a window looking out onto a terrace outside (we choose inside because it's warmer and not smokey).

Light meal or full meal? We skipped lunch. "Full meal!" says Kindle.

Options are land meat, sea meat or vegetables. This being called "The Golden Otter", Kindle says, "Fish please!" and we're all happy with that. We choose an option of a local cider, to go with it. Much as Kindle likes cooking for the group, it's nice to be catered for sometimes.

It's relaxed and chilled. We discuss options. How's Bel feeling about this "party invitation" revelation? "At least we have one path to try now, we just need to secure the steps along it." And once we're in the Fey Wild he can travel around there easily. He can Message for things - carriages, cranes or similar.

The food is in three courses, very delicious and Kindle is particularly fond of a large chunk of lava cake for desert. "It's my treat!" says Bel, who pays the 7gp bill for all of our food and drink at the end.

We get back to the room and chat. We wonder if the elves might be "closer" to the fey than Waterdeep; and we did meet Alagarthas, and now know that *he* brought the wine we have, which gives us a form of proof. Perhaps he would help.



## Day 2
### Room at 'The Bowery', Selgaunt

We have the early breakfast, check out and get to the library for 8:30am prompt. We head upstairs to find Rundar. He's already there, sipping some tea in his office. We tell him about what we found out last night and how that leans us towards the Misty Forest, but we don't know where that is. Turns out his third, untested sigil is for a tower near there... Well, we might have to test it!

We all agree that if the fey connection locations vary according to invitations, so the library here can't possibly document that. And there's no time like present! It's not safe to cast that here, but he suggests a temple to **Oghma, the God Of Knowledge**, in the temple district and suggests we go there. They can cast the spell, using his sigil (for a fee). Sounds good.

At the temple, we try to get on their good side but it's not our most persuasive performance ever (!) - ADV persuasion 13 - they say that we'd be refunded the cost if we come back here some time to describe what we found, pass on the knowledge of where the pathways were. Otherwise, though it's...

**250gp**

...and wee're not made of money, but we have little choice! We pay up.

The priest inscribes the sigil into a teleportation circle over the course of a minute. Before the last rune is drawn he asks us if we're ready. "Good luck!" says Rundar. "Please report back what you found!" - **he hands us a slip of paper with the sigil for the temple, so we can get here directly if someone can cast that**.

The last rune is drawn. A portal starts to form and, without hesitation, we step through.

### Old tower, Sword Coast

We're on a moss-covered stone floor with *mostly* intact walls around. The tower of an old keep. "Careful where you tread!" says Oswen to Kindle - this doesn't look like the strongest construction, as it's old and abandoned. The forest appears to be reclaiming this keep. We look for stairs down, but it's quite difficult to see; Kindle grants Darkvision. We realise that we must have gone a long way west and it's not even daylight yet! "See what I mean about time?!" says Oswen.

Carefully, over slippy and mossy stone stairs with thick vines or small trees growing through walls, we descend. The door at the ground floor is completely overgrown but there's a convenient hole in the wall instead! We are *in* a forest. And it's misty.

Inafina climbs a tall tree to try and get bearings. Orvil has been waiting out autumn and winter ("I don't like the cold!") sleeping in the Fey and we don't want to wake him. It's quite impressive; two majestic snow-capped mountains rise out of the forest towards the east. Some stands of taller trees break the canopy. Towards the West she can see the edge of the forest; a few hours walk maybe; to the East, it goes as far as she can see. We realise that we now have our bearings relative to the rest of this evidently very large forest, but have *no idea* where to go within it.

Oswen elects to try Divination. She finds a space where a small fire for incense is safe to build, then starts the ritual with the question: "**Please show us the bearing we should follow to eventually meet elves who would know who Alagarthas is.**"

The incense mingles with mist. Oswen WIS save, nat 1, nat 4; 8 total only. She starts feeling heady and gets an odd sense... Stumbling through something. A scene. She doesn't belong here. A set of eyes are upon her, momentarily, before it shifts and shows an elven village. Some kind of outpost. A familiar face - Alagarthas - with some elven archers and knights riding stags. Then the vision "pulls back" to show the route. It's beneath a really large tree covered in red, drooping flowers, even in winter. A series of small rapids on a stream nearby. A sense of relative location. The vision fades. As it does, Oswen hears a voice on the edge of consciousness; "Wait. Wait - can you help me? Maybe you can help me!"

Oswen is very unsettled. She describes the start and end; something watching, something breaking through the spell. Malicious or benign? Insight 15; desperate, distraught. But it was a strange hiccup, a glitch; there might not be some adjacent, ethereal plane person in need of help. The spell went slightly awry. But someone, somewhere needs help.

**That has to be a problem for another time.**

Meanwhile, we have a route and try to follow it. Oswen's not sure of the route so she describes it as best she can; Kindle can cover the ground quickly even in the trees and has a viewpoint above bushes; he finds a stream (ADV Survival 20) and Oswen recognises it.

We travel for about an hour - and then we're stopped! A patrol of two wood elves. They are armed, without weapons drawn. "Stop! Who are you and why are you in our forest?"

We try to explain but they are sceptical that we know *Prince* Alagarthas (!) - and the wine doesn't convince them; we could've stolen it. Bel pipes up in Elven, persuasion 17+7->24, pleading for us to at least be taken to the "Prince" as he should surely recognise us. They relent, but if the Prince doesn't vouch for us we'll be escorted out of the forest at bow-point.

Two hours of walking later - less than we expected, thanks to being guided by people who evidently know the forest paths very well - we approach the outpost. The elves walk in silence, talking neither to us nor each other. We reach the tree, just as in the vision. Then we are taken up to a platform, with almost a small kind of chapel on it; but, somehow, it is grown. It's on a lower branch of the tree. As we get there, holding some kind of briefing apparently, we see the Prince. He looks up, puzzled for a moment, then there's a dawning realisation... "You? Wait. I know you? But it can't be. What are you doing here?"

Oswen says, "We aren't sure about how time has passed - we got sent back in time out of the Fey Wild. But this time, we're here hoping *you* can help us find a way back *there*."

He seems surprisingly confused. Vague. "I know you... I feel like I know you? Guards, it's fine! I can't explain it. They don't mean us any harm." He dismisses his council too, to our embarrassment!

We ask if he remembers seeking help from a hag. He doesn't remember - he dreams - well, had a vision. We explain what we know and it matches his vision, but he can't *remember* it. As if he's thinking of things that haven't happened yet. It's complex!

Anyway, he's fairly sure - even though he can't remember details - that this is in his *past* and not his future. By our reckoning, now, on that whole "years passed" - it might even be that this event was in his *future*, but he thinks it's happened.

"Wish" spells are very strange.

We explain, when prompted, *why* we're here. And on crossings to the Fey - he knows of a mushroom circle at an old abandoned settlement, which is where he "was" found "after" he got back from the Fey. It might even be where he was born (which makes sense, given how the lake in Prismeer was meant to work). As we wait for him to fetch guides, we talk by the stream. Bel wonders, "is this it?" - could it be this simple? What of that "party" and the solstice? Well, any route will do!

Presently Alagarthas returns with two guards. We're led - with strict instructions to follow closely - along a strange, more overgrown path, vivid colours and big plants; a fey path. It only takes about 10 minutes when things become more 'normal' again but there's a sense of great distance covered; different tree species more prominent, different feel to the air. And here is a very brightly coloured mushroom circle, all red and white.

"Gather round. Think of your childhood, and sneeze - twice!"

He hands a bag of something to Kindle to help. Sneezing powder! Kindle snorts it, jumps back, sneezes twice; passes it on to help - and now the mushrooms turn multicoloured. Oswen says "Oh, we'd better hurry, as we *all* want to go through!" - and so we sneeze. As we're doing it, Alagarthas suddenly exclaims - "I remember now! You *did* help me! I wish you luck!" - and Oswen has time to shout back, "Thank you! I hope we meet again, Prince!" - but he responds, "The circle will have a different key on its way back. You'll have to figure that out yourself!" (We know that from Prismeer, but it's a good reminder).

And we're suddenly through.



### Prismeer

Oswen calls Orvil. He needs to see this!

Beautiful, brightly lit, golden, sunny, very large, sparse trees, silvery leaves; a mushroom circle; the mushrooms look up at us. They smile. "Hello!" says Oswen. They start singing. Oswen says to Bel, "If you can teach them a song, maybe they'll teach us the password to get home?" - performance 23, it goes well. The Campestri learn the song and giggle delightedly. **They stop for a moment, then start doing a different dance; a backwards jig; they want us to learn it. So, we practice. We get the feeling that if we do that when the Campestri are in the circle, it would activate the portal.**

We can hear running water that we can't see. Beautiful blue skies. Very bright. It's not right for Prismeer, though we don't know what Zybilna's been doing. Bel doesn't know and needs more of a line of sight. We try to seek out the water sound as it might be a river we can follow. It is, indeed, and quite a wide one at that. It glistens with sparkling captured sunlight; Oswen ADV perception only 10, it's all too bright and vivid, her eyes just aren't quite up to speed yet. But she feels happy!

"Hey Bel! We made it! Wherever it is!"

Then she hears - "Hey! You!" - and the clatter of hooves. A centaur on the opposite bank, another one behind. Middle-aged. "What are you doing over there?"

"We just arrived. Trying to find out bearings!"

"Wh - where did you think you were going to be? You don't - wait - you're not all from here. Hold on?!" And the other says, "Oh, I'm so sorry!" and bows to Oswen. "We didn't see you there, your highness! Do you need help crossing the river?"

"Yes please" - since Oswen figures there's a good reason they're so surprised we're over here, and being over *there* might be better. They start to chant and lily pads float up. They form the equivalent of stepping stones and a few moments later we're on the other bank. "Thank you!"

"Welcome. Are you here to find Zybilna?"

Ah! So this *is* Prismeer. As for Titania - they point to the now-intact Queen's Causeway, but point *away* from the palace. "That should take you to Oberon and Titania's winter camp." Certainly, Bel seems keen. "Thank you! That's very kind." "We are pleased to have met you, but we don't know how to address you, your highness." "Oh! My name is Oswen!" "Oswen? There's a legend; well, a story that was told by the elders, that has a clever halfling wizard - a sage - who helped to save the land. It's a bit of song!" It *does* mention a Bugbear, Satyr and Harengon. "Such a coincidence!" they say, when realising that these are exactly the creatures in front of them. They don't know how long ago it was (time is kinda meaningless here anyway).

We also learn that these centaurs are from Winterbow's tribe when we ask about the name - he is a tribe elder. He told this "unbelievable" myth, this legend, of four people who came from various lands to help in the "mists of the forgotten times". But the time was ages ago and never even existed - they don't believe the "mist" time was ever a thing, unless a *long* time ago - but they are decades old... The elders are old, but they've lived here for centuries continuously. Nobody abandoned the land. Curious. We ask the centaurs, if they happen to see Winterbow, to mention that they they saw the four story-like characters and that 'Oswen says "hello"'.

We head towards the causeway. We might catch up with Zybilna later, but for now, we're aiming for the winter camp, heading away from the palace (which gleams in the distance like a winter wonderland - frosty, snow-covered, gleaming, with long, low shadows). It takes about an hour to reach, mostly on dry, grassy tussock, some trees and bushes - no marsh! To get up onto it, we at first consider using magic, but find giant beanstalks that we can climb. It's comparatively busy on here this time! A glass carriage; a beetle carriage; many people on foot... It's great to see things so lively.

Moving along the Queen's Causeway, we see that the "Queen" of this causeway is in fact Titania, not Zybilna. We walk for d8->4 hours and need to take a short rest. We've seen many realms pass below us - it goes through strange, twilit domains briefly before emerging again into new realms, that are bright with sunlight. It seems linear but is not - the causeway intersects with others; it is a network, to move between the Domains Of The Light.

Bel is sure that all roads nonetheless eventually connect up and head towards the palace at the "centre of the Fey Wild"; we'd never thought of Zybilna's palace as being the centre of this whole plane! Bel eventually takes us off onto a side causeway heading towards the Huntress Woods. After another hour, it seems the realm we're in is "just after sunset"; a moodiness, a purple sky, yellows and oranges gone, a cool wind but not cold. Tree leaves are browns and reds - it feels autumnal. There are rich animal smells - as if a great many wild animals live here. Trees tower above this new causeway and rope bridges connect from the causeway to trees. Bel knows the right one and takes us across, into the trees.



### Winter Camp

Foxes with *nine tails* (!) flit around, there are either small or very large birds, some of the large ones apparently flightless, that come almost to the branch we're on - some 40ft above the ground! Bel leads us to an area near a very, very old tree that has created a clearing around itself where other trees can't compete. We look down and realise that this in fact seems to be *three* trees that have grown and joined up into a bower above, with a space below and a clearing in the top of the canopy that gives a glimpse of the sky. The moon is visible, a circle, easy to see.

Down below, in the gap between the trunks below is a very regal camp - various tents, white and yellow coloured and large, marquees almost. Three large, half a dozen smaller. Kindle remarks that it looks like a royal hunting camp - Oswen wonders when he might've seen such a thing before. His knight days, presumably. There are numerous pennants that seem to flow in a breeze we can't feel blowing; huge saddled elk graze nearby.

Bel spots the place we need to go and leads us down. There's a strange sense of a wave of emotionally charged air - as if emotion had physical form. There's a "thickness" to it. Inafina tries to resist (WIS save, nat 1! 4 total). Kindle resists (25). Bel, nat 20; on seeing those two resolve themselves, Oswen figures it must be a good idea and tries but - 13 - like Inafina, succumbs to the effects. The two of them feel a sense of excitement, almost fearful, as if something important is just about to happen. But it might be dangerous. A deep, dark woods, we're being very brave... It's all exaggerated.

Eladrin are here. Like elves, but exaggerated too! Most seem to be in colours that match with the autumn leaves. Some are more brightly coloured - greens - they seem more aggressive, almost; hunters, we guess. Near the tents we see two in much lighter colours - blueish and white, as if winter. They're more contemplative as they watch us walking through the camp. Stoic, just nodding at our passing. The autumn elves come and greet us with open arms. They even bring baskets of food. "You've come just in time for feasts! The bounty of the hunt and the harvest has been great this year. Please come, share!" "OK! Thank you!"

Inafina and Oswen take food; Bel and Kindle politely decline (but take a small amount when pressed, as it seems impolite otherwise, but carry it rather than eating). Bel asks where the court is - which tent? "King Oberon and Queen Titania are out on the hunt at the moment, but they should be back for the festivities tonight." "Festivities?" asks Inafina, enthusiastically. Apparently, the hunt is celebrated every night. Keeps the winter blues at bay! "Surely you will be staying?" they ask. Oswen looks to Bel; he says, "We'll wait for an audience - is there somewhere we can set up our tents?" and we're shown an area, amongst some hunting tents.

Kindle says, "So are we doing this the old fashioned way?" and we decide to get two, two-person tents we'd purchased in town out of the portable hole as casting spells here might be a bad idea. Kindle has to pair with Oswen to fit, leaving Bel and Inafina in the other. Oswen produces a special blanket she got for Kindle's feet, since they stick out of the tent if he lies down flat!

Oswen asks Bel about etiquette. What should we all do? "Don't speak unless spoken to by the King or Queen. Queen Titania is actually in charge. She's a bit capricious so watch what you say, but she respects brave, intelligent beings. She gets bored easily; she respects free-thinkers but doesn't like to be disobeyed! A bit of a paradox. Winter means she has few responsibilities beyond her immediate retinue and gets to spend time with Oberon; but she has the least power. She has a power-sharing thing with the Queen Of Air And Shadow - a lot of people see the two of them as two sides of the same coin! - but they have a fierce rivalry. It keeps the land in balance.

There is sudden excitement and people start to rush off. "They must be back! Let's go!" says Oswen, still a bit heady from the strange emotional air. The others follow. There's a procession of dozen or so majestic stags marching towards the camp. An eladrin knight is in the lead, together with a number of other creatures - a small retinue of faeries too, even with faerie knights in silver chainmail. Further behind, we spot Sir Talavar, with Queen Titania, roughly in the middle of the procession. Just in front of her is a particularly impressive elk with King Oberon riding.

They carry a strange boar-like creature being pulled on a sled. It's huge! Long tusks, matted fur, crackles with storm energy! It's subsiding though. Apparently it's the feast centrepiece.

The king and queen head towards the royal tent to clean up. Sir Talavar flies towards us. "Bel! Oswen, Inafina and Kindle! Goodness! I had no idea when I would see you again. What a most crazy time it has been! Well done. I knew I could count on you! I didn't think you'd quite do what you did, in the way you that you did it... But all's well that end's well." Oswen is relieved that he remembers - since in Prismeer things are quite different. "We are under the protection of Queen Titania's magic; after all, the Fey Wild bends to her will. As powerful as Zybilna magic is, it's no match for Titania's - although she rarely exercises her authority on other regions' domains. An unspoken lack of interference. I will make sure she knows you are here - we must celebrate! I trust you brought something to wear?"

Bel, of course has; Oswen has the golden bodice but little else; Kindle and Inafina have clean non-adventuring clothes packed but nothing fancy. But Kindle says he does have his old ceremonial armour - Oswen's keen to see him in that. And Inafina says, "Well that helps, because if we are dressing to match our skills, I can wear all of my monk's clothing."

Dressing comes down to Performance checks, based on our skill attributes though.

* Inafina, weaving her hair and draping robes, DEX based Perf (where she also has Proficiency) with ADV as we help each other. Nat 20! Total 27. She has her performer's staff and some elements of her performance costume, but also legitimate monk robes - not too kitsch.

* Kindle dons his knight's armour. He and Oswen help polish it up. A well-painted breast plate and cape. Greaves and a cloth skirt of sorts. He carries the helmet. WIS based check - he's in armour but wants to look priestly, no Proficiency though. Even with ADV it's only 11, which is a shame, because Oswen thinks he looks - albeit more of a knight than he probably wanted - very impressive and tells him so.

* Bel surprises us. He goes for a deceptive approach! He dresses as if he were a knight. He did keep asking about a knighthood. As if he fought, more than was a bard (and it's not all *that* deceptive). 28! It's very convincing. And him as a knight next to Kindle makes Kindle look rather more priestly, by comparison.

* Oswen tries to convey the complexity of her craft; straightens out her hat, wears the bodice, clean cape... INT-based ADV check, 23. She makes sure spell book runes are visible, Orvil is here, her old staff, the Chromatic Rose in a button hole, and more.

Bel digs around in his chest and produces a vial of perfume, which he says he'd purchased in Ordulin. It's a very pretty box. It is a gift for the queen.

Sir Talavar flies over, saying he'll present us to the queen at the opening of the feast. He seems a bundle of nervous energy - this doesn't help us be calm - so Inafina asks how important this is for Bel. "It's the most important thing that's ever happened to him! Everything must be just right!" and at that he fusses around Kindle to tidy up some rough edges. He casts some kind of spell on us all to make us glitter a bit too. Kindle offers to cast Enhance Ability for Bel's charismatic nature but he and Sir Talavar point out that Queen Titania would see through that straight away. Magic for cosmetic purposes only!

A nervous half hour passes. Then the sky suddenly changes - it goes dark, rapidly. Music plays from within a tent. That's our cue! "Walk behind me and follow my lead" says Sir Talavar. He heads off. Bel is next, then Inafina, Kindle and last, Oswen.

Some eladrin guards bow and we enter the tent - but it's suddenly a totally different realm. A hunting lodge, warm, 18ft high ceilings, with a balcony wrapping around inside. There are big tapestries and huge banners hanging the full height of the wall. Thick curtains are drawn over what must surely be grand windows. Trophy heads hang in a gallery area of beasts that look almost mythical. A huge hearth is against a wall; a long table stretches the length of the hall; and at the very end, at the head of this wide table and slightly raised on a small pedestal, are the seats for the king and queen, side by side. The foot of the table has room to let staff walk down "inside" it, so staff can place food onto it (it's almost like a very elongated "U"). Lots of people are already seated but there are plenty of empty seats.

The king and queen are seated; some 30-odd other people are here; we think the room can seat about 40. We seem to be last!

Sir Talavar flies in to announces us, but quickly asks what our group name should be! Oswen can't think of anything better than "Roslof's Aides". He starts to list a litany of titles of Queen Titania and King Oberon; "I pretend to you - Roslof's Eight!" (sic.) "Restorers of Prismeer! Champions of Zybilna and vanquishers of the Hourglass Coven." He bows and steps aside, ushering us in.

There is much muttering about there being just four of us...

The queen speaks. "Yes. I heard about this! You have my thanks for restoring balance to Zybilna's realm. We were rather preoccupied with other things, so the Court is in your debt. Sir Talavar, do you nominate these four brave creatures as your champions to the Court?" Sir Talavar quotes some kind of decree or law and follows that with "...I do".

"Then I welcome them and grant them the permission to speak on their own behalf" says the king. "If it pleases the queen, we will delay the meal for ceremonies of thanks and the recounting of bravery?" - the crowd seems to murmur, fortunately in agreement.

Now the "U", the centre of which had a raised section for food, moves; things just slide apart and there's a kind of runway now, between the two table sides, with the raised section off to the left; the raised section lifts further into a dais, and a carpet of golden flows sprouts from the throne to our party, down the centre. Sir Talavar bows and moves to one side.

Inafina encourages Bel to move forward, and he plucks up the courage to lead us, in the same order, towards the throne. Bel, persuasion: nat 20! He recounts the story, asking Oswen occasionally for help with illusions; Inafina acrobatically acting out things against illusions; Kindle sometimes adding roars! - it has just enough embellishment to not quite lie but certainly exaggerate the truth. This seems to be exactly right! The crowd, king and queen all seem entertained. Towards the end of Bel's presentation, as he gets back to our return to the material plane, he presents the perfume.

When it's all finished, Titania says, "What I heard was largely true" (!) "and not only does Prismeer owe you its thanks but the whole Court recognises your bravery, courage, wisdom and loyalty, most importantly, to the tenets and principles that hold the Fey Wild together and which define the essence of the Summer Court. Now - Roslof's Eight - are you with a leader, or are you knights all of equal stature, akin to a band?"

Bel looks behind himself. Oswen steps sideways to be more clearly visible and on Bel's behalf says, "We are akin to a band." She hopes that her monarch status is visible here, to give Titania some idea of how highly she regards the other three.

"Then it is only right that we bestow Knight Protector upon each and every one of you!"

Oberon draws a huge great sword that looks like it is made of emerald, with a very ornate hilt wrought from metal but painted to look like vines, leaves and flowers; the pommel looks like a star. We are called forward. Titania stands up, steps down from the dais and Bel indicates that we should kneel and bow. It's the old fashioned tap-on-shoulder knighthood. We are declared as "Knight Protectors of the Summer Court".

**Further, we are granted the demesne as a group of a Fey realm; a domain that we can carve out, of our own; a sort of Fey creation - a whole new piece of the Fey Wild.**

The rest of the room is thanked for "indulging my courtly desires!" and "now, more than ever, we have reason to feast!" - we hastily retreat from the middle of the table space since it starts to move back together. Merry is made!

Bel seems the happiest he has ever been. Kindle is happy but seems concerned at how much Bel is drinking! Some people congratulate us on the cleverness of the name - Eight when only Four - some people have inferred meanings. Oh well; we'll stick with it. We just politely agree that are all valid theories but I'm sure they understand - "we keep the truth of it close to our chests, as mystery is exciting".

Sir Talavar asks if he heard us right at one point? He was very nervous. Oswen says, "It was perfect" (Deception, 21). He's happy!

People get very drunk. Much dancing. Oswen and Inafina have lowered their guard a bit. Bel joins in playing with minstrels. Oswen enjoys trying to dance with Kindle, who's rather more sober, but she finds it hilarious that a 3ft tall halfling is trying to dance with an 8ft tall bugbear.

The party spills outside, and carries on late into the night. It is an Inspiring evening. When we eventually head back towards our camp, we see a small mote of light following us, then settles on the ground between the tents. Sir Talavar finds his way over to us and says, "Well that went way better than I think any of us dared to hope!" Aumen Brighterstars appears too, for the first time - we're delighted to see him and there are warm greetings - and the two them explain about the mote of light. We need to keep it safe until we've decided what form our little domain is going to take. Once we've decided, the mote coalesces around our thoughts and desires and will carve out the piece of the Fey Wild.

"The best thing to do is wander into those twilit areas between realms and allow it to take shape."

Inafina laughs and says, "So we'll end up with a small domain that really is the stuff that dreams are made of. Isn't that something!"

We sleep. Perception all round:

* Oswen nat 3 -> 4 (drunk)
* Inafina nat 1 -> 7 (drunk)
* Kindle 14 (tired)
* Bel 17 (just super excited and can't sleep)

Bel wakes Inafina in the middle of the night. "Can you hear that?" - ADV (for hearing) perception, this time, 24. It's the unmistakable sound of someone outside trying to be quiet. Near the other tent - Kindle and Oswen's tent. She flattens back her ears and tries to poke her face stealthily out (dirty 20) to see what's up. She sees a short, cloaked figure standing at the entrance of the other tent, leaning over Kindle's feet, trying to not wake them up; a shepherd's crook staff is trying to hook open the entrance.

Inafina leaps in to try and grapple - unarmed attack 16; DEX save, dirty 20; she tackles the character, but doesn't manage to get a firm grapple on them. They jump out of the way. She ends up holding bits of cloak! She does roll over Kindle's feet and doesn't crash into the tent. Bel can now see that this creature is a satyr, who looks frightened. Bel calls out, "Who goes there?!" - Kindle and Oswen perception still very low, they sleep soundly! - and Bel casts Hold Person, but it is resisted.

"No! No! I don't mean harm!" says the creature and puts down the crook. "I just want to speak to the wizard!"

Inafina insight 21. He's telling the truth, but not in a literal sense; she sees that he has put down the crook, but holes a strange, small, ether bubble in the other hand, with a shimmering thing inside that looks - well, it looks like sound. She points at it. "And what's *that*?"

"Oh! This is for her... I was going to - trying to give her a message - in her dreams..."

Inafina says, "If she's a drunk as I am she won't be dreaming much!"

"But we really need her help..."

Infina counters, "Must she be asleep?"

"No, I just didn't want to scare her. The last time she heard me, it was in a vision!"

Bel and Inafina exchange glances. The "glitch". Bel immediately says, "We should wake her. It'll be fine, she'll want to hear this."

The satyr is shaking, scared! Inafina says, "I'm sorry I jumped at you - we've been dealing with a lot of bad people..." "I shouldn't even be here..." "Hide in the tent with Bel, I'll wake the others."

So Oswen and Kindle are woken and told to keep quiet and Inafina whispers an explanation. Oswen heads quietly to the other tent to meet this new arrival. She pokes her head in and says, "Hello, I'm Oswen. What's your name?"

When she hears the voice, she doesn't recognise it from the vision. So the satyr is not the person she heard in the vision. The satyr does an awkward courtsy - "My name is **Fifel**, m'lady!" - Oswen chuckles and says, "Oh, I'm a very minor monarch, you can relax. I think you have a - well, some kind of memory to show me? A dream?" "Yes - yes. Well, it's a delicate situation. I've been sent by **Eliphus Adulare**, Lord of **Paliset Hall**". Oswen's sure she's heard that before, but can't remember where. "We have a bit of a problem..."

Fifel gathers herself and pulls her dark, curly hair back from her face, tucks in her blouse and straightens herself up after the tussle with Inafina. She takes off her backpack and puts it down; "Now, here is - it's a message for you. It's from Lord Eliphus Adulare. And I also have, if you are willing, invitations for you." "First thing's first" says Oswen, and takes the offered "orb". Straight away she hears a voice, rattling inside the bubble. "Pop it!" says Fifel, so Oswen does.

"I, Eliphus Adulare, have sent my esteemed messenger **Fifel Amberhoof** to lead you to the shores of **Loch Wynnice** so that you may cross into the domain that my dear wife and I rule over, at Paliset Hall. With great haste, please! The winter solstice is nearly upon us - and I fear evil forces are as well. My wife the archmage **Zorhanna** has not been herself of late; I believe something, or someone is controlling her through a magic diamond which she acquired many years ago on one of our adventures. She fitted into a necklace that she wears on special occasions - she really only takes it once a year. She recently took it out from the vault and wore it for a dress fitting, but since then she has been uncharacteristically cruel to the household staff. When confronted, she dismissed me out of hand, clutched the necklace and uttered something in a dreadful language I've never heard her speak before. All her warmth is gone. When I look into her eyes, I see a cold and spiteful woman staring back at me. Zorhanna now refuses to remove the necklace... I can't safely do it myself... I would like you to steal the necklace! Fifel will give you invitations to the winter solstice gala at Paliset Hall. Once we're rid of the necklace, I promise you a reward for your help. It would mean a lot to me."

(Ah yes! Paliset Hall was the name of the place we found out we might get to if we found a Fey Wild gateway to the party).

A long message in a small bubble. Oswen asks Fifel, "This is a strange question and might be hard to answer but - compared to your own voice, what would say that Zorhanna's voice sounds like - higher, lower, and so-on?" Fifel thinks a while. "Oh! I have something that will help!" - she pulls out of her haversack a music box. "This was given to me by Lady Zorhanna - she's the kindest person I've ever met. This is how she thanked me for looking after her Petuinas once!" - she winds it and there's a message, instead of music, that marvels at how beautiful and healthy the flowers look.

The voice is - history 14 - similar but not exactly the same to the vision. This voice is calm and happy, and kind. Oswen's fairly sure that the frantic voice she heard was likely this person. So Oswen says, "The vision I had, I think, was not what you might be talking about Fifel - I'm not sure which vision you mean. But one I did hear I think was Zorhanna's voice, asking for help. She's trapped somewhere. Whoever is at the hall *isn't* Zorhanna."

She explains that her master Eliphus was conducting a divination ritual yesterday beseeching the universe and gods for help, to understand what had happened. He saw a vision of Oswen. He was going to say something to her, before the vision was cut short; he didn't have time. Then he saw a shift in time and saw they were with Queen Titania in a hall, receiving merits of some kind for defeating a coven of hags.

"So it seems our divinations collided somehow and what he hoped to see, perhaps I saw instead; but he's reached out to us since it was in his vision. Well, Bel - is it rude to leave so soon?"

"No! Well, we should probably stay to the morning..."

Fifel interrupts. "Let me give you the invitations!" - they're for a party 3 nights hence, on the winter solstice. Should we arrive early to confer with people who might help? We might make it to the hall, but we would draw Zorhanna's suspicion. We might need to wait until the night of the event. The invitations are hand written and signed by Lady Zorhanna and Eliphus.

Fifel gets another thing from the backpack. It's an unusually large map! It couldn't have fitted - it must be like our portable hole, somehow. It's a map of the Hall. "This is a best as I can make it out!" she says.

Oswen sighs. "Well, we're a band I believe! But my vote is that we help." Inafina nods. Kindle and Bel too.

Fifel explains the way to the Loch to Bel, who understands the causeway routes. She also points out that it's a strange crossover town - it exists on the material plane too, in a different location. A curious gateway between worlds, which we never found any references to in the libraries, at least as town - but *this* is the 'portal' that opens for a few days each year. "I will meet you at the crossing of Loch Wynnice - there's a small town - but I must return now to let Eliphus know. I'll wait at the town as soon as I can." She nervously darts away into the woods; the rest of us return to bed and try to sleep!



## Day 3
### Winter Court

In the morning, Oswen is woken by Orvil. Orvil eventually says, "At last! How much did you drink last night? You were snoring! Anyway. I wondered. If Zorhanna is trapped somewhere, asking for help in visions - who or what is Paliset Hall?"

Oswen says, "Well, yes, exactly. No idea! Worrying, isn't it. And why have they done that?"

Kindle is woken by the chatter and adds, "It's a very significant gathering on the calendar. Not a coincidence, surely."

Another mystery!

We pack up the tents and have some breakfast from the basket of food that was left at the camp. Others are slowly waking up around us. The sky lightens but it's a very low sun.

Inafina asks if we set up our domain before we proceed. We can get to a twilight area and give it a try. Before we do, we need to decide what it should have. We elect to each describe a property that we'd like.

* Kindle - a warm hearth; a place where anyone or anything that has needs can come for food, warmth and shelter
* Bel - a beautiful court, with tall stained glass windows and balconies with banners and pennants, rose gardens, fountains, small bridges over streams! Or at least - somewhere with a bath and a walk-in closet. Oh and four-poster bed. And... Etc.
* Inafina - sees a vantage point; this court is atop a hill, not a mountain, but a hill that gives it a view of the lands around. So it will need a well, for water.
* Oswen - hopes it has a good library, and wild woods beyond the gardens; safe, but forest, beautiful. And the weather she thinks should vary, not be static; but with exaggerated skies, that remind her of her time with the dryads.

Oswen agrees with Kindle that the surroundings responding to emotions is common in the Fey and useful, so it should do that.

We bid farewell to Sir Talavar and Aumen. Aumen now gets to be Chief Courtier, since Bel has his own realm! But we promise them - they will always be our most honoured guests, welcome at any time.

Bel leads us back up, along the bridges and to the causeway and we leave it to him to find a twilight region. As we walk along, he asks what sort of "form" do we want it to be? "I imagined some kind of palace, but that's just because that's where I've been."

A keep, but a delicate keep, well made, as decorative as he implies, on a hill. A grand hall, big hearth. Plenty of room for guests.

We walk back towards the first twilight zone out of Prismeer. We find it. Couple of hours. It's misty today! Hard to see what's there. Bits of water? Tops of hills? Rocky crags?

"So if we all focus on what we think this looks like, each of us will have a different idea of course, but hopefully, the result is a good combination. Shall we try?" says Oswen.

We stand next to each other and try to imagine this place we've discussed. Eyes closed, we don't see the mists roll back from us; Bel suggests as we do this that each of us focus on one thing - and this helps it coalesce one by one. And that happens. From the outside in; gentle, rolling hills, forested, hilly ranges; on one of the tallest hills, a more orderly area. A keep, but delicately made, not huge fortifications; lower walls, arched stone gate, gardens including a vegetable garden, a fountain springs up and starts to run, a bridge over a stream, but homely; the stream wells from a spring near the top, with a well head constructed above to help fill a bucket. There's a space where it falls, some 30ft into a plunge pool with a gentle mist; it flows down out to the forest. A well-travelled, paved, clear pathway leads through the forest, winding its way up the hill and to the main gate. There is one tower! A banner above it; circular, conical roof, not grand scale but reads "palace" on a small scale from its style. The path builds up the hill. The wall sets up around the keep. The keep walls spring up; the tower; a huge stained glass window; stables to the side; a small tavern area, or an inn, where visitors might come or a blacksmith could work - a courtyard area - then a big main hall, not too grand to feel cold, but rich and warm. One bedroom has a grand four poster bed and walk-in wardrobe. A great hearth at the far wall, similar to the hunting lodge we were in; finally, as it all finishes, a warm fire springs up.

It's done.

Clouds part; the mist has gone; our eyes are opened and we see this great vista, rolling hills giving way to distant grassland plains, the stream growing to a river that disappears to the horizon.

"Not too humble, I hope?" asks Oswen of Bel. "It's great!"

The keep isn't actually at the top of the hill. It's set down from a crag which has one old hawthorn tree right at the top, clinging on to a rocks; a natural vantage point. A place to meditate.

We spend time looking around. Sometimes things seem to shift in front of our eyes - as if a generic feel, something indistinct, that coalesces only at the last minute. Bel finds his master bedroom; Kindle his hearth and adjacent big kitchen, with plenty more room for people to chat. Big stained glass windows open onto a balcony, which surprisingly, has a stage at one end for performances. We suspect Bel might've been first to glance into this area! Inafina likes the tower and view. Oswen finds a big room behind the main hall that's filled with shelves and only a few books - but plenty of potential. It's got a spiral staircase to a second level and a few sets of big brass staircases on wheels to access tall shelves.

Oswen takes Bel up to the top of the tower, with the amazing view all around and gives him a big hug. "This is all thanks to you. Not just knowing Queen Titania, or the amazing way you told our story; but all the times you helped us fight and succeed, all the times you saved us or guided us or advised us. Thank you." Bel is very happy; he now has a home, for him and his friends.

Now all we have to figure out is how (assuming it's possible) to connect this to the material world - ideally, a fixed portal near our cottage, which requires a specific set of actions to stop anyone falling through accidentally. **Kindle suggests that the key is needing a mug of spiced pumpkin tea and you sip it as you step through the fireplace in the cottage! And to return - step through *this* fireplace, but with an empty mug, saying, "Wouldn't it be nice to have some spiced pumpkin tea right now?!"**

We don't know how to do that, but one day we hope to learn!

Oswen suggests that it feels to her as if this Bel's home, in the way that the cottage curiously feels like Kindle's home. It's her home too, and Inafina's, but there's a kind of "person at the top of the chain" feeling and that's how it feels to her. She and Inafina are detached; home is either more than one place, or is somewhere now unattainable (in the case of the monastery) and which might not seem like home anymore if returned to.

Oswen resolves to continue her studies, whenever possible, on fey crossings.

Eventually we've explored everything, thereby creating everything (!) and figure - we have work to do! It's time to close the shutters, lock the door and start on our way towards Loch Wynnice. Oswen takes a goblet from the kitchen, just in case she ever ends up with enough magic to use something like that as a focus for fast travel.

### Mid-afternoon

We return to the causeway and Bel leads us. It takes the rest of the day, but it's a very interesting journey - the repeated changes of domains of light, different views and passers-by. Everything has a wintery air, though; no matter how strong the magic of each domain might be, the entire Fey Wild appears to be bending to the ruling court at the palace, which for whatever reason - could just be coincidence! - happens to mirror the season of the material plane from which we came.

Around 4pm, the sun setting, we are led off the causeway down a ramp towards a layer of mist. It's pretty, not menacing! We get below it, and see a realm now in twilight. Curiously, from here, despite having just passed through mist, we can see the sky clearly - there's a lake, too - bright orange and pink, sunset; snow capped mountains are catching the last light of sunset and reflections dance on the water. The sky darkens, pinks to purples to deep blues, as we continue down to a gently sloping cobblestone road wending its way down the side of a mountain pass.

There's an island in the middle of the loch. This too is surrounded by a thin layer of mist, like a veil. Birds fly in formation above. Birds elsewhere sing an evening chorus. The island has some lights from some towers rise above the thin veil of mist, around a just-visible beautiful house - almost a palace, really - with rounded walls. There are lights outside, moving around too - we assume this must be people with torches or lamps. Closer, on the shore on our side of the lake, is a small town. The road leads to it - the **town of Loch Wynnice**.

There's a strangeness to the air; something familiar, yet alien. We're in the fey wild yet it seems very grounded and almost mundane. We're reminded that this is meant to be a sort of crossing place at this time of year, an overlap of the Fey and material; it's as if the latter plane bleeds through a little. It feels, once we're in there, like a real town; but there's an elevated mood - a Fey whimsy - hard to pin down.

There are various beautiful swan boats, in elegant elven designs, docked at piers. A few other people are arriving at a similar time, ahead and behind; on foot, on horseback, in carriages. We get to what looks like the 'main drag' - a waterfront promenade - with a row of main buildings on the road, all facing the lake. We look for a tavern.

There is one that stands out - beautiful, large, next to a well-appointed inn designed strangely, comprised essentially of three towers, each three storeys high. Think "mountain German". The tavern is called **The Aurore** (not Auror*a*). The inn has the same name. The tavern has an extra word - "The Auberge Aurore". Oswen surmises that this might be a material plane language from wherever it is this Fey domain "overlaps". Across the road at the lake's edge, the docks themselves nearby have what looks like a Dockmaster's Office, but with a sign "closed" - turned by someone who just emerged from there, putting on thick boots, and clomping in them towards the pier with a long trident-like object.

There are the usual things; stables, a packed-down market that must run for daylight hours only, and there's a light on in a very cute-looking wooden two-storey building that seems to have a domicile above and shop below. This is more "Swiss chalet", the second floor sticking out above the ground floor with decorative panels. **Khorr's Cloths**. "Do you think we need clothes to help us look as if we're really party guests?" asks Oswen - perception 17+1->18. One of the groups that had been travelling in front of us with carriage, have gone directly in there. We exchange glances, shrug, and head in ourselves.

There's a bugbear inside, who seems to be the shop owner. Kindle look surprised but happy! The owner is helping the people from the carriage; a couple. Inafina tries to overhear what's being discussed so we get an idea of what this is all about - perception 18 - the couple are both getting measured up for clothing for the gala. We guessed correctly! Good. (The shopkeeper calls over and says he'll be with us in a minute). Then she hears that they pre-ordered something and are getting final adjustments done - less good. Will this place be able to make us something in time? We wander around.

A boutique; shelves, a big table in the middle with folded clothes; mannequins in fancy clothes, from bugbear to gnome sizes.

About ten minutes of hanging out later, the couple leave; they nod to us as they leave - the woman human, the gentleman half-elven; they tell Khorr that they'll be getting a room at the inn and confirm that the "modifications will be done in time?" - he assures them that it will.

Khorr heads over to us. Thanks us for waiting; welcomes us; eyes us up; "You're here for the party, aren't you...?" We confirm it; we haven't pre-ordered; we don't know if he has time to do anything, but we're not fussy! He can't make anything new, he agrees, but he can tailor something off-the-rack! Bel confesses that he already has an outfit! The other three of us however - we're very enthusiastic.

* Kindle decides to be the tin man! He finds silver clothing in his size and it goes with his armour, so he can accessorise! It looks good, and quite fearsome.

* Inafina dresses as if a faerie, complete with fake gossamer wings, because she can actually fly. It's topped off with jaunty cap with a feather in it, which just about fits between her ears. The main dress is sparkly, lacy and flowing and she's used to that fit given her monk robes.

* Oswen finds clothing that reminds her of Zybilna. And she *is* a monarch after all - so she basically cosplays Zybilna! Khorr can make some modifications; but it's long and trailing, with alternating strips of shiny black, shiny white (almost platinum) and gold. Puffy sleeves! No hat. Her head is cold! There's a glass jewel diadem she can wear instead though.

Sizing can be completed in a day or two. 15gp each costume - 45gp total.

We thank Khorr and head out, then make a beeline for the tavern. Behind us, Khorr flips the sign on the door to "closed". He tells us to keep warm - and indeed, it's much colder than it was; the mist over the lake has settled down on the water and near the shore the water is already icy. Strange, a very quick change. We breathe out big clouds of vapour. We hasten to the tavern!

Inside, the first thing we notice is a really weird feeling. Inafina insight 14, Oswen 14 too! No idea... Until Kindle tells us, "Hey, look closely at the people..."

This looks in every way as if it is a material plane tavern. Even the inn keeper and staff. But almost everyone else here is not human, and mostly, very Fey! Gnomes, dryads, halflings, elves, tieflings, some very large humans that are too big and too hairy to be actually human (!) - and so-on. The weird feeling is just this continued collision of worlds. Oswen goes up and greets the barman. "Forgive me for asking, but, where are you from? Originally?" "Me? A town just on the other side of the mountain pass, just outside Loch Wynnice. But my wife and I have lived here now for more than ten years." "But what country?" "We live up in the north, near the Eastern spine of the world". Material plane, then! He is **Rei** - his wife is the chef. Good friends of theirs joined them a few years after they'd moved here and run the inn next door.

Oswen thanks him and asks - what's the best ale, and the best food here?!

He recommends that we hurry and get a room before we order - he can hold a table for us! "They might be down to their last two rooms!" - we fortunately don't have to go outside; there's an internal door that connects the two places. We hurry through. It's a kind of living room affair, with a desk which has an older human sat behind - late 50s, perhaps. "I take it you're after one of our last two rooms?" "Yes please!" "Four of you? I do have a room for four left! Would you like to stay up until the solstice?" "Yes please." "We have to charge for the solstice night too... 3 nights... 2gp per bed" (!) "so that's 24gp" - ouch! - but Bel pays! Fancy, too - two platinum and four gold.

(We *could* just sleep outside in the hut, but we want to try and blend in).

He offers to take bags. Bel hands the chest, but the rest of us keep our kit close by - you never know... Back to the tavern. We order ale and food and relax at the table, watching the room. It's simple food but good and large portions, including a big game stew pie.

Inafina tries to listen in on adjacent tables but (ADV perception 8,8+6 -> 14) can't pick out much over general noise and business. A human is at the bar talking to anyone who wants to chat; a long table in the middle seems to have a group who all know each other but not many others, with one halfling standing out to Inafina as they appear to be extremely inquisitive - lots of questions. The dryad at a more distant table with a female gnome with a long wooly scarf hung on a hook next to the table, and leaning against that is a staff with a crystal attached to the end and pointy blue felt hat; there's also the taller, hairy human-oid. 7ft!

At another table, is a tiefling. She has dark red skin and does not seem to want to be talked to! She seems to be almost making a visible effort to not be conspicuous!

A gnome has been walking around and ends up at a table chatting with an female elf, a half-maybe-elf, golden skin, almost sparkly; human-ish aspect otherwise, and two dwarves. They have a lot of musical equipment with them. The gnome is very well dressed and chatting away. Inafina overhears that they're performing there.

Inafina suggests that Oswen and Bel maybe chat to the table with the gnome wizard, since Oswen has something in common maybe, but also does say she's intrigued by the tiefling. That's going to require rather more charm, and Bel might have to lead *that* conversation. In the end, we opt for that; our strategy is to seem friendly, offer a shared table, food and drink; Bel and Kindle head over and Bel leads the conversation. We are hiding that the reason we're here is to steal the diamond! We have to make out that we're just party guests. Kindle has a piece of pie to offer. Bel wonders if she wants some. Bel ADV persuasion 3,5+7->12, oh dear! No good. Bel signals for backup! Oswen heads over.

Bel says, "I guess our game is up! Really me good friend Oswen here and I weer wondering if you knew anything about Paliset Hall? We're assuming you're going there... It's our first time. We've just recently come into some titles - newfound nobility and all! You look like someone who knows your way around these sorts of things..." Bel ADV deception is still low, but 8+10 is enough (they rolled insight 15) so she does believe the story. Inafina watches closely; perception 17; Inafina clearly sees the tiefling kind of try to **quietly remove a ring from her finger and put it into a pocket**.

The ring has an eye on it. It looks very familiar. She makes a mental note to describe to Oswen later; it seems familiar but she can't put her finger on it.

Over at the table, **Lady Mettle** introduces herself. She has horn-rimmed glasses which don't quite seem to fit the rest of the style. But it's her first time too. Bel and Oswen have to embellish their story even more; Kindle insight 13+7->20; he glances over to Inafina, with a look which Inafina recognises as - "this person isn't telling us the truth". Inafina nods; she wants to get that ring and look at it - she heads over and tries SoH - Kindle helps - 6, 9+4 - continued very low rolls for a disastrous 13. The only lucky part is that Inafina never even really gets a chance to try for the ring - the pocket is never in the right place.

We wrap up the conversation and regroup. The tiefling leaves and Inafina notices her checking her pocket as she goes. Inafina whispers a description of the ring to Oswen. Still rolling low; Arcana 9+10->19; but Oswen wonders if it looks like the eyeball we have on a chain at the cottage - the one the hags used. A hag's eye. But this is on a ring. Inafina thinks - yes, same thing. **So this character has a hag's eye on a ring!**

Bel suggests talking to the performers. They might know "back-stage rooms" or other not-for-party-guests locations in the hall. The gnome is still sat with them; he introduces himself as **Dworp Q Guzzler Esquire**, an adventurer. He has a curly mop of bright blonde hair, copper wire spectacles, a lustrous **brown** beard and very fancy clothings. We introduce ourselves - using the name "Roslof's Eight" too! We're interested in all the bits of Paliset Hall that the public don't normally get to see. Dworp heads to another table, saying he'll see people at the party, being very loud; Kindle insight 18 - same story - it isn't true! What's going on?!

The musicians are the **Yalara Quartet**. Sadly, there has been a tragedy; the two dwarves look sullen; they'd been looking forward to the party gig for ages, but can't perform at their best. "I don't even know if I can perform at all!" says one. "Why's that?" asks Oswen. "It's the pain! The pain in my hands. It's terrible for some who is a cellist!" The other says it's the mountain air - too cold. His hands get arthritis basically. Yalara, the young elf, tries to calm them down. Inafina Medicine 16. The other dwarf complains about a bad elbow! But really it's kinda RSI, worsened by a mountain pass moment where they'd taken a shortcut - dwarves know mountains well - but it was very slippery, and cold. Some minor frostbite and a banged elbow.

There's a sound check in the morning before. If they're not in great condition, we offer to help out; at least for the sound check; Inafina can't do the cello but can play the lute, so at least it's a string instrument, and Bel is proficient with drums. Bel persuasion 24 - they brighten up and become enthusiastic. **It's decided! We will meet the group at 9am on the pier, for the ferry on the morning of the gala. Sound check is 3 hours! Then they're brought back, and go out again when it's party time.**

We return to our table. Kindle reveals that the gnome was wearing a wig and fake beard! That explains the different hair colours... And that isn't his name, either. What a curious deception. Dworp has moved on to talk to the well-dressed human sat at the bar. Kindle doesn't even think Dworp has a table. Kindle suggests we check our kit to make sure nothing is missing, in case he's simply an adept thief; nothing is missing as far as we can tell. But at this thought, we do see that Dworp seems to be paying very close attention to everything the human has on them. We watch closely to see if he makes a move and take anything. He hasn't; but he does ask about things like rings - "an heirloom? Will you be wearing it as part of your costume?"

**Curiously, then, Dworp - who is perhaps planning a heist of some kind at the party - might be someone we should ally ourselves with.** Perhaps we should chat to him later and present ourselves as tempting targets, then see if he tries to steal from us!

Oswen decides it'd be a good idea to talk to the dryad and gnome wizard. Oswen and Bel wander over and bid them a good evening and hope that they are having a good night! Poor smalltalk opener. The dryad, quite old, says "Good evening; we're just relaxing, catching up. Old friends." "Yes, your group reminded me a little of ours!" "I guess somewhat; we used to work together. The two of us" - the dryad indicates the gnome - "and **Berengar** here" (the hairy big guy) "was a regular guest of ours, because he was quite good friends" - Berengar jumps in, "Childhood friend, actually of Lord Adulare Eliphus". Oswen feigns wide-eyed surprise. The gnome says, "I take it you're guests for this years party?" and Oswen nods; "Our first time". The female gnome's name is **Nix**. "I have been Zorhanna's apprentice for several years, but I have been off doing my own thing for a little while. This is the end of my adventures, though! I'm back. I am to look after Paliset Hall once the gala ends and the Andulares" (family) "return to their plane" (they don't live in the fey).

Oswen, insight nat 20 + 1 -> 21. Nix the gnome does not seem to be lying and has no reason to lie, as far as Oswen can figure out; but her and the dryad are quite suspicious of our group than we are of them (which seems reasonable). But it seems that they might have a *reason* to be suspicious; it's a sort of imbalance of power. The two of them aren't going as guests, but going instead with an elevated position. And they think we want us to use them for something. So, Bel and Oswen try to turn that around - recognising that they don't know who we are and have no proof; they don't know at all about anything odd going on, not the slightest inkling, but Bel persuasion 18+7 -> 25, suggesting they perhaps find *us* at the room number that we give.

What we *are* able to do is use this to get into the social aspect. We really don't know who they are but can certainly introduce ourselves, as adventurers, and ask more about these others.

The Dryad is **Lycoris**. She explains, "well, Nix arrived at Paliset hall as a young budding mage - some, what, ten years ago? - you were with us for four years before I retired and I've been back to the gala every year since leaving and this is the sixth time, so it must be ten." She talks about a promising young Satyr who took her position as the Head of Staff, **Oren**. We ask if they've heard of another satyr, Fifel Amberhoof. "Fifel? Well, yes, but just a kid! She's one of Lord Eliphus's little troupe" - and Oswen laughs; "Ah, that must be why she was chosen to deliver our invitations to us!"

Berengar becomes concerned as *they* never have had hand-delivered invitations. "Is - is Eliphus OK?" - so that brings us full circle; they don't want to talk here and in particular don't trust some people. Berengar in particular warns us about a halfling but he's *a reporter* so surely trying to write a scandalous article.

We decide that we'll leave first, head towards the left shore, to a large oak tree there. We'll wait and they'll follow. Sounds good. So we head back to our table, make a show of chatting and finishing drinks, then pay up and we're about to head out - but then the halfling approaches! **Verano** is his name. Oswen, WIS save 22; manages to avoid an epic eye roll!

There are various attempts to deflect from attempts to read up on scandal. Then Bel, deception 28, feigns a sudden bad stomach. Our very best insight in our own group is only 27 if we rolled nat 20s, so we actually believe it. Oswen is mortified and reassures the room that it's nothing from the bar as we all had the same thing, so must've been bad provisions eaten on the road. And so-on. We chase after Bel, outside into the cold, worried for him - only to find him laughing!

Oswen punches him playfully "hey you worried me!" and we head leftwards to the oak. There are actually many, but one is on a promontory sticking out into the lake that is separated a bit from the rest. Older and grander. That must be it. We head over and roll out rugs and set up bed rolls as makeshift chairs, and pull out some of our cold clothing from Yon to wrap up warm. We arrange ourselves as if watching the lake for its beauty.

Kindle and Inafina hear footsteps after a while, crunching on the frosty ground. Oswen pops out the drift globe to set it back behind; it is muted in the fog; then there's a large looming shape - then a thin shape - and a small shape. It's the three we expected. The drift globe is called back to avoid damaging night vision!

Oswen lays it out. They are concerned. They don't really understand what we want. We get to the point where the divination crossover sounding like Zorhanna, asking for help; but Oswen (Arcana with Guidance 23 with help from Nix):

* She has Planeshift, so could escape - unless she had not got her spellbook
* The necklace has a ward; if removed it will teleport back to the vault
* The vault is in the bedroom, possibly somehow linked to the divination pool
* Nix and others have been there and never seen a vault. But behind the master bedroom is a bathroom, and a tower is accessed off there which has the divination pool and nothing else as far she knows, but Zorhanna goes in there alone and comes out with a necklace - so they're connected somehow

Inafina notices that Lycoris and Berengar are exchanging glances. As if thinking they might disclose something - that Nix doesn't know. Inafina tries to talk them into speaking about it; surprisingly, Nix helps - she says rather cryptically, "Well, you were there you know the story..."

It's how she got the "**Shard Solitaire**" - the very, *very* rare "diamond" necklace. Lycoris tells the story. She stumbled upon it by mistake! A long time ago; memory might embellish or hide truth, he confesses. Eliphus and Berengar were being bodyguards, of a sort; adventurers back then; Eliphus was courting Zorhanna back then - they weren't married. The "bodyguards" and Zorhanna were asked to counter the power of a **cover of hags** (we name our three; no, three others).

* It was the **Crestfall Covern** - **Myrrel Malum**, **Esadora Crane** and **Netheria Nightblossom**
* They were using their night hag powers back then to create fear by creating nightmares and harvesting the power of the nightmares from sleeping people and infusing them into gems
* Eliphus, Berengar and Zorhanna were trying to and banish the hags away and release the nightmares from the gems so the power could not be harnessed
* There was a rougeish bard who was a fourth party member - human, a bit chaotic - was a bit careless with an idea! He put all of the gems into a Bag Of Holding while they figured how to release the power from them
* The hags came for him; they wrestled with him for the bag; he pulled it from them, looked for someone stronger to give it to, ran towards Eliphus (who it turns out is a big powerful guy and "can be even bigger if he wants") - and shoved the bag of holding into his backpack...
* ...but it was a Haversack! Disaster! A portal; a rift; the hags were pulled in, Eliphus was very badly injured too; but somehow, the adventurers managed to survive, against the odds
* One gem was *ejected* from the rift - a diamond - it seemed especially powerful; Zorhanna felt an essence of whatever plane was connected by the rift - probably not one of the hag's gems, even though it looked like one; something *else* that got yanked through. Not a nightmare inside, but instead, an immense amount of arcane power
* Zorhanna had it made into a necklace (!!!) - as one does...!
* It contains a huge amount of power; it can cast extremely powerful spells and she draws on energy within the gem to power some of her most impressive feats of magic

So she figured she could control it - and it seems for many years, perhaps as many as 20, she was right. But something's changed now.

Nix did always feel a bit uncomfortable about how powerful the gem was, so never researched what it could do more; now she wishes that she could. But Zorhanna *did* take extensive notes; they must be somewhere amongst her belongings - perhaps wherever she keeps her most precious books.

* Start with the study, suggests Nix.

Bel persuasion nat 1 and Oswen only 15 even with Guidance, so as we get into this more personal stuff, the others do clam up a bit and that's understanding. Lycrois acknowledges that we need access to parts of the house that need keys - but he's not in charge anymore. He does tell us:

* **There's always a set of keys kept in the parlour near the art room, or perhaps hidden within it**
* Other times, Lady Zorhanna locked her own keys in the study by accident and needed a spare

(Ah! So we do have a bit of proof about Fifel - we can show Fifel's map, we realise).

* **There's a missing staircase there. Kitchen down to basement is shown, then there's basement back up - on the other side - to what? It should come out in the art gallery but that's not shown.**
* Nix also is confident that the vault is in the tower, after an incident where something got broken in the bedroom and Nix had to try and cover for a staff member; she was hiding things temporarily under the bed (!) when Zorhanna came in! She elected to stay hidden. Zorhanna went into the bathroom, then she heard her on the tower stairs, and Nix assumed she must be doing a divination or something - but she saw through the doors to a divination pool, usually full of freezing water, and heard the sound of water draining; once it stopped draining, there was the sound of stone grinding, as if rotating, then a click; she saw Zorhanna put on the solitaire - Nix had to turn invisible at that point, else be discovered! - a minute later, the water rushed back into the pool.
* They agree that if we end up with the necklace but are being, say, pursued, we can pass it into any of their group to then hand to Eliphus.

We talk about timing; Lady Zorhanna is more likely to be alone before the gala, but more likely to be distracted and busy during the gala.

* We are worried more now about the Tiefling.
* We might yet need the services of "Dworp".

It's late; it's bed time! We part company and head back to our inn. We will be keeping a close watch overnight - in case of Dworp!

(End of Part 2.1)
