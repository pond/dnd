# Oswen: Part 2.24
## Campaign Day 55
### Sigil
#### RIPA reference point: During this day, that party goes to Krynn

The group wake to rattling and clanking. Oswen is emptying out every bag and pocket! Piles of stuff. "It needs to be - rare *enough*" she says and despite only having just woken up, Bel gets it. "Ah! So we go beyond the, well, the 'front desk', I suppose?" "Yes!"

Bel and Inafina can't find much. Oswen and Kindle have the Scissors of Shadow Sniping and the Amulet of the Defiled (when did we get *that*?!) - and if the Incantarium *might* be using some of this for good - "fuel" for a closed Sigil, powering the Mythal - then that's OK; either way, though, they're destroying the items. "And we'll try to sell on conditions - make ourselves difficult customers, deliberately - that they *must* destroy these and use the energy, or only use it for good, or something..." - it's a bad plan, but it's the only plan we have.

As she's looking through stuff, Oswen happens across the scroll of MK's Sword. "I - I can read this now!" she exclaims in excitement, and over the next few minutes is able to transcribe it into her spellbook. As the excitement of this new discovery fades, it does give her a sobering moment to realise just how *valuable* her spellbook is now. **And with that, she gains a new understanding of Alustriel's concerns when Sigil was closed.**

She sits for a moment, head spinning. Of course. The limitations of teleportation circle... One can draw on the weave and use it for guidance, pick any destination... Uses more power but...

It's that little spark of joy, returning. Inafina sees it and grins.

"OK, let's go. We'll say goodbye if anyone's awake but otherwise, Incantarium!"

Downstairs *almost everyone* is awake. "We're off to the Incantarium!" we announce. Alustriel says, "Hold on! I promised Vi I'd make a decision. I've been convinced by the logic both of you presented. Would you mind getting her please?" - so Inafina runs off. Upstairs, a blurry-eyed Vi; "Is something wrong?" "I think it's good news! Come downstairs quick!" Vi knows what that must be and gathers her things quickly. She slides down the banister with remarkable speed! Even Inafina is hard-pressed to keep up.

"Vi! Good morning. Sorry if I woke you..." says Alustriel. "You are right. Both of you are. It makes a lot of sense. The best option. And it is the *right* option... It is important for us to keep our eyes on the big picture, but if we forget or lose sight of the things that are important to us individually, then 'the collective' will be weaker. We must remain true to ourselves because that is what keeps each of us going! I nearly forgot that because of how frightening everything seems to be... But that is the danger of always looking at that bigger picture, I suppose. The solution might lie in the details. What do you need from us? How can we help?"

Vi is momentarily stunned into silence (!) but then gathers herself and starts asking about merging networks with the circle, a force projection with the circle that Eberron, "we will need to get the houses on side" - and so-on. Much of it is over Oswen's head though she can guess at parts of it from context. Inafina suddenly bursts out laughing. Oswen joins in. "One thing at a time Vi! Where shall we start?!"

"I need to speak to the Circle again. Can I borrow the - oh wait! You already gave it to me!"

And so-on. It's delightful. She's so excited! We do what we can to bolster her confidence with the Circle. Alustriel reminds everyone that it's an _alliance_ so both sides need to gain; it's not just servicing their desires and requests. It must be a balanced relationship.

"Thank you! Thank you for supporting this... Plan" says Vi, still a little breathless.

Inafina gives Alustriel a quick hug - she knows Alustriel won't necessarily like it! - but whispers, "thank you!" in her ear.

We head off. Bel's excited to find a breakfast venue - with some suggestions from Malaiana - but *after* the Incantarium; Bel says it'll taste much better if we're hungry.

It seems busy outside. We don't know if this is normal; it's a bit overwhelming. "So much for getting to the Incantarium when it's quiet..." says Oswen. "I guess it's *never* quiet in Sigil!" We try to get hold of Alden, our favourite Tea Street Transport driver. He's awake, working and not too far away. While we wait, Kindle notices that Bel has run off somewhere. He comes back with five drinks he's fetched from somewhere - including one for Alden! - but he's not sure what they are. Something to do with a bean. Foamy, with cream? A bit sweet though. (On Earth we'd think of it as chocolate).

Alden arrives, soon presented with his hot chocolate drink by Bel!

He's surprised we're headed to the Incantarium. On the way he hears about how it's pushing up prices a lot. Not just because people can buy items and then on-sell for profit; the Incantarium themselves go into places and buy things, to the extent that some of the outlets ban Incantarium members. They get cleaned out - which temporarily brings in a huge amount of money, but kills the business which no longer has anything to sell nor can any new stock be found.

There's already a queue outside the Incantarium. "Welcome to the Tower Sorceress. Apparently, one day the tower just - popped back up. Not that long ago, really."

He heads off for the next job. Inafina, apropos not much, announces that she's grown to quite like Alustriel. Oswen agrees that she's gone up in her estimation as of this morning! Bel thinks she's playing an angle but Kindle disagrees. Inafina thinks back - was that interaction today about her doing what she thought would get things moving smoothly, or 'real'? She lands (INS 16) on 'real'. Alustriel has things *she* wants to do, but she's putting that to one side because she's understanding what works best *for a group*.

Conceded. But perhaps it's scary in itself that Alsturiel *isn't* a Vecna "on our side". One person with one plan who knows all the answers. And that's why we need each other.

The discussion as we wait in an early-morning queue gets quite odd. Infinite money hack? What about the hazelnut generator. Kindle had wondered if there was a plane of hazelnuts. Well, could be! Bel thinks not. So we get into *that*. Why not? Bel thinks - we'd be eating sentient hazelnuts. Why sentient?! Well, a plane needs inhabitants. But there are planes with just rocks. Why not hazelnuts? And so it goes on. Anyway, point *is* that if we have a magical item that makes hazelnuts - Hey! - Kindle realises it works *in Sigil* so can't be another plane, just makes actual hazelnuts - well why not make infinite mon...

...but we're at the door. We're ushered inside.

Inside, on the wall, there's a table. If our item is there - it's just a code we can write down, go to a desk and get paid. Rats. Too easy. Oswen INV 15+15->30. Amulet of the Defiled is listed. Fortunately, the Scissors of Shadow Snipping *are not* listed and those need assessing. That's what we want.

We head in the direction that we're told to by the sign. We pass lots of "cashier" desks, each for one of the 'codes', but we're beelining for the "other things". But once there, a guard along the way tells us that we can't get back here later, so we have to change plan and try the amulet first. At the booth we're just asked for the code. Bel starts talking 1000 miles an hour to try and get the cashier to try and reveal something accidentally about how it all works! Inafina, insight 16 - uses Heroic, 15, rats, stick with the 16 - this isn't the first time someone has tried to ask questions this person isn't allowed to answer and the answer we get is very rehearsed and not useful.

Obviously, we elect to *not* give them the amulet!

Scissors, then. We're direct to the assessor rooms. Up some stairs, we're told - "room 7". There's a box we're supposed to put the item in, we're told. In practice it's more of a velvet-lined tray. It's big enough for the scissors so we place them there.

While we wait, Oswen elects to cast Detect Magic. No sensors, no scrying, Some magic items in the desk in front of us. The room itself has some magical protection, seeming to reflect things back in; contain dangerous magic; that makes sense. Almost suspiciously innocuous!

The person who eventually walks in - Oswen's spell still up - has an Abjuration aura - protection - and traces of Transmutation. That's more unexpected. It's a well-dressed, very official-acting half-orc. Glasses are taken out of a drawer; these are one of the two items Oswen detected. Then he puts on gloves - another magic item; Abjuration this time, so that's to protect *himself*. Tweezers too, long, are set to the side.

A conversation ensues and we learn that the assessor is surprised a bit as he's never seen this specific item before and has been doing this a long time. But *we* don't want the item to end up in the wrong hands - almost *any* hands that would actually use it; Bel works his magic. Inafina - nat 20, 29 insight - he is *not* of the Incantarium. He just works for them, because of his skill. He decides to answer; he has to assess the nature of the magic and describe how it can be extracted. And Inafina is sure this is true. The material needs assessing too, because the Incantarium want to know if they have anything of value in the mundane item that's left behind.

So we are confident - this *would* be destroyed. All that would be left is rusty scissors.

"It really is a remarkable, if terrible, item. I would say... Take this to the Teller on the next floor up" - he writes a note for us to take, we think with the value on - "if you're happy to part with this." He asks about other items and we only have the amulet, which we didn't part with downstairs. He's actually happy to give us another note for that. **And he even gives us a card! He really enjoys studying such items, so we can ask for him if we have more.**

We head up to the Teller. 500gp for the amulet. 12000gp for the scissors! Oswen would've guessed 3-4000gp at most at a regular shop. Payment, we note, **is platinum only**. No gems, no gold, no silver or copper. Perhaps that's a clue.

Unfortunately we get more or less nothing else. Inafina is trying to listen and watch and get a feeling for the tower interior vs the exterior. It must be magical; there is, for example, an exit from this level *to the ground floor* outside. The two mismatch. And outside, she looks back at windows that don't match things we saw inside either. Inafina matches the view she had from that window inside, as we walked up to the Teller, which was to her on the 2nd floor; from down here, it's on the *fifth* and yet somehow we exited from that floor to the ground level. If it were a demiplane, is it in any way possible for it to see inside and out like that? So perhaps we could just sort of teleport in, if we assume the same plane but a magical interior geometry?

So, Orvil flies up. The fifth floor window is what Inafina describes; our second floor, from the inside. It's interesting; curves in the stairs and wall placement makes it impossible to see what's beyond after a certain distance and that's probably by design. He can't see the floor below; the stairs, things Oswen when looking through his eyes, go further than they should.

Orvil flies higher. Just inside the 100ft range, about half way up, he flies around to check inside windows. There seem to be bedrooms, studies and lounge rooms up here, so it's a "residential" tower. Then he and Oswen agree to break contact and he carries on up higher. Nothing unusual happens; eventually he flies back down and relays telepathically-verbally what he saw. While the middle seems quite residential, the upper section of windows going up to the top almost all seem to be stairway windows. And there are gaps, too, of some 20ft in a few sections where no windows seem to be present. At the very top, he found an unusual-looking glass geodesic dome. It's easy to see inside; there appear to be structures that he can't really quite describe! Not buildings - constructions; equipment perhaps; but they seem to be made of stone. Almost sculptural but he didn't really think they looked like they were made for aesthetic reasons.

"Shall we take a look?" asks Oswen. The others nod. And we have the carpet now! So we unroll and say "hi" to the carpet and fly up. As we head up, Oswen asks Kindle if he can use Mending for the spear holes from Theros encounter. We can come just about within 30ft without causing alarm, so Oswen brings up Detect Magic again. A very strong abjuration, for starters - familiar - ARC 14+15->29; it's single-purpose and is designed to stop scrying from looking inside and even acts to mask the overall building and its interior from divination-like magic. But Detect Magic *is* divination based and worked from the inside - so this just bounces things off that are *outside*. So that's a start; we might be able to get more information from scrying when inside.

We can still simply look inside windows. But one can only see as far as the window's room, stairs, whatever. Nearer the top, things get more unusual, but familiar once again. "This is more interesting..." she murmurs out loud. "Where have I seen this before?"; HIS 14+5 -> 19; It was recent. Similar! I think - yes - it stretches out, web-like, beyond the range I can detect; a sort of net, going up and out. "Oh! It's **a bit like at Baldur's Gate,** when we activated that sort of shield. But this seems permanent; not an activated spell, though, not something 'currently switched on'. And in that case, it reminds strongly of a sort of conduit system, an unpowered-something, **like the brazier was on Theros**. And what she *can* see appears to converge at the top of this tower.

We fly up, above the tower. Oswen is looking at something nobody else can see; the 'tendrils' coming up off the top of the tower and spreading out. She can't easily extrapolate where this might lead, so she takes over navigation and flies along with the carpet. But she never reaches the 'end' before the spell runs out. It seems to just extend everywhere, but again, it's dormant. We turn back to the tower and fly back. We stay high, to avoid causing alarm, and end up roughly above it, descending slowly.

Manifest Mind; bring it up close to the tower; cast Detect Thoughts *through* it. Nothing but their own thoughts initially but then she brings it closer and closer to the geodesic dome. Nobody seems present up there on top of the roof. It's almost a sort of stone jigsaw puzzle up here - a pattern of interlocked pieces, in 3D - inside that dome. We can see that there's an entrance onto this roof but there's nobody around. The dome is about 30ft in diameter with the structure fitting most of it. Some 20ft maybe. No thoughts yet. The Manifest Mind touches the glass. And *that gives thoughts*.

She relays out loud, "Oh! That worked! I'm in, there are thoughts, but they're far away. And it's strange - it's two-directional; I'm cut off from you too. Inafina, could you keep a hand on my shoulder?" - and searches around, eventually passing through a gap in the glass. Her senses are sort of inside it now and that's very disorientating, almost like a teleport.

The thoughts are really mundane! I'm hungry; he's so annoying; I need the bathroom; I'm bored. Maybe five distinct consciousnesses? Only one seems to be thinking about equations, but it's abstract and she can't really detect anything specific from that. The bored one is whistling a tune in their head. That's distracting. She tries again to focus on the calculations. If we have so much of one thing and it decays at another rate, how much do we need to reach a threshold... That kind of thing. It's being written, not done in their heads. She realises that these people are all in the same room.

This is almost too good to be true. She has a huge range on the Mind and we're in what seems to be a safe and stable condition at-distance on the carpet. So she looks *closely* at the "construct" and realises - oh, it's familiar. Like the bowl. Old and elven, too. So there might be some commonality. And perhaps that *is* linked to Theros, in some way. This is definitely dormant. So this is also a Mythal, it's unpowered but they are gathering the resources to power it. And clearly, it's dramatically larger than the Theros one so needs much more energy.

There's no way the Lady of Pain is unaware of this, so it must be something she's OK with and/or asked them to do explicitly.

For a moment she wonders about Comprehend Languages on the elven she can see but then, a more obvious idea; use the Awakened Spellbook to fast-cast her spellbook's (unprepared) Identify through the Manifest Mind.

* A very old Mythal
* It belongs to **Mytheaerlanni** - this big thing has been transported here
* So, a Mythal of Mytheaerlanni - this is ancient the Elven city that built it
* It must be more than 8000 years old
* Identify tells her it has protective functions
* To her astonishment, it cannot tell her what it does in any detail. It's too old and...
* ...it's not just inactive; it is currently broken (damaged).

She can tell that repairs are underway. Whatever she might not know, she knows that it is protective, not offensive; but it's also currently useless. And this protection appears to stretch across as much of Sigil as we've visited while Detect Ma...

...all five of the people under Detect Thoughts suddenly think about how they're hearing an alarm. Someone is casting magic on the roof!

Oswen calls out verbally, "Get us out of here!" and dismisses (rather than pulls back - it might be followed) the Manifest Mind. Inafina's distracted by wind noise and all the things around; low perception rolls; Kindle, perception 22; he calls a warning about something he's seen and Bel, already on edge, casts L5 Invisibility before Kindle even finishes. An apparently-empty carpet now, except for Orvil who was hovering nearby; Oswen urges him to fly away on any other course. "Five people came onto the roof!" says Kindle.

Oswen kicks herself silently for casting Identify. That was what set off the alarm. She can observe again, from a distance, but won't be able to cast; whatever she wants, must be active already before the Manifest Mind goes in. She could bring it back but the people on the roof are likely to be on high alert for a while.

Once at a safe distance and sure of no pursuit we discuss, while still invisible and now hovering (with Orvil on the way back) what might be the next steps. It's frustrating to have found out so little - just confirmed already-strong suspicions. If anything, the idea that Sigil is open when a major protective device is *not* functioning is now even more confusing than it was before.

* Bel points out that he noticed no Cambians, Angels etc. on guard or inside the tower parts we saw. If we're worried about True Sight, that helps. None of us saw any sensors either.

* The Mind was able to spend a long time inside that tower without being detected. Only the foolish use of a spellcast was what gave us away. Oswen is frustrated as it might take a while for them to relax again and, given that the manifest mind emits light, she is more likely to be detected if she looks again.

* Inside the tower, divination magic worked; so if we get inside and find a place to duck and hide, we could try scrying. But from outside, there's no way. And the manifest mind is only as good as its ability to travel through open doors, windows or cracks and it was quite the stroke of luck to find a crack in that glass dome in the first place.

Well, *perhaps* using True Sight *inside* the tower might be one last check before we give up. Still invisible, Bel flies down and along to a place he'd been told was amazing for breakfast. But there's a huge queue. "No point wasting a good spell!" he says. "Hold hands and everybody follow me!" - and walks straight past the queue, dragging everyone inside! Just as someone else is about to be taken inside he drops the spell. The Maitre-De just walks up as both Kindle and Inafina are in the middle of protesting - "Ssh!" says Bel - and we're escorted in.

We end up in a courtyard with wisteria flowers growing on a pergola. Flowers fall sometimes when the wind blows. It's quite beautiful.

While we have breakfast we chat but there isn't too much left to decide right now. One more try with the Incantarium then we're kind of out of options, but we're also out of options to check other ways forward too. It's a bumper breakfast - Bel pulls out all the stops, and it's excellent - and it gives us a short rest, too. Soon enough we're back en route to the Incantarium, intending to use True Seeing.

We head into a Bookwryms on the way, looking for magical ink. Our first use of the Bookwyrms Hoaders Club Card we got from the Trade Gate outlet means we get a first-purchase discount (d20->19), helped by the "Welcome Back From The Outlands Sale" - 10% off everyday items like inks, parchments and so-on, so the 400gp becomes 360gp. At this, Bel encourages Oswen to double up - 20 levels' worth, 40gp per level thanks to the quill, 800gp -> 720gp.

The prices on a cabinet of magic items are very high; this is of course the Incantarium effect. Speaking of which - we have the Piwafwi which we could sell *here*, since it's a useful item and it would be a shame for it to be destroyed by the Incantarium; buy something simpler and more common instead. They recommend though that we go to Aurora's, which sells and buys more of those kinds of things. They're limiting sales to 3 items per person due to the "current magic item economy"!

Oswen is up-front about why we're selling this item. They offer 300gp. We don't haggle. Now, we need something - ideally morally dubious, since we believe it'll be destroyed! - to sell to the Incantarium. The clerk asks a few questions about that, but ultimately shows us a helm of telepathy. "This is often used to invade privacy!" Oh, how embarrassing. 250gp. Or "this here"... A hellfire battleaxe, made of infernal iron, traced with veins of hellfire; "if used to kill, it captures souls and -" - Oswen doesn't even wait for that sentence to finish. "That one!" - there's an entire rack of such weapons, but we can't buy all. One will suffice. 225gp. We're 75gp up on the deal so far.

"But can I interest you in this... It's 75gp..." - Heward's Handy Spice Pouch. Hmm. Oswen asks Kindle, and he agrees; could be very useful, Bel's enthusiastic too. Could do a lot for on-the-trail food!

We leave with the axe and pouch, but one cloak lighter and quite happy with that deal. "I need mushroom powder!" announces Oswen as we're headed off, which we get; it's a spell component, and expensive at that. 25gp. High-level magic is an expensive business.

Back at the Incantarium, queueing again - fortunately not much longer than earlier this morning - Oswen notes that, from the air, this isn't the *tallest* tower in Sigil but actually it's not far off. Perhaps that made it a good-enough choice for the Mythal or maybe height doesn't really matter.

Close to the front of the queue, Oswen casts her True Seeing spell on Kindle; we figure he's the tallest and will have the clearest view around the big hall inside. The idea is he'll cough if he sees something weird and she'll use Message to find out what. Outside? Nothing. Inside... He starts coughing way too much and we get quite a lot of attention! Oswen holds back and Messages him as Bel starts heading to the counter with the axe.

"Hard to describe. A whole other world overlaying this one. Like a whole other building in here!"

Oswen Messages with, "Good - look for an entrance to the other building."

"The only ones I can see are *behind* the tellers... I can't see on the stairs..."

Inafina gets Bel to keep the teller talking while Kindle and Oswen walk to get a better view; we have to walk past a guard to do that, as it's exit-ward. "Exit on the right!" he says. Message to Kindle "So?" Reply "The stairs are magical; two sets overlap. One goes in to in between." "Let's talk those!" Messages Oswen. "The in-between ones."

Oswen adv. (inspo) deception 14 - we feign a right-turn for the exit but then dash through what Oswen is *sure* is a real wall, but in the rush - ARC 19 - she knows it's *some* kind of portal. Within here there's more warping and strange magic though. Kindle is wide-eyed. It all "feels" different. We're in the Ethereal. She Messages Kindle - "The Ethereal plane, just wait one moment" - "Yes, the in-between - but now everyone over-there looks strange, Inafina and Bel" and meanwhile Oswen uses Sending (ARC 33) to Inafina (Bel's still talking) - "We're onto something but you can't reach us. Exit the building safely and we'll meet you outside when we can." Inafina replies, "OK, I don't like this; don't lose touch; we'll wait for you in the Square".

Oswen can now see the geometry of *this* plane. And Kindle can see that up stairs is a floor full of people working. She says, "I've been casting a lot and Sending didn't cause an alarm, so just give me a minute..." - he can't move without being seen, she casts Detect Thoughts; 11 people in that next room! The room above has nothing much... In fact it's strange, just *blank*. And above that though, another 7 people. Nobody below either.

Behind us, where we came in here, is a visible portal rather than a wall. If there's a room below, how is it accessed? Can we go downstairs without going through the portal; Investigation 26 indicates that we'd have to remove bricks in a wall to go around it. So that's not much use. We're exposed on these stairs, but we might as well focus on the thoughts of the people on the floor above. It's more people at work and they're packing and moving things, and labelling them. One person, "needed in room 5", and their consciousness sort of disappears. So they've left this demiplane, most likely and gone to "our" world.

Kindle says "I can go invisible"... And does so. Then there are rummaging noises and she feels something in her hand. A slightly squished cupcake - of invisibility. Message. "Genius" she says. "Here's to the fey wild!" and eats it. She telepathically says, "Now I can only talk to you like this and you can't reply, but you can squeeze my hand and you can see me, so we can work this out somehow. Let's see what happens if we carry on carefully through this floor above."

She goes in front because he can see her. She can see this ethereal-plane world just fine. We're able to get to the stairs to the next level easily enough. Oswen has to take it *very* slowly - low Stealth rolls - but we make it. Detect thoughts is faltering once we get up there. The "blank space" she detected is now below us, so at least she figures that the floors are sort-of interleaved from the perspective of this Ethereal plane building. The room we're in are the places where the assessors hang out. Artefacts are loaded into crates and taken wherever.

And that's on a pulley lift.

We have to try and time it. When the lift is loaded, we can fit on too, but at the same time as a crate is put on there so it doesn't seem to suddenly creak or sag. Someone comes down with empty crates and asks how long until the next one. "How long until the next one?" "You always ask that! It depends on the size of the items" "Well I'm not going to hang around here!" - and as he's getting on, we step on too. There's a bit of a creak and a groan from the platform.. A last Detect Thoughts reveals a surprise and "Wow, I've got to watch all those morning chocolate drinks..."

Now and again Kindle squeezes her hand. He's seeing interesting things. All she can do is mentally ask him to remember what he sees. Two sharp squeezes if we're in danger though.

Floor 4, of this strange place. We see someone coming in from a portal, carrying an empty case like we'd seen in the cashier room. Some are being loaded with platinum bars. The bars are in a huge stack in the middle of the room! There's no time see where from. We keep moving up. At floor 6 (with again nothing on floor 5 - every other floor is "blank", no exit from lift and from what she felt before, no people). Stacks of empty crates, a room to the side with two guards relaxing.

The people here aren't happy that he's come up without a crate! As they're making noise arguing, we step off. There are only four people that we can see here. It's an unloading/unpacking area. But there are other lifts across the room, an open pulley system without guards or cages. It seems to have an indication of four floors for categories of information. Floors 10, 11, 12 - and 17. It's some kind of sorting system. Floor 17 sounds interesting! But how can we get there?

A whisper in her ear. Jumps a bit. "Are we going upstairs?" She thinks back, "I think we have to" Whisper - "There are hidden stairs" - "Perfect, we'll use those! I don't see how we can use this lift without being seen." He tugs her hand to lead her. Then she's picked up! Kindle lifts her and heads to a window (!) - walks to the side of it, but then "steps through" that wall. Physical stairs again. Original plane. But this seems the guards aren't meant to use it since that portal was hidden from *that* side. "That's great, I think our clue here is that anything hidden, not a visible portal, is only meant for people who just know about it - so none of the regular employees have a clue - and that makes it more interesting."

He keeps carrying her up a floor to a doorway. She thinks to him, "I don't think we have a choice but to risk opening it. I can't use Detect Thoughts without making myself visible."

Kindle gently turns the knob and pushes the door open as gently as he can, and of course it creaks loudly! He lowers Oswen to the ground and she peeks inside, smaller than him and able to fit through. It's some kind of common room. A kitchen area. Table, chairs, that kind of thing. Very boring but at least it's empty. She thinks back, "Clear here but as Bel would say, rats! I have a feeling that we need to be on that Ethereal side for the interesting stuff, else we'll just end up - at best - on the same floor we've already seen up top."

All we can do is press on upwards. She leads the way this time, since we're still invisible. We're hopeful that these bedroom-like living areas are quiet. Stairs are in a tight spiral that's more central here. We exit onto a landing with four doors off to presumed-bedrooms. We keep going up as the stairs carry on. Then she hears a door open upstairs and footsteps headed to the stairs! She has to signal to Kindle that we need to quickly get down the stairs and back to the closest floor so we can get out of their way. Oswen is going deliberately a bit slowly since she doesn't want to bump into him and suddenly notices feet behind her - and then she's grabbed and lifted sideways (by Kindle) out of the way. It's a mage, brandishing a wand, pulling tangles out of their hair and grumbling. They carry on down. We hear crockery noises from the common room and take this opportunity to head up the stairs again.

All doors up here are open; but a gap in between two of the rooms has a ladder going up to a trap door. She thinks to Kindle, "Squeeze my hand if you think you can fit through that?" - Squeeze. She goes up and opens it just enough to see through. Squashes her hat! Movement. Someone walking around, strange noises of clanking and grinding; machinery. That noise provides cover but it's a question of timing to get out without anyone seeing the open hatch. HIS check to figure out the timing; 19+5->24. This person moves from one side of the room to the other in fixed intervals. She's "telling" Kindle about the time; only a few seconds each; she'll go through first, close the trapdoor behind her and tell Kindle mentally when it's his turn.

Up here, she can clearly see the individual; an artificer in a heavy leather apron, wearing googles with a huge arcane furnace that items are being *very carefully* loaded into. This is, despite being unusual, also clearly quite routine. There's a lift shaft visible; this is the "above board", our-plane place where the magic items are melted down.

But she also realises she's in the Ethereal! She can't "think" to him. So it's more risky; she has to time it, lift open the door and let her in. "That was really scary, you disappeared!" he whispers, covered by the noise. "Sorry!"

She watches the artificer at work (INV 26). Amulets are loaded into the machine and spigots start to drip slowly into vials at the side with a strange sort of yellow-orange plasma-like thing. When the amulets are taken out, they look the same, but Oswen presumes they're now mundane. The vials are loaded into a chest. A funny sounding alarm-like noise happens. The person looks over to the lift shaft. Oswen beckons Kindle and we head towards that, keeping to the wall, thinking to him - "there are more floors above, we might be able to keep going up!" - the lift emerges slowly, a guard onboard. "I got some for you Joyce!" -  there are some crates. The guard starts to move one but asks for help. "Joyce" comes over to help. She takes another crate but there were three piles and only one pile is gone. Oswen says "Well, let's hope those other crates are going up!" and creeps onto the platform. "Squeeze in here, Kindle, where crates were - perhaps pick me up if we need to" and, indeed, he does. The guard gets on. He *almost* bumps into the carried Oswen... No idea she's there... She's squeezed as Kindle hugs her closer and tries to push back a bit and keep her away. "Thanks!" she thinks.

But there's a creak as a crate is pushed back a little. She holds her breath, keeping in an eye on the guard; Kindle stealth 19+2, as he sort of shuffles around to try and avoid walking into the guard. The crate is repositioned but the two of us are pushed against the wall near lift controls. We move *again* to keep staying behind the guard. She keeps trying to hold her breath whenever she can! Hot bugbear breath is exhaled in relief when the handle is cranked down and the lift noisily starts to move - Kindle had been holding his breath too.

After a while we're at a new floor. The guard calls for "Brian" who seems to be missing. Another collection of cases are put just outside the edge of the lift shaft, the guard grumbling. Whatever floor this is, it's still not the topmost. So perhaps we were on 10, then 11, and now, as the guard activates the lift once more, we are on 12? The time between each is about the same. Here, an older - 250y/o ish - Dwarven guy with a mechanical prosthetic leg is working another arcane furnace on this floor. "Tupa!" shouts the guard, to get the dwarf's attention.

"GOt something for me?"

"Two more boxes. These are marked hazardous."

"Well this *is* the hazardous floor!"

There are only two boxes left on the lift. Oswen is worried that this is all there is and we'll be going down soon. Perception nat 20 + 1 -> 21. There's a narrow case tucked behind a box, leaning... Maybe that's for level 17? She thinks to Kindle - "We have to chance it and stay on here, hoping we're going up. There's one extra little box."

Suddenly as the second case is being unloaded there's a violent rock and a boom. The dwarf yells, "Find cover!" - we duck as best we can behind the guard, in turn behind the crate; Thunderwave blasts out - the dwarf has jumped behind a thick lead sheet. The walls around us get hot. CON saves - Oswen 13, who *just* avoids coughing; but she is momentarily stunned. Kindle is OK, fortunately, but is now carrying a stunned Oswen. He's worried but she *did* say that we wanted to head upwards...

...another CON save and (somewhat wasted!) nat 20 + 1 -> 21. She notices that on this floor the machine is larger and more complex. Where the other one had vials, this one has strange jars, again filling with that same plasma-liquid; and it's pouring out, not just drips. Kindle has realised she is awake. Then he puts her down and turns her to look at something - a jar rolls along the ground towards us, after the explosion... She tries to grab it! SOH ADV - weird. 3, another nat 20! She opens her bag of holding in front of it; it rolls in; she closes the bag.

"I still think we stay and hope that this last box is going up to 17" she says. "I know we're pushing our luck, to say the least, but we're so close, I'm sure of it!"

Tupa notices some jars rolling and asks the guard to get hold of them - "if one of those crack there'll be a huge explosion of Spellfire!" "Why aren't you more careful with it all?!" "I do the best with what I have! Besides, I have a box of jars over there ready to go up already - get going - less Spellfire, less boom!"

OK, we have a name. **Spellfire**.

Here we go, then. The guard cranks the lever on the lift and it starts to creak and rattle its way up past a bunch of floors with people on them. These floors look like they have experimentation going on. That's interesting. Spellfire jars, arcane tableaus, an alchemist room; contraptions in one - constructs. But we exit the Ethereal plane *just* when it's surely getting to the most exciting bit. We're back in the standard world, just at the level where Oswen wanted to find out what else was happening, hidden in the Ethereal.

It seems to be a store room with stone steps heading up. Voices up there. One person here is sat at a desk. There's a conversation about amounts. The box of jars are handed over. The small box that Oswen saw *is separate* and still on the lift. The jar boxes put into the walls seem to be in magical shelves that look cold. There's a *lot* here!

Oswen is thinking - we're *already on* 17. Upstairs? Lift or the stairs we can see? The guard picks up the box and takes it so Oswen follows, beckoning Kindle along. Oswen ADV stealth 16,19+2 -> 21. We're right behind the guy. The clerk looks up - "Are you alone?" - and we freeze - "Huh? What do you mean? Are you alright?!" "I could've sworn I heard - sensed - someone else..." "You spend *way* too much time up here. I left floor 6 alone. Oh - well actually, Brian's missing." "Brian's missing? What do you mean? He hasn't come up and he can't get past you on floor 6. He can't be *missing*." "Well I went to his floor and he wasn't there. I don't know where he could've gone! He's got to come up with here and he hasn't." "We need to go look for him! Leave the box on my desk."

It seems to be quite a big deal; "a missing Arcane Smith"; and they head back to the lift while sneak up the stairs - but we grab the box on the desk as we go past. Into the bag of holding.

Up the stairs, five people are sat at desks. There's a large alembic stands in the middle. They face outwards. Huge blackboards with things written all over. Oswen recognises that these are the five - and Kindle saw them on the roof. He squeezes her hand many times! She thinks, "I know, and in some respects this is disappointing since it seems despite the strangeness of this Ethereal combo, we've found nothing strange. Unless these people are somehow able to misuse that Mythal, then this is the end of the road for us."

Suddenly an alarm goes in the room. Oh dear. A sort of buzzing or beeping. But the reaction seems not too urgent.

"There's a potential security breach" says one to another. "The same guy who - you know - caused the kerfuffle two days ago. Apparently Brian's missing and they think that he's escaped. Somehow!"

"You mean escape is an *option*?"

"We *all* have to go. And that includes you. It's not like you're doing anything anyway! If it's anything like usual we'll be back in ten minutes."

Oswen thinks to Kindle, "We've got less than 10 minutes and then I'll have to Teleport us out of here. Escape, they said. Not so innocent as it seemed then. Be helpful if *we* found Brian for now, I'm going to look at the stuff on this floor."

INV 15+15 -> 30. With Kindle on watch she spends as much time as she can here.

* One table has a collection of unusual-looking magic items on it. Otherworldly... Far-realm almost. Twisted, warped. Good thing we've kept our Shard hidden!

* One desk is the one which she'd "overheard" via thoughts. Decay equations, loss versus input. Or actually, maybe not - as another desk has similar things.

* It seems these people are trying to improve the hold and yield of the Spellfire. We learn that it decays when it is in use. Either it is consumed immediately or it sort of "bleeds off".

* They want to break through the threshold to break through and make this Mythalar work. But nobody here seems to have worked out the next level of power. Going *beyond* level 9 magic.

* No matter how much they push in, the Mythalar absorbs it and then the Spellfire just decays away. We've seen that on Theros.

Now the Alembic, *that* seems to be feeding Spellfire back into the weave itself. This comparatively small piece of apparatus - about 7ft high - is probably enough to feed back into Sigil once closed. So all we've found are the things to feed back and the thing to protect.

She runs out of things on this floor, so heads downstairs.

* The clerk's desk has a ledger and marked in red there are indications of things going missing. A second ledger reports individual jars or entire crates that are unexplained missing Spellfire. There's quite a lot less than their records indicate they expect.

* There's a note slipped in between pages. **"Request received for further funds. Delivery on <date>. Ensure extra security present as usual. With Her Majesty's regards, update requested"** - and the time is late today - around 11:20pm.

So these people don't know and we still have no idea. They think it's decaying in-jar? Or someone is syphoning it off secretly. This is perhaps why they're paranoid about a missing person. And "escape"; the five here sound like they're not sticking around willingly.

The lift starts to come back up. Oswen is frustrated. "So close but so far. I think our time is, sadly, up; we'd better get to the Square."

Just before she casts Teleport she overhears something about, "monumental waste of time", "hardly like he's going to be just standing around", and so-on. It seems that they might not have found this Brian person. "But the hours here are horrendous and they don't let us out, why can't we just go out or go walk or see a show, it's *like* we're prisoners in here!" "You knew this is what you signed up to! The opportunity of a lifetime; think about it, we could go down in history as the first people to re-awaken a Mythal in millennia. Isn't that worth a little sacrifice?"

The lift is seconds away. She casts Teleport. Loud alarms go off as she does!

We pop into the square. Message to Inafina. "Are you here? Where are you?" - this makes her visible but she says to Kindle, "Stay invisible for a minute" - ears pop up over the fountain on the other side. It's her. Bel's there too. "You've been gone *ages!*" - at that moment, Alden arrives dropping off some people. We get in - "just the three of you?" he asks. Then when Kindle gets aboard he figures it out. "Grease pit?" "Why not?" And off we go. And as we're leaving, Inafina notices a bunch of guards start to run out of the tower. She overhears, "Whatever it was, exited here!" - but we're already leaving - "A little girl!" says one. "We saw a little girl just before she disappeared!"

Once we're fully out of sight, Oswen says, "Damn, I left it too late - they saw us - well, me. At least they've got the wrong idea for now but it wouldn't take much to put two and two together."

Back at the Grease Pit, Kindle is visible again. It's not like we're especially hungry, but Bel looks at the rather withdrawn Oswen. "Oswen - um - did you have some cake or something?" "Is there some on me?!" - seems she has some on the side of her mouth. "Oops! It was the invisibility cupcake!"

We do lunch, but light since breakfast was big and quite recent. Eventually, we're done and we end up heading back to Alustriel's sanctum (and our current lodgings).



### 1pm

Vi's still there. In a room adjacent to the library, a kind of family room, she has a whole lot of stuff laid out. "Ah, just the person!" says Oswen. "What's this - oh, and I think you need to be really careful with it - big boom!" - and pulls out the spellfire jar.

Vi takes the jar but finds it strange. "I've never seen it before. It *feels* magical. No! It feels like magic. So this is some kind of magic essence?"

Oswen does her best to explain. Alustriel walks in, glances at the jar and says, "That's Spellfire" - "Yes, that's what they called it in the tower." "We've been studying that." "Why have *we* been studying it...?" asks Oswen. "Interesting" answers Alustriel; "We think that Vecna is trying to harness Spellfire. And there's someone who wants to talk to you!" - she smiles - "Head up to the 2nd floor. Room on the right."

Curious. Calling back "Yes, and some of those jars have been going missing!" says Oswen as she's going to the indicated room. She knocks. It's Tasha.

"Oswen! Come in!"

Oswen comes in. And lying on the bed is Zorhanna! She looks *exhausted*. "I'd ask if you're OK but - obviously not - yet you are here!"

"Oswen? Inafina! Bel. Kindle! My goodness." She leans forward a bit to give Oswen a hug. "I've missed all of you..."

"What happened?"

"I was captured! But then these people were sent to rescue me... They brought me back. But not before we - umm - defeated a sorcerer king and - umm... Athas! Athas, it's dying. We took the rod. The piece of the rod..." - it's all scattered and incoherent.

"I'd love to hear more but perhaps in a few days!" says Oswen as Tasha insists Zorhanna needs to sleep. Tasha goes to fetch some tea to help her sleep again.

Kindle is curious about her condition and looks at her. "You're not... Ill... Not sick. What's going on, Zorhanna?" he asks.

"I was right!" she says, looking more 'with it' for a moment. "Vecna has been on Athas. He sucked *all* the magic out of that world. It's a barren desert - no magic - if you cast any spell, the weave is so damaged that it draws the life-force out of living things! I've never seen a world with so little magic left. And yet, there are beings there who defile it; who draw more out of this collapsing weave... Horrifying. I'm afraid it's - I have these nightmares that it's coming here. That it's going to happen here. *Where* did all that magic go? A *whole plane* of magic, just gone! I don't know if Alustriel understands what I am saying. Something is really bad and it's getting worse, *fast*. Why is Sigil open?"

Later, Tasha is back. Zorhanna is holding back from telling her anything; playing the "very tired" game. After excusing ourselves, we take Tasha aside and explain - Zorhanna trusts us, but not Tasha. More to the point it's that Zorhanna might not trust *anyone* in the circle; she's worried/paranoid. We discuss options and the reason why we might not just scare Alustriel with "maybe" theories.

A 3-inch wide cube floating in the middle of a tube. There are symbols on each side, but not runes. It's kind of "leaking" magic! The tube is possibly protecting us a *bit*. We've no idea. Alustriel might. She's still down with Vi, discussing something-or-other. The jar is on the table, apparently uninteresting. As soon as she sets eyes on it, Alustriel says, "You can't have *THAT*! That is not allowed in Sigil!" - and Vi walks over, "Woah! Where'd you get a cubic gate? And this one is damaged!"

When we start to explain again about the Incantarium, the use of Spellfire with the Mithil is interesting - Alustriel thinks that the **Spellfire is being poured in is *not decaying* It's being *used*. Siphoned off.**

Vi hands Oswen a book opened on a page that explains Cubic Gate. It sounds impressive - not as flexible as the amulet, but a much bigger, stable portal lasting about a minute and keyed strongly to specific locations. This is damaged though and unstable. Vi thinks she could fix it, around 8 hours; and Alustriel thinks it worthwhile spending the time, as she recognises the 6 symbols indicating the keyed destinations:

* Pandemonium
* The Far Realm
* The Fey Wild
* Astral Plane
* The Radiant Citadel
* Sigil

(Zorhanna later notices that this includes *no* material planes, implying it was created/set up by an entity with no reason to visit, or interest in, material planes).

A destination *into* Sigil? But Gate - Oswen has learned - can stop its destination end being created by a deity of that domain. So that would surely not work. So why had anyone ever done that... As for the Radiant Citadel, Oswen's less sure about protections there but *is* astonished that this exists and very happy that we now have it so nobody else can just step into the Radiant Citadel unannounced... Except, of course, for the question of **whoever was able to make this object in the first place** and the closely related question of how it got damaged.

Alustriel has a theory about Sigil. The donut. It floats around the spire - well, just above it. What's in the middle? It can't be travelled to. Theory: There's a nexus of all creation. The doors are entrypoints. It's the nexus that matters, not Sigil. Close Sigil and it closes access to the doors, but not the centre that Sigil floats around. What if She believes that Vecna has found a way to reach that nexus?

"What if that Mythal isn't meant to protect Sigil. What if it is meant to encase the centre, so that Vecna cannot reach it?"

Or what if Vecna *needs* it, opines Oswen. Maybe *he* is one step ahead of *her*.

* Whoever set the Mythal up must know *something* of this magic. There are precious few people who can do that. Surely it must be the Lady Of Pain herself.

* But whoever is financing it is not The Lady Of Pain; "Her Majesty", we're told, is never how she'd be addressed.

* And whoever is choosing to try and power it up appears to not have much of a clue. Maybe the Lady Of Pain is just using some intermediary for communication and payment.

We end up spending a good couple of hours flying spireward and on circumference courses on the carpet, ritual-casting Detect Magic over and over, taking spot measurements and tracking measurements to confirm:

* We cannot know the exact shape of the enclosed (or not enclosed) area beyond the inner wall of the torus.

* We do know that the Mythal "tendrils" do not appear to ever extend from that spireward section down (or up!) to the city on the rimward inner-facing edges of that torus. So it protects the "sky" and not the "ground".

* So if it encloses anything, then what it encloses *is* in the centre and that lends weight to Alustriel's theory.



### 4pm

We return and report. The Lady of Pain is either protecting nothing, or protecting whatever is "in the middle".

Malaiana thinks everyone is super stressed. Zorhanna is awake and Malaiana insists that she wants the house cleaned properly; the unseen servants can do it; "I think we should all have a game of racketball in the park".

Sounds awful but we agree of course, because the spirit of the thing is the important part. At least other people seem to be likewise sportsing in the expensive area of town!



### 7pm

Dinner time. We eat well. The mood is good just because Zorhanna's back. Vi is a bit distracted though, wanting to get back to work on the Gate.

Oswen heads into a quiet corner. She's rested and had An Idea... She thinks of the Mythalar and casts Legend Lore. It's full a punt.

* This is a Mythal created by the ancient elves, the Eaerlanni who remained after most other elves left for Evermeet
* Their city was Mytheaerlanni and it was created to protect that city
* The recent of that city, trained in the ways of the Mythalar, could tap into it and channel magic into it - but it needed a *lot* - to activate or change its effects:
    - Encase or protect (Bar Entry Into)
    - Teleport the city away (In Case Of Dire Emergency)
* It is a standard Mythal. It must be powered by Circle magic. But it must be activated - awakened - first.
* When Mytheaerlanni fell, its Mythal had been deactivated.
* Its current state is therefore both Deactivated and Unpowered, yet Configured.
* This is a very famous Mythal! It was the blueprint for all of the Mythals that the Netherese created subsequently, since the Netherese were taught by the Eaerlanni elves.

Exactly what blocking the Nexus off would mean is unclear, but most likely, only slow planar travel would work. No fast-travel, if we presume that it's all routed through that Nexus. Oswen is fairly confident that the lattice she'd seen was a defensive configuration and not a teleport configuration, given its resemblance to similar arrangements of defence seen at Baldur's Gate and Theros.

Since we're here, Oswen remembers to return "Of Serpents And Skies" - the Theros book - and likewise gives "Young Sage's Little Book Of Gods" back of Mordenkainen, only to find that he forgot about where he'd lent it and bought another copy anyway.

It's getting close to stake-out-o-clock. Vi finishes the gate beforehand; she was helped by a small creature, mechanical, somewhat akin or Orvil and called Aura; and she cast a spell that created an additional construct, a mechanical gnome, which lasted long enough to get everything sorted out. She explains it would usually have taken much longer without them. We hand it over to Alustriel for further study - perhaps we can figure out who/what made it, maybe why, maybe what's so important that it was taken upstairs... We don't really know.

Vi has a way to fast-travel to the tower. She would walk with us if we didn't, but we have the carpet. Off we go! She asks us to fly close to street level and lead the way. She presses something on her ring and a mechanism unfolds into a kind of long board, which hovers just above the ground. "It's a wind skiff!" she says. "Lead the way!"



### 11pm

Usually we fly crow-flies with the carpet. But with Bel's help, Oswen (ADV SUR 24) is able to navigate down at street level, the two of them remembering Alden's routes and shortcuts. We make good time and would arrive comfortably ahead of the time we expected for the delivery, but Vi stops us about a block away.

It's actually somewhat quieter. Sigil does have *some* kind of day-night cadence!

We of course don't know where exactly to look. We need to stake out the tower somehow. We investigate to see if we can figure out where there might be a good place to do this - teleport is unlikely given the tower's defences, so physical delivery seems possible. "Can you see invisible things?" asks Vi; but Oswen doesn't have See Invisibility and can't recast True Seeing today. But Vi pulls out some kind of lantern. "I can see invisible things for a period; but this will help you" - a lantern of revealing.

With Vi's help, Oswen ADV INV 32, we find a door with a series of invisible runes. Well, that's certainly interesting. What's more, there's an additional hidden door inset into that door - very unusual! She realises that reading the runes would activate the magic there. We decide not to, as it might alert people inside; instead we find a hiding place and keep watch. Kindle activates Twilight Sanctuary; it helps hide us, plus it grants 17 temp HP; and he grants Eyes Of Night. 300ft darkvision!

We watch and listen. Oswen can't do much really; it's dark and we're relatively distance. Inafina's keen ears aren't that much on point either - but Vi produces an ear horn! "Try this!" - ADV perception was 9,11+7->18, plus 5 Flash of Genius -> 23. But what she hears is strange. In Sigil, people don't do horses much; yet that's what she hears - an almost nostalgic welcome to the sound of hooves and wagon or cart. We can't see anything but that's not hugely surprising all things considered.

Then she hears snorting and smells brimstone. Oh! Not a horse. Some kind of fire devil perhaps; a demon would likely be too chaotic for whatever *this* is. It's heading towards the door. By DM dice roll - we're 50ft away. Detect Thoughts wouldn't be too useful. But Oswen figures - there are people wandering around; she can wander around too - cross the square, happening to be close to the door. Keep the lantern hidden though! She casts Detect Thoughts, Messages Bel - "Going to take a look, playing innocent, Bel, come with me" and off she goes. Bel, to Oswen's surprise, pulls a bottle of nowhere and plays drunk! Deception 28. VERY drunk!

Oswen leans into it, playing the "come on, let's get you home" card.

Within 30ft of the door Oswen picks up the surface thoughts. "I god. I hate Sigil. Drunk people everywhere. There are meant to be runs here... Where - oh - the next one? - There..." - reads three of them. There's a very faint shimmer which seems to move from the door to the wall next to it; a darker portal of some kind appears momentarily.

Bel goes to the edge of the fountain and decides to act like he's sick. This gives Oswen more time to watch what's going on. The thoughts. "By the queen! Where *are* they. They were given the time. I don't want to hang around here."

Oswen uses Message to contact Vi. "We might need to attack. Please stand by." - the answer is "Roger Roger". Oswen's confused, is this devil called Roger?!

Via Eyes of Night, she thinks she sees a figure in the darkness of the portal. It's momentary. A new voice in the thoughts; she shifts focus to the new individual. They have moved just outside the "anti-divination field", it seems. "Oh dear, wait, too far!" and the voice goes away. Rats, as Bel might say, were he not pretending to throw up in the fountain.

"Such a weird bunch. All these protocols. I hope I don't have to do the next delivery".

Time is passing and the spell won't last long. Oswen considers pushing deeper. But Inafina, with her earhorn, hears someone say out loud, "I'm here to make the delivery". A response; "Yes, of course. Do you have it?" Meanwhile, Oswen is hearing thoughts; "I'll just get it. It's on the horse." Whatever the probably-devil is doing, the thoughts complain about something being too heavy; "I thought it was meant to make things heavy!"

Oswen tries to see what's going on. But these people are invisible, it's a handover so an object might *become* visible, but even burning heroic inspo (Bel having inspired people during our downtime at the sanctum) ADV perception only 13. Some kind of chest, indeed momentarily visible. It looks similar to chests at Brimstone Hold, actually; very old look, old treasure. Probably a pocket dimension given the thought-complaints about weight. A pair of hands grab it and pull it inside. She hears the devil processing the verbal response; "Please thank the Queen of Dragons for her support. The plans progress. We will have results to report soon." and that person answers, front-of-mind thoughts; "there had better be. Her patience won't last forever." Some kind of greeting feeling for Tiamat. *More* dragon cults? Too much coincidence. She readies herself... The moment that portal closes, she will dig deeper into the thoughts.

WIS 18, pushes in, *and* starts running towards that figure, pulling out the lantern; shouts to Bel, "Game's up!" - but she hears Kindle's thoughts as she starts getting close, "Oh no, not again!"

The tiefling fails the save. She gets some answers as she's running closer and lighting up the lantern. As she skids to a halt, she sees to her horror a *skeletal* horse with a mane of smoke and fire. A deep red Tiefling, strange smooth skin, has just mounted the horse; they wear **actual-from-pictures-in-recent-history-books Cult Of The Dragon clothing** and a full cultist face mask, fashioned dragon-like. A wide, billowing two-part cloak that looks like wings. They pull back inadvertently as the thoughts spell intrudes, causing the horse to rear up.

Oswen wants to know what it is they are waiting for. What the tower is doing - in short - *why* are these payment being made?

**They need them to fully reactivate the Mythal, and then a saboteur within the tower will subvert it - an ancient vampire - old enough to know to control it. This is Tiamat's will. She has been sending money from her casino in Avernus!**

That's all she gets; this person doesn't know in what way it will be subverted. And this person is now very aware of what Oswen just did. It screeches, and draws a shadow blade. Oswen shouts back, "Careful with that or you'll annoy the Harmonium!" The response is, "Theft of thought is a crime as well!"

Initiative!

* Inafina nat 20 -> 30!
* Bel 20
* Vi 14
* Kindle 13
* Oswen 8

Inafina closes the ground with incredible speed. She hits with the staff & Stunning Strike but the tiefling does not succumb. 9 bludgeoning & 1 charge -> 5 lightning, which seems to have the expected impact, but it reacts with Hellish Rebuke. Infernal fire is drawn to it and projected out to her. DEX save - 29. Evasion -> no 4d10 fire damage. She avoids being hurt but it knocks her off balance a bit and the next swipe with the staff *just* hits. Despite the hit and 3d8 lightning this time, the damage is only 18. So for good measure, she throws in flurry of blows - fists this time, her feet being used for the wind boots to get a bit closer vertically, given the tiefling is on the horse - all three hit, for 3d10+18 equivalent, 33 total.

Bel runs in front of Oswen to end up directly in front of horse and rider. "I hope this works...!" - L4 Leirol's Silver Lance. This is one the rest of the party has never seen before. A jangling series of very rapid chords are played and a bright silver beam of light bursts out of the guitar - a thick, bright blast of light, some 5ft wide, at least 100ft in reach; potential damage 4d8 -> 28; STR saves for horse and rider. The horse is knocked back, and the rider falls off, but rolls out deftly to being crushed. There's a bit of collateral damage in street furniture from the huge blast; "I hope that helped!" he shouts to Oswen, granting her Bardic Inspiration.

The tiefling stands, very angry. They discard their shadow blade and start to cast; Oswen recognises Fireball and casts Counterspell. CON 21 is failed & the spell fizzles. So now the tiefling re-draws the shadow blade. It has the impression of a pact weapon, pulled from a shadow dimension. The tiefling starts to approach - floating! - and closes ground, but doesn't get into range just yet, given the distance they were thrown back by Bel's spell.

Vi moves so fast it's almost a blur. She *builds* some kind of weapon - a strange, gaping-mouth like thing that almost looks like an open-mouthed... Chipmunk?! What's more, she's somehow made two of them as she went. She aims both and they fire some kind of projectile at the Tiefling, at much the same time as some kind of shimmering field appears around her; some kind of arcane shield, Oswen thinks, encompassing Vi and Kindle. Both projectiles hit; 20 and 19 force damage respectively and, each time, the tiefling is pushed back 5ft by the impact.

Kindle runs in and *grapples the skeletal horse!* As a bonus action his spiritual weapon appears. It's no longer a ladle! Now, a rolling pin looms above. It hits the tiefling, dealing 7 force damage.

Oswen is torn between something like an upcast ice-based Chromatic Orb or Psychic Lance. She opts for the latter. INT 18 save - and the tiefling fails! 23 psychic damage and it's incapacitated. Oswen thinks she can reach Vi's shield, so she joins Vi there. Oswen shouts, "Everyone! Capture, don't kill. Harmonium! God's business within Sigil and a saboteur in the tower."

Inafina re-engages and attacks, hearing Oswen but not holding back. This adversary is hardy. ADV attacks due to incapacitation. First hit, 13+13 damage -> 26. Second hit, 7 damage; and another flurry of 3 hits, 40 damage! The tiefling is now very badly injured.

Bel shouts back, "I don't think that's illegal. It's more likely that what *we're* doing is illegal!"; he casts Starry Wisp - 16 to hit, just makes it - 15 radiant damage. Then he, too, runs into Vi's protected area. He draws an ornate cane and casts Shillelagh on it.

The tiefling is unable to act due to Oswen's successful prior spell.

Vi uses her bonus action to do something with her shoes and wheels appear under them! It's akin to Haste. She whizzes over to the tiefling and pulls out a chain somehow; the cultist is soon wrapped in chains, then she moves back into the protected area.

The horse shakes free from Kindle's grip and starts to run back towards the now-chained Tiefling, but Kindle reacts and successfully gets his grapple back. He tries to pin the horse down on the ground - nat 20! It's quite something to see.

Oswen says, "Does anybody know how to call the harmonium?" but Vi answers, "I think they just arrive when there's public disturbance; but I'm not sure it's a good idea to involve them!" So Oswen tries to intimidate - only 13. Counter-roll 19+3! "You're a fool! You've crossed the wrong god. The Mother of Dragons will see you all burn!"

Inafina tries to knock the tiefling out. Unarmed strike hits, max possible damage 16, works; unconscious. "What about the horse?!" asks Kindle. "Do I let it go?"

Oswen says, "Don't let it near the tiefling, in case it can heal or something but - yes!" - her Detect Thoughts spell never got anything from the horse, so there's nothing too strange about it. Kindle slaps the horse on the butt and it runs off down the street!

WIS saves, with advantage for every except Inafina.

* Inafina flat 19+4 -> 23
* Oswen ADV 22
* Vi ADV 19
* Kindle ADV 19
* Bel ADV but fails badly - 8+0; heroic inspo 14; not quite; Vi calls, "It's the Harmonium! Don't resist! *Slide* out of it!" - he relaxes and avoids freezing up (effective 19)

It was a field of Hold Person. Oswen says, "Well, I guess there's no leaving the Harmonium out of it now..."

Two very over-the-top looking, full red regalia individuals are approaching. They hold strange polearms, almost like magical staffs. Their strange red armour has stylised blades, presumably a nod to the Lady Of Pain.

"HALT! There's been a disturbance of the peace! Explain yourselves, citizens!"

Oswen nudges Bel and walks forward and says, "We apologise for the disturbance. We encountered a sabotage plot and, in so doing, this unconscious individual moved to attack us" - it's a lie by omission. Bel pitches in about a skeleton horse appearing out of thin air! Oswen ADV deception; 9, nat 20 -> 25. Oswen senses Detect Thoughts being used to scan the two of us. But it's lying by omission and so, interestingly, they detect just what she said.

"Hmm. I'm sure the two of you are hiding something! But it's been a busy night. We will take the prisoner."

We have to concede. At least it gets (her, we now realise) off our hands.

Inafina makes a show of taking off the chain. In so doing, she's trying to see if there are any things in pockets that might be interesting. With heroic inspo, 19; Vi comes over, "Oh, yes, I need to take that chain back!" - another Flash of Genius - so that's SOH 24 equivalent. She finds a clasp that seems interesting, a ring and a couple of small metal dragon currency-like items that she thinks are likely cult-related and might serve as proof, or at least help find out where she's from. We didn't even get a name.

(*That* could be a job for Ignatious. Or what about the missing Spellfire?)

We head off on foot as the prisoner is escorted away. Inafina shows the group the things she managed to recover. Kindle asks, "and do you think *this* is useful?" - as he'd somehow ended up with a satchel that was hanging off the horse. Seems to be a (saddle)bag of holding; the chest maybe came out of that. But with a bag of holding, you usually think about what you want in order to take it out. We don't know what might be in there! Oswen thinks - ARC 33 - "if you turn it inside out, *everything* in it falls out."

Maybe we'd better wait until we're not in the middle of the street to do that!

### Midnight, give or take

Eventually we get back to the Sanctum. Kindle and Vi each carry one of the "canons" ("they'll last an hour and you never know!" says Vi) and, of course, this alerts people to the strange things going on. It's around midnight, but people get up and hear the story, before retiring back to bed, essentially to sleep on it.

To counter the vampire specifically, says Alustriel, would seem to need us to infiltrate the tower; join them and go beyond sneaking. An alternative, thinks Oswen, might be to infiltrate the cult itself and try to get at it that from that side - but this presumes the cultists know where the vampire might be.

There's a long conversation about how to know what's important and what's not. The TL;DR - Alustriel knows there are very pressing issues and lacks the information to assess whether or not the Incantarium issues are equally urgent. Oswen has no idea. It's all "above pay grade"! In the end, it seems the tie-break could be - get someone like Ignatious to take up the investigation in their stead, so Alustriel might have a chance of getting the information she needs to make a more informed decision while, in the mean time, we're free to head off to help with urgent, known-important matters.

Back in our room, Kindle fixes a note to the Satchel of Holding so nobody accidentally puts it into the portable hole or any *other* bag of holding! Useful safety tip. We realise we never got around to emptying it, so do that now and Inafina adds her stuff too. It's quite a strange thing to see the things just sort of falling out of the bag in a stream!

* Clasp
* Ring
* Dragon cult currency pieces x 2 and...
* ...a further 10 currency pieces in a small pouch, of the same currency type - dragons, Oswen HIS 20+5! This is just standard Waterdeep currency. Their standardised 2gp-equivalent currency is called a Dragon. **So in total we have 12 dragons, 24gp equivalent.**
* A somewhat worn and damaged set of studded leather armour. Perhaps it was being kept maybe to be repaired; more stealthy than the armour the tiefling lady had on, for sure.
* Jewellery - a set of silver leaf earrings and a necklace made of strung-together silver leaves.
* A scimitar in a scabbard!
* A potion of healing
* A jewellers toolkit
* A wand. Hmmm. Oswen ARC 21... Oh. Another Wand of Secrets!

Oswen recognises the clasp now she's in an arcana-minded mood. An Insignia of Claws; a sort of dragon cult boost. There are also some notes and folded bits of paper; Oswen reads:

* A few Sigil door (portal) locations.
* A time with a reminder - "Remember, Sigil keeps its own time; check the city clocks for calibration. Do not be late. They will only be at the door for the minute and no longer."
* Another note; "If you have a chance to visit a bank, get some for Brian - he must be needing it."

Ah, so Brian *is* in on it. So if we could find Brian we might have a bit of an extra insight. Inafina points and says, "No, wait. It'd say money. Does it mean something else, like, a some kind of other bank? Like those food banks." Oswen isn't sure and Inafina grabs the note and say "I'll be right back!" - and runs up to Alustriel's room. She asks about banks. Food banks - "no, they're called soup kitchens". Malaiana mentions a "blood bank". Inafina is somewhat horrified, "What on *earth* is a blood bank?" - the Mort have this, one of the best in the multiverse, with donated blood. Apparently it has some use with some kinds of healing magic or medicine.

As Inafina gets over the shock of that, she realises what it means. Oh dear, just when Oswen had seemed to make peace with the idea of not pursuing things further... Inafina says, "Oh, I know who the vampire is."

"Oh! You think this Brian person? Well - that kind of makes sense."

After they part, Inafina returns to the room and says, "Well I've some ideas, but I'll talk about it in the morning. I'm tired."

Bel's already in his nightgown and bids us goodnight. Kindle finishes praying and feeds squirrel. Oswen's already gone to bed. As Inafina gets into hers, she hears Oswen say quietly:

"I know you've figured it out. But I don't think I want to know what it is until morning, either!"



## Campaign Day 56

We wake up gently, Bel playing soft music, inspiring us to face the day ahead. Without much in the way of any prompting, Inafina looks at Oswen and says "Well, turns out the Mort have a thing where they collect donated blood as it's useful for medicinal things. And it's called a blood bank."

"...Oh. Oh! Oh..."

"But I promised Alustriel that I wouldn't let you do anything rash! And Alustriel said you might feel different when you hear whatever she's planning today."

"Me? Rash?!"

We head downstairs for breakfast. Vi leaves for Eberron today and we wish her the very best, thanking her again for fixing the Cube. "If you feel like not doing what Alustriel wants, you are welcome to join me - we make a good team!"

Once everyone is present, we get down to businesses.

An update from Mordenkainen on the blueprints for the device we think Vecna copied. "Not great news... This "reality engine" if scaled up massively would require a *lot* of magic, both an initial big infusion and then and a constant draw thereafter. Since it needs so much power that it would rapidly consume a world and then fail, it must be located somewhere between worlds. The Astral Sea is probably too empty. someone would need to be powering it with huge amounts of magic to keep it stable. I don't know how they'd do that. The only we know that might do that would be an ancient form of high magic..." "Like a Mythal" "Yes, like a Mythal; but the kind of circle magic that just can't be performed anymore - a lot of those have been lost to time."

Talking about the "local" Mythal, Oswen realises that there are more options than she thought there. The activation of the Mythal might actually be what Vecna wants, the Incatarium knowingly playing both sides; Tiamat's interference might be to work *against* Vecna, whether or not She knows that it'll mess up his plans. Mordenkainen points out that there could be *many* groups in play - never mind "only" three from the suspected third group responsible for the missing Spellfire. This is Sigil - 13 factions that try to be kept in balance!

Alustriel says that we were probably very lucky yesterday to get the answers we got (yes, no argument from us!) but there's no direct reason to assume that luck will hold or that we'll get answers we *need* if we seek out Brian The Vampire. But it might, and if we want to pursue that - so be it. However, Alustriel has something else. "Understand that I would do this myself if I had the time - if I didn't think I must be here, for various reasons."

She continues, "No-one here is able to activate the Mythal. No matter what the reasons are, I believe that the Mythal is at the heart of it all." (Oswen looks sceptical!) "Why else would maybe three factions be focused on it? Mordenkainen you are probably more correct than you believe; there are at least three factions but there needs to be one more - us. We need to be another faction. **We need that Mythal to work *for us*. We need to control it - harness it and power it, but power it the old-fashioned way.** The way my people have done for tens of thousands of years."

She draws in a deep breath and says; "That means - Oswen - are you willing to search for lost knowledge through time? It could take a while, at least relatively, in your terms. And it will take you to at least three places I can think of, if not more, because first you will need to learn circle magic; that opens the door to learn High Magic. And High Magic - well you can only really learn that from my people. They're the only ones who have mastered it, unless you can find a way to obtain that knowledge from the source of the circle magic. The hardest, though; master the Mythal itself. That is probably the most complex magic that I am aware of today. You could study Mythals that are active - I know of at least three that currently work on Toril. Or if you can find a descendant who held onto this knowledge - descendants of the First Peoples, either in Evermeet or the Erlan or Silvanesti or... Well, you get the idea! They may have passed this knowledge down through the generations to specific keepers of lore."

She adds, "This is no small thing I ask of you. And I will think no less of you if you think you have something else you'd rather do. Oh and she'll need to rest more, but perhaps if you want, you might want to take Zorhanna with you? I'm sure she would love to go!"

Oswen looks with a raised eyebrow to Inafina. "In your opinion - no offence, Alustriel! - *is that* Alustriel?"

Inafina, INS 26, yes, it's her, albeit with strained logic.

Oswen is very surprised. I mean, for her to be offered such a thing! It's almost self-serving to say yes. And the logic leap is huge, after Alustriel yesterday had talked about not making such leaps. But it seems the arguments that Oswen had made yesterday did get factored in along with all the other big players that seem now involved in some way with this Mythal. So on balance - it rose to the top of the pile. Things are coming to a head; it's a matter of time before someone breaks the code and figures out how to start the Mythal. It feels like an escalation "geared to overwhelm us", an inflection point.

Inafina picks up something else, as this is said. Something Alustriel isn't saying.

"If it's an inflection point" says Inafina, "then now is not the time for secrets, or fear."

"Interesting choice of words, Inafina..." says Alustriel "...because I must confess there is some fear here! I have been thinking Oswen about your description of the Mythal and what we uncovered yesterday. It's true that the Mythal could be shielding and protecting the nexus, trying to stop others from getting in; or to grant whoever controls it the power to harness the Nexus. But there is one other thing the Mythal can be configured to do."

"Teleport" says Oswen.

"Yes. One of the options we must consider to keep on the table is that we fail. That we fail..." - her voice actually cracks a bit! - "...and if that happens I need you to **take control of that Mythal and teleport all of the living beings in Sigil away**, or they'll perish. In a battle between the Lady of Pain, Vecna and Tiamat, there can be no survivors. Can you do that for me?! I pray that does not come to pass. But I haven't been able to shake that vision - that *if* that happens, could we let hundreds of thousands perish?"

We all watched Toril fall. Alustriel's seeing that at the scale of Sigil.

"Well of course I would *try*. Though I'd need a good idea of *where to*" (though she has an idea; the Radiant Citadel has taken whole worlds before, and we happen to have a connection and a duty to that place).

Anyway, it seems there are few other options but it's weird and conflicting, because in many ways, Oswen can scarcely believe her luck - to the point that it feels almost wrong asking the rest of the party to come. "This - just feels like a *me* thing, like, all about a me. And yes I'll need help, but I'm uncomfortable with this being the Oswen Gets Everything show!"

That personal conflict aside, Oswen says, "well, for me, from my side - yes and I'll gladly accept Zorhanna's help too. If she'll come."

Alustriel says "Yes, I - um - haven't actually asked her yet!"

Oswen says "Right then. Where do we start?"



### 10am

We've said goodbye to anyone that's leaving. Alustriel preps us for the quest ahead. It all relates to high magic, which *used* to be just - normal, and called simply 'magic'. But of course a lot has happened and now, that isn't routinely accessible. To mimic the effects of what happened previously, we use techniques we call high magic.

As for mythals - they're "just" very powerful magic artefacts basically. These can't be created anymore now, and strong ones haven't been created for tens of thousands of years, but the Netherese did make some - weaker, but still mythals - more recently.

* First, learn circle magic. It's one form of high magic.
* Next, learn and understand mythals enough how to activate one - wake it up.
* Dig deeper into high magic to learn what kind can manipulate a mythal so that it does different things.

So where do we go?

* The first one - we think that'll be the Anauroch Desert on Toril.
* The rest - far less concrete. Maybe current elves in Evermeet are old enough. But maybe we'll get lucky, back in the Netherese empire and able to study a mythal in place.

Alustriel wants to find a more stable time gate than the short-lived unstable ones that she knows about already. Those could give her anything from a few minutes to a few days, but who knows if it would be enough. Alustriel knows of two gates, one which is quite short lived and one which is days-to-weeks. That's the stable one.

Alustriel can't really explain more until Oswen has read a book! So Oswen decides to read it. She skims through to find areas of interest (INV 28) and reads sections on specific things of interest related to the travel ahead. In practice it only takes maybe 30 minutes.

* There are flying cities and cities on the ground.
* The ones in the air are very difficult to get into, but those are the magical ones.
* The short-lived time gate appears on one of those cities. Part of its instability is believed to come from the fact that the destination location can move.
* The stable gate is down on the ground, and so she'll have to make her way to a flying city somehow. That could be difficult.

More on sky cities - a caste and class system. That's part of why it's hard to get there.

* People don't physically fly up. They are transported from the ground via portal. There are special locations on the ground.
* Caste and classes - not everyone is allowed up? The book doesn't have details. It's a history book, and it's been pieced together from what the author understood and had studied, but it's obviously not thousands of years old!
* That said, the two major classes, ignoring subdivisions, are the High and the Low; the High are in the flying cities and the Low serve them. They're separated mostly by magical aptitude. A form of elitism with that at its base.

The overuse of magic is what made things go wrong. The time gates, as we call them, are actually a side effect of something that they broke. They're an accident. It's more akin to them accidentally tearing a portal to the future, not us being able to visit the past. There is a belief that they *were* trying to experiment with changes in the flow of time, but also a belief that these gates were definitely not an expected outcome.

The time gates are linked to an original physical location and can't go beyond that. Even if the location on the ground is now different - a crashed city, not a flying one - they're linked to where they *were*. It's a bit like the teleport spells that require an object from the location to which you want to return, as if that object "remembers its home".

When people go into a gate and live, they sort of flicker almost imperceptibly - back almost immediately. It's as if they never really went. Nobody knows if they physically went there, never left, or physically went there as a copy, perhaps leaving that copy behind... Could be anything. There's a vague analogy to Tasha, except our Tasha will vanish and be gone, while in this case, you remember what happened to you through the gate.

Anyway, what of the castes? Down in the Low class, there are the people who grow and farm. Merchants and traders. It's almost like your profession, except you're born into it. Showing magical aptitude gets you out of it, into the High class. The book can't tell us much about what the castes are like there except to say that they are believed to still be a Thing, but Oswen wouldn't be too surprised if it was akin to divisions such as sorcerers, wizards and necromancy.

Oswen wonders how long they might be searching for this stable gate in the desert. Alustriel shows her a map. "This is the closest thing we can provide to help us find where you need to go. I wish we could do better, but..." - it's a map of old Netheril! The city of **Conch**, shown roughly centrally, is our target. One option might have been Tulthantar - by a lake - but that flew and crashed into Mythdrannor so that'd be the place to try and find gate amongst the remains. We think you can reach Eileanar from Conch, though, and as you remember, Bigby thinks he might have found that but it's mostly buried under the desert. But we're not trying to go direct to a flying city; it's Conch.

It takes a while, Oswen referring to a low-detail map she has of the desert, but she's sure in the end that she's identified the right mountain range. Planning to get a Decanter of Endless Water, Oswen says she'll head out - but Alustriel already has one! Inafina packs that away - her speed means she could get to people quickly if they were in need. "And this is something I once found very useful; I don't use it anymore, but maybe you might? In the right circumstances it could really save you with keeping magic going. I even found it could help when someone tried to counter a spell I was casting."

She hands Oswen a beautiful delicate Elven mithril amulet on a thin chain. It's an amulet of health. Very useful!

We spend a couple of hours on a shopping trip, topping up rations, tea, other such things; we get some hot weather gear as we're not sure how long we might be in the desert or how hot ancient Netheril might be. Our bank account has about 33K gold in it (!) so we add another 17K to bring it to a round 50K. We have a staggering 100K or so in party funds anyway, and figure that if it was all lost/stolen, 50K in the bank is a *huge* sum to get started again with. Bel even finds himself a cane, which he thinks is distinguished!

Along the way, Kindle spots a shield in a shop window. It's beautiful; he's immediately captivated. Very unlike him! Of course, we go in. Oswen ARC 18 isn't too sure what it might be; turns out to be a Repulsion shield. "Vi had one just like it. It's a bit on the small side" - he tries it - "but surprisingly heavy..." Oswen says, "It's *reassuringly* heavy!" - it definitely looks on inspection like an artificer made it. There's some kind of mechanism involved. If his reactions are quick enough, the shield can emit a pulse of force that pushes assailants away - potentially quite some distance (up to 15ft). It seems a bit of a bargain at 500gp given the current trading conditions. He's even able to part-exchange with his old shield - albeit only for 5gp; it's quite beaten up. Aaaaand since he's there... "Are you attached to your chain mail?" asks the shop keeper. "Would you consider plate, perhaps?" No. Too heavy, and too noisy! Oswen asks, "Well what about something akin to chain that's - well, enhanced. Magically!" - and yes, indeed, there's +1 chain mail here. It's not an Aurora's, so no discount, but we realise now just how beaten up Kindle's kit is! He's had the same thing forever. But maybe the horse wrestling was the last straw. But we realise that Mithril armour might even be *cheaper* than +1 chain. Plate armour is very shiny; split mithril could be worn under clothes, but plate can't really; most of it is very fancy, but they do have a surprisingly plain, toned-down set in a sort of powder dusted blue which Kindle really liked, which is exactly his style. It's no compromise in weight or stealth thanks to the metal, but a significant boost in protection. 2500gp is a significant sum but, again, somehow it seems - well, cheap, for what it offers.

Oswen is quietly delighted - she's always worried about Kindle getting hurt.



### 1pm

Back at the sanctum, we change into the desert clothing. Bel packs away his light crossbow and bolts, for the first time ever. It's as if he's outgrown it. Kindle realises he can put away his heavy crossbow, too. His magic has become easily powerful enough instead.

We're just about ready. We stand in a circle, checking in. Yep. All ready.

There's a... moment. A recollection of everything. From first meeting. A price of 1 silver being a lot. One world being enough. A pumpkin farm. Pumpkin soup by the fire.

It's Inafina that says it. "Just look at us!"

Oswen nods. "Come a long way, haven't we. And about to go a significant distance further, I wager. So. We're all up for this?"

"Yep!" says Kindle.

Bel says, "Thing is, I've stayed with you all because you're smart. We don't just run into fights. We try to avoid them. We're not - we're not rash. And there's adventure... I'll be able to make good songs and stories!"

We're lighter; our gear is better optimised. We're stronger and more capable. For the first time it feels like we're really ready to face the future, rather than relying on things from our past; we have confidence in our abilities.

At the foyer, Alustriel comes down and we're joined by Zorhanna. She's still not well enough to come with us. "I thought I'd be ready - but I'm not."

Oswen hugs her. "I'll miss you, it would've been fun. But you do need to rest!" - and with Message - "I will teach you anything I can when I get. Alustriel feels guilty. Don't let her be over-protective!"

Zorhanna replies... "I'm pretty sure she'll have her hands full".

"I don't know if I've ever been this excited and this frightened, at the same time" says Oswen to Alustriel. She leads us to the library and a floor-to-ceiling mirror between two bookshelves. We've noticed it before; it's quite impressive, but always seemed to be just a mirror. "Do *not* tell anyone this - when we had the Sanctum built, we built it here because this is the site of one of the 'all gate' portals in the city. It does not take you anywhere, but allows you to cast a *translocation* spell into it. We don't need to leave the Sanctum to transport ourselves somewhere. It can't be used often though."

She's going to use this to send us all to the closest location we can guess in modern-day Toril to find what remains of Conch. Alustriel casts Planeshift. Oswen thinks this mirror allows translocation-like spells to "act normally" in its vicinity. **It's an exception to the city-wide effect** - even Oswen could use her amulet here.

As the importance of this revelation hits Oswen, Inafina shouts "Last one there's a rotten egg!" and runs in first! Bel calls, "Hey! Not fair!" and goes in after. Kindle is looking at Oswen and Oswen says to Alustriel, "I have to go, but please remember - a door as extraordinary as this, that breaks all the rules, might be opened in ***both directions***. Keep this closely watched!" and goes in. Kindle walks up to hold her hand and, together, they step through.

(End of Part 2.24)
