# Oswen: Part 2.9
## Campaign day 20 (ref. Toril, but with numerous planar discontinuities and time zone changes)
### Sigil, Ladies Ward, gathering of wizards, 2pm

The meeting is going to start, comprising us plus:

* Alustriel Silverhand
* Lady Zorhanna
* Jallarzi
* Mordenkainen
* Otiluke
* Otto
* Bigby
* Vi

Mordenkainen starts the meeting, repeating the doom-laden prediction that we have already heard. There are various responses around the room. Bigby, for example, asks if this is just paranoia! "No, **my dear apprentice**" replies Mordenkainen, suggesting his divinations are always accurate in the bigger picture - only issues of timing, or small details are wrong. Faces in the room indicate that not all agree!

Alustriel acknowledges that Vecna *has* indeed been seen and is on the move, and her sister has sensed increased activity on her own world (Toril) and "I am inclined to take her view, that this might be another nexus event". And whether r not it's Vecna, she says, "certainly *something* is converging! Have *you* all not sensed it, also?" - Zorhanna acknowledges it and says she's also not had access to Oerth for a while. Others pipe up to say that it's not entirely true - "we have been able to travel to and from Oerth, so the plane is not _closed_" answers Otiluke, so Zorhanna has to clarify. "But what mode of transport did you use?" and Jallarzi answers, as both she and Otiluke had visited; "My patron is rather skilled at circumventing planar barriers" and Oswen before she can stop herself says, "So there *is* a barrier". That's at least understood, but the cause is not.

There are some mentions of "why isn't she here to answer for this?" - and when Oswen asks who "she" is - the answer is surprising; one name is Iggwlv, *not* the Lady Of Pain. Vecna is Iggwlv's son and so they think Iggwlv should be here to answer "for what her son is up to!" - we later enquire about that and find out that this isn't a reference to Vecha; Iggwlv bore the son of a demon lord, the son called **Iuz**.

(Iggwlv - AKA Tasha - AKA Zybilna).

"Petty squabbles aren't important" says Vi and: 

* Eberron may be protected for now "but we know that he has set his sights on it"
* She has found some of his agents on the plane of Ravnica
* Her opinion is that some serious destabilisation is happening

There is an open question about any more information. Oswen nervously speaks up about their experiences. When it comes to the book, things get nasty. Otto accuses Mordenkainen of hubris and putting us in danger; then Otiluke says that the real reason was that Mordenkainen didn't want anyone *else* to get that book.

Things get heated; Alustriel intervenes; Oswen points out we are not knowledgeable, experienced or powerful relatively, but we are not totally naive, went into it knowing we might die but aware of the importance of that mission. We chose it willingly and it is better in the hands of *anyone* in this room, than in the hands of those at Brimstone Hold.

Jallarzi points out that Vecna is fashioning himself as the god of *secrets*. Not lies, secrets. So this council which has historically not openly shared all information due to the nature of the represented organisations or people, cannot do that anymore; they themselves could become tools of Vecna.

Attention turns to the creature Oswen saw in the Far Realm, which Zorhanna witnessed too. Oswen describes it as best she can. The two of them were somehow *inside* that creature, it was protecting them - after a fashion - from the creature. Otto now pipes up and describes a few things; they match our memory. He starts pulling books out; scribbles on paper; then turns to Bigby with a "hunch" asking for help. Jallarzi is ahead of them both - they are all thinking the same thing.

She says, "This is **Hadar the Hungry, the Ever Hungry, the Devourer**. Hadar fills the void." 

Oswen sasy, "Well, Hadar the Hungry, the Ever Hungry, the Devourer is afraid. It said we should run."

(There's confusion at "Run" but Zorhanna confirms the sentiment, since it was all mental pictures instead of words).

Zorhanna points out that **Hadar wanted to escape to the Fey Wild**. Otto seizes upon that; "Why the Fey Wild? What's special about the Fey Wild?" - Bel says, "Well, it's ruled by two queens; Titania and the Queen Of Air And Darkness. Is that significant?" What might Hadar think the two of them could do to protect their realms? Oswen says, well, they do seem to be able to will into existence things via pure imagination. **Otto says he'll research it. It's bugging him**. The fact the Fey Wild sits "parallel" to a material plane seems significant, especially given the current belief that Vecna is only after the material words, and the material worlds ring Sigil, so getting to Sigil must be his ultimate aim.

"He could challenge the Lady Of Pain for control of Sigil."

And yet, all in the room insist that she has full control, and if she closes the doors, nobody and nothing can get in or out. Including Vecna.

There's also not yet a full belief that Vecna is intending to destroy everything, it's likely an overreaction; Otiluke even opines that he's not sure why the door to there is closed - he's been there - it has the usual problems of any plane, but nothing much seems otherwise amiss.

Vi argues that the last time Vecna rose, "you all tried and you lost! That's why he's a god now! So let's not do *that* again. I have *real* planes with *real* people to protect, so let's stop just yapping and come up with a plan to *do* something. I'm sure the Halfling agrees with me! The time for discussion is *now*. Action. Let's do it! What's the plan? What plane is he after next? Where do we send our forces?" and Vi looks to Oswen.

Oswen nods and says, "Best guess we have is the next plane is Toril."

Zorhanna steps forward and asks Oswen if she still has the ball she gave her. Oswen nods and digs it out of her backpack. "Great!" she says and produces her own, too. Then Alustriel fetches one from a nearby stand. Otiluke has one too, as does Bigby it transpires. Five in all. "Shall we begin?" asks Alustriel and Oswen says, "I think what you're planning might be rather above me?" Zorhanna says it's fine; it's just Scrying as a ritual. But Oswen has only just bought the inks to transcribe it!

There's some surprise that Oswen can do it so quickly. Zorhanna helps a bit as she writes (very quickly) to speed it up even faster, less than 10 minutes for the whole thing, while Bel breaks the ice by suggesting, "Shall we get some tea?!" loudly, much to Otto's pleasure. Alustriel seems quite pleased; "That is a rare skill - remarkable." "Thank you", says Oswen, blushing slightly. This time it's a bit different though as the L5 scroll disappears, as if cast, when transcription is complete. (Hand-wave Sigil, Oswen's experiences and Zorhanna's help as the reason for this; RAW 2014/2024 say it should've always happened but we just didn't notice with prior transcriptions until now).

So now, we all cast Scrying simultaneously - fortunately, Oswen has a L5 slot free.

She's never seen a ritual circle casting like this before; five wizards with Alustriel at the head of the circle weaving all of the spells together. She understands that it's making the spell more powerful, probably per participant, which means that five people taking a spell that's already quite powerful must be doing something really quite extraordinary. In fact, she doesn't realise it's a full **tenth level**, well above what any individual could do alone.

Suddenly a collage of images across all of Toril can be seen! Oswen realises she can hone in on individual things with thought. Alustriel is guiding everyone; "search something you know; look to see how things are progressing; search especially for any elements of *his* forces that you are aware of."

Oswen perception, only 9; too busy with the spell. Inafina 8, no idea! Bel also finds it super confusing. But Kindle, 21, sees a strange lich-like creature on a couple of the crystal balls; Bigby suddenly exclaims, "Oh! Found him!" then Zorhanna, "Yes, I see him to?". Alustriel now gasps. "Wait, where are *you* looking? That - that can't be?"... Zorhanna - "He's at Silverymoon!" - Otiluke - "No, he's at Baldur's Gate" - Bigby - "No, he's at Waterdeep"; Oswen now focuses harder, as Kindle whispers what he saw in her ear, at Ordulin - and sees a strange, huge storm cloud has rolled in, but nothing else seems to be going on; the clouds seem to be rolling towards the coast; so she does her best to briefly explain what she sees out loud. Alustriel starts to panic a bit! The spell falters and Otiluke calls out to her to hold things together. "But I need to warn her! I need to warn my sister! He's headed for Waterdeep! Someone *please* Message her!" so Mordenkainen shouts over, "I can, but what should I say?" **"Warn her that Vecna is approaching Waterdeep any second now!"**

The spell holds for several minutes. Oswen thinks - those other city names seemed big; Ordulin isn't; that cloud was rolling that way; she focuses on Selaunt instead. And here, a strange, Tsunami-like wave, creatures of the deep rising up, assaulting the cliffs. Defences are being alerted as far as she can tell, but they're slow to react to the scale of the attack. Now she sees Vecna, as she focus over to the Senate. He floats over the centre, apparently addressing it. Cowering. So Oswen calls out, "He's not *just* at Waterdeep. It's as the others say. He is simultaneously somehow in several places at once. I see him at Selgaunt now." Vi argues it's not possible; "How can he have so many simulacra?!" - and then to Oswen's horror, she sees what seems to be the Senate *yielding* to Vecna, to try and avoid death and destruction. She even sees a senator she met - the one who was trying to rouse popularist ideas - but he's arguing that they are cowards and should fight; perhaps she was wrong about this man. They argue. "Never treat with the devil!" she hears over the din; and then Vecna just strikes him down - he dies instantly.

Oswen CON save, 8+1, she almost loses concentration - she almost *wants* to lose concentration - but Bel tries to help; inspiration D8 is only 1; that just scrapes a DC10 concentration, but anyway, the spell is flickering. Whatever Alustriel is seeing seems especially bad. "We have to save them! We must save them!" she suddenly shouts. Otiluke shouts back, "Don't you *dare* drop the spell! Mordenkainen, *please* back me on this!" - Oswen only half-hears this - **but Jallazi and Otto step in to help; they each cast what Oswen later hears was Wish, to save specific people, pulling them through somewhere. "It's too soon. It's too early! We need to pull people out to survive the next fight!"**

Oswen, this time, with the whole party behind her, *almost* keeps it going - CON save 19, on a DC 20 - but before that, she sees Selgaunt surrender. There's no widespread destruction there, physically. As the Wish spell is being cast, the whole circle starts to falter; she can't figure out what is going on; she can't quite hold that spell up, with the 19 vs 20. The spell collapses and all five crystal balls fall to the ground.

Now she looks up, to see Mordenkainen, Otto and Jallazi also fall, very weak; Alustriel seems unconscious.

Oswen looks, feeling detached. She doesn't really know what they did. But she knows what they were saying. And all she can do is first say, "What - what in all the nine hells did I just see? What did *we* just see?" and then walks up to Otiluke and points at him, then shouting, now angry at the universe in general, "IS *THAT* ENOUGH FOR YOU OR IS *THAT* TOO DRAMATIC?" - the rest of her party has never seen her so angry, or heard her shout so loud.

Otilkue, unexpectedly, draws her in for a hug. "I'm sorry. It'll be OK. We'll figure something out."

"My friends are - lost. Anyone we didn't rescue into the Fey Wild is gone." She means in the sense of submission, of course. But others then each describe their experience. Cities burning. Towers burning. Kraken, titans, fire giants. Waterdeep and Silverymoon were both very heavily attacked, Baldur's Gate too. Selgaun's submission just makes Oswen even more angry and she also feels embarrassed, like, her own people didn't even put up a fight, except the one person she didn't even like! Yes, they would argue that they protected the city. But how could they possibly know what submission to Vecna meant? In the end, it was unquantifiable. Cowardice, really. The region has experienced battle before. It is supposed to stand up for what's right. She finds herself wishing she'd scried Cormyr instead, remaining ignorant of her own region's behaviour.

Vi comes over to check if Oswen is OK. Oswen doesn't even know. She doesn't know, despite what we all saw, what the fate of her world even is; are people alive but prisoners, alive but now servants of Vecna, or just dead? Some seemed to live, but how long will Vecna let them continue to do so? It's almost worse, because it's such a mess. She doesn't know what happened. She doesn't know how she feels.

Vi talks of having witnessed worlds fall before. **People go underground. People resist.** "Wars are not fought in one day. They can sometimes go for decades. We can try and support the resistance; that's what me and my people do. And if I can help the people on your world - believe me, *I will*. What we need to do now is send help through to Toril. Help them regain control and fight back against Vecna; to resist. But we can't do that unless we have the strength to do so ourselves. I know it's going to be difficult, but we must, now, strategise and plan. *Then* act. Acting rashly might be worse than doing nothing at all. If nothing else, you have the Council of Eight now *fully* aware. And you have our undivided attention. We will undo this; we will get your world back. You have my word and my sword."

Oswen thanks her, but does say that we've seen the true power now of Vecna - she'll take Vi's word to *do her best* to bring back the world. But none of us can _promise_ to actually bring anything back.

People start to leave. The people who cast Wish, along with Alustriel, require help to even walk. Oswen tries to phrase a question about who, or what, they did, but Jallarzi seems to be just saying, "what, it can't be, why?" over and over; Alustriel is crying, "I don't know why - it didn't work - we failed - I tried to save my sister, to pull her here - but no-ones arrived".

Oswen says, "I can't help. The magic was beyond me. But if the Lady Of Pain closed the doors at the moment we were trying to rescue people and our scrying was failing, that might explain it." She is very unsure if that's the right thing to say; but Zorhanna agrees. "That's very possible." - She scoops up her crystal ball and casts Scrying again. This time, nothing. The plane seems closed, at least from Sigil. Oswen says, "If you really want to know what's happening there, I might know a few giants and a tower out by the lake next to Trade Gate, who claim to have been building a sort of cross-planar spyglass."

Before we actually leave the room, Alustriel stops us. "We cannot rest! We must make a plan!" - she pulls herself upright on her staff; "We need to get out. If we're going to help anyone, we need to get out NOW" and then she clarifies that we must get out of Sigil just as Oswen understands and says, at the same time, "All the doors might close! We might be trapped!" - but unfortunately it's panic, people teleport to doors they know before anyone's said where they are going. Oswen is suddenly left in an empty room with Vi and Bigby and her party.

Oswen is tapped out for teleport; she knows of the door at the old abandoned circus. Vi can't teleport anyway, but Bigby can and he knows the place luckily. He casts. It takes a minute; we walk through and out to a commotion. "The doors are closing!" we hear and all over, people are running. Some even fall through portals they open underneath them; some **run into walls but they don't open...** So now, we pick up the pace and run too!

D6->5... We lift the broken curtains, run through but it's really odd this time. It's slow and jerky and when we appear on the other side, we've fallen, face first, as if we'd dropped quite a distance. We're all hurt. And Oswen guesses - it was closing *as we went through*.

We are at least free. We pick ourselves up and we're in the Outlands. It's a clearing; Oswen remembers the location; she says, "I think this is close to the rim - near Ecstasy."

Vi and Bigby aren't thrilled at being way out on the rim! Well, best Oswen could do under the circumstances of *only knowing two gates* and both are a way out.

Vi uses some kind of device to cast a spell of some kind; it seems activated by speaking into a device. "Where are you! You all just disappeared. We need somewhere to meet!" - must be like a Sending Stone.

The TL;DR is that people want to meet eventually - with some urgent errands to - "at the Standing Stones". Vi asks if Bigby can teleport us there. "You don't understand how magic works do you! I can't just teleport at will, whenever. We need to take a rest."

Oswen also realises she's feeling very tired and drained; almost empty. It seems the others aren't going to meet for a while anyway. So Kindle does what Kindle does and starts setting up a camp and hut. Oswen then notices Bel is quiet. Inafina is just hanging back, as she does, keeping an eye on Oswen. It's strangely comforting, a sort of guardian angel feeling.

Oswen puts her hand on Bel's arm. "How you feeling?" He stutters an "I'm OK... What's going on, Oswen? What's happening?"

They have a heart-to-heart, as best either of them can, given how in shock they are. In the end, Bel asks what he can do right now. Kindle's in the hut, finished with setup; we all go inside. Bel says, "It might sound silly, but right now, I think just a song to make things seem - a bit more normal."

Vi tinkers with a mechanical bird, saying it's her friend and talks to *her*. But it isn't a fey creature, it's not a Familiar; it seems some mechanical thing she just brought to life. "How do you *do* that?!" asks Oswen. Vi tries to explain about just "circuitry and joints and soldering", and her and Bigby get into an argument about it being science vs magic. Oswen says, "Well, whatever it is, it's a school of study with which I am not familiar, but it clearly produces impressive results."

Apparently the bird can take Watch outside, so we don't have to.

Oswen decides to transcribe her remaining scrolls to see if it calms her down. She ends up chatting with Bigby during it and he gives her some ideas and tips about modifying or even creating her own spells one day. He says that the original spell for Bigby's Hand was Telekenesis and is kind enough to let Oswen transcribe that, too, leaving her with enough ink for three more levels of transcription. He goes into more detail about how spell creation works, and in so doing explains how she might be able to create her own magic items (and Oswen starts to understand much more thoroughly why they are so expensive to buy, given the effort involved!)

This reminds Oswen of the Incantarium; at least their ability to chew up magic items will be heavily limited. And people in Sigil may well have a change of heart about exchanging them for gold - just how useful would gold be in a city that's now completely closed off from everywhere else? Bel looks rueful - "And people won't be able to get their funds out of the bank!" - but then Vi says that all major worlds (cough, Toril isn't major) have bank branches that we could use. Well, we have 38,000 reasons to find one of *those*.

Oswen notices something odd about Bigby during all the talking; he doesn't seem to always remember that he's a gnome. She remembers some talk that implied he adopts this form, or at least *used* to be larger and not gnome-sized! Eventually she can't help herself, even though it seems impolite, to ask - was he larger once?! Vi giggles. Bigby sighs. "Yes. Uuuuh - I was. Yes. I used to be human." He tells a story about he'd written a book about giants, but somehow got embroiled in an altercation between a fire giant and a red dragon and - the red dragon ate him! "Because there was no body left, I had to get reincarnated. It's always a bit of a roll of the dice when you do that... And this is what I got."

Finally, we sleep.



## Outlands near Ecstasy, Campaign day 21
### Morning, rough equivalent of what would feel like 8am on Toril

Inafina is first to wake in the hut, roused by a less-than-pleasant dream. She quickly notices an absence - Oswen is not here. She hurries outside and looks around. A short distance away, atop a ridge behind the hut, sits Oswen. A light rain is falling. Inafina is alarmed - this is atypical behaviour for sure, and given the horrors of yesterday, who knows what Oswen is thinking! She rushes up the ridge.

Oswen has been sat since around 6am, deep in thought. She periodically, almost without thinking, is casting Prestidigitation, pushing water out of her clothes. It's a very strange sight; a hint of a glow of a blueish arcane light, then the rain lifting out of the fibres of her hat and cowl, then running quickly to the ground as if the clothing was made of a highly polished metal.

"Are you..." starts Inafina; "...I'm OK. Surprisingly!" is the response.

Oswen apologises for causing alarm, but she needed a period to *think* - alone, unclouded and free-wheeling. She launches into a bit of a monologue but it amounts to:

* She should perhaps feel worse about Toril, yet somehow, it doesn't feel that bad.
* Guilt; those most close to her were rescued into the Fey. She should feel worse for those left behind!
* Yet Selgaunt yielded to Vecna, so maybe life in Ordulin isn't so bad. We just don't know.
* She'd always viewed the destruction or conquest of worlds as all - violence, destruction, fire. The end result looking like something out of the Nine Hells. Whatever Vecna is doing looked nothing like that.
* And so, she is sad and uncertain, but does not truly know the fate of Toril today any more than she did yesterday. Questions answers were matched or exceeded by new questions created.

So now she says:

"So that's me. As for Kindle, I think he's ignoring it - pushing it away - going into routine and work to avoid the problem. Bel's confessed he is scared and uncertain, with no idea what the future holds or what he should do. I fear I was of little solace to him. And then there's you, 'Fina. You already know everything I've said about the others, I think; I've seen you watching. But you're more unreadable now than you ever were - and in that, I mean no disrespect; I think you might be trying to not be a burden to us, but bear a burden yourself which could be shared. After all, when it was my turn - I worried about my home. And I wonder - do you worry about yours?"

Inafina's ears drop; she slumps a little, as if giving up on an internal fight. She almost whispers her answer at first.

"Yes. Despite all that happened at the monastery. Despite all the bad things. I worry about what evil comes soon to my home and the people there."

They sit in silence for a while. There are no birds around and there is no wind. The only sound is that of the rain pattering softly on the ground.

Oswen says, "We knew what was coming to Toril but we couldn't stop it. This is far, far beyond us. What happened there will happen on more worlds. We know that. All we can do, then, is play our part - *if* we know what that part is! And to that end, we have new allies. Now, I like and trust those two..." - she points at the hut where Vi and Bigby still sleep - "...as they seem grounded and genuine, but in being so grounded, they have the same perspective as us in many ways; they can only do what is within their powers, but don't seem sure what actions to take. So then, we have the others. And of them - well, they did not create a good impression! They politely did the equivalent of laughing at *us*, and outwardly mocked poor Mordenkainen. But **he was right**. When we scryed, and by the grace of the gods..." - Inafina looks surprised at that comment, which Oswen notices and adds - "...(and more on the gods later!), we somehow were there at the exact moment when Vecna started his assault. I think there is no coincidence in this, but that does not matter for now. What matters is the reaction. Reasonable, emotional reactions. Surprise at the powers of Vecna, fear for loved ones, and very clearly, in the moment, **no idea what to do either**."

Inafina nods. "Alustriel... Her sister. I felt for her. Yet, she is so powerful! The most powerful and experienced of that whole group, I think. But she panicked."

"Yes. And we heard some indications that they've tackled Vecna before - and lost, and he became a god, and for all that, somehow they tried to dismiss as alarmist news of his rise. That is hard to understand. For these reasons and others, which I think we both understand fully, my trust falls with only one man and one organisation. Mordenkainen might not have all the answers and he might make a lot of mistakes, but he was right about the most important things. And the Golden Vault have been taking action, long before that council of eight even met. It is from *them* and them alone that I suggest we take our guidance."

Us two are in agreement; we will discuss it if we have a private moment with Bel and Kindle, to see what their thoughts are. Inafina seems a bit more relaxed; she confesses that it doesn't really *help* much to know we can't do anything, but at the same time, there is a certain "letting go" of anxieties - focus on that which you can control and can make a difference. Try not to focus on things beyond.

Moreover, the amulet lets us visit worlds at whim. If Inafina has business to conclude on her world, we can go there in an instant. Kindle likewise. Oswen still hasn't quite got used to it - it seems impossible that something so powerful exists. It seems to break all the rules of spells or even limitations that other magic items seem to always have, including very powerful ones of which she is aware. It might damage the weave when used. But under the circumstances - **use it we should, without hesitation**.

Inafina remembers Oswen's mention of "grace of god". She didn't think Oswen believed in gods.

"Ah!" chuckles Oswen, "I think I finally figured that out too. People say that to me and I've never been sure how to answer. I think I can answer better now. I know gods exist, or things at least which we refer to as such. Creatures, entities; consciousnesses. Kindle, for example, clearly draws his magical power from a connection to his god. It brings him comfort and strength, and through him, the rest of us have benefitted often." (She points at the hut, rather redundantly, as if reinforcing the point). "Vecna is referred to as a god now as well. From what we saw with scrying, it seems hard to argue. Paladins have their faith and their magic. Warlocks have a connection to something often considered god-like in their patrons. These things are real. They are facts of these worlds."

"So why do you say you do not believe in them?"

"That is the good question, yes. I am misunderstood. I mean it in the sense wherein one might believe the best player in a sporting team can help them to victory. The belief that the accomplished acrobat can jump across the wide gorge. The belief that the mighty warrior can slay the dragon. I do not *believe* that gods will do, or even *can* do, as we want, when we want, why we want. They do what *they* want, when *they* want, for their own reasons. If our desires align, we think they heard us. I do not believe we are so important, save perhaps for a scant few that might have an unusually close connection to that which they consider to be a deity. For me, these beings are mighty, yet ineffable. **Toril fell yet I saw no gods move to help**. I'm sure they have their reasons, but the faithful on that world might be tackling some terribly difficult questions about their faith, amongst all their other present concerns! I have no direct connection to a deity and I certainly do not wish to fawn to a god to *try and gain* its favour; that form of slavery is not one to which I personally chose to subscribe. And, for all I am doubtless arrogant and hubristic in my own way, I do not have what I might *consider* to be the form of arrogance exhibited by the person who prays to a god to try and curry favour, then claims to understand the will of that god in return."

"So it is similar to your thoughts on Vecna, then? Take guidance from things you *do* trust and *can* understand?"

"Yes. But, look, for those who have a true belief that they do trust and understand something as powerful as a god and, indeed, can in some way command the power of that deity to help them in their goals? Perhaps I have envy. But as you say, it's like my thoughts on Vecna. I can only act within the boundaries of that with which I am capable. Worrying about the 'what if' of greater power is a fruitless endeavour, even if it is, without doubt, a strongly tempting line of thought on many occasions."

Oswen casts Prestidigitation on Inafina. Rain water is pushed out of her fur, running down over her and to the ground as if running over polished metal.

Inafina stands. "Let's head back". She reaches out her hand. Oswen takes it, and hand-in-hand, they walk down the ridge and back to Kindle's magical hut.

---

At the hut, Bigby is sipping on a honey tea reading a book. Vi is outside, checking traps. Oswen nods a greeting and simply says, "You, we trust. But I think our paths take us in different directions." Vi looks up with goggles on and says, "Did you find anything interesting out there?" and Oswen replies, "As much clarity as I'm likely to find in a while." "Do you need time to prepare before we go?" "No, I don't think so. Let's collect everyone, make sure the bags are packed and head off."

Oswen finds time to get our group of four aside and give them the short version of what she thought. But it's not a dictatorship and she values their insight. Bel thinks the group is entirely dysfunctional! Kindle though is quiet. "I don't know. I'm not even really sure what happened yesterday." He was from Toril too; was in war, got left behind, got rescued (by halflings); he's left everything behind before.

Although he seems OK, and Inafina doesn't want to second guess it, she lays a hand on his arm as he's explaining - a rare gesture - and says, "Yes. But never forget, it goes both ways. As you help and protect us, so we help and protect you, should you need us. Just say the word."

Back at Bigby and Vi, Bigby is mostly done drawing a teleportation circle. "Everyone stay close!" Oswen tries to remember the circle but the last runes are drawn swiftly and we rush in. Arcana 18; she doesn't remember it. We jump through!

We emerge in a large, beautiful-looking clearing with many moss-covered rocks including a circle of standing stones; rounded obelisks of various sizes. Between the moss, flowers and creepers, we can see that they seem covered in runes. Beyond the clearing the area is wooded. This is a secluded glade. The air smells sweet; it almost seems Fey; Oswen can't help but ask, almost on reflex, "Wait, are still in the Outlands?" "Yes, of course we are! We are on the same plane. Just another part of the wheel. It's near the Beastlands!"

Nobody else seems to be here. Vi gets to claim her preferred camping spot!

Oswen tries foraging. 4+5! She has no idea what anything here *is* - on close inspection, every plant and animal is different from those with which she is familiar. Who knows what is edible, or poisonous.

Oswen switches spells; Bigby reads his book; Bel plays music; Inafina practices some acrobatics; Kindle sets up an increasingly iterated and ever-more excellent camp.

After a couple of hours, Otto and Otiluke appear; they are quite firey and blaming everyone and everything. Risky, casting Wish! Bad idea! Otiluke says, "This is classic lack of planning! Dealing with the chaos that is Mordenkainen! No regard for -" Oswen jumps in and *totally* reads him! "The Mordenkainen that was right? The Mordenkainen that you laughed at?" and so-on - "if you're going to have conversations like *that* kindly take it out of earshot!" - at first they seem to think she's joking but (intimidation 15) they get the message. As it happens, Mordenkainen and Jallarzi appear moments later. In fact, Jallarzi looks injured; it seems some magical chaos happened. She hasn't lost her magic but is not well. Kindle moves in to try and help with Healing but it's an issue with her Patron, not something that can be fixed. She needs to go back to Oerik on Oerth to sort that out. Her and Otiluke were stationed there; they must return; apparently a city there is still intact but under siege and they want to help.

Mordenkainen seems shell-shocked. For our part, we're glad to see him. "It's always difficult when you try to do something about it and you can't." Partly true - at least the warning allowed our group to rescue a few into the Fey. And Mordenkainen offers the idea that giving into Vecna maybe was wise, because undamaged / intact cities can be good places to stage resistances. Vi wants to know more about that - we tell her as much we can about the cities related to Selgaunt. She asks for a map; we have a few; she studies it for a while and asks questions now and again.

Some time later, Zorhanna and Alustriel turn up. Alustriel is in a bad way! It seems more an issue of lack of rest - being mentally drained. Zorhanna too. We talk. They used all their magical power trying to figure things out and haven't had a chance to rest. She can't even generate flame to warm themselves; they enjoy Kindle's fire!

Otiluke gets businesslike. "Did all of *you* make it out?" he asks of us - he doesn't even remember we were four! "Good, so no losses for us. Toril is another story. I don't know what we can make of that. But I can tell you this - Jallarzi and I need to go back to Greyhawke. If Vecna is on Toril then he's not on Greyhakwe."

Oswen isn't so sure; maybe *all* on Toril were Simulacrum. Otiluke thinks not; extensions of himself more likely; and Godlike or not, constrained to a single plane. And the best way to verify that? Go to Oerth. If there's any trace of Vecna there, then he really can somehow spread himself across planes; but if not, then we know of a limitation. Otiluke believes Greyhawke has not fallen and must not; he is its protector. Both him and Jallarzi have reasons to return. They *must*.

The meeting starts. Vi offers to go to Toril, based on studying Oswen's maps. She wants to start creating resistances. Oswen can't help but grin. Best news all day. Alustriel helps - she says that she did manage to contact a few of the people they had tried to rescue with Wish spells. Some of them got out under their "own power"... But her sister did not. She escaped Waterdeep, but is still on the world. Blackstaff Vajra managed to evacuate quite a few people in the last moments. Alustriel suggests Vi contact them. Vajra is apparently keen to know what the plan is to retake the world! Vi urges patience; that's a *big* ask. One step at a time.

Alustriel acknowledges Mordenkainen is right, though. This is *much* bigger than Oerth and Toril. Vecna is trying to take all material planes; the Lady Of Pain must agree since Sigil is now *fully* closed. "And most of my resources are there" says Alustriel. She looks very frustrated. Mordenkainen thinks he is in a similar position. But what Alustriel means is deeper; "I escaped with only this" - she gestures at her staff, robe and a spell book. "This spellbook is the only thing I have of my magic. Everything else I have is in Sigil, in the Sanctum! Also, she - didn't make it out. She was in the market somewhere... She didn't get out in time..." - and we learn that Alustriel's *partner* was trapped there. It's more than just her sister.

Oswen somewhat clumsily offers, for what it might be worth, our bank balance - at least that could get spell components maybe, at Trade Gate. She's drawn into an unexpected hug.

* Alustriel says that Oswen saw the Circle Of Eight fail
* They do try big things and don't always succeed
* Their previous encounter with Vecna was on Oerth itself
* In fact much of the starting point of the Circle; Mordenkainen is *also* from Oerth
* They tried but failed to contain Vecna there - not comprehensively, though; they did succeed in stopping him from taking everything over, but they had to choose between saving Greyhawke and its half-million (!) residents, or letting Vecna acquire something they thought *they* could contain and handle (and they did, for decades) - but Vecna did eventually get hold of another form of immortality, beyond just being a lich. That's how come he became godlike. He wrested the Domain Of Secrets.
* With hindsight alone, it becomes obvious that the "ball was just kicked down the road". Igwilv caused more chaos and havoc on Oerth than expected, it caused distractions, other planes always required attention...
* Vecna was devious. He did *nothing* for decades. He let himself be forgotten!
* Quietly, somehow, he was building up a base of power, somewhere else. Waiting to strike when everyone else was busy. Vecna is essentially immortal; time meals little to him, beyond boredom!
* Immortal beings cannot enter Sigil as that makes him a god as far as Sigil goes. He can never enter.

Vi pipes up. "Wait, why are we assuming that he wants or has found a way of getting into Sigil, then? Why don't we just assume that it was never on the cards? The moment he became *that* powerful, Sigil no longer matter."

But the Lady can restart creation itself. She could seed a whole new multiverse if the other is destroyed!

Yes, however, Vecna did *not* destroy Toril, did he - points out Orvil.

A game is brought up. Pieces shaped like people who hold ranks in Court. Is this a stalemate? Vecna does not destroy the material plane, so the Lady does not get to restart it. The Lady is infinitely old and will, they think, happily wait all of existence because time - and possibly, even its passing - is inconsequential and possibly not even perceived. Vecna therefore might not care at all. Whoever is locked in Sigil is stuck there - any very powerful beings - and indeed the Lady herself is the most powerful.

* Then Vecna would eventually surely be frustrated at *everything* being under his control *except Sigil*
* ANd that would surely boil over one day, so eventually, the Lady would win
* No use for us in the mean time, of course!
* Maybe then we shouldn't *totally* ignore Sigil. The Incantarium might yet have a part to play.

So, what next, in the short term? Oswen says that as far as we know, our next moves come from the Vault / Mordenkainen. And for once, the group listens to him. He is most interested in the Rod of Seven Parts. He has one part. But he thinks it needs teams. And Vi suggests - that each "cell" operates independently (a true resistance fighter!)

Oswen has been involved in two "cell" actions; the rod segment transfer and The Book. The intention is to destroy it to weaken Vecna. And there are two more artefacts that would have a similar effect; it might, if we were lucky, revert him to pre-God state. Or least "only" a demigod! We might then stand a chance. The Rod could perhaps then banish him somewhere.

* The Rod must be assembled
* Other group(s) to get the other artefacts
* Groups to establish a resistance communication network
* Groups to help evacuate people from worlds Vecna takes
* Groups to help worlds defend against Vecna; can't beat him, but can buy time (so **what world is next?**)
* What is his base of operations?

Split all these jobs up. "Each of us leads one cell" suggests Mordenkainen. Jallarzi and Otiluke must help at Greyhawke, so that leaves six tasks for six more. So.

* Vi: Establish comms, starting Toril.
* Mordenkainen / Golden Vault: Find and secure artefacts - and find a way to destroy them!
* Alustriel: Help with rod assembly
* Zorhanna: has good skills to try and find the base of operations
* Bigby: Evacuation. He is good at moving people between places and planes and he's small so gets overlooked!
* Otto: World defence. He's happy with that - *diplomacy*, convincing governments to act together

Surprisingly, people agree. Alustriel says that we need a secret place to meet and exchange notes. Under the radar. Well *we* have a keep - the Fey Wild, under his nose but simultaneously overlooked - and he doesn't know much about the four of us, but knows a lot about the Eight.

That works! But they'd need Planeshift focus tuning forks. Vi offers to make them! We can take her there.

Jallarzi and Otiluke wish to depart immediately for Oerth and can do so under their own magic power. The other 10 apparently all want to visit the Keep, so Bel reluctantly offers to get into the Portable Hole as the amulet can move Oswen plus 8 others.

Meeting adjourned; pleasantries; Jallarzi and Otiluke depart but, before going, Jallarzi says to Oswen - **"I don't know what it is, but something in me tells me that you have a very important role to play; and there's a connection between my patron, myself and you. I am certain that our paths will cross again. I don't know how or when, but I know they will. Take care and thank you for everything you have done - for rising to the occasion when so few others I know would have."**

Otiluke casts Plane Shift; the two of them disappear in a strange, rapid, twisting flurry of distortion.

We link hands; Oswen activates the amulet to bring us just outside the keep. Bardic Inspiration from Bel probably makes it risk-free but, anyway, Arcana is 29 unaided. Just like that, with a pop, we're outside the keep.



### Our Keep at the Fey Wild

There are some animals around and Leonidas, of all people, is tending to a garden! "Leonidas!" shouts Oswen and runs up, to hug him. But Inafina (WIS 22) remembers that Bel is in the portable hole! She pulls him out, somewhat flustered.

Zorhanna seems pleased by the space. People are being interesting; polite, waiting, like guests. So Oswen catches herself and introduces Leonidas and says, "There are more inside! No need to be formal."

Inafina notices a certain awkwardness amongst the group. Oswen introduced Leonidas as from Toril - so she whispers to Oswen and Oswen remembers. She goes back to him and he's telling her all about the garden. He's made terraces, planted all sorts of things. He found fruit trees! Let's go inside. She asks how long it's been - 5 days. Oswen has to break the news. An awkward conversation, given the unknowns; but we think everyone we know in Ordulin is alive - including Leonidas' parents.

Meanwhile Bel has opened the keep door and yelled, "FRODERICK! WE'RE HOME!"

After a while of inevitable confusion and so-on, people start to look around. Bigby and Mordenkainen ask about ownership of the Keep - that's Bel! - because they suggest modifications; a new wing, meeting rooms and so-on! It turns out they can do that magically, and physically. In very little time at all, they've moulded a wing of stone, Fabricate used for windows, Vi helping with hinges and so-on; even lighting. It's impressive.

Everyone needs to get to know each other, as the Six - and we do tell them that there are two more who ultimately can use the place - may visit at random times without warning (with apologies). Froderick frets about six extra rooms, but it's unlikely more than two would be here at a time. Froderick is reassured that the new visitors will look after their wing - it's not extra workload to which he never agreed, suddenly loaded upon him. And if there are more, Mordenkainen can cast a spell that creates an adjunct domain.

Over the course of the gathering, as food and drink arrives, Oswen has to break the news of Toril's fall. Similar questions to those from Leonidas, but now, more people to answer them. The unknowns are more or less the same, but it's helpful to have more voices. Archivist Walton is almost relieved, in a way, that we got people out in the nick of time. If we'd tried to move people first and the books later, the domain might have fallen. The library he now maintains is all the more important.

In a quieter moment, Vi hands Oswen one of her sending-stone-like things. She says it works once a day, a bit like the Sending spell, but works *across planes*. As with Sending a short response is possible. It will send all at once to Vi, Allustriel, Mordenkainen, Otto and Otiluke.

Alustriel and Zorhanna head off to overdue bed. Others from the Eight stay up; the rest of us just talk. Surprisingly, Otto and Bel strike up a rapport and start sharing songs. People break into smaller groups, as is inevitable with a gathering of that size.

Oswen and Leonidas end up alone, perhaps by design of the others. Another heart-to-heart. Oswen confesses to Leonidas amongst this that she'd almost rather have scried Cormyr. *That* would've been a fight. Maybe the capital there is even still a free city, like Greyhawke. But despite the Mithil, Silverymoon was attacked; it's hard to have confidence.

After much discussion, Oswen can at least say one thing. Vi is going to help with the resistance on Toril. If anyone in all the universes can make a difference - she can. Toril is in good hands. "Our home may have fallen to Vecna, but it's not quite lost yet."

Kindle has fallen into a routine with the Keep and helping in the kitchen. Oswen sees the squirrel on his shoulder! She'd totally forgotten! He's looked after it all this time. The loss of the cottage on Toril perhaps hit him harder than he admits, but having our keep as a bolt hole gives him hope.

Oswen takes some time with Froderick to thank him and gives him a big hug. He's been amazing. Then Bel says, "Ah! We have something for you!" - and reveals our crates of trinkets! We explain their meaning - even more powerful now that Vecna *has* attacked Toril. We are relieved to see Froderick very happy with the offering - he is sure they *will* be very useful when trading with other Fey domains.

Finally, after a long day of gathering and chatting, everyone sleeps. If nothing else, it has been an inspirational day (literally!).



## Fey Wild keep, Campaign day 22
### Morning

The next morning, the Six wake early and are up before the rest of us. They've been chatting - they're very grateful for this secret location. They think that magical communication between the group must be done sparingly; really, they should ideally meet physically. They have a theory on why Vecna might not be watching the Fey Wild (or Shadow Fell) - **the time effects**. Things are moving at a totally different rate relative to most other material planes. Time is usually slower here too, so days in these planes could be months lost elsewhere. That's a double-edged sword of course as we also lose time here, but it's a safer space than most.

Their plan is to meet quickly, only stay the night if absolutely necessary, then leave.

"You must be keen to get moving!" opines Oswen; "but is there much that we four could be doing?"

Mordenkainen says that there are two other important artefacts and the Golden Vault will be trying to track those down. In between finding any, though, we have nothing immediate to do. Alustriel asks if we would be interested in helping in any other way. Well, with Sigil shut - we have nothing much else to do! Alustriel says we could try and find someone who understands Vecna. Someone who knew Vecna in his youth. "That would be somebody very old..." says Oswen. But Alustriel happens to know "just such a mage" - and where she can find and release an earlier, trapped version of the mage. They were trapped in a mirror dimension. From "before here journey to the dark side..." - **this would be Igwilv**, when she was still known as Tasha.

"The young Tasha doesn't know she turns bad and cannot know! She'll find out eventually, but we need her help."

There's more. **Alustriel will take the lead with the Rod Of Seven Parts**. She'll be keeping most of that side of things secret. Meanwhile, she needs to find out more about the mirror dimension and will be in touch; and with that, she excuses herself.

Vi needs to get to Toril. Using our portal from here to the cottage is too risky - it would be bad to draw attention to it! Vi says a less-observed circle would be better. The best we can think of is The Inn Of Last Chances at Baldur's Gate, but it might be in ruins and a dangerous place to visit. There's the Bowery at Selgaunt too, but it's busy. Finally, Oswen digs out Rundar's sigil for the ruined tower outside the Misty Forest; she can form a circle with that now, after seeing the work done with it at the Bowery those many days ago and now being able to cast the spell herself. Vi takes copies of everything, but isn't sure if she'll use those though the ruined tower option is a very strong one; she'll head to another plane from the Fey Wild and do some checks first. "I can't give you assurances, but know that I will not stop! I will find a way. There are always stronger people; people who rise to the challenge. Sometimes the people you least expect because the concept of 'home' means something different to everyone. You never know who is going to be willing to fate to save it!" - it's said for the benefit of everyone.

With that, Vi heads off too.

Oswen says to Leonidas, "See what I mean about Toril being in good hands?"

Bigby and Otto are off next. **Otto leaves a song for Bel;** it's one that is keyed specifically to him. If we are in great need, play it; Otto will be able to hear it across planes. Bigby will go to his own sanctum and start arrangements for Toril evacuation via Vi. "If you can figure out which world he targets next, then Otto can head there immediately" he says to Zorhanna "and I will follow shortly after to evacuate key people."

Inafina notices that Mordenkainen seems particularly on edge. Flustered almost. She asks him outright what's up. He lists off things he was going to do, but he's got things in his tower in Sigil and so-on - mirroring many of Alustriel's frustrations. "If you can find any way to get information, that could also help... They could've moved by now... Two items... Those are the ones the Golden Vault is looking for. The Vault has the resources, but I can't contact them yet! The sending stone is in my tower... But maybe independently we could do the kind of ground work that our Vault operatives actually do..."

He asks the librarian if he has books. They start going to-and-fro about what kind of book would be best, but Oswen helped with boxing up and remembers putting one in particular way - Investigation, Nat 20 + 13 -> 33! She remembers the one, finds it in the recently-made keep library and fetches it. Inside, we are shown the two things we need to find.

* The Hand of Vecna
* The Eye of Vecna

These artefacts are *extremely* powerful and have led to the rise and fall of some of the most powerful - and gruesome! - cast members of this "cosmic tragedy" (as he puts it). These two objects are the results of a failed attempt to assassinate him by his 2IC, someone called **Kas** - Kas The Betrayer, now - almost as bad as Vecna, but they were childhood friends on Oerth. Apparently, Kas is now vampire (after being banished to a Shadow Fell shadow plane). He used to carry a sentient, evil shadow sword, that was originally found by Vecna, then enchanted and embodied with a malign intelligence before being gifted to Kas. However the sword, says legend, was *so* evil that it corrupted Kas even further and turned him against Vecna to gain power. It wanted to kill Vecna and absorb his powers.

Oswen asks if Mordenkainen knows if being near either of those two artefacts would affect us in the way that being near the evil book did? MK thinks probably not. There are stories about the artefacts appearing on worlds where rising powers - tyrants - are in possession of them, *but* they were already very power-hungry people before. **And to be used, one must replace one's own eye or hand with that artefact!**

"Legend also has it that the only way to truly destroy them is to slay the person who has both the eye and the hand of Vecna attached to them, *using* the sword of Kas to complete the sword's mission."

MK feels that to destroy Vecna the items should be destroyed, or at least somehow weakened, as there is a belief that Vena continues to draw power from those artefacts, regardless of distance or plane. There is much speculation on whether the artefacts tend to draw people to them when they sense an appropriate person with aligned desires is nearby, or perhaps Vecna himself guides it all. It's just not known.

If we're headed away from the Fey wild, he suggests we just *ask around!* - there must be stories. We figure maybe the Outlands would be an interesting place to start. Meanwhile, MK says he might start with the "seedier planes"!

Zorhanna also suggests we might help with something. "Did I hear you say you knew of a very powerful scrying device?" - we describe the giant's tower in more detail. "Could you bring me to it?" "Of course! Now?!" "Well, when you're ready!"

Well, then. Looks like we're Outlands-bound. The mood isn't quite the same as it was when we arrived. There's a more earnest feeling; we understand the fate that's in the balance. But there's also a lot more optimism. Leonidas gives Oswen a kiss and says, "Go save the world!"

Mordenkainen's on board too. Outlands it is! Six of us; with Bardic Inspiration, Oswen tries the amulet, focusing on the area on the lake shore near the tower. Arcana 23. No problem.

Pop!



### The Outlands, near the giants' scrying tower

The six of us appear by the lake shore. It's a bit further from the tower than Oswen hoped, across the lake really, but still, not bad. Mordenkainen takes his leave and meanwhile Zorhanna pulls out some kind of folding boat! It unfolds into a beautiful swan-neck boat, blue satin sails. It's all a sort of beautiful carved ash. Very elven. Wow. We get on board and the boat sets off across the lake.

Zorhanna calls upon a strange, magical faerie dragon; her Familiar. We're told this is **Minxy** - an old friend from the Fey. Orvil waves a wing!

"I haven't had a chance to properly catch up with you since we saw each other at Alustriel's and - everything happened..."

So we get into it. The sense of guilt, yet relief; worry for other worlds; trying to focus not on speculation, but on what we do next to help stop Vecna.

Clouds above are moving quickly, casting shadows on the lake and small waves form in the breeze. As we get closer, Zorhanna pulls from a small, silk cloth satchel, a sort of metal wand. She holds it aloft, balances it on her finger, then flicks it up into the air, speaks a command word and it extends into a 10ft pole. She uses it to steer the boat. Soon enough, we're at the far bank. Oswen watches closely as the process of magically folding the boat back up is followed. It becomes a small box. The rod is contracted. Both are put into the satchel.

"So who are we here to meet?" asks Zorhanna.

Oswen looks around. There's still a scaffold, but the top is certainly complete. She calls out, "Ahoy there! Anyone home?" - they don't hear up on the tower, but she can see one of the giants so uses Message. That gets their attention and one comes down, so she casts Tongues.

"You're back!" says the giant arrival. "We've noticed some very strange things happening!"

We are permitted access to the tower. Not calibrated yet, though; maybe we can help. A huge hand is lowered and we gingerly climb onto it. "Hold on tight!" says Oswen. The giant, some 25ft tall himself, ascends. It's quite dizzying just being on the hand, never mind a hand of a giant that's climbing a giant-scale tower!

The room at the top is quite small for giants, where the observatory sits. "So, how can we help with calibration?" - they gesture at the equipment to let Oswen examine it. Investigation 12+13->25. She's able to match human-scale and giant-scale implementations of concepts she at least partly understands. The tricky bit is that adjustment levers, knobs etc. are giant-size, so she has to tell them what to do. So, what are we observing? Well - perhaps for a test we could try Greyhawke on Oerth. See how that's doing.

Huge astral charts are produced. It's a strange idea, because this 2D representation is *not* of a 3D space; it's all just abstract. It's almost like a tube map - a kind of schematic of portal connections that can be used to "route" the signal. They aren't sure if the city can be seen exactly, but we can start by finding Oerth.

Zorhanna - INT check 17, trying to understand. Oswen tries to help with arcane understanding of the astral sea; only 18. Confusing! Inafina Perception likewise 18. We can only get a vague match. They have a guess at where they think we're looking and we rotate the device a certain way, to see if that then matches the expected change of view. It's a slow process but we gradually hone in. Calibration takes time!

We find it, though. A portal to Oerth. We need to "punch" through that; Oswen Arcana 25 can now figure things out since we've got bearings. There's a strange, arcane ward around the world. It is unfamiliar, but looks like it is trying to prevent travel - in *and* out, most likely. It's unclear if Vecna did that to stop people escaping or helping, or if the citizens did that to stop people falling into Vecna's grip if they approached.

It doesn't stop scrying, though. She can see the world. Looks kind of normal. She doesn't see a big city. She can't "rotate the world"; there is a fixed perspective. Just like a real telescope on land - you see what you see, and its movement is not under your control. Zorhanna opines that what she *really* wants this for - the view of Oerth being considered a success so far - to scan for Vecna's forces. Where is he hiding? The tower might help her narrow down worlds to check with a scrying spell, or even investigate in person.

Zorhanna asks if she can have permission to set up camp nearby and use the observatory periodically to work on her research. She asks if there's anything she can do for them in return, but the giants look puzzled - this person is very small! - but Oswen points out that we were able to help with that difficult moment in construction and Zorhanna is very magical. Perhaps she could help likewise, as the tower still has much work left to be done. With Bel's help, Oswen ADV persuasion with Bardic is 19+0+d8->2 -> 21. That's just enough, but - quite reasonably - the observatory can only be used when it's not "in the way" of construction or the giants needing to observe things themselves. The request for Zorhanna is not quite what we expected, but makes a lot of sense - the giants want to establish a working relationship with some of the surrounding area denizens as they've found social encounters hard and had some bad experiences! They want to kind of be "off the radar", if possible, or at least left to their own devices.

Zorhanna and the giants spend the rest of the day together working on the problem. At one point, she asks Oswen if she has plans of her own - well, we don't yet, but we should get onto investigations sooner or later. Perhaps we could do a "survey" of the surrounding area. Who are the 'problem' people, who may be unhappy; and who do not. This could be useful as we can use it as an excuse to start poking around for information about the Eye or Hand of Vecna.

Where to start, though? There's a gnomish city of **Wonderhome** - they know most about the giant activity as they helped create some of the mechanisms. They're "on side" but need to know that the giant tower must be 'kept quiet'. The halfling community of **Flowering Hills** isn't too far beyond that. And elsewhere, near the lake, is a community of monks (that are somewhat opposed to the tower) at a place called **Fallen Bell**. All of these sound solid options. Then the giants somewhat nervously offer another option - one that they feel might be harder, but is more important to them - a community *below* the surface. A network of realms connected by the **Caverns Of Thought**, connecting at sort of nexus called **Gzemnid's Realm**.

They are reluctant to talk about the problem with that realm. It turns out that they're worried about getting us involved in something that might be dangerous. There are things down there that *they* fear. When Oswen enquires about whether that's beasts or "things that get into your head" - it's the latter. Sounds like Illithids, or things of that ilk; they're made by **Ilsensine** - a God Brain! - worshipped by mind flayers, but the creatures down there are different. "Devourers of thought; eaters of knowledge"... Amorphous aberrations that look a bit like brains! They were created in primordial days, we're told, _before_ Illithids / Mind Flayers were "refined" out of the process. "They invade our dreams!" say the giants, who had encountered them while gathering materials for the tower.

"So you want them to - leave you alone?"

But the giants don't really know what these creatures want. They don't seem to be rational creatures; it could just be an undirected hunger. Having encountered them, though, there's some kind of a link, and they don't know how to break it. Are they being hunted? Is it paranoia? They don't know.

They are reluctant to talk as they *don't want to drag us into it* - it could establish a link to *us* too! Oswen with Bel's help plus Bardic, 26, persuasion; she argues we won't just dive down there and will try to find out more first but we'd like to help. They open up a bit. They first encountered these creatures where they went originally for the earliest blocks of stone - an old quarry near the banks of the river **Ma'at**, counter-clockwise from where we are now, towards the realms of neutrality. The river flows through neutral to evil planes. As they dug down, they made contact accidentally with an exit of a tunnel from a cavern these 'things' occupied. They investigated, hoping to find less weathered rock (and not suspecting any danger), they made contact with one of the creatures. The younger giant called the others in to help but that 'exposed' everyone else. It seems just getting in contact **at all** is enough and that's how all the giants ended up stuck with this issue. Only one organism seems connected; they feel a singular presence rather than a hive mind; and we know the location they encountered it; the creature might still be there.

We say we won't do anything rash and cannot promise any progress on the issue with this strange dream-haunting creature, but we'll work on it. We will start at Wonderhome, since that's "friendly" with an easy job to do there. Maybe the know more about the strange creatures.

There's no point waiting. It's about a day of slow-travel on-plane. Zorhanna bids us farewell, and we start walking! Orvil waves goodbye at the dragon Familiar; its skin flashes through various bright colours in response.

Survival ADV with Bel's help, dirty 20.



### 4pm

Random D20 requested -> 11. About three hours in, around 4pm, Bel worrying and fretting about not having had tea or even lunch yet, we crest a hill - and see a group of humans looking very lost, and somewhat distressed; we can see a few people a distance away from the group who might be scouts. There are around 10. We head that way, but try to seem as non-threatening as possible by going in order of height, smallest first. A person in a tree suddenly yells out and the people on the ground stop arguing (Kindle notices) then start to huddle. They're maybe looking for sticks or similar! They're about 300ft away.

As we get closer, we can hear them shouting in Common. Kindle, the loudest, shouts, "Friends! We mean no harm! We are here to see if you need help!" - persuasion nat 20! People stop, but are wary - at least they don't attack. They stop us when about 50ft away.

"What do you want?" asks an apparent leader. "We just want to help!" say Kindle. "Why?!" asks the leader. Oswen asks in response, "Did you recently evacuate Sigil?" "What is Sigil?! We just ran into the tower and ended up here!"

Oswen gasps. "You're from Waterdeep!"

Insight 19+1. They're terrified, dirtied, a little injured... Inafina notices they don't look like travellers. Oswen tries her best to get them to at least travel with us! They're too overwhelmed to really get explanations. They have nothing to eat. Kindle offers some - initially they think *he's* asking for food but we clarify! Oswen Persuasion 15+0 (no Bardic). The group huddles to try and discuss. Inafina tries to listen in but Perception is only 15. She gets at least the gist of it. Some completely distrust us. Others are pragmatic; "What choice do we have?" is easily overheard. Two appear to fully trust us. "One of them is a bugbear, the other is a devil!" claims one.

Inafina whispers some of this to Oswen. Eventually their apparent de facto leader agrees to come with us. "You must understand that we need to keep a somewhat safe distance. We don't know you. We don't know what you want or what you are."

And so, we walk. We share everything we can.

Later, one plucks up courage and introduces himself as **Briyen** to Oswen. They shake hands. Smalltalk, then more meaningful conversation. Some description of what happened with the scrying. The groups reveals that they were attacked in the Outlands by a group of goat-like creatures; they had some suspicion of Bel before realising he wasn't the same. They were just harassed and chased for a good half day! We explain a bit about how spireward, rimward etc. work; they say they were going clockwise. We are going further that way. They must've been more towards the neutral planes and, if chased by demons there, must've been quite unlucky. Oswen, religion 21; hmm, goat-like; she thinks that is more likely to be devils. So why would *they* give chase. Just for fun? Not so much chaotic; just malicious.

The sky colour starts to change, deepening. This causes more questions - they've noticed this morning-night cycle but without a sun or moon and the sky changes are uniform. As it's getting dark, Oswen notices in the distance - only about an hour and a half away (survival 19) - distant twinkling lights, suggesting a city. The group is unanimous, distrust or otherwise, that - despite exhaustion - they might as well carry on!

Oswen brings up the Driftglobe at the back (and they recognise it, which makes them more comfortable) and we hand out a couple of torches for their group. They're juggling pins but they do the job! Kindle brings up Dancing Lights for good measure. Discussions about the reason we have juggling pins, and a few demonstrations of skill from Inafina, help pass the time. A couple of them had even heard of the Witchlight Carnival.

We reach a road. Flower bushes light up on the side! Odd. We can put down our own lights and use the road lighting instead. As we walk, the bushes light up to follow us. Sometimes they pop up out of nowhere into view! Eventually, they change from bushes into slender trees with strings of light stretching between them, that turn on in sequence as we walk.

A large gate now blocks the way, lit up, with a series of glyphs above it, lighting up. It's *almost* Common but not quite; Oswen INT -> 16+5 -> "Wonderhome" is all it says! As we walk, the gate opens itself; it's all mechanical, apparently. Strange "sun ray" designs made out of painted metal spread out above, apparently just for show. A stone wall stretches around either side. Behind the gate is an arched bridge, going over what might be a moat, except it's irregular; could just be a natural river. Nobody seems to be around.

It feels kind of eerie. The place seems to "know" we are here but there are no people!

Once we get off the bridge, we're on a network of streets that all seem to lead upwards, zig-zagging and winding as if layers of the city were built up from the outer areas over time, eventually reaching a large dome at the "top" of the sort-of-central-hill with bright lights circulating around it. It "feels" like a temple of some kind from this distance. But then the dome rotates and we can see some kind of large lens attached to it - Oswen figures it's another observatory.

Occasionally parts of the city, as we walk, seem to *move* as if on wheels! It reconfigures itself. We approach a square with 3 roads. Oswen reminds people that this is a gnomish city so most of us are very large by their standards; please take care! Oswen calls out to ask if there is anyone around. Inafina is on the lookout; she notices that everyday things seem to *watch* them. Flowerpots and lampposts seem to turn to follow her, maybe? It's just a sense. She then catches sight of a *chair* moving.

Inafina calls out "I know we're quite large and may seem threatening but these people with us need help, they've been without food or shelter for a couple of days and we wondered if we might rest here a while?"

A barrel, a flower pot and a lamp post (!) move. They sort of reconfigure into a sort of Construct-like entity that moves towards us. The flower in the flower pot acts like an eye. The barrel speaks. "You are welcome in Wonderhome! Would you like assistance finding an Inn?" - to which Inafina responds, "Thank you! Yes please!" - "Please, follow me!" - and a few more Constructs appear. A bizarre procession now moves through town. The Waterdavians are a mixture of wonder and horror! Oswen says, "Don't worry, it's all just magic."

We reach a building with a street light that gets much brighter, "Wonder Inn" on a sign; so Oswen knocks and the door opens itself. She can hear a voice inside talking to someone - by context, it's the Constructs! - and we're invited inside. The humans fit but it's a squeeze for Kindle.

A gnome is at the front desk next to a fireplace. They wear a workman's apron and start fussing over people. The humans get distressed by the idea of what amounts to charity, but the gnome smooths things over by saying that all is required is saying "thanks to **Gond**" - you don't need to worship him; just be grateful for his assistance!

The beds might not fit them, but they'll have rooms. We elect to stay here rather than just leave them behind, at least for tonight. They're able to push a couple of beds together downstairs for Kindle. 

With the Waterdavians up in their rooms, we explain briefly a bit more to the inn keeper. They haven't heard of more but ask around via the Constructs.

That will take a while. It's late. We're tired. Do they have food?!

Yes! "Amazing and wondrous" we are promised, and despite the late hour, we're invited to a raised bar table in the bar room, which stretches across the front of the bar. "Food for everyone?" "Yes please!". We're in "album cover" order - by height, Oswen to Kindle. Kindle is closest to the bar keeper and is asked what kind of food he wants, but he doesn't know how to order! He's become too used to being the host himself. He asks the barman to start at the other end; Oswen hazards a guess at "fish".

The barman seems happy and walks to a wall where there are various runes. He touches a few then moves a kind of pipe over to Oswen's plate. It's almost as wide as the plate itself. He presses a button and there are various noises and presumed-arcane lights flash, until eventually a strange kind of disc is revealed on the plate - fishy-smelling, maybe 1.5" thick, about the size of the plate. It's kind of like a thick omelette, Oswen thinks, but she hasn't tasted it later. Bel opts for the same. Inafina goes for "mixed vegetables". She too gets a disk, but different-looking. Finally, it's back to Kindle. He seen how it works now, and goes for "chicken".

He's surprised we eat "simple" food. Oswen explains we're from a "low magic world" - so the bar man gives us a fifth plate to share, with a demonstration. "Slow-cooked lamb with sweet and earthy rubbed spices, rosemary, potatoes and fresh mint sauce".

We realise at this point that our "disks" are probably just the literal thing we asked for - just fish, chicken, or mixed vegetables. Inafina may have made the best choice by accident! It actually doesn't taste bad, but it's a bit odd. The texture isn't quite what we expect and - well, it's a disk! We end up sharing everything. They're not sure if they like the idea - the complex fifth dish tastes nice but it's *all* of those flavours together. Bel assembles its of disk, as if it were its own set of discrete foods. That works better.

At least drinks are more simple. There are lots of different bottles and he makes his best guess at matches!

Oswen is curious about how the "food magic" works. It's created from scratch, the barman explains; one of their inventions here. Part of the "magic of Gond".

Since we have a conversation going, we mention that we're here to try and keep the giant's tower "on the quiet". We are pointed at the Temple Of Gond, a strange set of gears and cogs assembled like a temple with a strange beauty; around this, the whole complex of buildings is referred to as The Workshop. That would be a place to go. When we offer to pay, there is confusion; ultimately it comes down to barter. It seems that we should TL;DR go to the **Storm Room** at the workshop and discuss any "ideas" we might have - we're not sure what for! - as they don't really seem to understand payment and are almost, it seems, doing this for our benefit to fulfil *our* custom.

Eventually, we head to bed and figure - no need for Watch tonight. Bliss!



### Outlands, Wonderhome, Campaign Day 23 (but there have been many timeshifts and discontinuities)

Oswen, overnight, WIS save: 6+5 -> only 11. The other sleep soundly, but her sleep is fitful. While trying to sleep she feels something familiar, within a dream. She's at the Ordulin library, under her favourite tree in the courtyard with a plate and a sandwich on it, an apple, a napkin and a book. She lays everything out as she always does, ready to enjoy the sandwich and apple, but just one bite into the sandwich the wind blows strongly - strange, sharp gust. She holds onto her hat. Leaves above rustle. She is *sure* she can hear someone calling her name on the wind! But it's not calling Oswen, it's calling something else; a strange sound; as if it were her name in another language. Yes, that's it! She *knows* it is her name, all the same.

Leaves fall down onto her, it must be autumn. But more and more leave, then twigs and branches, so she jumps up into the middle of the courtyard and turns to face the tree - which she sees has abruptly withered and died. Fast moving clouds seem to skate across the sky unnaturally. They become storm clouds. A huge flock of birds flies over, as if trying to escape something. Then her name, again; then a sense - "Run! Run!" - and a moment of *knowing* that voice, or that language. She's "felt" this before. HIS 5+5->10; the entity from the Far Realm maybe? But she thinks maybe she should know their name? So she runs! She runs into the lower kitchen/dining room where she always met up in the evening, to try and find Leonidas. DEX save - only 5 total! She's caught by surprise and stumbles, then falls, because there's a strange 'wave' she sees in the kitchen. It's as if all the walls, tables, chairs, even the chef/matron there, look as if they're turned into tiles, tumbling and flipping as if a cascading wave. Beyond that, through the gaps, she can see the library; also files, also flipping. As if rearranging. The 'wave' moves towards her. The floor flipping reveals a void so she turns and runs back outside.

Outside, others are screaming and running. The wall behind starts to 'flip' in tiles; now she's outside on the street. People are running in one particular direction. Ordulin itself, further up the street, is doing the same thing. Some people can't outpace it. ACRO 20+6! She sees others "falling" into the void, but she's doing a strange run with jumps and hops, as if she's able to see tiles as they start to form beneath her and jump off them, onto stable land.

After a short moment she notices that the wave is following a line, a fixed width path, and there are others. She jumps sideways. Now she's on solid land, but above her the sky is flipping too. The "entity" voice is saying, "This way! Don't stop!" - she runs again. Now she is at the town square. The presence asks her to run into the fountain, she thinks; the water trembles and shimmers as if in an earthquake. Part of the water reaches out in a loop and she's sure it is some kind of portal, or the entity reaching out. She senses, "**I can shield you**". Insight 18+1, there is desperation and fear in the voice, and for that, she trusts it. She heads towards the fountain; the water "reaches down" and envelopes her. She's in water but breathing? Not breathing? Oh, it's a dream - I don't need to breathe!

Tiles outside, look like glass or something similar. As they flip, they reform reality. But the reality that is re-formed isn't people fleeing, birds fleeing, storm clouds and so-on; people falling through cracks reappear once the tiles flip; it all just suddenly looks like normal people going about a day in the market. Blue sky. Sunny. Peaceful. **A perfect day** - but **it is wrong**.

The entity shielding her is being shredded by the change itself now. **"I can't protect you much longer. You must flee. Go! Go! But don't forget! This is only a glimpse of what is going to happen in all of reality! I cannot protect much longer"** - and then the water around her breaks apart, like shards of glass.

Oswen wakes up.

Bel is next to her, leaning forward. "Oswen! Oswen!" he's saying. She says, "Just one moment" - grabs a paper and pen and tries to write down as much as she can remember before it fades. Dreams are like that. Once she's done, she reviews the notes. Apparently she'd been moving a lot in her dream and that had woken the others. She explains the dream, but she was the only one.

But she was the only one who was "in contact" with that Far Realm entity, if it *was* that. So she tries Sending to Zorhanna - "Sorry to wake you. Did you have a dream about Vecna's takeover, with warnings from the Far Realm entity?"; there is a delay then a response, but it's sent as a new spell. "Not *last* night, I didn't. Did you? Are you alright?" "Yes, just last night. I wrote down what I could remember. I am OK."; now there's curiously a late reply to her original Message; **"That might have been the first one for you. Let's talk about it when you're back."** Oswen doesn't know how Zorhanna replied with a new Sending spell *in between* her own Sending reply/response!

So that's interesting - sounds like Zorhanna *has* had dreams like this and they aren't unique. She will probably have more.

She tries discussing what happened with the group, notes combined with memory. Arcana 15+13->28. Were there clues about the magic in there somewhere? **She wasn't seeing something that had already happened** - a revelation - this was instead a manifestation or extrapolation from the 'entity' that was trying to describe to her, communicate as best it could, a dream created by that entity. It was showing her something a way that it hoped she would understand (aliens appear humanoid so we're not scared, kinda trope). It was explaining what it believed was happening everywhere; the entity exists - as far as her readings and understanding tell her - as purely a mind. It's so different and alien, such an aberration, that any physical form it might *appear* to take is simply assumed to help it exist in the physical world. *Could it exist even out of time - that is, in multiple times at the same time?* - "running" would then be a strange concept, as you would exits both in times where there was something from which to run, but also older times where it was too late.

**The base warning is: Reality is being remade.**

None of the Eight had mentioned this. Strange. She decides to use the sending stone: "Have reason to believe, Vecna is rewriting reality. Aftermath looks like a perfect blue sky day but it 'feels' wrong. That's all I know."

Unsurprisingly, no immediate reply. She's not expecting one.

With that all out the way, we should try to get to the Workshop but need to check on our refugee friends first. They actually slept very well! We find them all downstairs, having breakfast - albeit with some confusion and bemusement due to "disk food". We say they can stay here, or perhaps try the Halfling commune, but have to 'wait it out'. It turns out some people were separated - e.g. a couple ran into the tower and only one came through, or a group got split. Things are a mess. Some want to look for others.]

In the end we can't come up with *much* of a plan, but the gnomes do have many messengers, scholars, tinkerers and more - that's why they have inns! - who are away from town and venture out. The word can can be sent out, to other places, to try and draw refugees here (or another location of your choosing).

We're offered "disk breakfast" - OK, so now we get the idea. Bacon and eggs! Inafina tries a celery, carrot and celeriac porridge. Bel goes for toasted, egg-dipped bread with bananas, cream and blueberries. That makes the innkeeper think a while! Kindle looks a bit lost; Oswen whispers, "What about something to do with pumpkins and chocolate, like back home?" "Pumpkin pie with chocolate sauce!" says Kindle. Inafina shares with the squirrel and a big pot of coffee is produced too.

With a somewhat emotional goodbye to the Toril refugees, we head out, towards the temple area and Workshop. We pass residential streets, balconies, terraced houses, verandahs, colourful gnome homes. Cosy. Kindle has to be terribly careful give his size. At least Oswen feels more at home here!

Eventually via colourful, decorative paving, we reach a very strange but cool gate - it is made as if an *animated* mosaic of stones; cubes that rotate to display different coloured faces and change the mosaic. Beyond is the Workshop - very clearly signed! - with a surprisingly large foyer area, but even here, it has a temple-esque feel. Oswen religion 19+5->24, recognises some of the iconography and symbolism. Gond, of course, a "god of invention", but unlike any temples she's seen prior, there's something new here - *no actual depictions of Gond themselves*. Tools and so-on yes, **but no depictions of the God themselves**.

We meet **Artur Quickenhammer**, in charge of the morning shift. We explain why we're hear and he heads off to confer with some people; in the mean time, we're assigned an eager, bright-eyed young gnome to give us a guided tour! We aren't just shown technology-vs-magic, that blurred line; we see art from Gond, too. "A creation doesn't have to be mundane or practical to belong in the realm of gold. Creation, innovation, creativity... Some of that can be expressed in music, dance, or the moving image!"

At this, Oswen asks about art that might depict Wonderhome. We're told there's a gift shop at the end and we can get something there!

We end up deeper into the complex, and within the Temple Of Gond itself. They can arrange an audience. It turns out Gond *lives here!* A physical manifestation? Well, that's quite different from Toril gods. Further on, there's the Chamber Of Echo - and then the Storm Room. At this, we explain about the inn keeper and payment; so what's the idea, with this? Our guide offers to show us. We're taken inside into a strange room with a domed roof that is covered with animated, swirling colours. Some people are sat at a small round table in the middle, wearing little helmets connected to their chair. Occasionally lightning arcs between them! "This is where some of the craziest, wildest, but some of the best ideas have been created. A *storm* of ideas! Sometimes dangerous ideas do come up, so we have to sort through them..." - and he goes on.

Well, Oswen has an idea.

She volunteers immediately. The workings are explained and she's "wired up". Her idea is simple. She thinks very hard about Vecna; recalls the dream as best she can; **then thinks about the tiles winding backwards - reality restored**. HIS 22, for her clarity of recall of the dream. Yes, the dream is abstract, but the notion is - put it back! Restore it! The strange machine reacts slowly; pushing her, prompting her. How would you? What part? What is reversible? What does that look like? She can't answer much of that, but the "how" - that's the Rod. The device she realises is sharpening her mind - she's not talking to *it*, she's talking over ideas *to herself*. She's realising the question of "reversing" is more complex. Someone refuses to bow to Vecna; they die; cities are ruined; then his influence rebuilds reality. The city is repaired. Perhaps the person is alive again. What do you restore? Bring back the ruin? Back int back to *before* his influence? Is it an alternate reality, or a matter of perception? Is there a "branch" you could reach where an alternate was created, or must one travel back in time to fix something somehow?

The group is watching. Inafina notices that there seem to be *audible* voices. She looks around. There are more and more gnomes, around a set of "screens"- frames that show information. They seem to have a mixture of emotions, mostly broadly related to being concerned.

Meanwhile, Oswen is thinking about the "how". Zybilnda's wish spell. That wasn't a "clean" reset; a branch of reality, to which one cleanly switched. There were people with vague memories about specific issues. It was *rewrite*. So from all she knows of the most powerful magic she's ever seen, *that* is the option. Is there a clue in how she felt about the perfect day of Vecna? *Why* did it feel wrong? She knows enough now to suspect that she wouldn't be the only one to "feel" it was wrong. Others might. Who? How do we find them? How can you articulate it so people feel affirmation and are drawn to you? **This could be critical for Vi!** The uncanny valley. She could try and "look" closer in memory (perception) at details; recall more clearly (history); or rely on knowledge. Her magical understanding. That's the one. Arcana - nat 20 + 13! 33.

Ah.  It's like the disk food. It's a very good simulation of flavours, but actual food is *imperfect*. The disk food is too consistent, it lacks depth. Vecna's reality is just too perfect. The day is too good. It's too clean. **Details of imperfection are missing - a flawless reality is unreal**.

So that's her idea. Some gadget, some device, that shows something *imperfect* to help trigger that awareness, that memory. The rest of reality is perfect, and there's things thing that's not and suddenly reminds you of what is wrong.

"Vecna wants to control everything", we were told. He wants to above everything and everyone else. In asserting that control, he's made a mistake.

Meanwhile, the people gathering around are increasingly concerned; the party is aware but trusts Oswen and don't interfere. Our guide almost looks like he might be in trouble now! He seems sheepish. A much older gnome comes over with two constructs and two more gnomes. They look very concerned. "I fear you are distressed? Is my companion doing something wrong?" asks Inafina. But no, they're concerned by the "results that we're seeing coming up..."

Something is *deeply* troubling them. As this is happening, Oswen is removing the helmet and is surprised to see that there's now quite a crowd. Inafina with Bel's help still persuasion only (4,10)+2->12, they just keep giving the "it's all fine" line.

So Oswen calls out, "So, what did my idea produce?" - quite loudly.

And *that*, sees Inafina, is what is worrying them. But they've been asked outright and these seem to be good people. They usher us over to a part of the room and point at these 'screens' of information that don't mean much to us. Oswen perseveres; Investigation 26; she can see the half-formed idea of the trinket at the *end*, but *in the middle* - oh, my. Quite a developed "schematic" and notes on the idea. Seems to point to somewhere else... A thick, double border around that one. None of the other ideas on screens she can see seem to have that. It's to do with changing reality - not the reversing part, but the Zybilna part - *replacing* reality. Inafina picks up that people are *very* worried we're looking at that panel!

Oswen thinks (perhaps wrongly, insight only 10!) that maybe they're worried about the idea of reality being replaced being a bad weapon. She tries to explain that. It seems to make things worse! Kindle, insight 15, since he's more into emotion. A growing concern, he detects, stemmed from some kind of realisation. Something dawning on them. They're piecing things together. It's linked to that diagram. There's an undertone of... Guilt.

On a punt, Kindle whispers to Bel - "perhaps they made something that inadvertently is helping Vecna change reality. And they recognise elements of that design in Oswen's idea, and now realise that it *was* used as a weapon"). Bel wants to just trick them into explaining! But he can see Oswen's thinking hard and it's probably not what she'd want; and these people are meant to be on "our side" - friends. So, he tries diplomacy. Persuasion 9+12 -> 21, which is just enough.

The double border around the idea means that "the machine" has found an existing record related to Oswen's idea. Her idea is not new. The notes around it are links - and the "supervisor gnome" gets even more nervous - to an actual project that they did complete. "I'm afraid I think I know what that project was! It was a long while ago now, a fair few years, but we had someone come who used the machine and came up with this same idea, and we created a psychic amplifier... We thought at the time it was fine, it doesn't do anything on its own, it would need to be part of a much larger device, and we didn't create much of it... Just some theories... The basis of a very complex machine, only powerable by *extreme* magic, God-like levels..." (he's almost rambling in worry) "...a thought experiment; we gave it to someone; they paid us handsomely for it too..."

They looked like some kind of creepy cult leader or something! A priest, maybe. We don't recognise that description in particular.

So what? They gave it to some person - and? "It's extremely rare for an idea this specific to have come up twice, but the context it came up with for *you* - well the machine doesn't really understand it, but you wanted the machine to find a way to *undo* what perhaps our invention did."

They show us the completed diagram. This is in a different room with much more space for these strange arcane 'screens', along with lots of scrolls and ladders that move up and down to access them on the very many shelves. The room is giant - 100s of feet across - with strange mechanisms in certain areas, like giant astrolabes. The show us the schematics. The machine was one of the few times that someone came up with a *really* good and interesting idea that was also actually *possible*. They tap into energies from "the edges of the multiverse"; ancient magic that can affect everything all at once. It changes *everything*, so that both past and future are changed. **Reality is replaced at all points in time.** In theory, nobody should ever be aware that things were ever different. Their machine is beyond a Wish spell. But that only works if *all connected realities can be subjected to it. Any reality that becomes connected to it was **not** subjected to the effects would cause the whole change to be undone*.

So that's why Oswen remembers a prior Toril. So far, there *are* other planes. **And that's why Vecna wants to control them all.**

But Sigil would remain. The Lady of Pain would never open the doors as long as he holds the outside planes. So how long can Vecna hold this new reality, given that there *is* just one last plane that still remembers the "old" reality?

Well, the realities changed by the gnomish device would unroll more or less straight away given that not *all* were changed. **Vecna hasn't used it yet** - if indeed he even has this device. He can use things akin to the Wish spell to change individual planes (but imperfectly, like Zyblina), then once - or if - he had them all, including Sigil, he could use such a device to change *all* planes for all time, and nobody would ever know it had been any different, so nobody would ever fight it. It's like fighting the sky being blue because you believe it should be green!

But gnomes correct her. If Sigil is indeed closed off, he doesn't need it. It's a *disconnected* plane. It can't ever reconnect.

So - Vecna has the potential power to change the reality in all worlds for all time, so long as he manages to capture individually all worlds, *and as long as Sigil remains closed*. ***He's actually relying on that.***

And the sheer amount of magical power required to power the device is ungodly! It would require almost all the magic infused in an entire plane. Oswen's theory, obviously then, is **that this what the Incantarium were doing**. But it would need hundreds of millions of magical items. He might just burn all magic in an entire plane instead!

The gnomes figured this was all so outlandish that these things could be created as thought experiments and proofs of concept because they could never be combined and used practically.

Was the Incantarium gathering power to *counter* him - does the Rod Of Many Parts require a power source itself? Was the Incantarium buying items at crazy prices as they were in a race against Vecna? If so, maybe they lost the race, because Sigil got closed early!

The plans in front of Oswen require a very, very high level of magical understanding, well beyond her. But it's important - show Mordenkainen maybe. She asks if it's possible to take a copy or something? They aren't sure - you can always take your *own* idea. But this isn't hers, it's just similar. They really should not have shown it! With Bel's help and some bardic inspiration, ADV Persuasion 15,16+0 + d8->8 -> 24. Decent. The gnomes argue that they were told it would be used for *good* - misery, suffering, conflict eliminated. Deep-seated feuds gone. Racism. All of it! Undone. People would just *forget* that stuff.

They are convinced by Oswen's plea, but she in turn is swayed by their arguments. Such a device has allure. She undertakes:

* To only use these for study - figure out what Vecna is trying to do and how to counter it
* Never build the device
* Ensure the plans are destroyed when Vecna is defeated

They remain *sure* that this device cannot ever be *powered* - but they saw Oswen have the idea, she had *seen* the effects (or at least had them described!) so somehow someone seems to be doing something like it, and that has them scared. But do they really believe it? No.

Additional insights:

* The power is channeled from another device
* There seems to maybe be a kind of ritual needed to get the power moving
* Beyond that she really can't tell more from what she's seen.

For the rest of the day, they'll be making the copies. While they're doing that, we need to talk to someone about keeping word of that Giant tower quiet! We're led (by gnomes who are now rather nervous at our presence - especially our original young guide) back to Artur. He's gathered who he needs by now and we're called into a small audience chamber of sorts, to make our request. We do our best and it's agreed, especially as we talk up how great the gnome invention has been, surpassing expectations, they must be proud etc; - they will file it under "C&C" - Confidential & Clandestine!

**If we see the Giants again, we should tell them the gnomes are delighted and, should they wish to, send praise to Gond.**

The gnomish word for Gond is, apparently, Nebulun. They ask if there's anything else we are after and rather cheekily, Inafina mentions that she heard that Gond resides here, physically in the city and while it is very hard of course to get an audience wondered if we might visit their residence, or at least see nearby?

They confer; then they offer to get the High Priest, to take us to the Grand Library and - well, "all will be revealed!" - OK, sounds fun!

After a while, an old gnome, bald, long white beard, large glasses with complex rims, approaches us, holding a staff with small four feet that he uses as a cane. He wears a beautiful long, steely grey robe with geometric blue and white patterns all over. It's quite long and drags on the ground behind him. He is **The First of Nebulun**. "It is an honour", say we!

Learning that we have not "met a God before", the First responds, "Gond will be most pleased! But never use any of their secret names in front of them." We only know Gond, and curiously the First recognises this as a name used in Feyrun on Toril (!) - there are many other names on many worlds. But these aren't the *true*, secret names. To them, the God is male and gnomish, but Gond apparently is a Dwarf.

Ah! Different cultures, even worlds; with different names and physical manifestations; but all the same entity.

We are led to the crazy-looking building at the top of the hill. This is the Grand Library. It's busy inside but the eye is distracted by an *immense* array of books - and various other devices that seem to be used *like* books - scrolls, bone oracles, hides, crystals that people stare into as if reading, contraptions covered in spheres with etchings that are rotated, oracular devices and more. Oswen enquires and, indeed in many instances these devices - foreign to us - are the primary ways of storing information other worlds. Others are historical. And some are very rare and, in some cases, ahead of their time! We are, by example, shown a crystal that holds "as many as ten thousand pages of information".

We are led up arcing stairs on the inside of the tall foyer into an area that looks like it would have been an observatory. "Welcome to Wonderhome!" he says - so this is a name *within* the _town_ of Wonderhome. Beautiful doors somehow withdraw, perhaps into the walls, and disappear. We walk in...

...and there is a minor discontinuity. This was a planar portal. And we stare upon an immense, almost infinite workshop. Everywhere - smithies and forges, workshop rooms, experiment rooms, all manner imaginable of creatures working away - but we are led swiftly, unable to take too much of this epic view in, to a large table. Here a gnome has been looking at a drawing, working away on something. Another has shown them an invention and they are talking about it. They look up to see the First and nod to each other and the First introduces us.

**This is Gond.**

Gond welcomes us to his domain. "What do you think?" "I can't say I've seen anything like it before - it's quite fantastical" (in the archaic sense, she means).

We talk. Gond believes ideas can in and of themselves be evil, but tools cannot. It just does what it was made to do; it is simple; but ideas are much more complex. A debate ensues; there might be doubt about a sword, but points are well made on both sides. What about a hammer, or a more abstract device; well certainly, those need *ideas* to do good or bad.

At one point, he pulls *raw magic* into a small mote. Oswen has never seen anything like it. He gives it to her; "what are you drawn to do by instinct when you see this?" Aracana 19; well it is very powerful, raw magic,  she could turn it into *anything*. A stable form of something she's only ever seen coalescing in other forms at the instant of casting a spell, fleeting. She suddenly laughs; "I would create a collection of fresh, long-lasting hazelnuts!" "You are surprising halfling. I cannot understand where you are going with this!"

She explains briefly about the squirrel. "But can you *do* it?" asks Gond. Would she try and convey the concept to the mote? Well, a sorcerer might. Instead, she takes a methodical approach. She tries carefully, step by step, to figure out how she might create hazelnuts - and suddenly, it's like a small waterfall of hazelnuts falling from the hand. There are suddenly rather a lot... "Umm. I'm not sure how to stop it!" "Send the _concept_ of the thought. Exert your will rather than crafting piece by piece." So Oswen tries that, rather like she did with the 'ideas' machine. And suddenly in her hand appears a tiny wicker basket with tiny handles, with one hazelnut inside.

She hands this to Kindle's squirrel. It can hold the basket easily. It takes the hazelnut out to eat - and immediately another appears! The squirrel looks surprised and takes that out. Another! And another! Realisation dawns. It gets quite excited.

Oswen is happy with the outcome! "I couldn't have done that normally with my own magic. Thank you."

With a flick of Gond's wrist, all of the other hazelnuts vanish.

"You have the potential in you. But I am more interested in the ideas, the methodical ideas that you have. Because that is what you did when you created the endless waterfall of hazelnuts. You *directly* shape things. And when you directly shape things, that is similar to invention. To what *my* children - my worshippers - do. Those who believe that invention is the key to everything. That you can invent - think and invent and create your way - out of anything. That it can solve all problems. Somehow. There must be *something* you can come up with. So what troubles *you*? And what invention will *you* make?"

It's actually rhetorical and the philosophy continues for a good hour. The other party members slowly pluck up more courage to join in too. A while later, a dwarf walks up - and as this happens, Gond turns into a dwarf. It's almost like overlapping though - she can tell that the dwarf sees a dwarf, while she sees a gnome.

It's time to go. Gond smiles. "Until we meet again. I would very much enjoy that." "us too!" "You may not believe this yet, but maybe you are more like my children than you know..." "I can certainly see the similarities". "Return any time. You are always welcome here. And if you want to be part of this family, we would welcome you with open arms."

Inafina has watched what's happening as this goes on. Kindle does talk to Gond but is kinda pushing himself because of the squirrel gift, but this isn't his God - is this cheating on his own God?! Bel has got into the ebb and flow of conversation, understands quickly when Gond is being jovial or serious or playful or probing; so he gets into the swing. Oswen just talks on a philosophical basis; she isn't really seeing it as divine. Inafina understands that this God doesn't act like one! But *she* understands the breadth of this entity's reach and power.

Bel later wonders what Gond's power actually *is*. Why would one worship him? Well, Kindle explains his need to help people and how Yondalla helps him do that. Without her power he would have the need and desire, but no ability. There are others who are inventors, then. Oswen does think back to Vi, who insisted she used technology and invention, not magic. Oswen, Religion, dirty 20, thinks about what Gond's powers must be. That mote - a Mote Of Potential, she suddenly thinks she has read of such things - she knew what she wanted to do with it, but couldn't. But then Gond gave her the idea of how to make that invention real. **He *inspires* with clues, hints and suggestions** which then make inventions possible.

The master crafter, the inventor, the maker. This is the God of Invention, however interpreted. Other Gods are "for" other things - at least that is the role they end up taking in material planes.

We are of course profusely thankful to the First and the others that have helped. Apparently though Gond did *ask to see us* - we made quite the impression in that "ideas machine"!

Outside, we see that it is evening time. It's been a long day. "Ah! Other plane" says Oswen. "Time must've been different - I think it's the same _day_ at least, or the priest would've said something". On the plus side - the blueprints are ready! We thankfully; there is no payment or barter exchange required in return.

The day is done. We head back to the inn. We're asked what we want for dinner - disc food... Kindle asks if they have a stove and some water! "An interesting request... Well, we can! Give me a moment..." - and somehow *makes* a stove! "But why did you want a stove?" Kindle answers "I'm going to make dinner!" Oswen explains how if she were alone, the food maker invention would be wondrous. But when in a group, some from "our culture" like to cook; it's part of the social event.

Kindle in fact wants to make food for *everyone*, so the inn keeper agrees to join in - even though it's "using our resources" - and he makes food for the refugees too. The food machine can help by making some base ingredients and Kindle ends up with a hearty soup, a meatloaf and a hazelnut and almond loaf as a more sweet item, along even with a sort of salad made from our own remaining stores, such as they are. The inn keeper then provides some excellent drinks - mead, amber stout and more. Bel plays music. It's relaxed.

Inafina, perception/insight both 21. People are dropping their guard at least. The Waterdavians, in particular, are noticing that conversations might be different - different references and so-on - but suddenly, this tavern is a familiar space. A feeling of relief and joy and connection, at least. We happen to be from the same world, unlike everyone else they've met! "I can't imagine what it must have been like... To have *been* there..." says Inafina. And now, they open up a bit. One by one, they start to talk about experiences. It's a bit traumatic all the same, but still, a strange form of therapy.

It was just a normal day. Two were dealing with bad debt! Others, just work. One, school. Then - everything changed. That existence feels like it *ended*. What is this, now? A new life? What is this?

And there was *nothing* they could do. Even the titans, the Blackstaff, the heroes at the city - nothing! People started yelling, "run for the tower" - some ran the other way, to try and get family... Oswen feels *that*. We couldn't get everyone. Leonidas' parents, for example.

The group actually self-heal. There was *nothing* to be done - some feel guilt for choosing the tower over another course of action, but if they'd done any differently, they would be stuck on Toril now - maybe dead.

Oswen feels that, too. She confesses that those words are wise for her, as well as anyone else. There were so many "what ifs" about the attack. Yet, we are where we are. Powerful people now group, combine forces, to one day try to defeat Vecna. And we hope for all our sakes that we succeed. But Inafina points out, it could be a day, a year, a hundred years. Hold the hope, if you so wish, to return to Waterdeep one day. But for now, do not be paralysed, waiting in hope; make the most of the life you have here for now. Build it, nurture it, and try to find happiness.

Eventually, all retire to bed.
