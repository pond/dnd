# Oswen: Part 2.17
## Campaign Day 40, equivalent of morning
### Shadowfell, Tovag, edge of the domain

We are on the road down from Tanner Court to the nearby town of Abergest, on an edge of the Shadowfell domain of Tovag. Mirianne and Brn are with us. Our eventual destination is the city of Tovagen, a few days travel away. In between here and there is a toll gate, and we're not sure how to get through that, or if we should risk a mountain path through caverns to avoid it.

Brn rides on Kindle's shoulders, pointing at things. Oswen is a bit listless - she comments that it's not like being injured in battle; she feels more drained, not hurt, just really tired. Bel tries to joke, "You *were* drained!" - he can see Kindle is very unhappy. He's distracting himself with Brn.

Oswen says, "I thought in part that it was a calculated risk. With your magic Bel, and Kindle's and mine, and with Inafina nearby - we all saw what she can do against these dark creatures in the fight in Glorm - but also I must admit, I was curious. I was taking an unnecessary risk probably."

Kindle answers, "You are your own person; you don't need my approval to do things" curtly.

"Yes, that's true, but I was obviously taking your friendship for granted. And knew you'd just back me up whatever. It's not the same as a battle when we've no choice or we've all agreed and we know we can rely on each other. I put you into a position where I forced you to do something you didn't want to do."

He goes quiet for a while. Then, "You know, it's OK; it kind of goes I guess two ways, because you're asking me to trust you, so I realised what you just said means that you implicitly trusted me. And trust looks different to different people. So me trusting you is trusting that you're making decisions that need to be made, and you're not doing it flippantly. Which you were not doing."

Oswen stops in front of him and turns to face him and says, "Not flippant, but it was rash and it was selfish and I pushed a bit past the boundary I think of where our friendship out to be pushed. I'll try to make sure it doesn't happen again - feel free to remind me of this time! - and I'm sorry."

"Sometimes we have to make decisions on the spur of the moment, I suppose, if you don't have the chance to talk to me about it beforehand. We have to do what we're doing now; talk about it after, once we've had a chance to think about it."

Oswen says, "I'll say this - Bel's spell timing was accidentally remarkable. I calculated it was close to finishing but gambled that it'd stay up. If it had I'd only have known the horror of it; I felt a brief moment of - well almost everything - guilt at what I was doing willingly, horror at that choice, and a great deal of fear - almost panic - but then spell ended. And then it was a weird euphoria, I did almost lose myself."

"You mean the time she was drinking from you, you weren't protected?"

"I was protected, but not as completely. It did fail early on. I knew it was close. That's on me. But it was incredibly luck! If I'd only known the horror, I would not have understood. And if I'd only known the weird euphoria, well, I don't know maybe I'd have figured it was OK. But the *contrast* - to realise the depths of what amounts to trickery in the act, especially if not consented - *that* is a revelation."

So Bel asks what happened, in detail. Oswen explains it as best she can, including some of the timings that Kindle didn't know. He thinks she has telepathy, because she did try to read our minds, but he thinks the act of drinking is needed for the emotional link. When she drinks she becomes an empath. **And some of her sadness at never knowing love is because she thinks her only option to experience it would be to drink from those that had, but in so doing she would certainly hurt them and maybe even kil them**.

"But" says Oswen, "therein, guilt. She expressed that. She feels it. She might lose that as she ages, and perhaps decides 'to hell with it' and exercises her power unbounded. But as it stands, honestly, I can't categorise her as what we'd call evil. Which in a way is even worse! What do you do with that? Where do we put those two, if we are able to keep our promise and get them out of here."

We keep walking. The moon moves; that provides a way to track time. There is no day, so that's our only clue. It's disorientating. "There was a mention from Eloitious about not being 'out at night'" says Inafina, "which is curious, so I guess there is some conceptual night time. And it sounds bad to be outdoors when it happens."

Bel suggests "night" is when the moon is not visible. It does seem to move fast enough that we can imagine it tracks the sky in something like half a day. "Do we trust Eloitious?"

"I think so. I do... Yes."

We approach Abergast. It has town walls, made of great wooden posts, perhaps tree trunks but each very straight and tall, buried deep in the earth and abutted against each other.

Outside there are manor-like estates. *Outside* the walls. Probably more vampires! Lesser lords, perhaps.

The road leads to a particular gate. There's an inside drawbridge! It's not over a chasm or even that big a river, but there's a stream on the *inside* of the wall. So you go under the wall and then you're over the drawbridge and through a second set of gates. Maybe the wall keeps people in?!

It's quite a big town. There are watchtowers along the walls. Everything made of wood, no stone. Not sure why. "Maybe something they have to defend against here, which is what the walls are for, is somehow fended off with wood but for some reason wouldn't be with stone?" says Inafina. "But that wouldn't make sense, wood is flammable! And that stream on the *inside* too - that's not natural, it has been dug" counters Bel.

We are stopped shortly after entering the outer wall by guards. We blag our way in; trading, heading to the city, we were visiting a "trading partner" at Tanner Hall.

Oswen sees that the guards watch closely as we walk over the drawbridge. Ah! (Arcana 17+13 -> 30). Some
vampires are unable to cross running water. She says, "Right, so they don't want vampires here, unless invited - but surely they could just turn into bats or something...?"

Well, we're spending the day here, so... We wander.

Circular, three concentric rings in design, six blocks on the outer ring, three only in the middle, then the middle circle which is really just a town "square". Cutting through is a road from the entrances/exits (one of each, depending on which direction you're headed). It's commercial along the road but beyond that is generally residential. The outermost ring is single storey, one or two double storey. We *do* see one or two stone buildings, but they're rare.

We've seen trees beyond. Forests, perhaps. How do they grow in the night? Oswen can't figure this plane out. It's very strange. Artificially created and with rules she has yet to fathom.

The inner 3-block ring is closer to the road and generally more mercantile. Warehouses, shops, trading guilds, eateries, all that. Oswen thinks it would be quite at home in Toril. It's remarkable, in part, because generally - wall and "moat" aside - it's unremarkable.

Then Kindle points at something. "I knew *something* felt weird! Very off. Have you noticed how there are no temples or churches or anything?"

Oh! Yes. "I suppose in an artificial prison domain, with the prisoner as the ruler - strange a concept as that is - well, sorry Kindle, no gods. None at all, perhaps."

"Or maybe they're just not allowed to be worshipped?"

"Well, we know your magic works. So *something* has a presence here, that must be true. Maybe that gives us an advantage."

"Yes but divine magic works everywhere!"

Oswen says, "Well, we haven't had to test that! But if you do draw on good will of Yondalla, then - well, either she lives inside you or she's here with all of us. Either way, a presence of sorts. Anyway. I need to sit down! We should find an inn -" and before she finishes the word, Bel is all excited. He saw somewhere as we wandered and leads us on the inner ring road, the 3-block one, to a small "cute" (in his words) red brick, 2-storey building. Inafina remarks, "Well it certainly stands out - not just stone, but brick, and two storeys as well. Let's try it!"

Bel suddenly gets into the weeds trying to figure out its construction and age. Oswen investigation, a rather silly roll - dirty 30! - well, they're proper bricks. That needs a good kiln. They were either fired here, but then you'd expect way more brick buildings, or they were brought here. Brick isn't as strong as stone blocks though. So it's a strangely extravagant construction technique for this domain. Vines climb outside - it's top-tier on the aesthetics!

Bel opens the door; "Hello?"

A voice answers, "Come in, come in!"

We enter a small foyer, with a hallway at the back leading to a staircase; doors come off on this floor too; there's a decorative brick archway and internal walls seem brick too, though plastered and painted in the main. We can see a tiny sitting room through an open door. There's a small desk, where a tall - Musteval? Too big. Rat person! Not humanoid with a rat head. Half way. Were-rat?! Fits right in with our group! Even so, Brn stares.

We ask about rooms. We doubt they can fit all six of us in one, maybe two? The receptionist checks keys on a board. "I can't fit you all into one room, even with the two little ones! But how about one family room and one twin good?" "Sounds good. Thank you." "How many nights? Just the one?" "Yes, afraid so. We're just passing through."

We're taken to the rooms. They're upstairs, carved wood, leading to a wooden floor upstairs that creak a little but not too much. We're shown the twin room; then across the hall is the family room. Four beds, two smaller. One is a huge double bed! "Kindle, I guess that's for you. And Marianne and Brn - will you fit? Do you mind?" - she'll share with Kindle. "I guess I have to be in the other small bed, so that leaves Bel and Inafina in the twin."

Kindle clears his throat and suggests that maybe Mirianne would be more comfortable sharing with Inafina, instead of his large self! So we swap that.

The twin room uses a shared bathroom; the family room has its own small bathroom. "The family room is 1 gold a night. The twin is 5sp."

Oswen pays.

Mirianne politely enquires if they *get* many families here?! Apparently yes, a few; and parties like ourselves, all sorts really.

The inn here is too small to offer food. Actually it's a hotel. There are plenty of good places around, we're told; "and of course, we are a free town!" He smiles. "There is no curfew." "Because of the walls?" "Yes! We do not fear the night in Abergast. Some would even say it's livelier once the moon goes down!"

If we're traders, then the Trading Market is a good destination. Else "**Katcha's Curious**"!

So we thank him and head back out. Mirianne is exhausted and elects to stay behind... She didn't sleep well last night, what with - you know - screaming and things. And she has a lot on her mind. We leave her with the food package we were given. Brn comes - he's sticking to Kindle like glue.

We need to talk so we find a cafe for lunch. Bel has scoped it all out! It's quite bizarre being in places this good in the Shadowfell. Tanner Court was what Oswen expected. This is not. There's got to be a catch...

After a while we figure the first option might be to try and copy a trading emblem. Oswen knows about a couple of spells; Fabricate or Create Object, but she doesn't have those. Investigation 27. Oswen asks about magic shops - what a long shot! - at the cafe, but no, none in town; however, **Lady Eloren** has a trade delegation in town (she can't enter - must be a vampire). We might be able to trade with them. Strike up a bargain. She's well known as quite an accomplished spellcaster.

That's worth a shot. The mountain caves feel like excitement of the wrong kind! A last resort, probably, so let's see what we can do first. We head to Trader's Market, going off the "can't miss them" description we were given. "Loud and haughty" we were told - Inafina's big ears - passive hearing perception 17+3 in that case - "I know where to go!" she announces.

This place is more of a trading floor. Display and examine goods. It's not a sell-only market (of course, given what it's here for).

Three people are boasting. "You will see nothing like this anywhere else! So no, I will *not* be accepting your counter-offer and I wish you luck finding *anything* even remotely similar in quality to what we have!" - that kind of vibe. We stand back and watch for a while to get the measure of them. But these traders aren't moving. "I think you over-value *yourself*!" - they announce. On the table is a stack of very beautiful silk garments. Bel is very interested. "They *do* look very good..." - perhaps it is the attitude, more than the product, that is the problem.

The three sellers appear to be Tieflings. One spots Bel and elbows another. They turn their attention our way. "Sir! You look like Satyr of impeccable taste." ("satyr" - smooth). "Do *I* have something *special* for you!" - and they actually ask their unconvinced would-be-buyers to move on.

We've already talked about it. The aim is for Bel to like the goods, but they're not magical. He's going to be sceptical about magical properties - surely they don't have much magic to sell? Lady Eloren can't possibly have magic that *creates* things. Nobody has *that*! That kind of thing.

Bel ADV persuasion: Nat 20!

At one point, the most Bel thing ever. A beautiful long-sleeved ruffled shirt. Bel loves it. Oswen whispers, "Well, whatever else we might be here for, we *do* have funds" - but it's not subtle enough; one of the Tieflings is there to listen very carefully; "We know you do! More than some of the other people around here. And you have taste, which is more important!"

They introduce themselves as **Dammon**.

The conversation goes back and forth. Bel steers it expertly to magical properties. "This is fantastically made", he says, "clearly the raw materials for this are rare! And very skilled artisans" - he uses his own spin. It's not so much Oswen's idea of scepticism, and far more based in flattery. He's very, very good at what he does. "You know I *am* interested in these, but you know that I'll pay a lot more for something bespoke. We all know that you work for Lady Eloren; what I'm interested in is an *audience* with the Lady, to commission special items. For we know of her skill. It is legendary."

"Very well. But before we do..." - the Tiefling pulls out a case - "...perhaps you might be interested in some of *these*?"

Beautiful silk gloves with a faint enchantment. A silk and feathers masquerade mask with another faint aura.

"Closer, yes. But again, I'm thinking of something tailored. Bespoke. Not just for me - just as you represent the great Lady, I too represent a great Lady" - and gestures to Oswen. He says, "Looks can be deceiving! The smallest in stature of us all, but the greatest in ability. A similar field of interest as your own patron."

"An uncommon request. But it is within my power. Of course, it cannot be within the walls of Abergast."

"We know."

Something is whispered between the two in a language we don't know. Oswen makes a mental note to cast Comprehend Languages before the real meeting starts! One of the Tieflings heads away.

"Is there really nothing I have that *might* interest you at all?" says the salesman; Oswen casts a glance, not taking it too seriously (Arcana only 2+13 -> 15) - a pair of gloves that can cast a cantrip, if used in direct contact with skin - a version of Friends. The mask? Arcana 15 again! Stronger magic; she can't quite figure it out. An aura of enchantment but illusory. It feels like it'd be Disguise Self or something along those lines; she asks, "how much?"

He notices she's avoided using any magic on it. She says, "I can often get what I need by examination."

"And what have you learned?"

She points at the gloves and simply says, "Friends. Not my style. This mask? Less sure. I'm not at my best, but I'd guess at Disguise Self." "No! Very close..." - he leans in and whispers - "...a spell that is very useful for *some* of our clients; *perhaps* for you; a version of a spell mastered by Eloren, called False Life." Arcana - 15 a third time, she really *is* tired! - basically, temp HP. "Her version also imparts the illusion of the breath of life. If undead, one would appear to live." Oswen's not sure if we'd need that but it takes all sorts. Who knows. "Again, how much?" "This will set you back exactly 50 pieces of *platinum*." Oswen chuckles. "At *that* spell level? Really?!" and Bel laughs too. "Yes. It *is* an entirely different version of the spell. Nobody has mastered *this* version other than Lady Eloren."

So we suggest that the mask be considered in conjunction with whatever else we bargain for when we meet the Lady - if they don't sell in the mean time. It is agreed.

But before we're done - Bel can't stop looking at some silk pajamahs! Far better than what he has. Apparently, 40gp. Oswen says, "Good as they are, we know you're quoting high! But, how about as a show of good faith, we shake at that price without further bartering." "I wouldn't expect bartering over our standard pieces in any case. Special items are another issue! But I think you'll find this well worth the price -" (looks at Bel) "- we will, after all, tailor the fit for you, sir."

All this takes a while and Brn is inevitably very bored! He doesn't react much to "50 platinum", but at "40 gold" he goes wide-eyed - that's more money than in the world, how can some silly clothes be worth that?! - and somehow gets even *more* wide-eyed when Oswen hands it over.

When it comes to alterations, Dammon uses a very strange stylised needle that actually looks more like a strange wand - and indeed, he waves it slowly in a pattern before touching it to the clothes, saying something as he does; Oswen Arcana 23; yep, it's a wand! There was a command word used which released a charge. It moved the fabric around, adjusted the garment; tailored it. And then Oswen realises it was more - far more. **That was Fabricate**. It didn't adjust garment, it replaced it; it used the garment as raw materials for another garment.

So. The Lady knows Fabricate.

"We do more than just silk!" says Dammon, drawing out a large case which opened contains a large number of vials set into indentations, the whole thing lined with black velvet. But it's not potions; it's perfumes! Brn wrinkles up his nose. "What's *that?!*" - not a fan. But Bel of course is enchanted.

The second Tiefling tells us that if we want, the rest of us can look around! We'll be found if Bel is finished up, so long as we're in the market. We leave Bel to it, for Brn's sake more than anything else.

We wander around, a bit of heart-to-heart with Brn as we go. Inafina, ADV perception for hearing, 25; she overhears traders trying to negotiate for guards. "We could split the cost of the guards on the way back!" one argues. Another says, "But we have our own! We need them. We can't let you have them!"

Hurriedly Inafina gets Oswen's attention and lets her know. So we wander over. Inafina clears her throat. "Perhaps we can help?"

Mid-conversation; all to look, incredulous.

Inafina in a flash grabs the "needs a guard" guy and has him almost pinned to the ground. But not to harm! "We're very fast!"

Kindle swings his mace. "And we're very strong".

Oswen produces an illusory flame. "And we're very cunning."

Brn says "...and we're very good with our hands!" - grabs eggs from a nearby carton and starts juggling!

The three of us regroup and Oswen says, "You couldn't find better guards for your journey! And we'll work for food alone."

Brn puts the eggs back. Doesn't drop a single one.

Inafina leans in. "...well truth is we need to get through the gate and we don't have one of those token things... It's services in exchange for - um - that!" - insight 23. He's obviously not convinced at all. But at the same time, he's on the edge of desperation - but not quite there yet.

Well, if he *can't* find guards, we'll do it for free. Well, for food. Although that seems to make him even more suspicious! And our honesty on going through the gate doesn't help. Well, we give him the name of our inn anyway.

At that very moment the Tiefling "2nd" comes over and says - "Whenever you're ready" - so, we say, "You know where to find us!" and head off, all faux cheerful. We catch up with Bel, still chatting and looking at even more stuff. Jewellery this time. Apparently he still hasn't bought anything yet. The female Tiefling says, "Well, the Lady will see you... Please follow Dammon."

Oh! Right now. Oswen whispers to Brn, "Sorry I know it's boring but - please - best behaviour!" - Kindle scoops Brn up so he can get a good view from atop Kindle's shoulders. We head out of the *other* gate this time. Bel walks alongside Dammon with the rest of us trailing behind. We try not to talk too much for fear of giving away our plans. The other gate is very similar; the interior stream, drawbridge and guards. They nod to us all as we exit.

There's a quite fancy looking marquee outside, in a tended-to-looking area of grass and trees. We ask what it's about; oh, that's our destination! Oswen had expected a manor house or something, a home-away-from-home perhaps. The marquee is quite beautiful, though, no doubt. Dammon, on arrival, announces us to Lady Eloren - from the outside - requesting, "May we enter?" "Yes, yes, by all means". A sort of shimmer visually runs over the tent as some kind of ward or lock spell is dropped. Dammon reaches in behind a tent flap and turns his wrist, as if unlocking something, then pushes open a solid door hidden underneath. We are beckoned in first; we push under the flap and walk through this open, solid wooden door just behind into what seems to be a villa of sorts. More space inside than out. Not quite the same as Mordenkainen's mansion; more of a warded *space*, expanded a little magically. There was no "feeling" of going into another plane/demiplane.

Dammon follows and closes the door behind us. Suddenly the "feel" changes; the air smells strangely sweet and there's the sound of light chamber music in the background. "Please, come with me" says Dammon and leads us into a section to the left of the foyer, where we enter some kind of sitting room / drawing room area. A large oak desk is tucked under an archway of bookshelves. Sat there is a ~50 year-old *looking* lady, though Oswen assumes that she is a vampire, dressed in "classic gothic" getup! A high-necked gown with brocade collar and short sleeves, long silk gloves which come up the arms to meet the gown sleeves. Dammon announces us and we wait to be spoken to!

"Come in!" she says. We walk in further. "Have a seat!" - she gestures vaguely into the room, but as she does so, chairs slide across the room towards us. "So! I hear there are some special services that you are after. But my assistant" (must mean the other tiefling, not Dammon) "tells me it is a cover for something else, that you want. Please... Just - speak frankly. What *is* it that you want. What are you looking to procure."

Bel is surprised; he didn't think he'd been seen through! Neither did the rest of us.

Oswen says we need to copy a trader's token to get through the gates. She deliberately also mentions that "we have business in the city" and that she believes "Kas is no longer in this domain and may perhaps intend to never return", all to see the reaction.

"I suspected as much... The tyrant is very good at hiding his present, but never for *this* long. Very curious."

"Well, those who are confident of his departure would recognise the likely power imbalance arising and it would be to their advantage to act sooner rather than later."

"I am aware of the nature of our predicament" - catches herself - "sorry, I mean, I know we are in a prison plane. It is only a matter of time before it starts to crumble and collapse around us. Now I have no experience, nor do I pretend to know, what will happen to those of us who are in it when that happens. I will strike a bargain with you. I will provide you with the means to achieve what you wish; in return, I would like passage - safe passage - out of this potentially collapsing domain."

Dammon looks alarmed. He clearly had no idea.

Oswen looks to Kindle, but instead notices Inafina; Inafina notices Dammon's shock, that Lady Eloren is only negotiating passage for herself and is being honest about that; she sees an opportunity for trade, legitimately, but it's very self-serving. She seems curiously trusting too. But Lady Eloren wouldn't do that for our word alone, she thinks, as she has no way of knowing how easily we might just leave and abandon her.

"I understand you might need time to think about it, to talk amongst yourselves; let me make it clear what I am offering."

She pulls out a spell book, flips to a page and shows it to Oswen. "I believe this is what you are looking for?" - Oswen Arcana 28; Fabricate; Oswen says, simply, "Yes." "Well you may copy that spell if you wish. But we must have an agreement if you do so. I will even provide you with the means to get through, directly into the Capital - you can travel with *me*." "But that is still only *your* half of this bargain; what comes from us?"

Eloren pulls at scroll. Oswen gets that bad feeling - another contract spell! Eloren also produces a special looking quill. She touches it to the scroll and writing, apparently in blood, appears. She signs the resulting document and shows it to Oswen. "For your consideration, please; take your time - read it. When you are ready, come back and sign it". The scroll rolls itself up, with the quill inside, and she gives it to Oswen. "You are welcome to use the music room - I assure you it will be private. You can discuss amongst yourselves there."

Oswen nods and starts to head in the indicated direction but Eloren interrupts; "If you have plans of  returning to Abergast, be aware that the moon will set in three hours time, so you will want to make it in before they shut the gates." Oswen says, "Thank you for the reminder" then looks over to Dammon and indicates with her head that he should come with us - but Eloren barks out, "Dammon! You stay!"

There are several musical instruments here and a few couches. There's just enough room for Kindle to set up the Hut, touching the room walls. We dip inside.

Oswen has been carefully reading the scroll. Bel helps; he is meticulous. ADV investigation - really looking for gotchas and details in general. 26. Well, the quill draws on the blood of the holder, so that's the binding. The wording is quite watertight.

* If signed, they would be linked by the contract; Eloren would always know where we were *in this domain* until the contract were completed.
* If she were to break the contract, there is a blood curse penalty; she would be linked with Eloren by *blood* rather than via the contract. Arcana on that, only 16; she doesn't know much about blood links but guesses that the owner (Eloren) would have some kind of compulsion or control over the recipient.
* There's nothing in there preventing a future return to Abergast. It also doesn't stipulate that she must be the one to take us to the city. The fundamentals are, *when we leave we must take her with us*.
* She provides the means for us to gain access to the palace; i.e. she'd help with the invitation we already have.
* Once we leave the realm, by any means, the contract is completed. The bond is therefore dispelled.

Oswen isn't happy at the three traders being screwed over. And too many people are starting to know we might have an exit; we could be pursued for that or there might even be a panic about the domain collapsing. We don't know much about Eloren either - evil? Not? Would she attack us the minute we left, given that we'd perhaps attack her? The only thing Oswen can tell is that she's powerful. She's very powerful, more than Tanner.

Kindle is more worried about her than about Ranna. Oswen says, "The only reason I ever agreed to taking Ranna out was after that connection and even now I know it's very risky to do so. I don't know that about Eloren and I know she's more powerful, so I tend to agree, I'm not sure that we can agree to this, even though it gives us everything we need."

Kindle asks what Inafina thinks. And - she thinks we're fighting, one way or another. Of Eloren comes with us, she might attack on exit. She might prohibit bringing those from the Keep along, because we may only be able to take a limited number of people and/or she simply doesn't want to go back to Abergast and the domain edges, especially if it is collapsing (not that we know how that 'looks' / what it means in practical terms). But she gamed us. She said that once we found a way out, we'd take her along - and gave us a contract - and we didn't act surprised or similar; we just took that contract, *which confirmed her wild guess that we had such plans* - we gave ourselves away! If we refuse the contract, she'll surely follow/hunt us, wanting to use our exit once we find it. And with enough time to prepare, she might have more people with her, or be in some way stronger / have assessed our weaknesses more.

If we're going to fight, it has to be now. But she could just escape. Oswen decides to try and Identify the nature of the magic herein; what happens if it collapsed? Can it be used to attack us? What exactly is it? She heads outside and does her ritual (we have a few hours after all!)

It's a sort of weaker version of Magnificent Mansion; not as big, no servants. It needs a certain size space, but expands it. The door is the only correlation between inside and outside. The only way outside is the door. Or *maybe* Planeshift, but most likely, not Teleport - the spell protects against that. So the vampire could - control our minds; go invisible; do something like Darkness; or at least do a short range teleport-like hop, like Misty Step. But otherwise, trapped inside (like us!)

So we get into a battle conversation. We can't agree to her terms. If our way out is like Planeshift, then with the six of us, Mirianne's mother if found, Eloitious and Ranna, we're at the limit anyway. We won't tell her that but we'll express our concerns and say we now have a worry that she'll pursue and attack us.

* Bel is going to swap the Hat of Disguise for the Helm of Telepathy. He wants to know what Eloren is thinking. But it's easy to resist its effects and Oswen has it as spell, so he agrees to rely on that instead.
* Oswen casts L5 Intellect Fortress for herself, Brn and Inafina then gets that back with Arcane Recovery. Kindle and Bel will have to rely on innate resistances.
* Oswen's not got many spells useful against this kind of creature, we know that; but a Wall Of Force around the door outside would help defend against escape.
* Oswen asks Kindle to give Inafina advantage in the initial attack (if we need one) as she might be able to stun Eloren very early on.

So in the end, it's been around an hour, so at least there's a short rest - but no more delays; no attunements or spell swaps. We apologetically warn Brn - for whatever that's worth - of impending great danger. He, as usual, acts very brave about it all and, quite possibly, really means every word. Perhaps in part it's the courage born from his childish inexperience, but given he witnessed his own parents killed by shadow demons, perhaps not! Then we head out of the hut, then back towards the drawing room to speak to Eloren.

Dammon is sat in a chair, waiting. Lady Eloren looks up to the group; Inafina insight 21; a momentary flicker of an emotion - a few, actually - impatience; then disappointment; then thought... Inafina gives Oswen "the look".

"Ah... We you having difficulties with the quill? I notice you haven't signed it!"

"No deal. There's no way we can guarantee we can bring the numbers through."

"I'm disappointed."

She flicks her hand; the contact and quill float through the air back towards her. "You're sure that you don't want to take me up on my offer?"

"Oh, part of me *wants* to - an easy passage to the city - but we simply can't; and now of course we have an impasse - because you know our plans" and to Dammon "and you know this domain is collapsing and you don't have an exit strategy. So I think that puts *us* at risk!"

Eloren starts to cast - Oswen Arcana 19+13 -> 32! - Detect Magic. Her eyes go Oswen, then Inafina, then Brn. Oswan simply says, "Yes, that's right."

Eloren shakes her head. "You've come in here spoiling for a fight!"

"Expecting one, but hoping to be proven wrong somehow."

"Why would I fight you? That makes *no* sense" says Eloren, rather confusingly. Kindle, perception 25; he steps forward, as if trying to block Oswen, because Eloren is doing something. He draws attention to the fact that Eloren is look specifically at Oswen in a strange way... Inafina does't notice (perception 14) but Oswen (perception nat 20 + 1) does notice too. Not just at her, but at her pocket on her robe, where the pouch is; that's *very* odd and Oswen counters by fast-casting Detect Magic to try and see what she sees.

The locket! She was *sure* it had no magical signature - but now it does! Very strong and very distinct; a *particularly* alien one, at that. It is an item bound or linked to two planes; a kind of wormhole effect; ah, so **_this_ is what pulled us through then the fog closed in**. It wasn't the fog itself. And **Eloren's focus on the item suggests that Eloren thinks it can work the other way too.**

Eloren realises she's been caught; looks away quickly; "as I said I'm very disappointed but you are free to do as you please. Unlike you, *I'm* not spoiling for a fight. Well... If there is no business to be conducted here then Dammon will see you on your way."

Inafina is sure that this being concluded as quickly as possible. She's not attacking, she's read the room and is deliberately not going to engage us.

Oswen shakes her head. "We haven't resolved the issue of you attempting to follow or otherwise use whatever our method of exit might be."

"That's your problem, not mine. Some things simply remain beyond your control."

"It's *our* problem, as you well know! And we will need to come up with a solution. I don't intend to spend however many days, months or even years I have in this place watching my back. So we're going to have to come up with a solution here."

She uses Alustriel's staff to cast Wall Of Force in a 10ft globe around the door, which she knows is well within the spell range.

Eloren smiles annoyingly. "Oh, I expected more of you! You'd be foolish enough to attack me in my own lair? HA!" - and that's it. Initiative.

* Inafina ADV 16,16 + 9 -> 25
* Kindle 20 + 5 -> 25
* Bel 13
* Oswen 4+2 -> 6

Inafina sees Eloren about to act and is just a fraction of a second faster. She leaps over and swipes but misses wildly with the staff; then hits again, 12 bludgeoning and 2 charges, 8 lightning; both impact; she tries (focus point) Stunning Strike but frustratingly, Eloren resists the effect. So much for that plan! So (focus point) she gets advantage on her next kick; 13 damage; second attack hits; 14 more damage; she keeps right in front of Eloren, in her face.

Eloren looks at Infina and speaks in some strange, powerful voice, casting Command in essence. "Drop!" she says. ADV WIS save, 21. Inafina says back, "Keep!" and tightens her grip. Eloren starts getting angry.

Kindle moves to get line of sight around Inafina and casts L6 Sunbeam. An incredibly bright beam of sunlight, a few *feet* in diameter, blasts forth from his Holy Symbol. But Eloren makes her save yet again. 27->13 damage. The light *sears* the creature, and Eloren responds immediately ("Deathless Strike") to try and get away from the sunbeam. This gives Inafina a chance to react, who hits with the staff with 2 charges for 22 damage *and* Stunning Strike sort of works this time, but Eloren somehow *shrugs it off* and backs into the corner of the room, try to keep away from sunlight that now radiates out from Kindle (even though the initial beam has faded).

She starts to burn in the light, since she really can't escape it in the room. 20 radiant damage. Looking messed up. At this, she turns to charm; Oswen sees Bel is ready to help, so holds back Counterspell since Eloren seems to have been having a lot of luck resisting things; and Kindle, ADV WIS save (since he naturally resists charm effects) - nat 20. No effect at all. Frustrated yet again, she tries to strike out (Grave Strike) but is disadvantaged by the sunlight and appears to struggle to draw on necrotic energies powered by her own blood; dirty 20 to hit, which certainly does; 3 necrotic damage, 8 from the hit, 11 total; Kindle CON save to hold his spell; ADV due to Warcaster - low roll but enough, holds it. Eloren has another go, but this one misses; Kindle was ready for it.

Now she starts climbing up the bookshelf trying to escape! She hangs off the ceiling, hissing at us; "DAMMON! Get him!"

Bel tries L3 Hold Person to hold both her and Dammon. D16 WIS save. Dammon is held! Eloren makes her save and laughs. "You pathetic fool! You think that has even a snowball's chance in hell of working on me?!" - he uses Mantle Of Inspiration - and 14 temp HP are given to everyone other than himself, *including* Brn. And he shouts, "Brn - get out of here!" - and Brn uses his Reaction (thanks to Bel's magic) to dash out of the room. Kindle moves towards the door with his Reaction too, trying to block the door because it looks like Eloren might follow, but this darkens a corner of the room. Eloren dashes across the ceiling to that corner.

Dammon tries to break Bel's hold but fails once again.

Eloren tries once again to Command, but this time it's aimed at Bel ("requiring no components" - Oswen can't see a way to counter it). She says, "Come!" (as in, "approach me"). WIS save for Bel this time, but he has magic resistance and he'd fail, but uses Heroic Inspiration for another advantage and this time just makes it. Close call, though.

Oswen can't do much - but she can use the Drift Globe, as it's recharged. She throws it across from Kindle and commands it to full Daylight. She holds her position, to avoid grouping party members together in case of area-effect spells. Eloren curses!

Inafina doesn't care that Eloren is on the ceiling thanks to her boots, so runs up to attack once more; as usual, 2 charge strike, 23 damage, Stunning Strike would've worked but is (legendarily) resisted again; another 2-charge strike (with ADV from the resisted Strike) hits but only 2d8+d10+6 -> 13 damage this time, then tries to hit unarmed; one miss, one hit but only 12 damage. Eloren tries to claw back at Inafina aggressively, but is in sunlight; hits easily even so, it's 14 damage total; there go the temp HP; but is Grappled.

It seems Eloren is trying to use Inafina to get away from the Driftglobe light, but it's not enough. Kindle's frustrated, because he can't redirect the sunbeam at her without hitting Inafina too. Kindle holds his action, then, to use that if she *does* move.

Eloren takes another 20 radiant damage just from the sunlight that's coming off the Driftglobe; it's below her, shining up; she bites down on Inafina! CON save, only 3. 8 piercing, 10 necrotic, the latter decreasing her max HP. Eloren regains those 10. She uses that blood to flick another blood attack; one at Oswen and one at Kindle. Disadvantaged though. Hits Oswen easily, misses Kindle. Oswen takes 9 bludgeoning and 7 necrotic. Oswen holds her spell.

Eloren starts to try and drag Inafina, but moves slowly because of dragging Inafina and the slowing effect of the otherwise-resisted Stunning Strike.

Bel uses Bardic Inspiration to try and encourage Inafina to get away from Eloren - not that Inafina needed encouragement. He then casts Psychic Lance, just trying to get her to waste her energies on resisting effects. "Time to cause you a headache, since you're causing us one!" - 25 damage, INT save; she has to use another Resistance to fend off the worst of it. She's badly injured now. Eloren uses Command again, this time on Bel. "Flee!" she says.

Brn does whatever he does having run out of the room! Eloren continues to try and drag Inafina to move to another corner of the room, which is not quite in sunlight.

Dammon tries to break free again - fails! Eloren crawls further - and just manages to make it into the dark(er) corner. It's not as dark as she thought, and needs to choose; hide behind Inafina, or keep Inafina between her and - insight tells her the bigger issue is - Kindle's sunbeam.

Oswen goes for Chromatic Orb at L3. She's seen lightning work from Inafina's staff, so blasts that out. It's a hit, just, but surprisingly powerful - *31* lightning damage, 5d8 - 1+6+8+8+8. Inafina is released as Eloren bursts into dust! Oswen HIS 10, Inafina 1! Neither of them understand what happened.

There's a moment where we all just freeze there, in this uncomfortably bright room, unsure what to do next. The Oswen goes, "Oh, wait, Dammon!" - Bel is still holding him in place. She walks up to him and says, "Eloren was going to abandon you. If you three stay in Abergast, then I cannot guarantee - I cannot promise - that we could help you get away. BUT. I do have an inkling. A way we might be able to take a few more, IF the way out works magically how I expect. But it might not, so that's one reason why I couldn't do a deal with Eloren. Bel? Let him go." "Are you sure?" "Yes". Bel drops it.

"Is she gone? Really?" asks Dammon. We don't know for sure, so Dammon tells us to go to the crypt. Bel and Kindle head off with him, searching for Brn. Inafina and Oswen stay to investigate the room. Oswen doesn't find much. Investigation nat 4, FFS, a frustrating day. Only 17. She finds the spell book and a few other contracts. They're still intact, which is worrying. Ten of them, other than her unsigned one. She gathers them up to examine later.

There are belongings on the ground that fell when Eloren turned to dust. This includes a small key on a pendant, which she takes. The desk isn't locked, so she's not sure what that's for.

Inafina is looking rather than investigating. 25. A panel seems to be hidden using a picture behind the desk - the picture frame has a slight gap, the picture itself a panel. She pushes on it. It slides aside! Inside, there is a small jar containing a trapped creature. It looks like it's made of smoke and dust. "Oswen! What is this?!" she says. Oswen has a look. It's a smoke mephit. It might attack, but it has been sealed here for *some* reason.

Now, the books... Most are illusory! One row seems real. She scans the spines. Some histories of *this* realm. Battles and so-on. She gathers some of those because they're very rare; a history of a doomed Shadowfell realm. Could provide remarkable insight. Besides, it remembers those who may have died and be forever lost here.

Oswen has a feeling she's missed something but tempus fugit and we head off in search of the others. Brn isn't being quiet and neither for that matter is Bel, so it's easy! In the far corner of the house a set of stairs lead down to a cellar level. The whole area here "feels" very magically constructed. The four are standing there, looking at a sarcophagus that's behind a magical, possibly warded barrier. It's a kind of crypt, complete with gate. Bel's trying to pick the lock but Oswen suggests it's magical; he tries Dispel Magic instead; he has to roll, gets a 26, but the barrier doesn't move. Oswen doesn't know the exact numbers but is surprised, and it doesn't look like that barrier is going to come down that way. So she tries to study it in more detail. Arcana - where was this roll for Investigation a minute ago? `:-)` - 32. She tries out a few things, including a cantrip or two thrown at it; it's a kind of net of force, same as the thing her staff made. She thinks about that; probably then her staff's force wall can't be dispelled either. She might have to test that one day!

She realises that the wall of force is on the same geometric plane as the gate, and had thought that Bel couldn't pick the lock because of that, but it seems that the "mesh" has a hole and the lock is accessible - but it could still be trapped, or independent - she asks people to step back and simply tries the key she found upstairs. Ha! Not warded at all, and connected. She says, "Sorry, I thought that might be independently cast, or warded in some way that the key alone wouldn't solve - but it has". The whole force cage effect has dropped, so there's no longer a door to walk through.

There's a sarcophagus there. Dammon tells us that the mist happens if Eloren needs to escape desperately; it has to return here and would squeeze through the gaps. And *she* has the key, which would then be *inside*. But we saw no mist. Even so, Dammon insists we push open the sarcophagus. Inside, there's a satin lining with pillows and some beautiful decorations. It is, otherwise, empty. "I guess that's that" says Inafina.

"I don't know how long this realm will last without her here to maintain it" says Oswen, "so we perhaps should head back to Abergast! Oh, Dammon! Any idea what *this* is?!" - holds the jar. "WHAT? Where did you find that?!" - he seems astonished. He knows what it is, but is surprised to see it; he is hopeful. She says, "oh, is this yours, or related to you?" "It's all of ours! It's how - this is..." - he stops, looking ashamed - "...I needed her help. We all did, in our way, all of us. And unlike you, we didn't have a choice."

Oswen says, "I don't think the details matter. In a place like this, people do what they have to and hanging onto any sort of morals at all is a surprising win" and hands him the jar. He refuses. "It is all of ours" he says. We start to leave and Oswen says on the way, "well, look" - but as she's trying to talk, he's speeding up! - "wait, why are we running?!" "I don't know what's holding this place up! And you have the jar!" - whatever *that* means, we speed up, heading towards the door; Oswen's force wall ran out of power a short while ago.

As we exit and start to run, he tells us to wait outside the gates. The jar can't be taken in! He says he's trusting us; he says we don't owe him anything, but begs us to wait. Well, sure! So he runs in and then, a few minutes later, all three exit. They all look conflicted somehow.

Oswen says, "So, you all look in quite a state."

The female Tiefling asks us, "Is it true?!" - Oswen, realising we're not supposed to let the town see this jar, shows it but uses her body to block the view from town. We head off-road to a sheltered spot and they get a proper look.

"It is! It is, you're right!" she exclaims.

The third says, "It's *everyone*. Everyone is in there."

Huh?! We ask. "We have a contract" they say, "with Lady Eloren. As assurance, she took a piece of our being - a piece of our..." - "Soul?" offers Kindle - "...I guess? So that we could never betray her. We knew she kept them somewhere safe, as a sort of an insurance policy." As they're saying this, Oswen is starting to rifle through those 10 contracts she has. They point out their three quickly enough. Well, the contract shouldn't apply since she's dead now but the souls are still separated. The creature in the jar, a Smoke Mephit we realise, was *fed* these three things. It's holding them. "Destroy the Mephit?" asks Oswen. "But what if it gets away?" We need to stop it somehow. Another wall of force!

Oswen sets up a hemispherical dome with just the four of us inside. Inafina smashes the jar with her staff; the Mephit comes screeching out, now *visibly* full of souls - fat from the meal! Oswen shouts, "Cough up the souls and we'll let you go, but if not, we'll blast you with sunlight!" - it starts to fill up the dome with smoke, so we attack. In a couple of rounds it's gone, though the dome is full of smoke. Oswen takes it down as soon as soon as she can and - as we finally get some clean air - we see the wisps of soul dart out and *slam* one each into the Tieflings. They reel backwards and then they change - they lose the matt sheen they'd had on their skin; their horns go; and suddenly, it's **three humans** standing before us.

"We're - free..."

We have to learn which is which again. Dammon then pulls into his pocket and produces a very ornate metal token. "We have no plans of going back in that direction now that we're free!" and hands it to Bel. Oswen chuckles; "well, do you have anything else that can help us with the trader ruse? Or know somewhere that can give us a horse and cart?" "You're welcome to have the horse and carriage! You can have the goods... We'll - if it's not too presumptuous? - keep the gold." "But it's your stuff." "No, it's *hers* - we don't want anything to do with these."

There's a question of how we'll be able to get the horse and carriage since the stable expects a tiefling! But Bel's hat of disguise lets him impersonate Dammon.

The three of them head off, astonished at the outcome. Bel in the end goes as Dammon with Inafina to say a deal's been done and tell them Inafina is the new owner. She's certainly distinctive. We have to collect it tomorrow (or pay more) by a certain time.

Mirianne must be getting worried! We hasten to the Inn to see if she's OK - the moon has almost set; it must be dinner time. But she's fast asleep, so no worries there and we wait a while. Oswen and Inafina are both now very drained! But Oswen now has the spellbook, and a collection of jewellery. Another Identify while we wait. Anything good?

* Ring of Protection
* Amulet of Health - that explains how often she resisted Inafina's attacks!

The rest of it is assessed by Bel and it's quite valuable. A necklace, diadem, earrings... Something to trade at the city, perhaps, unless it might arouse suspicion.

Oswen sighs heavily. Tired. "Tomorrow, we need to get on the road to the city" she says. "Do we have time to get any food before nightfall, do you think?" - Bel says, "Well, how dangerous can it be? They shut the gates at moonfall..."

We get Brn to stay with Mirriam and decide to find out what the town is like after moonfall; we want to get some food and bring it back to the room for everyone. But then Brn says, "I want to see what it's like out there! Kindle will look after me! I promise not to wander off."

Clearly this is not optional, so we agree.

There's a place across town that Bel knows, but if it *does* get rough then we might have a hard time getting home. There's the same cafe again. Less adventurous but safer and Inafina and Oswen are in favour of that option! We make sure we order for Mirriam too. Melted cheese put onto toasty bread, goat steaks, barley and carrot salad. Then a round of drinks.

While we're drinking, we hear a clock on the city hall ring in the hour. Others don't seem to react, though, so we think nothing much of it. We pay (3gp), with a take-away bundle for Mirriam. We head towards the inn; then Inafina notices something odd (perception 17) - two people running across the street, like a blur; curious; then we hear music starting towards the centre of town. We investigate! On the way, we hear the sounds of the main gates being closed up. At the town square, we're surprised to see a lively band playing and quite a few shops in the centre are open. It's lively!

The shops look like they have guards outside, which is odd. Revelry around the band; we look closer and see that they're on a raised area, but with a high fence around them! Oswen looks, studying for changes, investigating... (27)... They're changing. Lycanthropes. Were-jackals, were-dogs, were-rats. All manner of things. There's a lot of drinking and revelry can turn to rowdy, but there are guards (who aren't changing) and this just seems - how things are.

Oswen speaks to a guard and learns that this place is a safe haven - a "free city" - for were-folk. That's why they're so against having vampires in town; they do *not* get along! "Fight to the death" territory.

So, they might not know their strength and self-control may be low, so we can't get too close but the shops are interesting. A fletcher/leather worker, late-night grocer, bookshop, some places for drinking and one snack place. It's all sweet - and of course Brn is getting excited! - we head there. It's a surprising array of good stuff, with a great window display.

Whatever she might have imagined the Shadowfell to be, this isn't it. Really - not so bad!

Inside, Brn picks 3 things from a 3-for-2 deal, 1sp. A were-rat kid is buying in the queue in front of us. Brn's not sure about that, but kids are kids and tend not to judge things like that.

Next, supplies. We're running a bit low and can't rely on finding anything in the wild. 3 days, 6 people - 18 rations - we round up to 20 worth; dried or cured meats, cheeses, dried fruit and nuts; we also are able to get more fresh stuff to eat sooner. Given the amount, the storekeeper also throws in a bottle of a sweet fruit juice - spotting Brn - "the young ones love this!" she says.

Oswen notices that while Brn runs to Kindle for protection, he's built a kind of sparring, sibling-like relationship with Bel; Bel talks a lot, Brn talks a lot and over time they're finding a level.

We get back to the inn. Mirriam is awake; she and Oswen catch up, a bit of a heart-to-heart. Eventually we sleep - Mirriam offers to be on watch, since she's fairly well rested already.

Despite being very tired, Oswen can't resist reading the recovered spellbook in bed. She puts the driftglobe under the covers for soft light. Investigation 24 to find things, Arcana 27 to understand them. The book has a name; "**The blooded tome of storms**". Lots of spells; most of the transmuter school, it seems; that was apparently Eloren's interest.

L1

* Alarm (copied)
* Expeditious Retreat

L5

L7

* Force Cage
* Finger Of Death

Not a nice book. But it represents years of study, to be able to master these spells, many of which Oswen has not seen before. She knows what the L7 spells should do, she thinks, but they're beyond her capacity to actually copy or cast them.



## Campaign day 41

The moon rises, therefore it's morning. Oswen wakes up under the covers, two spellbooks open and the driftglobe still on! As she stirs, so does everyone else. Mirriam has a nap while the rest of us do our "morning" routine. Bel pops out for - something - and comes back shortly after with breakfast. There was a place he'd seen that he wanted to try!

Off to the stables. Inafina picks up our new-second-hand wagon and draft horse. The wagon has a raised open seat in front for driving which comfortably fits two, then a sort of small carriage section just behind where 2-3 people could sit. Then there's the main cargo area, canvas-covered, where another person could conceivably sit on guard. There are various boxes of random things, all associated with Eloren and thus disowned by the three men who basically gifted this to us. We recognise them.

* The chest with some items of silk
* The boxed tray of perfume
* The gloves for "Friends" and mask for "False Life"

They were *selling* here, so we can assume the idea isn't to go back with a fully loaded wagon, quite the reverse, so this all works and means we can leave heavier kit here. Kindle goes to make friends with the horse. But none of us can speak with the beast, so what's their name? They're kind of stocky, wide, female, grey with darker patches. Inafina suddenly announces, "Pebble! We'll call her Pebble for now." (More of a boulder, but she's trying to be polite).

Turns out Bel and Kindle are best with the horse, so they get volunteered to do driving duty. Brn wants to be up-front, therefore, but as it's already a tight squeeze this is one battle has to lose and he sits in the main wagon. Inafina decides to go there too. Mirriam and Oswen get the carriage.

We get underway. We were worried that the horse might have a slow start, because it's carrying five people plus a child and one of those people is large, plus all our gear. But at least Oswen is smaller. The sarcophagus would've come along too - we can see an outline in the dust and straw on the bed of the wagon. And Oswen did spot a fair number of real books, too. So perhaps we're not that much heavier than usual after all.

It had transpired that Bel, ever-thoughtful, picked up a spare set of clothes for Mirriam and Brn and cloak for each of them while in town. They'd left with literally only the clothes on their backs and, apart from any other concerns, they're overdue a good clean. With them in their new clothes from the morning, Oswen sets to work on their previous set with Prestidigitation.

The conversation with the two of them is a bit stilted at first, as they're still getting to know each other. Oswen insight 11, Mirriam feels awkward because she feels like she can't help. She feels like dead weight. She doesn't have an excuse of being a child! But Oswen points out how the four of them started from very little, in Oswen's case without Mirriam's practical skills for example. Mirriam is good with a forge and so-on. And she'd be good at assessing that blade (but don't touch it! Mirriam learns that we *think* the sword seeks power, so Mirriam points out that she could probably touch it very safely as it'd never seek her out. See? Useful!)

Up-front, Bel perception nat 1, talking away the whole time; but Kindle, perception 26. The moon will be going down soon, he realises, and we're in the wilds. We should look for somewhere to camp, somewhere defensible or an inn. Oswen sends up Orvil - perception 17+1 -> 18, he's getting into his new raven form. There is in fact a small inn (by usual roadside standards), maybe a handful of rooms, but it's there and it's positioned where it needs to be to keep people safe if heading to the city. So, we push and not too long later we're there.

They're well set up for traders, unsurprisingly. We're in a bit of a valley, having been gently climbing prior, but here is a gentle dip with a stream where the inn is set up. A plume of smoke from the chimney stretches up into a windless sky - this is how Orvil first saw something, otherwise hidden by this little dip. This is **The Sturdy Boot Inn**. We have to hurry inside; the moon is almost setting. Kindle stays to secure the horse and cart.

We enter into a dining room with a small bar. A person there waves to us. Brn's grip suddenly tightens on Inafia's hand. Her insight (22) makes her realise that there's something - *not quite right* - about the hosts. While the other three continue, Inafina turns so her body blocks the view of person who waved, making a show of "dusting off" Brn, "What do you see?" she whispers. He explains that he can see when people aren't "right". Inafina says she sees something too, but they're all together. We'll be on our guard.

One room 4 people, one room 2 people, dinner and breakfast and stabling etc. - all comes to 4gp.

We're given a couple of keys and advised to look the door if we go out - unlikely as we're told there's not much to see! - or when asleep. The rooms are next to each other.

Kindle and Oswen in the 2-room, everyone else in the 4-room. The five of us (for now, Kindle still outside) confer with Inafina and Brn's insight, so Oswen Messages Kindle for when he comes in to check the hosts carefully. When Kindle comes in, he's waved to as well; insight 18+8! We greet him downstairs and head back up. He realises they were not breathing; they're undead of some kind; but we don't know more than that. He says, "They're not undead... As such...? There's something else about them. I was going to say they're not of this plane, but maybe it's more that they *are* of this plane, specifically. Shadow people. Maybe that's why Brn spotted it." Well, that's the way this plane is! But we'll be on our guard, just in case.

We head downstairs for food. A group of four are here, traders; one lone person with an oilskin coat and wide-brimmed hat, too. Funnily, we feel a bit safer because it's not just us.

There are two people who seem to run this. They act delighted that there are six of us, but initially mistake us for a family! It's a bit disconcerting as we're not sure if we can treat what's said as true but we play along. There's a choice of food - which we paid for with the room - with starters and mains.

Inafina thinks the solo person is the most obviously mysterious - but the four "obvious traders" should have a wagon or cart, and Kindle didn't see one. She eavesdrops! ADV perception, 26; they're talking about it having been a good trading run, one isn't so sure given the costs involved, another argues back that they're always pessimistic. They seem to think they might not want to do it again; "this might be my last run" she hears. She keeps listening, but they sound quite legit. On a whim, without asking the others, she gets up and heads over - "Gentlemen! My name is Inafina. We're traders, new to the game, and I thought I overheard you talking about a trading run, wondered if you had any tips to share?"

There's some RP (!) - there's some sharing of info and some suspicion. They often do a run to supply to Keeps and if they sell everything, often sell the wagon too and walk back. A complex approach but it works for them. As Inafina ends up back at the table she overhears them worrying about us stealing from them; so she warns Oswen that maybe when we're all on watch tonight, we try to watch *everything* if we can and not just our own rooms. We don't want to be blamed for something we didn't do.

We've finished the food by this point and a bowl of trifle is produced!

They're going to shut the kitchen. We play for time as Inafina now tries to watch the target she'd considered "too obviously mysterious"! A drink is brought over to them and it gives her an opportunity to watch how they behave. They're definitely watching the room; wary; doesn't seem to eat, just drinks. We don't have many excuses to keep sitting there unless we get more drink, so Inafina heads up to the bar. The outside door opens; Inafina perception 21; the bartender reacts as one would expect; but the loan guest reacts too, in a way he didn't previously. They're paying attention to whoever is arriving - and therefore, so is she!

They come in fully and we now see a well-dressed gentleman in riding clothes, *accompanied by a guard*. In their 50s. They talk about the roads being "terrible" and order food and drink, along with a room. They take a table. In the corner, the shadowed figure has moved back to try and hide themselves in the shadow. Not subtle really but even so - appears to want to be overlooked, which is suspicious and Inafina wonders if this might be a potential thief and mark situation. The kitchen had been closed but there's a commotion as things get started up again.

The well-dressed man makes deliberate noise and so-on with getting sat down. Turns to the table of traders, "good evening!" and same to us. We acknowledge back. Inafina insight 23 again - these are living, breathing people and this guy seems actually *nervous*, so that's what the noise is all about. He's breathing quite quickly in fact. Fleeing something? Travelling fast? Caught out in the dark.

Inafina says, "We just ordered drinks, so we'll be here a while longer. Safety in numbers. Want to join our table?"

They decline. "I'm not great around children!" he says.

So she tries a new angle. "You said the roads were rough... What exactly did you encounter? We had an easy run!" - but now the other table is listening and the new arrivals seem evasive. "You know! The usual. The perils of the road!" "But you came from Abergast this morning, I guess?" "Oh no, we came from the capital. I'm headed up to see relatives." - and Inafina thinks that seems true enough; he doesn't seem to be lying, at least not in an obvious way. But he's sweating, curiously.

Corner guy is nursing their drink and being as inconspicuous as possible. So far they seem to have escaped notice by the new arrival. And he's gone from aimless time-passing crowd watching and slowly drinking, to not drinking at all. He *pretends* to now!

She could try and draw attention to him. But that might mess up a plan which is important. The alternative is to draw attention to ourselves and keep them *off* him. Group perception: Generally low, with Oswen 14 one of the highest unusually, but Kindle and 24, Inafina at nat 20->27. She figures she'll try that instead. She wants Bel to go talk to corner guy. But when he turns - the person is gone. Yet as she asks, she hears a whisper from that corner and sees the remnants of the shape of that person disappearing into shadowy smoke. He's hidden, somehow, a supernatural ability to hide in shadow. She think she's still there but no longer actually visible. Bel and Oswen don't even know where he is!

Inafina shrugs and asks new guy, "Is it a long way between this inn and the previous waypoint?" "That depends! We decided to gallop for it. We came from the Wall this morning."

"But you had to gallop?"

"We decided not to stop at the Wayfarer's Rest along the way. We may have overestimated how fast we could be, though! I would definitely have liked to have been here at least an hour if not two earlier."

Her insight at *that* tells her there was a reason they didn't want to stop there.

"Don't like the Wayfarer's Rest?"

"Why take two days to do something that be done in one!" - and *that* is clearly a cover.

The other four finish up and head out. We're nearly finished. Mirriam and Brn go to the room, so just four plus two plus - possibly - one still hidden. As they walk away, we notice Brn looks directly at the corner where the guy was and appears to see someone. Brn can see them!

Inafina tries to get Bel to weigh in. He's better dressed etc. and maybe more on a level. The angle is that if there are dangers on the road that caused them to go fast, then it'd be good to know - we're headed that way ourselves. The man just starts listing Bel various dangers on the road! Inafina Insight 23; but that's now why they didn't stop at Wayfarer's Rest. He seems to be keeping the information about Wayfarer's Rest to himself, but it seems he is being cautious about it. So he's dodging that part. We won't get an answer in this room with the staff present and this other guy, she thinks. At least we learn his name - **Bartholomew**.

The guard has remained silent the whole time, other than thanking the matron when she delivers the food. He must just be paid guard, since Bartholomew is paying for all food and drink himself but the guard isn't e.g. looking after the money themselves as someone in permanent employ might do.

She overhears that they also have an upstairs room. We bid farewell to them in due course and head up, following the other two, and once upstairs we can talk more freely and compare notes. On the way past, Oswen (arcana dirty 20) doesn't recognise any specific magic around, but does realise that the person in the corner is still there. But just *in* the shadows somehow. Shrouded - camouflaged, almost. When she realises *that* she can see him.

She'd like to talk to him in private, as well as new guy in private.

We hang out, getting read for bed but otherwise keeping an ear out for people coming up. Bartholomew and the guard come up and we hear a door close across the corridor; probably room 3. Once in there, Inafina asks Bel if he'd come with her and knocks on the door. "It's Inafina and Bel - we were chatting downstairs!" - the door opens enough for Bartholomew to head out but he doesn't let us in, he ends up stepping out. He's OK coming to *our* room. But it doesn't get us anywhere. It's all perfectly polite; but we learn little.

After talking later, Oswen decides to set up an Alarm on that room - but there already is one! So *that* is why he won't let us in. She sets her one on top of that, audible so anyone on watch gets it. And of course she also ritual-casts on their own rooms, both of them, with our party members included. She's worried about downstairs so has Orvil hide in a dark corner down there and watch the downstairs corridor. We're watching for unexpected people movements.

Outside, the weather is degrading; wind is picking up, driving light rain onto the windows that gradually intensifies. Looks like it'll be a stormy night.

Watch is finally set.

* Orvil perception 15. No movement downstairs. The traders are in whatever room they're in - he doesn't actually know, because they don't leave all night - and nobody else comes or goes. Who knows where the shadowy man got to!

* Oswen perception 8. She's relying on the alarm too much and gets distracted by the spellbook to easily.

* Inafina - 12 - hears nothing! But then the bell goes off.

**Everyone** wakes up. Oswen says - "Bartholomew" - *and* realises she can hear their own room alarm going off! Before says anything else, Inafina is already running to get over there. Inafina runs to the corridor. She's in a fluster, nat 1 perception! "No!" calls Oswen, as Inafina puts her foot straight down onto a glyph of warding, **which explodes with magical energy!**

WIS saves: Inafina 14, Oswen 17; and Oswen Arcana 25. She recognises it's a Sleep symbol, drawn with 1000gp of powdered diamond. Whoever put that down is *wealthy* and very skilled. She doesn't think she could cast that herself. Inafina faceplants the floor, unconscious. Everyone else was waking up from the alarm too - and *they* all have to make WIS saves - and all succeed, including in the other room. Kindle and Bel over there. We're all now in the hallway. Bel tries to shake Inafina awake (and she wakes) but Oswen is already at Bart's room; it's not open, but there's a trace of shadow - as she expected, the "shadow" person from last night no doubt - and there's noise of shouting. She runs to open the door, quickly trying to look for traps, takes a moment - but perception only 6 - she drops the Alarm on the room to stop the noise; opens the door; she sees Bart and the guard awake, Bart reaching for a weapon, the guard fully armoured (must've slept in it) also reaching for a weapon - and the shadow person is now recognisable as a Shadar-Kai. It wields shadow blades and is materialising.

Initiative:

* Inafina (ADV from Kindle) 26
* Kindle 21
* Bel 9
* Oswen only 3

Oswen and, in fact Bel both realise that the sleep-like spell will continue until explicitly dispelled. She calls back to Bel behind her, "Bel! We need to take down that sleep glyph!"

Inafina jumps up to her feet, barely aware she'd even fallen asleep and runs past Oswen into the room (their alarm goes off again), sees the forming-shadow and calls out, "You are uninvited, explain yourself!" to the shadow-creature while positioning herself between it and the other two. She readies an action to attack if she is in turn attacked. WIS save, 18. She stays conscious.

The Shadar-Kai acts. It - he? - materialises fully and emits a strange wave (Of Weariness) which feels like a kind of deep depression; hopelessness. Without hat an oilskin, he seems cloaked in darkness that looks almost slick, robbing the area of light; skin is ash, matte; hair is in thick braids, pulled back, that look oily. His eyes are orbs of featureless black. Inafina has never seen anything like it. The wave hits everyone. CON saves.

* Oswen 6 even with Inspo blown
* Inafina 15 also even with Inspo blown
* Kindle Low, but passes with Inspo blown
* Bel Low, also fails despite Inspo

So wow, ADV rolls for everyone yet 7 fails and only 1 roll passes. The guard also fails, but Bart holds on. Everyone who fails takes *41* psychic damage and a level of exhaustion! That's about 2/3rds for everyone in the party except Kindle. The guard is messed up too, and in fact it's surprising they're not taken down. The noble doesn't look so hurt, which is curious; Oswen sees Bart reacting by casting a spell or otherwise triggering something. She recognises it as wizard magic. Some kind of protective barrier appears around the guard which is probably the only reason why they're not taken down.

The Shadar-Kai speaks to Inafina. "Move out of the way or be destroyed."

Inafina tries to respond in attack, but it's a nat 1!

Kindle sees three friends badly hurt, but Bel is outside; he has to step into the room *over* Oswen's head, bending down under the doorway and invokes Channel Divinity. He restores 2d8+4 -> 16hp to Inafina; then throws L4 Healing Word to Oswen, restoring 19hp; he moves in next to the Shadar-Kai. As for his sleep WIS save - nat 20!

Bel isn't sure what to do. He's hurt badly, but heard Oswen shout about the sleep spell; so he tries Dispel Magic using the mandolin. It's a high level effect he's trying to beat, and he can't manage it. At least he has enough time and power left to cast Healing Word on himself and pulls himself back from the brink, healing for 13hp. He moves to the door behind Oswen but then - WIS save; he fails and falls asleep.

Bart has been bought some time - and he too is casting Dispel Magic, which Oswen sees and is surprised by. She'd assumed the glyph was his, but it must've been the Shadar-Kai instead. In any event, this time it's enough; Bart succeeds and the sleep effect drops. He swiftly grabs his backpack, his rod - which he handles as if a weapon - but realises he's cornered. Exits are blocked.

Oswen wants the drift globe. It's in the room in her pack. She doesn't know what damage types will work. Intellect Fortress can only protect a handful. But *what does it even want?!* - she tries a risky one; Detect Thoughts. Surprisingly, it works! This creature is wise, she can tell; she got lucky; surface thoughts - it was lying in wait. Ambush. It is pleased with itself. It figured that Bart would be aware that he shouldn't stop at **Wayfarer's Rest**, thinking he'd get ahead, but it too pushed on and kept ahead of Bart. Of course she pushes in deeper, *why* is it here? He's here because his queen instructed him to **intercept these people because they _have the Blade!_**

Oswen shouts out, "We must protect Bart at all costs. Trust me!"

(Bonus action: Just-in-case, she brings up Manifest Mind in the opposite corner of the room; she moves in and to the side, pressed up against the wall, but clearing the doorway)

"Meddling insidious worm. You will not leave this inn" hisses the Shadar-Kai. It starts speaking a demonic language; it seems to be calling out. Oswen shout out, "Bel, I don't know if you can reach it but the driftglobe might work". Maybe Inafina will hear that and realise what she plans, too. Kindle says, "Oh, we need light?" "BRIGHT light!"

The guard brandishes their great-sword and moves next to Inafina, as if to cover Bart's escape. The way they do that makes this seem different from what we thought before; a hired guard is facing certain death here, they'd flee surely?! This seems more like a *cause*. And Bart burned magic to shield them. Two heavy swings. A hit, then a crit! 28 damage. He strangely seems to heal a bit - and then curiously, steels himself up and surges back again, to swing twice more! This time, only one hits, but it's 13 more damage. He's used a *lot* though.

Inafina jumps back to gain a bit of distance - but notices she's moving slowly, from the earlier spell effect dragging her down - she knows the Shadar-Kai will get a swing in on her; it *just* misses - then throws out radiant sunbolts. With a focus point, all four *should* hit but again, she's dragged down from its earlier spell effect and what's more, it doesn't seem to hurt it more than normal. 3d10+20 -> total damage 26. Perception 17; the bolts seared the creature like any other living creature, but it seems otherwise ambivalent. Disappointing! So she gets back into its face again! She shouts, "Daylight didn't do anything special! Bel, don't bother with globe!"

Well at least it looks like it's a *little* bit messed up. And it doesn't hit us with that strange, draining effect a second time. It can *see* Bart behind Inafina and the guard; it points its finger and speaks a word - to Oswen it's terrifying; she read it in that spell book. *Finger Of Death*. She immediately reacts with Counterspell. CON 18, but it has ADV as it has magic resistance; and it just fails, even so. **Lucky**.

The creature curses at Oswen. "The next one? I have my finger on YOU"

Kindle's heard the "Use daylight!" "No, don't use daylight!" command and contradiction and, even though that's all happened in very fast succession, understood what's going on. With a bonus action he casts L5 Spirit Guardians. All of the sages and old priests of Yondalla are called upon. They appear flitting around him, coming and going, filling the room, even sweeping out to the corridor beyond. Everyone except the Shadar-Kai is considered "ally", but (nat 20) it resists the full damage. Still takes half of 5d8 -> 22 => 11. Then he runs up with the mace and attacks. He matches the AC, thanks to being the one who saved against that draining effect earlier - 7 damage.

At this point, shadows start to emerge from the ground. This must be what the Shadar-Kai had called forth - and we realise that these are the innkeepers! - but they're slowed by the Spirit Guardians. One fails and one succeeds, so they take 22/11 - but it's radiant, so 44/22 damage, heavily injuring the first one, so it slips sideways. They still manage to emerge fully, one in the corridor - it attacks Bel but misses. In the room, the less-injured demon hits Bart for what would be 22 damage, but he again reacts with an arcane ward - the attack sinks into the arcane shield and none of its damage reaches him at all.

Seeing just the one in the room, Infina shouts, "a Shadow Demon! Bel! We *do* need daylight!" - she's unaware that Bel is *well* aware!

The shadow in the room tries to leave. Inafina manages to hit it with an opportunity attack; she knows it won't hurt so much so throws in a couple of staff charges. It takes some halved-down damage, but she also throws in a stunning strike. It resists that too, but is slowed and disadvantaged; it can't escape Kindle's emanation range and, despite even saving against that, the vulnerability to radiant causes 25 more damage and when it's all added up, that's too much - it loses cohesion and is banished back to whatever realm it considers home.

Bel is more aware than Inafina of the danger as he had to parry with his rapier to block the first attack. He runs over to Oswen's backpack, the driftglobe is easy to find as it's on top (quite large) and activates it at full blast, pulling it into the hallway. With his bonus action he grants Bardic Inspiration to Bart, who he can see through the door; Oswen said we must protect him.

Bart throws Arcane Bursts at the Shadar-Kai. Two would miss, sadly, Bart having been slowed by that early-on effect - but he has Bardic Inspiration. That makes it a hit, 16 damage. The other hits too, for 25 damage. Bart is now running for the door, shouting back to Oswen, "I don't know how you happened to be here but I'm thankful you are!" - he slips out the door.

The Shadar-Kai is very badly injured. Oswen figures any good hit could take it down. But she's not taking chances. It threatened her with that terrible spell - L4 Scorching Ray - 5 of them! - and every one of them hits, despite her being somewhat drained from its effects. To her surprise it also doesn't resist the fire and 35 damage destroys it completely. All that's left is a wisp of shadow, a cloak - and a pile of feathers.

Oswen's eyebrows raise. **Raven Queen** - we're in big trouble! - she shouts, "get after Bartholomew!" - and runs out, shielding her eyes against the driftglobe. She catches up and says, "WAIT! The Shadar-Kai is down but there are bound to be more." "We should get out of here!" "Not at night! And there's still *that*!" - and points at the remaining shadow demon that's right next to them, in blindly-bright hallway!

The guard runs out too - it sees the shadow demon immediately, another crit this time, but then a miss. 17->8 damage. Inafina runs out and throws two radiant sun bolts; despite the guard giving it some cover, *and* the draining effect, both hit and are very high damage - 2d8+10 total, 15+10 -> 25 doubles to 50, burns it right up. She runs past (insight 12, nothing more - misses something important!) so runs around, to the stairs, to try and stop Bart fleeing based on what Oswen had said.

(It doesn't occur to Oswen or Inafina in the heat of the moment, to think about the traders or any other shadow demons that might be around).

Kindle (very luckily) rolls very high on insight - with a sharp intake of breath and widening eyes, he runs back to the room and finds both **Brn and Mirriam appear to be dead**. "No!" he shouts, casting Spare The Dying on Brn immediately; Healing Word on Mirriam - that's enough to bring her up (but she still seems to be asleep). Inafina is shocked to hear him calling - "Brn and Mirriam! They're down! They're dying!" he calls in anguish. He figured that the psychic attack from the Shadar Kai might've been wide-ranging and hit a lot of people. Our friends here; the traders downstairs.

"Bring the globe!" shouts Kindle to Bel - "Check all the rooms!". Bel calls to Bart, "Whatever is going on, *do not run* we need to stick together!" - nat 20 *intimidation*! - grabs the driftglobe and to him it makes sense to use Dimension Door; as Oswen sees him starting to cast she realises what he plans and calls, "I'll Message you!" as Bel says "I don't know your name but you're coming with me!" to the Guard, taking them both down there. Inafina hears Bel say, "Oh, *shit*" - not like him to swear. That's *bad*.

Bart concedes! "You're all very... Magical... We're not enemies! We're on the same side I think?" - looks to Oswen, "I'm not a threat!" - and he casts Mage Armour on himself to which Oswen says, "You had that the whole time? Waited long enough, didn't you?!" - but it's an unusual version. Another arcane ward forms around him, strands of the casting, she's not seen that before. It's very self-protective. He says, "So what are we doing?"

Oswen shouts, "Kindle, if they're stable, downstairs need help!" then to Bart, "Come with me" and she runs downstairs, and it turns out everyone else is following. Kindle carries Brn. Down there, we see Bel dragging someone into the dining room; the guard has *three*, all apparently dead. Oswen says, "Dammit, I have *no* healing at all! Kindle, can you do anything?" - Medicine 19. They *are* "dead dead". Kindle has Revivify; we need diamonds; the jewellery? History 24. No! That glyph - diamond powder - the Shadar Kai. She tells Inafina to run up and check. Perception (with Bardic d10 -> 10, luckily) 21; she finds a bag of the powder. D12 -> 7. 700gp worth. She gets back down, we're on about round 6ish equivalent here; Bel remembers a *few* diamonds from appraising Eloren's jewellery - D20 > 10 => there are some diamonds, 11 rolled; D6 -> 3; the necklace has half diamonds, half ruby. But we have to destroy the necklace (we don't hesitate). We tear it apart; Kindle manages to use all 3 of his L3 slots for Revivify and one L4. That's 10 rounds. Almost to the second.

People just collapse into chairs, exhausted, in many cases with capital "E". We can't rest much though - a moment later we realise we've left everything to chance. Kindle and Inafina retrieve the gear from upstairs while Oswen investigates for anything we might've missed. No demons - but two more dead bodies in a downstairs room. Dead for a few hours... The innkeeper wife and husband. Brn was actually *exactly* on the money. Not just demons impersonating; demons who replaced.

Kindle *can* bring back one, maybe the other tomorrow. Oswen says it's asking a lot - but imagine how Brn will feel. So, who first? Oswen opts for the wife. Kindle is *very* down. Oswen argues Brn shouldn't see this, but Kindle argues "I think this is the kind of hope we need to do in the open. And I need quite a bit of space." So Oswen goes out and warns Brn first; we bring out the body, lay her down; candles are laid out; Kindle asks for Divine Intervention - he can use L5 without components; chooses to cast Raise Dead. It succeeds.

She gasps to life, but is obviously *very* frail. 1hp, lots of exhaustion. Must rest, for days. No obvious wounds, at least, to heal. "No! No -" - screams, she was being attacked! - "- it's not safe, there are shadows around - wait, who are you?" then, "John, where's John?" - a lot of explaining. Kindle calms her down; he says John will be OK tomorrow.

Inafina goes to speak to the other four traders, who *now* agree they *would* walk with us. She says she's worried though about the two innkeepers, because they're in fit state to do much at all for a few days.

Bart talks to Oswen. He wants to speak in private. We find a room (Oswen beckons Bel to head in too) and before the door has even closed, with the guard standing watch, Bart says, "I... Please - understand. I am extremely thankful. I am incredibly grateful to have bumped into you. I think it's pretty sure to say that if we hadn't crossed paths I would certainly be dead, as would my bodyguard. But I have to ask. Was our meeting by chance?"

We discuss briefly. Oswen knows what he has; neither of us know why we want it; there isn't time to talk about it; we're too tired. We each promise not to run in the morning; the dining room is converted into a big sleeping room for all.

Meanwhile, in the dining room, the traders agree - they're being promised free food and board, so they agree - they'll stay a while and help her. Another alarm - not that we're in a fit state to fight much now - and we finally can rest.
