# Oswen: Part 2.3
## Day 5, Solstice, late
### Paliset Hall gala

We get to the bedroom. As Zorhanna is getting changed, Oswen - nearly out spells - casts Detect Magic via Ritual to see how bad the tendrils got.

Bel is of course very experienced as a courtier, which delights Zorhanna. He helps her out of her ruined gown; she finds something amazing to replace it; with his help, gets into it. The whole time we're all talking about everything, exchanging information.

* She had studied the Shard
* Suspected for a while that there may be some being *inside* it
* She's tried to reduce her use of it as a result
* Her vanity got the better of her! *Must* wear it for the gala, surely...
* Never suspected that just putting it on would cause issues
* Her theory is that the "pocket dimension" created inside the Far Realm - the reason the hags were "pushed" somewhere - the dimension was created within the Far Realm, but then sealed; and each time she year it was odd, she had to re-attune to the Shard, and she now thinks that's, again, because something resides within.
* "It feels like a being of pure evil" ("Isn't it always?" responds Inafina, cheekily!)

The conversation goes round in circles a bit. Talk of what is evil, some people being more neutral and not even recognising that there is strictly "a good" and "an evil". She's just saying, "Regarding this rift - who has the solitare?" but she's interrupted. Oswen's spell completes and she lets out an involuntary yelp at what she sees. "OK, sorry, sorry, but this is *really* much worse than I expected! I think going into the tear might have accelerated things... Kindle, show Zorhanna the shard! I need a look too!"

On this floor, the tendrils are now here; still thin though; but pulsing.

Zorhanna is sure we don't need to use mage hand. "It doesn't have that much power." So Kindle unfolds the portable hole and we take out the shard. Zorhanna says, "The important thing is not to put it *on*!"

Oswen clearly sees the crack. So does Zorhanna, and is surprised. The crack "leaks" purple arcane energy, which Oswen describes; "It's the same as downstairs."

Oswen Arcana, 1, then re-rolled 1, sadly. So only 11. She doesn't understand what she sees, but Zorhanna leans in to suggest what to look for, activating Detect Magic too - helps - now we get up to 22. We study it. She asks Eliphus to fetch some special seeing glasses. When she hands them to Oswen, and Oswen looks, it's possible to discern that the crack - the dimension - "is a mirror" - it contains a small version of that same reality. A visual, linked to the tear. "The diamond itself must be a component that's being consumed - a material component - that maybe was the cage holding this entity inside. There must always have been a leak! A leak into the surrounding planar matter. It must always have been there, leaking into the Far Realm and - oh! Ah. I've been wearing it every solstice, when the barriers are weakest! It must have sensed that there was a weaker boundary linked to the Shard Solitaire. I've been such a fool!"

Oswen points out that we don't have a plan or method for closing the tear. "We, regrettably, should seriously consider evacuating the Hall. And we should probably include ourselves in that evacuation."

Zorhanna thinks a while. "I wonder..." - after a long pause - "I wonder what would happen if the Shard Solitare was somewhere far away?"

Oswen's brow furrows. She thinks she knows what's coming... "How far?"

"No. No, too irresponsible. It would just move the problem somewhere else. It might buy the safety of the people who are here, but then what of the people wherever this goes? I don't know of any empty realms where nobody would be injured..."

Kindle points at the portable hole. "This?"

"Well, maybe, yes, another *dimension*."

Oswen says, "But I thought dimension and plane were sort of synonyms?"

"But a portable hole is merely a pocket dimension within this one! It would still be in this plane... I'm sure I have *something*!"

She goes to her wardrobe and fetches a small purse. Oswen asks more; the Shard in our portable hole didn't stop the tear in the basement; we need an unoccupied realm, or dimension, or something; could be on this plane..."

It's beyond Oswen at this point! She doesn't understand what's being suggested. But she trusts.

Then Zorhanna says, "But you do have a point - I hadn't considered that possibility..." - she smiles - "...that rift! That rift down there; that *is* another dimension. You didn't have the Shard with you when you came to rescue me?" "No, it was in the Portable Hole" "Well this might go catastrophically wrong; I would have to set up wards; we could try throwing the Shard Solitaire into the rift."

Shrug. Sure. Worth a try.

Zorhanna starts checking her spell book to try and see how she might contain any explosions or other issues. "But how do we get it through that hole?"

First thing, we try throwing it. If it needs more weight for speed, we could tie it to e.g. a rock or brick (!) but Oswen is worried about sending anything from *this* plane to that one. It might act as a focus for something to get back.

Zorhanna shows Oswen a spell. "Do you understand this?" - it's L4, Gate Seal. Yes. She doens't know it, but Oswen can read it. "Can you read quickly? Understand the principles?" Arcana check 23. No problem. We form a seal around the room, then throw the Shard.

Oswen says, "If this works, there's this guy from Oerth called Kaden. He's looking for love but wants it to be real, not a Fey charm. Please help if you can. And there's a thief called Eggsy, or Dworp. He needs thanking - he helped unwittingly, but helped all the same. And a journalist, Verano. He's from Oerth too. He wants some exciting story. Perhaps give him some kind of inside scoop? Is that OK?"

"Of course! But we can talk about this after!"

We get down to the basement. Usual guest pleasantries along the way! Oswen needs to expend her remaining spell, L4, to help with Magic Gate while Zorhanna spends own very last slot - L9! - each taking a minute, drawing in extra runes. The fabric of the plane itself is fortified within a 30ft cube. Open portals or planeshifts *should* fail at this point. Lasts for a full 24h, we believe. Once cast, the tear - whatever it is - is almost almost certainly going to be still open, but we think, stable, FSVO stable.

"Who has the best aim?!" asks Zorhanna. That'd be Inafina. The spell has a material component, a broken portal key and Zorhanna believes the Shard *is* that key. So, Inafina throws, we cast the last rune and that *should* do it.

Inafina ACRO with one last Bardic Inspiration. Nat 17 + 7, and 8 on the d8 bardic - a whopping 32!

It's perfect aim. We cast. The shard goes into the portal; the portal - almost in slow motion - seems to begin to explode; but then disappears into a point. There's a soft "pop" noise.

It's very anti-climatic! Oswen is a bit paranoid... She wants time to use ritual Detect Magic, just to be sure. "Well the spell lasts for 24h; that gives me enough time to come back after a rest and cast it again. And as long as I can cast it, it will last until dispelled. But I think the problem - if it *has* closed - should be solved. The Shard was the only way it was accessing this plane."

Oswen finishes the ritual as people wait, getting a bit bored (!) and sees - nothing. No tentacles, no veins, no pulsing. No cracks, no pinpricks, nothing. No trace. She's relieved, obviously! She tells everyone.

Sighs of relief all round.

Zorhanna says - "My goodness... Well, thank you... How - I'm sorry I never even asked - what are your names?!" - LOL - we introduce ourselves! "A *delight* to meet you! I can't express - and how - how did you get embroiled in all this?" - Fifel is mentioned, Eliphus, and so-on.

And so it goes on. We will eat! Zorhanna will let Anisetta know what's going on. We actually come out of the basement via the kitchen route, and Zorhanna tells the *true* story, leaving pretty much nothing out. All the time we're eating; we get to try even more food than before.

Eliphus has to interrupt - "We're coming up to the pinnacle of the ball! We have to name the king and queen!"

As they're heading out, we follow at a distance, but Oswen winks at Eliphus - "Told you'd get her!" - and just outside, we see Kaden! He's with a very beautiful, slightly elven-looking woman. Oswen moves into a corner and gets Kindle to rather awkwardly unfold the hole just enough to get the Helm out. She quicky tries Detect Thoughts. DC 13 and the woman rolls 12! She's giggling in her head, a bit; "he's so silly!" - seems a bit infatuated! She's also worried; "I wonder if this is a one night thing or if - I wonder what he wants?" Some worries about the aging difference, what his intentions are and so-on. Is he too good to be true?

We stow the helm. On our way past, Oswen looks at him and simply smiles; she doesn't know if he sees, but she's happy that he at least has a real chance; but then he waves at her and goes back to conversation.

Suddenly, it's time!

Zorhanna is on stage. The band has just finished and she thanks them. "The moment everyone's been waiting for! The King And Queen of the ball. Oren! Do you have the envelope?!" - and he heads up, to hand her one. The King of the ball is - someone is named. And the Queen - one of the big Goliaths.

"And now we are past solstice. The longest night is behind us, the days will lengthen, and although winter will be deep it will not be long. Soon spring will emerge again as we walk into the sun. I want to thank all of you again for coming tonight - but the party is not over!" (But when the dawn breaks, the bridge breaks; so everyone has to leave by then).



## Day 6, just after midnight

And so it goes on, a long night! This time we *all* get to enjoy the party.

Oswen does return to the goliaths, as promised. They talk about the legends of which _they_ are aware; they consider themselves to be giants, at least compared to other people (though they of course amongst themselves see their size as normal). They believe that their ancestors were much bigger, mastering methods of storm and rune travel. They say markings on their skin, some which are apparently natural, some tattoos, are leftovers of that time. Their ancestors were very good at understanding runes and eventually, as curious wanderers and explorers, found their way to other planes. Some never returned ("legend has it that they fell in love with locals there and started families of their own and, over the course of time, probably integrated in with societies elsewhere, probably passing down at least some of their powers over time") but as far as their own legends go, Prometiia is still their home. There are many of them still living in that domain.

After more chat and congratulating the new Queen Of The Ball, we continue with more dancing and fun. Over the few hours left, they meet and talk to people from various other planes - including a **Kender**, from the world of **Krynn**. He looks like a tall halfling - the frame of the halfling (dextrous and nimble), yet taller, but still shorter than a human. He has a long topknot, almond-shaped eyes and rather pointy ears - elements of elf. It's an interesting mix and while this is clearly someone from a very different plane, mannerisms unusual and with a singsong voice, mischievous; does magic tricks that aren't magic - Oswen isn't sure how they work!

Before we leave, Zorhanna chases down Oswen.

"Your command and mastery of the arcane is quite impressive young lady! Now... I am willing to bet that you would be interested in some things that I have in my study? I would love to thank you for what you have done." "Uuh - well, of course, thank you!"

Zorhanna says, "For your companions, is there anything that interests you in my art gallery?"

* Gauntlets of Ogre Power
* Figurine of the Serpentine Owl
* Bag Of Tricks
* Quiver of Elhonna

...at which point we return the fuzzy balls from the bag! Bel is rather drawn, instead, towards a particular painting. The one of the Prince Of Frost. He enquires politely; Zorhanna does not mind at all. "An excellent choice! You see, I have a particular relationship with the Prince Of Frost myself. Do you have a way of getting it home?" - yes, the portable hole! Inafina thinks riding a giant owl could be wonderful! We expect Kindle to go for the gauntlets, but instead, he says he really wants the Bag Of Tricks! No problem. Oswen certainly understands - it can give him a companion, a bit like Orvil. Oh! Orvil! He's still waiting by the (annoyed) mephit. He doesn't mind! He's had a good view of the ballroom and he's actually been enjoying harassing the mephits, trying to get them to break character. He's introduced to Zorhanna too.

Lastly, Zorhanna brings us up to the study. She grabs a couple of things. One is related to Scrying. She shows Oswen the scroll; Oswen does have one of those; but does she have the material components? No... So Zorhanna fetches the crystal ball that was near her desk! "I found this very useful in my younger days. A way of always... Knowing. If you're anything like me and you find it indespensable having more information and more knowledge and, well, just being able to make better decisions because you have more of the clues and pieces of every puzzle." She puts it into a purse, which seems to be a Bag of Holding - and the offers it to Oswen. "Oh! The purse too?" "Yes!"

Very gratefully accepted.

"I hope we keep in touch. If you ever need to speak to someone - if you have questions about the magical arts - I would like to think that you feel able and comfortable enough to contact me. Eliphus and I spend most of the year in our sanctum, on the Ethereal Plane. Have you heard of the Auroral Diamond?" "No" "Well, there are a few ways to get there! When you're ready let me know. I can arrange for you to visit us at the Auroral Diamond. It is a wondrous place. In Common, the closest translation would perhaps be **The Radiant Citadel**. It shines like a beacon in the Ethereal."

"Well, if I ever figure any of that out, I'll come find you" replies Oswen. "And thank you, again. I think we should probably get over the bridge!"

"Yes, not long until sunrise now. I'll come and see you off in the garden."

We all head out, ostensibly for Zorhanna to see all the guests away. "Thank you" she calls after us, "And have a good sleep!" as we cross the bridge.

And there we are, on the shores of Loch Wynnice. Now we know why we bought an extra night! We head to the room, get out of our costumes and - fast asleep.



### 12000 XP -> LEVEL 8 (and we now activate Planescape content)

(Oswen's HP score D6 roll is 1, rerolled, 1 again. Rats.)

Oswen and Inafina just bump ability scores by 2, to reach 20 on INT and DEX respectively. Oswen realises she understands and can learn the Gate Seal spell that Zorhanna had cast, as well as realising she can learn the Lightning Bolt spell too. She shuffles some things around in the spell book - Comprehend Languages can be cast quickly once a day via her spell book, else could be left as a ritual only; she doesn't need to remember it all the time; so, she can have Lightning Bolt prepared, also reads up and prepares Sending, then as a precaution, also prepares Banishment - we've encountered a lot of extra-planar nonsense lately, and if it's good enough for a Simulacrum of Zorhanna, it's good enough for her!

### 8am

Dawn was close to 8am, given it was the shortest day. We get up around 2pm, after 6 hours of rest; check out (the inn very fortunately unfazed by the late hour for this, though Bel had prepared a list of excuses in a spike of anxiety upon awakening and realising the time!); then hang out in town doing brunch with, apparently, lots of other slightly ragged partygoers.

It's cold but sunny so we dress warm and have hot chocolate and warm bread sticks by the lakeside. As we amble along the waterfront, we are keeping an eye out for Kaden, Verano or Eggsy. Inafina's ears do a good job (perception 14+6->20); Kaden and his girlfriend are there, looking very close; looking at trinkets in the market, with a bouquet of flowers that it seems Kaden bought. His girlfriend waves us over - "How was your night? We left quiet early!" - we say (honestly) that we had a very good time. The larger group of us end up sat on a low wall, looking at the lake and chatting idly.

Verano finds us before we find him. He runs up to us, excited! "Did you hear that the Tiefling you told me about - I think they caught her or something? She was nowhere to be seen! One minute she was there, next minute she was gone!" and Oswen says, "Yes, we achieved what we needed to and I'm sure you noticed how much happier Zorhanna seemed after all that trouble. I hope Adira wasn't caught, to be honest; she was helping us and it would see unjust if she didn't get to go free."

Verano leans in - "I think you had something to do with this!" - flips through his notes. "Guess who had an exclusive interview with Zorhanna? That's right! It's me! Fascinating stuff about the history of Paliset Hall, how she came upon it, how it travels the planes and where it goes." Oswen says, "Well, you were helping us so we did put in a good word for you - I just hope you got something good for publishing?" "Well, it's not what I had in mind, but it's good. There's enough material here for several pieces; I could write a series! I even got fresh sketches of her!"

He's joining a carriage out of here soon. "I was hoping I'd bump into you before I went to say - well, y'know - really good meeting you. If you're ever passing by the Greyhawk Chronicle HQ, great coffee shop on the ground floor, look me up!" Oswen gives him a hug and says, "And if you're in the fey realms and can find us, you're always welcome." "You never know!" he says with a wink and heads off, waving.

Kaden and his new friend realise they need to get to the same carriage too. She seems happy to go and visit his plane; "it'll be fun! I'm up for an adventure!" - more waves, more departures.

Inafina says, "So what about us? Should we return to the keep? And I suppose you'll be wanting to get back to the cottage and Leonidas?" and Oswen says "Well, yes, I suppose we shouldn't leave it *too* long as the time difference will be drifting again now as the planes separate. I'm not too sure how to get back to that plane anyway! Remember that Alagarthas didn't know the key for the circle to get back?"

Bel says we could find a carriage leaving for a town on Torril that depart from here. But we might end up a *long* way from home! We go and see what carriages we can at least find, and see if we recognise any town names.

We ask around. Oswen, investigation only 13; several that have names she just doesn't recognise; could we ask someone we *know* is from Torril. Eggsy might know but we haven't found him. So *now* we ask for Egg - uh - Dworp! Investigation 21. He's in the tavern. Ah! Easy. Off we go.

There he is, as Dworp! He catches Oswen's eye as we come in. He's sat at the bar, not talking to anyone, but he has a good meal and a mug of ale. Oswen goes over and hops onto a bar stool next to him. "Ah! How was your night?" and Oswen says, "Thanks to you, successful." "Are you having a drink?" "I might, but first, I thought we should discuss reciprocation!" "I would like to buy you a drink!" "Well OK then, thank you." He orders another drink; raises his mug, so she copies to toast; "Well played" he says. "You played me but played me well! I don't hold it against you at all. Things worked out just fine in the end." "Huh?" "Lady Zorhanna pulled me aside because she did figure out what I was doing, and she was very good natured about it! She gave me this..." - he opens a small bag that has some nice jewellery and some gems in it - "...in exchange for leaving the rest of the guests alone! The easiest thing I've had to do."

Oswen gives him the short version of what *really* happened that night.

Then he says, "I haven't been entirely honest with you either..." - he pulls out a golden key. "I wasn't here to pick *anybody's* pockets. I was here for a specific item from a specific person. And let's just say, while nobody else was looking, I got the thing I needed. Now *you* were pretty much on the same mission. I'm very impressed by your skills. How would you like to see more of the universe? Of the *multiverse*?"

There's a twinkle in his eye.

"I feel like I know you a bit more now. You've no problem meddling in affairs to achieve some greater good, and don't have an aversion about bending the rules a bit to get things done. What do you think about that?"

The two of us are facing the bar, all conspiratorial-like. So Oswen nearly jumps out of her skin when she's about to answer, when Inafina's voice from right behind her says, "Yes, she *does* like breaking the rules doesn't she!" in a disapproving tone. The whole party is of course there. Conferring isn't needed there; Bel is keen; Inafina and Kindle think of it as being like when they were with the carnival. But Oswen is worried about Leonidas; however Eggsy explains - "Oh you're not travelling it *now*, it's not a job *now*; you'd be part of a network - called upon now and then, on a job by job basis."

Oswen says, "Well, it seems the travel appeals to us; but the job would have to be someone who needed help, or something bad that needed fixing. We won't do anything the other way around!"

"That's exactly what we involve ourselves in. You're no stranger to powerful magic items; secrets; things that, should they fall into the wrong hands, could be quite catastrophic! Our job is to keep them out of those hands."

(Inafina whispers something to Kindle about how Eggsy is behaving. They study him... Kindle ADV insight, a very solid 25. This is the *real* Eggsy, way sharper than we thought, not playing a character. There's some trepidation but only because he's not 100% sure if we'll go for it).

So Kindle nods at Inafina. Inafina nods at Bel. Bel nods at Orvil who looks surprised; then Orvil nods as Oswen.

"Deal!" says Oswen.

Eggsy pulls out a golden pocket watch on a golden chain from his pocket and hands it to her. "This way, we can contact you and send you information if need be. If you haven't yet figured it out, we are..." - and he taps the gold key on the face of the watch, which has a gold keyhole motif.

Oswen looks at him quizzically. "Uuuh - Golden Key?!"

Eggsy says, "Oh. I knew it! We need to get that changed... Vault. It's the Golden Vault."

Oswen says, "Right. And the Golden Vault is - ...?"

Eggsy looks deflated. He whispers, "It's the organisation I'm talking about! We are all over the multiverse and because of what we do, where we find and secure powerful items to keep them away from bad people, well, that's why the name. When we contact you - we'll know where you are as long as you have this watch - you'll be sent one of these" - he waves the key - "and you just put it into the keyhole in the watch and turn it" (and Oswen realises it's more than just a motif - must be magical).

Then Bel remembers - "Oh! Do you know which of the carriages out there goes to Torril?!"

He does; it goes to the town over the mountain pass, and then from there we'd have to figure out how to get to our own city. "Or you could come with me if you wish? When I get to the other side I will travel on to the city in which I live." "Where's that?" "Baldur's Gate." But Oswen thinks that's a long way away and in the wrong direction. Workable, but far from ideal!

* We could go with a carriage and then figure it out in Torril
* We could see if Zorhanna or Zybilna might now the magic mushroom circle path, but that only gets us to the Misty Forest, also a fair distance away
* We could return to our keep and try to figure it out ourselves, but Planeshift is far above Oswen's abilities right now
* We could see if Zorhanna or Zybilna might be able to assist with connecting the keep to the material plane, but *we* will owe *them* if they do so.

Oswen shows Eggsy the scissors of shadow snipping. "I don't know if Baldur's Gate is any safer than us carrying these around" says Oswen, "but we certainly don't want to use them and don't have a way of destroying them yet."

"Then my suggestion is you keep those safe until you get a direct contact from a Handler who has a safe way of getting it from you."

"OK, thanks! Well - I guess we'd better go..."

We haven't made our minds up. Zybilna is interesting but really she's quite distant and formidable, and our debts both ways are settled. Oswen doesn't want to put upon Zorhanna so soon, but figures - well we might have time before the carriage goes... And since she realises she understands how to do this now, she uses Sending. "Lady Zorhanna, apologies to intrude, I wondered if we might meet to enquire about how my party might return swiftly to Torril?" (or thereabouts, to meet 25 words). The reply is swift. "Alright. I am curious. We are still at the house."

So, farewells all done, we go to try and find a boat. The harbourmaster is unconvinced by Bel's pleas (persuasion 5+7, 12). We ask if we might be permitted to *hire* someone, paid passage; but the boats are all busy. They can take us that way, but can't necessarily take us back. That's a start; we offer to pay but if we do the rowing, it's free! Kindle - you're up. Off we go!

Boats are following a careful route as the mist has begun rolling back in, the solstice now passed. We do feel the distance between planes; it's quite unsettling; no wonder the carriages want to leave soon. Kindle does his best to row quickly! More boats now are heading back to town, fully laden, than heading out.

The dock is piled high with crates waiting to be loaded, or in the process of being so. "I hope you know what you're doing - you don't want to get stuck out here!" says our boat owner and we hasten to the Hall.

It's a hive of activity there, inevitably, but a surprising amount is already done. It seems like the poor staff might not have even slept! Many decorations are already gone. Oren is running around all over the place, and Nix has list of things to check as she'll be looking after the Hall for the rest of the year. Nix waves and asks why we're here; we mention seeing Zorhanna; main hall, we're told. Zorhanna is there, helping coordinate and spotting things that need fixing up ready for next year.

Oswen sees she's rested. She looks much more healthy! Normal clothes, FSVO "normal" in Zorhanna's case. There are a couple of cases by the door with a heavy coat draped over - probably her clothing.

The TL;DR to "connect" our Keep to the Material Plane is to find fey crossings in our existing realm first, which won't be easy; find where they're presently keyed to then find a way to transfer those connections. "A lot of it has to do with things of sentimental and emotional value" says Zorhanna. **"You must imbue wherever you want the other side of the crossing to open, with something of great sentimental value. Then, the first time that you enter, whatever it is that you are doing becomes the entry key."**

Detect Magic can help us find openings. Legend Lore is then very useful for finding keys. Local denizens might know, too. We have to go through, find out where it goes, then untether it from that location; an "unassigned" fey crossing. To do it, you must find what anchors it to that side. Remove - well, basically, destroy - that thing. But obviously, we must use the crossing to get home first. If it's an object that can be moved, well, bring it with you - and possibly even use it to relocate the other end rather than destroying and replacing the object. If it's e.g. a mushroom circle then it can't be moved, and if we destroyed it, then "that end" of the path would close and we'd have to find another way "back home" to the other end that we first found.

Seems like a decent idea, if nothing else, to go hunting for fey crossings from our new little realm. "They tend to be in places where imagination and emotion, if nothing else, are in steady supply. Shadowfell crossings are the opposite! Hope is lowest, and so-on."

We thank her once again and figure we'd better get back to the mainland. She does ask if we have a teleportation circle sequence, but the only one we have is for the Palace Of Hearts Desire. It's an interesting point that having one in our own Keep would one day be useful.

The usual thanks and pleasantries... ...Back at the dock we work out how to fly back. The boats are all full. Bel can cast Fly Kindle, who can then carry Oswen. Inafina has her boots and Bel would be out of luck, except for the newly-acquired giant owl figurine. Bel gets to travel in style, on the back of a giant owl!

Once over, we quickly head to the magic shop and just ask - just in case - if there's a Legend Lore scroll. She smiles - "Ah, that would be amazing! Unfortunately it is an extremely rare spell. I don't usually get involved with things quite that rare!" and Oswen says, "No problem - if it's that rare, we probably couldn't have afforded it anyway."

We're not really in a rush; we're staying in the Fey Wild, heading back to our keep. It's a risk but we figure we'll try it. We get onto the road. It takes only an hour in this direction to get to the "off-ramp" to our keep! Fey travel times really are strange. The Queen's Highway is very unusual; we know the direction we want to get but nothing seems all that far. It's not really a physical road system, but for its appearance. It just seems to be a way of connecting points together.

It's strange being at the keep. Feels a bit like home to return here after an adventure. Bel decides there's a room that's the Gallery and puts the Prince Of Frost picture up there. The rest of the room is empty, but it'll fill out! There are lots of rooms which are empty, we notice. We didn't think too hard about furniture when the keep first formed! We can always add some later.

Our giant owl is still around and suddenly telepathically alerts Inafina to someone on the grounds outside.

D8->6. We head outside and there, just sort of hanging around, is a giant badger! Oswen tries, "Hello, do you speak?!" in Sylvan. It stands up! "Yes. Is this your keep?" "Yes!" "I stumbled into this area. It feels nice but it is very empty." Oswen says, "Well, you are most welcome to make a home here." "It is quite empty. Did you want that?" "What did you have in mind?" "There are often fey denizens - animals - wandering around and if they stumble across something empty they usually leave it alone. But I was curious; this has a smell of new, and also a smell of home and kindness! I thought you didn't want it to be empty?" Oswen looks to Bel, who understands, and we say, "Well, lively is better than empty." "Can I come in?" he asks, at the keep doorway. "Sure!" - he scrapes his paws to clean them and shakes himself to get rid of dust (!) then walks inside.

He introduces himself. His name is **Froderick**. "But you can call me Froddy"; we introduce ourselves too - "did you want a room, or - ..." "Oh no! I was just wondering. I'm happy outside. Maybe I'm being presumptuous?" but we're fine with it and recommend the tower for a great view!

He also asks if we want someone to look after the tower. He even has a resume, scratched in Sylvan on bark! Oswen reads it, says, "It looks like you're well qualified! We should discuss salary, or other compensation, then."

"A roof over my head and use of the keep and stuff like that? That would be good. And - an allowance for the keep, if you intended to have a staff? Depending on what people need? My favourite of *all time* if you *are* talking payment would be Blackberries!"

Bel and Oswen simultaneously say, "Deal!"

(Inafina hasn't understood the language, but has had a lot of time therefore to look at body language and intonation. Insight 26. There's a lot to this guy - very street savvy. Canny. Not malicious or evil. This is someone who takes advantage of luck and opportunity. He knows how to look after himself. He has some old scars, too. This isn't a young badger.)

Inafina asks, "Do you speak Common?" He looks over. "I know a little bit." She says, "Well, I think my two friends have welcomed you to stay. That is fine for us too. I realise you make the best of opportunities when they arise. Please do just bear in mind that we value in both directions openness and honesty and Fey rules, the principles of the Fey, very much do apply here."

We discuss what might be needed as an initial allowance or float. But as we look at our gold, he reminds us that gold has no currency for the creatures of the Fey. They'd need - trinkets, or something... Objects, items, things they might treasure. "What would be most helpful is if we can grow things here." He's warming up in Common now, so Kindle overhears. "A productive garden would be most welcome, we would love that."

We learn that he was once a guard of a pumpkin carriage, and is good in a fight. He claims to be a good gardener too! So we let him know that he can do whatever he wants with the grounds.

Now we need to find the portal. Froddy can help! He can sniff things out. ADV investigation, Oswen, 27 with Froddy's help; and Bel helping Inafina looking principally for circles, perception 23 - the two of them wander into the woods, doing a sort of perimeter search first; while Oswen and Froddy wander in all sorts of places as Froddy follows his nose.

Bel and Inafina certainly find unusual things.

* A tree we don't think we "created" in thought. It's very large and exotic, fruiting, producing mangoes (which are new to us). Around the base of the tree, looking up at the mangoes and talking amongst themselves, are a small group of six Campestri. Bel sings them a welcome song. Their eyes widen and they start dancing around Bel, then start singing a copy of the song. Then they cluster around Inafina and Bel, all talking at once.

* Inafina dirty 20 on ADV perception (because it's hearing). Amongst the 6 songs, one is particular interesting; they are young Campestri who have set out on a mission to find their own place. They've outgrown their parents' circle. Bel speaks in Sylvan to say that this is a new realm, this tree is unfamiliar to us but quite wonderful, and they ask if the fruit is delicious (in song) so Inafina climbs (ATHL 15), picks one and hand one down. It has a skin so she tries to peel it, a bit like an orange. It's messy but juice drips off and the Campestri get very excited by the smell of it. It is declared delicious! So, would they like to stay here? It turns out that they are now self-declared Guardians Of This Tree. The Mango Knights. "So it is! Thank you guardians!"

* We ask if they've seen any other mushroom circles in this new realm. It's quite bare at the moment but they offer to head out and search. They ask where they might find us; we point to the Keep.

It looks like in due course this might be a Campestri-heavy realm! At least the mango tree is quite far from the keep, so there won't be a noise problem with all the singing.

Meanwhile, Frodrick and Oswen have found a few interesting places but nothing too specific. Then they end up at the top, on the ledge by the old hawthorn tree. It grows on a mossy collection of boulders that form the top of the ledge. Underneath the ledge, accessible from the boulders, is the small spring that eventually leads to the waterfall. Froderick is *certain* there's something happening here - where else is the water coming from? So Oswen uses Detect Magic and, indeed, it's a portal. But it feels like you have to **dive into the spring** to get through. Dry travel is not an option!

Later we regroup and exchange stories. The Campestri may well come through. The spring is an option but risky because we'd all go through with no idea where we're emerging. We'd need to make sure we were careful to remember our actions as those would become the key as we're sure (Arcana only 19, but it's enough) that "this end" of these crossings is new and un-keyed.

Froderick has foraged some stuff and has a jar of honey he shares as him and Kindle start to cook; we also have the jar of mead. Then there are many small knocks on the door. The Campestri. They don't want to come inside; but beckon us to follow. That's for Bel and Inafina, but Kindle says Oswen should go too as she's not that useful for cooking!

We reach a part of the woods with a small clearing and a soft, glowing, pulsing, blue-ish ring of tiny baby mushrooms. Detect Magic to confirm; definitely a new mushroom ring forming!

D8->8. We notice a giant elk is watching nearby! Oswen calls over, "Welcome to this new realm!" It doesn't speak but comes over, curious, inquisitive, sniffing, as if wanting food. But it's huge! It's much taller than Bel even to its shoulder - must be some 8ft - and dwarfs Oswen entirely. Quite intimidating, yet seems gentle enough for now. It examines the circle. Then looks at us. Bel pulls out his lute and uses it to cast Speak With Animals. "How can we help you, Master Elk?" "I have wandered into the area. I don't remember a forest here but these are very good trees." "This is a new realm. I'm glad you like the trees. You are welcome to stay in this forest if you like it." "You would let me make my home in these woods?" "Currently we believe mostly empty, so yes, more lively woods is a good thing in the Fey Wild." It likes to eat bark and moss and fallen fruit and grass. Bel asks if the Campestri would allow the elk to have fruit from the mango tree sometimes. They huddle. Now and again one looks up at the elk or Bel! After a while - yes, it can have *some*. Bel lets it know where the tree is. In return they expect the elk to defend the realm! The elk agrees.

It wonders why we're all here. We explain that the circles take one to another realm, but returning could be hard. Avoiding new circles such as this would be a good idea.

We head back as it's likely dinner time! The elk says it'll hang around and make sure nobody stumbles through the circle. He's happy to sleep there. It's as good a place as any - plenty around to eat. The Campestri sing a good night song and set up a perimeter around the mango tree.

Conferring over dinner, we decide that in the morning we'll risk the forest circle. The water one seems hazardous, especially if coming through the other way - it's on a ledge and hard to reach - even though it's a bit closer to the Keep.

At one point mid-conversation, the owl hoots, flaps, and vanishes. "Until next time, Mrs Owl!" says Inafina, heading over to pick up the serpentine figurine that's landed on the floor.

Before bed, Froderick is struck with a thought - "But what is this Keep called?!" he asks. We confer. "Roslof's Eight", was our group name by accident, but we don't have to name everything after Professor Roslov! The Keep is on a hill; "**Balloon Downs**" he says, as a pun! The Keep is on a Down and we met when his balloon came down. He also suggests something after the carnival, but his first name has meaning to fall four of us.



## Day 7

In the morning we discover that Froderick has made tiny sandwiches for us from bread he found that Kindle had but was getting a little old - very kind! - and will start on a winter garden. We give Froderick a couple of keys for the main door, lock up and we *all* head back to the new mushroom circle. The mushrooms have already grown. "This is it then", says Oswen, "We'll risk it! So, Froderick - I don't know when we're back - it could be a while - but you have our promise that you will all be recompensed appropriately for whatever you and anyone else you decide to bring on does, by the time we next arrive."

"I look forward to surprising you!"

The Campestri appear, apparently having noticed us walking this way. They're singing.

Kindle says, "well, what key are we going to make?" Bel listens to the Campestri song. "How about we sing that, then step through?"

**"What are they doing? What are they going to do?" is repeated in a refrain.**

So, we start to basically chant that, and walk through.

### Torril, somewhere

D100 -> 70. We are in woods, perhaps unsurprisingly. It is unusual though. A mixture of tall trees with no leaves, that look dead rather than wintry, and shorter trees and shrubs that are very much alive. A handful of mid-sized trees form a low canopy but there are lots of shafts of light, but pre-dawn light, that break through. We're standing in a small mushroom circle here. A large log, almost 3ft in diameter, lies nearby. It does not look cut; looks like it fell naturally together with a few other trees. Our guess is a forest fire, then, and looking closer, we see charring.

Oswen and Bel look to get a sense of where we are (dirty 20 on Survival) while Inafina climbs a tree (nat 20 perception for 26). She calls down - "We're sort of in a forest, pretty big, but we're close to the edge? A pretty big area was burned. I can see water... Off where the sun is just about rising. The woods end that way" - she points - "a distance. It's older in the other direction."

Meanwhile, Bel and Oswen are hearing this, also searching for tracks, going in other directions. There are some unusual ones, they follow them independently, but both end up meeting each other! Two pairs of tracks, one set of which changed part-way. Then it continues. So it's a sort of transformation/polymorph/werething/whatever-vibe.

Inafina starts to climb back down - but then, DEX save 26! - as she hears a 'fluttering' noise of something flying through the air. She swings around the tree and uses the trunk as protection; an arrow thunks into the tree. She calls down, "Hey, we're being attacked?!" - and drops, falling to the ground, using her Slow Fall reaction for a perfect landing. She shouts out loudly, in Elven, "If you're elves, we're on your side! We just came from the Fey Wild through the mushroom circle right here!"

Oswen and Bel have heard this and are running back. Kindle immediately activates Twilight Sanctuary; the forest dims. We regroup and stand looking.

Walking out of the shadows appears a grand stag with an elf riding on its back, then another on foot. It might be to their surprise that the four of us relax at this and Inafina says, "Right, yes, elves, sorry if we startled you!"

"Speak your purpose! Why have you wandered off the permitted roads?"

We explain about the Fey circle. "You are intruding upon the ancestral lands of Elfhome". "Oh. I'm so sorry. Can you escort us to a permitted location?" (Clearly this circle is *not* going to be one we use to get back with). "This circle here *is* connected to our domain, but to use it, we'd have to intrude again."

"Concerning. If what you say is true, there are things we must discuss. This portal of which you speak is in our forest! We will escort you North, to Elven Court."

(Oswen, history 13, knows she's read that name and if so, it's probably not a huge distance away from home). We of course agree; we don't have much choice. We are led along various paths and unfortunately it's almost impossible to figure out where we're going.

Bel tries to talk with them as we go. He's clearly from the Fey, after all. He tries to learn about their concerns. It seems they're unhappy about Fey crossings opening into the regenerating forest of Elfhome. They weren't aware of these. Things have changed a lot, they say, in the years since the forest burned. Bel suggests that this can't be unique; a regenerating forest, many mushrooms, but a fire means old crossings were severed. We advise them to keep their eyes peeled for other circles - we are sure there must be many.

After walking some three hours - they apologise for the time taken, apparently it would usually be much less but old fey paths were destroyed in the fire - we reach older forest and now accelerate greatly through a fey path that brings us to Eleven Court. There is a certain tranquility here but it's apparently under a degree of repair; signs of things trampled some time ago and many damaged buildings. "What happened here?" "There was another war. And as with any war, the elves were at the front line, holding back the tides of darkness and protecting the younger races from the horrors of the greater world at large. Many were lost. But the front lines were North of here - not in the forest. We lost this place in the early part of the war, as a strategy, but that's beyond our understanding - things that were instructed by the Coronel. She is the wisest of us all."

Oswen says, "Well, then I suppose, on behalf of the 'younger races', we owe you thanks."

As we continue to walk, there's little talk thereafter; but this is, we learn quickly enough, Cormanthor. Oswen starts to get a strange prickly feeling in the back of her neck but can't figure out what that's about.

We are taken to some kind of Archdruid for this grove. There, our "guides" explain that they thought Inafina was a demon! Bel explains that we're just trying to get home. We've been in the Fey Wild - (at the front line, holding back the tides of darkness and protecting the older races from the horrors of the greater world at large) - he doesn't say that bit - but he does give the short version; that we saw Queen Titania, are technically knights; he shows the insignia; the Elves do recognise that sovereignty.

The druid asks to be shown the circle. No problem! A good three hours back where we came from though. The druid confers with the rangers then, "hold my hand" he says and walks towards a tree. We all go hand-in-hand "We can head there directly. Do not dally! Step through when I do" - and he opens a portal in the tree! We step through and emerge not far from the circle, in one of the few really large trees that still stand. He reacts at what he sees - shudders, looks uncomfortable, upset at the loss. But it's regenerating. This is the cycle of life.

Orvil helps Oswen locate the circle. It doesn't take long. We lead the druid there.

It is indeed new, forming around - something. We explain about the bidirectional nature and, perhaps then it is un-keyed at this end. Something of significance anchors it here. Emotional impact. "Give me a moment. I will have a look" - he turns into a mole!

A few minutes later the mole emerges. It drops something on the ground and turns back into a druid. On the ground is a beautiful looking, delicate chain, with a closed locket on it. He found it under the mushroom circle together with some bits of armour - and a dead body. Oswen carefully opens the locket. In it is a picture of a knight, a young woman and a baby. "Oh, dear... That's so awfully sad..." - the elves look, but it's not an elf. "Why is there a body here?" they ask. Oswen says, "But you said there was a war." "Yes, but it was a war which the elves fought. The other side were undead. This is neither undead nor an elf."

"Have we got a few minutes?" asks Oswen. There's some confusion but Oswen is sure this is the best place... Kindle knows the drill, pulls out a shallow pan from his backpack; incense is lit; a few seconds later she's cast divination.

"There is a woman and baby in this locked. We wish to know where to find the woman, so we can give this locket back."

Smoke swirls. A farm. South of the river, Sembia. With Orvil up high, Oswen thinks she might be able to recognise the house and the kind of field and tree; a small wooden windmill for moving water is nearby, so there's at least that as a landmark, but it won't be easy.

So, it was a Sembian knight. "Most curious! The Sembians do not deploy troops north of the river. This is vitally important information for us! We thank you for bringing this to our attention." "Our pleasure. And yes, we should now leave your forest and your home; we apologise again for the intrusion; perhaps if you could take us Southwards, towards this river? That's where we need to go for our home too."

The Druid can bring us South to the edge of the forest. "Follow me; whatever you do don't let go! Follow my lead! It will take several jumps - so to speak. Trust me!"

He heads to a tree and walks through; he appears in another tree, then another; we're holding hands in a chain and being pulled through. We're not sure what's going on as we have no time to waste between each tree. It's a constant jump from one to another. At one point Kindle hoists Oswen onto his back as she's just that bit slower than the druid and is struggling to keep up! After a minute this strange magic fades (Tree Stride).

We're not at the edge yet but the forest is thinning out. He points towards some kind of building we can just make out, a tower, that shows over the trees. "Head there, cross the bridge and get to the tower - it's actually on the other side of the river." "Thank you. I hope you have a safe journey back." **"If you are coming to our woods again, please announce yourselves..." - and teaches us a whistle, a short tune. "The animals know to recognise the whistle. It is a whistle of our allies."**

We part company and head directly in the direction indicated. It's tough going over broken trees and scrub and general mess. Eventually we reach the river. There's a road here, which so we speed up a lot. The prickle at the back of Oswen's neck gets stronger. Her hairs are standing on end... It *couldn't* be...

...We reach a small inn or tavern. Oswen, mouth agape, stops so suddenly that the others stumble on for a few steps before being able to stop as well. They turn to see her pointing, finger shaking, at the inn.

**"That's it. *This* is it. It was only, what, two or three years ago? It's *forever* ago. This is the place. This is where I got back. Those people - the people in that inn... They sent me on my way, helped me, got me to Ordulin."**

The party suggests going in. Oswen refuses... "I've know the way back here all this time, but I just - I don't know, it didn't feel right. I can't explain it. Like, I'm intruding? That the very brief chapter of their lives that involved me just for that very short time is long past? Maybe one day! But today, we have so much to do..." - Inafina tries to convince her but Oswen refuses. She knows she's kind of stalling, really, but it's a very strange mixture of emotions.

"**If I was going to see anyone from my past, I surely should've looked up my Dryad family in the Fey Wild first**. We got back there, but I didn't even try - I didn't really know where to start, and then we were swept up in all the strange goings-on. I'm sure Zybilna would've helped. Maybe Zorhanna. It just feels like something more urgent is afoot and, besides, I'm trying to deal with enough emotion as it is with all these new homes, with Leonidas, how our adventures fit around that, with how we move between these realms quite easily now... I promise, I'll get to it, just once I've managed to wrap my head around what we might even say. We have another emotionally difficult thing to do now, anyway - with this locket."

There are a few buildings on this side of the river, it feeling more like an outpost than a village. We cross over the bridge. On the South side it's a full village. There's a small church and a watchtower - the latter is what we saw from further away - which has a gatehouse below. Some 12 buildings, another inn or tavern, stables and a supply market.

Oswen heads towards the supply shop, which is open and goes inside. It's still quite early in the day surprisingly, before midday we think. We go to the shopkeeper and show them (with due warning of the sad conditions) the locket. She looks; calls to her husband; they're not sure. "It does seem familiar... I just can't quite put my finger on it..." Oswen describes the divination vision of the farm as best she can. "Monty's farm! A red tile roof?" "Well there was no colour... But tiles, yes, I think?" "But Monty never went to war. He was never a knight! And he has no kids." How strange. We thank them; we'll certainly go there to ask.

The offer to help us go quicker with horse hire, if we bring them back this evening. We do have to come back this way so for 4 x 2sp, we travel by horse for a change. It's a new sensation for us - we usually walk! It only takes an hour or so at steady trot, with Orvil keeping an eye ahead and he spots the farm in the distance soon enough. We get there and Oswen is sure it's the right place. Smoke comes out of the chimney. There's a gate and fence so we tie up the horses there and walk up the path.

A face pops into a window. It's an older human woman, maybe in her 50s-60s, at the kitchen area. She wipes the window and looks again! Oswen waves, she waves back confused... Then dries her hands and shortly after the farmhouse door opens. She stands there in an apron, towel over her shoulder, hair pulled back.

We explain about the locket and show it her. No recollection. "Monty might know" she says, but he's out - should be coming home for lunch any time soon. She doesn't have spare food but there's a warm fire; we're invited in. She calls inside. "Louise, we have some guests? Carnival folk I think? They're waiting for Monty!" and a very old crackly voice says "Oh, I see, how nice!" - a very old lady is in a reclining chair, darning a sock. She looks at us, surprised! Asks why we want to see her son; we explain about the locket. She has a look as we hear a horse clopping outside - Monty we presume - but she just stops; freezes; her glasses fog; her expression changes; the locket falls out of her hand! She grabs the chain just before it hits the ground.

"...What? What? What is the meaning of this?!" - she tries to get up. "Why do you have this?!" - Oswen is a little alarmed, "I'm so sorry" (as Monty comes in, confusing things even more) - she points at the group - "These people have your father's locket!" - she holds it up. We try to explain but she then insists we're grave robbers! "They took this from his grave in the church!"

Bel with help from younger woman and Monty manage to calm her down (Persuasion 27) but she doesn't really believe us.

Monty takes us to the kitchen as she's attended to by the younger woman, and explains that his father was a knight who died in battle and considered a hero of the realm. But his grave was desecrated about two and a half years ago - him and many other heroes were exhumed from the church's cemetery. "My mother hasn't been herself since. We used to visit his grave every weekend. She hasn't been able to do that since. I must ask - how *really* did you come across this locket?"

We try to explain. And a penny drops in Oswen's head as she tells the story. A grave robbed; elves said they were fighting undead; oh, oh dear. She tries to explain that but Monty insists that he was a very devout man and would never have aided the forces of evil. The weak best Oswen can manage is to suggest he was on the Elves' side! The younger woman starts making tea - really she wants something to do - as we say that, well, we could retrieve the rest of the armour. Or they could bury the locket perhaps, in the old grave?

Monty talks to Louise. Later she comes over apologetically (not that she needs to be!) and they will, in fact, take the locket to the church to bury it. "I've seen it in my dreams so many nights" he says. "It has haunted my memories; the very last painting of our family that exists. It is the only thing that I have to remember him by." "Perhaps the church might have a space you could use as more of a shrine, then, than burying, so that the picture remains visible to you." Louise thinks about it; "I will speak to them. It is maybe a bit selfish of us to keep an empty plot in the cemetery!"

Oswen later says, "You don't know us and you have no reasons to trust us. Just know that we ask for nothing in return; no thanks, no gifts, we just wanted to return it because it seemed important."

Curiously, in her cup of tea, Inafina notices a small white flower has bloomed! Oswen looks at it - Arcana 26 - "it just grew right now!" says Inafina. It has a weak magical essence. Perhaps this is a new circle starting to form around the locket. Whatever was anchored there might have been released? Something resolved? We take the flower, very carefully. Kindle looks after it.

Tea is drunk; goodbyes are said; we head off. Louise seems more peaceful. Perhaps we did good here.

We take the horses back. Bel says, "Well, that was super weird!" and Oswen agrees - **"If we remember and if we have time, we really need to find out more about that war."**



### 2pm

This is an interesting little town we're in. The church has incense; they have about 125gp of it, but Oswen doesn't want to leave others without. She figures it's important to top back up to 4 casting's worth, so we pay 75gp. Next up, the supply shop; it's quiet inside. A cart is being unloaded by the cart owner and shopkeeper, who then comes over to attend to us. They're a grocer with lots of fresh food, but we know that would go off; they do have a section with nuts, preserves, dried cured meats and so-on. Kindle selects an assortment worth about 7 rations for one person, to bring Oswen's total to 14 (3.5gp). He gets some fresh food too, for the near future (0.5gp).

(We don't need rope. Oswen swapped in Mending from Prestidigitation to rejoin the rope, before swapping back tomorrow).

The shopkeeper asks where we're headed - Ordulin. "Well you won't need this, surely? It's a beautiful city; doesn't take that long to get there. You can probably catch a ride with carriages." The cart owner weighs in, suggesting we try at the tavern. He's staying the night but we figure, sooner the better. We thank them and head to the tavern (late lunch, if nothing else!) to ask.

It's quiet in the tavern too, kind of sleepy, but smells wonderful - good cooking, woodsmoke and malty beer. First up we ask the barkeep if there are carriages headed to Ordulin, and he points at a person at a table. To be polite we order 4 ales for us and 1 for the person we want to sweet-talk! He's amenable; "There's room for maybe the three of you, but not..." and trails off, looking at Kindle. "You, sir, will probably need to ride on one of my mules." Kindle isn't sure that a mule would be too happy about that! There are two mules and driver sits up front, so they could take it in turns or both ride the mules - with all our kit in the Portable Hole - leaving room just about for Oswen and Kindle in the carriage. Kindle has experience with wagons too, so the driver suggests they could take turns to drive. Sure!

He's heading off soon. We ask about the cost of passage, but if we help driving, he's happy; he would like happy loading and unloading goods too, which of course we can do. This also means he doesn't have to stop and can get to town more quickly. He's keen to get back.

It's agreed! We all finish drinks and head with him to his carriage, in a warehouse on the edge of the small town. We spend a while loading crates of fresh food and barrels of fish. As we're doing this, and Kindle's about to start moving our heavy gear into the Portable Hole, Bel realises we could just move the crates into that instead. It'll take enough that we have room for Oswen, Inafina and Bel inside the carriage, Kindle up front, and it'll be all-round a lighter load for the mules.

### 2:45pm - the road to Ordulin

We're off, across rolling fields. Weather patterns are rolling in from the sea to the East; storm clouds, building over the sea. Where we are is clear, but the sun dips low to the West quickly in these winter months. We do note that the sun doesn't set as early as it did at Loch Wynnice.

There is the usual smalltalk with our new companion, the carriage driver. It's been, he tells us, a quiet winter. Trade has been alright but not great. Things are settled. On the mention of that, we ask about the war; it was a while ago, but he says it was just a couple of weeks or so, when people weren't allowed to move freely. Cities were kind of locked down. The whole village we were at was evacuated - lots of rumours; news of Cormyr marching, but Sembia not; much conjecture and confusion. "It's best not to get involved! These things don't concern us 'small' folk!"

As talk moves to politics, Bel is in his element, and the two converse at length.

The sun sets and the sky turns deep blue. The carriage lights are lit, Kindle can cast Light to help and Oswen throws the Driftglobe to trail behind them, to make sure nobody creeps up that way! Even on safe roads such as this, it pays to be a little cautious after dark. Bel starts to play soft music on his lute, and people sing. It's all-in-all quite beautiful.

Eventually, we reach a roadside inn for the night. We've made good progress and expect to reach Ordulin tomorrow evening. He would normally take 3 days, but with Kindle's help, thinks we can get there faster.



## Day 8

### Early start

We get on the road!

No encounters. The hours go past quickly. Another beautiful evening, no rain, more singing! Finally, in the distance, after we crest a roll in the landscape, we see Ordulin, its lights flickering. It looks amazing.

It's been a long day; we've stopped a few times, to help the mules avoid exhaustion. The sight of the lights buoys us - he decides to push on, as the animals can rest longer the next day. We're moving more slowly; we end up walking alongside, to make the carriage lighter.

### 10:30pm

It's peaceful. On the outskirts, guards patrol; some houses are turned in for the night; we get in deeper and reach the old gates and walls. Familiar territory. There's a warehouse here and we pull into it. We help unpack. Polite goodbyes; we continue in.

Our cottage is a good 2-3 hours out on the other side of town, so instead, we decide to drop in at the library. They'll be awake tho not open. Not long later, we're outside, headed to the quarters. She stops a minute in a sudden flash of memory and tells Inafina about that (pointing upwards) was the window she jumped out of when she gave the chase that caused her and Inafina to meet. The light is on in Leonidas' room; she decides to make him jump a bit! She uses Message - "Look out of the window!" is all the says. She hears confused thoughts in return, but then a familiar head pops out of the window; he looks down and we wave!

"Hold on!" - he disappears and we hear the sounds of feet running around. The courtyard gate opens a moment later, and he jumps out. Big hugs!

It's late but for some reason Leonidas suggests a bar. We're kind of exhausted but it still sounds nice. As for the night, Bel has walked past somewhere a few places and wondered often what it's like inside, so he has a plan. We get to the bar, to find out that almost a couple of weeks have passed. Solstice was 5 days ago here. The drift is nowhere near as bad it might have been; things worked as we hoped. Leonidas has a surprising amount of gossip for the short time!

Oswen loves hearing about it. But there's a niggling anxiety. It had been mentioned earlier that we were back because of Oswen's partner. Is this the only reason we're here? Is this a small world now for the other three?

### Almost midnight

Bel has headed off and then comes back - he's secured a room. But he's assumed Leonidas and Oswen would stay at his place, and only got a room for three! It's true, actually, and Oswen is surprised to find she is not at all embarrassed. She realises now how close-knit and comfortable she feels with them.

We head out. A very crisp evening! There are hugs again... Kindle rummages around in the portable hole, right there on the street, fussing over things he thinks Oswen might need. We realise we can shuffle a few things into her new, very decorative "satchel of holding". It can't fit a tent in the opening though!

We part company. Feels a bit strange. But then Leonidas holds her hand, and it feels good. They walk back, not really saying much, just liking the fact they're near each other. Bel and the others get settled in accommodation befitting Knights of the Winter Court! (Bel later says it was even better than he thought it was going to be... "**The Golden Wheat**". Well, it's not all about the name, I guess).

We'll meet back at a particular fountain place at 9am on the city's clocks tomorrow.

OVERNIGHT: Oswen, CHA save! 14+0. She's cuddled up in bed and sleeping - but then, in her dreams, she feels something strange. At the edge of consciousness. Very faint... But familiar. A familiar setting; a presence; a bit like how she'd felt at Paliset Hall - no, *not* at the hall. She felt it there first, the tentacles; the Far Realm entity. Well, that seems not good!

She wakes up. Leonidas is woken by her too and asks what's up. She can't really remember what it was apart from the feelings. "Just a dream? I think it was just a dream..." - but she's not so sure. Perhaps she's just processing what happened in that intense moment when she was in the Far Realm. Strange! She has a feeling of fear. She's afraid? No! *It* is afraid. Oh! Not just afraid. Desperation. The creature was trying to break free to *get away* from something. But as she understood it, the creature *was* the Far Realm. So that must be wrong.

That understanding is wrong!

The creature, whatever it was, is huge; so large that she mistook this - well, entity, not creature - as the whole realm. Perhaps an easy mistake given that the realm gave the impression of being "inside a giant brain". This creature wasn't trying to break through to Paliset Hall specifically. It was just using *anything* it could, just to get out.

As Leonidas is falling back asleep, she stays awake. She now recalls a sense of alarm and warning from the entity as they escaped. Not directed at their escape; not on its behalf; and when they were throwing the Shard Solitaire, a joint spell, it wasn't raging - it was more of a "Wait! Before you go, you must know!" - **a warning** - something felt, telepathic... What was it? What did it say?

**Great danger is coming. Great danger is coming for *everyone*. Run!**



## Day 9

Oswen and Leonidas have a lazy lie-in. That's easy for Oswen. She didn't sleep so well after the dream.

She thinks back again. Emotions she mistook at that moment for her own fear were fear for that entity - terror, in fact. And this is an entity of great power which Zorhanna was *definitely* evil. What could have been so bad that for a moment, it felt everyone was equal?

Leonidas can see she's distracted. "Whatever it is, you don't need to explain. Just know I'm here for you."

She looks at him and says something she rarely says so bluntly: "I love you. And I'm glad you're here."

"...I love you too? Of course?" - but he's clearly concerned.

"I won't lie" says says, "that dream, I thought on it, and I realised there were things that happened at that gala that I missed. And I've only now had the chance to think on them, and there's something quite alarming in there. But I don't *know*. I could be wrong. It could be a trick. It could just be memory playing up. I think we should talk the others, and I'll try not to be too alarmist. There's always *something* in this world, after all!"

She's about to say more - but her thoughts are interrupted by Message. "Oswen? Oswen? I don't know if this is how it works! We were thinking of breakfast? Bel suggests the restaurant at The Golden Wheat."

It's Kindle. She thinks back, "We'll be there as soon as we can."

Before they leave, she holds Leonidas' hand. "It might always be like this - if this isn't what you signed up for, I understand..." and explains what we didn't get to the previous night; the Golden Vault, and how it might always be moments of calm, punctuated by moments of existential terror!

We get to breakfast. Bel is in his element. He points out all the amazing things on offer! Oswen whispers to Leonidas - "For the sake of all Gods, don't look at the prices! You *do not* want to know!" - and Bel, of course, has splashed out and bought all of us a buffet.

It does bring up money. We have, of course, a lot. But we know now how little it is compared to the cost of magic items or even keep upkeep (having exchanged for trinkets!) - Kindle has an idea for something to do with the pumpkins at the cottage, so we'll head there later.

Leonidas isn't missing the breakfast for anything but then reveals that he's got lots of work and is an hour late! He'll head off, we'll do our thing and we'll reconvene later. (We really could do with those speaking stones that they had at Paliset Hall).

We part company. As we begin to head out for the cottage, Oswen suggests that maybe, if it wasn't just a Fey thing, we see if a magic shop has heard of those messaging stones. We pop into one at random as we pass by. The good news is that they have heard of them; but their versions of these stones only work once per day in each direcftion. They *do* have essentially have no range restriction but can't cross planes. At least "not reliably" says the shopkeeper, which is a bit confusing. And what's more, they have a pair! 250gp, we are told.

Oswen makes a bit of an attempt to be persuasive, just on her own as the magic user. And surprisingly, persuasion is nat 20 + 0! It seems the shop keeper is actually keen to sell... 210gp. Hmm. Suspicious. Inafina insight nat 10 (all seems legit), but Oswen history 15+5->20, thinking back to things said during the "sales pitch" and negotiation. Strange... These seem to be unscryable. Safe communication. You can message someone and "no-one will know" - the receiver gets the message in their mind and responds likewise. She suspects Ordulin authorities might not be too keen on those being widely available! "Deal!" says Oswen. "And we promise to use them responsibly!"

We get near the town gates on the road to the cottage. Bel is impatient! "We need to find a quicker way to get back and forth! We have a *domain* in the Fey Wild. We shouldn't be just *walking*!" But horses aren't that much quicker and besides, they need looking after and we are likely to be away for long periods of time. "What about summoning?" says Bel. "I'm sure it's possible but I don't know how to do it. We could ask at the magic shop again?! But we'd need something for all four of us... We need a druid!"

We consider flying options. Haste, Longstrider, Expeditious Retreat. A personal Skimmer, an enchanted carriage!

And in all that discussion, after a couple of hours, we're at the cottage. Before we get to Kindle's idea, Oswen remembers the small flower. It seems we must plant it? Oswen, Arcana 20+11 -> 31! We head to a part of the garden at the edge, where pumpkins aren't planted and trees grow. "I think we put this here and a mushroom circle might grow..." - so she "plants" the flower and we leave it there, hopeful!

Back to Kindle's idea. "OK Kindle! What's the story?"

Kindle calls for Squirrel. Squirrel has his key. Treats are given as payment. Inside the house, it's well kept. Squirrel has apparently been on maintenance duty, and very good at it, too! Oswen gets the fire going. Kindle potters around in the kitchen. He pulls out an old recipe book then fetches a bottle from the pantry with a cork stopper, retrieved from a crate of similar bottles. "Try this!" he says. It's pumpkin seed oil; Kindle made it in autumn, from the harvest.

"So - we sell this?" asks Oswen. "We could yes! I found it in this..." - and shows the old recipe book. He knows we're not the kind of people who can reliably run a market stall to sell pumpkins at just the right time, before they go bad. But we can sell bottles at kind of any time. He takes Oswen to a store shed at the side of the house. It's *full* of pumpkins! *This* is where the harvest went. "It seems we have work to do! We can turn these into oil, but what about the rest of the pumpkin?" "I thought I could turn that into something a lot smaller, for our travels. Pumpkin chips, maybe? You can bake them! It'd still be a lot, a fair amount of space, but they can fit in the Portable Hole. And they keep - we can sell them. There are other things in this book, too..."

We set to work. Oswen talks about the bad dream. Assuming it's false means we could miss something. So let's assume it's true. Bad portents! We know nothing of distance, what "something is coming" means in the Far Realm or across planes, *but we know some people who might!*

At Kindle's suggestion - since he was going to Baldur's Gate - Oswen casts Sending for Eggsy... "Long story but vast evil creature in Far Realm is terrified of even worse evil coming for everyone. Insists we must run. Need advice!"

No immediate reply. Oh. Either that's Not Good or he's not on the plane anymore. Oswen says, "We might just have to wait a while... Or we need to get ourselves to Baldur's Gate."

We get on with the labour. It's basically menial work and that's *wonderful*. Just such a simple peace of mind thing, after all the madness of the last few days. Lunch is of course pumpkins - a spiced soup this time - and then we carry on with the oil and chips. A big batch. Both, under Kindle's expert direction, turn out extremely well.

* Seeds hulled
* Dried in oven then roasted like coffee beans using a ceramic oven and separate fire - Roslov's done this before!
* Milled into a paste
* The oil is squeezed out
* We get a box of 12 bottles - not much for a lot of pumpkins, but that's seeds-to-oil for you (and Kindle had 12 already, but he keeps one from each batch)
* Kindle finds some tins in the shed and we get ten tins of pumpkin crisps, too, for sale; there are plenty left over for the Portable Hole

"Shall we head back before it gets dark?" asks Kindle. "Yes, we can catch up with Leonidas and see if there's any trading options - I suspect paperwork!" says Oswen.

Another two hours. Oswen talks to people at the market and high end grocery shops, to see if they'll take the items to sell for a percentage, so we don't need our own stall. With Bel's help, Oswen ADV perception and Guidance gets 18 persuasion. We find "**Danch And Granger**" (Mr Danch and Ms Granger), a more upmarket kind of "Made In Sembia" local-focused place near the city hall and market gardens area. They want to take the 22 bottles of pumpkin oil - Kindle used one of the other two to pour samples - and even take the crisps. It seems having no labels doesn't matter. They say they'll do that themselves so it's "on brand" and that's part of why we pay them.

This being Kindle's baby, he haggles for the percentage with a bit of help from Bel. ADV persuasion is a rather beautiful 16,20 `:-)` + 2 -> 22. They'll take it all and pay us 50gp. This seems like a solid deal for Kindle's work for a day, and the four of us for another, given this is Ordulin and not a treasure room - 10gp each a day is an unheard of as a wage in most professions. We're encouraged to check back soon and if things go well they'd love to place another order.

We leave, feeling very happy.

### 6pm

It's dark when we get to the library, just after closing time. This time, the usual crew are all there and it's great to catch up with everyone. And then it's time for a thing Leonidas wanted to do - **Councillor Perdue** is giving a speech and locals are invited. He's just been named Third Speaker. Oswen figures that keeping up with local events is worthwhile given we have the cottage and, now, even a brand new trading business.

The city hall is surprisingly busy - there's even a queue. Once inside the main hall, we see a surprising diversity of ages. Someone comes on stage, goes through some general bookkeeping stuff, then announces Speaker Perdue. On walks a rather charismatic-looking, an early 40s man, some salt & pepper hair just starting to show, and what seem to be tailored Speaker Robes. His story starts with a story of how he grew up in Ordulin, how important the 'work of the people' is and civil service; and so-on. Talks about merchants, temples and so-on; how every part of Sembia must work together for things to operate properly. He seems to be all about new thinking, saying that it's kinda stale at "The Hill". The crowd seems very into it, Leonidas too.

Oswen feels it, but is also distanced... Oh. That anxiety again, but facing towards Leonidas this time.

She has to find a way to make this all work.

Then the new Speaker talks about being more open with trade outside Sembia, but that carries risks. He doesn't want to rely on mercenaries; Sembia once had a great navy and a standing Army. "How long can we rely on the Queen of Cormyr?" - he says she's amazing, but wants Sembia be more independent. Even if the current Queen of Cormyr is benevolent, will the next ruler be equally so? And if push comes to shove, isn't she duty-bound to put Cormyr first?

Oswen suddenly finds her attention more focused, with additional anxieties! This might be a wolf in sheep's clothing. After all... What is evil anyway... Does it spread as a giant dragon, a shadow over the land, or filter in, insidiously?

Leonidas is excited and asks what people thought. Oswen doesn't want to crap on his dreams but does sort of lie by omission - he's very charismatic; cares about Sembia and so-on. Performance, in effect, is 18+0 - and Leonidas is sharp, so he sees what she's say and does agree (especially about the army - "I mean, where would they get the people from? Selfishly, it's going to be us! People my age!") - but he's more focused on things like the merchant class and the reforms that were being discussed.

His dad sells wine to that class. They have a small wagon and a horse and sell the bottles for good money, but the merchants - they have war horses, covered big wagons, big houses, lots of money. There's a very big gap in wealth. So Leonidas is sceptical of someone so charismatic, but likes that Perdue seems to "get it" and is willing to give him a chance to not screw it up!

**Oswen is glad to have come. If for no other reason that she's recognised things she must deal with - cracks, between relationships, that she kinda knew would come along one day, but figured until just now that maybe she'd somehow avoided - but no, they must be dealt with. And what's more, her rather silly ideas of a "creeping evil" tell her that this Far Realm stuff is bothering her more than she'd realised.**

For Leonidas' sake, we're not shy of meeting important people! We drag Leonidas over to try and talk to Perdue. We're in a bit of queue in practice but when it's our turn, he doesn't seem phased at all by our strange party. He introduces himself by his full name - **Perdue Tallinan**. We introduce ourselves, Oswen making an emphasis on Leonidas. He gets to say how the merchant aspects are very important to him. When it's our turn, Oswen suggests that while she agrees that relying upon other nations for security is problematic, she's worried how militarisation might actually do more to *raise* heckles, and thus barriers, between nations - rather than lowering them. He has a very interesting answer, agreeing that "military" is not the direction to go, but what if we *were* attacked? He cites, in fact, the recent war - "we were extremely lucky that Sembian cities were not attacked!". We don't know the details, of course. "So maybe not an *army*, but I am thinking... We need more people like *you*, miss! Why are Sembian universities not working with the Centres of the Arcane Arts, to teach and make more readily available the wondrous and amazing knowledge that is part of our history and heritage - the very magic that you wield. I would love to make magic and arcane study available to *every* Sembian."

(Well, he certainly knows which buttons to press to reach a person's existing opinions).

So she asks him exactly that - why is he trying to convince her? This isn't a campaign trail; he already got the Speaker role. He claims he's headed to the Hill now and really does want to represent Ordulin. "I want to shake the halls of power in Selgaunt, until they hear us, the common folk!"

(Inafina, insight dirty 20; that's true. He believes it. Though he's not saying everything.)

Inafina asks, "You seem to have ambitions beyond merely Speaker."

"...Yes. I do." He says he thinks the role of Speaker over the last few decades has become a weak position and attracts the wrong people. A lot of money is spent on it, too, but it just protects "the ruling class". He says, "I intend to up-end it all! The ruling class should be no more. We should be a classless society." Inafina says, "An interesting goal, but beware; a lack of evident rule can lead to utopia... or chaos!" He laughs. "Caution taken! You are wise!"

We wish him the best of luck.

"I don't know why, but something tells me I shouldn't trust that guy, but I can't find any reason for it. This makes me think all the more that I should not!" Leonidas agrees, at least, that "that is what everyone says. But he's had overwhelming support. I think everyone is willing to give him a chance. I think we just want *something* that works!"

Leonidas hasn't got work tomorrow so the five of us head back to the cottage. We talk a lot about the meeting the whole way. And perhaps that's the point - Bel mentions, "how many other people from that meeting do you think are doing what we're doing now? Talking about what's broken, how it can be fixed."

### 10pm

We're back at the cottage; some spiced pumpkin drink, inevitably, as a nightcap; more chat, then bed.

Oswen tries not to think about the previous night's dream, or the lack of reply from Eggsy. Leonidas is a welcome distraction!

She goes to brush her teeth and at that moment, a message comes in! "Have conferred. Sounds worrying. Are you able to travel in the coming days? We should organise a meeting for you with higher-ups." Oswen responds directly, "Yes. Agreed."

We sleep.

(End of Part 2.3)
