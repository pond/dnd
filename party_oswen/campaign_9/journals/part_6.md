# Oswen: Part 2.6
## Sigil, campaign day 14 / Sigil day 3
### Late afternoon, on board Lambent Zenith, above the Outlands

We've just escaped an angry mob at Trade Gate and due to such a hasty departure, ended up onboard the Lambent Zenith, which we never expected, along with a smaller crew than normal.

Inda needs the full story about the rod segment.

Oswen says that it'll take a bit of time. We'll go to her quarters. Oswen asks if anyone else should come given what just happened at the town; so, she invites **Figaro**, **Kycerax** and the two bosuns (the Githyanki) - **Lysan** (male) and **Zastra** (female).

Oswen lays it all out. Vecna, closing the doors to Sigil, the rod, the segment we carry.

Inda wants to see it. We take it out. The Orc and Githyanki don't recognise it - but the other two show a sign of recognition. "Ah", says Oswen. "This isn't entirely new to you?"

Figaro: "I'm aware of this item. How did you come upon it?"

Oswen explains - Morden Kainen is the TL;DR. This led to the misunderstanding - his *first name* is "Morden Kainen". Nobody knows his last name, says Figaro! It's kept a secret, to stop those who might try to control him through use of a real name. Morden Kainen is an honourific title from his home - it's not even a name, so much as a _description_ - a wise and powerful scholar.

We also learn that something kept in a bag of holding isn't entirely hidden - if the bag moves around in a physical space, it can still be in some ways detectable. But there *is* magic that can do that - a spell from somewhere called **Nistule** - he says he can show Oswen.

"Nistule's Magic Aura", L2. She's permitted to copy it into her spellbook. Nondetection was another option, but only lasts 8 hours and totally hides something. People *know* we carry something, so we might as well misdirect what they're looking for.

"OK, so - *where* do you want it to go?" asks Inda. We never got that far earlier! Radiant Citadel; Golden Vault, deep Ethereal. Oswen doesn't notice much (perception 4!) at that, but Inafina notices Figaro - whose arms had been crossed - then gets fidgety, and starts fidgeting in particular with something at his neck. A chain - a *locket* - has the shape of a key. Then he realises and hides it. Inafina nudges Oswen and says, "Show them the funny pocket watch thing". Oswen does and says, "We're part of it". Figaro rolls his eyes! Oswen sees that and says, "Well, I'm still not sure *what* we're part of".

So what next? Do *we* convey the rod? Do *they* convey it? Or do we get dropped off?

Before we decide, there's a knock on the door. Something urgent, she's told. Inda opens the door; three very uneasy-looking crew mates. We can't hear what they say, except Inafina - listening intently, ADV perception 25! - a couple of ships are following us. Inda turns to us; "Let's continue our conversation in a bit!"

They all leave. We're left alone in the quarters. Inafina moves to leave but Oswen says - "No. Now's the time. Let's find out what this mission was! It might be that this is the best place for us; or that we *must* go."

**It's agreed. Oswen gets parchment and pen ready. The key is inserted.**

A 3D illusion projects itself, like last time. We see a gnome, against a strange sparse background, as if in an empty room. No identifying marks. The gnome says:

* "Good day. My name is **Farn Bindlebrot**. You have been given this mission. Should you choose to accept it, I have information for you which could change the course of history! I have been embedded within The Fated - a faction in Sigil that has been watching from the shadows as the halls of power in the darker parts of the Multiverse change allegiances. We have been, in particular, tracking the actions of a few chaotic and unpredictable elements; however we can sense a shift in the 'centre of gravity' towards the rise of an ancient and once-thought-forgotten evil, from the Plane of Oerth. Vecna. You may already be familiar with the name. If not, it should be easy enough to acquire the lore necessary to understand the problem! What we need *you* to do is to find, within the Fortress of **Brimstone Hold**, on the Borderlands of the Plane of Fire, an Efreeti named **Vrakir**. We have been informed by... An informant, of swords... An Arcanaloth - usually not to be trusted! - by the name of **Nebukath**. Vrakir and his army have successfully defeated and raided the Lair of the Red Dragon, **Drendarylix** - who was in the process of turning into a Dracolich. Unfortunately, Vrakir found and now possesses the Tome which is key to Drendarylix's failed attempt at achieving immortality. It is called **The Book Of Vile Darkness**. It was written by Vecna. It *cannot* be permanently destroyed. It contains a sliver of Vecna's essence - of his malice and power. It's aim is to corrupt the world - slowly but irreversibly - as it travels from plane to plane, passing from the hands of one tyrant to another. It corrupts absolutely, but grants immeasurable power. This makes it all the more tempting and dangerous. I am unable to leave my post on Sigil without blowing the cover of many other operatives in this city who have sacrificed a great deal to get this information to you."

* "Enclosed within is **a rune circle that will take you as close as is safe** to the edge of the Plane of Fire, so you can travel to Brimstone Hold. Under *no* circumstances can Vrakir complete reading the Book of Vile Darkness, or he *will* become a very powerful agent and extension of Vecna, who will use him to take over the Elemental Planes. You do not need to kill Vrakir - you simply need to remove the book from his possession! When you get to the location, Nebukath has prepared further information for you. I understand he will give you a map, to better understand how to get into Vrakir's vault. Are you up for the task? For the sake of all we hold dear, I hope you are! I look forward to meeting you one day; bring the book to me in Sigil. You can find me at..." (and he gives his address). We then see runes. **Oswen hastily, but accurately, copies down the circle.**

That's it; the message ends and the pocket watch closes up. Sparks fly from inside, along with smoke!

Well, Oswen isn't sure if the circle she must use has to be operated from within Sigil, as the destination is likewise to near a doorway there, or in the Outlands, for the same reason. Different planes. She will ask Inda; so, we head out on deck to see what's going on there.

It's a hive of frantic activity. Crew run around the top deck. Inda is on the forecastle pointing at things. Figaro runs around on the main deck, looking slightly nervous, is clutching scrolls and leafing through a spellbook. Kycera is nowhere to be seen. The two Githyanki are on the sterncastle, standing with swords raised, facing the back of the ship. Oswen points at them and says "Something's coming from astern... Let's get up there!"

We run up. As do, we see crew swinging a massive ballista around up there. We have to duck! They're pointing to port-astern. We look. In the distance, there is a strange squid-looking ship; it's clearly in pursuit; a bit further away, there's a more "traditional" (to our eyes) galleon-like ship. It looks larger. They're still a substantial distance away; as best we can judge, the closest is maybe some 1,000ft or more. We have no weaponry or spells that can help, until - if it comes to it - the ships are almost upon each other, or being boarded.

Inafina Insight 16. Would it help if we were to depart via that circle? Or would the attackers just assume we were hidden? We don't know what's going on, so she figures and says - "We need to ask how we can help; we've no idea how any of this works."

So, we run back down. Figaro looks frantic; but we think maybe that's a default. "How can we help?" shouts Oswen. "What? Oh! Help? Uhh... Do you - can you operate - can you operate a canon?" Even the word is unfamiliar. We look blank. "Ah. OK. You can't help with that. Are you any good with sails?" and Oswen says, "We're more of a short distance or melee fighting kinda group!" "I thought so... That's fine... Hmm... Well... We're trying to either shake these two ships, scare them into giving up chase, or buying us enough time for the navigator to punch a hole through the planes." "How long does that take?" "We probably need about 5 minutes for him to find a safe place to tear a hole. Do you know how to use a ballista? The people operating that can operate a canon..." - well, we could figure it out... It's a kind of massive crossbow. Inafina could help with aim, but we'd need Kindle to both load bolts and push it around... Bel and Oswen might be able to load others, or even levitate one, once; we shout back "That'll do, we'll take the ballista!"

We go go back up and swap. It takes a few seconds to load the giant bolt. Inafina works with Kindle for him to rotate the weapon while she checks aim. Bel casts Bless on us all. d20 + 5 (DEX mod) for Inafina, plus D4 for bless, yields 18. The great machine fires two bolts, and both hit! 4d10 each - 28 and 15 - one bolt striking much more solidly. Reload! Takes a while. Bel, Inafina and Oswen all reload one bolt while Kindle is strong enough to reload the other. Our ship is starting to turn; we realise that the "canon" Figaro talked about are on the side of the ship. Inafina has to re-aim! It's a good one - 25 total but no crit - and under the ship as this is being done, we hear yelling and the sounds of many wooden shutters opening. We fire. Hit; 23 and 16 damage, all amidships. We begin reloading but the whole ship rocks, almost throwing us off balance a bit as deep "booms" ring out, with what we realise are two of the canons firing. One hits, one goes wide (perhaps because of the rocking throwing it off). Flaming balls of some kind are shot forth; the one striking solidly causes the ship chasing to catch fire. The squid ship seems scared off and peels away.

The bigger galleon isn't giving up. We hold fire in case the squid ship comes back, or the big one gains ground, hoping that there's time to escape. Oswen calls out to the Githyanki, "Is that enough, or should we stay on this weapon?" "You have shown our strength! They have yielded to our superiority!" - we think that means we can stand down. Figaro's head pops up; "You've operated it well!" "Is the Captain free?" "She's popped into the navigation chamber - through that door".

Time is of the essence if we want any choice in this! We run through to the chamber. It's cramped; Kindle stays outside. A small chair floats in a room with no windows. Sat within is a kobold. Inda tells us to come in and close the door. Kindle decides he's on guard! "What is it? Is everything alright?" We explain about the new mission. She tells us to ask Figaro about the circle of runes and meet her in her quarters after, quickly, before we jump to the Astral See. While she finishes up with the navigator, we ask Figaro. He pulls out charts. Oswen, arcana Nat 20 + 11 -> 31; the fire plane is adjacent to the Outlands. Figaro can teleport us there! So he can use rune circle. He opts to do this in the Captains quarters. Once there, we hand over the rod piece. "We need to secure this, magically..." she says. She puts it into a small case and puts that into a safe. Her and Figaro activate various wards. Figaro ties the ward to a different part of the ship, so two "passwords" are needed *from different locations* onboard. They each set one of these passwords. We don't know what they are (probably for the best).

Figaro gets the circle runes from Oswen. As he casts, Oswen asks the captain - we must surely pay something! "We can settle our accounts when this is all over. This is not the end! This is not the last you'll see of us; we'll be back once we've completed our mission. I believe the universe always finds a way. I think we were meant to reach you and meant to convey this item. You are meant to go where you are to go! We will meet again. This I believe."

Not much else to say. The usual thanks, hasty goodbyes, and the circle completes. **We step through.**



### Early evening, adjacent to Plane of Fire

We appear at a circle inside what look like stone ruins. It's warm. A howling, hot wind blows. A rock outcrop, with parts of the ruins of a town! Sand everywhere. Around seems to be just desert. Oswen tries to investigate; 18+8->26. Orvil is sent up. The outcrop is surrounded by sand dunes, but not too far away - a mile or two - is a *river of magma* flowing in a rift in the ground. It leads to another plane - this seems to be the boundary - it flows somehow into the Plane of Fire. We can see islands of rock floating on a sea of lava.

Inafina looks really nervous. "I'm - not so good with fire. All the fur, you see..."

Oswen says, "None of us could really survive *that* without some help, so let's hope this Nebukath can assist. I can't see where he might be though." Looking closer at that plane, it almost looks like the air *itself* is somehow even on fire!

There are a handful of ruined buildings here. Kindle asks if we just wait, but Oswen says, "We may as well check the ruins for any signs of camps or belongings or signs or anything!"

We start to search. Our survival rolls are low. The sand seems to blow and cover tracks quickly. The circle is definitely in the right place; we're clearly where we are supposed to be. But there was no indication of *time*. We don't know *when* to be here. It's starting to get dark; no point trying to traverse an unknown desert at night. We'd better make camp. The magical hut is established, and fortunately Kindle will be able to create more water in the morning. We can drink our fill for now. We run off rations and make the best of it.

That night we do take watches - in case Nebukath turns up. Perception:

* Kindle: 8
* Bel wakes up Kindle: 12
* Oswen: 10
* Inafina wakes up Oswen: 23

Inside the hut was nice. Outside the hut for watch? It's *really* warm. It doesn't get dark at night - but with a river of magma nearby it's not too surprising.



## Campaign day 15, Sigil day 4
### Just before dawn, adjacent to Plane of Fire

Just as the sky is starting to lighten - this area's strange equivalent of dawn - Inafina notices a small desert fox wandering up onto the outcrop. It's brown-haired. It sits, watching. She says, "I don't suppose you're Nebukath in fox form, are you?" The fox stands and starts walking towards her; to one side, flicks its tail; to the other, flicks the tail again; walks around the hut; then approaches Inafina and sniffs. She gets some dried jerky from rations and offers. It doesn't eat it. It moves back a bit and sits in a doorway of an arch, watching. She wakes Oswen; "We might need some telepathy!" - so Oswen comes out of the hut. The fox doesn't run; it smells her too. She dons the helm, and tries Detect Thoughts and "says" - "We were sent here by the golden vault using a teleportation circle to find an Arcanaloth called Nebukath".

The fox stands up on its hind legs - and continues to stand, more and more! It grows to a medium sized person, albeit still very fox-like. Glasses hang on the nose with a gold chain around the back of the neck. Regal mage's robes, trimmed in gold, appear. It clutches a scroll which it immediately hands over. Oswen says, "Ah, this is for **Vrakir's** fortress I suppose..." - she opens the scroll. A map of the fortress. It mentions a room for **Jarazoun**, another efreeti, sort of 2IC. Raspily, Nebukath speaks - "You must plan carefully! I risk discovery by being here. But my spies told me someone had appeared. I hoped it was you. You must find a way to get into the Hold. It is floating on the sea of lava... There are no ships that I can provide without blowing our cover. Is it just the two of you? I fear you will not survive". Oswen says, "Four" - and calls out Bel and Kindle.

It looks and thinks. "You have encountered a dragon before? You will need your wits about you! The upper platform is patrolled by a dragon called **Kalimrax**. Once you make it down into the Hold's interior, you will face the Eye of the Efreeti who sees all using that. It *is* an eye. You may be able to find a way onto one of **Klax**'s boats, but I know not how you would do so. There is a trading depot that ships to Brimstone Hold on fire-resistant boats! It's on the shores of the river."

Oswen says, "Can we even possibly even survive in there? Everything is aflame - even the air!"

"It is warm! I won't lie to you! I presume you have a means of protecting yourself against heat? For most of the denizens and defenders of Brimstone Hold are creatures of fire, from either the Plane of Fire or from the Lower Planes that burn eternal."

"Would the trading post maybe have things to sell that protect against heat?"

"It's possible."

"Well, we'll have to take our chances!"

"I can linger no longer. **Do not make the mistakes of haste, but do not be tardy either - Vrakir could move the book at any time.** I suspect he already has some inkling that I am not as loyal as he would like. I also fear the chaos and destruction he would unleash once he fully embraces the book's power and yields to whoever it's true owner is."

Oswen thanks him and says, "Good luck; I hope you remain undetected."

He turns back into a desert fox and runs off.

We can't stay here. We're about as far from the spire as can be, and have no idea how far around the edge that we would need to go to find another town. We will have to hope for something useful at the trading post; so, **we start to walk!**

Oswen: Survival 19.

Oswen figures that any winds blowing off the river must be extremely hot. We need to try and follow a path with at least some kind of shelter, by landscape or buildings. Even so, it quickly gets terrifying.

*Miles* away still, we can see very easily the area beyond is some kind of boundary to the outlands - a border land to the elemental plane beyond. The planes of fire and earth are meeting, producing magma. Stretching off to the right, defying gravity, we see huge chunks of earth crashing into each other and morphing over each other; churning; unsurvivable. Sometimes parts of the rock float out and fall into the magma, then float before melting. To the left, it's hard to even look. Everything seems to be just fire! Rock and slag melting in the boundary. Interestingly, it's not just molten; it's chaotic. It seems wild, crazy; and it's not just the heat. There's a sound. Even from a distance, there's a strange, low, rumble - like distant thunder - the sound of earth grinding on earth. It's almost more felt than heard.

The area around where we are is itself scorched and there are ruins. The implication is that this boundary area shifts, which is inline with the chaos we can see even at this distance.

The magma river is connecting the main fire area to the floating rock area (!), flowing out from this apparent boundary from the Outlands. How can anything live here?!

Oswen brings Orvil up and asks him to check on how much he can fly - is it even survivable? At this distance, the heat and updrafts even here are clearly coming from somewhere extreme. He's OK here for a while, but in that plane, who knows; we'd all be in serious danger. It simply doesn't look survivable! We *must* get some means to protect ourselves. Oswen can't see, herself or with Orvil, where Brimstone Hold might be. As best we understand it, it's inside this border area, but close to the plane of fire. As far as she can see, that plane itself would be entirely unsurvivable.

So it seems there are two planes - fire to the left; the floating earth to the right; no visible portal - just some kind of threshold. Magma in between comes from the junction of the earth and fire planes, in a giant lake that creates this river. So we need to get "upriver" to wherever the Hold is - but at least not *into* the plane. She notes a predominant wind direction from the Outlands, outwards towards these planes; so that might be the way people get upstream.

Kindle, suddenly, tells us to stop and get any container we can. He casts Create Water and we collect and drink all we can. We'll need to drink often. It's at least a day if we were to try and walk to one of these planar boundaries, yet even this far away, it's already very hot and we get thirsty quickly. Travelling in this heat for even an hour might be exhausting without water! Oswen squints; she can see the border town on the river - *that* is quite nearby - maybe an hour, but could be two? So long as we have the water - we should be fine.

If it's really going badly - and if Kindle has the spell energy left - we can at least use a hut for refuge. He even says he can use Create Water as rain if we needed it!

Bel wets a flannel and dabs himself. The rest of us copy - it's a good idea. At one point he puts it on his head and after a while it starts to steam!

The idea of a town seems somewhat impossible. It's built on the side of a magma river! Turns out, they have built thick earth walls with strange plates of metal, glowing red hot, on the river-facing side. We're not sure if they serve a purpose but the earth walls do work. It's very, very hot in town, but not as bad, once we're close, as it was further away and more exposed to the radiating heat of the river. It's a fully walled town with a main gate, but once we get close, our sense of scale changes. This is more a village - indeed, a trading outpost is a good description. It can surely only have some 10 buildings within the walls. There's a tower sticking up, surprisingly close to the river side, but built in a bend that seems to offer some shelter. We later learn that this is called **Emberbend**.

We get to the gate. It's shut. Someone's looking down at us from the wall above. Oswen shouts up, "Hey there! Let us in! It's hot out here!" - the person looking down seems to be a lizard person of some kind. It replies, "What are you four fools doing out here?" "Seeking shelter and possibly transport." But Bel has a better idea - "Let us in at once! I'm an emissary from the Summer Court of Queen Titania! I'm here to do business and diplomacy!"

Another lizard looks over the edge! They have a conversation we can't here. Then one calls down, "All right, all right!" - chains rattle. The gate opens inwards, not upwards. We head inside.

There's a central courtyard with a handful of buildings. Rammed earth walls with doors and tunnels are present in the walls too; so they're *very* thick - there's room to live *inside* them. Earth stairs lead to the top; a lizard guard is descending. "Halt!" - we halt. "I must have your names!" - he holds a clipboard. We give our names, doing so honestly. "You have clearly not been to this part of the Outlands before! What is your plan for surviving here?" - we have money and hoped that this place had things helping *anyone* to survive. We're advised to head to a particular door that gets us underground, to cooler spaces, until the day is done. The people above ground can survive without help; others, shelter below. We're told where the dock is. Most of the trading happens there... But it's very hot there.

Duergar and Salamanders can handle the heat of the river. As for the fire plane itself... Places like this exist because we are as uncomfortable there as they are here. Efreetis, red or brass dragons, elementals. That kind of thing.

(In part of RP we learn that the tower has hanging cages - a punitive system that looks particularly nasty).

So, we figure - as long as we're still able - docks first. It doesn't get much cooler at night, we know! We want anything. Things that help people stay cool; but the workers here, we have learned, are adapted anyway. However, if there's an actual economy with that fire plane, they *must* export not just import. And those exports might help people deal with the fire.

Oswen, investigation Nat 20 + 11 -> 31!

The dock has a crane, but it doesn't sit on the magma. That looks almost unsurvivable! It just has thick plating and protection on the river-facing sides. Ships are plated with bronze scales - and *that* makes sense. Dragon, perhaps. The ships are iron! That's crazy - they must be so heavy, but of course, they only have to "float" on rock. On reflection... Bronze scales - not red - hmmm. Oswen hopes those were given willingly.

Next to the crane is a warehouse; next to that is a domed building (Tatooine style) that looks half-subterranean. A tavern. A third building has a sign written in something Oswen doesn't understand; a fourth building looks like an office. Oswen casts Tongues - we need to understand and speak the local language. That sign is in Ignin. "The River of Fire Trading Co." - from other words on there, this is for buying and selling. The smaller fourth building has a sign in Infernal. "Contract and recruitment office".

We start with the tavern. We need to know how things like trading or contracts even work here. Bel disguises himself via his hat as Duergar.

Inside, bawdy (sexy jazz!) music plays. It's one of the rougher bars. It smells, mostly of smoke. Bel leads, then Oswen, Inafina and Kindle last to hopefully dissuade people from violent action via his stature!

The smoke inside is from cooking, but cooking is done over a diverted magma stream. Most food looks quite charred but smells good! Bench seats are made of rammed earth; cushions are sacks filled with - something; the tables are carved from stone. Reassuringly difficult to pick up and throw anything!

The bar is circular, with bar stools carved up out of the floor itself. The huge open grill / furnace is at the far end, a distance behind the bar. Everything else is arranged in a circumferential layout.

Everyone else hers a cacophony of guttural noises, scraping, wood burning, fires crackling - a mixture of unusual languages. Oswen understands it all via Tongues. Most clearly is a boastful voice over the top - "I'll drink you under the table and I can afford it as well! I wouldn't try and start anything with me. Not now. Not now that our company is king of the heap!" - grumbling in response; then a response - Oswen looks over to a strange female demon, or tiefling perhaps, succubus? Red-skin, firey, draping over the side of a muscular looking devil, who was boasting. "Yes! Oh yes, you're doing so well indeed... I always knew you would; I've always looked after you here?" - and so-on. The male devil laughs and orders another drink. "A drink for everyone! On Klax! He's done fantastically and we are all benefitting from his success! May the treasures long flow from the spoils of war and trade."

A handful of rubies are flung at the bar tender! That person is a red Dragonborn woman, with a scar down on side of her face and some missing hair. She smiles - but it seems forced - and as she turns to pick up the gems thrown at her, she scowls. She calls over; "Firenewt brew I assume?" "Yes! Only the best!"

It's a roiling firey drink. Mugs are poured. We are looked to - "He did say, for the whole bar! You get one too!" and four more mugs are poured. "Help yourself!"

Everyone looks at us. Well - Inafina notices - insight 24 - notices that the Cambian devil and Succubus/tiefling are looking at us, but not looking at where the eyes of the Duergar should be. They're looking at Bel's face. So she says loudly, "Well, I guess there's no fooling you lot!" and then nods to Bel, "I think you can let that go now!" and Bel plays along, laughing. "A fun masquerade!" - a high Deception roll.

Kindle brings up the mug to his mouth, sniffs it and takes a sip... He looks to the rest of us and says, "Well... It has a bit of a kick..." - but he's no dead so we have to make *some* kind of impression and we all it a try. CON saves all round! But Bel is on form; he starts recounting a story - before he takes his sip - while surreptitiously encouraging, via his story, Oswen and Inafina with Bardic Inspiration (extra d8).

CON saves all round:

* Bel (+0 for con!) - grimaces and tries it - only 10 - Deception is good tho; he hides his pain!
* Inafina - only 11 including Bardic; and she can't even hide that!
* Oswen - lowest of the lot, only 9.

Everyone is looking - and they all burst out laughing. The bartender smiles; she puts up four shots instead. "Hurry! Drink them!" - we shrug and comply. This soothes the burning. "Thanks!" says Oswen. When we look around we see empty shots on tables too, so we might not be the only ones who use this. Someone steps up from a table and claps Inafina and Bel on the back. "You're a good sport!" - tussles Oswen's hat! - and after that we're largely ignored.

(We do take 5 fire damage, all except Kindle). But we can now actually finish that fire-based brew, and with the shot taken prior, it's actually not bad and we don't feel as hot.

The bartender's name is **Nylax**. In the discussion, we have to reveal that we have "business" with Vrakir... And that causes *great* concern. But we're invited to take a seat, and we do so - a distance from the fire - having ordered food (because it smells great).

As we walk over, Bel raises his mug in thanks to the table where we thought Klax was - but we've learned that this is just someone who works in his crew. There is a nod in response.

While we wait for food, Oswen - perception dirty 20. She's the only one that can understand. And it's Klax's crew's table that is of interest.

* The reason why the devil creature there is in such good spirits is because their crew has been able to secure some amazing loot to trade from Brimstone Hold
* The "tyrant" who runs it has "recently" come into possession of immense wealth plundered from the lair of an old red dragon
* Traders have been coming from far and wide to buy
* Klax charges a steep commission!
* They think this secures their future for a long time. The tiefling/succubus continues to act like she's the partner of the devil, but really she's clearly just in it for the money
* They only need to get to the Citadel (Oswen think he means the Hold) to get a boatload of treasure in exchange for payment, which already includes a markup for Klax et al along with whatever form of payment it is that the Hold actually wants.

So:

* What does the Hold want in exchange for their dragon's treasure?
* What *is* that treasure and why does the Hold's resident dragon not want it, or how is it kept at bay?

The bartender comes up. We discuss matters of food and trade. This tavern exists in part because of traders coming to buy strange things from the fire realm, so that's why she wasn't too surprised to see us. She's able to even make things like iced tea! The warehouse area isn't the place to find protective items; those are down below, at "**The Vole's Market**".

The reason for the rubies we saw is the common currency between the fire and *earth* planes. The latter trades in gems more than gold and rubies are common between the two. She shows us some; they're small, but each worth maybe some 100gp.

Before finishing serving the food with general, loud joviality, the bartender leans in. She warns us that the Hold is *a very bad place*. Absolutely no redeeming qualities and souls. She hints heavily that Klax's crew are one such group who are very invested in keeping the status quo - they're making a lot of money, as are many others - and if they think we're going to disturb that, they'd turn on us.

Once we're done, we offer to pay; she smiles and shakes her head; "Do me one thing - whatever it is you're here to do, promise me that you will leave this place back to safety in one piece and remaining who you are. *That* will be payment enough for me."

See seems to be a dreamer - operating in this dark place, but hoping for light; doing what she can at the edges of her own moral boundaries to try and hold a balance.

"Truthfully I cannot promise the outcome of our welfare. But I certainly can promise we will, one way or another, live or die as who we are."

"I hope you remember that when you encounter things that you may not have known existed. Never forget who you are. It is the only thing that we have when the final judgements are made. When the balance sheet is examined. At the end."

She smiles and turns away. As she does, we see that the scarring she has looks, we realise, deliberate. This was inflicted upon her. It was not accidental. Goodness knows what she has been through, but somehow, come through.

We head down an indicated side door, looking for "The Vole's Market".

A tunnel heads off sideways a little, then down stairs, and to what is some kind of courtyard. Ceilings are surprisingly high, 10ft, so even Kindle can stand upright. It feels cluttered, though, as all sorts of stalls are laid out here and cloth drapes seem to be set up to delineate spaces. Leading away on various sides look like maybe rooms for dwellings, or inns; it looks like this is all a sort of main connected collection of rooms and hallways, not separate buildings. Judging by the all-directions exit tunnels this market area might well be a central hub.

Something is set in the walls; looks older - strange; a carved face, with a slow trickle of water coming out that collects in a small pool. Oswen unnecessarily high Arcana check 19+11->30; no magic; a natural spring. This is perhaps why the trade depot exists _at all_. Most likely it's the only water source. It has been piped here from the spring source; she can hear a bit of an echo and flow down from a distance.

It's quite quiet here. As Oswen examines the fountain, someone approaches; "It was here long before any of us. It's the font that keeps this small settlement alive. Quite wondrous, isn't it? How something like that can exist in such a hostile environment."

In the resulting conversation, we're asked to explain what we're here for. We do our usual evasive but true response. We need to go there in person. But we're challenged on that; why go ourselves? Klax is there to handle the trade - *they* can survive in that environment. They know how to deal with **Jarazoun** - we look pensive at that! "You should come and meet someone" we're told. "Really the only one down here who has ever been to Brimstone Hold."

We're taken to a stall. Sat behind is black-and-white-furred, elderly-looking Tabaxi. They are **Jemima Softpaws**. We introduce ourselves. Jemima stands up gracefully, despite the appearance of advanced years. We are greeted in turn, politely. We get into a conversation.

* She used to head over to Brimstone Hold but has not in a while; she just finds the situation there has been getting harder and harder for her to confront.
* It's a very tenuous alliance / arrangement between this settlement and the Hold. While the going is good, everything seems fine, but it won't take much for Brimstone Hold to turn on them.
* **The Hold sends out war parties** (!) over the bridge (**bridge?!**) - they are able to move islands of rock, which they use as troop carriers. Significant numbers, brought in by portal. They then march on land to attack places in the Outlands.
* They often traverse the Elemental Chaos to reach other places too. The boundary areas contain ways to access various kingdoms and lands, if you know where to look - such as the old Red Dragon that they defeated, leading to their current surplus of riches.
* War parties often bring back prisoners, who are put to work... There is a prison yard and prison complex at Brimstone Hold that consists of survivors and captives. They must be replaced often since they die or are eaten (!) by Kalimrax, who has a reputation of being ever more a tyrant as he gains power and hoard grows.
* Jarazoun is another efreeti, the 2IC for Vrakir. 
* Vrakir himself, **is rarely there** - "...which is good, as Vrakir is kind of crazy! Jarazoun is malicious but at least he is predictable. Vrakir on the other hand is *extremely* powerful and quite mad."
* He alternates between being a tyrant **and being extremely paranoid**.

We're asked what our dealings are. While Oswen is inclined to trust, we just learned that if we achieve our mission then this town is probably dead. So she continues to hedge. She doesn't entirely buy it. She knows we're hiding something.

Leap of faith. Hope it's not another Sowfoot.

Oswen makes a show of looking at an item on the table. "We'll have to discuss price of course!" she announces loudly, then whispers, "Is there somewhere we can talk privately?" "Of course, but I don't see what you could possibly want to discuss with *me*... You are, after all, here to trade with Brimstone Hold, are you not?" Oswen answers, "We might need to *treat* with Bristone Hold. But we probably need to *trade* with people here." "Well now. Nobody is here unless they have very compelling reasons to be! It is not a good place. The guards are either paid or slaves. Klax is here only for profit. The rest of us are here because we run things that make life bearable on the edge of civilisation; or - in some cases - because we have nowhere else to go."

She leans in closer. "Good people are only here for one of very few reasons. And *you* come across to me like a good person. Look, I can get you set up with a room! Whether you're feeling things out or waiting for a shipment to arrive - whatever the reason - you wouldn't be here unless you had to, like everyone else. Almost *all* trade happening here, at the moment, goes to Brimstone Hold. And there's only one company that sends ships out there; that's Klax's. Klax has just returned. So he's not going to be heading out for at least a few more days. You might as well make yourself at home. How does that sound?"

"OK, sounds good. And we can talk."

She gets someone to take over the stall and leads us down a hallway; unlocks a door. 2nd on the right. There are continuous flame spells here, all around, keeping things light. Inside, there's one on a brazier in the middle of the room, cushions around it. "When you want to go to sleep, just cover the flame" (there's a big brass dome cover off to one side). The room is 2 gold a night for the four beds that it has, plus water. We pay 6gp just as insurance really, for 3 nights.

Jemima shows us a way to get ourselves cleaned without wasting water like a bath does. A jar is used, with a pouring method and reservoir that lets much of the water be reused. Only one amphora can be refilled at a time from the font - a strict rationing system to be fair to everyone.

We're told to come back out to the stall once we're settled and she'll introduce us to other stallholders to get some protective gear and more appropriate clothing.

(We also learn that the guards are either slaves or on the Hold's payroll and *not* trustworthy).

Once we have privacy, we confer.

* Completing our mission would essentially destroy this "town".
* Prisoners. We'd like to free them. But how?

Inafina points out that the outpost is small. We could spend time learning about all the people who are here, and why. The four of us will have been noticed by everyone by now. Do we even bother to keep up the ruse of being traders? If we give away why we're really here, anyone interested in Klax's gravy train would want to stop us. The guards would (slaves aside perhaps) want to stop us. Anyone who was worried that the outpost might be attacked and truly had no other place to, or no means to travel, would want to stop us. That surely leaves few people who'd be happy with what we're trying to do.

One thing's for sure. We can't do it alone. We couldn't even have achieved what we did in Prismeer alone. It look many others to help us, at every step of our journey.

Nothing more to be gained from introspection. We head out, to be introduced to the other stallholders. A brute-ish guy is poking about there, red-skinned, letting off some smoke off the skin! He has a whip-like tail. He doesn't seem to be buying things; more seems to be just somewhat drunken. Klax? History Oswen, 2+5! Only 7. Someone else at the bar, though? Not sure! We observe for a while. He's insulting people; claiming things are poor quality, questioning the purpose of a stall - why is it even here? And so-on. Eventually he leaves and various people, apparently who'd been in hiding, reappear.

Oswen walks up to Jemima's stall and says - loudly enough to be overheard - "Well, he seemed consummately unpleasant!" - Jemima laughs. "He's harmless really. He's certainly not one of the dangerous ones! Sometimes they just need to come down here and feel a bit superior. It's not like he doesn't have a point! Most of us aren't selling anything *that* important or needed. We're certainly not the backbone of what keeps this outpost going."

A seller at a table next to hers turns. "Nonsense! We're the only ones keeping this place alive and you know it. The others, making the big trades? They don't contribute to *here*. Without us, this place might as well not even be here. We're here for the residents; they're here to make money for themselves only. And where does it all go?" Another stallholder tells them they're just working themselves up. We figure this is quite an old discussion by now.

Oswen prompts Jemima - "Well, it would be good to know what *is* available on the stalls here."

Directly across the space - beautiful silks, light linens, thin cottons. "These are woven in the beautiful cotton fields of the Outlands and brought here". She leaves us with the skinny, dark-skinned, quite elderly, shaved-headed stall holder. He's human. Wiry. He tells us our clothes have great workmanship "but too tight and too thick!" "Yes. Something more appropriate for the climate would be appreciated..."

His clothes protect from the sun, and are practical, but don't help with lava. He shows us a few pieces and how they wrap around and drape, especially over the head. "There *are* things that could provide a bit more protection but they are expensive. Harder to come by. They raise eyebrows." Oswen asks, "Raised or not, have *you* come by such things?"

Even with Bel's help, we're not persuasive. He says he wouldn't risk the ire of the guards! Fair enough. But we may well get the clothes, since nobody else sells them so it's not like we have much choice. We're rather varied in size, though... He shows us a few things that should work. For Oswen he has a light silk robe of sorts, with a hood, and wide sleeves. Monk meets wizard vibe. For big Kindle, he suggests a two-piece approach. A sort of flowing cover, almost a tabard, then a long piece with clasps that can be thrown over the head and shoulders. Inafina is more human-sized, but not shaped, especially for the ears. He offers to tailor something for her. She ends up with a hood that's much easier to take up and down. To keep her mobile, it's less of a robe and actually has flowing pants, with a long sleeve top that can be tied in the middle. Bel goes Lawrence Of Arabia! The headpiece, head bad, all of it. In many ways, it's likely to be the most practical of the lot.

Total cost is 40gp. Some spare pieces, extra belts and clasps etc. are all included.

Oswen Perception, 20(!)+1  during this process, sees, in a chest that he opens, a beautiful, gleaming, red leather fitted top of some kind. She figures from context, *must* be something red dragon based. So at one point in the middle of all of it, she catches his eye, says, "And if you do think of anything else..." - then turns her gaze pointedly to the chest, then back - "we're just down that hallway, second door on the right."

The tailor **Tatoun** was part of a travelling caravan. While here, he got injured and the others had to leave. He met Jemima who had only just started establishing herself then, as the "caretaker" of this place. He felt that she could use his help. People were very badly dressed! Originally people wanted to do trade with the City Of Brass, the capital of the Plane of Fire. A capital?! "Yes! A fabled place. Unfathomably wealthy, ruled by an elite class of Efreetis and Fire Djinns." 

We move to the next stall. This one is food - all kinds of imports. Understandably this is the more busy stall. The owner is a half-orc **Bart**, speaking in Common - like the other stallholders - but with a strange accent, seems more jovial. "I have a delivery every week! Fresh food!" - and their caravans, that they organise, bring wood and extra water. **The water is for the Hold**. Even Duegar need water. **It's shipped in very large, clay amphora**...

A stowaway opportunity?

It's very important to take water in for them too, as the natural spring is only just enough for the people here (who obviously can't afford to *import water*).

The next water shipment is in 2 days, so that's why Klax is waiting. They're once a week. Klax probably doesn't go out more often than that.

There is fresh flatbread, wrapped in linen, along with jars of cucumbers. Not even pickled. Just cold. They last about a week. We ask for some flatbread and some cucumbers. We get a jar of pickles too! There's cheese too. In the end we spend a gold piece, and it almost feels like robbery for the amount we get in such a remote location. As we buy things and chat, we ask what brings this half-orc here. He facilitates shipments in and out of here of supplies. He coordinates with caravans to the rest of the Outlands. He's really a true trader. He can get things in.

**Or out**. Such as a people?

Now we get to the stall next to Jemima's who was arguing that the stalls are very important. It's a book store. Oswen is astonished. They can be borrowed or purchased. The male stall holder is an interesting looking character! There's scaly skin, but not like the Lizardfolk guards. Sort-of-related to more a crocodile than a lizard, perhaps? His head is human-like. Looking closer, the scales on the skin seem uneven; maybe it is an affliction. His name is **Arden**.

The books are, unsurprisingly, pretty mixed but presented in nice cases. They're well looked-after. He has writing implements and is someone who handles all the contracts here. He's the "learned man". The books seem to have a theme; systems of equal distributions of wealth, societies of plenty, that sort of "left leaning" theory stuff. Investigation 17+11! Plenty of Sigil-authored books on what amount to philosophies of governance, along with more history-orientated tomes that describe the rise and fall of civilisations with (probably biased) opinions on why that happened. There's also a really interesting set on architecture, describing how it might improve society.

Oswen picks three.

* One is for the arguing politicians! It's about systems of governance and tries to argue that greater equality of distribution of wealth and power generally leads to better outcomes and futures, but a ruling mechanism is still needed. It's based on real societies - but in Mount Celestia! The plane of Lawful Good.

* Two are for the library. One is about architecture and how it can improve outcomes for people living in the area. That's a book from Sigil. The other is about rises and falls of civilisations, with an opinionated take on why that happened and how governance might have changed to avoid it. This is not tied to any particular plane; it covers multiple words and cultures and is the largest of all of them with separate chapters that refer to different planes. For people from Torril, not used to the concept of multiverse, it would be particularly unusual. Ordulin, thinks Oswen, is probably ready for such a thing!

It seems our seller has read all of these and engages in conversation with the theories in them. He is surprised when he realises we want to buy them! He doesn't seem to know the prices he should charge. Oswen decides to whisper a hint that, at least where she comes from, books of reasonable merit and weight such as these can be quite varied, but usually sell for around 25gp each. Bel weighs in to try and arise at a fair price overall. The bigger is worth 30gp, but the other two are certainly quite a bit smaller. So 20gp each. 70gp? Would that be OK? Arden seems almost unhappy about it still! But we argue that 70gp is a very fair price. And after all - this is covered by the Golden Vault's float.

Arden perks up at the thought that this large amount of money means he can buy some new books via the next caravan!

We learn that in his case, he owes a life debt to "the kindly woman upstairs" (the barkeep) but he won't elaborate any further. He obviously holds her in very high esteem. Whatever happened between them has kept him here. No idea if that feeling is mutual!

We nod to Jemima on the way past as we cut across to the other side, anticlockwise from the tailor. It sells flasks, glass objects, things of everyday use and things made of bone. Cones, utensils, tools, plates, ceramics; there are even perfumes and theoretical medicines though we don't know the efficacy. There are even pigments and spices. The stall holders are one of the only couples here, male and female humans. The woman is the one who talked to us at the font a while ago. She's not here right now; the husband is here. They are called **Llena** (wife) and **Orta** (husband). They arrived seeking refuge, travelling in a trading caravan that had got lost, was attacked, and they escaped. They didn't know what attacked them - whatever it was, they were the only survivors plus one other. They just had a bag of belongings. They found the outpost, at death's door. The group underground took them in and nursed them back to health.

They had enough wealth with them to set up a stall. The other survivor was a teenage child, who was essentially adopted; that's who they needed to support; the child has now struck out on their own, but they consider themselves too old now to venture out too. They think their (male) child might come back one day too, for when he returns. They don't know if he views them in the same way, but the feel responsible. They've been here three years now.

We buy some glass bottles to help store water. We also buy a small bottle of perfume in case it is useful for exchange in future - like we needed trinkets in the Fey! The husband introduces us to various things. It's all from a perfume case. But next to it, is a collection of glass bottles with different liquids that he hasn't mentioned. Oswen politely enquires about *those*. Not perfumes! "These are - hmm - not sure what to call them. They're not medicines, because medicines are what you take when you're already sick. These are things you take beforehand. They're not tonics because they actually work!" "So what do they fortify one against?" "Well, this one - poisons. This one, to survive harsh conditions. This protects against diseases in general. A few do, actually. This one here - this is holy water, from one of the outer planes. Ah! These are more concentrated forms of things we make for the bar upstairs..." - he opens another case - "...and these are, well, extracts." Inafina perception 25, can see inside easily. It's not the continual flames around that cause flickering of light within these vials. A fire defence. She nudges Oswen and says, "The 'extracts' could be useful..." - the seller is a bit wary - looks around - "They're - umm - actually flames of newt, is what I call them! They are made of salamander." He shows Oswen. Two vials inside. But it's probably salamander *blood*. Oswen says, "Well, I think - *that* perfume, one extract - wouldn't want to be greedy - and I can't for the life of me think where under current circumstances I might find holy water again, and it's a funny thing, it can be useful when you least expect it. Would those three be OK?"

Another small case is fetched to protect the water and (what amounts to) fire protection potion - keep them from view. 25gp for the water; 5gp for the perfume; the potion - 150gp! Ouch. Considering the difficulty of obtaining it though... Well, we were given 500gp for reason. We don't even barter; 175gp *quietly* paid, as he generously gives us *two* vials of perfume for free and a couple of glass bottles.

The last shop is a cobbler, who makes gloves and repairs workwear. Interesting character - quite large, muscular, imposing almost, with very tanned skin and very lean. He's completely bald with kind of tribal tattoos over his head and shoulders. They must spend time above ground as well as below often. They wear loose oversized clothing with short sleeves, which certainly doesn't hide their powerful build. Linen pants, sandals. Stood up, he's as tall as Kindle, but spends most of the time sat down. This is **Jordun**.

We end up opting for some thick gloves. They'll take a lot of heat for a short period - but obviously not enough to dip a hand into the river, for example!

Jordun **earned his freedom from Brimstone Hold**. We didn't even realise that was possible! There was an opportunity arising from a wager; gladiatorial games with someone who came to *buy* slaves. He won the right to be selected, one of about ten who survived the contests. He was, therefore, purchased. He isn't from this plane; he was captured along with other members of his tribe from a world called **Athas** - a harsh, desert world where slave trade was "a thing" anyway. Vrakir and his horde descended upon his village and captured everyone.

There are some who he hopes are still alive at Brimstone Hold. He hopes, one day, to find brave heroes who will take down Brimstone Hold, depose the tyrants who rule it, and he can find the remnants of his tribe there. "Until that day comes, I will be here, waiting."

He *hates* Klax and his crew, for he is reminded of what they do.

Kindle is low charisma and straight-up asks, "But if you were bought as a slave, how did you escape?" - and Jordun stands to his full height. "We slaughtered those who would be our new masters when we reached these shores, without mercy, for they certainly intended to show *us* no mercy. Strength prevails."

Oswen frowns up at this very tall character. "Ordinarily I'm not sure I'd approve of something like that; but given what you say, I find it hard to argue. It almost seems fitting. I worry if one day I might lose myself, with such stories." But Kindle disagrees! "Yondalla teaches compassion. Mercy is strong!" He's not at all arguing that they should have stayed slaves. But he would have hoped for another approach. Jordun says that his world has no gods - they left; they were forsaken; and they "did just fine without them. You should see it perhaps. It might open your mind to see a world that is not a playground for the whim of gods."

We have to make our excuses to extricate Kindle from the debate! Oswen is quietly impressed. She can't see that Jordun had much other choice, yet Kindle sticks to his principles and holds his ground. **A guiding light**.

This brings us full circle, back to Jemima's stall at last. She sells room and board, and is the diplomatic voice of the core community here. She is also the (romantic, not business) partner of the innkeeper. At this we ask the name, which we never got before - the tavern owner is **Loren**. We mention that Arden speaks very highly of Loren. "Yes. She is someone who has been through a lot, but never wavered. I admire that strength in her, as do others. Arden is a very bright fellow and serves a very important role in this community. We may be small, but we look after each other. We do well enough for ourselves."

She has that 'leader' energy; that wisdom. The idea that if we wanted to stay here and contribute, a place would be found. There's not much charisma, mind you, except for Loren up in the tavern.

**The eight of them here, plus half a dozen or so dockworkers better suited to work above - one of whom is one of Jordun's tribe mates - along with some lizardfolk are part of this group too. The guards are separate.**

"There isn't really a leader" she says. "There's someone who runs and owns the trading house; they are possibly the most powerful person here, though Klax really is the *de facto* ruler by virtue of being the most powerful and wealthy. Technically, though, the Trading House Master is the one who pays the wages of the guards; all the other workers are slaves." That person is lumped in with the Brimstone Hold group - clearly profiting off the current status quo, unstable though it might be.

We use getting changed into our new clothes as an excuse to get to our room.

We discuss what we all feel. Oswen also confesses that she'd like to try Divination - for Orta and Llena's adoptive sun. Bel & Oswen consider Divination could be a useful spell to try and guess at possible futures for this person, but there's a more useful one; to allow Orta and Llena to speak to their son, directly. Sending. Sigil uses couriers to Send on behalf of others, so depending on what he's used to, that might be OK; but if he's *in* Sigil will this work? The group is fairly sure it's all part of the same "weird central plane". It's not in a different plane, it's just magically protected from unwanted entry. No teleports without permission and so-on.

Not the right time to do it now tho! Next up - the docks maybe?

We may as well head up and look around. We've got the right clothing now. We head out again and ask Jemima if there's a tunnel that leads to the entrance (we only know the one to the bar); there is one that leads to the entrance and we follow that. We emerge near the gates, recognising the entrance we are emerging from. We're at the central courtyard again. Oswen suggests we go up, but the watchtower and walls are patrolled by the guards. Those do lead to the dock tower with all the machinery for loading and unloading too, but we don't have a convincing reason to be there.

We head up the steps, *looking* for a guard this time. We're stopped and challenged. We explain; we're told the walls actually give a better view. So we walk along - escorted. The guard with us is suspicious. Oswen keeps to group smalltalk, observing the obvious and keeping it kind of factual.

* There's a door and set of stairs at the dock-ward end of this wall to access the control room for loading and unloading.

* There isn't anyone in there as far as we can see, from an (glassless) window set in the side. People there probably use it to look and call down to the dock.

* Two boats are docked. Both are very similar, so probably both belong to Klax's group. We estimate they might be around 40-50ft long, so not huge but not tiny.

* They're sat floating in the magma itself. We can't see anything of the hull from this distance and the thermals would be far too dangerous for Orvil to try and fly through.

* They do look like haulers - barges - looks like things are loaded on top, not down below decks. There might not even *be* a "below decks". There seem to be wooden frames (pallets) standardising spaces.

* The dock looks like it has room for a third such barge. Perhaps that's away at the Hold? The dock lifting gear hovers over that empty space presently.

* They're totally unoccupied right now. Ropes and tarps look like they're used while in operation, which gives an implication that direct heat on deck might not be *too* fierce, else they'd have to use chains and suchlike - ropes and tarps would burn.

* The unloading area forms the dock; it's just an extension of rock built out by the river; there are rollers that can be used to move things out of the warehouse and into that area for the crane to access.

Oswen, perception 16+1->17. She sees someone from the watch tower call out in some language she's not heard. The guard with us looks and yells back, then yells down to the dock below. A bell starts to ring, like a work bell, not an alarm. Someone comes out of the Trade Master's Office below, looking up; it's a lowly-looking individual somehow, hard to explain; goes to another building and fetches people. Two emerge. One is a goblin, the other some kind of Dragonborn/Lizardfolk-like. We make a guess at that being the Trading House Master.

The two walk over to the dock tower and start to climb up. They look briefly at us on the way, but seem to not care. The goblin goes up full in while the bigger one stays in the doorway, looking over the wall; fetches a spyglass; looks again; then nods back. We surmise the third boat is on its way back. The goblin is moving levers in the control room and various pulleys and chains are moving around. We wait, and keep watching.

Our guard has left us, moving over to the dock tower. Down below one guard stands on dock; some workers have emerged but seem to be trying to keep to shade. Not happy with heat. Perhaps more of a reflex - the heat really comes from the magma river, not the sky, since there's not really a sun.

Looking to the river, we see a large Goliath-like creature - ah, the other tribes-person - carrying what seems to be a really long pole with a flat stone disk on the end, as "T" shape. The goblin is shouting various things in their own language. The guards are too close; they'd hear Oswen casting Tongues or Comprehend Languages.

The barge is now visible on the horizon. It moves slowly. It seems to be only lightly laden, but there are quite a few people on board. A dark tarp covers its cargo. The "Goliath" gets close to the river, trying to keep back as much as he can, and pushes the circular end down into the river. He's straining, pushing hard; then chunks of rock push off and break, floating and melting; he's chipping away chunks "frozen" at the edge of the dock. Once he's done, he leans the pole over the edge, as magma drips off. His hands and face are red with the effort. *Very* hot down there.

More guards appear. Two up here; two standing by the dock; one in the courtyard. Five so far. We keep count as we might need to fight our way out when this is all reaching a conclusion.

The barge starts to move towards the harbour, using long metal poles that are pushed all the way out against embankments of the river - not pushing into the magma itself. It's quite awkward. Going back *up* stream must be particularly difficult. Oswen really expected more magic that seems to be evident - this just seems very physical.

Once close up and pulling in, we can see that this barge is much smaller and seems in worse shape. Eight people on board; two at the front, two trying to grab chains thrown from the dock to moor; four stabilising the relatively light cargo.

Emerging from a small building down on the dock level is a very brightly red-skinned humanoid, male, folded red wings, wearing a gaudy gold ring-mail top piece that seems more for show than protection. Long braids in the hair carry gold beads. Two arcing ornate horns, decorated with more jewellery, come out of the front of its head. **Surely, Klax**. Following behind are two smaller but dragon-like creatures, a bit like large kobolds. The booming voice carries a distance. He's laughing. Oswen risks bringing up Orvil, who's able to get down onto a roof without too much trouble and can hear.

"**Merregon**", calls presumed-Klax. "Why do you waste your time?" He crosses his arms and puffs out his chest. "How many days have you been out there? And this is all you can find? I've told you a thousand times - there's only *one* trade route on this river that's worth anything!"

A person on board glances over - this must be Merregon - who looks similar, physically, but smaller and less decorated/rich, and just one longer horn arcing backwards instead of two, but otherwise ignores the taunting. Klax continues to shout and taunt. Eventually he calls back, "I'm busy! I don't have time for your idle chit-chat. There's money to be made!"

The tower is lowering down hooks. The four on the cargo run and hook up a pallet. They steady it and wave up; the goblin is leaning out of the window for a good view, then operates levers to lift the item. It is lowered down onto rollers on the loading area. It's unhooked ready for the next one. People have to step back quickly as things unhook as the chains swing wildly. It's clearly dangerous. The presumed-Klax Cambian yells, "Ha! Well, we'll see how much money you make - you should run the numbers! - I'm giving you the best deal there is. But if you want to be a fool... Pah! There's no helping some people!"

He turns to leave and shouts back, "Merrgon! Tell your crew that when they're done they can come to the tavern and have a drink on me!" - deliberately loud enough for the crew to hear, probably trying to sow dissent.

Since there's distracting activity, we decide to make our way back down - thanking the guard at the dock tower as we go past - back to the courtyard and then down again, towards the warehouse, hoping for a peek inside. The doors are open and we can look straight in - big "barn door" like affairs. As soon as goods are rolled in, things are unloaded inside. The barge presumed-captain, Merregon, with some of his own crew, walk in. A second pallet is arriving. We approach.

It's a full warehouse inside, with some pleasing familiarity about it. No mezzanine or offices high up; just a huge open space. Lots and lots of chains with hooks; pulleys; there's a high catwalk all the way along the top that can move things around on rollers following tracks off the roof.

Coming out from within to greet the captain is a really fearsome-looking creature. Almost 8ft tall, once again the now-familiar fiery-skin but particularly muscular; wrapped in rusty, glowing chains all over, including a huge belt with a huge buckle. It has a glowing, brass insignia on it; the rest seems to be made of some kind of strange slick, scaly hide. The eyes look like burning coals; it has no mouth - a strange sort of veil instead from the nose down, made of chains with hooks at the end. They're dragging along the ground the ends of hooks with large chains and spikes too. The top of its head is wrapped with a similar material to its belt, almost like a turban in style. It walks with a particularly kind of strange arrogance. The chains it pulls aren't dragging on the ground - they're hovering! All these chains almost seem to be *part* of this being.

Two bearded devils flank it. They're pale-skinned and carry very long halberds, or pikes, or - well, a sort of hybrid; they each look almost 10ft long! They both have tails, goat-like legs and on they too have hooks - fishing hooks, bloody and rusty - on the ends of their beards. These clatter as they move.

Merregon raises his arms and bows slightly, while saysing, "Trade Master! I bring you spoils - treasures from afar. Lost valuables. Memories of cultures long destroyed - crumbled civilisations. Let's talk about *trading*." He smiles.

The Trade Master speaks in a strange, muffled, crackly voice. "Trade? Very well! Show me what you have brought me and I will decide if they are treasures or doss."

The crew starts opening crates and showing objects from within. The Trade Master calls over in a strange barking noise to the corner of the warehouse from which he had appeared; there's a strange, smokey shadow there, almost as if there were a permanent fire. A great, 12-foot tall creature appears... A huge head rears, pulling smoke with it; bat-like, sharp teeth, long ears; above the head is a huge golden crown, looking like massive golden horns, beset with gems. Long claws move forward; it's covered in gold bangles, arm bands and more. It leaps forward suddenly, unfurling great wings; it flaps twice, apparently mostly for show, on improbable - almost dainty - legs and feet. It sniffs the air. It walks, with both hands - arms longer than legs - to each crate, again smelling. Some it pushes aside. Then it smells something of interest; swings its head to a crate and points. "Bring that one to me! The Eater of Hope smells value!" says the Trade Master.

The crate is brought over pried open, then the contents are poured out. A suit of armour; gem encrusted bowls; rings; bangles... Treasure, generically!

At this moment, group stealth.

* Oswen: 17
* Kindle: 18
* Inafina: 20+8->28
* Bel: ...nat 1.

Oh. We were doing so well... The Eater of Hope yanks its head up, sniffs and turns to look at us. Bel, in particular. Its face spreads in a strange, wide grin. It extends a finger and points. "That one is rich!", it says.

Oswen realises Bel must bluff and immediately tries to help - laughs - "Well I should think Lord Bel Bottom ought to be, given what we hope to accomplish on our mission!" and Bel joins in, "Well, of course; don't let me interrupt; but maybe there's something to buy *here*" - he strides purposefully up. "Nothing is for sale!" says the Trade Master, but Merrgon says that it seems we have competition. "But I'm sure you will give me a fair price for my haul..."

The Trade Master glares. Chains move like an annoyed cat's tail. "Don't forget where you are! Nothing moves through this town unless it goes through *me*. *My* town. *My* trade."

A chain unfurls in Bel's direction and scrapes along the ground threateningly. Bel puts on full charm; "Of course, I wouldn't dream of cutting out the middle man!". The rest of us join him, feigning confidence. Klax has re-entered - must've been told something was going on? He's fast! He calls out - "Are you done? Shall we have a drink?!" Merregon of course ignores him.

The bearded devils start sifting through things. Oswen at some point says to the Trade Master, "Your 'eater' is certainly perceptive. We could do with such a creature ourselves." The Eater turns and looms over us. It's maw opens and fetid breath spreads out. "I don't belong to *anyone*, much less *sacks of flesh* - weak pustules of blood and water!" - it flies back into its strange dark corner. We can now see that it's attaching itself up to the ceiling, unfurling wings and shaking them, which causes the black shadow/mist to 'fall' from nowhere.

The Trade Master and Merregon start to negotiate a price. We get the impression that Klax is being very annoying - deliberately calling out numbers, to try and undercut. Listening, we hear that Merregon claims to have chanced upon the royal entourage of some haughty elves, travelling on a "boat of ancient gold" across the sky; they were defeated and slaughtered, and all belongings taken. **At this, Oswen's early ideas of maybe trying to pitch Merregon and Klax against each other is pointless. This is not a creature with which she wishes to ally. Whether or not he lies about his story, he cannot be trusted. We will find another way.**

We stick around mostly to hear more prices. Merregon eventually digs in his heels. "I will negotiate no further unless *he* is no longer here!" - he points to Klax. Apparently there are rules and the Trade Master concurs. We are similarly dismissed, so we nod and leave.

As we go, Oswen - Arcana 21 - quietly Manifests her spell book around a Continual Flame; she wants it to go undetected and it glows, but the flame hides the light. She'll use it to listen in. She can't see anything through it of course, but can hear.

Outside, she sees Klax is posturing, but is still feeling a bit threatened. How did Merregon find anything?! "I thought I ruled the entire river!" he says, speaking to another. "This is your fault!"

Oswen continues listening; she needs to use her spellbook's "fast cast" to get Comprehend Languages up quickly. The values are agreed now. But there's something else. A "rate", "10,000 per". Per what? Not said. Apparently the price has gone up to 11,000. "Take it or leave it! They are not as plentiful as they were the last time." "I might as well go and get them myself!" argues Merregon. "If you were able, you wouldn't be here! If you had the skills to write the contracts you wouldn't be buying them on *my* market. My final offer! Six souls for the lot. Not a single more."

They walk out holding six *scrolls*. Did she mis-hear? Maybe she heard wrong? But there was a talk of contracts. So, Merregon is buying scroll-written contracts for someone's soul. The equivalent rate was 10,000 presumed gold per soul, now 11; so the Trade Master got "paid" 66,000 as exchange for the haul.

Who writes the contracts?

She has fallen behind a bit and hurries to catch up. There's a general opinion of going to the bar, so we go with the flow. We hear that crew get rooms up *above* in the inn. It's getting darker; we head inside and try to find a corner out of trouble!

The bar is... Tense. Faux jovial noise from Klax as usual (well, some truly are drunk!); a bitter air from Merregon's crew; sat on opposite sides of the place. Merregon is unhappy in part because his crew readily accepted drinks from Klax; we suspect no crew is particularly loyal to their captain - it comes down to who's paying the most and who's buying drinks, perhaps.

Klax boasts about how much his next trip will bring in. "The moment the caravan arrives" is mentioned, so we figure - two days, then he'll be away as quick as he can. We most move quickly. "The richest of Brimstone Hold await!" he says.

Oswen is deep in thought. Very quiet. She's half listening, half deep in thought. At one point she mumbles that we should get food and drink and she'll have what they're all having. "Do you want to eat here?!" says Kindle. "No, but we should".

She's in a new place. Morally, she's profoundly conflicted. She is truly stuck for ideas or a workable plan. Anything we might do would seem to make things worse for anyone we care about. We've drawn too much attention to ourselves, but even so, the evil creatures here are so busy hating each other than they're really not watching us too closely. We don't know what a fight would look like, offence or defence; we have some gloves, some light clothes and a single potion as our only fire defence...

...and then the meals are finished, and she realises the others are telling us we should get to bed. She realises that we've even had some of the free drinks that Klax insisted. As we leave, she forces herself to nod a thank-you, as that seems the done thing. It won't impress Merregon, but she's fairly sure she doesn't want to anymore. If their wealth positions were reversed, she's become fairly sure that they'd each be acting just like the other is.

We head down the side tunnel; tensions seem to be rising. Not far to a fight. Loren is warning people. "Not in my bar!" - as she does that, Oswen feigns and stumble, bends to her footwear and uses Message; "We might not look it, but we are good in a fight. Do we stay?" The response - "Don't get involved! If it comes to it, Jemima has my back. I'll just kick them out soon!"

Back to the room then, as if nothing had happened.

Oswen walks in first, as the others trail behind. The door closes and Oswen lifts her staff, slams it down hard and shouts "DAMMIT!" - then apologises. "I just had to get that out. Sorry. It's been... One of those days."

Bel invites us to sit. He pulls out his lyre. He sings a tail of the coming of winter in the courts of the Fey; but this then goes to the loss of hope, but then the buds of spring, a tale of survival and rebirth. Towards the end, the door opens - stealthily at first - but then more. It seems we have been overheard. People are gathering outside. Bel gets more into it, aware he has a new audience! He is probably extending his story on the fly. A true bardic tale, an epic. Several minutes pass, in a grand arc.

There is clapping outside! He turns; "I didn't realise you were there..." - "It's great to have music again. We rarely hear things that are inspiring. Of course, the truth of fables isn't what they're about; it's how they make you feel and what they keep you believing. That's the power of these songs."

We are wished good night.

(As a result of his performance, the other three of us will awake with Heroic Inspiration - while Bel at least *feels* inspired, as do the others who listened at the door). Before bed, Oswen digs out a L2 scroll. It was in her backpack, not the scroll case. Strange. She doesn't remember buying that. Must've been overlooked somehow. It's a snowball spell! How useful. When did we get that? It just has a name written on the back; "McGuffin". How strange. She uses some ink (didn't we use all that up? There seems to be just enough left, though) to transcribe it to her spellbook.

We do choose to go on Watch.

* Kindle: He uses his magic to Create Water and fills everything we have. 8.
* Bel: Wakes up Kindle! Only 7!
* Oswen: Wakes up Bel. 14
* Inafina: 19



## Campaign day 16, Sigil day 5

Bel makes breakfast in the room. He gets some items from the market area and we eat well. There's tea; it's very hot even down here, but we're slowly adjusting, and it tastes good.

Oswen offers a vote. This is very dangerous and morally difficult. Do we proceed? A show of hands. Even Orvil raises a wing.

Breakfast is finished, cleaned up and packed.

We kick around plans. None of them look good. We only have fragments, at best. Then there's frantic pounding at the door - Inafina opens it; the tailor Tatoun and traer Bart are at the door. They look stressed. "What's wrong?" we ask. "Loren! Loren mentioned that you were capable fighters" - at this we all start to head for the door - "Walk and talk! Where are we going?!" - as we get to the corridor we see Jemima with staff in hand and a bag slung around her shoulder. She's wrapping for outdoors. "Trouble up top?" shouts Oswen. "Yes! We need help. We received a message from the caravan - Bart's friends - they're running for their lives! We need to help them!"

We run, partly dressing as we go. At the main gates a guard is looking with a spyglass, apparently without luck. "There! Yes!" shouts Jemima - "I hope you have water on you, we'll have to run!" - yes!

So, out we go, onto the dunes. The half-orc Bart describes between breaths that their caravan spotted people approaching their caravan last night while they were looking for a place to set up camp; they looked a long way away, but once the caravan stopped, it became obvious that these others were headed towards them. It turned into an overnight chase. "I don't know what is chasing them!" - he describes it as a pillar of fire!

Oswen Arcana 24; not enough information. Enough to know there are many things it could be. But if it can give chase overnight, it's not a natural thing and probably quite bad. Even powerful spell effects lasting that long are rare. She figures - no choice; play our hand. Orvil is sent up. He quickly sees the distant pillar of what seems to be smouldering rock... 25ft tall! It moves across the desert, close now to the caravan. Oswen calls out, "It's got close to them. Huge, 20, maybe 25ft tall. Some of the caravan is lagging. We must speed up somehow. Can anyone fly to intercept early?"

Jemima looks over at Inafina... "Sister - you and I - we must go". Inafina is scared to leave the group but doesn't hesitate. But rather than just run, Jemima grabs her hand and her feet seem to pick up like air - a swirl of wind around them both. It's like being carried by a zephyr. It's got a feel of wind walk, but not the same one she knows.

Oswen shouts to Bel, "We can't keep up, you should go ahead?" - but instead Bel casts FL3 Fly with his Bandore on Oswen. This doubles her speed. Kindle shouts, "Bel, run fast - I'll be close behind, don't you worry" - Bel goes at full 35 speed; Oswen's now up at 60 speed. Kindle starts dropping back at 30. Oswen shouts back over shoulder, "Don't be too late to the party, big guy!" - and Kindle then *runs*, really powers it, to try sprint; ATHL 19 - that's enough. He overtakes Bel!

Oswen's path is a little erratic, but still fast. Orvil is on her shoulder. She can see why he had trouble. Up here, we're subject to wild changes in wind from the magma river's effects. Fortunately, it's growing more distant.

Jemima, Oswen and Inafina lead. Kindle is doing a good job of going fast, Bel not far behind, Bart falling back - Oswen sees to her surprise that Tatoun is in the chase too. We just keep going as best we can. The flight at full speed takes about 5 minutes and crests a (fortunately not too tall!) dune. This gives them a good view. A few more minutes of flight yet. The caravan is starting to drag out. The creature? Some kind of fire giant, "dressed" in some kind of iron slag... And it's not the only problem. It is being followed at its ankles by what seem to be four flaming dogs of some kind. Hellhounds perhaps? Oswen's only read about any of this in books before! *And more...* Two goat-like creatures with very long legs, 6-7ft tall, short cloaks maybe of fur? - surrounded by flies. **And more...** A short distance behind is a really awful looking spiny demon toad (!) of some kind, 8ft wide and long that makes big clumsy jumps forward.

One wagon is in great danger. A sense of a gasp of despair from Jemima - "Demons! Demons! What? Why are they - what do they want?"

Oswen thinks about Sending to distract the giant from the closest wagon, which would require Sending given distance and language differences. That's an expensive play, but she tries it - hurling insults, goading the giant, implying we're too dangerous and valuable to ignore. Her Deception attempt isn't too great... 15 total... Its own roll in contest matches; but that does at least give it a moment of pause. It slows to look around and see where that came from. Better than nothing. She needs more. She throws up a Thunder Chromatic Orb directly above. It's a solid spell - 19 potential damage, had it been intended to hit anyone - and the clap of thunder is very loud. This actually frightens the wagons somewhat, but now everyone knows we're here!

It's enough. We're within maybe 200ft or so. Initiative is a strange collection:

* Oswen 18+2 -> 20
* Tatoun 18
* Jemima 15
* Bel 12
* Bart 12
* Inafina 4+8 -> 12
* Kindle 6+4 -> 10

Oswen acts first. She is 180ft away from the giant. She already has her Manifest Mind up, 60ft ahead. Scorching Ray, L2, for the two lead creatures in front of it; converted to cold; 7 damage for one; it doesn't seem harmed as much. Same again; again, only 3 damage. She shouts out a warning, "The two in front are resistant to cold!" and throws the third bolt at the giant, which hits very solidly but only 5 damage possible. It *does* at least seem to take that, but it's trivial hit even so. She's flying in fast.

She ask Orvil to fly up and check for anything else. Is this all we have to deal with? Keep an eye an eye on the *head* of the caravan as they continue to flee.

Tatoun is... A very long way away. We can't see what he's doing. Behind the ridge.

One of the lead creatures that Oswen just hit - barely - turns and changes course a bit, moving to intercept Oswen. *Perfect*. It doesn't run though; it sort of *leaps* 20ft, moving up quite a way, then runs. Oswen makes a mental note to keep high! Mental note too, we've only 10 mins on the fly spell. Only a minute or two of that left. As this curious creature lands, the horses and caravan, already apparently affected by it somehow, are affected more - biting insects, clouds of them! It spreads out as miasma, a cloud of insects, extending 30ft from it. It doesn't quite reach her but gets very close. But now it *acts* (not just moves), this time getting well within distance. **Oswen is enveloped by the swarm!**

Jemima runs up, getting close to Oswen, albeit nearly at ground level. She uses her action to carry Inafina with her. They both end up nearby... and have run directly into the cloud of insects, trying to reach the creature which generates them. She uses Stride, then elemental energy seems to be drawn - a crackling, low rumbling as wind is drawn around her. She rolls forward, ending up within 15ft of the strange aggressor and makes two strikes. As she strikes, she throws this strange crackling thunder that she's somehow collected in a sweep that, on impact, explodes thunderously. A literal Thundercat... Both attacks hit. There's also a brief flare of some kind of visible magical energy visible through the insect cloud, as some other effect is employed. Total damage, 18, all thunder plus STR save, which it fails; it is dragged closer to her.

Bart is also a long way away, and presumably running. Bel keeps going too.

Inafina CON save 1+1 -> 2. She takes 2 necrotic damage. She runs up a bit closer then tries her radiant bolt - hits, 11 radiant; takes it all, but not vulnerable. Then exactly the same rolls! She spends a Focus Point to repeat her actions, Hits, 8 damage; then scrapes a fourth hit - 10 - it falls. As it falls, it turns into a cloud of flies which dissipate. She runs forward as far as she can, passing underneath Oswen.

Kindle keeps powering along! Oswen can hear yelling in the distance.

The demon frog leaps forward, getting quite close to our group. It's not looking at the caravan anymore. It seems to be made of rotting flesh! A miasma of rot surrounds it. The three of us are all within 120ft - tries to scare Inafina, who is closest, by speaking to her telepathically. WIS save 17 - she recognises that this is the demon's ruse and is now immune to further attempts. She shouts back over her shoulder, "Be careful, this frog thing tries to get in your head!"

The hellhounds sprint past the frog - they *do* seem focused on the caravan still. The other of those two fly-cloud creatures runs close behind, and finally the giant comes up, now in the rear. It grabs hold of part of its own body - belches out a ball of magma - then throws it into the space between Inafina (on the ground) and Oswen (about 15ft up). The ball smells of sulphur - and decay. It explodes into a burning cloud of rot. DEX save - Inafina 4+8 -> 12 + d4 -> 4 -> 16 total, Oswen only 7. Inafina *just* dodges the worst, taking no damage. Oswen is caught up in the air by surprise. 14 necrotic, 18 fire. In one fell swoop, she's in *very* bad shape - only 13hp left.

In response, *L4* scorching on cold. Avoid the fly guy. Aims for the four hellhounds. First hits, 8 damage, 8 taken. Next is hit, 10 damage, then a miss, then hits the fourth for 7 damage. Now the giant. 26 hits easily, but only 7 damage. Now she flies *straight up*, 30 ft more, 45 ft above ground. Spellbook manifest mind is close. She shouts down, "hellhounds still chasing the caravan".

Tatoun runs!

Jemima calls back up, "Got it!" and then to Inafina, "I've got this side; have you got yours?" and Inafina shrugs - "Sure!" - as Jemima positions herself between two nearby Hellhounds - the one Oswen missed on the third ray, and the one Oswen hit on the fourth ray - and performs her own attacks. Hits one, misses one, Flurry, same again. They each get hit once, in practice; 11, 15 damage. The 15 is to the previously uninjured. Contested rolls mean that she manages to pull that previously uninjured one right in front of her.

Bart runs, Bel runs! Bel is shouting - we can hear him - he must've crested the dune. He keeps going, as fast as he can now down the tune (Dash). But he's still out of range for his spells.

Inafina does as asked - hits the leftmost hellhound, 8 damage; then again, only 7 damage. It's not looking great but she wants to keep going on them both so switches target with a Focus Point and hits twice again, but only 10 and 7 damage. Now she has to make a brave move; she runs up to the leftmost hellhound so that it *must* run from her threatened area to get past. The other has a line of sight to the caravan's trailing wagon but is slightly further away.

We hear Kindle also shouting from atop the dune and running as far as he can, as the trailing wagon continues its best effort to keep ahead.

The toad flops unpleasantly up to Jemima, next to the Hellhound she pulled close, then attacks - twice with claws and with a bite. Claw miss; claw hit -> 11 slashing; bite hit -> 22 piercing! She looks rough. The radiating stench looks like it'll be a problem too. Where's a Paladin when you need one?!

The other fly-goat-thing runs up to Inafina, jumping over and behind her but not flanking with the hellhound; it flicks a tail in attack. 17 just misses AC18. She sees spikes dripping with a strange putrid liquid - very diseased! - just narrowly swipes past her face, very close. She's in the cloud of flies now though. The hellhound alongside keeps trying to run for the caravan; with another Focus Point, Inafina tries a Stunning Strike opp attack; DC14 CON; and it fails and is stunned! Damage is good too - 12, only 1 away from max for unarmed strike.

The other sees this, stops pursuing the caravan and breathes fire at her! DEX save, 19. She avoids all of the fire (Evasion), but she's besieged. The hellhound runs up close.

The hellhound near the toad attacks Jemima, also with Pack Tactics but surprisingly misses. The other one makes a break for it. It sprints out towards the trailing wagon, and at full dash, manages to position itself in front, ready for an attack.

The giant advances, lumbering along, towards Inafina's group. It can reach Inafina over the hellhound at its feet with two morning star attacks... And both hit. 20 piercing damage on the first, plus 8 fire; 17 more on the second, plus enough fire damage to completely take her down. She falls at the feet of four formidable enemies.

Oswen watches in horror. For all the danger the creatures lower to the ground present, this giant has been horrendous - but it's within range of Banishment, coupled with moving the Manifest Mind. She casts her last L4, CHA 17 save - and crosses her fingers... She doesn't know it gets ADV on that saving throw. It rolls a 1 and an 11, with - and again she didn't think it could possibly be that high - a +5... 16. **Incredibly, it works.** The creature grins evilly at the approaching spell book; runes encircle it and for a second it seems to resist - then a moment of doubt - and *pop*. Gone.

She now retreats back shouting down, "Jemima! I have to avoid injury to hold the giant away! Our friends are close! Hang in there!"

Tatoun appears from nowhere pretty much and manages to get in the face of the hellhound that was blocking the wagon. He can't attack, but he presents another target. Jemima is immune to poison; the frog's stench is awful but it's not actively harmful. She elects to take down the hellhound first. Unarmed strikes - both hit. The damage of 12 and 7 is not enough - it's a way off still. Another Flurry. Miss, *hit*; a solid 12 damage - *that* is enough. She's right next to the frog. She dances around the frog, trying to get closer to Inafina. As she leaves the frog's area it misses with a bite attempt. It's knowingly in the middle of two hellhounds and fly-goat creature and right admits its cloud of flies.

Bart crests the dune, at long last; he can't see the giant but sees Jemima threatened. It's not clear what he thinks, at this, as Oswen is far away looking as if she's running (albeit very injured), burned clothing and skin, and the others of our group are still not there yet. Jemima he sees is barely visible in a cloud of flies and crouched over someone apparently dead. And Tatoun of all people is trying to fight a Hellhound! He heads for Tatoun.

Bel *finally* makes it to a useful range. He throws Bardic Inspiration at Oswen and seeing she's very injured shouts up, "I'm sorry, I have to head for Inafina!" as she shouts down simultaneously, voices overlapping, "Please run and help Inafina!". Bel gets to around 70ft away.

Inafina: Permitted an unconscious CON save is dirty 20, so she doesn't get an automatic fail for the miasma effect; but her death save is bad anyway. D20->2, fail.

Kindle powers into the fray. He's within 120ft of pretty much everything in play at that point but seeing the big frog, at *just* within 60ft max range for melee weapons from him, brings up his Spiritual Weapon there. L4, for 3d8+4 damage. He attacks the frog with the spatula, hitting for 16 radiant damage. In retaliation, it jumps forward a full 60ft itself, landing right in front of Kindle. The wagon trailing keeps going; the horse gets scratched by the now-harried and distracted wolf, so freaks out but that just makes it run faster!

The goat fly creature attacks Jemima with its poisoned tail - but misses. The previously stunned hellhound shakes it stunned condition and tries to attack her too; pack tactics; hits; 6 piercing, 4 fire. She's only just hanging on, but now the *other* hellhound has its own try. She dodges both hits. The last one, which just tried for the horse, attacks Tatoun - no pack tactics - amazingly, it misses (rolled a 2 against an AC of 12).

Oswen looks to Jemima; she sees a badly hit Hellhound and the goat-fly creature. She aims L3 Lightning damage via Scorching Ray at the more injured hellhound, hits twice and it does go down. Her other two attacks are on the goat-fly creature but this is resistant to lightning too, taking only 3, 4 damage from the two hits. She sees Bel in trouble and knows that he might lose Fly - she'd fall - so she gets as far out as she can between the two areas of battle and lands.

Tatoun tries to hit the hellhound and misses, while Jemima takes no damage via CON save. She faces now one hellhound and the goat-fly (Bulezau) creature, but they're neither that badly injured and she certainly is. She tries to stun the Bulezau; hits; CON save and it fails, so it's stunned. It takes 8 damage, too. The second strike, aims then, for the Hellhound; two more via Flurry - but in her injured state, somehow, every single attack misses!

Bel needs to run. He's too far to help. But the frog is next to him... He might be able to *just* help Jemima but Inafina is too far, maybe? Hard to tell in the rush of battle - he just has to risk it. He runs. The frog tries a bite as he heads away and decisively hits (he has his back turned!) - 8 piercing - but he Mirthful Leaps away. He casts L3 Healing Word for Inafina, 17hp (bonus action) and adds in a Cantrip, throwing Starry Wisp - a mote of light flies towards the Hellhound. It hits! 12 radiant damage. "Inafina, are you OK?!" "I am now!"

So she's up. She gets her staff onto the Hellhound and hits it; 14 damage, it falls. She pulls away from the stunned Bulezau; hits it with a radiant attack for 7 damage; then a point spent & two more attempts - she gets two more hits - 8 and 13 damage. And it goes down!

Kindle faces the horrible demon toad. The smell doesn't cause him injury either. "Is she up? Is she OK?" he calls; "She's up!" shouts Bel. So Kindle, with renewed vigour, pulls the spiritual weapon 20ft closer - best he can do - and swings his mace. He *just* hits, meeting AC, dealing 4 damage (!) but gets 7 more via Divine Strike. He also throws a Healing Word at the horse of the departing trailing wagon, 8hp, which picks up pace a bit. He shouts to Tatoun - "Don't let that dog get near 'em!" - but now, the frog attacks Kindle in return. The bite misses as he dodges; the claw, too; but the last claw swipe finds its mark for 13 damage. He holds concentration on his spell.

Bart has joined Tatoun now. The hellhound is taking the bait and they're distracting it; and it attacks the new arrival Bart, dealing 4 piercing and 9 fire damage. Oswen gets a line of sight on the Hellhound, staying on the ground; 7, 9, 5 cold damage via a converted Scorching Ray. Tatoun flanks with Bart and attacks with his short sword, emboldened by Oswen's hits, doing - 3 damage. Well, it's more than nothing. Oswen backs away on the ground as far as she can.

Jemima runs up towards the frog and dashes closer, within 15ft; and with her bonus action she's able to use a thunder first attack. Hit, crit fail (!) - 13 damage. She tries to pull it towards her too. A risky move given her state. She's moved and pulled it just out of range of the stench.

Bart's turn on the hellhound. Hit, but only 4 damage... Enough to take it down. Enthused, he runs to attack the demon frog, flanking with Jemima, hitting and getting in 9 more damage.

Bel sends out another Wisp. It's a solid hit, for 10 radiant damage. He sends Bardic Inspiration to Inafina. She runs over, dashing a bit, and gets in two radiant hits, 10 and 6 damage. Kindle calls the weapon closer still - and it's in range, flanking with Bart. The weapon hits, 15 damage. Then he runs in and swings with the mace, hitting thanks to the flanking advantage (else attack roll was 1!) dealing 9 with another Divine Strike.

The frog now acts. It attacks each of three corporeal creatures in front of it. Misses Kindle with a bite. Claw hits bart; he takes 13 damage and now looks messed up. A claw against Jemima thankfully misses. Now it tries to jump away, but this *does* attract three opportunity attacks. It tries to leap on top of Tatoun!

Jemima opp attack hits; stun attempt; and it works; so the frog falls to the ground just out of range of her and short of its target. But as she's doing that, Kindle is swinging with his mace and using Divine Strike again. CRIT. A very good 25 damage. Bart has a go too; he just makes it; another 1 rolled, only 4 damage, but he's the one - again - that deals the killing blow. So the frog splats down near Tatoun but as it lands, dissolving into a pool of puss. A most awful noise! Tatoun turns away in disgust.

Combat over.

Oswen waves people away at first as they come up close even though she's a mess and hurting; she's muttering the spell incantation out loud over and over, until she feels it complete. Then she is finally able to relax. "It worked... It's gone." Kindle uses the time to cast a L3 Mass Healing Word, which completes a little while after Oswen's spell. 9hp goes into everyone! And this time - we certainly need it.

Oswen and Inafina are at roughly half health. Messy. Oswen calls over to Tatoun at this, finding it in herself to laugh a bit - "I'm sorry, we've already ruined your new clothes!" "I will fix them for no charge!"

Orvil warns Oswen that the caravan is still fleeing at full tilt so Bart and Tatoun give chase trying to flag down the last one and pass on the message.
