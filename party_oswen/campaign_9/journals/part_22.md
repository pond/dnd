# Oswen: Part 2.22
## Campaing Day 50
### Theros, city of Akros, 8pm

It's time for food! Bel spotted a place he wanted to visit earlier - the **Philosopher's Table** - and we head straight there. We're welcomed and taken upstairs to a balcony area with a great view of the darkening sky. Stars are just starting to appear.

As we're seated and wait for dinner, Oswen muses about how similar (even if different) the worlds and places we have visited are. Familiar names of vegetables and animals on menus. Similar concepts of inns and taverns. Familiar races, on the whole. Here, there's a myth that humans, specifically, were created here but that seems unlikely; humans are all over, including on surely-older worlds.

This idea that Vecna once caused the Lady of Pain to "reset" everything is certainly lent some weight by that idea **and in turn that gives us deeper insight into just how much we might stand to lose**. Perhaps once, all worlds were far more varied in races and nature; but then things got reset, with only Sigil left as a place of people and ideas to restart from. Since then, things have diverged and new ideas of course emerge; but all this would be lost again should another reset be forced.

The night is quiet and warm. The sounds of passers-by are interrupted periodically by the march of groups of four soldiers on patrols. We eat quietly as the moon rises over the ocean.

Inafina ADV perception 23. Little conversation about the Leviathan and more general philosophies. Almost pretentious, but it seems sincere. There *is* conversation about the vote here though. Each table is an isolated island of agreement; different tables of course have different stances. Inafina mentions some of it to Oswen.

Oswen at one point leans back in her chair and declares, loudly, to her table, "It's quite strange, of course; if the Leviathan threat is real, then it's a titan - and old god - the idea of a military response having any impact is, surely, laughable. I can't quite understand why we're forced into this false dichotomy; for my money, it is those people I would turn to" - and she points to the temples - "as the only ones who may truly understand or be able to help, if this a matter of the gods!"

Inafina is watching tables carefully for reactions. There's a negative reaction since she's "uncouth" and loud. Conversation dips, though, as people *do* listen. And Inafina notices that it's steered conversation after that. Some agree, some disagree. Some are of the belief that the council and priesthood are the same - same coffers, same family members and so-on! - but *one* table, a smaller one of four like ours, has been quieter and Inafina concentrates on them as a result.

"It's good to see there are young people these days with some sense about them! God-fearing people who haven't forgotten that all these modern trappings and technology. a feeling that we're in control of our fates, is an illusion; we have as little control as ever before. Even the gods themselves are subject to fate! Free will is an illusion. We must pray to the gods for their wisdom!"

A couple of tables mention an oracle, too. That's specifically related to the **Temple Of Clotho**. "If *anyone* knows, surely the devotees at the Temple of Clotho would know."

The final bill is terrifying, especially given it includes a gratuity. Party funds to the rescue! Still - very good food.

It's late now, after a long and relaxed dinner. We head back to the room to sleep. "Look!" says Bel - bathrobes for all. "They're in our sizes!" he says, delighted.

Before bed, Oswen casts Detect Thoughts on the magic carpet. ARC 25. She has no particular expectations, but is surprised to hear - "Yes? What did you want me to do?" - as if the Detect Thoughts had woken it up. It's reacting physically. "Are we going somewhere?" Oswen answers, "I'm sorry to disturb you but wondered if we could talk this way. Do you have a name?" There is a significant delay with no response. Then, "Carpet?" - but that's probably just what we call it. She says, "Pleased to meet you carpet. If you need to talk to me in this way because there's something you want us to understand that you can't otherwise tell us, tap on my shoulder with your - a - with - with any corner!" "Yes. The furry one understands me. But I will tap your shoulder if I need to." "Sleep well, carpet!" "Sleep? Oh. Yes, unconscious!" - and it flops down onto the floor like a normal rug.

This is *very* strange. She knows about sentient magic items, but they tend to have very strong personalities and be quite intelligent. The carpet seems to be sentient, but "felt" more like a loyal dog or something of that ilk. Not some righteous sword, cruel hand or scheming eye! This item has control over its physical being somewhat, too, and perhaps they all would but for physical restrictions. A sword cannot really move! She did see the Hand act "by itself" during Velindra and Arkhan's fight, though. The carpet *does* seem to "deactivate" or sleep, so it's not ever-vigilant like some Constructs.

### Middle of the night

That night, WIS saves:

* Oswen - 22
* Kindle - nat 20 + 9
* Bel - nat 1 WITH ADVANTAGE - nat 1 twice! - 0
* Inafina - 12

Oswen and Kindle wake in the middle of the night to the sound of yelling; we each have our own bedroom in this huge suite so the two both run into the main area together, hearing that the yelling is coming from Bel's room, but there are thumping noises - like alarm thumps of feet - from Inafina's. Oswen says to Kindle, "You check on Inafina" and she runs into Bel's room.

Bel is in bed, yelling and thrashing around, kicking the end of the bed hard. All the sheets and pillows have been thrown off. She tries to reach him to shake him awake but gets hit by the thrashing Bel, taking 3 damage! It *does* wake him up at least; he grabs hold of her; "We must run! It's too late! Wait... Why are you here? Where did you come from?", and to try and help convince him, she uses Message rather than just speaking; "Bel, it's me. It's Oswen". "You must run! You can't get trapped in here as well!" "You're not trapped in here. It's the suite." "No, the shadows! They're coming..." - he has a wild look to his eyes and runs for the door, dagger drawn; Oswen tries to hold him back, casts Intellect Fortress for him, then asks him to look again - "You were asleep and something bad happened. I just woke you up. We're in the suite, in that hotel" - but it doesn't seem to help (ADV WIS save 10,11).

She thinks - maybe go along with it. "OK, so if there's danger, show me. Let's find it together."

He says, "The dead are following us. We're not in the hotel Oswen. Don't let them fool you! I know where she is. Serena! Have you forgotten why we're here? And if this *is* the hotel, where are the other two?!"

Oswen smiles. "In the other room! Kindle was helping Inafina. Come with me, I'll show you."

Meanwhile, Inafina was having a dream, walking with friends but sneaking ahead to scout things out. Around a corner, she sees a doorway from which darkness is emanating; the end of someone's cloak disappears into it. She runs to see if it's likely to close, but can't figure that out, then doesn't want to leave the group so runs back to them but they're not there. Then she sees Bel wander, trance-like, through that doorway. So now she runs after Bel. This takes her through the doorway and she's suddenly on a cliff in a dark place, but with a deep purple sky; no stars, sun or moon, no clouds and no wind. A glistening dark ocean far below looks accessible by stone stairs going down the cliff; a boat has just cast out. It has a single lantern and someone stands holding it; someone sits in front - too dark to make them out but might have horns, could be Bel; she "runs on the wind" in her boots, ignoring the stairs, straight towards the boat.

The person with the lantern is punting. The sea must be very shallow. The person in front is indeed Bel. As she gets close the person with the lantern does not react at all. But Bel seems mesmerised too; he's looking in the water; and she sees shimmering faces and images in there, people from her childhood - which seems impossible. Why would Bel look at that, though? He's talking to himself under his breath; it's as if he's talking to people in the water, perhaps, one half of a conversation. He's leaning further and further over the boat, looking into the water.

She gets close and gives Bel a bit of a shake. He 'wakes up' and immediately says "...But you haven't been invited sister, it's just Mama and me! You're supposed to stay at home. You're not even dressed for it. We'll need to fix that! You really shouldn't be coming with us." "Where are we going?" "To the court! It's my big day. Don't you try and ruin it for me! Your day will come."

She can't figure out what to do. She looks at the person moving the boat. A skeletal arm holds out a lantern, yet two hands grip the punt pole, pushing. She can't make out much more; they're covered in a cloak. There's a book in a chain which a *fourth* arm. Two people? She says, "Can I have a look at the book?" - no response - so she reaches out as if to touch it. Immediately yet *another* skeletal hand reaches out from the robe and grabs her hand, stopping her from reaching further. Then one more tries to push her away. She doesn't get moved by it, but moves back of her own accord. Those two hands retract back into the cloak.

She tries throwing a Sunburst 150ft forward, looking back at the punter and at the sea, too. There's the blinding flash; and the shrieking sounds - not from the punter, but from all around the boat. The punter has a skeletal face but no body! It's just darkness and shadow. Lots of hands were reaching out from the water and retract back; all the Harengon faces she'd seen warp and twist, into almost proto-demonic shapes; almost just blobs, barely with form. There are other boats in the distance too. This the she grabs Bel and turns him to face her. She says, "We must fly. It isn't safe. Cast fly for us. Now!" - he reaches around - but then goes, "Where's my stuff? Wait, where are my clothes?!" - and at that, his clothes disappear... OK, she suspects a dream now! But whose? How much is real?

She does her best to grab him and pick him up - she can struggle airborne on the boots, but only just; arms are reaching up, grabbing Bel's feel - and now she feels restrained too, the arms grabbing her...

...but they're big and furry and well built, and a voice is telling her to calm down and wake up.  Kindle. She says, "Bel! Bel's on the boat. We have to save him!" Kindle says, "It's just a dream!" - but she slips past him to head for Bel's room to make sure. "Inafina's sleepwalking!" shouts Kindle. "I'm *not* asleep!" she calls back. At that moment, Oswen and Bel are coming out of their room too. Inafina says, "Bel! Were you on a boat?" "They got you! Wait, I thought you got away; I got dragged; they dragged us all down here into this hotel illusion..."

To try and prove a point, Kindle tries using Turn Undead - a 30ft radius sphere of light bursts outwards. But at this, a strange shadow that we now see was wrapping Bel peels away, like hands letting go, just as he said; and we become aware of spirits being held at bay just outside it. Oh. So he wasn't *entirely* wrong! Oswen says, "Um I'd better check outside..." - she goes to look at the town; people are walking around the streets aimlessly. Some are in night clothes; others are trying to wake them. No, not aimless! They're all walking in one particular direction.

She hurries back - "we have to go, something *really* weird is happening and it's happening *that way*" - she points - "and we should go!"

We grab some kit as quick as we can, but not everything, Inafina's 'woken' the carpet and we hop on and fly.

There must be 100 or so people, awake or otherwise, walking upwards. They're headed to a temple. Inafina says, "Well, that's good, at least it's not the sea..." - which makes Oswen look beyond the temple, and she says - "oh, but I think that temple perches on a cliff, doesn't it?"

We need to get ahead, so fly as fast as we can to get a line of sight to the sea, ahead of the temple. People fortunately aren't throwing themselves off! They get to the temple steps in the front and then seem to just stop. Inafina says, "I'd better just check..." - and throws another sunburst, to see if there are any more of those shadows. And there are, all over the city; it's covered in them.

She gets Bel to help with ideas of things to look at in the Theros book, just in case there's anything there! Shadows, gods, interference... ADV INV, 29; there's a snippet. A horror legend; on the night of a full lunar eclipse, return of the damned, coming to claim their vengeance. To right wrongs. Dead walking 'among the sleeping', which sounds about right. There's nothing of practical use in there; something about a rite being underway, the "night fully declared", the dead use the sleeping to do their bidding - fulfil unfinished business.

Inafina perception 20, it *is* getting darker; the moon is falling into shadow. But at that moment a priestess emerges from the temple. Raven black hair, holding a crook and with a bell. We move down so that we can hear what she might say.

She starts speaking in a language that sounds like one of prayer. Oswen casts Tongues. She's not talking to the living, she's talking to the dead! Sounds like a rite - that's very not good - "enact their will upon the debased, extravagant and wasteful and sinful citizens of Akros" - that kind of thing. But if she finishes these rites and "declares the night"... "Should I do it again? Turn undead?" asks Kindle. We have to get lower, so we do; and he invokes the spell again.

Screeching, hands letting go; but we can't do this all day; Inafina just starts sending off sunbursts, deliberately high, but just trying to disrupt the approach of any more of these undead creatures. The priestess is infuriated but Oswen is thinking, *when I'm casting a verbal spell and Silence is used, it stops the spell working* so she asks, "Does anyone have Silence?" - Kindle does but is busy. Bel has another idea, casting Mantle Of Majesty on himself and then starts to sing an oratory. The recently-freed audience is becoming enraptured, which seems to be going from one influence to another; trying to hold them in place, then he Commands them to grab anyone else they can, protect them from themselves. And to those in front, pointing at the priestess, he says, "Stop her!"

The priestess is shocked and starts to back away. She starts to cast a spell of some kind and Oswen's not having any of that - no idea if it's good or bad, she won't risk it! - so Counterspells, successfully. The people at the front of the crowd are now able to grab the priestess. "Cover her mouth! Don't let her say anything!" shouts Bel. He turns to Inafina. "Can you secure her?!" - Inafina 'runs' down off the carpet with some rope from one of our hastily-grabbed bags and ties her hands.

"Tell me! How do we stop this from happening? How do we stop it?!" he asks of the Priestess, but she just shakes her head. Her mouth is released and Bel tries again, "How do we stop this insanity?" - but she starts to laugh. "You can't stop it. The moon is being devoured and in the darkness that ensues, all the dead are free - free to finish and enact their vengeance. Tonight the underworld rules the overworld."

Oswen thinks about the book, which seemed to think a rite had to be spoken and completed. She mentions it, but the priestess says, "You think I am the *only* servant of Erebos?" (the god of the dead and the ruler of the underworld) "You can't be everywhere at once! What hope do you have to stop us, in the city of temples? The city of the gods?"

We probably have up to 10 minutes until the moon is occluded. Unless it *stops*, the eclipse itself might only last 20-30 minutes tops, but that's plenty of time for damage.

Oswen calls to the crowd, "Does anyone know which god principally opposes Erebos?"

Heliod, brother of Erebos, apparently; "nearest temple?!" - they point - or there's the temple to Erebos himself, the imposing one in the city mausoleum. Inafina recognises it from her dream. She says to Oswen, "I think inciting conflict between gods we do not understand is unwise; perhaps Erebos for his own opinion?" - so with the crowd looking after the priestess we jump onto the carpet and head directly for that temple. It'll take a few minutes though. Getting close, we see a significant crowd has already gathered. There, *three* clerics stand at the temple entrance, reciting rites. We certainly can't be everywhere at once... And the crowd is far too big for Kindle to handle. We bypass them! Fly *into* the temple.

Inafina feels like she's been here before. "Just a dream - well, sort of..." says Oswen. Bel says the same thing. And there was Serena; Bel says, "She was on the shore, waiting for a boat. She said she was going to challenge Erebos."

The carpet can *just* fit through the entrance by curling up its sides.

There are other priests here, running along corridors as they see us shouting, "Hey, you can't be in here! This is Erebos' temple!" "Well we need to speak to him!" "You can't just walk in and speak to the god of death!" "No! That's why we *flew* in!"

Inafina points - "There, the door!" - it seems that the less moonlight shines on the city, the larger and more tangible the portal becomes. Oswen says, "Best hope the amulet works from inside there, or it might be a long stay!" - and guns it, straight for the door.

There is disarray and lots of shouting, but we ignore it all. We fly straight in. On the other side - a dream become reality; a mass of spirits all backed up in a vast queue, some flitting through but most unable to fit. Behind us, the portal is massive, stone, atop a long cliff with many stairs and slopes that these dark spirits crowd, with the shallow sea below. From this new vantage point we can now see a mountain, a dark silhouette, spots of light on it, a temple on the summit; seems that's where we need to go.

We're down here to try and stop bad things happening in the city, but Oswen remembers Bel saying Serena was down here and it's starting to look like some of this dream stuff might be part true, so, she was probably headed to this temple as well. We don't know what she looks like - except Bel does; he remembers his dream clearly (as does Inafina). "But we're not going to find her in this crowd!" he says, pointing down to the mess of demons now falling behind us. She was waiting for a boat. We think we're moving quite fast but, speaking of boats, we are passed by one below!

INT-based SUR for Oswen, 19. We're certainly *leaving* the gate but we aren't getting closer to the other side! The boats are pulling away from us quite obviously now. Oswen tries to get the carpet down low, close to the water and get to a boat. But the carpet simply can't catch up. And Oswen is sure that we're not getting closer to the far shore. HIS, dirty 20. This was in the book; the only way to cross the sea is to be picked up by a boatman? Ah! **The sea of memory** - that must be it. Sounded like nonsense! She assumed it was just a myth, or child's story.

We turn around and head towards the shore; we can't really go anywhere from here; but now we're not sure how to get across. Check the book - ADV INVEST 31. How do we get a boat? People buried with copper pieces in their mouths to pay the boatman. Well, the boatman expects a payment, at least, in some form. It doesn't take long to get to shore - crowded with souls trying to get out; Bel points at a throng of people, which is where he thinks he saw Serena; and kinda like fools we put copper pieces in our mouths and Oswen throws one into the sea for good measure. Whichever thing did it, a boat rises up out of the water and heads towards us, pulling up to shore.

Oswen mutters an incantation; Intellect Fortress, L6, for everyone.

Four skeletal hands outstretch from the darkness of the cloak; we put the copper pieces in; then an extra pair appears, opens a book connected by a chain to "inside it"; flips through, each coin put into the book and those change into script, but she can't see details as the book faces away; she pops up Manifest Mind to get a better look - the whole book is filled with copper-coloured script. Their names are written; each coin has turned into a full name.

A plank extends. We are beckoned into the boat and board hastily. It pushes the boat away as the plank is drawn back and away we go. The lantern is drawn.

"I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can and if it's possible, make haste, please!" says Inafina. "We need to get there quickly!"

No reaction.

Bel moves to the bow. Inafina calls him back. "I'm trying to see where I'm going!" he says and Inafina says, "You *know* - it's that temple! You can't risk looking at the water!" - she can already hear the voices. She says out loud, "I know it's not real - I can hear them. You can hear them. We all can, and we all hear different things. These people are not just dead, but they're not on this plane. If their souls exist anywhere, it'll be the infernal - or the celestial - of our *own* planes."

Bel starts to look over the edge - Kindle *picks him up* and sits him back in the boat!

WIS saving all round, ADV from the Intellect Fortress casting.

* Bel - 17 (success)
* Kindle - 18
* Oswen - 21
* Inafina - 22

We're tempted, but not enough to lose ourselves. The opposite shore looms close. We don't really know how much time has passed. In the far distance are more lamp lights, but they each look improbably distant. The geometry of it all makes no sense.

"I'd pop in Orvil to help, but I'm afraid he might be considered a stowaway that didn't pay!"

We can see a zig-zag stone path leading up the mountain; pillars with braziers at the base. Spirits are flitting around here, leaving the water, flying across and even *through* us on the boat. CHA saves for this! But this time, we get low rolls even with ADV again...

* Bel - OK
* Kindle - OK
* Oswen - only 10 plus bardic D10 as Bel notices things going not so well, but only 2 -> 12
* Inafina - only 12 (blows Heroic too, but nat 2 - no good!)

Inafina starts to *forget* her history. A sense of self sliding away. But it's strange, there's almost a feeling as if she *succeeded*. A connection with the universe. Oswen feels like something is disappearing but it's not something she - knew? She didn't have a memory much before the Fey Wild, but *something* is drained away. Can't even say what it is.

Kindle and Bel exchange glances; they can clearly see Oswen and Inafina look suddenly kinda glazed over and confused; Kindle casts Greater Restoration on Oswen. That does *something*, the classic 'fog lifting' feeling; a thread of something slipping away that she catches; she sees the same look on Inafina's face. What's the magic?! ARC 31! Kindle's spell can remove charms, fear, or end a curse; so this is curse-like, must be; and she tries Remove Curse (albeit at L4, since her L3s are all exhausted). That does it! Suddenly there are visible threads between Inafina and the water but they break, and retreat back into her. She looks briefly panicked, but then relaxes a bit - as the memories are returning.

Bel frets, trying to figure out how to help stop this happening again but before he can do much we're at the shore. We realise there was a strange, numbing effect, a calming while on the sea; and then suddenly we feel something that's not fear, it's more... Deep seated terror! We look up to an imposing mountain, path and temple, surrounded by the dead. The boatman floats to the shore and helps us off the boat. It pushes out and sinks down away into the water.

It looks like a big climb. Thousands of steps! Inafina tries walking up a bit and she does seem to be able to make progress but only for a moment - after a short distance she stops moving. The carpet probably won't help.

Oswen says, "If time here passes the same as outside, we've already lost any chance to help the city. All we can do is press on and see if there *was* anything to do with Serena here, but we're obviously in way, way over our heads. This is going to take a long time."

We get under way. There are many pillars along the way. Each is engraved with symbols representing traits - virtues - things that are part of life experience. Oswen just looks grumpy. "It's heavy handed, don't you think?" she says. "I mean, yes, I get it. Maybe I'll be more patient when I'm dead!" Bel nods, "A grim version of the afterlife! Ritualistic. Depressing..."

Inafina and Oswen get no insight (rolled total 10 each), Bel low also. But Kindle - his wisdom gets him an insight of 22. He understands it all more. A question of what is important. There are no answers; it's what you bring to it. Concepts of family and love and loyalty, for examples. The myths of this place, it seems, might have this all as neither positive nor negative, intrinsically; it's how you view it. Families as a source of strife, or of support.

Kindle says that he thinks - we need to keep walking until we understand ourselves. "But we haven't died! We're not weighing up the measure of our lives."

The temple looks closer than we expect as we turn a corner. The stairs head straight up towards it on a final stretch. Oswen raises an eyebrow. "I think someone heard you. He's right! We haven't died. Yet! Our time will come of course, but for now, if we're measuring anything, it's how much time we have before Vecna screws everything over and we want to do something about that."

Perception all round... Suddenly, Kindle goes, "WOAH!" and pulls us back; perception 29 - spots a shadow just in time. A huge, 20ft high at the shoulders, 3 headed-dog stalks out and turns to look at us. A head says, "You do not belong here. You are not of the passed."

"We are not. But we have business here. And in particular, if possible, seek an audience with Erebos."

Another head snarls and growls. "Only those who have passed can see the god of the dead! This is is his realm. You have intruded upon it. You break the rules! How did you cross the sea?"

Oswen says, "We paid our way. We were conveyed and are here rightfully on that basis, at least; we intend of course no disrespect."

The dog suddenly looks behind itself and - well, sort of cowers! We see a very tall figure, also some 20-something-foot tall, coming around from behind the three-headed dog. He puts his hand on one head to steady it. "It is true. They have broken no rule. They have followed protocol" he says, then turns to look at us. A very beautiful, serene face regards us, albeit at giant scale; very handsome, ageless; long white hair; beautifully crafted vestments; carries a book. Undoubtedly, this is Erebos themselves. "Well, don't lurk at the entrance. Come in. You've come a long way to see me. But I must ask - why?"

We follow into the temple. Oswen answers, "If I speak out of turn, I apologise; we are unfamiliar with the customs and etiquette expected at a meeting such as this."

"You are not of my people."

"No. And so, we were most alarmed when a lunar eclipse became due and spirits started to swarm the city of Akros. There was talk of, well, it sounded rather like revenge."

"Yes. There are those who claim to worship me up there, who seem to think I'm a vengeful, violent and evil god. I am not. They don't do my bidding. But I have no power up there; my authority lies here, in this land. There is no benefit to me in having the dead leave!"

"Seems reasonable and we did manage to stop one, but there are many others; and we're not sure if we can close that portal - or even if we should."

"I can close it. But I was curious to see how it would play out. I was curious to see what her next move would be."

Oswen says, "Do you speak of Serena, the Child of Fate?"

He turns, looking a bit surprised. "Not much gets past you. I know her by a different name - but yes, she is the Child of Fate. But are not *all* of the mortals Children of Fate? We tried to give them free will - self determination - but our powers were held in check by the Moirai, who ultimately have the last laugh... You realise, everything that my brothers and sisters have created is all a bit of a masquerade. We don't have any *real* power. We exist merely to explain the paradox of this push and pull between predetermination - the Moirai - and the wilfulness of self determination, that belief that one has control over their future and their actions. Trying to make sense of that has always been the human condition. It defines mortality. And that in turn defines us. You know, there are some blasphemous writings that claim *we* didn't create the mortals at all!" - he leans in (from 20ft!) down to her eye level - "some claim, *they* created *us*!" and smiles, as if the philosophy is interesting. "What do you think?"

Oswen thinks a moment - then says, "To quote something I read, what do I think? Therefore I am. It's a misquote, and probably a bad joke in the way I've used it, but the idea is this - how do I know I exist? Well, I have a concept of self, so that alone defines existence. You exist, you think. So you exist. Your origin, some say, is because others believe in you. But that doesn't answer the question, because in that case who believed in *them*? Someone created something somewhere to start it all and nobody's ever been able to figure out who that was. Or what that was. At the very start. The very first one."

"So you don't believe in the Cult of the Mother? Neither do I."

"And yet, I hear the Leviathan stirs; in fact, all the Titans do."

"Exactly! What better way to prove that your will is greater than that of the gods, than to release the Titans - upend the divine order that has been set for centuries. Prove that no god can write your story. Prove that one mortal can change the course of history. I don't think she's one of ours. I think she's like you. I don't think she's from here. That's why she doesn't care what happens. It's all a bit of a spectacle! She offered to free me from my duty. I've had long debates with her over the years. She comes and visits me sometimes. You know that's a *rare* treat. I don't get repeat visitors; I see everyone - once. But not her. She threatened to release everybody because I complained to her that I felt trapped by my duty in one of our long debates. I was trying to explain that even *I* was beholden to the Moirai; that my duty and my fate was written. She said, 'What if I could prove that not to be true?'. Find her, and you can stop all this from happening."

"And do *you* want it to stop?"

"I admit I'm curious what the outcome would be! But I don't like playing her games. Ultimately, I don't trust her. I think she has a secret. I don't know what it is. Everyone has *some* weakness. I just don't know hers. But maybe you could find out. Why *are* you here?!"

"Well, we were hoping to stop things going wrong 'up top' at the city, but also my friends Bel and Inafina here got drawn into a dream that looks like it had some truth and Bel saw Serena, as we know her, coming here. So in a sense, we gave chase; and we're here for those two reasons. It sounds like she's long left, though."

"She hasn't visited me in a few days. Not since she threatened to do - *this*. So you've come here to stop my dead from overrunning the surface world?"

"A lofty goal, I admit; but - yes!"

"I can make that happen. Why should I make that happen, though? You're a mystery! And I like mysteries - only to a point. Only insofar as I can solve them."

"Would you like to know where we're from? Or is th..." - but she doesn't finish that; he says, "Yes" before she finishes and adds, "You've told my why you're *here* currently, here in my realm, but why are you here at all?"

So we explain about Vecna, Kas, the Moirai, all of it. And at this, we are offered a bargain. "If you help me with this mystery with Serena, I will help you. I have knowledge of the path through to the realm of the Moirai. I will tell you where it is; how to reach them. But I'll also tell you this - Serena will not go willingly, if at all! Not to the Moirai. For they seek to unmake her. She is the greatest thorn in their side. She refuses to play by their rules and they have no power over her, for whatever reason. She is able to evade capture; elude their senses; defy their decrees."

"So what do we find for you?"

"She has a secret that could be used against her. But isn't that the infuriatingly delicious paradox of a secret? I don't know what it is! I haven't a clue!"

"Well, we can't guarantee that we will find it out. And we understand that if we do not, you will not show us the path. But, we *can* guarantee that we'll certainly try our best. If I were to invoke a Divination ritual, if you know of it, under your name, would you hear it?"

"If you address it to me, I will respond. You must however present my fruit in offering. It is the only thing that can pierce the veil." (It's a pomegranate!).

**"Then I accept your generous offer!" announces Oswen.**

A scroll is produced. Oh no! This again... He signs it with a flourish, then hands it to her. "Do you need a quill?" "No thank you, I have my own!" - but she takes a moment to read it first! It seems forthright. She can't see any traps. It's not a deal with a devil - it's a deal with, well, not death; the god *of* the dead. A deal with a god. That seems OK! **She signs**.

He rolls the scroll, breaks it in two and suddenly that makes two copies. "You'd better make it back; she's in the city somewhere; don't let her escape! Find out her secret!"

He draws an archway in front of him and a doorway appears. And then he motions with his hand to the opposite shore; that doorway closes.

"Thank you" says Oswen. "If I do get the chance, and am able, I'd be happy to return sometime to talk more. A most interesting line of conversation!"

"Fascinating talking to you as well, traveller. You can find the door in the stone that they've built the temple around."

Oswen smiles and walks through the portal.

The others follow, Bel bowing awkwardly on the way out! We find we're in the temple. There's chaos; Inafina (who on this world looks "most normal" out of the four of us) asks a passing priest - the moon is out! The spirits went away! It went wrong! That vibe.

Outside, there's a clamour. We head out and find an angry mob heading towards them! Oswen asks Bel if he can do another Mantle? He can, upcasting. "We don't want more death today... The 'gods move in mysterious ways' - see if we can just get them to be thankful and head home" Oswen says, by way of an explanation for her request. And Bel does a good job - a speech about things being answered for, but "not with violence", and that the sun will rise tomorrow; head home, there will be answers in the morning. The priests retreat hastily into the temple and close the doors.

"Speaking of which" says Inafina, "I'm quite tired!"

We travel on streets with many a confused person, but under a full moon, fully visible in a cloudless sky. The city seems fully awake, in many ways, and it's slow going so we just decide to use the carpet - in fact Bel suggests, going back in the way we came out - the window and verandah. Good plan! As we fly up, Oswen suggests that Inafina checks the carpet wasn't too scared in the Underworld. Inafina seems to be able to sense its moods and the carpet seems to be mostly excited!

At long last, we get back to our respective beds.



## Campaign Day 51

(DM fiat - a Long Rest is permitted).

So we have to somehow find Serena's secret, let Erebos know (via presenting the pomegranate!) and thus find the way to the Moirai *and* then convince her to go there. Meanwhile, there's all this worrying talk about titans being awoken.

Yesterday, before the overnight 'excitement', Oswen had been considering temple visits - Temple of Clotho especially, given what we overheard - and maybe even going to talk to the military. Of course we want to try and talk to Councillor Remos to help us find Serena, but we have to wait for Manon or Banen to alert us about Remos' presence in the hotel.

It's quite a late start given the night's exertions. We grab a light breakfast at the hotel. We head back up to get ready to start checking around town and a moment later, there's a knock on the door - it's Manon - he lets us know that the councillor has left the hotel for the day, but is usually back at lunchtime around 12:30pm for a bit of a rest, then heads out again.

We decide that the Temple Of Clotho is our best destination in the mean time. The concierge desk gives us directions. It's a slightly smaller temple, but is set up on a hill surrounded by old olive trees in a quite beautiful setting. One of the cleric-like people who has been harvesting olives into a basket falls into step with us as we approach, and we chat. The temple isn't fully open but he can help us pray to Clotho; we mention that we're wondering about the titans waking.

"Do you think they are?" they ask. "Well," says Oswen, thinking about what we were told last night, "I think it's somewhere between possible and probable." The priest then asks, "I see. And what are you in town for, I wonder?" - Inafina (INS 21) realises they're concerned that we perhaps don't have the best intentions!

Oswen tries to explain briefly about finding information on Vecna and Kas but being sidetracked by the issue of the Titans - but ADV persuasion 1,7 reroll 1 another 1! => 7 - is not convinced. We seem to be gaining some attention and another priest approaches. The first priest is even more guarded now. It comes down to - why do we want to talk to Clotho? Well, Oswen thinks, it was the _temple_ specifically but she tries to explain about how, now she comes to think about it, perhaps Clotho being in touch with the weave that creates life might mean she can detect the awakening (or other).

Oswen REL 15, enough to at least have a conversation. The people who mostly come to worship here are mothers - new life and all that - so we stood out, obviously! And Inafina thinks they're trying to divert us, subtly, away from the temple. It's not over but it's there. "Perhaps Orvil might know something?" says Inafina suddenly, hoping Oswen will catch on; Oswen answers, "Well maybe, but he's hardly an expert in these matters" - but she's bringing Orvil out of whatever passes for a Fey wild in these parts and popping him into the olive grove.

She hears a grumpy, "ABOUT TIME!" in her head as she does so. She thinks back, "Sorry, didn't even know if it was safe to try - but there's something funny going on in that temple!"

We just keep chatting about religion while he flies away. Inafina deception dirty 20, covers somewhat for Oswen (despite Bel's help trying to be distracting!) deception 14.

Inside the temple, Orvil sees a large group of people that appear to be hiding! 20-odd women and children are here, dressed in everyday clothes, not apparently of any specific religious order. They look quite scared. They have sleeping rolls and bedding, so must be expecting to be around a while. There are food bowls around that look all the same, so the temple people must be giving them food and the children are all young - not like the very mixed kinds of people we've seen in town; they are *slightly* not human, because of a slight greenish-blue skin tint. Curious. Assuming human-like or close enough, the children must only be around 4-5 years old. A few aduls have *somewhat* elven features. The children are all perhaps half-something, exhibited through the skin colour; unusually bright eyes.

Oswen gets this in glimpses of memory as Orvil flies in and out of range. Nature, 21; she wonders if there's a mix with a water spirit of some kind. There's something about the colouring that reminds her of the experience Sankarbhumi. Neraid (water/sea faerie), or nymph or something. Proto-Elven, before elves. Hiding why? Maybe that shouldn't be possible of the belief in how humans were created here?

Bel is looking at her, obviously noticing her being distant and recognising the look. When she focuses back and sees him looking she nods at him and then says to the two priests, "Well, look, we aren't from here as you can guess and that's why I can't judge but also don't understand why those people would hide up there."

"No-ones hiding anywhere! What?"

She raises an eyebrow and says, "They're clearly not prisoners, they're being cared for and sheltered, and you're lying for them, so you've got good reasons to good things and not much reason to trust us I suppose..." - she tails off, looking at Bel, who picks up. "We're not with any - faction, political party, whatever - I don't know what you've been through here. We're the sort of meddlesome folk who like to help. And you look like you like to help too! Maybe we can help each other?"

Bel persuasion nat 1, self-inspo!, nat 13 + 13 -> 26.

We've gained more attention now. A few people exchange meaningful nods. The gate into the orchard is closed and people move to stand guard over it. For a moment we're on guard, worrying about a fight; but then the first priest we met says "If you already know, it's too late for us to do anything - you might as well come up. We don't have long."

We are walked towards the temple as the priest starts to explain.

Unlike what people say about the Moirai, these devotees of Clotho belief in life and possibility. The boundlessness she represents. The *other* sisters restrict what Clotho does. Clotho is the miracle of creation; the birth of things. They see it as a duty to protect life. There is a prophecy being bandied around right now, that the way to appease the Leviathan is to offer an old-fashioned sacrifice. It has to be a child of both land and sea, and it has to be a child. And kidnappings have been happening.

"Forgive me for saying, as I say I'm not from here, but - from my perspective, that's barbaric!" says Oswen.

"It's not our place to comment on sacrifices" (!) "as we are *really* not supposed to get involved but we cannot sit by idly while this happens..." - the other priest then chips in, "...because it's just *horseshit!* This will achieve nothing, sacrificing these innocent children will achieve *nothing*. This is - this is just... It's scapegoating! A distraction tactic."

Oswen says, "We really do have reason to believe that the Leviathan is *not* the only waking Titan."

"Well sacrificing these children of mixed parentage is going to do nothing either way. It's a lie, the whole thing. This has *nothing* to do with whether the Titans are coming or not."

Oswen nods, "I mean, we *could* all be wrong about that, but it's very unlikely!"

It transpires that the priests don't really think Clotho has much to say on that matter, partly because they think it's a political matter - that is to say, what would you even do? No mortal, nobody in Akros could ever stop the Titans. Last time they rose and were battled, nearly all life on the planet was wiped out.

Ultimately they care about the people they shelter. They want to get them out of the city, but it's difficult because the city is on alert. They have it under control as much as they can; there's little we can really do except potentially *guard* the temple against invaders; protect a caravan when it's sneaked out; that kind of thing.

The politicising of the Titan 'threat' means that it's the *people* who are the real threat. The titans can't be stopped by mortals, so why even worry about it?! But the overreaction to a potential "what if" is the more dangerous thing. They think that the talk about titans rising is just misdirection. People are using "the titans are coming" as an excuse to do other things. At least, that's their thinking.

Oswen hands him a paper bird and explains how it works. If they need us and if we can, we'll come to help.

Inside, conversation turns to the Child Of Fate. We are shown detailed, delicate murals and statues. "She was Clotho's creation, released from the threads of the universe by Clotho herself. It was a response, a challenge - that's the wrong word... More like... A mathematical proof? Clotho did this as proof in a contest of logic. The question of time and will and predetermination. Clotho creates and her sisters then control, and terminate. But is it possible for Clotho to create something that is truly free? Or is everything that she does therefore preordained? If so, then Clotho is secondary to the other two sisters. On that balance Clotho seems the weakest, with the least say in anything. She's often depicted as the youngest of the Moirai. We do not hold to that belief! But others view them differently. Some don't even view them as separate beings. But assuming they *are* then surely Clotho is able to do things independently if she really is free of Lachesis' control or the final fate dealt by Atropos."

"The problem is, if the Child of Fate cannot be controlled by Lachesis then she cannot be led to death and brought low by Atropos. That's why the Child of Fate breaks everything! If Clotho was able to create, out of nothing, something that is not part of the cycle then isn't she the most powerful being of all? It would make her above everything and everyone else. And if that was the case... Wouldn't that break the universe? Couldn't she not create everything as a child of fate?"

Oswen nods. "It would. And that's why both versions are probably true. She *can* create such a thing, but if she does, it breaks the universe, so she cannot. She relies upon Lachesis and Atropos for balance and continuity, but they rely upon her to create that life in the first place?"

He continues.

"There is another aspect of Clotho that we celebrate. Very important to our religion. The reason why we care so much for these people in particular... This happens regularly, whenever races mix and combine to create something with more possibility, more _power_, free to cross between worlds - rather than, in this case, bound to the sea or to the water but not both - people try to destroy them. They seem like mini-embodiments of the Child of Fate. Clotho is the great dreamer and the great artist. She mixes these ideas, pulls threads together to spin this yarn, this *spool* that is the entirety of the possibility of a being's life. And every living being is unique. She's the cause of all of this uniqueness. But if we believe in good and evil, a balance, then not everything that she makes is good. She also makes evil. She also makes aberrations. She makes _everything_. And when she makes something bad, then surely that's where Lachesis and Atropos are more important than ever. If Clotho were to be able to create something that were free from that, then wouldn't it be dangerous? Something evil that would endure endlessly? People assume the Child of Fate is benign - good or benevolent - what if the Child of Fate - what if she, or he! - is evil?"

He adds, "Are the Titans not free-willed creations of Clotho? Her powers had to be reigned in and tied to the tapestry of the three sisters."

Did she make Vecna? Make Kas? Is the Child of Fate actually, say, Vecna or is Serena the second of two? Or unrelated? Once again, more questions than answers!

At least we *think* that Serena is appearing as a "she" since Remos the blacksmith reported that, *but* - as Bel is quick to point out - disguising oneself to match expectations is a relatively easy task.

Is Clotho the only one who can see the Child of Fate in the universe?

We can't get an audience with the Moirai unless we bring this Child to them and we can't get help to do that from Erebos until we tell him the Child's secret. So what Oswen plans *next* could be interesting. She asks if there's an alcove where she might use to burn some incense. Something not in full view of everyone... "There's a small shrine in the garden?"

So, Divination it is. The ritual completes, the incense is burning and the question is to Clotho themselves. "I realise we have not yet earned an audience. We're still working on that. But I wonder if I would be permitted an answer to one question, even so. Is the Child of Fate waking the Titans?"

REL check, only 14 :-( (after a 5th Nat 1 of the session, rerolled as a 4, then heroic inspo blown, getting natural 9).

She senses that the answer in the smoke *is* Clotho. "Is a Child of Fate waking the Titans?! That is a good question! If I knew the answer to that, it would be great. I would very much like to know if a Child of Fate is responsible for waking the Titans."

The smoke clears. She relays the response to the party. The reactions are predictable. She says, "I know right? That's a new one. A god that doesn't even know. Or one that lies convincingly!"

We debate a while, as Oswen starts pulling out notebooks and sheets of paper and so forth. Investigation 25. Well, it's the first time we've heard directly from the Moirai... But then Inafina points and says, "wait, is that correct?" - she's pointing at "a" not "the". **A** Child of Fate.

Oswen pauses for a moment and then says, "Oh dear, there's more than one" (and these priests suspected as much). Could even be Kas *and* Vecna. Or neither. Great. We've added more questions to our questions. Again. We're good at that.

* There's **more than one Child Of Fate**
* Clotho is **not aware of what they're doing** - she cannot see them either
* Clotho has **confirmed the Titans are waking** in that last sentence

Before we go, we're told that **if we see any movements of "The Sign of the Jackal"** - please alert the priests. It means that the thugs they're hiding these people from use that sign and if we see it in the context of people being on the move, then it means that the thug agenda - whatever *exactly* that is - has moved forward.

Appropriate thanks given, we head away.

On the way down hill, Inafina says, "There's no military solution that could possibly work"; Oswen agrees; Inafina says, "So if we're talking to *them*, it has to be an evacuation strategy"; Oswen counters with, "but to where?"

We don't know anything about councillor Remos. So we need to find out more. We find a cafe, intending to ask if there are public halls where you can watch political debates or similar, while also having something to drink; but SUR 2+5->7! Oswen can't find anything that looks sensible. We pick a cafe at random. Bel tries asking the person at the counter. *Another* Nat 2, but that's 15 total. We hear about there being a debating forum, but the council chamber is closed - votes happen there - secret ballots. The forum is where people debate each other and present speeches.

After a drink, we head out to follow directions for the Forum but once outside and without people in earshot, and still quite high up on the city slopes, Oswen stops and gestures at the city below. "So these experiences inevitably continue to change me, as they will, and in some respects, I find myself something of a cynic and saying superstitious things like - I feel it in my bones. We *know* the Titans are coming. We hope to put them back to sleep. But if they rise, by all accounts, the destruction here will be more or less total. Now, we *could* escape; we have the amulet."

Inafina laughs, and says, "Why ask the question when you know the answer?"

Oswen "Well, I hoped to find a way to ask it without leading the answer. My take is this. We've helped, as best we can, and Alustriel has others. She's mentioned other groups. If this world fell we could escape, but I would not run and leave these people to their fate so long as there was any fight left in me. *But* if anyone else would prefer to leave sooner..."

Bel saves her from the very awkward question. "Not a bridge we need to cross. There is still much we haven't done. The story isn't told!"

But Oswen knows it might happen - well, right now. Or in a month or a year. We don't know.

"Well if it were between sitting somewhere safe and having a cup of tea or watching the Leviathan rise out of the sea and fighting it - well I can have a cup of tea any day."

Kindle nods. "I'm here to protect. I go wherever you go, because with me around, I feel around that you stand a better chance. I am fulfilling my duties to Yondalla."

Inafina, of course, already know what Oswen was going to say, "Yes, of course, we'd fight. And very likely fall, and very few would ever know that we'd been involved, but it's not about that. It's about waking up on a new morning in the Outlands knowing that people on a world died when you were right there and might, just might have been able to do something."

Bel adds, "We're not the type to turn and face the other way, just because something uncomfortable is happening."

Oswen sighs, "Well then. I guess if we might die for this plane, we'd better understand it more - boring or not! Onwards, to the forum."

It's a beautiful wide amphitheatre with three tiers of standing/sitting area, beautiful columns encircling behind and a roof that covers everything except the very middle. We enter on the middle tier, stairs heading up or down. It "faces away" from the ocean, with people sat in almost a 3/4 circle facing towards the city. Two marble lecterns are set up in the centre for two people to stand and debate, both facing the audience. We go down the stairs - "I'm short, I don't want to have to look over the top of people!" says Oswen - but it's busy. Standing room only. People shuffle up a bit and we manage to squeeze in.

It's mid-way through some debate or other. We don't know who they are. Oswen asks someone behind her - "Oh it's all in the name of entertainment by this stage! The vote is tomorrow. I seriously doubt anyone's minds will be changed. The two debates today aren't about the military - they already said their piece..." - but then they stop, and listen, because the debate has reached an important point; they are summing up.

"...have millennia of history and culture here. Akros is second only to Memnos in cultural wealth. We hold the cradle of the greatest writings and philosophies here. We have the Temple to the Police and the Temple to Creation and the Oracle. We have much to defend. We have responsibility to not just Akros but to the whole of the Republic. My opponent would have you believe that this could be so easily abandoned; that the history, the great families of Akros would readily cast off their responsibilities and doom the people to a life of uncertainty and poverty, scrabbling for scraps!" - there are boos of agreement - but then an adjudicator rings a metal triangle. It seems time is up. He has a few more words. "Who among you will stay and defend your city?" he says, before sitting; more sounds of agreement.

An older gentleman stands. Late 60s, while the other was maybe early 60s? He thanks his opponent; "It is well argued and it is thoughtful, but Councillor Tyron is a scion of one of the great families of Akros whose history goes back more than 800 years here. I understand his position but his position is not your position nor is it my position. What *I* am concerned with is survival. The survival of our people. It is people who create culture and history. It is people who make a nation. The Republic can only survive if we survive. We *must* evacuate. I know not all of you believe that the Titans are coming and I would love to be proven wrong! To be dragged out and stripped of my rank, of my position in the Senate, because I was over-cautious and more interested in saving lives than in protecting the status quo; protecting the power held here in the city. These rich cultural traditions live in *us*. We take them where we go. But what doesn't move if we evacuate is the *land*. The beautiful buildings and statues, the art, the wealth of the city that is *not* moveable. If *they* evacuate, people always take what is of *mobile* value with them! But they will be forced to leave something. And they leave more than most of us. That is why they urge you to back their stance to stay. Take what we can. Head further inland, far enough that we have enough of a warning when the Titans do come. We can head into the mountains; we can wait it out; we can rebuild. We take things of *true* value. Scrolls, books, histories; mathematics, engineering. We can rebuild..." - but the triangle is rung again.

The other man stands. "What **Councillor Remos** didn't tell you is that his family is not from Akros. He is an immigrant! He is not from here. He has a home elsewhere. He is not one of us, not in the true sense of the world. We have made him one of our own; we have welcomed him in; but is he of Akros? No. Not like most of you, who are Akrosian. Who stand to lose so much. Who are being asked to abandon their homes."

At least we get the feeling that both agree the military should not seize control, so it sounds like that dangerous (and likely, futile) option is off the table.

It seems it's a 3-way split on the vote:

* Give power to the fortress over the gap; martial law
* Don't give power; stay, on the basis that the threat is not real
* Evacuate, on the basis that the threat is real and martial law wouldn't make any difference

The debate winds up for lunch recess. The councillors get mobbed somewhat by members of the public; we hurry back to the hotel to get ahead, hoping to catch Remos who normally heads to the gym if here early enough. So we head over there on the pretence of using it for, umm, gym stuff. We have to get changed into special clothing the hotel provides! It's quite strange with us all four being in "uniform".

There are two other people already there. Eventually Remos arrives; Inafina is really the only one doing any real training - beating up a straw-filled mannequin! - and when Remos heads to the pool, Oswen and Bel head that way too and start having a loud conversation about the certainty of the Titan arrival and foolishness of any plan other than evacuation.

Remos overhears, looks over across the pool and scowls - he doesn't seem to want interrupting. So Oswen's next line is, "OK, Councillor Remos, you got us - it wasn't subtle I admit. I know this is your quiet time. But we are not here to debate; we agree; but actually wanted to ask a different, but increasingly likely related question, about the one you may know as Serena. Others call her the Child of Fate..." - he puts his finger to his lips. He looks over at the steam room. "I feel like a steam room" he says. We follow.

Inside Oswen continues, "Yes, 'the' Child of Fate. Or as it transpires, *a* Child Of Fate."

"I have been visited by a woman - who claims to be my mother! Which is interesting. It would be the first time that my mother has ever reached out to me...! Very suspicious timing, you understand."

"You think they seek, well, wealth or protection of some kind? Or influence?"

"I have little to offer. I am not rich; I was adopted into a modest family, living outside Akros... You know my story..."

Bel says, "Um, actually - sorry - we don't!"

"Well I moved to the city for work. A clerk, scribe, librarian; I carried files, I transcribed speeches, I worked for a local news agency. I was elected to represent the working people and the academics. So I have very little influence. She was definitely after *something* - asking a lot of questions - which I found curious. I don't know her. Why come looking for me now, of all times? She didn't ask me to vote one way or another; she seemed perhaps supportive of my stance. **She seemed genuinely interested that I should leave the city and head inland**. She asked some curious questions, too - about my friends, my cohorts - very interested in knowing a bit more about the other councillors, particularly the ones who didn't agree with me. She offered to help, even, which of course I declined. I always think, when you are in my position, there is no genuine help that people ever offer. At least not without something in return! I'm afraid I don't have much more I could offer you. I do know where she says I could find her, if that is of any help?"

"Certainly, thank you."

"There is a small catacomb just behind the Dome of the Oracle. It's where the city's founders are said to be buried. She asked me to look for her there."

"Good to hear it wasn't anywhere weird or creepy, then...!"

"I don't trust her. But then again, I guess you would say that even if the person was indeed your birth mother who left you in a box on the stoop of a farmhouse with no note, no coin, not even a name. Just this" - he shows an old, small bracelet that he wears on a chain around his neck. It's woven. "They assumed this was my name, but Remos is a *belief* - a state of being - **it means, 'hidden'** - I don't think it was my name."

Oswen ARC 28. Not magical. He hands it over. She looks closer. The weaving is intentional, designed; it could mean "something hidden", or could mean "hide it", or "to hide"; the way it's been put together, it's hard to tell. An incomplete word on its own, without context.

Oswen asks, "You've been very helpful, forgive the personal question, but, are you as old as your appearance would suggest, for human? I would guess, around six decades?"

"Yes, I am in my late 60s, yes."

"Thanks. Just wondering."

"Curious question!"

"Well, we've just learned that there - we think - Children of Fate. Plural. We think Serena *might* be *a* Child of Fate. And if she really was your mother, might that make you another such Child? I've no idea. But if you'd aged slowly, perhaps that might have been something."

He concurs that she did look the same age as him, more or less; if she were to be his mother, she must've had him at a very early age.

We thank him for his time and apologise for the intrusion. "A big day tomorrow" he says. "Last night is just a warning... As we get closer to the vote, my fear is that my nightmares will come true. I wake in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, seeing the city streets flowing with a river of blood. That is a future I am determined to stop - to avoid."

"So are we, for what it little it counts!"

He gets up and leaves.

We keep accumulating more and more questions, with no answers. The more we learn the more options there are, rather than narrowing it down. Even the things we thought we *did* know, it turns out we don't - *children* of fate. The question becomes, who can we turn to? Perhaps a well-considered question put this Oracle might help. We don't have any other threads to pull on. Well, how long have we even got? Hours, days, weeks, before the titans attack? Perhaps they have some idea. We figure - why not; we start to make our way to the temple.

There's a queue. And some queue! Maybe 80 people/groups, if not more. It's a huge mixture of people, any kind of part of society you might think of seems to be here somehow. There's a regimented, orderly approach taken to seeing people.

Curious, Oswen asks the person ahead - a young family - asks (if it's not rude to ask!) what question they might have for the oracle. They're a little reluctant, but eventually tell us - they want to ask the oracle the safest route for their family, should they wish to leave.

It turns out there's a flyer, well, with sort of instructions - the oracle is not taking any more questions about whether or not the titans are rising, that's already been answered many times! She's sure they are. The family ahead tell us that they think the prediction said we "only have a few days".

We head away, debating philosophy, we're suddenly called to by someone. "You, with the ears! And the - the - orc?!" - we stop and turn. An acolyte is sprinting (!) down the hill. We start walking back up to meet them, a very flustered young man. The oracle has asked for us! But we don't want to jump the queue... "Would you... Permit me?!" he asks and ties strange tassels on our wrists, effectively binding them, with long rope. We look like prisoners. Are we prisoners?! We're not sure!

We're escorted back up the hill in full view of the long queue which has now become hushed, with lots of questioning, conspiratorial whispers. So embarrassing!

The oracle is sat on a simple stone bench, with a silk cushion, looking out to sea. She turns as we approach; she's blindfolded. Olive skin, elven ears, a plain nightrobe-like gown with a simple sash. She holds more of the rope we have around our wrists on her hand, lots of knots in it, irregular intervals, across her lap; one pile on one side, another pile on the other. A very long rope.

"Thank you for coming. I'm sorry - it was such a late vision; we weren't prepared ahead of time. I was quite sure you would come but I was unsure when!" - and she thanks the acolyte, who departs. We're asked to stand in front of her. When we can do, we can see that the blindfold has slipped just a little on one side; Oswen, NAT 15+5, realises that the Oracle has *no* eyes. Sunken hollows where the eyes should be.

After some smalltalk, we get down to it. The question. Attendants are sent away as she says the question is "sensitive". Once we're alone - "It's something I saw yesterday... How do I put this... You come seeking the Child of Fate. You come seeking Serena. You come from somewhere else; that I understand now; that makes me more worried! I cannot read your intentions."

Inafina INS 27. The oracle is almost anxious, fighting something back. Inafina says, "Whatever you fears, or anxieties, speak your mind. I have a feeling it could be because *you* might be the one we seek." "No!" Inafina laughs; "Swing and a miss! But please, speak freely."

"I cannot see beyond your arrival! It is frightening me because it is changing my visions. It is changing what I have seen. This has happened one other time. A long time ago now. I barely remember it." As she speaks she's feeling knots in the cord, pulling it along occasionally, pausing other times. "Perhaps seven, eight, maybe eight hundred years ago - when one of your kind" (she looks to Oswen) "came and he too sought to speak to the Child of Fate. And it confused many of my visions. I remember..." - she skims along the cord a long, long way to a very strange series of knots, double, triple - "...a calamity, tumultuous, but I don't remember what else happened; I remember this feeling, this sense, familiarity; WHY do you seek Serena?"

"I will answer that. But before I do, if it's not too frustrating, I have one question first - do you know what he looked like?"

But nothing of his appearance was said to her.

Oswen starts to answer about Vecna and Kas, and the Moirai, Erebos, Serena and everything else. Bel helps with some of the recollection (ADV HIS 23). As we get to even Clotho not being able to see the Child*ren* of Fate, the Oracle's hand whips out and grabs hers - with unerring accuracy, despite the lack of vision.

"Stop right there! That's not entirely true! Clotho cannot see Serena *anymore* but she absolutely could sense her daughter *before* the split."

"The split?"

"Yes. I do not know more of it. I just know it is called 'the split', and is before my time. You may need to speak to historians. But Clotho - all three of the Moirai - were keeping tabs on their daughter. Of course they would have been. She was their grand experiment, until one day The Split happened and they could not sense her anymore."

We also learn that the Oracle only remembered the memory of that previous wizard until yesterday, when the same sort of thing happened. "I'd forgotten this!" she says, showing the strange knots in the rope. "I knew these were here, but didn't know what they were, until yesterday when I suddenly remembered."

Oswen asks about the knots. The Oracle explains that she doesn't "see" the future. She senses things, concepts, flows, moments - knots, inflection points - this is how she records how she *feels* at those times. "History sometimes repeats, like this section!" - she shows one series of knots, then another - "then it flows to new events, sometimes close together, sometimes far apart. Except *this*" - that strange ball - "this is the only thing that is strange."

Oswen examines the knots, first checking the "normal" ones, then the strange ball, thinking in terms of emotion, of feeling; INV 19+13 -> 32! In the weird section, it's basically like a replay. The Oracle took stuff that had already happened and wrote knots on top, but not undoing what happened before. There's one series of events, then another series, like two histories that overlap.

Oswen sighs heavily. "Well, there's only one person we know who has that kind of magic. And a few hundred years ago isn't too long for him - assuming similar passage of time on this plane to others - but this looks like a small version of that spell."

(Later, in one of her books she does find Modify Memory. **Horrible spell**. But it could have been that simple, potentially, so she moderates her opinion a bit; shouldn't jump to conclusions about Vecna just because of memory issues).

But that said, the Oracle had *completely* forgotten this sequence until we arrived and our arrival and it "felt" familiar.

Well, Oswen mentions that we're not leaving either way. We might stop the titans, we might not. The Oracle has to keep to her original vision - but like others here who're predicting disaster, that disaster may come but *hopefully* won't, of course. And if it doesn't, their standing in society will be... Less. Nobody will ever know that they would've been right, that they might've saved lives. That'll be the cost.

"Do you know who the gods gear? It's a defining tenet of our philosophy. Gods fear heroes, because heroes can change the future. They're the ones whose actions, bravery, sacrifices and valour can reshape the world - who wield the power to rival that of Theros's gods. That is why they fear them."

Oswen talks about the temple we were at before. Leading people there might be a safe place to go. But the Oracle shakes her head. "If I lead people there, it will jeopardise *all* of their safety. And there isn't one answer for everyone. That's why I can't just write recommendations!"

We are ready to go. We ask if there's anything else she wants to know or anything she might want to tell us. She smiles.

"I am allowed to have *some* fun, yes? So... When you walk past the big oak tree - duck."

We bid farewell.

"I hope you find the answers that you seek - and that the future you create is good to us all."

We head away. "Keep your eyes peeled for an oak tree" says Oswen. We start down the hill - to disapproving looks and mutters! - and, as it happens, walk past a big oak tree. "OK" says Oswen; "Duck!" - and we all duck.

An egg goes flying over the top of Oswen's head. A voice from the not-far-away queue shouts, "Queue jumper!" and Bel says, "She *told* us you'd do that!"

(On the way past the family we met earlier, Oswen looks at the mother - "I can say this; I now *strongly* believe that whatever the Oracle tells you, it's the truth. I hope you get what you need.")

And *the* Oswen remembers...

> "There is a small catacomb just behind the Dome of the Oracle. It's where the city's founders are said to be buried. She asked me to look for her there."

...oh! Wait! We're right here. Well, we roll out the flying carpet. The catacombs are *behind* the dome so we don't walk past (again!) - the dome is atop the hill with a long, slight slope "leading up" and the dome itself looks out over the sea, with *that* side of the hill being a very steep bank. Not quite, but almost a cliff. Along the sides, a few trees cling on and, lower down, we can see an entrance. That must be it, so we fly down to gain access.

We find a scrub area where we can set down and soon discover an iron chain, that is used as a sort of handrail along an exposed, perilous section above the sea, with an entrance there. There's a lot of writing in a language we don't understand all over the entrance. Oswen assumes its the usual - religious, philosophical, related to death and life. In we go.

Inside, though, it's quite plain. There's a salty tang in the air from sea spray and the floor is wet. There are very dim lights, quite widely spaced. It feels dark and large; the widely spaced lights give an unusual sense of scale. There is a small offering box (Oswen drops in 5gp) along with some plain bowls and some incense ash.

It's quite dark, so we bring up the driftglobe.

Oswen REL 23. The layout and size makes sense to her; this is where the *poorest* are kept. Ash urns, tucked - *packed* almost - into the walls. Several have only simple scratched insignia.

"My fate, perhaps all our fates, one way. But only in *this* life" comments Inafina. "Each one, sadness for people and the numbers ever-increasing. But there is more beyond."

We try calling Serena's name! There's an impressive echo but no response.

Kindle grabs his holy symbol and activates Twilight Sanctuary. "In case of undead!" he announces. 18 temp HP all round.

As we go deeper, we find larger and larger side-tunnels. More and more urns. Things get older and more run down. In a couple of places, shelves have actually collapsed and urns are just in piles on the ground! We all feel bad at this; Kindle in particular feels it strongly - for those who have lost, but also all these urns unattended; nobody to come for them anymore.

Inafina PER 22. Light moving in the distance, from a side tunnel maybe 100ft ahead. She points it out. We travel a little more cautiously, the driftglobe being allowed to fall back a distance. Colder air again. More musty, but dry now. Even older. Far too deep for any natural light. When we reach the section with the light, we see someone standing near an entrance to side rooms - an old lady, maybe in her seventies, looking up at us.

Bel does almost a double-take. As if he almost recognises her, but not quite.

"Yes?" she asks. "Why have you come to look for me? What do you want?"

Oswen says, "My name's Oswen. We have a bit of a problem developing on two fronts - one, the awakening Titans, and two, Vecna and Kas - at least those are the names we know. And we wondered if you might be able to help with that."

"Why would I help you? What's in it for me?"

"What do you need?"

"Are you offering?"

"Are you asking?!"

"I don't know what you *can* offer me."

"Well, then speak your mind; imagine it was limitless."

"Well, I have no needs. So what could you possibly offer me?"

"Is Remos *really* a child of yours?"

"The councillor? Yes. Yes in a way."

"In a way?"

"Well... He is a child of - I didn't give birth to him. If that's what you're asking... But I love him as a mother would love a child."

Oswen HIS 23. Remos said he was an orphan, raised by farmers who helped him get an education. He came from nothing, abandoned. Remos knows his parents. Serena claimed to be his birth mother.

"But you *did* claim to be his birth mother. I was wondering why?"

Serena claims that she found Remos abandoned here, in the catacombs and ended up finding the farmers with whom she left him. Oswen asks about the bracelet... Inafina INS 26... "What bracelet? Oh that? Well it was - just a thing, a keepsake, you can't leave a child with nothing... And now he has a name..." - Inafina heard a denial, then a plausible story constructed. She's hiding something. She's not lying, she's just omitting. Curious behaviour. Just dancing around it.

We try talking about the Leviathan instead. Nothing. Then Oswen mentions The Split and *that* gets a reaction - she lunges at Oswen with a blade! Misses, spins and turns around to go for the closest person. Bel - 6+4 piercing and poison damage. Inafina tries to get her with the stick but she dodges twice! Very nimble for an "old women".

Kindle manages to grab hold of her instead. A (bug)bear hug. Oswen is casting Detect Thoughts. *Nothing*. Something preventing divination magic from working on this woman. ARC 32! Detect Thoughts does not think there is a creature in front of us. Well that figures, because that's part of why Clotho etc. can't "see" this person.

Bel is feeling bad! Serena cackles. "You should be looking after your friend!"

Inafina, 15 medicine. Where he was stabbed, strange cracks are happening around the wound. They're turning grey. It looks like he's turning into stone! She calls back, "He's turning to stone; possible Curse." Serena fails to wriggle free; Oswen tries Remove Curse. Serena laughs; "That's not going to work! If you know what's good for you I'd focus on your friend and let me go. He hasn't got long."

Kindle bops her over the head (Nat 20!) and knocks her out. Inafina starts tying her and once done, searches her for any other blades. PER 16. 3 more blades. She also finds a series of small stone discs, tied together with braided cord, large - about half a foot across - covered in inscriptions. But Bel is petrified! He's frozen into stone. Oswen ARC 26. There's magic that can undo this, but it's a very specific spell; Greater Restoration. "Kindle? That big restoration spell you have - I think that'll do it."

Kindle goes through the motions to cast the spell, fretting as he does, fetches the diamond dust from his pouch, blows it - it looks like stardust! - and over the course of a few seconds, Bel slowly turns back to himself.

Oswen is able to investigate Serena. INV/ARC 28. No spell on her. No apparent magic items that might avoid detection. An innate ability? *Something* interferes with her ability to use Divination-based magic. She fast-casts trying Identify (Divination-based), which confirms without doubt that *any* Divination-based magic fails.

She'll have to spend ten minutes to cast Comprehend Languages. She wants to read the discs. Perhaps they have something to do with it.

Serena doesn't wake up. The discs are interesting. Very old. They're proto-books. Before books were invented, basically! Clay discs with tiny words inscribed, which reads as if it was taken from a larger work but is in and of itself incomplete. It describes belief. Old theology and the nature of belief. That belief can change reality. That if enough believe, it can create gods. At least *some* gods. But if so, how are those gods different from "the original" - the Mother, the Moirai. The take here is that gods were created by mortals and that *mortals* are of the Mother. The gods claim that they are direct descendants of the mother and claim power by birthright, this theory is different and places the gods **lower than mortals because mortals created them** - the mother, mortals, then the current pantheon of gods. Well, nothing too new there, except if someone is "not of the mother" - it's not that they're _mortal_, it could mean any of the believed-into-existence gods.

**So any of *those* gods might be trying to release the titans.**

Some discs look like they were from another "book" entirely but Serena has threaded them on to this same string. The question: Is morality innately a mortal thing, or was it something created by gods as a means of control. In this writing, the belief is that it is innate. The dichotomy of a perception of good and evil created by morality along with free will is, in a being, what makes one 'whole'. But in this writing, gods were created by mortals and *don't* have free will since the gods are created in the way that the mortals created them. A god of justice is nothing but just. One dimensional; one complexity.

So far so confusing. Then a question is posed. What would happen if one could believe so strongly in morality as to "cleave" evil from good; in any person, there's the potential for either, but could one be so pure of heart "to split evil from good"? To be divine or be holy must be to stop being human and start being this artificial concept of entirely good or entirely evil?

If this were at all true, Serena stabbed Bel and that would tend to indicate evil but the rest of her actions were not directly so. At least, not chaotically so; she was evasive but not specifically uncooperative and only acted when a specific topic was touched upon. Perhaps she felt threatened. Her actions were not, at least at face value, overtly good or evil. So if she *was* an embodiment of one or the other, that would be a surprise, but then again, what exactly would it "look" like to meet some creature truly good or evil?

Inafina's insight as this is relayed (24) gathers that this is just one idea of splitting evil and good. Well if the goal is splitting and this is just a goal - the idea is that it's possible to believe in something in a way that, through the nature of that belief, a being is split in some way into two parts. And while that *might* be good and evil, it doesn't have to be. But *why* would one ever want to do this?

Oswen recalls that the Split was the point where Serena was no longer detectable to the gods. Perhaps *the* Child of Fate had an idea that it might be possible to become undetectable if somehow split into a detectable and non-detectable part. There are even more questions that then arise of course, but perhaps all relatively unimportant; the important part is - who or what is the other part that was split from her. And given her comments on "loving like a mother", if we were to assume that "finding him in the catacombs" was either a lie, or at least a deliberately misleading way to phrase it, the answer would most likely be - Remos. Hence, hidden; hide; that's Serena, hiding.

So Serena's secret *could* be that she split herself, or arranged for it by some other person, but either way, she somehow put all the "detectable" stuff into Remos and all the "undetectable" stuff is left with her.

* How do we verify any of this?
* If this *is* her secret we can get Erebos to show us the path to the Moirai but can we get an audience without Serena? Or must she come?
* And none of this tells us who is waking the Titans except to say that it now seems likely that it's one of the "current" pantheon.

When Serena wakes, we ask about the Titans and gods. It's the *evil* gods doing it. The one who could threaten them would be Atropos, the death god of the Moirai. So now we have *two* things we'd want the Moirai to do! And that would require two things from us in turn. We don't want to give up Serena or her secret now we know the details. Serena does offer - if we keep her secret from Erebos - that she'd go to the Moirai with us *but* we must help her escape, too. It's a curious offer since Oswen has already decided that she'd not give that secret to Erebos anyway! But even then, we'd be at the Moirai "empty handed" so to speak.

Serena suggests trickery. If we had a way to help her escape, we could get what we want from the Moirai and then run away. In the case of the rising Titans, Atropos could just *not* threaten the other gods in that case and the Titans thus wake, but the knowledge of Vecna and Kas, once we had it, would be with us. But now we're tricking gods and condemning the people of Theros to destruction at the hands of the Titans.

"So you must give me up!" says Serena. "You must, if you are to be the people you want to be".

Oswen sits and thinks. "We've been in difficult situations before and managed to find another option. There must be one here. A lever to pull... The gods here work differently from those creatures who are god-like on other worlds, or at least seem to. Here it is more - political. Machinations, if you will. So a modification on your idea of tricking them. Finding out their various goals, their means, what we might do in order to get them on our side; finding the levers. There must be a way!"

Serena raises an eyebrow; "So, you really *do* believe in free will..."

"I always have."

### Late afternoon

We're in a cafe, talking about the conundrum. Serena has elected to remain down in the catacombs, quite content there, until such a time as we have anything new to discuss.

* Why did Erebos want to know the secret? He was very specific.
* What do the evil gods hope to do by raising the titans - is it just chaos, or more?
* Why would the four original gods - Nyx and the Moirai - just sit back as they did it?
* We're told that evil gods are doing this, yet Keranos said - not one of "our doing" and referred to singular, "another".

That first one is perhaps most immediate since it is related to a possible obligation. Ruler of the underworld, wants to know "the secret" of one who cannot die. Perhaps he thinks that secret is the reason for the immortality, but we think he's well aware of how she was made, so that's probably not it. Perhaps... Well, there are heaps of options!

Oswen thinks back to when Bel was having the 'nightmare'; HIS 13, can't remember details. Inafina tries to remember too - she saw Bel in her 'nightmare' - HIS 13 too! But Bel, NAT 20 on HIS. He had a flicker of recognition when he saw Serena; of course, it's because he saw her in the dream too. But it was a younger-looking version. Inafina too. But is that real, or is that just how they both process that interaction?

We cast our minds back to the conversation with Erebos. He claimed Serena had released the dead spirits to prove a point about free will and claimed (he thought) she was doing much the same by releasing the titans. TL;DR he wants a secret, as if to use it against her.

The only person who can really shed more light on that is Serena - again - and so we have little choice in the early evening but to return along the perilous chain walk to seek her out. She's easier to find and we now recount that encounter with Erebos, both the dreams and the "in-person" meeting. Serena re-states in very clear terms that "the evil gods are releasing the titans". It's true to the letter, thinks Inafina - INS nat 28 - lying by omission. So Inafina goes, "Ah, now I understand. And who exactly put that idea into the heads of evil gods?" - but knows the question is ill-formed.

It's looking like a contest of wills. Inafina turns to Bel. We all four now understand the deal here; Serena is avoiding saying what needs to be said. She's being truthful but only by omission. Bel struggles to take over somewhat, but goes for an angle of trying to get her to say things she shouldn't through annoyance; even with inspo, rolls 3,6+9 -> 15 intimidation, but she gets an insight of only 14, so doesn't see through what Bel's trying to do; she gets effectively goaded by him.

Nyx, Chronos - Chaos, Time; the three Moirai - exist within chaos and time; those are the truly powerful ones. But everyone else answers to fate. Once something is set in motion, the evil gods can do no more to try and avoid their fate than a mortal can avoid their eventual death. It's not about convincing the gods to do it; they *must* do it, because it's in their nature. It's just necessary to create the right environment.

Ultimately, she states that the rising titans are not "original" gods. They only exist by belief, claims Serena. And the belief was by the people, who believe the titans to be destroyers. So they are. And if the people believe that evil gods are waking the titans that they believe previously sleeping, then that's what happens.

**Serena admits that she planted the vision of the Titans rising in the Oracle.**

And when she talks more about that, we start to see more of an evil aspect of her. And she starts to claim that Remos is the only pure good thing in the city. It's somewhat contradictory at times, and certainly twisted, but one thing seems clear - the only person she cares about in that city is Remos. She talks about the layers of lies, the mythologies overlapping and contradicting and all of it, in the end, circular; each prophecy self-fulfilling and prompting the next.

**Serena even admits that the Cult of the Dead is something she started** and grows every year; one year it'll finally get big enough that all of the dead *will* be returned. "I'll win eventually" she says, of her 'contest' with Erebos. It's just a game. She's just another chess player like any of the gods, trying to get one up on each other, doing the very thing she claims that she dislikes in them.

Oswen changes tactic and asks about her recent visit to the Oracle. Did she do so 7-800 years ago, or know something of who might have? Kindle (INS 18) notices that she's gone quiet and *does* know something but is trying to make out that she does not. He steps forward and Serena still has some fear of that, so she steps back inadvertently.

"This was not a game I wanted to play. I made a mistake *once*. I think this was the one time I may have made a mistake. So I'm not going to own up to this. I didn't create that vision in her mind of the Oracle. That actually happened. That was a real vision."

"And who was the visitor?"

**"He only introduced himself as Caven."**

"Did he have any distinguishing physical attributes you can remember?"

"He was very handsome and had golden, almost shining, shoulder-length hair. Very disarming. Very easy on the eye and very likeable. But..."

She hesitates. Oswen tries to persuade her to say more, with a little bit of backup from Bel; she's seen something a bit familiar and takes a risk, to pull on a thread. The look on her face. Serena liked this person, as Oswen likes Leonidas. ADV Persuasion nat 20. They were romantically entangled; they had a life together for about a year, in this city. In that time she shared her secret with him but it seemed like he already knew somehow. But she was most concerned about revealing it, and caught unaware that he knew it and was more interested in **how she did it**. Shortly after that he disappeared completely. Nobody could find him anywhere. She felt tricked and betrayed; went on a bit of a rampage thinking it was the Gods, or whatever other kind of game, but it wasn't that. She still does not know who this person is or where he's gone. But no magic can find him. This was hundreds of years ago.

Serena also claims that she's not responsible for the strange missing memory the Oracle had.

So Serena has set in motion something that imperils Remos, the only one she cares about, just to make a point. And that's why she says she's staying. But of Remos is as good as she says he is, there's no way he'll leave. Serena seems to believe she can somehow keep him out of danger personally; it's too late to stop the titans.

Oswen retorts, losing patience now, "*You* can stop them!"

"No, I can't. It's too late. You think you can stop the mass hysteria now?

Oswen looks surprised at that. "Stop it? No of course not, now we have to *lean into it!* Another vision - the evil gods are waking the titans, but the good gods have become aware and will rise to fight them before they make landfall. Or perhaps the *reason* the titans rise is revealed to be that they wish to fight amongst themselves; they will clash, perhaps in unoccupied land or out to sea. There are many such things we could consider."

Serena snorts, "*Fine*. You want to play the game? I'll let you play the game. If you think you can find part of their twisted, layered mythology of lies that will do what you want, then I'll place another vision into the mind of the Oracle. *One*. *Once*."

### Early evening

We head out once again. We've seen and heard about the Archive Of Akros; that's the place to go.  We unfurl the carpet on the previous landing ground and make a beeline.

It's a very impressive building. We touch down near the entrance. The city is busy, in a nervous sense. The official vote is tomorrow but many seem almost ready to vote with their feet right now!

A couple of gatherings outside group around people trying to sway the vote. Maybe we'll try our own gathering if we have some ammunition! Inside someone tries to help based on our vague explanations of what we want. The last time the Titans were sent to sleep was "The Clash", but there's also Akrosian history. We figure that this city is, we now know, where this whole thing has started and it hasn't had too much time to spread yet. This is the place to convince. Let's try the history.

Bel helps Oswen search, with found texts passed to Inafina and Kindle to look over. INV 20, we find a reference that the leviathan attacked unsuccessfully once. It has defended itself once before. So now we need to find something on that time period. INV 26. They built the citadel - the fortress - and within that was placed an Offering Brazier. Only those with conviction and belief could activate it. This in turn activates the Akrosian Defenders, the two colossi. These are titans in their own right. They seem to just be simple stone statues though! And it was a long time ago. The importance and role of the fortress has diminished over time.

It worked once, anyway.

At least this explains the faction that want the military to take over. Perhaps those believe this is the answer. So, if there was a vision - that someone is able to light that brazier, and that the two Defenders then animated and moved out to sea and defended from the titan, as told in the old stories - the two of them emitting the Light of Helios from their eyes - then that's what we seed.

* We remind people of this mythology as best we can
* Serena meanwhile plants the vision of this defence actually happening
* Then titan *will* rise and everyone *is* vindicated, but it means that we have different subsequent story to tell
* To lean into this further we probably have to somehow get more weight into the vote for the military option, then, as the right answer

We'll need a hero. The kind of person that people will believe could light this brazier. ADV INV 24. Last time, it was a person who was "pure and neutral". A teenager. The old "quiet saviour" routine. Unassuming folk hero.



### Mid evening

That'll have to do, time is short. We need to figure out if this brazier is actually really lit, or if it's fake, or what! Can we just put oil in it and throw in a match?! So we need to get to the thing and examine it. And that's non-trivial. So we leave, but outside, with more crowds gathered, Oswen asks Bel for his best performance. We need to sell this myth - this story - YES the titans *are* coming but we *are* defended. Just like before. Voting for the army option is not voting for a mere army, that cannot possibly succeed. Lean into it all and bring up a groundswell of pride in the history of this city.

Bel uses the Mantle again! Oswen tries to help; we're really trying to deceive, in that this all only comes true if people believe, but if they don't, it all fails!

ADV deception is 12,13+13 -> 26. One of the other speakers here who favoured a military response pitches in and supports us. He spins a story of the city sending its "best, purest people" to light the brazier. Another group - those who were proud and wanted to stay - well, they see that wind blowing and lean the same way; it can benefit them too.

We manage to extricate ourselves as the whole group of people start gathering momentum on their own. Oswen wants to use Sending to Serena but it won't work - it's divination-based. We'll have to go there in person and explain the details of the vision. Whatever it is that Serena takes from that and shows the Oracle is up to her. This time, we take the carpet right next to the entrance and leave it hovering.

Serena's response is almost mischievous - she suggests that the vision shows the Oracle herself lighting the brazier! We talk her out of *that*.

She seems surprisingly enthusiastic - and in fact has only seen the Colossi "once before" - ah, she was here last time! So she says she'll honour the deal. And we know the vision will be "realistic" since it's based on first-hand encounter.

Right. Out once *again*. The carpet is a bit damp though! Sea spray.

### Later evening (dark)

Now we need to head out and down, under the bridge on this side perhaps and keep close to the deck so we're maybe harder to sea? We need to try and sneak into this fort. We fly under the deck and down on the far side; the carpet hovers some way below, but we can climb from here and Bel casts Invisibility on all of us.

A courtyard near the back... Presumably that's the side opposite where the bridge comes in. Back there is a small service road heading out with a small gatehouse next to the gate in this wall that the road heads out from. The wall here is 20ft high, the entrance about 9ft tall as a kind of tunnel through what we see is a good 8ft wide wall section, and we can easily see patrols above. Going through the gate would require picking the lock and that could leave a trace since we'd find it tricky to lock behind us. Going over seems a better bet.

Inafina wind-walks up the wall and keeps just below. From up here, she can see the patrols and realises that we're better off going this way to access the courtyard via some interior roofs, rather than trying to navigate below. We use the rope of climbing once the patrols are at an appropriate point and Inafina leads the way that she saw. Across the roof we go - Kindle uses Steps Of Night to avoid even really walking on the roof and Inafina likewise. Bel and Oswen are a bit clattery! Bel's OK but Oswen slips and starts to skid down the roof - Kindle quickly picks her up, hearing her slide. It's bery strange to be picked up by someone invisible, especially when you're also invisible!

The guards hear something - they walk back and look around. We freeze. Kindle only has about a minute for his spell. A loose single is spotted. "Possums!" says one. They head off, to warn the Quartermaster that possums might be going after food. We hurry!

The courtyard we reach is small. A couple of trees and some plantings, and one brazier dominates the space. The whole thing is only 20ft x 20ft at most. A door leading outwards, towards the back of the fort.

Oswen thinks that there might be a trick to the brazier. Someone long ago doing exactly what we're planning on doing. But that said, she starts off from a magical perspective, because maybe there's more to this and it'll keep her invisible; ARC 31. She sees old runes, possibly Elven; she will show that to Inafina, who speaks the language. There's a sense of magical residue here. It's a sense of being incomplete. A jigsaw puzzle with a missing piece. And something new, that she's never encountered before. There's magic here but it's... *Dormant*. Broken. It needs to be repaired somehow. Does the belief somehow "repair" it; they *need* it to work, enough self-belief does the trick? But she needs it to be reliable! She'll have to risk losing invisibility.

Inafina first, though, reads the runes. She tries to explain what she's read but it's tricky because she doesn't understand them herself. The words are familiar but the writing is not Akrosian or even from this plane. It *is* old Elven, like we've seen elsewhere; especially in the Fey Wild. That suggests this item is much older than we might expect for this world and this place. Someone brought this brazier here and it was very old even then. The runes are imbued with power. Elven, but also arcane. They're not activated and she's not sure how to do so. The runes are part of this puzzle but, again, not all of it.

Oswen wishes she had Legend Lore, but she didn't swap that in this morning - last night was a... Lot. And she didn't think of it. Kindle says he could try asking Yondalla, but would become visible too. Oswen can use Detect Magic but that's shaky, and if we got overheard and only had time for one spell, well, Legend Lore would be It. So Kindle starts his prayer.

Symbols appear in the air all around him. He looks at them in surprise, then confusion, but then recognition. At that moment, Inafina hears a door on an adjacent one - an open-sided kind of corridor building - that would give a view in here. Kindle hides! We hear the person walk past, into the next door and then there's a loud conversation about... Possums.

Kindle has to cast invisibility on himself for us to get out. He tells us that he understands more now, but we need other information - "we have to leave here, and I'll explain more" - so we use the rope to get back up and out, and sneak back to the carpet. It's uneventful. Guard eyes are trained out to sea and the general unusually high amounts of commotion in the city create distracting noise and movements up and above where we're sneaking.

On the carpet, we learn that a group of Leonin brought this in from wilderness plains nearby, north of the coast. It comes from elves of the Fey Wild, who have ancient knowledge they brought with them from the various worlds they retreated from when they retreated to the Fey. It's the Mythal. It requires a lot of magical power to activate and control. A "real" Mythal is created by a large number of elven mages and is a permanent effect - like the one at Silverymoon - but it's a similar technology, imbuing the statues with power.

Kindle suspects that the "belief" required isn't in the titans or colossi, but in the person who activates them. That person needs to have great self belief. We're not sure if they need to be pure or not. "We need to go and speak to this tribe of Leonin!" he announces. "They're - out on the plains somewhere..."

But where? We fly out of town and into the countryside a while. But the plains here are huge. Oswen asks to set down, to try Divination. But who to ask? Oswen thinks - Keranos, knowledge and storms. So the 10m later and another block of incense and - "Learned Keranos, please tell me where to find the nearest Leonin who can explain how to activate the brazier in the fort."

Embers float up into the sky until they look almost like stars, and as we look up we see a line of actual stars - not unlike the Milky Way - and the wind blows the embers in a specific direction, along the same line. "That way!" declares Oswen.

Inafina keeps watch. Perception 25. Kindle 17. Bel 19. Oswen 17. All quite high, especially Inafina (just based on sight, non-ADV for hearing). Distant lights. Will take at least an hour. We settle in.

These are open plains, quiet, the occasional large tree or tiny settlement off to the sides. All very low-lying. We're flying high enough to get a good line of sight, but low enough to hear things running through the grass below and are keeping pace with us! They're mostly hidden by long grass but sometimes we get glimpses of what *look* like lion people. So these are Leonin, but not necessarily *the* Leonin we want.

### Late evening

Two of these lion people are still running with us. Those two joined early and kept with us. As we start to set down, one leaps up to try and land on the carpet with us! Nat 19, so it's a success! She's brandishing a spear. "Halt! What business do you have with the Alseid?"

Oswen goes, "Good evening! We're hoping to find out more about that brazier in the fort at Akros, because the titans are coming and..." - but Kindle interrupts, "I seek the **Athoz** tribe". The Leonin hisses. "That name has not been used in centuries. Where did you hear it?"

We explain as best we can. We're told we need to speak to what amounts to their circle's shaman, more or less. She tells us to land the carpet which of course we do and, from there, we are accompanied - with great distrust, unsurprisingly - until eventually we see an older, whitish-grey fur female elder, who despite the evident age holds a regal posture. She approaches and introduces herself as **Oramane** - the Chieftess. An obviously-shaman male then emerges from a hut. The expected bones and trinkets hung on necklaces! A thinner mane, again, older though not as old as the Chieftess. "Welcome to the Pride of the Night Eye. You have questions about our ancestors? I am **Teox**. I am the keeper of the lore. Please, will you share our fire with us?"

"Most kind!"

We do our best to explain. The titans rising but only because of belief, the need to light the fire in the brazier. Teox says that there are a few of them who sometimes leave, wanderers, leaving at sundown and heading into the planes on vision quests. They return changed, with experiences and items that their tribe cannot explain. Some leave again; others mix with other tribe wanderers; and the Athoz are a group of such wanderers, who over time gathered in significant numbers. They thus brought back quite a few artefacts on their various adventures. The stories of the "brazier" say it was installed at the fortress, as we have seen. The tribe today are the descendants but they no longer wander, they are not star-spanning travellers anymore so no longer call themselves Athoz.

We ask about the way to light the brazier. There's a legend; a selfless one. Someone who would lay down their lives. Akros was in that lore considered a pinnacle of excess, of hubris; they thought they could transcend human nature through civilisation. The god of the polis, of civilisation, rules their lives. Everything is for the good of the many; but are those who claim to be doing things for the good of the many *actually* believe that. If they do, then they wield enough belief to power the "missing piece" of that artefact.

"Does it destroy that person to do so?"

"They have to be *willing* to lay down their life. They have to believe it so."

The "shepherd's boy" myth we read about - that person wasn't elevated as a hero, a saviour of everything; that person was never found. Instead they live on in story. So perhaps they *did* die.

"I don't know if they are actually destroyed. But what's more important is that they did believe they may be destroyed and yet were still willing to lay down their lives."

Remos seems like a good bet. We could do it, and we'd disappear just like the previous person apparently did since we'd leave this plane after. But Remos is more "full circle". He hopefully would survive or maybe merge back to Serena, who knows, but for one part of her to manipulate people into manipulating the gods into raising the titans, then for another part of her to undo it, has a symmetry and maybe even proves her point that she can indeed defy their will. Oswen doesn't think that actually holds, but Serena might see it that way. We've certainly never really understood the "logic" of this world all that much!

We bid farewell. It's time to get back to the city; another hour or so of flight will mean it's quite late once we get back there. On the way, Oswen uses L3 Sending to Remos. "It's Oswen. We met at the pool. Extraordinary rumours about the Colossi; want to meet? I'll buy the drinks."

"Yes... I thought that description sounded like you! I must confess I'm curious. A drink on the Terrace."

Oh, the hotel, then. And we fly the carpet straight there!

### 10pm at the hotel terrace

We are greeted by surprised but tolerant staff who offer us buckets and brushes for our - we realise - rather muddy boots! Cleaned up we're told we are expected; Remos is behind a screened-off area for privacy.

He's heard the story *we* have been spreading. We'd hoped it wouldn't be attributed to us! "How much have you had to drink?" asks Oswen. "Just the one". "Not enough! I'll order another..."

Once the drinks are here and we've had a little, Oswen asks, "Bear with me if this seems circuitous. What is your belief in the way that gods are born or created?"

"Huh. Very interesting you should say that..." - he shares that he, himself, is not a religious man. But he appreciates that others believe. He considers it a necessary part of civilisation, helping explain things and giving people hope. It makes them moral. Be believes that all living beings are responsible for themselves. That to use the gods to explain things is to not take accountability. "But this is, obviously, a very personal view; I realise that it can be a very naive things to hold onto these kinds of beliefs - of the goodness of every person."

Oswen gets into the sales pitch! If belief mattered, if you believed in the titans and believed in this option to protect people... He argues back that people should leave to be safe, in case it didn't work. Well if *someone* were to take the lead and go to the fort, so that others were free to go, believing that they were the right balance of answers to solve this problem...

Inafina - insight 22 - he seems to truly have no personal agenda. He just does what needs to be done. So Inafina interjects with, "To do the job, to protect the people, to let those leave who wish to leave without bias or guilt, and to take the chance since it exists to protect the city if that is indeed possible - would put *you* in *that* fort."

"I am more than willing to do it. I just want to make sure I've done everything I can to help the people who want to leave; and most importantly, I want to give them the right of return - so when they come back, they can resume their lives. That their properties, livelihoods, businesses, houses, farms, shops - are not seized by opportunists. I want people to be safe. If it means voting to let the fort play a part in the defence - activate the emergency powers - I could see reason to do that. I'll happily be at the fort. If someone needs to activate this thing, even though nobody knows how it works, sure! I'll give it a go; I'll do what needs to be done. I'll defend the people."

Oswen says, "Well, that sounds like this is what you believe to be the best course of action on balance?"

"Yes. On balance. The logic leads me to this conclusion. I don't *believe* it. I think this is the right thing to do."

"And you're sure it's the right thing to do? We do not mean to coerce, we want to be sure this is a sound decision based on facts, as you say."

"...But what is in it for YOU? Why are you doing this?"

We try to explain as best we can. Our "mission" here to find information; getting wrapped up in local events. And when he presents a question to, say, rescue him before he lights the brazier but is about to be killed, or rescue a caravan of 50-100 people trying to escape, but their path blocked by the Leviathan; well, we say we'd hope to rescue him *because* he can then light the brazier, activate the colossi and thus the caravan is saved *also*. He laughs at this - he agrees; we recognise it could be hubris but we reject those false dichotomy choices. We try to find another answer. We refuse to be bound only by those options.

There is more discussion; of the vote, logistics, the military role in helping evacuation and protecting against (say) looters rather than a military role that's power-hungry and negative; and in the end, we go to bed. Remos insists on paying "you know how it would look if you paid for my drinks and then I changed my vote tomorrow?!" and finally, close to midnight, we get to bed.
