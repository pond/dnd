# Oswen: Part 2.15
## Campaign Day 36, early evening
### "The Stump", plane of Shankarbhumi

A creature **wearing Vecna's eye** stands before us. Initiative from the hydra turtle battle continues:

* Bel (nat 20) 23
* Inafina 22
* Oswen (also nat 20) 22
* Dukha 19 - is just hunkered down on the raft
* Kindle 18
* (New arrival after)

After shouting his rage, strange energy starts to radiate more clearly off the new arrival and - at least to Oswen - this certainly seems to be the source of the evil in the area. Glancing quickly at the others nearby she sees they're having similar emotional responses. The creature drifts forward a little towards where the hydra once was; a hand rises as their cowl falls back a little - a fiendish white, opal boned face with skin peeling off, two eyes, one a small pinprick; and a 30ft cone blasts out, a hypnotic gaze effect falls onto Inafina - WIS save, ADV thanks to Intellect Fortress - 17 total. She resists and becomes immune to the effect. Now the even-more enraged creature casts a spell and water elemental emerges right in front of the raft.

The elemental acts immediately. It rears up and tries to engulf everyone in a torrent of water. STR saving throw. Everyone on the raft fails their STR saves. We all take 22 damage and it's enough for Oswen to lose her concentration on her Intellect Fortress spell; Kindle holds Moonbeam and Bel holds Cloud of Daggers; but he and Dukha are restrained (but thankfully we all have Water Breathing, from Tinjhorna's blessing earlier). Oswen can see Kindle is able to breathe and trusts his strength; she calls to Bel, "They'll be OK, we must focus on the Eye!"

Bel moves his dagger cloud over the creature. It's *just* able to move that far. 6d4->15 damage. He's also able to heal Dukha for 12.

Inafina runs in and attacks with the staff. The first hits with a staff charge for only 12 damage (1 on the d8 lighting) and uses Stunning Strike. Success! The thing is stunned and slowed down. She hits again; this time she uses 2 charges but on *that* hit notices that they don't do so much and shouts back "Lightning doesn't hurt it much!", 13 bludgeoning damage and 12->6 lightning, and it loses its elemental spell! Nice. A flurry of 3 blows with advantage all hit, but no crit, damage just a bit below the middle, 30 total from all three.

Oswen sees this and presses the advantage; she jumps out of the boat and gets to some nearby boggy land in case Water Walk fails, hoping to avoid clogging up the raft for Kindle. She didn't think of an opportunity attack and none comes; she doesn't think much of that - but hasn't realised that. ARC nat 20! 33 -> realises that she made a mistake, BUT it didn't attack because we didn't attack it and then she realises that our aggressor has lost control. She shouts back, "Kindle! Dukha! The lich thing has lost control of the elemental - don't attack the water!" Now she casts L4 Chromatic Orb, ADV means she just gets the hit, 6d8->28 fire damage - but again, it doesn't seem to have as much effect as expected. The fire almost causes the skin to crack more. Inside this wet thing is a core of infernal fire. And she kicks herself; of course! She saw it steaming. In her hurry she forgot. She calls out, "Don't use lightning or fire on the bad guy!" then to Orvil, "Try and help him out of the water - drag his foot with your beak if you have to!"

Dukha gets STR check ADV. But doesn't get out.

Kindle tries too and manages to shake out of the grip. He runs over next to stand between Oswen and the bad guy. He casts L2 Healing Word for Oswen, 13 healed.

The bad guy is still stunned! Can't do a thing - and it's in the cloud of daggers still. 6d4->15 more damage. Meanwhile, the water elemental makes a choice - and it just leaves, disappearing, ripples going under the raft - *towards* the bad guy. It rears up next to them and Inafina, having (WIS save succeeded) realised that it was controlled and it is *angry*. Its two swipes do miss, though, despite advantage (attack 1,6 rolled both times).

Bel tries L4 Psychic Lance. "I don't know what your name is but - you! You over there!" he calls out. INT 16 save. ADV, since it has spell resistance and it makes the save (9, 18 rolled). "Rats!" exclaims Bel, but it makes him aware of the spell resistance. "He's resistant to magic!" - at least he gets some damage; 21->10, due to making the save. With his bonus action, he turns one of his spells into a Bardic Inspiration which he gives to Oswen.

Inafina continues the assault. Crit on the staff! 14 + 8 -> 14 + 4 -> 18 total; and it resists her Stunning Strike. She calls out, "No so lucky this time, watch out!" - and attacks again; 12 + 4->2 this time; another flurry - all three hit; 3d8+18 equiv., 35 damage total. He's looking rough - but to our surprise, *this* time acts immediately in reaction. Not stunned anymore! The eye starts to glow, pulses, makes Inafina have a sort of headache... Then a green ray shoots out. She's about to be hit square in the face as she's going to dodge in the wrong way, but Bel is yelling a warning and she manages to backflip, the ray - a ray of disintegration which would do 10d6+40->78 damage - singing her whiskers as it passes just above her nose. (Heroic inspiration burned). A tree behind her is hit and disintegrates into powder. Thanks to her Evasion, she takes no damage at all, not even half. Only Inafina notices at that moment that the eye is seemingly acting of its own accord.

Oswen loses a fraction of a second in shock. She recognised the spell and knew Inafina could've been obliterated.

All she's got is Chromatic Orb, at this point, and she has nothing to lose. L5. She tries Thunder this time - it seems adjacent to the elemental-like damage which it previously resisted. 33 damage and it seems to take it all. It seems to be just clinging on. She calls out, "Thunder works!"

Dukha is recovering, finds the pole and shoves the raft back against the swampy land where Kindle and Oswen stand. Kindle moves the Moonbeam on top of the bad guy; ADV CON 18, potential 4d10->30 damage; save made, 15 taken with no other effects. 7 healing to Oswen, too.

Bad guy acts! It Misty Steps a fair distance further away from us on to a small marshy patch and well clear of the moonbeam. It seems to "suck in" magic from around - and then a L5 fireball appears, aimed straight at the main party! It's almost centred on Kindle, but it's being pulled a little over to hit Inafina and the water elemental. Thankfully this means Dukha is *just* outside the very edge of range and, therefore, so is Orvil, by chance, since he had been trying to help Dukha pull away from the water elemental.

10d6->44! Very high. DEX saves. Oswen 21, takes 22. Inafina takes full brunt but Evasion means she also "only" takes 22. Elemental fails - but is resistant to fire - 22 damage. Hissing of steam, water boiling. Kindle - nat 1 - heroic inspiration - Nat 20. He takes 22 also and he holds his Moonbeam. Bel makes the save, 22 damage. Even so, one L5 spell did 110 damage and *could've* done 220. The raft is aflame and all sorts of drift wood around is too; Bel's save involved him rolling onto the marsh, Dukha likewise; both are wet and muddy. Orvil flies backwards. The raft will definitely be lost in the flames in a moment.

The water elemental moves in and starts slam attacks. Once again it misses, but finally on its fourth attack (over its two rounds against the creature) it gets a hit, 10 damage, knocks the bad guy prone.

Bel has lost Cloud of Daggers. Distance is an issue now, but he manages to move to be within 60ft, but then has a different idea of what to do next - we're *all* hurt badly. L5 Mass Cure Wounds gives *everyone* 27hp back - negating the fireball and more. He burns another L1 spell to give Inafina bardic inspiration and calls out, "'Fina! Get him! He messed up my best tunic!"

Inafina has just enough move movement to flank the bad guy with water elemental. She gets a staff hit; 14 damage, and 1 lightning. And it's the 1 lightning that does it! It arcs over the creature and it just sort of - loses cohesion; the fire goes out, the bones fall away leaving a rather disgusting mass of clothes and flesh half-afloat and the eye pops out - literally, pops out, up into the air - attack roll to grab it, 3+bardic 5+10, and almost without thinking she catches it.

**WIS save.**

It's only 14. The party is too far to help. She's immediately stunned and a Crown of Madness takes effect. A spectral crown of thorns appears on her head. Oswen ARC 31, and she immediately realises what's happened and shouts out a warning and reacts with Counterspell. CON save for the *Eye*, nat 2 (rolled by Inafina) - total is only 7. The crown shatters almost immediately but Inafina stands, motionless.

Oswen (now on her turn) shouts, "We have to get that Eye out of her hand and into a bag!" - Kindle shouts, "We need to break its hold on her first" - so Oswen runs forward 30ft, brings up Manfiest Mind (bonus action) at 30ft out next to Inafina, casts Remove Curse through it, Inafina recovers but drops the eye and it starts to fall towards the water.

All Dukha can really do is watch. Kindle is about 60ft away, as was Oswen, so runs up alongside Oswen and uses his ring of shooting stars to cast Faerie Fire *on the Eye* just before it hits the water and starts to sink. Now it glows as it goes down, making it much easier to trace...

...The water elemental leaves...

**...and the Marid appears!**

Oswen's eyes widen. Will it steal this item? But it speaks - "You've done it... You've banished it... You kept your word!" - and it seems surprised. It regards the party, who are all mid-action and looking very tense! "What's going on? What is this hostility?"

Oswen shouts out, "There is something we must catch but not with our hands and you **must not** touch it yourself!"

"The eye? Ah. They eye. No, you must not touch it. Where is it?"

Oswen (reluctantly) points. The Marid pushes its "hands" into the water next to it, then creates a small water spout which spring up, pushing the eye to the surface.

"Do you have any intentions? Are you going to let me leave?"

"You are not bound. And I can help 'push' you home if you need it" replies Oswen.

"You are certainly unusual. Living beings who are as noble as the beings of the elements. You are rare!" - it approaches Oswen, who's mostly distracted by that water spout holding the Eye, and pulls out of its 'simulated' garb a small pearl. It gives it to her. "If you are in need and have run out of options, I grant upon you the ability to call upon me once. If I am able, I will come. Then we shall have no further hold over each other."

It uses the water spout to create a wave which washes the eye onto the marsh upon which the bad guy was stood. Then in a torrent of "upside down rain", the Marid disappears upwards.

It all goes quiet. Oswen looks over her shoulder towards Bel as she opens the bag. Bel casts Levitate and Oswen moves her Bag of Holding under it. We're all standing closer at that point except Dukha who's by the remains of the raft, WIS saves again!

* Oswen 13 (including bardic inspiration)
* Inafina 6
* Kindle 24
* Bel 13 (despite advantage) - reaction; he casts Countercharm for Oswen, who now rolls 17

Bel and Inafina start to move to her to say "don't do that...!" but thanks to Bel's countercharm, she holds fast and the Eye drops into the bag - and the charm effect immediately ends.

For a minute it's quiet again, then Inafina spins arounds and almost pounds on Bel and gives him a huge hug saying, "Thank you!" - but then in the middle of that moment, Inafina, hearing perception, ADV - 24 - she hears muffled cries. Then realises, they're for help. She says, "Hey! I can hear - must be Nisha - over there!" - and points at the stump and she starts running over immediately. Bel notices the conch shell - it's big and has just dropped there, so the bad guy must've had it hidden away - so he picks it up and we follow.

It's a distance away, over water, but apparently we still have Water Walk on. Inafina's in the air but we travel over the surface. Nisha is inside the stump in a hollow, hands and feet bound. She's about 5ft down, so Inafina "walks" down starts untying knots, explaining who we are as she does so. She mentions the name - this person was none other than the last-Manivarshan-Trials-winner **Jijibisha Manivarshi** - "he's gone mad!" - and as the rest of us arrive we start filling in things; we get some of the story from her, she gets some from us and so-on. We wave over to Dukha who now heads over to us, water-walking too as the spell is in its last moments, the wreckage of the raft beyond saving. And so we all end up on this small island by the stump.

We give her the small conch, necklace and the book - knowing now that we *don't* need these to bring her back home. She didn't run away. In the convo:

* She says Jijibisha implied *he* had "sacrificed" Manivarsha
* She was in the stump to "be with" Adirohit given Nisha "worshipped Adirohit so much"
* He'd said "You do not know Adirohit, you would not worship her if you knew her like I knew her"

The question is *where* Adirohit has been hidden away, or banished to and how we might get in contact. There is the helm but they'd have to be nearby and not very annoyed by us using it (Tinjhorna did warn us against that).

Perhaps the conch is significant. It's revered, was in the river and was the one thing that was stolen in this recent attack. Taking Nisha makes sense, taking the conch less so. Oswen examines it (religion check, nat 20 + 5 -> 25). Well, it's not a magical item and isn't really even a relic of any particular power as far as she can tell. It's a trophy item. Yes, it's very old and sacred in that sense, but it's not in and of itself magical. It is certainly of great *ritualistic* significance. Passed from generation to generation.

She finds a dry area nearby and sets up for Divination, ritual. As it starts she blows the conch - just in case - and tries reaching out specifically to Adirohit. "Where are you?". The incense smoke fills all around us, just normal smoke, but there is no reply otherwise. Minutes pass. People are watching expectantly. But no effect, apparently; it has failed. Adirohit is not a god? Or is simply gone, or at least far enough beyond reach as to be uncontactable?

So, no outcome.

We have some food and water. Nisha thinks the conch spell was taken because Jijibisha thinks the conch was stolen from him *by Nisha*, trying to usurp him as the last and greatest of all Manivarshans (he was the last to win the trials before the city fell). She thinks *she* was attacked because she was first since to be claiming victory as a Manivarshan.

The stump was of the oldest tree known in the world, chopped down for reasons unknown just before those last Trials and on sacred ground in old Manivarsha. So we're still on that ground.

We wonder if Tinjhorna's memory of "they do not know what they are doing" from Adirohit was perhaps the moment of the tree-felling. But we aren't druids. We can't bring back the tree... But Bel pipes up, "I do have Plant Growth!" - is there any life left in this stump? It has been a century. "I can try..." - and we agree, definitely worth it. So Bel casts, on the stump. There's a reaction; a strange effect that seems to absorb the spell but *turns it necrotic* somehow. "That's very weird!" says Bel, distressed... Oswen Arcana 28 as this happens; there are runes, carved around the tree, into its bark. An ancient curse! The curse draws upon an ancient life, to bind and banish - imprison - a creature or a thing. The tree needed to be as old and/or revered as the thing it binds. She thinks that runes are part of the binding magic and Remove Curse might be enough, so she casts (albeit at L4, since all L3s exhausted) Remove Curse.

The runes crack and fade; that works, at least. The magic is gone. She is about to say something to Bel but suddenly the divination magic smoke, that's mostly dispersed, coalesces above the stump and starts to whirl around her, in a tempest. She feels droplets of water making her damp. "I am here! I have been trapped!" says a voice in her - then a crazy wave of thoughts flood her mind. Visions.

* This is very definitely Adirohit.
* She raised this land up  many years ago to create Manivarsha.
* She's been locked away under the stump, once the oldest tree in the temple devoted to her. This island is where that temple once stood.
* Jijibisha did this.
* Jijibisha made a deal with a wicked god, some kind of evil divine powers - fiendish powers - and he *cheated* in the Shankar Trials using that.
* Adirohit was so outraged at this dishonouring - winning through deceit - just for personal glory - that she punished him.
* Adirohit, through the temple, instructed the people of Manivarsha, to stop the Trial; to disqualify Jjijbisha and prohibit him from competing, disqualifying the city. But the people refused! They asked Adirohit to turn a blind eye this once and would punish Jjijbisha after, but didn't want to dishonour their whole city.
* Adirohit was outraged at the idea of Jjijbisha returning in glory as a hero with the conch.
* She almost lost her mind at this; decided the people were wicked, could not be saved; she made the city once - she could make it again. And she sunk the whole city under the waves.
* But Jjijbisha could not be killed! He too went mad. Recognising that the events were linked, he believed the opposite side - Manivarsha sacrificed itself for his glory, for him to be the greatest Manivarshan ever. And so he used the power of the Eye to bind, silence and banish Adirohit within the tree - a tree that he felled.
* And so it was that Adirohit was gone for a century, and the land withered.

She "thinks" back, "Jjijbisha is banished. The evil that possessed him is contained and we will convey it to another plane, seeking its destruction."

Adirohit says, "free me" and Oswen realises that she's still *bound* by the curse. But she's used all of her power that she can muster today; all it needs is a bit more magic. Bel is able to make one last casting high enough - and she would like the tree to grow. Nisha is keen to know what's going on, but all Oswen says is, "Step back a little from the stump" and nods to Bel. But she realises people didn't know Adirohit was directly responsible. Jjijbisha went mad, but Adirohit went mad first. Yet all of this is Vecna. She "thinks" to Adirohit, "We are casting now, it should free you. But you *must* wait a moment and speak more before you leave. Much has time passed and thinks are not as they were."

A bristling response. The notion of "you dare command a God"... But Bel is casting anyway, up at L4. Plant Growth. There is an *eruption* of life from the tree. New shoots and small branches arch upwards; in seconds, a a small tree, not large but not a sapling either, stands above us. Dew and smoke dissipate and coalesce, a tall blueish-green being with shimmering scales as skin, some 10ft tall, flowing hair, small white flowers.

"FREE AT LAST!" - a deep breath. Looks around. "What's happened?!" - a tempest within. Very short tempered.

Oswen whispers, "Bel I'll need your help with this one" and then calls out, "Forgive us, mighty Adirohit, but more than a century has passed" - and Nisha has already fallen to her knees, bowing. Dukha is backing away, scared. Oswen continues, "With you bound and Jjijbisha remaining, the land decayed. It has been over 110 years. The generations alive today do not know of your part in Manivarsha's destruction and revere you memory."

Nisha overhears *that*. "What are you saying?!" - she stands, pushing Oswen away "You blasphemer!"

"No, girl. She speaks the truth. My divine punishment lay this wicked, corrupted, evil city low."

Nisha whips around, shocked. "Wh - what? What do you mean? No!"

Oswen starts speaking very quickly trying to relay the story but is interrupted. "They disobeyed me! They disobeyed my commands! My children turned against me. They had to be destroyed."

Nisha starts to realise just how powerful Adirohit is. And they *are* a god, and a potentially vengeful one at that. So reverence turns to both fear and respect. And apprehension.

Oswen says to Adirohit, "I like to think that your judgement was coloured by a recognition of the evil that had infected Jjijbisha. The god of which you speak is called Vecna. The evil that corrupted your champion and - *perhaps* - the city - was in his Eye. We have this. This is the object we will take away and destroy."

No response. Then after a while, Adirohit says, "There is much work to be done. I will raise this land once more. There will be city here again. My temple will be destroyed." Looking to Nisha - "You call yourself a Manivarshan. You have the blood in you?" A frightened Nisha haltingly answers "Yes". "Good. We will resurrect the great city of Manivarsha. I will bless you and your children. I will lift this land physically and you will lift its status. Call back our children. May the stories serve as a warning to those who would seek to disobey... This time we will be greater than before."

Oswen figured we might have some time to move away here, but no - **the ground starts trembling**. The lands starts to lift, in large chunks, fractures; ours stays intact, most do; water cascades away, swirling in terrible currents; ruins start to appear; and within a minute or so, no more waterfalls! We're at the level of the land above. We rise yet further. Water is pushed back. **Massive** elemental power is being drawn upon. Water is being cleaned, currents are being commanded; there is no tidal wave upstream from this act - the river is reestablished and drawn down.

Nisha stands paralysed in fear hanging onto Kindle, but he falls as the ground shakes along with Oswen; Bel and Inafina hold their balance, just about; Dukha is on his knees with head in hands.

Now golden hour sunlight is streaming in, *through* Adirohit, gleaming and refracting in bright sparkles and beams. Eventually, she seems spent; exhausted; leans back against the tree. But she reaches out to the party - "I bless you for freeing me!" - she puts her hands together and, flowing out from them, we see an intricate white jade statue forming. She gives it to Inafina, who is the closest person still standing, and Inafina almost drops it - the statue is 2ft tall and very heavy. It's a statue of Adirohit, of course! The statue holds an elemental gem in one hand and fist-sized sapphire in the other. They are held in a way that lets them be removed and replaced easily. "I bless you. May my children and those of water have no dominion over you."

**(The entire party has Water Breathing - forever! - as do Nisha and Dukha)**

Oswen, on the ground in the mud says, "Thank you. You might wish to seek your child, Tinjhorna, without whose bravery we would not have succeeded."

"He lives! Yes. I will do so..." - and she flows away. A river dolphin forms, swimming rapidly away.

Dukha is trembling. "Is she - is she gone?"

"She is gone."

We stow the statue in the portable hole and wonder what next to do. The landscape around is unrecognisable. Walkable, in fact. We'll have to follow the river upstream. There's dry land, marsh, streams, ruins - just a mess - in this area. The more "coherent" city remains are visible beyond. And so we walk.

Eventually we get to the old city we recognise, on foot. It's more or less dark, but we find the boat - sticking out from a rooftop, quite high up and not much use! But Kindle has Steps Of Night, so between him and Inafina they manage to bring it down. We take it to the riverside and can see that these were actually old docks. Nisha is in shock! She is using the docks of Manivarsha for the first time in a century. This could be rebuilt. But should it be? The horrifying realisation of what happened. Must they rebuild on penalty of more aggression? Or can it be by choice?

We will set up a hut, atop a ruined building - Dukha is even more cautious than usual. "I will be on patrol. But do not let your guard down." "We will not. And if you get into trouble, we will be listening."

In practice, the upheaval has likely scared things away that might get curious, but not in the middle of the night! It's quiet and we sleep, although our heads are spinning. Conversation is muted. It's as if we're dodging the issues. Nisha's full of questions, but they seem almost rhetorical. We don't have many answers. We can only really advise her to talk to temple elders.



## Campaign Day 37

In the morning Nisha is talking about going to the Radiant Citadel. She wants to see her parents; but she must talk to the Ancients. The Speakers. The weight of the responsibility. There isn't much we can do other than be supportive. She's trying to accept her fate. She starts to think in terms of opportunity. She can see the Citadel, make things better. We point out that those people here now know directly of Vecna's influence and can be more mindful, more able to defend against it.

Dukha has been sleeping on the street downstairs. We leave him to sleep a while. He's been in a scrap, presumably overnight as a tiger, but is otherwise fine.

All of us just about all manage to squeeze into the boat! It's slower, pushing against the current, with breaks for us to change over pushing the boat. We learn a lot more about what life here is like. Cultural traditions, insight into this place and its people. She's not sure how the existing riverines will respond to this restoration of an old hierarchy. Who knows... The other cities must be told... None of this can be secret. The effort must be made jointly.

She asks to be taken to the city of Sagrapoor directly. There's a heroes welcome of course, lots of thanks, she's found her parents; she insists we'll say goodbye before we go, and wants to go to the Citadel with us. But we slip with away with Dukha in the mean time and get back downstream again to the river people. We have hammock nets to return!

The river people heard "the craziest rumours". They saw mists clearing. Manivarsha raised? We explain in outline. Adirohit back; if exploring, take care there might be danger; if you live there, you'd be accepting Adirohit's rule. And that's why the river people say they like being separate. They've always floated on the outsides and might now choose to set up further away than the used to. There's no protection from the riverines either, but that's their call. Dukha says that the roles of travellers like *him* is to commune with the smaller spirits. They don't rule cities. But they're important, and he's now first-hand aware of just how important that is! So he wants to leave and check if Tinjhorna is OK. The shrine was probably destroyed, the waterfall gone. He bids us farewell and we wish him luck. Bel asks if there's anything we can do for him? Can we repay him?

"If you ever find a cure for the - condition - we talked about, maybe let me know some day."

"Deal!"

"Until we meet again."

He's give another package of food from the river people and sets off back downstream.

The river people insist we stay for dinner. Will we stay here or at the city tonight? Well, we figure here - they've no riverine to look after them, after all! It ends up being a big community event. Lots of questions. We answer honestly, but remind them that this is sort of in confidence as the city folk may well react very badly to some of it until Nisha has had a chance to figure out how to break the news.

We find ourselves relaxing for the first time in a few days. We head back to the same reed bed as before and set up a camp; have some food; Oswen switches her attunement back to the amulet from the helm...

### 20400 XP => LEVEL 11 (16450 XP each bumped by DM to 20400 to effect a level bump once we leave)

...and we sleep.



## Campaign Day 38
### At the displaced river folk encampment, plane of Shankarbhumi

Oswen awakes, shaken by a realisation that she knows how to cast the same disintegration spell she saw in the Eye. She's also had dreams of gnomish invention, and that inspired use of materials and magic lent her towards some out-of-box thinking about teleportation magic, at which she thinks she finally understands things she once read about a spell which opens a portal between two significant distances through which any number of creatures might walk.

As her mind wandered before falling asleep she thought about being able to see the true nature of things; how often we have been deceived by invisibility or other ruse. She needs to ask a magic shop about that one! It's not likely to be cheap, though.

She opens up the portable hole and spends a while examining the curious statue(tte) of Adirohit. She thinks it's actually made of coral and holds two gems, one in each hand. Arcana 24. It's an idol, like one might find in temples. The gems could be removed from the hands, but it'd take a bit of effort. One is a ruby that looks very valuable. The other is a blue-green sapphire colour, but seems to actually be an emerald - it is is strongly magical; she spends a while ritual-casting Identify... A conjuration magic, connected to the Plane of Water. En elemental gem of some kind. If she had to, she could break the gem to summon a Water Elemental.

Bel has woken up and is watching her study the statuette. "What is it?" - Oswen does her best to explain it. Bel appraises it and thinks it would be worth a lot - *if* we were to sell it.

We wake up the other two and have breakfast. It's a bit sombre; did we do the right thing yesterday? Well, we did what we have to.

Kindle casts Water Walk. We swing by the river people to say goodbye. They're in a strange mood; unsure what the future holds. They can certainly sense the change - the shift in the currents (something of a metaphor, this far upstream of this particular river). Then we continue upriver. We're aiming for the temple where we were originally asked to chase after Nisha.

They've been busy, inevitably, with the rather grim business of rites, remembrance and so forth. Just... How to deal with all this. The community looks to them for answers. We are at least able to reassure them that it wasn't a river spirit at work! When we finish, we show them the statuette; that's not a good idea in *this* temple, but perhaps we might return it to Nisha. They do point out that while they don't know what Adirohit's intentions were, it was a gift. That's a good point and, ultimately, we decide to keep it. If we were to give it to a temple, it'd be for one that people were going to set up back down on Adirohit's river - and perhaps the god might feel spurned by the gift being returned thus.

We return back across the river (this time by barge) and try to find Nisha. Oswen, investigation 19+13 -> 32; she figures Nisha would go to the places where people gather, waiting for news. She'll be trying to be a leader, because she's been told she has to be; and that'd be a good place to go to start... Recruiting.

She's giving a speech, but the mood is strange. We listen. She doesn't sound confident. Her belief in Adirohit is shaken. It's coming out in what she's say. Oswen whispers to Bel - "she's being truthful; this is good; people must decide for themselves; but maybe she could use a bit of help... Perhaps a story through song...?"

Bel waves to get Nisha's attention and she's able to weave us into the story and calls us forward. Unnervingly the crowd parts and we walk through the gap in a bit of a hushed silence! Do do our best. People can verify the presence of the risen city for themselves easily enough; and we have the statue, which some older people in the audience seem impressed by - and yes, we perhaps *could* have dived down and found it under the water - but it seems too clean and dry, although old. They are fairly convinced and that seems to help with others. Bel, persuasion 16+12 -> 28; people here are already citizens and have homes here. But some, like Nisha, have a connection to Manivarsha. They could, if they choose to accept the complex nature of Adirohit, start a new life. "You cannot change history - the pain of the past - nor should you. But that doesn't mean you have to *live* there. You can build your own future."

Nisha rallies about at this. "And I choose to live there! Because I think that is the only way we can heal. This doesn't mean we stop being who we are. We can be stronger as a people - because every new Manivarshan will also have strong ties to another city. We will remember and honour these ties."

There are murmurs of agreement. Then some people call out that they want to come. One says, "You will need carpenters! My family will come!" then, "You will need gardeners!" - and so forth.

Inafina angles her head to indicate that this is a good time for us to leave. And with a wink at Nisha, she starts to quietly pad away and we follow her lead.

It's not been long since the wave but people are working hard to clean up. Much of the sludge/mud has been cleared, but is still piled in various mounds along streets. Aid is arriving from the Radiant Citadel - almost a caravan of various carts, coming down from the landing area, including drinking water because many fresh water wells were filled with mud. We hasten against the flow, given that there's a large crystal docked already. We catch up with a couple of empty carts that are heading back, and follow in their wake. It gets busier in this direction too, as we are joined by people who have decided to leave the city and head away to the Citadel.

It's busy at the docking area. A sort of loosely-organised chaos. There's no schedule, so we are free to depart on this crystal - they're confident everyone will fit. They don't know us, of course; being "incognito" like this, just more faces in the crowd, is actually quite calming.

Oswen asks Orvil to have a sharp-eyed look out as we head away, especially towards where Manivarsha has risen; we've not seen it from the air. And she sees through him that rafts and boats are already headed down. The three rivers now join more clearly into one bigger river. There are still some small waterfalls to where they join but now the mist has rolled back a long way, perhaps 10 miles or more, so there's still an "edge" to the landscape but it's much further away and we get the impression that it's not even closed to finished rolling back yet, either. In the middle of the wide, meandering giant of a river that now flows away, we see the ruins of the city. In thinning areas we get glimpses of the river much further away.

A moment later, we're no longer on that plane. Then there's the drama of the storm and, finally, the Deep Ethereal. A sudden feeling of calm as we exit the storm and see the soft lights of the Radiant Citadel. Inafina goes, "Oh!" surprised and Oswen looks over. "Strange feeling; another home?" she asks. Inafina nods. "It feels... Safe."

We have a better feeling for the size and geography of this strange land now and appreciate the view all the more.

And so we dock. On exit, we're all asked to let carts out first, then the rest of us disembark. The guards at the main gate wave to us; so *here* we are recognised as residents - the aura is visible to them.

"What now?" says Bel.

Oswen thinks for a moment and says, "I suppose I have to tell them. And then we'll know." - so she uses the "group sending stone", Arcana 22, and says:

**"Defeated evil creature in Shankarbhumi; imprisoned riverine Adirohit freed; we have the Eye! At Radiant Citadel now. Instructions please!"**

We wait. Oswen's just about to say out loud, "This is strange, there's no reply" - but at that moment, some 20-30 seconds after sending, two messages seem to return at once.

* Otto: "That is the first really good piece of news I've heard. Well done. Anyone - ideas? Is it safe for them to hold onto it?"

* Bigby: "Well done! Well done... Uuuh... I suggest getting somewhere safe and away from crowds! Be wary of your surroundings. It could be scryable? Maybe don't" - and he runs out of words.

A moment later...

* Alustriel: "Calm down everyone. Well done. Magnificent work. We should meet ASAP! Agreed, it is best kept hidden. But this buys us a chance."

* Mordenkainen: "Excellent. Coordinates ..." - and gives us coordinates! - "... let's meet. It's safe. 24 hour window. Password is ..." - and a password.

We wait a little longer but there are no other messages. We'd better let the Manivarshan know what happened... We head directly to the Court of Whispers and go where we went before, hoping he might be there. The same older assistant guy is still there and recognises us. "We bring good news for The Manivarshan!" Oswen confidently heads off in the wrong direction (HIS 4+5->9!) and we wander around for a while before Bel plucks up the courage to say, "This doesn't look right! We're lost, aren't we..."

So as a group, we work backwards to retrace our steps. Bel's as adept at HIS as Oswen and (rolls 17) takes a while but does eventually find the way.

At the courtyard with the old tea house, the Bullywog vendor is there and selling his wares. We buy various drinks and food! We end up telling *him* first (the short version) as he's very persuasive and gossipy; at least he gives us the food and drink for free as a result. A short discussion about the alignment of gods results and Oswen happens to mention Tiamat. The Bullywog lights up - he has news! She's on the move; tried escaping from her prison plane a few times, but now she has a new ally. She's gathering forces in a way that suggests she may be attempting to break free of her plane once more. Either that, or jockeying for a better position within Avernus. He was told this by some people who had returned from a mission in Avernus itself, but he doesn't know what the mission was for. **"If you wanted to find out more, they definitely look like they came back with some stuff and might be selling the spoils of their quest, here..."**

At the tea house we ask for the Manivarshan. The maitre de recognises us and we are brought through. Sweet tea and rose biscuits are on the way too!

The Manivarshan stands on our arrival and bows! "I've heard news! I've heard that you've been busy! But I don't know exactly what happened."

We start the story. When he realises we didn't go to any of the other places he'd listed for possible Eye locations, the penny drops. We don't speak of it by name, but he realises the Eye is in our possession; and he asks to read the tea leaves in our cups! "You could be in danger..." he says. And he's glad we're going somewhere other than - Here.

We get to tell him the whole story, excluding - at his request - "finding the thing" - the Eye. If he doesn't know, it's safer for everyone.

At the end of our story, we show him the statue. He recognises it instantly and there's a complex series of emotions that he tries to hide. Inafina (insight 15) sees this but can't pick up on everything. He certainly recognises the object but it might be the statue itself, or more a recognition of its significance. The immediate recognition seems unusual as even the people on the plane from which it came didn't have that same *instant* - almost personal - recognition. She says, "You are not so good at hiding emotions as you might wish. We have done much. And this conversation is strictly private."

"May I?" he asks and Oswen hands the statue over. He is *very* careful with it. There's a reverence of sorts. He knows *exactly* what this is. Eventually he sets it down on the table in front of him. He even closes his eyes and says a prayer under his breath, but tries to hide even that.

"This is - this is the idol - the idol from the main apse in the rear of the Grand Temple of Adirohit! Or - or at least it looks like one in a book I read..."

Oswen says, "How old are you?"

A flash of anger. Then, "Me? How old do you think I am?!"

Oswen says - well he looks maybe a human in the early 50s - so Oswen says, "I don't know, about 112 years plus maybe, 50 at most."

"...Why would you say that?"

"Because you've seen this before."

"..." - he sighs - "...I *have* seen this before... I was..." - he pauses more - "You were given this for good reason, and I really shouldn't even be touching it or handling it. I am an exile. You say you met" (and uses the word Dukha used, for 'were-tiger') "and that's not the first one you met! I was exiled because of my affliction. I was a high-ranking priest of Manivarsha and it defines me. Manivarsha defines me. And yet at the same time, it rejects me. You see, I seek to serve Manivarsha. I take its name. Everything I do, I do for this lost city that has returned. And yet I can never overtly belong to it. I can only ever work from the shadows. Adirohit is *very* temperamental! The mightiest of the Riverines without question, but I was exiled before the fall of the city. It has been a scar on my soul ever since. Yes... I guess you are wondering how I have retained my youth? It is part of this condition. I age much slower than the rest of my brethren. I was a young and very promising priest when I was banished."

Oswen says, "Well, you may never be able to tell people that it was thanks to you telling us about the evil on the plane, that you set in motion the things which freed Adirohit. Without you doing that she'd still be trapped. And for what little it's worth, Dukha told us that to pay him back for his help, if we ever found a cure for this affliction, we would tell him. And of course, we will tell you too."

The Manivarshan chuckles. "Ah, he is young, I take it! He still lives in hope that there is a cure. There *is* one, but it is not worth having! Isn't that the irony of it? Those of us afflicted but wishing for a cure, believe ourselves to be pure of heart - to be 'good', creatures with radiant souls; that is why we wish for a cure. **Yet the cure exists within the lifeblood taken against its will of sacred creatures like unicorns. That is what cures the affliction. It cannot be given willingly; it must be taken by force.** And of course if one were to do that... You could have corrupted your soul. And then, is it worthy of being saved? That is why this is a curse - a curse for us to know that we must remain this way, if we are to remain true to who we are."

Inafina says, "It is in many ways only a curse because of the way you are treated by other people?"

"No, not only that. When we succumb to this other side of our natures, it amplifies that which most people have - we become a danger to those around us - because our instincts can be... Well, we are given weapons for our instincts to flow through. That's not to say that humans can't be as dangerous if they act upon those instincts, but we are less in control of that, when the moon calls to us in the night."

He can't take the statue. "It would not be right for me. Not as exile. It brings me solace and comfort to know that she is free. Maybe one day she could change her mind and I might be welcomed back. It would be nice to walk the streets of old Manivarsha."

He's wistful and reminiscent.

"We have to leave... I don't know if we'll be back. But you'll never be an exile to us."

"I wish you guidance and protection on your journey through peril. I hope you're wrong..."

"About what?"

"...I would most certainly like to see you again! Because then I know that everything is fine."

Oswen stands. "Fingers crossed then. Until next time..." - and we head away.

Kindle is quiet. Bel sidles up next to Oswen. "Well... Wow... What do you make of that?!" "We're not selling it!" "What if we left it in the keep? They could call upon it if they needed help." "Yes! Yes, a good idea. Let's do that."

Oswen had written down the coordinates and we find a quiet place to study them. Arcana only 21. Coordinates for... Hmm. A teleportation spell. Lots of numbers, which should convert into runes and would produce a circle. "I think I have it figured out... But let's see if we can find Karem to say goodbye first!"

We head all the way back down to the inn. We ask the hostel mistress but "the two love birds" left yesterday. "Not sure where they went!" "Off on adventures I guess." "He's very lovestruck, that one!" "It's his first time." To try and protect the innkeeper - Oswen says, "If Karem comes back and asks, we're headed for the Outlands" - we probably aren't, actually, but if anyone bad is following us and asks the Innkeeper, she'll believe that's our destination.

In a quiet corner, Oswen channels the teleportation sequence via the Amulet while saying, "I hope this works, I sort of expected the Radiant"...

POP!

"...Citadel to be fenced off somehow - oh!" - and we're in a small glen, next to a waterfall. Around us, the circle sequence has been drawn onto a circle of mushrooms. But this *is not* the fey wild. It's the Outlads - we look up - no sun, and while we're a long way from the central spire it's still easy enough to see. Kindle warns us to be careful where we step, to not squash the mushrooms. Bel is confused as the mushrooms surely won't last long; but that is surely the whole point.

So what now? She pops Orvil up. We're on the "nice" (good aligned) side of the disc and there's quite a lot of forest and mountain landscape around us. It's lush, nature driven. "This bit's nice!" exclaims Oswen. After spending a good 10 minutes circling, Orvil finds no buildings; it's just glens, moss hills, waterfalls, streams and rivers, trees... Oswen tries to look behind the waterfall. There's an alcove behind and she goes behind to check the wall to see if any is illusory; investigation 18; a *mouth* in the stone! Then small eyes open. If it was a head, the head would tilt. It waits. Oswen calls the others and then says the "password". A portal opens and we step through.

It's a grand entranceway. "Of course, his mansion" says Oswen, sounding unimpressed! Butlers - well invisible servants, but in butler clothing, approach with towels. We dry off. A small bell is rung and a familiar voice calls - "I'll be right down! Hold on!"

Mordenkainen appears on a small flying carpet and floats down to us. He is accompanied by a cat. Orvil's eyes narrow. The cat's eyes narrow. The cat's tail lashes from side to side.

"Ah! Yes! Ah! Well - sorry about the water!"

"I don't mean to criticise, I mean - I don't think I have better ideas - but really, a portal behind waterfall? It's a bit obvious isn't it?"

"But it has a password! And the waterfall means that even if someone was listening in, they couldn't hear it!"

He's quite proud of the spell and offers to let her copy the incantation, but it's beyond Oswen's abilities (L7)... For the moment. Mordenkainen is quite fussy, nobody else is here yet; he asks a Servant to take us to the "Bell Tower" and tells us to meet him in the Grand Hall when we're done.

Oswen suddenly looks distant, then becomes "present" again. She becomes quite stern. "Why do you never tell us what we're truly up against?!"

"What?"

"We ended up confronting a creature *wearing the eye!*"

"To be fair I'm not the one who sent y-"

"*It was the Royal "we"!*"

"Look I know it seems like we are this well-organi-"

(All four of us look incredulous, loudly)

"We're just free agents! We're merely aligned in our desire to stop him. We can - we can talk some more in the Hall - I'll get some drinks - it'll help - I'll listen, I promise!"

So we are led to the Bell Tower. it's a long way, and the magic carpet has been offered, but we'd overload it. It's above the third floor in a luxurious room with four very big beds, wardrobes and more. We spend a while freshening up.

Inafina says, "It's curious, it isn't really the strange locations and new people that are hard to deal with - it's things like this, the crazy contrasts, that I find the hardest."

"I know! He made this. Why couldn't he make it with more than one bathroom?!" asks Bel.

"Well, one day I'll be able to learn this... I'll try to do better. But maybe it's just the way the spell works!"

"Hmm. But what's out there?" he says, and draws back a curtain. Swirling mist. "Where *are* we?"

"We could always go outside and look!"

The windows don't open. "I don't think we're - anywhere. Just a strange magical world of its own."

Meanwhile, Kindle and Inafina are having a heart-to-heart. He doesn't want to ask anything, because "we have a mission", and thinks that Yondalla must also have a place where she could be *met*, like others have now met their gods. She's never called him to meet her, and he doesn't know if he should try - he wants to, but doesn't know if he should.

Eventually, we get down to the Great Hall. He's sat in front of a table with a *huge* amount of food. "But if we eat this is it real? If we leave what happens?!" - apparently we can't take the food out, but we can eat it here and it's as real as any other food we might eat.

We're just about to start on the food and our story when a bell rings - someone else is here. The same sort of greetings. It's Otto.

We catch up. He's sure that the next place to be invaded will be Eberron. He'll be headed there soon; he was just about to head off. We're just about to start our story when the bell rings again.

This time - "Mordenkainen! What's the meaning of this! Why did you put it behind a waterfall, you dolt?!" - it's Bigby; he's drenched. Bel helps him dry out with prestidigitation.

Bigby is full of questions and we head to the grand hall, and we're just about to start on our story - we pause - no bell! - and so we tell the story. **(And through that we learn that there may be a way to find Vajra, assuming she's on the Outlands, to try and find out more about the Hand).**

The TL;DR at this point is that we do need to verify that the Eye is the real deal. We have to take it out of Oswen's bag of holding. We go to a room and Bigby sets up various wards. "If you're going to take it out, stand outside the circle; but take it out inside the circle."

Well, this could be rough. Kindle casts Protection From Good & Evil.

Oswen has no Mage Hand cantrip, so wraps cloth thickly around her hand, reaches into the bag *and withdraws the Eye*. The effect is immediate - but *only* for Oswen, thanks to the Circle.

WIS save:

* ADV -> nat 20 -> 25 total. She's ready for it! A voice in her head, straight away, that seems to *know* her. But it gets strange things wrong - promising her revenge, but she's never been interested in such a thing. A righteous place against people who teased and tormented her, but she never had that bad fortune.

Mordenkainen starts casting Identify. Otto is casting something else too, via song. Oswen is distantly aware of her party members talking to her, trying to support her and even distract her from whatever this artefact is "saying". Then Mordenkainen says, "OK, you can put it back!" and she drops it into the bag.

And silence. The voice in her head had been getting VERY loud. She exhales in relief.

Otto had cast Detect Curse, attempting to find a disguise of any kind; he found nothing. Mordenkainen found via Identify that this was, indeed, the Eye. "And it's a lot more vicious than I thought it would be! It's actively trying to attach itself to someone... Something is going on... It's not dormant! Most tales of it tell how it plays the long game; it corrupts insidiously. But not now. It's not even pretending; it just wants to take control of someone."

Oswen says, "Until we need it, then, it must stay in this bag. I can't be sure that I or anyone else might resist it next time."

Mordenkainen is concerned because it's much more powerful than he thought it would be. And he asks us to talk *again* about everything we experienced with the bearer of the Eye was.

We do the best we can. All of have other stories. Inafina is able to describe the disintegration ray, for example. Mordenkainen hums and hahs. Eventually Otto asks him what he's not saying! Mordenkainen confesses that if the Eye and Hand are this powerful then, together, they would be *very* powerful - and on the *same creature*. Yet this creature must be slain and slain with the Sword Of Kas no less, to get rid of all three. And *that's* a long shot.

Mordenkainen figures that the Eye needs to be brought to the attention of Arkhan so that the two can be reunited. But we need to know where the sword is *first*, then, else Arkhan would be crazy-powerful and running around unchecked until we found it.

We have no lead on that yet.

Afternoon turns to evening. No sign of Alustriel or Zorhanna (who may well still be on Athas). We have dinner and evening turns to night which turns to midnight. We're a bit worried but figure we might as well go to bed.



## Campaign Day 39

In the early hours of the morning, we awake with a start. Doors slamming. Cries of "Oh my god! help! Someone! We need a healer!" - Oswen shakes Kindle fully awake and he runs out. We tumble down the stairs in a great hurry. In the entranceway we see someone who looks like Alustriel, but covered in blood, clutching herself, fallen on the ground at the entrance with a pool of blood next to her!

Inafina gets there first. In frustration she looks back over her shoulder - "We have *got* to buy some healing potions!" - Bel reaches her next, just ahead of Kindle and Oswen, with others in the mansion converging quickly too. Bel casts Healing Word, but nothing seems to happen. Whatever has hit her, it's life-draining - necrotic - and Oswen sees Bel's magic struggling and tries Remove Curse without even checking first, for speed, but even that doesn't work. Alustriel is clutching a small wooden box, she notices. At that moment, Kindle casts Restoration; Alustriel is on the verge of losing consciousness, but before she does, she says - "**I've been followed! It's too dangerous to leave!**" - pushing the box out; Oswen grabs it before Alustriel collapses.

Oswen looks to Kindle; "Did it work?"

"I think so... But she just needs rest now." He uses Channel Divinity to try and infuse more life into her too.

Oswen looks to the others - "Let's get her cleaned up and into bed. This box will wake to the morning." Kindle and Inafina work together, with the invisible servants helping too. "Is there anywhere downstairs?" - Mordenkainen quickly clears a room and we can put her onto a sofa. We try to make her comfortable.

Everyone else is full of questions... Otto wants to know what's in the box, and insists. Mordenkainen is also distraught since he doesn't think the amulet would enable us to get out of the plane, and apparently we can't leave; "even if they don't know the password, we can't get out. What's followed her here?"

Kindle carefully checks over Alustriel's wounds. Medicine 22. "These are definitely magical wounds. The blood... It's coming from these puncture wounds. She's been attacked by a vampire. She managed to get away somehow! No wonder she's feeling so weak. We'll have to nurse her back to health. The Restoration spell will have helped lift *some* of it but she'll need a full rest before she can start to heal."

Oswen confronts Otto; "This box is important, but we don't know if the contents are dangerous - since we're not going anywhere until she's up, why don't we wait, so she can tell us what it is?" "But what if there's anyone *else* out there trying to get back?" We realise Vi can't, the two on Oerth have to stay and Zorhanna's on Athas. So in theory - nobody will be.

Then Biby says, "What about Tasha?"

Yikes. Good point. "We don't know if she was told... Well, I can try Sending..." says Oswen and tries it; "If Alustriel told you of a safe space, do not come. Vampire attack. We are stuck inside. Alustriel injured but will be OK". ARC 21. The spell works; "What?! Is Alustriel injured? She mentioned nothing. Vampires?! Where? I can help! Oh wait. You said not to come. Do I wait?" Oswen has to burn another L3! ARC 19. "Sorry to worry you. We needed to make sure you were safe. Stay where you are. I will be in touch." "OK... Surprising... I would have thought Alustriel more than able to handle herself against a vampire. Speedy recovery! 

We all already knew that if something bettered Alustriel - *almost* - then we'd best not rush out into the fray. We'll wait.

We decide to take turns being on watch, but we need to rest up as well. Bigby heads to the door and places guards and wards up, so we have some warning. Mordenkainen takes first watch. There are seven of us! One hour each. OK.

Kindle, Bel and Oswen all cast spells! So we need to get to bed... That leaves Inafina, Otto, Bigby and Mordenkainen. We figure it out in the end.

Nothing much else happens. On Oswen's watch (in the main hall next to the room where Alustriel rests) she can hear Alustriel - Perception 15 - murmuring. She appears to be asleep and dreaming, even though elves don't normally sleep.

On Inafina's watch - she takes the last 2 hours in the end - ADV (hearing) perception 20,22->20. She can hear that Alustriel is murmuring a name, over and over; **The Betrayer**. That rings a bell, ah, yes! **Kas**. Did she encounter Kas, or something that used to be Kas? Inafina doesn't even know if that's possible. Or perhaps Alustriel knows where the sword is.

Towards the end, Alustriel wakes up - and screams! That wakes up the house. It's late morning, though, and we've all just about rested.

Inafina tries to reassure her. But she interrupts. "**Kas. Kas! He lives! But it's worse than that. Oh no! Does he have the box?**" "Oswen has the box! We haven't opened it." "That's good! But - I'm sorry - can you get me some water?" "Let's go into the dining hall." Alustriel stands but is very weak and leans on Inafina. She asks, "Did I come in with anything? My bag?" "No, I'm sorry, you had nothing but the box." "Oh. Oh dear. Can I have a potion?" "Of?" "Healing..." (Facepalm). Inafina shouts, "KINDLE!"

Later we're gathered in the dining hall, water and breakfast. Alustriel is there. "There was an ambush. How do they know?"

"They must... They must have either been scrying when the coordinates were sent, and the message was actually spoken; or actually intercept the spells?"

"Well they traced me, somehow. I was attacked and teleported away, they shouldn't have been able to follow me, but they did!"

Oswen immediately starts on the ritual to cass Detect Magic. Has something been planted on Alustriel? She doesn't have her bag. But anyway, it's worth a thought. Of course, it's VERY magical in here as Oswen has to actually shade her eyes. On Alustriel herself - hear earrings, staff, robes and of course the box. Oswen carefully examines the Schools for each, checking with Alustriel to make sure they all sound about right. It all seems fine. A ring, necklace; same. The box? Now *that* is puzzling. Many overlapping, interlocked kinds. It's *definitely* trapped. A series of traps, in fact, she thinks.

"Perhaps this itself has a strong enough signature to track?"

Alustriel explains she was attacked, fled and got away, cast Teleport to come here, paused momentarily in the ring to catch her breath and they appeared in the ring next to her.

"Well that's different - perhaps they *saw* and somehoe copied your teleport, but -" and Oswen's sentence is finished by Alustriel and they speak in concert - "**that shouldn't be possible**." Alustriel continues, "I'm sure it's Kas, but they were disguised A magic I couldn't see through. I was completely fooled!"

"Well this... Changes things."

"Did I say something to her?"

"Tasha. **Kas was disguised as Tasha!** I didn't realise it wasn't Tasha. But I thought Tasha would be at the cottage."

"Did you tell her about this meeting?"

"I did. I must have? I was going to bring her here."

"Maybe that's all it was."

"But I can't have told them the *sequence*. I can't have told her that. Why would I do that? I'd have just brought her with me. Did I bring her with me?"

Oswen says, "Whatever is going on, you're confused and it might be magical or it might just be because of the attack. I *could* use Detect Thoughts, but obviously you have a lot of private things I shouldn't know."

"I don't think it'd help anyway. It's not like I have a memory block."

We talk more. We know that Sending isn't "fooled" - the Tasha to whom Oswen spoke knew nothing of the conversation Alustriel had. She can normally pick up on invisibility and disguises, even magical; but Alustriel was not minded to cast True Sight. We *think* that would work.

Alustriel talks of allies with a walking castle and a tower (!). Huh?! "What are *they* doing?" "I'm not sure; they seem a bit lost; but they're from Toril." "Well - if we need more manpower, then we should group up I suppose." "Yes. That's what I was thinking. Yeah. Tasha and I visited them to try and gauge their abilities, so to speak. I'm afraid that - well, apparently they're the only survivors of that tower. The custodians. From Candlekeep, actually. I had a look in their library but it doesn't have that much important stuff. There's a whole collection of - well - to put it bluntly - goblin porn!" (!!) "And some other random things. Anyway... A dragonborn, a sage or scholar. Said that the tower wasn't theirs, but the people the tower belonged to had been killed or something. But Tasha thought they could be useful."

"It's always good to have other friends and other boltholes - especially one that can move."

Alustriel continues, "I suspect they were the people my sister talked about. I saw a painting in the tower of - well themselves. Leirol mentioned there were these four people who had inadvertently fallen into this role, adventuring - anyway - umm - the box. Do you think it's the box?"

"No way to know, but insofar as we're surrounded by very bright magic, that box is at least equally bright and very, very complicated, and very, very trapped."

"Yes I know! I learned that the hard way!"

Bigby interjects, apparently impatience. "But you're making no sense. How does this all hold together? Tasha, a walking tower, a box. Start at the beginning!"

Alustriel holds her head in her hands. "Where's my spell book?" she mutters. Then she tries to tell a more coherent story.

* Alustriel went to find Tasha, but the person she found wasn't Tasha.
* The box contains the **location of Kas's sword** but is very heavily trapped.
* OK, OK, so starting at the start...!
* She'd found the box and was heading back to her cottage having just figured out how to open it, with help, but she was tired. The dragonborn in that walking tower had helped. She actually did get some of the traps open - but also triggered some, so she wasn't at her best! She thought she knew now how to go through all the layers.
* She was going to bring Tasha here to show us. We need the location, because "you have the eye, don't you?"
* She left the walking tower thing, heading for the cottage but was met by false-Tasha outside the cottage. Alustriel told her they must go. Tasha asked about the box, but Alustriel told her we can't open it yet and Tasha tried arguing, then tried to take it. At that, Alustriel knew something was wrong.
* Alustriel repeated that they needed to go - but then there's a blank period, no memory. "When I regained control of myself", Kas was at her throat - literally. **So Kas is a vampire**.
* She got away. But how did he know about the box?
* They fought a while then she got far away enough to teleport. But he was right behind her. He grabbed her, she lost consciousness for a while, but managed to claw herself away. She's lost all her things, but at least she still has the box.

Then Alustriel checks the box. Is it the right one?! But it seems to be. It wasn't that hard to find; she bargained and tricked a devil for it. Oof. "Perhaps" says Oswen, "The box was bait." "What do you mean?" "Well, it can't be a secret to someone as powerful as Vecna that we're still around and causing trouble. Especially after we got the Eye." "But Vecna wouldn't be worried about the Sword of Kas or the Eye or..." "Really?" "You think he knows what we're up to?" "I just sort of always assumed he did." "But we'e been so careful! We've never talked about this outside of the Eight."

Oswen pauses. "Paranoia would be easy at this point - turn upon each other, get suspicious. Obviously that'd be great for Vecna!" - others are already denying things.

The TL;DR is that Alustriel didn't consider that Kas might be alive (undead) - Otto did say so, but still! - and *watching the box*. Alustriel took it and that was to Kas's good luck; *one of the traps requires sacrifice of life force* and an undead vampire Kas has no such thing. Alustriel already did that, which is part of why she was weaker. And so, Kas struck.

So how do we escape? We've rested. He's rested, and probably has reinforcements. With Vecna on the rise, Kas *really* wants that sword! We debate magic mechanics. And in *theory* the amulet of the planes ought to work from in here. "But what if he *is* tracking us using the box?" asks Alustriel. "He might just be able to find us again, and just as quickly."

There are about 5 hours left on the Mansion. "Well, you said you knew how to open it" says Oswen. "So if it takes less than 5 hours, let's open it. Take the contents, squirrel them away - and lock the box again if we can. Then, at risk, try to jump away with the amulet. Worst case, we turn into a red stain on the wall. Best case, we're gone. Kas sees a mansion disappear, the box is ejected, he has no idea how we got away but is distracted, even if only for a moment, by the closed box. Maybe he'll quickly know it's empty but it'll take a few seconds at least. And we're gone, jumped inter-planar to somewhere. He can't possibly know where. It'd be infuriating! Imagine the look no his face...!"

"Everyone had better get back" says Alustriel. "There's one last step".

Everyone steps back except Oswen! She's right there, fascinated, watching closely. Alustriel pushes in levers on the side of the box, very trope-y, lots of clicks and latch sounds! Detect Magic, fast-cast. Six traps. Six layers, peeled back previously. One last layer. Abjuration. ARC 21... The last layer is a cage. Alustriel looks at Oswen as she breaks that last rune. A force cage appears around them both. A cube of force, enclosing them. Oswen says, "Cosy!" - everyone else is aghast, as they're now behind this barrier. Inside, the two of us "feel" screeching voices come forth from the box as it opens. An intense rush of air from the centre of it. **The cube starts to fill with a malevolent presence...** A spirit. Then another. And another! Three were trapped. The cube of force is starting to shrink! There's not much room to move around...

Alustriel, hands still on the box, starts to cast a spell to try and Banish these spirits. Only one are banished. Oswen hasn't had time to act as the first spectre looks at Oswen and rakes at her, but misses; she always casts Mage Armour in the morning. But the second does the same and hits her for 7 necrotic. CON save only 10, her max HP drops by that amount.

Oswen follows suit! L5 Banishment to target 2 entities, DC18. There's one of them left still. Oswen says, "Try again!" to Alustriel. "I can't!" Oh. Yes. Concentration. And Oswen can't do that either. "I need my spellbook!" says Alustriel. Instead, 8 magic missiles head to the remaining spirit. And it's a high set of hits, 30 damage. She says to Oswen, "you can use missiles!" but now it attacks Alustriel in turn, hitting for 9 necrotic and also reducing her max HP. Fortunately though she holds Banishment. Oswen, ARC 28. This an incorporeal creature. Immune to cold. Radiant could work. Resistant to necrotic. Immune or resistant to *anything*! She tries Chromatic Orb. L6! Her only one of the day. Almost impossibly, the 8d8 is only 24 out of potential 64, halving to only 12. She says, "Well I can't help it if I have performance anxiety! I mean who even keeps Magic Missile on tap anyway?!" "It's *very useful*!" - and that works. Just enough. It was only 15 away.

"Right" says Alustriel, "We just need to hold the spell". And now we wait. A minute passes. And we're done. The cage, too, is dispelled. Otto had tried Dispel Magic, in the mean time, but it didn't work. But Mordenkainen and runs off, to everyone's surprise and came back with a scroll; a sickly green Disintegrate spell was cast and *that* destroyed it.

Aaaanyway. As we all quickly debrief, a bemused Alustriel is stood there, still holding the two latches on the box. "Would someone PLEASE take that paper out of the box?!"

Oswen looks inside. In the middle of this complex mechanism is a small piece of folded parchment. The box is large compared to the tiny space inside. Alustriel lets go with relief.

Oswen can't read the parchment directly. It's *related* to Common... INV 21. (She later finds out it's the language of Oerth, and cryptically phrased). The short version? The blade of Kas, the Puppetmaster, the downfall of his master Vecna, is in a Domain Of Dread - Shadowfell somewhere - in Kas's prison and is in - and this she does *not* understand - "**the only place that one can be free**". It seems, hidden in plane sight.

We don't know why Kas didn't see the sword. But if we're right, oh, the irony! Kas escaped from prison and inadvertently distanced himself from the very thing he was escaping to try and find.

So if we leave, the box - if we leave it behind - would be ejected from the mansion once that closed. We'd love to see the expression Kas's face... Oswen doesn't have Scrying "dialled in" but Mordenkainen has something. No time like the present! We double check we have everything we need. Where in the Outlands though. Nobody is sure where to go; Trade Gate is shut down, too populous if Kas follows. Oswen has an idea. We link hands - and she activates the amulet. Very much with crossed fingers.

### Outlands, near the imprisoned Illithid

ARC 32! We arrive in a fairly desolate space. A river is nearby. A strange archway of stones floats above the river. We're there. It worked. Weapons are drawn. A brief moment... No Kas.

"Mordenkainen - what you do you see?"

"The mansion stays up for another 5 hours!"

"See if Kas is still outside."

He casts. "What does Kas look like?!" he asks. Alustriel asks what he sees. "The waterfall; shall I look behind?" "Yes, if there's nobody behind!" "No. Nobody behind. Could he be invisible?" "Well... I suppose yes? He might even look like plant I suppose!" then MK's face drops. Kindle asks, "What? What?!" MK answers, "Oh. Hmm. Alustriel... What does your spellbook look like?" Alustriel, with a heavy heart, describes it. MK says, "Tell me you have a backup?!" "Why?" "Well... I see the cover and the spine of your spellbook. But everything else is in a pile of ash. I think he burned it. I'm - I'm sorry."

Alustriel is aghast. Frankly, so is Oswen.

"But - but it's magical. It's not easy to - it would take a lot to - are you sure?!"

He's sure.

She spends a moment, processing. She's at a loss. Oswen thinks fast. And says, "Of everyone here, maybe I understand most" and she produces her old spellbook, the pre-copy, just parchment; says, "Start again. You know a lot. You're resourceful. This is a beginning."

Alustriel is sheepish in accepting it.

Oswen says, "I know it's not the same, it's not a replacement, it's a horrible thing to happen. But at least you're not at nothin -" - but Oswen is interrupted at Alustriel pulls her into a hug. "I *HATE* being locked out of Sigil!" she claims, exasperated.

MK thinks Kas got annoyed, impatient, burned all the stuff and left. He might come back, but he has *not* followed us here. He's not convincing enough to fool a Sending spell, probably not powerful enough to break True Sight and definitely not omnipotent.

Meanwhile MK and Bigby are offering spells but Alustriel says they don't have time.

Then we remember *why* we were all going to meet! The Eye, Hand, sword... We need privacy. MK lights up! We've been to bed! He takes a miniature door out of his pocket. Precious metal. Beautifully enamelled, trimmed in gold. "Lucky you had that in your pocket when we had to abandon Sigil..." says Oswen. "Ah, well, I have a few caches! You should make one. Very useful."

A minute later, the door grows to full size. He's got it floating just in space this time. "But it will only allow us in! Nobody else."

Inside, it's different. Bel asked for more bathrooms, for a start, and he's gone for "oriental palace" style. It's all on the same level, lots of sliding doors. He leads us to a beautiful courtyard, with pretty maple trees and a small fish pond, under a strange, swirling, dark blue sky. Not bad!

We end up retelling our story for Alustriel. Oswen confesses that she *was* angry at not being told more, but then says we'd have, in fact, still done what we could - all we can do really, given our comparative inexperience and ignorance - just do "what seems right".

Otto says, "You have something that we have either forgotten, or perhaps lost somewhere along the way. An unshakable bravery! Not foolhardiness or ignorance. It is bravery. To do the thing that must be done. I'm not sure that many others would have done the same. I think we're very lucky that you happened to be in Alustriel's tower in the sanctum that day. I think you were meant to be there. It was meant to be you."

"It all started with a frightened demigod in the Far Realm really..."

"...But there must be a reason why it contacted *you*. Speaking of which, where is Zorhanna?!"

"In Athas, as we all agreed!"

"But it's been several days, have you heard anything?"

"We don't know how long it's going to take her."

"Shouldn't she have reported back by now?"

Alustriel shrugs. "Perhaps. But she can't really communicate with us until she gets back. Tasha's method - well, Tasha's working on another method but I don't think even *that* would give us a conduit to communicate."

We get to Arkhan; and that leads to Vajra; who is probably in the Outlands. And then there's that wider question of getting Arkhan the eye *and* taking him down.

Otto knows of a gate for the Shadowfell. He's been before. Oswen, HIS 23, remembers readings about the Dark Powers, domains, the mists between them, finding your own way out. She also has her doubts that her amulet would work there because it's a prison so it can't be *that* simple. Otto tells her something she hasn't read about - Gloom - a forgotten border town in the Outlands. "It's an unofficial border town! It's not part of the Outlands, not officially. Within Gloom lies the door to Shadow. I don't know how to open it. But it can be opened. That's not how *I* got there. I went the old fashioned way!" "I don't want to know!" retorts Oswen.

They all look at us.

Oswen says, "We're ill prepared for the Shadowfell. But you know Vajra, and there are four of us - kind of disposable, let's be honest - who have a chance. So I suggest we four, 'under the radar' of Kas and Vecna, *perhaps* - go to Gloom. And you all work on the bigger plan and Vajra."

But what of the Eye? MK asks if we trust him. He offers to hide the Eye. After quite some thought, Oswen agrees. MK digs around in his bag and pulls out a tiny gold-trimmed box chest. "Are you ready to transfer it?" "It won't fit in that!" says Bel. MK casts a spell and the the tiny chest is replaced by a large chest. "A spell from an old apprentice of mine, Leomind!" Oswen says "Bel, I might need your help on this..." - and she wraps some cloth over her hand again and says, "Well, here goes nothing..." - but Kindle stops her and offers instead. A bit more resilient. Bardic inspiration. 21 total, with Bardic. Enough. He resists the pull and hastily throws the eye into the chest! MK slams it shut, utters words of the spell and the chest shrinks again.

"Well, then, off to 'Gloom' for us! As for the rest of you - I suppose it's best we don't know. Can you get there from here?"

Everyone else is confident in teleport abilities.

Alustriel will find Vajra, to get a lead on Arkhan. Otto wants to talk to Tasha to see if there are any ways to help Zorhanna. And MK is basically on the run with his chest! Bigby says he will *try to rally the dragons* (!) - "Surely they must have an interest in what's going on." And he thinks he'll start *here* in the Outlands. "I will find out the best way to get in touch with Bahamut. If Tiamat is on the move, we're going to need him to keep her in check. We can't have *another* crazed god on our hands! One is enough."

Oswen's not *too* confident about amulet-shifting directly to Gloom. All she really knows is the name. Alustriel then gets shifty. "If you're going to Gloom..." "Out with it!" says Oswen. "I don't have my spell book. I don't have Planeshift remembered right now... I don't suppose you could let me copy the Planeshift spell from your book?" "But I don't *have* the Planeshift spell! It's the amulet." "What about a temporary trade?" "What about a temporary trade? If you lent me the amulet so I can get around. I have my staff... If it doesn't work to get in and out of the Shadowfell it might be of limited use to you anyway and" - and she keeps talking, but eventually Oswen holds up a hand and says, "I get it. I don't like it. But I get it."

Oswen takes off the amulet. "We've perhaps never seen entirely eye to eye, you and I. But we know our respective hearts are in the right place. This amulet is... Addictive, in its way. And it carries danger - a chance of failure. If you have anyone to inspire you" - she looks to Bel - "then I recommend always using that inspiration beforehand."

Alustriel insists on a trade with her staff. "Hopefully you will find that useful where you are going. Until we meet again. Take care."

"You too. Try to avoid vampires...!"

Otto will help us get to Gloom. We say our goodbyes after an hour over tea attuning to our new toys. Alustriel curiously seems a bit more self-assured and confident. Sharper, less uncertain. Less defeated. Inafina notices. She whispers to Alustriel, without the others noticing, "It's all going to be OK. We'll defeat him, one way or another."

Outside the Mansion, Otto spends a moment to cast Teleport (with no destination circle available). As the spell kicks in, there's a curious sound as if lots of overlapping wind chimes were sounding, then lights dim, as if a curtain in a play falls, then...

### Gloom, Outlands

...lifts. Our vision returns; we see we are stood on a road; cloudy, a bit chilly, a few scraggy trees. It seems like a late autumn or early winter here. A low town is visible a short distance along a road, with a small squareish keep on a rise set against a hill.

"You're headed that way!" says Otto. "I have no business in Gloom. But you need to find a key, to get you into **Tovag**. When you find out what that key is - there may be more than one - hold onto it, because that's your way in *and out*. Do not lose it or you'll be stuck! You'll still need to find the *door* once in, of course." (And anyone in that prison domain who learns we have such a thing will doubtless want to take it from us, in order to escape themselves). "And a Domain of Dread without its Dark Lord tends to decay and crumble, so be prepared for it to be unstable if Kes really has escaped. Stay together and keep your wits about you."

"Where are you headed?"

"I need to find a way to warn people on some candidates - of planes - that we have; I feel like we know where he's headed next, there's a lot of turmoil on a particular plane; I have my suspicions. I think he might be targeting it next. With Tiamat mobilising, I think that it's all related. And that narrows things down. I certainly *don't* think it's Athas - more likely, it's **Krynn** - but that's OK, because we're hedging our bets!"

There are apparently reports of a dragon army rising in Krynn and a long-dormant dragon queen (a different dragon, or just another name for Tiamat herself, *perhaps* if two different dragons they're working together) now awoken and making trouble.

We part company. Otto summonings a spectral horse and gallops off; we start the short walk into town.

(End of Part 2.15)
