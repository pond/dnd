# Oswen: Part 2.12
## Campaign day 30
### Trade Gate, afternoon

We have been investigating what we can about Arkhan The Cruel's location as he holds the Hand Of Vecna. We've no leads on the Eye yet. Soon, we're to meet at Mordenkainen's hotel where a group of us will teleport to our Fey Keep for a catchup covering all known current information.

It's time; we make our way to the location Mordenkainen indicated. He welcomes us to the room, and then only a few actually arrive:

* Vi is busy on Toril
* Jallarzi and Otiluke are busy on Oerth
* Bigby and Otto both show
* Zorhanna and Alustriel too

So 5 of the 8, including Mordenkainen. And us, for what that's worth!

People arrive slowly, so polite conversation is made. Zorhanna is last, having travelled 'conventionally'. While waiting, Oswen checks in with Alustriel, not wanting to over-step, but aware of how distressed Alustriel had been about her sister and so-on after Toril fell. She says she's been so busy, she hasn't had much time to think about it.

Once Zorhanna arrives, Alustriel voices concern about meeting in the open. It seems a risk. Yet Mordenkainent's view is that it's a security measure, as it just looks like a visit to Trade Gate. Either way, we should get going! With only 9 people here, Oswen can bring all with the amulet and with everyone agreeing...

...pop!

"You have to tell me where you found that some day, and if there are any more!" says Zorhanna, in Mordenkainen's direction. We're in the courtyard. Wait. "I didn't know we had a courtyard?!" to Bel. "Oh. No. That's weird. Are we in the right place?" The keep looms above and a head pops out above a balcony. "I'll be right down!" - it's Froderick, clearly identifiable by his black and white stripy face.

He reminds Oswen to please let him know in advance if we can. "Goodness, I'm so sorry - we actually did know in advance this time..." but that said, we never want him to fuss. "I will try much harder next time." Oswen asks about the "rather magnificent courtyard" - and we apparently have a couple of extra floors! But he thought we did it. The cook and others join us, as the group all collect in the dining hall. They say that the changes happened overnight, and they didn't even notice. ARC 20; well, that rapidity and not having even known it was going on - must be Fey magic. But we thought the Keep stabilised after creation - maybe that's just what people say, though; or maybe it takes a while longer to settle than we thought.

Leonidas is out in the fields; Oswen doesn't want to disturb him (and he'd distract her, truthfully, albeit in a good way).

We talk about Vecna; the Wonderhome device; Sigil perhaps intentionally needing to be kept locked away. The Eye and Hand, and the Rod, would help us take Vecna down so that *then* we could open Sigil and restore any planes damaged by Vecna.

Next, Bigby and Vi. Bigby has to limit contact as Vi is not in a safe place. She *is* noticing that some people are aware things are "off", so she can capitalise on that. The plane is still too dangerous to visit as there are many of Vecna's forces still there, but their numbers decrease daily as that plane's takeover "stabilises" which means another plane's takeover is likely imminent.

Mordenkainen and the codex, and the book of planes - well that's crucial. Oswen asks about that, in relation to Athas and the rod segment. He thinks the book *can* give a way to get there once translated. But there is almost nothing known about Athas that's even remotely "recent" and it's far too dangerous to rush in with zero information, so therein, a dilemma. A scouting party has to go - somehow.

Allustriel has found a way to reach an alternate time and reality to locate the "correct" Tasha. "Unfortunately, it is not necessarily the safest time!" - Tasha must be spreading her wings and powerful, but not yet corrupted; not evil; on her journey where she collects information that goes into the Demonomicon. The moment she completes the book, she can't be held back... In the process of completion she becomes obsessed. She crosses people, burns bridges that - well in essence - break her, inside.

"Can we - I mean, isn't there almost a moral imperative? to - " starts Oswen.

"**No**. It would be catastrophic to mess with that timeline. But we need to convince her that she's needed, so that we can split that timeline and preserve it. One copy of her stays there, one copy of her comes here."

"Is - that actually, a copy? A different Tasha?"

Mordenkainen chips in. "You're playing with fire! Why would she agree, knowing what's going to happen to her? The two copies cannot coexist indefinitely. One copy must ultimately be deleted to preserve the other one's integrity."

"These are desperate times. We're not doing anything *to* her. The original timeline is intact. We're not changing that! Our influence there must be very carefully limited to not change the details, to not create ripples. We must extract Tasha at a certain point in time so she can work with us without affecting that timeline."

Bigby and Mordenkainen seem very concerned, others less so.

Oswen asks, "Can her copy here, the one we want to help us, can she be told? Can she be told what's really happening to *her*?"

"We won't get the most out of her if she knows. She can't know. If you were told that you had to be removed, that you had to be erased, when your job was done... How do you think that would affect your performance?"

Oswen now sees another side of Alustriel. But it's a side that's right. Bigby is voicing objections. Mordenkainen is talking about risk. Oswen isn't listening to the words. So she finds herself saying "Let me meet the copy. Met me talk to her."

Alustriel says, "What do you mean?"

"You _will_ bring her through. You _have_ to. We know that. But - let me - can I talk to her? You could. If you want to I won't stop you. But let me tell her why we want her help. Let me ask her for help."

The look Alustriel gives her is strange. A mixture of pain and respect. "...Thank you. That brings me to my next point! We need - I can only send people there and pull them back once.  We only have one chance to get this right. She has to come with the people we send. I'm not volunteering you! Because there are other things we need to do..."

(While others talk, Oswen has reached up and is holding Kindle's hand.)

It seems there are two other planes worth investigating. One is **Eberron**. Zorhanna can't see into it. Otto has a strong suspicion that, given the record of events happening there, that it could be a plane ripe for Vecna's next step. It's already been weakened by a cataclysm of war. The other is **Athas**. There are also signs that Athas is next. Both are weakened - it's 50:50.

Zorhanna has lots of information. Oswen smiles, but her eyes are wet with the start of tears - she feels friendship and even pride as Zorhanna talks, enthusiastically. "We know Oerth has fallen", she is saying. Oswen is thinking, "We have to tell Tasha". There's something about Toril - the gods there have actually been *excluded* from the plane now and everyone else thinks that Vecna is the one and only god, and awalsy was. "How we tell her?" thinks Oswen. Apparently Athas has no gods, just people proclaiming themselves to be? Sounds strange. Oswen's read about Athas and met people from there - Jordun and so-on. In fact it seems Vrakir can pretty much just walk there! Must be the plane of fire as a connection.

Oswen very reluctantly acknowledges that we know what's at stake. She'd sooner meet Tasha. But if there's nobody else - we could go. But we wouldn't survive. We'd need more than a hope and a prayer this time.

Mordenkainen is tasked with checking the book to try and find a way. Oswen has a bit of a revelation based on the conversation she overhears - **every plane is connected to every other** - that is the literal nature of seeing stars in the sky. But if a plane we cut off (from the Astral Sea), that star vanishes. But if it is still connected to even one single plane, then find *that* plane and you can get where you want to go. She'd not realised that her amulet was taking advantage of that interconnectedness.

There is a break. We will meet back in an hour.

We find somewhere private. Kindle has *major* reservations about treating Tasha in that way. Yeah, so does Oswen. Alustriel *needs this to work*. She doesn't have the luxury of telling Tasha what's really going on. But Oswen wants to look Tasha in the eye and make that call. Besides, we have history. We know that Tasha becomes Igwilv, but Igwilv becomes Zybilna. **Inafina points out that Zybilna had tried to atone, had even locked away those bad parts of her personality in the jars in the palace... And Oswen is open-mouthed. "Is *that* what those were?! I never even worked it out!"**

Well, we know what's important, but we know we want to try and meet Tasha. After the hour, everyone meets back up. We *will* do Athas if there's nobody else, but we'd rather help with Tasha. Zorhanna says she's very interested in Athas and she's just one person, easier to hide... Oswen realises she means to go alone. Alarmed, she says, "We have this helm? Or this chime, it opens things... And scrolls..." and starts rifling through them, getting more worked up. Zorhanna puts her hand on Oswen's. "Stop. It'll be fun. I get to do research! Nobody's written about Athas in _decades_. I'll be fine." Perception 15. **Zorhanna's hand is trembling**. Oswen puts her other hand on top. Looks her straight in the eye. Oswen says loudly enough, "I see, you'll be fine! It's good, I'm glad you're confident. If we can help, let us know." She aims to save Zorhanna face there; not let those cracks show.

Mordenkainen has spent the hour reading the book. He thinks it's a three-hop approach. One to the edges of Asheron, not the Plane of Fire, but connected to it and overlapping. It's where the blood war battles happen most frequently. That's the pivot, the access; a way to get to the Plane of Elemental Chaos. That's the only one connected to Athas. Perhaps that's why there are no gods there.

The only other plane is the Shadowfell, but he has no idea how to navigate that.

Otto votes to take Eberron. He and Bigby head off straight away. Mordenkainen spends more time with his book will get back to Trade Gate soon. We'll need to confer with Alustriel but first we try to get some private time with Zorhanna. We find her in the library. She seems to approve! "A lifetime's work of collection." Oswen offers an idea - get Jordun's help. Zorhanna agrees and without delay Oswen tries Sending cross-plane. D20->11, success.

"Friend. Have someone who needs to learn about Athas. With your permission and if you give your location, can we meet you?"

"Oswen?! What a surprise! Happy to help! We have reached the Realm of the Norns by the Halls of the Ancestors. Are you nearby?"

Well, there we are. We can try to get there, then, but a map might help, if Zorhanna has anything? It's a "pocket realm" in the Outlands. A demiplane. So go there directly by name. Oswen is about to go and find Leonidas when Bel reminds her she can just pop to that plane and back! So we tell Alustriel we'll be right back and...

...pop!

The five of us appear on a cold, windswept hillside covered in snow. Mountains all around. "Better enjoy the cold, I hear Athas is on the warm side...!" quips Oswen as Zorhanna turns a ring on her finger which starts to glow and heat emanates from her. We look around. Where are we?! Well, very nearby is a *huge* settlement with a very large great hall. "I like this plane already!" She point. "I bet it's that way!"

We trudge through snow and wind, and it's further than it looked and very cold, and Bel eventually picks up Oswen and hands her to Kindle as Oswen is about half-submerged in the drift! His long legs have no issues. It seems we barely blink and suddenly Bel has a scarf, wooly hat and gloves on. How does he *do* that?! Inafina wind-walks on top. Kindle barges through and Zorhanna seems to be _melting_ her way through!

We get to the great hall. It is *very* impressive. Around, are scattered huts, that look very well constructed. We soon see the inhabitants - half-giants; golaiths too. Ah! Good company. Oswen is in the middle of calling out "Jordu - " when a voice says, "Isn't it amazing? It's so cold! I love it!"

Inside, we introduce Zorhanna and we're introduced to Jordun's "clan" of sorts. Huge ceramic mugs of honey mead are produced!

We explain that Zorhanna has to get to Athas. Once we've got past the incredulity, Jordun starts to recount his story - what it's like there - at least the areas he knows. He didn't even know until he left that "in hindsight civilisation on Athas is very disconnected; it consists of isolated little nations and city states which - well, there are 7 cities, at least that's what people say. I have myself only ever seen two of them." Zorhanna is taking notes and a to-and-fro develops. Jordun describes the "green crescent", a strip of trees and vegetation - which _there_ they call a forest, but now he's seen forests _here_ he wouldn't call it that! He thinks it is, nonetheless, the most verdant plane on Athas.

There are names - the "sea of silt" and the "coastal cities" - but there's no coast, and it's not a sea! People occasionally encounter wrecks of what must've been seafaring vessels, in the *ancient* past. But now there are no seas left; no rivers; the occasional oasis. He's never seen one. They're almost mythical there! He's heard they are heavily guarded by the "sorcerer kings" in private gardens within the cities. Water is just enough to grow food but only the wealthy and city dwellers have access. Other people get by on - very little. Beasts and people prey on each other.

Magic is pretty much non-existent. A modicum of elemental / nature elements, usually only practiced by "the guardians" (of groves), druids; almost mythical too. Elemental priests only. No gods. He's been amazed at the range and belief of gods in the Outlands. Only the Sorcerer Kings are worshipped. A very rigid, authoritarian structure in the cities. The kings are magic users, but defilers - they grow things simply so they can destroy them; absorb life-force, to use magic. There are legends that say wars between these kings is what destroyed the world. But others say the life was all taken by one great defiler. Oswen and Zorhanna exchange looks - wonder who *that* might be?!

Magic use as a result is viewed with extreme suspicion. Arcane magic used openly would attract attention of a Sorcerer King or their templars. *They* believe they control the right to use magic. They can't risk other defilers absorbing life-force in the city. There are some preservers, he thinks, but they are very, very undercover and hide their magic.

And so it goes on. It's an eye-opener. In the end we spend a full hour there. Bel plays music to keep people relaxed. A short rest. Finally, it's time to go and the farewells are predictably somewhat tearful. Oswen CON save - 7 - she stands up and promptly almost falls over. Dizzy! She'd drunk all the mead. Bel asks, "Where did you find room to put all that?! Wow. Well done!"

We walk outside, find a quiet spot to avoid freaking people out - Kindle carrying a rather drunken Oswen - but she's woken up enough to try the amulet - DISADV D20, 11 and 11. The dice gods are on our side. We reappear in the library in a snow flurry, rosy-cheeked our outright drunk and in cold weather gear. And a patter of feet - it's Leonidas!

A merry Oswen and Leonidas catch up.

Sobering up with food and water, we check in; at least Zorhanna can be more prepared. Especially the information about magic. With that in mind, none of the Eight, or us, would be well-suited to go.

So Zorhanna says goodbye and heads off. This leaves us with Alustriel, waiting patiently. Well, now it's time; the matter of Tasha. "The place you have to go to speak to her is... The realm of dreams."

"Oh! Well, there are other reasons as I already mentioned" (the Far Realm great one) "why that might be useful."

But the route is risky. We're moving to another realm *and time*. Ah, so the Far Realm creature won't contact us there as it'll be decades before the Vecna incident started. "I will have the simulacrum ready for when you return. But we can't do it here so I can set that up."

Were it not for our previous experiences, we might not have understood what the simulacrum was for.



### Alustriel's sanctum

Alustriel takes us via some sort of portal to her sanctum. It's a neat little cottage with a meadow outside and a low stone wall. It's in the Outlands. The spire is quite far, so we're a fair distance rimward. Seems like a "safer" plane, not towards the evil-aligned side; but feels a bit chaotic. Feels about right for Oswen! It's quaint, which isn't really what we expected. Homely. Oswen perhaps expected something more... Regal?

"I assume you are - there's nothing else you need? You're not too tired?"

Oswen shrugs. "I guess now is good!"

"Hopefully you're at least a little tired because I need you to fall asleep. Naturally." Alustriel can start work on the simulacrum afterwards.

"Oh. Well, that might take a minute."

She lays down four bedrolls for us. She can then 'cast' the dream spell. Books are all over the place. Calculations, modifications to spells, annotations. We try to relax and see if we can sleep. She starts chanting, too! "This is going to take a while!" - but she hopes the drone of the chant helps us sleep as she casts a ritual. WIS saves.

* Oswen - ADV thanks to drinking; nat 20! 25 total.
* Inafina - 19+3 -> 22, sleeps easily.
* Bel - nat 1, wide awake, wants to ask about the spell! Has to use Inspiration.
* Kindle - waits until everyone else is asleep, then is out like a light.

**...and we wake, individually, in different parts of the dream...**

...Oswen "wakes up"; stands up; looks around. She is alone. There is a thick fog, light grey. It's up to her shoulders - a shallow see, rolling a little. Nothing looks familiar. It's dark; cloudy above. Night time. Enough light from a moon behind the clouds to see the fog, at least. It seems like this might be a sort of field. Here and there, rocks stick out. A couple of trees in the distance, bare, as if it is winter. She figures she might climb one to get a better view. But as she walks, the ground feels strange. She almost stumbles. Rocks, lips and ledges of the ground; she reaches down to feel it - and now it makes sense. This is a graveyard! The rocks poking up are tombstones. She proceeds more cautiously. The tree looks like maybe an old chestnut. ATHL 14-1; it's not easy! But she gets to a lower, big branch, at least. This gives a bit more of a view. There's a gate, which probably marks the edge of the graveyard...

...Inafina "wakes up" in an alleyway. Nobody else around - where are her friends? It's dimly lit. A cloudy night. There's some kind of low mist, close to the ground. But it could be steam from kitchens and drains? Who knows. She can hear activity from nearby, a street at the far end, and she heads that way. There, she sees a lone horse-drawn carriage being slowly driven along. Someone with a pipe leans against a doorway across the road at the entrance to what looks like a tavern with a lit window. The carriage turns left. She sees a gate at the end near where the carriage turned. The noise might be from the tavern, but strangely, she's not sure...

...Oswen climbs down heads for the gate. Ravens caw and flap. They land in a nearby tree, watching. She turns to the ravens and says, "Well you two certainly look the part!" and then with a shock remembers Orvil, who isn't on her shoulder nor in the usual mental contact. "Well, I guess, it's a dream!" - one of the ravens flies away. The other continues to watch, beady-eyed. The gate is closed but unlocked, so she heads out. There's a street. A carriage is coming along towards her. A driver wears a low hat and oilskin coat. As the carriage turns, but the windows are dark - there may be curtains too - so she can't see inside. There's a streetlight away in the distance and she sees a Harengon - she immediately raises and arm to wave.

So we spot each other and meet, and ask each other but we've not seen Kindle or Bel. Inafina mentions that tavern so we decide to check in there. Walking towards the door, the man in the pipe puts his cane out to block the way. He draws on the pipe and gives a big puff of smoke out. "State your business!" "Looking for friends." "Looking for friends?! Friends? Who would you consider a friend?" "Well, Bel, Kindle and Tasha if you know them?!" "Curious. Very curious. I don't know any of those names. Maybe I could be your friend?"

Oswen politely thanks him and doesn't answer, says, "Well, we'll just look inside, if you don't know them maybe we'll spot them..."

"Brave, lass. Hmmm. Very well".

We're allowed inside. How odd! It's dimly lit. A fiddler plays softly. It's not uninviting; it's warm. There's a bar with a single barkeep, filling a drink for someone. People seem - indistinct. Sat in corners, We almost don't notice them. Oswen rationalises that when she dreams sometimes people are just "part of the scene" but she doesn't focus on what most of them look like. Perhaps that's the same here. "Come in!" calls the Barkeep. "We're a little short on hands tonight I'm afraid, so you'll have to come up and order from me." So we go to the bar and order a couple of drinks, and enquire about a rather tall and imposing but friendly bugbear and a rather finely-dressed satyr. "Can't say I've seen any - only bugbear I've seen works in the kitchen! And he's not friendly all. Kind of weird if you ask me... Bit of a scaredy-cat. Doesn't say much. Makes a mean stew, though." "Could we try some?" "Sure".

He opens the door and we get a look in. The bugbear has their back to the door. They turn around - and - it's Kindle but he looks confused and scared. "Ah - all - alright, stew - coming up..." and Oswen says, "Oh my, I think we might have met this bugbear before. Would it be an imposition to have a chat?" "Sure. I've got my hands full here!"

We head into the kitchen. The bugbear looks very frightened. Oswen says, "I heard you make a really good stew." The bugbear now shows a flash of recognition. "Oh! My goodness. Oh my! What's going on?! Why am I here?"

Oswen says, "I'm glad you remember now. Inafina and I appeared in different places and found each other by change, but we remembered everything. It seems you weren't so lucky."

"Well I woke up - maybe?" "You're still asleep!" "I was in this kitchen and knew my job was to be a chef but couldn't remember how to make much things but orders have been piling up..."

Seems it's anxiety - a stress dream. But where's Bel? Inafina checks out the fiddler, but that's not Bel.

Kindle is still very upset about making the orders that are piling up. Well, maybe it matters? He's able to dish up stew because it turns out there's a pot already made. He gradually gains confidence, Oswen helping find things in the kitchen with Inafina serving in the main room as she's very agile. After a while we're all caught up and he takes a break, so we get more time to chat.

Oswen ARC 24. This is Tasha's dream, so she must be in it. But where's Bel. We can either be passengers in this or a character in it. Kindle was being swept into it. Perhaps Bel was too, but in that case, who would he be? Kindle is a chef and that makes sense so perhaps Bel would an entertainer, or courtier, or regal - perhaps he was in that carriage?

The barman thinks that must be heading to the castle. It's a scary place. We opt to go anyway; "Well, keep your wits about you!" he warns. Oswen looks over and realises that Kindle looks like himself again. In his own clothing, as normal. He picks up the bowls to put away, but in the kitchen, we hear a voice thanking him for bringing them. That's the *actual* cook.

Outside, the man is no longer at the door. Inafina listens out for noises other than the tavern. Perception 25. She hears general sounds from the alleyway, so that *wasn't* the tavern. Indistinct, a background din! How strange. It has no apparent origin. She focuses on specific things as best she can; wind blowing, the sound of cawing, nothing much else. She shrugs and says, "I think carriage went that way", pointing; so we head that way, turn where the carriage turned and now see fully the road that, in fact, runs past the graveyard. It's wide, lined with (bare) trees and in the distance, it climbs a little and there's a clearly silhouetted gothic-style, imposing castle - ramparts, towers, asymmetry - stone, dark. "Well it certainly looks the part" says Oswen. We can see there are lit windows and march up along the road. Getting closer we can see there's a large rose window that's illuminated. The trees change to poplars, which still have some leaves. The road, previously dirt, becomes paved and we lift up above the fog. Looking back, we see the "town" is tiny - 2 streets by 2 streets, little more; a hamlet. Of the few buildings, some have smoke rising from chimneys but not all.

The road isn't on a hill, more of a ridge, falling away either side. The trees stop and now we're on a stone bridge. Big drops either side. "I'll say this for Tasha; well, to be frank, she's not very imaginative is she?!" says Oswen. The other two are quiet, unsettled; in truth Oswen's nervous humour is mostly a coping mechanism. The castle is of course on an outcrop of rock with sheer sides. The main gate appears to be closed. Standing guard, in the shadow of a gatehouse, is someone with a big hat and feathers and a pike. On a pure guess, just in case - harmless otherwise - Oswen says, "Bel, is that you?"

"What? What?" a head pops out from the shadow. The pike is held uncomfortably. It *is* Bel! He seems confused. What? Who? What is going? What is - oh dear - what is?! Well we do our best to explain and get him to let us in. He has a ring of keys and Oswen knows that the clothing might not last long as Bel "wakes up more", just as with Kindle. Bel nervously tries different keys, being slow because he's rushing! Eventually though he finds it and we are able to get in. He's put the pike down. Thinking Bel might "swap" with the real guard, we put the chain back but don't lock the padlock - hopefully the real guard won't notice and we can get out in a hurry should we need to.

This all feels a bit like a mixture of Yon and the Palace of Hearts Desire; we're sneaking around inside a courtyard, with a garden and planted hedges, but it's all gone a bit wild. Perhaps it always was. We're looking for some kind of side entrance to slip in quietly - we are after all uninvited! There are many tall, narrow windows. A big entrance is up a set of steps. Further up, the windows are bigger. We find a lit small window down here and peer inside. It's very "castley"! Carpet and tables and banners and flagstones. No movement that we see. But someone's at home! A chandelier is lit, full of candles.

There's a small kind of apse and a door that is just about where you'd expect for a servant's entrance. Bel is unimpressed! But they're usually not locked - and yep! This isn't. The workers don't tend to sleep in the castle either; looks around then points - a barracks, or quarters-style building near stables. Of course. It's all where you'd expect. We creep in.

It's warm inside. There's a soft dancing of a fire and the sound of conversation, light laughter, the sound of a wooden spoon against a bowl. We walk through into a kitchen/dining area where the servants eat and cook. It feels like things are appearing and doing stuff as we progress through. People are busy! They turn to look at us. "Oh..." - and before they can say more, Oswen says, "We're the entertainment!" "What? Well you're *very* late then! And this isn't the right entrance - well, never mind..." - a more matron-y lady approaches, wearing a pinny, a robust lady; not someone with whom to trifle, but seems warm.

We try to bluff about being late due to the fog - deception ADV with Bel's help - 23. Suddenly, we're all in costume, holding instruments! So it's believable; Kindle in particular looks confused. But it's worked, and we ask to be shown the way. "And if you are hungry and want supper later, just come down here and Jonie here will heat something up for you." "Very kind of you!"

We're lead along a short hallway, up some stairs and a screen door is pushed aside. A curtain is pulled back and we're beckoned inside.

It's some kind of soiree; mood lighting (!) via candles rather than torches or lanterns, people in ball costumes, people walking around with trays or clearing glasses. Well this version of the dream reality fits our arrival, for sure. Some 20 or so guests. Bel spots the performance area straight away and we follow. He starts setting up - Oswen has to whisper to him, "Bel, don't forget why we're here! We have to spot Zybilna" "Yes, we have to give the performance of our li - wait, spot who?" "Zybilna. We're in a dream. We can steer how the dream, works, but we're at a risk of losing ourselves. Well, it's Tasha we're after, but we *might* recognise her because we've seen Zybilna. Just look out for whoever is running this party - the people it's *for*." And we do set up, for appearances!

Oswen can't see enough of the room - all she sees is legs. Inafina can't hear much; it's just too noisy. But Bel's insight helps. "Pst!" he says. "I found them! I think those two are in charge over there! The really big guy with the General-like blazer..." - an older, somewhat rotund man with a walrus beard, bald, military style decorations on his blue and gold blazer, white pants - "...and her..." - an older lady alongside, who wears a somewhat puffy dinner jacket over a wide skirt ball gown. They look the part. They're human, 70s by the looks of it. After watching for a moment, we see that they're clearly hosting.

So maybe we need to get the attention of the people on the floor. Let's play!

Bel leads. And off we go! Performance, with ADV for all as he's leading:

* Bel NAT 20 -> 32
* Kindle  15-1 -> 14 (with advantage and blowing inspo.)
* Inafina 17
* Oswen 11 (with advantage and blowing inspo., oh dear, but she's low down and easily overlooked!)

Inafina and Bel are definitely carrying us! She appears to be playing - a fiddle, like the fiddler in the tavern; that must've been where she got the idea. Oswen's playing her usual panflute, Kindle has a double bass. Bel is leading on the *saxophone*. Wow. But he's quite exceptional at it!

People are getting into it; dancing starts; we watch for faces, to see if anyone looks like they _might_ be Tasha?!

We play for quite a while. Perception is middling across the board, but not terrible. Certainly nobody that looks like Zybilna, but what's more, nobody the age of Tasha - someone young - the youngest here may be in their 40s, not a talented, ambitious 30-year-old.

We finish up the set (!) to polite applause. The lady of the house asks for attention. "We will adjourn to the sitting room for refreshments and games. And maybe a poetry reading or two!"

The file out as we pack up, insofar as it's necessary in a dream world. As we do so, the lord of the house comes to thank us. "That was unexpected! Not the kind of music I thought you would play but it got everyone in very high spirits." "Thank you!" says Oswen, then mentions, "I don't suppose you know a young lady by the name of Tasha? We were hoping she might be here." - Inafina 21, notices the general's demeanour change. Curious. It's almost defeated; sad; disappointed. "I *had* hoped she would come up, too. But she hasn't really left her study in weeks. I - I... I hoped she'd come up for the lady's birthday today, but she's down in her study. I'm sorry if you were hoping to see her. Who is she to you, anyway? Why are you interested in my court mage?"

Oswen says, "Ah well, you are sir of course a household of some note and your court mage apparently is of some talent too." "Has she done something bad?!" "On the contrary! I have been practicing some of the magical arts myself, and wondered if I might be able to chat, to compare notes, so to speak?" He seems a bit flustered. "Well - be my guest - but... You never know if she'll be happy to see you or not." But apparently sometimes she does... Odd things... "But I've had too much to drink!" - he presses a bag of coins into Bel's hand, thanks him again, Bel is glowing. He gives us permission to see Tasha, via Mona, the matron.

Anyway, at least we're allowed down. We need to find the matron again - now we know she's called Mona - to be led to Tasha's study.

Back in the kitchen, apparently we're supposed to wait for a cake that might be ready soon. "Would you like some tea?" We agree and thank her; Oswen has the idea of bringing some of the cake to Tasha.

It's a honey cake, caramel source, brown sugar too. Very rich, very sweet, very much to Oswen's style but maybe a bit much for Inafina. The subject of seeing Tasha and taking down cake is brought up, and it seems Mona and Joni are a little afraid of her... "We can't say for certain - but - well - there have been *sounds* in the castle. Coming from her workshop and study... The dungeons... Well - the boys brought food down for her the other day and *swear* they saw a demon. So I dunno if it's - y'know... Are you going to be OK?"

"Well we've been warned now. And - well, we can look after ourselves..."

They concede. Joni gives us a big chunk of the cake in a little cake box with cutlery and even ties it. We follow the directions and head down.

A circular stone stairway down; walk across; down again. She's right the way down, under the store of the castle. Oswen is talking softly to the group as we walk - "Well, demons are in keeping with the book she was compiling. Interesting that this would be her dreams and given the way this whole thing is set up, I wonder if somehow that's actually some kind of *work* space for her and there's to this than just idle fancy. We may need to be more careful than I thought."

Oswen's a little nervous. But Alustriel won't have made a mistake - this is the "pre bad phase" Tasha - she's researching dangerous things, but it doesn't mean she's bad and the rest of the castle won't understand so superstition is taking hold. Perhaps. Well, anyway, Bel takes a torch from a wall because down here things aren't illuminated. Just a passageway. Oswen wonders if magic works; she wants to cast Detect Magic. And she wants the book, but she doesn't - oh, wow. Her spellbook appears next to her, floating, when she thinks about it. Good, still have some control. She tries the casting. It succeeds, and she picks up faint trails of magic, like residue. Abjuration. She says, "This is very strange - the spell is working. But we're in a dream. I'm seeing a dream of magic, or is it actually real?"

She follows the gradient, heading to ever-more powerful sources. There's a door; Bel finds a sconce and puts the torch in; she knocks.

"I don't want anything! Everything's fine!"

Bel knocks and says, almost meekly, "Tasha?"

Oswen calls out, "I'm so sorry for the interruption, I know your work is important. My name is Oswen; we are visitors here; I wonder if we could speak to you for a moment?"

There's powerful abjuration magic on the door - which lifts. The door handle turns and the door opens a crack. There is a young, very pale-looking woman, jet black hair; the only thing we really recognise of her is the tattoo of the chicken's foot that's there, even this early on, under her eye. She wears a sort of rather severely-tailored dress of sorts, dark coloured, rather than a loose robe. She has magical charms around her neck. A lot of abjuration. ARC 17, various kinds of wards and protection from evil. She notices magic in the room behind, most notably on the floor. Oswen nods towards the charms around the neck and says, "You can never be too careful with the lower planes" at the very same time as Tasha says, "You can't be here! It's not safe for you to be here!"

She narrows her eyes. Tilts her head. "Do I know you?"

Oswen says, "Well, I'm going to jump right in with both feet here, even though it might seriously bite me in the ass. The honest and accurate answer to your question is that - you *will* do."

She harumphs. Pops her head out. Looks up and down the corridor. "Come in but hurry!" and we scurry inside. She shuts the door and the ward goes back up.

Oh my, a strong smell of brimstone. There are cages around, but crumpled as if there was a fight. Chains. Wards all over the place. Magic reagents around. Scrolls scattered across a table. All kinds of spell components and ingredients. At least three magic circles are drawn on the ground. There's nothing summoned right now, though, fortunately. Oswen says, "Well, I'm glad there's nothing here *now*, we've made a few enemies on those planes!"

Kindle awkwardly holds out the cake. "This is for you!"

Oswen gets into saying that well, Tasha is a person of noted ability, she has some skill herself albeit lesser, we've offered to take back a pile of plates she has on a table and when Tasha says "But Joni can do that", we explain that the rest of the castle is a bit afraid... ADV persuasion, nat 20!

Tasha starts getting quite excited. Oswen listens closely. Tasha talks of powers of names and documenting demons - devils you can outsmart, but demons are chaotic - she'll write a book, the true names of demons, then we don't have to fear them - and so-on. "Can you imagine if we were able to control them? To control that raw chaotic power? There is way more power in chaos than there is in regimented form."

It's interesting, for Oswen because that line of thinking is the line she herself went down with the book of names Mordenkainen found. Even without knowing Tasha's future she would've known this could be a dark path to tread.

* This is a dream space
* Yes it's also a workshop
* Tasha believes there are thus no consequences; she can explore ideas safely
* She thinks this solves the risk of writing her book
* Magic does work for real here because she allows it
* She can shut down anything through sheer force of will

"Consequence-free investigation. I can pursue my flights of fancy. Things I couldn't do in the real world without being locked away! If you're not allowed to think *freely* then... Then we live in a cage. Whose cage? Who has made this cage? We have to be able to ask questions? It's just knowledge. Knowledge in and of itself can neither be good nor bad. It is *us*, the people and academies and governments and so-on that decide if it is good or bad. Surely you agree?"

We get into it. Chalk lines of timelines... Tasha is clever; she understands we can't tell her things that would break her future (and invalidate what we told her, most likely, in so doing). We tell her that anything she learns, if she documents it, can be passed on to her future self (which for reasons we *can't* explain is not the person we need - we need *her, now*. And so it goes on. Eventually, she agrees. It seems mostly she wants to meet Alustriel (whose name we have intentionally not yet spoken) and so she gets Oswen to help work out the process of splitting herself, a little back in time so her here-self doesn't remember us meeting.

Oswen flat Arcana 27, albeit with Bardic. She does a good job of helping though Tasha is leading the idea. It's interesting that Tasha knows how to do this. It comes up that Tashs thinks if we knew the true name of "this being", then we could control them. **We don't know if that's the case for Vecna - but my goodness, what a discovery *that* would be if it were possible!**

"But only notable people of strong lineage tend to have true names. A person who was a nobody, no matter their power now, might not have one."

The preparations are complete. We work out where we need to be. There are particular locations we must visit while avoiding anyone in the house. We elect to leave the cake outside the door, as if the four of us thought better of it - so Joni won't mention it to other-her and cause confusion.

We get going. Treads of magic being unpicked, a chant, incantation, but it's not magic to Oswen, or least not a spell? It seems more like some kind of device, a think that works in the dream world, but she's making stuff happen some other way. Exerting her will, like she said. We have to be quiet - group check - Oswen's stealth is a nat 1, nat 1! Only 3 total. But Inafina? 23. Bel, nat 20. Kindle not so good. But Inafina and Bel cover for us both. We sneak to where we need to sneak!

There's a moment of close timing where we have just a few seconds, and we have to run, so that when other-her opens her room door, we aren't there. It's almost comical knock-and-run job. We *just* make it!

"I think that worked!" says Tasha. "Where shall I meet you? You need to tell Mona that we decided to just drop off the cake. Where can we meet where it's unlikely someone will bump into us?" Oswen figures - stables, probably. So that's set. We head up, explain to Mona that we thought better of it and listened to their advice but did leave the cake. We thank them for their hospitality, make our excuses and "the musicians" leave. We hurry to the stables and find Tasha already there.

"What now?"

Oswen HIS 19. Alustriel said, "tell me when you're ready and I'll pull all of you through" - but we're asleep. "Well if magic works..." says Oswen and tries Sending. D20->16. "Tasha has kindly agreed to assist. We five are ready to depart the dream work." Oswen knows the spell worked, but didn't get an answer. Since we have a moment to wonder WTF is happening, Tasha asks "I'm dying to know!" and we mention Alustriel and Vecna. She's surprised that it's been 50-60 years; so her future self is an old crone? Well, no... And she asks if she succeeded (about the book) but before Oswen has a chance to think how to answer *that*, suddenly we are all awake and on the floor in Alustriel's room. Sunlight streams in from outside and it's the four of us, with the simulacrum next to us.

"Welcome to the Outlands!" says Oswen.

## Campaign day 31

Outlands "sunlight" streams through the windows. It's too bright for the late afternoon; how much time has passed? Alustriel is coming out of a trance, sat cross-legged, right next to us. "Oh! Oh. Great? Great! OK!" - and she heads over to Tasha's "body" and checks for a pulse. "Are you alright? How did it go?"

"What time is it?" asks Oswen.

"Umm... Maybe 9? In the morning?"

"Just one night passed? We weren't out longer, were we?"

"Only one night."

Oswen starts, "I think it went well - " but is interrupted by Tasha stirring. She is intrigued by this strange body; she tests it; it feels the same, curiously. But she doesn't think she's quite as strong. She introduces herself to Alustriel - "I'm Tasha; but you would know that!"

The two talk. "What did you tell her?" asks Alustriel at one point, suspicious, in our direction. We explain a bit; the bargain that we'll return the notes to her "current self", but we are ambiguous about what happened in between. Tasha understands why she couldn't be told more *then*, but she's "out of the stream" now. Oswen tries to dissuade her, but to no avail. Tasha doesn't push us, but does push Alustriel. "I'll be working with you? OK. Well, one way or another, I'll find out eventually."

Then Tasha looks around - "And why does this cottage look like the one I grew up in?!"

*That* explains the feel of this place not matching our expectations! We talk more about who *we* are, at Tasha's request, then Tasha asks why she's hear. Our four stories had mentioned names and events of which she has no knowledge. So what gives?

At this, Alustriel talks about herself. How she was swept up in the early events of the feud of the gods on Toril, the Murderous Three, the events that led to the spell plague, how she escaped as one of Mystra's Chosen. She thus has a complex relationship with that god. Almost an ambassador, or agent now. Then the story gets closer to *our* - uuh - lifetimes (!) and eventually starts to describe relationships and events we have heard before.

She was a sun elf; a humble beginning; but she had a particular talent for magic a level above those around her. She wonders if what's why Mystra chose her. She feels a sense of responsibility. "To the protection of magic; but also, for managing and dealing with the consequences of such powerful magic."

Well, the reason Tasha is here - likewise, she has a talent. She is between worlds. Yes, she practices magic by study but can handle the weave innately. A manner akin to sorcerers. Tasha disputes that last part technically - although Oswen thinks it was only intended as an analogy, loose, but Tasha seems quite literal - but acknowledges her magic is rather unconventional. She practiced it without teaching early in life. And in the end, Alustriel thinks that this is the key to helping with things *she* needs to defeat Vecna. It requires a combination of the equations of magic, but also an innate ability to weave. "We can't out-cast Vecna", she says; "we need your creativity, your fearlessness."

Oswen is astonished. She knew Alustriel was powerful and had lived a long life but... "*You* saw all *that?* First hand?" "Saw what?" (She has something of a one-track mind, Oswen notes) Oswen answers "The feud of the gods, the Murderous Three, the spell plague, all that." "Yes, but it wasn't all *that* long ago - fewer than 3 centuries, 3 at most!" Well - I suppose it might have been that soon...

There's a technicality for Tasha; she's worried that magic will be limited and does not 'recharge', but Alustriel thinks that because she's a *real* soul inhabiting the body, then when she rests, she will recharge as normal. "OK! So where's the nearest town?" and Alustriel points the way. At this, Tasha summons a steed and off she rides, on a very fast phantom steed.

As for us? Well, we've a vague lead on the Hand, but the person using that doesn't have the Eye. Alustriel says that if we did obtain the Eye, then we could simply put it in the path of the Hand wearer and it'll be irresistible to them. However, she also tells us - whoever it is *currently* wielding the Eye would be far too powerful for us to take down. "No shade on your abilities but even *I* wouldn't want to find myself in that situation" says Alustriel.

It turns out their plan was to simply identify the two individuals, then try to lay a breadcrumb so the two meet, fight and then there's one left with both artefacts - but surely then *that* being would be even more powerful, so how could you ever take them down? "I never said it would be easy!" says Alustriel. "But if the legend is true, it gives them both great power, but also an inescapable vulnerability to the Sword of Kas which should be able to destroy both of those artefacts. But as you know, they *must* be together for that to work."

This is all only theory, but there *is* a story of the Sword of Kas being used to destroy just one - the Eye. It killed the person, but the Eye teleported away.

The timing must be perfect. The Eye and Hand must be destroyed just before the Rod is first used to weaken Vecna, then someone in the same physical space as him can kill him - well, sever his divine spark from the physical body, since he's now a God. Then the final power of the Rod can be used to trap the divine spark; banish it somewhere. It'll then disperse into seven truly unknown locations. So all those moving parts must somehow be synchronised.

**Yes - the absolute best we can do is kick the can many thousands of years down the road.** And nobody will have any idea where the rod parts are the next time around... But that's because the rod wasn't used to banish Vecna last time; it was used to banish Mishka the Wolf Spider, a demon, that's why it was built. In theory if it's used to banish Vecna this time, then he shouldn't be able to come back. Now, he could if the rod was found! So if it can't be found ever, in theory he can never come back ever.

Now, where might we go to find out about the Eye... Alustriel is wondering about that. With Sigil gone, there should be a coalescing of a new place to do such trade. It could be Trade Gate but is likely to be larger and probably more abstract; possibly even a location in the Astral Sea. Wherever it is, find *that* and you'd have the second-greatest gathering of people from different planes; a good place to try finding information about the Eye.

"But I was wondering" says Alustriel "about one plane in particular. In the middle of the Etherial plane is a place called the Radiant Citadel?!"

Ah! That's where the 2nd rod segment was going. "It was?!" says Alustriel - oh! Not Golden Vault. "Um oops - don't tell Mordenkainen we told you that..."

We're told it's a place of great dignity, like Sigil but run by guardians of many long-lost worlds, the last of their kind. Some think their worlds were cut off and they seek to reconnect to them, others believe the worlds were destroyed and they escaped. When we're there, we have to be - "...respectful", as Alustriel puts it. But there's one way it's totally opposite to Sigil; there is no ruler. Instead, it is run by a council with representatives from all of the worlds. It's not a democracy; the council rules by consensus.

"It's old, but nothing compared to Sigil. It contains crystals which connect to remnants of other lands and other worlds; pockets of what was saved. A mysterious place. And that's almost all I know. I've spent little time there myself - I find it bewildering, fascinating but confrontingly confusing!"

Well it certainly sounds like a better place to start than faffing around in Trade Gate bookshops. And Oswen has had an intellectual curiosity about there ever since she heard about it! So there's a selfishness, in part, to that decision.

A little like Sigil (though mechically very different) you can't just Planeshift there. There's a travel crystal, though, which can get us there - Alustriel has heard of it - a location, on a shattered plane. We "board that crystal" - I guess it's a big crystal, ship sized! - and it'll take us there. (It can also be reached by "venturing into the Deep Ethereal - but that's only for the _very_ experienced").

The shattered plane? It's called **Siabsungkoh**. Oswen had read about a shattered plane in relation to cut-off worlds, and Alara had come up, but it's obviously not that one! She says truthfully, "Not I've heard of or read about." "I would've been surprised if you had!"

We've had a sleep, we've had some tea; there's no time like the present.

"Look for the Concord Jewel. It should be easy to find - a crystal that's about, ooh, forty feet tall. Can't miss it!" says Alustriel.

She figures it'll be more reliable to send us there than try to use the amulet purely from a name of a place with which Oswen is completely unfamiliar, and moreover, Alustriel knows a specific teleportation circle there which should be a good place to start. So, she draws the circle (and Oswen takes a copy at her behest). We step inside; runes brighten until we have to shade our eyes from the glare and then, suddenly, that's gone.



### Siabsungkoh

A room with a balcony. A beautiful evening, seen from maybe the third storey of the building we're in; many pitched, shingle-roofed set of buildings in a small town beyond, lots of brick arches; water glitters in the distance. A market is being set up nearby, colourful awnings, probably a night market. It's comfortingly familiar for a plane with such an exotic name which has, at least for us, such an exotic purpose. And "shattered plane" - we are all surprised, in fact.

"Can you smell that?!" says Bel. "That's prawns being grilled!"

"But just had - well, OK, we had tea and not breakfast. And we seem to have missed a day. So I guess we should eat! But where are we? How do we get out of here?" After a brief look around, we realise that this isn't just a room with a balcony, it's on some kind of tower and the balcony leads to an *external* spiral staircase that winds down it.

The architecture is almost elven, but rather more robust/solid. Stacked, polished stone. Multicoloured shingles and a lot of beautiful tile work. "Almost feels like some of the big public buildings back home" says Oswen, pointing to the tiles. We find many references to things we know, trying to make sense of it all, but all our own points of reference are individually disconnected. Nonetheless, this place looks coherent.

We see some - children? - playing. Kobolds? No, 3-4 feet tall, but not dragon people. Jackals? Something like that. Maybe coyotes! They're otherwise humanoid. Their clothing is very colourful, long strips of died cloth with intricate details and textures, wrapped around creatively, flowing with loops and ties and pockets.

The water we saw is a beautiful sea, with a couple of islands. Behind us the land slopes up to a range of mountains, with clouds behind - except we can see the sea *ends*. And we realise, as we look closely, that it's not a horizon. It's as if this is a big island. What's more, we walk more and then, we get a view of a beautiful-looking translucent green crystal hovering above the water.

"She was right. Can't miss it..."

Bel looks bit dismayed but Oswen says, "...but food first, don't worry!"

We head into the night market.

Beautiful planters with huge jacaranda trees and massive purple flowers flank the entrance, with lanterns hanging of a trellis, just covered in them. We're corralled into many narrow streets lined with all manner of stalls with an air of permanence. Some are closed; day time; many are open or opening. Curios and fortune telling and drinks and food and -...

"Wait, did you say fortune telling?!" asks Inafina

...she turns on her heel. "Yes! Yes, your fortune! Come, come!" says a lady - but no crone! It's a young woman, very beautiful large eyes and a petite snout (remember, dog-people). "I've been waiting for you!" (OK, so this stallholder is onto it!) - we are offered flower-shaped soft candies, very aromatic and delicious.

"You. Softpaws. Sit here."

Inafina sits. A silken cloth is smoothed out between them. She pours cups of tea and hands them out to everyone. Then she reaches into a bag, shakes, listens a few times; empties it - various small stones roll onto the table. "Choose the stone that is calling to you. Put your hand over them. One of them calls to you. That is the question on your mind."

Insight 17. She's not sure if she believes it or not, but it's fun anyway. But as she waves her hands over the stones, she *does* feel a curious draw to one. She picks it - a little surprised at the impulse.

(The stone is turned over. It has a mountain with the sun above it. Oh. So all these stones have pictures on them? They all landed upside down. Weighted maybe?)

"You think of home. You are worried. What is it you want to know? To ask if you shall return? If you should stay away? What kind of question do you have about your home?"

Inafina looks surprised a moment, then hardens a little and says, perhaps a bit abruptly - "How long it has left before it's taken over."

"...Interesting question. Have you drunk your tea?" "Not all of it!" "Please finish first."

Inafina drinks. We all do. She takes Inafina's cup and studies the inside. "You want... An answer because you do not know how you feel about home. The question you ask is not the one you answered in your cup. I will have to consult a different oracle."

She reaches into a chest and gets another bag. The stones are pushed aside; the bag is rattled; then it is opened, "This can only be answered by one other than us. I do not know, you do not know. These bones will." They're spread over the table and she spends a good minute humming and haaing.

"The bones do not know! This future is changing! This future is... Obscured."

She looks frustrated, but Inafina holds up a hand. "That's a better answer than you know."

"But I cannot see it. I cannot see this fortune. This future."

(Oswen, Arcana 19; she thinks this whole process amounts to ritual-casting things. There's more to this than meets the eye though she's never seen this form of magic before).

"Yes, that's why it's a better answer. It tells me we can still make a difference."

"Do you have another question I can answer?" - she seems almost distressed.

Inafina thinks a while. "OK, then, well, you mentioned that the cup answered a question I did not ask. What did the cup say?"

"Ah! The cup tells me that you are afraid of the future; it suggests that you want to be forced into - no, not into - *to* take a path. You want the decision to be taken away from you because you are too uncertain to choose. You are conflicted."

"I am conflicted, but I do not know if I wish to be forced to choose while conflicted, rather than am willing to wait until the conflict resolves."

"Well, yes, postpone the decision."

"Yes. So for the future, my question becomes, *will* I ever return?"

"A better question." The cup is studied more. "You will return. I see you in your home in the future. That much is certain." But she suddenly grabs Inafina's hand and her eyes go wide. "BUT! But - there is much danger before that time! And the outcomes of this path we are on... It is not the same path as the one in the cup."

She drops the cup and looks frightened. "Do you walk in two worlds, softpaws? Tell me? Tell me!"

"I - I don't know? I mean, this isn't my world here, and I travel on many."

"The wrong word... Not... Not world. No! Do you walk in two - existences?!" - she touches Inafina's face; "You are real? So how can... How can you have two futures both of which are true?"

Oswen clears her throat and says, "Um, not what I think you want to hear 'Fina but one way that could happen is if your world did fall, and then its future temporarily - we hope - would follow two paths; the path that should be, and the path the _he_ rewrites."

The lady leans forward. "Interesting theory. Could be possible. But... Hmm..."

(But it's not right). She beckons us inside the back part behind the stall and lowers a curtain after checking surreptitiously! "I didn't fully understand what you were explaining little one. Can you explain again? I wondered at first if it was my tools or if it was my questions or just bad luck! But my fortunes of late have been forked."

(We learn that this is the last of their world. Its spirit lives on in the Radiant Citadel but the people here wait, in case any others find their way home through the emptiness to this place. So they stay.)

* She knows of other planes and predicts for them.
* She sees either one clear future, or two; it's confusing.
* Oswen hypothesises that two futures - well, Vecna-ruled or not Vecna-ruled; he might already be there but it can yet be undone, or could be going there yet.
* But for the one future - that is interesting. Vecna is there, and it can't be undone? Or Vecna either can't get there, or it's too far ahead to even factor into this strange magic?

She will tell Zorhanna of this. "It's not good for my fortunetelling business though!" - yet it could be far more important than she realises. She won't be drawn on price though, but Inafina (insight 20+7) realises there's a sign - "Pay what you deem the answer to be worth" and another, "Fortunes guaranteed or its free!" - but what is a good price? She sees small bowl with coins in. It seems like they're mostly of a specific type, which have a hole in the middle, made of gold. She asks what the currency is and pulls out one of her own gold coins to compare. We learn that one of the things with a hole are worth about 2.5 of our gold pieces.

She says "This is for the answer I did get..." - and gives 10gp, or 4 of theirs - and the fortune teller smiles - but Inafina continues and motions to Oswen "...and this is for the answer I did not." She's going to give 10pp but the fortune teller refuses! So we insist at least on another 10gp. "I might be wrong" says Oswen, "But this really could be something important and useful."

"Well then I have something else. I think these are meant for you."

She fetches a box and takes out four small gilded flowers with a pin. We can wear them. "Four of you, four of these! I'm sure this is meant to be! These are Dyn Singh Market charms." She is Lady (Miss) Tyenmo. "The charms, if you wear them, will tell people that you are a guest of one of the stalls."

"Thank you!"

She explains that the market is arranged in rings and tells us how to navigate effectively. The rings are cut into quadrants by straight-line alleyways and quadrants are specialised to sell specific categories. In the middle is an event ground with big tents.

We must visit:

* The Spicy Brothers
* Her cousin runs the best noodle shop in the area, Tyenmo Noodles
* For Oswen, Mystic's Alley - Varda's Otherworldly Goods
* Kindle... Protective? Vai's stall - lucky amulets
* Best seafood - always has a queue but - Xungoon Family Seafood Stall
* And for Bel... Madam Culp's Silk in Seamstress Alley

But be careful - the charms are useful but won't "keep the wynlings away". They are - adorable, but pests! They are small, big-eyed flying mice of a sort. Bat wings. Cute ears. They get into pockets and bags and take things. Make sure it's all zipped and buttoned!

We thank her and take our leave. We chat a bit about it and Bel wants food! Just before we wander off Oswen casts L3 Sending to, well she'd like to tell Zorhanna but she's busy with Athas - not good to interrupt her with that - so she messages Allustriel instead (D20->7->OK):

"Fortune teller called Lady Tyenmo at Dyn Singh Market on Siabsungkoh. Sees double futures for many planes. Only single futures for others. Could be useful?"

There's a rapid response. "Curious. Never considered that. Perhaps I will run some divinations to see divergences happen near to him."

We head in search of grilled prawns at a recommended stall. D6->2. We see the Spicy Brothers stall first, alon "tiny chilli alley". We'd almost pass it by - but this time, it's Kindle who gets excited. "It smells amazing!" We go in; the whole alley is *very* aromatic. Food looks very spicy, some people even sweating, but they all seem to be enjoying it. We'd take more time, but we *do* have a mission sadly... So we head to Spicy Brothers. There's a bit of a crowd, but then we see them.

Two almost-human people, dwarf height, but human faces and golden-brown skin. A group around stand back for a moment as someone in the crowed points a finger and says, "I know you did it! I will - I will prove it! You! You always up to no good!" and they storm away. An older guy, human-height, but a kind of monkey-like face and long hair and dog ears.

The two take a moment to recover - then "Who's next?!"

We wait our turn but we get conspiratorial - we *have* to find out what that was about! - and we collectively vote Bel to be our charming spokesperson (!).

Four large, deep ceramic pots over some coals. Simmering away. A big bamboo tub full of rice is alongside. They're different kinds of curry, and we decide to share two between the four of us. Kindle likes the green one. Bel goes with red, to compliment it. As they're being dished up, he asks about the other guy; apparently he's been accusing them repeatedly for sabotaging his food! "But it makes no sense... Why would we? He's not even in the same alley. But he's so sure it's us! I don't know why."

"Do wynlings ever do that kind of thing? Just mess about with stuff? Maybe just having fun but messing it up?"

"But - well, they're not focused like that. And why does he think it's us? And it's not like you can run a stall in this market and not have some ways to deal with them already figured out."

We're handed the food and head away to try it. We find various low stone tables with stools or cushions towards the centre, lots of small performances happening. Wind and brass instruments get played with drums. "So how do we find that old guy again? I didn't see where he went."

We didn't either. Maybe an adjacent arm? Well, the curry... (1sp a bowl)... CON saves:

* Oswen 19 handles it fine
* Inafina 6 tries it first but can't handle the heat at all
* Bel goes bright red and coughs!
* Kindle loves it

A good flavour but too hot for Inafina and Bel - 3 fire damage! We return the bowls and ask where the guy's stall is, then before looking for him, look for drinks. "That's the youngest brother of the Xungoon family! One of the most famous stalls in the whole market."

A stall sells just coconuts... Four for 1sp. Just what we needed. So now, to the seafood stall. There's a queue, of course, so we have to join. But staff seem flustered, apologising for wait times; some customers at a table flag one down and insist on speaking to "Gammon". Oswen sends Orvil forward to try overhear what's happening over towards where the kitchen should be. He flies and lands on top of the stall. One group says, "Where is Gammon? He's usually here?" "Why is the food taking so long? What's going on today?" "Where is my food?" all that kind of stuff. Orvil can see someone at the back of a stall, frantic, trying to push some barrels upright, picking up broken crockery and more. Oswen "sees" that and motions for the others, "We might not be welcomed but he needs help back there..." - and we find a way around that uses a service alley.

He's trying to pick up large urns and tureens where lids have been smashed. Some food has been mixed up too. Without saying anything we start to pitch in - picking things up, cleaning them, Mending and so-on, trying to help clean up the physical damage. As we work in, we start talking. He's sure it's the brothers - "Look, this has been here every time this has happened!" - and he points. There is a hand print with a streak of green curry on a tarp that would normally cover food. "And here!" - a sack has a streak of red curry.

We don't say anything but likely all four of us, certain Oswen and Inafina think that's too careless for anyone trying to do anything surreptitious; so now, as we clean up, we investigate. Inafina can't see much (per. 10) but Oswen (inv. 28)... She examines things next to broken objects. Small claw marks on broken things. If she follows them, she can see little smears - sticky, nectar of some kind. She asks innocently as if an idle question, "We're new here and we've been hearing about wynlings - do they like sweet things?" "Wynlings live in the mountains - their natural food is nectar, from mountain flowers. The ones that hang around the market have developed a taste for cooked food, though!"

After we've helped, we're invited back some time to have a "steam boat" on us, whatever that is!

He's kept talking about how the brothers are hiding something so we head back to that alley way. He said they were unusually defensive even the first time this ever happened when he was asking very politely even if they'd just been there for other reasons and saw what happened.

We get Orvil up to fly down onto Spicy Brothers and see if he can see much around there, especially around the back of the stall. But Orvil perception only 11. A lot of rice spilled on the ground in the alleyway behind and curry streaks and more splashed out away from the back! We go around that back alley to have a closer look. Inafina, 19 - via inspo - she doesn't see it, she *hears* it. Chittering sounds, flapping of wings. A couple of wynlings fly away. She points them out; "Well, they're around..." - they appear to have been hanging around in the back of the stall. Oswen investigation 18. They've left claw marks on a covered wagon tucked under the tarp of the back of the stall. In the process of that - stealth 14. She sees dollops of nectar on the ground around the cart here, too and on areas where claw marks were. She can also see a cracked ceramic urn which looks like it used to carry another curry, a brown one. That's leaked out, as well as the mounds of rice.

So what's doing it? But one of the brothers hears a sound in the back. He turns around, lifts the curtain and sees Oswen there investigating! "Oh. It's you! What are you doing here?! Are you inspectors?"

Oswen looks emabaarassed. "OK, you caught me. We're more busybodies to be honest. We found a lot of damage over at Xungoon and helped clean up a bit but we found scratches and nectar and stuff, very odd, then we were back here in the alley and found all this curry and rice and found this nectar and more scratches... Did you know about all this"

He looks flustered. "Well... Yes... This has been happening for the last week..."

In the course of discussion he sees some noodles. But he knows it's not Tyenmo Noodles or anyone like that. So - wait, what? Would we find seafood "evidence" there?! Probably.

But why wynlings? He seems to be hiding something. We can't get anything more out of him; he mentions something about "some of us wanting to stay, but some of us wanting to go" and won't say more. He gets back to work.

Well, all we can do is try the noodle stall. And lo, grilled prawns! With noodles. Many different things. We eat first, to get a feel for it. Great food! Two of the dishes are crossed off but we know what *that* will be! Two silvers again, for two bowls. People keep asking about the sold-out noodles - surely it's too early?! - but we know better. Once we've finished we go around the back service alley, now familiar with these things and, sure enough, damage. A rip in the back of the tent, lots of food scattered around. 

Investigation again; we're getting practiced at this now. Nectar, scratches. Bags ripped open, food wasted. Here and there are - crab legs?! It's a terrible job of trying to frame someone! We are discussing what to do when a family member comes into the back to throw out a bowl of dirty water. We get into a conversation. They've more recently checked their food; no nectar; so this happens after they get into the market and are setting up. They too have found wynlings and know the sea food is an obvious misdirection! This all does point though to a deliberate act.

Oswen looks around. Footprints, spilled nectar, scratches, anything; too many footprints to isolate with Investigation 24. But we do note the nectar is only on this stall, not any around it - and they're close to each other - and only on *top* of broken things, not on the sides or underneath. But it is under tarp sometimes, so it didn't "rain" down from above. We first re-check the fishfood place and they've stacked the broken things outside now. We can reconstruct things. Again, nectar is smeared around the top of things. Much has been eaten and claw marks indicate an attempt to lift/open lids, as presumably the wynlings tried to get at hoped-for more food inside. Perhaps these were even *trained* to do it.

We next kinda creep around the back of Spicy Bros, but can't see the crockery outside. Inafina has to sneak in! But it's only stealth 4+9->13. She steps on a piece of crockery with a loud crack and freezes... But the brothers seem busy at the front of the stall! But while she stepped on a shard, she can't see the bulk of it. Strange. She looks around; perception 26. Tucked behind a drawer she thinks she can see some crockery - wait, no, nectar. On a brush. Balanced on top of a jar of nectar! Red handed?!

How strange. Why would they do this? She creeps back out and lets us know.

"Well, we can't go in making accusations - they might reasonably have that for food prep, but it's quite the coincidence. I think we might have to wait until they finish service so they're not distracted and have chat. We need to tread softly, not make accusations. This is more complex than we realise."

We may as look at the rest of the market. Those amulets, for Kindle maybe? We find the stall easily - it's not shy! A very "loud" font on the sign announces **LUCKY AMULETS**. Inside this open-fronted stall are display cases, along the sides. A male-dressed, pointy-eared, jackal-like, dark colouring to the very short, sleep hair that covers the bodies (so far as we've seen!) of the majority of residents here. "Mr? Vai? I presume?"

"Yes! You can just call me Vai!" he introduces us to his collection. They're often, but not only, for luck. His lucky amulets all seem to have a stone. "Those give you just that little bit of a charmed life! And *those* have rather more specific effects. I've traded for decades with travellers, bards, even kings and I'm sure more than a few grave robbers..." - many of them need attunement, inevitably, but there are others - albeit less powerful - but they work by merely being worn. He shows us one that's rather familiar, as writing reminds us of things we saw on the Conchordant Express. This one has strange interlocking gears that spin around each other. "This is from Mechanus" says Vai. "A little piece of clockwork, very exact, very predictable. Listen to it..." - Inafina listens to it - and nods, extremely rhythmic, timing sounds perfect. "If you need to defend yourselves and are trying to swing back at someone, then once a day you can draw on the predictability of the gears..." - game mechanic: Amounts to a 10, instead of rolling.

That's tempting. But Inafina is scanning the room, with some help of the group - perception 25. Kindle hasn't noticed something... A surprisingly recognisable amulet due to a symbol - a giant ram's horn or similar, filled with food, corn, apples - a cornucopia - on a piece of ceramic that is shaped like a shield. An older, less stylised version for sure but *it looks like Kindle's amulet*. Yondalla? She asks Kindle. "What about this?" "Wow! It *is*! I've never seen it depicted like this." We ask Vai. "Oh! Well, that is from the Outlands! It's from a community of halflings who run a sort of commune or farm. Occasionally they come through and sell food here." Well, who'd have thought?! We don't name-drop knowing the location. "We can only grow so much food here, obviously, so they come for festivals and to provide more food. I saw one wearing this; I thought it was quaint..." - he clears his throat! - "...or *rustic* rather. It *is* magical. But it doesn't seem to work for me. It belonged to a priest of theirs."

Oswen says softly, "See how it feels if you pick it up" to Kindle then, quickly remembering herself, "May we?!" to Vai. "Of course!"

Kindle holds it, looking tiny in his large hand. "It feels... Comforting to the touch. Like it has stories." He turns it over. "There's writing on the back! I can't read it" - Oswen asks, "It's probably Halfling" so he hands it to yer. It's an old dialect; she says, "This must be very old. But I understand it. A poem of sorts. Tiny!" - she has to squint. She translates as best she can. Kindle recognises it - a prayer to Yondalla. He's never seen it in the original halfling.

"Whether or not it's useful magically" says Oswen, "would this not be rather nice for you to have?"

Vai says, "I think this piece speaks to you!" - a salesman, after all. "A special piece in how it came to me and I feel its purpose for you would require me to make an offer for *your* amulet."

"An exchange?" says Kindle, perplexed.

"If you desire that."

"...I might need to pray on that, if that's OK."

"By all means. It certainly looks like a religious icon; so that makes sense. Let me give you a bit of privacy!"

Kindle is beckoned into a back area of the stall, hunched over a little, and he's there in private behind a curtain thinking. We give him space.

What else? Many choices. All need attunement. Then Oswen has an idea. "Do you have anything that might help just a little - say - if someone were to be trying to grow something but it was a difficult season or a less healthy plant than hoped?"

Vai thinks a while. He doesn't have something exactly like that but picks a large charm, fist sized for a halfling, silver thread wrapped around a bundle of plant stems! It's attached to a thin leather strap for carrying. "Believe it or not, this was quite hard to get. The person who I got this from spoke of its powers with great reverence, and unfortunately I've never seen another one like this. It's quite rare and not - not one of my most affordable pieces." He hands it to Oswen.

Arcana 26. Not quite what she was thinking, but... A charm of plant *command*. Rare, needing attunement. 3 charges. Expending one casts Speak With Plants and for the spell's duration, you would find yourself better able to influence their demeanour. All charges are regained at dawn. She says, "I don't know if someone not skilled in magic arts could use it... But it could be interesting..."

Vai is sure it doesn't require innate magic aptitude. The person from who be brought it was a writer and a traveller, trying to document plants of many worlds.

"And what would be a fair price?"

Vai sighs. "I was thinking... Something like 3,000gp" (well, he quotes a local currency equivalent and we translate). "I know it is steep. But I think I overpaid for it in the first instance! But it allows a simple farmer, even a child to be able to create magic by simply connecting with it - wondrous."

Oswen is tempted. She thinks Leonidas wouldn't succumb to temptation of misuse. Her thoughts are interrupted by Kindle pushing out from behind the curtain. He looks flustered. "**I can hear her through this;** it is a blessed item. Consecrated. She told me! She told me all about its previous owner, who has apparently left now to join her. This makes me feel - less trepidatious about it! These are very personal items and I didn't want it if someone else had simply given it away; I thought it was odd that it might be parted with in the first place. They must have known their time was up."

"And they sold it to Vai here so that it could find its way to whoever might see it; this being a place that many people visit" says Inafina.

"It sounds like a sales pitch but I really do mean this piece *speaks* to you!"

"Well" says Oswen, "I think the two then."

"Oh! Really?! OK. Well that's - fantastic."

But Bel wants to negotiate! For one thing, there's Kindle's old amulet. He's happy to exchange, as Yondalla told him so - "...and perhaps this will itself find a young acolyte and lead them to Yondalla as well". Bel, Nat 20!

The two would have been 3000 and 4000gp respectively. But Kindle's amulet is nothing to be sneezed at; it's uncommon, well made and in good condition. But Kindle's connection and his story about the bearer of that amulet to Vai in the first place was interesting. "How about we call it 6000 in total?" "Deal!" - we've only *just* got that in gold between us, but at least they do accept our currency in lieu of theirs.

"And you of the lovely fur - I see you've been looking at this..." - and gives her the clockwork amulet! "Wow, thank you!" - she's quite moved by that. "Are you sure?" "Yes. I see the way you move and how respectful you are; how you look out for your friends - you're calm and methodical. This piece here is an extension of yourself in many ways."

We bid farewell and head out. "There's no doubt now" says Oswen "that I might not put my *faith* in a particular deity, relying instead on my books and so forth, but I certainly do believe in them. How could people who've seen what we've seen think otherwise?"

Kindle starts talking in a very animated way about his new amulet. It's surprising - he's almost bubbling with excitement! His old amulet was made for him as an acolyte, made out of what he stated - he expected holy things to be gold - but now it makes more sense, pottery, it's Yondalla! And so-on.

We wander on and then Kindle spots a large shop, with a tarp hung higher on tall poles, where he sees something odd. "What is that?" - a lizard-like creature is crawling up onto shelves and taking a cage down from one. Crates and cages all over, with animals in them. It's run by the lizard - who once down on the ground stands bipedally. A sort of Bel-sized skink, smartly dressed. We're spotted; they say, "You look puzzled. Have you never seen a animal stall before?" Inafina turns her head slightly to the side; "No; how does this work?" "Well you know you've been to stables before, buying horses, mules and so-on, people buy goats or other cattle; well here, you can buy other kinds of animal. Some people have a fondness for particular animals. Kept as companions, or as helpers, or just collections. This is what I specialise in. Interesting, unusual animals."

Well, as long as they're looked after...?

Her name is **Sid Squid** (!).

We ask if they have a favourite themselves. "I do - at the moment. These!" - and we're taken back inside the stall area to a thick, glass bell of kinds. Inside are small creatures of ice! Like little mice, but made of frost. "What are those?" "Frostlings! From the plane of water. Well - from one of those planes in between water and air, technically. A demiplane of frost. They're made entirely of cold, which is why I keep them in this, to protect them. Aren't they beautiful?" - they lean in and make high pitched singing sounds; the frostlings come over, noses twitching.

Oswen asks - we can't buy creatures, our line of work is too dangerous! - but is it OK to ask a question, about Wynlings. Inafina, perception 19, notes a sharp pause in the salesperson's breathing... Oswen ploughs on. She asks about food and so-on; the answers are confident but Inafina sees the woman is nervous. Oswen's not hitting the mark but the salesperson is worried Oswen might. Infina asks, "And have you sold wynlings to anyone? Do you trade in those too?" - very nervous now! "No! No of course not. Of course I wouldn't? Why?" "I wondered if they made good companions, or could be trained or similar." "No, it's illegal to trade in wynlings. They're native to these forest and protected!" - clearly very nervous.

Inafina figures we'll learn nothing by beating around the bush and she'd just be nervous and say nothing if we don't push it. So she says, "But we know there's been some strange wynling behaviour between at least three very specific stalls and we know one of those stalls might be involved, but we don't think it's with a specific ill intent, nor do we intend to do anything other than hopefully - as outsiders, as observers of sorts - defuse what is becoming a rather stressed situation with a lot of misunderstandings, while maintaining privacy..." Persuasion 17.

The body language is one of guilt... And surprisingly, that seems to tip her over the edge. So we're beckoned even deeper inside! Back of the shop.

A deep breath - "I regret it! I absolutely regret it. I did... I went on an expedition into the mountains because I had a special order for a wynling. Just one! A wild one. They said they wanted to study the behaviour and it reminded them of home. They wanted it to try and - well, convince someone that they cared about to stay and to remember what's so special about this place. And it was such a compelling argument. I must have been - I don't know - it really moved me. I agreed to do it. And I know it's wrong; we can't take wynlings from the wild! It's forbidden. They can't survive down here, there's no food; not enough flowers and there are so many in town - it'd be dangerous, they're territorial; if this wynling was found in their territory the others would mob it and chase it away! They can get nasty when territorial. We've seen it in the wild. They destroy other flowers to stop the invading wynlings getting food."

We get onto the same page; it was indeed **Kasem**, who we'd talked to behind the stall, who is trying to convince **Karem** to stay. But he's not come back for more food yet. She's worried it might be underfed too, as Kasem hasn't come back to get more food - he had one week and was given a week of supply.

"We'd better get over there then!"

"...Look, if you can find it, *please* - it must be starving - give it some food?" - she fetches a jar of nectar from an area of crates. We take it and hide it away in a backpack.

We pass time. Mystic's Alley and Seamstress Alley are shut in the evening, so we just enjoy ourselves in the centre area until we see stalls starting to pack up. We head to Spicy Brothers, and they're packing up too. We try to get into a conversation, but it's difficult. Kasem isn't really responding; he's cold. But then he mentions that "some of us can't wait to get away" - but Karem says, "family business is family! You don't need to involve others. I will see you back at the house! You have help here anyway. I'm going. See you later."

Inafina heads off with him; the three of the rest of us try to have a conversation with Kasem but he's not having it (Oswen even ADV persuasion is too low) so Bel casts Charm Person! "This is a wonderful place but very confusing and you've made my friend confused and she doesn't confuse easily! Tell my friend what in Titania's name is going on? Because we can't make sense of it!"

Turns out that for a couple of years or more, Karem has had it in his head that he wants to see the "greater world outside". Kasem is worried; how is this going to work? The families have always run the stalls, including this one. The only other way to survive in this place, without a family business, is if you're a stall licence trader - you need more than two stalls to do that though. Be managing three or more. And Kasem thinks he can't possibly run the business on his own. He'd lose the stall; wouldn't be allowed to operate it. He's been trying all kinds of ways to make Karem stay. Then he had an idea - get a pet wynling for Karem so he can't leave. They'd need to go to the forest to find flowers and fall in love with the place again... He'd got quite desperate.

But Karem knew it was manipulation. They had a fight. In the process, they forgot that it is a *wild* wynling. The window was open and it flew away. Then they tried to lure it back; that's what the nectar was about, initially though up on a high pole. But they didn't know about the territorial behaviour; it tried to come back, but got mobbed. Then the other wynlings eventually decided to destroy that pole. Seeing this, Kasem hatched a plan - his brother now being *very* over it - and figured maybe he could get two other stalls... Get them in trouble so they lose their licences. He had to involve his own stall to try and avoid suspicion.

Oswen laughs. "Families. Well, blood is thicker than water, as they say - but you *know* that's a pretty crazy plan, right? We must be able to think of another answer. Just get everyone together. The whole family. The trouble is you've tried to solve this all by yourself."

(Oswen uses Sending to let Inafina know that Karem *does* know about the wynling).

Meanwhile, Infina is heading home with Karem, who is fuming. She pretty much just lets him talk - and he unleashes. For the first half he's mostly just angry. He also know his brother has some harebrained plan! Inafina hasn't had the full story about running stalls and so-on, so she just enquires more generally about why Kasem might be so het up. Well, Karem met a traveller a couple of years ago - and over time, they have got to know each other better and better. A dashing, charming, handsome young Musteval from the Outlands. Works for some secret organisation! They have drinks and he tells him stories. "We're in love! And I'm stuck here... I want to see the world. I want to see what's out there! This is everything I have ever known. I can see everything in my world from that tower over there... It drives me crazy. I just want to see the world with him. And he's invited me."

Karem thinks Kasem is acting out because he can't have what *he* wants - he loves the seamstress in the silk store. He can't marry her. And Karem thinks she's been waiting for him to propose - but Kasem is too traditional! Stuck in beliefs about how markets run. She'd leave her family to join their family and then her family shop might shut. Because of that he's never proposed. And now they're estranged; she's lost patience; she asked if she was ever going to marry her - and he said no. A huge fight, over dinner!

We keep talking about options. Families, traditions, joining a third family to make three stalls for a license, people who want this place closed to outsiders, people who want it open. The residential street is lined with trees; the house is beautiful...

...back at Kasem we're helping out. Oswen messages Inafina again to say we're on our way and Inafina responds this time; "The two of them just need to talk with their families! And we must find the wynling." There's a heavy cart to pull which Kindle helps with, but before that, she whispers to Kindle - "I could do divination, but you seem to be on good terms with Yondalla today; perhaps she would be kind enough to help us locate the wild wynling? It must be hungry!"

He decides to cast Locate Creature via Divine Intervention. We get the cart back to the house and leave the brothers and their family to talk. We have an hour to try and find the wynling; if it's within 1000ft, he'll know where. We need to walk around. Inafina points to the tower Karem indicated; maybe we could head there? They like high places. As we get closer he suddenly detects it. "Near here... That way!" and marches off. He's pointing at the huge jacaranda trees; the flowers must be appealing. But it must be hiding, because it otherwise gets mobbed! We find the right tree; Inafina takes the nectar and climbs up. A rather feral, scared, beaten up and weak wynling trembles. ADV (due to nectar) animal handling; dirty 20. It's eating.

While this is going on Kindle (perception 22) notes company! The town wynlings are coming - three of them, flying from the high tower. Makes sense to be up there. We whisper up a warning. Inafina tries to convince the wild wynling into a satchel - safe place - with the jar. It actually holds it and puts its head in! She climbs down, but the others are getting close. Kindle decides to use his ring of shooting starts to scare them off; not intending to hit, of course. Three charges. Three motes of light. It does the trick to keep them away from the tree, after just two of the three.

"Now lets get to that stall - see if we can find the stall holder. Maybe they left a note!"

We head over. All the tarps have been lowered. It's obviously closed. The cages stay behind. We sneak inside... Inside, we see the stall holder sleeping! They live here. Well, at least the animals are looked after. That explains the size of he place. We "psst!" at her. "Someone there?!" "Just us. The wynling!" - there's the sound of a lamp being lit. Oswen also casts Light, not too bright; the animals are bothered by it.

We gesture at the satchel and the wynling, head still buried in the jar, barely coming up for air!

She finds a small cage and makes all kinds of murmuring, talking and cooing, which convinces the creature to be relaxed and it wanders into the cage, seeming quite happy. We agree to wait and guard the animals while she heads off straight away to the forest, apparently sure it's quite safe, but the animals must be watched over.

An hour later, almost to the minute, the store keeper returns. "Success I trust?" "Yes! It was very happy to be back... And I'm relieved that I can put this all behind me." "Fair enough. Well, next time you encounter two brothers with a sob story, perhaps tell them to get the whole family together and talk it through!" "Yes, it's very difficult to run this place by myself... I can't really leave it for any length of time, I even have to sleep here".

Glances exchanged. Is that too tidy...?

Well she's not from here, obviously. A minor family. The other two are proud. It could be worth a shot... Well, we're offered a place to sleep here, but we need to get back to the other family and let Karem and Kasem know about the wynling. We hike back up to the house and knock politely.

(End of Part 2.12)
