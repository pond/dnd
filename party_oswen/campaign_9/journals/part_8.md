# Oswen: Part 2.8
## Campaign day 17, Sigil day 6, Brimstone Hold
### First store room, late at night

Unable to find a way to get any messages or weapons to the prisoners, one thing led to another and we almost inadvertently have ended up recovering the book from Vrakir's quarters (where it had been hidden in a demiplane). We were almost caught. We used Dimension Door to get back to the original store room after, so Nebukath has not yet seen us exit, but will surely suspect soon - if not already - that we're up to something!

We do not have a plan for getting to the prisoners on account of the Erinyes that patrol the keep walls being able to see through illusions and invisibility - other than using Polymorph to transmute someone into a small creature like a spider or rat, that might make it inside the prison area and be able to hand out weapons there. But once inside, they'll be stuck on their own without our help and in any case, Oswen doesn't have that spell in mind right now - it'd take an hour of resting to get the magic sorted and, in that time, we're *very* likely to have Nebukath chasing after us and/or the alarm raised for myriad other reasons.

We discovered a way to open a portal in this Hold which Asmodius wants kept closed; this is in fact why the Erinyes are here; Vrakir wants to use the knowledge of how to open it as some kind of leverage. We accidentally opened the portal and Jarazoun was alerted by noises from it (which is when we were nearly caught). He spotted Bel disguised as the Cook and instructed Bel to get Nebukath, presumably believing him to be responsible; of course we didn't do that, so it won't be too long before Jarazoun goes looking himself, and/or otherwise talks to Nebukath. Both are likely to realise that shenanigans are afoot at that moment, even if they don't know the real truth of things, and each have different ideas of what is going on. We don't know and we don't think we can risk it.

Without the prisoners have no escape plan and even with them, it's shaky. We ended up burning a lot of resources to get as far as we have, which leaves us poorly placed for battle, especially against creatures like Jarazoun and certainly Nebukath.

So here we are, back in the same store room, facing the same problem, with the same lack of solutions, though we have a little bit more information and we *have* retrieved the book. As we kick ideas around, Oswen mentions that she wishes she'd thought ahead to memorise another spell that might help us, but it'd take an hour of rest for her to be able to do that. Kindle does something wonderful - his curious ability to help us rest more quickly. He prays to Yondalla; Prayer Of Healing - we all stay inside the circle for ten minutes, regaining 2d8 HP each (only Oswen is injured though) and and it's as if we had short-rested. This is very important for Oswen, as she is able to use her arcane recovery *and* swap a spell if she needs to. Bel also plays a song that helps us gain a few more hit points.

In the end, though, Oswen's indecision persists as we keep finding reasons why plans won't work. After much debate we have still got absolutely no idea how to proceed - so Bel takes matters into his own hands and simply casts Invisibility on all of us... It's his last L5. It seems like a waste, but we've thought of nothing else! Bel says he's choosing this idea, out of everything we've kicked around, as it's something he can choose to do. Oswen's perspective is different, but aligns ultimately; this is a terrible idea in many ways but it is our least worst. We can't just sit here. We can't explore anywhere else in person without Invisibility.

With that done, and Bel at the back - he's almost out of all spells now - we creep outside. Orvil has to hide away in a pocket dimension. Inafina once again leads since she has great hearing. We creep into the kitchen, then to the western wall door. Inafina can't hear anything beyond (perception 19) so she cautiously opens the door. We're doing the hand-in-hand thing since we're invisible; Inafina, Oswen, Kindle with a request to look after Bel since he's spent so much magic and then Bel.

It's a messy mess! Piles of plates are left for others to clean up. A duergar is sleeping, passed out, on the table at one of the seats. We creep past... ADV stealth all round.

* Oswen 19
* Inafina 20
* Kindle (flat roll, but he then uses his Inspiration) 23
* Bel 22

Kindle initially was walking forwards normally and almost banged against a table with a pile of plates that surely would've rattled; his inspiration is to turn sideways and walk with smaller steps, so that he's more in line with the rest of us. The dwarf does the classic "interrupted snore" thing and we freeze, but he then resumes normal snoring and we relax.

At the western door, Inafina listens; perception 22; two people talking, slowly getting closer! The room is full of tables and plates so the best she can think of is to push people back against the wall in a row, hoping that if someone walks in, they don't trip over us! In the middle of the Undercommon she doesn't understand is "Erinyes", and an annoyed sigh. The other then makes some angry remark and spits! Sounds like these guards do *not* like them.

The door knob turns and the door opens... Away from us, fortunately! Two duergar enter. There seems to be levity about the sleeping guard - then one of the new arrivals picks up a plate of half-eaten food and splats it onto the head of the sleeping one! As this goes down we use the opportunity to slip out Westwards, along the corridor from which they emerged.

Another door opens nearby; an angry voice; things go more quiet. The door behind us into the corridor is then shut. We figure someone from the room adjoining the mess hall must've joined them (barracks, if the map is right). Along the far end of the corridor is a door - but this has infernal runes written across the top. They don't look magical, at least... As Inafina leads us forward, she - out of pure hope - feels along the wall, in case there are *any* kind of extra things there that aren't on the map. Perception 25. She feels nothing out of the ordinary.

She listens at the door but perception is only 12... This one is difficult. There's something different, echoey, whooshy? It's hard to hear. Things inside are kind of muffled but outside it doesn't sound like that. But we do expect that door to perhaps look into the outdoor work area beyond. There's no real choice but to try the door, as quietly as possible.

As expected from the map, there's a short tunnel leading outside - not into the slave area, but into that "to barracks" area. We're almost exposed here. Northwards of course another tunnel leads to what should be a guard room.

Inafina thinks quickly. The two we passed looked like guards, heading to the mess room to get - well, food or drink. So perhaps (insight with Inspiration burned - 26!) - perhaps those guards were on patrol. From the guard room? Could be wrong but... What choice do we have? Right now, everything on the map is right and we're now out of safety, burned spells, right on the threshold of possible disaster. Oswen was adamant about avoiding the courtyard while invisible because that signals to the Erinyes clearly that we're up to no good.

She figures - no choice. To Oswen's slight surprise, she feels Inafina pulling North towards the guard room, but she trusts Inafina - the whole party trusts each other. At the northern door, Inafina listens; nat 20 -> 27 - nothing. She's very sure it's empty - **but!** - in the far distance, there are some footsteps echoing on stone. From behind us. She whispers, "This is empty, but those two guards I think are coming back - we have seconds... We must go in!" and we shuffle in hurriedly.

Two stools; a stone block that serves as a desk, with junk on it; a low glowing brazier, a large key on a keyring hung on the wall; quick perception check; another nat 20! 27. The brazier is strangely set back from the wall in a rather strange way. It warrants closer inspection. There is grime on most parts except the wall *behind* the brazier, which *should* be dirty. She whispers to Oswen, "There's something - wrong - with that wall behind the fire!" - Oswen investigates; as she walks forward, investigation *another* nat 20, 33! - she steps on a small pressure plate... The door slides sideways and reveals a secret passageway.

We don't hang around! We run inside and Oswen immediately sees a lever which she pulls hoping the door will close. It does, surprisingly quietly, with a click. For a moment we freeze, waiting. We all start hearing the voices getting louder; the door opens; more conversation and noise - but no change in tone. We are undiscovered.

This is not a secret, because the wall was clear. The pressure pad was easily found. This has been used before. Why?

It's pitch dark. Kindle carefully moves forward to the front - he has excellent Darkvision. So we're towed along, then asks us to feel around. "Is there another lever?" he whispers. Inafina finds it easily. Doors are meant to be opened from the inside unless you "know". Maybe on the other side, it's hard to find? Inafina listens.

A **fourth** natural 20. It's going to be nat 1s from here. She hears a mixture of voices; broken common; a variety of accents. She whispers back, "It's impossible, but I think - somehow - this is it; I can hear all sorts of people, different, common language. We should pull the lever."

Kindle pulls the lever.

A click forwards, a silent slide to the side. An East-West corridor. To the left, dim red light from outside. To the right, the sounds of voices shushing each other then, then one barks out - "What do you want?!"

Oswen says, "Bel, I think this is time for your charm, amongst other things..." - he breaks the invisibility on himself, specifically, so he can do things. "Give me the bag, Kindle". Our bag of weapons becomes visible. Oswen's heart is thumping. She can scarcely believe we're here... Bel says, "Anyone else who wants to come, come with me..." - of course, we all follow!

A prison. In the first cell, a sullen-looking ogre, alone in a corner. Other cells have more people in them. We count carefully. Just 37! Without thinking, Oswen, a bit over excited, says, "37! That's almost easy! We can definitely get everyone through a teleport circle!" - goodness knows what anyone else things. They look very surprised, but cautious. at this strange satyr. Bel asks, "Venture. Is Venture here?" - someone steps up. He recognises Bel as one of the people who arrived today; he tried to catch our attention. Why are we here?

We try to explain. In the process we of course mention Jordun. And *that* gets a lot of attention. Immediately they're asking for doors to be open! We can risk the noise from the Chime of Opening, for anything Bel struggles with via Thieves Tools - we know there is at least one key in the guard room, but we figure *that* would be noticed if missing, even if the guards left the room again and gave the opportunity to steal it.

* First door for Venture - nat 2 SOH, we use the Chime.
* Next door - *almost* gets it, but another Chime.
* Third and fourth - again he struggles.
* But by the fifth, the awkward, large locks are becoming more familiar and he opens it easily enough, avoiding embarrassment!

The ogre refuses to move. It's just sad, and won't move. Venture tries to convince them, as does Oswen; no good. "No! Toy is missing!" and Oswen says, "Yes, we heard about the toy; we haven't found it, but I'm sure we have something that might be at least as interesting and fun..." - but all Oswen really can find is the ornate hammer from Hither and a panflute. Kindle comes along, being very empathetic. He promises to find a new doll, if the ogre comes with us, but "in the mean time I'll give you something of mine which is very precious to me, and maybe it'll make you happy too" - he gives the Ogre his Rust Bag Of Tricks. "Reach in your hand and take out a fluffy ball, then place it on the ground!" The ogre tries it, after a bit more cajoling.

The fluffy ball turns into a goat!

The ogre is amazed. "A wonderful thing! Most wonderful! I can play with *this*?!" "Yes!" says Kindle; "until we can get you something else that you think is worthy, you can play with this... Well, 3 times a day, at least."

Weapons are distributed. Oswen starts talking about the plan and everyone is gung-ho, but when she gets to the main door and drawbridge, then a teleportation circle, Venture stops her. How does this work? She explains. How big is it? About 10ft diameter. At this, he simply walks back into the large cell and pushes everyone against the wall.

There's enough room. No fight... Wow. It hadn't even occurred to her!

"A wise warrior knows when a battle is not to be fought", says Venture.

The circle is almost ready; instructions are given, explanations about how to run through and how you'll be "elsewhere" (via sand being run through fingers and landing in a small pile "elsewhere").

"Are you *really* here to save us?!" asks Venture; Oswen is too choked up to speak; Bel rallies everyone. "Cast it, Oswen. We're ready!"

Oswen casts. She calls "GO!"

Everyone runs. She decides to be last. Bel hangs back too. She has to shout at Kindle "Don't delay for me! Go!"

The time runs through *so* quickly; at the last moment she runs, shoving Bel just ahead of her.



### Ruins of the old town

A pile of people. Some stand up, brandishing weapons. And then a shout. "No! It can't be! What?!"

From down the hill, below; Oswen looks - there it is. The caravan is already here. There are more shouts. "Jordan! Jordan!" - people from up here start to run down there; the caravan thinks it's under attack for a moment; it's chaotic. Oswen is at the back. She turns and casts Thunderwave! To hell with the noise.

THAT does it! Silence, people staring in amazement. She simply says, "These are your friends". It's all she can think of. Venture later pulls her into the circle to explain.

Oswen collects herself enough to explain but realises something very sad - they must leave if they can... And we must go in the opposite direction. Nebuketh will surely come to attack us; we can't draw him to them. We must draw them away, else people will die.

The ogre is distraught; Kindle has seen how much he likes the bag though (he's been hugging his new friend the goat!) so says he can keep it. The ogre hugs Kindle and then Oswen too; "Little woman, you are very big to me!"

**It's sad, to not really get to enjoy this moment, but people recognise the need. Oswen asks just one thing of them - if any of them ever have a chance to send a magical message to us once they're safe, please do so, to let us know they made it.**

Jordun gets out a pendant and looks at Venture, who nods. "This is a very precious thing for us and our people. It will identify you as a friend to the Mul and a friend to all half-giants." He hands it to Oswen. "Thank you." "I know it appears foolish for it is just leaves and flowers, but leaves and flowers are the most precious thing in the entire world, on the world I come from." "I can't imagine a world like that, but I can understand what you mean."

The pendant is on a beaded necklace of amber, with larger pieces forming the pendant centrepiece, two are leaves and one is a dropping flower, in amber. "It's beautiful", says Oswen, and puts it on. "And now, you must go. Best speed."

There are a few more brief thank yous and goodbyes; Oswen is implored to keep her robe in rembreance of them and the tailor hopes to never be anywhere near he will need it again!

The old husband and wife, Orta and Lena couple come over and the monk Orta makes a symbol with their hand, bowing to Inafina. She hasn't seen that in a long, long time and her eyes widen; she asks if he's from her world. "No, I am of the Four Elements, but I know of your people. I hope one day you can reconnect with the Source - and that you aware that the Source lives within you. You have carried it all along. I have seen it. I have something that belonged to an acolyte of mine... Someone who had lost the way. Maybe it will help you find your way back to yourself and self-awareness." He pulls out a beautiful silver belt, similar to Inafina's but a different colour. "It is made with gifts of silver scales from a dragon." "Surely this is too valuable - I cannot accept..." - but Orta interrupts; "No; it is the right thing. It will keep you centred to see through the lies of the world and trust in yourself. The power has always been within us." Inafina takes it and bows back, thanking him. "I hope your path and mine will meet again some day" says Orta.

The caravan starts to move Spirewards. We start to walk at best speed along the rim, away from the awful river of fire. It's late, we're tired, but we want to draw as much distance as we can.

We've walked for about half an hour and then... WIS save: Oswen. Only 12. She hears a message; she can't resist or push back; it is of course Nebukath. "You sneaky thieving lying wizard! You think you are so smart, escaping. It was a mistake for you to cross me. It is *definitely* a mistake to steal the slaves from Vrakir! This was your plan all along. Well. Know this. I will hunt you for the rest of your days! I will only *let* you *die* if you return what is rightfully mine. *I will find you!*"

This being a series of messages, Oswen has stopped walking and the others are concerned. When Nebukath finishes Oswen says, "OK, so Nebukath is really, *really* angry and it's not going to be good. He insists he'll hunt us forever and then *only let us die* when we give him back the book. So I'm guessing we're not having a good time before that."

Bel shrugs. "Meh. I've heard worse threats."

"Um, yes, but we're a bit - in the middle of a desert with not many spells and not a great deal of fight left in us. I'm surprised he hasn't found us already, though."

At this, Kindle tells us all to stop - he casts his magic Hut. "Everyone inside!" he commands but Oswen says, "We can't just stay in here though!" "Well not forever, but we need to rest. If he's looking for us he won't see us in it." "Is there a risk he'll go for the caravan instead?" "Well he doesn't even know to look for it - he doesn't even necessarily know people have left the village. That's why all he's done so far is angry messages!"

Kindle has a point - we scuttle inside. At last, sleep.



### Campaign day 18, Sigil day 7 - plus 7500 XP each

Waking up in the hut, Oswen checks her diary to update it and is surprised to see how few days have been counted. It feels like very much longer. We can't help but reflect on the emotional rollercoaster and the strange fortune we had. Our original plan had involved finding the slaves first, and we were sure that indecision and bad luck forced us into the book first - and yet, it was only because we had the book, that we could teleport away from within the cells, which happened to be big enough, and we just happened to find them at just the right time having avoided all the guards. In game terms, all those Nat 20s in a row... Insane.

The riot and distraction option was never needed and we didn't fight anyone. It is hard to believe.

It is perhaps almost an anticlimax. If a play were to be made of our exploits, the audience might well feel let down by the lack of grand battle. But the four of us, and 37 entirely unharmed and freed prisoners, are very happy with how things worked out.

Bel points out that we walked into Brimstone Hold and stole a book, and 37 slaves, from under their noses. "The heist of the century!" he says. Kindle points out that we also stole a bunch of weapons from the other store room.

It's not quite a full success. We never found the dragon's lair, so if there was wealth to be had, we come away with nothing - in fact, many of our resources are irrevocably spent. Further, very sadly, the souls of the slaves, at least some of them, are not their own and while they live in freedom, they are doomed ultimately to die as slaves. If ever the opportunity arises to fight Klax or the harbourmaster if we're in good enough shape, we're certainly willing to do it.

We *think* we might technically not have breached the pact with Klax, though. We never stole from *him*.

Doubtless Nebukath will try to implicate us when Vrakir finds out what's going on. Jarazoun will doubtless be in a lot of trouble as he was in charge. The dragon is dead too. What a mess. There is surely going to be some kind of fallout for us from this; we may well be distant but we can't imagine such powerful creatures will just let this go.

For now, we have breakfast, Bel playing inspiring music as we do; then we get walking again. As we walk, Bel asks about the book. Oswen things we must NOT look at it! Not even a peek. "Who are we meant to deliver it to?" asks Bel. Oh. Good question.

Oswen flips back through her notebook, then finds the information on the mission that she'd scribbled down as the illusion was playing on the Lambent Zenith. It's hard to read but she gets the name of the mission-giver and that he's probably staying in Sigil, but he seems to offer no solution for how we get there, despite giving us the circle runes to get all the way out *here*. What an oversight!

Oswen is about to try Sending when Bel reminds her that Sigil is on its own plane; it won't work. We'd need to have or know an existing circle in Sigil or know a gate location. We know that, because it's how we got out of there in the first place, but it's a long way away - another rimward town. Bel points out that if one rimward town had a gate to Sigil, maybe others do. So our best shot is to just keep walking along the circumference to see what we can find!

Oswen, burning inspiration; Survival 21. We gradually see less sand and fewer dunes. We crest a final rocky ridge eventually and look out over a scary landscape... D6->5 -> We see an almost flat, dusty, lifeless plane that has stone tors emerging out of it at irregular intervals. A totally vegetation-free world would look like this - no grass at all - perhaps this is like the half-giants' world in some way. In the distance stand a tall ring of mountains, perhaps half a day of walking away though distance is a bit hard to judge since the unusual nature of the landscape makes it harder to accurately guess at size/scale.

There's a town in the middle of the mountains, but has a curious aspect; in the modern world we'd say it looks like a massive prison. A rather brutal blocky, dusty, smoky, huge place. There is a road winding towards a low gap in the mountains that seem to have strange caravan-like travellers. Large beasts pull carts with cages. There is a sort of portcullis at the main entrance. Even the tops of the walls have metal curving inwards, as if making a cage top.

History 8; Oswen has no idea what this is. Doesn't look at all friendly - but we don't feel we have that much choice. It might be a long, long walk to the next town and we'd certainly need a big detour around those mountains to even try to go elsewhere. We head onwards, towards the road.

Closer, we see the beasts of burden are huge and somewhat malformed, with burnt-looking red, thick hide and sharp spikes. They pull wheeled cages with drivers in the front with barbed whips and guards sitting on the back. Inside we see, from cage to cage, various humanoid creatures; again, it really feels like this is a prison transport.

Oswen, Religion 22. The beasts are in fact Fiends - the driver and the guards, too. Demons? No, they remind her more of Devils. Too orderly in physical appearance. Plus, there is clearly an imprisonment or punishment thing going on here which aligns more with devil philosophy too, and less with the chaos of demons. She is suddenly reminded suddenly of one of the lower, outer planes, regarded as prison plane, Carceri. A hell plane. Embodies simply imprisonment and punishment. It's used as a standard scare story to put people off crime (!) but looking at *this* place, and given what we've seen the last few days, it's probably real, even if this isn't it. Perhaps this is the gate town to that plane. This would make it very dangerous!

It's not the kind of place that a good-aligned creature just kind of walks up, asks for help and gets it.

The Sigil gate last time was outside the town. Hopefully a gate likewise here would be outside too. But how can we find it? We'd have to be very careful; the devils would be sly, cunning, lawful yes, but evil. We might be easily tricked into accidentally breaking some law, however minor and that would be all the excuse needed to lock us up.

As we discuss it, we suddenly realise something. We *are* criminals. By the standards of the Hold, we stole the slaves and some weapons. Could news reach here? Might they just "know" if you are a criminal by some standard or law? Do we risk that, for sake of a longer walk?

We figure our best bet is to try to find a gate, or at least get to where we know. We teleported here, so we're unfamiliar with it. Oswen, INT-based Survival only 15. She's *some* idea of what direction we might go to at least *try* to get to a "good" or neutral plane. Where we are, is high risk. Kindle reminds us that he can magically create both water *and* food, which will be basic but serviceable, so while we might be wasting time, we can travel essentially indefinitely on food. Bel has spices too, heh.

"What about Sending?" asks Inafina. "You've done that before?"

Oswen thinks. "It doesn't work across planes. But I might be able to add a bit to the spell which gives it a chance. I've seen all sorts of new runes and approaches since we got to Sigil and beyond... I hadn't even thought about trying until you asked. It could still fail though - but I guess it's worth a try."

"Who would you message?" asks Inafina.

"The most powerful person we know I guess! Morden Kainen. Oh! Sorry. I mean 'Mordenkainen'. That'll take some adjustment... I was so used to thinking in terms of my limited perspective on names."

She gives it a go. "Lost in outlands with valuable item. Need route to sigil. We are near an evil but apparently lawful prison land." (D20->18; the message succeeds - 2024 rules). Persuasion is only 14 though.

There's a pause that almost takes it beyond response time, but at the last moment; "All right. Do you have a means to comprehend runes sent to you by arcane language?"

She has to cast again to respond; "I can understand spoken or signed language, or written language if I can touch it". D20->7, that works. "Very well. There are 25 runes you must decipher! Make sure you can write them down. Message when ready. DO NOT lose it!"

Oswen gets her notebook ready, on the pages where she's drawn teleportation circles before since it sounds like that's what we'll get. Then she messages; simply, "Ready". Nat 1! It does't work and that's her last spell! She looks embarrassed and has to Upcast. A L4 spell for a single word! D20->11, it works.

25 strange arcane runes come in. She draws them hastily as best she can; it's a struggle to get them done in time and the last few are done purely by memory. At least she can understand the pictogram form as these are arcane runes, words of power, so the basic structure is familiar. That done, she stops to examine her scribble! Aracana 29 - success; it's just a sequence. Further, Arcana 24, it is indeed a teleportation circle. With that in mind, she's able to redraw some of the more malformed copies.

Something is nagging her about it, though, and she tries to cast; but it doesn't work! She looks confused. Aracana 18. She isn't sure but *suspects* it's a different plane. That's not very helpful. Seems we're stuck. Mordenkainen didn't realise she couldn't move between planes like that.

Surprisingly, Bel then messages - "Mister Mordenkainen! Surely there is some kind of mistake. That did not work. Oswen wonders if you forgot we were on a different plane?"

After a while he's heard a response and tells Oswen she should've used Planeshift. Oswen replies, "Perhaps in in a few years from now, if I study hard, I might be powerful enough to do that."

Bel once again messages and explains (at which Oswen is starting to feel a bit sorry for Mordenkainen!) - "he says he can send another circle for a location near Ecstasy". So Owen upcasts another Sending; "Terribly sorry for all the trouble, I'm just not that powerful a wizard yet. New circle sounds great. Thank you."

Another blizzard of hastily-scribbled runes. Arcana 1, Halfling reroll, 20! Total 33. Her first-time drawing is good enough this time and it helps that she knew it was a teleportation circle, but she almost stumbled as he started the sequence in place she normally wouldn't consider the beginning. Then she *receives* a Message; "That takes you to the Flowering Hills. Only a couple of days to portal" - he goes on to describe it and how to activate it (sing a joyous song while wearing flowers in your hair!)

Oswen asks the group - "Which do you prefer, a flowering meadow or this kinda wasteland vibe with lots of prisoners?"

Funnily enough it's unanimous! She casts the circle - we move a distance from the road and behind a large boulder first, and none of the cage carriages on the road have paid any attention to us this whole time anyway - and everyone steps in.



### Flowering meadow near Ecstasy

We appear in a strange meadow that seems man-made; that is, there are geometric patterns of flowers which seem to be planted out. Around us there are tulips; elsewhere, other flowers. Inafina (perception 24) mostly just hears wind in the fields. Little else. No rumbling or crackling, an absence of metal chains but also an absence of dead silence of a lifeless sandy landscape. It smells good.

It looks like there are various pathways in the rolling hills, so we try to get to pathway without damaging any flowers and then get to a vantage point from there. There are cute, mossy "hill homes"! Small groups of farmers are tending to the flowers near there. They might be halflings; they look over and wave. From here we see a hill criss-crossed by paths lined with fruit trees that are being harvested.

Oswen remarks that it's such a contrast it's almost hard to trust this as real and not some kind of trick!

We head down to the farmers that had waived. They walk our way and we meet in the middle. One has a small goat, pulling a cart; we're asked if we want an orange?! We thank them. "Welcome to flowering hills! This is the home of Sheela; are you a worshipper of Sheela yourself?" Kindle says, "No, but we are kin; I am a follower of Yondalla, Sheela's sister". "Ah! You're always welcome here as is everyone."

The rest of us learn - Sheela looks after things that grow; Yondalla looks after those at the hearth.

We're even invited to a feast in a couple of hours! Well... Some downtime might be good. There's a large circular hall with a thatched roof a distance away. It'll be there.

We rest. Bel plays music; Kindle cheers up and offers to help with a large oven they have. Oswen recovers her L5 slot too. More and more food is arriving; as are flowers, which are checked, put into small boxes and put onto cards headed to Trade Gate after the feast.

At the feast, we tell a short version of our story. For their part, they just farm and make food. It's an idyl of sorts; almost an afterlife. Almost everyone is a halfling. Despite herself and her young age, Oswen finds herself thinking that this might not be a bad place to retire!

Bel asks how they first set this place up. They say Sheela invited them. They are descendants, with many others who have joined over the many, many years from all over. 

Once food finishes and we're all caught up with each other, we'll be shown the best way from here to Ecstasy without trampling through planted meadows! It's not far, and once clear of the hills, we just go with the spire to our back. "One or two sleeps", depending on how fast we are.

As we start to leave, we're handed a big bag of fruit. We thank them sincerely. There are waves and goodbyes. It feels surreal; Inafina comments, "I wouldn't have minded just staying there" and the rest of us feel the same.

Off we go. Sometimes we can see Ecstasy in the distance from viewpoints up high, then we drop down. The air smells sweet. Trees are full of fruit. We have no idea what the seasonal cycle is here - some of this reminds us of spring - mostly the flowers, some of summer - the sky and the breeze in particular, some of autumn - fruits and some of the berries. Paths are pretty, to say the least; picturesque at times. Deer, rabbit, occasionally a fox sometimes peer at us with curiosity from a distance. Once again, it is reminds Oswen of the fey a bit, but rather more "down to earth" in creatures and scale of flora.

The sky changes orange, to pink; what passes for night in this strange domain looks to be happening. We ask Kindle if we set up the hut. He asks us about a few options for places to do it; we go for under some trees, just off the road. We figure camping out would be nice but we don't know how hard Nebukath is searching for us and being "unscry-able" overnight seems like a prudent safety measure.

We decide to set up Watch:

* Oswen 21 (nat 20!)
* Inafina 18
* Kindle 20
* Bel 19

We're certainly alert and onto it, but (as we compare notes in the morning) we each felt calm and unthreatened. Many animals would pass by and be curious about the strange dome (not being able to see the people inside), but there were no threats.



## Campaign day 18, Sigil day 7, on the way to Ecstasy

We wake up to Bel boiling water for tea. Once breakfast is done, we get back on the trail.

Survival - Oswen (that nat 20 spent sadly just for perception last night!) 10+5 -> 15, which isn't bad. Suddenly... WIS save. Only 16. She starts feeling a bit dizzy; dazed; Bel, mid-conversation with her, suddenly starts asking her if she's OK. It sounds muffled and distant to her. "I feel - strange. It sounds muffled. Like I'm underwater - maybe... Charm...?" is all she can manage. Bel is understandably alarmed and reacts instinctively with a Countercharm, and she can re-save with ADV; this time, 21. Kindle also casts Protection From Evil And Good as Bel is warning the others that something's trying to "get" to Oswen.

At the Countercharm, Oswen starts hearing more clearly. It's like a sound of howls and shrieks as she "swims up", a grasping hand pulling at her; her hand is sliding into the Bag Of Holding **where the book is held**.

She freezes and points out to everyone else what she's doing. "I've stopped myself, but - something was making me do that. *And I don't know if or when it might try to get any of us to do it again.* I think we should hurry back to Sigil."

Her hair and robes are wet. For a minute she's even more alarmed and says, "woah, I really *was* underwater!" but Kindle looks a bit sheepish - he poured holy water on her during his spell!

There are many ways that this could've been done but we don't know what's what. Could be Nebukath, could be the book itself, could be anything!

We hurry on. Bel insists that Oswen hold his hand while they walk so he has more warning if she's "going under" again. Occasionally, Bel throws out some Bardic Inspiritation.

About 10 minutes later, Kindle's spell is fading. Another tug! Oswen calls out this time - WIS save; needs Bardic to get past the high DC. 23. Turns out she never did call out, just thought she did, but Bel noticed straight away that she was being influenced. This time, Oswen had enough time to notice a voice speaking; one she hasn't heard before; "You can save everyone. You can save your precious Leonidas. You just need to be more powerful. I can show you where and how to get this power. I can make you strong enough. Don't you want?"

Oswen makes a guess; "it *might* be Vecna, but I don't know why he'd be watching and trying to do that. So it must be the book! But it's in a demiplane. It must be extraordinarily powerful. And I'm only *just* managing to hold it off."

Our urgency is only increased. Kindle offers to carry the satchel - his fey nature helps him resist charms. The three of us would struggle to overpower him if he listened to the book's persuasive words, but it's a worthy risk. We break into a run.

(An hour later or so... Kindle ADV WIS save 25) "Oh! It *does* walk to you!" he exclaims.

Oswen, Survival 20 (again!) + 5 -> 25 and she's *sure* she sees where the portal should be. It looks like an empty space. We run over, with flowers in our hair and Bel leads a singalong... Very strange.

Just like that, we appear in Sigil.



### Sigil

It's an alleyway, near abandoned hoardings that look like they were once for a carnival. "If I were a bird I could help" says Orvil, rather pointedly, still a small spider on Oswen's shoulder.

Looking around, we find we're not far from Tea Street Transit. Hey, we know them; we could ask for a ride to the address Farn Bindlebrot gave us in the "hologram" message inside the pocket watch back when we first got this crazy latest mission. We head into the transit office. It's huge, like a main interchange; the best we can think of is to ask after Alden. Surprisingly we're pointed to the "violet blooms", and they point; it seems that this 'station' is divided into different-named areas and that's where he is. He's just finished a shift and is sat, having a cup of tea.

We ask if he knows anything about the address. It's near the Hall of Records he says, and he's happy to take us there. So, once his break is over we follow him to the carriage - and off we go! More smalltalk. He's not heard anything about Oerth, but "news around these parts has been about the Tower Sourcerous!" - he points back towards the Tea Street Transit building to a huge, spiny tower, with no doors or windows except for about 8 balconies that jut out. The surface is strange - it looks almost like black, flowing oil, but doesn't visibly move. As Oswen continues to look, she gets a strange sense; almost a magical weakness, draining her. She looks away. "Who are *they?!*" Alden answers, "Well apparently they were banished and people say they were sent to the mazes by the Lady Of Pain but they've returned. It's unfortunate - some families had moved into that area; nobody knows what happened to them since the tower re-appeared".

Oswen now remembers Fell telling us about this. The tower appeared some year ago or so, but apparently it's their activity now that is making the news again. They're paying *huge* sums for even simple magical items, allegedly; Alden shows us a flyer advertising their "services". We might be tempted but we've got the impression that the Incantarium are not to be trusted - they surely only have their own agenda in mind. Yet Fell had opined that if they were here, it must be at the Lady Of Pain's behest and perhaps, then, things were so grave that she wanted their help? In that case, paying them a visit might be interesting - if risky.

We reach the address (8sp cost) and Alden says he'll wait, pulling out a book. We knock and a housekeeper welcomes inside. We end up waiting in a side room. Some of the conversation has been odd; as if coded language. A while later we're greeted by the same person who takes us to Farn's study but, outside at the door, is a cabinet. "All subdimensional objects must be left here!" says a sign. We ask what that means! It means things like bags of holding... It doesn't seem like a good idea to leave that out here. We have to split up. Kindle waits outside. Oswen leaves Orvil on his shoulder to contact her if there's trouble.

The housekeeper rings a bell; a light comes on above the door; and she opens it. It's clearly some sort of demiplane as the room beyond is far larger and taller than anything else we've seen in this place. It's a kind of grand library. We head inside.

A gnome is walking down from one of the levels above. "Goodday! I am Farn. And you are...?" We introduce ourselves, Oswen shows the pocket watch and explains how we know his name and location. "But how have I never met you before?" he asks - Inafina sees that he is suspicious. She says, "Well, we're new here. We've never been to Tori before and we're new to the Golden Vault." Bel chimes in with some unnecessary but harmless white lies to bolster the story! Persuasion - FFS, double nat 20! 22 total.

Farn visibly relaxes. It helps that we recount specific bits of the message, so he figures we surely must've seen it. He's a little taken aback when he learns that we have the book with us right now, but where else could we take it? He becomes thoughtful and quiet for a while.

Oswen mentions that the book "spoke" to her and - oh my, it could be doing that to Kindle right now! - so he should hurry. Farn fetches a small vault. We go outside to greet Kindle. We need to find a way to transfer the book without being seen. Kindle uses his hut, as a spell, in a room off the main corridor that has space for it. We go inside the hut and Farn unlocks the small vault. It's lined with lead (he's strong for his!) and covered in runes. "Once it's in here and sealed, I will not be able to unseal it". "That's for the best!" "We'll need to get it to a safe storage location, but I can handle that. I have someone else lined up."

Then he asks, "Who amongst you has the most mental fortitude and dexterity?" We all agree that Inafina is probably the best at that for overall combination. Oswen points out that she wrapped the book in an item of clothing just in case. We'll just transfer the book, wrapped as-is, into the vault - but she mustn't disturb the runes. Aided by some inspiring words from Bel, Inafina reaches into the bag and grabs the book.

WIS save - *another* (huh?!) nat 20 + 3 -> 23. Now the DEX part. SOH another lucky roll - 17+5 -> 22. She slides the book out of the bag and straight into the safe without touching the sides of either. Farn slams the vault shut and it magically seals itself.

Done!

"I can't believe we've finally go it!" he says. "It's safe for you to leave your portable hole and bag of holding in the cabinet... Come into my study."

So we all follow back into the giant library and one of the first things Oswen says is, "Your arcanaloth informant was called Nebukath and wanted to steal back the book for himself over our dead bodies." "We always suspected that would be the case!" "Well next time, a bit of warning would help. He's still searching for us. Is there anything we can do to protect ourselves?" Farn's answer is indirect. "Well there is the matter of payment; I'm authorised to give you an item from our collection as payment."

Up on the library's fourth floor is a huge display cabinet. "Perhaps you don't realise how important it is, but you may very well have just secured us a piece that is crucial to us even having a chance against Vecna. There are others, many, all working on different parts of this puzzle towards this great goal. Mordenkainen - who I believe you've met? - is part of a network of some of the greatest minds who have retained their sanity, working to oppose Venca; to work out what is required to undo this 'checkmate' situation he has engineered. The book is very, very important. It's going to be used as part of the plan" - Oswen interrupts, "Wait, *WHAT?*" - "...yes. There are two other items. They must all be brought together. That is the part of the plan that we've been tasked with; securing these items that could weaken Vecna so that others may be able to strike at him. Others still are part of a plan to obtain the means by which to destroy the items *we* have found. We must use them to weaken them, and" - Oswen interrupts again, "They'll be destroyed?" - "yes, but only if those teams succeed. Each has only a slim chance of success. But together, there is a slim chance of defeating him."

Comfortingly, Farn opines that things will get worse before they get better. "But we have to believe that we can turn back this tide."

He unlocks the cabinet. "Maybe one of these items can help you. I am hoping that you will feel up to the task of continuing with us?"

Oswen doesn't look at the items and says, "Do any of those help with either one of two things - stopping Nebukath finding all four of us; or somehow freeing an innocent soul that has been bound to a devil?"

* The only way to *stop* Nebukath would be encounter him *in* the Nine Hells and destroy him there. Otherwise anything we do is only a temporary reprieve. We could come to an agreement or arrangement with him somehow.

* We could negotiate for soul contracts. Find the superior Devil to whom Klax (who we mentioned) is bound and come to an agreement or arrangement with _them_, to which Klax by extension would also be bound.

He has an item which can get us into the Nine Hells, so we could negotiate either of those outcomes! But we'd need "the right protections" to survive there. Most Devils are in the Nine Hells he says, so chances are, whoever Klax answers to would be there and not on any other plane. **But we don't know to whom Klax answers**.

Farn does confirm that Oerth has been "closed" when we ask and there is a "lot of activity" on Toril. Many of "our units have been sent there". Apparently with some urgency. He asks if Oswen wishes to visit? Fran gestures to the cabinet. "I was going to ask you which of these you would like... But I think it's pretty clear which one you need!" - he fetches a beautiful amulet with a large disc engraved upon some kind of strange, astral stone. "Would this do as our token of thanks - our payment?" - Oswen, arcana 19. An Amulet of the Planes, she thinks. *Very* powerful. It unlocks planar travel, but it does need attunement.

There's a risk it would fail and failure would be Bad. We're also not sure how much we'll need to travel. But it can move us as often as we want per day, within the risk; and we could get away from almost anywhere if we were in dire trouble; and even reach the Nine Hells. There's also...

* The Hat of Many Spells; cast spells you do not know with some chance of success
* The Belt of Giant Strength; that one speaks for itself
* A Vorpal Longsword; good against Tiamat...
* The Rod of Absorption; useful, but limited lifespan
* The Robe of Stars; a curious item, with more general use...

...but nothing close to the power of this amulet. Seems like an extraordinary deal. We accept.

"So... What's next?!" says Oswen. Farn asks if we have a key for our "new mission" watch. We do, and Farn asks us to hand it over. He gives us a new one. Apparently, it's for his specific unit. Seems we're staying off-world for a while longer. Well, quid pro quo; we *are* the group he's just given the amulet to.

"You'll also need this". Farn goes and fetches a rather large book. "The Tome of The Multiverse". It's huge, 2ft x 3ft! It'll go in the Portable Hole. She'll need Kindle's help whenever she wants to read some of it.

We bid goodbye and leave. Walking down the white staircase in front of the house, we still see Alden. "I can't tell if you had good news or bad news!" - while we could just portal away elsewhere, to Toril or similar, Oswen asks for the Grease Pit. She thinks a convo with Fell might be interesting. Alden says he's going there too and won't charge for the ride. We get there and he points out a bar where he'll be spending most of the night. He also recommends a particular stall selling things that appear to be wrapped in banana leaves.

He heads away and we try his recommendation. Chestnuts and small pieces of goat meat and so-on; it's certainly good. Oswen spies some charcoal that she can use to change Orvil back to his comfortable sense and the stallholder is happy to provide. "Not long now, Orvil" she promises.

We find a corner near lots of other fire and smoke (!) and she uses her Spellbook to fast-cast Find Familiar. What should take an hour takes a matter of seconds - the incense and charcoal practically evaporate into smoke. Orvil turns back to his bird form, which he's used to and says he preferred.

Next up, Fell. We head over and ask inside if he's available, or busy with customers. He's with a customer, unsurprisingly, so we wait. It's not long until a male human with tied-back long black hair and caramel-coloured skin comes out. Pleasantries are exchanged and they head out. Fell floats over to us, looking surprised and happy. Oswen's getting used to Fell's visual language; Arcana 23; he went to look for us a few days ago but we weren't in the room. We say we're happy to tell the story, and interested if he has any news that may be related.

To our surprise he promptly closes the shop, calls us into the back room and makes a new pot of sweet tea.

We tell our story. Bel notices that we've been rewarded for our second mission with the book, but not for the rod.

News is that Vecna is moving against "the plane of the elves". "What plane is that?"

"**Toril**. Lots of activity! People think it's imminent. Things are coming to a head. They must be gearing up for something."

Oswen looks to the party and says, "It's selfish - but could we go, like - fairly soon?!" - they nod. They all have friends in Ordulin now. Kindle's very worried about his squirrel too! She thanks Fell for telling us about it.

Also a rising tide with the Incantarum. Their tower grows. They've gained a lot of favour with the residents because of the wealth they're generating. People are being given a lot of gold, then spending it nearby. He doesn't know where all the gold comes from - he thinks they're in deep with the Bank! Fell thinks that it is unlikely it would be borrowed, too. **The Bank does not lend easily. If we had an account there, maybe we could find out more... He's always interested to hear from people who might have some clue where the wealth might have come from.** "They're allegedly paying a LOT of money for magic items." What's more, these amazing, carefully-crafted items, some of them taking years to be made, are just being destroyed. All that destruction, just to extract the magical power; but for what? Fell does not trust them.

Oswen's curiosity is aroused and she opines that, perhaps, our group might investigate. We've done investigations before - not that we're great at anything much, but we don't like fighting and we've successfully investigated before.

They're dangerous, we are warned. Nobody knows how they've managed to come back. Did they negotiate something? "No-one speaks to the Lady Of Pain and lives!" - he doesn't know what they plan; their end-game.

We also learn that surprisingly little is known about Vecna, except *perhaps* to the Lady Of Pain. Going to Oerth would be a good way to learn more. It's closed to Sigil, but not closed from other planes.

Oswen - Devil's advocate - So why worry? Yes, mortal beings die but it all gets reset. Vecna's actions come to nothing. The Lady of Pain is infallible and will endure regardless. When Oswen suggests that Vecna waited until now to retry because he's got something new up his sleeve, Fell doesn't believe it is possible. Insight from Inafina - she created beings such as Fell; she must be infallible; he can't even entertain the possibility that she might be wrong. He seems *unable* to make the connection, in fact, which is very surprising given how intelligent he is.

Oswen says, well, at least - we'd rather *not* all die, but if do! - at least technically "all" is not lost. Isolation of Sigil for millennia, intervention by the Lady Of Pain and so-on yes, but all that ultimately causing the re-seeding of the planes and life continues in a new form.

(But in the back of her mind - Vecna *has* a plan. And shady stuff like that tower just reek of some kind of bad connection! But it could all be a red herring; just because it's dark and evil and scary looking doesn't mean it has any alignment to Vecna at all).

We wrap up and head out. As usual, we have many ideas and theories but no answers - yet.

On the matter of Toril, there is discussion about what we even tell people. We don't want to cause panic. Eventually we elect to give people close to us the option. We can't bring many but we can bring some to the Fey Wild where they'll at least be a bit safer if things go badly wrong. They can stay at the Keep.

We'll have to leave Sigil to be able to use the amulet. The only place we know of with a walkable gateway out are the doors to Ecstasy and recent one, a day or so from the flower fields. The latter didn't have intelligent rats guarding the basement, so maybe that's the play! The old carnival, near Tea Street Transit HQ. We know Alden's in the bar but it seems a bit rough to just get him to take us, on the other hand he might be offended if we use someone else, so we elect to go to that bar and do a bit more thinking over one drink.

Alden is people-watching from the balcony, drinking by himself. We offer to buy him a drink. He likes a fermented sugar-cane drink of some kind, so we head to the bar and order one of those and... Well, the range is almost bewildering. Oswen wants to try the sugar cane too. There's some strange glittering wine "distilled from the waters of Mount Celestia!" - Inafina's not convinced and is pretty sure it's a tourist play, but she tries it. Bel - an elven wine; Kindle - a fruit brandy. 2gp all-in.

We catch up and chat. He was actually *hoping* - he claims! - that we'd come back for a ride since he has to take the carriage back to the Transit hub anyway.

He talks over drinks about life. Bringing people from place to place, making things possible, a small piece of a larger machine but every piece is important. "People don't notice the little, wee us down here! But all of us wee folk still matter." He raises a toast. "To us wee folk!" - we all drink.

A while later, we're at Tea Street Transit. It's a more wild ride than usual - lots of sugar for Alden! 8sp. "I wish you a good night, whatever excitements the cloak of darkness brings you!" - and bows. We wave goodbye.

So, once again, we're about to go through the door - but - we realise we don't know the secret way to get it open from this side! Bel is keen to ask Mordenkainen... Then we can get our reward... OK, fine. It's not a long walk.

We trudge over to Mordenkainen's place. As we approach the door Oswen says, "I dunno, maybe we'll try to bribe the brainy rat creatures again and go that way!" - and before she even knocks a face appears in a side window and the door opens. "Good to see you! Come in!" - MK eyes the street warily. We hurry inside; his paranoia seems unreduced! He looks like he hasn't slept in a long time. Wild-eyed and excitable. Oswen apologises for the flurry of messages and thanks him for the final sequence. Turns out he was worried about us, as he thought we'd come right back to him.

We start explaining but he's very distracted. In the end we ask if he's OK - can we help?! "Yes!" - and he rushes off upstairs, beckoning us to follow. He shows us a crystal ball, like the one we acquired himself. Turns out he's been spending unwise amounts of time with it. "I think everything is coming to a head on Toril! That's your world? Yes! Look, so many threads. These! Look!" - he points to some people wandering through streets in a city. "I can't tell if they're good or bad or misguided? I usually have a knack for it but on Toril there are so many forces at work - I can't work out what is going on. It's strange. A bit of mess. I can't tell which are the good and which are the bad! Anyway... We have some operatives there." He flips through a notebook. "Yes! Apparently, Toril falls next."

He seems to have an academic interest, but somewhat horrified with it all, so not "inhuman" or too distanced.

Eventually he notices that Bel is looking impatient... Then says, "Oh, of course! Did I offer you a reward? I suppose I must have. What did I offer you?!" asks Mordenkainen.

Bel tries to kinda white lie about it, but Oswen helps; she knows it's not really true, but anything we get *from* the Golden Vault is to be used in service *of* the Golden Vault and, frankly, they could've been a lot more helpful in even telling us their suspicions about Nebukath. Consider it danger money! So she goes along. This gives an ADV Deception role of 28, at which, Mordenkainen gives us a small bag of gems. We could get a fair price from Trade Gate, or we can get a set market value from the Bank.

"We were just thinking of opening an account..." says Oswen. That's our excuse to go.

Our last thing to do is ask if Mordenkainen remembers how to get through the Gate at the old carnival end. It's useful to have as many as we can. He gets an invisible servant who brings various books. Turns out the gate there is for maypole celebrations in a small clearing.

**"You go to the carnival when it is closed and go to the theatre where they do the puppet show, then say these lines from the show - then walk through the curtains. That'll get you back out to the Outlands."** - "What have you got in there bucket?" (huh? as in, 'that there' bucket, colloquially?)

We head out.

Once we get back where we'd originally appeared - which was in an alley, not on a stage - via investigation 15+13->28 Oswen finds old curtain rail and pair of ratty, mostly rotten curtains. The magic seems tied to what's left of the curtain or its entrance and evidently still works in *one* direction, so, we say the line and try to walk through what's left of the curtain gap.

The first time it doesn't work. Kindle has to hold the rail up high to walk underneath. We appear in a field; the clearing we saw before.

"No time to waste by the sounds of it - though, we no idea how time really passes..."

We decide we'll go to the cottage. Shouldn't surprise anyone and we don't know what time it is there anyway. So - here we go. She's had enough time thinking about it during drinks to attune... All she does is concentrate on the "sense" of the presence of the amulet and nothing happens, until the says out loud, "Just outside our pumpkin farm cottage on Toril" - and it seems the act of speaking is enough to make the connection. Arcana 22.



### Cottage near Ordulin, on Toril, day unknown

There's a loud pop! It makes our ears hurt. It's as if we blinked, and when we'd finished blinking, the world was different. There is almost a memory of a bright flash of light from the amulet but Oswen suspects that flash, if visible to anyone else, was at our point of departure. What others might see, and what others see, would be different.

It's a bit windy briefly, because we seem to have displaced the air - which Oswen notes is not usually the case with a traditional teleport, where there's actually a "path" opened between two places and you walk through - but we're in the right place!

The squirrel comes running out holding a key. Kindle is overjoyed. The squirrel climbs into his hand.

Oswen asks Kindle to ask the squirrel what time it is. "I can't actually speak squirrel..." he confesses! Well, she looks up. It's daytime. Overcast. Windy. It's not so cloudy that she can't easily see the brighter area of what should be the sun, almost overhead. "Don't know what day of the calendar, but we're kind of in the middle of the day. So, let's just check the shutters on the cottage are OK.

In the end it takes a little longer. We restock our packs a bit. Anything Bel finds dear he takes - and after a while Oswen realises with a bit of shock that he's preparing to not come back; it's sunk in for him that this plane might be... Going. She doesn't say anything, but it's a reality check, if a somewhat cruel one. She makes sure she has everything she needs too.

The cottage dusted a bit and aired out, with Kindle still trying to make things look nice - a creature of habit - we eventually double-check, we have everything, we lock up - maybe for the last time - and start to walk on the road to Ordulin. But we've barely a step into it and Kindle stops suddenly.

**"We're - not coming back, are we....?"**

**Four hearts break in unison.** All Oswen can manage to say is, "Well I mean, we hope to - but - " - and she can't finish.

Kindle goes to the shed, gets some of the pumpkin oil he'd made, then fetches the squirrel and puts it into his pocket.

We set off towards town.

As we walk, Oswen still doesn't really know *how* to tell Leonidas or her friends about what's coming or how to suggest they take shelter, since it would seem inevitable that each friend would want their own families and friends and so-on to come with them. It's only natural.

It is still winter. Much time has passed in this domain. Initially calm weather gives way to snow soon, it seems, as distant clouds can be seen with snow falling and sweeping the landscape; soon enough, we are snowed upon. It's light. Cloaks are drawn close.

At Ordulin, the snow gets a bit heavier. It's early evening, we think. Shop keepers are pulling in things from the show. People shelter. Children start to run and jump in puddles of meltwater, as it's not actually all that cold and the snow is melting as it hits the ground. City life.

Oswen says, "How? How can we tell anyone? Should - should we even tell Leonidas? How can I be the one to decide?"

Kindle says, "It's more that we are able to save someone. Should we not save anyone, because we can't save everyone?"

Oswen nods, and we keep headed towards the library, hoping he's still there. More and more of the houses show smoke from chimneys. Glows from windows. Some stalls are still open but, as we arrive, the library is shutting - it's 4:30pm winter closing, so it must be around about that time of day. Oswen spots an ex-colleague - the young woman **Sona** - seeing someone out; Oswen waves and shouts as a greeting.

"You're back!"

"Just a flying visit."

"Come in! We have the fire going and there's hot cocoa! We're just closing up... Hmm, actually I'll meet you at the side door."

The main door is closed and locked; we head to a courtyard side door. Three people emerge - handyman **Mavrik**, **Sona** and - **Leonidas**. Oswen can't help but smile. They hug. We head inside, hanging cloaks on pegs.

**It's so strange. One second desert and magma in a bizarre, alien landscape; the next, winter at home.**

Inside, there are the usual questions. Oswen gets into a sanitised version of the story about the rod, then the book, but gradually she draws it out, almost rambles, getting quieter, looking down at the table... Should she tell them... Then she confesses. About Vecna. About Toril being next. There's no stopping it. **Jayleen** walks in some way through, seeing a bad mood and offering cocoa, so even worse, Oswen has to kind of repeat some of it!

She tries to explain that there's a place some of us can go, but Sona runs outside, and Oswen has to give chase. Oswen tries to talk Sona down as best she can, acknowledging the lack of information, the shock of it... And that turns a conversation to - how do we start a world again?

"We need to tell the Head Archivist. He'll know what do" insists Sona and, under the circumstances, Oswen feels obliged to agree. And so, our strange and confused group marches off to find the Head Archivist!

Archivist **Walton** is still sat at his desk, apparently working late. We greet him and there are brief pleasantries before we have to almost force the conversation to talk about "something very serious" as Sona puts it. So Oswen has to retell the tale, with all the usual apologies.

"A bit of a boogeyman's tale!" he says. He seems level-headed but perhaps simply doesn't believe it. He asks if her information is credible; she's forced to name-drop Mordenkainen; but it's her amulet of the planes that suddenly catches his attention. He studies it a time, with her permission.

He asks how many it can take - 8 plus her. But we do have other ways to the Fey. But the Fey isn't always safe! That's why we figured we'd go to our keep... Food, water, safety.

He thinks a while. "One thing is for sure. We would need to rebuild. The most important thing for civilisation is knowledge. Will you be able to take the five of us?"

Oswen says, "The keep can certainly comfortably accommodate five."

"Will *you* be able to take a few chests worth of our most important books? If this world falls, we will need this knowledge to rebuild!"

Oswen says, "I should remind you again that I do not understand the exact nature of Vecna's conquest, but, I do believe what you say is prudent in light of that unknown, even if it proves ultimately unnecessary."

The Archivist talks of many topics of knowledge. "If we each bring two chests that we each think are important, we should have what we need to rebuild civilisation - things learned over thousands of years that must not be forgotten. Philosophy, history, poetry, the sciences..."

He gets down onto one knee, to look her straight in the eye. "Will you help save the heart of the library?"

Oswen says, "The issue is not a lack of willing. I am more than happy to do that. But" - she gestures to the others - "the issue is one of people. How many we can take. A person's family, their family's friends, the friends' families..."

But the Archivist interrupts. "We are like a unit. We don't know if what you say will happen will actually come to be, or happen in a day, a month, or several months. Pulling people out of their daily lives would be obviously difficult! But here, at the library, we have always operated as a unit. We can pack everything and go, knowing that we carry on our work whether it's there or here. Whether this cataclysm happens tomorrow, next week, next year or not at all. We are not questioning what's going on. We don't need that certainty. **We believe you** and our mission is to protect all that knowledge."

Oswen figures this is an "out". And she can entrust the Archivist with the mushroom circle knowledge for him to consider whether or not he risks telling others.

"We don't want to cause general panic!"

So it is agreed. People must pack their chests. It would take the rest of the night to search the catalogue, fetch the books and pack them. Each person is assigned a different area. Our group helps with packing while the various staff fetch books. Oswen and Leonidas don't get time to speak alone, but for now that seems good; it helps focus. Jayleen and Mavrik have an additional perspective, checking on whether certain foods, or tools are present in the keep.

Bel helps Oswen finding books; Kindle is in charge of packing things into the portable hole and Inafina helps with running and carrying things. Investigation 28. Oswen's area is about the multiverse and arcana, since that's been a focus of study for her and she figures if a world is being rebuild due to an extraplanar incursion, understanding the nature of that and the existence of that wider universe seems very important. And any budding wizards, as she herself was really not that long ago, need textbooks to help learn their craft.



## Midnight into campaign day 19

Surprisingly Kindle is confident that all chests can fit in our portable hole for just one plane shift. The packing takes a long time - some *seven hours*. Almost a third of the library is packed up! The portable hole is filled. Jayleen has a large backpack and big chest. We don't technically have to do this in one shift, but they seem to want to - I guess it feels like a more natural, "goodbye" rather than jumping back and forth. And there's certainly a risk associated with the amulet, albeit small.

The hardest part for people, curiously, is putting up "closed" notices on the library. We need an excuse, so "away at conference" is used, along with "library catalogue update" - if anyone looks in the windows and sees all the empty shelves, perhaps the helps.

Bel gives Oswen some inspiration before she casts, and the amulet is used. Arcana 20. The world shifts around us. There's a loud "pop" as before. A gust of wind. She's dropped on the grass area in front of the keep main entrance.



### Fey wild, keep

There's the sound of one Campestri singing! It calls more; they all start to encircle them. Oswen introduces them. There is some information shared about how the Fey Wild works, in brief, safety and so forth; where water and food is; then we get to the keep and - knock, since it's our keep but Froderick has been here for ages. Pattering feet. Froderick opens and welcomes us. The Campestri follows; some other forest animals too; well, we did set this domain up as a refuge.

Introductions all round. A description of how we're going to set up the library. Jayleen is already heading into the kitchen and her and Froderick are soon fussing around over where things should be stored!

**As people go up to find bedrooms, Oswen gets the chance to pull Walton to one side and briefly explain about the mushroom circle, hearth and give him a spare cottage key.**

Oswen and Leonidas get to spend some time in their room, actually having a connection - a meaningful conversation. Oswen gives Leonidas the decorative wine bottle from Trade Gate. At one point, Leonidas talks of his grandfather; back when Ordulin was the Capital and his grandfather was a young man, involved in a war. "The resistance" against Cormyr. Being a very small cog in a grand machine, but still - *an important part of something also important**. Leonidas says that his grandfather would often say, "I hope you'll get to experience what it means to be part of something!" - he'd say. "You'll realise that you as an individual don't have to be the most important thing. There can be something very grand, very beautiful and very - 'human', sorry, you know what I mean! - about feeling small. Feeling small isn't a bad thing... It means knowing that you're part of something big."

"Yes. And this place? Titania created it... It's a domain. It's own nation, of sorts. Ours. Yours now. We're not the only ones trying to save the world... Now you all are, too. You hold the future - at least, one possible future, of Toril, our world - in your hands."

He asks only one thing; that she promises to *try* as best she can to survive and return. Yes.

We rejoin the others. It's a hive of activity! Sona is nowhere to be found though, so Oswen asks after her. "We haven't seen her" - she'd been taking this quite hard so Oswen searches, initially indoors; Investigation 19. Turns out she's in the tower.

Oswen heads up and finds her. She's startled by Oswen's arrival. "I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to be nosey..." "This is your home more than ours now!" "But this is clearly a private room". It's Oswen's little study.

They chat a while. Bonds are reestablished.

Eventually it's dinner time - everyone is extremely tired because to them it's been - well, a long day. So we have dinner quickly, or that's the plan - but Jayleen has decided to win over Froderick by putting on a huge feast! Oswen recognises five of her best dishes, never before seen all at once like this. Oswen is suitably impressed! The warm, inviting dining hall, which was oversized for us before, now feels more appropriately scaled - Kindle's hopes for this space are being met. Bel is the life of the party, telling stories and singing songs. Even Inafina joins in, acrobatics employed at appropriate moments in the story.

**Oswen for a while there just takes it all in and desperately tries to remember this moment, forever.**

Froderick does, in fact, concede during dinner that Jayleen does know what she's doing and is granted more freedom in the kitchen! Oswen pulls him to one side later, gives him a kiss on the forehead and says, "Thank you... For everything. Thank you."

He will be introducing everyone to "all the other residents of the realm!"

People crash out into bed. It must be about 4am-5am or later on Toril, but is a normal evening hour here. Oswen and Leonidas help out with cleaning dishes after Jayleen insists everyone else goes to bed, Kindle hanging out too. It seems our group is reluctant to sleep as Bel ends up hanging back in the dining room, coming up with a new song. Inafina listens to him play.

Eventually everything is done, and we all manage to get to bed. Kindle helps carry Leonidas, now fast asleep, up to the room.



### Fey wild morning, Campaign day 19, Toril time probably 11am-midday

Breezy outside, fluffy clouds, dawn; pinks and classic Prismeer fey colours. Normal to us now, but very odd to our guests.

Over breakfast, we have to discuss our next move. "The pocket watch, I suppose" says Inafina. With breakfast done, we invite everyone to watch how this works. The *new* key is inserted into the old watch - Oswen isn't sure if that'll work, but it's all we have.

There is whirring and clicking. It opens out like a complex music box, then starts to play a strange, tinny-sounding message; no visual component this time, much to our disappointment!

"When you are able, it is time to meet some elements of the other teams. This is not a mission as such but an invitation, to come to Sigil... How you get to Sigil is up to you! There will be a clandestine meeting at a location that you can only see in your mind's eye."

There's a bright flash. Everyone is briefly dazzled. In Oswen's mind she sees a beautiful tower, with a sense of location - the Ladies Ward, a grand estate - a manor with alabaster tower. 8 runes flash up in sequence, which seem to be needed to gain access.

We realise that Mordenkainen originally gave us a teleportation circle when we needed to escape from the fire/earth area, but she couldn't use it as it needed Planeshift. She's sure this amulet would work with that, if she pictures the runes in her mind's eye. Since that's written down, it ought to be easy.

We head outside and bid everyone farewell. We can't say when we'll be back, but now, with Leonidas after the talk in the room last night, at least that understanding is there and unspoken. But Leonidas still comes over, holds her hand, and gives her a long embrace. "Good luck". "And to you. And I haven't forgotten my promise and I stand by it."

"Watch this!" says Oswen. The four of us stand close and she pictures the circle... Aracana 19+13->32.

...pop!



### Sigil

It's a study. An unfamiliar room. A wizard's study. Oswen Arcana 30, familiar signs of an Alarm spell... Bursting into the room a moment later, Mordenkainen brandishing his wand. "INTRUDE - oh - wait! What? Oh, I forgot I gave you that rune! Back already?" "Yes. How long has it been?" "3 days!" "We're supposed to meet people. Clandestine!" "Ah! You're going to that meeting to! Do you know *when* it is?!"

Ah. The message didn't say. Sigh. The Golden Vault... Honestly.

Mordenkainen will go with us but has to finish up some stuff first. He suggests meeting back at his place at 2pm; it's lunchtime now. Bel reminds us that we have a bag full of gems, and wanted to use that as an excuse for a bank account, as an opener for finding the tower. OK, well, that sounds like a dangerous two hours! Let's do it.

We head out and flag down a carriage. It doesn't take long to get to the bank. It is just as crazy and huge as we remember! Fortunately, no dragons this time; a trio of cloud giants instead. We follow a strange 20ft-tall shadow creature through the entrance.

Unsurprisingly, it's extremely ornate. Lapis lazuli and crystal mosaics; rings of stained glass on upper floors; a vast, vaulted ceiling; marble floor. We can see three floors around that look down over this central area, but who knows how much else extends beyond what we can see. A long wide corridor certainly stretches a *long* way away on this floor, ahead of us.

It's a bank, but feels more like a grand temple, thinks Oswen. Is it modelled after cathedrals? Or was it the other way around?

We barely have time to take this all in when someone marches up and greets us. They're huge! "How can I help you today?" - it seems to be an enlarged duergar! It's a bit of a shock after our recent adventures. Unfortunately it sees that but doesn't seem distressed; they shrink down to normal size. Bel announces that we want to open an account. Various questions; it's for party funds but business purposes. "My name is **Ezmi**. I'll look after you today!"

We get taken to a private room and chat as we go. We go past quite a few bits of the bank. The chat doesn't help us get any idea where or how the Imperium gets its money; that would be too big a breach of trust, we figure. Questions are simply politely deflected with answers to other questions we didn't ask! We do learn that there are many, many things that can be done with money here once you *do* have an account, but during setting up an account, it's quite single-purpose. Once we have the account and can walk around the building on the guise of looking for some service or another, we might be able to speak to other _customers_ about rumours or other things they may know and deliberately, or even accidentally disclose.

We're told there's a minimum deposit. All four of our party inadvertently grin - probably rather disconcerting for Ezmi! - and the bag of gems is produced. A felt-lined tray is fetched and gems are emptied there. Ezmi proceeds to assess the gems; it seems he is a competent jeweller.

On value: d6 rolled -> 6. 2xd10 -> 4, 6.

10 beautiful-looking gems fall out of the bag. Ezmi doesn't react at all and just lays them out in four rows. We can deposit them as-is or as currency. We opt for the latter. A black sapphire, blue diamond, couple of pink, four rubies and more. "Remarkably uniform value!" he says. "This definitely meets our minimum deposit of 25,000gp..." (!) "...thank you for opening an account with us."

He hands over a neat card, that we can use as a sort of identifier. We present it at a counter and get stuff done. We are handed a receipt of deposit too...

**50,000 gold pieces.**

We only had just under 3,500 between all of us in gold prior! We learn there is a *minimum* balance of 1,000gp as long as the account is open.

We are seen to the door and out into the main area. We are shown signs that direct us to other areas - stairs, hallways, rooms - to find different services. We can use those at any time.

What now? Oswen looks at all the signs. Investigation only 3+13 -> 16. She's not familiar with banks! She can't really spot anything that seems related to the Imperium; such as very high end sounding services, or special extra secure storage, or something. There are various safety deposit boxes, trust and securities, "general banking" and more. Our account might warrant "private" banking if we purchased extra bank services, but for now, general banking seems "us".

Kindle is looking around. His height normally lets him see a long way but this place is full of all sorts of characters, including very tall creatures, so perception 3+8 -> 11 means he doesn't see much.

Oswen has the idea that maybe we could pretend to want to sell something very valuable to the Imperium, and therefore want to know if they're good for it! That their money is "clean", and they can pay without it being blood money or something. So, where to go for that? Sounds like a private banking thing - essentially, investment advice maybe? We go looking for a salesperson, in effect; someone who might sell us the service the bank hopefully has to do such a thing. We start by asking for a private banker.

We ask the question in vague terms first, not mentioning specific names. At first, he offers us an escrow service. That sounds useful if we actually do make a trade; but Oswen tries delicately to explain that it's also a question of moral compass, while recognising that every customer surely has their own definition of such. Does the bank offer anything that provides insight into the sources of funds?

Basically, and perhaps unsurprisingly, even in an abstract sense - no. The bank maintains neutrality, except for handling stolen goods. We can at least not worry about that. The bank does not involve itself - indeed, does not want to know! - the origin of "each coin that comes through our doors". It's the people holding the wealth that are of interest.

That makes a lot of sense. The banker does go on to suggest that perhaps we should obtain the services of a solicitor, who may be able to answer questions of providence.

(Since he's being helpful and we might even sell something, Oswen asks about the escrow cost; **a 0.5% fee**. This covers everything, including various forms of insurance.)

Well, if the bank trusts a solicitor, we should too; any recommendations? Persuasion ADV (thanks to Bel's help - as a courtier, he knows money) 19+0. He is brave enough to directly asks about the Imperium - good for business, surely? The answer is a little cagey. Yes, good for business... Good overall? Unsure. "The state of Sigil's economy, despite its size and the sheer wealth arising from the nature of it, is balanced quite finely. Such a sudden influx of so much coin into the system from outside it, does have consequences which affect everyday folk." He then goes on to explain what amounts to inflation. But he also divulges enough that we realise the Imperium almost certainly does *not* have an account here; their money is held elsewhere and the bank is doing well because of all the deposits for new sales. Otherwise, it'd amount to zero-sum; money would flow simply between accounts within the bank.

Then there's an unexpected sales pitch. Money can be generated without selling. A beautiful villa in Ladies Ward? Or perhaps a studious tower full of books in Clerks Ward? Either way, powerful magic items could be used as collateral for loans. The bank provides the money as a loan to "make dreams happen". They say, "The Lady is its ruler, but the Bank is what makes it all work!". (He meant "it" as the intangible wider "it" of Sigil's society).

Food for thought!

We head out. Kindle had been quite bored and spent most of the time looking around, having found the conversation a bit "out of his wheelhouse" long before the conversation even really got going! As we're about to go, Perception 18+8 -> 26. He spots a group of three apparent adventurers, and a private banker is doting to their needs. They're getting a *lot* of attention. They have turned up with a small chest, being carried between them - their clothing is lavish and looks new; they have bags of what look like purchased goods; they're showy. Kindle unknowingly "invents" the phrase, "new money"!

The lothario-esque leader dumps out a huge stack from the chest, intentionally in full view. "I told you! I knew it - one day, did I not say? One day, the world would be our oyster!"

Kindle points them out and says, "They're on a high and will want to brag. Once they've done with the banking, we should ask them what happened at the tower; they might be in a mood to tell stories!"

100% Bel's wheelhouse. He's seen people like this before! As they finish up, we hang back a little, only a few feet, to let Bel make the introductions. It's probably obvious that we're all together.

Bel persuasion 12+13 -> 25. "I can see that Tymora has smiled upon you! I could not help but notice how joyful this occasion is. You have come into your rightful riches. Did you sell something to the Imperium? Is that how it happened? We've been wondering if it's worth doing something like that ourselves!"

Apparently, very easy trade; no fees; they provide everything "right at the tower. It took barely more than half an hour from start to finish - from appraising the item to giving us cold, hard gold. It was just... Treasure, that we found in one of our adventures. One of our *conquests*. A magical artefact that they paid a handsome sum for! The more magical, the more they pay. **They seem to care not for the rarity**."

Security is apparently very high at the tower - don't cross the Imperium! - imagine the sheer amount of wealth they must have there. They're sure that it must be close at hand since they produced all those gold bars right there on the spot after appraisal. Various spells were used and the item was placed in chambers that apparently assess how magical the item happens to be. We had no idea that our artefact would be worth as much as it was... It didn't seem very useful; it was just a cube that was keyed to specific planes and could open gates to those planes, but only very specific planes and only once a day. Not something we would have had much use for, given that we live in Sigil."

(Apparently, it was **100,000gp** - they do brag about it - so that gives us some idea of the value of our own items.)

"Get on the gravy train before the gravy runs out! We're off to buy things! Bye!"

On that topic, Kindle asks if we should be transcribing spells. Oswen checks her notes.

```
L5 Scrying
L4 Greater Invisibilty
L4 Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound
L4 Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum
---
17 levels
```

It seems a good idea to have a few extra spell levels in ink on hand if possible too. And we're a bit low on incense!

* We have a list of solicitors
* We want to find magic inks and incense

Bel also wants to withdraw a bit. He figures we need to look after people now living in the keep. In the end we go for:

* 10,000 for the unknown ahead
*  1,000 for ink
*  1,000 for trinkets (and we can give some gold to the keep too)

We find a Tea Street Transport calling point and try to get our friend Alden to plan a route for a solicitor, trinkets, ink and incense. He doesn't know any of the solicitors by reputation but the route he has for the other three things does go past two of the ones on our list. One is based in the trade district, mostly commercial comings and goings; the other is near the Emporium Market - more of a "does everything" type. Less likely to ask questions!

First is the magic shop. 1,000gp of ink and after viewing various scrolls - L4 Locate Creature for 400gp. Bel barters! Persuasion 26; they "don't really do discounts as such, but I will throw in another spell scroll." He pulls out another scroll; it turns out to be L2 Levitate. Useful! Another 6*40 -> 240gp on the ink, then. A whopping 1640 gold total. So now she has to transcribe at some time:

```
L5 Scrying
L4 Greater Invisibilty
L4 Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound
L4 Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum
L4 Locate Creature
L2 Levitate
---
23 levels
```

Next! We arrive at a temple district. Oswen suggests finding a temple to Yondallah; she has been good to us through Kindle's magic. We can both buy incense and make a donation. There's actually a large complex dedicated to the "halfling pantheon" (!).

* 100gp of incense
* 400gp donation

One of the high priests comes out to speak to us as a result! They ask what our interests are, what work do we do; we let Kindle lead the conversation. The priest then says a Benediction! D6->3. Kindle receives a Charm - a Charm of Heroism. This can give him a benefit of a Potion of Heroism.

At the market, we need trinkets! Kindle tries to look, with Inafina's help - she jumps on his shoulders! Sadly this doesn't quite work as hoped; it turns out having a Harengon perched on top of you is distracting. ADV perception 1,4+8 -> 12. Oswen and Bel fare no better. We just end up traipsing around a lot, getting nowhere fast. Inafina tries asking a passer-by; persuasion 16; "Go to Grab Bags! It's a famous stall. You can't miss it - it's the one with the huge crates. Usually a big group stood around."

There's a sign when we get there - "Any 10 items for 1 gold!" - hopefully as far as the Fey is concerned, any value is relative. A group of 5ft x 5ft crates; people just dig through and put things into a basket.

We start digging! Kindle holds up Oswen; Inafina holds the bags; investigation ADV 16,16+13 -> 29. Quality is middling to low, obviously, but it's about novelty in the fey often. They might not work, but with **one hundred of them collected for only 10gp** surely _something_ here will help at the Keep.

And what is the meaning and connection here? These are the things we *specifically* took time out, in the midst of this quest, to find to help our friends in the Keep, who might be the last hope of a lost world conquered by Vecna - all that remains of the knowledge of the world of Toril. We have to hope that this is meaning enough for at least *some* worth in trade.

Finally, solicitors. The "no questions asked" stop!

A doorway heads up a flight of stairs to a second floor with a verandah and an archway that seems to divide the building in two. Doors lead to offices on either side. The solicitors is "Mamud And Sons". Oswen knocks politely; "Come in! It's not locked!"

One of the presumed-sons is sat in a reception area and asks if we have an appointment or if we have something they can help with. We explain in a similar, abstract way to the conversation at the bank; it amounts to a "background check". At this, Mamud himself is fetched and he invites us into an office off the waiting room. More questions are asked. We have to confess that this is about the Imperium. The TL;DR is that solicitors aren't involved in these sales. Sources of funds are not publicly disclosed. The solicitor can help with contracted sales but the Imperium specifically does *not* do business that way. It sounds more like we need a private investigator.

Well, it's something. We learned a lot from the negatives. We're out of time and have to rush back to Mordenkainen's for the 2pm meeting. Oswen upcasts Sending at L4 (out of L3) to warn him that we're a bit late but on our way!



### Mordenkainen's residence, a little after 2pm

Alden moves fast, as he always does. Mordenkainen has donned "presentable" clothes and has what seems to be a travelling staff for walking. He picks out a wide-brimmed hat to complete the look. Outside the house, he starts trying to flag down a carriage, flailing the walking staff around, but we say - "We have one right here!" - with Alden stood in danger of being hit by the staff! Mordenkainen whispers (!) the destination and Alden _thinks_ he knows where it is.

This time it's quite a wild ride, to the point of being on just one side of wheels at corners! At Ladies Ward walkers quickly insist he slows down. We reach a gated compound surrounding a grand, white stone and blue tile mansion, five storeys, set amongst beautiful gardens with manicured topiary, some of them very tall - tall trees in fantastical shapes. Hanging drift globes light the shadows. Mordenkainen tells Alden to head to the gate, which seems unmanned but opens automatically as Alden arrives. Mordenkainen asks Alden to continue through and we pull up to a custom built carriage porch off the driveway.

Alden asks if he should wait. Oswen doesn't want him to feel uncomfortable or lose any jobs, but Alden has decided it's OK suddenly - and settles down in the carriage with a book.

We approach the front door - Mordenkainen ends up uncomfortably close, as it does not automatically open! He waves his arms around; nothing; then goes "ugh" in obvious disdain and uses the door knocker. At *this* act the door swings open (inwards, fortunately). Our strange group of five head inside, into an almost predictable grand foyer, staircases on either side. Reminiscent of Palliset Hall, but this building is taller than it is wide, so there's a more tower-like feel. Beautiful artwork on the walls, when looked at closer, reveals slow movement in some cases; these are magical. There are seven full-length portraits of beautiful women. Small animals or butterflies move, or hair or clothing blows in a wind. Subtle but impressive.

At the top of the stairs where the two staircases meet is a balcony. An older, female elf appears - and we recognise her from one of the paintings. She greets Mordenkainen; "I was wondering when you would arrive!"

"Well isn't it just classic _you_ to send out an invitation without telling people the day or the time?!"

She looks to us - "...and you have guests. We have not met!" - she kind of glides elegantly down the stairs to meet us. She has long silver hair but with signs of darker grey at the temples - this is a rare thing in elves, for sure. She leans forwards to shake hands and introduces herself as "**Alustriel Silverhand**". We introduce ourselves. We are taken through to another room via the stairs, with the comment, "The others have been arriving throughout the afternoon".

"Which others?" asks Oswen as we walk up. We end up in some kind of elegant library or maybe meeting room. Instead of a circular table in the middle, though, people are sat in armchairs or leaning against book cases. 
We recognise someone who waves to us; **Lady Zorhanna** of all people. We are *very* surprised at that. We are introduced to...

* ...a fancy sort of 1980s-rock-outfit lady **Jallarzi**, human, but with a strange glowing halo around her head.
* A man who's older than Mordenkainen, olive skin, short wavy salt/pepper hair, looks a bit more gruff, grey wizard robes with a sword and scabbard leant on a desk next to him, metal staff, **Otiluke**, also human.
* A dwarf who introduces himself, standing and bowing, with clothes that put Bel to shame on over-the-top formal/showman, **Otto**, with a very ornate gold mandolin on the couch next to him.

Alustriel sits near him then continues...

* ...to introduce a young-looking gnome sat with feet dangling off the ground, **Bigby** - "well, his current form!" - which impresses Oswen; she knows at least one of his spells!
* There's one other gnome, who stands and comes over to shake our hands, curiously; she smells oddly of smoke & brimstone; has purple and blue spiky hair that points backwards and huge goggles on her head, various straps, belts and contraptions, including a very complex glove and she has a clockwork dog. She introduces herself with a long name, then says, "But you can call me **Vi**!"
* And Lady Zorhanna is formally introduced. "This is a surprise! Nice to see you again. How wonderful!" (It is of course her mansion where via the rift we first got an inkling of what's going on and, yes, that's in part why she's here too)

So there are eight of "them" and four of "us". Oswen, history 13, is unsettled; but she knows *some* of these names - very accomplished wizards - so perhaps they *all* are? She's not sure about Jallarzi or Vi, though and has no clue at all about Alustriel.

"Now that everyone's here, we can get started!" announces Alustriel.

(End of Part 2.8)
