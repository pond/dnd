# Oswen: Part 2.23
## Campaign Day 53
### City of Akros, on Theros

Despite a late night, we wake early. It's the day of the vote. We can hear much more activity in the hotel than we've heard before; as soon as we step outside, the doorman on our room warns us that the hotel is being held under high security. Lots of bodyguards around and not especially pleasant out there! He suggests that he organises breakfast in the room; we agree, deciding to keep a low profile today.

Our expensive room has a terrace; we eat there. While we eat, Bel plays a new song, inspiring us to face the day ahead. At around 8am, we start to see quite large processions of dignitaries and bodyguards heading over towards council chambers. We know it'll be a closed session, so all we can do is wait.

Our friend at the door has told us that the vote counting and ratification will happen within the closed session. The outcome will be announced to the gathered public - typically comprised mostly of couriers and heralds - after "a few hours". Probably by late morning. It varies.

We head into town, hoping to see if we can gauge any opinions on the vote, or the (newly introduced) news from the Oracle about the titans. It's surprisingly calm; people are resigned to the vote's outcome. Inafina listens out for conversations about the titans and the city's guardians; ADV perception 27; a few people are trying to carry on as normal but a lot of people are heading to the senate square. Of those who are staying around, survival of daily life is what takes front-of-mind - they don't have capactiy to deal with all of the "world breaking" concerns.

Inevitably, we end up drawn to the senate square too.

Some people have set up little stalls - taking advantage of the crowds. We can see a column of smoke above the senate and we're told that this means the vote is already being counted. 10am. More and more people are arriving. The sense of anticipation grows. Then the smoke stops and there's a surge of excitement; people push forward a bit, and it's getting very crowded by the steps. Guards up there start moving to keep the crowd under control, forming a line, but if anything that just causes more people to move forward! We are a fair way back, making sure we can get out of the area quickly; Oswen sends up Orvil to keep an eye on things at the stairs.

Three people emerge, one brandishing a scroll. They move forward and then one calls, "The vote has been counted!" - we hear that, while it was quite a close margin, the vote is to **give the fortress authorisation to act**; the courtyard will be opened for the Brazier Of The Chosen to be accessed.

There's much clamour! Guards move to try and quell those who move in anger. Some think it's martial law. But the official speaker tries to shout over such objections that it's *not* martial law, but there is too much noise. Things might get out of hand.

We're far enough back to get the carpet out. We fly over the security line, knowing that that'll cause more stress for the guards; javelins are thrown as Oswen uses Minor Illusion to boom loudly in Bel's voice, "People of Akros, be calm!". One javelin sticks into the carpet! Another heads for Bel, hitting for 4 damage. Other guards move towards the speakers, presumably to usher them to safety; Bel uses his Mantle but before he really has much chance to do anything with the crowd he has to use L5 Command to get nearby guards to Halt instead of attacking us. Four of five are affected and stop moving, but one continues.

Seeing Bel occupied, Kindle realises he has to act; he uses his Divine Intervention and casts Calm Emotions, centred on the nearby crowd - the guards are reacting to our obviously rather alarming behaviour in flying over, so he's not focused on them - Kindle wants the crowd to stop being hostile from fear. It helps a little bit. Bel realises that so long as we're on "this side of the line", the senators will be ushered away for security reasons; so he tells the carpet to veer off and we pull back, hovering up a little but back.

"I could've judged *that* a lot better..." says Oswen; "...sorry, Bel. Sorry, carpet."

Over the next minute or so, the security line regroups albeit further up the stairs than it was and the crowd calms somewhat. More security has gathered around the senator who, somewhat shakily, starts to continue their pronouncements. At least they manage to get out the information that there's no martial law and nothing stopping people leaving the city.

Once the interrupted formalities are over, the senators hastily retreat back into the chambers and guards form a stronger wall at the top of the stairs as some of the crowd surges forward again. We won't be able to get to Remos for a while; the Senate is closed with very high security. The situation in the square is poor and it's a big area with too many people for us to really help with.

The fort is activated; the garrison is mobilised; and slowly but surely rules are established for those who want to try and activate the brazier.

Realising there's nothing much else we can do where we are, we take the carpet over towards the bridge to the fort. On the way, we catch moments of speeches in small squares here and there, some from supporters, others from naysayers. On the main town side is a guardhouse. A massive group of people are already gathered. Signs are being hastily put up to instruct the crowd on the procedures.

Thinking back to the earlier unwise intervention, we opt to *not* try to push our way in or fly directly to the fort this time. We'll wait for Remos.

We pull away from our approach and as we swing back towards town, Orvil tells Oswen that he's spotted a big crowd at the library; we get close and overhear questions about how the brazier works. "There must be *something* that is written!" they insist. Others are in temples, praying.

We spend some time with people at the library, perhaps convincing some, but not others; such is the way of things. Eventually in a quiet period Oswen uses Sending and asks Remos if he's OK and if he plans to visit the brazier.

He's at his constituency office organising evacuations. We know the office location now and head over, to see if we can help... Anything to speed up the process of getting to the brazier!

As hours pass, the city isn't doing the greatest job of keeping people under control! Some people are trying to cash in, others are just venting anger toward the senate; a huge queue has formed at the bridge with city celebrities and assorted heroes waiting their turn. All along the seawall side, we see that the garrison have rolled out ballistas, though we're not sure how useful those would be; at least it makes some people feel better. As the sun starts to set, various temporary watchtowers have been erected and manned and navy ships have been sent out.

Braziers in temples fill the night sky with plumes of fragrant smoke.

As evening sets in, on the other side of town, caravans are no longer leaving - they don't want to travel at night. That's messy too, with families pleading for passage and so-on; individual experiences vary greatly, from those who have escaped as they wished, those who find they cannot, and those who do not want to, dealing with that in various ways of their own.

Ships in the distance have lit fires in crow's nests. Apparently it's a signalling system. If the fire goes out, the ship has probably been sunk...!

Once the caravans have halted and Remos has set as many minds at ease as he can, he finally closes his office. He needs time to "decompress" from the crazy day and returns to the hotel. We do too, with Orvil up on the roof keeping a close eye on the outside world. We give Remos the space he needs. A nail-biting hour passes.

He doesn't know how we can possibly get to the brazier. "I refuse to abuse my position. If there is a queue, we will queue. You do understand that?"

"You'll probably be queueing for the whole night..."

"If that is what the citizens of Akros are doing, then that's why I am doing."

"So be it. Well, if you're queueing, would you like company?!"

In the end, we go by carpet - to the *end* of the queue.

There's no point trying to talk him out of this, but it's certainly quite frustrating to know that the titans might attack at any moment (purely through the power of belief!) and yet here we are, queueing. The guard house is assigning numbers to groups, as people go over in batches.

Inafina overhear disappointed people returning. There is some doubt growing; they've tried all sorts of things to make it "work" and nothing does! We try to keep Remos' spirits up reminding him that we've studied this thing and Oswen's sure it will work, but they aren't and self-doubt is almost inevitable.

Food stalls have turned up and at least some of the negative experiences from those who've visited the brazier are offset a little by the "night market" vibe. We decide to lean into that and try to stage a little ad hoc performance to keep people's hopes up. Bel ADV performance, 30! That's certainly effective. He sings of history and how every person who tries is important, because it *will* eventually work. Take heart!



## Day 54, technically - about 2am
### Akros, at the keep

It's our turn! Us and a few others travel over the bridge. Everyone is tired; the wear is showing on guards. There's a sage at the brazier, recording things. Some people at the front try to ask what has and hasn't worked. Oswen casts Detect Magic. The dormant magic is there. It needs an infusion of very powerful magic into it to awaken it.

Oswen is chatting quietly to Remos, checking in; she has to mention that we're not sure if the person successfully activating the Brazier would even survive. They might have to be laying down their life. As she's telling him this, Inafina INS 19+8->27; he'll do anything he has to in order to help people and save the city. He will do whatever it takes, but doesn't have belief per se in *himself*.

Inafina gives Oswen "the look" but Oswen already figured this a while ago, so she's not too surprised by that. She's using Message to check in with her party; we all agreed. If this didn't work, *we would* fall with this city.

Ahead of us, someone tries to use magic to light the fire. She sees that through her spell; it lights briefly, but doesn't stay powered and sputters out. Then, a panic from Orvil and seconds later, yelling from the walls of the keep. Alarm bells ring urgently. The outermost marker fires in ships have gone dark. 3 miles marker.

No time to waste.

Oswen looks at Remos. "If one person who might believe in this artefact and would be willing to die for the city is enough to light it, **imagine what five people might do**."

The person ahead of us is frustrated; but we have to try and take our time. Then a gasp from guards. "Second marker has gone dark! Something is definitely happening!" - ballistas with burning payloads are then fired to try and get light on what's happening.

Detect Magic fails just as we get to the brazier. The five of us circle it and Oswen says, "Well, this is it; we have to I think just look at it and believe it'll work; the five of us *will fall* here otherwise and we *are* prepared to!"

We all hold the edge of the brazier, in case *that* is enough for it to work.

"And that's it. Strange as it is, just believe it'll light, and it'll do so in the nick of time, because that's what everyone's expecting it to do!"

Oswen has brought up Detect Magic again. Bel is giving her more inspiration; ADV ARC *and* Heroic Inspo burned brings it up to 34. She starts to see a connection from Remos, magical, that's "flowing" into the brazier. And she detects this time a weak magic in the bracelet, for the first time. Dormant, unrelated to the brazier. It's a kind of magical store, kind of a soul jar. She tries not to be distracted! Remos is connected. But there's not enough weave, enough energy to kickstart it. She gets an even stronger recognition of the Mythal that we'd been told about. She can sees strands of magic flowing from the city; extraordinary to witness; the people of Akros itself unwittingly feeding energy.

She relays what she's seen. HIS for herself, 7, Bel likewise low. We don't remember. Inafina in frustration says, "Well we have to try *something* to kickstart it, even if it seems pointless..." - and tries Burning Hands, directed down into the bowl - as she does this, though, we hear another shout as the innermost ship ring has failed. Orvil, ADV perception 18, can see pyrotechnics being sent up (magically or not, he doesn't know) to see something being illuminated. At first he can't even figure out what it might be, because of scale; but then he spots it - a *huge* thing in the water that's causing massive displacement and is probably why the earlier ships vanished; that alone is enough to capsize a galleon. Then there's a fin, as big as a ship, breaks the surface; less than a mile out; and two giant eyes under the water now visible, also each seeming to be as big as a ship.

As Oswen suspects, the Burning Hands spell doesn't work but with Detect Magic up she notices the spell sort of "soak down", but it *does* infuse and brighten magic around it. It's being absorbed quickly. She can see that the magic in the bowl *is* interacting; it's having an effect, but not enough. It needs more than that.

"OK, everyone, together, all at once" she says - "cast whatever you like, but direct it into the brazier. As high level as you can please. All at the same time."

"As high level as we can?!" "Yes please. On my count..."

Initiative:

* Oswen 18
* Kindle 12
* Inafina 11
* Bel 4

"...doesn't have to be fire. Go!" - and uses L6 scorching ray, one after another to keep the power pouring in. Bel uses a high level Sunbeam. Inafina uses her most powerful sunburst, worried that it'll hurt people but trusting Oswen and it *is* "captured" by this strange artefact as the magic is 'sucked in'. Oswen can see the power building. Bel goes with L6 Healing Word, *singing* a musical word in. And the person who'd been in front of us, whose magic alone hadn't been enough and lacking Remos to light the spark, realises he can help and throws his own spell in.

Huge veins running to the ground light up. The ground under her seems to move! CON saves:

* Oswen 11+1 -> 12
* Inafina 20+1 -> 21
* Kindle -> over 20
* Bel -> 12

Remos, Oswen, Bel and the magical helper suddenly fall unconscious! Kindle and Inafina don't know what has done this, but they're the only two still standing. But it's worked... The Colossi are moving. There are shouts and panic; "Get them off the bridge!" hears Inafina, because it's going to be torn apart.

Kindle tries to heal Oswen, which wakes her up; Orvil is shouting "in her head"; the leviathan has emerged and huge waves are smashing against the cliff. The harbour is draining as water pulls back; the leviathan is about half a mile out. The two Colossi are themselves enormous - 80ft high - wading out and at least that displaces water in an opposing direction! Quickly we wake the others so that we can get a look, jumping onto the carpet with our new ally and rising up a little to get a clear look over the wall.

Remos is not in a good way. He's conscious, but looks severely exhausted. It's a question of rest, not healing. He's not sure what's going on as while we were all casting spells, he was having a lot taken out of him and we'd not even realised. But now we all have a ringside seat from the carpet. A tentacle extends out, impossibly huge, must be at least 100ft. It's all in full view of the city; the bridge has been smashed and the port is taking heavy damage. The ballista crews don't want to hit the Colossi. On the sea, it's all ships can do to stay upright; none can assist. Powerful as they are, the Colossi with their strange radiant beams of light look like they might be outmatched; the leviathan is truly huge.

"We need to help them" says Remos. "Is there anything we can do to help them?!"

"Well" says Oswen, "We *did* say that it took people willing to lay down their lives, I suppose, and I'd better stand by that!"

She pats the carpet and whispers, "Be brave", and to Inafina - "let's get into range".

As we head over the ballistas, she shouts, "Fire *past* the Colossi - deliberately wide and far - that thing is huge, it doesn't matter about aim, you'll hit *something!*"

When we're getting closer, Oswen realises with surprise that this is a water-based elemental. It has shades of Marid. Much of its perceived size is more a control of the water around it. She calls out to her crew, "Force damage to split the water, ice to stop it moving, radiant if that's all you've got!"

"I don't have *any* of that!"

Oswen says, "You have even better - get in its head, distract it!"

Bel uses Psychic Lance. It actually helps! There's 27 damage. Oswen tries Ice Knife - two nat 1s in a row mean the main blast misses, but at L5, it has 6d6 -> 23 damage just from the shattering ice shards. Kindle looks up to the moon and prays to Yondalla, calling down L5 Moonbeam; 28 damage and Inafina uses another big sunburst, which doesn't hit as hard as she might like but still does 8d6 -> 24 damage. We can see flaming ballista rounds that *are* hitting the mark. Bel repeats Psychic Lance, 28 damage; Kindle holds his spell for 27 more; and Oswen gets a hit with Chromatic Orb (Ice) for 35 more. Another sunburst from Inafina (the last she can do at that power) for 29 damage and now our extra passenger gets the hang of things, throwing out scorching rays.

The Colossi are bearing down and attacking as we create these distractions and it seems we're at least doing *some* kind of damage. One creates a vast spear of light, thrusting it into the sea which boils furiously as the leviathan is impaled. More great rays burst forth from their faces and, at last, the leviathan seems to be getting subdued; the Colossi are sinking lower in the water as they punch down and continue their assault and, finally, it seems to start to break up. It's quite a strange yet gruesome finishing act as they continue to tear the creature apart, until eventually they themselves have disappeared below the water.

We wait, unable to see what's going on. Fire rounds from the ballista are just falling into water now; it's not helping us see anything; Oswen uses Sending to ask the Captain to cease fire. A tense few moments pass until our new ally shouts, "Look!" - and we can see the heads of the two Colossi emerge as they walk back towards the city. Oswen uses a last Sending to convey, "The Colossi have prevailed and are returning, keep out of their way!"

The two get into place at the mouth of the harbour but *don't* settle back into the walls; they stand on guard. As we fly in we can see terrible damage at the docks and a lot of wrecked ships. Half the bridge is collapsed. Shaking looks to have damaged some buildings above too, *but* the rest of the city has been saved. Remos is too tired to sit up now and we have to set down but we do so up at the Keep. Oswen is asking if there's anything that can be done to help. Well, the garrison are stuck here since the bridge is out. Oswen takes the carpet to start ferrying people while the other five wait behind.

Inafina finds out our new ally is **Raelen** - "what - what even happened?!"

The rest of the night is a blur of trying to help with things; the magic carpet is obviously very helpful and is even capable of lifting a fair amount of weight - albeit more slowly - which means temporary repairs can be made to the bridge, with some magical help from various mages. Eventually a temporary rig is working well enough to take one or two people and it's quickly reinforced from there. Remos is fast asleep, covered in a blanket; Raelen has returned to town; we've taken it in shifts on the carpet; and eventually, when there's not much else we can do, we fly Remos up to the hotel as the dawn light breaks.

Orvil flies out and around to get a good look at the Colossi in the light. They stand out a little, in the sea, guarding the harbour, motionless. They have quite a few chunks missing! Bits of *stuff* - chunks of leviathan - have washed up here and there; a water elemental, but evidently with parts made of some form of solid flesh. The sea at the battle site is still filthy with mud and gore.

Oswen yawns. "Well, that's that. We've helped save the world. Again. But we're not much closer to doing what we came here to do... I think, breakfast. Bel? Any recommendations?"

It's been 24h roughly since we last woke -> CON saves all round.

* Oswen 4
* Inafina 19
* Bel 12
* Kindle 10 -> heroic inspo -> 10, again

Everyone is dragging their feet. Inafina ends up a distance ahead, realises, turns around, goes, "...or we could try and sleep maybe?!" - but Bel still wants food. If it's not breakfast, it's supper. We end up back at the room and Bel orders club sandwiches and crayfish bisque (!).

Oswen uses Sending to the priest at the temple where the "part water" children were hiding. L4, as L3 all gone; words to the effect of - "Leviathan defeated early this morning; hopefully things will return to normal soon enough." The reply tells here that the women and children were evacuated anyway; taken to safety, in case *those* tensions in the city *don't* go away now.

It takes a while for the food to arrive. The hotel is busy as damaged houses nearby have made them act as something of a shelter. Quite a lot of people are displaced.

We're chatting about what to do with Erebos, Serena and so-on. Bel plays soft music. Inafina at one point realises she doesn't get a response to part of a conversation - because everyone else has fallen asleep! Soon enough, she drifts off too...

### Mid afternoon ish

...passive perception, Kindle and Infina wake up with a jump. Did they sleep too long?! It's dark outside! We were expecting it to be early afternoon, maybe middle. They wake up Oswen and Bel. "We slept too long! It's gone dark" says Kindle, but Inafina says, "no, it's too quiet... Something is wrong."

Oswen heads out onto the terrace. It's not darkness; it's a roiling, pitch black mist. Yet it's somehow translucent though, as she thinks she can see pinpricks of starlight. She brings Orvil up some ~99ft above her position and asks what he can see. He's above the mist and sees stars. And *our room* is surrounded by the mist. It's difficult to explain but it's a bit like our room was somehow cut out of reality and is now floating in this mist below a starry sky.

Oswen opens the door to the room. The corridor ends abruptly in a huge bank of black mist. Oswen brings Orvil back via the Fey since it might not be safe to fly through. Kindle wanders out to look too. He uses his ring to shed light but it can't really penetrate far through the mist.

She spends some time ritual-casting Detect Magic. All her items register normally and they aren't under a spell influence, but the mist itself *is* a magical effect. Some kind of permanent one. There's another sense of magic all around the space we're in. Distinct from the mist, it registers as every school of magic! The mist and everything else is, perhaps, "unformed" raw magic?

Inafina raises the alarm; she's sure she notices movement off the balcony-side of the mist. We all face that way and adopt a defensive position; Oswen calls out, "Enough of this nonsense, show yourselves!"

An almost-skeletal hand reaches up and grasps the edge of the balcony. It breaks the edge off when it does that. It's about 30ft wide. Bel freaks out! He had a Starry Wisp ready but it goes wild. Oswen says, "No, it's OK Bel, it must be a god, or a servant of one; given the skeletal hand and darkness, perhaps this is Erebos? Maybe he's calling us?"

The room rocks a little, unnerving - feels like it's moving. And then it feels like it's speeding up. A lot! It's hard to stay on our feet.

We break up above the mist. The great hand is lifting us up, to a face some 200ft above where we were. A sunken, old face under a beautiful black vale; black lace, high-neck dress; two more figures, we realise, one on each side. One looks younger, the other - well, ancient. Oswen takes a guess and says, "An honour to meet the three of you -" (looking to the one in front) "- Lachesis, I presume?"

A chorus of voices in our heads, many more than three, but speaking as one. Almost! Sometimes the words vary a little. INT saves all round:

* Bel 18 (understands)
* Kindle nat 1 (stunned!)
* Inafina 13 (not stunned, but can't understand)
* Oswen 18 (understands)

The names are just attributions. They do not see themselves as separate beings; they see themselves as one. "You have been looking for me. Now you have my attention. Why have you stuck your little fingers into the woven tapestry of this world and pulled on its threads and created these tangles? Do you mean to test me? Do you seek to test my patience?" - and so-on.

Oswen tries to explain that we were just trying to stop death; we wanted to find the three (one!) of them, but via Serena, who we found was playing 'games of wits' and so-on.

A mixed response about Serena, "so you're a pawn in her game" and so-on. Then there's a strange schism. Then the voice start to accuse each other! INT-based WIS-insight check, 17. They aren't schizophrenic, yet they view themselves as one entity; but it's that these three physical representation of one entity *across time* and so they speak across time.

Oswen interrupts! She asks outright about Vecna and Kas.

A silence. Then in unison: "I will exchange that story with you in return for something that I seek."

"What is it that you seek?"

"I seek the rebel soul that is causing trouble. I cannot see her. Where is she? What is she up to?! What is this game that she plays with me?"

Oswen sighs. "You are a god, or many gods; in any case, very powerful. So you will know if I lie. I cannot give you *the* soul that you seek. It may not even exist anymore."

"You play the games that she plays. You speak in specifics and riddles in the same obfuscating way. Distractions, misdirections."

One comes closer. Very close. Scary! An eye is extended *on a hand*, wide open; "But I can see you, and you are not her!"

In the resulting dialogue, Oswen mentions that Clotho (via Divination) said "children of fate" and the combined reply, "we seek *just her*, we do not care about **the other two**".

**OTHER TWO**. Oswen asks, "You speak of Remos and Caven?"

**"Not Remos. We can see Remos. Remos is a split soul. That is how Serena hid herself."**

"Then who is the third?"

They call lean in; "The third? The third was created without our knowledge. The third was created in another time." - it seems there's a rather strange gap here.

"Well, I don't know if we can help. I can't promise it. But I understand the terms you present. And if I can convince her, I will bring Serena to you. Is there a path I can follow?"

"We just want to know where she is."

Turns out they could, say, send ravens to track her.

Well *technically* we don't know where she precisely is right now. So we'll have to go and find her. And then we'd need to find a way back here. How would that work?

* Bel persuasion 28
* Inafina insight only 15

And then it gets... Weird. These gods span time. We are thinking in linear time, they think across it. Oswen is kind of aware of a future version of herself that *has*, with Bel's help, convinced Serena to agree to revealing her location. We all somehow see, or feel this; Inafina isn't sure how that happens, she can't figure out anything else. But whatever it was and however it was done, Oswen knows somehow Serena will agree in future.

Oswen double-checks *herself*; she can't explain it, it's not a trick, but she's sure it's true; that Serena *will* agree to have her location revealed; so, Oswen tells the Moirai where she was last known to be in "her time".

After a pause, the voices restart. "You have upheld your part of our agreement. We will uphold ours. Rethink your question carefully. You can ask but one question, for one answer."

Inafina knows that look in Oswen's face... "No, Alustriel's going to kill us..."

Oswen shrugs. "What are we saving if we lose ourselves?"

She asks her question:

"How many years - in time as I perceive it - has Medusa got left to spend with Asteria?"

The "rightmost god" answers, in surprisingly a singular voice, and explains in very abstract and convoluted way - but **it is seventeen years**. This is not *their* bidding, under their control; it's done by the bidding of someone else. But we can't say who.

"If you want another question, you have to provide us with another thing."

Oswen admits that it was quite some hubris to ask that. And it might, or might not, have harmed our cause elsewhere. We do have a *real* question to ask, so...

...the gods interrupt; if we say who asked us to come here, they'll answer. So we don't see an issue; we describe the Circle of Eight, and Alustriel is known to them too - she's been here before - they describe her as a "troublemaker" and also say:

**"She is involved with one of the children of fate!"**

So Oswen asks her question. Kas and Vecna once friends; now not; what happened?

There is *discussion* amongst them about who can answer (wow, this is confusing) and they say that we must "touch her mind" - of course they can! - and then say, **"Ah - you *do* come about the children of fate. You, too, are entangled."**

We want the "next chapter" after Serena exited the picture. The rise of Caven. The Moirai (and Serena) were tricked by him. At some stage, he split himself the way Serena did, but in a different way - as they understand it, the "evil" part is now Vecna, they *think*. But who is the good part? *That* is one of the Children Of Fate. "Exited the tapestry". Cannot be found.

**This being, that we call Vecna - part of Caven - went to Oerth, became a warlord, got bored and expanded beyond, became very powerful and developed a close friendship *somewhere* along the line with some second warlord on a plane that Caven had once visited, before he split into Vecna. An *intense* friendship they say - they don't know if was romantic or not, but it certainly blurs the line - and they travelled the planes together for many years. That's the being we now call Kas.**

And with that, they think Kas split into a third Child of Fate. With what we've said and what they saw in Oswen's head, to them, missing threads in the tapestry make sense. So Caven learned Serena's secret, "became" a Child of Fate when he split. Must have told Kas. Then Kas split too. And the not-Kas part of that is another Child of Fate.

The picture in the locket, that they saw in Oswen's mind, is "pre-split" Caven and the "original" pre-split Kas.

But this split is *not* the point where they fell out of friendship. After Caven split, the Moirai believe that (some time later) Kas split out of (romantic or platonic) love. A good preson could not follow Vecna. To us, then, it's likely that Kas is also evil. (This means the good parts of each are hidden; in Serena's case, she keeps her good part visible - Remos - and she stays hidden instead, but that means she's as evil as Kas or Vecna...?!).

However, now we have a pure evil Kas and Vecna remaining. No good left at all. And they just couldn't continue in a functional "friendship" in that state and became competitive. The Moirai think that Vecna forged a sword for Kas, perhaps based on a genuine motive, but the sword ultimately corrupted Kas and turned him against Vecna.

**"You have been tempted by that sword. We can tell. We can sense the manifestation of the Mother." So Nyx is the *evil* inside the sword?! The Moirai can't answer. But Nyx is certainly pure chaos. Many would consider Nyx evil.**

Oswen is about to do something but then they say:

"We shall speak no more until we are forced to do so. We *shall* speak again."

...**we all pass out and awaken back in our beds**. And it is, as it should have been, mid-afternoon.

Oswen and Inafina get up - Inafina doesn't remember anything that happened! - but go into the main room to find Bel panicking. "He won't wake up!" - he's shaking Kindle, who is unresponsive. He's breathing, but unresponsive.

Oswen HIS nat 20->25. Oh! The entire time we were with the gods, Kindle was stunned; he didn't react of say a word the *whole time*. Something happened to him and we didn't even realise. "Bel, do you have anything to revive someone? It's a mental thing. Like, a terrible headache." Bel asks about a few spells, but they don't seem right; but then he goes, "Ah! I have it!" - and grabs his guitar, casting Protection From Evil And Good. Kindle ADV save nat 20, he wakes up!

Back in the main room, Oswen and Bel explain what happened.

Eventually there's a knock on the door and politely, we're reminded that even though there *is* late checkout, it's *very* late and although we're heroes of the city... And so-on.

Wait, heroes of the city?! It seems Raelen has given credit perhaps beyond where it's due.

"Yes. It's in the Evening Standard! Would you like a copy?"

We take one. As we're walking down the street, Inafina asks why Oswen took one. Oswen chuckles, a little evil smile; "Can you imagine Alustriel's face when she sees this?!"

Well, we're told that we convince Serena about our plan! So - well - we'd better get there. We decide to walk, but once we get to the hanging walkways on the sides of the catacomb entrance we find damage, so use the carpet. We park up (and apologise, again, to the carpet and insist that we *will* mend the spear hole!) and head inside.

A rather cross Serena is sat by a camp fire! She's annoyed. She doesn't know what it proves. It is a *wild* convo! Oswen *knows* that this will work out, for the first and probably last time in her life. Serena wanted the Moirai to be annoyed but thinks they might barely have noticed; and Oswen describes the three of them, to prove (as best she can) that we really did get to see them. And once Bel steps in, of *course* Serena agrees to giving away her position. "Yes! I would like them to see where I am - to see how happy I am - this stupid game that they play!"

Hands are shaken. We're due to leave. So Oswen mentions - 'free of charge' - about Caven actually splitting himself. But she already knew! She was "evil", and she thought he'd split himself so his "evil" part could be with her.

"Can you imagine how much two beings, completely hidden from fate, could have accomplished?"

The conversation continues with various avenues explored but TL;DR, Remos must remain "hidden and pure" - she doesn't want (say) the "good part" of Caven to be introduced to him.

Oswen at the end asks about Erebos. Would Serena want to tell Erebos about the split with Remos just to mess with the gods? Inafina - INS 22 - recognises, oh, wait, this *is* an important secret. She is *sure* we want something! "What do you want from me to keep this a secret?" asks Serena. But at this very moment, a 'gate' - portal - opens! Standing on the other side, dressed in remarkably impressive clothes, stands Alustriel.

"What are you doing here?!" asks Oswen.

"You need to come with me. Now! Sigil has reopened. It is chaos."

She reaches forward to take our hands. Inafina says, stressing, "The issue is *important to her*". Oswen pulls back from Alustriel; looks to Serena; "For your peace of mind then, and mine, a deal: we will not willingly reveal that information to anyone, anywhere, but in return you will never again interfere with the visions of the Oracle. She seems a genuine individual who has had a hard life and should be allowed to use her talents without further interference."

Serena nods. "I admit that was...Naughty. Fine. I will agree not to interfere with the visions of *this* Oracle!"

Oswen laughs. HIS 21. "Good enough! Farewell." As Oswen takes hold of Alustriel's hand, she remembers there's one more thing to do... The medusa! She pulls back. "Can't go yet. I'll be there as soon as I can. *Trust* me Alustriel. Drop the portal."

"I can't! If I drop this I won't be able to open it again!"

So Oswen has to use Sending to Medusa. "Apologies. Must leave with urgency. Wanted to see you in person. Moirai say - seventeen years. Not by their bidding; unchangeable."

A response immediately - "THANK YOU! That means the world to me. Travel safe. Thank you."

We all hurry through the portal. Inafina is last; she is *sure* she hears the sound of crows...



## The Outlands

There's a moment of disorientation. We are not in the place from which we departed. It looks like a small stone tower, books all around. Tasha is there. She looks anxious. There's a bronze Dragonborn scholar of some kind and a dwarf and Mordenkainen.

"Well, your terrible is timing" says Oswen, then, "no, wait, I mean..."

"This is Mayastan!" says Alustriel. "This is his tower. Sort of."

Oswen is flustered but introduces her party. And then, without further ado, Alustriel instructs Mayastan to portal us to Sigil straight away. "But is it safe?!" objects Oswen; "What if it closes again?"

There's some discussion of "them" and others from Mayastan - "they've been gone for *weeks*" - but we don't really understand what that's about and before we know it, we end up in a new place. We recognise this place. Alustriel's Sigil sanctum, like in our very first meeting, but messy - almost as if a literal tornado had torn through. Things scattered all around.

Oswen loses it a bit. "How is this safe? Why are we here?!" she shouts. But Alustriel is running, calling for someone. Mordenkainen's face is grave. "She's not thinking straight" - he casts a spell then calls - "Alustriel! She's not here! She's in the market. If you weren't so messed up you'd have thought to cast Locate Person yourself."

Oswen INV 23. She looks at the disarray. Someone rifled through things here. But it was targeted; they were looking for something. And not a thief - someone who cared about the place, but was in a huge hurry - Oswen asks if perhaps Alsutriel's wife did this? Looking for something? More panic. When! Why! Oswen suggests we take a break, tidy up, and in so doing find what is missing. From that, maybe get a better idea of who and why.

We start to explain the stuff that happened but have to avoid explaining Serena's split spell. It starts with Caven. Mordenkainen wants to know more, but Oswen flat-out refuses to tell more. During the explanation, we're all asking - why would someone split themselves thus? If Caven - now Vecna - realised where he wanted to go, what would he get if he split something he can split from the gods? ARC 28 - something magical; something to do with magic, surely? Serena also wanted to hide that secret, and was insistent. Something about this technique. It could wreak havoc if widely known.

Did Caven always know the path he wanted to take? To be a lich? But again, what value is splitting anything good that remained *and keeping it hidden*? This being the only way to overcome all other magic of detection? **What did he hide?**

A lich. A lich! In later conversation; **is that good part his phylactory?** Or at least, linked to it?

And then we talk about Kas; same deal, for the same reason? And then we get to the sword. Oswen hadn't figured that the Nyx connection to the sword was that important, so doesn't mention it and it's Bel that brings it up. Alustriel immediately casts Detect Magic and looks closely at Kindle! No, no magic...

So maybe there's a link between the sword and Nyx. A *part* of Nyx in it? Mordenkainen gets very nervous. There's a part of a *god* in that sword? One of the ancient, original gods?

We finally get to the punchline; the issue that one of the three Children of Fate has an "involvement" with Alustriel. This is obviously not helpful! We don't know who, or what, or why, or if they know what they are, or have been manipulated into something...

...the unseen servants, who were tidying, interrupt. They have discovered the missing item - inevitably, really - **Alustriel's spell book**.

And at that moment, an outside door opens! We hear movement in rooms beyond. We go for weapons but Alustriel says, "Wait, but the alarms didn't go off - is it - ..." and calls out, "Malaiana! Is that you?"

A female, well-built Aasimar appears. Long, wild-looking, firey hair runs up the stairs, flings their arm round Alustriel and they embrace. We end up giving them space. But at least, as we leave, we do overhear that Malaiana was the one who *did* get the spellbook.

Inafina remarks - "Well, Malaiana's certainly physically impressive. Not that she needed to be; anyone that can handle Alustriel *must* be pretty hardy."

We learn while we're away, from Tasha, that Zorhanna is *still* missing and Tasha doesn't think anyone has been sent to look for her! Oswen is horrified, but tries to keep it together (we learn we've been away about 8 days in Outlands time).

TL;DR:

* Alustrien assures us that someone *is* looking for Zorhanna.

* Mordenkainen and Oswen talk. He thinks she's about to suggest that the Incantarium are agents of Vecna but, no; Oswen thinks that the Lady Of Pain closing Sigil, then "realising" Vecna's agents were already present and reopening seems... Hapless. More likely, they're working for *her* and she's reached a level of magic she deems "enough to be effective"; but how do we find out?

* Those blueprints of Vecna's design from the gnomes. Someone was meant to be investigating those, but Sigil closed and it never happened. Now it could. Oswen asks Mordenkainen for help on that front. If he can give us places to go, we can take them; but he offers to take them personally **and we hand over the blueprints** as a result.

* Bigby might have more useful thoughts about a connection between Nyx and the sword.

The Eight are called by the group stone. Dinner is being arranged.

Before dinner, Alustriel comes to say "sorry" (no need!) to Oswen but sends a telepathic message. "You can't tell anyone. We haven't sent anyone to rescue Zorhanna. We're too busy. Everyone is too busy! But there is a chance. We have sent people. Agents. They're there for another reason. But they might find her. They *have* to find her. I - I fucked up. I owe you this apology, but I will make it right."

"Everyone looks to you for - for guidance. We're all here to help. But we all expect you to do everything. But you can't, and it's OK; we are here to help, where we can."

"That's very kind. But I am a Chosen. We are expected to be perfect; even though we never are. We will always fall short of her expectations! ...I have something for you."

She hands Oswen a scroll. "Give it back to me when you are done."

It's "Alustriel's Moon Cloak"

Oswen nods; "Thanks! Good to see you putting your own name to spells now... And if *your* god is anything like *those* gods on Theros, they'll find a way to make it work so they look good, too; I'm not exactly *confident*, but I think that those people *will* find Zorhanna."

We learn that the Guardians here are now keyed to recognise us. We can come and go as we please.

### 10750 XP (LEVEL 13)

A few hours pass as we wait for others to arrive.

Oswen copies Alustriel's scroll. The four of us decompress a bit privately, thinking over everything on Theros. We never did figure out what the deal was with Remos' bracelet, for one thing. We're not sure what will become of him or Serena. It's a shame we never got to explain to Erebos why we didn't give him Serena's secret, too.

To our surprise, Bel tells us that he's considering changing and bolstering his skills by pledging himself to Titania as a patron, to give him warlock skills; but he decided against it, having started to doubt the concept of "benevolent gods" given everything we encountered recently. He can see that we're all rather relieved! We would have supported his decision of course, but we agree with him that it would seem... A little uncomfortable and risky.

Yondalla has bailed us out a couple of times, though (Divine Intervention) so Kindle says his faith has been strengthened; that isn't in conflict with Bel's decision, though. It's a very serious business to pledge yourself to someone, through a pact.

We rest a while, with Bel playing soft music. It feels like a rare moment of calm.

We end up sat around the dinner table with Alustriel, Malaiana, Tasha, Mordenkainen, Otto, Bigby, and this time, even Vi. It's good to see everyone. As ever, Jallarzi and Otiluke are too busy with Oerth - we need to find some way to give them a break!

(Vi's arrival was interesting. She looks like she's just come from combat! She is dressed and covered in camouflaged, tracking mud into the house. She's not based in Baldur's Gate anymore - someone she trusts is watching the area and besides, the cults there are still causing trouble and it's actually useful. Keeps bad actors distracted. So instead, she's gone up north to deal with the dwarves.)

### 5:30pm Outlands time

Malaiana has created an amazing feast... Otto boosts it magically (Heroes' Feast, which gives us a very high roll 2d10->15 max HP for the next 24h). Malaiana raises a toast; and we're not allowed shop talk!

We try to only talk about personal levels, not shop talk, then. On that, Jallarzi and Otiluke *appear* to be doing OK. Vi *does* feel a bit more "in the loop". And it's awkward at first but eventually we do lift mood a bit. We can't focus on the weight of responsibility. Alustriel in particular is quite different once she relaxes. Oswen realises that Malaiana's toast was probably more for Alustriel than us.

At one point there's a discussion of, well, magic/physics. While Sigil was closed, did the weave get depleted as people drew upon magic? Alustriel has instruments that measure such things. She realises there was a drop for a short while, but then it came back up and stabilised. **Something was replenishing the weave**.

So a third option - the Incantarium were not gathering artefacts to combat Vecna; they were gathering them as a source of energy.

Once the moratorium on shop-talk is over `:-)` we hear about what everyone else was doing.

* Otto: Oerth, Acererak - bad news! Acererak is definitely on Oerth; has left Torril.
* Bigby: Torril, giants - he went North with Vi then continued up North of the spine and *did* manage to find giants and get their help, but got called away.
* Mordenkainen: Had picked up from Bigby to verify Vecna's based of operations, which we *think* is where the "machine" is - the thing Oswen found out about with the blueprints. Mordenkainen thinks the machine actually activated. "Before I say anything else, I need everyone to promise that they're not going to just react rashly; we must think about this rationally..." Oswen says, "Spit it out, Mordenkainen!" "Well I didn't find the *origin* of its activation; I found the endpoint. But I followed it. **I have sad an unfortunate news to report; the plane of Eberron has fallen.** There have been a number of cataclysmic, widespread, destructive events. Not perhaps on the same of the *original* cataclysm, nothing that devastating, but not small. Sharn was attacked directly which resulted in the loss of many thousands of lives. In fact, all the great capitals have fallen. We must assign someone there."
* Vi thinks she must go to Eberron. It's her home. "No-one knows it better than I! I can raise a resistance. I have contacts there. Friends. People!"
* Alustriel is mid-way through various plans. Did at least get a rod segment from Eberron before it fell. She thinks there should be good results from Athas soon thanks to Tasha. Very close to obtaining another weapon that would be useful in "the fight". But we've "lost track of Kas". Divination doesn't work. Might just be hidden via some magical artefact though.
* Brings things to us - the Children of Fate, splitting, hidden people. We tell our story.

After the telling, Oswen realises - we have just told a large number of people (including pre-evil Tasha!) that this "splitting" magic exists and *who* can explain how it works. At this Alustriel offers to remove it from memory. The group has to agree; Oswen is shown the Modify Memory spell; Tasha is understandably reluctant. Alustriel will use it on the others, the Oswen on Alustriel. Our party would rather not know either, but the knowledge was from too long ago to remove.

The rest of the story is told - curious, we never knew about Remos' bracelet, or were able to clean up with Erebos, or even figure out the brazier properly. As that last part is told, Oswen ARC 34 (at new level) - Circle magic. Oswen asks about how that works; we'd improvised a bit on the spot, and it kind of worked but it was very messy and very risky. The best Alustriel is able to do is tell us from where she learned it herself - "I don't know that you're going to like the answer. 'Where' is only one part of it. There is also a 'when'. The two work together. The elves refer to it as 'high magic'. It was a lot more prevalent several millennia ago. It has all but disappeared. Circle magic is the only way to achieve those levels of high magic - or at least, anything anywhere close to it!"

For most worlds, even including Sigil, the amount of magic accessible in the weave is greatly diminished because of overuse. Toril is a good example - from well before the Spell Plague. During the Crown Wars, the Weave was depleted very greatly and it never recovered. When they raised Evermeet - creating an entire land out of nothing - it destroyed huge swathes of other land. "It's nearly impossible to get to Evermeet if you're not an elf. But there is another way to learn; when another civilisation, another empire, came close to unlocking the power of High Magic..." "Netherese?" "Yes, but we know they also collapsed because of over-use."

Alustriel learned it from the Netherese. But they've been gone for about two millennia... She's not *that* old. One could "piggyback" on someone from a past time if you know the way; it means you can't affect history, change things; just listen in. She could also have used a Time Gate, very dangerous. It's not that different from what Oswen did with Alustriel's help; pulled Tasha from a dream, put her into a Simulacrum, but much more unstable because it's physically sending you back. "One could, if you were equipped for it, travel between two connected points in time. It is a roll of the die how much time you get before you're pulled back and it is not without a *considerable* level of discomfort. You of course have to be *very* careful because you could splinter yourself on a branch, another version of the multiverse if you changed anything significant."

Do we have time for that? Ha. Well, "no time would pass in this moment". But Oswen might only have anything from half a minute to several days. It's just luck-of-the-draw.

It's that or look through someone else's eyes, without their consent and using time we don't have. So assuming Oswen doesn't pass up this rare opportunity at all, the Time Gate seems the appropriate one. She turns to her party; "It's too risky for you to come - not for you, for the past itself". But Kindle insists that he swore an oath of protection. Bel says it's an opportunity to see the art and hear the music of one of Toril's greatest documented civilisations, first hand. And Inafina? "I'd sooner stay given what Oswen said, but if three of you are going, it'll be a cold day across the Nine Hells before *I* get left behind!"

"Be aware, my curiosity and hubris pulls you into peril..." says Oswen. But they insist. She smiles and says, "...and my selfishness is glad!"

The Time Gate is present in a specific place. There are three she knows of. They connect fixed points in time, but they relate to a point in space too. One crashed north of the mountains up from Icewind Dale. And a third crashed into Mythdrannor. That was the "most convenient", says Alustriel. A third is from a crashed city, in the Anauroch Desert. Perhaps the most stable and interesting but the 'other side' of it is in a difficult time - the City of Eileanar, Oswen HIS dirty 20 - a sort-of capital, but at a turbulent late time in their history, at their height but just before their fall.

Bigby has been to the area! He spent many days mapping the desert. Oswen realises it's a lot of time and effort doing this and we have more important matters. Bigby offers to let her copy the map, in case of visiting in future - sounds good. In practice he offers to let her use Detect Thoughts, to get a clearer picture. Alustriel can describe the Gate and how to use it; **if we find that there is time to get to Toril and use that Gate without compromising the wider mission, then we'll do it.**

There is to-and-fro about the Incantarium and investigating more; TL,DR no new options. Alustriel also offers that we meet her in her study some time now that she has access to her vault - she hasn't had the chance to thank us properly for our actions up to now. We thank everyone in turn, wish them well and say we'll head out to clear our heads and think, and probably spend the night somewhere out in a familiar haunt.

It seems that this time, the Eight don't have a clear plan forward. Mordenkainen thinks The Machine is significant. We had over anything else we have on it. Bigby wants to lead the giant rebellion on Toril. With that in mind, we recommend strongly to Alustriel that she lets Vi do what Vi *needs* to do; Eberron. And Otto will help with Acererak if he can.

We head out.



### That night

We wander the streets. Sigil is *busy*. Then Oswen heads to a messaging point. She messages Tea Street Transport - "specifically, Alden. Nobody else."

We didn't expect him to reach us in 5 minutes but he does! Mid-meal apparently. We're apologetic. But Oswen describes our problem; the Incantarium. And drivers often overhear interesting stuff. He can't help specifically, but he could take us to where the drivers meet. Then there are the Duskers or the Harmonium. We could try there.

We elect to start with the drivers. The Great Bazaar - we're taken on a strange course that goes around the strongest part of the torus 'curve' - "up the walls" - and we end up at what might be the largest building Oswen has ever seen. It's on the lowest level of what's called the Market Ward (we recognise some of this area). On the way, we go past the **Flame Pits** - open portals to very dangerous realms; to Pandemonium basically. For some, though, this "danger" is a natural environment. We also pass **The Gastrognome** - "The Multiverse's Greatest Dining Experience" claims a sign - but we are warned, while good, it's *very* expensive. Sigil-expensive, specifically. The destination is this huge building; a shallow dome, vast, covering a huge area; it looks almost as if it is made of bone, with decorative pillars and coloured glass areas filling holes. It might be **half a mile** in diameter and covers an almost incomprehensibly vast and complex market.

Adren takes us to a fairly innocuous looking building which has a huge rooftop bar spanning across a few blocks below with various small, swing-bridge crossings between them. Every kind of person you could think of, and many you could not, are here having drinks. Barriors are especially over-represented; these are the people we seek.

We start listening. The main question is - "Why are the Incantarium collecting magical artefacts?"; Bel starts by asking the barman. Persuasion 9+14 -> 25. We don't get *too* much but he does point to a Cambian; apparently he enjoys a drink of a viscous, crimson liquid served from an ornate crystal bottle. "The taste of broken promises! His favourite!" - he can't sell us the bottle but sells a glass for 5gp.

The Cambian is in a boastful mood, and Oswen indicates that Bel should lean into that and boost the ego. PER nat 20! Oswen slides over the drink, buttering him up; ADV Deception, *dirty* 20.

The "game" starts! Back and forth. He's trying to figure us out. Inafina insight 21; he's *almost* impressed by Oswen's theories, so we must be close to the truth but now he's toying with us. After a while, the option is raised that perhaps the Incantarium are "playing nice" with the Lady but also hedging their bets with Vecna. One way or another they hope to end up on "the right side".

There is some banter until eventually, Oswen asks outright what the Cambian wants to "win" this game. A contract; 5 souls for the answer. Oswen thinks about the nature of these creatures and this place. Cambians - lawful evil. This place - violence frowned upon; the Harmonium would come if people cause unrest. "I propose a different challenge; a trial of wits" - she casts Detect Thoughts and pushes deeper immediately. Despite magic resistance, he's caught by surprise and just below the surface reads that - improbably - this Cambian is sure that *all three* things are true.

* The Lady Of Pain allowed the Incantarium back because they can extract magic as 'raw' Spellfire - she was sure she needed to shut Sigil and its magic reserves *would* deplete
* Another thing but with more blurry details; they were being asked to feed Spellfire into a Mythalar, but what that Mythalar does, he does not know; but they must have fed enough in to satisfy the Lady Of Pain and she reopened Sigil
* They continue though to collect magic items so the Lady Of Pain needs more energy for the above two purposes *or* they are providing it to someone *else*

The Cambian is not convinced that a body such as the Incantarium, with a significant grudge against the Lady of Pain, might not be plotting against her. His confidence came from thinking he knew everything he needed to. But he's not going further - what this Mythalar is, who this other party they might be dealing with is, why the continued collection does not alert the Lady Of Pain if she didn't need them anymore.

"Five souls for an answer I already knew was not the best deal" says Oswen. "But this battle of wits was more fun. Would you accept one more drink on us, as a consolation?"

"That would be the *least* you could do!"

So we buy one more. "You will not catch me unawares again!" he says. Oswen replies, "I don't doubt it!"

He takes his drink and walks away; over his shoulder, "You do *not* play nice!"

Oswen and Inafina were mostly focused on the Cambian but Kindle has been watching reactions around us. He whispers something to Inafina - "What do you make of the one in the purple in the corner?" Inafina, insight 3+9->12, so nothing much; but Oswen has Detect Thoughts up and Inafina goes, "Over in the corner, in purple" while pretending to look at the drinks above the bar.

Surface thoughts on the purple person: "They seem a bit obvious, perhaps! But they *might* be capable". Well, whether that person is interested in our services for good or bad, it seems they might want us to do something. Another passing thought; "I can't figure out who's in charge" - and at that, Oswen strides over to the corner - much surprise thoughts - sits at the table and says, "I'm in charge. Well, we make decisions together."

He thinks "Can you hear my thoughts?"

"I'm being polite; surface only."

"I see. I'd rather you didn't."

"I'll make you a deal - you tell us what you want, I'll move the spell."

He doesn't have much choice! He says he's been sent on a mission on behalf of "beings from a plane that is looking for help". "Well there are *plenty* of those, these days." "Yes, but this one is a little special. There are five ancient dragons who have escaped with their lives - they're seeking refuge in Sigil. I can't tell you where. I can't risk revealing their whereabouts." Oswen says, "Chromatic?" "What do you mean?" "Chromatic or metallic." "They're so old, it's hard to tell".

Hmmm.

"My name's Oswen. What's yours?" "Siber" (pronounced 'Sibber').

She says, "We're trying to find out things that are important, probably vital in fact and this could just be a distraction. But on the other hand, ancient dragons might possibly know some of the things we need to find, although it does rather depend on what plane they're from. I suppose you can't tell me that?"

"I can't tell you, but they may wish to share that information with you. What are your credentials?"

That's a tricky one. He asks what we've achieved but we can't say much, it'd put us in danger! We're able to give a vague indication of a couple of things. He shows us a symbol with Minor Illusion; a palm of a hand with an eye in it. Oswen HIS 15, seen on Torril she thinks; she knows it's familiar, and then remembers from Alustriel showing it - the Cult of Vecna. At this she decides that better safe than sorry and says "I certainly do, so I think we'll be taking our leave of you."

"Wait! If you know what this is and you are here, then you *are* the kind of people who can help my benefactors."

"And what have your benefactors got to do with *that* symbol."

"That is for *them* to tell you" - and his eyes turn silver; he is channeling something; a *very* strong telepathic voice in her head:

**"This being and its minions have displaced the five of us from our world where we have important work to do. We have been replaced and we are gathering forces of resistance to take him down but we cannot do it alone and our powers are greatly curtailed back on Khorvaire."**

Oswen HIS 16; Khorvaire; not sure, but she's sure it's not a world, but not on Toril, so a continent on something else. So she answers - "What plane? Has Vecna taken another?"

**"The plane of The Siberys, a plane encircled by 13 pieces of its broken moon; enclosed; a plane of great destiny. We are the Keepers of its Prophecy; we are the circle. And until recently, also the wardens of its future. If you are able to help..."**

Siber produces a beautiful metal symbol, like a crescent moon but in pieces, sliding it across the table.

**"This is how you will be able to reach us if you are able to join our cause."**

The crescent moon is a key to a demiplane, accessed off Sigil. Oswen says it might be more about *them* joining *our* cause, but we have to check with others first. Sigil is corrupted, we fear. Oswen mentions the Incantarium and they say that their powers *here* are not curtailed like they are "back home" and if we help them, they'll help us.

Provisionally agreed!

We high-tail back to Alustriel's place. It's late - 10:30pm or later - but it's lively on the streets; bustling.



### 10:30pm, Alustriel's sanctum

At the sanctum, the door opens by itself; it "recognises" us magically now. It's quite busy inside too, with people doing Stuff; "We have news! Everyone gather in the library!"

Once gathered, we explain. But Vi doesn't believe us. It turns out that these five we barely heard of *are of Eberron* - a myth, she thought! Their magic holding the world together. She is somewhat overwhelmed. To her these are all but gods, but she doesn't believe in gods; we have to talk her off the ledge a bit. They're just dragons. And Alustriel confirms that if they talked "through" an agent, they're using "normal" magic and, again, likely just powerful creatures.

The TL;DR is that Vi will come along and we head out right now. Everyone else is busy so it seems - no time like the present, as ever.

As we're leaving, Inafina 18, Vi cares a lot and was super-keen to get to Eberron; Vi is also determined to take actions that will ensure *she* is the one who has to go to Eberron. As the others pull ahead, unusually, Inafina holds back and calls back to Vi. There's a brief heart-to-heart, but Vi - normally rational and very grounded - has become very single-minded and focused on the idea of getting to Eberron personally. She's very invested. In fact, she's probably invested to a degree that means she shouldn't be there. Inafina will just have to try and keep an eye on her!

Oswen had been given a mental image of the place the key opens. Outside, she gets hold of a Tea Street Transport driver and describes it as best she can - the person recognises it immediately and offers to take us there; Vi pays for the trip.

It's a row of bookstores and other small shops, all sort of "old town"-y. Small scale for a change; none of the monumental architecture here for whatever reason and this is part of what helped the Tea Street Transport driver to recognise the description. This place seems older than much of the rest of the city. A doorway set against the back of a garden matches what Oswen has in her mind. She looks and notices a cornerstone where there's a matching sort of other-half of a symbol. It doesn't seem to be recessed though. Quite high up; Inafina helps lift the moon we have alongside - the two match; the door shimmers and turns into a portal.

"In we go then!" says Oswen and strides forward. Inafina goes last, unsure how long the portal door will stay open without the symbol being held in place.

This is certainly a demiplane and it's very large; it feels almost like a shard of a world floating in something akin to descriptions of the Astral Sea. This main rock chunk has a natural bowl on the top surface; around it are other smaller chunks, floating somehow; the one we're on might be some 250ft in diameter.

"Hello? Is anyone here?!" shouts Bel!

Shimmering shapes appear out of Invisibility in the large bowl area before us. Two are perched at the side; one coiled at the base; one sits proudly with a foot atop a stone pillar and the fifth is stood to one side. Oswen realises that it really *is* hard to tell if they are Chromatic or Metallic; they all have a very faded kind of pearly-silver colour. Truly ancient and not like dragons she's seen before, in terms of typical features for either metallic or chromatic types which which she has any familiarity.

A voice-in-head - "We are here" - Oswen checks to see that everyone 'hears' that and they nod. Vi is recognised immediately as "A child of Khorvaire". She steps forward, nervous; "I - I am, but I have not been home in some time. I am aware that _something_ has happened."

"Do you join these four? Are you aligned? Are you for the cause?"

Oswen at this point answers with, "We are but five of many in a network that spans worlds including yours, but we have currently no presence there. We were hoping that our goals were in common and that we might be part of the *same* cause."

We try to find that common ground. We want to help them if that helps the greater plan to defeat Vecna, so need to know what they want us to do, and in turn we might get them to help us as well. Bel ADV persuasion 26 isn't the best, but we're off to a good start since they reached out to us *and* Vi is here.

They want to find people who can take the fight back to Eberron. They can't go; they're too weakened. They are happy to direct from here and provide resources. That means resources *on Eberron* that they can connect people to. They need beings to "enact their will", finding, activating and channeling whatever powers that they have - probably physical weapons directing magical or other forces, given it is Eberron - and think they still have networks active there but need to have people bridge the gap, so to speak.

Vi says, "If it were up to me I would of course agree. But it is not up to me. Perhaps it is something I need to take into my own hands..."

Oswen asks the Five, "I understand what you want. And I can make a good guess about why you want it. But do these acts just help you and maybe help Eberron, or do they help actually defeat Vecna in some way?"

They argue that weakening his hold would surely be a "net positive" for the multiverse. If we help *free* their world then they will back our efforts in turn in the greater conflict.

Inafina even with Inspo only 18 INS. No subterfuge; not being manipulative; not desperate either; trying to gather assistance but there's a big city here and many they can reach out to. So if we can't actually provide much support then there's no reason for them to waste more time on us.

* We can't promise to save a world
* We can promise to get Vi there and get started on trying
* We don't know what specifically we want from them in return
* We trust that when we do, if they can provide it they will but if they can't, that's fine and it'll be a honest answer

We'll certainly back Vi's request to go to Eberron and so with a loose accord in place, we head back to Alustriel's sanctum (with Vi now holding the crescent moon "key").

Once we're back, it's now very late. Vi doesn't see any reason to wait though so we head up to Alustriel's room. Vi knocks; Alustriel answers; we make our play; all she says, after thinking a while, is - "I will take that into consideration when I make my decision in the morning. Oh. Wait. You don't need to know *now* do you?" Vi looks grumpy but says she'll go to bed and wait for things.

Vi heads off. An awkward exchange. Inafina knows something else is going on. As the other three start to leave, Inafina stays to ask - "I'm sorry we interrupted. Was it personal or business?"

Alustriel explains that she basically just has to keep many different things going. Many people doing many things. Inafina says it must be lonely; but she's glad Alustriel is reunited with someone now who can share the burden.

"I carry this weight because I chose to. I asked to. Are you carrying your weight by choice?"

Inafina whispers, "I carry some of our weight so that *she* doesn't have to", angling her head slightly towards Oswen's direction. "After all - as far as I know, my world intact."

"I admire what the four of you have; I recognise how precious it is. I remember what it is like to be part of something so intimate and all-encompassing. I'm sure you do not need to be told that it can be a source of immense strength; but for those who have the shrewd awareness to exploit, I can tell you from first-hand experience that it can also be a crippling weakness unless you know exactly how to face it... How to decouple those threads and remove the power that someone can wield over you should they choose to exploit that deep connection between all of you. In short, perhaps an analogy that might resonate a bit more with you than maybe others - *remain fluid and flow like the air and the water, be unpredictable, adapt to your situations* - a very wise Tabaxi once told me that. It has served me well, even if some of my actions can be seen as cold and calculating as a result!"

Back in our room, Inafina doesn't talk about that conversation but does say - "For the Incantarium. Whatever we do, we should make it unexpected. Strange. Perhaps even weird. If nothing else, we need to remain unpredictable if we can."

(But she knows in her heart that we are all predictable in our own ways and those things could be used against us, so would we let go of what we considered immutable, key parts of ourselves to escape such manipulation? Would we, for example, walk away from saving a group of innocents if that was a trap specifically set to doom our mission?)

We chat more about *what* we're doing. Why does Oswen want this info about the Incantarium and what would we do with it if we got it.

* Lots of very clever people in Sigil yet nobody knows.
* It boils down for Oswen that - if the Lady Of Pain has enough power to guard against Vecna and stay open, could we use that same technology? - or more importantly, if they're working with Vecna can we interfere with it?
* So the question becomes - is the Incantarium work with Vecna?
* Divination - but that means a god must know the answer - there are no gods here.
* So Divination would do nothing in theory. Oswen tries it. Nothing! A very strange response. There really *are* no gods here!
* That means anyone could do any kind of shady things here without fear of Divination / gods knowing.
* Wait, so the whole of Sigil is **packed with secrets** - one of the most important and interesting places that Vecna could possibly imagine.
* **How would he "use" those secrets if he can't get in?** Sigil was closed to stop his agents getting in and using doorways, but not to stop Vecna himself; since he rose to godhood he was blocked by the magic fundamentally (which also confirms Vecna is not god-like; he is *actually* a god as far as whatever universal magic is going on in Sigil is concerned).

We'll have to sleep on it!
