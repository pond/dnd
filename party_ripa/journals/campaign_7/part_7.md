# RIPA: Part 7
## Session 7 (2023-06-13)
### Day 5, approaching 3pm

We're at the 'tavern' in the druid circle with Eloise and company.

Thorin's at the bar, while Penny, Francesc and Arturo have finished business with Eloise and Penny follows Francesc to the bar. Arturo too - but he distrusts the druids' alcohol so doesn't drink. There's a bit of an air of celebration, since Cassee and the green dragon have aid and - hopefully - the children will be safe and reach home.

"The drinks are on her, there!" says the barman, pointing to someone who waves on the balcony - she waves, raises a drink to us. Roundish face, curly black quite long hair, burly, sat down but looks probably tall. She calls over, "Heard you did a good job stopping the hunters so we thank you for that!"

Penny asks the bartender who she is. "A friend of one of our regulars - been throwing drinks around a bit today, I think they're pretty happy, had some good outcomes one way or another. She comes in and out, let's just say... She's a close friend, as I understand it, of one of our enclave who isn't here right now but should be back soon."

We grab a spare table on the balcony. We can see the next balcony, where our drinks "benefactor" is sat. "Thanks!" shouts Penny. "Don't mention it. Next round's on you though!"

"Where next?" asks Penny.

There is some to-and-fro. We figure that we don't really know what "Vallin" was up to, and there's a risk they might keep looking for the kids - or us! - again. That road takes us to the Dwarven city en route (since Green Spider was mentioned there) and, after that, Neverwinter.

We're overheard. A chap sidles up to us, saying he's heading that way soon; asks when we're going. Probably tomorrow, after some rest, we think? Francesc asks his name; he's called **Ed**. Ed is dressed in rather outgoing clothes - open shirt, leather vest, brown leather pants; not a druid, talks about getting on stage. "A bard then?" "Yes. A performer. A singer! A composer of words - a recorder of the rhythm and music of the universe."

"No. Nope! Nope Ed. We're not taking extra baggage..." says the lady on the adjacent balcony, from which Ed had walked. She seems quite sceptical - doesn't want more people to protect... And so-on. Penny tries to be pursuasive; 17+6 -> 23. Ed responds. "There's a long delayed reunion that needs to be done and some apologies that need to be made... But she's right. There are other things to do along the way and - well - I guess we might see you there. But if you're feeling in a helpful mood, can you keep an eye out for our friend when she turns up and please, *please* - however you do it! - convince her to go to Neverwinter with you."

Ed says he's going because he needs to rescue his daughter!

He describes his friend - "you'll recognise her by her horns! Her name is **Doric**." Penny guesses that she is probably a Tiefling. "A bit of an eco terrorist! She feels like she'll have to stay here, with her circle." The woman says they need her as a spy; she can "become really small" - Thorin enquires about that - yes, she can be a spider, a fly; or even, a horse if she wanted.

The woman says to Ed, "We really need to go!"

Arturo asks where we'll meet them in Neverwinter - the **Purple Penants**.

He offers 100gp! Penny insight 1+2 on that (!) - she believes 100gp are indeed in the offering. Francesc's insight is much better; he seems genuine, the money is real. Seems good-hearted, but like he's fucked up in life before. We agree to try. Arturo is very pursuasive and gets 50gp as a downpayment! But now, we're committed. We split it - 12gp, 5sp each.

The woman slams down her drink, picks up her greataxe, burps and says "Come on kid! Let's go!" - she thows a lute at him, which he catches. They start to leave and, as they do, a sheepish-looking, short black curly-haired young man with a staff and cape, who had been hidden around the balcony at the far side from us, shuffles along after them, looking a bit dejected and playing with a coin between his fingers.

"Keep your part of the bargain!" Ed shouts as he leaves.

We finish our free round, then get another one - 4sp - Penny gives up waiting for Thorin and pays for it. During the second one, Eloise turns up - she thinks things are sorted; 6 kids have somewhere to sleep, the will head on to Triboar; the two from the hunters are on their way back to their parents. We ask about merchants - there's a fletcher and a leatherworker, to which Eloise directs us.

Penny asks Eloise about Doric; she's not too forthcoming. Neverwinter is Doric's "public enemey #1" as there's a new government, and they're cutting down forests. Penny is alarmed at that - at least she and Doric might have something in common! Eloise at least agrees to help get Doric en route, though there's even less of a guarantee that she'll go all the way.

For now - to the fletcher! Thorin stays at the bar.

He's a middle-aged half-elf. It's a bit of a tricky climb up a tree, no steps, but we make it. He's on a platform when we arrive, making arrows. "**Darren!** Someone here to peruse your wares!" says Eloise. Francesc shows her bow. Darren approves. He doesn't have anything mechanincally better; but Francesc is interested more in arrows anyway. There's a choice between raven, goose or grouse feathers, sold in bolts of 20, all the same price. "Goose!" says Francesc - white, blue and grey; she goes with blue.

She asks about more special kinds; silver-tipped or something? No, but he has two made of a kind of hardwood. He sells those as singles. They aim more true and fly more fast, piercing things where other arrows might fail. Mechanically, a +1 arrow, counting as magical. 20gp each though! A standard bolt of 20 would be 1gp.

Arturo turns on the charm, trying to haggle a lower price... Persuasion 17+6 -> 23. We're interested in both special arrows; if we buy the two, he'll also give us *two* bundles of normal arrows. Not quite the discount we were looking for... Ah, never mind, it's a decent deal. Penny stumps up 20gp, Francesc the same. He gives her a bag of additional really good feathers and says he'll show Francesc how to make her *own* arrows, just normal ones, but she'll never have to buy her own again. Penny hangs around and watches, while Arturo goes back to the bar to wait for Doric, rejoining Thorin.

### 4:30pm

By now, Francesc is nearly done and Penny is back at the bar. Penny checks in with Thorin - is he OK? He's been sleeping a lot and keeping to himself a bit, so is he OK? But Thorin says he's fine - that's just how he is! That's useful; he's not annoyed, he just keeps to himself.

Stomping noises. Crash! Things are thrown onto the floor. Someone in green and brown mottled tight-fitting leather armour with pauldrins, bright reddish-orange hair almost shoulder length but messy - and two twisting horns. She's wiry, maybe 5'3" and dragging a net bag behind her that has a bunch of helmets, shields, axes and so-on behind her, which she'd thrown into the room ahead of her as she came up.

"A *big* glass of mead please!" - kicks the sack of metal - "and not that any of you want anything made of metal, but if anyone's headed to the filthy city, they can sell these for me!"

Penny offers to buy the drink. "Might you be Doric?" asks Arturo. "Yes! Who, what - ..." "We've been referred by your musical friend." "Oh. Edgin. He's given you the task of getting me to go to the devil city?" "Yes." "The answer is no!" "Well that was quick" says Arturo. Another mead is poured. She pays for that one! "Right. Fine. Tell Doric your woes!"

Arturo tells the story. He amps up the heroism and stresses how it's about disrupting the operations that are hurting the forest, which means you've got to get to the heart of the organisation and stop it here...

Persuasion - Arturo almost got her on the bad side by suggesting her methods in the forest might not be the most effective, so he's suggesting an alternative. Penny chips in, "What you've got to do is get to the people giving the orders and stop *them*" - "By shooting them in the face!" says Francesc as she walks in, finished with the Fletcher. Arturo's persuasion roll is 25 against a rolled DC of 22.

Doric invites us to see the destruction. See if we'll still want to go to Neverwinter. We'd do that, no problem; but Eloise suggests at least getting as far as an encampment along the way. We hear that this is where the **Talosians** live - who worship **Talos** - **Gorthok The Thunderboar**, a lightning boar not thunder (!). Ah. Right, we were on the edge of that territory apparently and we remember something about lightning boars. They kill anyone who comes into their territory - Doric doesn't agree with that (and neither do we) - aaaaand, on the conversation goes.

It seems we're making progress - and eventually Doric wants to walk us to the edge of destruction. It'll take about 3 hours, so we're probably going to be sleeping in the forest. Back on the ground, we're greeted again by centaur Korthod who bids us farewell and we thank him for helping with the kids.

Doric leads the way. Eloise comes along too, eventually turning into a bird to keep up more easily with our pace. It's an uneventful trip, through thicker forest. We're not slowed by the difficult terrain thanks to so many druids and rangers in our group now.

### 7:30pm

Twilight.

A beautifully thick part of the forest - the path climbs, beautiful trupmet-shaped flowers in all kinds of colours, colourful birds with long tails, croaking of twilight frogs. Up ahead, as we approach a ridge, we see light on the horizon above. Highest passive perception is Penny and Thorin (17) who notice Doric getting more stressed. Her hands are clenched. She stops talking. We reach the top of the ridge and realise the source of the light - very large camp fires.

We look down, with vast swathes of devastation. Trees right up to the river are cut down. The river is filled with barges carrying logs. The trees here must be 300-400 years old, but just cut away without any care. Useful wood is felled, then it looks like the undergrowth is burned to help drag logs out. Encampments are set up, with various tents, lots of equipment, axes, hand saws and so-on.

Doric is silent as she stares, then eventually says, "This was forest three weeks ago."

"All of *this* in three weeks?!" asks Francesc, shocked.

"I'm thinking we could sneak in and 'borrow' all their tools... Slow 'em down a bit..." says Penny. But of course - the point is, they'd just be replaced in a day or two.

We hear a sound in the undergrowth. A wolf's face appears; white fur; it looks at us, then a person walks out from the shadows nearby. "I was wondering who it was here... Eloise. Doric." They respond, "**Falcon**." He nods to them "Welcome. Evening. What are you - what are you doing? What's going on?"

Turns out he was tailing a small band of Talosians who were headed this way - thougth he'd run ahead and warn the enampment that they're coming. The Talosians would kill them; if we warn them, it'll clear the camp out - job done!

So we run down. The wolf is sent somewhere off to the right. Doric calls over, "How far ahead, exactly, were you from the Talosians?!" "A few minutes...". **We run faster!**

Athletics - Penny *another* nat 1; trips on a tree root; stumbles and kind of falls down the hill. Falls behind a bit. Arturo and Francesc are fine, Thorin is a bit slow. Francesc waits for Penny - "thanks! Armour, running, tree roots, bad..."

We get to the edge of the woods. Surprised faces in the nearest tent turn. They yell at us "nature terrorists!" and reach for weapons. Arturo yells, "The thunderboar is coming! Run for your lives!" - but at that very moment there's a huge crash as a bolt of lightining smashes into the ground. Too late.

Spears come flying out from the edge of woods. One worker is killed outright. Another is pinned down by the leg.

Initiative:

* Francesc 20+5 -> 25
* Throin 16
* Arturo 14
* Penny 5-1 -> 4

Running out from the forest, we see 3 orcs emerging. Conflict seems inevitable. Flashes of lighting and strange magic is happening just behind, in the forest.

Francesc assesses things and decides she's got to at least try and tackle the orcs. Favoured foe, slugs; fires at the lead orc. Attack roll 12; it goes wide. She puts Hunters Mark on an orc in the middle of the pack.

A war cry comes from behind the orcs; crashing out from the forest, with a strange greenish-black bolt of energy cast at someone trying to run away, is another orc; no metal; carries a staff and a hat of horns - perhaps a druid? It speaks in a language none of us understand (Orcish). It puts down a truncheon it was carrying, pushes both hands into the earth and starts chanting - sounds like some kind of invocation is being started.

Falcon pulls out a longbow, runs out and starts to try and lay down cover fire to help people in the camp escape and engage with anyone chasing. The wolf is called in close to an orc; Falcon calls a warning to us; "Watch out! That's an **Ancorite**! Don't get too close -  they pack a punch and have a mean bite. At least, you don't want to find out..." - at this, one of the orcs runs up and throws a javelin at Falcon, but misses.

Thorin runs up and tries to deflect the same orc by casting Entangle. It fails to avoid it and becomes restrained by the rapidly-growing area of vines and shrub that spring up. Next, Arturo throws a Mind Whip at the Anchorite. It succumbs, but only takes 7 damage; it's somewhat stunned for a while, at least.

Suddenly, approaching from behind him and running through the tangled vines of Thorin's spell as if they weren't even there, is another anchorite; he shapes the plants ahead of him, moving them aside. The magic is yellowish-green - sickly. He steps on and crushes one of the woodsmen (ugh!) that had been hiding in a tent - "Stay out of our woods! You're not welcome here!" then looks to us. "Do you understand me when I speak Common? Are you here to *help* us rid the forest of these destroyers who would encroach upon Talos's sacred domains? Or are you here to oppose us?" and Penny shouts, "We want to scare the workmen away, but not kill them - that will only bring more!" "Not kill them?! Let them bring their war to us! We will crush them under the wave of thunder that is Talos's might. Are you afraid? Are you weak?"

Penny tries to convince, with Arturo's help - 10,11+6->17. Not enough.

The new arrival releases a spell. Rotted trunks, vines and more are all pulled together into a shape that emerges as a Shambling Mound!

Doric runs forward towards the orc that attacked Falcon. She jumps as she approaches, turning into a large owlbear! The claw hits for 14 damage; the beak hits for 10; that takes the orc down. Eloise casts Fog Cloud, trying to help people escape.

The shambling mound has bits of lighting arcing across it from the magic used in its creation, but they dissipate and fade. It slowly moves forward. It approaches falcon's wolf and attacks. Both hits meet their mark - and the wolf is *engulfed*, whimpering, as it is pulled in. Falcon yells, "No! **Benji!**"

An orc from near the back clears the entangled area and throws a javelin at Doric, which hits; 6 damage. Then yet *another* orc emerges from the treeline and rushes up to Doric, hitting with a greataxe for 9 damage.

Penny runs forward; on the way past she casts Shield of Faith on Doric; continues with full dash towards the shambling mound, having seen the wolf be consumed; a third orc runs up to attack Doric and *also* hits, for a hefty 11 damage.

Suddenly appearing out of the ground - a blight! Made of vines, it appears out of the ground near the shambling mound. It approaches Doric, but can't attack yet; but it sends out grasping roots and vines for a 15ft radius, making things difficult terrain for Doric and two nearby orcs. Doric is grappled by the effect.

Francesc just manages to get a hit in on the orc with Hunter's Mark - 14 damage.

The first anchorhite is still bound by the Entangle spell, so tries to break free. Nat 20! Breaks free. Takes up position near the shambling mound.

Falcon aims at the mound and fires. 9 damage. Maybe mild injury?! He calls to the wolf. "Benji!" then "Eloise! Doric! Get Benji out! *Someone!*"

Thorin's up. Runs up to Doric & casts Enhance Ability, for Bear's Endurance, mostly for the 2d6 hit points - 10 added. Then he turns into a large Dire Wolf!

Arturo moves close to the fray near Doric & casts Bless - Blessings Of The Fey on Doric, Penny and Falcon, to add a d4 to any attack roll or saving throw so long as the spell is up; then retreats behind Thorin's dire wolf.

The other anchorite looks straight up to the sky, then looks across the field of combat and casts Lightning Bolt. It goes straight through the shambling mound, hitting the wolf and doric but misses Arturo thanks to hiserecent movement. 8d6->25 damage. The shambling mound *was* injured - but is now *healed* for 25hp. The wolf yelps, then falls silent and is dropped by the mount. Doric tries to dodge the worst of it and succeeds, only taking 12 damage.

Doric is angry! She wants to charge in her owlbear form to try and reach the anchorite, but can't break the vine grapple. She has a remaining attack and hits the orc (depsite disadvantage) which Francesc had Hunters Marked; hits; takes it down.

Eloise casts Healing Word on the wolf. Penny shouts, "Oi! I was going to do that!". A remaining orc near Doric moves into attack Thorin, in Dire Wolf form. It misses. Penny runs in, the wolf healed anyway and attacks the Mound. She hits for 7 damage, plus 10 radiant damage from a Divine Smite.

The second remaining orc runs up to Falcon and attacks; he's hit, taking 11 damage from a greataxe. The vine blight in front of Doric attacks her, trying a constriction attack; thanks to the +2 AC, it can't quite manage it (rolls 13, matching AC without Shield Of Faith modifier).

Francesc moves to get line of sight on the more recently arrived Anchorite. Hunters Mark is transferred, attack hits! Favoured Foe. 12+2+4+5->23 damage. It seems surprised!

From the other anchorite, another lighting bolt arcs through Doric and hits Thorin, too, though falls short of reaching Francesc. 31 damage potential; Thorin dodges it with style (nat 20!) and takes only 15 damage. Doric, disadvantaged due to grapple, despite bless, gets hit for the full 31 - she's clinging on as an Owlbear.

Falcon drops his bow and switches to longsword, attacking the orc in front *three* times - crit, hit (with bless), hit. It is eviscerated. He heads for the anchorites.

Dire Wolf Thorin tries to bite (with Pack Tactics advantage) the orc in front of it. Hits, thanks to the advantage; 8 damage and the orc is knocked prone. He leaps dramatically over everything in his way (as Dire Wolf, athl 18) right into melee range of the two Anchorites, close to one so that its body blocks line of sight from the other.

Arturo tries to get some fire onto the Mound, so shoots a Firebolt - but misses (nat 1), blows Tides Of Chaos, 16+mod -> hits for 2 fire damage. The shambling mound only takes 1!

The first anchorite reaches down to a dead orc in front of him - and casts Revivify!

Owlbear Doric stamps on the prone orc! 14 damage; the orc is killed. As this is happening, Penny shouts, "Get closer to me if you can!" and meanwhile Doric attacks the Vine Blight with a bite attack. She hits, dealing 11 damage. The grapple is released and Doric moves a bit closer to Penny.

(Meanwhile, the wolf, very injured, runs to Falcon's side).

Eloise runs in and heals Doric for 11 damage. Penny shouts, "Oi! I was going to do *that* as well!"

The shambling mound tries to slam into Penny, two attacks. The first misses and Penny isn't engulfed, but the second hits for 13 damage. Con save, dirty 20 - shield stays up.

The revivified orc moves to try and attack Thorin. It hits for 13 damage. He's injured, but still a Dire Wolf.

Penny moves between the Mound and Doric to heal for 10hp. She uses her Harness Divine Power to get back a spell slot, too.

The vine blight tries to constrict Doric again but fails.

Francesc strafes sideways to try and get another hit on the second anchorite. There's a needle to thread between Doric and the vine blight, 1/4 cover, but the attack rolls is a nat 1 sadly! Thorin lends inspiration to Francesc for a sharp reversal of fortune - 19+9->28 attack, hits obviously, damage is 10+2+7->19. The anchorite is really injured, but still up.

The other, first-appearing anchorite casts Thunderwave. It hits Thorin & Falcon, potential 12 damage; con saves; Thorin and Falcon both take the full 12 and are pushed back 10ft. Thorin drops back to dwarf form, but is at least not immediately in melee range of the orc.

Falcon dashes in again, in front of Thorin, to tackle the orc; hits ("this time, stay dead!") - it drops - then the first anchorite, hitting twice thanks to Bless; 1d10+2->10 damage, twice. The wolf runs up to harry the same anchorite, hopefully helping Falcon with future accounts.

Thorin moves around and uses L2 Earth Tremor, dex 14 save; they both make it, but the earth is disturbed and the ground becomes Difficult Terrain, which *does* affect the anchorites. As a bonus action, Thorin wildshapes once more, this time as a brown bear.

Arturo runs right up to the Shambling Mound - then Misty Steps, close to Thorin and throws a firebolt at the more injured, second anchorite. Hits, for 9 fire damage; he's down!

Owlbear Doric hits the vine blight twice for 21 damage; the vine blight falls.

Eloise says, "I know you hate me but just *be careful*!" and throws a Healing Word at Penny for hp ("Thank you!") and runs towards the remaining anchorite.

The shambling mound attacks Penny. Misses, hits; 10 damage. Penny retaliates, moving around so that the Mound could be flanked by Doric if she wishes, and manages to hit (thanks to Bless) doing 15 damage, including another Divine Smite.

Francesc fires at the remaining anchorite and hits for 20 damage. In response it tries Thunderwave again, hitting brown bear Thorin, Falcon and the wolf. Con saves all round, DC 12. Thorin saves taking only 1 damage and not being pushed back, Falcon and the dog fail taking 3 and being pushed back 10ft. Falcon for a second time exclaims, "Oh for fuck's sake!" and attacks the anchorite; hit, hit, hits thanks to bless. The anchorite falls. Penny calls, "Good work, a little help here?!"

Thorin turns and moves the short distance to the Mound, attacking; bite hits for 11; but the claws just miss. Arturo tries a mind whip! (Wild magic surge roll - 19, regains Tides Of Chaos with no ill effects). Int save, failed by the Mound, 3d6->9 damage. Doric now moves in, taking advantage (literally) of the flanking setup that Penny created. Hits twice, 24 damage total.

Eloise looks around. Everyone seems fine. Produces Sheleighla! Runs in to hit the Mound, then runs away (since Arturo's mind whip means it's temporarily incapable of opportunity attacks) - but just misses.

The Mound attacks Thorin. Hits for 13; then crits!; but the big bear is too large to engulf; 4d8->23 damage. Drops back to Thorin & 2hp damage carries over. Penny, flanking with Doric, hits the mound with another divine smite, but it's only 11 damage in total this time.

Francesc moves Hunters Mark to the Mound and fires. Hits, for a whopping 21 damage. It's *almost* down! Falcon runs in - nat 1, nat 1 (!) and finally a hit. 9 damage. Not *quite* enough.

Thorin moves in and hits it with a stick. Hits, 8 damage. Still up - "Yes!" exclaim Francesc and Penny, fearing they'd never hear the last of it if Thorin took the creature down...

Arturo tries firebolt but misses...

Doric attacks with Penny still in flanking position; hits with the claws; 16 damage - that's it. The creature is shredded into a pile of twigs and vines.

Done!

### Level 4 by Milestone

Penny looks over the pile of vegetation at Owlbear Doric. "So as guardians of the forest, whatever our approach, we can fight amongst ourselves or take the fight to the city. Your call!"

Doric turns back into her tiefling form. "The four of you picked a side and you fight with spirit and with heart. I guess - goddammit, Edgin gets the last word after all! I will come with you into the smelly, horrible, crowded, filthy, rotten city!"

Eloise and Penny (using rest of her hands-on pool, no spell slots left) run around healing and bringing back-from-brink as many of the townspeople as we can - so that we can send them on their way, duly warned!

Arturo investigates; inedible mushrooms on the mound, nothing more. A truncheon from an orc. Thorin, on an anchorite, finds a rather unusual-looking necklace - a silvery-looking chain and something that emanates some kind of magic. Thorin, nat 20 -> arcana 24! It is an Amulet Of The Devout; uncommon. It requires attunement by either a Cleric or Paladin. He figures out (nat 20) that this amulet there's a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and saving DCs; Channel Divinity can be used once per day extra. Thorin and Penny bargain for a while before Thorin gives it to Penny. Thanks Thorin!

(End of part 7)
