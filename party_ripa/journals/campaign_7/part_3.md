# RIPA: Part 3
## Session 3 (2023-04-25)
### Day 3, 9-9:30am

After our rest, the caravan is a long way away. At least we're feeling much better! (Hit dice rolled, taking everyone to max).

A shadow passes above - not a dragon, a large bird - which drops, rather unceremoniously drops Penny - THUD, not a graceful landing (athl 7+4->11) 1hp damage. The bird then morphs into a small halfling - it's Eloise. "Right. Yeah. We figured that was probably you guys, even with the hoods on. I found one of yours!"

* Penny got to Ondin & got the message
* Bumped into the red panda / Eloise
* Explained the situation & she agreed to "deliver" me to the group

Penny can see the mystery new clothing; blood stains; new cart - doesn't take much to figure out what's happened. "You *do* realise that short of the Long Road this is the busiest track within 100 miles radius?! Good thing there's no law here!"

Eloise helped partly because things seem to be escalating. The poachers are mobilising more. Francesc agrees to swap out and help - "You're headed into town and I don't care for towns..." so she'll head the circuitous route through Neverwinter Wood rather than travelling with us on the road. She hands over the Cloak Of Elvenkind in case any of us need it.

Penny jumps onto the wagon & we start on the road. Arturo and Thorin fill her in on details. Penny asks about the kidnapped daughters - pursuing a poacher chain is all good, but the only way she convinced the other poachers to stand down and was eventually confident she could leave them, moving onto Ondin. "We're working our way up the chain!" says Arturo; certainly, there was nothing much to see in Ondin and the poachers all seemed to be heading *away* from there, as if a most-distant pickup point, or close to it.

Thorin drives. Animal handling 20; Bruiser is very compliant. Arturo sits on the back of the wagon watching for anyone following. Perception 18. Nobody for the 1st hour follows, but later a couple on horseback appear in view, galloping - look like messengers though - they pass through.

Progress is good; we think we'll reach Phandalin by mid-afternoon. Feeling hungry, Arturo investigates (19) the wagon and finds the "borrowed" backpack - there are some packets of cooked food, rations basically. There are also two potatoes in his own bag. It's easily enough for the three of us. He swaps over with Penny; she is on "watch", but perception 4+2->6, she seems very distracted with the mysterious potatoes and is trying to figure out how Arturo's bag works!

Arturo keeps searching and finds another copy of the same list Francesc is carrying. If more than one of them had their own copy - with the same crossings-out - then it *must* be important. There's also **a slip of paper with an address** on it - but doesn't mention a town name. "**16 Oak Avenue**".

We decide that if we're going to sneak in anywhere, we'll do it together. Arturo says Penny should have the cloak; he's fairly stealthy and Thorin can become e.g. a spider. She attunes during the journey (another reason to not be paying too much attention on watch).

Without any drama, we reach the outskirts Phandalin. Penny has some idea of this place from prior travels (history 19-2->17). Forest around has been cleared. A caravan is seen pulled into an out-of-town area that avoids fees. We decide that rather than any kind of more complex deception, we'll put on the cloaks - so that we look at a glance like the original wagon owners - and rid into town, looking to see if we can find the warehouse. We have the animal parts anyway.

### 3pm

Penny's surprised as we get close to town. The pictures she's seen - not visited, but heard of it and so-on - but it's under heavy construction. Work crews at the edges are constructing new buildings or expanding existing ones. Piles of wood; wood scaffolds; lots of activity. Some big blocks of stone in some areas with dwarves amongst the crews which Thorin hasn't seen much of that kind of thing outside dwarven nations.

There's a large cleared area with a big construction area next to a beautiful 3-storey building. From pictures, there was nothing of that size - not even a full church. Pictures Penny had seen since were a few years old though.

The road becomes paved. An old farmhouse to the left, dropping down, stables on the right with a small market; further on the left, a 2-storey building: "**Barthen's Provisions**". There's a square of roads in the middle of town that looks like a central junction. More 2-storey buildings and one, much larger, "**Stone Hill Inn**" with its own stables.

Penny can't really figure out (perception 4+2->6 again!) where a warehouse might be. Thorin tries to pull over and strike up a conversation with some of the construction dwarves; stone cutting is part of his trade after all. He asks about warehouses - construction warehouses are in one direction (kind of to the right near a lot of new construction), but grain and so-on warehouses - general storage - is more or less right in the middle of town, and they figure that's just a historic thing and they'll get moved out of town soon.

We're told to talk to **Tolbin** - who can be found via the Town Hall, now renamed City Hall! - if we want to find out more about jobs related to construction / the mines. **Arturo asks about Oak Street**; they think a while but the point to a hill on the other side of town to the left, a few houses, climbing up to a larger building on the hill. Narrow but long, 2-storey. We're told it used to be a manor of some sort, abandoned for a while but fixed up now, not by their crew. We thank them and as we leave they call out a recommendation for a good tavern for dwarven ale.

We figure we'll head left, towards the silo/trade warehouses. We go around the back of Stone Hill Inn. The layout is really odd and definitely gives an impression of rapid expansion without enough planning. A couple of blocks later, we reach two large warehouses on either side of the street. Doors are open and people are moving around. Penny tries to look as the wagon goes by slowly; perception 21. Thorin too - 18.

On the left, very close to the ground, near a large weed - almost a bush really! - there is the barely-visible mark we'd been told about. Tree with a line through.

The doors are open; there are people inside; nobody seems to be wearing cloaks like us, but there are workers moving things around. Crates. There's a cart. A couple of animals.

It's starting to look weird - curb-crawling past the warehouse! - so we all agree; we're going in.

Thorin, animal handling: 6! It's a rather abrupt turn, the horse sort of pulling the wagon around spinning on the inside wheel. *That* gets attention. Penny shouts, "It's a good thing you hunt better than you drive a cart!" to try and distract.

We can now clearly count. 4 people, 2 animals. "We're here for the delivery" says Arturo; "in the back". "All right. Pull into the usual place." Arturo says, "This horse is being disobedient - please can you walk it in?" Persuasion is only 10, but it seems enough. "Just this once!" says the guy, yanking on the reins. We're asked to get off the wagon & all jump off, walking with him.

In a corner of the warehouse, a busier area by the looks of it, he leaves us to unload ourselves and walks off. "I'm not gonna help you unload - I've got my own shit to do. We'll be back shortly. Just get it done!"

Penny and Thorin (insight 4, 6 respectively!) are *sure* the guy bought our story...

Arturo starts unloading. Penny helps. At one point Arturo tries to peek under a tarp. Penny helps by blocking the view of him with her own body and a sack she's carrying (good thing too, his first sleigth-of-hand check was a nat 1! Advantage yields 22). There are a few crates here, under the tarp. A weird smell. Arturo can't quite figure out what it is.

After looking around we realise it's all high risk. Daylight, doors wide open, warehouse across the road that can see what's going on in here. Instead of anything aggressive, we finish unloading. We start to leave with the cart, Thorin intending to turn into a spider. "Hey!" shouts someone, though. "You forgot something?!" Arturo shouts, "We're on a tight schedule!" (deception 14) "Excuse me. Really?! Too tight, to take your pay?" Arturo responds "...ah, shit, you got me. We forgot!" - and we're given 5gp. "Don't spend it all at once" says the guy; "Don't tell the tavern master that we have it!" retorts Arturo.

Penny the reins (animal handling 19+4->23) as Thorin wildshapes into a spider. Thorin makes it inside just as someone comes out from one of the piles of goods after speaking with the person who paid us. This other person nods and walks towards the office where Thorin was heading; if his little spider legs run as fast as they can, he'll be able to get to the office at roughly the same time. He goes for it and just makes it inside by scuttling under the ill-fitting door.

Once inside, perception 10; the guy comes inside a moment later, flips through a book of ledgers, writes something in it, closes the book and walks out. Thorin didn't quite get time to be in a position to read what they wrote. The book's right there on the table, but closed.

At first, Thorin tries to open the book as a spider - 5-4->1 athl check -> clearly, this does not work. Next he tries making his way up to the rafters to target the book cover with a web attack. 13; the web gets onto the leading edge of the cover of the ledger. It's not anything that could attack a person but if this can be used to just get the cover open, it'll be enough. Adv athl is still only 9, but DM generosity - the book flips open, but the cover thumps down on the table in the open position. He doesn't know if anyone heard.

Quickly, Thorin scuttles back down and tries to flip through pages to find the most recent entry page.

* The final entry says; **Conybery: Paid 5gp**
* Next, **Triboar: Paid 10gb**
* Next, **Longsaddle: Paid 5gp**

(We later check and see that this does *not* match the list we picked up earlier - nothing like Rainbow Serpent, Sea Unicorn, or Mushroom Ring).

At this point, Thorin perception 14. Spidey-sense says someone is heading into the room - must have heard the noise. The spider scuttles away - book left open. He gets out, fortunately.

Penny and Arturo have ridden down the road not too far, but then stopped, feigning an argument about which inn to stay at. Thorin rejoins having found a quiet spot to turn back into himself & catches up quickly.

Well, I guess we own a draft horse and a cart now. We decide to head back to the caravan outside of town, because that's a place we can leave our cart and horse without fees and perhaps talk to other people to find out maybe more information. We take off the cloaks.

As we ride, Arturo drops down for a moment to investigate our cart. Does it have the "tree killer" symbol on it? Investigation 17. Yes! He finds one. Small, painted, just under the cart on a plank near the edge. He scratches it off with his dagger.

We head out of town again to the caravan park. The ornate dwarven wagon isn't there, one or two other ones missing so the group is smaller, but it's still a fairly sizeable number. We talk about options.

* Arturo thinks our only lead is the people at the warehouse. Tail one - the manager? - to their home, then "politely question" them at 3am?
* 16 Oak Street - the manor - is another option.

We at least spend some time parking up at the edge of the wooded area near where the caravans stopped, setting up the "sail" that the bad guys used as a privacy screen to create a camp of sorts. Then we figure we should at least try to tail someone from the warehouse for that to be an option at all.

### 5pm

We get back to the warehouse. Across the road, Arturo makes out that he's looking for work (Thorin - can say he's considering construction; Penny, defence). Suddenly, ripping through town a cloaked rider - galloping - stops between the two warehouses and runs inside. There are sounds of shouting and an altercation. The three non-managers end up pushing someone outside, the rider; "You're crazy woman! You're crazy!" and she's saying, "No you need to leave!" "No you MUST listen to me! I know that you have it. I've ridden for four days and I KNOW that it's in here. You don't know what you're playing with!"

Penny draws her sword and steps confidently forward between the two groups. "What seems to be the problem?" - acting all Town Guard like. Fortunately, Penny isn't recognised. The warehouse people rant, and we make out that we'll take care of it and restore order. Penny says "I'll take her to City Hall and get this all sorted out." Arturo is being persuasive, Thorin gets the horse and we wrestle with her until out of earshot. Penny's persuasion is only 14; Arturo is more persuasive (21) so she agrees.

We explain briefly that we're on her side and we need somewhere to talk. We head to a tavern; "**The Grinning Cat**". It's large - not a smaller craft beer place that was recommended by the dwarves. The sign, in stone above the door, looks as if it might've been reworked; used to say "The Grinning Dwarf"! (Thorin perception 21).

A dozen or so tables inside, quieter corners, rooms off to the side. Penny goes to the bar. Asks the barman, "You got a private room? No eavesdroppers. Ale and food." "Sure. You'll have to pay in advance though." "OK" "2gp". Paid.

Once inside, we're able to relay the story. The woman's name is **Cassee Dannell**, a half-elf professor of anthropology. She used to work - a long position - in Silverymoon at the University. She was involved as a consultant on an archaeological dig. They found some amazing discoveries; but the dig site was attacked and robbed. One of the assistants was killed! They took something very, very important. "What was it?" asks Penny. "OK, look..."

(There's a pause as the food & drink arrives - awkward silences all round)

"...I'll tell you where I was. We thought it was an old dwarven civilisation, a ruin. But it connected to much older caverns. We found something - the area is known as **Murkmire**; connects to an old swamp. I think this thing we found was petrified in it - but not actually dormant. **I believe it is the egg of a very rare type of dragon called a gem dragon.** It just looks like an amazingly large gem, very ornate, very beautiful, but I'm almost certain it's a viable egg. I was going to take it back and convince my old colleagues to help me study it, but... Well we lost it. They have it. I tried to catch up, make chase, through Longsaddle; everything pointed towards here; I don't know really; it's super serious, it might hatch at any time and that could be *very* bad. I went to the warehouse because that's where I *know* it was taken a few days ago - I had them followed." Arturio asks who followed them. "A small friendly fairy that I met!"

Penny insight 12. Seems eccentric but not crazy! Gem dragon is not on our list, but we show it her. Makes no sense. "These are all mythical, possibly make-believe creatures... This and this are real..." (Mushroom Ring, Rainbow Serpent) "...but not the others."

The dig site is about 6 days ride away. The theft was about 7 days ago.

She'd sent a letter about the egg to a friend at the university, but otherwise, other people thought it was gem. "If my calculations are correct, that egg, once it becomes viable - once it's exposed to the natural magic of this land outside of its 'tomb' of the swamp - really has at most ten days before it hatches. So we are two or three days away! I need to get hold of it and suppress it before that happens."

Well then, some breaking & entering is in order. Cassee will stay at the Stone Hill Inn tonight; we tell her not to talk to anyone. But we are worried for her safety - the people at the warehouse are no good for all sorts of reasons - so decide to take her to our makeshift camp back at the caravan. We try to to use a quite route, hiding her as best we can, so that we're hopefully neither observed nor followed.

We feign heading off. But Arturo actually waits a few minutes, hiding, to see if Cassee actually leaves straight away. He watches her sit, think, stand, pace back and forth, sigh, pop her head around the tarp, think... **She stands up and walks into town** but leaves her horse tied up by Bruiser.

We follow her, thinking she's heading to the warehouse anyway. If she's at risk, we'll get the jump on anyone that attacks her; and if she's a trap for *us*, she might lead us somewhere interesting. She strides into town purposefully. Pulls out a journal from her pocket and goes into a shop that's just about to close, but still open for now. We hang back while Arturo gets close - but stealth is only 5 - Thorin tries to listen in, perception only 6, bumps into Arturo! - but Penny has hung around a corner and listens closely. Perception 18+2->20. She's asking the shopkeeper if he's seen anyone with a particular item; she can't see what it is, but it sounds like she's describing a large sapphire, so she seems to be describing the gem. Then she ask another shopper...

At this point Penny strides in, makes out that this is her eccentric mother, escorts her out!

As we're having a conversation outside about not being killed or scaring off bandits (!) a young man comes outside. He asks her if she was asking about a large egg-shaped sapphire. "You don't mean the Fabulous Egg that's the centrepiece of the opening of our museum?"

So yeah. Turns out that the town's money comes from the mines, undead cleared out from there a couple of years ago and business is booming ever since. He has no idea where the museum got the egg from, but there's a lot of money about.

In the end we (just about) agree that Cassee will do some divination back at our camp and as long as we're back before the first light hits the sky in the morning, she'll wait. Meanwhile, we'll start by scoping out the warehouse; there may be other clues there. The museum is likely to have more security and we don't even know if it's a fake, or just a literal crystal egg and not the thing Cassee is interested in anyway.

By the warehouse, Thorin casts Guidance to help Arturo do some scoping out. It's quite in this area now, warehouses all closed. Arturo takes the approach of striding up as if he's meant to be there. In addition to the main "barn doors", there is a locked side door and shutter windows that open from inside all shut and higher up the wall, about 10ft up.

Arturo has Misty Step but needs to see in a window for that to work. He stands on Penny's shoulders. Penny, athl 14; it works. Arturo finds he can easily open the window from underneath anyway so doesn't need a spell, and climbs inside. He wedges the window open, turns around and lowers himself down the inner wall; a 4ft drop after that. Penny makes herself scarce around the back of the warehouse.

Dim light inside, *just*, from the windows. Arturo has the Light cantrip and casts it on his component pouch, so the light is low and not visible from outside. The door to the office room inside is locked. Arturo tries "gently" smashing a window with his backpack - Penny cringes as the sound of breaking glass spills from outside. Unbeknownst to her, once inside Arturo uses Mend to build the window (DM fiat).

There are multiple ledgers. None are on the table. They have different colours; some have a blue stripe, some green. Picking one at random - blue stripe - Arturo looks at the latest entries. It's full to the last page. Names of people and money amounts next to them. Doesn't seem right. Tries a green one, from the right end of the row. The first three pages are filled, the rest empty. Items in this one - oar (and a blank space), roll of furs (and a money amount and a name - person who sold or bought it maybe?), then further down: **"Gem artefact?" (with question mark) - the figure next to it is 1000gp** and next to it is the name, "**Alda Arkin**".

Wondering if the strange list we have is in code, Arturo wonders if there are any smaller books that might code books or similar. Nothing stands out, so he flips through ledgers trying to investigate (12) quickly. He *just* catches something that might be relevant; "mushroom ring" is in one of the green ledger books. It doesn't have a price or a person name. Not sure if that's connected or just a common thing.

Arturo returns to the tarp area from before. The strange smell again. Not animal. Not mushrooms! 6 crates stacked 3x2, another next to the pile. Nature check 7, doesn't *seem* to be a natural smell; DM fiat, one other attempt permitted; 18 on arcana. Ah! There's a sense of something familiar here... Remembers it from years in the fey wild. It doesn't come from any particular *thing* - it's more an atmospheric smell *of* the fey wild. One crate in particular smells strongly. Arturo gets right under the tarp and lifts the lid - it's not nailed shut. A soft glow to it inside; a very large glass jar, sealed with a big flat cork, with a floating mote of soft, lilac/purple light inside. Arturo saw them floating around in the fey wild, which never bothered him; he'd heard stories that they were "forgotten dreams" or some such. The jar is too big to easily fit in a backpack.

Arturo digs out the vial that used to contain poison. He puts it in the place of the huge jar, uncorked, to feign the idea that the strange thing escaped and the jar shrunk! He then grabs this huge jar and then considers how he can escape. The window option is difficult without smashing the jar! Doors are all locked, windows are high.

Penny hears (passive perception 17) hears Arturo calling. He wants her to lift Thorin onto her shoulders so he can pass out the jar. He drags some crates over to create a way to get up to the window himself; but at that point, someone walking along the back of a neighbouring building sees the dwarf on the shoulders of a paladin in an elven cape, peeking into an open window of an otherwise-locked warehouse.

Penny says, "Dropped my keys again!" - deception 15. Thorin can tell from passive insight that the passer-by doesn't really buy the story, but also doesn't really want to get involved. She backs away. Penny loud-whispers up, "Thorin! We have to go now!" - at the moment that Arturo is handing this huge jar to Thorin. "What the fuck is this?" he asks, "We were looking for a gem!" and Penny calls up "No! We were looking for two kidnapped girls!"

Thorin now has to get down - he tries to jump down with the jar. Athl 17 - perfect landing. Penny sees it - "What the fuck is that?!". The light inside has floated to the side of the jar where Thorin's face is, kind of smushed up against it. Arcana 22 from Thorin. He's never seen this before but is pretty sure, from descriptions and behaviour, that this thing is aware of him. He says so. Penny says, "It's alive and captured by the bad guys. We should free it!"

Meanwhile, Arturo is putting the crates away back where they came from. He calls down "be ready to catch me!" and teleports up and out of the window. Thorin and Penny are focused on the jar; there's a loud thud behind us as Arturio hits the ground hard (1pt damage).

Nobody wants to let the thing out except Penny, so she carries it wrapped in a cloak and we take it back to our camp.

### 8:30pm

We get to Cassee to tell her what we found; seems the egg was sold, so the museum story seems legit - probably is the egg, not just a counterfeit or some actual random jewellery. When we get behind the tarp we find Cassee furiously drawing stuff on a piece of parchment, making quite a mess; bones, mashed up herbs; Penny recognises that she's doing her divination ritual.

Cassee sees us and asks what the jar is. We explain briefly about what we found at the warehouse. Happily, she'd done some scrying... And has a rough idea of the museum layout (PHOTO). It's a surprisingly detailed map. She things the egg is what is noted as "Murkmire Stone" on the second floor.

While we mull that over, in the quiet of our private corner of the camp, Cassee tries talking to the light in the jar in a few languages. She tries Sylvain, which Arturo recognises; then tries a particular Elvish/Sylvain dialect which Arturo recognises part of; so does Penny; it responds. It pulls back a little as if surprised, then forward again, then goes a deeper purple colour.

We decide to open the jar. Thorin steps back. First, Cassee tries talking to it, asking it to promise to not just fly away. It changes all sorts of colours. She asks again. It sinks to the bottom of the jar, first white, then red. If we didn't know better, we'd say it looked like it slumped in defeat.

We open the jar. The light squeezes out of the top of the jar - the jar itself is big and while its opening is large, it's still a much smaller diameter and is smaller than the light; then it puffs up. If a ball of light could be furry, this one would be. It turns a happy shade of yellow and makes twittering noises. We don't understand it.

Arturo tries to use Cassee to interpret for him. We want to stop the people that trapped it. We want to disrupt their operation. (It turns an excited red and bobs up and down). Can it show us a face of anyone involved?

It thinks a while, becomes a very small ball of light and moves *very* quickly - persistence of vision, like a child with a sparkler - it's the face of the warehouse manager.

Penny asks if it's seen anyone that seemed unwilling - like kidnapped people, kids maybe. When translated, it seems to think for a while and once again draws. This time, it's drawing stick figures. Stops, "looks" at Arturo, approaches, reaches out a small short fat 'arm' of light, puts its "hand" on his shoulder with one, touches his head with another, nods, waits. We don't quite understand, so Arturo instead finds a patch of sandy more bare ground and Cassee offers it a twig. It writes something. Cassee can read that; it's asking permission to enter Arturo's head. He agrees.

The ball of light seems to engulf his head completely!

Adv wisdom saving, Arturo, 8 - very confusing - lots of thoughts all at once. What he *does* get is that from where it was, it saw at various stops that there were teenagers brought there against their will. Some were brought to the warehouse we found at the dead of night but were taken away by the warehouse manager. Arturo tries to tell the ball of light, while it's still connected to his head, where he managed to break out of the Fey Wild - perhaps there's a more permeable barrier there, if it wants to get home. "Keep a low profile!" he conveys.

It leaves his head. Floats up. Points a hand into the direction of the woods; goes bright yellow while "looking" at us, then dark red, then back to happy yellow. It floats off.

Arturo relays the information it gave him.

"OK, I'm now fully on board with the 3am 'gentle questioning' idea for the warehouse manager" says Penny, though Thorin suggests that 16 Oak might be a thing. But the most time-sensitive thing seems to be this dragon egg; they know Cassee is looking for it, security could be increased any time; we only have 2 days.

Arturo asks Cassee to do scrying, to watch our backs and see if we're captured. It's really just a way to try and get her to stay here. But we figure we'll do a long rest now and go for the museum in the very early hours of the morning.

We rest up with Cassee.

### Day 4, 4:30am

When we wake up, Cassee is already awake. She is very nervous. She warns us to be very careful with the egg - it's alive, it's in the magic of this land... She hands us a bag. "Make sure you put it in this right away". Arturo puts it in his backpack. It's her **Bag of Holding**.

It's time for the heist!

(End of part 3)
