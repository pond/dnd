# RIPA: Part 42
## Session 42 (2024-06-18)
### Day 43, Web's Edge

We are inside the cavern complex of Web's Edge, fought a lot, liberated one prisoner (a cyclops called Gertrude) and found out that are even more things to fight still inside.

* An elf assassin is around
* There are two orc necromancers
* Two grimlocks (twisted underdark creatures of magic)
* An **erinyes** - a fallen angel - very dangerous! Appears to be in charge.
* At least one Greater Demon
* And, we think, maybe this Dragon Spider

A ritual is underway and almost complete; we want to try and interrupt it. We need to bear Northwards in the caverns to reach the summoning circle, where the ritual is taking place.

As we start to head out of the prison area, we look Eastwards down a long narrow part of the cavern, with only Francesc's darkvision letting her see, before the 'corridor' opens into some larger space, bits of rotting remains. Jellied limbs with bones sticking out, a pool of digestive juices and some slight reflection from Penny's sword, light glistening on some strands of cobwebs. We figure we'll risk leaving that and hope it doesn't chase up behind us; as we exit this area we close doors as we go through them.

At the centre door of the main North-South cavern more or less opposite the point where we entered, there is the Lightning Bolt door. We get ourselves in position and Arturo opens it. There are clicking noises as if gears are clicking and rotating. As before, one half of the door sinks in, unlocked but not open. It'll be quite a squeeze for Gertrude! Arturo asks if she could help push it open - both sides move, but are not yet fully open. Gertrude backs away a bit and Francesc squeezes in to see what's inside.

Francesc and Gertrude were trying to be stealthy, but not necessarily doing so well... Even so, all Francesc sees is a corridor with another pair of doors at the far end, plus a junction corridor on the left (Northwards); chanting noises are coming from there. She peeks around. Arcana 19; there's a small Deep Gnome standing in front of a summoning circle who has just *started* to utter the *last* sentence of a Summoning Spell. The ritual is cast; they've almost completed the spell. Interrupting the ritual _long enough_ ought to disrupt it...

(...There's some candlelight on the ground from that side passage, which although very dim, gives just enough silhouette for the rest of us to see something is amiss...)

...she shoots. **Crit!**; slugs, but not enough time to transfer Hunter's Mark, holding back on Favoured Foe; 25 damage...

(...We see the movement and know that a battle is starting...)

...it keeps its concentration. She tries again, with Sharpshooter this time; with penalty, 17 to hit; hits; 22 damage. It does less well holding concentration (nat 2) this time! The arrow grazes into the side of the gnome's face; it cries out **and loses concentration** - because he falls dead (just)!

Initiative:

* Arturo 18 (with +4)
* Thorin (as wind elemental) 17 (with +4 from Penny)
* Gertrude 12 (with +4)
* Penny 11
* Francesc 8
* Fire elemental 6

We're lucky; somehow, whoever else is in there doesn't seem to react and Arturo starts moving before they do. As he reaches the tunnel he sees that the Deep Gnome falling. He runs into the room with the summoning circle. Perception check - hearing - only 6. Wind howling. Otherwise, silence. He hides behind a table - ritual implements and a sacrificial knife; and from there, he sees on the ground, next to the Gnome, a dead cultist with throat slit, a big pool of blood around a ritual bowl that had then apparently been used to draw runes.

Suddenly Arturo and Francesc hear someone exclaim, "What was that sound?!" in a raspy, harsh voice. Then there's a yell. "What?! They killed him! Intruders! There's murder!"

Coming out of shadows, Francesc sees an orc covered in ritual bones, wearing a long, heavy, thick - almost luxurious! - robe; gems, jewellery... They hold a spiked staff. This must be one of the necromancers. It calls out again about intruders and interruption of the ritual - then traces a pattern of runes to cast something that looks like Mage Armour. It ducks back behind a corner!

(The rest of us still outside the main doors can't hear this)

Thorin-air flies in, not knowing what to find, across the summing circle and seeing the orc with the 60ft Darkvision. He *also* see sees a room down a corridor with a table, orc and drow! He moves over the Orc's space and slam attacks (Whirlwind does come back, but is likely to not move a stacked Orc!). First hits, very solid 20 damage; second is a *crit* for a huge 31 damage! It is thrown 10ft away and lands, dead in a heap on the ground, crumpled in a strange position, as if its neck might be broken. There's *just* enough head room to lift up off the ground, else Thorin would be fully blocking the passageway for view and *any* enemies on the other side would need to go through him first (and he wants to hold that Fire Elemental spell!)

Francesc sees the attack and the strange lift-up after, so knows *something* is up.

Gertrude looks down at the corridor and decides to not enter; she'd crush Francesc if she squeezed in there. Penny runs in; insight nat 20 (!) + 2 -> 22, she figures out what's what and continues running as far as she can, but as she ploughs straight through the summoning circle she's scuffing her feet to destroy lines and kick away some of the candles as best she can.

Francesc is in hot pursuit. She gets a clear line of sight to the distant Drow and orc at the table. She has time to move Hunter's Mark this time, to the orc wizard, then fires with Sharpshooter. 17 with penalty; hits (no Mage Armour on this one, for starters) - and does a solid 31 damage. The orc reels back in surprise and pain. A second arrow flies out; 17 again, which would hit - but the Mage is better prepared and throws up Shield. She calls out a warning back, so the rest of us might have *some* idea what's going on!

The orc wizard runs around the table and starts to cast something, changing and using some kind of sacrificial blade; the air around it starts to freeze and a vortex of ice and snow starts to jet forth. It's a 60ft cone catching everyone in the room - only Gertrude and the fire elemental are outside. CON saves.

* Penny 2+7->9, then 15 (with inspiration)
* Arturo 26
* Francesc 18
* Thorin-air 14+6

...which means, amazingly, we all save. Damage is therefore 42-21. Thorin-air would fail his CON save for holding the elemental but takes inspiration from the thought of newfound ally Gertrude being hurt, and ends up with 19+6 instead (25) and holds the spell.

We notice in surprise that the bodies of the dead sacrifice and the dead Gnome fully freeze.

The fire elemental full dashes in to follow Thorin, per instructions. As it goes past its significant radiant heat partially thaws the bodies and clears frost off the ground.

The distant Drow runs away, apparently; Thorin-air notices it reappear in the side passage where the Orc wizard had been hiding. It fires a crossbow at Thorin-air, misses wildly and sneaks back away out of sight! Thorin surmises that the Drow was trying to avoid the light from Penny's Sword.

Suddenly there's a loud scream of frustration. Things on the distant table are thrown backwards. The fallen angel appears. A flaming sword; tattered wings; strange battle banners trailing magically behind it; and it trails chains with hooks. It flies 60ft and attacks Thorin-Air with its flaming long-sword, wielded with both hands. The first attack, again luckily, *just* misses (14 vs 15). 19, hits. A third - 19 again, hits twice. 7 non-magical slashing -> 3 (resistant), 13 necrotic; 16 damage taken. CON save; Fire spell held. Next, 5->2 slashing and 8 necrotic -> 10 total. CON save - finally, disaster; nat 2.

The fire elemental is loose! Thorin tries to holler in Auran and flap around as a warning, but nobody else understands... Francesc insight 22 - ooooh shit. She shouts a warning!

Underneath the Erinyes is flying; two Grimlocks run in underneath. Both attack - to Thorin's surprise - the fire elemental, which is beside and partly under the air elemental. The Erinyes could only do it because they were flying. One hit deals only 4 damage, due in part to non-magical damage resistance.

Arturo tries something a bit different, casting Telekinesis. He figures he might be able to hold the Erinyes in place that way. It's a contest against spellcasting ability vs strength. 60ft range; he doesn't even need to move away from his table!

Arturo with a +5, rolls 20; the Erinyes with a +4, sadly, gets 23... He reacts, this being an ability check, with Bend Luck; gets a +2, not *quite* enough; one last thing to try - his Shard - to impose a disadvantage. And *that* does it! Nat 11+4->15 - the Erinyes put up a good fight but the Telekinesis grip takes its hold. And with that - he yanks the Erinyes into the space of the (enraged) Fire Elemental. The Erinyes takes no damage though - it's immune to fire! We see that clearly enough and that's very useful to know. Seeing this, he drags the Erinyes down to ground level.

(He also retreats a bit in case of further cones of cold, or spells of similar range).

Thorin pulls away and moves into the table room, tries to attack the second orc and misses twice! (Nat 3, nat 4). But he's literally on top of and surrounding the Orc.

(Francesc hears Gertrude calling in from outside; do we need help?! She calls back - yes please!)

Penny runs up and with ADV tries to attack the Erinyes. The first blow glances off the plate armour. The second meets its mark; this is a fiend, so with L2 smite it amounts to 5d8+5 -> 29 radiant damage. Looks like that did the trick! She shouts back, "Radiant works!"

Francesc again. Aims for the face! Hunters Mark is stuck on the other still-up orc necromancer, but she tries Sharpshooter for all attacks as (again due to telekinesis restraint) she has advantage. Dirty 20; just hits. 31 damage (all magical)! This makes it yell out in anger and frustration, smoke coming out of eyes and ears. And then - **another crit**. Only 21 damage tho (2d8 only 3,1), but with 9 more for slugs; 30 total. Still - 61 damage! The Erinyes actually is starting to look a bit beaten up. She moves to one side.

Thorin-Air is surprised - the Orc vanishes, but has to move *through* him. Disadv. opp attack; it just hits; 12 damage... And, to his even greater surprise, the Orc (CON failed for this one, too) becomes visible and collapses, dead.

(Francesc knows, since she "feels" Hunters Mark being released).

(Via DM d4 roll) the enraged fire elemental engulfs both Grimlocks, dealing 9 fire damage; it attacks both viciously; there's *nothing* left. Two piles of comedy smoking ash. That's good for us, but less so for Thorin - as it continues moving and gets right alongside Thorin-Air.

The drow emerges from around a corner and, in its opinion, (DM d4 roll) judges the fire elemental to be the greater threat. It attacks and *just* hits. The elemental is immune to poison though so none of the 25 poison damage, and only half piercing damage (just 3) but gets 16->8 on sneak attack. Only 11 total. At this, it runs away!

The Erinyes is restrained and won't get to retry until Arturo's turn, since that is when it last had an opportunity to escape. And this is remarkably debilitating for it - so it just curses in Infernal. Arturo speaks that! It's looking directly at him, cursing him, his mother, his grandmother, his children, and so-on and so-forth. Arturo learns some new swear words in Infernal.

Arturo in response moves out of the way of Gertrude having heard that she'll be coming in soon, then tries to re-apply his telekinetic grip. He rolls 21. The Erinyes has disadvantage given the existing restraint; only 16; it cannot escape. It digs deeper into its vocabulary, cursing Arturo's species, nation, this entire plane, the whole shebang.

Thorin-Air risks "running" from the fire elemental. Thorin-Air discovers that he has no resistance to fire damage and is hit as he goes; 10 more damage. Still up! He continues to the Drow. He's now air filled with smoke and sparks, sort of on fire. He'll be losing his air form soon so tries to make the most of it. Sadly only gets one hit, but it does 16 damage.

We hear Gertrude shouting, "Coming through!" - there's a thud sound as doors are slammed against walls; straining noises; we realise she's finding these narrow corridors very difficult! She just makes it into the room.

Penny keeps going. Advantage from telekinetic grip - Hit, L2 smite, 31 damage; 3 and 3 (+9) on the next hit -> miss. Rats!

Francesc's up. The usual, with Sharpshooter both times. Hunter's Mark is transferred this time; *easy* hit; a big 35 damage. The Erinyes is *very* badly injured now. Again, a solid second hit, once more thanks to advantage from the telekinetic grip; 21 more damage - and that's enough. With a horrified look, which changes then to fear, a rift opens and she is sucked back screaming to her plane. A few things fall away as she does - we surmise they must be things acquired and worn from *our* plane.

The fire elemental (d4 roll) goes a long way around to attack Thorin without going through the drow assassin, hitting twice. 12 and 10 fire damage. The air elemental form drops and 7 more damage carry over... **And he's on fire!** He shouts, "Umm, help?!"

But now the Drow has its turn - with advantage for a flanked Thorin. 22 piercing via sneak, with 25 poison -> 12. He's down to 57. The second hits too; no sneak but still 8 piercing, and 24->12 more poison damage. He's down to 37.

Arturo can't see that. He heard Thorin's cries though! He has Telekinsis up, but the furthest he can go without a dash doesn't let him see around the corner. He can Misty Step, though, and gets a line of sight to the Drow assassin on Thorin; he tries to get his telekinetic grip to restrain the assassin - and he beats the contested roll again. He holds it!

Thorin takes 10 more fire damage at the start of his turn. He's desperate. He can't run past the fire elemental, he'd have to go the long way around and be even further from his friends and possibly saving.  He tries Polymorph - it works! The elemental turns into deer (4hp) and runs for it. The deer of course bits him and **of course** gets a crit, doing 2d4 -> 6 (!!) damage. FML. Thank goodness though, he holds his spell! He's on fire, he's almost down anyway, he's getting as close as he can to help but figures he has only seconds left of consciousness.

Then - to his amazement - Gertrude squeezes into the gap just in front of him; and at his request, she's able to put out the fire. Well that's *something*, but now she's completely blocking the entrance. Then Penny squeezes past and dashes along the corridor, but Thorin calls out as he sees her running past - "Don't hit the deer!". She takes a second to use Channel Divinity to regain an L2 slot.

Francesc runs up to look down the corridor (but it's blocked by Gertrude) and decides to prepare an action that she'll fire if she see the Drow or fire elemental (she doesn't know it's polymorphed into a deer right now).

Of course, the deer now runs up and attacks the deer. Penny looks on bewildered, not knowing why there's a deer, having been told not to hit it and wondering why it's attacking Thorin! Fortunately, dodges. "What the *fuck* is going on?!" asks Penny.

The Drow is restrained, but suddenly says a few words and is suddenly engulfed in darkness.

Arturo, in his wisdom, is not able to see the Drow anymore and cannot redo his telekinesis this time, so of course elects to use a fireball. He at least aims it at a back wall, so Penny is *just* out of the range. 22 damage. It fails its save so takes half damage rather than (via Evasion) none. He hides behind a table and tells Gertrude to go get the Drow in the darkness!

Thorin runs for it. He squeezes past Gertrude and emerges near a surprised Francesc, on a full dash. The deer misses on an opportunity attack. He's out in the larger cavern now, with the summoning circle.

Now Gertrude, at Arturo's behest, moves *up* and into the table room. Unfortunately this promptly exposes an escape route for the deer / fire elemental into the chamber where Thorin just escaped! But Gertrude has a plan - she *throws the huge table* at the Drow assassin, no saves possible, 37 damage.

Penny steps forward towards the sound; Blindsight lets her see the Drow. She attacks, but no advantage this time. She attacks and hits with L2 smite; amazing damage roll - 4d8 + 5 -> a huge 7,7,7,6 -> 32 damage. The darkness falls, as does the Drow.

Thorin is able to shout warnings about the deer - polymorphed, don't hurt it! Francesc reasons that we should try to grapple it and tie it up, so that it can just stay in that form until its hour is up. If Thorin has to change his spell concentration, then so be it; but hopefully we'll be long gone from this chamber and it can't touch us.

Francesc manages to grapple and overcome the deer; that's it! We tie it up.

Done. Thorin can't cast Healing Spirit - concentration, he's holding Polymorph! He gets 26. Still pretty terrible - only 44 hp of 98! - but all we can do right now. Penny self-heals via Cure Wounds for 13, swapping Channel Divinity to get that spell slot. She's only got 3 spells left, in total, with no hands-on pool and no other Channel Divinity uses, and no healing potions.

Gertrude guards the entrance to the summoning chamber. Arturo checks for hidden doors with Francesc's help, then moves on to start looting! They find no door or similar on the wall. But they still have a suspicion. They figure - spend more time and do it again; another minute goes by. This time Francesc's investigation - albeit with a luck point! - is 25.

Arturo was right!

**Hiding, behind an illusion, is a secret door.** And what's more, she finds a block of stone to push - it opens.

*This, it transpires, was not a great idea.*

Francesc's heart drops. With our resources heavily drained, hit points low and no Short Rest, there it is - the vast chamber of the Spider Dragon and the Priestess of Loth.

This thing is awful. A black dragon, she thinks; the limbs of a spider; a sting on the tail; 8 eyes; strange pincers in its mouth; a bloated midsection and, in the huge cavern, numerous glistening cobwebs, thick, all over - above, on the ground and more. There are strange pools of what seem to be digestive liquid all over, with bones or other remains here and there. It makes sense; the dragon's horn shape and recognisable features remind her of the black dragon we tackled before and that's in line with the "digestive" acidic pools we've seen. Francesc has a flash of initiative and recognises those webs as the same as the ones we saw earlier, at the end of the Southerly passageway.

Up high, there's almost a strange walkway of webs and, in the middle of it all, is suspended a **giant, green object that looks very like drawings we've seen of a rod.**

Wearily, initiative!

* Francesc 20
* Arturo 18
* Penny 18
* Thorin 13
* Gertrude 8

The door is too small for Gertrude. She'll have to stay on guard, to at least stop anything *else* from coming through!

The Dragon Spider looks at Francesc. The Priestess' attitude almost makes it look as if this monstrosity
is her pet! And without any pause, the Dragon Spider spits out a spray of venomous spiderlings, a 30ft cone, all over Francesc, the door and the wall. DEX save 25. **65 -> 32 poison damage!** Then it climbs up to the ceiling!

(End of part 42)
