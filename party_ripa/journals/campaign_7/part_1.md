# RIPA: Part 1
## Sessions Zero and 1 (2023-04-04)

* Arturo Rey (young, 20), variant human Fey-touched wild magic sorcerer
* Thorin Beastcaller (very young, 50), dwarven druid, focuses on shape-shifting, stonemason
* Francesc Icefrond (young, 140), elven ranger
* Penny Jones (34), variant human paladin, very in touch with the wilderness

A road, near Neverwinter Wood. It is just past sundown on an early spring evening. The trees are just starting to awaken from their winter slumber. 60-70 miles distant to the north loom great mountains.

Headed towards the coast - at least a week away - is Thorin, off the road in the scrub, travelling in animal form of a small bear (DM fiat; L1 technically can't wildshape). He is headed towards Neverwinter. To his left is the volcano that famously erupted and, from the lava flow, split that city in two. Perception 20. A twig snaps behind. He drops down, quickly; humans! Ill intent. An arrow whistles past his ear. They're hunting bear cubs?!

Quick as a flash, he shifts back into his true form of a male dwarf. One of the hunters shouts, "Oh! It's not a bear... He's gonna tell on us. Get him!" - combat seems inevitable. The dwarf is a druid, carrying a staff of ironwood. It turns into a hardened stone - the staff is magically activated. They are a distance away, but have arrows and the dwarf's speed is slow. He casts Entanglement! Both hunters are entangled. The druid siezes the opportunity - he changes into a deer and flees.

Annoyingly, the hunters give chase - the deer's keen hearing picks up their pursuit, but the deer has already got a very good lead. The druid/deer dashes into the forest. Perception 12. Doesn't quite notice, in the heat of pursuit, a tree right in the path - crashes headlong into it. The druid/deer looks up. Huh?! A 6ft, 150lb human. Looks young, tanned and very unkempt - stepping out of a purple (!) tree with a pink outline that surely wasn't there a moment ago.

It is Arturo who appeared out of the tree - wisdom saving 3! Very disorientated. Holding a knife. Checks the deer's vital signs - maybe it's delicious! Medicine check: 6. The dear is clearly dead...

...worried that he's being captured, the druid has no choice but to transform back to a dwarf.

Arturo now suddenly sees a 4ft tanned dwarf; very dark eyes; dark grey hair, adventurer's clothes, no armour; holds a wooden shield. Unkempt too! "Oh! Sorry! I didn't realise you were a person!" - stows the dagger. "Are you OK?" "There are two guys chasing me!" - both of them can hear the hunters crashing through the woods now.

Arturo darts behind a tree. "Hide!" he shouts - but in their haste, the stealth is, uuuh, not good. Then the hunters arrive. "...There it is!" the shout, pointing and circle around - but they circle around Arturo!

"I just saw this really freaked-out deer going that way" tries Arturo. Deception 26! They fall for it hook line and sinker, diving even deeper into the forest.

Arturo and Thorin wait until they can't hear them anymore.

Arturo asks why Thorin was being chased and he explains. Thorin asks about the tree! Arturo kind of hedges it - "I went on a trip, you know..." "A trip in a tree?!" "Yeah!"

Perception disadv., 5 and 6 from each. They don't notice until the last minute that, drawn by all the commotion, a strange pair of people approach. They hear the clanking of armour first. Chainmail, rattling... Paladin Penny knows that her friend - of sorts! - elven ranger Francesc is up in the tree. Penny's longsword is drawn. She doesn't like poachers.

She'd seen a cub be engaged by hunters; then a dwarf; then a deer. The dwarf is here, but the other character looks sketchy to her. "Stand down or face the consequences!" "Are you cannibal too?!" "What? No!"

Penny insight 5! The unkempt kid is definitely sketchy. The dwarf seems less so. "Druid, huh? And - *what* exactly are you?" - she asks of Arturo, sword still drawn. "I'm here just making sure this guy doesn't get eaten!"

"Oi! Captain Clank! Put the weapon away" - a shout from above. Penny sighs and stows the sword - Francesc must believe there is no danger. "Penny Jones", she announces abruptly. Charisma is her highest stat. Arturo answers; "No, I'm not. But you can be...?!" Penny notices a strange sparkle fading from around Arturo, tries arcana check; 2-2 => 0! He might be a god.

(Penny doesn't know that Arturo has been in the Fey and is worried about name stealing).

Penny shouts, "You may as well come down!" - and Francesc does a double back-flip down from the tree. Tidy hair and clothes, like Penny; 5.5ft, short blonde hair. Slender but strong looking. The dwarven Thorin sees an elf drop down to the forest floor, but there's no prejudice for this druid. Hasn't seen (m)any elves before.

Penny and Francesc have been in the forest for a while. They met some time ago at the village where Penny "studied" but only started travelling together comparatively recently. They were following the hunters; they were killing more than they should, apparently for sport. And a baby animal? That's too much.

Penny says to Francesc that the hunters have crossed a line - hunting a baby. Thorin points out that thay hunted him even when he was a dwarf. Thorin's got a personal stake - agrees with Penny that it's about justice. But Francesc and Arturo are more "murder hobo"; they've crossed a line and need to pay. Kill or be killed.

We agree, at least, to pursue.

We have trouble tracking. Arturo survival 13, Penny only 3+4! But Francesc comes through, 15. It's enough. Leads us, tracking reliably. She gets to within 100ft of them and alerts us. Penny takes the signal and moves in. Astonishingly, stealth 16-1 => 15, they haven't noticed! Thorin is sticking close to Penny; Arturo is tracking somewhat independently, not really trusting us.

We all have ideas to act, so initiative:

* Penny 13
* Thorin 10
* Francesc 8
* Arturo 7

Penny charges in, longsword drawn. 60ft, dash. 55ft away from the hunters. A hunter sees us, draws a bow and fires twice. Miss, hit; low damage fortunately; 4 damage, 7 left. Thorin runs up a distance then, at edge of range, tries Engtangle again. This time, one hunter manages to dodge it but the other is caught again, as he was busy firing at Penny. Thorin activates his staff once more.

Francesc fires at an arrow at the unentangled hunter; hits definitively; 11 damage, with favoured foe 1d4 => 1. 12 damage; the hunter appears almost indignant (as well as in pain). "It's an **ELF!**" he shouts - in apparent disdain.

Arturo gets closer, stands behind a tree for cover and casts Sleep. 5d8 => 25hp equivalent. The one who was injured immediately falls asleep (with exactly 25hp). "That guy's asleep! Take out the other one!"

Penny runs 30ft in to 25ft range. She throws her longsword tip-down into the ground, then throws a javelin; hits (thanks to entanglement advantage) for 5pts. The entangled bowman fires twice at Penny again. One *just* misses, the other wildly so.

Thorin is 65ft behind Penny and just keeps running in, until 15ft away. Francesc shoots an arrow at the entangled guy, hits for 12 damage. Arturo throws a firebolt at range and hits for 18 damage. The very injured huntsman now calls out "**STOP! Stop!** Let's all be reasonable about this...!" - and carefully puts down his bow.

Penny picks up the longsword and says, "Choose. Justice, or death." "What is justice?" "Taken to the lawmakers at the nearest town for hunting babies and dwarves!" "We don't have a choice! We have to find a way to live in these woods!"

"You start a fight, you finsih it" says Francesc - and fires again. Hits. Damage is 9. The hunter is clinging onto life. "Francesc! Stop" shouts Penny... But it worked. The hunter starts talking very quickly. "We'll tell you! We'll tell you who blackmailed us! They have our daughters!" - Francesc, insight dirty 20; Thorin, 23. Desperation and fear. Thorin shouts "He's telling the truth!"

"Speak fast" says Penny.

"Vallin. Vallin's the guy. He runs the smuggling ring. The papers are in his pocket, his, there. Get the parchment." (Points to the sleeping hunter). Between Francesc and Penny, we find the folded-up parchment in the his pocket. Arturo ties them both while we search; the Sleep spell will fade soon.

* "V G" signed
* A ledger of hunting quotas against a debt
* They're a third of the way through
* Looks like they have a week to deliver or they'll never find their daughters

Penny lays on hands for 3hp for the guy that's in really bad shape. The other wakes up, freaked out. Arturo taps the knife on his throat - "You're cooperating now" - intimidation adv. 22. He is indeed cooperating! "Look. I don't need to be tied up. You can take my weapons. What's going on..." (at his friend).

Penny sighs. "What town?"; Francesc adds, "Where do we find this - Vallin?"

They leave things in a small warehouse outside a place called Ondin. In sacks, with specific rune markings that they show us on parchment. Penny and Francesc recognise the town's name; it is a small town back up the road - quite a long way, actually. Many hours of walking. A conversation ensues about whether or not they'll get to Ondin before us if we free them, and give the game away; do we need captives; etc.; we decide they're too injured to beat us there, unless we need to stop and rest ourselves.
