# RIPA: Act 2 Part 7
## Session 53 (2024-12-03)
### Wreckage of the Lambent Zenith, midsection, Sigil day 6

We have rested in the midsection of the ruined Lambent Zenith, having defeated a nest of Grell that were causing trouble here. Blink dog Icasa is on watch. Icasa showed us a lockbox in which we found a journal from Inda, which contained within the pass phrase to dispel the ward in this section that helps guard the safe in the bow ("**The moon sings a song for the lost**"). We haven't used this yet, both because we didn't want to potentially alarm Inda *before* our rest - who judging by the journal, was already on quite high alert due to what she considered increasingly erratic and unusual behaviour by the crew even before the crash - and we don't want to leave the safe without magical defence for a long period of time. For all we know, competitors of ours might still be hanging around!

D20 requested by DM. Lawful alignment is disadv.:

* Arturo 17
* Penny 15, 11 -> 11
* Francesc 17, 10 -> 10
* Thorin 10

Thorin and Francesc, as they rest, feel uneasy. They wake up feeling less calm as normal; the long rest has worked as normal, but they both awake with a D6 of psychic damage (Thorin: 5 but has resistance -> 2 taken, Francesc: 3). Arturo, thanks to his high roll, gets inspiration. No spells are changed.

We plan to travel to the bow, so first, we must dispel the ward using the passphrase we found in the journal. The rune fades; nothing much else happens. Arturo and Thorin's high arcana mean they notice a strange glimmer of a kind of silver thread, heading outwards towards the bow section.

Next we figure we'll head that way. We go onto the top deck. Icasa is following us around ("Can we keep him?!" asks Penny) - but Icasa checks with Redbud, asking what he should do. Redbud *can* move between sections, but is very slow and ponderous - not that bright! - and is slow especially in the strangeness of the Astral Sea. He could disentangle from the wreck and grab onto another vessel if he needed to.

We'll cross that bridge when we get to it - for now, mission first.

We head away, leaving Icasa behind to look after Redbud and have them keep each other company. Thorin leads the way. INT navigation roll; 14+2. We go in more or less the right direction. From this vantage point we can see a colossal mass that seems to be the kind of ribcage, arcing over this whole area. Those with high passive perception look ahead and see that the whole prow of the bow section has smashed into a huge, fleshy mass in the middle of this rib cage, with bits of petrified sinew and strips of flesh.

What's more... There seems to be movement. It beats, very slowly, as if with a heartbeat. Francesc points it out to everyone.

Arturo wonders that if we kill it, perhaps navigation and teleport work again. Penny struggles with all of it - is this a god? It's flesh and blood! Kind of... And *kill* a god? Her dilemma resolves; this looks in every way like a *creature*. An undead one, perhaps. An aberration. Not a god! So as for the idea of killing an undead thing, or putting something out of its misery? Yes!

But - the prow is in the way and we don't know what'll happen if we do attack this thing. Mission first, again. We keep in a group, moving at the same speed, and continue on. We're under the massive "arches" of ribs. It is, frankly, pretty gross; putrid tendons and flesh hanging on. Arturo tries to see if there looks like anything more... Living? But really, it's putrid and calcified. Penny wonders if it is an infestation, in fact, that makes part of it move; she asks Thorin; Thorin arcana 24, watches the timing of it all. It takes some 30 seconds to complete one 'beat'. On each completion, he senses (as does Penny once it's pointed out, with Arcana 19) a wave of "raw" magic - no identifiable school - emanating out. You need to be close to feel it. Penny recognises it, though, now it's pointed out, on that Arcana 19; it's almost the opposite of her ordered magic. It's chaos. Well, the "god" is called Havoc.

The bow section is a *mess*, albeit not split fully in two like the midsection. The mast has fallen, the prow is completely ruined. But of that ruin, there's a clear landing point we can aim for. We head down, but (by DM roll) **Thorin suddenly is targeted by two beams of radiant light, bursting forth from the lower level of the bow** - but hit his armour and glance off. He and Penny both recognise it for radiant damage; then we hear, "Raiders! Thieves!" and someone who must surely be Inda leaps up - looking like she's in great pain - holding a mace in one hand, trailing a strange smoke and apparently phasing in reality. She has wings; one beautiful and white, one broken and mechanical. The mace is in her left hand, but her right arm is messed up and looks partly mechanical too. She has bright silver eyes, platinum bob-cut hear and wears a very finely-made silver/mithril chain shirt.

Penny shouts and tries to convince her we're here to help; Figaro is involved, other crew are alive; persuasion is only 22. Arturo tries too, more unconventional but persuasion 25.

Penny mentions the rod - we know it's here, we know what it is... And that causes Inda to say, "Ha! I knew it!" - she lands on the deck with three of our party lined up and throws a spell out. DEX saves for Penny, Thorin and Arturo; CON saves (+4 for aura proximity):

* Arturo 21
* Thorin 24
* Penny 20

Lucky rolls. We're actually mostly fine (not blinded) _but_ take half damage. It's a radiant burst, so Penny takes even less - 27->13, or >6 for Penny.

Penny pushes forward between Fran and Thorin. Arturo is holding Thorin back who is angered. She implores Inda to stand down. We are not drawing weapons. ADV persuasion total 20. It's not great but enough for her to say, "I won't give it you - but I will parlay".

Arturo explains about us having a rescue ship, but Havoc's magic interferes. "The ship is a wreck" says Inda. "Even if I could get into the navigation room, but I can't - the mask is blocking the way! - there's also... _Something_ that lives in the "heart" that has been attacking the ship. It hasn't bothered to come to me, yet." We also learn that Inda can't access the safe either.

Penny, medicine dirty 20. Her issues are mechanical not medical... Penny can't help. Arturo decides to try Mending, then! And - it helps a bit. Snapped pieces of metal form back together. In the end, two key pieces are repaired and then Inda can do the rest.

Conversation continues and time passes. Event dice is rolled - D20 -> 15 (15 or higher, nothing happens). Inda seems quite intent on the navigation room being accessed, and besides, getting there helps us get to the safe in her quarters. We head down with her. She's fixed up and has sorted out her dress; her hair changes colour to auburn, her eyes become grey rather than silver; she's no longer glowing! There seems to be more calm here. Arturo arcana 23 - Aasimar? No, a parent of that, celestial; a deva. Penny has only got 2+8->10 religion, but Arturo gossips and she learns the truth pretty quickly!

At the mast, Francesc ATHL 16 helps using a lever - Penny tries brute force, but ATHL only 9! - "work smarter, not harder!" quips Francesc.

So, now we see what's beyond the mast... And it's not really that great. We can *feel* the strange pulsing as we seem to be inside the "heart", but we see no sign yet of whatever has attacked other sections according to Inda. At least we're now in the navigation room. It means little to us... Except we see a dead body of a gnome. Someone was crushed. Inda heads over and says a short prayer. Arturo takes a bed sheet from the adjacent bedroom to respectfully cover the gnome but then tries to pick its pocket! SOH 11! "Some respect for the dead?!" says Inda. Penny says, "I can only apologise for the... Misplaced enthusiasm of our crew!"

Inda gets to work on figuring out what dragged the ship here and causes ongoing problems with navigation. She checks logs first. She sits in the strange navigator's chair and seems to be casting something. Thorin and Penny can't recognise it but Arturo (ARC 19) does - Legend Lore. A strange way to use the spell and worth remembering. Arturo suggests that finding out *how* this happened should be done after finding a way out, but Inda insists that the circumstances which pulled them here are understood.

We learn something vital. **It's a teleportation trap**.

Event dice: 6. Oh.

Suddenly we hear a nasty, squelching and scraping noise - happens with the heart 'beating' - along with a shudder from the boat. A bigger burst of energy hits us - CON saves all round:

* Inda is hit hard, reeling backwards and then doubling over and coughing, spitting out blood.
* Thorin 33 (!) - no damage
* Arturo 13 - is hit, 8 force damage
* Francesc 6 - 8 but is resistant to force damage
* Penny 15 - just enough to take half

Penny immediately steps up heals Inda back for the 8 as Arturo, attuned to such things, recognises a magical wave that *is* related to all the strange events here. The regular beats wouldn't have trapped the ship but the big shockwaves would!

There's a bizarre roaring and gurgling, bestial, echoing; a roar happens simultaneously. It's also coming from the direction of the heart. Arturo casts Clairvoyance, trying to cast it *into* the heart somewhere. And he sees it...

...a very strange sight. It *is* like a heart, but obviously it's truly gigantic. The walls are _almost_ flesh but infused with energy. Some of it is very injured, with congealed trails of what would be blood but are a brown-golden colour. There are no flat surfaces here. A huge creature takes a big bite out of the walls as he watches! It looks slick, with what look like wet scales. Huge flippers. At the end of each are large claws. The entire head, body and long tail - plesiosaurus style - is covered entirely in spines. Arturo speaks as he watches so we all hear the description. Inda has never heard of it. "It's *eating* the heart, you say?!" asks Inda.

Arturo also sees that part of the ship punctured into the wall of the heart. There's also a huge - 10ft diameter hole, roughly circular - that's been eaten out of the front side of the ship, too. Arturo is considering fireballs, Penny is worried that the creature has eaten the rod!

We decide to investigate. Rather than looking more into navigation logs, we descend through a trap door into the captain's quarters. And yes. Where the safe should be, is in fact just a missing chunk of ship. Inda gasps in dismay. Penny just sighs. "Don't worry. This sort of thing happens to us _uncannily_ often."

The creature isn't visible from where we are, which is probably lucky else we'd already be under attack. Penny suggests that Francesc try to get Hunter's Mark on it to see if it has weaknesses. Francesc is keen to move in by stealth; Arturo meanwhile sees that the creature has moved out of the visible area of his clairvoyance spell. Francesc sneaks in deeper, to try and look into an adjacent chamber. Stealth 31.  She sees a chamber with *lots* of holes and bite marks. There is strange calcified rubble has collapsed near her, but she can't see the creature.

We all start to advance towards Francesc's position. Perception:

* Arturo 13
* Francesc 27, she can hear the strange sounds from her right
* Penny below 27
* Thorin below 27

Francesc moves into the chamber opening but can't see much so advances very cautiously forward (on the same stealth roll). Darkvision comes in handy. Once she reaches a view through a hole in one side wall, *now* she see the creature. He gets Hunter's Mark on it straight away... And it notices!

(It's immune to various non-magical damage attack types, and immune to poison).

Initiative! All with +5 bonus from Penny except Francesc.

* Inda 26
* Thorin 26
* Francesc 23
* Arturo 18
* Penny 18

Inda leaps into action, taking flight, flying over all of us and ends up at another chamber wall hole next to Thorin and shouts out what sounds like some kind of command or challenge, in Celestial - which none of us speak. Two now-familiar bolts of radiant light shoot forward. One hits, dealing 1 (!) damage but she's also now got her mace out, active. With the mace active, there's a sense that she has an aura a bit like Penny.

Thorin sees a very spiky creature, with very sharp teeth, that's immune to poison so he figures it's probably poisonous. He decides to cast Investiture of Stone to clad himself in the calcified stone from around and advances forward.

Francesc just fires! 27 to hit, hits. 17 damage. The next arrow - 17 hits; 12 more damage. It's slowed somewhat by her action (50(!)ft -> 40ft). She withdraws further into the main chamber, with sight through a third hole, after Inda, of the creature.

Speak of which... The creature (a hertilod) moves. It climbs up a wall, then jumps down on top of Thorin! He takes 6 bludgeoning damage (after resistances). CON save, holds the spell easily.

Arturo summons a green spirit dragon inside the same side chamber as the monster. It moves in to attack, with Arturo moves position to keep sight of it. The green dragon *would* be flanking with Thorin, but Thorin isn't in a flanking position, he's *under* the creature right now! Its attacks both land, for 13->6 damage combined. The breath weapon can't do anything as the enemy is immune to poison, but attention is drawn and it provides a flanking opportunity.

Penny runs in close to (squashed!) Thorin. She activates the sun sword and attacks twice, doing 13 and 12 damage; no divine smites, since activating the sword took up the time she might've used for that.

The hertilod now swipes at Penny, hits, does 9 slashing damage. A second claw is aimed downwards at Thorin (23, hits) dealing 10->5 damage for him (non-magical). He holds the spell (can't fail CON save given a +12). Then it turns around and tries to bite the spectral dragon and succeeds; 22 piercing damage, plus 20->10 (due to resistance) poison damage - **and the spectral dragon is swallowed!**

Inda flies in, Mace swinging for two attacks and getting two hits. 9 bludgeoning plus 16 radiant -> 25 for the first, 10 plus 12 -> 22.

Thorin wriggles his way *under* the creature and ends up in a flanking position opposite Penny, similar to the spectral dragon before it. Now he tries to start an earthquake! It's quite a small radius so Penny is *just* clear; the hertilod's save is 30 on a DC 17 so it doesn't get affected. No damage! Rats. He changes form into a giant frog.

Francesc fires; hits; a solid 25 damage. Fires again; just hits; 16 more. She retreats back a bit and the hertilod starts to *feed* on the dragon, which takes 11 necrotic damage (which heals the hertilod!)

Arturo tries Psychic Land (cast with subtle spell) INT DC19 save (would-be disadv negated by its damage resistance); 2; but it *chooses* to succeed... Arturo sees that magical familiar resistances kicking in. It still takes (after halving) 10 psychic damage. At least it's looking a *little* bit more messed up now.

The hertilod tries to move away. Penny hits with an opportunity attack for 19 damage; Inda also hits, 7 more (no radiant extra on this one); Thorin misses.

The spectral dragon was instantiated with instructions to distract, which it figures it cannot do from inside this strange enemy. It tries to escape through the mouth - ATHL check - nat 20. It finds the throat and tries to wriggle and force its way out! This of course causes some damage and the spectral dragon isn't able to fully push out since it's restrained by the closed mouth and teeth, but it's clawing at the insides (counts as a couple of rend attacks). Damage total is 17->8.

Penny runs forward to reach the creature and hits, with a blinding smite added in (22 damage). It fails its CON 18 save but *chooses* to save. It's *really* annoyed at her again. She gets another hit for 15 more damage, but is clearly in danger now.

The dragon takes 4->2 damage at the start of the hertilod's turn. It tries to swallow Penny! First it attacks; nat 1, misses! It's even more annoyed now and starts swiping with claws. Hit, miss (another nat 1...); 12 more damage. It tries to withdraw; Penny gets an opportunity hit for 11 more damage, but it's still up and starts climbing walls. It ends up hanging from the ceiling, looking like it wants to escape. "Don't let it get away!" yells Penny.

Inda flies up to it. Her first attack misses (nat 1) but the second hits, doing 18 damage. **It's enough!** The hertilod falls off the ceiling with a wet splat.

Inda starts cursing it and hacking at it and crying, yelling a litany of names. Penny walks up, sunsword unlit, and says, "feels good to get revenge sometimes, doesn't it."

"It's justice! It's justice for all the death that it's caused!"

The head of the hertilog is pulping at this point. "Maybe that's enough justice for one day" says Penny, quietly, persuasion 29. Inda slows down, then drops her mace, turns around, and starts to sob, finally processing what's gone wrong. Penny lets her do that for a while then says, "More of your crew are still alive. Let's rejoin them. But first..."

...we need to dig out the rod from the stomach! But Arturo and Francesc are well ahead. Francesc medicine 19. She has a good educated guess of where the stomach must be, cutting with the short sword. DEX check, 23. She realises she's hit something bad just in time and jumps back as a huge spurt of poison sprays out! The valiant spectral dragon has long since expired, but we are at least able to check inside this monster. Penny ATHL 15 holds the opening up and Thorin wriggles in as a frog! He has resistance to the poison in there and it's good to be a creature that can cope with wet, slippy environments. Perception 28! It takes only a few moments (and 17->8 poison damage, he's still a frog!) to find a piece of rod within a fold of the gullet. It has become lodged.

Thorin-frog *swallows* the rod. But this means he's very much in contact with a rod segment, unshielded. WIS save... **nat 1**!

Thorin-frog feels as if he is being pulled into multiple dimensions simultaneously. A sort of 'fast forward' view of all the places the rod has been. Outside, we start to worry as he's not emerged; Penny moves in close to see if he's OK; he's essentially incapacitated in there and now takes 16->8 more damage. WIS save again, now in aura range; dirty 20. Thorin-frog leaps out. It had been a good 30-odd seconds of quiet and no movement after Thorin-frog had called back that he'd "found it".

Thorin-frog emerges and regurgitates a (very wet and poisonous) rod. He's covered in poison too! Penny casts Create Water and a great gush of water pours down onto the (still stone-covered) frog, washing the poison away.

Inda comes over. "Now we have a conundrum. I am honour-bound to deliver that somewhere safe. There was a very specific location which I was tasked with delivering it to! And yet, it has to be said that I would never have completed my mission had you not arrived. So what *feels* right is not in fact what *is* right."

A debate ensues. Do *we* trust the organisation where Inda was to deliver this rod and ask them for help? Or do we continue to trust nobody?

(Inda learns from our conversation that Venca is rising and the Lady Of Pain has closed Sigil).

Inda spots a way out of her dilemma - she would need to be able to cast a spell that she can't task; she must commune with her creator. At this, the group considers letting Inda see that we have the first segment, *and* to use it. It's unanimous (Penny WIS save 27 self-rolled, she is *sure* Inda is trustworthy). Inda is, it seems, truly impressed by our trust at this moment.

It takes a while to take off the armour and get at the first segment!

Inda takes the rod. She floats up and emanates a dim light that fills the whole space. Perception low all-round except for Francesc, 19. She suddenly notices - as an aside - that the weird rumbling of the "pulsing heart" before has stopped. The chamber we're in is petrifying quite quickly. Arturo had mentioned wanting (for some reason!) wanting some of the *not* rotting flesh and Francesc remembers, so she tells Arturo who quickly - survival nat 20! - quickly finds a *not* rotting area and cuts off a small amount. One to eat(!) and one to sell. It amounts to an attack roll of dirty 20 and he gets a 300g piece. He has no idea how to preserve it, but tries putting it into the bag of holding that Francesc has. Fortunately, Penny does *not* notice!

About a minute passes. It's getting a bit awkward but suddenly, the light fades and Inda drifts back down to the ground. She gives Penny a slight smile, but not of happiness, it's of understanding. Without a word, she hands Penny *both* parts of the rod. (Of course Penny doesn't touch them with her bare hands).

"The path that you are on is important. It is righteous. It is true. My patron does not know where it will lead, but we have to believe that you will succeed. I have been instructed to whatever I can to help you achieve what you need. That means giving you the rod with which I had been entrusted. As far as I was concerned I had already lost it, so I had failed in my task; but this here gives me a chance to redeem myself."

With that, we elect to withdraw but first, Thorin tests teleportation with a spell he has. It's only a 30ft movement, Moonlight Step - and it works perfectly! Arturo is then keen to use the rod, but Penny suggests he doesn't - and instead Thorin steps in and grabs it. He's done so before, after all. WIS save; 26 total with aura bonus. Thorin this second time is more prepared.

* He realises he can think about two locations. One within 10ft or one with 500ft. A portal will open between those two points. He recognises it as similar to a spell known as Dimension Door, except the portal stays open for ten minutes as long as he concentrates.

* It can only be used once a day.

He realises that we can use that to travel between ship sections, but the treant can't fit through the portal so we'll need another solution there. We can then help him get to the stern though.

Our plan is enacted. We fast-travel to the midsection, then help the blink dog and treant make it to the stern. It takes about half an hour. There, we can teleport people to the Scarlet Arrow. We run the calculations... We figure we can move about 8 creatures each time. Francesc must of course come back for the second batch. And it *just* works! We can do it in 3 hops, with the three charges.

At the first hop, we warn the Arrow that there's a treant! They were of course getting very worried as we'd be gone a *long* time.

Francesc hops back and fetches the rest. Inda is sad, of course, to leave the wrecked ship. Some mementos are salvaged and a prayer is said. Penny approaches Inda; "It was a fine ship, and I'll wager, a fine crew. I'm sorry for your losses. Ships can be replaced, but people cannot." "At least here, they are in the presence of *some* kind of divine and they will not fade quickly - they will not turn to dust nearly as fast as on any other plane." The strange purple colour, we notice, is already starting to fade as the region fades back to the featureless silver appearance of the sea. The rest of what remains of Havoc is turning entirely to stone.

The Hadozi are a bit sad as they only got a few small chunks - they got attacked - and wanted to stay to mine more. At least they have some idea how to get back, but currently think it's far too hazardous! Arturo suggests that what they've got so far can be seed money for a _proper_ expedition.

Navigation back to the Outlands portal goes well - only 1 day in practice. On the way we learn that Cirrit isn't a gnome - she is a strange celestial being that takes on human form.



## Sigil day 7
### LEVEL 12

We know the rod will give us some idea of where the third segment is. Thorin is good with this segment. WIS save again; 21. He connects and senses as presence. It is telling him something he can't understand as if a "ping" of the rod is coming in through a thick stone wall. It's muffled.

Francesc and Arturo don't think this sounds at all like what they saw. Arturo has a go but WIS save is very low; he is stunned and it takes a while for Francesc to even realise he needs help; she yanks the rod out of his hand which means Francesc now has to WIS save. 25. Good...

...(Meanwhile Penny is chatting to Thorin. She remembers the poem. The third location was a word cut off from all others, which might explain that "had to hear" effect. She also remembers being told by Figaro about a place we saw Vecna invade called Eberron, which was meant to be cut off)...

Francesc ends up seeing a blasted, destroyed area. A ruined, scorched landscape - as if a truly gargantuan fireball had gone off. There is mist or smoke. Poking through some of it are strange, ruined colossi - 100-120ft tall creatures, made of metal, but they seem to have ceased functioning in various poses. It's like a long-abandoned battleground for some major war. There are strange storms of energy travelling through the land. In the very far distance seems to be some kind of glinting spire, visible in late-day sunset, and in that distant area land looks normal; forests, a mountain, and maybe a glimpse of an ocean?

As quickly as the vision appeared, it fades.

Penny asks if it sounds like Eberron. Francesc thinks it matches with what we've heard and read. We get Figaro's help. Yes... But it's cut off. That world and the near-myth of Athos are the only two known of.

**So, how can we ever each it?**

Suddenly the captain of the Arrow yells out - "Hold onto something!" - and there's a strange jolt as the ship lurches through into the Outlands plane. The Astral Sea, we suddenly realise, never felt like you are really moving at any speed - but a material plane is quite different. The ship is moving very quickly, wind screaming through the rigging, but decelerating quickly.

We all go to the top deck to watch as we descend into Trade Gate. Arturo perception 8, Penny 10, Thorin 12, Francesc 21. It makes sense as Francesc's skills make her used to seeing things at a distance and spotting potential threats. What *is* that... A familiar structure, moving, almost walking? It's a tower, painted red, with a red roof that looks like a bar. It's *not* the walking house we were in before, but it's the same kind of thing.

Francesc points it out to Penny, excited. Penny tries to convince the captain to detour! She's been paid in full many times over... But we do have a silver sword we must give back. So we can only do a fly-buy. Persuasion 29.

**Yes, it's the tower from our keep - the original rocket, "red barn" section. It's on legs and in the Outlands. How?!**

It's a good 3-4 miles away from Trade Gate. Penny asks Inda - do *we* have to return the sword? Another githyanki can, but Penny must ask. So Penny asks! With Arturo's help, Persuasion 25, initially they assume we must have killed them but they're confused since we came looking for *them* as one was a creche mate. So, they agree; **they take the sword and will return it.**

A rope ladder is lowered. As we're about to go down, the Hadozi make one last attempt to persuade us that a 50:50 split is too harsh. Persuasion 20; Penny notes we got a big chunk from inside the heart so decides on 70:30. They agree. We are given two small chunks. We don't know how much they're worth.

Inda appears to be saying goodbyes to her former crew; she slings a small backpack on her bag and comes to the rope ladder we are next to. Penny asks, "Are you coming down with us?" "That's what I was charged with! I am here to help you complete your aim. Until your mission is complete, mine is not. Do you have need for a chef and a mage?" "Hell yes!" Then Daveras and the Blink Dog if we have need for a gardener and watch dog. We point at the "mystery tower" - maybe?! They might as well come with us. But Redbud probably can't climb down a rope ladder. But there's been a rest... So we eschew the rope ladder and just the Helm instead as we had, that morning, found one charge back on the Helm.

We shout our own farewells.

We drop down in front of the tower and try to get their attention! Francesc tries shouting out, "Gertude! Albert!" - and we join in. A face appears at a window; a familiar Dragonborn; they shout, "It can't be!" - and that's what we're thinking too; surely that's not...

...the tower stops and grinds down to the ground. Out run Mayastan, Vilhamena and Alfred! **"We have so much to tell you!"**

(End of act 2, part 7)
