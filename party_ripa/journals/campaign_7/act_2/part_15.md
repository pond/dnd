# RIPA: Act 2 Part 15
## Session 61 (2025-04-01)
### On the ground, outside Trade Gate, time unknown

We have retrieved the third rod segment from Llandro. Penny carries their consciousness in a gem; they wanted to "see the world" and apparently believed they can do that from there. In Penny's mind, though, this victory comes at a terrible price. The rod's removal triggered a self-destruct, resulting in an explosion the likes of which Penny had never even dreamed possible - a truly gargantuan blast. She has little doubt that _every living thing_ within tens, or even hundreds of miles of Llandro must have been obliterated - every single creature we met, and every place we visited there.

Our portal back was via a special glass rod which, when broken, whisked us to this place. It was a rough transfer and we all lie prone in the dirt outside Trade Gate.

We're initially unconscious and when we awaken, we see a circle of people standing above us, thinking we're dead. CON checks for ordering:

* Thorin 23
* Arturo (not rolled, Thorin got 23)
* Francesc 16
* Penny 5

...Thorin realises it's not just a few people, it's a crowd. Some 60-odd at a guess! Someone reaches out a hand to help him up. Slowly. the rest of us come to. We don't know how long we've been there - someone found us maybe 20 minutes ago, but we don't know how long it was before then. We are told it is...

### ...early morning (Outlands relative day 11 presumed)

Penny is still half-asleep. "Wait, what? Check - no offence, Thorin, check belongings!" We do a quick check; it seems OK. Looks like whoever found us first was indeed this person, luckily, and they're honest.

We need privacy and some rest. We head towards our keep. We've missed a night's sleep, from our reckoning, yet feel comparatively rested.

Penny asks people who they're feeling.

* Thorin thinks the explosion was inevitable. It's better we got the rod than have it in the hands of others.
* Francesc concedes that but the magnitude was well beyond what she expected.

Thorin wonders if it's suspicious - that the person we "rescued", the researcher, had that glass rod. How did she know it was for us?

* Penny would like to blame Vecna but it's on us. She, too, concedes Thorin's point but can't reconcile it against us not checking the repercussion of "self destruct". Is Llandro to blame, in part? What use was it to give a 30 second warning? Did he not know anyway?

* From her perspective unavoidably there's much to atone for!

We wonder if that's the kind of explosion that generated the wasteland in the first place.

At the tower, Inda is already up and saw us with a spyglass. She flies to intercept. "You're back! What's happened in the last week since you were here?!"

### Adjusted - Outlands relative day 15 (based on 6 days since departure)

Well, for us it's only been 2-3 days! Mayastan arrives at the front door, too. He seems very eager. He's especially curious about the rod. Penny, insight 19 - it seems like he's himself! He wants us to check out the rod in the library. In the library, Mayastan isn't allowed to watch. It could be dangerous! Arturo insists.

Thorin feels he can do best with the rod - but Arturo pushes forward; and Francesc has it in the bag right now, it's not stashed in the in-armour bag. Arturo grabs it! Penny's stood back, but not so far as to take the party out of range of her protective aura. As a result, his WIS save is 23. This time, it feels stronger... And now that he reflects on it, the second was stronger than the first. Each is harder than the one before.

* The rod can reverse gravity.
* It's telling him the next piece location... It can't connect us to there directly but shows visions of the last information it seems to have.
* A lush civilisation; two moons; ancient Egypt style; pyramids, palm trees, a great river.
* The rod fragment itself seems to be being carried on the backs of slaves, which is on top of a silk cushion, in full view.
* It is brought to someone who looks like maybe a king of pharaoh with a vizier; the king has a maniacal, power-hungry look and puts it into a specially made space of an ornate sceptre

Tasha had said she suspected the piece was on Athas and that matches the vision. We'll have to wait to get a way to it!

* We note that "a rune for a deathly shadow / Shadow Fell" must've been a misinterpretation on our part, or that segment has different rules

Arturo relays the information. At that moment, a knock at the door; it's Alustriel! She confirms that the Kalashtar agent was indeed someone they sent. And the good news - two possible ways to Athas. THe bad news - when we get there, we're on our own. We can be sent there with an artefact to get back, but their research indicates low confidence on being able to return!

She asks what we know about Athas - not much! - so various scrolls and books are produced.

* An older world, a planet-wide civilisation and great magic
* The jewel of the material plane for a time
* Tasha believes this is where "civilisation" first met a being that tried to expand move beyond its world, and was trapped; but it's believed this ancient creature, far older than Vecna, has now found a way to ally with him
* Their physical form is variable but most recent writings say, "the god king" (and we wonder if this is what Arturo saw in the vision; it seems likely)
* When the Dukes Of Aqsa - who created the Rod - decided to disperse the 7 parts, Athas was still accessible to those who could walk between planes. It was still supposed to be a safe place as the locations of the various parts weren't widely known.

Sometimes creature escape from Athas and that's how Tasha found a way in (because of someone who found a way out). Half-giants. They describe a very different world from those recorded in texts. Perhaps due to Vecna, all gods have been erased from that world. "And because it's cut off from all other planes... There is no divine magic."

Penny asks for clarification and, yes it is as bad as it sounds. (Tasha later explains that Penny's magic is *not* drawn directly from her god; she *chooses* to believe in Meliki).

Apparently the surface is mostly devastated now too - mostly rock, sand and dust. There's very little else, in tiny pockets of land. Druidic magic therefore could be an issue unless also tied to remnant areas of life force.

As for arcane magic, well it's _usable_ - but allegedly it was overuse of such that resulted in the world degrading to the state it is in, and **any user of such magic has to make a choice**: Greatly limit their powers from the bare minimum from the Weave; or grab hold and use a lot, but that **draws the life-force** from the surrounding area!

Also, magic items that tend to draw on the weave won't work; dragons are almost non-existent; and metal and wood are extremely rare (metal especially). The rod we used on Eberron was a prototype with magic "built in" for one-shot use and we'd be given something similar. It should, in theory, work.

The conversation turns to practicalities. The party's discussions about what they might take or do seem to differ from Alustriel's ideas, and despite trying to explain that we are neither rash nor lacking in understanding, she doesn't seem to think we're talking about the right things, yet isn't drawn to describe what we *should* talk about. Things sour. In the end, she says to Mayastan, "I told you they weren't ready" - then to us, "I will return in a day. Tell me your decision then. If you're not ready, I won't give you the return rod. You're not the only people available to us."

And that's that.

Alustriel left all the notes on the desk, in her haste. Francesc examines them - Invest.24; a lot of stuff hand-written was transcribed from things people said. That includes gladiators and half-giants.

* The half-giants found themselves in the margins of the Realm of Fire - Athas *can* access the elemental realms
* Some of their priests can draw upon elemental magic and travel through elemental chaos, skirting around the Fires of the Abyss, then ending up in the Plane of Fire
* From there, the Outlands

That could be her "old route".

There are drawings! Ah. There we go. Now we might have some idea of what they wear (Art of Brom / Dark Sun) - it's... Wild.

Tasha turns up, at Mayastan's behest. We chat. Turns out the Fire realm is *Tasha's* idea - the other option is the Plane of Shadow. Go through the Shadowfell. We have to be killed (!) and then our souls travel through. Burial rites are needed to send things into the spirit world with us.

Eventually, we don't decide anything but head with Tasha into Trade Gate to try and figure out what we need.

* Gems instead of coins
* Arturo gets some face painter kinda person to help us "get in disguise". Penny and Arturo are rather pale-skinned... We'll had to do something about that, too
* We run into some Thri-Keen; they recognise Penny & Arturo's burgeoning disguises (from old family drawings of long ago) and Arturo makes up a story about having an Athas party; they have chitinous armour they could lend us (well, with adaptation, we don't have 6 arms!)

And so-on; individually we record what we need and manage our purchases.

* Stone or bone blades; those working with stone need to be more STR-based, with bones more DEX-based

Thorin decides to try and exchange his Eberron trade bars at the bank. *That's* an interesting conversation. It takes some convincing... Turns out to be 17 * 5000gp and the unmarked discs - aren't currency! We exchange in rubies (10), diamonds (50) and emeralds in various denominations.

Back at the keep we catch up with Redbud, Daveras and others catch up. The bastion has been busy and made 4 potions of Greater Healing too. It seems we're inclined more towards the fire plane than the death option! Penny was curious about the latter; it lined up with the  rod runes, after all; but Tasha is more confident with the other option and, frankly, so are we. In particular the difficulty of getting all our items over there is quite high.

Bed time. WIS saves all round!

* Penny 20
* Arturo 9
* Francesc 21
* Thorin 22

Arturo has no rest. He has a vision, walking, somewhere the Astral Sea only he's walking. He heads towards a strange swirling ball of rapidly moving darkness. Next, he's encountering Vecna only Vecna is facing somewhere else... Another battle; feels like the battle of Waterdeep. He's creeping up behind... Is he on Vecna's side?! No - Vecna doesn't know he's there. He sees a spark on his fingers? Then suddenly it becomes a flame; he can't shake it off his hand; then he unleashes it onto Vecna - it burns him and everything around - the whole world. The seas boil. Clouds evaporate. Cries and wails of devastated communities; people looking for lost ones... He can't wake up...



## Outlands relative day 16

...Francesc can hear Arturo wailing and shouting in his sleep. It's quite a commotion. She goes in; Arturo is a mess! He's tangled in bed clothes, sweating heavily, apparently in distress but asleep. She shakes him awake. He almost feels - sunburned.

Arturo feels like he was the one who "dried out" Athas. **That black ball swirling? The Obscura.**

Alustriel arrives atop a pegasus. The moment she sees that, Penny casts Find Greater Steed (DM fiat, instant casting not 10 minutes) - a bigger pegasus, shiny silver; the two dance around in the air for a while, before finally landing in front of the tower.

Alustriel dismounts, nods towards Penny (who dismounts). "Big day, big decisions. Was that fun?" "Yes. I've not done that before!" "Newly acquired skill?" "I guess so" "Fantastic beasts." (Penny will have to leave the steed behind, of course!)

A tea set with already-brewed tea is produced and we return the notes. She sees our "costumes" (we were hoping for something a bit more convincing?), there's a little bit of bridge mending; and yes, we *are* going and yes, we've gone for the fire option (and Tashs is already drawing the circle!)

So, Alustriel pulls out four dried leaves, giving us one each. "Crush it, put it in a glass of water and drink it". Some sort of protection? We all drink them - and according to Alustriel, it's basically protection against immediate death - well, once. We don't fall unconscious, we bounce. Death Ward - but indefinite.

We get in close, into the circle. Tasha passes over to Alustriel - who casts Resilient Sphere around us - then Tasha finishes off the circle runes. She reaches into a bag and pulls out a small, strange, dripping, uuuh, small demon maybe? It has arcane sigils carved into it. And she cuts it! Its firey entrails are dripped around the circle, until the creature is just ash and dust. The liquid fire fills in the runes, then expands around the sphere as we see other people from the keep stepping back a little, but watching on in some horror; Alustriel and Tasha complete spells together and reality warps.

We get the sense that we'd have been actually crushed by whatever is happening outside, but for the sphere. The flames dissipate somewhat and now we see a crazy world of spinning pillars of lava, rock, mud and sludge flying around, crashing into the sphere. It shakes us around, but we're safe inside, it seems. We seem to be travelling through the landscape though it's hard to judge progress; over a waterfall of lava at an 'edge'; some kind of battlefield, gigantic, creatures everywhere; another lava waterfall; and everything is just pure fire. CON saves.

* Francesc 10
* Arturo 23
* Penny 16
* Thorin 37

Thorin and Arturo are fine. The group emerges from the plane of fire into some kind of free-fall, in clouds, bits of lava and fire and slag streaking off the outside of the sphere; we're moving *very* quickly towards the ground. But Penny and Francesc have passed out.

The two awake see that the world below is close to a uniform colour; a sandy, golden red with some areas a bit darker, some lighter. Arturo perception nat 20; a mountain range, almost crescent-shaped, on one side, uniform sand; tucked behind in a valley - green? Trees? Golden spires rise up. A city! Somehow it looks familiar, ah! The rod vision. The valley is where the river was. The uniform sand; that's where the ocean used to be...

...But that is a very long way away....

...On the other side of the mountain range, past some very tiny pockets of oasis - so there are such things here - a section full of rock mounds, very different landscape, a clifftop mesa strewn with boulders...

...and then the sphere crashes into the side of the mesa, near the rock mounds. The resilient sphere collapses and we're strewn all over. Arturo has the presence of mind to grab some kit to draw a very hasty map of what he can remember.

Penny and Francesc are jolted back awake on contact with the ground.

"Oh well done, you didn't throw up (!)" says Penny.

Reddish brown earth; a layer of dust and silt covers it; rocky area; very hot despite being a *little* sheltered by the mesa; an area of sand is nearby; but the sun, not far off straight above is scorching, almost unbearable to look at. We'll need something to cover our eyes.

Well, wherever we are, we're certainly on Athas.
