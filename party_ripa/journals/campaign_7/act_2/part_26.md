# RIPA: Act 2 Part 26
## Session 72 (2025-08-19)
### Athas, city of Tyr, in the Temple - combat! (Outlands relative / campaign day 27)

> _(Aside: Outlands-relative day tracking is entirely scrambled with day-night cycle reversal and potential time rate differences on planes, so from here, things are counted in approximate "campaign days" starting from the time we first reached the Outlands, following the fall of Toril)_

We are fighting the self-proclaimed king of Tyr. Initiative continued:

* Thorin 24
* Zorhanna 23
* Francesc 21
* (Arturo Has Left The Chat)
* Mynos 18
* Penny 11

Karnak has transformed into a skeletal dragon. His lair - this whole temple - currently prevents any healing. Mynos has used Reality Warp, temporarily paralysing himself and Karnak. Arturo's whirlwind suddenly seems to get out of control and a rift opens next to him...

**He vanishes!**

Penny doesn't have time to worry about it. Karnak's just about within reach. Sculls are scattered and she could jump around the piles. ATHL 23, she gets there. He's paralysed, so she has the advantage. A hit, with blinding smite, total 22 damage, CON 19 save; he'd fail, but simply chooses to resist! A second hit does 15 more damage.

(Francesc notes and calls out a change in this new form via Hunter's Mark - immune to acid, poison and being poisoned, charm, fear, *can* be knocked prone now at least; resistant to psychic *and* now necrotic too).

Thorin, seeing the creature immobilised, brings down a L7 moonbeam. 44 potential damage but the save is made, so, 22 taken. He runs up to get across from Francesc and Penny as best he can.

Zorhanna says, "Boy, what are you doing?! You'll kill yourself!" - Mynos floats, eyes solid blue, pitting his life force (permanently) against Karnak's. She moves to a better position and throws a lightning bolt. DEX save, nat 1; this forces him to blow a 2nd resistance; even so, he still takes 12 damage.

Karnak's incapacitated; he's able to resist some things we've thrown at him, but can't seem to break out of Mynos' influence yet - we get the feeling though that he's just *waiting* for his time to act. He's under the Moonbeam effect and fails his save but uses 3rd resistance to reduce 36 -> 18 damage.

Francesc, perception 13; it's enough to realise that the room might chance into another form of attack yet again. For now, people still can't heal. She can see Thorin and Penny across from the giant creature, so figures she can bring in an arrow that includes an area of effect without risking them (DM ruling on a 5ft radius with an attack aimed at a side across from where other party members are, given that Karnak conceptually occupies 3x3 5ft squares!)

She fires a +1 arrow with Hail of Thorns. Nat 20! 67 total (magical) damage, 67 taken. Second attack, ADV 19 to hit; sadly, misses; luck point, 29 and hits. 14 more damage. She runs further back, entering a large chamber which is some kind of huge ritual room. Chained up on the walls are undead templars and prisoners, the life force sucked out of them - that was probably a recent thing...

Karnak has a brief moment as Mynos' influence begins to fade. He chooses to release what he knows as the Defiler's Doom - energy he previously drew in is blasted outwards in a powerful necrotic wave to a 60ft radius. Even Zorhanna's Globe of Invulnerability can't stop it from passing through. We all take 4d10 ->  25 damage; **and that takes Francesc down**; we have disadvantage on CON saves for a while. Thorin has to save to hold his spell; his advantage is negated but he's within range of Penny's aura - 27. The spell stays up.

Mynos takes a whopping 29 damage from repeating his Reality Warp spell - but Penny uses Soothe Pain and lowers the damage additionally taken by 1d10+5->12 (his max HP are now *permanently* 68hp and he's only at 41 out of those).

Penny runs around to flank (in case it helps) and sees Francesc is down; she shouts a warning to Thorin; then she gets a hit, L3 Divine Smite for 1d8+d8+4d8+d8+5 -> 45 damage. A second hit does 10 more. He's sapped a little, too; if Karnak gets a chance to try and attack, he'll be at a disadvantage initially. Penny religion 32, she realises that the anti-healing effect is still present; Thorin arcana 24; he senses a strange magical field and realises the same thing as Penny.

Thorin activates Primal Savagery and tries to tear into Karnak but can't get a good hit. He Moonlight Steps past, into the corridor between Karnak's main room and the strange sacrifice room where Francesc lies.

Zorhanna uses Magic Missile, high level, 19 damage.

Karkak is about to act - but the moonbeam is still up. He manages to avoid the worst of it; but the 18 damage is all it took. **He starts to peel apart in the light; ash upwards, bones tumbling down into a big pile where he once stood**. It seems he held nature life force within his being and now this explodes outwards. **Dead trees rise, leaves unfurl, flowers bloom** even within this terrible place.

Penny perception 19, Thorin 21; as she's holding up her shield, she hears Thorin yell something out. Penny, ATHL check - Thorin saw a rod start to fall but Penny just clips the edge of it and it spins away, clattering across the ground. She scrambles to fetch it.

In the sacrifice room, Francesc wakes up - *just* - at 1hp. Perception 24; she looks around, wondering what's happening. The undead chained to the walls have turned to ash. But the ground is starting to tilt, as if everything is sinking into sand. It looks like it's sinking at - fourth wall moment! - about 10ft per round.

Penny sees the rod bounce towards Zorhanna, who catches it. Unable to do much in the instant she turns back a moment, a few feet, sees Francesc sat up; turns *again* and runs back into the main room, shouting to Zorhanna and Mynos - "Time to go!" - but Mynos collapses down to the ground. She grabs him and, while she runs past Zorhanna, calls over, "*We'll* be taking that, thank you...". But at that moment (survival 10) she isn't sure which way we came in

Francesc has cast Cure Wounds, given she's perilously close to death. Survival 28 - she knows the best way out.

We're all shouting at each other - ideas of Moonlight Step, Longstrider, even breaking the "transport pyramid" and portalling out of this whole plane together. Then Zorhanna suddenly shouts, "To me if you value your life!"

WIS 21 for Thorin - he's right next to a bunch of treasure dropped amongst the bones of Karnak, who was *dripping* with wealth. He starts shoving things into his bag. Zorhanna is getting very animated! She *insists* we move next to her - Thorin Moonlight Steps up. Penny has to do a full 180 - ATHL 22 - it's OK, she makes it. Mynos is breathing, but unconscious.

The roof is now only 10ft above us...

...Zorhanna casts Teleport. And it works!

----

We appear in a courtyard. It seems to be just inside the inner city. We can see the Ziggurat a few hundred feet away, crumbling down, pulling other buildings with it. People are screaming from that *and* from the halflings, who are fully feral. Elves on top of buildings whoop and cheer! Thorin casts Mass Cure Wounds, L5, 27 - healing everyone. Some of the healing spins off and catches an injured halfling nearby (it'll heal 6 people; our party is 5).

Mynos wakes up in Penny's arms. He's weakened, but alive. "Arturo kept his word", she says to him, helping him position himself to see the crumbling ziggurat.

The mood around us changes. Dwarves in nearby houses are being dragged out by other citizens, who seem to be looting. That's understandable - but *not* good. Penny wonders - insight 23 - if anything can be done about the unfolding chaos. Can they be persuaded to rebuild together? She looks to her other two party members. "Need a bit of help here!" - Guidance is cast, by both!

With Zorhanna helping, Penny tries to jump up onto a vantage point of some kind. Seeing her struggle, Mynos levitates her! Thorin casts Faerie Fire to draw attention. It's daytime, but it's still visible.

"Don't become what you hate!" she starts. **Persuasion ADV with Guidance - 31**.

Some people stop and listen. That causes more to stop. And more. Elves start spreading the word. Citizens stand down, at least somewhat - they don't *kill* the nobles, but they still take what wealth they think they want or need. Art, wines, perfumes - and a lot of examples containers with water.

(The three party members have an in-depth conversation about what kind of cheeses they like, with Zorhanna looking astonished and almost annoyed at our frivolity!)

We are beckoned by one of the elves not underground, but to the Elven Market. We learn that many in the Veiled Alliance died, but many lived; a mansion has been 'requisitioned' as a centre of the relief effort. We are taken there, too. And at the mansion, Zorhanna leads with - "We need to chat".

"Is this an 'us' talk?" asks Zorhanna.

"Yes" says Zorhanna. She starts to offer Mynos an "in" but Penny interrupts; "Oh, he's *definitely* coming!"

In a side-room, Zorhanna casts a warding spell and produces the rod. "I didn't know this was here, but suspected. This was the first plane that Vecna experimented upon and sapped all the energy from. But there was an imbalance; a missing part to the equation; and it was this rod. I didn't intend to get it..."

"...*you* didn't. *We* did" says Penny.

"But we have to take this rod away. And this rod is the only thing keeping this world alive."

"What? Say that again?" asks Thorin.

"If we take this rod away, this world will slowly wither and die."

"How slowly?" asks Penny.

"I don't know" answers Zorhanna. The TL;DR is that the energy of the world was sapped - *all* of it - but someone brought the rod. And it was probably Karnak, her research indicates, that started with probably good intentions; but at some point the rod's power corrupted him.

Thorin's insight tells him that it's just a theory, but Zorhanna does believe that the probability is very high that - whether fast or slow - the world will decline. After a moment, Thorin says, "We came here to get that rod; the catastrophic failure to take down Zorhanna would destroy countless worlds, not just this one!"

"Yes. But it's not a great situation. I'm assuming Alustriel sent you to retrieve this?"

Francesc hopes we could get the job done before the plane withers and dies. But Mynos won't accept it; he'd always been told he could pretty much recreate the world.

Penny checks a note she made a long time ago. Rod segment 4 - rebuild/regenerate. Perhaps we could *use* the rod. Mynos and Thorin say in concert, "Why don't we walk to the druids?"

Francesc takes the rod off Zorhanna. Nothing - no reaction. No psychic effects. Perhaps it's cut off; perhaps it doesn't work that way.

Penny says, "I'm not ready to give up on this world, especially after what we did on Eberron. We must at least *try* the druids."

Zorhanna agrees to come with us. There are many lush trees up here now! By chance, Thorin still has a spell ability to cast Transport With Plants. We need a big tree as we find that elves and halflings would all like to get out of the city and, in due course, the word gets out; people gather below; and eventually, after much organisation and waiting, with that crazy old druid in tow - very much still alive! - we are all transported to the druid grove. While all that's happening, Francesc examines the frescoes and other art in that underground, ruined temple; investigation 29; at first glance, much seems evil! A lot of Karnak. But looking closer - there's a lot of helping people, regenerating plants, in *original* art. The additions of plants being used by Karnak are later additions. Several generations of them, in fact. It's a sorry tale - he didn't destroy the world; he was trying to save it.



### Thorin's druid grove

Penny helps Thorin talk to the Elders about the possible consequences for the world if the rod is taken (without actually mentioning the rod - it's a more abstract talk about the ongoing failure of magical powers).  ADV persuasion 25 (DM fiat, allowed to come from Thorin or Penny).

They think "nature is nature; nature is bountiful, if protected and carefully used and the life-force is returned - it can never run out; it *can't* run out". Thorin argues that Vecna has drained the world. Yet they can still wield it. Our best guess, we say, is that we think the rod is constantly pumping out magic, regenerating things.

We think hard. Francesc remembers Candlekeep studies. Words that used to be much more magical - even Toril; the Netherese cities used up so much magic, that there was left overall in the world. Perhaps magic can slowly just sort of "self regenerate", in the way a forest recycles its nutrients, but it's very slow. Magic users typically draw faster than this regeneration. Energy is *not* merely converted from one form to the other. It can be "spent".

Telling people to restrict usage would help, but the other Sorcerer Kings are still there. Telling *them* to reign in their usage is going to be tough!

"So it's not over. We've overthrown the most powerful one - but we need to overthrow the others too?"

"Absolutely" says Thorin. But they must swear to secrecy... He wants to tell them all of it; rod, Vecna, the lot. 29 persuasion. High enough. The old druid we brought back (contested check was only 13!) is on his side. The chief of this grove - rolled 17+7->24 - beaten!

There is only one think they ask of us. While the rod is still here, we spend the next two days helping them in a high-level circle ritual of plant growth (L10, in essence!) - six spellcasters needed - Zorhanna, us, the elder druid and the grove chief druid.

Penny answers before anyone else can speak; a simple, definitive, "Yes".

(Later, Francesc gives Penny the rod).

There is an almighty celebration that night. We hear second-hand that there's a huge celebration in Tyr too.

That night, Mynos finds Penny in a quiet corner. "I feel like my purpose is spent!" he says. "I don't know why, but I don't feel like I belong here anymore. This world doesn't need me. I don't have a reason to be". Penny looks to Thorin and beckons him over. Mynos continues, "I always knew what I needed to do. And I thought it would feel a lot better than this - but all I feel is empty. I fulfilled my purpose! I'm useless now."

Thorin says, "I don't think you're useless now! No matter what you choose, you could have an impact on this world, or another plane - our offer still stands - you're invited to come with us to the next plane, if that is what you choose."

"I think I have to" he answers. "I don't even know how to make the decision myself, really."

"Let us show you what we're fighting for" says Penny. "Let us show you the scale, and the scope of it."

"If I come with you - is it - will I - will people accept me?"

Penny laughs. "There are every kind of person you could imagine and *all* of them have your place."

Thorin adds, "There's infinite variations of people that exist out there, and almost everywhere that we have been, there has been a level of acceptance - despite *us* not being the norm either!"

"Then I should like to come with you when you go. Now. How does htis work?" - he picks up a tankard.

**"You can always drink more, but you can't drink less!"** answers Thorin.



## Long rest -> LEVEL 14 -> Campaign day 28

Later that night, in the blur of alcohol, emotion and general revelry, Thorin thinks to empty the bag and see what treasures he might have grabbed.

Things of value - Thorin, D100 - 6! - and 6d10 -> 5, 2, 6, 6, 5, 8.

* A brass mug inlaid with jade carvings of dragons (250gp)
* A carved ivory stauette worth 250gp (wait, *WHAT?!*, only 250gp?!)
* A gold cone with eyes shaped like dragons, art object, worth 750gp
* An empty bronze bottle with a cork embossed with gold leaf and set with amythists (750gp)

**(Side note: Rich real-life question: "What were you thinking when you were stuffing the bag?!")**

* A pair of gloves made of chain links, but set into each link is a diamond (2500gp)
* A large set of gold nose-to-earrings, thick and heavy, worth **7500gp**

Three other things:

* Francesc D100 -> 13 -> arcana table chosen -> D100 -> 9 -> a large brooch, which we learn is a Brooch of Shielding - curious, Karnak must not have been attuned given Magic Missile hit!
* Thorin D100 -> 23 -> arcana table chosen too -> D100 -> 17 ->  a beautifully decorated crystal Decanter Of Endless Water (well, Arturo *did* give ours away)
* Penny D100 -> 9 -> historical relic table chosen -> D100 -> 45 -> a Periapt of Wound Closure

Final addition D100 roll - 5. Statistically speaking, this whole set of D100 rolls has been... Unlikely. Anyway, utility/implement table chosen - D100 -> 53 -> a curious ornate dagger; but it's Karnak-scale, so it looks more like a scimitar. It seems to be magically charged; requires attunment, we'll need to find out more later (**Enspelled Scimitar**), bound to **Level 8**. We think that maybe Sunburst might be connected to it. For now, we think Francesc could make best use of it.



## Long rest -> Campaign day 29

At the end of this day, the 2-day ritual is over. Rich plant growth spreads out for around 100 miles around us!



## Long rest -> Campaign day 30

Goodbyes all round. This is a pivotal moment for Mynos; we hope he will find his place on another plane, for there is little chance to return here. Eventually, we're ready to use the "pyramid". Zorhanna fortunately has a good idea how it works. She puts it on the ground, says "don't let go" - we all hold hands - and stomps on it!

There's a very jarring, warping planeshift. CON saves - all good except Penny, nat 1! Zorhanna not so good either; we both take 5 psychic damage!

We reappear in a cottage. There's a yelp as someone nearby steps back hastily - ah, it's Tasha! **"Woah. Zorhanna!? What? Where have you been - I mean - how are you together? And who is this bald child?!"**

(End of act 2, part 26)
