# RIPA: Act 2 Part 21
## Session 67 (2025-06-24)
### Athas, city of Tyr, underground (Outlands relative day 22)

We're deep down, below a temple, with people who want to resist the King but don't know how. The King is going through a transformation - possibly to a black dragon - their inner sanctum is filled with an acidic mist.

We know that an elf called Zorhanna got captured; we have her bag; she has very high level spells in a spellbook - how did she manage here? Perhaps excessive magic use is why she got caught. We don't know if she is alive, though.

There's also Simera - a hothead troublemaker, but she acts and she knows her way to that sanctum. Our plan of action seems unanimous:

* Find Simera
* Free the mage, with help from Simera personally or using information she has
* Talk to Minos about the plan to take down the king
* Infiltrate and do it (dispatch the templars?)

...persuasion: Arturo wins the day with 28 and we manage to find people who might know more about Simera's location. She's been on a vendetta lately! Talking about how a dwarf syndicate that needs to be taken down; it has been trading in sex slaves; she knows where they are operating from, a grim trail of bodies of dead too-young people who had been forced to work for them. A performance space called "**The Notorious**" is at the centre of that. But it can't be accessed from the underground; it's off the main parade in the noble's area.

Francesc persuasion 15, meanwhile, finds out that there's a small elven community in the city. "**The Elf Market**" is the term used for it - not slaves! - an underground black market on the other side of the canal/river that flows from the main central garden. Apparently, one can buy just about anything there.

We ask if we can walk around into richer areas of town without passes/guard checks. The underground network has an exit leading to the *edge* of the noble district but not inside it. Patrols are high; the nobles don't like riffraff. We *can* just walk  in there; but if we don't look like we belong, we will be questioned. An elf, in particular, would need to "look" like a servant.

OK - clothes. Elf market.

We're led to an exit on "this" side of the canal and shown how to get back. It's a sort of cellar within a warehouse. Arturo starts on a map. And there it is - a canal, complete with gondolas travelling on it! Twin-moonlight makes for indistinct shadows. It's busy. We see a bridge quite nearby and note two distinct kinds of groups of people here; some seem businesslike and others seem like residents. The businesslike people stand out - they look like they have means; not at all poor.

Thorin has to take point, as he's the "rich one". People give us a wide berth as we walk as a result; there's a level of animosity. We don't really get to speak to anyone, but we may as well cross the bridge. Directly in front of us is a collection of warehouses and general service buildings. Lots of people milling about. We see children playing here and there, in small groups; we've not seen that before. They keep well clear of the adults, who seem either self-absorbed or outright grumpy!

Penny decides to grasp the nettle. She spots someone who looks local, gets in their way and demands, "Elf market. Where is it?" - intimidation nat 20 (!) -> 30 total. They seem to think she might be The Authorities and she sees doubt - they might be protecting the location? - so they start on a whole, "it's nothing to do with me!" thing - but does give us the location.

Penny nods. "Thank you", very flat, and we head in the direction with this person as unwilling escort. For his sake Penny keeps up the deception, as she hopes this person won't get into trouble with their community for giving us the location.

Francesc perception 24, Thorin 29. They notice that something unspoken has gone through the crowd. The children have all scattered. More and more adults stand and start gathering from the sides, either falling behind. A few even start to move as if to block our path. Then someone yells out, (DM fiat - language barrier removed for now), "You dirty traitor!" and throws a chicken bone. But he holds firm, walking on and we follow. We get to a sort of warehouse with no walls.

More people are gathering. Thorin shouts out, "We're *not* the authorities!" with Penny trying to chip in with something similar - helps negate his dwarven-in-this-city disadvantage! - persuasion 19. At least they don't attack! Then Francesc has a genius plan; "If we were the authorities, I couldn't do this!" - and slaps Thorin! There's a gasp! "Neither could I" says Penny, doing the same; Thorin pushes her to the ground, but she's laughing loudly as she drops.

Thorin offers to withdraw. It's too confusing. But Arturo points out that it's a bit late for that! Penny offers, "Um, we need clothes to blag our way into the noble's quarter..." "Find a tailor!" "...and maybe an invitation to a party that we don't have yet?"

Pushing to the front is a stringy, wiry, *almost* malnourished person with unusual features. Their ears look like they've been cut off at the tips. Thorin suspects an elf! "Why have you brought your battles here?" they ask.

"What battles? We just want to buy some stuff and leave."

"We know of you! We know what happened in the inn. There is an arrest warrant out for people with your description."

A few people step back, now realising that not only are we not the authorities but, also, we're in trouble with them. Penny asks the that guy that led us in here, "Did you know?" "Yes! Of course! Why else would I have brought you in here?" "See! He knew the whole time!" says Penny, going along with it.

So, the chop-eared elf shrugs. "So are you here to buy anything or not? Come with me" - we're taken to a table which flips up, with stairs leading down to the "real" market.

It smells of - a lot; it's dark; there are quite a lot of people, animal cages, no apparent structure.

Francesc, investigation 25... No obvious organisation at all and no goods apparently even on display in the usual sense. No tables of wares. She gets talking to people; it's more of a network - brokers - who get sent away and come back with items. Arturo, persuasion 30! Clothes and an invitation. There's an element of deception; a "social climbing dwarf" needs to get to the event; that kind of thing.  Apparently this goes down well in part because it's not unheard of - younger dwarves have started doing this kind of thing to try and "climb the ladder".

Clothes, easy. Invitation... Difficult but not impossible - and not cheap either. A rare thing like an invitation requires a rare item in exchange. Gems? Unimpressed, but that'd probably be fine. But we do have a rusty dagger... Arturo tries to get it out of the bag of holding with dexterity (sleight of hand). 19+7, 26! We distract while he extracts - and presents the rusty iron dagger. We huddle around so that only the broker can see it. Their eyes visibly bulge in their head! A look of surprise. Then suspicion. We let him examine it. Clearly unfamiliar with metal.

That works. "Give me two hours. Where will you be? Do NOT come here to get it! Where shall I find you? I assume you need three passes." (Elves don't count, sigh). We're told about a location near the bridge; a big date palm with a specific building facade with a gate, meet behind the gate.

Whatever deal we just made, it seems we made it with this one broker and not within the market. Francesc senses that this elf broker sees an opportunity to climb out of poverty and they're driven; they're motivated to make it work.

We pay other brokers for the disguise clothing. It comes to 2gp, for Arturo and Thorin; they think Penny and Francesc already look like they need to look. But the clothing needs to be worn carefully - there are some cleaned up, patched parts that look clearly like weapons damage.

On a whim, Penny asks if there's anything to protect against acid. To her surprise - yes! It's a sort of salve, made from milk. We would coat ourselves in it. But it's a controlled substance; the milk is banned in Tyr. But it'd cost equivalent 100gp per person; they *will* take gems; we think we might need to bring another person in there - Minos - and they *do* accept that trade, with a diamond and even some change.

We get directed to the exit - not the same direction as the entrance. Better security that way; people head in one place, exit elsewhere. We end up on the side of the canal on a ledge and it takes a while to reach steps to get back out properly, on the same side as the market but a fair distance away.

Arturo wonders if the canal has drinkable water, provided it were magically purified. However, it seems defiled; life-sapping; even magical purification won't help. Drinking it would be *very* bad. He has some in a flask but it's not likely to fool anyone we might *want* to make sick, even if it were purified as the defiling magic signature is very easy to read. Even so, he keeps some in a labelled flask.

We have a good while to wait. Arturo and Thorin try to find out more about this place we're in... Templars, say. Arturo goes for an intimidation approach. 22. He spots his target and gets in there, but realises that he's too late; someone else is bullying the target first! Two armoured guards with long, flowing, red and gold caps march across the street. They hold decorative-looking bone glaives. One swings it flat-side to smack the poor individual they are targeting. Other people around start to not-so-subtly disperse. They're roughing him up; we sense an aura of magic around both guards, curiously, seeping from them in a strange, uncontrolled way that's familiar only to Arturo. Wild magic.

We overhear them trying to blame this guy for the "mysterious rebels". We sense magic is being cast; but the source of the magic is... Unclear. Francesc and Thorin know it's not coming from the land / nature, nor does Penny see it as elemental. Arturo detects that it is being granted, essentially; a few of us realise that it flows from the centre of the city. Lines and waves. **These are templars**.

Despite our time limit, we follow.

As we look more closely while following, we see tiny bits of metal; decorative, mostly, but clearly a show of power and wealth. The templars drag the guy to an "unnecessarily grand" building. Thick bone bars are across the windows. Three storeys; thick walls; a sort of police station, of sorts. We are forced to keep our distance. We see them unlock the door and go inside.

Thorin suggests a Familiar but Arturo is worried - they will probably know it is magical. But Wildshape wouldn't... Or someone stealthy could climb up to windows without being noticed. Francesc sighs. "**Fine!**" - ADV stealth 29. She reaches a side window and looks in. As luck would have it, the room contains the person we saw. They're being questioned, shown items on a table; but curiously, there only seem to be those two Templars inside. It looks as if there'd normally be as many as six based on other items, but perhaps the others are on patrol? They unlocked the door; it must be just them; but there could be other security measures.

There's an upstairs. If she can get up there from the outside, she could sneak down. But the windows are barred. Climbing is as easy as walking for her, though, so - up she goes, right to the top of the building. It's a flat roof but there's a service door of some kind that's not locked. Perception 25, is it trapped? No. *But there is a sensor of some kind*. Walking through the door would set of some kind of detection alarm.

We scuttle over. Francesc drops a rope; Thorin can go up and dispel the magic alarm. He *just* makes it without being spotted; Dispel Magic would alert people if they checked the sensor that it's not there anymore; not doing so and using an illusion would fool a visual sensor but if it spotted movement, we'd be back at needing Dispel Magic. Ah well. Thorin goes with that; the sensor is gone.

It seems mostly storage, but there are marks that indicate people trying to stop themselves being taken *outwards*. He suspects, grimly, that people are sometimes thrown off the top. He goes back to the roof edge and beckons us up; Arturo goes first, and he notices some people walking along the street just before Penny gets noticed on her turn. She waits, and makes it up (technically - Stealth role was nat 1, used Heroic Inspiration; nat 8+5->13).

Francesc sneaks inside with the rest of us close behind. The third floor seems smaller. Lots of rooms, shut doors, a central landing area where a new flight of larger stairs head downwards. No traps but two of the doors are locked. As for the unlocked; one leads to a sort of supply room with Templar armour stored there. She throws some of it into the bag of holding - one set of armour fits Arturo. It'd be a disguise, but he'd be unable to cast magic while wearing it. The other room is a resting room. Of the locked doors, one faces the front and one faces the back of the building. She tries to unlock the former; 24, with thieve's tools. Another bedroom, but this one occupied. A suit of armour is on a stand, slightly different in design, a bigger cape, helmet... Whoever this belongs to cannot be on patrol right now.

Searching around there's a surprising discovery - the remains of a druid's staff, with charges on it, and some stone jewellery too!

We'd better get moving. One more floor - Francesc should creep ahead for that one, at least. On the first floor it's mostly some kind of general hanging out area, but with a curtained-off area that seems to be for some kind of more private conversation. A few plates have some crumbs. There's some water. We grab some of that!

We're trying to be quiet. Down below there are bad sounds; pleading; cries of pain, thudding... Penny heads for the stairs. She knows from what Francesc said that they pop out into that room. They'll see her boots first; she picks up speed as she draws her sword. Meanwhile, Arturo is casting Clairvoyance to get a view on the room below while staying on this floor.

Initiative:

* Francesc 29
* Thorin 24
* Penny 17
* Arturo 8 (was 17, swapped with Penny)

Arturo sees that the guy is on the ground, knee on their back, arm twisted behind them. The other guard has a sort of scrap book with drawings in it! They're so focused on what they're doing that they don't see Penny coming down the stairs.

Penny is promptly overtaken by Francesc. She gets into the room, stepping sideways to avoid blocking the door; the two templars are 10 and 15ft away. The further has the knee on the back of the guy, so she shoots at the 10ft away person - who's facing away from her too. Hunter's mark (they're resistant to fire) - 28 to hit, hits - 22 damage. It strikes in the back of their helmet, cracking it; they spin around and yell out some horrible-sounding word immediately. A wave of intense heat blasts out; a fiendish rebuke reaction. CON save. 5! Oh dear. 22 necrotic damage taken! More channelled-in magic (which Arturo observes via his sensor).

A second attack; 24; hits. 18 damage. She transfers 6 of the damage to the other templar, for good measure. That gets the attention of them both. The second now points and utters the same curse; CON save this time is 17; she takes 24->12 more necrotic damage.

Thorin's up. He pushes past Penny until he can see the room then Moonlight Steps into the room and goes for Primal Savagery, attacking the closer Templar, that Francesc injured more previously. He's positioned between them and Francesc. Moonlight Step provides an advantage; 29 to hit; 19 damage. Penny runs in to attack the other one. She hits; 19 damage, not great given it includes Blinding Smite - and they use something strange (Dark One's Own Luck) to make the CON 19 save. Not blinded. She does hit again, but only 12 damage. Sap is in effect.

The more injured templar acts. They create a burst of hellfire! A strange warp effect happens it the air above Francesc and strange black fire bursts forth. DEX saves all round. Penny: nat 2! Only 7 total. Francesc 24. Thorin 12. 16 fire and 12 necrotic for failures; 14 taken by Francesc. Penny reacts with Soothe Pain to reduce the pain by 8 points. Now a spell is cast; the templar disappears. It even vanishes off the sensor too. Penny can't see them with standard Blind Vision, but Thorin's sense of Arcana indicates that something like Blink was used.

Arturo uses a sorcery point to cast at "natural" level, another for Subtle and uses the sensor to cast Psychic Lance at the remaining Templar. INT 20 is failed - incapacitated, 29 damage taken. As a result, the Templar can't do much at all on its turn; Francesc moves to get a good line of sight and fires. 29 to hit, hits; 16 damage. Fires again; 23 to hit, hits; Piercer skill to reroll; 11 damage. The Templar falls. She sticks close to Penny, within arm's reach...

Thorin can't do much! The other Templar is not visible. He realises the Templar who fell is unconscious *but not dead*. He suspects the vanished Templar might appear in the same place, so he wants to put down a L3 Moonbeam there; but to avoid hitting non-combatants, he pulls the other guy out of the way, who is freaking out and runs into a corner; damage potential is 24.

Penny heals Francesc for 30. She casts See Invisibility and spots the other Templar in the ethereal; she calls out to Thorin that they haven't moved, and would reappear in the moonbeam - but they might yet change position so she backs towards the door and keeps a close eye. As it happens, the Templar reappears in the same position but saves against the worst of Moonbeam, taking 12 damage.

The Templar, from the Ethereal, saw Thorin casting and "blames" him, rebuking; Thorin fails the save (just) and takes 21 damage. CON to save the spell - holds it. Now it tries to escape Moonbeam, skirting around Thorin to avoid opportunity attacks. Then the Templar uses Suggestion on Francesc - "walk into the moonlight" - WIS save 24. She knows what they've tried! The Templar curses; it disappears once more.

Penny's spell means she can see it; if it moves Penny will say so.

Arturo comes down into the room and tries to reassure the beaten-up guy... Francesc prepares an action; she readies her bow... Thorin moves the moonbeam to include the area Penny indicated *and* the guy on the ground and stands close by...

The frightened guy has gathered enough energy to properly panic and looks set to run away. Arturo is managing to talk him off the ledge, fortunately!

Penny chooses to drag the unconscious Templar out of the moonbeam but nat 1, takes a whole action. *That did not go to plan.* He's not tied up and he might regain consciousness.

Moonbeam potential damage: 3d10->11. The templar reappears, takes all 11 damage and issues another rebuke. Thorin CON save; 30. 8 damage taken - but that's this Templar's last act as the radiant light of the moonbeam consumes them.

Arturo runs over to stabilise the Templar that Penny pulled away. Medicine 15; that's enough. Arturo suggests to Penny that questions are pointless and it could just phase away... Self-rolled WIS on a 15 DC, 18. She realises he's right. No choice. She tries channelling a Smite through the sword. Nat 20, because of course it is; the radiant damage has the same effect. No evidence! They both vanished.

Penny asks Francesc if she could please re-lock any unlocked doors. But before that - Investigation/Perception -> 29 highest - a cell in the back of this floor has 3 very weak captives. One is lucid enough to witness what we did. "You must have been sent to deliver vengeance! The angels of vengeance we have heard about! If you can free us in a hurry, please, but the other patrol will be back soon... You must not be caught..."

Penny calls back to Francesc; "Never mind about the locked door!" - we're about to make it obvious that we were here! - and attacks the lock. Hits, total damage 15; the lock is sliced in half. Thorin says, "We were never here!" - the captives draw a strange mark in the ground using some carbon-coated rock that was under the moonbeam; **we figure this is the mark of a rising rebellion**.

We decide we'll leave via the roof. Francesc is fumbling with the other locked door as Thorin sees it all going wrong; casts Guidance; it's a mess but 16 check total just narrowly avoids damaging the tools. (Actually there was an accidental failure to add Prof. Bonus +5, but either way, the door opens). Weapons. Thorin, d100 -> 82 - finds two items of interest. (Meanwhile Arturo is stealing the fancy armour and stuffing it into the bag of holding!)

* A magic-powered sword - a stirring dragon's wrath weapon
* A magical shield; a shell of some sort, imbued with strange energy, but unclear if it is arcane

Penny thinks the sword would be an upgrade; Thorin takes the shield. Up we go!

We have a spare hour until we meet our contact. We find a place to rest a while and change into our "fancy" clothing. Eventually, we get to the right place to meet our contact. They're true to their world - 3 *silk* tickets, bearing a magical sigil. He says nothing other than; "Good luck. I would say 'do not do anything I would not do' but I feel like I have done it all!" - and vanishes.

We head towards The Notorious. It's hard to miss; a fortress. There's a banner - 50th Anniversary, apparently! People outside are having invitations checked. And we see a Drow, for the first time; they look not too different from how we'd see them on Toril. Well-dressed. They're accompanied by a human partner. We see no slaves, one or two with bodyguards though. We're still a very unusually large group... We are going to need a cover story!

We're at the front of the queue. Think fast!

(End of act 2, part 21)
