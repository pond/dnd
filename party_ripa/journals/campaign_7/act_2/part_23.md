# RIPA: Act 2 Part 23
## Session 69 (2025-07-15)
### Athas, city of Tyr, in an alleyway by the burning club The Notorious (Outlands relative day 22)

The party was investigating bad happenings at The Notorious, hoping to find Simera. And, oh boy, did we! Things got out of hand with a huge fight and the club went up in flames. Anyone we managed to free, along with ourselves and a few others who were able to flee, ended up pouring out of a side door into an alleyway.

At least ten templars were running towards the commotion. Before many of us had much time to act, Arturo tried to throw a spell to slow them down. Whatever he had in mind manifested in practice as a vast blast of cold, freezing everything beyond in the alleyway and out to the street behind, catching all the templars and many others besides - but something had gone horribly wrong; we caught a glimpse of some familiar land, were sure we heard birdsong, and then in little longer than a blink, Arturo had vanished.

Simera had shouted "Come with me! We need to run!" at people we rescued but they've barely had time to take a first step down the alley way from the templars; Penny was already mid-way through throwing a vial that shatters into a Darkness spell towards the now-frozen scene in the other direction; despite her astonishment at what she sees, the throw follows through, her already-moving arm almost forgotten about in the moment.

The vial goes wide, bouncing off the wall of The Notorious, but it doesn't break until it hits a frozen figure further down the alley! Our view of that bizarre scene is instantly blocked. Flames are leaping out of side windows where we're able to see them; the alley is filling with smoke.

We run for it. Francesc is faster; she catches up with Simera who is stood by a large grate in the ground - probably a sewer! - and gesturing wildly at people to jump in.

Thorin is worried about the people behind us; are they dead? He's more concerned about us being identified by them than anything else, but that said, we did already have people looking for us anyway. Well, now... There will be many more joining that search. We realise too that in the rush of everything that happened, none of us kept an eye on our ex-"guide". He'd been amongst those who we rescued so probably isn't frozen, but he's also not gone past us into the grate either.

We jump in.

Down below, Simera holds people back. She waits, listening, for footsteps above. Only when she hears nothing does she direct people down waste tunnels, eventually meeting at a large cistern. She points to one that's drier and cleaner; it leads to the (dry!) underground network.

"I'm worried they all know who we are!" says Thorin.

Penny shouts back, "Wait, you're thinking about THAT?! Didn't you see? Arturo vanished!"

Francesc retorts, "But he's done that before."

"But didn't you see - another plane or something? Maybe it was just... An illusion...?" - she tails off.

Thorin shrugs it off; like Francesc, he knows Arturo has vanished before. But Athas is meant to be cut off - only accessed via the Elemental Plane of Fire or Shadowfell.

So Penny says, "Well, I'll call it divine intervention. But we have to hope that if *we leave* and he gets back - well, he's not getting back *here*." But as Francesc points out - curiously, he always seems to return to where we *are* not where we *were*.

Seems we need to proceed quickly with our plans. The level of alert "up top" is only likely to escalate from here. So that means Simera; help us get this elf Zorhanna free, get info from Zorhanna about the king, and attack the king.

Simera is taking flack for the disaster upstairs. The whole resistance movement is threatened. Penny needs Simera on side so lies by omission; "We agreed to work together to free the people in there. And that's what we did" - persuasion 18. It's not the worst outcome, but people still aren't happy. We've made security a big problem. They want to know what *we* will do with the kids. This reminds us of Francesc's "army". Thorin hatches a plan of Transport With Plants... But he'd need to sleep. Oh, then a better idea. Rescue Zorhanna first. Take her out to the elf army; bring *everyone* back and use them to create a big distraction that lets us get into the temple.

Grudgingly it's agreed and people start finding ways to look after the kids. We can finally rest!



## Outlands relative day 23

First thing in whatever passes for morning, intending to *insist* Simera helps us find Zorhanna. The area around is busy. Some kids slept, others didn't - cold turkey from drugs, PTSD, all of it - reports coming in from around the city about the response in the last few hours while we slept.

There's no hiding what happened and the news has spread, so the Templars/city has been forced to be *seen* to act. Rather than trying to make out that the God King did it deliberately or otherwise apply "spin", they have to acknowledge it was someone else. Our ex-guide hasn't helped either, telling people his story - we wonder if he's unknowingly putting himself at risk in so doing!

No sign of Simera, sigh! We cajole someone into looking for her and have breakfast. Thorin spends time talking to elders. We learn that the elves from the elven market have arrived. Someone from the Syndicate turned up with a contract - a currently active bounty on the four of us plus Simera. **It's worth 500,000gp in total or 100,000gp each**. They dispatched (!) the messenger but think we have barely a day or two for it to get out locally and not much longer to get beyond.

Simera is dragged in - literally, kicking and screaming - and dumped in front of us.

Thorin doesn't mess around. "We have *real* work to do now. Where is Zorhanna?"

"Well *while you were sleeping* I've been scoping out the routes! Two are very dangerous. No good. Only one tunnel takes us close to the Cage of Fire" (the prison for magic users) "within the Templar complex". And we also hear that Templars **are now searching underground**.

The noose is tightening. Do we need to bring *everyone* with us? Can we get them through in that time? The tree can stay open for a minute... People would need to run... What's more, there's the location. The only big tree we know of is in a courtyard in the middle of a market! But then Thorin points out - his staff can turn into a tree. Woah.

We wonder how many people there are here. We try to take estimates. Maybe a couple of hundred... No good in one minute, but could be done in two. We come up with an idea of the druid at the grove knowing what's going on. No Arturo... No Sending. Animal Messenger would take a day though.

It goes back and forth. Penny gets lost in endless options and not understanding what anyone's trying to achieve; she bows out, waiting to be told what to do! Thorin crystallises his plan. He speaks to the Veiled Alliance representatives here; he can get some people away to the "grove"; Penny at least can help back him up and reinforce the points he makes. Thorin ADV persuasion dirty 20. He manages to use enough of 'their language' - rebellion, striking back - and they do want to take part in that. They understand the idea of getting maybe 50-100 people out today, in hiding, although that leaves many behind. Then, the next day when magic allows, we'll try to bring out the rest. This'll leave nobody underground, which should confuse the Templars a lot! We can organise our forces in the Grove, then strike back when the time is right.

The Alliance decide who'll go through first. Children, elderly, that kind of thing. The people who stay behind will sow even more confusion - try to distract the guards underground, pull them away on wild goose chases and so-on - which hopefully stops their remaining forces being discovered today, while we get into the Templar complex and rescue Zorhanna.

Thorin writes a Druidic note that is handed to an elf chosen to lead the first group through his tree. He hopes this will convince the druid at the Grove of the veracity of their claim of origin & lead to them being given safe habour. Penny intends to give the decanter of endless water to that same elf... But we realise **Arturo was carrying it** so that's gone. But Thorin remembers his fragment of druid staff and asks the elf to take that, too; maybe the druid in the grove will have some idea of what will work.

It takes a while for Thorin to find a place to turn his staff into a tree - he realises that it will be a true giant, some 60ft tall! An original plan of a smaller, unused cistern is no good; people have to look wider. While they do that, Thorin remembers his dragon scale shield. We take a look to see if we can figure out how it works. He notices that a central scale is loose; it comes off if pulled and in the place is an eye. When he sees this, he thinks (ARC 25) it's a Sentinel Shield.

Simera has been roped in to try and help find a 60ft tall space below the town. Francesc and Penny aren't able to spot anything, but Thorin - Survival nat 20 + 5 -> 25 - he hears about a collapsed part of town where there's a condemned building. It's on the outskirts, in a kind of now-slum area. The floor collapsed and there were basement levels below and a water cistern. We head there. Not bad; but it's covered in rubble. We'd need to clear a fair amount. Doable.

We need to get people here - PWAT for a large group would be handy! - along with someone with good hearing, to hear which tunnels are being searched so we can avoid patrols. With PWAT, Francesc gets 15+19+10 -> 39 for stealth! Penny is able to help move obstructions where they arise (ATHL 19) and Thorin watches the way with his new shield (perception 15, but he's got equiv. tremorsense to help).

It's been some 3 hours since we awoke. Maybe, 10pm. We have a crowd. Thorin tells people to stand back; he needs to transform his staff.

None of us have seen before. It morphs; elongating and spreading, branches and leaves, a truly huge, gnarled trunk; it's only just appeared, yet it looks immediately ancient. Its roots spread between and over debris, punching down into the earth - surely, to anyone who did not know otherwise, they would think this tree had grown naturally and was perhaps indeed the reason why the inside of the building was so broken.

To the Athas residents it is especially astonishing - they've only ever seen the God King destroy nature. But here it is, created in front of them. A fanaticism of sorts develops; a very strong belief; maybe this really is it - maybe this is the turning point, they think!

Some climb into the tree as Thorin thinks any part of the trunk could work as an entrance point. Penny's not so sure what it'll look like at the other end! The lead elf is ready to go, with message and broken staff. Elderly have their own queues, younger on hand to help; the youngest preferentially climb.

It's time. Thorin casts Transport Via Plants. The whole tree starts to glow! People who had climbed it don't even seem to need to run at it - they kind of fall "into" the branches. Those on the ground surge forward, as best they can. All the non-fighters, in the end; in the minute of the spell, we get more than we expected. Far more. Only the hardcore people who want to distract and confuse the templars remain, in the end... And they'll all be doing it on the *other* side of town.

The glow fades; the spell ends. The instructions now are clear. Get away from here and, for the four of us plus Simera, start the rescue plan.

Simera seems to spend most of her time talking to Francesc. I guess they ended up with a curious rapport of sorts. We think we might "attack" right now, but it's the Athas nighttime equivalent of 'broad daylight'. Maybe not wise.

* The path she knows will take us within the inner city, into the lush part.
* Few places to hide. Buildings widely-spaced, but lots of plants in tended gardens.
* We have to break into the headquarters of the Templars!
* Get to the courtyard and to a separate building in the middle of that compound, which is deliberately recessed deep into the ground; some 50ft down to the 'cage of fire' level.
* We need to survive that fall, and the fire traps within.
* We need to find Zorhanna. Simera doesn't know her exact location.

Penny asks if there is any kind of magic suppression. Simera isn't sure, but nobody's escaped. Perhaps it is just a question of physical protection - gags, bindings, that kind of thing. But *maybe* there's something that suppresses magic. Minos might've helped here but it's a wildcard and besides, we sent him out through the tree - it was far too high a risk that he might get discovered. But Simera thinks the fire traps are magical, though - if so, there's surely no magic suppression.

We consider cloud flight (could be seen; takes ages to re-materialise); but then we consider... Falling. Francesc can run down the side. Penny figures the drop would *hurt* but she might be athletic enough to somewhat lessen it, and it won't kill her for sure. Thorin likewise - and he thinks he could Misty Step down. *If* we can get to the pit, we can get down.

Getting back? Well maybe *that* is a good option for Cloud Flight to get out. Penny considers throwing Thorin - if she could lift him 20ft, he could Misty Step *out*! She grabs him without asking and tries to hoist him into the air... Nat 3 ATHL, so - they fall in a heap on the ground.

And *then* (HIS 23) Thorin remembers we have a Reverse Gravity rod. So we could... Fall upwards. While casting Cloud Flight. Somehow, Simera convinces us to let her come! She insists she can "create a distraction". So long as it's not just - *everything* on fire.

We wind through various tunnels, led by Simera. Penny tries to take notes (left, right, bear left...) on a scrap of paper - she misses Arturo's cartographer skills already!

Eventually we emerge at street level, in an alleyway. Francesc casts PWAT. We have to stick close together. Penny casts See Invisibility. Thorin has his Stone Cunning up. Perception ADV 19. Groups stealth check is very high! With the +10, 33 Penny, 29 Thorin, 36 Francesc, Simera 30-odd. Woah.

We move across open plazas at times; from one tree, to another; great care needed, we cast two shadows under the two moons on this clear night; we reach a sort of fountain/gazebo wishing well that's off to the side of the ostentatious stone tower of The Fortress. Three storeys high, minaret-like tops to towers on all four corners, pennants blowing on the wind, intricate Moroccan-style windows, lights and activity; we time things to account for patrols, pausing briefly to wait for emerging groups of people marching out fast, almost running. From this perspective we occasionally see distant explosions in the city, which is causing their haste! The Alliance is doing good work.

One major patrol goes counter-clockwise along the parapet. Outside, they patrol clockwise. Within, we think there must be at least two dozen from what we see in windows. They're glass-free, just decorated openings. Thorin sends in a moth - amongst so many other moths, circling brazier lights all through the interior. He can see through its eyes up to a 100ft range, and we're easily close enough for him to get a decent look at this side.

The main entrance - gate fully open - has a beautiful fresco on the ceiling of some kind of dragon god. There are guard stations either side and sort of foyer area. Then there's a corridor beyond with one side open, to a central count yard. The "walls" are, then, only one storey thick. There are interior balconies on every floor that overlook the central area. Thorin's moth notices little bushes and small pots with plants in the courtyard, along with four palm trees at corners - up to a point; the last several feet of the central area is exposed, tiled and slippery, with a star-shaped hole in the middle.

Thorin thinks a first-floor room might be best to avoid guards and patrols. There are stairs on what he considers to be the East and West sides of the square. There are quite a few people around. Thorin's relaying things. Penny suggests Simera could create a diversion around that prison area, since that might draw more people away than would be the case elsewhere. But Thorin remembers our guard outfits. If there was a more visible, loud distraction that caused guards to run back towards the building, we could potentially mix in with that crowd and peel off once inside.

So if Simera threw stuff in close to, but not at the prison (don't want to burn people there!) as a loud distraction then we can run in.

The moth then turns to fly out, now facing the front gate wall. There are no balconies on that side! They are on the other three walls only. We saw the prison bars through the far wall balcony, so perhaps we put our distraction into that front wall. Then people are "inside". And we know that anyone who is still on balconies is looking in that direction, so when we get into the courtyard we can plan our cover and route to minimise line-of-sight from people on the back wall who are still inside, but looking across to the front section trying to figure out what the ruckus is.

Perception rolls - Simera highest at 24. She points. A guard moves from a front window overlooking the front approach, in what looks like it might be a common room, who goes across to a wall full of casks of ale. They draw a big pitcher full of booze. "How much of that poison have you got left?" asks Penny to Francesc. "Nah, we used it all". But Simera casks, "Can anyone accurately fire an explosive or flaming arrow at the wall of casks?"

Well then, there's our diversion. We get on the guard uniforms. We wait until the right time for a patrol starting to come back in. They arrive; Thorin and Penny decide to fall in behind, with Francesc holding position to fire the arrow at the last possible moment, then run in after - she's fast and stealthy.

Thorin and Penny have bad stealth rolls but thanks to being within the 30ft range of PWAT still, it's 21, 24. We slip behind the walking group without being noticed; Francesc is a bit shaky and the arrow has a lit ceramic jar attached that throws off the balance, but it still works. The arrow *just* gets through the window, striking the casks and the jar explodes. It's a small explosion at first. People seem confused and halt; but then one of the casks *explodes* - it must have held spirits! *That* gets a lot of attention. People start running in, peeling left to get to a stairwell - but they cut through the courtyard to do it.

Geronimo! Penny tries to keep an eye out for people on the far balcony; as guards head left, she goes straight on. Commotion; perception 14 even with blowing Inspiration - she just goes head-down, straight, and runs right over the edge of the hole.

Close behind, Thorin perception 30, he sees it all - people pointing at certain directions; others saying "someone's bombing the building!" - and so-on. Francesc is coming up quickly from the back; perception 22, she notices a bundle of rags run past and dive into the building. There goes Simera.

Penny didn't have time to plan anything like, y'know, holding onto the edge first to try and drop cleanly; she plummets 50ft, pretty much landing face first. 5d6 -> 22 damage; it might have been less, but Thorin's misty step trick goes a little awry and he lands on top of Penny! 8 damage. We're prone. Francesc simply *runs down* the walls and joins us, enjoying the... View.

Thorin and Francesc see that we've fallen down that star-shaped shaft that opens up about 40ft of the way down into a much larger space, 10ft tall. Down here is a kind of large oval-shaped enclosure with five corridor exits coming off it at what might be points of a 5-pointed star.

But - no fire. Curious. Nothing seems to have happened yet.

Thorin, perception 25. We're in a sort of 10ft moat or well, with the oval area ahead of us having a ceiling - but this ceiling has little nozzles. We're still in the hole area, so we're not below those at this point. Penny's hampered by lack of vision here; she has a short range in the dark, but investigation 18 doesn't see *too* much. Francesc (investigation 25) has the idea to try rolling a piece of debris. It rolls over the mosaics on the floor, then hits a particular piece and suddenly the room lights up. The jets in the ceiling jet fire, in what would be a mesmerising ballet of light and motion but for its potential lethality! There's certainly a pattern to it. But we don't have time to try and fathom that out and besides, Zorhanna would need to do it to get out too; dodging seems like a good option.

Thorin realises it's magical fire, but the trigger is physical.

The mosaic piece that triggered the fire is part of a depiction of (Thorin, HIS 17) - oh, the God King themselves. He tries rolling one or two more, with there being limited availability of stuff to throw or roll over, trying to see if there's any kind of pattern. Penny meanwhile is checking the floor to see if there's anything there which might turn off the fire as another way of doing it. Francesc decides to help, casting Guidance - but this drops PWAT and *now* that seems to trigger all sorts of things off. Fire everywhere. Walls included.

At least with Guidance *and* Help, Penny gets investigation 22. There's a missing mosaic piece, underneath where we landed. Francesc thinks a mosaic piece is probably needed to fit into that space. But we don't have that. Instead, Thorin simply tries Mould Earth to try and use some other material of the area and create such a piece. This works to a degree. The walls are still on fire, but bars of fire that were in front of the doors go out. That's progress!

Now Thorin remembers Mage Hand! He tries touching debris to specific tiles but this time, they don't activate the ceiling jets. Penny shrugs and walks towards one of the corridor exits. The walls of the corridor down there are fire too and the heat from that is pretty nasty. She can't get too close and retreats. Thorin sends his Familiar in, thinking the little moth will be OK going down the middle - but it's destroyed. It got about 30ft down before then, and did manage to see that the corridor was within sight, so that corridor was maybe around 100ft long.

Penny (ARC 18) notices that every time a spell is cast, the walls of fire seem to light up again. If we just wait a short while, they might go out. So it might not have been the lack of PWAT and more the casting of Guidance that caused them to light.

Thorin suggests simple solutions. He has a shield that protects from fire and has resistance too. He wonders if he can just *see* down the corridor with his 120ft darkvision / general long sight. DISADV perception; 25 - two lucky rolls! He can see a person *hanging* by a chain from the ceiling by their wrists. They're gagged and blindfolded. Can't tell if they were an elf of not. Tattered rags, skinny. They look singed, like they've burned. Now that he's not half-blinded by all the foreground fire, he realises that their room walls were on fire inside too.

And then the fire goes out. It's been about a minute. Ah!

We check. One person at the end of each hallway, but only four occupied. All about the same height. Three have long hair, one has short.

Francesc wants to rescue them all. Thorin too. Penny is worried that they'll shout out or otherwise give the game away. We pick where to start at random and we know we must not cast any magic while we do this. Penny is back to only 10ft vision range. We quickly notice other traps along the corridors; but we're not sure what sets them off. Other mechanisms, for sure; has that single tile turned everything off?! Maybe not walking in a big group would help... Thorin pulls back, but passes the fire shield to Francesc.

Penny perception ADV just scrapes 13; there appears to be a pressure plate of sorts on the floor. It's wide. The lack of mosaic gave it away. 5ft radius room, 6 curious wedges on the floor, the one at the entrance way looks like it moves. The middle where the person's feet rest is a circle. Francesc can climb around using the wall. And the walls are weird! That's not mechanical; they're covered in arcane glyphs. It seems they *transform* into walls of fire.

The person in the middle knows that someone is in the room. Penny and Francesc whisper that, unbelievable as it might be, we're here to help; don't panic; we won't hurt them.

The pressure plate wedge thing can be stepped around carefully. Knowing it's there is enough. Penny suggests Francesc should look at the circle in the middle of the room; is it a pressure plate too that needs the pressure on it? Francesc investigates; she's telling the person to *not* cast magic; the person is making muffled noises as if to speak, so she tries to take off the gag but it's put in magically! Penny (having stepped in carefully) - ARC lucky roll 21, the whole thing covering up the person is magical. And they're held up magically too. It's not actually chains; manacles levitate. They keep the arms in the exact same place.

We can't dispel it - casting spells is a big "no"! So... What now?

(End of act 2, part 23)
