# RIPA: Act 2 Part 30
## Session 76 (2025-10-28)
### Campaign day 31 on Krynn, still inside one of the Three Moons Vault towers

We are in an underground nexus between the three towers, trying to decide which one to visit next. We have with us Vahn, a rescued druid who is the only one who remains from his Circle and Urian, a celestial in the form of a Hollyphant, but previously known to Vahn's druidic circle in a unicorn form.

We know the stairs off the "crescent moon" section leads to the experimentation area where unfortunate souls have magic 'extracted' somehow. The red tower has, we think, Teremini and probably other red wizards. The extracted essence is being taken to the black tower - that's probably where the ritual is happening. We don't know which entrance is which there.

There's some debate about where to go. Splitting of the party is considered. But the end, a few things - not least of which, the horrifying explosion on Eberron - lead us towards checking the white tower, since that might hold captives. Vahn and Urien will come along.

Thorin reminds us about the undead army we saw heading here; for many reasons, we need to try and make haste. He goes first at the strange, magically-formed stairs, examining them as he goes and using Tremorsense. Perception 28 (!). Somewhere above him, bearing North-East, there is a group of maybe three people dragging things around. Dragging a chair, tapping a foot; idle behaviour. Two more slowly walking in a curve at the same rate as each other. Further away and up, and a wider radius, walks another person alone. They walk a short distance, open some door and continue.

He surmises a patrol, some people waiting around that are probably guards off duty or maybe wizards and the last person is everyone's guess.

We go up a level. It's precarious - the floor has partly collapsed (or was it perhaps moulded into the stairs?) leaving only rough ledges on either side. We investigate a bit and find two doors; one small, one larger that the spectral dragon could probably use and it *seems* like they both go to the same room. Penny jumps over (ATHL 18) to get a better look at the door by which the dragon is hovering. At the small door, Francesc can't see any traps; it's not locked; Flurth and Urth enter and it's just a small central area. There are two more locked doors - four in total, one on each wall - the southmost locked. Checking the unlocked room, there are stairs going up. No windows.

Penny hops over through the bigger door; Francesc and her examine that South door, which Francesc then tries to unlock. SOH 23. It opens with a click. Urth and Flurth, still disguised as red wizards, go through first. There's another strange statue here, sort of quicksilver-like, similar to one above the dais down below. As they enter, closely followed by Thorin, two moonlight guardians appear. They both point at Thorin and start 'beaming' out a word that Urth and Flurth know to be: "INTRUDER". It's some kind of arcane signal rather than verbal; Urth can't figure out what they're doing.

Initiative:

* Penny 25
* Thorin, dragon 24
* Francesc 21
* Urth, Flurth 10

Penny sees them materialise, lights the sun sword, runs in past the others and tries attacking one. Nat 20 - no smites - 24 damage, all radiant; she saw an arm that seemed to be fully made of just a massive sword and tries to chop it off... But it did nothing. Swept straight through. She can't think of _any_ other kind of non-radiant damage to bring to bear, so she tries sticking it with a javelin as a melee weapon! The hit would do 6 damage, but seems to do less (halved, resistance).

"Told you the white tower was a mistake" says Urth.

`-_-`, replies Penny.

Urth then also notices that the "INTRUDER" emanation is now directed at both Penny and Thorin. He mentions it; perhaps they only do this if people they don't recognise are in the room?

Thorin grabs Penny (who says, "?!") and moonlight-steps through the red glow but the only place out-of-room he can see to land is quite precarious (Penny DEX save 15, manages to not fall!); his draconic spirit is now nearby and he asks it to move back to the stairwell that we came up, to keep watch.

Francesc perception 17, couldn't *hear* them 'say' "INTRUDER" before but their posture has changed; their arms/weapons are lowered. She doesn't attack.

The two guardians to turn Flurth, then Urth, then back to Flurth then finally settle looking on Urth. They stand, silent and motionless. Urth HIS 21; he remembers that these are made of silver and mithril, bound by magic to animate them,; they were first created by white-robed mages who were playing around with a deck-of-cards artefact that they had found. The story goes that they were under attack by shape-shifting creatures (very rare on this world, so probably from off-world) and wished for a retinue of bodyguards. That created the first Moonlight Guardians. Now, whenever the moon is right and **someone is asking for help and protection** in the light of the moon, these guardians appear.

They're guarding... Something. They shouldn't normally attack, but they _will_ defend.

Urth clears his throat. "My apologies for the buffoons travelling with me! I've come to fetch the artefact."

They look to each other and step aside, giving a better look at a pedestal hidden behind them. They extend their blade-like arms into the pool which starts to shift and pull, changing shape. Meanwhile, Thorin is explaining why he moved Penny and Francesc moves back to keep better hidden.

Light in the room starts to waver, almost light pink; uncoiling around the pedestal as the quicksilver gets drawn back is a very thin-looking winged serpent perhaps an inch in diameter. It looks at Urth and Flurth, clearly sees Urth straight away as the "real" creature here and starts to speak. Urth ARC 21. He's read about these! They're usually huge - this is a naga, but a very small one, 3ft long at most (rather than the usual 20ft or so).

It starts speaking initially in a resonant melodic language he does not understand; he does not respond and it switches to Istarian. It's asking why he's come after so long, in disguise as a Red, to worship at the shrine of the White.]

He and Flurth speak in almost alternate words, each making up part of the overall sentence: "I grew up in this land, but I've travelled far and wide. I've made a couple of enemies along the way, so it's important that I blend in upon my return. Times are changing. The gods are back! It's time to harness great power."

ADV persuasion: 20. The guardian naga pulls back. It's expression can be best described as - 'thinking'. It draws the two guardians into the quicksilver making up the pedestal and then that lowers away, revealing an alabaster statue of an elven woman - **Luminari, the Goddess of the White**. There's a note of urgency in the naga's voice when it says, "You are not with the other Red. Hmm. Do you oppose Knight's Edge?" (That would be Teremini). Urth says, "I think so, but it's hard to be certain!" - the naga's 'thinking' expression deeper. "Are those your enemies or allies who intruded into this shrine?" "They're my allies and they were only lashing out in self defence. They mean no harm" - and he waves us in as the naga says, "Call your allies, so I may know them."

The naga asks if we will "submit" to a "revealing light"; Francesc opines that it sounds "culty"! Penny just says, "Yep!" - and feels something that might need a WIS save but willingly fails. Next, Urth; he also allows it through. Penny felt nothing, but he feels a strange 'tug' - like it's looking into his soul. Like it wants to know any secrets that would threaten the Goddess (any loyalty to the Red); he has none. Thorin after that. The moonlight to him feels... Saccharine! Sickly sweet; Disney princess. But it just slides straight off him (!) and comes to Francesc. Francesc's old distrust of god-wannabes rears its head and she tries to fight the effect. WIS save - 7! It quickly withdraws then quickly moves to Urian. Francesc is left confused - violated almost - since it *forced* its way into her head.

The naga is speaking to Urth. "I sense there is no love lost, but animosity between you and the Red; a sense of betrayal."

"I would say that animosity is a strong word. Resent, perhaps? Scepticism? But all that was a long time ago. I've aged many years and done many things since."

"Then why are you here? You surely know this is a dangerous place to be."

"I came here not of my own volition..."

"...you're a captive?!"

"...no, it just wasn't my _first_ choice. I'm here supporting my friends."

"Your friends seek an object."

"Yes."

"Do you care for this object?"

"Personally? No!"

"Why do I sense that you have something against Teremini? They want the object. But you want something else."

"I'm sceptical of any concentrated power. What I surmise the Reds are doing with magic is something that makes me pretty uncomfortable."

"Do you seek to restore the balance?"

"Yes."

Urth insight 15. The guardian is playing a word game of sorts. Ask questions to try and get him to say a specific sequence of words to which it is bound to respond. It cannot respond the way it wants, freely, without that. The insight isn't clear. He's on the right lines. But he needs the guardian to tell him _how_ to achieve his goal.

Urth starts again. The questions are similar. The rest of us don't know the language, but recognise repetition. This time though Urth says, "I want to restore the balance, but I need your help to do that" - and the statue completely changes shape and the naga grows, filling the room, now at full size. It explains in a language we *all* understand:

* You need the mirror - one has appeared by the altar - it can disrupt Teremini's ritual
* There are lots of different colours of moonlight; they must be reflected in the right way for her to lock in a specific combination of Lunarian crystals installed in her tower; this mirror is like those that are reflecting moonlight from each tower into those crystals
* If done successfully, the effect around here would become permanent and expanded and she'd gain extra power from the magic of the Three Moons.

We need to figure out where to place this mirror to cause most disruption; we need to get to the top of each tower; a passphrase lets us get to the top of *this* one, "**Buried Is Best**". And we **absolutely must not let Lord Soth take control of the magic of the Three Moons**.

Urth notices that in the mirror, Flurth's reflection looks like a big pile of snow! Penny sees it too, by passive perception. A mirror of 'truth' somehow? In any case - it's time to keep climbing.

It's too small to really bring the dragon up, so Thorin thanks it and dismisses it.

We start to head up. Urth first. There's a forcefield at the entrance! Francesc says - "try the passphrase" - and he does. We all find that we must say it in order to pass. Thorin senses that there are the two walking probably-guards on this floor along with the three others. The latter are just next door, so Urth peeks inside.

The room to the West is exposed by the shattered wall of the tower! Down below, on rubble, are various tents. LOTS of tents! Many guards - some looking like veterans - are hanging out down there. Not good. To the East, a grand door and, right next to him, a ladder and a small opening that probably once had a hatch. But it's in full view of the tent cluster below. If we were quiet enough and lucky it might work. No sign of guards; they're over to the East, thinks Thorin, so they're not in this tower at all.

Thorin casts PWAT. Francesc uses the opportunity to check a northern sector - an empty storeroom. That seems to be all, here; we go up. Much of the floor area here is long gone. The ladder looks like a late addition - a means of access, after whatever destroyed so much of the structure. It's crowded here; we move across to another spiral stone staircase and reach what seems to be a place for rituals. Here, stairs leading up to one more floor curve along the inside of the outer wall, leaving the whole of the floor area in the middle open.

Up the stairs we finally get to the top floor (which is open, so basically is like a roof) and have a clear view to the other towers from here. It seems like there's a strange floor, a great flagstone area that spans between the towers as if we were at ground level, not visible from below, but visible now. We're some 70ft up! A forcefield blocks the way, but the password gets us through. We don't advance to far out just yet. We can see the mirror and various crystals.

Penny insight 24, notices that - as described - the mirrors shine light at each other and into the middle. Urth wants to try and move one, but they don't seem to budge. More effort is put in by Urth and Francesc - nope, they won't move (even on a nat 20).

We discuss using the mirror we were given to interrupt the reflections but it would be easy to remove and we'd have achieved nothing. Thorin tries walking out - the "ground" seems almost transparent, and he certainly senses the height he's at here, but he presses on. There's a sort of alter by an (empty) brazier which would hold a *huge* amount of _something_ (it's a great bowl, some 6ft in diameter) and lots of scrolls and parchments piled up here. Without touching, he tries to understand any writing he can see but it's all in a script he does not recognise.

Urth comes to check. He *can* read some of it. INV 24:

* There are diagrams showing exactly how the mirrors must be angled, with accompanying calculations
* The precise mixtures of light need to cancel each other out in the middle and must shine light into a crystal in the middle of each tower to get the correct colour of light; that has not yet happened
* The 'stasis' effect is needed to infuse a bowl full of pure Weave so that it can then be used to power the ritual to "**find the path**"
* **The rod possesses the ability to create a path, show the shortest way between two things; the top of this tower, the Three Moons Vault, is to become a beacon that **allows the Master to find the shortest, most direct way to get from his sanctum to this world**
* What's more, this bowl becomes a device, which (carefully!) can be moved and create a conduit between two places *anywhere*.

Urth tells Thorin who makes the reasonable link: "The master" is Vecna; he wants to move quickly between worlds, speed up his invasion or be able to move around his 'realm' more easily; **he also then definitely has an interest in the Rod and we now know he is interfering here**.

Meanwhile, Penny is over at the edge of the white tower with Francesc. She asks to get the mirror, so
it's fetched out of the bag of holding and she looks at the scene in front of her - in the reflection. She sees impassable walls protecting the other towers - forcefields, but represented more differently. She can see the mirrors configured on the other walls, not yet activated to shine into the middle. Their configuration is similar to that on the white tower. It looks like that part has been finished.

And then she sees them! Two wraiths, either side of the altar-like construct. One's virtually on top of Urth. She shouts out, "Ah, _shit_ - two wraiths! Watch out, Urth, Thorin!" - and starts running at full tilt towards the middle. Francesc has seen it too. But as Penny starts to run, she can't see them; she says, "They're only visible in the mirror!" - she heads towards Urth, who has the wraith right above him. Full dash gets her alongside, lighting the sunsword along the way.

Francesc tries to use the mirror, aiming her bow for the one next to Urth. The arrow whistles past Penny and Urth's heads, and (Disadv roll) hits (32!) - Hunter's Mark is on too. A second arrow finds its mark too. The piercing damage is resisted somewhat, but it's still hurt - and now it becomes fully visible. Some of the damage is transferred to the other, but that one does *not* appear.

A shocked Urth, seeing the wraith appears, casts L3 Dissonant Whispers. DC19 WIS save - but it succeeds. He at least gets some effect and it is hampered somewhat in attacks to others. Flurth tries the same thing, and *this* time is successful; 10 psychic damage and it must try to flee. An opportunity attack is available which Urth takes, dealing more damage too. Penny follows suit - crit! 4d8+5 -> 24 damage. It's fleeing, but by the time it has got any distance at all, it's already dissipated to nothing.

Penny's still pointing at the *other* one which nobody can see (her neither, it's just out of range, she's simply guessing it hasn't moved yet) - Francesc checks the mirror; it has indeed not moved - so Thorin tries Faerie Fire in that general area. It fails its save and is illuminated, but the wraith in turn flies straight at Thorin and attacks... But misses.

Francesc fires and hits the second wraith, doing a total of 15 damage accounting for resistances. A second hit deals 7 more. Penny swings and hits twice - 14 and 17 damage, no extra smites. Urth tries Vicious Mockery! It fails and that's enough - it's destroyed.

Since we've already caused a ruckus, Francesc decides to try disrupting light to the middle prism, and when one of the beams is interrupted, the prism shifts a bit. It's as if it is being held in place by the beams. Thorin determines that the force fields are still up; but the prism can simply be lifted out! Urth takes it. Wandering over to Thorin, Penny tries Dispel Magic - seems too simple, but ARC check +5 is a solid 24. It works! Francesc hurries over to the accessible tower and disrupts the mirror, stealing another crystal. But (perception 24) she also hears the sound of crumbling stone and sees something grabbing the edge of the platform to the South-West; a purple mist; something big. What's more, there are the sounds of feet from the South-East tower.

The creature crawls onto the top. It's a death dragon. A *huge* death dragon. And atop it, a black-robed creature - we have to assume Lord Soth; "TEREMINI!" he calls as a flustered elf appears up the stairs, mumbling something and running through the forcefield on the third tower.

**Francesc recognises the creature from the vision in the scrying pool in the basement.**

Urth and Flurth promptly change their appearance to make themselves look as generic and unrecognisable as possible! He also makes them each look different from one another.

We all talk over each other on courses of action but eyes from across the platform are turning our way, while Francesc starts to take the shot; she can't reach Lord South but puts Hunter's Mark on Teremini:

* Immune to psychic
* Cannot be charmed

...and fires; 17 just hits; but Teremini lifts a magical Shield and deflects. The next arrow is more precise and makes it through - 17 damage.

Initiative:

* Urth/Flurth 26
* Penny 22
* Thorin 11
* Francesc 11

(Francesc and Urth are presently focused on Teremini while Thorin and Penny are focused on Soth.)

"Why is the ritual not ready?!" calls Soth. Teremini shouts, "They've taken - the alarm went - they've taken things! We must stop them! Wraiths, where are you?"

Urth looks around and gives L3 Aid (max HP +10) on Francesc, himself and Penny. He starts running around the northern platform edge, looking like he's heading for the white tower. Flurth follows close behind, throwing a fireball from his necklace. Teremini makes the save (but has magic resistance anyway) - 25 -> 12 fire damage. Urth throws Bardic to Francesc, while Flurth throws it to Thorin.

Penny runs out towards Teremini, ending up next to the big bowl brazier, since people seem to be focusing on Teremini and it might act as a distraction. But now the giant death dragon pushes off the tower, flies directly over Penny and lands amongst the other party members near the North-East tower. Soth holds out a black rose (!) as one might hold a sword; he moves his arm, scanning people; it stops on Francesc. "This waif has the crystals!" he says, despite them being in the bag of holding!

The dragon unleashes its deadly breath weapon. Saves - Francesc 25 with Bardic, Thorin 21 with Bardic. They manage to dodge the worst, but it's still **65 damage** - necrotic - halved to 32. The dragon moves in to bite Thorin; damage is 12 piercing and 1 necrotic more - and he's grappled in its mouth. Lord Soth continues to focus on Francesc and Commands her, "STOP". WIS save - 15, with Luck point; not enough. She stops, frozen in her tracks. "Remove the prisms and return them to me, and I will grant you a rapid death" he says.

Penny, perception 19 - **Teremini is holding a rod piece**. "She's got the rod! She's got the f*cking rod!"

Francesc HIS 17, remembers that the dragon is immune to necrotic and poison damage, and resistant to piercing. It can see things that are invisible too. She keeps firing at Teremini, since she really can't potion do anything about the dragon or Soth! Teremini gets hit for 18 on the first arrow, but blows another shield to avoid being hit by the second.

Torn between trying to help Francesc or get the rod, Thorin eventually chooses to Moonlight Step through the red light to appear next to Teremini then tries Earthbind on the dragon - but it makes its save. Teremini meanwhile is astonished and angered by Thorin's sudden appearance next to her; she casts Lightning Bolt, point black in his face. DEX save - 20+3->23 - 41->20 damage. Then she tries to run. He doesn't try to grapple; instead, uses Primal Savagery; hits, 22 acid damage. But it doesn't really seem to hurt her all that much overall. Teremini keeps running, getting close to Penny.

Now the Death Dragon (legendarily) actions, flying out and close to the altar. Lord Soth looks back behind himself to Francesc and casts Command again. WIS save once more; 17, not enough; he calls, "APPROACH". She reacts by moving straight towards him.

Urth acts. He keeps heading for the stairs, then casts Stinking Cloud on Lord Soth and the death dragon, hoping to disable them momentarily; but then he remembers that they're undead and can't be poisoned; so there's a change of tactic - Bigby's Hand, L5 - and puts it in front of Teremini, trying to grab her. It works! She's grappled. Then he tries to crush her - 4d6+5 bludgeoning -> 20.

Flurth acts next. He runs to Francesc and casts Mass Cure Wounds - it's all he has! - 23 healing, mostly for Francesc but also to Penny, who was only a bit scratched up, gets healed fully by it too. Another Bardic is thrown at Francesc too.

Penny ADV tries to grab the rod off Teremini. ATHL 27. Penny shouts as loud as she can, "EVERYONE TO FRANCESC *RIGHT NOW* AND DON'T ARGUE" and runs! She ends up about 10ft from Francesc, turns her back to Soth and the Dragon and tries to use her shield and her armour to create a bit of a safe space in front.

Without realising it, she keeps just out of range of something the Death Dragon could've done. But Lord Soth is another matter - and he's able to force the Death Dragon to move. It's right on top of Penny, buffeting its wings to try and knock her over. STR save 26 - she's not knocked over, perhaps because by turning her back she inadvertently made herself more aerodynamic. The dragon hasn't recovered its breath weapon, so tries to bite; she manages to *just* dodge that by catching a glint of it via the seeing shield. 7 damage from one claw, but then she's ready for it and deflects the next.

Lord Soth is not impressed. Penny's looking over her shoulder. He's looking at her and holding that black rose - and crushes it, breathes in the ash that creates then breathes out a word of some kind. We don't recognise it. Urth realises with horror that it's Ancient Istarian for "DEATH" - a power word. Penny CON save lucky roll - 22; 100->50 necrotic damage.

Francesc gets the helm ready!

The Death Dragon acts once more. It tries to claw at Penny. Miss! Deflects right off the back of the Adamantium breastplate. Lord Soth meanwhile can see a lot of things going on; **he casts Dispel Magic... At Flurth. NAT 20.** But Flurth sees it coming! Counterspell; DC 18; but Soth beats that. It's not enough. To our great distress, Flurth turns into the snowman that was briefly shown in the mirror just a few minutes earlier and, in a matter of seconds, melts into a puddle of water.

Thorin moonlight-steps in front of Francesc.

Teremini misty-steps out of the grasp of Bigby's Hand and appears right in front of Penny. Penny's eyes widen in surprise but as she tries to grab the rod, Penny just bats her hand away.

Urth dashes full range to get close to Francesc - he moves Bigby's Hand against Teremini again and once more grapples her. Penny swings - a hit for 19, then another crit! L4 Divine Smite with crit - total 14d8->65 damage. That's enough. "Send my love to Vecna" she says, swinging and bringing down the smite; in a blaze of radiant damage, nothing much is left.

She steps over to Francesc and hands over the stone she picked from the camp where we'd first met Urth; Francesc triggers the helm, but at that moment, Francesc notices (perception 20+10 bardic) the red effect over the tower starting to fail. It seems like Teremini was the person keeping that up...

...and in an instant, the helm teleports us to the top of the hill.

(End of act 2, part 30)
