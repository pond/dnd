# RIPA: Act 2 Part 27
## Session 73 (2025-09-30)
### The Outlands, at Tasha's cottage (campaign day 30)

At long last we have returned from Athas, with the fourth rod segment, a rescued Zorhanna and the unexpected addition of Mynos. We're in Tasha's cottage (and Penny has made, uuuh, a mess on the floor).

Zorhanna immediately regains her composure and says, "We need to talk to someone immediately. Something very important has happened. And - and can you *please* stop vomiting?!"

(Penny does her best).

We don't recognise this cottage though Zorhanna seems to. Outlands light filters in through the windows and there's an impression of early morning from the colour of the sky. Tasha says - "I'll get Alustriel right away!" - then puts her hands on Zorhanna's shoulders; "Welcome back to the land of the living".

Penny starts cleaning up the floor in the cottage... Thorin notices that Mynos is wandering out with Zorhanna, dazed. He rushes to stop him - too much too soon! - "One step at a time" - but he's already seen Sigil; he's pointing Spireward in awe.

Tasha has been apparently having something of an argument over Sending spells! "Things are complicated - do you have any idea what's happened while you were aw - no, of course you can't know - well - so, Zorhanna you have to stay with me. The bald child? Is that - are you guys looking after him?" (We nod, albeit confused). "Alusriel's not coming here. There's something 'very urgent' that you have to do. Can you meet her anywhere?" - we figure the Helm can take us to the Keep now we're in the Outlands.

Zorhanna looks a bit lost. "I thought we'd have a bit more time - but - I'll thank you properly when we figure out what's going on! I mean, I've been told to stay here."

The Helm is activated; we arrive on the teleportation circle. Things have moved around here - and the Keep is on the move, walking, with a gentle sway. "Let's find Mayastan" says Fran - and then yells out, "MAYASTAAAAN!" - well that's one way to find him! There's the sound of two pairs of feet running and two heads pop up the stairs; Mayastan and "Alfred". Penny sees they've *run* up; Alfred seems pleased to see us and says, "Welcome back!" - Fran asks "How long have we been gone?!" and Mayastan says, "two or three weeks". But Mayastan, Thorin and Fran notices, have the look of someone has just been caught out with something!

Penny and Thorin both ask in tandem - "Why are we moving?"

"A lot has changed since you were last here. We're kind of on the clock. Did you get the next piece of the rod?" "Yep!" "And? Do you know where the next one is?" but before we can answer that we haven't had time for that yet, Alustriel teleports in.

While Alustriel talks, we start unloading some of our Athas gear to lighten the packs. Mayastan will make sure Penny's borrowed armour gets back to its owner via Trade Gate.

Alustriel thanks us for rescuing Zorhanna, but is rather breathless and hurried. "We're on the clock" she (also) says - "We have to get ahead of things... Sigil has reopened. So you understand the urgency of this."

"So isn't that a good thing?"

"Well yes on the one hand, but..." - Thorin says, "- it was closed off for a reason" - "...yes but of course it's now vulnerable to His Spell of Remaking". Alustriel doesn't know why.

Penny, who's now taken off the top plate and retrieved the bag of holding, tries to trick Fran into taking the rod out of the bag, but she refuses - "For the gods' sake..." says Alustriel, reaches in and grabs it. Her eyes turn white for a moment. Then, "It's as bad as we thought. I don't suppose any of you have a way of getting to Krynn?"

After some discussion, Thorin says that he can Planeshift; the plane isn't connected; Alustriel gives Thorin a special tuning fork that he can use to get back here with Planeshift and she'll send us to where she thinks the fifth piece is. If we hold the fourth, it'll guide us.

**Thorin holds the rod... He sees a charred landscape and a sky full of smoke. Red and black dragons fly above. Pockmarked, hilly terrain with craters. There's a massive tree, parts rotted and fallen away; then the perspective changes; and into a hole in the trunk and then, below, a hole in the ground.**

Alustriel, out of patience, starts to cast. Shocked, Penny shouts, "Alfred! Look after Mynos!" - and she sees Mayastan holding back the child, wild-eyed, trying to run to us...



### Krynn

...and we're in a cloud of thick smoke. We can barely see. Above us, is the top of the crumbling, rotted tree. Big pieces of broken-off trunk, like shattered walls, stand to our left and right; we're not sure if we're stood outside or even inside the tree (or whatever is left of it). A series of giant roots form a series of sort of steps ahead of us, lifting up like terraces. Ahead is another chunk of tree bark with a giant gash in the middle and, again, there's another raised up section inside there.

Thorin recognises the tree from the rod vision. He tries Speak With Plants, to see if it lives.

Fran says to Thorin, "Can you wave the rod around and see where the hole is?"; Penny is temporarily incapacitated. And Thorin's busy with the tree anyway. "Hello, great tree" he says. "What happened here, to leave you in this state?"

Thorin gets a vision. A rod piece in a grotto - ahead of us, not too far. Then a huge gout of flame fills the area. There's an army marching in; they use explosives, blowing up parts of the tree. Treants mount a defence, looking small compared to the size of the truly giant tree. A dryad leads them, with other dryads aiding amongst the treants. They are, though, defeated. A long-red-robed, ritualistically scarred elf marches forward at the head of an undead army. She holds one dryad and crumbles them into dust, screaming, "give it to me or you all die!" - but they refuse and they are, in turn, killed. Rising out of a mass of writhing limbs of the dead is a rod piece.

Then the vision shifts.

A small figure, perhaps a child, with pointy ears and long hair, darting between bits of smouldering wood. They end up in the grotto, looking upwards; undead-looking vines crawl over the landscape and pulls them down.

"Thank you for sharing" - he tries Plant Growth, but it has no effect. A deep rot has set in. The rod piece was, he thinks, what was keeping it alive - it could never have got this big otherwise. Coming out of his reverie, he explains what he's seen to the other two.

It's strange; our rod segment indicated the direction of the hole, so we head that way too. But as we move, vines "notice" us and start to snake out in our direction *and* the start to emerge from the hole too. Thorin recognises them and warns us.

Penny tries Word Of Radiance. The damage isn't great (3d6 only 6); they're pushed back but not destroyed. "You two investigate the hole while I hold them back" and she draws the Sunsword. It sputters with flame first, but then restores to its "normal" non-Athas form. She slices at the vines and they draw back. Penny tries Moonbeam down the hole; it creates a tunnel, some 60ft deep and 10ft wide. The vines aren't killed by they are held back.

Thinking about our tactics on Athas, Penny jumps right in! She takes 5 (resistance) damage of the moonbeam's 10 and 6 damage from the fall but lands on her feet and manages to hold her spell.

She looks up and stars straight into the eyes of a small creature, 150cm tall, slight, holding a lute! He has a magnificent rainbow beard, each of seven strands a different colour. He's sitting down whimpering, sad, but that stops as he looks up, surprised, and gasping for air - "Oh, thank you so much! You came to save me!" "Um - oh - um - yes - how come you are here?!" "I was trying to save my brother! It's about an hour's run, not too far, but he's trapped, in with all sorts of evil fellas - he asked me to come find help - he's really powerful... If you can help me - I would so indebted!"

"I'm Penny."

"I'm Flurth! Nice to meet you."

"You don't have any fly spells do you?!"

"No, but I could use fire. We could climb out while I do that?"

Penny thinks a couple of ropes knotted together would work; she starts orbiting the Moonbeam to give room for it to be dropped - at which Thorin, in a burst of moonlight step and a 30ft fall, lands like a Dwarven-shaped sack of spuds.

Up top, Francesc thinks she should stay there - but the vines start coming for her; "Do I stay up here or what?!" she shouts. Penny asks Flurth if he saw a way out of here - he can't remember from when he (literally) fell in, but INV 23; he sees a space that looks rather like an altar but nothing much else. "What's this?!" he asks; Thorin's being pulled that way by the rod himself, and Thorin calls up to Francesc, "Get down here!"

Flurth is asking about his brother; Francesc agrees that we'll help find him. Investigating, Thorin realises that it's just *residual* magic in the altar. The rod is definitely not here.

"What is it you're looking for?!" asks a confused Flurth.

Penny (while swiping wildly at vines, an ongoing task) explains that we're looking for a rod. Well, rather like the piece Thorin is actually holding. Thorin starts to describe his vision - "...taken by an elf with markings on her face, looked very ritualistic, bright red robe!"

"Bright red robe?! I - I think... My brother will be able to help us with this! My recommendation is that we get out of this hole." (Fully sincere).

Thorin insight 25 - he believes every word of it; it's no lie. Then Flurth starts to explain that in this world there are mages with black, red or white robes. His brother was once affiliated with the "red robed folk" - isn't now, but Flurth is *sure* that his experience would give him insight into helping locate the object.

ARC 23; Thorin tries to pinpoint the magic, but it's not the part of the altar where the rod would seem to have originally fitted. He tries harder; the rod he's holding tries to 'search' but seems unable to actually locate the fifth segment. He suggests that we're too close to the alcove and the residual magic is causing too much interference.

Flurth is wearing a necklace of beads, grabs one and throws it upwards. With a loud "boom", a fireball bursts above! As it does, he starts climbing the wall hurriedly. Francesc (literally) runs after him. Penny sighs. She's *not* light. Thorin goes third and Penny follows but (ATHL 26) she makes it surprisingly easily. Above are many charred vines and a slightly larger hole!

There's a loud shriek. "DIE! Those who attack the Peylon tree must die!" DEX saves all round! Shards of ice come crashing down; 24->12 damage (we all make the save, surprisingly).

It's a burned-looking Dryad, like the tree. But we don't want to harm the tree! Francesc holds up her hands; "We're not hurting the tree! It's a case of mistaken identity!" - Penny joins in, with a bit of Guidance helping from Flurth. 19 total Persuasion. A second attack doesn't hit, but the Dryad is struggling with its emotions. "We tried to heal the tree, not burn it!" says Penny. The Dryad focuses on the three of us for a minute but then turns their attention to Flurth. "No harm!" he says; "If you leave *immediately* I will hurt you no further!" commands the Dryad.

We scarper.

"So, where do we go?" asks Penny.

"Follow me!" says an elated Flurth. "We're looking for the Bittergrass Fences. Swamp, reedy..." - Penny does her best to help, bringing forth her celestial steed and trying to use it to fly up and ahead to give her line of sight. Flurth ADV SUR only 13, so with Penny's help we get to the wrong place faster than we would've otherwise!

We keep trying. Flurth luck die 16; he sees the top of the stones. "Well, we need to be careful here, there are some dangerous creatures around..." - Penny insight 19. He's not _lying_ per se. Francesc pushes the point, and he confesses it's a dragon. A death dragon. We're not exactly impressed but Francesc says, "Well didn't we just kill something like that on Athas?!" - well perhaps we did, so maybe it's not so bad?

Flurth seems to be trying to make himself smaller and hide, stealth - walking silently - and so we bring up Pass Without A Trace. Our lowest roll is Thorin (18), still getting used to be quiet in his scale armour; Penny at 21 is a little more successful but it's still risky.

A shudder goes down Flurth spine has he looks at the place from which he last fled. He thinks he knows where his brother is, but has no idea where the dragon is hiding.

"So... Where do we go?" asks Penny, accidentally repeating herself.

"Into a temple, very nearby. We could try to kinda slink along the top and drop in. Maybe riskier, for dragon cover? The other is to wade through a marshy area. That's what I did before... I think we should do that."

Thorin votes the same. Francesc and Penny agree in turn.

What appeared at a distance to be standing stones are, when we got close, actually floating about 10ft above the ground, some 25ft tall each, the mist almost shrouding their base. Penny sends her Greater Steed up and to the West, the opposite direction - the option that Flurth had indicted - but it doesn't see much; it's above the mist (perception 17).

Penny herself, ADV perception nat 20 -> 22; she heres a rustling to the left and sees a shadowy shape break the surface and then settle below again, over to our left (East) in a much wetter area. She warns the others in a whisper; Flurth presses on, hurrying between the hovering stones; Penny and Francesc hold back, watching the water.

Suddenly, Francesc sees a wave of purple flame appear around her! DEX save (*just* within range of Penny) - 21. 45 (!) necrotic -> 22. Penny sees the flame emanating from the now-emerging dragon and yells a warning!

Initiative:

* Francesc (and steed) 22
* Penny 19
* Thorin 8
* Flurth 4

Francesc sets up Hunter's Mark, learning that the dragon is resistant to piercing, immune to necrotic and poison, being poisoned, or being exhausted. Hmm, well... Shoot it in the face. She hits twice, but in a burst of incredible speed, almost looking like a blur due to the strange purple mist and flame.

Penny sees it approach and tries Abjure Foes. She sees that it fails, but then *chooses* to succeed. So she sends in the steed, which rushes in behind the fast-moving dragon. The steed gets an opportunity attack for 9 damage, but the dragon has its breath weapon back and gets everyone except Flurth. DEX saves are made all round, but we still take 47->23 damage (Penny uses Sooth Pain but only takes 7 off that amount). The dragon flies past; Penny swings, but misses, on her opportunity attack.

Thorin tries a sunbeam. The damage roll is poor, only 18 but this in turn tricks the dragon! It does *not* legendarily save, but that means it gets blinded by the flash. Thorin Moonlight Steps behind it. The dragon spins around and swipes at Thorin with its claw; 12 slashing damage. At least he holds his spell!

Flurth tries a Taunt, but the dragon resists; so he dashes into the cave to get his brother. "Urth!" we hear him calling.

The dragon swipes again at Thorin but misses. Francesc, with the dragon right in her face, tries to shoot; she can't withdraw as it would attack and she's quite badly hurt by now; but she hits very decisively, though she knows her piercing arrows won't hit as hard as normal. She hits a second time and, as a bonus action, makes herself invisible (but the Blindsight-capable dragon can still see her). The dragon tries to hit Thorin yet again and succeeds, doing 13 more damage (and he holds his spell).

Penny slides under the dragon to heal Francesc for a full 48 and bonus-prepares a L4 Divine Smite. The steed flies above to flank with Thorin and kicks the dragon, dealing 6 damage.

The dragon gets its breath weapon back... It moves, and Penny (with some Heroic Inspiration) hits on an opportunity attack, triggers her Smite and Strike for 7d8+5 damage, dealing 28 total. Thorin hits too with a spell, but the steed misses. The breath weapon fires... DEX saves all round.

* Penny - nat 1 - 43 damage
* Francesc & Thorin - succeed - takes 21
* Horse - succeeds! - takes 21 (4 left)

Thorin moves his sunbeam which continues to whittle down the dragon and it's starting to at least look a bit messed up, but we've a long way to go before it goes down. He turns into an elephant!

"Urth" emerges out of the cave - and looks identical to Flurth! He tries L5 Dissonant Whispers (23 damage, all taken). The dragon reacts by starting to flee! Opportunity attack from Thorin-elephant, tusks; hits; 10->5 (piercing) damage taken. This takes it out of range of Urth/Flurth for a bonus action. Urth tries a crossbow, too, but it goes wild. Flurth runs forward and uses this Dragonslayer shortbow. A hit! 4d6+2->18 damage->9 taken; but the second attempt sadly misses. He throws Bardic (d10) at Penny for good measure.

Francesc sees her moment - lightning arrow. It's a hit! But the 5d8 (40 potential) only does... 8 damage from the lightning. Bad luck. The usual array of other additions. A normal arrow next, which hits; 14-7 damage, plus a maximum 6 on hunter's mark.

Penny jumps on the unicorn and flies up to the dragon; gets in a good hit for 36; swings again; 14 more damage. That does it! The purple smoke from within dissipates; the bones fall apart. "How do you like them applecorns, I mean, like, not laughing now are - oh fuck it" - the latter because Urth has warned us that there are many other bad things below ground and we should run; the rest of the party is already  running, following Urth and Flurth.

A "safe distance away", above the mist in a good vantage point, Urth and Flurth finally slow down at a safe place they know.

We chat. We learn that Urth and Flurth were adventuring. Maybe important things in the cave - artefacts, old, rare here but not necessarily valuable elsewhere. We learn that they've travelled in their words "far and wide", well aware of multiple planes. Penny asks about the red robed figure, which Thorin describes in more detail.

"That must be ..." - the name is hard to pronounce, but Urth speaks it fluently. A more powerful mage. She followed the order when it pledged allegiance to a powerful warlord (...of course).

Penny ends up laying out the four rod pieces to show them. We need the fifth. Our own world is gone; others have fallen and more well fall yet.

Urth confesses... Flurth is not his brother. In fact, he's not - well, he's kinda like Penny's horse. Very loyal, very skilled, very expensive to produce. **We must not cast Dispell Magic in its direction**. Perhaps that explains their ability to survive while smothered in vines for such a long time!

We set up camp here within a small magical hut that Urth constructs. We chat, until eventually settling down to sleep for the night.
