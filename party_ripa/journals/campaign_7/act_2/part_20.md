# RIPA: Act 2 Part 20
## Session 66 (2025-06-03)
### City Of Tyr, Athas, approaching daybreak (Outlands relative day 21)

We are at the inn of the Desert Fox, in the outermost trade district of the city of Tyr. We have made contact with the Mul who were supposed to meet the strange child that we "rescued" from the attacked caravan coming in from Gulg.

At an appointed hour at the now-closed bar/dining area of the inn, two Mul have appeared. One appears to be concentrating on some kind of silence, or privacy-related spell or other effect - a risky thing to do in such a city. The other grabs a chair, looks with disdain at the brandy our group was drinking (considers it a waste of water, perhaps?) and sits with our group.

"Right. Explain yourselves!"

WIS saves all round! Arturo: 15. Penny: 30 (!)... Thorin 35!

One points to Arturo. "This one speaks the truth. The other two hide." Arturo says it's rude to probe minds. "In our culture it's rude to go on killing sprees and thwart a prophecy!"

There is some back-and-forth. We are eventually told that "We *know* there is another reality that is possible, one without the pain and suffering and strife that our people have always known. One where the paradox of our existence is not an inevitability." "The slavers, not the slaves?" "One where we are not *made* and awakened through the - Process..." - and they consider that the rest of Athas can "reorganise itself however it pleases".

During this, Penny, insight only 17 but it's enough to know that they're seeing a rapidly evolving situation and trying to figure out if they have to start again. And it sounds like this is not the first time this "prophecy" has come around.

* Penny mentions taking down the king; that isn't their main aim at all
* But the sorcerer king does need to be taken down but their deep rewriting of reality goes well beyond that
* It's about _control of their destiny_ - a euphemism for something they aren't saying
* They want self-determination - change the circumstances under which they are... Created, born...

Penny offers to open her mind up, to try and understand these concepts. Persuasion 27. But Thorin, insight 25, realises the Mul are hiding something very fundamental that they are unwilling to disclose. There's a dark secret and it's linked to the child and this conversation. He's the only one of the three of us that has realised this... Can he trick them into revealing it? Thorin co-opts Arturo's help, saying that we've talked to Minos and know something of what they're hiding - but he is (wildly) unsuccessful.

Penny figures they're born but then need a soul. And she goes on about that a while, trying to be religious about it - but in the end one of them snaps. No! It's the spark of the *mind*. Mul are born mindless; they have to be *created*, a spark, their elevated free-will consciousness and psionic abilities. They want Mul to be born *with* that spark. But it would make them very, very powerful beings.

Thorin gives up; they tried to get into our heads; he tries to get into theirs - Charm Person. DC18, L2, both of them. The speaking Mul fails; the silence-holder resists. "Hey! What?!" - but it's too late. Thorin wastes no time. "Tell us the truth of creation."

We all try to get that happening. They just about give in; but it's a "we'll tell you, but if we think you're a threat we'll then kill you".

* A quasi-religious order - a cult of sorts
* It's believed that they're born without a consciousness, and then that it is given to them
* Some Mul can't be "awakened" at all at first; awakened Mul work on them until they eventually do and they usually want to rebel by then as they recognise their past slavery
* Minos is part of a secret breeding programme
* He's been indoctrinated from birth for his task
* He's a sacrificial lamb - he'll be giving his life to complete his task, essentially to be locked in eternal struggle with the Sorcerer King
* **The Mul can operate as a hive mind!**

Arturo draws parallel between us freeing the elves and them wanting free will. They're not malicious, the Mul; but they don't care *at all* about other people here, only their own. They (rightfully) have a victim mentality so all they want to do is get to the "top of the heap". Everyone else can do what they want, *as long as* it does not impinge upon the Mul.

It's difficult. Thorin's insight tells him that they'll be able to know how *everyone* else feels, and why, but if anyone's unhappy and that unhappiness would be resolved only by doing something the Mul don't like - **tough**.

Penny opines that they will just reverse history; instead of their people being on the bottom and slowly finding a way to reverse it, everyone else will be on the bottom and find a way. It'll never end. Of course they disagree. Their plan is perfect! Penny HIS 20+4, 24. It's like Illithids; a hive mind; a fervent belief in the perfect formation of their plan; a desire to make reality what they want it to be.

We can do little except suggest we continue to follow each other's plan, as long as we're aligned; take down the king, then our paths diverge. They realise we don't really want to release Minos into their care. "This may not be acceptable. We will be back!"

They leave.

We suddenly realise the Innkeeper is talking next to us and kind of mid-sentence. He seems to think he's been talking to us; but we have no knowledge; we just kind of gloss over it and say we're all done, thank you; we'll head upstairs.

Minos is asleep or meditating or... Something. Thorin pulls us into our other room. "Those guys are very dangerous. To allow that to go unchallenged seems even worse than having the sorcerer king. But I don't know if Minos is necessarily in the same 'place' as them. He's being used as a tool."

There *are* other people. A kind of Alliance. Renegade Mul. The two other Sorcerer Kings. We need sleep... Too many options... We will bunk up in the room with the kid, and be on Watch. Thorin sets up a ward sigil, and we try to sleep.



## Francesc

Francesc and her new-found... Devotees journey across the desert for two days to reach the stone pillars that we first saw on arrival. And then she realises that she, too, can attune to this oasis, like Thorin did. The people there are very surprised, at first thinking the other three of us would perish. The tribe and elves could work together, to protect this place... Francesc isn't exactly inspiring (Persuasion with Luck, 11+0). But she leans into the Prophecy, this being an important religious place - which it is! - and they should train and defend the place.

Thing is, Francesc now isn't doing much of the talking - a translator from the Druids is doing that and *they* get a great response from the crowd! Turns out, it's all in the *delivery*.

So, the druids ask; what is our plan to swell the ranks for this resistance? The other three of us headed to Tyr to try and get more support. The druid offers to take her there, to Tyr; she agrees.



## Other three

Watch:

* Arturo: 17. It's surprisingly noisy. People having an argument they're trying to keep quiet. Minor altercations on the street - seems to be soldiers harassing people.
* Thorin: 21. A lot of time to think about what we might do next. The flow of magic around him feels strange. The city is... Lively with nature magic. Trees grow here. But there is a weakness, a frailty. Something saps away their life force.
* Penny: 7! She's distracted, and half asleep. But she's fully woken by the sound of yelling and banging from downstairs; doors slammed open or shut; sounds of protest.

Penny wakes up the other two. "Trouble". She peeks her head out the door. At the stairs, she sees a group of four guards who've burst into the inn. The Innkeeper is being pinned against a wall and someone else is being restrained; two others seem to be kicking down doors and dragging people out. "We know you're harbouring rebels in here!" she overhears.

Penny goes back inside our room, closes the door; "We kind of need to get out of here. Maybe the window. With the kid. Right now. Can we fly? It's broad daylight! Can we at least hide the kid? We'd just be traders that came into today?"

There's a loud crash as another door is smashed open down below.

Thorin is surprisingly chill. He thinks his sleeping ward will do the trick. A 60ft radius of sleep... But it's only 10 minutes and it might not work! Going out of the *window* would certainly cause a ruckus.

Another door smashed in. Footsteps up the stairs. We have seconds.

Thorin throws a black blanket over Minos. Penny hisses, "NOT GOOD ENOUGH!"; she puts the egg and Minos on the toilet, pulls off the blanket and points at Arturo then the egg, "*invisible, now!*". OK, that done; Penny gets half way through saying, "Act casual" when Thorin's ward is triggered.

* Penny WIS save 27
* Arturo WIS save 17, falls asleep! Aaaand - the invisibility spell fails
* Thorin WIS 35, has time to throw the blanket back over the egg.

Lots of thudding sounds outside. People falling asleep... Nobody comes in... Throin shakes Arturo, but *now* what. Thorin wakes up Minos. We need to get out of here without being seen. He goes invisible! But there is still an egg there. Thorin asks about it. He gets visible again; goes in, gets a blanket and pillow, then touches the egg and it turns into sand. THEN he vanishes again. Thorin spreads the sand around the room to try and make it look less obvious! And then Minos turns himself into, well, just some non-Mul kid.

WIS saves all round - we all pass. Except Minos, who now turns into a Mul. Blanket on the kid, Penny carries him, muttering obscenities as she does so. And she wakes up Minos. "Can we *please* get out of range of this f*cking sp-..." - WIS saves all round. Thorin and Penny are fine, Arturo starts to fall, Minos is asleep again.

Out the front door. There are people asleep on the pavements. "Vagabonds!" declares Thorin loudly. It's very sunny - Arturo thinks they'll be fine, albeit very hot, in 10 minutes of sleep.

* There's a sort of unused market with a few tarps up around a pool for a not-running fountain and a large Jacaranda tree
* A large building further up the street, kind of deep, arched tunnels, maybe a bath house?
* An alley off to the side between some buildings; it's not covered

Arturo says, "Alley way" and Thorin agrees. It's less than 5ft wide, going behind a few buildings. We reach a 4-way junction. Arturo and Thorin look confused. Penny figures - left; that's deeper in. After a few more twists and turns, Thorin sees a big tree - he thinks he might be able to use it somehow, commune with it; he reaches out, about to touch it, hand outstretched...

...right into Francesc's face! The druid had used a tree transport for her, and she came through that very same tree at that very instant.

Penny says, "I didn't think it could get worse, and then..."

Arturo is looking for somewhere to go and asks if we want to try and find the Veiled Alliance now. Minos recognises that - "But we're *meant* to meet them" he says - so do we want to find *other* Mul... Arturo asks if Minos wants to try connecting to the "hive mind" to find all other awakened Mul who might be with another faction. But there is darkness and chaos that has seeped into the community and he is "to remain pure". "I think you're strong enough that you could purify the dark Mul!" says Arturo; persuasion 27; this resonates.

We're in the open, under a tree, middle of broad daylight. Minos has turned into "another kid" again, but even so. Risky. Minos closes his eyes and we *feel* him reaching out, psychically. Arturo says, "Find the Mul who are chaos!" - Minos looks worried. Perception; Arturo 21; furrowing his brow, shaking his head; he's seeing something he doesn't like; he continues to search but it's as if someone is telling him something bad. As if he is being told a scary story. A bad dream. Thorin hopes Minos can hear him; "Be careful what you listen to! You should keep your own thoughts around..." - but then the sand around him starts to shake and pebbles rise off the ground. His face is twisted in an angry look... Penny shakes his shoulders and it works. He's pulled out of it. All the pebbles all drop back down.

He's wild. Angry. He grabs Penny's hands. "WHAT is happening?! I found Mul! But they're - there's nothing *there*." Arturo tries to explain, but Minos thinks he *already* had minds.

Arturo suggests we get to the stables, where our lizard is. At least we can feign having slept with it. But on the way, we hear "Hey, stop! You three with the kid!" (The elf is ignored!). We stop and play along. Two guards. "What are you doing out?!"

Penny looks depressed. "Kid ran off. Always doing that. We wanna get to the stables. Our lizard's there. Gonna sleep." - deception nat 20, 25! "You gonna pay your exit fee?" - oh, so it's extortion! "How much?" It'd be ten *discs* (gold) each! But then Thorin goes all Dwarf on them. "That's *ridiculous*! Do you know who you're talking to?!" Intimidation 21... Well, that does it. They withdraw! And so, we hasten to the stables.

There's a stable girl. Penny gives her a full disc and says, "Make yourself scarce until nightfall".

At this, Penny opens her mind to Minos, so he can learn all that we experienced in the Inn. As this happens, Arturo, Thorin and Francesc catch up and try to formulate a plan. "Resistance" / unaligned Mul seem the best idea. But meanwhile, Minos sits down with Penny, almost catatonic. An existential crisis. Penny says, "Welcome to the club, kid" - but she holds his hand and sits with him, quietly. After a while, they discuss issues of - well, philosophy. Good people, bad people, that kind of thing; Arturo joins in.

Thorin asks the lizard's opinion. The lizard doesn't understand what anyone is saying! Then Thorin asks if there any tunnels around, access ways; the lizard can feel cold air coming from a stall in a certain direction. After a brief debate, we go down the tunnel, bringing the lizard along. Eventually we reach a split in the tunnel; the lizard is allowed to go their own way.

These seem to be natural caverns. There is humidity. Francesc (Survival 22) can find the way there... We go down, lower and lower... Eventually finding **a sunken city**. There are signs of habitation down here; a good sign; maybe this is where the "resistance" hides.

We realise, then, in this calm, how tired we are. We find a space, a hovel really. Minos is probably questioning his life choices. Penny beds down, Minos in tow - "Just go with it. You'll be surprised how these things can end."

Penny only needs a short while and Minos doesn't really sleep. Once she wakes up, she goes on watch while the others sleep. She hears other people, creeping around outside - but stays with the group. More than anything, she watches over Minos.



### Below Tyr (Outlands relative day 22)

Finally, we are reseted. Penny sees Minos is trying to mediate but struggling. She asks if she can help; he attempts a philosophical exchange. People, motivations. He's not been able to question things like this before. Thorin sends out a spirit lizard Familiar to try and find out more about the people around here - what are they like? It reports back that people are gathering in a cistern, an underground water tank, so we figure - sure, why not! And we head out.

We decide to approach confidently. Stealth might be mistaken as subterfuge or threat. And at that, Penny is pushed forward, somewhat unwillingly! She stumbles into a group of people who are startled. Looking quickly around she can see that this vast space used to be full, but is now mostly empty.

It goes silent.

"Hi, um, we're looking for people who want to take down the God King? Because we want to take down the God King."

Even more confused faces! The rest of the group has trailed in behind. Whispers and suspicion. Most people here are human; but not everyone. Someone close looks *almost* human but have weird growths on their face, on the sides, as if a shell grew there.

"We have the means to provide an *actual threat* to the God King, and we want to connect with people who want the same" says Arturo.

An old lady steps forward, from the back of the group. She has an air of authority. "You are playing with uncontrollable fire!" (Thorin nods!) "Do you know what you could have set in motion by kidnapping this child?" After a brief discussion she says, "You have... The taint of magic about you..." and she pulls down her cowl off her shoulder; huge welts, branding; "This is how they mark those of us who can still channel whatever magic exists in our world."

"This is your opportunity to change that!"

Of course, they disagree. We try to warn about the rod. But we're not the first to have warned them! They know of the rod. Thorin is bullish - we are the ones who will take that rod. But this is Athas! "Athas will break you. It will break you last the previous ones who have come. The last one has probably lost her mind; rotting in a cell." Arturo asks her name. "We don't know if the name she gave was true. We only know her as 'the elf'."

We know of Tasha and Alustriel; is Alustriel "the elf"?

"She was the most powerful preserver I have ever encountered and even she was not able to withstand the sorcerer."

Thorin tries to be convincing - we are good at finding allies. A shared goal. We've not been here many days and already have assembled a fair few.

After a pause, the lady says; "We will take you deeper. Are you committed to completing your task?"

We all nod and agree. "Without question" says Thorin.

"Not all of you will probably leave..."

Francesc says, "As always. As long as we get to pick which one..."

"Do you know what you're coming up against?"

Penny - "Well, in truth not really."

"Good. I will take you down further, before you change your minds!"

We end up in what Penny recognises as a temple. 3 storey high, frescoes that are paintings of worlds, mountains, golden sunsets; there would have been actual waterfalls here once, long since gone. The old lazy draws on wisps of magic, scarce, precious; she throws up a daylight spell of sorts. It's weak but works. It's huge - and a refugee complex, or sorts. **There must be 150 people here at least**.

Leading us down broken stairs, we attract attention. Penny holds Minos' hand the whole time. He's not used to it, but after pulling away now and again, always seems to reach back up.

The old lady stops, turns and addresses the gathering crowed. "We have visitors, *again*, from another world." Murmurs in the crowd. "And they have the One Mind's weap - ... - *child*. And they _say_ that they're here to overthrow Karnak!" Uncomfortable; some laugh, even, but others look hopeful.

Arturo scans the crowd for elves. He can't see any, but there are Mul. Other races too. Some have various deformities, but they might be normal or mutations. We don't know. A few half-giants, bigger than goliaths.

"There is a better way. There *must* be a better way. Rewriting reality will not help; one tyrant will replaces another, never-ending. We arrive from another world; we disrupt; we try to bring people together, to find common ground and solve the problems of Athas together, gradually, sustainably, in a way that evolves for the benefit of all."

There's a strange sound, like locusts, clicking; and then a flying Thri-Kreen appears out of the shadows, flying down from high above us.

"Grand words. But meaningless if you have no course of action. What is your plan? Everybody wants to take down the sorcerer king. We can throw *everything* we have against that wall and come up empty! Many  have tried. What makes this different than every other time?"

Well, we have Minos; who if they wish, can help; we draw together; we form a plan; we don't have one, but together we all form one.

Thorin says, "And this isn't done by power alone! We get people where they need to be, find information, figure out how to solve all the challenges."

Arturo; "We hit him where he's week - we just need to find out where that is."

"But he does not leave his sanctum!" shouts a voice in the crowd.

"Really? Well, that is an indication of vulnerability! If he hides there, he must realise he was at risk from previous attempts. He knows himself, he is not invulnerable. It *can* be done!" argues Penny.

Apparently, he is most powerful there; and he's there because he is... Changing. That sounds very bad, but equally, like something we need to disrupt! One person here has seen in the sanctum. **Adul**. He is called for - a waif of a kid turns up, early teens. Half of his face is burned away, a horrible sight, though he seems to have use of both eyes.

"Yes; I saw in the sanctum. I sneaked in. It's not survivable in there! The air is filled with... *This*" - and he points to his face. Thorin is permitted to examine; **an acidic mist**. And he saw a grotesque form, wrapped around an altar in the sanctum where the Sorcerer King now sleeps. A coiled, scaly, black, strange mass with leathery skin covering scales with talons..."

"Sounds like a black dragon" says Penny.

"...but no, grotesque, it's the Sorcerer King themselves, they seem to be morphing into a dragon, but it is not - finished yet. They bring offerings - harpists, dancers, artists, food..."

"Do people come out again?" asks Arturo.

"Not as far as I know."

Francesc asks about that other elf. Do they know where she is? "**Simera** was the last to see her" says the old lady "but we don't know where she is; she's out somewhere, causing chaos!"

Arturo describes Alustriel. But no, that's not the elf the saw! It's someone *else*. People rallied around her. It was 2.5 months ago.

Even so... She could be from our world, either way is a captive, could be a figurehead. A rescue would be a good start to prove our intention. When we voice this, someone runs in with a strange silk satchel, looking at us, seeing if they trust us... "If you do rescue her, she'll need this. If we do rescue her, do we have your word that you'll release her from the Fortress Of The Templars?" - and of course we will. Inside the satchel is a crystal ball and a wizard's spellbook.

Francesc takes it.

Penny asks, "Right. So where do we go?"

We are advised to not do it at night! Wait until it is quieter. They know an underground entrance into the Templar's compound but from there, we are on our own. We'd like to talk to **Simera** too, but we have to find her first!

"Do you want us to... Shield Minos?"

Thorin insight 22. He could be very useful but draws attention. Thorin mentions this. Penny insight 27, Minos is in his own head; but he says, "I don't need you to shield me! I can shield myself." Arturo says, "There's strength in letting other people -" but (rudely) Penny interrupts. **"We're taking him."** He tries to argue more; she says "We're taking him".

We are shown to a room where we can figure out what we're doing next. Penny apologises for being short with Arturo; she knows he'll be in danger, but he needs *some* kind of stability.

Minos speaks up. He talks of us taking down the God King. We're emphatic that he's not with us to die, anymore. It's not just him. It's all five of us. "But what then?" he asks. And he wants to come back with us, after. Penny makes that deal. But only if he wants it!

Francesc meanwhile is checking the bag. A couple of other small trinkets.

* The aforementioned crystal ball
* The spell book has a fancy bookmark.
* A three-sided pyramid with a strange, swirling, liquid centre flashing between fire and some kind of mist. Thorin ARC 26; it requires some kind of activation, it's a magical item; using it would break the casing; **could it be "return us from this plane" device, like that snappable rod?**
* A tiny rolled-up scroll that looks like it fell out of something that had held it rolled up. Francesc unrolls it; a series of letters that **spell out some nonsensical word**. The spellbook bookmark has a tube at the end which looks like it would've held that scroll.

Francesc can figure out what the spells are. The bookmark is on "Locate Object"; the caster would be capable of casting some very powerful spells judging from the rest of the book, but she was described as "a preserver" so she is probably having to restrict her magic use. Francesc INV 20+12 -> 32! Notes about preserving magic power... OK, that's confirmed; and a note, slide between two pages, that seems like it might be a love note! Something private. Francesc reads it immediately. It has that kind of "I'm going to war and don't know if I'll return" vibe.

The book has a name at the very start. **Zorhanna**.
