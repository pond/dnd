# RIPA: Act 2 Part 14
## Session 60 (2025-03-18)
### Inside Llandro, Outlands relative day 10 (even later)

After an eventful path up through the strange mixture of Llandro's superstructure and the mountain, we have finally reached an access tunnel that leads to the Grey Matter Engine itself - but our path is blocked by none other than Glaive. Thorin immediately Moonlight Steps directly up towards Glave... Initiative!

* Thorin 18
* Penny 16
* Francesc 14
* Arturo 9

...and battle commences, with Thorin's quick thinking giving him an advantage momentarily. He throws down a moonbeam on Glave and two scouts he sees alongside. CON 17 saves are made by one of the scouts and Glave, half damage, but the other scout takes a full 25 radiant damage. 

Penny tries to jump up, but fumbles badly - ATHL 1+7->8 - and ends up, nonetheless, right up opposite Thorin - but can't land on her feet. Unable to easily use the sunsword, she tries Sacred Flame on Scout B but they evade and are not hurt. She is at least able to get the sunsword re-lit. Meanwhile Scout A launches bolts at Thorin three times; two hit, then it runs away. Scout B attacks Penny, ADV., two hit, 24 damage. It disengages and dashes away.

Francesc looks up to Glaive and sets Hunters Mark. She calls out what she learns - resistant to poison, immune to being poisoned, frightened, exhaustion or being charmed. She pushes herself up. She fires; the first arrow misses, but the next hits. 22 damage to Glaive, but they react to reduce it (to 14) - tiles of armour flips over, revealing undamaged plates below; and 2 is transferred to one of the scouts.

Glaive tells us how foolish we are (!) - "I will enjoy watching the light fade from your organic eyes by my hand!" - and she seems to sort of charge up; almost vibrating with energy, faster and harder-hitting. She moves out of the moonbeam next to Thorin and attacks twice. Miss - and crit. 17 damage.

The Kalashtar decides to enter the fray - she uses the staff to get a line of sight on Glaive up the neck tunnel and uses something that only Arturo witnesses; she sort of sparkles, with little motes that float up and surround Glaive. WIS save; success; no damage. The Kalashtar runs out of view.

Arturo casts a subtle psychic lance; DISADV INT save DC 19. Glaive fails. 23 damage and incapacitated! Thorin takes that opportunity to push past, recenter Moonbeam behind him and Wildshapes into an elephant. Glaive's CON save against Moonbeam fails - for a whopping 39 damage this time! Penny now runs in, gets a hit for 23 damage with Blinding Smite, and Glaive is blinded; she calls out to let people know; another hit, 14 more damage.

Scout A disengages from Thorin-elephant and runs to Francesc. Two of three attacks land, for 22 damage total. Scout B is hemmed in and tries to *jump over* the elephant - rolling a 20 on a DC of 21 for that check. It ends back where it started! So it has no choice and attacks. Hit and two misses. 12 damage.

Francesc attacks the adjacent scout; hits, 19 damage; hits again, 10 more damage. She tries for Stasis Strike, doing 2 more damage but there don't seem to be another effects (it makes its save).

Glaive can't do anything on her turn; she makes a save and takes 41->20 damage from Moonbeam; and she shakes off the blindness condition and the psychic lance's effects wear off. Meanwhile, the Kalashtar shouts up that she's going to stay safe down below, which is a good idea! It's crowded enough already up here. Arturo meanwhile manipulates various metamagic properties to allow himself to re-cast Psychic Lance and once again, it works! 27 damage and she's incapacitated again.

Thorin tries to get in some hits as an elephant but is finding it tricky in this new, very large and somewhat cumbersome form, so he gets in a stomp on Scout B, 15 damage and knocking them down, and tries a couple of gore attacks - despite advantage, the scout is just too armoured and rolls on the floor, dodging.

Penny gets in a hit on Glaive for 20 damage - who, to Penny's surprise, falls. She seems to overheat and fall apart a little. That doesn't seem right. Penny calls out, "You know, I have a feeling this might not be Glaive - maybe it's a sort of copy, that she's operating from somewhere else, with telepathy or something?" - she moves to flank the scout on Francesc and hits with a smite for a solid 28 damage. Scout A disengages and runs away! It heads *down* the neck tunnel. It is *very* fast, zooming past Arturo and the Kalashtar and heading away and out onto the walkway beyond the "shoulder".

Scout B also tries to run but again, it can't get over the elephant and tries to attack. Two hits out of 3 do 24 damage. Francesc starts running down after the other scout. Penny shouts after her - "It's too fast, let it go" - but she's already half way down. Below the neck near Arturo, Francesc isn't able to see where it went; Arturo doesn't know; so she gets herself 9 temp HP instead! Arturo pushes himself up the shaft, to the upper level, with Mage Hand. He can't see anything past the elephant, and keeps floating up - to be able to see a very tall room. It stretches some 25ft high, maybe 20x30ft on the floor, with the source of the leaking quicksilver very visible now.

The elephant meanwhile tries once again to knock over the scout and succeeds, knocking it prone again and dealing 16 damage. Again, though, attempts to use the tusks prove elusive and both miss!

Penny calls to Thorin, "this is cruel; we don't need to take it down anymore; let it run and get upstairs!" and she pushes off to try and follow Arturo. She gets up there, bumping into Arturo along the way, who floats to one side - we both end up either side of the "neck" shaft.

The only way to describe what she sees would be - a giant brain, but made of something that's neither flesh, nor stone, nor metal. Some kind of ceramic? It's *vast* anyway, filling a good portion of this chamber. Various pipes are attached, some leaking. Chains seem to suspend much of the assembly but those are looking aged and tarnished now. A deep red light courses rhythmically through some of the pipes, seeming to travel in a direction that is "inwards", towards the structure. It isn't static - parts of it move somehow, pulsing a bit. If it seemed truly organic this might've been grotesque but, somehow, it's less unpleasant when viewed as, well, some kind of other thing. But there's a big crack, which leads to a pool of quicksilver - which, as she watches, it seems to swirl up and starts to mimic Penny's form! She looks on in astonishment. It seems to be reaching its hand out, so Penny removes a gauntlet and reaches back - INT save, 21 rolled; a jumble of thoughts and impressions of words cluster into her head but then the language settles. **It starts to speak**, but the prior visions in the cluster beforehand make it clear that this is a vision of Llandro.

Llandro is the actual construct; the Grey Matter Engine has a self-realisation of who, or what it is. An entity essentially distinct from Llandro, and it seems to understand it.

The news isn't good. Emotions. Pain, loneliness, betrayal; it feels forgotten; it senses hatred and longing and loss. (As this happens, not far behind, are the others - Thorin decided to let the Warforged go - he tests it by moving aside a bit and the Warforged does not hesitate - it flees). Even the Kalashtar calls up and is encouraged to join us. She gets to witness this extraordinary sight, too.

Penny tries to picture the "commune", and gem, and the notion of trying to rescue the consciousness. She doesn't have time to say anything, before Llandro speaks - vocally - to all of us.

"Welcome, I am sorry I cannot offer you more."

Thorin asks if it knows what powers it. But no, there's something lodged inside that's misaligned and causes a lot of pain. "It broke the casing".

Casing? We have to assume it's talking about the "brain". We ask and get clarifications... This thing inside can be removed, but if that is done, defence systems activate and the self-destruct will begin.

* If Llandro is removed / dies / etc., self destruct
* If the rod is removed, self destruct
* Llandro recognises the gem and would be happy to move in there - on one condition.

We must somehow fulfil Llandro's innate curiosity. It wants to continue learning, and would gladly come with us in the gem, however, it wants to know *what we consider to be valuable* in terms of knowledge and information. "I would like you to share with me a valuable secret. Something there is no way I could possibly have learned otherwise. I will judge you based on the information that I receive."

Penny's demeanour changes, significantly. She hopes the others catch on. There's only one person who ever wanted secrets before! And they probably sabotaged the teleport.

Francesc insight 25, this isn't a lie. It's almost a program; it has an innate curiosity for secrets. But... *Who* coded that?

Thorin straight up asks. "Who programmed you?"

"My creator. The mages of Sharn programmed me."

Penny tries giving a description of Vecna. Llandro confirms that one of the mages did have a metallic eye, but this is a giant colossus Warforged - plenty of people have metallic parts! And *dozens* of people were involved in creation of the Warforged.

Llandro also - in gem - wants to come *with us* and not be stuck "in a windmill"!

A debate ensues about doing things in the right order. While Thorin and Francesc in particular are debating, Penny thinks about the secrets they know. We don't want to give away the fact that we chased the rod segments in Wildspace, but she decides Figaro's secret is interesting and not too telling - and Llandro approves! They light up, glowing, and tell Penny that there was a powerful magic item fragment which was contentious. The creator mages were not in agreement about what to do with it. One cabal decided to hide it, by putting it within one of the 8 Colossi. Llandro knows the item is inside itself. So, we assumed the engine was being powered by it - this is, in fact, not the case and we just got lucky!

Penny's worried that we should give people a chance to flee if we start the self-destruct. Llandro is able to issue a warning. It won't give much time, but it's better than nothing!

Eventually, the plan is for Francesc to move into the far end of the room just across from the neck opening while the rest of us unavoidably are close to pillars where defenders, we're told, will emerge if we touch the rod (*as well* as the self-destruct starting).

The Kalashtar, once brought up to speed, is *sure* their clothing - from home - was donned more than 5, but less than 6 months ago. Well, there's that - or a rock we picked up from outside the portal, but the former is lower risk. Arturo without wild magic surge uses Telekenesis to gently part the Grey Matter and soon enough he sees the edge of the rod; Thorin yells out to Llandro to give a warning to people inside the body structure as the self destruct will start - a loud siren starts! - and now Arturo can see the end of the rod. A few seconds later he's able to grab it... And the guardians move, appearing where the four pillars once stood.

Initiative:

* Francesc 26
* Penny 17
* Arturo 15
* Thorin 15

Arturo and Francesc swap!

* Arturo 26
* Penny 17
* Francesc 15
* Thorin 15

Arturo grabs the rod with Telekenesis. He moves it into the bag of holding. Penny holds up the gem and indicates that Llandro should enter - they are apparently able to just do it, and in they go - the trigger for countdown will start momentarily.

A guardian acts. A glowing ball of light radiates out; it expands and fills the room. It's - Thorin realises - *a stasis field*. Arturo, ARC 17, knows enough to recognise that it **prevents travel**.

It speaks in some strange, metallic voice using a language we don't recognise, apparently communicating with the other guardians. Francesc doesn't know that the helm might not work and tries to activate it. There's a disorientating warping of the air around, and a strange distortion appears to reverberate around the room, bouncing off the inside of this strange glow around us. **It can't get through.**

She puts Hunter's Mark on that first guardian; it's resistant to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage; immune to poison, radiant, charm, exhaustion, and - well just about any other conditions. So she decides to **"do some reconnaissance"** (AKA "run away") to try and get out of range of the field - she gets down 45ft to the bottom of the neck - and exits. She shouts up to let us know.

It occurs to her on a split second of reflection that the guardian seems to be immune to exactly the sorts of things our party does. How odd... She calls that up, too, but doesn't know what it means.

Thorin follows her, using Mage Hand to push himself down the neck tunnel, followed very quickly by the Kalashtar!

The second guardian sends out a blast of radiant energy, straight through Arturo and Penny and even directly at a guardian across the way. DEX saves; Arturo 22, Penny 22 too. We take 11 damage each, but Penny has resistance to radiant. The guardian moves to block our escape. The guardian hit by the radiant blast takes no damage. Another guardian does the same thing - we both just make saves - 14 damage this time. And the last one. Only Penny saves this time, but it's only 10 damage in full, so Penny only takes 5->2 radiant with that one.

Amazingly, Arturo holds onto his Telekenesis spell the whole time... and uses his action to move Penny 30ft down the neck, without her permission! She yells up in rage, "No you fucking don't! Get the hell out, I can take care of myself!" - but he has a plan, and tries Misty Step, but isn't sure he could get beyond the stasis field so only "steps" just inside. Then he pushes himself past as far as he can go, getting well clear. We all start to hear a loud voice counting what we assume is a countdown.

Penny is able to move down the handholds and gets alongside the Kalashtar.

Guardian A is presumably doing something, but we can't see it! Thorin perception 14, Francesc 12; the stasis field doesn't seem to be moving; but they both see the guardian appear at the top of the neck tunnel. (There is an ability that it doesn't get back at this point). Another radiant beam flies out; DEX saves; Thorin makes it; 10 damage, Francesc takes a full 20.

**We're all out of the field - Francesc wastes no time! She casts with the Helm - and this time a tear opens as normal. We run through.**

Arturo shouts, "I want to see the explosion!" and runs through the portal. Thorin and Francesc don't want to and Penny won't abandon Arturo. We both pop out into the wastelands and then - after what seems like an eternity - a bright flash, a half-dome of incredibly bright energy expanding outwards, then a loud boom and we can *see* a shock wave coming. We dash straight back through the portal.

Suddenly all manner of rocks, bits of twisted metal and more come flying through the mirror on the room side, then it shatters!

The Kalashtar - although dismayed at the mirror's destruction - finally introduces herself Her name is **Hanna-Marel**. She thanks us for saving her. The bat then says, "Oh you're back!" - at *us!* - and we have to explain to Hanna-Marel what has happened.

She gathers the debris from the mirror into a pile while telling us her story. A suspicion of conspiracy, someone trying to destabilise things, a mission of sorts; she's a local agent for an organisation that investigates such. She recognises that we're not from her world. Insight 28 - she's hoping that we drop some hints so she can tell us more about the organisation!

We aren't sure about organisation names but Arturo drops the name "golden vault" - which we thought might be a place _or_ some kind of organisation. But we don't lie and do reveal that we're not working with them, just aligned. We describe the two visions of the teleport for Llandro with Vecna possibly involved, and while she believes us, she doesn't think anyone *else* would, given how important and rare that information is! It might even start the war again. We don't have proof - and any chance of *that* just blew up.

Hanna-Marel is convinced (ADV persuasion 25). She reveals a small glass rod, covered in arcane runes, very magical. "This is a one-time use thing! It won't be for me. If my world is going down, I'm going down with it! And I've never tested it. I'm not even sure why they" (huh?) "gave us this, but anyway - you need something in your hand, very valuable, from the plane you want to visit, snap the rod, and it'll take you there."

Arturo asks who "they" might be. Not Tasha. Hanna-Marel can't even remember, a lot has happened, not a particularly important person she thinks, from a group of four.

We think we're stuck for a moment, but Thorin reveals that he has a blue trade bar from Trade Gate as part of the transaction where we sold the dead god pieces. That'll do!

Thorin says, "I think you've potentially altered the course of this catastrophe..."

**She says, "Can I ask you a question? Was that a piece of the rod of seven parts that you found?"**

Our expressions give away the answer!

She hands over the glass rod. Thorin holds the trade bar and snaps the rod. It's like being inside a breaking mirror! The world cracks in shards around us; and we find ourselves prone, outside Trade Gate.
