# RIPA: Act 2, Part 2
## Session 48 (2024-09-17)
### Trade Gate, Outlands; Sigil day 2, late

Our memories and, indeed, "selves" are mostly restored. We are not without change. There are disagreements that will need to be resolved and likely much more to discuss regarding our strange experiences since the battle at Waterdeep.

For now, though, present circumstances take priority was we finally stand at the edge of Trade Gate, hoping to discover what happened to the interplanar vessel **Lambent Zenith** and/or how we might follow its course to try and track down the second rod segment. All we know is the ship's name, that it departed from here, and that we *think* it was headed for the Radiant Citadel and something called The Golden Vault. We aren't sure if that's a different possible destination, or one of those two names are locations within the other - a vault in a citadel, or a citadel in a vault!

On approach, we see a kind of triangular section which points in two directions and, between them, a large actual literal gate. The city, it turns out is arranged in a kind of five-pointed star overall; we're entering a gate spanning across two of its arms. The gate is iron and stone, ornate, with stained glass embellishments across the top. It's quite beautiful!

The lights in the city have come on; the "sky" above us is dimming.

People walk both in and out through the gate, even at this "late" time; we head in with the flow. The platform for the presumed sky dock is raised on a great tower, with sort of "sky piers" extending out from one end of another "point of the star". The impression is that they float, even though they're really connected to that supporting tower one way or another.

Roads are wide, but paved - not cobbled. Lots of trees. There's a feeling of things leading one towards the middle of the star. There are taller buildings there, but also a great open space. From where we are, we can tell it's a hub of activity. Stalls, some kind of bazaar or emporium in the middle; lots of people milling around.

We realise quickly that each "arm of the star" has a different 'feel', as if a different purpose, be it a focus on race or a particular kind of commerce; in the middle of each is another square and another market. The town seems basically all about commerce.

We confer. We figure we'll find a place to rest; we'll chase after the ship tomorrow. Francesc does want more Arrows +1; that was the only thing that seemed to get through to Vecna. The centre of the town seems as good a place to start looking as any! There's a gate before the main centre area with a name - "The Everything Emporium".

Penny approaches a stall then shouts back "Hey! They really do have everything - this place sells a new personality for Francesc". Arturo is not himself, still dealing with the trauma of his prior experience, but finds it within himself to ask a stall holder. He's given directions. There's an area where gnomes and dwarves have armouries and smithies nearby. Arturo's charisma is on point - "You're new here, aren't you..." - and we learn that we need to go to the Trade Mill Mint to exchange some kind of currency.

OK, mint it is. It seems the only place around with obvious security. A beautiful lapis lazuli dome with gold leaves. Blues and violets seem to be a bit of a city theme. It's heavily guarded but they don't bat an eyelid as we head inside. There's a beautiful mosaic pattern inside, whites and blue shades; various counters; bench seats for waiting. There are guards here but again they don't seem to watch people coming in; their attention seems almost anywhere else. Curious.

We get Thorin to take the lead. He heads up to a counter. There is a female dwarf with long braids, heaped up into two buns. Thorin explains he needs to figure out how the currency here works. They have their own - used quite widely, even in Sigil. Lode Stars - cobalt coins, star shaped, but not too pointed. One of them is the equivalent of a gold but they split into five parts, like 2sp coins, or as a block - they're slightly magnetic - an equivalent of a platinum.

We learn we can change it back if we want and there's no fee; so we change it all!

Thorin checks the count on the exchange carefully... It's exact. We figure we've nothing much to sell, so we move on.

Dwarves, gnomes, a few tieflings, some Modrons floating about - Francesc isn't too impressed - occasional celestial, some humanoid animals... Quite a mixture. Bariaurs (goat centaurs) are quite numerous too. We walk past **Many Roads Maps** and see beyond a section with lots of forges, smithies and so-on. Well, that's the place. Penny figures we need a fletcher, but ideally one that looks like it might do magic - not just mundane. Investigation 23; a sign in a window; "Magic Arrows". Penny laughs and points - we head that way.

It's quite small. "**Arrids Ammos**". Any magic arrows will do, says Francesc! +1, +2, fire allows, all kinds of arrows... She asks about the cost for a +1. 25gp each. "25? How many have you got?!" says Francesc. They've got 2 bundles of 20. "Thorin, pay the man!" - a masterclass in bargaining. Thorin suggests maybe a *little* more investigation first! "How much is a +2?!" - at this point we're all looking around and assessing Arcana, but rolls are generally rather low - 16 or less. We have *some* idea. The store keeper tells us about a few; some Arrows of Walloping; bundles of +1; Winged; Bloodseeker... And even arrows with some kind of dried leech embedded! Francesc is intrigued - but they're 125gp each. The Winged are from Mt Celestia. Guide themselves; can work at very long range... But 150gp. The last is the Bloodseeker, as a bundle of 5 but they'll split the bundle if we insist. 400gp each tho.

* A bundle of +1s - 500gp
* 5 leech arrows - 625gp

Arturo and Penny try to negotiate a price. 1125->1100gp (we realise that in Trade Gate there is *minimal* price movement - prices are already checked here and considered to be fair already). Essentially we get a free +1 arrow.

Penny knows a good inn. Safe but spartan; cheap. Even so, we ask, as she missed a lot last time. We're given directions to **The Wayfarer's Hostel** - *not* the same place but it looks good. We take a room for four, rather than a shared dormitory room. It's on the third floor; bathrooms are shared up there, but the rooms are private.

We try to formulate a plan for tomorrow. We need to try and find out where the ship went and if anyone knows what happened to it; figure out a way to follow its course and try to find the wreck. Our room happens to look out in a direction that means we can see the sky port platfom. The tower is clearly not enough to support the weight - magic *must* be involved - and there are various ships docked. Some are ship-shaped (!) and others are very much not; we're unsure what those are. The whole thing is lit up.

It's been quite a ride. Only just re-met; turned into clouds and flew for two days; and here we are. We get food at the inn, set up Alarm and crash out in bed.



### Trade Gate, Outlands; Sigil day 3

Outside is 'daylight', insofar as is possible without any visible specific sun. It's more noisy outside.

We don't waste time. Let's find a way up! Arturo has a theory that the tower we see is probably there to provide exactly the access we want. It doesn't take long to find a road that heads that way, given it's at the end of one of the star points. Luck roll, D20 -> 11. From a distance, watching, Arturo sees some kind of platform descend down towards a building below. We head that way, finding it easily; "Sky Dock Loading", says a sign; it's a warehouse. Arturo and Penny can only see goods being lifted, but ask (ADV persuasion 26 with Arturo assisting) and we learn that in fact - if we don't mind! - we can get on the platform along with the next load of goods and get taken up with it.

We have to hold tight; we're on the edge, so need to take care.

The group doesn't mind the height, but wind blowing past isn't much fun for Arturo. It's surprisingly odd to be *not* magically assisted this point, on just a simple mechanical device - we've grown accustomed to using our abilities. We soon see lots of Aarakocra, the prevailing species working up here apparently - which makes a lot of sense for safety.

The lift reaches the platform and the Aarakocra seem very unsurprised at our presence. They just get on with unloading as we disembark. We're in another warehouse, with two wooden walkways heading out. We pick one at random (to the left). Once beyond the warehouse walls, rope guardrails provide *some* safety but it's still rather precarious! We immediately look around for what might be some kind of main administrative office. To one side we see various ships docked on piers. To the other side is the main platform, with another two ships. That's all we can see from here.

Penny suggests we go to the main platform, since the warehouse blocks our view and surely an admin office would come off the platform, not some random pier. As we head that way we do indeed see a smaller building, this one made of stone - like, surprisingly, the platform itself (the warehouse and walkways having been made of wood). It has arched open windows, large enough for a person. It looks almost like part of a castle. We see an Aarakocra fly to one of the open windows and walk in. Is it an aviary? Arturo is curious and wants to look. We head over.

A sign above it is in a language we don't understand. It's runic. Druidic runes almost and some kind of alphabet. None of us know what it says, and Arturo expresses concern as we *might* find ourselves needing to steal a book of logs or something, which would be tricky if we can't read the language! Well, we can't do much about it; we just go in. Inside are various Aarakocra; Arturo approaches one and asks about the ship. He gives the ruse that it was carrying something of great sentimental value that seems to have been lost. Deception 29!

It works, but we learn that while there are departure records, there's no destination port recorded. They do know where it came *from*, but need to narrow it to a date. We guess at 4 months ago. No good. Penny tries with 6 months ago. No! The Aarakocra is helpful though and pulls down another book - "Ah, very close! 5 1/2 months ago. Here it is. Lambent Zenith. They birthed here for a full two weeks! Origin port... *The Radiant Citadel*. Captain was called... Well, *who* were you expecting the Captain to be, exactly?!"

Thorin - thinking of bribery! - Religion 9... "Would some gold help?!"

The increasingly unimpressed harbour master says, "I don't see how gold would increase the likelihood of *you* remembering who the Captain is. But what difference would that make to you anyway?".

That's a dead end. Penny agrees; other people might know the Captain's name if we're trying to chase down the ship, but they'd equally likely know the name of the ship. And if the ship isn't here, it's unlikely their Captain is here too. But is there a place where ship crews often gather?

He gives us some ideas.

Penny tries to describe her vision. The harbour master doesn't think there's a good fit to anything much except maybe Wildspace, except Penny's description of colours is too dense and vivid. History 17; her memory is OK, but it's very hard to have a frame of reference. We enquire more about the nature of Wildspace or the Astral Sea and learn that between planes, is the Astral Sea. Then within a plane, you may not end up directly on a world. But beyond that world, one is in Wildspace (Insight 18).

Thorin, Luck roll (high is good): 8! On brand. "If you want to know more, I can strongly recommend a book store!"

Book store first, pub next. We need to understand what's possible - which "spaces" does one need to pass through from here to the Radiant Citadel? Is Wildspace involved at all?

The bookkeeper is a Solar - Watchman's Dr Manhattan. Genderless, unclothed body, silver eyes, glowing. 8ft tall, floating slightly above the ground! They greet us telepathically. We explain likewise what we want to know. It seems though that the trade here is knowledge. He wants to exchange knowledge. Fortunately, the gaps on their side are about Toril and recent events. We warn that recent events are not fun! And end a few months ago - with Toril's own end.

Penny elects to share, but history is only 13. Francesc is better - 19; and she had a better view in the battle. WIS saves are needed too; they're high for everyone, except Francesc; 15 - a flood of info. But this makes sense; she's remembering some very nasty things, for our part of this bargain.

We learn.

From a place like the Outlands, a ship would exit via a portal created in The Outlands which only goes to the Astral Sea. Only Spelljamming helms can do it. No Wildspace. The Outlands and Astral Sea have no other connection; think of them as parallel. That's unusual given Sigil's connection to - everything. Now, the Astral Sea is unbelievably vast, but operates **as a single plane** connecting all other portals and planes together. There's almost nothing that can be assumed about what may be found there. Portals, fortresses, transposed pockets of other planes living in "holes" within the Astral Sea, places created aeons ago and long forgotten except by those living in them... And more. Anything more! It is also the stage for cosmically giant battles between civilisations that cannot be contained within a single plane anymore. The Githyanki patrol in ships and try to stop terrestrial-bound creatures using individual spells to try and traverse the sea. They look like beings with a silver thread coming off their head and disappearing off into "the ether" - tethered to some unconscious real creature on a material plane somewhere.

And it contains the husks of all gods that have ever died or are dying. When they lose their connections to planes where people believe in them, they're cast adrift in the Sea. Colossal sized beings. Petrified. Over time, they disintegrate into **chunks of rock** that grind against each other until turning into stellar dust.

(This kind of blows Penny's mind)

Now, Wildspace. When enough mass exists to create a sort of "Wildspace atmosphere" around it, it gets bigger one way or another; Gods eventually will something into being, solidifying it - from thought to material (hence Material Plane).

(This sounds like total hokum to Penny!)

A question from Thorin to the harbourmaster had a confusing answer now clarified. One exits the Astral Sea to a material plane through a portal that all such "bubbles" of Wildspace have. Then you fly Wildspace to reach the celestial body within.

Any ship going to a particular destination might take *any* path on the Astral Sea, to get to its destination. The path is irrelevant and cannot be mapped.

So it comes down to those visions and what we really saw. We figure we'll try the rod again. The Solar says there's a reading room, but they want knowledge and want to observe. We can't risk them sharing the rod visions. They don't mind; the trade we've already done was fine; maybe a private room at a tavern? Risky. How about the inn? We get back. It's after checkout time but they're happy to extend the booking! We retreat to our room.

Penny casts Nondetection on herself. We'll try to grab the rod and see if we get the visions again first. Penny takes off the upper plate; we get the rod; Francesc holds it.

Nothing!

She tries to think about the rod, give it a "mental nudge", via the prior visions. Arcana check - 9. No good!

Penny has a go. Initially nothing. Arcana 13; something... It's awakening but too faint. "Arturo, this needs more magic than I have". Arturo Aracana 16. If he fed it a bit of raw magic it should do it! He dumps in a spell slot; essentially, channels raw magic. We all can see that the crystal piece's inner glow has dimmed a lot; suddenly, it flares up as Arturo tries things! INT save, 18 (+5 from aura). A flood of visions like last time. All out of order.

* Ship leaves port; a brief moment from a distance of it just moving away
* Beautiful, almost golden-tan-skinned woman with pearl eyes without irises, dark brown bob haircut, pair of wings, one of which is angelic, white feathers, but the other partly mechanical; a short-sleeved leather top; bare arms, silver tattoos, at the helm - and behind her, two Githyanki flanking, with silver swords, greenish freckled skin as the ship punches through a portal, leaving Trade Gate
* A scene in somewhat spartan, cramped quarters, the same woman with a silk-wrapped item being placed into a small pearl box and wards put upon it, then put into a cupboard by her bed
* A flash to people running across the deck, frenzied activity; a mast crashes down; weird streaks, like ink blots in water, spreads of colour coming from all directions (like Dune 2 Harkonnen homeworld fireworks) - **against a silver, featureless sky**
* People reach for each other, trying to save people as part of the ship breaks apart
* The winged woman, one wing broken and missing, injured, staring out over a deck that has been severed, seeing another part of the ship hundreds of feet away across an expanse, embedded into chunks of rock, some free floating, some tumbling
* An area of reddish purple, almost bleeding out, forming a miasma, but beyond that - **silvery sky** (but no other 'landmarks')

D6 -> 5 - psychic damage, sadly. Ouch. Arturo is nonetheless able to relay what he saw.

Penny asks if the piece floating away from the woman was the stern or bow? Neither - the middle! The ship must be in several pieces. They were, at that time, close by; they seem to be in the astral sea.

**The woman is alive** and the rod is in her section. The harbour master mentioned that on the Astral Sea you don't need to eat or drink, so she may still be alive. Is this not just a recovery mission, but a rescue mission for her, and potentially more of her crew?

Thorin knows something of Githyanki. They're violent, vicious, vengeful; at least, that's what he was told by the people he met in Limbo. Penny was hoping to maybe get help in taverns near the platform, based on sailors wanting to help sailors, but we know some of the crew might - not be so popular! But there were other creatures / races Arturo saw.

Penny's vote, then, is to get to a watering hole near the platform - a rough one ideally! - get lunch and tell tall tales, hoping to deliberately attract attention that turns into help.

Vairous comically bad insight etc. rolls arise as we try to determine which of several options we visit. Penny, insight 19. To the right - something more reputable. Left and middle, rougher but larger. Insight indicates officers are more likely to be on the right. Thorin makes a good point that the crew are more likely ot have stories, but we need people with the power to make decisions.

Right it is. "The Starry Bough". We get a table inside. Penny asks for middle-of-room if there is one; we get a decent table, kinda central. We get a list of specials; all soups, which sound quite crazy. We end up with a set menu involving Bearded Pig (!).

It's not ideal that there's no bar. We think we can try talking loudly about stuff instead - but Arturo, performance only 1+5 -> 6! We get asked - very politely - to lower our voices... Arturo + Penny Intimidation -> 25; politely but firmly; we request perhaps an audience with captains here instead. The maitre de, curiously, suggests a house wine - the "Hiring A Captain" vintage! We'll take one.

A bottle is taken and poured for us - separately, a second bottle with a note is taken to another table.

Eventually, one walks over from there. We get into it. They have quite a large ship - 5 staterooms to accommodate four or five people, or even at a push, up to 20.

Penny D20->16 on self-imposed DC13 to realise she should ask - she describes the character from the vision. Thorin and Arturo, perception, sees this person shudder. Definitely recognises the description but clams up. A strange reaction. It'll take some persuasion to keep them engaged. Fear? Dislike? Penny doesn't see that *at all*, but Arturo gets into it. Turns out it's the *crew* that is the issue. They're "a little rough, they're banned from this fine establishment!"

We learn the name of the Captain is Inda.

Penny has to reveal the nature of the rescue and describe the situation, lest we - as a rescue - found ourselves victims of the same fate! The Captain to which we speak - **Tomoko Kabashi** - he thinks it's very strange; you'd have to deliberately try to fly your ship at a dead god to crash it. But we remind them of the strange "ink blot" streaks and colours; something seems to have afflicted them. Tomoko says that they have skiffs and would keep their main ship at a distance to aid safety for a rescue.

We haven't given much to navigate with. Drifting on navigation by thought would take time. Arturo asks if there is anything to speed it up; navigation aids at best; Arturo saw none in the visions.

Could we Scry once in the Astral Sea? Worth a try. We consider the Helm - wildly risk.

(Penny considers Commune via the rod; but the talk of dead gods; that she learns magic *does* work on the Astral Sea; yet if gods are connected to planes until death, how can they be on the Astral Sea to power magic - *her* magic - so did she even talk to Meliki at all in Bytopia? And even if she did, would Meliki have any ability to know of events on this strange Astral plane?)

We have little choice. One way or another, we have to charter this ship and wing it from there. The cost is 50gp per day with a lot thrown in, 30 days maximum cap. Thorin insight nat 20 -> 29. There's a printed rate card! It seems legit. And this Captain was recommended. *And* it's a true rescue mission. The taken crew will be absolutely minimal too, to maximise space on board for rescue.

Well then. "When do we leave?"

"I'll need a day to prepare."

"So not tomorrow, but the day after - where and when should we meet you?"

We can be picked up from where we're staying, or go to the ship. **The Scarlet Arrow** - it's red! - so we say we'll meet up there in the morning. We're welcome to look at the ship any time.

We part company. They finish their meal; we finish ours. At the very end though a Halfling comes from that other table. A crew member, **Cyrix**. She says, "I won't be coming with you so I'll have a bit of shore leave! But Tomoko did explain the situation and the person. Now, I had a friend on board the Lambent Zenith - and I am hoping that she's fine. But if you do manage to get there, I hope you can rescue her". A name written on card is handed to us. **Kycera** (the cook, an orc).

Arturo asks if there's, say, a note we could have that proves we do know her. She gives us a necklace - a droplet of amber; encased within is an insect. "Kycera made that for me". They swap it - depending on a card game they play, whoever wins keeps it. Arturo (via Insight nat 20) remembers to ask when that last was. "5, maybe 6 months ago?" - well, it lines up.

Once we leave, we feel we have to try in the rougher tavern. But then suddenly... Arturo's insight... This was *made* by someone on that ship. And it was given away less than 6 months ago. **The Helm could take us there**. We could get to the Astral Sea; take something off Scarlet Arrow; jump to Kycera, understand where we are, jump back to Scarlet Arrow and navigate.

We figure we're going to the bar for tall tales anyway! Off to **The Pig & Whistle**. Thorin first - needs a DEX save! - 19, Penny *just* being close enough for +5. He ducks, just in time, as a bottle of beer grazes the side of his head. It smashes on a wall behind him. Thorin ATHL check - 26 to beat?! - +0, can't do it. He's grabbed and flung halfway across the room, crashing down onto some chairs. 3 points damage.

Then someone runs into that gap. Penny, close behind, has just seen the funniest thing in the entire world and when this other person runs to her, they just run into the palm of her outstretched hand. It's an *almighty* brawl that we all step into!

Initiative:

* Penny, 18+4 -> 22
* Thorin, 10+2+0 (thrown 20ft, out of aura!) -> 12
* Francesc 10
* Arturo 5

(End of act 2, part 2)
