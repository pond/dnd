# RIPA: Act 2 Part 17
## Session 63 (2025-04-29)
### Athas oasis (Outlands relative day 17)

After a much-needed rest, we awake in the early hours of the morning. It's still dark.

We are at an Athas oasis. Thorin has made a commitment to this place which in return means he has a connection to the land, restoring his magical powers.

Overnight we didn't set watch, but Francesc doesn't sleep per se; she goes into a trance. Perception 26. There is constant movement happening around the cave network camp. At one point she hears lots of people running up tunnels. She decides to quietly investigate, as she's rested, but the rest of us aren't yet. Darkvision helps too. There are sort of hides in the rock mounds - it allows people to look at the surface without giving themselves away. Looking through, she sees people darting from one rock tower to another; listening carefully, she can tell they're moving swiftly but trying to be quiet and using their vocal insect-like calls and hand symbols to communicate stealthily.

Another head pops up in a hide about 30ft away and she catches their eye. But she can't risk shouting. She tries to communicate wth a confused expression and shrugs! In response there are a series of hand gestures. Insight 19; from context - danger has been spotted (in a direction they indicate), be quiet, keep head down, they have not yet identified what it is. Relative to Francesc, the disturbance is coming from the general direction of the temple - which was the direction of original incursion, when the water was poisoned.

Francesc lets Arturo sleep. He's exhausted. And Penny is - not so stealthy. Thorin can be, but he's very tired too. She proceeds alone! Stealth 26. A whole bunch of things - she'd thought they were more stone pillars in the dark, black and white, poor depth perception - move, their profiles changing, then some parts seem to "peel off" and skitter away on 6 sharp, pointed legs. They are climbing up onto other rock outcrops. Francesc is sure that *this* is the danger - and it's many, many smaller creatures, not one large creature. She tries to indicate this back towards the other person down in the "hide", Disadv. persuasion: A solid 15. It's enough! They understand many small creatures are climbing all over; nod; point downwards, indicating "get below".

Francesc heads down and tries to find the person from up above - they're heading to her too and now they can talk. They confer about the details. These creatures she describes? Natural scavengers - carrion eaters - not a concern! The group thought it was some larger, amorphous creature that had made its way into the camp.

So that's that! The camp calms down as word spreads.

Since she's awake, Francesc stays loosely "on watch" until the rest of us wake up. It's a lot cooler, even though "cool" is still relative. The temperature is bearable - maybe ~18-20 degrees.

We are brought up to speed on the excitement earlier. We come to the conclusion that by Toril reckoning it would be about 3-4am.

We consider plans. We need to overthrow that king and get the rod - the king is viewed as a god - do we need an uprising?! We find people we know and Penny, as delicately as she can, tries to broach the topic. Persuasion ADV with Arturo's help - nat 20 -> 30!

It's a rousing speech, behind the dice roll `;-)`

They are emboldened, and open up somewhat. Karnak has positioned himself as the Sorcerer-King of the largest, richest city state - that of **Tyr** - that is the one we saw in the distance on the way in. The city's decadence is seen as an affront to everywhere else, pretty much; it is maintained through sorcery, and that sorcery kills the land around. It's surrounded by barren wasteland and desert, yet the cities has fountains and ponds and lush palm forests.

The grand palace is where Karnak has positioned himself. Further, Karnak is undergoing some kind of physical transformation and is now known as the "Dragon God", presumably because of the rod; there are no other dragons on this world, long gone, so that gives him even more social power.

"To attack Tyr would be assuredly suicide" they say (well, yes)! It's extremely well defended; ruled with an iron fist, highly authoriatrian. There are other allied city states, subservient to Tyr - an ancient cultural city **Nibenay** and a rich trade city, **Gulg**. That increases Tyr's power further.

There *is* an existing rebellion but scattered, ill-equipped and repeatedly suppressed; it is divided into factions and we'd need to get them to work together. But there are long standing disagreements and issues of trust between them.

* The halfling tribes: Easily the most ferocious and fiercest warriors! But they have, over generations, turned rather feral. Now *very* savage. Almost nobody has anything to do with them because they're considered too wild and uncontrolled for reason. Oh - and they're cannibals.

* Another option: Free the elves. Almost all the elves in the land have been over the centuries captured and sold as slaves. And worse, they're considered the "lowest" slaves as they aren't particularly strong or hardy. The elves are the cheapest and weakest.

* Little pockets of rebellion exist in city states but they're underground and the people we are with can't really connect us to them. We'd need to make contact and prove ourselves. They consist of half-giants, almost always gladiators and **the Mul**, a "created race" (said in way that sounds like it's a socially difficult issue) very strong and more are constantly being created due to their hardiness.

Thorin asks if there is a consistent symbol for rebellion; no - it's disorganised. "Anyone who causes trouble is probably linked to a rebel faction!" - but there isn't really 'a rebellion'; nothing so coherent exists. Thorin asks if there's a city that's more prone to rebellion? There *was* - the city of **Ur Draxa** where a first rebellion tried to start up. Karnak and another Sorcerer King descended there and just unleashed necrotic energy across the whole city. It's now a city of undead - nobody goes there. Nobody dares. Vengeful undead, nothing more, with an unfulfilled purpose.

We could talk to other tribes of Thri Kreen; that's where this group here learned their psychic powers, over generations. Apparently, it's something to do with the Athas sun, combined with living amongst those creatures a lot; these powers were awakened in them. But the Thri Kreen aren't very trusting.

We would have to be very careful - if we come up against *any* of the Sorcerer Kings' or Queens' forces, we'd be in trouble. Nobody else is allowed to use magic outside of their ranks. They are surrounded by scores of templars, all casters, but all getting their power from their King or Queen. Anyone else caught using magic would be arrested and either forced to work for the crown or killed.

We consider options. "Free the elves" is tricky - most are dispersed, as slaves, not grouped. Some escaped to the wilds but are rag-tag bands trying to avoid being eaten by the wild animals or halflings. There are, however, some caravans. What little trade there is, happens in caravans; safety in numbers. Think "mad max", though, not "quaint wooden carts"! They have the cheap, expendable slavesÂ `:-/`

Penny figures that the Thri Kreen would read our minds and hopefully not be put off! We have dealt with Thri Kreen before; Penny wears their armour. And there's a lineup there - Thri Kreen often ambush the caravans, so we could perhaps jump in with that to fight with them *and* free elves (but the Thri Kreen _might_ think we're attacking in competition). Since they're nomadic, spotting a caravan and attack might be our best option.

Trading caravans leave pillars of dust behind, which makes them easier to spot - but they travel almost exclusively between dusk and night, *not* during the day.

For reference, our 3-4am ish means there are some 2 hours left of usable "day" (night!); by 8am at the latest, people are hunkered down.

We could head out, but don't want to get stuck out in the sand. There aren't any tricks - by 9am the sun is *fully* up and we'd be in very serious trouble.

They draw maps in the sand - us, Tyr, other cities, caravan routes, rough idea of travel time. A triangle: we're at the base. Tyr at the apex. Nibenay and Gulg at the points. This is the "**Ivory Triangle**". But Nibenay and Gulg don't trade with each other; they trade through Tyr. If they _did_ trade with each other they'd go through "dangerous halfling territory" - so that's an idea of the "base of triangle" region.

Thorin is keen to get underway straight away and go as far as we can before it gets too hot. Penny is nervous about finding a place to stop, but Thorin then suggests Wind Walk - we can't talk, but we agree to let Thorin lead and we'll follow. In a couple of *hours* we could get half way to Tyr!

We even come up with our own motion-based set of indicators "as clouds", taking inspiration from our new tribal friends.

There is a catch - Penny (Nature 17) recognises a risk. Athas has no clouds; we'll stand out for that. But in the dark, quite high and moving fast? Maybe not so bad.

We head up and look around. Two moons! One larger, dark red; one smaller, pale yellow. That means two sets of faint shadows of different intensity. With no clouds, these are consistent. A plan would be - keep high for fast travel, then get very low once we've an idea of where to be, so we're hard to see against the landscape.

The risk is worth it. People bid farewell; Thorin casts.

It's an unusual experience as the connection to this local piece of land is very specifically tied to him now. The tribespeople watch in astonishment as we turn first to liquid, then evaporate into clouds. To them it is close to a miracle and, after a minute, we are flying.

Nibenay or Gulg? Gulg is the more active trading partner, we expect, even if Nibenay's cultural background might mean higher value art-and-artefact based trades. Thorin heads "to the right" relative to Gulg and goes up - and up - and up. The higher, the better; he can see more and we can be seen less from the ground. It's almost a *mile* up in the end. We all wonder at the moon-like landscape below. The sand is pale, almost milky white; some look darker, reddish. It's much easier to imagine that this sea of silt was once a real sea and Gulg, once, a mercantile, port city.

Mesas rise near once-coastlines - they are, actually, ancient sea cliffs. Two, long, trailing columns of dust are very easy to see, travelling between Gulg and Tyr, heading towards Tyr. They're roughly equidistant. It might take an hour or so to reach them at full speed (we're going at 300ft/6sec, which is more than 50kph). Thorin wants to keep away from Tyr! He aims for the one closer to Gulg, staying high up.

Thorin: D8 -> 3. About 40 minutes into our approach, heading in our direction towards us, a collection of shapes; a group of flying creatures. Thorin bobs up and down to indicate "dive" to us, then does so -  and the group of approaching flying creatures match the dive. No doubt now; they see us, even if they don't know what we are. In so doing, they break formation and Thorin can make out 6 leathery-winged creatures with long beaks and long tails. Thorin indicates "break formation" for us to scatter - ADV Acro:

* Thorin only 12! 
* Francesc 18
* Penny 10
* Arturo 15

We're dashing, at some 600ft/6sec, around 110kph!

Thorin and Penny don't do such a good job. Thorin heads one way and Penny happens to follow him too closely, and this means the two close together are chosen as targets for these flying creatures. They dive and snap at us! They do get some hits in; we're resistant to it in cloud form; only 4 damage taken each.

We try to continue dashing, but no dice! Nat 1 for Penny and Thorin, which is poetic given the attack. The other two fly ahead but quickly realise we're not with them, slow down and we regroup.

The rest of the trip is uneventful. Penny perception - uuuh - never mind... Francesc perception 24. It's not a featureless desert by any means. Especially as we descend, more and more features become apparent. Just takes a while to "get your eye in" because a lot of things are submerged in the sand, but things still stick up, or make mounds - rough shapes, easier to spot from the air. There's a fair bit of activity, creatures scurrying around, usually in small groups. In the mesas, tiny wisps of smoke indicating potential presence of settlements - well, maybe nothing so large - but campfires, at least. We also spot a couple of small oases, no more than three or four trees each, on rocky outcrops. Presumably small springs or similar are present there. Probably heavily contested!

We're about 3000ft from the caravan, which moves steadily towards Tyr (our "left"). Thorin angles to get in front, because it takes a minute to "re-materialise". He surveys for places to set down; perception 18; the best is some half-mile up. A few low hills with ruins sticking out. Perhaps the hills are just dunes that built up around them. The caravan will get there in maybe 10-15 minutes. He estimates that this gives us about half an hour until they're likely to stop for cover - and we hopefully will have time to plan for the same ourselves.

Thorin leads. Perception 12. He isn't sure the best place to set down; just go "behind" the hills.

And now - the Awkward Minute! We start to coalesce. Most of us are distracted but Francesc, high perception roll, notices - **we are not alone!** - little streams of sand are moving down the dune, a sure-fire sign of something moving around atop it. But she can't see up there from this perspective and there's nothing more she can do until the minute is up.

Francesc hurriedly relays the information - and people tense up. DISADV Stealth for Penny -> 1+5! Only 6. Immediately, lots more sand starts cascading down and in an instance we're surrounded. They hold polearms. In particularly they're pointing them at Penny. She figures - the armour, and "thinks as loud as she can" - "we come in friendship!" - and tries to think about the Thri-Kreen that she knows.

WIS saves:

* Penny 31 - absolutely chooses to fail it (and they know this)
* Thorin 28 - same as Penny
* Francesc 7 - they're in her head
* Arturo - they're in his head, too

Penny continues to control the direction of her thoughts, as described. Thorin thinks about the tribe we just met, that he's a protector of the land.

Thorin gets push-back. "You're *not* from *this* world?! Where have you come from and why have you come here?"

Penny gets "*why* do you have ceremonial armour?"

Penny tries to explain - and, "your people are spread across the planes and flourish". Response: Mind blown. Thorin tries to explain about planes, fighting alongside in the pub battle, celebrating winning a bet with them when Penny fought...

Most cautiously lower spears, except one, still trained on Penny. "You dishonour the armour" to which Francesc says out loud, "Not wrong", but when Penny recovers from laughing she thinks, "I am sorry. It is not intended. In what way?"

The armour was given a long, long lineage back to the family of those gave their lives up to protect the queen in the Great Battle that they *lost*. To wear the armour is to remind them of their greatest defeat and their greatest shame. To wear it so openly is insulting. Only this one reacts that way. Penny says, "I rely on this greatly for protection. But given it is so important to your culture, I would carefully stow it away and not wear it again, if that pleases you?" - and the spear is lowered. "That would be acceptable."

So, Penny starts - carefully! - removing the armour while the rest of the telepathic debate continues.

This is noticed by others in the group. One hands Penny some functional, spartan leather armour produced from a backpack; it must've been taken from a humanoid; she thinks "Thanks!" and fits it as best she can.

They want us to go. Our timing is bad. Penny explains as best she can that we're here to liberate slaves, and assist them; nothing more; persuasion 23. It's curious; they treat it as a negotiation of diving up the spoils! Penny agrees, not wanting to get into it more at this time.

And now we wait.

Telepathically, it's all open. There is no sound, yet people are shouting! It's quite bizarre. Penny holds back, as she's not stealthy. Francesc sneaks forward - stealth 30. She has full view of the caravan. They're not stupid! They aren't going close-by these ruins which could hide ambushers. As they get within a few hundred feet they swerve wide, staying at least 150ft away from the edge of the dune hills.

The caravan is pulled by huge armour-plated reptiles. Six-wheel caravan "trucks" in tow. They are jagged and complex - bone spikes abound as armour, heavy leather tarps, caravan drivers at up front, riders on the reptiles too. One up front, very large. One behind pulled by two smaller reptiles. Maybe 8 to 10 caravans, various sizes, one even with tiny but rusty pieces of metal around it, like binding around a beer barrel. Flanking are riders on what can only be described as reptilian birds - like raptors, but a big enough to ride, with saddles. Francesc, so far, can see three on each side. They're on high alert.

At the mention of "slaves" earlier, we'd agreed on lethal force - but taking care not to hurt slaves.

Thorin considers Hallucinatory Terrain, trying to make it look like the caravan must change course a bit and get closer to us. 300ft range. He wants to make it look like "bad ground", in a way that indicates a wider berth is too hard and a closer path looks safer. It would require repositioning and that might give his position away. Then he has the idea of Find Familiar for a bat - bat-wing-things seem relatively common here - and cast through *that*. Wait, even better - a moth! He summons, then casts.

He presents an illusion of soft, deep, silt sand. The sort we were trapped in ourselves. Caravans would struggle there and it's a subtle, local effect. (DM roll) - they do spot it; the guard yells a warning in a language we don't understand. Lots of noise from them, which help us remain undetected. Even more dust too, which means the tail end of the caravan has less visibility of the front *and* it causes a panic - because someone in the caravan detects something *wrong*. They figure out it's a trap - well, we think that from tone of voice; but they think the trap is *the illusion*, on high alert. The caravan diverts even more sharply.

The Thri Kreen strike! A polearm goes straight through a guard and into their mount too. It falls against the caravan which now swerves even more, causing even more confusion. The caravan behind actually twists so hard that it rolls and is crashed into by the one behind. Only the front caravan, now driving *really* hard, is gunning it - in our direction, but trying to skim past. Thread the needle. The Thri Kreen aren't interested in it. That makes it of interest to Penny, and Francesc thinks the same - she starts aiming to take out the driver. It's within 100ft and would probably close to within 60ft at the nearest part.

As Francesc shoots, Thorin moonlight-steps towards it and prepares a dirt and stone trap - a sort of pothole with a bump - with Mould Earth (difficult terrain).

Francesc to hit - 28, hitting the the rider on the reptile ahead of the caravan driver. 10 damage, in the shoulder. This means one arm isn't working well and the reptile isn't being controlled so well and gets more unruly. Second attack hits too, 19 damage! The rider is knocked off their mount and, still tugging on the reins as they call, the reptile is spooked, stomping and swerving, shaking its head.

Francesc insight - why was the rider gunning it to leave others behind? - 25. The one in front of the caravan turns into the caravan and seems to be taking a very deferential tone. **There is someone important inside**.

Initiative (noting Thorin and Francesc have already had their turns and started them in range of Penny)

* Francesc 11
* Penny 13
* Thorin 23
* Arturo 26 -> swaps with Penny; he's hesitant, his spells are hampered

So:

* Penny 26
* Thorin 23
* Arturo 13
* Francesc 11

Penny starts running towards the caravan and ends up more or less alongside Thorin. She tries Sacred Flame... Will it work?! Religion, 4+14 -> 18. She tries to connect to Meliki, but it's low level magic; not so hard, she hopes... She can target the driver on the wagon themselves. It must be coming from her now, her self-belief, since Meliki is *not* here. Her belief is enough. They don't make their save - 18 vs DEX 19 - but it comes down as *fire*, not radiance, 15 damage taken. That's gorier than she expected. But it is *BRIGHT* in the midst of the night - and it lights up *everything*. That gets a lot of attention. The driver's clothes are on fire! They decide that self-preservation is more important than whoever the VIP in the back is. They start rolling around in the sand to put out the fire.

The out-of-control wagon goes over Thorin's bump. The reptile jumps over the hole, but the carriage wheels go right down into it, which causes it to tilt heavily front-down, back-up, causing the contents to almost jet out of the front, including a strange, ceramic - pod? Egg? It cracks as it strikes the front edge of the caravan. Inside it sits a child! They are dressed in rich clothes and have a shared head. It seems this "egg" was a sort of egg-shaped *chair* with a hole in front.

Arturo is looking back at the crashed 2nd and 3rd caravans and things backing up behind that. He casts Telekenesis, L5, with *5* sorcery points so it's *actually* a L5 spell without destroying the land around. He uses the spell to lift the rolled second caravan and move it out of the way of the main stream, lying it on its side. In the process of this, we see it is full of cages with people inside.

The Thri-Kreen are chasing down the sand dunes now.

Penny is 20ft away from the crashed 1st caravan. She runs up and tries to grapple the child. As she approaches, the child looks at her with pale green eyes. They wear what looks almost like monk robes; gender is hard to guess; they look *almost* human, but maybe dwarven perhaps? - maybe 10 years old if human. She says in Common, "Come with me if you want to live!" - but the child holds up both hands, and a strange wave of radiance emanates out from them and a force pushes back.

Penny ATHL 7+8 -> 15. It's not enough! The child holds her at bay. Penny notices odd details in this moment; stubby fingers; almost, stocky; the light of this strange shield comes from their hands in strands. It's definitely radiant, too. Curiously, Penny saw a recognition of what she said, despite it being in Common; yet it didn't react otherwise.

"Enough of this", she thinks; "let's get their attention!"

Penny casts Create Water. She is trying for the 30-foot cube option, but doesn't think that it'll be that big - hope not! - at least the spell fires; religion **29**; instead, she gets a cooling mist! But the mist coalesces *on* the shield from the child - it seems to have physical manifestation - and it runs down, making the sand below wet. Thorin perception 29 - doesn't know whether to laugh or cry at this bizarre spectacle! - but surrounding the child he sees scrolls, in that 'egg seat'. The child also appears to have a gourd with them, dried out, with a red silk rope tied to the top, hanging from the belt. It looked like it was full of water but has leaked. It looks ceremonial, though, not functional. Weird. And Thorin sees a *dwarven* child, but with strange proportions, some human-like.

Thorin thinks the child looks *determined*. They will defend themselves. They seem used to being attacked. They stands their ground. So he chooses to Moonlight Step behind and try and grapple, using the element of surprise. ADV unarmed strike; 23; grappled. The child struggles with surprising strength; it is *very* strong but Thorin manages to keep a hold. He says - also in Common *and* Druidic just in case - "I promise we won't hurt you!" - no response to Druidic but after Common, *in his head*, "then let me go if you do not wish me harm".

Thorin lets go. It's a show of good faith. "Don't run, please."

The child stands; the shield drops. Penny looks confused at not hearing part of what Thorin "heard", but she heard what Thorin said and does not advance. It reaches out its hands and the scrolls levitate to it. They look to the caravan and say, "The chaos beings have found us". The way that's said is strange, as if the *general chaos behind* is a sort of manifestation of a single entity; a being; an enemy; as if they are the opposite of that. Order, not chaos.

Thorin is confused. "Why were you in this caravan?!"

"I was being transported to another sanctuary and hiding place. I am being hunted."

This caravan has nothing to do with the others! It wasn't a VIP, it was a deal; hide in the rest of the caravan, safety in numbers.

Arturo doesn't know what's going on; he can see this kid and a conversation; it doesn't make sense - he holds his turn. He holds the telekinesis on the cages. Francesc sees that plenty of fighting is still going on and focuses on guards around those same cages. 22 to hit one of the guards - 9 damage - 25 to hit the same guard - 15 damage; the guard falls from their strange "raptor" mount, which immediately bolts in fear. It seems that the various creatures in this caravan are only loosely controlled and, given a chance, run for freedom.

(End of act 2, part 17)
