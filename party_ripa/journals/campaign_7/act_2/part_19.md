# RIPA: Act 2 Part 19
## Session 65 (2025-05-20)
### Athas desert ruins (Outlands relative day 19)

We hide in an encampment made within mostly-buried ruins, within dunes adjacent to the trade route between once-port city Gulg and the capital city, Tyr. We have with us some 30 rescued elves, now furnished with scrappy armour and simple weapons. Present also is the "rescued" Mul child - rumoured to be the child of two Mul, something which is meant to be impossible - who is certainly very powerful, if nothing else. We now suspect that this child had plans to disrupt things at Tyr as they had apparently allowed themselves to be captured deliberately and said we had "ruined" their plan when we freed them.

When we were cloud-flying to look for caravans on this route, we spotted two columns of dust, that seemed about halfway between the two great cities. We stopped the one closer to Gulg so the other one, which was ahead of it, is none the wiser; but we warned by the Thri-Kreen that it's likely another one will be through this way in maybe 10 hours, give or take. That's not far off how long it's been since we started making the camp and rested, but we figure we might actually have longer than that; surely, the other caravan wouldn't set out from Gulg until the evening.

Over-day was watch. We stick to our nightvision-based ordering:

* Arturo 18
* Thorin 2
* Francesc helps Penny 11
* Francesc 15

On Penny's watch, near the start, the child wakes up. It speaks using telepathy. It doesn't seem to know who we are. Penny reminds them about the caravan and the battle. It works; they calm down a bit; realisation. It seemed like an instinctive reaction. She asks what the child's "missing" was, explaining a bit about why we're here. WIS save 25 - the child is asking if she (we) are the ones they're meant to meet? But we aren't. And now the child seems unsure. The driver knew who they should meet. We don't. Penny conveys remorse; the child doesn't seem to. It's thinking about options. Go back to Gulg? Then, he says:

"You are human. There is another young human."

"Where? Or - who?"

"The one I spoke to. The one with the... Abilities."

"Ah, he is called Arturo. I am Penny."

"I see. I am called **Mynos**. You - the two of you - could still bring me to Tyr. You would be believable. The dwarf and the elf, no. Are we staying here?"

"We move at nightfall."

"Are those your slaves?"

"They are free, but they will move with us. Do you need them to be part of your... Deception?"

No answer, but then, "If we are staying here until night, I will go back to sleep."

And so, evening falls. Maybe another hour until we could move. Everyone's awake.

Penny brings the other three up to speed. Arturo asks the child about dwarves and why they stand out. He learns this child was 'born' only 2 months ago, "but apparently I have been alive longer? This body appears to be like that of a child, a few years old. I'm told I am the only one."

"Why is your mind... Fresh?"

"I was awakened. I have no memories of who I was before that."

He had been hidden; he was told that he was born, helpless and a "pointless creature" (describing the physical characteristics of a baby!) - apparently that never happens to Mul; they're created full-grown and are "useful" immediately. There's no prophecy and he isn't sure who awakened him. Arturo asks what his mission is; it's not to destroy the city?

"No. I am to meet the others in the city. We are to reshape the world."

"How? What will the new shape be?!"

"I have this recurring dream that I can *will* things to be different. I can change the world around me, so that it *is* different and possibly has always been different."

"Do you have a plan for making that dream a reality?"

"I need to get into Tyr. I need to confront those who are responsible for doing this to my people."

The child is worried that if they destroy those who make Mul, there will be no more Mul! Mul once awakened become aware of the bad lot in life. But he was born - he is told - though his mother died in childbirth. They need to know how that worked, so the Mul won't die out *and* they can be free. This is why he wants to recreate reality! Make is so that Mul were always born naturally, and free.

He says, "We *know* that's the only way that we can survive as a free people".

Arturo of course argues that, instead, maybe find out about the "true" birth? A lot safer than something akin to a Wish spell rewriting the world with who-knows-what side effects. Persuasion 17. He's thinking about it, but not convinced.

This is a verbal conversation. The rest of us hold back; Arturo's line of questioning is good and is getting results. At this point our insight largely fails us except for Thorin - insight high enough (19) to realise that this *is a child* in experience. They think in a childlike way, but learn *very* quickly. This gives Arturo the edge, albeit because he knows he can manipulate a child a bit! Persuasion is now 22.

He tries to argue that whoever taught the child about the "only way" was taking advantage of the childlike nature. The child is a quick study though and says, "But then how do I know that *you* are not doing the same?"

"Well you can read my mind and..."

...WIS save. 20. He opens up and the child is able to realise that Arturo *is not* being deceptive, even though he is certainly working on an agenda of his own. He manages to make his point.

Why are we here then? Why save everyone? "We want the rod!" says Penny. "What rod?" - Arturo explains that we want to take the king down. Yes, because he has something we want, but also *because it's right* (and that's why we rescued the slaves).

"What are your intentions for this world? It sounds like you have a methodical, deliberate plan to disrupt the way this world operates. I have my own reasons, stemming from fear and vengeance and hatred!"

Arturo tries to explain, prompting a question, "Are *you* The Chaos?" Again, verbally capitalised.

We ask for clarification.

"Before there was this world of dunes and deserts and dragon gods, there was chaos. There was a free and chaotic and inexplicable and unexplainable and uncontrollable world, where everyone did what they wanted. On the one hand, groups of people worship the chaos because they want the chaos back. Other are more moderate, thinking that unleashing it could destroy everything. That group tends to be more privileged, though."

Thorin tries to explain where we come from. Arturo pitches in too. Yes, there's chaos, but there is an equilibrium too.

"I have been told that I am the other side of the coin from the God King. Not because I am the Chaos, but because I am a force of control and power, or so I have been told. I can remake reality in what I wish. If I were to meet the God King, we would cancel each other out. I don't want to go up against him - I just want to rewrite reality around him. If your intention is to confront the God King, then I can only go with you so far."

Penny, Arturo - religion checks > 20 - the abilities of this child are not arcane, nor psionic. Innate... Or rather, remarkably like a divine ability. Not channelling it. They have a divine power *themselves*. A demigod?

The conversation gets back on track. Dwarves. Dwarves do not travel between cities. They're a favoured second race, who've worked out something with the Templars and Sorcerer Kings that they will assist in the subjugation and oppression of all the other races, in return for being the least oppressed of all.

We get into plans.

* If we could get to Tyr and teleport Thorin inside the walls, he could come *out* to "meet the caravan he's expecting".
* Except we need to ride the caravan into town pulled by beast(s) and unless we can find some of *those* then Thorin would have to be wildshaped the whole idea. Well, we can do that. Scratch that first plan.
* At the city we need to meet the people the kid was going to meet, and we kinda need to train up the ex-slaves. Could we get everyone together?
* To anyone "in the know" the child is clearly Mul - and a child, so that would cause immediate alarm.

We float the idea with more people. There's a constant vigilant watch against the use of magic in the cities so an illusion spell would be spotted immediately. We don't know if that's Detect Magic or True Sight though. If the latter, Thorin's wildshape would be spotted.

It starts to get late. The sun is down. Looks like we'll have to make this up as we travel... We need to right the wagon from the slaves, get everyone in there and get going. But we'll need to set camp once the sun is getting close to rising and we're some 3 days away from Tyr, so how are we going to stop them overheating?

Well, we could take the elves back to the village we know. But that's a few days backwards again! And Thorin can write a secret message only druids can read, to help convince them.

Francesc offers to lead them. The ex-slaves are confident they can find shelter, and Francesc takes the ever-trickling water bottle - keep that in rotation the whole time and it's enough.

**"It's not goodbye", she says. "I will see you in Tyr."**

The large group heads away, back into the interior of the desert. Arturo and Penny team up using Mending to repair the least-damaged carriage - at the front, as it happens. Arturo doesn't want to burn L1, so Penny does the casting (Religion 32 - it works fine). Thorin spots the ceramic "egg", broken cleanly, and we decide to Mend that too. She grows ever-more confident. **Somehow, the power is within her**.

We're all set. Thorin is up for changing into one of the giant lizards he saw. Penny takes point. Survival - Thorin 17, Penny 15. At least we have a *rough* idea of the direction from when we cloud-flew. Thorin has convinced Penny she must ride the lizard because that's how the lizards always are run. Penny's just glad Francesc isn't here. Arturo sits as the driver. We take anything that'll fit in the wagon and not already taken - whichever caravan ends up following next will see the obvious battle signs but then also note that one wagon eventually went away. And nobody in this world would ever leave anything useful behind.

Arturo's eyes are keen and we make extremely good time, compared to a normal caravan. CON saves for Thorin-lizard are very high, from the natural constitution of the creature, Penny's aura and so-on. We move *all night*. Not a single stop. It uses two Wildshapes, but we keep going for 11 hours.

### Athas desert, heading for Tyr (Outlands relative day 20)

We stop more because of finding an excellent rock outcrop that could be a shelter, than for sake of being tired - plus maybe some vegetation; smoke; campfires... Somehow, we have caught up with the caravan in front of us!

We're worried about meeting them but it would seem natural. Penny's armour can be used as a story; we took down one of the attackers & made the most of it.

(The child detects other people, but we reassure them. They must be bored so Thorin gives them The Elf That Barely Helped - but they can't read! Lucky them. Unfortunately for them, though, Penny has a bright idea; connect mentally (WIS save 24) and read the book herself. It's a rough "connection", but it works and in just *moments* this child learns to read.)

Arturo talks his way into the group. They speak a rough Common, which he hand-waves as us from being in another part of the city ("What, from the East are you? Oh, the North? Yeah, we're far South" - is the vibe). Deception with Tides of Chaos - nat 20! He expertly dodges every question and responds with something that sounds like an answer but isn't.

Penny, who has had to ride on Thorin-lizard all day, can at least take some comfort in Thorin having to say in lizard form and keep burning Wildshapes over-day. While the rest of us chat, he's led over to a makeshift pen where the other lizards are being kept...

...But Thorin has a plan. Talking to the other lizards, he convinces them to take our cart themselves. Basically - volunteer to be stolen! He offers food and water in bribes - they're quite angry at having none of that. He has one more wildshape before sleeping, so just turns into a moth (aping the Familiar he cast before) and flies into the back of our caravan.

Arturo convinces Penny to join the campfire of the group and try to get information. Between them, persuasion 21 and only 12 for deception.

* There are only two entrances to the city but only one from the Gulg side
* Going around from one to the other could add an extra hour
* They don't really know about the other gate - whether it's any easier or not
* They interpret our questions as an attempt to "evade taxes" at the city boundaries
* They stay in the trade area and never venture deeper - Gulgans are considered kinda low-life mercantiles by residents of Tyr, very arrogant, high & mighty, etc. etc.

**...and mechanistically, we gain advantage on Survival checks in Tyr if we need to find things or hide within the trade area.**

A further series of gates go into the inner city. Only one person speaks up about that, describing it as "obscene" - "they eat even when they are not hungry!" - more slaves than they need, water wasted, green palms everywhere.

Some of them start to retire, others get more drunk and deeper into conversation. We don't push our luck. We get back to the caravan and are surprised to see Thorin there. Other tents, Penny notes, have set up strange contraptions - INT check 21 - moisture collectors. A small amount must condense. She checks to see if we have such a contraption - investigation 23 - *no*, we didn't know what they were and never brought any with us. We'll have to make do with what we've got.

Watch has to be stretched over 3 hour periods.

* Arturo 13
* Thorin 21
* Penny 20+2 -> 22

Arturo is half-asleep when Thorin takes over but there's nothing to worry about. Other caravans are present. Lots of eyes. The other caravans aren't all watching, though; some drank themselves to oblivion beside the fire and are dragged inside when the sun comes up, others stay hidden in their shelter.

In the evening, we don't hang around - because Thorin has warned us about the lizard shenanigans. The lizards are up for it - when Thorin gives the signal he'd told them about in lizard form, they ask if he would mind untying them - insight 18 - they *hate* being captives and being forced to tow. But one has definitely agreed to tow. Thorin asks if they'll wait until we're clear, at least; they say they'll wait until we've gone a short way but then run. He agrees! He unties them.

The sun hasn't fully set and it's warm, but cooling.

Penny fetches the lizard - animal handling 18, it seems to be convinced that she's the right one - *all* the other lizards watch Penny depart, with an air of anticipation! - and we head off. We've actually gone a fair way before we start hearing commotion from the distance behind us!

Penny, Survival 16. Giving the lizard food and water is an easy win to convince the lizard to keep to what it said to Thorin.

### Athas desert, heading for Tyr (Outlands relative day 21)

At around 3am, we can see the lights of Tyr. CON save Penny 25, lizard 22 - we keep going and push on. Talking it over with Thorin, we figure him using Misty Step into a line-of-sight position only 30ft from the caravan is too risky. A strong chance of his appearance or spell casting being discovered. He elects to turn into a moth form instead and fly in - we just have to hope it's Detect Magic, not True Sight!

He flies in early, arriving some 20 mins ahead of us at the gate. There are guards, but also some kind of - inspector? A cloak, high collar. The hold a rod - not a staff - and wear eyeglasses that they use in some kind of magical way with the rod. They're sort of *scanning* the caravans around the outside somehow. Must be trying to detect *something* magical.

Emboldened by non-detection, he heads over the wall. No dwarves are visible dressed as officials here, but one dwarven couple on the other side of the wall in the main courtyard area that look like they're waiting for something. Another caravan presumably. They're dressed well, as Athas goes, with a lot of jewellery but it seems to be all made of polished stone of varying kinds. The male dwarf has a nose piercing with a small metal stud. They must be very wealthy!

Our own Athas garb is more - rustic, of course. "Dark Sun". They don't. But Thorin does have the Bag of Holding. So - stone jewellery, discrete but tiny amounts of metal and wool clothing. He finds a quiet corner, wildshapes back and mimics the dress style using the bag (but omits jewellery as ours is all made with metal and gems, not stone).

He moves over to across the gate from the other two. They notice him immediately, trying to judge who he might be, his level of wealth; about what Thorin expected.

The commercial aspect is as expected. Inns, taverns, stores, stables. Lots of guards. There's a guardhouse just inside the gate with maybe 6 guards therein.

Meanwhile, the caravan approaches the gate. Nobody else is in the queue. A guard holds up a hand to make us stop. We hear a strong Tyr accent of Common: "Stop. Where have you come from?"

"Gulg"

"Do you have papers?"

"We were attacked on the road. We lost them."

"If I had a stone chip for every time someone gave me that excuse..." - Arturo insight; is he asking for a bribe - his insight doesn't help much; Penny 21; a throw-away comment but also a veiled hint. Now would be a good time to give a stone chip. Fortunately we looted some at the attack site! D6 and D100 -> we have **6 whole stone coins with a small hole in the middle and 33 chips**; it looks like the coins can break into 10 chips. She gives Arturo the eye; he throws the guard a whole coin.

"...Happens all the time, you know. They need to do a much better job with these records!"

We get waved on. But now we're being "scanned". When the person gets to Arturo they ask what his - well, the word is difficult. Guild? Profession? Or even... Family? There is a tone of suspicion. The caravan we met didn't mention anything like this at all.

Insight 22. They detected a magic item. We must've missed someone... He thinks fast. "My client wouldn't appreciate any delays. What I carry is their business!" - ADV (since it was a good idea) Deception, still needs Tides Of Chaos to get a solid deception roll, but it works.

On the way in, Penny atop the lizard spots Thorin. Thorin sees that the other two dwarves are looking frustrated... And Arturo starts to walk towards them as if to talk. They seem very surprised! After all he's in his desert kit. They almost begin to back away, until at the last minute, the male dwarf steps in front of the female. "Halt! Why are you approaching us?!"

"I don't mean to alarm you. We're here to meet someone on behalf of the child Mynos."

"Are we meant to know who this child is?! We have no dealings with a Mynos!" - Arturo insight 14 - seems legit.

He pushes his luck and tries to barter with them for information about any other caravans, saying he has information about the delayed one behind us. But they're mostly just annoyed. A shipment of slaves should've arrived yesterday... They're already paid for. He tells them that the caravan was attacked - that was *our* caravan - and the slaves were killed or escaped. (DM roll) They believe him and they're both very annoyed. The female dwarf storms off; the male presses a couple of stone chips into Arturo's hand and walks off too!

Thorin has been watching all this with some bemusement, but he's watching to see if anyone else might be approaching. Perception 18. *Lots* of people are busybodies! They're listening to Arturo's "debate" while pretending not to. A few people are stood around with boards with names of trading houses on, presumably for specific trading houses awaiting caravans. He storms up to one, feigning irritation, asking if anyone is waiting for *his* caravan - the one from yesterday - but it doesn't get much traction. Arturo is meanwhile asking about Mynos and so-on.

Suddenly Arturo takes 1 piercing damage. A stone hits him on the side of the head!

Penny, perception 18 from up on the lizard, had been looking at the religions iconography - it's everywhere - a dragon wearing a mitre, with a sceptre that has a crystal at the top, with dragon wings outstretched. Then she sees a flash of grey speeding through the air and sees Arturo hold the side of his head. It came from a darker area in an alleyway where she can't see anyone. She can't do much from here but keeps watch. She sees Arturo get yanked into the alleyway.

He sees a face peering up at him - someone about 5ft tall - no eyebrows, no hair. They have a sort of hat attached to a shirt, a structured hood of sorts. "Why are you - you are not - you are not the person we're supposed to meet! Why are you throwing Mynos' name around! Stick to the plan!"

"What's the plan?"

"Check in to the inn!"

"What? What inn?"

"Have you - have you lost the plan?!"

"...Yes! Completely!"

(He mutters, "Why do we trust humans?!") - "Go the inn of the Desert Fox. Check in and meet in the bar downstairs. Once everything has shut, just before the first rays. We will meet you there. Keep him out of sight! Understand. It is extremely important that he is not seen!"

They slink away into the shadows.

We're still there, in the middle of the main area. Not moving. At least it's a quiet day. A couple of people have come to us to hold up their signs! After a while she gives a quick summary of the stuff in the caravan. "Yours? Want to buy it?" - persuasion (burning inspo) 17. One of them seems to shrug and decide maybe today isn't a total loss! They get a list out and start asking if we have X, Y or Z. Soon enough others clock it and a bidding war starts! Arturo gets back to the caravan and encourages it. Persuasion 27!

We don't let people inside but we do take things inside, out, for them to look at. Mynos is confused about what's going on but we do our best to mentally explain. Arturo lets him know that we made contact with "his people" and he seems very happy with that.

This unexpected fire sale; the alcohol, perfume, some basic trade goods like stone carvings and so-on... We end up completely clearing the scavenged goods and we make a huge amount. It's the equivalent of 98 platinum - stone tablet pieces worth ten of the coins.

Well now we certainly have money for stables! And a person from the stables has seen that too, hurries over and starts faux-fussing over us to help us "park the lizard" and caravan. They seem unsure about what we want; Penny points to the lizard - "that needs to be fed well and watered well" - and Arturo adds, "And take us to the nice part of town!"

We have to wait for everyone nearby to leave before we bundle up the egg and Mynos with clothes or tarp and treat it as just a "bundle of stuff" that nobody can see. Meanwhile, Arturo negotiates sale of the wagon itself; he's decided we surely don't need it. They're surprised given we want to lizard looked after but shrug it off... It's expensive... 10 chips a day. They say it as if we might negotiate. Penny feigns wincing about and grumbles, negotiating over-day instead of more than one night, since Arturo has the idea that we can set it free tomorrow. (When we have privacy, Thorin is asked to tell the lizard about that. In the mean time, it has good lodgings!)

We can rent a kind of rickshaw for our "belongings", 2 chips, Arturo wants to negotiate - as if our patience after the 10 chips for the lizard is running thin; Penny helping; 22 persuasion - yeah, we get it gratis. Just for over-day anyway.

The Desert Fox is apparently well-known and we get there easily. It's a well-known inn, at least, for those who had a good trade. More upmarket apparently. The impression is, "something to treat yourself with".

Thorin has meanwhile been hanging around under the guise of complaining to anyone who will listen about his "missing shipment" the eventually feigns the idea that we (the rest of his party) are what remains of his shipment so "goes to find us" - and so we regroup, heading to the Desert Fox. While Arturo and Penny thought they'd done a decent job of disguising the egg, to Thorin's eyes it is *very* obvious!

The proprietor sees a dwarf and two ragged people so assumes he's in charge immediately. He ends up getting a 1gp-equiv for himself, 2sp-equiv for Arturo and Penny to share, just for one night; we get food too - 19 chips total. "For one chip more I will throw in a bath for you, sir!" - just for Thorin!

Inevitably the room standards are quite different! But even the 2sp room is serviceable. No bathroom though. Thorin's room has one, so we put the egg there so the kid can use a bathroom. We're supposed to stay here until first light; in the end we congregate in the dining room. And here, food seems plentiful. There's a bar area at the far end. Arturo's plan is to buy a round for everyone, to distract from the late hour... This allows us to take a while with our drinks, say "hey just lock up when you're done, we're fine, we'll go once we're finished..."

Noise outside peaks - pre-bed activity - then it goes quiet. A little bit of light starts to filter in from around curtains.

Perception: Penny, 21. Thorin 11. Penny notices the way things go so quiet, but then she notices a sort of fully *dead* quiet - as if it were a Silence spell, but it's not actually magic. The air feels heavy. Some sort of privacy zone?

Two hairless Mul appear from the kitchen. One is clearly concentrating. So that's the one making this - effect happen.

One takes a chair, grabs a brandy, looks at it, looks unimpressed and puts it down.

"Right. Explain yourselves!"

(End of act 2, part 19)
