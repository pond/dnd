# RIPA: Act 2 Part 34
## Session 80 (2026-01-06)
### Campaign day 33

We are on Oerth, in a temple where lich Acererak is believed to reside. Through Heroes Feast we have avoided fear effects and poison and found our way to a first lower level through a small, hidden tunnel - only to discover a camp, that shows signs of very recent occupation.

We investigate the site. Investigation Urth/Flurth: 32, Thorin perception: 15, Penny 21.

* The fire has only been extinguished recently, burning down naturally; within a day
* Bedrolls are cool, so not recently slept in
* Two bedrolls are out, but there are two more rolled up and there's lots of stuff around the tent
* There's also bedding in the tent but with an implication that someone "more important" sleeps there. Five people? Maybe six as two could fit in the tent?
* Unwashed cookware, which means - ate recently, but didn't get back
* A mat has incense and discarded augury bits and pieces - a cleric, or diviner of some kind
* This looks like a base of operation for quite some time
* There's a hand-drawn map but incomplete; could be useful, but a bit hard to read

There's a barrier effect; a kind of shimmer; from the tent side, it looks like the space is larger and darker than it really is; once we step through, we sense differences. There's a soft glow of illumination we can't explain and *something* different we can't quite explain. Thorin ARC 15, Penny 20. There's a persistent magical effect - some kind of suppression field preventing teleportation in or out of the area. Plane shifting seems impossible too. (Fl)Urth think that the spell must be at least (!) L9. The only exit seems to be a sense of life-force being drawn away! But on the "tent side" of this strange barrier, none of that is present.

The magic is layered, too, like an onion skin. It feels like we would step through increasing layers of this magic if we moved forward. But Urth thinks it wouldn't disintegrate/dispel Flurth. In fact it's got more negative effects on living things.

Francesc asks if anyone remembers anything about the rod piece? Penny (HIS 20+4) - it's a "great illusion, all encompassing" - so that tracks! It means we can't trust our eyes.

After a brief discussion, we elect towards an area marked as a "spike pit" because it seems to be marked on the hand-drawn map as having a possible way further on. But Thorin sees trees to a room on the right!  Penny checks and from just outside - no trees. She inches in, along with Francesc - **DEX saves!** Nat 20+5 -> Penny, Francesc 30. A cascade of arrows fire from the corner of the room to the entrance. Some 60 bolts! We take 27 -> 13 piercing. Francesc holds the Find The Path spell from the rod.

Thorin meanwhile checks a room marked as fire. A flagstone at the doorway drops if stepped on and triggers the trap. He may be able to jump over it though. He tries pressing on the flagstone with Mage Hand... A metal door slams down over the entrance and there's the sound of an _explosion_ behind the door!

Francesc notes a way to go along a wall to avoid the floor traps. She climbs up on the wall and wall-walks to where the map claimed there might be a way to disable the trap. And with her thieve's tools - she does! There's a door at the end, which Penny confirms *is* real. Penny tries to open it, with people  stood back; ATHL 22; it does *not budge*. Urth PER nat 20 - in Common, it seems to be written above, *as* the pulling happens - text appears; "Acererak commends you. Alas, these doors lead nowhere. But your skill should not go unrewarded. Should you wish to plumb the depths of my tomb and plunder its treasures, heed these words - the Blue (One/Devil) craves your magic, to devour it."

The steel door on the 'fire' room won't reopen. So that's that. Spike room it is.

Urth/Flurth cross the threshold. This hallway seems to have been partly excavated, as if there used to be flagstones above the spikes to hide them. Various planks are balanced across the middle. Thorin, perception 26; the map indicates that the drawer "swears they saw something here" - and *he* spots an opening. Hmm. Spike pit, opening; haven't we already done this?! Those with Darkvision see the crazy huge 10ft high mosaic of a Blue Devil face with gaping mouth which is a huge black void.

Penny wonders if "feeding" it with a ranged spell would work (she lacks such spells); but meanwhile Francesc wall-runs to the far side and finds a door there, too. Flurth runs across the planks; Urth is right behind and almost falls, but Flurth grabs him just in time. Francesc is following Find The Path; the door she just found by the statue/mosaic is a fastest path - *but* also so is the hole in the ground.

Penny suggests a summoned creature; to crawl through either way and see what it sees. So Thorin uses Find Familiar and summons a lizard. He sends it to the spike pit entrance since Penny is concerned that the door by the statue might be a trap, given the "magic eating" warning-or-hint-we-don't-know-which.

The darkvision-enabled lizard sees a cavern. Very shallow breathing can be heard. It can see someone lying on the ground, looking incapacitated. The lizard notices the the ground is covered in sort of strange steel planks, that seem magical but it's not too clear what they're for. It advances. The person on the ground looks female, with ragged and shallow breathing. She's in a circle of some kind of runes or text. Nearby, seven large casks in a row are spaced evenly along one wall; in another corner there are several others of different sizes, not in any ordered array. PER 26. The person is clearly in trouble but, more importantly, there's an entire floor - an *empty* floor - below the planks. But between the planks the gaps are very tiny. The lizard can't see below. There's another floor 'below'.

Penny is willing to go in there and investigate. But the others are interested in the door that's by the mosaic. It doesn't seem to have handles! Thorin tries sending a Starry Wisp into the "mouth" of the moasic - attack 23 - dead centre. The eyes of the mosaic light up briefly, but then fade. At the same time the outline of the door does the same.

But first - is that door even real? Penny decides to run across - but ATHL 12 - she lands in the pit! DEX save, nat 1+5 -> 6 -> 10 piercing damage. Ooops. "I'm... Fine?" she says; Urth and Flurth climb down on her shoulders. They move through the tunnel - Thorin decides to cross over and check out the door by the mosaic, but he falls in too! DEX save 11 -> 13 damage. He's sure it's Penny's fault for breaking the planks. Francesc shrugs; "I guess this is what we're doing then?!" and, abandoning the big mosaic, follows.

Penny is looking at the person on the ground, keeping outside the rune circle. She looks over her shoulder to see everyone has followed her! "What the fuck?!" *"You broke the planks!"* says Thorin.

A flambouyantly dressed lady lies in the circle. She's holding a flask she'd just drunk out of; some liquid has spilled on the ground from it. It's red. Doesn't look like a healing potion. Not wine either. Not blood! But then we look at those seven evenly-spaced canisters or barrels. Each has a different symbol in a different colour. There are numerous mugs and cups on shelves all over.

Urth looks at the runes. He can't read it. In fact, none of us can. Thorin decides to examine the body. He steps into the circle! The person has drunk a paralytic poison and are paralysed. Penny can cure poison and stepping into the circle seems safe. So she does so! The woman wakes up. She's not surprised, having been hearing us the whole time; she's **Laysa Matulin**. The circle is some kind of riddle. She came with three other people - a wizard Marion, their guide; she's gone ahead. She tells us that the door by the devil mosaic opens a door with L6 spell levels, a skeleton trap, a hallway of gems, a confusing room... And more. There were some kinds of portal and she went through 'the wrong one'. They don't know where Marion went. Two priests - **Vogren** and **Taio** - went through another, together, and also vanished.

She claims to be of the original people of the island and wants treasures of significance to her. Acererak took relics and placed them in the tomb as an enticement. But of course the *whole* place is a trap, to capture and kill people - adventurers - to feed on their souls.

The ring is apparently written in Celestial. And the relics she wants? 6 sacred items representing the soul of her culture.

* The Wand of Ebony, decorated with bones and feathers; contains a piece of their primordial spirits
* The Ring of Golden Stars, forged in the earliest days and given to the first Seer
* The Scared Scimitar of the Defenders, dedicated to the serpent spirits who defend the island from invaders
* The Crystal Orb of Communion which connects all of them with their ancestors
* The Ceremonial Priestly Sash of Blue Silk
* The hidden secrets of our most holy and purest of body, engraved in incantations onto a set of copper tablets, bound by silver

OK, we're on board! But she can't come with us. She's drunk a lot of these poisons! It's a riddle. The circle says;

"A septet of Libations I present to you. but only one will help you escape the tomb. Six drinks are magic, one is mundane, those marked with stars are vitality's bane; blue neither blessing nor curse; moon cleanses you of illness or worse, green's neighbour is never boring, drink deep and pass through the flooring. She's drunk one of the red ones - red star. And for some reason she *started* with the green star, then the red one! She'd got green moon in a cup ready to go - but it acted too quickly.

She wants to get back to her camp. Urth/Flurth try to persuade her to come - 21 - she grudgingly agrees; she's injured; Penny, medicine 13, she counts as very bloodied; a Superior healing potion heals her for 29, but she's still bloodied. This is a very resilient individual. But she's also not promised to help us at all. Thorin / Francesc INS 32 - this person is important to her culture and religion and she cannot just throw her own life away. She intends to make good on her promises but doesn't have the means to pay us on her. Of course Francesc doesn't care about the reward; but this person is *good*.

Penny gets a green moon cup as a backup. Thorin drinks blue circle - and grows! He's 11ft tall. Francesc drinks green circle and starts hacking for a minute; it's just pure poison. Urth drinks red square and turns into a gaseous cloud! Penny hands the moon drink to Thorin, who shrinks to his normal size. He fills will Red Square and joins the cloud party! Laysa too - it'll help her get back to the camp. She departs.

Penny decides to try the Blue Square. She turns into a 3" version of herself. D4->4, it would be four hours but - "Francesc! Green moon!" she squeaks. Francesc obliges, begrudgingly. And now we all go Red Square, since gas clouds can squeeze through the floor gaps. The lizard has to stay behind! Thorin thanks and dismisses the Familiar.

There's a tunnel that leads away, leading to a portal. Penny turns back into Penny and Laysa into Laysa - advises others not to change as it's cramped - there's only *one* portal here. Laysa's group hit choices. Thorin wants to ask if Find The Path points this way; so he turns into himself; Francesc likewise; it's quite a squeeze! "Yes" she says and Thorin immediately walks through.

It's a foggy room; some kind of gas, which seems harmless, obscures view to the distance. He tries using elemental control to move the fog around and Penny confirms what he finds - the walls are just portal after portal. 8 in all. And this is the route Laysa took! From what she said, they had way more traps to reach here. But now - we don't know where very one went. We think that - hopefully! - the one we seemed to step through does lead back to the room we came from, meaning 7 more. But Francesc gets a clear reading from Find The Path to three portals, all kind of "feeling like" back the way we came.

Francesc INS nat 32 - the first one she got a reading on "feels" the safest. We trust her; Thorin strides through. And it's just a door! Not even a portal! But Laysa recognises that this is the way they came *in*. In theory the traps here are disarmed. Well, we test out a theory she mentioned. Penny goes along a short way following Laysa's instructions and all is as she describes. Yet when Francesc tries Find The Path, it points both back to the portal room, *and* ahead, to the way she'd come; so we think this *will* surely lead back to the mosaic room. But as we travel on, we reach a wall. And from Laysa's perspective, though, this was a *door* when travelled in the other direction. Urth/Flurth investigate. He feels around - and his hands fall right through! It's an illusion. Thorin suggests Penny perhaps leads, it's a tight corridor!

Behind the false door is a small room, octagonal, with a sculpture of a wave. At the top is a large emerald which we are warned to not touch - its presence disables the traps. Without it, there's an ice trap. Find The Path points along another corridor, then through a side door. Laysa never saw it. It's covered by various gems and distractions. "Do not touch any of the gems!" she says. "But the trap is disabled; maybe it's safe?!"

Penny tries to open the door. The gems aren't real! They're crystals, made to look like precious stones. She realises the door can be pushed open and does so. She moves forward cautiously; eventually it opens out into a strange walkway surrounded by an endless vortex of some kind. It feels infinite. And there's heavy wind buffeting. "Don't tell me" yells Penny over the noise - "Find The Path leads that way, does it?!" - Francesc confirms!

Laysa is unsure. She tells us where her village is. If we find any their relics we will be rewarded, but Francesc's vision showed only the "artefact" we are after and she's unwilling to proceed. It's just too dangerous. The door at the other end of the corridor leads to the mosaic room; that's close to camp; she departs, but not before granting Bardic Inspiration to Flurth!

With that, we wonder how to cross this perilous narrow crossing. Urth says to Flurth, "Crawl across that walkway!" - also casting Guidance. He starts to crawl. DEX save 23; he grips on as a sudden gust hits him; he *just* manages to hold on as a sort of 'sea spray' from the vortex, as if there were a giant wave, sprays over. Flurth is OK, but only by luck.

Penny wonders if there's a way to turn this off - like the emerald in the earlier room. Thorin tries to look (nat 1) nothing - Francesc, nat 20! - she says, "I honestly cannot see *anything* that would disable it. No mechanism or anything. Just voids."

Flurth presses on! Square by square, DEX save; nat 1 - with Bardic, a d10, the total is maximised to 17 - and that's enough. At this point Penny realises nobody ever gave him a rope, sigh...

Urth gives Flurth another Bardic. DEX save 15. Enough. *Just* makes it. Another Bardic, another square. 17. Makes it. Flurth considers jumping to the end, instead of crawling forward. Despite Thorin's protestations, he crawls forward a bit - *this* time with a rope tied - and gives Urth and Flurth *exchange* Bardic Inspirations. Flurth crawls forward a bit more, 19, so close! He can see the end. And that's enough - Urth and Flurth inch further forward and Flurth gets to safe ground. And now he tries investigates, takes a minute, Urth just hanging on; he elects to go back, using the rope - ADV DEX - he makes it.

Flurth now isn't as pressured to investigate. 21. There's a portal, but no other runes evident. Powerful, persistent magic in this room, It's magical except for the stone walkway. Detect Magic - this is *above* level 9. It's been created over many years and is permanent.

We concoct a plan. A rope is tied to Francesc; Penny holds the rope, Thorin holds Penny; Francesc tries to run on the *walls*, but the wind is still grabbing at her a lot. She's doing OK but it's clearly not easy. And then - she falls. Penny STR save 21; she holds on OK as **Francesc falls.** She tugs on the rope; only half the rope comes back. **Francesc is not there. The rope shows acid damage, as if eaten through by acid** - *that* is what was it the "wave".

Penny is over it. She's had it with Vecna, she's had it with all the people who have claimed to be giving us tasks but never enough information, tired of feeling like we're always being kept in the dark and *very* tired of this stupid puzzle box temple. Francesc is one of her oldest friends. Penny says, "Fuck it" and runs and jumps into the void.

She falls, shoved around this way and that by winds briefly, hearing screeching and screaming noises on the way; DEX save 8 (heroic inspo blown for a nat 1!) - she's bowled over by something as the hits a stone floor. Someone is yelling "no, it's coming for you!" - which gives her advantage; DEX save 21, she just manages to dodge. Some huge creature barrels past her. She's backed into a narrow, small corridor, pushed up against an injured tiefling. "You just appeared in the middle of the room?" "Where's the other one!" "On the other side of the room! But if you don't go near them, they don't hurt you!" "What about the elf?" "What elf?!" - and **Penny realises it's just the two of them here**.

Thorin and Urth think they should at least *try* to cross. Thorin can't use Misty Step; it's too far. Urth suggests that they rope up to help each other. Thorin inches forward with Urth in tow, with line-of-sight to Flurth; it's now within 30ft to the other side; he tries to use Moonlight Step, bringing Urth along. And that works! All three are at the portal; they feel they have no choice but to step through.

An old temple; beautiful, but ancient statues, including some of serpents - in line with what Laysa mentioned. The biggest has a serpent lower body, female upper body and has six arms all holding swords; one of the swords is real, not carved, in the highest-held sword in the left hand, which softly glows with moonlight; the head is made of snakes. There's a crown and ornate ringmail armour, all carved.

Penny finds out that this person she's with is the person who wrote the journal. She warns Penny not to go into the room behind her; if you do, the ceiling crashes down and crushes you. "Any other exits in the room with those big things running around?" - she saw one to the right wall and there are people, she's sure, over there.

So, she tries - "Oi, Francesc! Are you there?" - Marian joins in. No good. The room has a few pillars; she tries a flat dash to the middle. ATHL 10. She doesn't *quite* make it before one of the Things charges and hits her - 13 bludgeoning, STR save - 26 - she at least isn't knocked over.

Marian mentions a red gem on the strange granite Things that are rolling at her. ATHL 23, she manages it; the other smashes in - DEX save also 23, she holds her balance - she tries to smash the gem with the sunsword; 25 to hit, 27 damage. The gem is smashed wide open and the granite creature powers down. The other one is still grinding into the wreckage; she jumps onto the other, misses at the first swipe - two more swipes hit, though and the gem is smashed. Both of these odd granite guardians are disabled. Marian and Penny move to the side room. It's strangely calming! There's a beautiful fountain with clean water. Walls are covered in mosaics and frescoes.

Meanwhile, Thorin has seen the snake hair. REL 23. This is *not* a Medusa or Gorgon of any kind. It's much older. But as the two start to investigate the room, Thorin notices that this statue he's nearby is slowly turning into flesh! "Can we get the sword before it finishes changing?!" asks Urth. It's 8ft up. Thorin tries to grab it with Mage Hand. The spectral Hand gets a hold of the weapon, but it can't wrestle the weapon out of the statue's grip. He did, though, make contact - remote or otherwise - with intent to take.

Two large Spirit Nagas emerge and start to approach! And the statue wakes up. It looks down and speaks in Draconian, which Urth understands - just about, the dialect is obviously very old! - "Thieves! More *thieves*!" - Urth tries to respond, "We're here to take something stolen from us - we have no business with you - we were worried, we saw you and thought you had intent to attack; we were just trying to protect ourselves!" - Flurth tries to back it up; sadly, persuasion is only 13, Heroic Inspo burned; still only 13. That's sadly not enough. Thorin hastily steps in to try! He casts Tongues and tries to persuade. 18 - not as bad... The statue-creature pauses, and argues back. "I don't believe you. You say you're here to take something stolen from you, yet you're trying to steal something from those who worship *my* kind!" - and at this Urth realises that this is *the* scimitar! Laysa mentioned it - he describes her, that she's here and is trying to rescue the artefacts.

Flurth HIS 22 remembers what Laysa said and recounts the list of six items, almost managing to copy Laysa's voice in the process. As a result, ADV Persuasion, 18; not quite enough... Guidance d4->3, makes it 30, by DM permission. 21 total. The guardian holds up her hands. The Sprit Nagas stop moving, just on the verge of attacking.

"You say Laysa sends you. Will you sit and hear our sad tale, and tell it to those you meet?"

Urth the Bard says - "Sure!"

The next *hour* - accounting for a short rest - amounts to the full story from **Marilith**.

* Acererak came to the Isle of Serpents and presented him self as some kind of saviour against the rampaging Sauagin tribes that were attacking.
* They decided to make him their protector and granted him access to many sacred places.
* He took the Six Sacred Items from the Six Sacred Sites - and then cast a spell that **killed most of the population**, corrupted most of the land, enslaved the remaining people and turned this - their most holy site - into the Tomb Of Wayward Souls, sending false messages out to entice people to find those "treasures" hidden within this place.
* He managed to imprisoned the deity serpent representations of the ancient primordial gods and trapped them in this room. They cannot leave.
* There are other stories - a whole lot of other things happening in the tomb; they even learn the location of **some more of the artefacts** but nothing about the vault with the rod. Some previous adventurers reached here having found things before but never getting out.

Marilith *gives Urth the sword* hoping that it can be returned to Laysa and maybe even freeing the entities trapped here.

Meanwhile, Penny investigates the room with Blindsight and detects a hidden door. There are other exits, but hidden door -> seems good! She goes through. The room there is shrouded in maddening darkness... Intense fear... But she cannot be Frightened. Marian screams after her, "Do not go in there!" and Penny says, "Don't follow, I'll be back!"

In the middle of the room is a strange, black, obsidian pedestal. On top of the pedestal is a - well, a box. The moment she notices it, though, the room changes. She *sees* from normal vision an expanse of night sky with stars, stretching for miles. There's a hill with the pedestal and a puzzle box atop it. But with Blindsight, it's just a small room with the pedestal. She inches closer. There's a body on the ground; *Francesc*, unconscious. She goes to Francesc and drags her out of the room, to where Marian is. Medicine - only 11 - she succumbed to the effects. She's not *injured* per se, so Penny shakes her. "Wake up!"

Leaving Francesc with Marian, she investigates. Religion - 27 - nothing. Arcana 9! Nothing there. Just *looking* at it, no good. The shield can't help. Investigation, to try and figure out more; 15; a spring-loaded compartment just below the box's lid, trapped. She fetches tools from Francesc; SOH lucky 15+0. That's enough. It pops open. Numerous poison darts line the edges! Inside is a small jewel box, like a velvet ring box. Inside is a delicate gold ring, covered in engraved star designs. Ah! The **ring of golden stars!** - and she takes it, returning to relative safety.

Francesc and the others spend a while recovering. In the end, both of the two groups have had what amounts to a short rest and, eventually, it's time to press on.

(End of act 2, part 34)
