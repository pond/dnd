# RIPA: Act 2 Part 37
## Session 83 (2026-02-10)
### Campaign Day 34, Acererak's Tomb, Oerth

Progress through the tomb has been slow, but we've certainly picked up quite a few people along the way! Now we seem to be faced with, on the face of it, a simple old fashioned puzzle - a chamber containing a bridge of sorts that stretches between two voids. It is covered in large square tiles each with one of various glyphs on - maybe five or six different ones overall. It looks like a specific sequence should be stepped upon in order to gain safe passage across, or something along those lines.

Thorin starts looking around the walls at the chamber's entrance to see if there are any clues. He recognises these squares (small, about 2.5ft each side) as magical symbols; perhaps their magical meaning have some clue. E.g. healing ones might be safe. Penny squeezes in. Her Blindsight shows her that there is invisible writing there, but she can't *read* it. Penny has See Invisibility so she casts (L2).

"The vortex eats all magic, save for that from which it was born."

Penny isn't sure wht that vortex is (ARC 9), but Thorin (ARC 22) thinks it's an actual spell and so tries Detect Magic to figure out the school.

There is a *lot* of weird magic here. Some of it is going to suppress teleportation, flight and so-on - but it's designed as a trap, to nullify part-way across and drop people into the vortex. The vortex itself radiates both evocation and transmutation. It has been manifested out of raw magical energy, then changed - transmuted - into, presumably, its current form.

Well, Thorin can tell which squares on the bridge are for those two schools. But the vortex "eats" that magic. Perhaps throwing spells of that school into it might help? Or is it just a question of safe squares? Thorin uses Find Familiar and brings it onto the first orange square. No problem. Then he tries a diagonal red; OK. Now he deliberately tries a "wrong" one - the square vanishes and the familiar is ripped apart by the vortex at a fundamental level!

Thorin thinks it's solved! He goes orange-red (and Penny suggests a route which always alternates thus, which is available); and doing this, necessary or not, works. We all copy that, and get across safely - but end up in an unfortable squashed-up mess at the far end! It makes investigation difficult.

The room directly in front is shrouded in an illusory field of darkness but with Detect Magic still up, Thorin is just about able to spot a hidden door. It's not *invisible*; it's an illusory wall. Urth is squashed up closest and decides to go through the hidden door. He opens it; there's a short corridor which turns a right angle - and at that turn is a strange, glowing pit, almost like molten metal. He approaches cautiously INV 23. It doesn't feel warm... He touches it. An illusion!

Without telling anyone (!) he moves forward and ends up in some kind of laboratory, but it's too dark to see so he goes back and fetches the party. Once Thorin is there... He sees three large glass cylinders, each with a corpse inside buried almost up to the head in what looks like snow which has a strange red powder covering the top of it. He uses Elementalism and gets light going. Very strange magical experiments! These aren't magical right now, though.

Urth ADV Arcana (Arcana Magic caster) 23. It's a spell he doesn't know but it's within his (<= L8) capabilities... Simulacrum - but a corrupted form! An empowered one. The snow and red powder - powdered ruby - is familiar. But the corpse?! Is this trying to make copies of Acererak?

Urth is curious and moves to the desk to read the paperwork, but Thorin notices that there's a magical trap there. Urth INV 21 has noticed a drawer with a false bottom; he opens it, and that's when Thorin sees the trap very clearly! Since it's magical, Urth tries Dispel Magic; and he does well! 19+5 check -> 24, of course that works; it was a L7 disintegration trap.

Francesc tries to unlock it but (SOH 17) on the 1st attempt it doesn't unlock. That makes it a bit harder, as the lock gets a bit scratched each time. Urth adds Guidance. With a second attempt (D4->3) the SOH 21 matches the DC. It works! The drawer opens and inside is an ancient rose quartz crystal ball. **That's one of the artefacts**.

There are notes too but none of us can read them! Marian looks. **Penny suggests that Acererak is making copies of himself**. "Oh, definitely!" she says. "Can I have ten minutes to read these?!" - well, sure. Urth isn't sure if she's legit (INS 4); Penny INS 17 - Marian is annoyed she has to read them out (!) but she'll do so faithfully. Takes 15 mins rather than 10.

It's pretty fucked up. It's an Empowered Simalcrum, allowing him to create copies of himself to guard his tombs - plural - but he's develped these to be more powerful than normal and in fact, over time, **start to develop sentience and their own personalities**. We might find it hard to tell the real thing from a copy! There's some kind of strange set of crossed-out words in different languages below; one of them that is *not* crossed out is Draconic for "to die". Others are, "to rule" or "tyrant".

Thorin INS 21... He knows Dwarves that write down passwords, crossing out old ones. But we don't know what it's for! Penny asks Urth to say that word loudly. He takes that to heart! He uses Thaumaturgy and booms out the word. IT BOOMS FORTH! Dust settles... Silence... Nothing. He tries again. Then notes that they're all "three letter" (syllable) words in Draconic, old and new; so he tries a third time. Nope! Maybe we need a locked box with three Things involved somehow in future.

On the last page of the stack of notes, is a spell. Amounts to a scroll. **Planeshift**. Urth is keen! He reaches for it from Miriam. She's *not* keen. Intimidation check, passively; but Thaumaturgy gives him advantage - 22 - she relents.

One cylinder, the one in a darker corner, on closer examination looks *empty*; it has all the remnants. It seems like it's been used. Marian is confused... Penny explains that she thinks Acererak might have already set up a copy here and moved to the next tomb. **Marian is crestfallen - she realises Acererak is probably not even here and she's maybe wasted all of her choices and compromises she made here!**

Penny tries to console her, even Marian isn't exactly the best person... PER 15. Doesn't have much impact. But now we only know about that 'dark room' exit off the strange bridge. Penny leads the way; then Thorin, Urth, Guntach squeezes in and then Francesc checking the rear.

The room is strange. It almost feels like being underwater! But Blindsight tells her it isn't. Nothing from See Invisibility tho. Thorin's Detect Magic has expired. He takes a moment to get hold of himself - but he's also sure he's underwater! Then he see a giant shark swimming about, as if hunting. Penny sees no shark. Thorin could turn into a giant shark anyway, so he doesn't care! Penny advances slowly. Other people see the shark too. It circles around as if to attack Thorin.

Thorin sees the shark *pass through* Penny and recognises it as an illusion. He warns people and, so, we proceed!

So, the part of - eight! - that we've become are led by Penny to a door she finds in a corner of this room, close by. Beyond is a corridor, dark; she lights the sword but keeps it close to her body to avoid blinding people behind - but to them it's quite creepy as the walls are covered in now very onliquely-lit carvings that are kind of  a "Dante's Inferno" style depcition. The style is different and it seems like a comparatively new addition. A river of souls, being dragged, coralled and drawn forward - on brand for Acerarak! She thinks he must be close. She tries to joke about it, using the sword to under-light her face like a campfire ghost story but Urth's having none of it and runs past, closely followed by Thorin! So, they beat her to a side-room that opens up into a huge 15ft high door. The carvings of the souls terminate here, falling into a bowl, in front of the doors. A figure with black diamonds for eyes is carved above. THe doors have no handles. There are three concentric mounted rings on the bowl - and Urth realises they have syllables of the word, so he can rotate them to form the password. He's not sure if he should work out-to-in or in-to-out; and he guesses first time right! The door unlocks. Without waiting for the rest of us - in close pursuit! - he opens it.

It's dimly lit. An impression of green fire dances on the walls. There are six pedestals on which are treasures. But they look like the things we already found! Counterfeit?! Sat on a throne in the middle of the room is a lich. He looks... Bored. He holds a crooked staff, head in hands, not moving, not responding. He thinks Acererak is holding a rod piece. It's in the right place, given Find The Path, unless there was another rod piece. The staff is a - a well of souls?! It draws souls to it.

The rest of us hear the door open and start to run. Penny gets in first. The sword casts more light and with that, she can tell that those six items in the room are *definitely* not the original magical items. *We* have - we think? - five of the originals! In fact we think we might even have all six. There's a shiny door catching the light behind; it looks like it's made of *platinum*.

Urth wants to head for the door. But he doesn't trust the perhaps-false lich. He casts Wall Of Fire to encircle it; 15 fire damage *should* result; the maybe-lich makes the save...

...Initiative! Some are within Penny's aura for +5

* Urth 22
* Thorin 22
* Penny 21
* Gundtach 12
* Francesc 11

Urth cast the spell, so he now gets a bonus action. He tries to taunt possible-Acererak! DC18 WIS save required; Acererak makes it (and then some - 27!). No effect. Urth strafes sideways, heading around towards the door a little, inside the set of plinths with fake artefacts.

The possible-lich is now standing, just visible inside the flickering wall of flames. He uses a legendary action and teleports, *right next to Urth* - then swipes with a skeletal hand. 31 to hit - obvious hit! - 23 necrotic damage; the wall of fire drops. Urth PER nat 20 - **lying on the throne is a piece of crystal rod**.

Thorin moves into the room and tries Befuddlement. INT 18 DC, lich's save is 31! Even so 10d12 -> 56, psychic damage -> but seems to take *no* damage. Huh? Maybe it's immune? He's surprised, but doesn't miss a beat; he Wildshapes into a giant subterranean lizard.

Acererak teleports again, next to the giant Thorin-lizard. He attacks with another death rend - 27 to hit - 20 necrotic damage is dealt.

Penny is unsurprised, as she has Suspicions. As her bonus action she uses Channel Divinity to use Divine Sense. Is that *really* an undead creature right there?! Well, she finds out that it *is* definitely Undead. Oh! Maybe she's wrong, this *might* be Acererak or his simulacrum after all. So she runs up and attacks. First hits, 3d8+5 -> 20 radiant; 19 to hit hits also, 19 damage on top of that.

"Fools! Flee or give your souls away for nothing!"

Penny INS 23. Thorin 22. Both notice a strange aspect; a melancholy, hopeless, almost as if this creature can't be bothered! The trouble could be saved by going away or just dying.

Marianna runs in and sees probable-Acererak - and sees us *attacking* probable-Acererak - and fails a WIS save. She casts Arcane Burst 3 times, *on us* - two to the lizard, one to Penny. One hits Penny, and one of the two hit the lizard. 25 necrotic each! Gundach sees this and pushes her back with a Thunderwave; she fails her save and is knocked prone with 14 damage.

Francesc puts up Hunter's Mark - Immune: Charm, Exhaustion, Frigthened, Paralysed, Poisoned, Stunned; Necrotic, Poison, Psychic. Resistant: Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing. That doesn't leave much! She tries arrows with a bit more magical... Punch. First attack, 17; just misses; next is a 20, which hits. 10 piercing -> 5, 3 force; 8 damage; a Stasis Strike is added on - 1d8 force 4 taken, WIS save 17 - made, just! (18). She moves back into a bit more cover.

Acererak teleports just beyond the doors, to attack Francesc. His swipe misses!

Talo is scared, but attempts Turn Undead; Acererak makes the save; and it's his turn again. He walks to the doorway, sighs heavily, and then that rises into a blood-curdling lament... But it has no effect. The heroes feast was enough to protect us. So now he looks to Francesc and activates a gem in his chest. Magic in it tries to suck her soul! CHA save nat 20 + 1 -> 21. Somewhat unfairly that's not enough to meet the DC of 22! 21 -> 10 force damage - she's resistant! Soul gems on Acererak start to glow and he heals for the same amount, but he seems visibly surprised. His last act is a death rend, which deals 25 necrotic damage. She reacts to resist that somewhat; 12 damage taken.

Vogren calls down Holy Fire on Acererak, who of course makes a save but still takes 8 damage.

Urth is up! He sees the rod; he rushes over to try and figure out how it might be detached, but it's embedded from the front. There are a couple of clasps. A dagger could probably pry it out; so he gives that a go. SOH check with the dagger he has. 13. Matches DC. Easy. The rod slides out sideways. Penny and Francesc can't see this because of the bulk of Thorin-lizard, but *Thorin* is able to see both Acererak and Urth at the same time. With his prior insight he sees that Acererak isn't reacting at all. Urth grabs it; WIS save - 18 - he gets hold and Thorin (who was just about to say something before he grabs it!) sees Urth freeze for a moment, but then react normally.

Urth thinks; "Oh, I can cast Mirage!" as he wins his mental fight against the rod. But now he's transported in a vision.

* A beautiful, ornate desk in an elegant room with silk curtains and gems and quills and books on a table.
* A beautiful cloth bag.
* **A sense of being in Sigil.**

Urth turns and looks at Acererak, who sees Urth holding the rod, and insofar as one can read a skeletal face there's no indication of rage, or anger. INS check for both Thorin and Urth. Thorin: 29. Thorin has seen this before; Acererak is almost *hopeful*. Or is it relieved?

Urth throws Bardic to Francesc, holding the rod segment aloft!

Acererak takes *no actions*.

Thorin says - "We're just here for the rod. We don't have to fight!"

Acererak asys, "Wait, you've come to take the *rod*? Why?!"

"We have business with the rod!"

"What business did you have with - you - you came just for the rod? Not the treasures?"

"Acererak, we have business with someone *else*."

"Acererak?! No, I'm Rerak!"

Penny says, "Yes, a simulacrum. We have no interest in killing you or Acererak!"

"A simulacrum? Is that all I am to you? Can a simulacrum do *this?*" - the ground shakes!

Thorin and Urth try to persuade him; Urth 23, "But you don't *mind* that we have this rod?"

We find out that Rerak is *bound* to be here as long as the rod is here to be protected. But Rerak is *BORED*. He's been here a long time! Seen nothing outside. He wants to explore. He doesn't want to be Acererak's minion; he has his own sentience and desires and mind now. He is powerful, but friendless.

Thorin says, "We'll take this so you can be free! But what's behind the door?!"

Acererak throws platinum keys that were on a chain around his neck to Urth! Urth opens the door. There's a small, *very* old chamber beyond and across that is a beautifully decorated door that looks as if it is from a totally different age. There are various items in here, including a silk sash that looks *very* like the sixth of the items we were looking for. There's some kind of expensive-looking game board, a set of fire opals and a statue of a draconian-looking mannequin head with ruby earrings. There's an old historical tome, detailing the lost faith of the people.

The door beyond has another lock which the other platinum key opens. "BUT if you *are* going to leave" shouts Rerak "can you take me to the surface with you?" - and of course we agree.

A brief argument develops! Francesc thinks this thing might be evil. Rerak leaves the staff behind, but she asks him what he'll do! "I want to discover the world!" is the answer. He is convinced to leave behind the gem he used for power, too; the design of the tomb, he insists, is what "sucks souls". Eventually Francesc manages to find an accord. It seems legit.

OK, well, shall we go?!



## Campaign Day 35

Fast forwad. We get out; we get to the village; we have the six artefacts and it's unanimous - we agree to hand *those* items, at least, back. And in fact they'll pay for the other items too. They have a **lot** of platinum - and we walk away with a chest full - **50,000gp worth in all**.

We could rest, it's been a long day or two, and we're dirty AF - covered in mud and so-on from the swamps. But we want *safety* Penny suggests. We end up using Bigby's teleport/planeshift to return. Gundtach asks if he can return with us while the other three want to stay. He'll come to the Outlands, at least. So the five of us move. It's a rough planeshift; CON saves, Urth and Francesc take 25 force damage! 12 in Francesc's case due to resistance. Fortunately Penny and Thorin make the save and are unhurt.

On the plus side, we realise we've landed in the Outlands quite close to our tower. Gundtach asks to stay - it's agreed - the rest of the residents say there's a letter from Mayastan there; he asks us to meet him at "the sanctum" (Alustriel) because thing have escalated. Gertrude brings up that he doesn't seem to get along with the Athas child Mynos, but is apparently doing important work with the elf we rescued in Sgil too. Anyway, he has made discoveries about the rod.

Well, we say goodbye to everyone and thank them for continuing to look after the tower,

We get to Sigil via Trade Gate as usual. It feels odd here. Almost on the verge of a riot. It's busy - busier than usual.

At the sanctum, Alustriel - seeing that we're quite muddy and the sanctum is apparently busy? - asks us if it's OK to share one room for the four of us. Urth thinks about starting his Flurth cast in the morning, but meanwhile we have to try and get cleaned up. Mayastan is excited to see us, especially now that we probably have 6 segments and we're closed to Vecna being defeated. Urth INS check - 7 - Urth doesn't know him well and he seems a bit eccentric but harmless enough.

In the room, we try to clean up and sleep. Penny's armour is pretty dirty so she takes that off, but is worried about the rod so hides the bag of holding amongst her person.



## Campaign Day 36 (the early hours)

That night, PER checks. Francesc PER 25. She's medidating up in a turret to get away from the rest of us! Thorin 26, Urth 7. And late at night, Thorin wakes to feel a spell completing. It's strange; time is slowing; Mayastan has teleported into the room; he's next to Penny; he's holding something. Up in the tower, Francesc has a kind of 6th sense about this - she runs down, gets into the room and it's a bit like in the tomb earlier; a time dilation effect; Mayastan, she sees, has been pulling all the rod pieces out of the bag. He turns, looking at her; a glint of fangs; Urth is asleep, Penny is asleep; but then Mayastan dashes past, so fast it might as well have been a teleport. He's casting. And **a force cube erects around us**.

He's outside it. He is clutching the rod, but has a silk bag on him. "Finally, we can defeat Vecna!" he asys. Thorin has woken Urth and Penny - we get up, groggy, as the force cage clamps down. Penny tries Dispel Magic, ARC check *nat 20* plus 4 - it does nothing! - she realises that it's a force cage; Disintegrate would do it, but almost nothing else.

Urth talks about using the recently-acquired Planeshift spell. We couldn't get back. What about the Helm to get back? Helm can't planeshift!

A humanoid bunny (!) runs from a neighbouring room. Looks like a monk! Runs over, says something; can't hear her; we're all pointing downwards but she can't hear us either; she mouths something, turns back, says something else and jumps down, presumably having seen Mayastan. A bugbear follows, going down stairs! A moment after is a halfling; she's *signing* - "Force cage, can't be dispelled!"

Thorin - common sign language! - he signs back to tell her about Mayastan. "OH, that's bad! Needs disintegrate! We'll break his concentration and you'll be free!" is the sign-back and she runs. Bizarrely, next is a Satyr in fine silk bed clothes (?!) - he chases downstairs.

Then as this madness goes on, Zorhanna appears! She sees the cage, tries Dispel Magic Penny is holding her head in her hands. She mouths, "Do you have disintegrate?!" - "No!" but at that instance, the spell drops. The halfling wizard must've got Mayastan! There's commotion downstairs.

We run, or moonlight-step, or whatever we can. As we arrive in the library, we see the mirror portal has been activated and those who arrive quickly see that humanoid-rabbit - actually a Harengon - is getting back. She has some soil from the domain? Pandemonium apparently? The other three we saw are here; that bugbear, satyr, halfling.

And she says **it's Kas** - Kas was disguised as Mayastan. We've no heard much about Kas but Francesc knows it from lore and history - Vecna's closest friend and lieutenant, but betrayed Vecna, gouging out the eye and cutting off the hand. Supposedly kept in a Shadowfell prison. And he said he would *defeat* Vecna! Still angry...

Alustriel runs in. Alarm going! Teleportation mirror activated - and peopel are all talking at once about Kas and the rod segments being stolen. She's mortified.  There's a strange crown that those other four have - they've identified it - it's called a Crown Of Lies, *very* powerful, almost impossible to see through. That's why so many people were fooled by attempts to detect, including things like a truth zone.

**A perfect lie.**

We don't know how long Kas has been Mayastan - so what's happened to Mayastan?!

As the chaos unfolds, we ask the Harengon for that soil - and the cubic gate - we could use the gate to get to this weird Pandemonium place, and *then* use the Helm with the soil to get to wherever Kas was. It sounds like Kas is wanting to free Miska the Wolfspider - the demon created by the rod in the first place.

But then those other four suddenly are running out onto the street. The halfling is saying something about "raven queen" - we run out too - it's daytime in Sigil **but everyone is looking up**.

There's a - new sun? - in the sky. And then huge beams of radiant light streak out from it, hitting buildings, hitting blocks, smashing things. The ground is shaking. **The halfling calls out something about Vecna, the "Reality Engine" and destroying Sigil!**

(End of act 2, part 37)
