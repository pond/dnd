# RIPA: Act 2 Part 22
## Session 68 (2025-07-08)
### Athas, city of Tyr, outside club The Notorious (Outlands relative day 22)

A trail of bodies and terrible stories of slavery lead us to The Notorious, a sort of day-at-night club in the city of Tyr. Outside, we queue; a big banner announces extra celebrations due to a 50th Anniversary; we don't know if that will work in our favour or against us. Either way, we have to think fast to get inside with our three tickets and one - uuuh - slave!

(DM fiat - by whatever means, we can handle the spoken/written language for expediency).

Thorin intends to present us as a rich person, a bodyguard, a slave and a dilettante. He hands the tickets; "Not seen you here before." "Not been here before!" interjects Arturo. "Well then how do you have tickets?" ...Oops. Thorin: "My family connections, obviously!" - ADV deception dirty 20. "You *do* realise that we take no responsibility for what happens to your slaves once you're through that door?" Yes. So, Thorin gets a sort of event programme and we head in.

We're on the lookout for Simera - described to us as a small, scrawny, darker skinned; a (three-)quarterling; an older human child. She's not likely to be up-front and centre. We might need to get "backstage".

We enter a foyer area with a sort of coat check. A large locked cabinet looks set up for more expensive items. On the assumption the clientele here are - "less than noble" - Penny whispers to Thorin, "Wouldn't it be a shame if someone were to pick the lock and steal everything in there?!"

Thorin looks to the attendant. "Take us through!" - with Penny's help, ADV intimidation, 18. We're taken through to a large, dark, smoky room with loud thumping music. A kind of giant net is suspended from the ceiling with writhing, scantily-clad people up on there; now and again a cattle-prod like device is used to jab them to make them move. Nobles seem to take them from attendants to use, then hand them back. Thorin gets his own back on Francesc with one of those!

A noble side-eyes Thorin; "Let me have a go!" - but Thorin retorts, "The only person that gets to jab this one is me!"

Penny is below the middle of the net. No quarterlings. An attendant asks us if we want a table. Penny says, "This can't be it? What's going on. Why aren't we in the right area?" - on a punt. Arturo helps. Persuasion ADV 29; "Ah! Of course. And do you want a personal servant? One of *ours*." Seems coded. Insight tells Thorin to hand over some money; Arturo is nodded at, he has the local currency; he gives the equivalent of 5gp. That seems to be enough. "Let me give you a tour!" - he glances first to the side of the stairs; then seems to change his mind. (We later figure he thought our "slave" might need bringing in for nefarious purposes and if nothing else, some degree of discretion for *that* applies).

We are taken to the far end of the room where we can then see a big stage with dancers performing, and with cages above; people inside do *not* look happy. Even so, there are humans and elves there but the latter are well-fed and clean... And only about 6 years old in Elf terms. The dancers are adorned with some interesting decorations that look potentially functional - sharp or spiked - weapons if needed, perhaps?

The attendant turns our attention to a brand on the people in the cages. We can take a bid, or be "taken downstairs"... "What's the going rate?" asks Arturo. The question is avoided... Another bribe. 5gp. "These here? Hovering between 300-400. But the special ones - they are not on show." Thorin of course expresses interest in that! And so we are led back through the room, towards the coat check but in a corner across, along the dividing room. There's a door; we are taken through to a kitchen ("...pretences, you understand!...") then to another small room. This is well appointed - and contains lots of smaller instruments which look like they have a rather dark purpose, if applied to an individual.

On the way out, Thorin notices some cooler air blowing under a normal-looking door to one side; he figures it must lead outside. Worker entrance?

Given that other room's contents, Thorin decides we ought to leave someone behind. "Maybe we shouldn't bring our slave down?" he suggests. "Ah! Yes!" says the guide, knowingly - whatever *he* thinks is the reason can't be good. The rest of us are led down some stairs.

Back upstairs, Francesc has realised our fortune; we *are* "back stage", so to speak, it seems. This doesn't look like an official path, or at least it's not a heavily trodden one as she waits a while and nobody except the cook team from the kitchen seems involved here. She searches in the few rooms she can access without being caught. Investigation - 26; finds a store room, lots of dried foodstuffs and some jars - oh! With (nature check...) poisons. Anaesthetics, or even things to *heighten* pain as well as numb it. They could be ground into powders and used to spike food. Sprinkled on, incorporated into drinks, oils, who knows. Francesc hides *the lot* in her concealed bag of holding; some 100 "portions" worth! Then she heads to the door Thorin had noticed; it's not locked and is open to the outside. But on the outside, there's only a keyhole and no doorknob - you'd need a key to get back *in*. There's an alleyway outside. Thieve's Tools SOH check (ADV) 23. She manages to get it latched so it's shut, but not locked closed. If bumped into from outside it would swing open.

She ducks out to check the alley and immediately gets the sense that someone just ran, or hid. She takes a stab in the dark and calls, "Simera". Perception 21 vs her stealth 28 - she hears a voice say "yes?" and sees a knife to her throat! Then she looks more closely - an elf! - she draws back a bit. Francesc starts her tale as best she can but Simera immediately shushes her for mentioning names. "Be quiet! Do you want to get them all killed?!"

Francesc sees she is carrying strings of earthenware jars that slosh a little. Flammable doubtless. "You're going to burn the place down?" "Something like that!" "But there are people inside that I'd like to get out first."

Simera isn't really budging. She wants the nobles to pay. There will be "collateral damage" - death would be a better outcome than what the nobles have in store! Francesc thinks there's more to it, too; she has a personal reason and isn't considering any other options. "Just... Can you *chill* just for a little bit? My friends will come out and we can do this properly?" "You have *ten minutes*".

(The auction is only once a month. And it starts in 10 minutes).

Downstairs, there's an area with a couple of guards - and sounds of screams muddled by closed doors. Lots of presumably private rooms lead off a bigger room through a short corridor where some dancers perform. They are of exotic races. Young to even younger. There are Mul, elf, drow... Some kind of wet elf, a sea elf? Drying out. Looks painful.

It seems like this is where private deals are done. We witness one or two being taken away by nobles, escorted by guards.

Penny's having to work hard to suppress her anger. Eventually she mutters to Arturo, "If only we had some way to check on our slave elf, don't want anyone *else* getting to her before we do" says Penny to Arturo, rather heavily-handed.

In the mean time, we've forgotten to pretend to be interested! Our guide mis-reads, and takes us through to what is presumably an even *more* secret room. But Arturo spends a sorcery point to do a "group Message", using coded language and wondering what Francesc is doing, but so far she's only found poisons in our timeline (and she has the idea, while responding to our message, that she could distract the cooks and dump the lot into the food that the nobles are eating...)

In the new room, there's a stage where, chained, are two dancers. They seem to be able to create minor effects around them - Penny arcana 9, no idea, Thorin same! - but Arturo, 22. He recognises *psionic* power. It's a bit like the Mul used, but these aren't Mul and they seem to have no control of their powers. He says it all out loud as a flex! The guide looks surprised. "I see why you keep this one", he says to Arturo. "Do you have much experience with this?" - he seems to be angling for trade. "We have an interest" says Thorin. Suddenly there's a table prepared, etc. etc., we're up front and centre.

Arturo notices two stairways leading up, at either end of the room. They have guards on them.

Thorin asks to speak to a dancer. He's told, "You tell me who you're interested in and where your starting bid is, before you can... Inspect the goods." Thorin works off what we've accomplished before; he learns it's 800-1000 for the previous room, 2000-25000 here. "Need I remind you" he says "they have an entire life to serve you". "Well then. Let's start at 2000."

He asks which Thorin would prefer. He considers which of them looks more - onto it. Less messed up. Insight 14; no idea; Penny tries too but - nat 3 again, so insight is only 10. No idea. But Arturo does better and thinks one of them is faking it, so that's the one we indicate. Eventually we're taken to one of the private rooms off the side of that main area. The door is shut while we wait; we've seen that before - someone goes into a room, door is shut, then the 'merchandise' is brought in.

Thorin quickly whispers to Arturo - "best go and check on Francesc!"

The table is covered in beautifully cleaned torture implements. "Well, I know who we can use *them* on!" says Penny, unaware that there's ambiguity in whether she meant the nobles above or Thorin!

The door opens; the person is pushed into the room. Arturo is watching; they're faking it, eyeing up the room, sizing us up. Penny tries to convince them that we're *not* going to use the implements, just to try and set them at ease; persuasion dirty 20. Doesn't seem to do much. So Thorin instead says, "Please sit; we have some questions". The person sits. Arturo says, "I know you're not as intoxicated as you pretend. We're here to talk about the... Vulnerabilities of your current masters."

The calculated eyes become more obvious; the ruse is dropped, at least somewhat. After a while, "Don't think that I'm helpless" - Arturo says "That's why we called you here!" at the same time as Penny says, "I'm kind of hoping you're not!" - as Thorin pushes the implements onto the ground. At this, the person tries to push into his mind. WIS save; 21, but he *chooses* to let them in. And makes sure that they know it.

The presence in his mind is much less finessed than that of Mynos. It stumbles around, so to speak, trying to find things of interest. They look puzzled - for obvious reasons.

We learn that there's a group of dwarves that (probably) own the club and their family members - do this. They bring in people. Specially bred, the ones downstairs; upstairs, people are just captured off the street. But we can't get much more than that. They've spent most of their lives here, and most are brought in unconscious.

Arturo gets through to Francesc - and now we learn about Simera. The poisoning thing is a bit slow and getting _everyone_ to eat is problematic; besides, it only knocks people out. A brief discussion... Can *we* buy *everyone* now then burn the place down? We reckon there are at least a dozen guards. But we realise that it is *an auction* and we don't know how deep the pockets are here. Arturo figures we could try bidding for everyone, at 1.5x the market rate... And if there's a fight, people might get hurt in the crossfire. Penny is biding her time... So Arturo just goes to the guide; says "50K for the whole lot. We're in a hurry. We want to take the lot." The guide rises an eyebrow. "That would be excellent for *me* but it would need to be cleared by a higher-up." Arturo adds, "We have the cash on hand. And we'd want more next time of course, but we'll pay a bit of a premium this time since it's the first time around."

It can't be done right now. We're told to wait. Penny insight 17 - well, at least *that* guy seems to be into it. But it might tip our hand. Francesc is kept up to date. Luck roll 15 - nobody is checking on us.

Up top, Simera is excited to learn about the poisons; "we need an advantage" she says, and putting people to sleep is a start - especially if we can target the guards. She works with Francesc to make a kind of paste, in oil and starts coating various bone knives. She learns Francesc is good at stealth too; so, it's on! "Let's do it, then!" she says. Stealth - 33 Francesc, 19 Simera.

On another "Ping" from Arturo - he has to be careful with sorcery points, this can't go on indefinitely - we learn that "we'll take care of upstairs" and so *now* we wonder if down here, we'll just fight! Not really intending to pay 50 grand anymore.

Upstairs, Simera and Francesc work well together. Simera says that the general workers aren't part of it; they're trapped as much as anyone else in various ways. They'll flee once things kick off! But the nobles and the guards? Well the Syndicate nobles - *definitely* get rid. But we don't know who is who. And we'll need to take out bodyguards too.

To prove her point, Simera presents her knives to the chefs - "this is not your fight!" - and the kitchen clears, quickly.

* Bouncer, guard in the front room
* Here, 6 bodyguards, *ten* actual guards who work here
* Between the nobles and others, maybe 15 more people

"I've got these guards over here... You get those over there" says Simera. Another ping; Penny asks them to try and position themselves at any exit that the nobles might want if they're focusing on guards first.

Surprisingly, Francesc sees the guide from before, coming upstairs looking excited. He doesn't notice either of them. Francesc follows as Simera tries to whisper protest! "Bigwigs!" whispers back Francesc. The guide goes to a booth; Francesc tries to watch who they're talking to, from the shadows. Once she's got that person identified, she gets towards the main door - she wants to block it. There's a guard. She gets a particularly filthy combinations of poisons (and river water) onto the arrow and fires!

She hits. Guard down. Then she darts outside to stab the bouncer! Bouncer down. She runs back in, dragging the bouncer's body. Luck roll nat 20! Nobody was queueing at the time she did all this. Investigation 22, finds the key to the door - locks it. Done. Simera meanwhile is trying to get more staff to leave.

Back in the main room, the guide is still talking to the three nobles. They stand and push past, heading across the floor. "They're Syndicate. Get to the back door and make sure they don't leave!" says Francesc - and Simera takes on a gleeful look and runs off. There's a scream! A noble stands up as a guard suddenly slumps down. A blur of rags - Simera moving fast! - that's France's cue.

Downstairs, slightly earlier and knowing that she has Blindsight, Thorin gives Penny a potion of Darkness. With Stone Sense, Thorin hears the sound of about a dozen people rapidly leaving the building.  "Ah. It's time!" he says. We leave the room - "keep down!" we say, to the unfortunate 'merchandise'. As we exit, a guard immediately comes over, assuming he should take said merchandise back to, well, the stage or something else.

Arturo walks up, as if to speak to them; uses Telekinesis in a way that basically crushes their windpipe and they can't speak and then stabs them! (Yikes!) 23 to hit; easy; Arturo twists the knife; it counts as a crit, but 2d4 -> only 1 each plus DEX, 4 damage. They're badly wounded, having been taken by surprise - but they're not down - he gets in another hit and *that* takes the guard down. They're not actually dead yet but it won't be long. Penny sees this go down with a degree of horror! But having stepped forward a little she sees the two guards in the adjacent room on the couch; she moves to attack.

Initiative:

* Arturo 22
* Thorin 20
* Penny 19
* Francesc (from earlier) 11

Thorin moonlight-steps up to the staff member that is leading the "merchandise" away. He grabs their arm and threatens them to leave, *now*. Primal Savagery is on - he's scary! - they run off. Now he's got the merchandise. Arturo throws keys he finds on the guard over. "Set people free!". "Will you stop them from attacking me?!" "We'll do our best..." - she runs up on stage and immediately, other guards start to move to intercept.

Penny decides to use the sun sword. She lights it; Radiant, she's getting the hang of magic on this plane; attacks and hits the nearest guard twice for 14 and 8 points damage.

We hear a scream from upstairs - Simera has struck - and up there, a moment later, Francesc heads for one of the syndicate guards. 12 damage. They don't seem to harmed by the poison - argh, they're all dwarves! Resistant! Francesc yells a warning to Simera about it. She tries shooting a different, non-dwarven guard with a poison arrow and *that* drops them. The commotion builds; other guards seem torn between going for the "pile of rags with daggers" that is Simera, or Francesc. In the end, the eight remaining split in two, four each.

Hearing the scream, Arturo decides to head upstairs. The guard he was holding expires as he leaves.

Thorin is now facing the two guards that were coming to intervene as the dancers on stage started getting unlocked. He conjures some animals (since 20245E doesn't let conjured elementals move) - at L7! He summons an area of serpents - good with poison. Well, he didn't get Francesc's memo, in fairness. 7d10 -> only 20, somehow!

Penny tries something a bit unusual and brings down Moonbeam on the two guards on the couch. L3, so 3d10 but only 11 damage rolled; it takes out the injured guard, at least. The other has yet to act.

Francesc has some guards run towards her; one reaches her and tries to attack but misses. She fires back and takes one down and, meanwhile, Simera gets two as well.

Of the Syndicate - one runs to Simera and one to Francesc, who gets hit for 5 piercing + 10 poison. They point and yell, "This slave has armed herself! Kill her immediately! I want her in a million pieces!". Simera dodges the attacks on her; then she throws a ceramic jar towards a corner and it explodes into flame. Nobles start to run, bodyguards are instructed to lay down their lives for them...

...Standard chaos. Arturo looks up the stairs, hearing the commotion clearly and he sees the fire. Ah, these stairs are one of the two flights we saw at the back of the stage earlier. He can see a group of nobles across the room, easier to see thanks to the near-field fire lighting up the room! He uses Chain Lightning; aims for a bodyguard and two or three nobles clustered around. Only one of the group of four dodges; 48 damage anyway means that *all* fall.

The guards near Thorin haven't managed to get away from the creatures and *this* time the 7d10 is 51! They vanish under a writhing mass of snakes. Thorin runs into the adjacent room, his snakes a distance behind, shouting to have the keys thrown as he does - dex save 4, completely misses! They fall on the floor and he has to scramble to grab them. Other dancers are now running, backing up behind Penny who's blocking the door due to the two guards.

In the other room, they don't seem to know what's going on. "What's happening in there?!" they shout; "Just raucous customers!" says Thorin, deception 21.

The remaining guard near Penny runs up and attacks, hitting for only 5 damage. Penny moves the moonbeam, trying to not block the way, 21 damage -> guard fried. She drags the previously dead guard off the couch, throwing them under the beam too so that the couch is clear then dodges the beam and starts calling the fleeing people through, warning them to move around it. She shouts at them to turn right, right, up stairs, right again and out!

Upstairs, a veteran by the fire sees Arturo and moves to attack. One hit deals 10 damage. The kids in the cages are freaking out. By Francesc, a veteran and noble attack but she dodges it all. She attacks back point-blank (sharpshooter) and takes down the veteran and, since she'd marked them with Hunters Mark, she transfers it to the noble and takes them down in a single shot.

Simera attacks a syndicate member. She gets in one attack but poison isn't very effective and he stays up. He grapples her and starts shouting to Francesc, "Back away! Back away!" - he pulls out a dagger and holds it to her throat.

Arturo ignores the veteran guard in their face and uses Telekinesis on that hostage taker instead! He runs forward; the attack of opportunity is a nat 1, obviously missing; he gets within range and manages to grab with his still-up spell. Now the restrainer is restrained themselves.

Thorin's snake swam is made of *spirit* snakes and he pulls them closer, straight through a wall rather than around the long way through the door. They get right up to one of the noble/bodyguard pairs; 44 damage; both are killed immediately. Then he dashes to the stage and unlocks the manacle. They're out of it; he says, "We're clearing this room because of the snakes (!) - go that way!" - but they fall unconscious against him.

We can smell smoke down here now. We know time is short. Penny runs back through her own moonbeam (15->7 damage) before remembering to move it out of the way, getting to a nearby closed door. She throws it open; a noble is roughing up a dancer. "What are you doing in here?! No guards allowed!" he shouts. She just raises the sun sword.

The veteran righter runs up behind Arturo and despite trying to react-cast Shield, gets pushed into the fire! 10 fire damage, but he holds his spell.

Francesc fires at the hostage taker. She gets a hit, down they go; then at the veteran who'd pushed Arturo and they, too, are taken down in a single shot. Meanwhile, Simera throws two more firebombs! One is close to the nets which still have people stuck on them above and one is quite close to the door.

The fire around Arturo grows; he takes another 16 (!) fire damage as he's running out, but yet again, holds his spell. He's on his fire, but despite that tries to rip down a cage with the still-up Telekinesis. The cage is still locked, but on the ground and further from the fire. The moving cage has broken whatever had locked its chain in place and the other two start to fall too; Arturo has time to break their falls with his spell, although it's still a bit of a jolt. He's going to stop-drop-roll but wild magic surges and he suddenly goes from on fire, to drenched in water!

The remaining noble and bodyguard that were in the room with Thorin and his snakes run up the other to-stage stairwell, across the way from the one Arturo used, but find themselves in an even worse place - fires everywhere, cages falling, dead bodies all over the place.

Thorin is slowed by the unconscious dancer; he starts to pull them back towards where he last saw Penny. Forgetting his infrequently used ability to cure someone of what amounts to poison, he misty-steps - in this instance, the person he's got acts really more like baggage than a person.

Penny runs in, attacks the noble and says to the dancer, "Run! Turn left, all the way out, right, right, up, right and out!" - then hits with a divine smite; they die; she runs back out, around and to the next room (Thorin now sees this and realises we're *not done yet*). Another noble and another dancer; same story; she's *just* able to take the noble down with one blow. This time, the dancer embraces her in thanks!

Up top, Francesc just keeps firing. She goes for a lightning arrow to try and get a few more people in one go. It works! And another arrow at a noble; another one falls. Then she starts to run in, heading for the cages.

Simera is wild. More firebombs are thrown out. Arturo is nearby (she almost throws one at him!) but he tries to talk her down - he saw some of the kids escaping from the side door - she could steer then, change their lives, the dwarves are all dead... Persuasion. Dirty 20. Thank goodness, she goes for it. She jumps up and climbs on one of the chains holding up the big net up and starts hacking at it; and it works. The chain breaks and that corner of the net collapses; the people on it tumble off. Some run for the main door, but a few follow instructions and head for the exit.

* Downstairs, Thorin and Penny keep working on clearing out the remaining rooms. The path out of the side door from downstairs will remain clear of fire for a little while
* Upstairs, Francesc and Arturo see tackling the fires as a dead loss; while trying to call back anyone fleeing towards the locked main door, they have to tackle the cage locks; Francesc SOH 22.

Outside, Thorin and Penny find lots of people. Staff, kids, Simera, smoke, flames - but no Francesc and no Thorin. Penny runs back in; she can see flames through from the kitchen so tries going back down, intending to go up the stage stairs. The fire is spreading quickly. She gets to the very base of them just in time to witness Arturo casting Cone Of Cold; no magic; a whole chunk of fire clears above the stairs. The two of them and the kids run out, Penny in tow.

We end up in the side return. Simera is telling us we need to run in a direction she points, but commotion has been sufficient to attract **at least ten Templars who are running this way**.

Thorin tries deception - "GET MY PROPERTY IN ORDER!" he barks at Francesc; the two of them - perception > 20 - both see that the "personal guide" from before has *also* made it out. He's over with other staff members, pointing at us - "Arrest them immediately!" he's saying. "They *stole* from the club. They've stolen everything of value from the club. Search them!"

And all at once:

* Simera shouts to the kids, "Come with me! We need to run!"...
* Thorin mouths to Penny, "*darkness potion*", so she grabs the vial in her pocket and is about to throw...
* Arturo is starting to draw on a big spell to throw at the templars; arms outstretched, hands close together...
* Arcana nat 2 - **something goes horribly wrong**, some wild magic connection, deep within - a **massive** surge of energy...

Thorin, Francesc and Penny just have time to see Arturo look alarmed and say, "oh no!" - along with a brief visible flash of something strange, familiar, do we even hear *birdsong?!* - but we flinch away as a *gigantic* cone of cold, a veritable tsunami of ice, blasts past us and freezes *everything* behind on the street.

And when we look back, just a fraction of a second later, Arturo has gone.

(End of act 2, part 22)
