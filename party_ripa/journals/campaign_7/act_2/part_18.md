# RIPA: Act 2 Part 18
## Session 64 (2025-05-13)
### Athas desert (Outlands relative day 18)

Ambush!

We have found Thri Kreen tribespeople and have joined an ambush on a trading caravan on its way from the rich, once-port trading city of Gulg to the self-declared capital, Tyr.

The first three wagons are wrecked. The second rolled, the third crashing into it; we see slaves in cages there. The first crashed into a deep hole made by Thorin's magic. A strange child was being transported there and we've learned they were using the caravan as cover, and aren't actually part of the trading that's going on there. We need to figure out what we're going to do about this curious but evidently important and, surprisingly, very magically powerful child; and how we're going to set the slaves free.

Battle is ongoing! Francesc acted last.

* Penny 26
* Thorin 23
* Arturo 13
* Francesc 11

Penny runs up to the nearby guard, prone after Francesc's attack, and knocks him out with her sword. Then she runs a little closer to the next guard. Thorin wants to get the child away from danger; he tells the child to come with him and gently grabs a wrist but the child pulls free - and *floats* alongside. Thorin leaves the child with Arturo (!) then throws down a L5 Moonbeam down on one of the mounted guards; 16 damage potential; CON18 save; all damage taken. The mount only takes half.

The Thri-Kreen act. One looks to the slave caravan and points; "You can have that one, as agreed" then attacks the guard Penny was heading towards with spears. Hits twice; 15 and 8 damage. Three others we can see near are also attacking, getting in single hits each; 14, 14, 28 damage. The guard near Penny is dead; another has been struck and killed, the raptor now running wild; the one in the moonbeam throws off its rider and runs too; but one of the mounted guards then runs up to the slave caravan to defend, hitting one of the Thri-Kreen in passing (13 damage).

Arturo considers Chain Lightning. He draws on power within, L6 via sorcery points, but also goes for subtlety so nobody sees it coming - and makes it seem like it originates from Penny! 10d8 -> 45, *each* - an intolerably bright jet of lightning streaks out to a guard and branches out to hit three more. They don't really stand a chance - they're all incinerated, even one of the guards that managed to jump to the side to avoid the worst of it.

At this, a guard flees, but another now makes their raptor-like mount leap over a caravan towards us, landing close to Penny. They call out in another language - but point in Arturo's direction. The Thri-Kreen then call out in our heads; **"What have you done?! That child is some kind of prophet! You've kidnapped a prophet!"**

The guard near Penny attacks Arturo with a sling. Hits, but it's only 4 damage and he holds Telekenesis - but another runs in; gets close and swings a long scythe-like stone weapon with some considerable reach from up on its mount - but it misses. It tries again focusing on Thorin with a hit, for 5 piercing damage. There's poison, CON save, but he's resistant and Penny's aura helps -> only 1 more damage. Now it too calls something out, picks up a horn and blows on it.

Up on the dune a little, Francesc uses the vantage point to try and take out some of the other bandits -  well, merchants?! - 14 damage. She's aiming for limbs, not kill shots; another gets hit, 11 damage and is bloodied. Penny is thinking that this might be a bit extreme, but one of the other "bandits" then jumps in with two blades and hits twice - a hit and a crit, 12 damage total - since Penny is not wearing armour. Two others freak out and run, but a third also chooses to attack and starts to run in. Then there's a strange loud thudding, muffled in the sand; and an 8ft tall half-giant leaps into view! They've come from the back of the caravan - probably called by the horn.

To our amazement it seems to channel magic. Dust seems to fall of its skin as it *vibrates* somehow; it reaches behind to fetch a long spear from a holder on its back; the distance is long, but it manages to get a hit on Arturo. Penny reacts to heal by the full amount! Arturo saw the spear *growing* spikes as it headed for him. It grazed him but didn't strike; upon hitting the ground it explodes! A second is then thrown but in frustration (nat 1) it misses.

One of the giant lizards now starts to flee, almost clawing its way over another as it goes, causing the towed caravan to flip.

Penny attacks the guard between her and Thorin/Arturo, hitting twice with a divine smite thrown in, for 30 total damage. They're hurt - but not taken down.

Thorin moonlight-steps to behind one of the guards across from him, then moves Moonbeam over the half-giant, grazing a giant lizard along the way; 25 damage potential, half taken by the half-giant, the full amount taken by the unfortunate lizard which is very badly injured.

The Thri-Kreen continue their attacks, various hits, misses and a crit. The guard Penny was attacking falls off their mount, dead - and their mount is killed too. They're quite widely scattered around now and we get the impression they're starting to back off - and paying a lot of attention to the half-giant.

Arturo swings the telekenesis grab around and manages to grab the half-giant (DC21 STR save, despite advantage, failed). It's restrained within the moonbeam. He holds his ground, keeping himself between the child and a guard. The child speaks; "Who are you and why are you attacking the" - and there's a strange word; the sense is, "kidnappers". So *they* feel themselves kidnapped. Arturo answers, "We are going to save you!" "I did not require saving. You have ruined my plan!" "We can discuss that later. Right now, stay safe. Get back up the hill towards Francesc" - Arturo backs up too.

There are quite a few of the driver-bandits but only one guard left, who calls back to the half-giant then swings wildly at the people in front. One of the swings hits Thorin, for 9 damage - but only 2 poison is taken.

Francesc aims at the brightly-moonlit, restrained half-giant; hits, 13 damage; hits again, 15 more. The attacks will slow the half-giant down a little.

The attacking bandits continue - one hits and crits against Penny (again), for 3 and 7 damage. The other one runs up the hill and goes for Francesc. One hit, 6 damage.

The half-giant is restrained by the telekenesis, held in fact a short distance above the ground, so finds its physical options limited; magic options, less so. A giant cone of force lifts a big pile of barrels and other debris from an overturned caravan and the whole lot is shattered and thrown in a giant cone, which hits the majority of people still up on the field; DEX saves all round - we do badly, including the child; Francesc is the only one to dodge. 12 damage to anyone who failed, 6 otherwise. This kills the unconscious guard from earlier, too.

The child seems horrified at their own injuries and then - angry. They pick up all the shards on the ground and fling them right back at the half-giant again! The half-giant has already taken another 15 damage from the Moonbeam, but Arturo's telekenesis is held - but it's a moot point - the battle ends from this one act by the child. Splinters, shards, even sand from the desert are blasted out towards the half-giant, other guards and more; glass crystallises into sharp needles; the child then collapses.

Penny runs up the collapsed child; Medicine 14; they breath; she lays on hands to try and give another bit of healing. Religion 31! Upon this act, Penny realises that her power is definitely not coming from Meliki, or any other god here. Maybe it never did? Something else is happening. **Is it just a strong conviction within her? Is that enough? Her oath?** At least them magic works! But the child keeps sleeping.

Penny "thinks" in the general direction of the Thri-Kreen to ask if any are injured. She clarifies - in a way that bothers them! Apparently not! They are definitely hardy.

The Thri-Kreen are busy ransacking the wagons.

Francesc heads over to the cages to free the slaves. They're *very* puzzled to see an elf, and an elf that's a different colour. They start speaking in a language Francesc doesn't understand. They're frail, she sees and some were caught in crossfire or hurt by the tumbling caravan - and have not survived - 5 dead, around 30 alive. She asks Thorin for help - he casts Tongues and now hears them; they are confused at the elf not understanding her! Thorin tries to help translate; "she freed us! But she is the colour of the moon! She is the one! And she has freed us!"

Thorin tries to explain that she speaks a different language. "The olden tongue?!" "Yes! The olden tongue. She *is* the one! She is the one that has been written about!"

They are a bit suspicious of Thorin though. "How do you speak the Wild Tongue?" He tries to explain; persuasion - 3! They don't even believe he's a druid. "Dwarves are master of coin!" they exclaim.

"The riders. They spoke of a prophecy but not ours. Not our prophecy."

"Would that be the one travelling with you?" asks Thorin, pointing to the child.

"Yes, the child, who allowed itself to be captured and hasn't spoke to any of us. We don't understand."

We figure they were on the way to the capital city so perhaps the child was going to mess things up there. Handy!

"Prophecies apparently talk of one who would descend to Athas from the paradise on the Moons, as an emissary; a representative of what could be; a land where elves are free. Not just free, but revered and noble."

"Well, then, it's - it's probably not *this* elf... - but we don't believe in any slavery in any form and any elf we meet in this land we *will* free. And that includes you."

So in their minds - **this is the one**.

The rest of us can't hear this but it's clearly something weird!

He offers food. They're surprised. Then he offers water - they go near crazy! Francesc produces the cask of water beer. They are astonished. They don't seem to know even what to do... They form a wide semicircle around her and the cask. Then one kneels; the others quickly follow. Francesc, still not really knowing what's going on, grabs a *wooden* cup from a backpack, fills it and hands it to a random elf. And *then* Francesc realises she's grabbed the "well-endowed female elf" tankard!

At this point Penny can't help but shout, "what the *fuck* is going on?!"

They seem to be treating it as a ritual. They each take a sip, then hand it on. So now Francesc tries to drink more to demonstrate; they look surprised and horrified; Thorin explains, "She wants you to drink more of the water!" and they do, but are still very wary and only drink a little.

There's plenty of lizard meat around. And some of it is well cooked. And even pre-sliced. Thorin starts to collect some - but quickly realises that it will need preparation. The lizards are full of shards of glass! Arturo stops him and figures he can use Telekenesis to move lizard *blood* out, but we'll need empty barrels for that. All the barrels we find that aren't broken have liquid inside already - often liquid - and besides, the Thri-Kreen have claim on all of that.

Arturo eventually finds a barrel that's got a leak, and it could be upturned and have the top chopped off to form a kind of great big cup. At one point he goes to see if a guard has anything useful on them; the Thri-Kreen stop him as that's "theirs" by prior agreement but ask why he thinks he may have claim. "We killed this one" says Arturo, persuasion 26; we're allowed that.

This opens the discussion up a bit. They're incredulous about the idea of taking slaves, they're useless in battle! For a resistance?! Nonsense. But Penny argues that they can be eyes and ears on the ground, the information part of a wider network. In any case, the Thri-Kreen eventually give us various broken bits of armour and around 30 weapons, one each, enough for better-than-nothing!

(While all of this is going on, Penny thinks to the Thri-Kreen - "Apart from the glass and wood and sand, those lizards look pretty tasty. Wanna share?" - "No, we only eat insects" - more for us then!)

Thorin is trying to convince the Thri-Kreen for a wider partnership. The ones near us turn to one stood atop the dune, who did not take part in the battle. They then think to us, "Wait here" and head up the hill. A few minutes later they come back and this other Thri-Kreen, who might be unarmed, hard to tell, comes down. In our heads, an older, softer voice...

"You are not who we thought you were. We don't understand who you are. But it is clear that you exist to disrupt because you have created a nexus which we have never seen. Allegedly, the elves believe that one of your members has descended from a moon kingdom to free them; this a child's story which we've heard before; and we have always witnessed something else we've never seen before. An extremely powerful Mul. And not just that, a Mul who looks like they were born of other Mul."

**The child is a Mul.**

The way they said that, it seems very significant. Mul are created, not born by other Mul - so this is quite something to them.

We explain that we don't know in any detail what Mul are. "The proudest creation of the cities! They allow the dwarves from the merchant houses to impregnate female human slaves, who give birth to Mul - who are stronger, smarter, many skills, work well and sterile! They cannot have children."

This is a... Challenging plane.

"We have heard whispers of this. We hear it in the minds of those who pass through. But we thought it just myth; urban tales. We never put much stock in these legends that people pray to before they're killed!"

Arturo asks how they feel about this. Afraid of it? No. But puzzled and curious about its existence. They also wonder why it's here.

Penny suggests that it had a plan to be conveyed to the Capital, to disrupt there. We have unwittingly broken that plan. They ask if we take responsibility for the child; "yes!" - we are given advice, then; "This is a trade route. If you stay here, stay no longer than ten hours; another caravan will probably pass through here then - day approaches."

Arturo asks where a nearby place might be to shelter from the sun. "These ruins! We are moving on. We are done with them." "Can we contact you again?" "**If you wish to speak to us again, come out into the desert and lay a beacon fire for us. We will see it in the night and come to investigate.**" (Of course, *other* people will investigate too - we'll have to deal with them until the Thri-Kreen come!)

Before they depart there is a curious acknowledgement, that we fought together. "It will be a good night when we fight together again. Until that night."

They vanish into the dunes, burned heavily by their newfound takings. But it's not all taken - in fact much of the alcohol is left. We look through what remains.

We check out the ruins while the elves wait and the child sleeps. Thorin finds the ruins full of sand, but every few seconds he can move a big cube of it, moving things around to help create a "hideaway" area, a defensible zone. A clearing is created, with a high wall around. Some of it slides back but we can use parts of the wagons to shore things up on the inside.

We hurry; the sky is getting light on the horizon. Arturo watches over the child. Penny ATHL 23, Francesc SURV 21, we start to move stuff in, a bit of a fort. At the end, Penny asks Thorin to cast some earth moulding spells to hide footprints - a lot of people have moved up and down the dunes now - but Francesc reminds Penny that nobody will be coming through during the day anyway. The sun starts to rise; we retreat into our shelter.

It's a bit awkward. All the elves gather on the opposite side of the cleared area from Francesc. They seem afraid of being near her.

When Thorin is nearing the end of his Tongues spell duration, he asks if any of them speak anything else. They look uncomfortable - as if there's some cultural issue - he guesses and says something in Dwarven. One of the elves is pushed to the fore; "I do understand a little Dwarven... My owner was a Dwarf..." Thorin re-iterates that breaking the language barrier is good but he is *not* an owner!

There are some injuries and exhaustion - not enough water or food - but at least they can now rest and are well fed and rested. Thorin uses Mass Cure Wounds (30hp) for the three badly injured - but that doesn't heal them *fully* so, in fact, these are very hardy people - and Penny uses hands-on for those who remain, but there's not much we can do about the exhaustion.

We take watch and, at last, rest - though the child wakes!
