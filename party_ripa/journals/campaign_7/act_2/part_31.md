# RIPA: Act 2 Part 31
## Session 77 (2025-11-11)
### Campaign day 31 on Krynn, on a hill where we once made camp

We have the fifth rod segment - but Flurth is gone. We have teleported abruptly. CON saves:

* Penny 17
* Urth 18
* Francesc 17
* Thorin 23

...no ill effects. The *four* of us who survived stand in a moment of stunned silence. It seems to be late afternoon.

Penny without thinking asks... "Why one are you?!"

"I'm Urth. Flurth was helpful. Maybe if we stick around long enough we'll see him again."

"Is that how it works? Can he - can he come back? As he was?"

"It's not easy. I won't make a habit of it. But if we need him, and you're willing to co-invest - his materials are not cheap..."

Urth INS 21. He realises part of Penny's concern is that Flurth seemed to think and act independently, as if with a soul. Urth explains that his magic is good, but not *that* good! It's a very good illusion.

Penny is shocked at that for a different reason. "Well then I probably shouldn't have killed her...! Teremini, I mean. But Flurth was killed and she was just *there*, in front of me, so I took her down."

"Teremini's not good news! We got what we needed. And she was conspiring with a *very* powerful mage to enact good magic. There's no way that we were in the wrong."

Penny INS 19; that's true, but there's more to it. And she says, "Ah, there was some history there, I think? You don't have to tell us.

Urth explains that he was on the path to be with the Red Mages. But he had a crisis of conscience. He left but couldn't come back; a death warrant of sorts. That's why he was disguised. He's met plenty of mages using power for bad purposes and is very "sceptical" (in his words) when he sees it.

Francesc still has the research notes that she grabbed at the tower. We realise Urth could read them and, given time, he might be able to figure out what they were doing.

Well, we're fighting a particularly bad mage using particularly bad magic. Penny asks if Urth wants to join us... That said we have to explain about the rod. Penny explains the Eberron explosion and remembers the Llandro crystal we carry. He's with us, seeing the world... Worse in theory would be Athas, since ultimately, removing that rod takes its last source of magic away.

Urth explains how he was once part of a group searching for a very powerful diadem, in many pieces. A monk was guiding them in finding it. But once they did, the monk reawakened an older god with it; "we were basically being played the whole time". So he wants to make sure we're not being played too! Well, given our history, that certainly strikes a chord.

Urth asks if we want to rest. We'd prefer to avoid detection - Soth might find us. Urth's hut apparently offers some help there and Penny attunes to the amulet of non-detection for a while. It's actually a strange experience losing the headband of intellect. Not in a good way...

Watch is set (from inside the hut, since we can see out), order being:

* Urth - only 9; a lot of distracting stuff has happened in the last day!
* Thorin - with dark vision, it's easier - 16
* Francesc
* Penny with Francesc helping

Near the end of Thorin's watch, he sees a strange bird. A hummingbird, bobbing around, at night; it's flying around the hut, as if looking for something but confused because it can't find it. Thorin ARC 27 - ah, the bird is carrying a message. It's a druid spell, so he leaves the hut and upon seeing him, the bird flies over immediately.

It's from the "unicorn" hollyphant and druid - they *did* manage to make good their escape and even found two others along the way. They didn't know what happened to *us* and sent the bird to see if we're OK. They tell Thorin where their grove is, in case we want to meet.

Thorin elects to not try and convince the bird to fly back with a reply, nor wake up the exhausted party members. He takes a note of the grove location, thanks the bird and gives it some food, then wakes Francesc for her watch.

* Francesc - 19
* Elects to not wake up Penny; Francesc is rested, and doing well on watch

Urth WIS save - 14 (Penny's asleep; no aura) - and a second check, for frightened condition, ADV 21. He dreams...

**...He is a child. A travelling bard is in town. He's on his dad's shoulders, in the village square, watching - captivated by the performance. The bard decides to participate with the audience at the end. He calls upon Urth to perform. Part of Urth's mind knows this never happened but at the same time it all feels reasonable and normal. He plays an instrument and when he's finished the song, the bard takes the instrument back; but now the bard's face changes and Urth starts hearing whispers. They're all related to a deep secret he's never told anyone (that ADV 21 roll means he avoids fear). A beautiful memory has swung suddenly to this very unsettling strange thing. His child self backs away hurriedly. There's a strange perceived "double vision" of the bard looking like himself, apologetic for freaking out Urth; but overlaid, a strange, desiccated, dead-looking, sinewy thing that is watching him through one eye, the other missing. It's reaching out a hand. As Urth backs away the hand seems unusually long; it extends all the way out to where he is and grabs hold of his shoulder. The whispers now sound like they're from right next to him:**

***"Curious. Brave. Maybe foolhardy... But I know your secret. And you can be very useful to me."***



### Campaign day 32, Krynn

Urth wakes up, marked - though he doesn't like us - in the same way that the rest of us are, when we once encountered Vecna in person. But he's also rested.

Thorin, who's dialled in Planeshift expecting to leave today, is excited because of his news and the three of us don't really notice Urth being a bit withdrawn on the whole, but Thorin perception 24 does see he's being a bit quiet after a while. "I just had a weird dream" he says. "I don't have those!" announces Francesc. On passive insight, Urth is clearly not wanting to make a big deal out of something. We push gently - we have weird dreams too; was it Soth; Urth can't remember clearly a long grasping hand and **one eye**. (Un)dead. He says they were - maybe - "*recruiting* me?"

There is to and fro, as we explain our encounters with Vecna and we hear eventually about the whole secrets thing. In the end, it looks kinda like it really was Vecna in his dream.

On secrets, Thorin remarks that we haven't actually "burned" any of our secrets yet. We haven't needed to. Maybe we should. Penny gets grumpy - "those are secrets, that real people have; they're not ours to use like currency!" - but it's probably misdirected anger after what she did to Teremini yesterday in what amounted to misplaced revenge for Flurth. Francesc points out that she thinks based on long-term studies now and then after Candlekeep that the more secrets we hold onto, the better; in a battle with Vecna, we have our own currency to help against his, even if only a bit.

Nothing we can do about it now... So! Druid grove.

Urth knows the place that Thorin describes. A 2.5 hour walk or a 1 hour flight on Thorin-Quetz.

Over the course of the flight, Penny swaps attunement back to the headband.

The grove has massive trees - gargantuan things, 300ft high - and it's hard for Thorin-Quetz to find a landing spot. Eventually he does. He's in a druid grove so just stays in this form! Soon we're reunited with Vahn and Urian - back in unicorn form - and a new face, druid Melm. We hear that things inside the towers had turned completely to disarray when the field fell. One of the tower tops was destroyed by Soth in a fit of rage.

The three remaining druids are still looking messed up. Urth thinks back to the notes (=> ADV) and (medicine 14) thinks that they've had magical essence - life force - literally drained, and it's going to take a long time to recover. They should, though, do so given enough of that time.

Penny asks Urth how long he thinks it might take to try and get some progress on the lab notes. But Urth thinks it could take quite a long time. But he has a *rough* idea of what they were trying to achieve; we knew it was taking magical essence, raw weave - the book calls it "**spellfire**" - but it was being used *to* infuse some kind of "engine", "**The Spellfire Engine**" - and it looks as if *one* of the uses would be to use the rod to create shortest-paths between domains, as we know. But there is a wider issue of what that Engine can do. Thorin ARC 19 + 4 from Francesc via Guidance.

Something like this was happening in two planes previous to this. For example, whatever was going wrong on Athas involved trying to extract magic *directly* from the weave. They were destroying the world in the process, but it was for *something*. And now they're trying to get it from living beings. So we know that many factions are all working towards it and defeating one does not necessarily stop it.

Thorin explains this to everyone around, including the druids; they're horrified that someone might do such a thing to an entire *world*.

As for the big tree where the rod once resided? That tree, say the "native" druids, should've died long ago. The area became corrupted. They intend to go there, cleanse the area, help the Dryads find a new place to live for now and, in time, they think a beautiful lush forest would grow there.

Thorin offers to help. They're enthusiastic; but they need 6 people for the magic they have in mind. We are only 4 druids... But nature magic works, so Urth and Francesc could also help. We have the fourth rod segment. And Penny can keep watch with Urian.

Urian turns into a Griffon so that we can all fly to the great tree and start the ritual.

Once there, Urian and Penny stay aloft. Penny, perception 15. This land and a nearby city appears to be marching to war! She suddenly remembers the army that had been heading towards the towers. But there are more. Ruins, many signs of recent battle. This place is war-torn. There are dragons in the distance. She recalls that the fifth rod's rune had been "a plane or world of dragons", and she'd been wondering where they all were really - we've seen a *few* but not a whole world - well, there in the distance they are - at war.

Urian shares a concern. There's so much suffering here. So many will die in this huge plane-wide conflict. Urian confesses that whatever we're trying to do, whatever part we have to play, might have an impact; Penny asks if there's a specific one entity that's really causing it. The dragon queen, **Takhisis**. It's a telepathic description, Religion 28, this is **the being she knows as Tiamat**.

Penny relays in return the reports we'd heard of Vecna's rise being apparently related to a rise in "big bad" evil activity on many planes, including an increase in activity of the god we know as Tiamat on Toril. So it's a slim chance but, yes, there's a chance that the tide would be turned if Vecna is suppressed.

8 hours have to pass. CON saves (ADV if Warcaster) to maintain concentration over time.

* Urth 19, fine
* Thorin 14, fine (DC is 10)
* Francesc 11 - just scraped it!

It works, without needing any restarts. The spell finishes - and the huge, dead tree transforms into a bizarre, enormous fungal bloom that decays in front of our eyes and then in a huge radius, 1mi in all directions, saplings burst through. There are vines on the ground still, but they're very different - just normal plants now.

It's 6pm. Everything here now feels strangely calm. There are motes catching in the evening sun. Infused with life.

"Do we have any reason to not leave now?" asks Penny.

Thorin asks the Druids if there's anything else they can think of or things that they took from the towers that might be of use. D100 -> 61. Vahn says, "Oh, yes! I mean no _clues_ or anything like that - but when we were trying to find the others, trying to get information on where they might be, I did find this..."

He shows Thorin a ring. Upon examination, Thorin determines that this is a Ring of Spell Storing. There's a spell in it, too... **Animate Dead**. And he can use it as-is, since he is (to Francesc's horror) **not attuned to the amulet of protection** and hasn't been for ages, so can attune to the new ring!

We are ready to go. Goodbyes all round. Thorin starts to cast his spell, using the tuning fork we were given.

As Urth takes his last look at Krynn, he thinks that this grove is beautiful, but this world does *not* feel like a place to set down roots.

**Closure.**

A green shimmering fog forms around us, which seems to bend air and light, warping our view of the world around. There's a sensation of being in a windy storm, leaves blowing around us, then a very abrupt halt and the leaves disappear.



### The Outlands

To three of us, it's a now-familiar sight. It might not be too much of a stretch to say it feels like home now, given our house-on-legs found its way here. To Urth, though, it's entirely new. Some very distant views almost look like things from mythology! And then there's the endlessly tall mountain in what would seem to be "the middle" and then hazy, above, almost impossible to make out, the floor above us. And gradually, he gets the impression of being inside a torus.

It might look temporarily familiar, but then it *feels* very odd. A *lot* of activity! It's busy around us. We realise we're near a gate, with people queueing, impatient and grumbling. There's an old stone archway against a partly ruined building.

"Where in the hells are we? Why's everyone leaving? Did..." - and then Penny, remembering something we were told a while ago, shouts, "Did Sigil reopen?!" - and she gets an incredulous response, "Where have *you* been? Of course it opened! And we know what you're doing. Get to the back of the queue!"

Urth gets the feeling he could just run for the gate! "Come back!" shouts Penny, but we have to run after him. And so, without necessarily *wanting* to, **we're suddenly in Sigil**!



### Sigil

Urth stops, astonished at the sight ahead of him. But he's on a very busy street. STR save - 22 - someone walks into him and bounces off; and Penny, ATHL 16, runs into the back of him and bounces off too. Wounded pride a bit there, since he's only 3ft tall but it was like walking into a rock!

The torus of Sigil is much smaller than the Outlands. It's not just Urth who ends up staring - we all do. The torus effect is much more obvious here. Looking up means looking *down* onto a street above us, easily seen albeit with some haze in the air. It's disorientating! Hovering, blue-skinned creatures wearing flowing robes approach. Glyphs appear in the air around them. They seem to be trying to communicate and look impatient!

Penny looks unimpressed. Sigh. "Do you speak common?!"

Then the glyphs change, more ordered, written slowly. INT-based INS check, Penny, 19; she can just about figure out that it's language and each glyph is a concept, not a letter. And she's sure they can understand anything she's saying but can't reply that way. Thorin asks about trying universal sign language; she realises they would understand it, but not be able to reply in that.

In the end they give us a strange kind of translucent pebble. In our world, we'd think it was plastic. We later learn these creatures are Dabus. When squeezed, the pebble projects lots of glyphs that circle around quickly and then a 3D illusion of a woman appears and says, in Common, "Welcome to Sigil!"

That follows appears to be some kind of 'new person' introduction. It mentions places of interest and so-on. Thorin's eyes light up at the mention of a bank; we have lots of things to exchange. Urth mentions a pub; when he does, a map of the city is projected and hundreds pop up.

It's the largest busiest city we've ever seen. SUR checks all round; Penny nat 1, people keep walking into her! But the other three are OK. It's super crowded partly because people seem to be streaming in through portals. Penny explains briefly to Urth why we're concerned about it being re-opened.

A carriage draws up close to us! "You look like you're new here and trying to go somewhere!" - turns out it's a paid-for service. We have "nibs", apparently, so Penny - sick of being walked into! - insists we take the offered ride. Thorin INS 30 (nat 20) is initially sceptical; our track record for robbery attempts in new cities isn't great; but it's legit.

The driver is like a centaur, but a goat. Barrior. It's a kind of rickshaw affair that he's towing. Two rows of seats have ample room. And we're glad we did! The ride takes a solid 20 minutes - it was a *long* way. We have to mentally recalibrate the scale of the "pebbble map".

We reach a bridge and he doesn't want to go over it. We're not sure why. Thorin isn't sure but thinks he might not be allowed; trouble with the authorities?; but it's not far to walk from here. Thorin asks if we can find him later? He hurriedly explains a meeting point.

As we get close to the bank, a B alor lands - basically the balrog - at which Penny shouts, "holy *shit*" and draws the sunsword... But everyone else seems unfazed. A cloud giant appears and again, no reaction other than cordial behaviour! It's bizarre. Penny sheaths the sword. It seems this bank is *particularly* unusual.

The bank is ostentatious; white marble, *giant* double doors (60ft tall) and as we approach, a red dragon is just exiting.

"What *is* this, the villain bank?!" asks Urth.

Inside, we're greeted by a gnome that Urth tries to persuade to help, but a nat 1 has other ideas. Apparently exchanges for gems is on floor 16. Fortunately, we don't have to use stairs; there's a levitating force disc - and what's more, floor 16 appears to be only one floor up from where we are anyway!

Thorin's on high alert - too many problems before! - and notices spectral guardians. Penny wonders if they're any good, so tries to steal a gem off Thorin (!) but SOH 7 is no match for PER 23. "What're you doing with my - I mean *our* - gems?!" he asks, indignant; Penny gives up.

Various gems get converted. Some we'd converted *from* currency a while back since we didn't know what Athas used, but now we're converting those - and more - back.

Francesc is over it. She says, "I'm just going to fuck off and find something interesting to do" but Penny opts to stay; Thorin and Urth are in the Mood For Fuckery, it seems and how knows what they're going to do. She tries to ignore conversations about annual feels, interest rates, term reposits and more... In the end Thorin actually opens an account, deposits 50,000gp equivalent but even so ends up with 235,000gp directly in the party funds. We also get "5% off Aurora's Merchandise".

Later, Francesc wanders back and bumps into us outside the bank. She's spent some time stealthing around. She's learned something - there's a group here that are buying magical items and offering *very* good prices, far above market value. "The Incantarium". Francesc INS modifier +14, she realises this is *very* fishy!

Urth says, almost flippantly, "Hey, maybe that's related to the Spellfire thing?"

A sinking feeling. If that's true, **Vecna is already here**. "I think we might need a rain check for the pub..." says Penny, weakly.

Thorin and Urth talk while Penny and Francesc talk. TL;DR, Urth as a Bard is pretty sure that bars *are* good place to hear gossip. We decide to find our Barrior friend - he's called **Ben** - because we're not after the nearest bar, or even the best; we're after a bar where you might *overhear interesting stuff*.

He says, "Grease pit!"

Uuuh, sure. So we get into the carriage, and off we go. This one is a shorter trip, maybe 10 minutes, until we head into an area that would seem to be *The* food area. Multiple levels, some which seem suitable only for creatures that fly; it's very crowded, so all we can do is be taken to the edges. At street level(s) there are numerous food stalls, narrow streets, lots of people packed in.

He points to a second floor space where, in a fluorescent illusion are animated the words, "Grease pit".

It smells confusing, but mostly good, depending on preference; all different kinds of food smell, at times clashing, other times amazing. Once again we're told where we can find our guide/ride; he'll stay around for a while, but *does* tell us that if we stay overnight, it's best to avoid certain places he points out, but other streets have inns that are all good.

Inside it's again very crowded, but smells good. Tables that would usually seat maybe two, here have to seat four. There is a wall of nothing but kegs, apparently all from different breweries.

Right next to the counter is a person in a small booth and above, in Common - which we realise is written in many signs, even if spoken differently - says "Synden Messaging Service".

As the others find a seat, Penny asks what kind of messaging they do. It's general, including contacting people; a spell is cast onto parchment, she has to write a message - no more than 25 words. She writes, "It us. We have the next segment. We are somewhere called The Great Pit". Penny pays the 10gp fee and has to read out a thing in her head, the name and person, then the message; so she does that.

An almost immediately reply! "By the gods where have you been? Meet me as soon as you can at [address] - make haste!"

## LEVEL 15

(End of act 2, part 31)
