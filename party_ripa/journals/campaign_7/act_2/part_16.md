# RIPA: Act 2 Part 16
## Session 62 (2025-04-15)
### Athas (Outlands relative day 16)

We have just arrived on Athas, dressed as best we can guess the locals might be, with no metal and very little wood on our person - most of our belongings are left behind at the Outlands keep. We are getting our bearings, but before we start going anywhere, we quickly test out some things to see what kind of abilities, magic or magical items work here.

* The decanter works but only gives a very slow trickle, at most. Better than nothing.
* Thorin is confident he could change shape, but casting even a cantrip, he feels strangely disconnected.
* Arturo senses that use of Mage Armour would damage the world around him, possibly badly. But if he tried to cast at a more powerful level, it wouldn't have the potency that its casted level would suggest, but wouldn't cause the same kind of damage.

Thorin tries to Find Familiar via Wildshape, calling a raven. But there seems to be no available power to actually *manifest* this spirit into physical form; the spell fails.

There's a discussion about the piece of Redbud. Treants are hopefully not magic, per se, so it would be a question of planting something and letting it grow. Without magic power, we'd be waiting - ooh - some 100 years or so for them to reach a decent size!

And then to business. It's clear that at least *one* of us could have decent magic if we can find some greenery! So, that's first in the list.

Arturo has a vague idea of things that *could* be plants/greenery - the much more likely one of those is the other side of the big mesa; a long way away. But away from the mesa, through the pillars, he thought he saw somewhere with ruins that might have a water source. Perhaps 6 miles. If there is one, then it'll be contested. If we climbed the mesa somehow, then across the top is maybe 20 miles. Going around the base, it'd be more like 35 or so. We'd be in shade for a while. But that takes us away from the big city we saw while falling; the ruins, which may not have greenery or water, are in the right direction. So we set off through the rock pillars.

We have very lightweight cloaks to keep the sun off; we're covered as we travel through an exposed area in full sun between mesa and pillars. Thorin leads at a steady pace. The wind-blown silt we step on seems more like dust than sand; we sink in, leaving very obvious footprints. There's discussion about that which frays Penny's patience - "Let's just *go*!" - and she picks up pace, passing Thorin. Even so it's very slow going.

Thorin, perception 28. He can feel vibrations travelling the grains of sand. Tremors. They're coming from underneath; but it seems to be travelling along, rather than up towards us. Thorin warns and repeats a previous thought he'd had that over the mesa might be better! Arturo suggests high-casting Fly... Thorin considers a wildshape...

...and at that point, the ground beneath us starts to sink away. We're sinking down to knee-height and something bursts out from the side of the sunken area. It's a giant scorpion!  (This crystallises the decision pretty quickly; flight it is!) Dusty cracks over its carapace. This one looks... Skinny. And dusty. Not good. **It's right in front of Penny;** it strikes and matches AC. It gets a hold; grappled; 6 damage. Its second swipe and tail both glance off the armour.

Francesc tries Hunter's Mark; but it's the same thing as Thorin; just no apparent energy to back up the casting. She fires anyway and hits, 10 damage; hits again; 14 damage.

Arturo decides *not* to cast Fly and keeps running... But he at least tries to help pull Penny free on the way past (Athl 10); but that helps Penny - and despite a weak roll, it's *just* enough to slip out of its grasp.

Thorin wildshapes into a Quetz. He flies up and divebombs down to attack (with fly-by). Hits; grabs it and tries to drop it atop a rock pillar. The scorpion puts up a good fight, but can't get any hits at all. The rest of us try to drag ourselves back up and keep moving over the sand-dust towards the rock pillars. The scorpion gets a better angle and manages to hit Thorin-Quetz for 11 piercing and 19->9 poison damage. He gets well ahead of the rest of us but keeps going. Francesc stops for a moment to take careful aim and fires; nat 20 -> 24 damage; fires again; nat 20 again -> 20 damage. That kills it; Thorin feels it stop struggling - and just drops it.

By the time Francesc reaches it, she checks it over. Some of it is edible; not that there's much on it. With a stone knife, the plates are separated and some meat is found. The plates themselves would make bits of decent armour on themselves.

While this goes on Penny carefully takes the sunsword out of the bag of holding, covering it as much as she can with her body, and tries to light it, with the blade pointing down into the sand; and instead **there's a huge blast of light and the sand around turns to glass!** "OK, that's a no for sword unless we want to turn enemies into glass..." - but it *did* briefly seem to form a blade, just very, very hot. Arturo examines it. The sand has almost formed a glass sheath where the blade was. It's not radiant damage; definitely fire damage. Arcana 17. His theory is that the inability to connect to a divine magic source, it drew instead from the nearest source of power - and Tasha said that was the plane of elemental chaos. Penny, insight 21 - the sword activation normally feels like, well, rigtheousness; power; but she was sure it wasn't going to work when she used it. The conviction wasn't there. There wasn't enough command. So *if* there's a next time, there may need to be rather more concentration and effort. So if the power is divine, but there's no divine power here, how can that work at all? How does this connect to the plane of elemental chaos?

We end up with about 2 days of food and plates that could probably make a full suit of armour, if we had the time and skill. It takes about 15 minutes. Before we leave we start to see bugs coming out of the sand, making a beeline for spilled blood and flesh and, very soon, the whole thing is submerged. Just churned-up sand is left. Certainly not a lifeless desert - but much of it is hidden below the surface.

Now we fly. Thorin takes us up and over, but not too high; conspicuous; Penny looks around, perception 14; doesn't see too much. Arturo can't see past Penny! Francesc looks around too but doesn't see...

...a 24 to hit Thorin; 8 piercing damage; a large javelin moved *very* quickly and pierced the wing. He looks down just in time to see another javelin! And another 8 damage, this time in the other wing. He saw, at least, that it came from somewhere *within* the rock pillars, low down (couldn't see where) and starts to fly upwards as quick as he can. These javelins seem to have been very fast and very accurate. Francesc can make out movement in the shadows - cloth-wrapped figures hiding; the more she looks the more she sees. And she fires right back! Hits; 11 damage. Cries of alarm from below and people below start running towards the one who fell. Now Francesc fires again - trying for a warning shot. 32 to hit! She aims to bring a cloak of someone - and it works. The arrow bends and twists, pulling off the headdress. Large, wild-looking eyes, pupils suddenly shrinking in the light. A tight topknot with hair missing a bit on the top. 4-4.5 feet tall.

INT save for Francesc; 11 - 9 psychic damage. A sort of scream in her head; a scream of hatred. She seems to freeze, stop moving; Penny pushes 5hp in hands-on, but it doesn't seem to help. Penny ADV religion 22, knows that the healing worked but - wait, where did that come from? It worked! Maybe there was a risk of - who knows, elemental damage? So are these religions effects or not?

(Thorin reminds us all that *he wanted to go the other way*!)

Well, *he's* the one with a javelin in each wing. He'll have to set down as they're doing more damage as he tries to fly. We drop to a higher rock pillar and land on the top. It's clear that other things have landed here too. The javelins are pulled free. They're reasonably well made, but nothing special. They're not magical but we see that the ends are flat with a notch - so it seems they're being launched, perhaps by some kind of small ballista-like mechanism. That could be for hunting? Perimeter protection?

Francesc still seems to be stunned. Arturo tries slapping her face - at first it doesn't work, but then - INT save 21 - she snaps out of it. But prior to that, for 30s or so, all she heard was the scream.

Against Thorin's objections we try to press on, flying higher up this time. The landscape around is more varied than we realised; undulations, rock formations jutting up, canyons. The ruins at the edge of this strange stone forest are easy to see now. There are quite a few trees around it - but that gives a sense of scale. We realise they're palm-like trees but the now-ruined buildings are truly huge, dwarfing the trees for scale.

We get close. We're certainly not alone. Down on the ground, some movement is heading in our general direction, albeit slowly. We can't see any water immediately, but there must be some; trees grow here. There'a a ruined temple without a roof and that looks like a good place to land. We set down.

It's been an hour or so in the sun. CON saves. Penny's aura helps; how? Thorin-Quetz has no cover, disadvantage; but still, 27. Francesc, 7! Penny, 27 (nat 20). Arturo - 19 -> 17 due to exhaustion. This sun is - something else! It's like sunstroke in 5 minutes... Francesc gains exhaustion too. And we haven't drunk water in an hour. We do so, hastily! Thorin turns into himself, lest his water demands be too great.

Around us - ruins of a once-beautiful religious building. Ground, cracked now with parts sinking, used to be covered in glass mosaic tiles. Beautiful dioramas. There's writing that none of us recognise; Arturo tries (up)casting Comprehend Languages while Francesc looks at the mosaics - History 21 - and Penny looks at the frescoes - Religion 25. Penny notices Arturo casting the spell - he seems to draw magic in, weave it, then release it back. Thorin notices all life around him quiver for a minute, as if it were going to wither, but then relax back again.

* Penny: The frescoes describe *multiple* gods. Pantheon. Pantheons even? Most gods have an animal / animalistic form. Most are humanoid-like, huge, but with animal heads. There is an indication of an authoritarianism - small people, commoners, worshipping at the feet of these gods, all around them. Gods hold out their arms, blessing with water or food or knowledge - that kind of thing! But the frescoes can't be *that* old. If it had been hundreds of years, the sand would've scoured them away. It seems that they must only have been exposed to elements for a few decades.

* Arturo: The wall holds a poem. Each line talks about a different deity. There is an hierarchy, with a High God; "The Risen One" / "The Enlightened One" / "The Man That Conquered Creation And Was Made A Dragon" - **Karnak**. His people built Him a city and named it after Him.

* Francesc: The mosaic look like a monumental art effort, putting down all this coloured glass. It seems like the diorama at the centre is a representation of paradise. But all around the edges it changes - fire, brimstone, devils, desert. So - the middle is an oasis. Ah! And that middle part is a temple complex, **underground** - and there, blue and green tiles depicting water.

Once we compare notes it seems our path is obvious. See what's underground. Thorin was already onto that, by chance; looking at the architecture, perception 16. There's a lot that has collapsed. But the ground is not level. It slopes down towards the left-rear of the temple. That's not by design - it seems to have sunk. Tremorsense indicates nothing moving around us yet, within 60ft at least. We think we're a fair way ahead of our assumed-pursuers, and want to take advantage of that.

Thorin calls us over to the area. With Francesc's help, Penny searches. Investigation ADV 22. Dex saves! Francesc 21, Penny 19. We're digging around in the corner and the tiled floor completely gives way; we both fall. We take half damage. 6->3. We land about 20ft down on jagged rock. Thorin creeps up to the edge, looks down and goes - "HA!"

Down below, Francesc has dark vision - **a glistening pool of water**. Penny - sharp intake of breath. "This is... Unfathomably valuable in this world."

Arturo comes down by rope, Thorin close behind.

A square, shallow pool of water that's part of the template complex is being fed by a gentle trickle of water, coming through a ceremonial kind of spring - four tiers of bowls. That, itself, is fed from _somewhere_; there's a carved edifice of someone holding a jar, as if tipping the water. Arturo goes over to see if there is a way behind. There's a full slab of stone set into the wall with only a small opening. It looks designed for a larger amount of water; the opening is only large enough for maybe a mouse.

Thorin puts his hand into the water, trying to feel - anything! And he's kind of shocked. This water is fouled! Poisoned.

How sad! That certainly explains why there aren't more people down here. And when we look closely, we can see bones of small animals around the pool; they must have tried to drink anyway in desperation.

Thorin points out how right he's been all the time.

Nature check. Thorin - no. Francesc - no. Penny pushes them aside. 27! It smells like it's been contaminated because something died in it. We need to get behind that slab of rock somehow. We figure we'll move it. Penny tries to move it alone but can't. Thorin moves into assist and he gets ATHL 19; that's it! It starts to move, as he's almost falling backwards ("I loosened it!" says Penny).

Thorin peers behind. A collector carving of sorts, behind which is a manmade channel. It's crawl-able just about. It goes to a natural reservoir, or jagged pool. Thorin crawls in with "encouragement" by Penny. We've not seen him crawl into tunnels before - he's avoided racial stereotyping; it doesn't help that Penny and Francesc sing a rousing "Hi Hooooo!" as the goes in.

Inside, there's a grotto. A creature there has been killed; it has died from a combination of poisoning and necrotic damage. It may well have ventured into nearby caves and been attacked, then crawled back here and died. Either way this is a large creature, crocodile-like; whatever attacked it was *nasty*. And as Thorin tries to move it, he sees that this was *magical* damage. There is withering around the necrotic damage. It's also odd that it hasn't completely decayed. The areas that *are* decayed seem decayed by nature of the damage it took. It hasn't decayed from death. Either it was recent; or things just don't decay the same way here. We just don't know.

Either way there could be something *very* dangerous in the caverns.

The best we can do is try to drag this nasty carcass with ropes and move the stone further away so that we can get it out. We actually take advantage of the opportunity to make the gap bigger. Penny, ATHL 18, manages to slide it out enough. We get to work trying to move the carcass out. Thorin realises his Tremorsense expired ages ago; he re-(up)casts and realises that people are now entering the temple above. Could be up to dozen.

Penny tries to purify the pool behind first - 10ft x 10ft or thereabouts; that should work in one spell - Purify Food & Drink - at L2, per Arturo's instructions. But there's no Meliki, so where does this come from? Religion? It can't; no gods. Religion 1 + 14. Her magic has always been pure faith - nothing happens. There's just no power there. So now she thinks - well, the sword drew on the elemental plane and water is an element! Can she "feel" how the sunsword felt and retry? Rivers, life, baptism, purity. Water. She casts again. *This* works. But as she casts, she feels a bizarre tear in the fabric of reality - and torrent of water comes gushing out! That just washes out the grotto before it stops. From the outside, everyone sees a sudden explosion of water outwards, some of them pushed backwards. Penny is soaked through.

Echoing down from the tunnel to the grotto, the rest of the party hears a distant weak call of "...sorry!"

Francesc says that we should collect bowls of water and hold them outstretched, as if for a peace offering. We hear strange clicks and taps, as if there's a non-verbal form of communication. Then one of the creatures suddenly drops down the hole, holding a leather strap in one hand and a shell in the other. Curious. It looks around, a glint of reflective eyes, wide; it sees us a stops, crouches.

Thorin tries Common Sign Language to try and show that we're peaceful. We don't have arms raised. Penny is emerging from the tunnel, soaking wet. The person down here clicks; people above stop; then a bit of movement, one more; the person down below looks up, steps aside and holds up the shell. We realise it's actually a shield; another one comes down. Thorin and Francesc hold out bowls, with water.

This new arrival is older, shorter, 4ft tall. If on Toril this would be a large halfling. They seem confident but very watchful and hold a bone of some large creature, carved with many runes. They look like, as far as we can ever guess - a druid.

They look at us. Three of us dry, a - fighter? - soaking wet. They examine the bowl, pull back, go in close, prod it so a bit spills; then haltingly, as if this isn't something they often do, tries to vocalise something. But the sounds make no sense to us. Thorin takes a punt and tries Druidic - "We share this water with you".

The creature looks astonished!

In very broken druidic: "How... you... know me?"

"You look to be one with nature."

The creature turns to the other, and looks up; makes a sign. There are the sounds of people moving in and slowly, they come down.

The older creature is, we think male. The stick is held up, then to the side, and raised to the forehead. The other hand reaches out towards Thorin's hand, palm-up, as if questioning. One word. "Trust?" Thorin answers, "Trust". And then there's a *flood* of thought! Ah. **These are telepathic beings.**

Thorin receives lots of questions, all at once. He answers as best he can by imagining images.

He learns from a resulting to-and-fro that this dead creature was *an elder druid* that was guarding the water and got attacked. They've not had access to the water since. **Agents of Karnak** must surely be wanting to retake the area for some reason, they opine.

Is there an imminent threat? Who knows. The day is one if it ends with the same number of people as they started. These people consider themselves to be halflings. They're very curious about Thorin; why would a - dwarf-as-concept - risk "not being on Karnak's side". We get the impression of racial divides - that dwarves are always on Karnak's side. Then the want to know who are the masters and who are the slaves!

Thorin can't stop his thoughts briefly flashing to, "They're all my slaves!"

But they can't understand that. How are we all together? They recognise Arturo as someone who uses magic (but in their minds this only ever involves drawing from the land). They start to assume Penny is some sort of holy person, but they don't know the nature of that and don't know she can use magic.

Thorin tries to convey the notion of fighting not for one particular person or nation, but a wider group. They chuckle and tell the others; they laugh too!

"So you *are* crazy! We fight for this. It has taken generations of us to fight for just *this*. And the four of you want to fight for the entire world?"

Thorin is telling us what they're saying and they say we "wear our illusion uncomfortably" - we figure they've figured out we are maybe from somewhere *else*. Francesc spots the one she hit - it looks injured, but not bloodied; these people are hard. Penny decides to tip her hand and reveal she can use magic; religion 19, which she doesn't know it but is important; she walks up, puts hand on - they flinch but don't pull away - and heals for the 11 points of damage. They seem shocked, but not because of the healing - because the area is now wet!

They invite us to take part in the burial ritual for the Guardian. "I would be honoured" says Thorin.

We learn that the network of springs was *defiled* by this temple; it was built by Karnak. We don't need to return the stone to get the flow into the pool sorted again - quite the contrary. The rites will be performed on "pure" ground, away from this place. We soon find out that most of what they do is underground, through a network of tunnels. The stone forest is important to them as they can move around above ground with unusual stealth.

On the surface, rites are performed and someone manages to undo some kind of curse - and this **corpse turns back into a halfling**. A pyre is built; the corpse is burned.

We all ultimately open ourselves up telepathically. It takes a while to understand; this is a physical, violent culture, through necessity. Kill or be killed. And shoot first, ask questions later; the chances of killing someone virtuous are negligible!

Some are suspicious still and don't get involved, staying at the periphery.

We notice that many of them just do things with their minds. Move objects, even start a fire; psyonics. Arturo is very interested and asks about it. As the sun sets, we learn that this is when "life begins" - during the day, you must hide or get "sun sickness".

* They believe their innate abilities are inherited
* Many can speak with minds but not all
* They do have the non-verbal taps and scratches that we'd guessed at earlier - easily mistaken for desert beetles

It seems this ability has evolved to fill the gap left by magic. So this is *not* a magical power; it's something entirely new.

Thorin desperately tries to move things with his mind. Bright red, sweating; nothing. "Bugger", he mutters!

Later we realise we should share the scorpion meat. We killed a child of the god **Cli** apparently! This makes them warm to us more.

They see we are very tired; especially since the "day is just beginning". But if we do that, we'd be out of sync and awake in the day, but Arturo *must* sleep. We figure we'll over-sleep, waste a day kind of, try to get sync'd up.

Thorin persuasion - sharing watered-down beer - ADV, low; their druid, who gets drunk easily, start ribbing us about "protecting the world". "How you gonna protect the world? You don't have *the gift*." So Thorin decides to wildshape. There's enough shape for an elephant - he leads people up to the surface and shifts. The druid smiles. "You *are* connected - somehow. But you are an orphan. You belong to nowhere." "I would connect with your ancestors here." "But do you know what that comes with? The responsibilities that they bear?" "No. But we are aligned, in the sense of protection."

The druid shakes their head. "What you need is to be adopted - by the earth. But you must defend it with your life. You must do its will. That is what it means to be a protector - to be a Guardian. Do you wish to be a Guardian?"

"Yes".

"These are not bonds to be made lightly. I ask a second time. Do you, Thorin, wish to be a guardian of this land, here?"

Insight 23. Nothing sinister. But there's a ritual; they're serious and there are consequences and responsibilities. This second question is *part* of the ritual.

"Yes. I will be a protector of this land."

The druid shares that with his people; a murmur of excitement. They open channels of magic and suddenly - Thorin can feel everything. The land around. A hum. A waiting, a rushing ocean of another side of a wall; a storm building just beyond hearing.

"Do you willingly - a third time - take on the mantle of a protector and Guardian of the sacred life force of this world?"

**"Yes."**

That storm breaks. Thorin is flooded by the connection to the oasis; every plant, to every leaf or blade of grass. It feels like the land is enriched. A cheer goes up; cups are raised, more drink; the oasis itself *is* increased in vitality. Things pent up and severed by the attack on the Guardian here, which attempted to cut off this oasis from the rest of the network, are all reconnected.

Thorin realises that he's very connected. But if anything attacks this land - he would be very compelled to return and defend. If it were destroyed... Well, bad.

"I'm glad *three* of us wanted to come here given we got everything we wanted" says Francesc, in Thorin's direction!

Thorin also says, "We could like to bring some of our own magic to the land..." and nods to Arturo; the Ent fragment is produced. **It will be planted here.**

We end the night with celebration and a long rest.

(End of act 2, part 16)
