# RIPA: Act 2 Part 8
## Session 53 (2024-12-10)
### About 4 miles from Trade Gate, Outlands, Sigil day 7 (maybe)

It took a long time and a lot of effort, but we have acquired the second rod segment and, at least for now, we have a new companion in the second segment's previous protector and courier, Captain Inda. Tagging along are the Daveras trio - Daveras, blink dog Icasa and treant Redbud.

We think it's the 7th day within the wider Sigil domain but we know that time does not work on the Astral Sea in the same way as on material planes, and we have not yet had the chance to verify a date. It's all relative and approximate anyway, since the discontinuities we all experienced after the fall of Toril.

Arriving into the sky aboard the Scarlet Arrow, we spot something impossible - the red tower that formed the body of our presumed-lost keep on Toril, walking upon great mechanical legs. Hasty goodbyes are said and we elect to use a new (and only) charge on the Helm to bring everyone down into the path of the walking tower, about 3-4 miles out from Trade Gate. The trio of druid Daveras, treant Redbud and blink dog Icasa have elected to come along too. The sudden appearance of the eight of us must make quite a strange sight for whoever is in the tower, but perhaps not so strange as the impossible; we get the tower's attention, it stops, and out run the familiar faces of Mayastan, Vilhamena and Alfred, who we thought had died on Toril in their own battle with Vecna at Candlekeep.

"We have so much to tell you" they shout as the run!

The two groups meet. Lots of questions from both sides are being voiced almost all at the same time; Arturo suggests we head indoors where it might be safer. Redbud listens at the window!

Inside things are a bit messed up (which isn't surprising). Arturo gets inside first. The basement sections of the tower *do* seem to be included albeit with damage. External buildings that had been built against the tower are of course absent. Arturo runs upstairs, to check on the teleportation circle. Things are scattered around on the floor obscuring it, but otherwise, it's intact. Bedrooms have  been used as dumping grounds for broken furniture and so forth.

Meanwhile, as soon as everyone else has just got inside, Penny in astonishment asks - "How are you alive?!"

Mayastan says he Plane Shifted us, using the power of the teleportation circle. He didn't even consciously do it, he claims. "There must have been some kind of ward in place? It activated, and I could direct it". Arturo is coming down the stairs and overhears this; he's not sure if Mayastan has that kind of magical ability and is suspicious. Insight 16. He's not sure *how* it could be done. Thorin enquires more deeply but Mayastan repeats he *didn't* figure it out, it just happened! Things had gone very badly wrong at Candlekeep; a few managed to run back and get inside, intending to find a way to call for more help, probably via the teleportation circle; but then - whatever it was on the tower, just activated. "I sensed that I could steer it - somewhat - I didn't intend to end up here! I just wanted to go somewhere safe. We appeared here; crashed into the side of a hill; it has taken a while to figure out the rest of it. I don't know why but the castle even grew its own legs!"

Francesc insight 20. Sounds outlandish and doesn't add up but Mayastan doesn't seem to be lying.

In the end we're all in our party thinking it might be similar to the strange event that happened to us. Someone or something intervened, but we don't know who or why.

Arturo is Messaging his theories and it aligns with Penny so she voices a brief version of what happened in our case. But Mayastan is sure the tower itself was involved and *he* was the source of magic that brought it here, even if he doesn't understand how. The tower, for its part, seems to move with a mind of its own. They don't wander far if it stops, because it might start at any time. He has no idea if it can be controlled.

Certainly, Alfred and Vilhamena for their part corroborate the story. They chased after Mayastan and found him in the teleportation room casting a spell, which to them seemed *very* powerful. A bubble formed around the whole tower and it "shifted away", in their words. It even had bits of rock and earth from our world attached to it.

Penny is starting to wonder if Vecna had in that. They would have no idea they were being used either. Arturo then Messages the same thing. So we hand wave the story when asked how *we* got here. There are truths, omissions and one or two lies. Mayastan keeps asking questions. Francesc, insight 27, knows that Alfred and Vilhamena are very happy to see us. Mayastan is *outwardly* happy but as time is going is getting increasingly suspicious. He might almost be betraying an attitude of not being sure if we are who we say we are.

Francesc voices it; "Well, I don't think you trust us; but I'm not sure I trust you either. It was the same with the four of us when we re-met. But what we gonna do?!" (Rhetorical)

The discussion goes on. Mayastan suggests dinner. See how it goes. Francesc, who's mostly just hanging back and observing, sees that Alfred wants to say something but isn't sure when - so she just barks at him, "Out with it!"

"Well I don't want to talk out of place... This is up to Mayastan to decide when is appropriate to tell you about..." - but Mayastan rolls his eyes and says, "Well you've already revealed something! Look... You're not the only ones who have been here. But for security reasons I wanted to make sure you are who you are, before you meet the others who have been here. And I'm not sure I trust you enough yet."

Penny decides to at least say where our blink dog and treant came from, along with Inda! That doesn't help much. But Arturo points out we did know his last words from his Message to Penny; this, actually, does convince him. He must be confident that Message is quite "secure".

Somewhat reluctantly he leads us up to the teleportation circle, clears stuff away and casts Sending somewhere (so see Arturo and Thorin). Curiously, Alfred and Vilhamena have not stayed. Maystan then explains, "Well, we appeared here a few months ago. We've encountered others who have been wanting to help with whatever means they have..." - then the teleportation circle glows, a person appears and the circle fades.

A female human, mid back-length tidy, sharply cut reddish-brown hair. She wears a stereotypical pointy hat with wide brim in a dusky blue colour with a dusky blue robe or gown. She holds a staff, which appears to terminate in an old-fashioned, tied broom! She's maybe late 30s, early 40s. She looks around; "Oh, right! OK" she says, "I guess you're the alleged owners of this tower?"

Penny bristles but Arturo puts on the charm and introduces himself. Penny, history 21, she's seen pictures of this person in a book before; it's puzzling... She'd also seen an apparition of this person in the giant underground library - **a younger version of Tasha**. She extends a hand to shake Arturo's, "Delighted to meet you. I am Natasha." Penny: "Oh, so you *are* Tasha?!" "Last I checked!" and Arturo responds, "Last *we* checked, you were older, or dead."

We ask how she's here. "I escaped. It's complicated. I was trapped in a mirror dimension. The only safe place to escape to - though I admittedly did not do it entirely on my own - was to Sigil. However..." - she looks at Mayastan. "You don't look like you trust them! So why am I here?"

He says, "I think I trust them as much as I ever will. As much as you can really trust anyone in these times."

"Not quite good enough."

Arturo says there are many unanswered questions we can't answer but should work together. She asks in turn if we're in control of our actions and know what we're doing it for. Arturo says "Yes!" and she seems satisfied. Thorin says, "As much we can. We have a better handle on it now than we did in Toril". "Hmm, OK". Penny says; "Well, nobody knows if they truly act of their own free will. We were working for different people and weren't sure if we trusted them. So now we act for ourselves. We believe in our quest and believe it's important enough to not trust anyone at face value - especially a famous wizard that just appears out of nowhere, in our tower, which shouldn't even be here."

Tasha offers to fill in some gaps!

* Sigil is closed. We did hear that, so we nod.
* This is a big problem - she says that's where everything is; where her books are, where "our" base of operations is.
* Arturo asks who "our" is. A group of thinkers - "well, meddlers really!" - they meddle in affairs across the planes possess magical power, get involved in things they maybe shouldn't!
* OK so that sounds like *us*! "Exactly!" she says. "We understand each other!"

Mayastan asks Tasha to clear the circle... Because "the only other one of us that managed to make it out" is coming through. They don't have a name for their group. "That's for amateurs!" The circle glows and another woman appears. She's very tall and fair, elven, maybe in her human-equivalent-of-60s, emitting a soft moonlight glow, holding a very "extra" twisting staff of white wood or ivory towards the top which is heavily engraved with flowers and leaves, wearing a long, gold and white wizard's robe. She looks like she should be taken seriously but we've no idea who she is!

She greets Tasha and Mayastan. "You must be the four my sister told me about!" - **it's Alustriel Silverhand**. OK, so she knows about us; but that means her sister did too; but we ran out of time... So our contact at Waterdeep - Mert - really did do his job! But then the attack started.

And then we learn that Leirol was trying to find us *before* Mert even contacted her. How?! Well, we are of a certain notoriety - and the four of you are *extremely* hard to find (and at this Francesc lets loose to Penny about wearing the amulet!)

"Four people who feature heavily in stories by people who meet them but are *impossible* to scry are always of interest!"

Penny asks, "So, do you know what we were looking for?"

"Yes. I do." She looks to Mayastan... And casts a spell which somehow cleans up the entire room and sets everything right! "I don't think we have the luxury of time right now. You are talking about the Rod Of Seven Parts. We have also been studying it. We believe we may have figured out where a few of these parts are." "*Way* ahead of you!" says Penny. "No. I mean - *exactly* where they are."

They've been scattered and some have moved; they aren't where they were. We realise our poem, then, might be out of date.

"Now I know you have one of them. Maybe more by now?"

(Penny thinks, "To hell with it") "Two"

Alustriel asks about the people outside. TL;DR, she thinks we can trust Inda but - **the others could be spies!**

She gestures to Tasha and Mayastan. "We three would like to compare notes and make sure that everyone is on the right track. Now, *if* you have indeed secured two pieces of the rod and they *are* actually pieces of the rod then I would say that, together, **we have a head start**. We could even have the upper hand."

Thorin asks she has any pieces; no, but she says she knows where to are. Arturo insight 31. She *does* know where two are but is being careful to not give away which ones. "Which pieces? The ones we already have?!" "I highly doubt it! The first one you got was hidden on Toril. I don't know where
you got the second piece from, but two others would never have been released from the safety of the Two Prisons - well, a harsh word, of the two places they were hidden... They were hidden on planes that are *very* difficult to get to. And that was the point!"

She means the "closed" planes of Eberron and Athas, we realise and she knows, she says, that Eberron is our next destination. Yes. But *we* know Vecna is already there. This is news to the wizards!

We also saw Athas via Vecna, we point out, but they don't believe us. They insist that plane is fully sealed off... We describe our "portal machine" vision. Tasha gets very animated - "I told you! He's using the secrets he takes to power a portal machine!"

We head downstairs and Inda is invited in. There is more exposition. We don't know if Vecna is searching for rods but did seem particularly interested in Eberron. We think though that he hasn't found whatever was hidden there. Perhaps it's just a matter of time or perhaps something else stops him; apparently the rod there protects itself.

But if *we* could pick it up, why couldn't they? Hmm. Are they following us? **More reasons to put the amulets back on**.

But Alustriel says, "We can't keep hiding. We need to use discretion, but if they are looking for segments too then we're probably on the clock. We must find them and beat the other side."

The problem is that the rod segment at Eberron is probably in an old war zone (as we saw via the second rod vision). "It seems to be evading detection. We know it's there, but we don't know more - we can't sense it - which indicates it's still in those lands." "Why is that the case?" asks Penny. "There is an effect in those lands that defeats our ability to detect and sense anything. It's a magical mess." Penny says, "Kind of, spell plague but worse?" "Hmm. Well, a little. Yes."

Alustriel says "Our spy on Eberron has kept a record of when and how that piece has been used." (*Used?!*) "There are two possibilities. We'll require a few days to work it out and obtain everything we need to do that. But I *can* punch through the shield that keeps Eberron closed from the rest of the Multiverse. It would be easier in Sigil, but we can't get in, so we have to find other means! I can get you to the Capital and you can figure out things there - get more information, investigate on the ground - we can't do that; our contact has gone silent."

Suddenly Penny thinks of something. *Did* Vecna kill people on Toril? **No, they have been imprisoned**. Their spirits will bend to will of Vecna; those who don't will suffer torment, or death. He's a tyrant.

"If we were to defeat him, would that free those spirits?"

"Well, it would break the hold he has on them..." but Tasha says, "Well, he can't be killed, but we can cage him and put him back where he belongs; either way, he would lose dominion over people on those planes. **It would take a while to undo the damage but it *is* possible.**"

While Penny's head spins - **Toril is not lost?** - we show the information we gathered on the rods from the giant stone tablets. Is the order correct? Well, she points out that each piece of the rod tells you the location of the next piece. Well, I suppose we've seen that. We check notes...

* Speak/commune/communicate - as we know
* A great illusion, all-encompassing
* Grow back/Rebuild/Regenerate
* Portal/gateway
* Upside down/Reversal
* To see a road/Find a path
* Double/Duplicate as it pertains to creatures

...the above is correct. As for the *fourth* segment:

* Grow back/Rebuild/Regenerate - a rune for a deathly shadow / Shadow Fell **NO, that's Athas**

...but once we find the Eberron piece it'll tell us where the Fourth is. The trio of wizards will work on getting us a way there, so once we're done on Eberron we will be able to travel there.

Penny asks what would happen if we went to Toril. We'd enter a world where for everyone there "Vecna is and has always been the only omnipotent, powerful being, the most powerful ruler, the only deity."

So would that be the case on Eberron, as an additional danger to us? Well, they're sure Eberron hasn't fallen. Despite losing touch with their contact there. Tasha chips in, "I'm sure Eberron hasn't fallen - but Athas is my speciality! I argue that it fell before Toril. A very, very long time ago. I didn't think it was Vecna before, but I'm starting to think it probably was - that he did his 'field tests' there. It would certainly explain a lot. I can't say for sure. I need to do more research."

Arturo asks if the three know why Vecna might form alliances with demons. Specifically demons, not devils. But they fought alongside them. "Then he must command them. Why? I don't know - something else for us to dig into!"

Alustriel is feeling exposed in this location and must depart. We must decide, before she returns, on whether we want to go to the Capital or directly into the war zone - but that might be unpredictable. It  would save us some travel. It means we don't get to do any investigation in the Capital first. She bids farewell and departs.

Tasha remains. "Do you have anything to drink?!"

We break out the (rather old) cask. She asks for details of "what" we have met. It seems purely academic.

Why didn't Vecna find the third segment? Tasha thinks it could be because - the Mournland is big. It is what's left of the nation of Cyre, so a whole nation. Arturo asks if it interferes with scrying; well yes, could be. If so we might need to amplify the power of even the second rod segment to "zero in" on the third segment's precise location.

Penny, since Francesc is giving her "looks", asks - whatever Alustriel might say about no longer hiding - if wearing our amulets is useful. Tasha opines that this is useful if we think we might do things which make ourselves targets - that is, "make a lot of noise" so someone might be looking for us in the first place. Well, maybe, we don't really know in advance.

Arturo wears his amulet. Only Penny remains. She faces a difficult choice.

We talk about where we want to go to the city or the war zone. The balance of opinion is - the war zone.

Thorin then thinks about money. We're low! Could we sell any of our wares. Arturo tries to "tempt" Tasha by asking if she wants to eat god flesh?! However, when he produces the chunk of meat - it's already turned into a (large) chunk of the precious stone.

Tasha suggests Trade Gate!

She then asks if we still want the tower to walk. It's her spell! We figure, well, near Trade Gate and settling there? That'll be helpful for Redbud and co., too. Tasha casts something, which will direct the tower accordingly.

Before departing, she asks us to make sure we take notes if we encounter any powerful demons. It seems the association with Vecna has piqued her interest.

We catch up with everyone else. The tower beings its lumbering walk towards Trade Gate; some follow on foot, some onboard. Eventually, a certain distance away, it settles 3 miles out. **This is our new home, it seems.**

Daveras and the Treant ask if want a grove planting; yeah, sure! Essentially we're re-establishing the bastion. We keep the rooms as-is. Surprisingly, some progress had been made on some tasks before and even after Vecna's attack - we have an extra Greater Potion Of Healing.

We head into Trade Gate. It's The Shopping Episode!

"Savvy" roll - INT-based Insight. Penny 19+8, 27. Francesc, 20+mods; both high; we realise we shouldn't just march into town and try to sell the big new chunk of stone. The Hadozi might be there and be very annoyed! Turns out, after asking around, the Hadozi acted fast. They've already sold (we don't know the price) and they've already headed elsewhere via gateway to raise another crew. Lucky.

D100 -> 59 (Thorin). We decide we need to try and sell all the pieces; our 30% share from the Hadozi trade plus the big piece that Arturo "created". And when all is done - Trade Gate prices standardised, so no bartering - a giant **55,900 gold pieces** equivalent, in Trade Gate currency.

Thorin does not stop complaining about the 30/70 split the decision the whole time. We take exchange that as platinum and gold. Whatever they use at Eberron, it's unlikely to be Trade Gate blue chips! We also take the opportunity to exchange some of our large stash of copper from our earlier adventures, converting to gold and silver, but keeping some copper in reserve.



### Trade Gate, Sigil days 8 and 9 (ignoring possible Wildspace travel discontinuities)

We turn to individual pursuits while waiting for Alustriel. Arturo wants to enchant an arrow which can explode as a fireball when it hits. While tinkering, wild magic happens. First, a flumph appears! It encourages him for about a minute then disappears. Later, he has a sudden flash back to his time in limbo - he freaks out, terrified, running around the tower and garden for a while. The rest of the party don't really think anything of it - just Arturo! Thorin later joins in to help. During *that* time, unbeknownst to them both, there's a period where they're vulnerable to any kind of piercing attack - which fortunately doesn't happen. For all of this tinkering and wild magic, Arturo becomes aware that he as a bit of strange control over his cantrips! He might be able to change the damage type; perhaps change the range; he thinks he can create one of his own. **And since he's been clumsily using Message for individuals around his party, he realises he can in fact Message them all simultaneously. Just his party, but should be very useful.**

Francesc, meanwhile, hunts. She gets a surprising amount of food out of the Outlands and finds various poisonous items. She spends the next day trying to craft poisons, ending up with a potent vial. Thorin helps here too.

Thorin also helps with replanting, helping with Plant Growth and so-on. A mile radius around the town becomes particularly verdant!

Penny reads about Eberron: The war that created the land we're going into. Our own library via Mayastan has some information.

  - Five nations were involved; they call it a civil war as it was an empire of nations
  - There was a cataclysm which created the Mournland, *wiping out* the entire kingdom of Cyre
  - Happened in the middle of the war, roughly
  - Cyre had been winning prior
  - There were rumours they had developed some extremely powerful weapon
  - They are also the ones who developed some of the technology that led to other nations creating **Warforged** - sentient, mechanical beings
  - Francesc asks, "Do you mean Modons?" - no, MUCH bigger! We are shown drawings
  - The capital city nation had created Colossi, 50-100ft tall mechanical siege machines powered by very powerful magic items
  - They managed to use a rare artefact they discovered, which had been in the Archives, to create a sort of bio-mechanical power source for Llandro, a particularly vast colossus, which was an answer to Cyre's terrible weapon
  - They intended to teleport this into Cyre and force a surrender
  - But... And nobody knows exactly what happened... The cataclysm happened.

Later, when we reconvene and discuss, Arturo thinks that power source was probably the Rod segment. But Penny suggests it might be Cyre's weapon - though our poem would make either option a bit odd given its "upside down / reversal" power. Could have been twisted. Who knows.

On the afternoon of Day 9, Alustriel reappears at the teleport circle. "I've figured out a way! Not the smoothest means of travel but it will get you there... It's 'old' magic. Have you decided where you want to go?" We say - the Mournland. The city might help us investigate stuff, but we're not even sure what we'd investigate! The Mourland carries risk too but it's closer to where we want to go.

We bid farewell to our Bastion residents, head outside and stand close together at Alustriel's behest. She ties a thin, satin ribbon around all four of us and spends a minute casting. At the end, we feel the area around us start to - well, shatter! It's as if we wore spectacles and they broke. Reality itself seems to break, Alustriel included. Pieces fall away. As the last piece falls, we start to fall with it - it feels like falling through air and, by reflex, Arturo casts Feather Fall, but it does nothing and he thinks that this must mean we are *not* really falling - despite it feeling as if so.

D100 -> 56 vs DM's 40, which we're told is a good thing...

### Eberron (!), the Mournland; Outlands relative day 9 (afternoon there)

We hit the ground suddenly, only without impact. The satin ribbon breaks and the four of us tumble outwards, as if the only reason we had been standing upright was the ribbon around us. DEX saves:

* Thorin 24 - rolls elegantly and lands on his feet
* Francesc 23 - a forward flip, landing on feet
* Penny 20 (!) - a clank of armour, a slightly more awkward forward roll, but upright
* Arturo 8 - falls flat!

(Penny helps up Arturo)

Thick fog - smoke? Smog? - is around us, a consistent layer. It's daytime, before or after noon since the sun is high but not above, and easy to see as a light grey disc against the dark grey fog. Francesc notices close by - with 30ft - a 15ft tall oval portal! It's a black mirror, almost - shimmering, undulating. Arturo tries to push through a potato using Mage Hand. When the hand is pulled back, it does work, but the potato is not there.

The landscape at our feet is charred. There is debris everywhere; chunks of masonry or otherwise unidentified lumps of stone; machinery, pieces of what seem to be armour, other fragments; what few bits of vegetation seem to be present are all blackened and dead.

Arturo casts a Clairvoyance spell up some 100ft, above the fog layer. It's hard to say, but he thinks we must be a few *days* of travel from where, in the very far distance, the fog seems to end and metal towers of what he assumes must be a city are visible, glinting in the sun. Nearer by, poking out of the fog here and there are bits of what he recognises as, most likely, broken colossi. In addition though there are jagged, sawn-off pieces of landscape, as if the ground itself had shattered in a manner similar to glass and been left as huge, jagged, scrambled pieces in certain areas. This stretches for *miles*. In the other direction from the city he's not even sure where the mist ends.

At this report, Thorin tries a Familiar - a Hawk. It flies up. Perception 22. He notes that many of the damage seems to indicate a single blast of force headed _away_ from where we are. There's a very visible landmass a distance away, a sort of sheared, damaged hill rising above the fog. Height is very hard to judge. The fog rises a bit with it, clinging to the sides upwards. 50, 60 miles away?

Penny is meanwhile looking at the portal. She didn't read anything about it. Arturo starts drawing up a map, marking the mountain/hill, distant city and portal. Even so, it will be difficult to navigate from down in the fog (mechanical: Survival rolls are at Disadvantage).

With that in mind and given it's _right there_ we consider the portal. We conduct an additional experiment. We roll a potato through, tied to a rope. We wait a few seconds and then pull back on the rope. Surprisingly - the rope, complete with loop at the end, pulls back but - no potato!

Thorin takes a risk. He asks his hawk to fly in, be careful, get through and fly straight back.

The hawk flies in. We wait... Minutes seem to pass, but it's probably only a few seconds. Then - amazingly, the hawk flies back through. It conveys telepathically to Thorin what it saw.

* A small, circular room, which maybe was once lavishly decorated but is now in disarray
* An awful sense of something wrong
* Many heavy curtains, but sunlight visible from behind theme
* It didn't really look for any potatoes!
* When it returned, it did so through a very large mirror on a stand in the room

Penny suggests that perhaps this room is being used by Vecna or his cohorts might be using to access this domain and search for the rod segment. It takes some persuasion but Thorin gets the hawk to fly back and try to look around more, especially beyond the curtains.

It's away for longer - but does return.

* It is far, far more scared this time and won't go back again
* The room feels abandoned in the sense that nothing has *lived* there for a long time
* It tried to look around the curtain but just found glass doors or windows there which were shut
* So, it landed; saw a balcony on the other side, *very* high, looking out at other tall towers
* Daytime, as we already suspected
* Some of the surrounding towers are taller than this one
* Impressions of a lively, bustling city
* As it turned to come back, it noticed, at the side of the room, a large probably-obsidian plinth with a large coffin on it!

Vampire, most likely. Thorin seems interested in a fight; going there could help us - give us more information than blindly wandering around in this land. Arturo reminds us - well, we can't assume this creature is consisted bad here. It could be an entirely unrelated, sanctioned research into this domain on behalf of that city.

Arturo and Thorin agree. Penny has to hope that the "sun" in the word "sunsword" is literal. Penny suddenly remembers she forgot to attune to the amulet, during the sudden appearance of Alustriel and rather abrupt teleport! Oops!

In uncharacteristic bravery Thorin takes a potion to become invisible and offers to go through by himself. "If I'm not back in 3 minutes, come after me". Penny casts Protection From Evil and Good with a holy water flask from the Bastion. Thorin self-casts Guidance. He goes in!

He sees carvings of strange winged creatures; bat wing style. Useful evil trope. One curtain is disturbed and a bit of light is coming in from there, thanks to Thorin's familiar a few minutes ago. The coffin is easy enough to see. Furnishings look ornate yet abandoned. He goes up to the coffin to investigate, hoping his invisibility and amulet make him undetectable. It has a layer of dust on it, which is interesting; there's just the faintest sense that it is warded, too. He'll need Detect Magic but that would dispel the invisibility. So first, he checks the room carefully; doesn't see anything else that might spot him. He opens the curtains - to a huge cloud of dust that fills the air. The curtains haven't been used in a very long time!

He knows immediately that this is, definitely, Sharn - the capital city.

The dust gives him away a bit; a rough outline of no-dust where he stands. He decides he should fetch the rest of us. He heads back through the mirror.

A dusty outline of Thorin appears to the rest of us. He explains the situation. He asks Penny to cast Detect Magic. So, she does this and we all go through.

There's an abjuration spell on the coffin. There's an illusion spell coming from a sort of coat rack, or hat stand on the opposite side of the room. Kind of from above it. Arturo, perception 18, can see a sort of dusty shape hanging off one of the ends of the hat stand. He tries to pick it up - at which it flutters and flaps! **It's a bat!** It was invisible, but no longer is. It flies up to the roof and hangs off - *something* up there, somehow.

Arturo tries saying "Hello" at it. Nothing. Thorin tries Speak With Animals and asks it what it's doing there. "Waiting" - it was asked to watch for thieves and sound the alarm and "tell the master when she returns". We haven't stolen anything yet! But what is there to steal?! "Anything taken from this room". "How long have you been waiting?" It thinks a while. "300 days." "Where did the master go?" "Where she always goes, though her door". It means the mirror. There are balconies, but there's no other door and the bat points with its wings!

It does confess that 300 days is an unusual length of time for the master to be away. And it confirms that the master "sleeps" in the coffin.

Francesc examines the room (investigation 23). Book shelves, a writing desk; not much else; lots of dust. The bat doesn't want Francesc to go near them, fearing theft, but Thorin allays its concerns; we're just looking. What for?! We try to convince it that we want the master's notes to try and find out why she might have been gone so long. Maybe she is in trouble. Despite a very low deception roll of 10 from Thorin in translation to the bat, it's enough; the bat believes it and flutters down. It grabs a sheet of paper and shows us.

It's written in an unfamiliar script. Arturo casts Comprehend Languages - this is in the native Eberron language. The wizard / probable-vampire is trying to activate and open a portal that opens into the Mournland (yes, we realise that).
