# RIPA: Act 2 Part 33
## Session 79 (2025-12-16)
### Campaign day 32, Alustriel's sanctum

We think we need to get to Oerth, and use Bigby's help once there to reach a temple where we think a powerful lich called Acererak currently resides. The sixth rod segment is there.

* Do we want to spend time at the tower?
* Shall we meet Mayastan? He seemed perhaps unhealthily interested in the rod
* Thorin agrees - him splitting off from the Keep leans into that
* What about Acererak - defences against that fear effect, or liches

But Urth has started his 12-hour cast to bring back Flurth. Penny's not sure about the whole Mayastan deal so is on board with the idea of finding him. We use a messaging service! He knows about the Sanctum, and Alustriel says it's about 3-4pm - so we say ~6pm, a rough guess. There's a reply message which agrees.

Thorin and Francesc think that they could do with a spell or artefact that might reveal truth or lies. That could be useful given they don't trust Mayastan!

As for the fear effect, Heroes Feast... Gem-encrusted bowls. We get two! Plenty of money - even at 1000gp each.

For Mayastan, Thorin has a thought-reading potion, but Urth mentions Zone Of Truth. Huh. Penny has that too! She'd forgotten completely.

We're wanderings streets, almost, looking for something that might be worth buying! We've a *lot* of coin - and yet, we seem to have what we need. Interesting.

We happen upon a long queue. Enquiring, we find out that this is the *Incantarium* queue. Oh! Well, Thorin suggests we queue... Penny isn't too convinced but it's "about" 40min long, and we've a couple of hours until the Mayastan meeting, so - we wait!

Time passes...

...and eventually, we get in. It's kind of a huge bank-like place, with a big board full of prices describing different kinds of items. There are two kinds of items - "fast price" ones which seem to be lower-level, and higher level items that need assessment; Penny worries that maybe that might take a while and Thorin is keen to sell the amulet. It'd be 400gp for each one. Penny goes to a counter and asks questions about where it might be going. Persuasion 19. The cashier pulls out a laminated card! "These items are for the betterment and defence of Sigil. They are melted down so the magic can be returned into the Weave".

We basically get punted away as there's a queue growing behind us!

There was a mention of "booking an appointment with the Incantarium", so we ask a guard - they apparently haven't been asked that before! They head off to find out more. Francesc says she'll wait while Penny and Thorin go to get an assessment on the Talon of Athas - *definitely* not a pre-priced item. Thorin, perception 20, notices as he walks up the stairs that they kind of momentarily... Phase! We reach a smaller room. There's a receptionist of some kind. "Room 3, please!"

Four chairs on one side of a long table, with a felt-lined tray and various tools that look like methods of detection or investigation.

After a little, an older man - maybe in his 60s, human, looking a bit frazzled/harried! - comes in. "So, what do you have for me?" he says as he pulls over a chair... But when he starts to examine the items, his eyes widen. "Re-*markable*!" "It's from Athas. As in, *the* Athas!" says Penny. The man puts on gloves. He asks us how it was obtained and we have to decline to answer *that*. He's handing us a piece of paper; Thorin takes it - 150,000! - and starts to close the box. "Woah!" we say - "not so fast." "You do wish to sell this, though?" he says, somewhat rhetorically; and hands another piece of paper. **250,000** this time.

The TL;DR of the exchange is that this person does not work here. He doesn't really know the 'source of funds' for the Incantarium. And 250K is the maximum he is authorised to offer. The Incantarium *might* offer more, but he doubts it. His personal view of the item, on being asked, is that it's ancient, if damaged magic; very powerful; powered by "destruction and decay" in his words. He offers to arrange a meeting the next day. He gives us a card. He is **Duran**.

Downstairs, Francesc meets the guard who has come back; but they don't have much more to offer. She gathers that the guard is employed by the Incantarium, but not actually a member *of* the Incantarium.

We return to the Sanctum. Penny quietly checks in on Urth - the lower half of a torso exists! "Just a few more hours!"

Malaiana (Alustriel's wife) is there when we're investigating older items in our collective inventory. We have the old keg - we get time to renew *that*. There is also wine or - *and* - spirits!

Mayastan arrives! Mynos is a bit of a handful - "That kid has trauma!" - and there's some smalltalk. But then Thorin cuts to the chase! "We're a bit worried about - some of your interest in the rod segments... And disappearing... Going off-script a bit... We're a bit worried talking about the rod... We want to understand a bit about what's been going on with you."

"That's fair. I'm glad you're taking those kinds of precautions. What do you want to know?"

He agrees to Zone Of Truth, so Penny casts. She detects that he succeeds against the spell effects - but lets it affect him anyway; Thorin and Francesc are in range and voluntarily submit too.

Francesc asks *why* Mayastan is so interested in the rod.

It's all about the Oracle - VS - Vallin. "e asked him to do research a while ago. It wasn't on the rod, but he found a weak connection; "more of a hunch" as he describes it; "I think that Vallin has an agenda of their own. I don't think she's after the rod, but I think she's after whoever *has* the rod! I believe that there are forces that want the rod, who are not Vecna's. I'm trying to understand why. I haven't any of the rods - yet! - and I assume that's not going to change, but there's a..." (there's a "clank" in the background, metal hitting wood) "...chance - what if we're not the only ones who want the rod to defeat Vecna? Why aren't we teaming up with other people?"

He hasn't told anybody else about the rod. Of course, outside this sanctum and the people here.

Meanwhile, Penny who - behind a bookcase - had shed the top-plate and offers the bag to Mayastan. "So, you've 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. But they're.... Weird!"

"Hold on!" says Thorin. "What about the - excitement? Your strange behaviour at the tower? Even Alfred had noticed. Thorin noticed that Mayastan almost looked like someone caught out with something. But it was because his first thoughts were about "did they get the rod" when we'd just teleported into the Keep, not "are they OK?" - and feels a bit guilty. He also confesses that he feels a responsibility to look after the tower, but it's not his! It's "a bit of an albatross around my neck".

Penny once again offers the bag of holding. "You've been looking after the keep, feeling a debt, but at the same time, it's surely paid. If you can work with Alustriel, hopefully we can find someone to manage the keep while we're away. Once this whole Vecna thing is over we should be back there much more consistently and hopefully can move it back to outside Candlekeep. But we don't know how long that'll be, so I don't think it's fair to guilt-trip you into staying there. It's yours to treat as a second home, but you don't have to consider it an albatross!"

He thinks really that the base of operations is here, now, in the Sanctum. And thinks we should base ourselves here.

"You should try a rod. Ask for the fifth segment; we don't know what earlier ones feel like once you've found a later one."

So, he decides to try it. Thanks to Penny's aura, he just makes his saving throw. He freezes momentarily, but then recovers a bit. His eyes widen, go white, then he lets go and the rod segment falls back into the bag of holding. "It's being guarded by a lich."

"We know! Not looking forward to *that* very much."

The rest of the night is cordial, fortunately. Relaxation. And...



### 10pm

...Urth and Flurth turn up at the dining room, complete! Introductions all round. Smalltalk, generally relaxed though Penny still feels a bit awkward about Mayastan.

We were going to talk about the magic items, but Alustriel at that point interjects. Another group of adventurers already investigated! The Incantarium worries her, especially in light of our report about Krynn. She says that they're distilling Spellfire by melting down items using arcane forges. "It's a resource. I've actually seen a jar of Spellfire stolen from the tower. It is - like any tool - agnostic; neither good nor evil. Our understanding is that when Sigil was closed, it is what was used to replenish the Weave. We suspect that the Incantarium is at least operating with the Lady Of Pain's tacit approval. Why they continue to harvest Spellfire is not immediately clear but we think it has something to do with a very large **Mythal** installed on the tower roof.

We elect to *not* return and make a meeting at the Incantarium.

Well, then, discussion turns to the matter of getting to Oerth - Alustriel can get us there; then we find Bigby, and take it from there.

Thorin casts Plant Growth into the staff once more. There's still a way to go before it's ready, but he's been asking other druids to help with pushing magic into it and, between us, we realise that the Rod part which can cast Regeneration could be added; it's the equivalent of 17 out of 28 charges.



## Campaign day 33
### First thing, Alustriel's Sanctum, Sigil

It's bustling in the sanctum. Bigby is here! We meet him in the library and introduce ourselves; Bigby is gnome - but old books describe him as an old human wizard... Umm - shrug. He was messaged by Alustriel. Introductions all round - and then straight to business! Bigby is ready to take us to Oerth.

Thorin has presence of mind to cast Heroes Feast. Well, Heroes Breakfast. Max hp goes up by 13.

As Bigby is beginning to cast, Alustriel does - *something*. Only Urth and Penny notice. She was doing it near a full-length mirror in the library, casting what looks like some kind of Gate spell... But **we are in Sigil and such things are impossible!**



## Oerth
### Time unknown

sUrth and Penny exchange glances. "But - did we just portal straight out of Sigil? That's impossible!"

Bigby explains - difficult, but not impossible. To get *out*. Getting *in* on the other hand, is a whole different matter!

Now Bigby casts a teleportation spell. It's very jolting by comparison! Reality folds in on itself and we're sort of crushed, then expanded again. We arrive in marsh! "Dammit!" exclaims Bigby, trying to flick mud off his rather expensive-looking shoes. "I syolud have levitated! I'm heading to Greyhawke. If everything goes pear-shaped, come and find me. If you're not dead."

He checks we're OK (and we are), then flys off on a small magic carpet, pointing and saying "It's that way!"

About 250ft away in the indicated direction, we can see the temple; we confirm amongst ourselves that it's definitely what was seen in the vision.

This *is* marsh, but it also *is* jungle. The temple has columns, overgrown. Even at this distance we can feel a hint of the chilling emanation that it sends out. This probably explains Bigby's hasty departure! It's overcast. Dragonflies with wings some 2ft in diameter fly around. Plants seem to crawl all over each other - whether roots, vines or anything else, every plant looks like it's trying to strangle every other plant.

Thorin casts PWAT and we head in.

Francesc worries about plants trying to ensnare *us*. Nature - 10. She doesn't _think_ so...? But as we approach, we *do* see rotting bodies / skeletons wrapped in coiling vines!

Thorin casts Speak With Plants... And Urth casts Zone of Truth on them at the same time. Resources well spent. Thorin decides to speak to an older tree. Urth's spell, CHA 18 - tree's save plus zero - also 18! But it's *confused* at the concept of "lying". Thorin asks about the bodies. "This was many moons ago. They rested under my boughs and they were taken! They now feed my proginy."

THorin asks if we can pass freely. "I cannot stop you".

Urth asks (by proxy) - "who would stop us?" "A more mobile creature here" "What mobile creatures?" "There was a battle towards the stone structure there" "Anyone recently?" "Recently? Yes. 100 or so beings have passed through here in the last 3 years!"

The tree asks if we might feed it in return. The "warm splashy thing that feeds me" - huh? - "usually when people come up to me that's what they do!" - Francesc realises (Nature 19) that they mean pee, not blood! Urth pees on the tree while Thorin nods knowledgeably, saying "Nitrogen".

We *do* learn that there were four people that came through here recently. Thinking *way* back to the four "dark" similar-to-ourselves party working for Velindra, Thorin describes them; maybe 2 were the same, the other 2 not so.

Thanking the tree, we head towards the temple. We find signs of *recent* battle. There's a strange slime over four of the bodies, and Thorin tries to work out what it is. He touches it - it's psychoactive! - fortunately, he saves against its effects and warns the rest of us. It would cause someone to simply not move. And then, _things_ could slowly digest whatever wasn't moving.

Umm - OK, time to get inside!

PER all-round, highest Francesc, 25. A notebook - opening it, it's field notes from someone called **Marian Xaviere**, a field archaeologist for the Academy of Ancient Arts of *Waterdeep*. Huh. Wrong plane! How did *that* happen?

Francesc spends some time checking the book. INV 32! Whoever wrote this has made notes of a number of locations, some of which aren't on this plane - some even in the Outlands. Eventually the book reaches notes about "here", the Isle Of Serpents. They "followed the trail of clues" that they think show meant Acererak left the jungles of Chult on Toril and, via the Outlands, came here. They don't know why he did that. Then more frantic writing, hasty. "Oh my goodness! If it is Acererak, that's amazing! I've been following this trail for decades and I might actually get to see him in the flesh!" - there are indications of a fascination of and trials with necromancy; perhaps this academic even idolised Acererak a bit.

(Francesc will have ADV on certain checks for traps as a result of reading this).

Penny is examining the temple. A cuttlefish-headed god, large bat wings, round, elphantine-looking body with six arms, melting into a sort of blog at the base. REL 23, she has no idea. She calls over Urth and Flurth - both roll HIS 30! An entity they've only ever heard of before but never seen - a **Far Realm Ancient One**. Urth has never heard this talked about anywhere else at all other than in study and didn't even think it was real! A being *totally* unknowable and beyond the concept of good and evil... Why does it even have a temple?

Urth explains a quest he went on when he was 19. Something he'd read in a children's book. Never found it; people said it wasn't real; crazy talk. And *this*, he says, is equally crazy.

Penny wonders if this is just imagination; people who had thought about - well, crazy stuff, flights of fancy - and came up with this idea. Too much psychoactive slime!

What about the stone, then, asks Thorin? We're in a swamp! He examines it - 700, 800 years. So not that old, in Dwarven times.

Penny still thinks that this is just kind of nonsense...

Approach the door. Well, there's no door; it's just open. Bones scattered around, vines with flowers that puff poison. Fortunately, Heroes Feast makes us immune! Good thing too; we spot two halflings, not so decayed, at each other's throats.

It's dark inside. Penny draws the sun blade, since Urth and herself can't see much otherwise - but then she realises there's a wall of actual Darkness, spell-style, in front of her. She has 10ft Blindvision, so she approaches. Behind it is a wall. She moves sideways and eventually finds an opening - "Here it is" she says, and goes through. ADV (due to blindsight) DEX save! Nat 20 - 25 - a huge hole 10ft wide is just behind the entranceway with just a 1-2ft ledge.

Thorin throws a Starry Wisp in there. 30ft down, a mass of metal spikes; the rest is obscured by bodies.

And of course, Thorin uses Mage Hand to see if he can find anything valuable! He ends up managing to bring up a backpack, but a few things are still inside it. He checks inside - a torn mouldy rations, a large velvet bag, but ripped with nothing inside and a small steel mirror. There's also a broken vial! Well - Thorin takes the mirror.

We *finally* move beyond the entrance pit!

Penny has been cranking the sword up to emit maximum light.

A cavernous space. A temple complex of some kind... It feels almost wintery-cold. Very still air, slightly slick ground. A sheet of thin ice where there is water. We can see where other people might have walked. Painted frescoes on the walls show massive battles between armies of nations - naval, land, sky with dragons, griffons and so-on; throughout every single one, looming in the back, is this Far Realm creature painted at a colossal scale. In each case, two hands hold items. One is a rod with a ball at the end, like a sceptre; while the other is a many-tailed sceptre.

Well, we're inside; why not use the last rod segment? We do consider even *joining* the segments we have; but perhaps - not inside this temple! Penny faffs around a while (!) to get the bag of holding, offers it to Francesc and Francesc grabs the fifth segment. Guidance from Urth gives a saving throw of 33! She knows immediately that we're on the wrong level. The rod piece is a long way below us. She's "pulled" further and further into the sense of claustrophobic fear and darkness. And she recognises things that were written about in the notebook - lots of traps! It takes her **all the way to a room with a chair and study desk; she approaches the back of a hunched-over figure; someone wearing almost priest vestments; the figure turns and grins at her, holding in its hand, the sixth segment.**

Francesc drops the rod. Penny is as (now) usual, holding the bag-of-holding underneath; it drops into the bag. But Thorin suggests using it - it'll find paths! So, she gets the rod again and actually casts **Find The Path**.

Urth had already suggested that the pit we saw before might be a thing to investigate - and he was right. There is an entrance to lower levels about 25ft down in the pit. The bodies hide anything about 30ft or lower, but 25ft below that *should* be a door. Well, Francesc can walk on walls and goes down with a torch. Urth can now use Misty Step and Thorin can use Moonlight Step, bringing Penny along.

The tunnel is tiny! It's a tight squeeze. After some... debate... we elect to let Francesc through first since she knows the traps. She senses that walls are covered with a weird slime but avoids touching it, but warns the rest of is. Thorin can see it's the same slime with Darkvision and warns people! But he also notices that if the slime is burned, its psychoactive properties are neutralised... So he lights it up. Safely - we don't all burn! It smells *terrible*.

Francesc finds a bracelet that looks like it snagged on something. Someone else came this way. Francesc PER 25 - she is definitely able to see traps; slots where blades would slice through the tunnel. There are stones that look like pressure plates all around the area. She gets close, hoping to disable it; but it looks like it needs to happen from the other side. So Thorin moonlight-steps with Francesc!

SOH 13 - Francesc steps off the trap! About 15 seconds later (of remarkably bright and shiny blades flying around), it stops. SOH 25 - it works! Urth sends Flurth ahead; he squeezes past Penny and through the trap space. No worries! Penny pushes through with Urth behind.

Another cavern, flat floor, slimy walls. It feels like maybe a natural space except at the far wall; three doors. **And ahead of us is a camp** - two bed rolls and a tent - well, quite a fancy tent! - a campfire that's gone out with just some embers, a cauldron of water; someone of note.

There's nobody here - but they were recently!

(End of act 2, part 33)
