# RIPA: Act 2 Part 12
## Session 58 (2025-03-04)
### Mournland, in Llandro's Mountain, Outlands relative day 10 (late)

It's been a long day, from finding our way into the mage's tower, battling for the crystal, feeling an angry air elemental and being chased by Warforged, but here we are; inside the mountain, in a network of tunnels and caverns, next to a strange seam of quicksilver which Arturo has just discovered carries the consciousness of Llandro themselves.

He explains what he's experienced as best he can and suggests we continue to follow it. We proceed cautiously, Francesc taking point with her keen perception, Penny next, Arturo third, and Thorin last with PWAT up to try and hide our progress. Arturo has a light on. Francesc perception only 12 - the environment is strange, with many distractions; rubble, strewn weapons, armour, bones; it's not like there was fighting all through here, it seems that people just died.

The slight upwards angle ends when we reach a large chamber. Leaning, or perhaps collapsed against a far wall are soldiers in the now-familiar blue, white and silver outfits; armoured, with shields, helmets down; but they're skeletal. There are five that look as if the were running through the room - and just died. Francesc tries to investigate but can't glean much (12). Penny tries Detect Magic. There's certainly an aura of plenty of it coming off the "quicksilver" trickle! There's a faint, old, decayed trace over the whole area, which must've been very magical at one point but isn't anymore. But then she sees, at the very edge of detection, a *very* strong Abjuration effect - it's at another corridor/tunnel a difference away. The corpses don't have magic, but do possess items of some small levels of enchantment - practical applications. She wonders how they died; lucky Medicine 19+2, 21. She lifts a helmet visor. Clearly, from the decay, they died years ago; and from their position - it looks like it was instantaneous. It's like they all just dropped in their tracks with no visible injury.

After explaining this to the group, Arturo with Thorin's help wonders what might actually cause that. Arcana 24. It's not something he's heard described, but he thinks he could search for signs that might indicate more - if they were simply overwhelmed by extremely strong magic somehow, he would expect *some* kind of indication around eyes or mouths. And when he looks very closely - **yes, he sees that** - as if magic _seared_ through them. It didn't vaporise them or anything, but was certainly enough to kill them.

Penny heads towards the abjuration effect, getting no more than 10ft close. It's a wall of force, but it has a huge tear where it looks like it kind of exploded outwards. She could thread through it without hitting the wall, but the others can't see it. It's quite narrow. Looking around, she thinks it seems to align with a whole in what looks like a kind of vast knee joint, that has jagged metal which is showing through the rock. She asks Arturo to throw in a potato - it doesn't shrivel or otherwise react - but the quicksilver does react a little. Arturo thinks that touching it won't hurt, so long as we're careful.

Penny heads through first, with no ill effects but the wall is *thick* - a good 5ft - and in due course we're all through and "inside the knee". Thorin remarks that this wall probably covers the whole machine and if we hadn't found this entrance, we would've surely struggled to get inside; he also uses Mould Earth just to at least create some kind of trip hazard, just to add to delays.

As Penny moves deeper inside to make room for others, she starts to float! She realises that she can push against the walls she can move up a bit. Arturo uses the light and we now see a bit of a ledge, then a huge empty space, some 30ft wide that goes up and down as far as we can see. Arturo can help loft himself with Mage Hand. Francesc gets inside and (investigation 23) notices big metal rungs that can be used to propel ourselves up or down, so soon enough we start doing that. Arturo looks for the quicksilver, nat 1... Francesc helps... nat 1... Penny thinks it's ridiculous, it must be around somewhere... nat 2. But at least Detect Magic makes some of it visible. It's in droplets - that's why it was hard to spot - it is being drawn upwards. And then she notices that everyone except Thorin have ended up with a few drops of it on us! It's on clothing only so far - nothing on skin.

Since she can see the stream of droplets, Penny helps the group avoid picking up more. We all start using the rungs to move upwards.

After about 100ft, the chamber widens out significantly. A platform is to our right, maybe some 40ft wide, "level" ground. Metal plate mostly, but with stonework. Beyond is dark. We could continue up, but the quicksilver heads towards the platform. Arturo casts Light on a potato and throws it to get more light beyond the platform. It bounces along the platform, bouncing as if suddenly encountering gravity, then reaches a void beyond and floats. The other leg! **The quicksilver is probably going "up the spine".**

We carefully land down on the platform. Here, we see another column, but only about 20ft wide this time. It's very intricate - lots of strange carvings (our modern eyes might think it was circuitry). There's a lot of the quicksilver all over it. We think it won't hurt to touch it if it's through clothing; Penny has gauntlets, while the other three use bits of blankets or similar.

It's tough going; Penny (ATHL only 10) has trouble slipping, metal on metal and splashes on some of the quicksilver. It's a shock! In fact we all have a similar issue and both take 11pts psychic damage. Then Arturo tries, same result; but Thorin has no issues. Despite that we do manage to float up some 40ft, but reached a damaged section; the "backbone" is cracked and snapped, nasty! There's a large platform just before breakage. Up on there, it's under gravity and we feel a little safer - the narrow entrance is defensible. We discuss a short rest, but in the end Healing Spirit is used to bring us back up. It needs a couple of casts.

While this happens, Penny sees a _spirit_ bursting through some rubble in a corner! It looks like a human, male, dressed in the same solider outfits we've seen. They hold an unusual-looking device; a sort of hand-crossbow, but shaped almost like a tiny canon. It needs two hands to wield. They run, see us, stop and say - "to arms! To arms! Have you seen my friends? Where have they gone?" - Arturo points back down the "spine".

At the end of Francesc's second casting, the exact same thing happens! This time Penny asks, "Who's attacking?" "I don't know! I can't find my friends - I keep losing them!" - Arturo tries to ask them if they know about traps or defences towards they grey matter core, because _our_ friends are up there. But his deception roll is only 12, so that doesn't work. So instead, Thorin tries deceiving that the spectral soldier's friends are up there! "No, we're infantry. We run to the defences. I had to go back to get my gun. But I don't know what level they're on!" - so Thorin just points down the tunnel.

Arturo tries Comprehend Languages, wondering if casting _any_ spell has this effect. Wild magic surge 37; aaaand - potted plant. Weird.

Sure enough the solider reappears! But this time he seems to remember something. It doesn't help and he doesn't seem to know where the Grey Matter Engine is, so we send him back down the usual route; Thorin remembers the potted plant solution from before and kicks the pot so it breaks. Arturo reappears.

Arturo realises now that the floor has writing on it. We decide to wait another minute, while Arturo tries to read the now-legible floor. It turns out they're directions to places within Llandro!

Left leg; right leg; main antigravity well; artificers quarters, workshop, bridge, muster point, war room, holding cells, weapons system, grey matter engine.

The bridge and grey matter engines aren't in the same direction, but Penny remembers that we were supposed to try and find Llandro's records of the calamity from the Bridge controls, so she'd like to try going there first. Arturo wonders about seeing if the artificer's quarters could give us something to fight with, against the people chasing us, _then_ the bridge - well that does sound reasonable. But what about the weapons systems - could they be used to "finish the fight" here? Penny's not keen on taking sides to that degree.

Thorin brings up a Familiar and leaves it behind to warn us if our pursuers reach this point. It'll keep back at maximum range, or perhaps popping in and out, so we have a bit of extra warning.

We settle on artificer's quarters, bridge, grey matter engine.

In due course we reach a room with doors on both sides, left and right. "Workshop", "Quarters", reads Thorin and decides to look at "quarters". Bunk beds; no light; someone sleeping! But then Thorin feels drowsy... CON: 22, he's fine but stops us coming in. We can't hear him though! It's as if there is a Silence spell, plus Sleep. The person inside seems real! Perception 17, Thorin; Arturo tries to poke with Mage Hand! Nothing. Perception 29 Francesc - they move with the mage hand. Seems female. Not a skeleton, but not breathing. There's skin. Maybe human? But very pale. **The researcher?**

We want to go in. Francesc thinks she can't be forced to go to sleep. CON save, dirty 20, but maybe wouldn't have affected her anyway. But she can tell there's a spell effect. She walks to the bed and notices someone *possibly* human, but also at the same time, somehow other-worldly. A luminous quality to them of some kind. Then a spirit sits up from where the woman is lying and looks at her! It communicates telepathically. She tries to resist... the spectre looks around to try to reach out to anyone she can see.

Penny is keen to understand - a flood of realisation. **Alamar-Vatashi** - the name.

* One of the artificers.
* She always seems to over-sleep! She becomes the Vatashi part of her; she's a kind of human merged with a dream spirit.
* She thinks her physical body has basically gone into stasis; may as well be dead.
* Her dream-spirit self is alive (so to speak) in the dream world.
* She asks why we're not sleeping.

After some smalltalk, Penny asks if she's aware of what has "happened to this machine". WIS save, a lucky 26! Visions are clear; no damage. It's like being a soaring board. A titanic stone & metal statue stands inside a circle of glowing sigils. Some two dozen uniformed spellcasters - small as if ants, from this perspective - surround it at equal spacing, casting. The colossus begins to levitate and a silvery light swirls around. There is a teleport starting; **but then the ground quakes and the focus of the mages is broken.** The perspective ("she") is hurled to a point near a mountain; there's a sense of phasing; then that stops, and Llandro is merged with the crumbling mountain. There's then a restoration of perspective to that circle. Perception 15+2 - the mages there look horrified; but one very quietly steps back from the group and leaves. As they do, she notices when they turn that they have a metallic hand moving from under the robe. A glint of light under the hood. **It's not enough to recognise Vecna, but she suspects it.**

The perspective is interesting - like a floating arcane eye; it's not "a Llandro's eye view". The last thing before contact is severed is to realise that Alamar-Vatashi was sleepwalking, floating up; so she got left behind and had to then go looking for her body. So she saw what happened on the *sending* side's aftermath, rather than what then transpired on Llandro's side.

Can we help? She'd like to be freed if possible - which can only happen if her physical body is destroyed!

"You're sure it has no chance of life?"

"It has not responded for four years."

But it must be destroyed - somehow its entire physicality must be destroyed. Apparently burning would work! Arturo's ears prick up at *that* but it seems unnecessary to use spells and the spirit is confident that the body would feel no pain. One way would be a furnace in the workshop... Well, that's just across the way. So after some to-and-fro, we decide to drag the body across (Alamar-Vatashi looks very distressed when we consider checking it out first and coming back - she fears she will sleep again if we do and not awaken).

As we drag the body, the spirit moves ahead of it. **Then there's a yell; and she flees out again! Three pairs of yellow-orange eyes appear in the darkness and we near snarls. Then the pounding of feet running towards us.**

The creatures coming into view are strange. Penny recognises them as wights. Bad news. She doesn't want to fight but sees no option. She draws the Sun Sword and holds her ground at the door.

Initiative:

* Arturo nat 20->30 (swaps with Francesc)
* Penny 21
* Francesc 20 (who is retreating with haste!)
* Thorin 12 (heads to the door)

Francesc can easily see past Penny and hits one wight, crit! - but low rolls, 21 damage. Hunter's Mark says they're resistant to Necrotic, immune to Poison. Same target... Hits again; not a crit, but still 23 damage. It's looking messy.

Penny uses her Abjure Foes ability and it works very well; they all flee - but in fact they all go through the floor! An unexpected result. We have a minute until they regain their senses and in that time we grab what we can.

* Cartographer's tools, forgery kit for Arturo
* Herbalism kit and thieve's tools for Francesc
* Penny hoists the body into the furnace! Arturo has time to use Firebolt to get it lit.
* Thorin looks around... Tubs of some kind of paste. Palm-sized globs can be taken. It seems to have restorative properties for mechanisms! He takes some.

We still have some time. Francesc (investigation 23) sees a pool in the corner where it looks like a display case fell and things broke. There's a small pool of quicksilver/grey matter fluid there and tiny shards of silver material seem to have merged with it; the whole thing has an unusual, amorphous look that seems unstable. Tools nearby seem physically warped - one end of some furnace tongs is bent, while the other has fully melted, deflected in the direction of the metallic mass. Francesc grabs a nearby magnifying glass and drops it in. It breaks; the glass turns into discs of molten liquid which float around and then turn into bubbles; they crystallise as glass bubbles; veins of metal grow from around the metal rim and in the end the whole thing looks rather like a lung.

At this Penny "feeds" it with other tools. All are reworked in that strange way. Arturo tries a potato. D6->3 - the surface starts to discolour then settles with rows and rows of strange engraved symbols. At this he uses Mage Hand to move the potato out of the room - we'll be out of time soon.

We head out and close the door. The spirit hangs around a moment longer. What are we *really* here for, we're asked? Well, the power core. It's explained that this is above the grey matter engine, accessed via the bridge.

At this moment Thorin remembers his familiar - but it's gone. Our pursuers may be close. It was last in contact near the "spinal column" shaft. We have go back that way to get to the bridge... He calls again,  a hawk this time; it gets to that same platform with the direction signs for now it is clear. We run for it.

(Penny while they discuss it looks for quicksilver; maybe she can ask Llandro *how* we get its consciousness into the holding gem; but there are no veins to be seen here).

We get onto the big platform then take the route towards the bridge. Suddenly - whoosh, a serrated belt just misses Thorin's ear and embeds in a wall right next to his head. We're being pursued. There are more handholds here, but it's not antigravity. Arturo suggests breaking them as we go up - Penny tries but they hold fast (ATHL 13). Thorin instead tries blocking the entrance with Wall Of Stone. That gives us ten minutes and if he holds concentration that long, it's permanent - but can be broken through. We continue at pace to the bridge. The Familiar on the far side of the wall sees a warforged face pop up which fires at it... But misses. Thorin tells the Familiar to get as far up as it can but keep an eye on that wall.

So, we reach the bridge.

There are various panels on the wall which look like mirrors but don't reflect anything. In the middle, seated, is the skeleton of a gnome in a chair with lots of controls. Its skull rests inside a strange metal scull cap. A couple of other dead humans were stood at controls themselves. Again, it looks like they all died immediately.

Now all we need to do is figure out how anything works!
