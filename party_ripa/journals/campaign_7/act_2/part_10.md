# RIPA: Act 2 Part 10
## Session 56 (2025-01-21)
### Eberron - Mournlands, time unsure

We've a Warforged captive called Spike who has told us about how Llandro was teleported *into* a mountain, and that the Lord of Blades - themselves an old Colossus - wants to find the technology within too. We first need a short rest to heal up.

At first, Francesc suggests the portal - it seems a safer place! But there is the question of Spike. Arturo asks what he wants; does he desire death, as a warrior, or freedom? He would prefer to continue seeing what "the experiment" is like - the experiment of *sentience*. He doesn't know how long it will be until the other Warforged here reactivate, but it seems that they will eventually. The lieutenant called **Doecent** is damaged beyond repair, though.

Arturo doesn't want to rest behind the portal only to get pounced upon on exit once again. We figure we'll tie up Spike but he doesn't want *that* at all, as there are other dangers here and if immobilised he'd be defenceless. In exchange for *not* being tied, he says he won't attack us. Arturo isn't convinced. Penny's insight on this is a little high; 19+6 -> 25; these creatures are part of Glaive's advance party trying to secure Llandro and the area around Llandro. A base of operations; tame the area. Nobody else seems to be claiming it, after all! There's *something* he isn't sure of the area nearer Llandro, which apparently is "troublesome" in some way, but beyond that - all Penny can really tell is that he's truthful in saying he wouldn't follow us, *but* if we're in this area, so are they. We'll meet them again.

There is a debate that emerges about whether or not these things are even alive. Thorin considers them just constructs, so disassembly is not killing. Penny's discourse with Spike makes her sure this is indeed a living creature - perhaps a trapped soul, *inside* the construct, who knows - but alive either way. Arturo leans towards them indeed being living, but rightly points out that they threaten to awaken imminently and *will* try to kill us if they do.

Arturo therefore tries to convince Spike that they must *leave* the area if they are to be kept alive. He tries reasoning; the argument is reasonably convincing; Spike is probably persuaded, *but* points out that he himself cannot control these other creatures. "If they do not follow me, then it is it not their own choice to die? Why would I engage in combat with them to *make* them do what *I* want?"

Arturo concedes that he shouldn't force them, but should at least try to convince them. With Doecent down, Spike can try to become a _de facto_ leader and we know there are other Warforged groups. Perhaps seeking them would be wise... With Penny's help (who is surprised at how well Arturo is handling that), Arturo's ADV Persuasion is 20 (both rolls low, but not a terrible total). **Spike thinks for some time, then says - he will perhaps head to "go to Ialos and join Mercy and the Pilgrims"**. An old town maybe 4 hours walk from here - Arturo shows him a hasty sketch drawn what he 'saw' via his scrying orb, but which misses much due to mist - and Spike gets quite involved, filling in other details! There's a mill near a hill that's ruins of a small town. This is **Ialos**, some 3-4 hours walk away. It's not near the largest hill/mountain, where we think Llandro resides.

Maybe that's a good destination for us? Spike would come with if so... But Arturo's keen for Spike to try and convince others to come his way too.

We head off - in any direction, almost, looking for a place to short-rest. Francesc leads the way with Penny's help via the map and talking to Thorin who has some ideas too; this helps negate issues caused by the mist. Survival dirty 20. Eventually we come across a sort of overhang in broken land, some 8ft high, that provides a bit of cover. We can set watch from here - and so, we rest.

During that time, D20->13. Thorin is on watch; perception 17+9 -> 26. He notices a strange effect, as if something nearby makes his hair stand on end - an electric charge. But he can't *see* anyone. Occasionally he sees - or thinks he sees - little sparks of light in the mist, a little like very fast fireflies, but always moving right-to-left in the mist about 50-60ft from him. Thorin tells the rest of us; it doesn't seem immediately threatening, but it's unsettling. However, after that strange electrical effect we see that the mist has cleared a lot. It's much thinner than it was - in fact, we estimate we can see almost 1000ft.

We can see the sky and, now, the sun; it gives us a good guess at the time - it's early evening.



### Early evening

We didn't realise it was so late and might've considered going direct to Ialos for a safe night, since that's 3-4 hours away; North-West, Penny can actually just about make out a broken windmill. North-East is the huge mountain where we think Llandro is 'merged', with a thick layer of cloud. We can see a lot of scrap, salvage, broken land... And here and there, things seem to be moving. This is *not* an empty landscape by any means!

We consider various travel options and ultimately decide to walk to Ialos. We want to know more about the mountain and region around it before marching in there, as it's surely both dangerous, but also a very large area to search. If we walk to the town, we might encounter trouble - but we might also encounter help.

It starts simply enough. After an hour or two, we're making solid progress. We crest a ridge, in full view of the now-low sun. Thorin, perception nat 20 + mod. The tops of high objects and landscape are lit firey-red by the sun. But down in the valley beyond, something *on* fire seems to move! Not to spread; just to move. Arcana rolls are Thorin 17, Penny 17 - a fire elemental? - and Arturo 18 - he thinks maybe not quite. He's seen this... In a vision. **This looks suspiciously like the world's biggest fireball!**

The ball of fire is moving in a way that would ultimately intersect our path. Arturo suggests we change route. Penny is surprised; first he's nice to the Warforged, now he's avoiding his favourite fireball. Insight 1+6 -> only 7... Perhaps he's been replaced by a mimic! She keeps her hand on her sword hilt.

We dip down on the ridge away from the valley, with Thorin using his Familiar to keep an eye on the fireball thing beyond. It seems to meander somewhat aimlessly. It is not aiming for us. It would be burning everything around, but for the land already being burned!

Stealth group - disadv. Penny, 17; Francesc 21; Thorin 11; Arturo 12. Group rules take the 21 & 17. Thorin's Familiar notices that the 'fireball' suddenly stops - **and makes a beeline for our position**. It's huge; maybe some 100-150ft across and 500-or-so feet from the ridge top, then a further 100-150ft from our present position. It's moving fast, too. We think we should run; there might not be time to cast the 'cloud form' spell of Thorin's. But it's faster than us! Arturo suggests a spectral dragon as a distraction. He sends it towards the fireball, but at an angle to try and pull the 'fireball' away.

Deception 26; the dragon tries a charge, breathing fire - perhaps as a kindred spirit! - and the fireball reacts, getting much more compacted, but then explodes outwards and roars across the ground towards the dragon. And at this moment, it leaves the ground, turning into a strange, inferno cloud. Thorin perception 21 via Familiar; away in the distance, maybe some 1000ft out, another cloud *takes off* from the ground. But this one looks poisonous and green. It's heading for the fireball cloud. Thorin, Arcana 24. He's *sure* this is a particularly huge Stinking Cloud spell. But the Stinking Cloud appears to engage with - fight! - the Fireball Cloud.

Penny wanders if this is some strange curse; religion 3+12->15, well, maybe. Could be.

They seem distracted, so we decide to start moving quickly to try and get away. We stay off the ridge with the Familiar used to keep an eye over there. Thorin also activates PWAT. It's enough! We seem to slip past the strange clouds. Thorin wonders if he saw one of these earlier; perhaps that electrical effect before - a sort of lightning cloud. These seem to be reactive, hostile, but ultimately mindless.

We're soon close to Ialos. The sun has nearly set. The town is completely in ruins - we can't see a single building without damage. All seem mostly damaged from one particular direction, as we've seen before. The windmill is surprisingly more intact than most others. One side wall is very cracked and one of the vanes is very broken but it still stands fully. Penny thinks *maybe* (passive perception 12) that she sees movement...

Arturo sees the mist has cleared. He wants to retry using the 2nd Rod Segment to scry the position of the third, but we can't really do that out in the open! Buildings just seem to be rubble, mostly. It looks like it is an old event, yet no plants or weeds have started to grow back. That leaves the windmill. There's an old road visible, mostly obscured but visible. We head that way. Penny leads, Thorin next, Arturo third, Francesc guards behind us. Arturo holds up an improvised white flag - maybe it'll work!

There's definitely movement in there. Flashes of colour, bits of rags blowing in the wind. A head seems to peer through an open doorway. Then she sees a hot-pink coloured (!) matte, but metallic humanoid, wearing a long scarf wrapped several times itself. Penny calls out, "Are you the one they call Mercy?"

A sweet-sounding voice of indeterminate gender answers in affirmation. "You have me at a disadvantage!" Penny makes introductions. We are invited in, since we seek refuge for the night.

The damaged wall looks worse inside than it did outside, but there are nonetheless intact stone stairs leading both up and down. There are four other Warforged here in various colours, but not as bright as Mercy. They introduce themselves, each very different in demeanour from Spike. A stilted conversation is struck up. Mercy thinks that Spike will probably be destroyed by the other Warforged in his group, but hopes not! Apparently there's a bit of a truce - if they stay in the ruins, they are left alone.

We are asked why we are here. They seem to be paying particular attention to Francesc. "Why are you all looking at me?!" "You are not any elf we have in our memories - you are not..." (lists off various hard-to-spell ancient elven names) "...what are you?!" We try to explain but can't really. Suffice to say we're from a long way away (they have no concept of multiple planes / worlds) and that's why they don't recognise what we would call a "wood elf".

Arturo starts talking about the big mountain and that changes the tone! They think we're scavengers. We're just the same!

We try to explain about the rods, in abstract terms. But then a voice yells from above - "Chain lightning moving our way! Everyone! Into the ossuary!" - the 'souls' (**docents**) / power cores of other Colossi are held down there; the rescue them to avoid their theft, in reverence. That's what they fear we want to do, but we don't think the rod Llandro's "soul" is the rod segment.

We all end up below. In exchange for shelter, they just want to talk. If there is agreement by morning they might help us. Arturo talks of the 'god lich' but they don't seem worried at all! It is more of an analytical threat analysis. Their own existence is hard enough that a lich god takeover doesn't really mean much to them.

Penny meanwhile is taking off her top plate armour. Eventually she gets it down and explains about the second segment, asking if they maybe want to try and use it to detect the third rod segment. But there is danger in this; it can overwhelm us when we do this sometimes. There seems to be an agreement to try. Eventually Penny produces the second segment. It's recognised immediately by one of the group!

"That is what you are looking for? That's the power source of Llandro's Grey matter Engine. I was in the Captial the day that Llandro was awakened. I had already been deployed before the Day Of The Cataclysm when Llandro was sent to the front lines."

It turns out that the "Grey Matter Engine" was a prototype for Llandro and represents the most advanced consciousness/storage mechanism ever made for their kind. (So, they consider Llandro to be one of their kind - just much bigger). Llandro is alive and conscious, and the consciousness exists within the Grey Matter Engine, and that Engine is powered by the rod segment. If we take it, he "dies".

Arturo points out that he must surely be suffering, trapped in the mountain. They'd rather he were saved! That would be done by transferring the consciousness. But there's nothing of that scale, points out Arturo. The one from the Capital claims that they had seen things which could hold large consciousnesses, but they were weaker - in the sense of having no physical protection like a Colossus. "Spell gems - elemental Spell Gems. This is where consciousnesses are stored before being transferred."

Penny asks if we could have the rod powering the engine trapped in the mountain, *if* we were able to transfer the consciousness into a gem. They have no *moral* objection, and would help us as best they can, but only if our intentions are as we state! "Our intentions are as we stated!" insists Arturo, persuasively. They believe him.

They want to talk more with Penny though. They are "fully formed" creatures, having had a lot of trauma, but they're also almost like children in their curiosity. They want to know everything! They want to know what Penny's understanding of life is. The best they can do is describe what *they* believe consciousness and life is. This is all-consuming to them; what makes them different than beings that are born? They consider themselves something different and unique. The concept of self, the right to life.

A philosophical debate ensues, summarised as: the group can do 2 Insight & 2 Persuasion rolls. Insight from Thorin & Francesc are 28, 20; Persuasion for Arturo are 25, Penny only 13!

* We end up trusting each other, in agreement and in understanding
* The closest they can think of that resides in the grey matter engine is what we call "the soul" - the sum total of what makes each Warforged unique
* As close as they get to religion is that the souls they hold in these 'dead' docent might be revived somehow one day - but after the war, no new warforged can be created; they're irreplaceable
* Docents can affect other magic items... Even these 'dead' ones are powerful, which is why they're scavenged. They are kind of amplification crystals.
* **They suggest we use one to try and work with the rod segment!**

They don't want to use the rod, but they'll attach the docent so we can try with the power amplified. Arturo has had good luck with this before but doesn't know how lucky he's been, so volunteers immediately. And his WIS save is nuts - nat 20, plus mod and Penny's aura! He knows *immediately* where the segment is. It is deeply hidden, through layers of dampening energy. It's in the rear of the head part of Llandro, which is itself half merged into the side of the mountain. The rod *might* be accessible externally, but it takes so much power to push through the barrier surrounding Llandro that *this* is really the big problem.

The Warforged here don't know a way through the barrier. If we can find a way into the mountain we might be able to find a way through perhaps? They don't know if tunnels within pierce that barrier, which otherwise envelops Llandro. They don't know - Glaive's people are already there, so they've never got inside. But they think there's a group of people who *are* getting close - they speak badly of the group - veteran warriors from the Kingdom of Cyre who have been "Mad Maxing" (DM's words!) around and are believed close to finding a way to Llandro.

**(The war had been going for about 50 years before the Warforged came in, some 40 years ago. The Veterans are younger than you might expect - late 30s - they were born with and grew up with war around them. The Cataclysm happened about 2.5 years ago. The Warforged treaty recognising them as sentient and freeing them, was signed about 2 years ago.)**

We are, thankfully, permitted a long rest. We have rations between the party so we use those before we sleep. We *do* take watch.

* Arturo: Perception 8. Tired! The mist returns, too. The Warforged on sentry duty are quite creepy; they are totally motionless, as if dead, but in fact very much alive.
* Thorin: 15. Distracted by thoughts of treasure amongst the ruins; this was a wealthy land once.
* Francesc: 16.
* Penny (ADV via Francesc): (2,10) -> only 12.



### Outlands relative day 10

The air is very cold. Ice crystals form on walls and floors. Arturo asks about the mist but the Warforged don't understand it. The Mournland also has a thick cloud bordering it, fully obscuring visibility in or out, which is miles thick and very tall. The mist seems to form from it. War-cast spells that should have ended, seem to have become persistent at the moment of the Cataclysm. They don't understand how that is possible either.

They would've loved to know how Llandro ended up in the mountain; what he saw. **There would be a recording in the Navigator's Helm** within the unit (they believe his teleport into the mountain was a result of the Cataclysm and not the cause of it).

Our task would be to first find elemental gems to hold Llandro's consciousness. "There may be some in the ruins of the mage's tower, perhaps?" they suggest. That crumbling tower is around 15 miles away from us.

We're in!

"Beware the restless" they say. "They cannot be reasoned with. They cannot be put to rest permanently either."

Francesc leads the way. SUR 15; not great, takes a while! 4-5 hours, due to difficult patches of terrain with occasional false starts along the way. For four hours, 4x D20: 14, no issue; 16, no issue; 17, the weather improves; then last roll - 5. Close to the tower, with now-good visibility, it seems strange that the tower is so dark. The ground around it seems churned up in an unusual way too. Gnarled, twisted-looking thorn bushes are present - and these seem alive. Vegetation! Well, of sorts. Dark, waxy leaves amongst bowls of thorny vines that thicken closer to the tower. They obscure the path to the tower, rising up about 3ft into a dense barrier.

The top guess-at-50ft or so of the tower seems to be totally blasted away. One side is almost totally broken away. The remains rise 30-40ft precariously.

Arturo tries to Firebolt a hedge. 10 damage. The vines don't burn though! Penny has a go with a radiant blast cantrip; a small burst of sunlight. 12 damage. The area of strange darkness pushes back the dark briefly, but it rapidly reasserts. The vines are *slightly* damaged by this, but they seem very hardy. They do now have more of a burned appearance.

Penny tries Detect Magic. The range is limited, so she's mostly interested in the bushes. A general sense of magic surrounds, in all directions, rather unsurprisingly. The bushes themselves don't emanate magic, but the darkness in front is definitely a magical effect of some sort. Almost like the Darkness spell. Thorin tries a L4 moonlight spell. A bright column lights him up for some 20ft around. The darkness is pushed back, so long as the spell is active. It wouldn't give us very long, we'd have to stick close and we'd need to get through the bushes.

Arturo tries another Firebolt (damage 25, no effect!) while Thorin tries Starry Wisp (18, some of it works; about 1ft square is now singed or disintegrating).

Penny tries something a bit left-field. She tries Dispel Magic onto the darkness, ability check dirty 20; the DC would be 10+level, so that'd need a level *ten* spell to resist. The result starts to look good; it 'recoils', as if almost a creature; bits ripped away; the remnants end up coiling around in darker shadows around the tower. "This is an entity! It's not just magic!" It has been torn up a fair bit, but has *not* been destroyed despite the Dispel power.

DEX saves:

* Thorin 14
* Arturo 8
* Penny 15
* Francesc 26

Francesc is the only one who sees it coming - the rest of us are suddenly plunged into full darkness. Penny's blindsight means she can "see" her nearby companions. She calls out, "it's that darkness creature..." - but they aren't really listening because the creature is coiling around and spinning them, physically, an almost corporeal form. Well, at least we have an idea that the darkness and bushes are not related!

Thorin tries to push back with his moonlight, then changes tactic to Speak With Plants, hoping to talk to the bushes. The spell really doesn't work - Thorin REL, only 12. It's like "picking up a phone and not getting a dial tone". He calls out his confusion. "Maybe they're undead plants?" shouts back Penny, lighting her sword and trying to attack the "darkness creature". Meanwhile, Arturo tries to stumble towards Thorin which is taken to amount to a DISADV melee attack; he can't do it, but he swipes just past Thorin who reacts and grabs Arturo, pulling him into the moonlight.

Penny's attack is dirty 20. Even with a smite, 4d8+5 -> 17 (low damage roll). The darkness recoils further and she presses it. As she prepares her second attack, she hears Francesc calling out via Hunter's Mark that it's not resistant to radiant and psychic damage but is resistant to just about anything else and there are almost no conditions that can affect it. 27 for the next attack, but damage is only 12. Even so, the darkness is trying to retreat - it seems like it might try to hide behind the tower. It's going out of range, but Thorin throws another wisp for 21 damage. At this the darkness totally retreats behind the mess of the tower, retreating inside largely.

The plants are now in full sunlight. They almost look petrified; halfway between obsidian and ebony. And in this light - what we thought were living things now look _very_ dead; confirmed by Arcana - it seems likely that a spell was cast within the tower to create this field of dead thorn bushes, as protection.

We could try and fly... But Arturo has a bright idea! He suggests using the 2nd rod segment to create an  arcane gate. Penny isn't keen on the rod being used right out here in the open, but, well, she's got no better ideas. Arturo selects an area of open wall about 30ft above the ground (perception 19), which *should* hopefully have enough space and looks strong enough... So Penny goes through the rigmarole of taking off the armour and Arturo tries it. The casting is, he says later, surprisingly simple. It has flair, too; leaves sort of flow out of the air to create a portal space, which stretches away and connects to the other end of the portal. The darkness "spell" seems to retreat further. The rod is stowed and Penny carries her armour across as we don't know how long the gate stays open.

There's a part we could squeeze through or clear rubble to head below. This floor is very badly damaged, everything having been exposed to the elements for a couple of years. It might once have been a library. We opt to try below. Thorin uses Mould Earth to move rubble magically. Francesc is constantly keeping a magical eye on the darkness via Hunters Mark, but the "mindless" effect acts as if afraid and retreats from wherever we go. Thorin's moonlight is still up - perhaps that's why.

The room below is lit well as soon as Thorin gets below. There's mud and damage at the staircase, which continues further below, and a partly blocked doorway to another room; it seems a gathering/eating area, with a large, but broken table and scattered chairs. It doesn't have any books or desks. Breaking into the room beyond might bring the whole place down and it's *probably* just a kitchen, so we decide to go down to the next floor for now, but could come up again later.

We head down. Arturo, ARC 16. The layout in this new room is familiar. Above was a library, then a reception or eating area, this is a bedroom. Below should be an experiment area, he thinks, as that's quite common for mage towers. We'd need a basement, really. But the next level down, an entrance level, has lots of the vines blocking it. The spell that was cast to create these things was probably a protective measure, cast from inside.

Thorin and Arturo search around for a way down. There's probably a hidden entrance. There's a sconce they notice, curiously placed right by a window. It'd be a bad place to try and put a torch; he sees a scuffed area. It rotates. We stand back and Thorin turns it with Mage Hand. Block by block, the floor drops away, forming a staircase. Thorin sends down the Familiar. Perception 14; it's mostly dark; it can see a very deep basement - the ceiling is 15ft above the floor. There are various cages, some chests, an armour display pedestal, various tables, dust, mess... There's even an armour display pedestal.

Wait a mo; Penny is suspicious about *that*. That "pedestal" is probably a Warforged entity. Francesc decides to sneak in. Stealth 31! She looks at the armour first, but it really does look like armour - beautiful and delicate, faintly silvery chain mail, ornate, hanging with patterns weaved in. There's a similar chainmail scull cap with long sides. Francesc calls down Penny, wanting Detect Magic. She starts looking for traps first - perception 23; there are many pressure plates, all around the base of the staircase in complex patterns. You have to be very careful! She calls a warning up to stop Penny. There are skeletal remains in the hanging cages, too.

Penny jumps sideways off a higher step. There are *magical* traps here too, she sees, as the descends - so she stops too! She confers with Francesc; it lines up - the pressure plates activate the traps. But the armour emanates a very, very strong magical effect and also a pedestal with a glass cloche with a gem inside. She gasps. That's what we want! The armour magic is abjuration. That can be used in an offensive or defensive way, so it doesn't help.

Francesc looks closely at the pressure plates; each, through the dust, can be seen to have a magical glyph of warding. She pulls back! Those glyphs mean you only need to get close; simply stepping on them isn't necessary. Thorin says he wants to just magically step into the room. Penny is worried about the armour but we can't stand on the stairs all day... We don't have a better idea! Moonlight Step, into the middle of the room.

Penny lights the sun sword and gets ready to jump off the stairs to help if necessary. Arturo is near the top. **As soon as Thorin teleports into the room, there's a loud shrieking sound** - "Beware, watch out!" - which comes from a *ghost* of a small gnome-like creature, which Thorin now sees flitting around the cages. There's another scream at the same time, though, violent and hateful, from an apparition of a long-haired old man wearing robes with sashes, big rings, bangles, a circlet... It leaps out. Clearly dead. Probably one of 'the restless'.

Initiative!
