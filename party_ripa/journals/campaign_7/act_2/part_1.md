# RIPA: Act 2, Part 1
## Session 47 (2024-09-10)
### An unknown length of time after the cataclysm, in an unknown location

We are no longer on Torril. One or perhaps many unknown entities rescued us - but we possibly do not remember what happened, or perhaps even realise we were rescued.

Some of our party - if we remember! - might believe that all on the world were dead and the world itself perhaps even physically destroyed. Others in our party, even if their memories are completely intact, would not understand what had happened at all, in the craziness and confusion of those last few seconds. In point of fact, as far as our collective recollection would show, Vecna killed all souls on that world who could not escape in time to another plane, though Torril itself is most likely physically intact.

We don't know if other creatures - birds, animals and so-on - survive, what might have become of, say, Undead, or what might have become of anyone living deep below the surface in the Underdark. We only know for sure that Vecna appeared over both Waterdeep and Candlekeep simultaneously, but have good reason to believe he attacked other locations too - because some of us were contacted magically (or perhaps telepathically) by allies, or at least acquaintances, in other places across the world. They told us that all was lost.

We have no idea in detail of Vecna's actions anywhere other than the events we witnessed in person at the rout of Waterdeep, but worry that Vecna's influence is likely spreading through eight portals to other planes that we saw him open in the conclusion of his attack. We don't know for sure, though, if he was indeed opening portals to travel out through them, or perhaps drawing forces from them, or something else. In the heat of the battle, we were also unable to identify any of the locations beyond.

All of this is, at least, what we *would* surmise if we could recall our prior lives! Instead, we remember only selective things; names, abilities... A vague sense of loss.



## Outlands day 1
### Meeting again

Initiative rolls for narrative:

* Penny 23
* Francesc 22
* Arturo 15
* Thorin 14

Penny wanders the Outlands, but not without purpose. She sees a wide expanse of landscape, a plain; soft clouds; distant trees. Penny has been guided by the term "Spireward" - towards the hub, where Sigil can be reached. Rimward is circumferential. Penny has been headed Spireward for a while. It seems closer now but it's been a long time, and not as much closer as she'd hope! The floating torus of Sigil is clearer though, lit by the sort-of-day light, but mostly invisible in the sort-of-night.

On very clear days, she can almost make out - very faintly above - the "other world" in the sky. At other times, it seems more like her imagination.

She scuffs her feet and discovers cobblestones below the dirt. Ah - there is some kind of road here. Once she gets her eye into it, she can see where it leads. Around a bend beyond a small rise, there is a squat-looking two-storey house with a thin wisp of smoke curling above, before a gust of wind blows it away. Lights inside, but it's "day".

Perception 5! She can't see much else... She heads for the house.

Francesc feels anxious. It's been weeks since she found anyone who helps her in any way. She's wandered into a less populated area. She'd seen a house on legs walking around and decided to follow it; it "parked up"; she climbed up a rise to try and figure it out, then saw someone turn a corner in the distance below. History 20. A flash, as if a door opens in her mind; a flood of memories; she knows who this is - Penny! She's below, on a lower layer, some 20ft maybe.

Fran's sure everyone is dead. *Sure of it*. This must be an impostor! Insight, 21. Not only is too much "accurate", but Penny also looks different. A strange headband. Mended clothes. If this was a shapeshifer, it's a strange way to look. She grabs her bow, for caution, and shouts - "Penny?"

Despite the low roll, Penny hears the call. Impossible! Francesc was invisible for scrying... Jumps! Startled. "Who's that?! Show yourself?" - and then Fran fires an arrow at the ground next to Penny.

Penny looks up and sees Francesc.

"It can't be... I couldn't see you. After all this time. I thought you must have died. Proves it's you!"

"How?"

"Who was next to you on the roof?"

"What roof?! But I remember us really fucking up stealing that thing from the museum... And there's this really annoying dwarf..."

Penny thinks for a minute. Insight 16. Without a word she runs up the hill and gives Francesc a hug.

"Thanks for the hug. Where was your god?!"

Penny explains she was saved by her. Francesc is annoyed! They get into it; she's not a believer. Gods failed us. But Penny argues her case. We reach a middle ground. Penny knows Arturo is near; Thorin is unseeable.

Francesc wants Penny to wear her amulet - she *owes* the lich for saving her. Penny has much to consider.

Arturo, meanwhile, is already in the house! He's woken by the house as it shakes and rises to its feet. Penny feels the ground trembling prior so she's looking up at it (Perception 16). She's sure she sees a shock of red hair, as someone gets out of a window and scrambles onto the roof. He's trying to stand up straight as if controlled, but clearly isn't!

Penny yells at full volume, "ARTURO!" and lights the sword, increasing its brightness as quickly as she can. In the back of her mind - "But what are the chances of finding *two* of us in such short order, especially with only Arturo visible to scrying? - and shouts to Francesc, "Follow that house!"

We run down the hill.

Up on the house, Arturo is getting his "sea legs", watching where the house is going. He's too far to hear Penny's shout. The house is going spireward, but a bit anti-clockwise too. He's hired a room from the occupants and nobody seems to know or care really where the house goes. It goes where it wants to!

While on the run, Francesc tries another distracting arrow - she's going to try and get it to skate past his head, but have slugs for added visibilty. In practice it thuds into the roof, near Arturo's feet. Arturo perception 17; he sees it straight away. Slimy green slugs! **But Arturo has never seen that before**.

He's curious; he's not seen that before. Slugs on an arrow?! He turns around and tries to shout back to whoever fired it. "What a curious, revolting arrow you have there! Why do you do this?!"

"To get your attention!"

"OK, you have it!"

Penny is none the wiser; insight only 7. Francesc, 10. She's used to Arturo being strange and doesn't think anything about his answers is strange. Arturo shouts in addition, "Are you here to stay in the hotel?!"

"I couldn't remember who you guys were either! Come down!" tries Francesc. "Can you make it stop?!"

"No!"

Penny and Francesc keep running. In between breaths, Penny asks "Do you have... An arrow with a rope... Or something... We can use to get up that thing?!"

It's going too fast. So Francesc calls to Arturo to ask him to cast Fly on us. Surprisingly, without hesistation, he complies. The two of us are lifted off the ground with an ear-splitting, shrill, shriek of wind; horrifying, briefly; then we gain control and it quietens. We are *shoved* off the ground. "I'm not entirely sure that's Arturo anymore..."

Thorin started in the Outlands, but has moved around between planes a while. He ended up back in the Outlands, memories intact. He's felt "pulled" towards Sigil; and at the moment the other three are flying, he is in a flying form - but as an Air Elemental. He's a good half-mile up and sees some strange activity below; an arrow fired; someone running up; a hug instead of a fight; a house walks; and people fly. Very unusual!

The three below can't really see this misty cloud descending. But Penny, now airborne, is looking up as she's trying to control the flight and sees smoke from the chimney moving in the wrong direction. Huh?! Arcana 20+4 - that's some kind of magical effect, for sure, which seems to be incontrol of its own movement. A spell under someone else's control, or perhaps a magical creature.

Penny has a hunch (flat INT 13); finding three of us all at once is unlikely. So why not four?

"We'd better get to the roof quickly" says Penny, remembering that Arturo is concentrating on the spell. He's seen the strange 'wind effect' too but is not particularly phased by it. Her and Francesc get onto the roof, Francesc fidning balance easily, Penny on all fours with as tight a grip as she can get. Thorin-cloud heads towards the excitement.

"This is a long shot" says Penny. "THORIN!" - and she once again raises the sword. "IT'S US!"

Thorin's memory is intact; he sees the sword; he recognises it. He closes in!

Penny turns to Arturo. "We've met before. You don't remember us at all?"

"No! Not at all! Have you come to see me unleash the sun?!"

"Sure! But not towards that wind cloud."

He does a *huge* fireball. He times it so that the edges of the flame wash over as we travel along through the roof.

Arturo is very impressed by himself. Penny isn't sure what the issue is; so she tries Protection From Evil & Good. She hopes he doesn't mind, but he works out what it is and doesn't mind. "I don't think anything has taken me over, but I appreciate the sentiment!"

(Penny starts giving backstory; wondering if anything will jog his memory; nothing is working)

(Thorin closes in; he's seen the fireball, not sure what that's about).

Penny asks if Arturo wants to join us going - "there" (points to Sigil). He says that the house is going there anyway!

Thorin is close now; insight, 25. The group isn't behaving the way he remembers. Instead of excitement about the "band being back together", he gets a bit concerned. The behaviour is odd. He keeps going anyway.



### Arturo's story

Arturo starts talking. He came to being, somehow. Falling in an endless wind; a cavern, with no end. He lost track of time - weeks, months, years?! He then spotted some kind of exit, but fell right past it. "But I found that after 100,000 breaths, I would pass it again. And so I had a moment when I could do something. It turns out I have this incredible magic power, to make the sun, which it seems not everyone can do? Perhaps I'm a better sort of person? I might even have willed myself into being. I did see other things; sometimes a face would whiz past, sometimes with a body, some tried to speak but in the wind you couldn't make it out. But I was the only one who had their faculties and I reached the exit. I could cast a spell, something amazing happening every time; occasionally, this inclded me moving slightly to the side. So I focused on that and, bit by bit, I got to the exit, in cycles of 100,000 breaths."

He ended up in the Outlands. Locals were so impressed by his magic powers that they offered him clothing and food.

Thorin has arrived in time to hear the tail end of Arturo's story. He changes into his true form and lands on the roof.

Penny gasps and smiles broadly. "It *is* you! It is a geniune pleasure to see you again, Mr Dwarf. What do you remember?!"

Thorin remembers it all. Some 3-4 months have passed. Francesc asks who pulled him out? "Vallin!" Wow. So, Vallin; Velindra; Meliki and... Well, Arturo has no memories! He insists that he threw a giant fireball to save the world; that kept him grounded in that long period of falling in the wind; everything else is gone.

Then Penny looks again. He mentioned being leant clothes. Those are new, but maybe he still has his backpack...? Penny mentions a few things he has in it. "Not to freak you out! Just to back up our story... But we'd not harm you. In fact, we'd fight to protect you from harm. And if you're willing to help us, we can certainly use that help."

Arturo - whatever he now is - is "in".

Thorin asks if Vallin saved Frances; "No, Velindra". She explains a bit. Penny describes her memory of the moment of rescue, too:

> As the demon Penny had been battling falls, the ground shakes. Buildings collapse. She gets a clear view across to Francesc and Arturo up on a rooftop and, beyond, Vecna. A strange bubble of energy is expanding out from him. It passes over the rooftop and she sees Francesc and Arturo fall; out of the corner of her eye she sees Thorin start to fall too, but a fraction of a second later this strange effect sweeps over her and she feels a sudden, cold draining of life; a profound weakness and dizziness. She falls backwards - and everything slows down.
>
> Penny feels detached from her physical self; through her open eyes, she sees the buildings and paving tilting away as she falls backwards, with the bright sky swinging into view, various portals open within. Somehow that's meaningless now. It's a strange feeling; that of warm embrace, of safety - impossibly, yet unmistakably familiar. Meliki is here.
>
> **So, this is death.**

...but the name Vecna does not register with Arturo. He remembers *nothing*. Thorin inspects Arturo - medicine check 24. No evidence of any healing procedures, physical trauma, or other issues. Nothing _physical_ anyway.



### Into the tavern

The house jolts, as it takes a sharp turn to the left, leaning. DEX saves; Arturo and Penny don't catch themselves in time. We fall. As Arturo falls, he loses concentration on the fly spell and we both fall! Fortunately, we do stay on the roof; we're prone, but sliding down. Penny shouts, "I think we should fall off the roof now and carry on, on foot" but Arturo disagrees and says we should check out the lodgings. Hanging on by fingernails, now, Penny watches as Arturo demonstrates how to get into the room. Penny ATHL 17, she manages to get in there too.

She lands in the small room next to Arturo. It's small; a bed, desk, hat stand; and *ah*, there is his backpack.

Up on the roof, Thorin and Francesc see us head down. Penny's head then appears as she pulls herself up a bit and shouts, "It's this way!"

Francesc - ACRO 19 - swings in easily. Thorin pops his head under, sees the room and uses Misty Step. He appears in the room; it's a bit like the helm, but smaller. A tear that he appears through. Penny comments, "Well, *that's* new. Nice trick." It's crowded in here now though, so we head down.

There's a corridor with maybe 8 doors heading off and stairs. Soft music plays. On the ground floor is a long table, a couple of small tables, a kitchen door, a blackboard with menu items and drinks, and a fireplace. There's a red-and-white fluffy faced fox-faced creature with long tail and detrous hand-paws. They're wearing simple clothes and look up, puzzled; "Where have you come from? Are these your guests?!" - Arturo says, "Yes".

He's used the name Arturo. Well, at least he remembered *that*. Apparently his full title is "Arturo, Herald Of The Sun"!

There's a bit of explanation. We're able to stay down in the room below while the house is on the move; once we stop, he says (seems to be a "he") that he'll see if there are rooms free.

Francesc talks about where she was. A plane full of order. Full of clockwork! Everything was very regimented. She hated it! She was sure everyone was dead; the whole world destroyed. Other beings she met were talking about it - she was *furious* at Vecna. Now she's met us; Arturo isn't the same... Penny not quite...

This all confirms Penny's worst suspicions. The entire world did fall. Thorin says, "Yes, Toril is *definitely* lost."

Francesc isn't sure why beings powerful enough to save us didn't save others. Maybe they did.

Penny points out that she's heard wild tales that Toril was one of *thousands* of worlds. And there may be orders of *millions* of people on each.

**The good, the grey and perhaps even the bad - like Velindra - do not want Vecna to succeed. _That's a lot of people on our side!_**

Talk then turns to the amulets. Thorin and Francesc are adamant that Penny and Arturo should wear theirs. During this discussion, Chaos Dice D8->7. Suddenly the house lurches. Things do dark. Penny briefly loses her thread of conversation, as if the headband "flickers". A couple of seconds, that passes. The light comes back on. Things hovering above the bar counter crash down but rise again; the house stabilises; it continues moving.

Even though it's quite obvious that this was some kind of brief anti-magic field, Penny's Arcana (10) isn't enough to figure that out; perhaps that's reasonable because her headband failed at that moment. She's never seen wider effects like this, but the headband has failed in that way before - every few days - she'd always thought it was just her mind wandering, or fatigue.

She asks the others. Thorin and Francesc have experienced this too. Thorin has noticed that it's getting more frequent as we get closer to Sigil. Arturo says, "The magic goes out sometimes!"

"If it's more frequent than usual then..." - so Penny turns to the fox and asks, "Does magic fail at Sigil?"

"No! No, have you never been?"

"Never. It is our destination."

"I really wish you'd been before! It's quite a magical place. But Sigil is closed! You can only listen to tales of it."

"Why?"

"Presumably the Lady Of Pain shut all the doors in the city of doors."

(Penny insight 6; she doesn't work it out, but still asks) "Have more worlds fallen?"

"I don't know. There are old tales... Several milennia ago... This is something that's been done to protect the city, to stop outside influences." He mentions that it's a hub...

Insight 18. Penny asks, "So if I had a ship, to move goods to another plane, I would start at Sigil?"

"No, it's only doors."

"So how would I do it?"

"You'd go to one of the ports. Towns outside. There are several; one is near Trade Gate."

So if we want to find that ship - for the second rod - perhaps we don't even *need* Sigil. It sounds inaccessible... But a port. That makes more sense, and we can still reach those. One of the most well-used "sky ports", we are told - the only route into the astral plane - and we remember a very strange vision for the broken ship. It wasn't on *this* world. So it was either accessed via that sky port, or via a town on the rim.

We did see the ship *in the air* early in its journey. **Our best guess is the rim. Find Trade Gate, get the ship's name.**

Other discussion happen. We consider options for Sigil. We're told you can't fly there - you just never reach it; perhaps we go to the centre where these anti-magic pulses are more frequent, and use the *lack* of magic to gain entry to a place that's _presumably_ defended by magic of some kind.

The inn keeper tells us that the Inn Of Wandering Thoughts goes where it wants, so we should leave - much as he'd like us to pay for rooms! - once the inn next stops, as we have a specific destination in mind.

Penny trusts this. Arturo isn't sure - why not just jump out of the window?! Thorin, insight 19; there's no ulterior motive.

Trouble is, the Trade Gate place is a long way away - on the *other side* of the spire. Thorin reveals he can fast-travel us with Wind Walk. Penny worries that this "anti magic" wave would cancel the spell, but we do calculate that at 300ft, even an hour at that speed would equal roughly a full 8 hour day on horse back at 40ft.

While we wait and drink, we tell our stories. Arturo told his; D6 -> yields order.



### Francesc's story

The place was the *complete* opposite of a natural forest. Very ordered, very structured. Strange creatures. All round, or triangles, or boxes. She couldn't remember a thing on landing other than the name of Velindra Shadowmantle - but didn't even know why. There was a connection to the worn bow she carried; she was clearly well travelled.

The strange creatures provided food and drink - curiously helpful - but she got a growing feeling of anger at... Something. At first, she attributed it to the unusual surroundings; she even tried to attack the creatures but rapidly learned that this was a bad idea!

It was weird; no variation. She'd fire an arrow, it'd always go the same distance and always hit the same place. No randomness. No chance. It was *horrible*!

Over time her memories came back. Being let down. Powerful beings, who were meant to be our protectors... Gods, or others... **They did nothing**. The one person who saved us was an wvil person who'd considered killing us. She even ended up in a therapy circle for creatures - Modrons, they're called - who had other "wrong thoughts" at one point!

She *had* to get out. A destroyed world must be avenged - either by her, or someone else. But she knows a way.

Francesc was prepared to throw her lot in with Velindra, until she met us. But she no more had a way of contacting Velindra, as she did her own old adventuring party - if any of them lived, which she doubted.

Eventually, the Modrons helped her find an exit. They realised she was still angry; therapy hadn't worked; this was an anomaly. She couldn't stay. They packed things for her, brought her to a gate and sent her on her way.

Francesc definitely feels like she could've distracted Vecna. The anger includes guilt. She held back; she was afraid of missing (Sharpshooter or not); if she'd managed it hit harder that second time, maybe it would've changed things. Maybe it would've turned the tide, or at least saved a few.

**She'll never hold back again**.



### Thorin's story

Vallin helped Thorin escape. She explained a lot, in a brief flash of visions. He knew Toril was fully lost, but like the rest of us, didn't remember that at first.

He awoke in The Outlands, in the gate town of Faunel. He felt kinship to the planar change, somehow. A connection. It had a strange pull... A pull towards the spire. He didn't know why.

He wandered planes. His first - The Beastlands. He connected with his primal state, in beast mode for days, learning from creatures and spirits. He found greater balance. A purity of existence. Some of his mind came back through that, and this kept pulling him. Another place. So, he left; and reached another plane. Glorium -> Isgaard. Action! Testing himself. Battles.

The fate of Toril was returning to him. As he fought on Isgaard, he had repeated flashes of the battle at Waterdeep. In the midst of that turmoil, he met a monk; centre himself, find himself, in Limbo, he was told. Floating monasteries of calm and control are in the midst of the chaos.

A third place -> Xhaos. Limbo. A total loss of control; he had to learn to be OK with that. Hard to find those monasteries... But he interacted with the sky and dealt with the chaos. That's why he was an air elemental once back in The Outlands; he'd become accustomed to that mode of travel.

In time, he mastered himself and resumed his travels in The Outlands. He spoke to many people along the way - Tongues making it easy. He learned a lot.

The spire called him.



### Penny's story (pre-game full text - in-game recital was heavily shortened)

As already mentioned, at the moment of Vecna's apparent victory, Penny believes that she died.

Others must take up the fight. Surprisingly, that is welcomed. Penny had been so tired and, lately, frightened most of the time. Now there is only warmth and contentment. She closes her eyes. It seems the right thing to do when you're dead.

The *instant* her eyes close, she is no longer falling. Startled, she opens them and is *wildly* disorientated! Her other senses tell her she is at rest, lying on the ground. Her hands feel grass. Yet, she stares up into a sky though which she sees the ground - facing her - very distant; she *must* be face-down, falling towards it. Yet she is not.

It's hard to think. Penny recalls being not the quickest to solve a problem, but it's not been *this* bad for a long while. Strange. Her name is Penny. She's a fighter. There is a deity; she wears an amulet. It helps connect her to magic... She can cast spells. Maybe. She can't remember many right now. Very strange! She knows she has forgotten something - well, almost, *everything*. But she doesn't know why, or how to remember.

She knows who she is, and that she has a purpose. She remembers language, survival skills, all of that. Yet she remembers nothing of her past.

Between what her eyes see, her hands feel and what her fractured memories are telling her, Penny has something of an existential crisis for quite some time before eventually giving up on it all as an impossible problem, looking to her left and seeing that - yes, without question - she is lying in a field. It's not particularly comfortable and she really ought to get up.

Things improve quite quickly from here. She looks around - there is a landscape; beautiful - majestic, even. Rolling hills covered in thick grass upon which she now stands show Studio Ghibli waves as the grass is moved by a gentle breeze that also blows fluffy clouds across the impossible sky - she ignores *that* bit for now! The plains give way to ancient forest in the distance, with a glitter further away suggesting a river or lake close to giant mountains, snow capped, stretching up high. Almost at the limit of vision, she's sure one such mountain *touches* another, from the impossible world "above".

As she explores, she realises something strange. When she's thirsty, just around the next ridge or behind an outcrop, there will be a spring or a stream. When she's hungry, a bush or a tree will come into view, bearing fruit. When she decides to find shelter to settle down to take stock, figuring that she might be here for a while, she walks over the crest of a ridge and discovers, just on the other side, a perfect rocky outcrop under which is a shallow cave, protected from most of the elements. It has a wide entrance and a floor of soft moss, somehow dry despite being a healthy, green mat. It serves as a comfortable bed.

There's even light - useful, she supposes, should it ever get dark here! - at one end of the cave. There is a strange, brightly glowing set of concentric circles. Strangely, she gets a "feeling" of calm from it. She isn't sure what it means, but elects to set up a small camp nearer the opposite end of this small space. They're a bit too bright up close.

It all makes sense, she muses. This is *not* what she thought the afterlife would be, but it provides. If she has a want, it manifests. Perhaps it's just chance, but it seems reasonable that Meliki would look after her, since Meliki did rescue her. Ah! There! More memory. The name, the goddesss Meliki. And there was a terrible battle, and she died. There were others. She had friends. Perhaps they are here? The most confusing thing about this afterlife has, so far, been a singular lack of other people! She should start searching.

Her sword is broken - just a hilt. That nags at her a bit, but given the damage to her shield and dirt and scratches on her armour, along with the ragged, almost shredded cloak she wears, it makes sense. It was quite a battle! Inventory time. Her wits mostly recovered, the shock of transitioning to the afterlife abated, she unpacks her heavy pack. Much is routine and familiar but one thing - one particular thing out of everything in there - calls to her. A circlet; well, more of head band. Very 1980s. This is something she asked for. This is something she wanted. This is something she was *warned about*. It might carry danger, but she thinks - just maybe - this is important. Besides, what danger can there be now, when she's already dead?

As she holds it, turning it in her hands, examining it, thinking about it, it's like tiny lights coming on in her mind. Slowly, at first, but then more and more. Over the course of some time, her slow thinking speeds up. The rate seems to increase, too, so by the end, it's quite a rush - an explosion of ideas, and of understanding.

*The headband of intellect*.

She didn't think she should be that person, but now's not the time to worry. This place is *not* the afterlife. It can't be. It doesn't make sense. There's nobody else. There's another "part" to this world - the strange land in the sky, but she has no way to get there. Nothing has come to speak to her, to explain. She feels aches and pains, she has hunger and thirst, she gets tired; her armour is damaged, her clothing dirty and ragged, and she has her backpack, with all her things and - oh my! She has - ***THAT***.

With trembling hands she unthreads the bindings on the chest plate and deftly removes her upper armour. Yes. There it is. Looks like a humble sack... She reaches inside - hesitates, there is great danger in this! - but this feels no time for caution. If it isn't the afterlife, she needs answers. She removes and unwraps cloth from around a broken rod. Yes! We looked for this! That battle was related to it. This is very, very dangerous and important. And so again, she focuses. She understands now. Attunement. The rod gives her strange visions - a wrecked sailing ship, yet not on a sea; and then the memories start to come faster and faster. The rod, split across planes. The power to defeat evil. A quest to find the parts. This ship carried the second one. We were to find it! We were battling at a place we hoped to find answers! We were looking for - what was it? A place, a place where there was a land in the sky and the ground! And a central spire, connecting it, with a city. Is she there? Is this it?! **Is this the plane where Sigil, for that's its name - the city of Sigil can be found?**

In her excitement at this revelation, Penny barely notices that she suddenly has an arcane connection to this rod extending well beyond the visions. There is magic here that she can command which is *far* beyond her normal abilities. It lets her speak to...

*Penny yelps, out loud, drops the rod, jumps up (banging her head on the cave roof, she really should've kept her helmet on) and scrambles backwards in fear.*

She dare not.

Commune with *her deity*. Commune with Meliki.

Surely she dare not. That must be forbidden? To commune with a goddess directly? Proof of existence? Destruction therein of faith? Faith is not needed where there is proof.

Thoughts run at a thousand miles an hour. She stands, hunched a little in the curve at the back of the cave, staring at the rod in indecision for what feels like forever. In reality, who knows. Does time even pass here?!

Then she draws a deep breath, walks back to the rod, picks it up and *casts*.

The world around her fades. She's still in the cave, but it's - grey? Or translucent? Or gaseous even? She lacks the words. It is simply - less. And then when she blinks, standing in front of her is a unicorn. Not a Despicable Me unicorn; more of a Legend unicorn, times ten. Words fail again - glory? Magnificence? Inadequate words.

A soft, melodious voice. Well, of course it is. Perhaps Meliki simply speaks to her in this Commune spell in whatever way Penny already expected. She is sure that her own mind is an open book in this moment, after all.

"It's a construct, silly. Your needs will be met."

The unicorn vanishes and the spell collapses! "What the HELL?!" shouts Penny in sudden anger, the magic of that moment thoroughly broken! "Silly?!"

Oh! The sudden realisation to end all sudden realisations.

Penny wraps up the rod and puts it away. She carefully reattaches the Bag Of Holding inside her armour, doing a better job this time to stop it moving around so much when she's fighting. She lets her connection to it fade and instead connects to her sword, for now she knows what it is. An hour later, that's done. Her bag is carefully repacked, objects cleaned if needed. She cleans her clothes too, as best she can. She mends things as best she can. There is no rush since she has no idea how or if time passes here.

But that feeling - the realisation - that never leaves. Occasionally she laughs out loud at the now-apparent absurdity and even wonders if her sanity is entirely intact? But it was all so *obvious*! How could she have missed it?!

She refills everything she has that can carry water. She packs as much fruit as she thinks she'll be able to eat before it spoils. The Bag Of Holding is a good way to keep the weight down and maybe the fruit will last better in the pocket dimension. As best she can figure, it's a constant, relatively cool temperature there, based on how objects feel when withdrawn. She realises, as she's playing around with this, that she's become quite the experimenter all of a sudden.

She's ready to go. This isn't Sigil. No city around that distant mountain spire.

She says out loud, "What I could *really* do with is a doorway that'll get me to Sigil".

She waits a few seconds, then, holding her breath, turns around. And there it is - the mother of all clichés - a beautiful panelled oak door, with a polished brass handle set off to the side, standing impossibly in a varnished oak frame, there, near the cave entrance, in the grass. She walks around it. Yep! A door, the same door, accessible from both sides. It probably doesn't matter which side she goes in through...

She opens the door. It opens "inwards", towards her. Beyond she sees a rather unremarkable pastoral landscape. She steps through, but then turns and hesitates for a moment. The door is still there. The plane, wherever it is, has not yet been closed to her.

It was really, really nice there. She had, literally, everything she needed. She was safe. She wasn't scared.

She blinks, and there stands the unicorn again, on the other side of the door. But she hasn't cast anything, so - wait, what?! - and then, the same voice.

**"You still have much to do. But one day, when your time comes, know that I will be there - if you wish it."**

The unicorn turns as if to run back down the hill, but as it does so, with a flourish, it kicks out both back legs and slams the door shut! The moment the door closes, it vanishes and Penny now sees beyond, to the edge of the world, apparently... Curving up ahead is the ground, a small town of some kind to the left, and turning back around to face "inwards", *there*. Now *that* is Sigil - even at this distance, the mighty central spire of this strange toroidal landscape is easy to see and in the middle, surrounding it, is the "something" that she knows is the city of Sigil.

It's a *very long way* away though. Should've been more careful about asking for that door!

And she realises she remembers it all. It happened when the door closed, she thinks? How strange to only recognise it now, several seconds later. And it's not a good feeling. Not good at all. Torril is dead. Her parents, her friends, everyone. Her world is gone. Penny is homeless.

That's a *lot*. She might have lost herself in that; be crippled by grief. But while Vecna declared himself a god, she just met another one that she prefers. **And *her* god told her to get on with it. So get on with it she shall!**

She checks the sending stones in her backpack, the ones from the sacristy. Another sharp pang of grief for their friends there. For Mayastan, revived from death only to fall in battle at Candlekeep mere days later. Poor Gertrude, too, so recently rescued from her prison. Who knows, maybe they made it out somehow. After all - she did.

There are two problems with the stones. One, she has *both* of them. Two, their magic has left them.

Just rocks. Rocks with memories attached. These might be the best rocks she's ever held. She packs them away, very carefully.

The fact of the matter is, whatever that other plane was about, Penny feels renewed. The circumstances are dire, horrifying, yet she feels a strange optimism. She can't explain it. She doesn't know how long she was there, but that experience changed her to the very core.

* Penny heads to the town. There, she'll learn that this is a border town with access to the plane of Bytopia. That's where she was. She spends a while in the bar at an inn talking with people there about what she saw. Those concentric circles? Portal to the Seven Heavens. She could've walked right through.

* The folk here are wild, in the "way out there" sense. She fortunately has the presence of mind to not ask, "what *are* you?!" though it's frequently tempting. They're terribly friendly though and, surprisingly, all seem to speak Common.

* Sigil is - *that* way. It looks like a long way, but she is told by people in town that "distance in the Outlands can be deceptive" - and isn't able to get much of an explanation beyond that. In any case, she has no sending spells, only short range messages. She can't see too far, can't cast spells for helpers or similar, but *she has an orb*. She apologises to Meliki (!) and swaps her amulet attunement for the orb that night. In so doing, she realises in surprise that she had ended up disconnected from all her magic items, except that amulet.

* She vows that every morning thereafter, she will use the orb to try and scry on her friends. Always starts with Arturo. If anyone's smart enough to get here, it'll be him, she thinks; and he *might* be smart enough to realise that if we are to find each other, amulets that prevent detection are unhelpful!



### Back at the tavern

People have been listening to our stories. When Penny starts to describe the town she was at, people recognise parts.

**She was at Trade Gate to start with!**

Not so smart after all.

Well at least she has some idea where to go and how to get there.

(Percentile dice: 55. She has eaten all food she bought there, so we can't cheat with the helm!)

Not long after, the house stops and parks up. Evernone says goodbye to Arturo, seeming to be genuinely sad to see him go. They wish him well. He offers to give them one more big fireball for show, but they say, "No, you should save it for your friends!"

We look to Thorin. "How does this Wind Walk spell work, then?" - and without explaining much, he casts. One minute later, we're clouds; we can't communite.

Penny chooses to lead. She heads off; shed does, after a fashion, know the way to go. Survival: Dirty 20. Chaos dice: We get 7 hours of flying time, then - THUMP - we're changing back in our normal form, stunned and falling - but slowly enough to not be hurt upon landing.

Even so - 300ft every 6 seconds for 7 hours - not bad!

Penny asks, "I take it that wasn't an intentional end?!"

"I think there should have been at least an hour left."

There's a gentle dimming of the light. We're all familiar with it. Light and dark, 12 hours, always. We vote to set up camp.

Thorin's used to being in beast form. Camping in dwarf form - well, it's been a while. Arturo doesn't know either way but trusts things. Penny sets up an Alarm spell to alay Arturo's fears a bit too. Francesc goes foraging, survival 23. Small-animal-and-potato-stew!

Thorin has gone in another direction and asked animals about directions or safety. Seems fine; some stampedes; nothing much close by though. Roving bands of Guardinals - humanoid animals - perhaps that's what the fox at the inn was.

We set up watch. But before then, we chat with Arturo. Francesc double-checks; he's not remembered a thing. Penny thinks he seems happier in some ways! He still pitches in while we set up camp; it's interesting, he seems to know the habit of it, despite having no memory.

Thoughts turn to Arturo again. Penny thinks there's no point "fixing" him - he is what he is. Penny tries Detect Magic; he has Mage Armour, nothing else. Divine Sense shows nothing. There's nothing physically wrong. Francesc History 24, she has some vague idea that there's some mental affliction; a mental break; it's from what he went through. There *are* magical solutions but she's not sure what that might be. Curse removal? Greater restoration? She lacks the abilities.

Penny argues that he's happier as-is. The TL;DR, ignorance is bliss! Francesc asks Arturo what *he'd* do. He says he's not bothered - he's happy as he is.

Thorin has Greater Restoration. He convinces Arturo that he should try it - Arturo isn't sure. Penny tries to talk Thorin out of it... But persuasion is only 14.

To Penny, the result is actually a bit heartbreaking. The spell - works. All the confidence falls away. He's terrified by wind now. The time he had was terrible. He built up the confidence to protect himself. Some memories do come back, too... And his memories of that very last moment in Waterdeep. And he has *some* answer to the question "How were you saved?"

**He saved himself**.

An explosion of wild magic was a self-preservation trait. It shunted him to where that power came from, unfortunately; he was taken to Pandemonium.

He tells us this. And he tells us about the strange emanation of magic from Vecna, that disabled other magic - inluding the anti-scrying, briefly, which is how we were contacted by the creatures that saved all of us. He also heard the Gem Dragon reach out, he reveals. The thing that ultimately teleported us all away was giving up a magic item. That's why we all lost something, we realise.

He also saw people resisting Vecna collapsing; those who gave up secrets expired too; and a perfect, blue sky world being created in the wake of the wave of annihilation, as if all of reality in Toril had been rewritten, as if Vecna was, always has been, and always will be the most powerful being for all time.

Penny puts a hand on his shoulder. "That confidence you had just a few moments ago *was warranted*. You had the power to save yourself. That took a god, a lich and a seer to save the rest of us. That you could do such a thing, and see so much more than we did, shows you _are_ more powerful than all of us."

Thorin apologises, having realised he did something rough. But he reassures Arturo as best he can. We found ourselves again. He can, too.

Watch.

* Arturo: Perception 14. He's on watch but distracted by the flood of new memories.
* Thorin: Perception 19. Uneventful. The only thing odd in the otherwise "night" - always something unsettling to him - is the lack of stars in the sky. There's just the cluster of lights in the centre; the distant constellation that is Sigil.
* Francesc: Perception 12. She's dealing with the anger. And the guilt, now. Over what has gone down with Arturo _and_ what happened in battle.
* Penny: Francesc doesn't wake her, but she wakes up away. Perception 11. Doesn't figure out what's bothering Francesc (insight only 10); but they sit there together, quietly.



## Outlands day 2

In the morning, Thorin asks Arturo what he wants to do. The wind thing... He's a bit triggered. And does he still want to go to Trade Gate? He says he feels personally wronged by Vecna. He's worried about the Wind Walk spell, so - mostly really just for colour and reassurance, but with _some_ merit - Penny casts Aid on him before we use Wind Walk and will do so each day we continue this travel. She bolsters Francesc and Thorin too, since the magic allows for it, and there's no point wasting it.

Penny, surival 18 to set the directions; D20 chaos - 8. OK! We get the full 8 hours of travel, though at the very end we get a weak shock of anti-magic pulsing. We're heading away from the spire already.

As we drop down and land, Penny says - "wait, Arturo; you said there was some kind of anti-magic pulse from Vecna? Is he here?" - but people at the Inn, she's told, say that as long as they can remember this has *always* been the case, centred at the spire.

We're in an area now quite familiar to Trade Gate... We could probably just *walk* the next day, says Penny. We could even consider walking now... She's keen; persuasion 17; the others are convinced. It's even just about visible in the distance. 2 hours. Thorin isn't thrilled at "walking" so turns into a beast form immediately! A quetz. soars above us - and we can all ride above it.

By the end of the day - CON saves. 17 for Penny; 22 for Francesc and Thorin; 18 for Arturo. We're not exhausted. But by the time we get to Trade Gate, there's a strange feeling. Not *oppression* but a heaviness in the air; some kind of force or effect in the area "pressing down" on our senses or levity. Thorin and Arturo notice it especially. Penny didn't notice it before, but she was not at her best when first here!

* Thorin (Chaotic Good) feels - low-level told off, without having been told anything.
* Arturo - feels more in control suddenly, but less creative. Is he more in control, or more controlled? He's not sure.

The town is mostly set up as a market. Almost just one big marketplace. "Trade" indeed! Outside the city, on the outskirts, there is a huge plinth of sorts. Stone steps rise to meet it. Hovering above it are a couple of ships! They're moored, on what we guess are "sky docks".

There's a strong air of familiarity about that - the rod visions!
