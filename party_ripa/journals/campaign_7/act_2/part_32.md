# RIPA: Act 2 Part 32
## Session 78 (2025-11-25)
### Campaign day 32, The Grease Pit, Sigil

Following adventures in Krynn, we have five rod segments and are fortunate to be now "formally" joined on our ongoing quest by the very capable Urth. After a very brief moment back in The Outlands we found ourselves in the confusing, giant city of Sigil. Thorin wasted no time in sorting out the party finances, converting our in-case-of-emergency Athas gem currency back to more regular tender and opening an account, with some reserve funds, in passing; after that, it was pub-o-clock; and so it is that we find ourselves in The Grease Pit, with a great deal of tempting food and drink on offer.

Penny, never wasting an opportunity to spoil a good party, noticed a messaging service and tried to contact Alustriel in case she, too, was in the city. A reply came very quickly, indicating two things; that we may have been gone in "Outlands time" for far longer than the two nights that passed for us on Kyrnn; and that she needs to see us urgently. So, Penny goes over to the just-seated party and announces - "Alustriel says we've been gone ages and she needs to see us urgently. First round's on me; what's everyone drinking?"

Time passes; Penny enjoys every second!

On the way out, our eyes are collectively caught by a dubious-looking store tucked in amongst all the eateries - for magical items. It turns out it's a branch of **Aurora's Merchandise** - 12 outlets in Sigil - well, that sounds legit! Inside, the TL;DR is that Thorin finds a special belt. Many of its magical properties are really intended for non-dwarven folk intending to perhaps do better in dwarven society - such as being able to speak dwarven itself! - but it's the constitution benefits it brings that he finds interesting. The list price is 5000gp. There are a couple of alternatives that also improve one's constitution, but *only* do that and cost about the same. There's also a *very* rare item - you wouldn't normally find it anywhere! - a Manual Of Bodily Health, which is something you read and it permanently boosts your constitution - but then it stops working! So that would be something to very much "wait and use at the best time". This seems like too rare an opportunity to pass up, though; we'll get *both* - belt and manual. It's 48 grand... But we have 235K (ish!) in the bank. **No time like the present.**

At least we get 5% off with our bank loyalty card...

...but then we find out that Bags Of Holding cost only 250gp each! "Only". Wow. How times have changed. Urth and Francesc have one; Penny and Thorin buy. The shopkeeper - given what we spent here! - is happy to give us a side room where we're able to do a lot of equipment shuffling, Thorin in particular lightening a substantial burden in his backpack. We also do some exchanges; Thorin and Francesc agree that perhaps the offensive weapon of Knarak's Sunburst Scimitar is better held by our ever-more-tank-like Thorin. It's not like Francesc is short of options for attack!

We also look into healing potions, after Fran's recent brush with death. We splash out on two Superiors, two Greaters. But once she's emptying her backpack, we find - she already had *many* potions, all kicking around at the bottom of the bag!

Well, finally, it's time to go and find Alustriel with the help of the same barrior friend as before. "That's in the fancy part of town!" he says. Then, after a pause, "What are *you* doing there?"

`-_-`

We learn this is the "Ladies Quarter". These are structures with some familiarity in terms of utility, but the sheer *size* of everything boggles the mind. There's a huge bazaar, some kind of market covered in a strange, intricate, carved bone dome must be some *one mile* in diameter! There's some kind of factory complex, stacked in layers of buildings with chimneys and pipes, hundreds of feet high. There's a kind of fortress, the size of a normal typical average city on Toril. All around these major pieces are more manageably sized things - areas of residencial dwellings, or things like the Grease Pit.

"Evil" things, by our prior standards, seem commonplace and somehow mix with the population in everyday ways. Vampires, elementals and so-on; even devils and demons, somehow coexisting here.

The Ladies Quarter has a sort of Parisian apartment block style feel, in pale pink stone, numerous balcones, red and white roses crawling up the building front; Thorin thinks they probably are always in flower. An art nouveau style makes the whole thing feel "grown".

We stop there. "Are you *sure* this is the right address?!"

We explain that we do work for someone here. And Penny notes - "Yeah, she *does* seem like the type that *would!* - we're also given a card. **Tea Street Transit** - **Joden**.

There's only *one* door. Penny realises - oh my. It's not an apartment building. It's *one house* and *she lives in it*. As Penny looks on with disdain, Thorin knocks - well, more bangs on the door. There's an ornate series of magical effects which result in a door knocker "growing" from the surface. We knock on *that*.

Penny remarks, "I swear to the gods that she's doing this all *just to wind me up*."

Unseen servants bring small bowls of water and hand towels. "We're here to see Alustriel" says Penny. A moment later, Alustriel appears, in a flowy gown that looks almost like it's made of moonlight. "You found your way here! *Finally*!" - laden with sarcasm, in Penny's head.

Alustriel offers to give us a room to stay here. Urth and Francesc agree. "Oh! Sorry - um - who are you?" Penny starts to say, "Well, Arturo vanished in a puff of wild -" "Oh! Is this the new Arturo?!" "Wait, what!?" says Penny at the same time as Thorin laughs and shouts out, "Yes it is!"

Alustriel starts to float away upstairs to "give us time to settle in" but Penny calls back, "I thought you said it was urgent!" "But I thought I'd let you settle in..." "Now's good."

We end up in the library, where Mordenkainen is already waiting. There are introductions for Urth. He's feeling awkward and offers to just read the mage notes we found on Krynn.

Alustriel is surprised that we haven't investigated the fifth segment yet! No time. No further ado! Penny retrieves it and Francesc grabs hold. WIS save 24. Thanks to Penny's aura, she can't be frightened, though almost is due to a wave of fear that sweeps over her; then she finds herself in a - swamp? No, not a swamp; a rain forest. Overgrown, large plants. The water level seems like it probably never falls much below ankle height. Huge vines. In front of her, 'an Indiana Jones style' ruined jungle temple, heavily overgrown with foot-thick vines. Flying above and around her are vast insects, dragonfly-like but with 4ft wingspans.

In her vision, Francesc is drawn closer to the temple. The waves of fear keep sweeping over her, but Penny's aura stops her from succumbing. It feels like the vision can't go past the temple entrance somehow; the rod is indicating that the next segment is inside; but for some reason, it can't show more. Magic prevents it. HIS 19. She remembers things we researched before - the sixth segment was related to a plane of Oerth. This must be a tropical area, which means an island near the equator, there being no large land masses though. But that still leaves an enormous search engine! She tries to remember as many details as she can, in case people then can, the information subsequently relayed to someone who knows the plane; the sun is directly overhead, so this does verify the equatorial theory but little else (the vision is happening at midday, then).

Wondering if she can control the vision, Francesc wonders if she walk through the door that the rod can't "open". WIS save 24. She *wills* it so. The door "slides" over her as she moves through in a rather unpleasant sensation that's like walking through jelly. The only thing that stops her from terror at this point is intellectually knowing she isn't physically there, but also Penny's aura and a hand on her shoulder - because *something* here radiates a truly extraordinary aura of fear. All around are dead humanoids, that look like they might have been humanoids. But they have died, along a long foyer entranceway with what look like various traps sprung along the way. The rod takes over again and there's an impression of zooming "a mile a minute" down that corridor and then down, deep, a dungeon far below; the next rod segment is held in skeletal hands attached to a wall of bone in a room with an altar of some kind.

To one side, a presence manifests itself *in her consciousness* that looks like a lich. This place is dark, beyond mere absence of light. Even with her darkvision it's hard to make things out. The lich looks directly at Francesc, licking its parched, broken, necrotic lips and teeth, stretches a finger foward and...

..,just before it touches her, Francesc snaps out of the vision.

Francesc and Thorin - INS/PER - both pick up that Mordenkainen and Alustriel's faces indicate recognition. They know where this is. But also - worry. It confirm where they feared.

Alustriel uses Mage Hand to pluck down a book from a shelf in the library. "It's Oerth. Does this look like the place you saw?" - she shoes Francesc a page with a drawing that's *very* like what she saw in terms of the area. Flora and fauna. "Those are the Serpent Isles, a ring of coral islands near the equator. Not that easy to get to, but thankfully the building your describing - well I think we know what that is."

She flips a few pages and shows a drawing of a temple. Francesc INV 17; it's close enough; not overgrown so much though.

"This used to be a temple to the gods, the nature spirits that the people here worshipped. They're Grung - frog-like tribes - but their civilisation was devoured and is no more! Unfortunately, I think what you saw is a building that we informally call The Tomb Of Wayward Souls. It's a kind of tomb of tempting treasure that draws adventurers or treasure hunters to their death to power, we believe, an arcane soul trap that feeds a lich named Acererak who - until recently - was on another world. And we fear he might have taken the knee to Vecna. We had a run-in with Acererak a - few - years ago, in the jungles of Chult where he had created a similar trap, but used it to feed an ancient fiendish baby (!) - we don't - we don't need to get into it! But it was a bad time for everyone. Whatever he's up to, this is a very elaborate, macabre trap that he uses to devour souls to feed himself."

Alustriel can get us to Oerth and an associate that goes by the name of Bigby could help us get to this Temple. But Mordenkainen says, "Can't you just - open a *gate* to the tomb?" "Ummm... Yes... I guess *technically* I could... Yes, yes I can. It's very powerful magic. I could do it tomorrow?"

Tasha arrives, which surprises Penny - if *she'*s here - what about the keep? Where's Mayastan?! Francesc got a strange vibe last time, but in any case, he's in Sigl. So is *nobody* looking after the Keep?! We can't just use the Helm from Sigil. We need an easy way in and out.

Alustriel somewhat reluctantly says that she has a mirror upstairs that *could* get us to the Outlands. We have to keep *that* quiet. And she can give us the location of a few portals that can get us back again. But there are plenty of other people still there. Mayastan came to Sigil to get various ingredients/components for his magic.

Alustriel also offers to go to the Keep herself; we ask her to check on the place in general and on Mynos in particular. She agrees and heads off.

Once gone, almost forgetting Mordenkainen is there, Penny asks the room in general - "why's she being nice? She's helping!"

Mordenkaienen opines that they were already on a knife edge and information we brought about the spellfire engine changed a lot. He's very worried. With her gone, Penny asks if Mordenkainen has been her before? Yes. So where's the alcohol at - the good stuff?! He reaches behind a pile of books to reveal a bottle of _very_ old Elven wine.

The party mood improves.

MK is worried. Spellfire engine? We're sure it said that? From his book, Urth calls, "YES!" - and MK tells us about a "reality changing device" that was created by people as a sort of thought experiment. They didn't think it was a problem to create it, because the amount of magic required to make it work was *so* high that it could never be achieved. But "spellfire engine" indicates (thinks MK) that Vecna has a way to make this theoretical device practical - and on a really grand scale. Not just targetting areas of a few 100ft, but entire planes.

"We think that may be what he used on Toril, because the reports are that he was *everywhere* at once, which is not something any magic we know of can do; but if you are reshaping reality, well..."

We've heard some of this before, but now the mechanism is clearer.

"We had a theory that the Lady Of Pain closed Sigil so she could stop Vecna from changing *all* of reality, and wait out Vecna. But she's broken that theory by reopening Sigil and we don't know why."

We learn that the Eye of Vecna and Hand of Vecna - artefacts we _think_ we've only heard of in passing? - were destroyed by another group that are invovled; this weakens Vecna but he's responded by ecslating his efforts. As for why we're bringing the rod segments together - we just had a hand-wavey idea of it being a "weapon against him".

"You realise he's elevated himself to beyond being immortal, as lich, but to a godly level? And he's also able to harness the worship of those that believe in him - that's why he wants everyone in Toril to worship him as the 'only and only true god'. Every world he does that to makes him more powerful. We captured another artfact - the Book of Vile Darkness - which is another way he spread his influence. But the rod - we believe one of its many powers is to bring order to chaos. Help figure out why or how he has been able to become a god so that we can undo it. **As long as he is a god we can't defeat him! But if we can isolate him from this source of power he can be at least banished**."

He continues: "**As long as he *is* a god he can't enter Sigil.** None can enter, by decree. It's just how this place is designed. Sigil was closed so his *followers* can't come. But now it's open again."

He has to go. But he gives us an address; "If you are in need of, say, another perspective - my door is always open. In case I don't see you before I head off, *do not make the mistake of underestimating Acererak*."

An 8ft tall lady arrives - impressive but certainly eccentric - who turns out to be Alustriel's wife!

* Do we want to spend time at the tower?
* Shall we meet Mayastan? He seemed perhaps unhealthily interested in the rod
* Thorin agrees - him splitting off from the Keep leans into that
* What about Acererak - defences against that fear effect, or liches

Penny thinks we should catch up with Mayastan in Sigil. We'll have to trust Alustriel for the Keep.
