# RIPA: Act 2 Part 5
## Session 51 (2024-10-22)
### Wreckage of the Lambent Zenith in the Astral Sea, Sigil day 5

We are atop the stern section of the wrecked Lambent Zenith, learning of many hazards and how the three sections of the ship have been unable to contact one another. The crew on the stern are very wary of us, having defended against both monsters and others who wanted the rod. We recognise a description of our rival group that we encountered back at Toril. Evidently, while we had been lost in the Outlands, they had overtaken us.

The bow section has various protections that meant, even if we could get there without being overwhelmed by attacking creatures along the way, we would die regardless should we lack the means to deactivate the defenses. On this note, we have just been joined by a haggard-looking elf, a sort of hippie-vibe, who has greeted Thorin-snake in Druidic, evidently having immediately recognised his nature.

* The two githyanki, Lysan and Zastra are here; we have found the creche-mate
* Half-orc cook Kycera is here too; we have found the necklace's owner
* This new character is most likely someone referred to as Daveras, but is *not* part of the crew - they got caught up in this mess somehow and their arrival appears to be related to the giant tree sprouting from the ship's severed midsection
* Our two Hadozi 'allies' are nearby trying to 'secure' this dead god's husk as valuable bounty, but are most likely unaware of how dangerous the environment really is - they are at least temporarily accompanied by Arturo's spectral dragon
* Kycera has mentioned several names; "Ilren" is someone who will be hard to persuade; "Figaro" knows how to access the bow but has lost his mind; he's locked in a state room, apparently somewhere in this section of the wreck

"Hello, friend" responds Thorin!

"Why are you here? Are you friend or foe?"

Thorn tries to explain. And then, inevitably, the question of how we expect to rescue people comes up. We explain about the ship, but acknowledge the teleport interference and so-on. **Daveras** explains that this is a kind of "gravity well" for Spelljamming hulls - they get dragged in when getting close. Monsters seem to be attracted here - it seems to have escalated over a few weeks.

Perhaps the rod itself is causing interference; bending space, somehow. Teleportation magic certainly misbehaves.

They've seen at least two void scavvers around and more of the strange 'fish' that attacked us. Daveras has tried as the rest of his family - his blink dog and Treant are stuck on the midsection - ah, the giant oak tree! - because that's where they crashed originally. They had been trying to escape space clowns.

So we have to figure out how to move between sections; and how to get into the front section. That needs Figaro.

Penny helped Arturo - persuasion 23; Thorin and Francesc - insight 23.

* Daveras in particular talks about he's never met this Figaro person
* Figaro apparently got quite paranoid after Ilren arrived
* Ilren has acted like a de facto 1st Mate (and is on this section somewhere)
* He's essentially a leader
* Thorin figures Ilren might not be acting in entirely good faith...

Arturo tries to find out more about Figaro. He's begun talking to himself; seems very shifty; losing his memory; flashes of lucidity; but then periods of mania when he might rush out of the room and warn people their lives are in danger.

Maybe it's a spell? Arturo arcana 9, shrug, Thorin 18. He's not aware of a spell that'd make someone behave quite this way as described, but there are spells which mess with your head somewhat, and perhaps if finely manipulated, might cause the behaviour exhibited. Thorin thinks it would be very difficult to diagnose even if stood in front of the affected person.

Arturo looks to the distance, trying to find the Hadozi. He suspects he might lose his concentration on the dragon soon; they're about 200ft away; he moves to get as close as he can to *just* connect with it. He finds it's already in battle! At least this means the Hadozi don't need too much convincing to come back to the ship stern with the dragon. ADV persuasion only 11, though. It takes a while, surprisingly! They don't want to leave the riches... But eventually they get convinced by the dragon just giving up and starting to leave.

This impresses the Gith - they revere dragons. But they're not too happy with the Hadozi and want to stay up there to keep an eye on them.

Thorin returns to his dwarf form and we make our way down below in search of Ilren. On the deck immediately below, in the far stern, we find a big state room - with two dead bodies, carefully wrapped as if people cared for them. So we try the room around the mast, opposite the kitchen.

"Ah! So you're the new people!" says a booming voice - it's a Giff, elaborately dressed in blue, white and gold, hat on the table and hand on an unusual-looking device that is probably some kind of weapon - but we don't know how it might work.

Penny asks - and the question is dodged, so she has to push the issue - how come the giff is here by themselves. The rest of his crew died, the claims; some 20 or so... Francesc insight 24, he's not actually sure how many crew there were! She's not sure what it is; but _something_ is up. He claims to have been First Mate. It was on a "big ship", but he thinks it was blown to smithereens - he claims barrels onboard of a powerful substance exploded.

He claims to have leadership thrust upon him; the previous 1st Mate appeared to have "lost his marbles, poor chap!"

Penny gives up after a bit and casts Zone Of Truth - it works!  She warns her own party that the spell is active as some of them fell to it too, so we must all be careful with our words.

The conversation dances around a fair bit. He evades a lot of questions, enough to tell us that he's got something to do with Figaro's state of mind, dodges all questions about what he's here for, what he's done; he truly didn't remember how many were on his crew. Penny asks if he really is what he appears to be - "are any of us?" is the evasive question. That sounds bad; he's over-confident and probably not actually a Giff.

Arturo sends Penny Message; to grab the gun. After a while - she decides do... And her hand passes right through it.

A bizarre creature; a kind of frog, long limbs, toad mouth, horns on its head, sharp teeth, smells of putrefaction. Oh dear (a death slaad).

"See? I *told* you it wasn't a giff..." says Penny, as we roll Initiative.

* Francesc 29
* Thorin 17
* Arturo 11
* Penny 5 - swaps with Arturo

Francesc forces her way into the room (tho we're all aware that being crowded together into this small space is probably exactly what the creature wants, given it's been hiding down here this whole time rather than going up on deck). She shoots, hits and does 18 damage. A second hits too, for 12 more.

Francesc is examining the creature through Hunter's Mark. It seems resistant to lightning, thunder, cold, fire and acid. 

Thorin brings down L5 Moonbeam - 17 damage on that round, but it takes half as it makes its CON save. Then he tries to get out of the way & Moonsteps just outside the room.

Penny gets in a solid Divine Smite hit for 28 damage. A second hit lands for 13 damage. At least it's starting to look a bit messed up... But then it turns invisible. Penny calls a warning; it pushes past her and out past Thorin - she can still just about see it via Blindsight; but her opportunity attack, in her surprise, misses wildly (nat 1). She notes that as it moved, *its wounds seemed to be healing*.

Arturo has his dragon on deck outside and knows it has 30ft blindsight, so hopes it'll catch the slaad as it leaves. For his part, he tries to opportunity-attack the creature directly (disadv.) as it leaves the room, swinging wildly since he can't see it; it's a miss too.

Thorin uses an opportunity attack spell. Starry Wisp. That's also a miss!

On deck, the crystal dragon sees the slaad emerge. It hits with a claw, doing 11 points more damage. Arturo runs outside and sees the dragon engaged, communicating telepathically, and tries a magical attack but it fails. The dragon gets in a breath attack for 7 force damage, then it gets another rend attack for 13 more damage (piercing).

Francesc runs out and onto the exposed deck outside, then despite advantage, gets two hits! Plain guesswork (disadv attacks) but aided by Hunter's Mark. 9 damage; then 12 damage, but with Ensnaring Strike - but it struggles free.

One of the Githyanki from above jumps down, sword high, "Why are you attacking the crew?!" Penny shouts, "The giff is a strange frog monster that was in disguise and that's why Figaro went crazy..." - persuasion a lucky 18+9->27. The second one is jumping down now. They don't entirely believe her but aren't attacking either.

Thorin pushes through the growing crowd outside and manages to get Dispel Magic out to the Slaad - which then becomes visible. *That* persuades the Gith! He uses Moonlight Step again to get behind it, floating just off the side of the ship.

Penny runs up alongside, swipes twice with the sun blade; nope - nothing. Misses both. As it starts to move away, she gets an opportunity attack hit for (a rather low) 9 damage (2d8+5). Thorin misses with a ranged spell (disadv), and it keeps going - but then, just before it gets too far out and the dragon gets an opportunity attack, it throws a fireball! DEX saves:

* Francesc 20
* Arturo 20
* Penny 19 (saves)
* Thorin 17 (just misses but has fire resistance)
* Gith both make it

29 potential damage, 14 for anyone who saved.

Arturo tries Subtle Spell, which works, causing 29 psychic damage and the creature is incapacitated. Now the dragon acts, too. It hits for 10 force damage with the breath weapon, plus a further 24 piercing damage. Both of the claws pincer it in its sides, grabbing it and pulling it as the breath shreds the material form of the slaad!

Arcana / religion rolls - all three roll arcana 21 except Penny, religion 24. The first three feel as if a magical beacon has been turned off, while Penny senses a sudden absence of something - a background evil that had been "loud" but unnoticed. Shreds of suffering float out and away into space... This creature was made from suffering. It fed on it.

Well, we've certainly earned the trust of the Gith! They insist on taking us down to see Figaro. And in turn Arturo tells them that we think this creature's "beacon" had been drawing creatures near. (Arturo also wants to check the corpse, but there's no corpse to check).

Thorin heals Francesc 11hp, but she in turn casts Healing Spirit; it takes a little longer but adds 18hp more. She throws more out to the other crew too. Penny helps Arturo come right up to the top.

So, at last, we get down below and reach the room where Figaro is hiding away.

(On the way, Penny remembers - the Hadozi! They were left alone on deck. We run up to check but they're gone. Thorin, perception 27; a piece of tail off the side of the ship; they're hanging off deck, where the section is crashed, mining! We leave them to it.)

(IRL, the druid is down there - "what was all that banging"? Penny, "Ilren wasn't real..." "He was real, I gave him a massage!" Penny, "Euw, did you wash you hands after?" Francesc, "Did you even use your hands?"... Thorin needs a CON save to hold Moonbeam from laughing so much.

At the door, Penny knocks and tries to introduce herself and say that we know Ilren was  in disguise and evil, and we've killed him.

A muffled "who is that? I can't hear you!" - the door is opened and we see, inside, just a strange opaque wall of force. The female Gith walks right up to it, shouts right into it - "Figaro take this damned thing down right now!"

The spell drops. A very haggard tiefling, clutching a robe pulled around as if a bathrobe, stands there. Spellbooks are scattered all around. They come up to the door. "Why are you all being so rude to me?"

Arturo whispers; "Detect magic?" - so Penny casts. There's obviously a powerful abjuration spell encasing the room. In fact, it's *very* powerful. There might also be something quite powerful in the room - some other spell effect, on a wall.

Penny feigns an academic interest and asks about the spell on the wall. "Well, that's one of the wards! I don't know the activation word for it... You know, Inda!" "But I thought the wards were all at the bow?" "No! We spread them around - security, you understand!"

Thorin tries to persuade him, with Penny's help, to leave the room. 16. Nope! "I'm the reason everything is going wrong!"

"Why do you say that?"

"Because of the people dying and the attacks and everything."

"But that was Ilren!"

"No, I'm the reason! I remember!"

Penny Arcana 20+4. She recalls reading of magic that changes memories. Nasty stuff. Permanent, so far as she knows?

Arturo tries to go with logic. He runs through step by step things that have happened (as we know it) vs his memory and where he was. Persuasion 22, this does cause a bit of doubt and it's enough for him to dispel his cube of force.

Within our party, we discuss options to try and help. We don't really know. The best thing Thorin can think of is Greater Restoration; so, he gives it ago.

And it works! Wow.

It's as if a light comes on in the eyes. Then he gets fearful; "There's a death slaad on board!" he yells. "Cirrit! Where's Cirrit! He captured Cirrit!" but nobody else seems to understand. It's the Bosun. "What? Has nobody seen her in ages? What's going on here?"

Clearly the death slaad has been busy.

Thorin and Francesc can't find anything (Investigation). Arturo tries (19). He wanders into a bedroom while Penny is still in the main room (21, rolled a while later). Penny clomping around in the other room makes floor boards creak and a voice from *below* asks, "Is anyone there?!"

So they're below.

The Gith tell us there are no stairs down there! Arturo has a crowbar and we manage to pry up a floorboard. Casting Light, we see a very well dressed 3ft gnome. A rope is dropped and she climbs. She seems very fond of the Gith - but they don't seem to remember her and she's crestfallen - but appears to know what Ilren was doing. "We need to get him! I caught him modifying Figaro's memories" - "We already got him..."

Apparently, she'll be able to nurse the others back to their full memories over a period of time.

Arturo asks if Figaro remembers the ward words now! "Well here's the problem - I did know what the word was, but then I told Inda for security reasons that we should probably not have lots of people know the words. So I - ummm - I don't know what the word is now." Turns out she's wearing some kind of anti-scrying device too that stops people being able to find her or communicate at a distance. But he claims Dispel Magic should work... You just need to be quite skilled!

Francesc insight 18, there's something bothering him. There's something he isn't saying. Not about the rune. She mentions that to the group so Penny 'fesses up - "We know about the rod fragment. We're here to rescue people, but we *are* to try and collect it, too..." - but there's something else. He doesn't want to talk in front of people.

Penny turns around and simply says, "Could everyone just fuck off for a bit?!"

People make excuses about finding bed space for us and stuff, since we need to rest. It's just four strangers and Figaro and Penny's 20 persuasion. Oddly, being surrounded by people you don't know and only just met can create trust.

"Well we have - I *hope* we have - a piece of the rod. We were trusted with it. We had to escape Trade Gate with it; we were given chase. We didn't really know what it was at the time. We were given it by a Halfling wizard on a mission of great importance; I teleported them away as they had another mission of great importance (!) but then studied the rod..."

He shows signs of guilt.

"Very powerful. It has the ability to warp space. I found a way to harness some of its magic to power the ship's helm... Now in and of itself that is not dangerous! *However*... We were still being followed. I didn't know. Within a day of entering any new plane as we tried to get where we wanted to go, other people would appear, chasing us. I couldn't figure out how, so I plotted a shortcut. There's a part of the Astral Sea where detection, teleportation and other high level magic doesn't work the way it should, so I... I plotted a course through here. And we crashed. Nobody knows this except me."

Arturo tells him it worked out the best way it could have! He argues that people died. But now we're trapped he says... Penny, persuasion Nat 20 + 9 -> she *does* know what the rod is. Sigil is closed. It's *that* bad now; Vecna rises again. If he hadn't done what he did, sure, maybe the ship wouldn't have crashed; maybe those died would live - but countless others, whole *worlds*, might have died.

At the mention of us being at the fall of Toril, he checks his books; it's described as what might amount in Douglas Adams parlance to "Mostly Harmless". But it does mention, almost as an afterthought, that: "For some reason, major battles seem to be fought here often. Is this because it is considered low value territory, or is there some other reason?"

We mention that we've seen other worlds fall too - be invaded - the visions. We describe as best we can since he seems interested. History 20 Penny, 19 Arturo. Figaro identifies two possible worlds - **Athas** - the book he has includes many pages about it, apparently a very major, magically powerful world, but magic got ripped apart and it is cut off from the rest of the multiverse. The other, perhaps going through something similar, but instead of being cut off for thousands of years was cut off relatively recently. That world is **Eberron**. The city we saw would, in that case, be the capital city, called **The Spire**.

Francesc asks if he knows *why* the death slaad might have been here. "I think they get drawn to intense suffering!" - Penny recognises that this is a give-away about how guilty he feels, even though his demeanour now is rather more forthright and factual, as we distract him with questions and descriptions.

We all try to rest. Kycera insists on cooking a meal. Three courses of immaculately presented fine dining food are presented!

### Short rest

(End of act 2, part 5)
