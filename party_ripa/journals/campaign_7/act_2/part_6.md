# RIPA: Act 2 Part 6
## Session 52 (2024-11-12)
### Wreckage of the Lambent Zenith in the Astral Sea, Sigil day 5

We've had a short rest and are prepared to try and move to another section of the ship. There is some worry about Cirrit; has she been hurt in some way by the creature that imprisoned her?

Thorin checks (Medicine 5+5), no idea; Penny gets lucky; 17+2 -> 19. All she can really do is speak to her; ask questions about what she remembers; Cirrit in the end decides she doesn't mind, in private, being inspected closely. Penny discovers a scar that Cirrit doesn't recognise - it's on her back, below the rib cage. Penny pushes gently around the area and, very worryingly, founds golf ball sized objects that do move a little as she pushes.

Cirrit is of course very alarmed! Penny tries to persuade her to remain calm; 21; Penny asks her to wait a moment and goes outside to ask for help. The trouble is that we need a cleric and Cirrit *is* the cleric!

TL;DR - Cirrit is given a lot to drink, Kycera can cleanly reopen at the scar and Arturo reckons he can use Telekensis to cleanly extract the eggs without touching.

Cirrit drinks a couple of mugs of ale, but is still not really at all drunk - hardy constitution! - while Kycera distils some brandy to try and create a form of simple sterilisation. On Cirrit's *fifth* mug of beer - she finally passes out! 40 straight minutes of heavy drinking.

Now's the time. Kycera will make the incision; then another clean knife is to be used to hold it open without actually touching; then again to withdraw eggs. DEX 16 for Francesc and Nat 20 for Kycera working together. Now we can see them! Slightly translucent spheres with things wriggling inside, just below the surface. They seem to be somehow connected by tiny vessels to the rest of Cirrit, which is unexpected. Now they need carefully lifting out and cutting free. Arturo's on it. Skill check on spell casting modifier 14; it's not clean, it's a bit tangled; Kycera tries to cut cleanly around. 22 on dex. Success. Thorin, medicine check 19, stops the bleeding easily. Francesc looks closely; perception 17; there are four more eggs, but one is quite a bit further down that maybe connects to the others. Perhaps getting just that one out will bring the others with them. But it's risky.

Penny casts Aid to +5 HP Cirrit just in case. Arturo and Francesc get that bonus too. Might help if we're fighting our way between ship sections.

Arturo - 21 on a DC 20 - he manages to lift the egg out magically. Medicine check from Thorin is only 8; he cuts, as he must; Arturo can lift the 4 eggs away, but Cirrit takes 9 damage from the bleeding. Francesc could help but her hands are busy holding things open, so Penny is called over, who pushes 9 back in from the hands-on pool to fix things internally. Finally, with everything closed up and a bit more healing, Penny uses hands-on healing to purify from poison, just in case.

Well, all good. Cirrit is well. But now we have the five eggs. What do we do with them? Penny's inclined to destroy them; they're literally misery personified. We take them up on deck and Penny casts Sacred Flame - unlike regular fire or ice, which didn't really hurt the adult creature, radiant damage does the trick. 17 damage destroys them completely.

And now, the crew suddenly look *completely* exhausted. They realise they're safe; things are solved; and that relief is coupled with their suddenly-acknowledged fatigue.

We figure that these people would be (in the nicest possible way) baggage if we try to move between hulls and get attacked. We'd be better off on our own, if we know the things to watch out for from Figaro. We have to trust the Hadozi to look after the people we leave behind - the lack of a spirit dragon gives them some reason to comply - but Arturo, nat 1 on persuasion, they want the dragon back! Penny, intimidation *28*, convinces them that if we *do* bring the dragon back, she'll have it eat them. Do what they're told! They comply, but even then they're not done asking for things - Kycera is pressed into action making them food.

Before we go, Thorin and Penny talk about destroying the sigil ward on this section, since we don't know the passwords. In the end Penny tries Dispel Magic; nat 19 rolled plus 5, so 24, and it's obliterated. Figaro know there's one more, in the midsection. The rod itself is protected by a simple lock once the two wards are down, in the Captain's Quarters, bow section.

Time to go.

The midsection is stuck on the far side of the dead god. We get up onto the high stern deck and launch ourselves off. Penny moves fast thanks to the Headband of Intellect. Thorin and Francesc are next. Arturo is the slowest, but it's still faster than walking so we stick together and go at that rate.

Thorin and Penny lead; Francesc and Arturo behind; we're using Pass Without A Trace and trying to be stealthy. Stealth:

* Francesc 29
* Arturo 26
* (Disadv) Thorin 21
* (Disadv) Penny 19 (with +10)

Penny, perception 11; distracted by the sight of the dead "god" below. Thorin 18 is highest. He sees - a little later than he might like, at about the half way point - that emerging from either side are what can best be described as a deformation of the blackness around that moulds and reflects colours of light around. It's almost like looking at something through a glass of water. "THAT doesn't look good!" shouts Thorin, pointing. Penny lights the Sun Blade, which causes reflections to be visible on these strange effects, now about 20ft away, moving slowly our way.

There seem to be 25ft long shark-like shapes making up this strange distortion, with mouths open - just giant maws - as best we can make out. Above where the head seems to be, an eyelid peels back and a clearly visible dark crimson eye is visible, clearly looking at us. Initiative!

* Francesc 25
* Thorin 25
* Penny 20
* Arturo 18

Francesc goes first, as Thorin asks if she knows what their vulnerabilities might be. She throws Hunter's Mark on the one to our right and immediately learns that these creatures are neither vulnerable, nor resistant to anything... Almost mundane, appearance notwithstanding. She fires at the one on the right, 31 to hit does hit; 13 damage. It's Slowed down a little too. She pulls away from them both and fires again at the same one. This time, it's only 18, but that still hits. Her ability to damage another nearby foe isn't effective as the other creature is a bit too far. 15 more damage.

Thorin brings L4 Moonbeam into the mix. CON 17 save for that same creature (a void scavver). It fails, taking a solid 24 damage. He turns into a giant scorption again, which *just* means the void scavver thinks it might not be able to engulf him anymore. The injured one seems to be heading his way, but then spots someone else it wants to target... And it chooses Arturo. Its eye swings around and tries to influence Francesc with some sort of fear attack; WIS save, 17; she *just* resists the effect.

The scavver now tries to gulp up Arturo - 22 to hit! It would cause a horrify 49 damage, tho Penny reacts with her ability to reduce that a little, by d10->4+4->8. Still a really nasty 41. DEX save, fortunately in aura range for a +5 bonus, and it requires a re-roll but 22. He avoids being swallowed.

Penny ignores the uninjured one and heads straight for the one on Arturo. She hits with the sword, doing 13 damage, then adds a Blinding Smite for an additional 14. She swings again; it hits for 15 damage. She moves so that this injured scavver's body is positioned between her and the as-yet uninjured other one.

To the rest of our astonishment, having no idea that he had this ability, Arturo transforms - Tasha's Otherworldly Guise - he's drawing on memories of otherworldly planes. He becomes some kind of partly spectral abyssal harpy! He lashes out using his staff as a weapon, with advantage due to the blinding smite. 28 to hit, 9 damage; strikes again, 20 to hit, 13 damage. It's looking really rough.

Now the other scavver acts. It has a very different idea from its counterpart and goes for Thorin-scorpion, but first, having seen what's happening to the others, throws its ray of fear on Penny. Lucky roll again; 27; not at all afraid. Now the scavver attacks Thorin, 23 to hit; connects; 57 piercing! Fortunately, he's especially hardy thanks to his beast form and while it's a huge hit, it's not fatal. DEX save (and he's still close to Penny for the +5) - 22 even without the aura. It seems though that the scavvers *are* large enough to give that a try, provided they're up for giving it the attempt.

Francesc fires again on the nearly-down scavver. It's a really low roll despite advantage; 3 and 2 + 13 -> 16, but it *is* just enough! Total damage is 17. This time, the other scavver is hurt by her ability too, so 6 more to the previously uninjured one. Second attack - hits - 19 more to the badly injured one. But then, at the last moment, Thorin's moonbeam kills it outright. Francesc moves Hunter's Mark.

One down, one to go. Penny uses Channel Divinity - Healing Touch to heal Arturo by 2d8+2 -> 11, heads over to the remaining void scavver... She repeats her actions before; only 18 damage but it's blinded. She hits again, but the damage rolls are extremely low; only 8 damage in total.

Arturo tries to attack this scavver too and thanks to the blinding advantage hits twice, for 15 damage across both.

Now the blinded scavver tries to act. It's still blinded for now. It tries to attack one of the three creatures now in close proximity - which happens to be Thorin-scorpion - but is at disadvantage. 15 to hit; that's a miss. It does recover it's fear ability, but can't use it because blinded, and it fails its CON 18 save, so for now, stays blind. Surrounded and blinded, Moonbeam is still upon it and while this time it resists half of the damage, it still takes 11.

Due to a quirk of Arturo's wild magic, both Thorin and Penny are surprised to suddenly start hearing incongruous, melodic, ethereal music, as if playing a soundtrack - yet Arturo himself appears as a very scary demon. It's a very bizarre combination.

Francesc - ADV 27 to hit; 20 damage. Fires again, and despite low ADV rolls does hit; 17 more damage. It's now looking fairly messed up and is starting to thrash about. Thorin-scorpion attacks three times. First one - CRIT! The next two attacks make their mark too. 15, 3, 5 damage; and it is unlucky, failing its CON save for poison, 4d10->20 damage. Penny also attacks and hits twice; 9 then 19 damage. On that second attack, nothing supernatural happens; no disintegration or explosion, on movement to another plane. It just dies, as the other had, but this one isn't burned. The skin no longer refracts light and we instead see a crystalline-scaled, large shark-like creature.

Penny wants to spend a *bit* of time to study the creature. But this time it's a low roll, only 11 total and Thorin doesn't do any better. We think that if we spent a long time skinning one, maybe an hour or so, we might have the raw material for a quite special kind of cloak. Arturo wonders if he can push the carcass towards the stern section of the ship, wondering if they keep drifting or just stop. We manage to push it slowly; if we let go, it slowly keeps moving. We try to eyeball things to see if it's going roughly the right way.

Penny suggests that's good enough and it's a long shot if we can make use of it anyway. She suggests getting to the midsection before being attacked again. On the way, she's able to move fast enough to keep up - more or less - with Arturo's speed *and* drain the last of her healing pool for 11 more to him.

We see what looks like two ships, up close. There's some kind of skiff and the tree grows from that. It's smashed into the midsection of the galleon. It seems quite badly damaged here; much in fact seems held together only by the roots of the tree and bits of skiff. We can land on a small patch of deck, but Thorin won't fit in his large form. Penny moves ahead a bit and shouts, "We're here as friends - are you Daveras's treant friend?". She tries Common and Elvish and Arturo, getting the gist of things, then tries Sylvan.

The tree bough moves, as if "changing direction". The top parts and there's a smaller part in the middle with smaller branches and leaves which reveals what are a sort of face, in the tree bark (Thorin returns to his normal form and casts Speak With Plants). The Treant speaks in a language Penny doesn't understand but Arturo does, since it's Sylvan. The edges of its branches open suddenly with red and white blossoms.

"I haven't heard my language in a long time! Do you come to seek me? Are you here to combat the Grell? Are you here to fix things?"

Arturo says we're in part here to save everyone - but doesn't know what Grells are.

"There's a nest of Grell who are - do you not know Grell? They're like... Brains with squid legs and parrot beaks. Quite savage and territorial! They have decided to create a nest inside the ship. It stops me being able to get to Icasa, who is trapped deeper down inside. Icasa was trying to find a way to help... Have you seen my friend? I see that you look like you've arrived from elsewhere."

We explain, translating through Arturo. Icasa is the Blink Dog. Arturo says we'll try to help. Icasa is stuck because teleportation doesn't work.

"He went down to the study to try and find something could help us... He has a collar that helps him speak and understand the common language."

Penny asks via Arturo if the Treant knows how many there are. He doesn't know; there's a nest and they move around his roots. Arturo, arcana 11, is enough to know that they're aberrations. He can't guess at more. They must see in some special way; no eyes.

Before we even consider it, we try some healing. Thorin helps Arturo with Cure Wounds, for a solid 13 more. He's not far off his normal max now, given Aid prior. Then Francesc helps Thorin with Healing Spirit. This takes a little while but it's worth waiting for the effect to be maximised. Works out as 5d6 -> 5+1+2+5+1 -> 14, unlucky rolls but better than nothing.

"Well, let's go and fight an unknown number of brains with beaks. I mean, how bad can it be?" says Penny.

How do we get down? *Where* do we even go? The treant's name is **Redbud**. He says he can move some of his roots aside so we can climb down into the shattered hold of the skiff, to get closer to the nest.

Arturo has a great idea for looking down there. He casts Light on a potato and slowly rolls it down into the space! It gives some insight into a space with chairs and a table all strewn around; when it drops again with a Thud, there's a strange high-pitched whistling, almost like a steam kettle boiling, and there are clacking noises - muffled - of beaks closing. It's close, although not immediately below us and Arturo can't actually *see* them. He's not sure why the creatures aren't moving; they seem to be staying where they are.

Working from sound, he goes back up onto the higher deck and tries a Clairvoyance spell to 'see' below that area. Now he sees a small space, with - as best he can count - at least 6 Grell. He can't see the Blink Dog though, nor hear it via the spell. He relays this information to the party and suggests that he casts Fireball. At this, Redbud objects strongly! It would very seriously hurt his roots, as they're all around that area. In fact, those roots may well have successfully sealed off the studywhere Icasa is trapped - which stops him escaping, but protects him from the Grell.

Arturo with Penny's help, convinces Redbud to withdraw roots in strategic areas that will let Arturo cast Cone Of Cold on the Grell without him being hurt and without hurting Icasa. He moves things a bit as previously described, so that there's a small hole which allows us to drop in there. We can sneak inside, count down for root removal and coordinate the attack.

We drop down quietly, using PWAT for extra stealth. Arturo goes first. Francesc is at the back. Penny behind Arturo, Thorin alongside.

Aruturo taps the roots and they're withdrawn. *ADV* initiative:

* Arturo 28
* Thorin 24
* Francesc 19
* Penny 13

Exactly to plan! Arturo goes first. The Cone of Cold surprises us - it's vast! (60ft) - at 8d8 damage to every single Grell, with roots completely pulled away from the blast zone not just on our floor, but above and below. It seems Redbud understood our intent very well. The damage rolls require a lot of rerolls, not all with great outcomes, but ultimately there's 40 damage - well above the half way of the 64 maximum. CON 19 saves for all Grell. All but one fail, taking 40 damage - and they seem to take all of that, looking very badly injured as a result. The remainder takes 20.

220 damage. Might be a party record.

The one that took 20 damage flies at Arturo and tries a tentacle grapple, which he dodges easily; then it snaps with the beak; he throws up a Shield and it deflects against the wall of force.

Thorin goes all-in - *L6* Moonbeam. 44 damage max for four of the already badly-injured Grell, CON 17 saves. Even though two make their save, it's enough to take them all down either way. Then he turns into... A giant frog.

Francesc acts. She puts Hunter's Mark on the one that's attacking Arturo, and shouts out a warning that these creatures are *immune* to lightning. Shoot it in the face! 25 to hit, for a huge 23 damage; goes again, 17 to hit hits, only 12 damage but it's enough - that Grell drops - but 4 gets transferred to the other heavily injured grell too.

Penny only has one left. She gets in a solid hit with the sun sword, doing 16 damage; and that's it. They're all gone!

Radiant and moon beam sun scorches scar the decking, but around that are frost-covered planks and the back wall of the ship has been blasted out into Wildspace beyond, encased in ice chunks.

Redbud is delighted! He withdraws a last root, guarding the study. Sat, scared-looking, is a blink dog sat next to a desk. "Woah! That was crazy! I could hear all kinds of strange stuff out there! You must be friendly, if Redbud has withdrawn his roots. My name is Icasa! What's your name?"

We introduce ourselves and, when asked, explain why we're here, at least the short version. Icasa tells us that the grell followed the skiff here. When we say that we came here knowing they were there, we say that Daveras told us - his ears pick up and look happy; then go flat; then come back up. Penny asks what's wrong - with Arturo's encouragement, ADV persuasion is 20. He whispers to the two of us specifically.

"I'm glad that Daveras has survived... I feel so guilty, I thought he had died and I thought he had died without me having ever told him the truth! I just kept thinking about how important it would be to tell him what I know, but I think that's because I thought he was dead and now I know he's *not* dead, I'm not sure I can bring myself to tell him!"

Arturo offers to help; but he says, "I don't think you can..." He looks very worried, as only dogs can; "Well... So... I... We... How much do you know about the** **Verdant Branch**". We haven't heard that. "It's the ship that we were on. Not this! This is the life boat - Redbud, Daveras and I managed to escape on it, but Redbut was piloting the Vedrant Branch. I never told Daveras - he believes that we were the only ones who survived the pirate attack. But we're not! **Palenna Tindertoe**, Daveras's oldest friend, well - that very clever Halfling snuck away. I saw her sneak away. But we can't tell Daveras this as he thinks she's honourable and good. And in a way she is... But she's also... Well... Palenna comes first, always. The moment she thought we weren't going to succeed I saw her sneak away, kick off from the ship and she used her mind to just float away. She's somewhere in the Astral Sea. I couldn't tell him that - I told him she'd died - and that's the only reason he took the lifeboat. I couldn't bring myself to tell him."

Then at random he asks, more loudly, if we have a lockpick. "Yes", says Thorin. "Great!" - he pulls aside the desk and there, we see a rune, as well as a lockbox. "I've read everything in here. Lots of books! But I haven't been able to get into this! Into this Lockbox..."

He pulls it out. When he drops it on us, we see a kind of flickering failing illusion - it used to look convincingly as a book. Thorin Perception, 24; he notices that there's nothing magical other than this now-failing illusion effect. It's failing perhaps because magic is in general. getting stranger and stranger in this area. The lock, though, has some kind of trap... He can't figure out how to disable it, but can tell it would break a vial of - and he looks very carefully - most likely, poisonous gas. Only Thorin can tolerate that, so the rest of us clear the room and leave him to it!

SOH check 13 - just scrapes the DC! - the box opens, but the gas spills out. ADV CON save, not good... 11. Unfortunately, he does end up poisoned but his resistance means he's not actually poisoned for a while. He'll be able to sleep it off, though.

Inside the box is a journal and a potion. He calls the rest of us in. Turns out it's a Potion of Mind Reading. The journal has descriptions of missions and tasks, and strange code-speak. We also see enough evidence that we figure the journal *belongs to Inda* - some of it is written in what we recognise, but can't read as Celestial.

And on the last pages? She's written down the password:

* **The moon sings a song for the lost**

She also mentions that at her next possible opportunity, she must talk to someone about reconfiguring the security on the ship. The ward is very powerful but she's discovered it's only warding the *front* of the safe. Someone with the right tools could just melt the side away!

She's concerned about the crew's mental state on the Astral Sea. The journey has been difficult, more perils than unusual; some crew members have had nightmares that they normally do not have. She vows to get to the bottom of that at the Radiant Citadel.

At this, Penny, who had been keen to dispel the rune in the room - but her L3 spells are tapped out, so she was going to ask Thorin - decides that waiting might be better. Once we lower the ward, Inda might notice and since she's isolated in the bow she won't know what's going on and might be on high ale rt. Leaving her that way while we long-rested would be bad! And it means the safe stays protected while we rest.

Icasa asks when we're going to Daveras... We have to sleep. He'll keep watch! That's very kind; he'll keep watch.

We take a long rest.

(End of act 2, part 6)
