# RIPA: Act 2 Part 9
## Session 54 (2025-01-14)
### Eberron (!); Outlands relative day 9 (afternoon there)

After the unexpected meeting with Alustriel and Tasha at our magically-relocated bastion - now stationed about 3 miles out from Trade Gate - we have been given a way onto Eberron. At our request, we were sent to the Mournland, a war-shattered region where both the land and the weave of magic are broken. We believed that the third rod segment was in that area. Close by, though, was a mysterious black portal, which got the better of our curiosity. We ventured through and found the room of a vampiric, but evidently officially sanctioned researcher from the University Of Khorvaire, who was trying to find out more about the Mournland and the cause of its Cataclysm. Their "guard bat" was very helpful!

Recent research notes indicate that the researcher used the portal on a field trip into the Mournland from which, apparently, they have not returned - absent, now, for some 300 days. We are still in their room, deciding what to do next.

Thorin tries to placate the bat further and get more information. He succeeds (Animal Handling 21) and is shown, at least, the collection of papers from which the one sheet we already have one. Arturo tries skimming through them; the written language is **Breland**.

* It seems that still nobody knows what the Catalysm happened and that's what the research is for
* The area of study is considered quite dangerous and researchers can become quite paranoid as a result
* A worry - atenuous peace prevails but if the question were answered, war might resume

Prevailing theories:

* Overuse of magic
* Some blame it on the Warforged; that House Cannith lost control of them and they did the whole "humans are the problem" technology-gone-rogue thing
* Resurgence of the **Daelkyr** - ancient foes of the planet - previous empires had also fallen into decline following conflict with the Daelkyr, who are believed to live in the "underworld"

...and more. It's a complex paper, with a lot of possibilities. This researcher saw no choice but to get "boots on the ground" and forensically study evidence, to try and piece back a chain of events together (a relatively common/popular line of study).

Thorin is looking for a destination, but Arturo keeps mentioning that there seemed to be a centre point for the explosion based on our earlier observations in the Mournlands. That would seem a sensible place to start. More reading of the documentation however indicates possibly several focal points from the Kingdom of Cyre, so we just happened to be near *one* of many.

Interestingly, while there are frequently implications of a rather high mortality rate, there's no indication of the cause.

We decide we should just try and get out there again, and head for that hill. At least it seems to be the centre of *something*. Thorin can use his cloud flight trick to get us the 50-60 miles quickly, and keep us above the fog layer.

We say thanks to the bat and head back through the mirror portal, but just before we go, the bat wishes us "good luck in finding the Master - hopefully she comes back soon!"

### Back in the Mournlands

Thorin, Francesc - based on passive perception "spidey sense", roll Perception; (nat 20->)29, 23 respectively. Both notice, as soon as we step through that we're surrounded. **There are shapes in the mist**, some 50ft away from the portal. Thorin can tell they're bipedal and humanoid, but look shiny. Francesc shouts a warning and draws her bow, preparing to fire.

Arturo tries to prepare a spell, but finds that magic is *particularly* wild here! D20->no surge this time (1, 2 or 3 would now trigger that, not 1 only). He successfully summons a Fire spirit dragon, in red form. Penny casts Zone Of Truth over a couple of them and shouts, "What do you want?" (CHA 18). She knows that both of those creatures must respond truthfully. Intimidation requested, roll is rather low; 15.

Thorin misty steps directly towards two of them. In response, they immediately respond by leaping to attack! They hit twice; 9 slashing damage from each. These are metallic constructs without mouths, slightly glowing eyes, no hair but wear sort of almost-pointless armour clothing on top of what seems to be a naturally armoured body. Francesc reacts by releasing her arrow; 24 to hit, 14 points damage, as Thorin swings, 24 to hit; 7 damage.

The response to Penny's question is for one to immediately leave the Zone of Truth. The other seems undecided. There is *some* kind of speech between them, with the undecided one apparently being unsure of what it should do. Strangely, it just repeats what Penny said in more or less the same voice, almost as if a recording.

There's rapid movement in the fog. One seems to duck out of view, but is rolling in the direction of Thorin. Another leaps towards Thorin directly. He certainly seems to have their attention!

Initiative:

* Penny 8
* Francesc 11
* Arturo 24
* Thorin (out of aura) 10

Arturo swaps with Francesc.

* Francesc 24
* Arturo 11
* Thorin (out of aura) 10
* Penny 8

(Thorin wonders why they wear the sort of strange straps and studs of armour; it was like hitting steel plate, so it can really only be described as - decorative.)

Francesc casts Hunters Mark on the one that recently leapt towards Thorin. She learns that it's immune to poison and exhaustion. She fires twice; one hits, for 17 damage and 3 from another nearby (via ability). The second arrow goes wide. That same creature now changes tactic from Thorin. It examines Francesc for a brief moment, then points its hand three bolts of energy fly out of its fingers. 18, 19, 20 to hit; one finds its mark, for 10 damage; then it keeps running towards Thorin.

The two already on Thorin attack at, well, pretty much exactly the same time. It's almost choreographed, as if they communicate instructions instantly and silently. Despite advantage from pack tactics, though, both miss their first attack. The second do both hit, though and, what's more, there is third attack from each coming as well, of which one finds its mark. 40 slashing damage. He's too far away for Penny to help. As the attacks finish up, the third creature (that just finished attacking Francesc) shouts, "**Warn Glaive - the intruders mean violence**". And at this, the two creatures nearby *disengage* and run.

Arturo Perception nat 20 + 1 -> 21. One of the two who flee has vanished into the mist, but another is just visible, about 90ft away. He tries Psychic Lance, with some innate magic to try and make it more likely so succeed. It fails the save (badly), taking 29 damage and becoming incapacitated. The dragon is commanded to give chase for the other running creature and try to lift it off the ground. It's able to reach via full in-flight dash, but doesn't have time to make the grab yet.

Thorin still has the third aggressor to deal with, so tries to conjure animals - to give it more targets and give him some help in his own attacks. L4 - a pack of apes! 4d10->21 potential damage. The metal creature dodges the worst, but takes 10. Finally, Thorin shifts form into that of a giant frog!

Penny knows something isn't right. Insight 17. Well, these things were waiting; they must've assumed something was going on themselves and they refer to us as "the intruders" and she figures they probably saw us when we first arrived. *Before* we went into the portal. One is still in Penny's zone of truth, the other that moved out still visible too. There's also a difference in the one that has Hunter's Mark     and now apes. Perhaps it is... More advanced somehow.

She tries, to the one in the Zone still - "You were waiting for us, and I think we frightened you. What have we done wrong?" - it's a risk that might come to nothing, but worth taking.

The creature immediately turns towards the one covered in apes! Then it looks to her. It says, "I do not speak for us." Then the one swarmed by apes speaks! It says, "You've intruded upon our new nation. You have not been invited here. You plunder and pillage that which belongs to the **Lord of Blades**." At this Penny, shouts to Thorin, "**Disengage and stand down**".

(Thorin, insight 11. No chance! It's threatening him.)

The one in the Zone acts. It looks around, assessing. Then - probably because of the Zone! - it says, "They are trying to stop us from warning Glaive. I will not fail you, Lieutenant!" - and it runs off, in yet another direction. The other Penny had cast into the Zone but moved, says, "You would stand down? You would show weakness moments into a battle? You are not worth of life!" - and it leaps at her, dashing over the ~50ft distance rapidly and trying three hits. The second lands, for 16 damage.

Francesc looks at the one that just started to run after speaking to Penny. It's about 90-odd feet away. She fires... Nat 20 - dealing 20 damage and slowing it down a little. Her next arrow is aimed at the lieutenant - **nat 20 again**! - 40 damage (and 3 to the one attacking Penny via special feat). Perception 9. Nothing to see here.

The now-known-to-be-a-lieutenant moves out of the way of the apes. Thorin gets an opportunity attack, Starry Wisp - Disadv. (3,1) (!) + 10 -> a dead miss, sadly; the apes have a go, too, avoiding the worst of 25 potential damage to take 12. It calls out, "On me!" and at this, the one that had disappeared suddenly pounces forward from behind the mirror portal, lunging at Francesc; the lieutenant also joins in; and the one on Penny is close enough to join in too. **Five** attacks incoming! At least Francesc is able to dodge some of the later ones. Two of three hits initially; 10 slashing, then 23 slashing. Penny reacts to reduce that by d10+4->9. The attack from the one by Penny is a **nat 20**, 15 more damage. She uses a Luck point to try and get disadvantage on a next attack and that misses.

The incapacitated one is still incapacitated. The other one, by the dragon, disengages and dashes. And the one that jumped out of the shadows is able to attack more. The first attack misses despite advantage. Another luck point to negate advantage. That attack misses; the last would hit bit Arturo tries to Bend Luck and d4 -> 3 it *just* misses; then it dash-disengages and runs away, but seems to be sticking to its tactics of rolling away to hide, rather than fleeing to (presumably) warn "Glaive" like three others did.

Arturo considers chain lightning but can only (perception nat 1) clearly see two of the creatures that are in range. So, instead, he tries to redo psychic lance, still at the elevated save level (INT 20), subtle sorcery; the spell once again works. 31 damage. Sparks fly all over and the creature crumples to one knee, juddering and then incapacitated again - but not down. Arturo starts to estimate the hardiness of these strange constructs based on two solid hits from himself, and one early from Francesc. It's not an encouraging result.

Despite the construct's dash, Arturo's dragon is fast enough to fly up and try a grapple. Amounts to an unarmed magical strike; 18 to hit, which works; strength (nat 20) -> 24 - the dragon has grappled the construct. It then tries a bite on the now-grappled creature (adv.) **nat 20**, damage max too, 21. What's more, there's a breath weapon it can bring to bear and it doesn't hold back! 2d6->9 fire damage.

Thorin commands his apes to close in on the constructs attacking Francesc and Penny. The constructs take damage. The lieutenant DEX-saves, the other does not (21->10). He drops out of Wildshape and then casts Polymorph (losing his conjured animals) on *Francesc* to turn her into a giant ape! That gives her a *lot* of temp HP. Penny is pushed back (DEX save 20) without damage. The lieutenant dodges too, but the other one fails yet another save and takes 11 damage.

Penny attacks the lieutenant with the sun sword. Hits, 12 damage; hits again; 15 more damage (and Sap causes it disadvantage on its next attack).

The slowed-by-Francesc creature continues running, albeit a bit more slowly; then it looks around and sees Thorin giving chase, raises its hand; Thorin, Investigation - 9! - the creature seems to do _something_, but nothing visible flies from its hand and Thorin feels no impact or pain. Huh?!

The construct that's trapped under the now-giant-ape-Francesc tries to wriggle free but can't. Francesc-ape attacks the lieutenant; one hit, and one that's missed via a shield reaction. Damage is 3d10+6->19. The lieutenant assesses the situation; it rolls away from everyone, disengaging as it does so, looks at the field - seeing Thorin giving chase, Penny with the sword, the giant ape and the sorcerer; then changes weapon (via its arms changing), launching 3 javelins at Arturo (who puts up a magical shield immediately in reaction). Two of the three javelins find their mark. 17 damage both times. On the second  hit, Penny reacts to reduce the damage by 12. He holds his spell concentration.

The lieutenant now starts to run! Yet another direction, but it kind of feels like it's a deliberate attempt to draw attention; almost strafing, rather than heading directly outwards.

The stunned/incapacitated construct can't do much; the dragon tries to hold its grapple, but the construct breaks free. Once again, it runs. It gets 60ft away. Arturo realises that, for whatever reason, these "scouts" might not have even being going at full pace. If it can clear 60ft as well as break a grapple, it could probably do 90ft in a full speed run.

The hidden scout jumps out again, this time attacking Arturo. His magical shield is at least still up. Of the three attacks from the scout. His reaction was used for the shield so he can't drop that amount. Two hits, 27 damage; Penny's reaction was already used too, so she can't reduce it. As before, holds his concentration. It runs off again, then, but this time is at least still visible.

Arturo was knocked prone so gets back up; he sees the incapacitated construct badly damaged but not down, so tries one last time with another psychic lance and once again it fails its save. 26 damage. Arturo, Arcana check; 19. He sees the creature incapacitated and feels as if, with just a slight twist of the magic, it could be taken down... So he does. Now he tries something odd! He shouts - as commandingly as he can - "**HALT!**"

Then, he gets his dragon to fly in and grapple gain. It hits, but it's not strong; 5 total; it doesn't work. Tries again. Another hit, 8 grapple; and surprisingly that works! That leaves the breath weapon, which does 3 more damage.

Thorin turns into a Quetz., and dashes, trying to catch the furthest construct as it runs. He's *fast* in this form. Perception 25. As he flies over where it was, he sees, *just*, a ring of blades embedded, just poking up out of the ground. **A trap!** And a bad one at that.

Penny looks around. The lieutenant is 25ft away. Kind of opposite is the other scout, almost orbiting the party. She goes for the lieutenant. The first hit misses; the second hits, with a Blinding Smite; only 4d8+5->17 damage, really quite low, but it's blinded.

The construct being attacked by Thorin-Quetz disengages and this time runs its full 90ft. The construct underneath Francesc-ape finally gets free and now runs, but again, it takes up the circle formation around the group. Francesc-ape tries to hit the lieutenant. The first hit misses but the next hits, 18 damage.

The lieutenant rolls free, away from the ape, shifting to keep circling the approximate centre of our ever-moving group. It fires three javelins at each member of the group except the now-distant Thorin-Quetz. The ape takes 15 damage, but somehow gets knocked prone. Nat 1 against Arturo, miss. Scrapes a matches-AC hit for Penny, for 9 damage (and prone).

The dragon-vs-construct tussle continues - bit this time the dragon has a strong grip (19) and holds on (vs 12). Meanwhile, three more javelins are fired by another construct, all at the only person left standing - Arturo - two of which hit, despite him throwing up another shield. The first does 11 damage, the next 7. Penny reacts for the first and negates all damage (11-12 -> round up to zero), but the second takes. Concentration is held, but suddenly, two earlier spells wild surge!

**Arturo teleports unexpectedly backwards toward the portal - and turns into a potted plant**

Fortunately, the plant effect lasts only a second or two! He appears instantly back as himself, by the portal. He tries another psychic lance against the now-rather-more-distant lieutenant. It makes the save, even with disadvantage; it takes 25->12 damage; Arturo sees something in its chest glow *very* brightly, almost alarmingly so, but then the construct slumps. **The glowing hot, metal thing in the middle starts to burn and melt**. The Quetz and spirit dragon suddenly find that the other running constructs stop running.

We regroup, confused. We can't quite figure out why they've stopped. They look at first blank; then confused; then a couple of them appear to die or at least "shut down". The one that kept rolling away rolls into a ball and stays that way. Only one continues to move - the one that initially escaped the Zone of Truth. It is confused; regards all of us; it says, "Are you taking me prisoner or are you going to destroy me?"

Penny says "Taking you prisoner."

"Why are you taking me prisoner? I am no value. You will get nothing for me."

"You have information. Tell us about this new nation. When was it established?"

"Before I answer... What are you going to do with the others?"

Arturo says, "We want to formally request entry to your nation. We need to register that with Glaive. Where is Glaive?"

"Glaive does not handle diplomacy. He is a Destroyer. He is in charge of our new Scout Platform for the formation of a new Capital."

Penny chips in to try and help Arturo persuade the construct; ADV persuasion 30! (Needed to beat 24).

The construct appears to comply. It says its *name* is **Spike**. The Capital is a very long distance away and we would not be allowed to approach any emissary of the Lord Of Blades with "your lives intact". It adds, "There is no peace to be had here." It explains that the Lord of Blades is one of the only Colossi that did not fall.

Arturo is trying to figure out where dangerous actors are by asking some of these questions. The "heart of the nation" is some 20 days away. We'd never get past the perimeter. We contemplate use of the Helm but can't figure out a reliable way to get there and besides, it sounds like certain death!

* This is just one unit out of Glaive's platoon
* He has been tasked with securing this area and figuring out how to rid Lladro and the surrounding parts of all intruders who have encamped in the area
* **Lladro cannot be reached in person due to a very strange effect around him (though he is not alive) - people who try to approach can get thrown great distances**
* Lladro teleported *into a mountain* during the Cataclysm; they are fused
* The Lord of Blades really wants to secure Lladro and recover "the technology" therein

Arturo asks why peace is not possible; "Nobody can be trusted. None of the five nations can be trusted." "We are not from there." "But you are of the same people. You look like them and act like them. Creatures of flesh cannot be trusted."

Despite this rhetoric, Arturo learns that this isn't a universal view of Warforged - just those that follow the Lord of Blades. Even other Warforged in this area might not hold that viewpoint and, if so, they're either convinced to think in the same terms, or destroyed! We may well be able to get help from them if we're to try and reach the mountain-encased Lladro, within which we are fairly sure is embedded the third rod segment.

As we have found so often before, our big question is - what next?!

(End of act 2, part 9)
