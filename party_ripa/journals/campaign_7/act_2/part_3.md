# RIPA: Act 2, Part 3
## Session 49 (2024-10-01)
### Trade Gate, Sigil day 3; "Pig & Whistle" Tavern, early afternoon

We have negotiated with Captain Tomoko of Spelljamming hull The Scarlet Arrow, to take us to the Astral Sea in search of the wrecked Lambent Zenith. We believe now that this is a rescue mission, as well as an attempt to recover the second rod segment. Finding the wreck would be all but impossible in that strange realm-between-realms, except for a huge lucky break - we have a necklace given to us by Cyrix, a partner of Kycera of the Lambent Zenith crew. We hope that once in in the Astral Sea we should be able to use the Helm to teleport to that location, on the basis that the necklace's "home location" is with its creator, gather whatever information we need to be able to help The Scarlet Arrow navigate to that position, then teleport back and get the rescue underway. There may have been almost six months elapsed since the necklace was given, though, and after six months the Helm would not be able to make use of the object, so time is of the essence.

It looks like we have what we need, but tall tails of goings on could still be very useful - is there any more news of Vecna's attacks on other planes, for example? We choose The Pig & Whistle... and walk straight into a bar brawl!

Initiative rolls from last session:

* Penny, 18+4 -> 22
* Arturo, 22
* Thorin, 10+2+0 (thrown 20ft, out of aura!) -> 12
* Francesc, 10

...but Arturo is able to 'gift' his initiative, so he swaps with Francesc.

* Francesc, 22
* Penny, 18+4 -> 22
* Thorin, 10+2+0 (thrown 20ft, out of aura!) -> 12
* Arturo, 10

Francesc sees a long bar to her right, and two tables on that side with people stood up throwing things. Directly in front is a small walkway towards a few tables in the back. The walkway has been cleared by the sliding body of Thorin! People on bar stools have jumped out of the way. On the left are six other tales; people are again stood up, either dodging or trying to get involved.

* A dwarf with armour is fist-fighting
* In the middle on the left is a large ogre who has picked up a patron at the bar and is going to throw them!
* Jumped up on the bar are two Hadozi
* Towards the back of the bar there's a flash of steel as four short swords are simultaneously drawn by an insectoid creature, one in each of its four arms, stood on two legs!
* Something off to the left, peripheral vision... Francesc turns her head to look; it's an Orc, kind of fading back into the shadows, holding what looks like a red dragon's tooth turned into a weapon.

Francesc doesn't want to kill people, so she puts Hunter's Mark on that strange orc; no resistances or immunities, despite the formidable weapon and shady, rogue-ish behaviour. Then she turns to the nearest person and throws punches - a Hadozi is closest! She doesn't realise it's the same person who threw Thorin. Unaccustomed to this kind of combat though, both punches miss.

Penny, perception 7. There's a lot happening. Francesc is trying to punch a monkey. Penny does see the insectoid creature - looks very dangerous - so she runs up, drawing and lighting the Sun Sword, aiming it and calling out, "I'd think twice if I were you!" - Intimidation with Heroic Inspiration is a 4,5 + 9 (sigh) only 14. In her mind; "Swing that weapon away from me, friend - it is not I who is a threat! We should both keep all of our eyes on *that one*" - the swords both parry Penny and point to a large, gleaming, silver sword that's swinging out from behind the ogre. It clips the side of the ogre, but swings out further - a Githyanki with a Great sword. That's fairly convincing; "Yes, fair enough!" she shouts back and turns to face the Githyanki too.

One of the dwarves starts to charge at the ogre. Penny & Thorin insight 15, Francesc 14, Arturo 8; we don't really know which is the worse threat at this point. It runs next to Thorin and swings its axe in a wide arc, in a defensive posture.

Francesc hears the orc chanting an incantation in Giant. We all feel a strange intrusion in our minds - but it doesn't seem to be from the ogre. Emerging from behind the bar, up from the cellar, *and* bursting in through windows, is a swarm of rats - but these are telepathic, cranium rats!

A dwarf down on the ground near the ogre gets kicked and flies some 15ft across the room. Another patron is slammed down onto the ground on their back, too.

The insectoid creature lets out a strange shriek; its mind is being invaded! It, too, is telepathic; it is susceptible to the rats' effect. The Hadozi on the bar is OK, grabs hold of a large glass flagon, pulls the cork out with its teeth, stuffs a torn-off strip of its shirt into it, lights it, and throws it into the middle of the room - where it explodes. We're just out of the range. The Githyanki immediately Misty Steps near to Thorin, behind the dwarf who was protecting him and swings down the Great Sword (ADV, due to prone). One of its two attacks hits, 13 slashing; 10 psychic - he only takes 5.

Thorin gets onto his feet and turns into a giant scorpion! The protector dwarf has his back turned and gets pushed over accidentally; but the Githyanki leaps out of the way. He conjures a space full of spectral cats to try and block some of the rats! They emerge out of nowhere, snarling.

Arturo tries to hide by the door; perception 18. He sees someone the rest of us missed - a shadowy figure, trying to hide behind others. It's a human holding a dagger, sneaking around; a rogue, or assassin perhaps! He tries Subtle Spell, aiming for Telekinesis to hold them in place. STR save 19 DC, a tall order; it fails! Arturo picks them up and starts pulling them towards us. Now everyone sees them! Someone shouts, "THERE HE IS!" - what's more, Arturo moves the thief (without realising) close enough to the spectral cats that they deal the thief 20 damage.

The prone dwarf gets up and tries to run to the now-floating creature. "He's got it! I saw him take it!" - they swing their arms trying to grab the person but can't reach. "He's the thief! He's the thief!"

Francesc, with Hunter's Mark on the orc, realises it has just teleported across the room. A darkness spreads from behind the bar... It's spreading out from the orc, but reaching up to the human thief. Penny and Thorin are enveloped and can't see.

The Hadozi Francesc was fighting can still see her and attacks back... Miss, hit. 7 piercing. Francesc, perception - 14. She notices that it has **stolen her dagger of venom!** This causes conflict. She was going to go for the orc, but now needs the dagger back. She decides the orc is more important. Despite the darkness, 27 is the low roll - definite hit; she's using Hail of Thorns, for good measure! It is surprised and (rolls a 5) even before it feels the full pain of the injury, its spell falls. Total damage is 21. We can all see that it's looking surprisingly beaten up. She uses a Hunter's Mark feature to push 1 damage onto the Githyanki too. Next up, she tries to slow down the Hadozi who took the dagger. Only a 16 attack roll but it's enough. 15 damage! She is trying to Slow it.

Penny uses Channel Divinity to try and frighten the three foes; and the ogre for good measure. All three *except* the Githyanki are scared. WIS save 14, her ability to cast spells seems impaired due to the rats, so she has nothing else she can use to help the insectoid ally next to her.

The other dwarves have started to figure out who is fighting who and one moves to help Francesc with her Hadozi. Meanwhile, Arturo's held thief fails its STR save so doesn't escape but is better ready for the cats this time and dodges the worst; 10 more damage.

The ogre turns and tries to back away from Penny. As it does, the cats hit, which ends its frightened condition. At least it takes 20 damage from them. Regaining its senses, and starts to cast... Penny can't Counterspell, as she's too badly influenced by the rats. A yellow cloud explodes outwards, heavily obscuring the area, making people choke and cough. We all need CON saves from whatever it casts. Penny 16, Thorin 32, Francesc 5, Arturo 26.

The insectoid pushes back against the effects of the rats. It has trouble seeing through the new cloud. It jumps forward, guessing the correct direction, and brings all four of its swords - with a nat 20 - into the ogre! 64 damage. The ogre falls. The rats immediately start to scurry away and the cloud stops thickening, but there's not much of a breeze inside to push that away. The Hadozi on the bar starts flapping its arms, and we see it's a bit like a flying squirrel - there are actually wings there. It does fan some of the cloud away. Meanwhile the Githyanki tries to hit Thorin but the cloud obscures its vision and it can't see enough to connect reliably. It avoids the cats adeptly (crit), but still takes 10 damage from them.

Thorin Moonlight Step to get close to the orc behind the bar (causing considerable damage, given his scorpion form's size). The stinger is dodged despite a surprise advantage (d20 ADV 4, 5 rolled) but then the claws go for an attack; one of the two gets a hold, dealing a max 10 damage. The orc is temporarily grappled, too.

Arturo pulls the thief downwards, towards Penny and the insectoid. This terrifies the thief, clearly very scared by the insectoid; there's clearly a lot of history here we don't know. The cats get in there, too, dealing 14 damage. "Let me go! Please! OK! OK! Not closer to her! I'll give it back!" - Arturo shouts, "Everyone, put down your weapons! We've apprehended the thief!" - Persuasion 26.

The thief holds out an arm. It's holding a small idol. "Who wants it?!" - but the fog is hiding Arturo's involvement. Nobody realises. Arturo assists... Penny grabs the idol.

A quiet falls, punctuated only by the sounds of retching from Francesc at the bar, then people suddenly all start to head quickly for the door. Francesc is incapacitated by the cloud and can't easily see what the Hadozi with her dagger is going, but with her bonus action she moves Hunter's Mark to it, to track it - Thorin has the orc grappled. While this is happening, the Githyanki moves out of Penny's blindsight range; it's escaping. At the door, Arturo, DEX save 10; he gets bowled over as the creature flees.

The cloud slowly flows away, leaving just a low mist and a disgusting yellow residue over walls and furniture.

Penny looks to the insectoid creature. "Yours, I gather?" she says, holding out the idol. It stops, bows (!) and holds two hands out - "Not mine, but I know the owner of it and it was being transported." "Where from or two, if you don't mind me asking?" The creature turns to look at the remaining Hadozi, who is on their way out... "Them. Their crew." We head out.

Outside, Francesc is "asking" for her dagger back. Persuasion is only 17 via Lucky. "Say sorry!" it says "Sorry!" she says. "Fine!" - it hands her the dagger. Meanwhile, one of the other dwarves helps Arturo to his feet.

Thorin wildshapes back to himself and releases the orc, who's retching still from the cloud. Looks pretty beaten up. They both head out - Thorin surrounded by spectral cats! Penny asks the insectoid, "is that one worth helping?", pointing to the orc. Penny applies 20hp. "It was that Githyanki" (coughing a lot). "Surely the rest of you felt it too? It was trying to get into our minds!" - that was apparently before the fight even began.

"What about that ogre?" asks Penny (it's still inside, but Throin Spared The Dying so it's stable) "It lost itself and started attacking everyone? And in the commotion, that guy stole this treasure from these two." (Penny heads over and adds some healing back from the pool). A dwarf comes over; "The lot of you are NOT allowed back into my bar!" - fortunately to *them*, not us. Penny goes back and pushes another 10hp into the ogre just to get it on its feet. It has no idea what happened! Penny tries to explain, and then it gets very distressed about its rats. It seems they were close - it finds some dead rats next to where the fire was burning. Four of them; it cries.

With Arturo's help, we try to intimidate the thief to tell us more. The githyanki has fled; these two seemed to be working together; what gives?! The thief *claims* it was "just a job". It's was just a job, he hasn't been paid, etc. etc; Francesc insight 21 & Penny 19 - this is true, albeit somewhat embellished. He'd distract people with a fight while the thief took the idol. Turns out, say the Hadozi, that it's one of the last examples of an idol of their homeworld's God of Chaos, Havoc. Religion checks - Penny & Thorin, religion 22/23 respectively; never heard of a god called Havoc. It is clearly old and made of what Thorin thinks is a rare stone, probably worth 10,000gp alone. It's not magical though - Penny brings up Detect Magic...

...but there's a Divination spell nearby. Above and beyond. She turns to look. There's a small eye. She points and says, "Arcane Eye. We're being watched. Trust me!" - she casts Dispel Magic, Arcana check 20; it vanishes. Arturo suggests that since we're being watched, we should try to go somewhere else safe. Insight 29, Thorin; we should also keep an eye on our belongings! They're light-fingered. They invite us to their ship as a safer place to be. Why not... Arturo warns them - "I'll smash that idol if anything of ours goes missing!"

We leave the thief for the bartenders to hand over to the authorities. Apparently, despite all appearances to the contrary given the big fight that just happened, there are some.

We're led up to the sky dock and a smaller ship, oddly shaped, like an insect. Wings are folded back. There's a wasp-like abdomen with the cockpit made like two big eyes. As we walk, Francesc continuously looks for the Githyanki; perception 21; she doesn't sense anything much for a while, but just before we go into the ship there's a feeling of being watched. She turns and looks; doesn't see anyone; but she's certain we have been followed. She warns us in a whisper. Thorin brings up a Familiar humming bird, instructing it to circle within a 100ft range to keep in constant telepathic contact.

She tries to fake going in, but actually hide outside; and while she does that, Penny casts See Invisibility and casts her eyes outside the ship. And there, with faux stealth, the Githyanki is stalking forward. Once again, she uses Dispel Magic and - it doesn't seem to notice, still creeping forward; everyone else sees it!

* While this goes on outside, Arturo is inside. A small metallic ship, soft blueish lighting. It belongs to the insectoid creature, who has been contracted to bring the two Hadozi out into the Astral Sea. They're using the idol to commune with whatever is left of the presence of Havoc - to find its resting place. It's very difficult to do, because it's very chaotic; the magic is very strong. They get glimpses occasionally but then lose it again.

Thorin casts Entangle, but the Githyanki breaks free. Most of the vines are behind it on the walkway, though, so it's hard to retreat. Rope handrails along the plank way turn into barbed vines and the planks themselves seem to transform into thick knotted branches too. Francesc fires and *just* matches the Githyanki's 18AC, for 15 more damage. It's not looking too badly injured so she puts on Hunter's Mark and fires again, with a more aggressive stance this time. 25 more damage this time! *That's* more like it. It's slowed too but looks furious! It starts yelling at us in a language we don't understand. Context and inflection imply a litany of curses.

* Inside, Arturo is distracted by the sounds outside once the Githyanki starts shouting. He pops his head out. Telekinesis is *just* still up since the bar and platform lift are close by, so he tries his luck; DC19 STR save; 18 rolled - it works. Now he floats it up but turns it upside down and shakes it. Coins fall out, but nothing else. Now it curses more - but is certainly not as dignified as before.

None of us understand its language.

Penny tries Scorching Ray. ADV due to restraint. (1,20) -> Crit; 10 damage; (3,5) miss; accidental next crit (20, 20 rolled!) - 22 damage. Now its tone changes. It's still taking, but not what it was saying before.

Thorin casts Tongues.

It is invoking the Queen and Mother of All Righteousness, imploring us to let it go in the name of all that is holy and right and true about the universe; i.e. the Mother of All Githyanki, Gith herself. Then it postures and threatens a bit, but once again calms.

"We'll let you down when yoj can explain WHY you try to stole this and WHY you were causing so much trouble!"

"I need the idol to locate someone I want. It is creche mate of mine. You will not know her, but we are bonded."

Penny, insight 22. She says, "Lambent Zenith?"

It pauses. It understood *that* name. "What do you know of it?" "It's the ship WE are looking for!" "Why? Wait! Why?!" "To rescue the missing people!"

It's awkward, because it's all related via Tongues and Thorin. The Hadozi come out, wondering why we're just holding and talking this (to them) terrible creature. Thorin tries to explain. In the process we learn that this creature only speaks its own language, so things won't get any easier.

We are reminded that the ship crashed on a dead god; and then Arturo puts 2 and 2 together. The Hadozi's idol - that God - it was Havoc. But *then* there's a strange thing; the Hadozi **do not worship that god** - so why were they going to try and find it?! Oh... They aren't sure?! Ah. Well. "The stone", says Thorin. The idol is made out of the same material. The Hadozi admit... "It's made out of the heart of a star - a pound of this stuff; we'd never have to work for the rest of our days!"

The Githyanki insists on coming but we'd *never* be able to convince our charter ship to take them along. No trust. Penny suggests asking the Githyanki if there is some kind of bond or word we can give that would have them trust us to do the job. The insectoid intervenes at this point - speaking in perfect Gith! - and then explains to us that they'd only ever trust another Githyanki, *or* be bested in 1:1 combat. This would require rest & recovery, then 1:1 *hand to hand* combat.

Thorin is having none of it. We might as well just try to lock this person up, but Penny and Francesc is up for the fight. The insectoid will keep the creature in the brig overnight (since we have him restrained), but once healed, will let him go - doesn't want the ship damaged! We can decide overnight. We are given his sword as it's an ancestral sword and would mean all Githyanki would hunt us to the ends of the earth (!) if we didn't return it.

Then there's a debate...

* Thorin and Arturo are keen to broker a deal to split profits on the hunt with the idol. The god may have been responsible for destroying the Lambent Zenith. And it has a crew who might not be happy to see them. They agree; as a sign of good faith for "our protection" and guidance, they hand us the idol; we will return it tomorrow and depart with The Scarlet Arrow together. Francesc and Penny disagree but go with it...

* ...because Francesc and Penny want to sort out the Githyanki issue their way, with a fight. Thorin and Arturo don't want to - just kill him, lock him up, whatever. That's our compromise. In the morning, we'll fight. They'll wait in the brig; and the Hadozi broker a deal with the Sky Dock workers that the fight will be in the aviary, doubtless with many people watching!

We return to the hostel holding an extremely valuable double-edged ancestral sword, and a very valuable idol. We hide the idol in the bag of holding, but we openly carry the sword - and people keep distance. Whatever the reason for us carrying such a weapon, people recognise its heritage and want to be nowhere near us!

Back in the hostel, we set up Alarm. As we sleep, Francesc and Thorin have their amulets on, but Arturo and Penny still don't. Watch is held. Perception:

* Arturo: 13; uneventful
* Thorin: 28 - on high alert! - but again, uneventful
* Francesc: Lucky, nat 1 -> 9, 20 -> 28
* Penny: Is left asleep by Francesc

Unprotected by her amulet, some sort of arcane channel is opened to Penny. She sleeps, but enters some kind of waking dream. Non-corporeal but aware of her surroundings. Tunnels around her; light flickering in the distance; moving quickly through them. Always one corner behind - something, or someone - that she follows. She turns one last corner, then emerges into a massive cavern, geometrically shaped like a diamond - 150ft high, 200ft wide, or so. Rising from the lower half are lots of stone steps that converge on a platform in the middle, which has a four-tiered, Aztec-style ziggurat. Lots of people around. What seem to be portals glow faintly along the walls of the cavern too. Feels like a temple. She feels like she can float anywhere she wants in the space, mentally speaking.

Nobody seems to notice she is here. So, she moves around a corner to get a look into one of the closest portals. Some sand seems to have blown out. Beyond, there's a desert - huge dunes with a massive, scorching sun in the sky. It appears to emanate a strange dark light, as well as bright; a shaded, strange, oppressive feel. Ruins of cities are scattered around. People are walking there, though, carrying palanquins in groups, with someone or something important in them. They look like they live rough, but look very strong. The places shown by the portal shift sometimes; there are groups, in similar clothing, but each group has a variation. Cultists? But not all the same cult? Chanting starts; then there's a sense of someone next to her.

Arturo's consciousness awakens in that same place. We can't see each other, but there's a sense of who it is. We can't communicate but know we're each there.

Penny thinks she's seen as much as she can really understand in the portal and flies up to the middle of the ziggurat. Those sorts of places are usually important! Chanting is louder here. Standing in the middle of a strange sphere, brass arms swinging above like an astrolabe with constellations and other contraptions clicking away, **is the familiar figure of Vecna**. He doesn't seem to notice us! This is the presence Penny was following, though. Vecna seems very preoccupied. Groups of cultists around seem to be trying to get his attention, but he's focused and ignoring them. His gaze shifts to a portal. The brass arms lock into place one by one until they're kind of lined up, forming at their ends a series of concentric circles that point to the portal. Vecna puts his hands onto handles of the sphere around him and energy starts coursing through. A piercing blue ray strikes the portal, which suddenly expands. A huge number of the gathered cultists run through the portal.

It doesn't look like they're doing battle; more like - advance agents maybe.

Arturo this time heads towards the portal to get a better look. Penny follows. She's confused; there is  a link, somehow, to this place - yet Vecna is unaware of us. We're both able to mentally trace how it feels; **it links back to the time in Annam's Cradle - that strange "boon" he granted for some reason - it seems to have left an unanticipated connection!**

We see cities that make any other city look like backwater hamlets. Tens of glittering towers hundreds of feet high with glass balconies and arching walkways are visible nearby. Ships fly in the air, forming sorts of organised highways. We have no idea where this is or what it means, but the portal has opened into an upper floor of one of the buildings - that's where the cultists seem to reach when they run through. Looks like a prepared place. Again, this scene "shifts" in the portal, almost as if "searching" for something - Vecna must be controlling this - it zooms out through the city and over an ocean; into ancient forests; some crags; then over a strange wall of mist and fog rising hundreds of feet into the air. The "eye" seems unable to penetrate; it searches along, but the "wall" seems to stretch for miles. It gives up, apparently, then looks to other cities, but none are the scale of the first.

Vecna, behind, sighs - or something like that; lets go and turns his head; the portal closes. *A cultist who is half-way through is sliced in half!* Nobody seems to bat an eyelid. The body part is dragged away and thrown down to the space below.



### Trade Gate, Sigil day 4

Thorin wakes up and sees Francesc on watch alone. Arturo and Penny are asleep. It's getting up time, so we are shaken awake. We do so normally and are fully rested, but...

* Arturo: "I was doing some reconnaissance work in my dreams!"
* Penny: "So it was real! You *were* there!"

Arturo tries to be evasive when the other two ask what we're talking about, as he worries we are being watched. Eventually he gives in and explains as best he can. Francesc thinks back; history - only 10. Doesn't think it's any of the planes she has read about. Certainly not our world, Oerth, or a few others like Ravnica... She can at least rule out a few. Mental note to describe to the ship's captain later!

We start to head out. There's a lot of activity - much excitement - it seems news of the combat has spread. Penny's heart sinks! There are banners flying from the Dockmaster's office. Small crowds of people are heading up. The insectoid - Penny has learned the species is **Thri-Keen**, is waiting outside. "Shall we do this? Let's go and get your opponent!"

Thorin and Francesc are on the lookout for betting establishments! Penny gets more bad news; unarmed combat - without shield. At least armour is allowed.

The Githyanki is pacing around inside the brig, speaking to himself, saying war prayers...

Possibly unwisely, Francesc tries Hunter's Mark. It's verbal and the space is small, but her Deception of 15 exceeds its Perception of 9. It's not resistant, immune or generally vulnerable to anything. She keeps it up, just in case it tries to be sneaky - or if someone who's places a bet tries to cast a spell to help it.

The aviary is packed! Odds are in favour of the Githyanki, 30:1. (Penny sighs) Artier Arcana 15  warding runes inscribed around the fight area, which negates magic. Magic cannot be cast across the barrier. We're told that Detect Magic is also being used to make sure that nobody outside interferes... Francesc drops Hunter's Mark.

Hands are wrapped for protection. We see Tomoko in the crowd - "I can explain later" shouts Penny - "You'd better not cost me month's pay for my crew!" she calls back.

* One (1 minute), short break, if both are up, another round. Nobody's ever lasted for a third round!
* Bets are placed. Francesc and Arturo bet 25 on Penny. Thorin bets 50 against.
* We step into the ring with a referee. The Githyanki bows, Penny bows back.
* He says, "May the will of Gith be wrought today. You should pray to your god."

Initiative: Penny 15, Githyanki 15. We both punch and dodge simultaneously! Again: Penny 20, Githyanki 15.

* Penny hits; Blinding Smite added; 16 damage total. CON 18 save by the opponent, fails; blinded. She hits again for 4 more.
* Githyanki DISADV crit miss; then 18, matching non-shield AC to hit. 4 damage. CON save; stays blinded.
* Penny ADV 22 to hit, L3 divine smite, 29 total damage; goes again; and dirty 20 to hit for 4 more.
* Githyanki DISADV miss; then crit miss; nat 1! Still blinded. It starts speaking but Penny can't understand.
* Penny hits again, L2 smite, 24 damage; people in the crowd are looking distressed (!); some yell, "She must be cheating!" - and hits again, 4 more damage. It drops and rolls. The referee comes up and says something in Gith; it shouts back angrily and jumps to its feet.
* Githyanki DISADV miss; and miss again. It's having a bad day. And it stays blinded.
* Penny hits once more, L2 smite. 15 damage. It falls back onto the ground, its eyes rolling back; it yells out something, the word "Gith" in there; lands, catches itself, coughs up blood; tries to get up, collapses; tries again; and the ref starts counting - 1... 2... 3...
* ...it can't get back up.

There's huge applause. Penny rushes forward, avoiding the ref taking her arm and throws 30hp into the Githyanki, somewhat horrified by what she's had to do. It gets up, blinking as its vision returns. It clutches its own holy symbol and casts something. Turns out - Tongues. Now it speaks, curiously in Elvish for some reason - she understands it - "A noble defeat. And nobler yet to see the character and values of your opponent. Gith would welcome you into her fold in an instant! You can walk amongst us with no shame. You are better than your kind. I will abide by your demands. I will not interfere in your mission for surely it is a holy one. But I will provide assistance however I can, should you need it."

Penny says back, "We spoke the truth. We go there to rescue the crew. We will do everything we can to rescue your mate if they live."

There is much celebration - for some, anyway. The dwarves say they've named a special drink after her (!) - since we first fought the Githyanki in their bar. "Come to the Pig & Whistle for The Paladin's Fire! Special price today!" they announce.

We bring Tomoko up to speed on flying tandem with the other ship. No problem. What's more, we no longer have to pay; Tomoko's bet has won her a huge amount of money! It's above the maximum amount our voyage might ever have cost us, on the 30 day cap. Thorin mutters away running numbers, thinking she must've made something in the 5-figure range if she'd really bet a month of her costs for the small crew we're taking.

Well, we're up on the Sky Dock and both ships are nearby - looks like it's time to depart.

(End of act 2, part 3)
