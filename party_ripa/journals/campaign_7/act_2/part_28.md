# RIPA: Act 2 Part 28
## Session 74 (2025-10-07)
### Campaign day 31 on Krynn, in Urth's magical hut

We wake up inside Urth's magically constructed hut. Flurth has been keeping watch while Francesc mediates. Penny wakes up, yawning.

"Where the hell are we?!"

"This is my hut!"

Penny and Urth picks up from their evening chat. He's from the free city of Kalaman, but had been off-world. When he got back, it was strange. Dragons fighting. His home city had a strange authoritarian feel. As if a core of powerbrokers took advantage of the "present dangerous situation" to increase their power. Penny enquires more about the latter - Krynn has historically been home to ravenous, destructive dragons which, unchecked, used to cause much carnage. That threat had been dormant for a long time but, now, it seems to have resurfaced.

(HIS 27) Urth definitely ran into people who seemed to be performing "divine miracles" - but he's travelled many planes and met many clerics, but never met one who had any divine power until he *left* Krynn, since gods left Krynn long before he was born. Perhaps the good have returned.

Penny asks that if she steps outside the hut, will it cease to exist? No, only him. She steps outside and tries Sacred Flame on a rock - she'd used magic yesterday but wants to double-check. Yep - it seems to work normally; nothing strange like Athas. But then, after Athas, she's not sure what her source of power is after all.

Talk turns to the rod that Urth knows we're seeking - Penny doesn't go into details of Vecna though! Urth says he's down to do anything that is adventurous and doesn't seem downright evil... So he's happy to help. And he knows quite a lot about who might have it - even where they are. Their power base was once used by the Mages of High Sorcery. Towers for Red, White and Black; equilibrium at place called **Three Moons Vault**. He knows that part of one of the White Towers has been destroyed, though, which means things are no unbalanced. The chief mage in charge of the Red Tower seems to have consolidated power and ended up in charge of everything.

The safest route is long - down the big Wingaard river then punting up a tributary. Slow.  There are mountains we could go over - some threats there - and another option involves a swamp. Kinda grim but least-worst.

"We might die. But if it's any consolation, we have it on good authority that we're helping to save the multiverse."

Thorin has woken up and is listening. "What about Cloud Flight?" - of course! A near-perfect solution. We explain that we can't talk, so we'd better make a plan first. But Urth reveals he has Telepathic Bond! We can cloud fly *and* be in contact.

It's settled. We skip breakfast - we only have rations, not even any potatoes! - Penny grabs a stone from the camp so that we have it as a Helm focus in case of emergency, spells are cast and off we go. **It's extremely fast**. We are quickly within sight of red dragons circling a mountain range. Flurth, perception 21, notices that there's a section of the swamp we might have traversed which have felled trees to create some kind of highway. A marching army, covered in rusty, broken armour, shambles along. They look like old Knights Of Samilar to him, but given the state of their armour, it's likely they're undead. They're headed the way we're going, towards the stronghold of Three Moons Vault.

Once we get close, we can make out something Urth is surprised to see; a red glow encompasses the vault, in a column spreading skyward, "as if the Red Moon's glow has been harnessed" he 'says' to us.

Once very close, we slow. Thorin-cloud edges close. The red glow extends about 100ft away from around the edges of the closest towers, encircling all three. Perception 15, ARC 18; doesn't recognise the magic, but there seems to be some overall area effect here. Urth approaches. Adv ARC 26, it's his school of magic; harnessing the moon's glow can either inhibit or force shapeshifting. Francesc perception 28 - she interrupts the telepathic chatter and asks - "What are those mirrors?"

The white tower's side and base is badly damaged but the top is intact. And indeed, on top of each of the three is a complex arrangement of lenses and mirrors. We've no idea what that's for.

One tower, on examination, looks like it has bad foundations; the ground around it has settled and shifted. It's close to a river that's cut down close by. We float around to get a better look. Various rock caves provide a place we could "rematerialise", about 1000ft from the tower base. We figure this is a good place to try. Urth (SUR 23) has a good idea of places to dart between to keep under some amount of cover.

Penny has been keeping an eye on the mirrors and also a raised, flatter area in the middle of the three towers. She doesn't notice much about the mirrors but notices plenty of distinctive claw marks - dragons - not a battle; the tower people must be working with them in some way. Thorin's worried that we might end up fighting on all sides - mages, dragons and undead!

Urth casts Disguise Self on himself and has Flurth do the same. He looks like a "standard red mage". Penny thinks it's odd that he did it; insight 19; but then he explains that they're "part of the order" and it would "help them have an alibi in case they get spotted".

We try to be stealthily, following Urth's previously-noted path. Flurth is at the back. Francesc wants to be second; Penny third; Thorin fourth. Francesc PER 27, listening carefully - puts her hand on Urth's shoulder, puts her finger to her lips; the meaning is clear - "halt". The rest of us listen. Very faintly, we hear maybe 3 or 4 pairs of boots marching. They're going right-to-left in front of us. **They have patrols**. Urth takes a peek and recognises the uniform - HIS nat 20 - he's sure that it's a specific Knights Of Samilar order; **Order of the Black Rose**. That's very strange; the Order is a bogey man story told to kids about what happens if they go back on their word. You get cursed the way they were cursed. There was a Lord Soth at the centre of everything. It's a tale of hubris, jealousy, whispered rumours.

The rest of us see the patrol, but we have no idea that their armour is such bad news! Urth is very unsettled by the sighting. Thorin notices. "Are you - is there something we should know about?!"

"You ever see something that reminds you of the biggest decision you ever made in your life, but, like, makes you feel it was a really big mistake?..." (Thorin is gesturing to the rest of his party members at that as Urth continues) "...and even if it wasn't a mistake, it makes you think for a second? I'm all good. But thanks for checking."

Once we're about 100ft away, Francesc tries shooting a normal arrow through the field. Nothing happens. Penny decides to go for it, and shuffles out ahead, to go retrieve the arrow. As Thorin is casting Pass Without A Trace, Penny is running out of the range and she clanks off towards the red barrier.

The group stealth is very high, but Penny (DIS SLTH) only 11. As she runs through the red glow, nothing happens. She grabs the arrow and tries to flatten herself on the ground.

Francesc, well attuned to the sound of the footsteps now, has heard them disappear around the nearest tower and there's a good chance nobody heard. But if it's a patrol, they'll be back and back soon. She warns that everyone should go. They run past Penny and drop in next to the base of the tower where the foundations have sunk somewhat. ATHL - Urth, Flurth 18, all good; Thorin 15; Francesc 19. Penny, realising that they've all run past, rushes to get after them - ATHL 13.

Once the dust settles we realise that this was once a subterranean part beyond the tower base. There's a door here, in what was once a buried corridor.

"Shall we go in?" asks Urth - no checking for traps, just barges against the door! Nat 1 -> 15 - it doesn't move. Penny moves in to help, but Urth calls - "Flurth!" - who moves over to help and (ATHL 30!) it starts to move open, albeit under protest.

Penny - `-_-`.

It'd be dark in here except it's bathed in the same red glow as outside. So this isn't a "light shining on the towers" - it suffuses everywhere.

There's a pentagram (!) at the end of a short corridor. Thorin calls his Familiar, a crow. "You're putting a crow in *this* building?!" asks Urth. Thorin, D8->1 - as the crow flies into the room, it kind of warps in a strange way then lands... As a lizard! It's still a connected Familiar, though and it heads through the doorway. 15ft tall stone columns either side then start to take on a liquid appearance, then reforming into some kind of golems that look like defenders. Urth has never seen these before. Thorin, ARC 23; they don't resemble any material he's encountered before.

Urth just strides on in!

As he heads forward, a stone sphere floating above the pentagram at the end of the antichamber melts and turns into a tall, elven figure holding two scimitars. Under it, runes form. Francesc sees that it's Elvish. **"It is not surrender; live to fight again another day"**. Then the breast plate of the armour forms- Black Rose order - and the scimitars acquire a magical glow. As soon as she sees scimitars, Penny starts to run forward at full tilt, and jumps in front of Urth. But nothing happens! The apparition solidifies into a statue.

Urth checks the scimitars. Penny checks the breastplate. "What *is* this?!" - and Urth explains; a bad thing to take. A much maligned group. Tempting though it is for potential value at Trade Gate, we decide to leave it all. As we walk past, the statue morphs back, turning into a small box. Thorin without hesitation lifts the lid! Inside is a single potion. Urth ARC 16, thinks it's a good thing (!), Thorin 24; removes exhaustion, prevents poisoning, helps maximise healing. A Potion of Vitality. Thorin takes *that* straight away! It feels like we maybe just passed some kind of test.

We turn a corridor and send the lizard ahead down a long, dark corridor lit only by the dim red light. Urth heads straight down it - "For fuck's sake, slow down!" whispers Penny, running after. The corridor turns left, to an apparent dead end; on that wall, though, is a circle of runes. Urth recognises the script - it's a dead language, **Astarion**, that he learned in Bard School (a brief discussion occurs - *Bard School?!* - Yes, it's a thing, and now it's about to help us!) - Urth says, "if we retrace the words, it will show us the way".

With his finger, Urth tries to trace the runes. The wall vanishes. From the edges, bits of mist solidify back into wall; over 20 seconds or so it's reformed. So we trace again, and walk through. More corridor.

More Astarion runes, apparently just decorative this time. We push on. Urth, insight, nat 20. A strange feeling - a growing unease. The source of it is hard to spot. It's almost as if, in his waking hours, he gets a strange sense of deja vu reminding him of a terrible recurring nightmare, not remembered while awake but creeping in from the sides of his consciousness nonetheless. He wonders if this is related to breaking his Red Oath. He carries an impossibly heavy burden of his worst secret and it's about to be revealed!

Penny, insight 19; Urth isn't as chatty as normal. "Do the runes say something bad?"

"No, just... Boilerplate platitudes! I'm just uneasy. I usually don't get nervous with these things."

He sees dried blood. Penny uses Channel Divinity - undead, fiends; desecration, from a pool of some kind that's down the end of the corridor. An orb, spinning, floats above it. And she feels the presence of four undead on our level (and a few above). They're moving our ways. She pushes Urth behind her; "Undead coming from round that corridor!" - she draws the Sun Sword and lights it.

Initiative:

* Thorin - 25
* Penny - 24
* Francesc - 11
* Urth, Flurth - 9

Thorin sees three wraiths float into view around the corner (though Penny knows where the fourth is). One holds not just a weapon, but some kind of bone horn. Thorin casts Fountain of Moonlight, L4 - but as he casts, he realises the spell is _refusing_ to manifest itself somehow! The *existing* powerful Red Moon light effect here stops anything else moonlight-related from working. He switches to Faerie Fire on all four wraiths. But only one succumbs.

Penny religion 32 (!) - they drain life, by nature. She gets in close and tries Word Of Radiance, but the 3d6 damage roll is only 5. CON 19, all take 5 damage. Well *that* is something - but not much. One moves through a wall and swipes at Francesc but misses; another moves and Penny gets an opportunity hit for 11 damage. It too tries to attack Francesc and misses also. **We notice a theme**. A third moves in as well and misses, too!

**Wraith D moves its horn to its lips and blows an alarm call!**

Francesc aims at Wraith C, which has taken damage, and fires point-blank. Hunter's Mark on C too. Resistent to all kinds of damage; immune to necrotic and poisoning and immune to most conditions! She gets two hits, but the damage is not as effective as normal due to the resistances.

Urth tries Dissonant Whispers on Wraith C, WIS 19 save failed, 14 psychic damage taken and the wraith flees. Quick as a flash he draws a dagger to attack Wraith A, hitting for 5->2 damage. Flurth does the same thing, but aims at Wraith D; WIS 18 save this time, failed again, 17 psychic damage and it, too, flees. Flurth then attacks with the Lute! (Of Thunderous Thumping), hitting a nearby wraith - 9 damage total (including Thunder damage).

Thorin decides to risk Moonlight Step. He usually feels himself moving into moonlight and reappearing in a restricted range, but hear, he feels himself moving into the *red* moonlight and is sure he can reappear *anywhere* that the red light illuminates. He gets over to the first of the fleeing wraiths and *now*, in the wider hall by the strange pool and sphere, summons a Draconic Spirit, gem type, resistant to Radiant. The Spirit starts attacking the wraith; hit, hit - 13->6, 12->6 damage. It uses its breath weapon too; 10 radiant damage. The wraith is almost down.

Penny moves up to swing at A and B; 23 damage to A, 16 to B.

Wraith A tries to attack Francesc again and, this time, hits; 25 necrotic, max HP reduced by 25 too, but Penny reacts with Sooth Pain to reduce that to 12. Wraith B also tries, hitting again for 21 damage. Her max HP drops even further.

Penny calls to Urth, "Do you have any of those Disguise spells to spare?"

"Sure!"

"Good to know!"

Wraith C attacks Thorin and misses. D reappears and, this time, goes for Urth. It hits, dealing 22 damage and max HP down by that amount too.

Francesc turns invisible, disengages and flees.

Urth Misty Steps away and appears near Wraith B. He throws a Firebolt, hitting for 17 -> 8 fire damage and fires a crossbow, too; 24 to hit, hits for 4->2 damage. Flurth runs back a bit too and throws a fireball gem from the necklace, L3 equivalent. 25 potential damage. One makes a save, too, 25->12->6 and the other does not; 12 damage taken. Flurth then sends Bardic Inspiration to Frances.

Thorin uses Primal Savagery and crits! 38->19 damage on Wraith C - and it dissipates, then runs across to Urth and uses a Moonlight Step to move Urth out of the way... because his Draconic Spirit is going to use its breath weapon in the narrow corridor where three wraiths still are (along with Pnny and Flurth). The Spirit is able to avoid them though and hits all three wraiths; two make the save but one fails. It also gets a couple of hits in. It's enough to dispatch Wraith B.

Penny gets a hit on A for 13; it's looking rough - so she repeats that with a Divine Smite for good measure and takes it down. D, with the horn is still up, but had been previously frightened. It can't see many other party members so attacks her and misses badly. It starts to run; in an opportunity attack she does 18 damage. It blinks out and disappears up a corridor heading North. Penny's detection is still  up and she shouts a warning to the group.

Hunter's Mark is still up too, so Francesc knows where it is - she runs into the corridor and fires, 33 to hit, hits - 11 damage taken. The wraith falls.

Penny can 'feel' movement from all around via her Divine Sense. There's a lot of signalling, coalescing below our level, grouping up; North East and South, ish, as if something is crawling out from the ground. There's a strong sense of something above. Francesc is fairly injured, too; but she goes and checks out the orb above the pool. It's silver. WIS save! 18... Good roll, but not enough! But she has Bardic - d10->5 - 23 total. *That* does it.

It's a scrying pool. When she gets close, water in the pool draws up and envelops the orb, which spins more and more quickly. It looks as if it is "washing" the orb and it's becoming a scrying ball - but she realises from her WIS save that **it is looking at her**. She runs back and grabs Urth and Thorin, pulling them down to the ground, hoping they'll be out of line-of-sight. But Urth, looking at the ball, WIS save against fear - dirty 20, just enough. On the surface of the orb, cleared to crystal now, is "the bogeyman" - **the face of Lord Soth himself appears**.

An annoyed, booming tone speaks out in an old version of Common.

"**Teremini, why are you disturbing me? I told you not to contact me until the ritual is complete and the Rod Piece is in place! The Master grows impatient. We must herald his coming. Teremini. TEREMINI!**"

We keep *very* quiet! The only thing that Lord Soth can see at this point is a rather confused Draconic Spirit...! He yells in frustration and lets go of the scrying spell.

So - we figure - that's that...?
