# RIPA: Act 2 Part 13
## Session 59 (2025-03-11)
### Inside Llandro, Outlands relative day 10 (very late)

We're being pursued by Warforged inside Llandro; we've reached the Bridge.

We need to figure out how it works. Thorin and Penny have the same idea - put on the helmet the skeletal gnome is wearing! Thorin beats Penny to it - without any ceremony he swipes the bones away (!), sits and dons the helmet. Nothing happens. Francesc starts looking at where various wires coming out of it go while Thorin feels for some kind of lever or switch. This time, Francesc beats Thorin to it - investigation is a solid 30! She sees a glyph that looks a bit worn, as if pressed often. She presses it.

"Quicksilver" flows down some of the pipes visibly and the helmet activates... INT save Thorin, is a dead flat 1! With aura and mods, that's 12 - failed tho not a total disaster, but he's very disorientated. He has "too many eyes"! Whatever he's seeing though, he thinks it is "the present". The rest of us can see he's in difficulty but we don't know exactly what's up, so we can't really help. Thorin's druidic experience as other forms gives him some help; he has presence of mind to recognise this is a magical thing. Arcana, 17. Better... It's a question of directing one's thoughts. There are a few options, including attempting to move the colossus, but given its current state that would probably be catastrophic! He goes for a look through memory, instead.

* A large assembly ground; equipment all around
* A glow of arcane energy
* A hive of activity both inside and out
* Llandro starts to float - he can see he's outside any city, in some kind of fortified area; over the countryside beyond he can see an intended destination
* There's a very rapid phasing, a movement towards the destination, but then there's a horrible feeling of interdimensional portals opening *inside*
* He can hear screaming; people within know that things are wrong
* Then there's a very sudden stop, a feeling of two immovable things colliding, an explosion of energy; he sees all around him a shockwave of magic propagating outwards
* As that happens everything inside "goes dark" - a sense that the people inside have been killed by the raw energy of the explosion originating from within

Thorin considers security checks. Are defences active? What about self-destruct? That has two states - armed and countdown. He notes that "grey matter engine" is active but compromised/damaged. Many other things are broken/destroyed, including many of the joints. Several weapons systems seem OK though. One is *disconnected*, recently.

Now he tries to contact the grey matter engine. He gets a sense of curiosity and eagerness to meet *in person*. There is a definite sense of *emotions*.

There is a map to get up there, but the path is blocked. But the quicksilver fluid is communicating that there's another way - go into the caverns that come off the side. This floor and the floor above have ended up connected by the caverns of the mountain and whatever that thick 'wall of force' was down below doesn't seem to be present.

He's about to disconnect when he has the presence of mind to realise that those memories were re-playable - recordings - he can review and try to study for details. What about the possibility of Vecna, or other source of those problems? Perception: 26.

* Many mages encircle Llandro along with a complex runic circle
* Thorin sees that one "suspicious" mage - the hooded one with a glint in its eye - there's a correlation
* But in this vision, Llandro zooms away before the person moves away

Arturo asks Thorin to focus on the last few moments, the explosion itself. The two work together to try and correlate other information from these unfamiliar, complex systems.

* **The magic explosion was not an internal failure**
* It's very likely that wild uncontrolled magical power emanations from the area Llandro was moving towards were *already active* and these hit Llandro, causing a cascade and explosion
* The failed teleportation played a part too; Llandro was meant to go way past this point, into the heart of Cyre, its capital; instead, he dematerialised here
* **There's a tiny bit of unplayed memory...**

Weapons were not active during teleportation. He was they to convey the message! **Thorin plays it**.

* A proposal. Exchange of information. A trade in progeny; exchanging the next generation of children - that is to say, political marriages - to propose some kind of peace treaty.

That gives weight to Vecna interfering. Maintain chaos. Maybe he knew about the rod segment, even then?

* We can't see any way to transfer this message in a way that would allow someone else to read it.
* We just don't understand this technology/magic.

At least we take a note of the wording. Thorin is the only person in the group with *first hand* knowledge.

Time to leave. We know the way now. Before we go, Penny puts the scull of the gnome carefully back onto the chair, while Thorin decides to break some of the connections to the cap to try and thwart any ill intent in the future; then the idea to just cut it free cleanly is floated. We could take the whole thing.

As we get to the natural caverns we see claw marks. This was dug, probably, by some large creature. Let's hope we don't meet it. Thorin reaches out with tremorsense - ADV perception - 26. Faint scraping, from the edge of range, diagonally up. We will proceed with caution, using PWAT to help - but as we move forward, the movement stops entirely. Stealth checks are low, but for the +10 on PWAT - lowest is 15 - but highest is a **Nat 20 for Francesc - 20 + 13 + 10 - 43!** Arturo also does well. The two of them turn angrily and wave hands at Thorin and Penny to tell them to keep quiet!

Francesc has moved ahead to find the quietest path and tells us just where to step.

Soon we're within 60ft of a large creature that doesn't seem to have noticed us. Thorin is able to detect it first, then see it with Darkvision. It's a Blazebear - bear-like, ish, but with too many eyes and bat-like extra small heads growing out of it; the teeth seem to be pushed forward, out of its mouth.  It's about 12ft high and blocks the view beyond. The cavern opens up just a head, high, with a bit of a land bridge up there. Arturo decides to use one of his Clairvoyance instances, positioning it just our side of a wider area our-side of the bear with tunnels leading left and right. What's more - perception 19 - he spots warforged blade scouts hiding on the land bridge!

Arturo notes a faint quicksilver path running down the corridor basically straight ahead - past the bear. So, he decides to use a magical distraction - he mimics staged whispering in the southward tunnel, the larger of the north-south options, hoping to lure the bear away. It's risk as he has to move forwards for range; stealth 24; It works! The bear grunts and snarls, moving towards the sound; the scouts on the bridge don't react.

Thorin misty-steps under the bridge. Penny and Francesc are now some way behind and rather pinned down. Arturo moves his sound to further around the corridor, hoping to lure the bridge to a point where it can see the warforged on the land bridge...

...but then takes 18 piercing damage as one of the blade scout realises that the magical sounds are coming from somewhere else, perception is 25, beats Arturo's stealth. At least he holds onto Clairvoyance. Initiative!

* Penny 21
* Francesc 9
* Arturo 8
* Thorin 7

Oh dear. Penny ATHL 19, manages to run up and jump (at limit of movement) right up onto the bridge. Sun sword on, then swings at A and B; CRIT on one but damage is only 21, hit the other for 18 too. Sap on both - next attacks are disadv. She notices a third warforged - looks like a lieutenant - behind them. Then the first, Scout A, turns to another and *speaks in Common*, "Rack! This one goes down!" - are these actually not part of the other factions? Penny looks closer. Do they look messed up / varied, or more like military? More like - war paint - ceremonial armour. So she shouts, "Wait, are you a different group from the Warforged outside?" - but the other one continues, with simply, "This is who we were instructed to eliminate".

It is essentially able to use pack tactics, so as it comes for Penny, she figures it'll be rough. The first is levelled by the Sap and misses; ADV from there; the next deflects off the shield (19 vs AC 20); the third hits. 12 slashing. To make matters worse, the Blazebear now roars up behind. She doesn't know that it has a Stunning Gaze - she has her back turned - Scout B sees it though and is momentarily distracted. The Blazebear sees that and attacks it with reach. It hits, 22 piercing and 19 force! It's flung backwards and lies prone. Penny shouts, "I think this is a good time for me to jump and we run for it! Attack the warforged!"

Of course the Warforged speak Common; the lieutenant hears that. He calls out, "Yield no ground! They gave us instructions to _destroy_ these intruders! You know how she feels about failure." Scout A reacts, attacking and hitting, 14 more damage to Penny. Now the lieutenant runs forward and throws a javelin - at Arturo, who is the only one he can see past his own troops! No less than three javelins fly forward. Two miss, but the third hits; 14 damage and knocked prone. The clairvoyance spell drops and on top of that, there's a wild magic surge, delayed from the moment of casting somehow... "You and up to 3 creatures you choose within 30ft of you have the invisibility condition for 1 minute!"

So at the moment Arturo is struck and falls - we all vanish!

Francesc runs for it - 90ft, gets her all the way into the tunnel just beyond where we first saw the Blazebear. Arturo stands and runs after her (not that he knows where she's gone) - Thorin makes his way over too and Penny wastes no time jumping down and running. Surprisingly, quite by chance, we all end up close together despite our different speeds, because of our different starting positions.

And that's it. Penny can see people via Blindsight and Thorin still has Tremorsense up. Behind us, sounds of carnage!

Arturo plays it all off as if it were totally to plan.

We follow the quicksilver trail. This leads us outside! We are about to exit when Penny shouts at the group to stop; last time we were outside, we were flying around in random gravitational directions. But we see some kind of metal walkway embedded in the rock, metal railings broken, a short missing section; presumably part of Llandro. It's a few feet below the exit. Francesc can "climb" and tests it. No strange gravity and it bears her weight.

We realise this is on the outside of a shoulder. Francesc reaches a window for a large crossbow-like affair and we can squeeze in that way.

Arturo, HIS only 10 + Guidance, only 11. A word above the door at the "Southern" end looks familiar. Francesc is able to help when he expresses his frustration - ADV roll => 19. The word is "vault". Thorin and Arturo immediately head that way; Penny shakes her head!

In the next room to her left, Penny sees there's a large stone table in the middle, which seems to have all kinds of maps and books on it, and models. This distracts her and she wanders off to look closer. A war room map. Amazing-looking, very detailed... Cyre before it was destroyed.

Meanwhile, Thorin is at the vault door. He looks for traps - perception nat 20, 29 total. There are no traps as such but there's a curious mechanism that stops the door opening. He is able to undo it (with mage hand!) and the door now swings open under its own weight and a very slight incline on its hinge.

A vault. There are stacks of metal discs with emblems on them, two or three inches in diameter. There are stacks of metal plates with emblems on them too. Finally, there's a 4ft long, 3ft high chest in the middle of the room with a large grinning devil face and wings growing out of the side of its head as the clasp. It's very ornate!

Francesc looks for traps - pressure plates and so-on; Thorin too; again, no traps apparent. The room hasn't been looted or plundered, yet... Arturo is trying to find any other strange traps or similar on the chest, too. Perception 19 - it looks out of place. It just doesn't match the aesthetic; he mentions this and Thorin casts Detect Magic. Nothing from the chest.

Looking closer at the squares and discs, Thorin becomes convinced it's a form of currency. He has no idea how it'd be used to pay for anything in Eberron currency, but he knows there's at least one plane where they exchange in theory _anything_ so it's worth collecting! D100->17, D100->21. **He gets 17 of the rectangles and 21 of the thinner unmarked discs.**

Arturo and Thorin convince Francesc to open the chest. She does mention that the lid looks very heavy... They start calling for Penny!

(Meanwhile Penny is trying to figure out the strategy. INT check, 17+4->21. It looks like there are *several* Llandro-like machines on the huge map it extents beyond Cyre. It shows where Llandro shoud have gone and shows where backup was, in case things went wrong. It seems some of these various colossi had been earmarked for teleport to many major cities - was this a blanket simultaneous attempt at peace, albeit at the threat of the might of a colossus? They definitely planned to escalate very quickly if that didn't work, with military poised to strike. She hears her name being called).

Penny walks into the room, takes one look at the chest and says, "Well that's a mimic!" - so she prods at it with the Sunsword, lightly, not on the clasp. A huge psuedopod tries to strike at her; 17 vs AC 20; it's deflected by the shield. The game is up! The chest morphs into a creature. Well - we have what we need; everyone runs!

As we proceed through the war room, Detect Magic tells Thorin at the table is magical. Transmutation. Transformation and animation - the map and things upon it are part of the illusion. He tries moving a horse...

...roll for initiative!

* Arturo 17
* Thorin 13
* Francesc 11
* Penny 7

Everything falls off the table, which stands up and becomes a large stone golem! Francesc calls out, "Be careful! Those maps are valuable!"

Arturo swaps with Penny, who goes first:

* Penny 17
* Thorin 13
* Francesc 11
* Arturo 7

She attacks. Hits, Blinding Smite works - blinded, 35 damage; sap; the next with flanking (well, and blindness) ADV only 17, miss, but Arturo bends luck - d4 -> 4! - hits, solid damage roll too, 18 more. It's not impressed and retaliates, but is blinded... There's a strange emanation, a "slow wave" expanding out. WIS save all round. We just make it except Arturo, who is Slowed. Three people are nearby - by change the first goes to Arturo, and hits, but only does so because he's Slowed! 15 + 9 bludgeoning + force. The next by chance goes for Thorin but misses.

Thorin responds; primal savagery, hits, 24 damage with acid-tipped claws. Via passive perception, he sees that this really just adds some scratches into the stone - little else. He throws a big healing spell at Arturo - 21 points.

Francesc uses Hunters Mark and learns of resistances that are - well, it's made of stone. Nothing unexpected! She notes that it's had very little damage, but attacks anyway with "all the toys". ADV due to blinding. Hits twice; 22, 15 damage. Now it's looking a bit more damaged. She retreats a little.

Arturo tries to throw a Subtle Spell at the golem - but it can't be affected by shapeshift spells; D20 wild magic -> fine. Due to Slow, he can't do much else - but (WIS save 23) breaks free of it.

Penny was considering Dispel Magic, but seeing it absorb a spell like that, wonders if the magic is more innate. Since it's looking more damaged she opts to attack instead. She hits twice for 29 (with Divine Smite) and 13 damage.

The golem, still blinded, swings wildly. The first attack again by chance heads for Arturo and, again, the second by chance goes to Thorin. The now-not-slowed Arturo dodges and Thorin avoids it easily too.

Thorin continues his savagery assault and hits twice, for 17 total damage. He also heals Penny for 17.

Francesc fires twice, aiming for the same spot repeatedly, hitting decisively for 26 and 19 damage. It's starting to crack and fall apart.

Arturo throws a close-range firebolt, hitting for 15 more - and that's it. The golem crumbles to dust.

OK, Francesc can collect any maps and we leave - not-at-all blaming Thorin (who pockets the horse!). Penny pushes 35 into Arturo and 20 into herself.

There's a strange shaft off to the side. The Quicksilver floats up there; Arturo confirms the "antigravity" effect is present. Investigating for a moment longer, we see the other "shoulder" across the room and the equivalent room has - via Comprehend Languages - the words, "Holding cells". Penny runs over; "The vampire scholar might be in there! Can anybody open the door?" Thorin gets inside.

There are two long empty cells nearby as part of a square chamber. Further on is a bigger junction room, circular. Penny runs forward. There is a small creature, almost childlike, but seems adult; similar looking to the sleeping lady in the artificer's room. That same moonglow skin, pale. Penny asks Francesc to get the door open. It's a risk, without more investigation, but we're being chased - time is short. Francesc can't quite get it. It turns out there's metal twisted around - Penny ATHL 25 - she undoes it, with a loud creak of metal which wakes up this individual. They look confused, then afraid. "We need to hide! I mean - thank you - I mean... What day is it?!"

RP ensues! TL;DR, this *is* the researcher. She's not confident at all but Penny gives her a quarterstaff - for confidence more than anything - and she is instructed to come with us, keep close and keep moving quickly!

We run for the upwards shaft. Arturo reminds us to be careful of the grey matter. Francesc leads, Penny in tow, looking after the Kalashtar. Arturo next, Thorin guards the rear.

Francesc, DEX save - an intense flash of light and beam of energy suddenly fires down the passageway. 29 - half damage (vs 6d10!). Penny isn't so lucky! But it's radiant damage, and she's resistant. Both take 25->12 damage. Looking ahead, Francesc (passive perception) sees that whatever fired is kind of faltering - it's a weapon, held over the edge by a red-coloured Warforged at the top of the 10ft wide, 30ft high shaft. But this Warforged looks very different from the others - perception 20 - written in cursive, across a headband tied across their forehead, **is the word Glave**.

Penny moves to the side, calling down a warning to the Kalashtar - who would have been terrified and run, but for Penny's aura tho she doesn't realise it - Francesc likewise; Glave _pushes_ the now-apparently-broken weapon down, but it misses Penny and Francesc and crashes down below (not falling - it was pushed, in this no-gravity passageway). Thorin looks in, sees what's going on and moonlight-steps up to get in Glave's face...

Initiative!

* Thorin 18
* Penny 16
* Francesc 14
* Arturo 9
