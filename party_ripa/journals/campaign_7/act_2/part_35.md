# RIPA: Act 2 Part 35
## Session 81 (2026-01-27)
### Campaign day 33

The party is split after a mishap. Urth, Flurth and Thorin made it across a difficult bridge crossing over some kind of void, but Francesc and Penny fell through. They ended up teleported, after a fashion, to another dungeon area where we found Marian - the person who wrote the notebook we found earlier; and Penny managed to find a ring of stars, which was an important artefact we were told about by Laysa. Meanwhile, the other group happened across something that looked like a **Marilith**, but was in fact a statue of one of the old gods. Reanimated, she told Urth, Flurth and Thorin her story and handed on a sword - another one of the artefacts that Laysa told us about it.

#### Urth, Flurth and Thorin

The two groups are separated, with perhaps only Marian having any idea how the part of the dungeon in which she, Penny and Francesc are located, might connect to the part where Urth, Flurth and Thorin are located. They are both resting, during which time Thorin casts another spell into his staff. Old gods, powers stolen by a lich... Acererak that time; probably won't be the last time they hear that kind of story with Vecna at the centre! Urth wonders why it seems that visitors to this place have increased in frequency, especially the last year, too. Is that important?

There's a library, too. Tempting. Very heavily guarded by things you can't see. "The more time you spend in the library, the more you will learn, **but the more time you will lose**". Flurth HIS 28. That rings familiar... A story, from a long time ago; referenced a tower where exactly those words were spoken. In *that* tower, some kind of time dilation spell was in effect. Time passed faster in the library.

There are also - well, the word is "closets" (!) - where time and space collapse. They know only of one person escaping from them; else someone goes in and dies, their souls seem to be siphoned out, to feed the phylactery of Acererak. **And feeding Acererak souls is the whole purpose of this tomb.**

Urth asks the Marilith about the other two party members, who fell at the bridge to this room.

* Find an exit, come back in and fall likewise
* Find a path through the hall of many doors

...since we might have appeared in the dimensional closets, the library, the other side of "the illusory forest" and so-on; the Marilith doesn't know. Without the rod segment, there's no way to track the destination; the other two have that; but there might be a way to ask about *that*. When the one person who escaped from the dimensional closet left, they came through a particular path - the only other exit we can see from this room, in fact, than the one used for entry. Thorin can see that way. Thorin also suspects that Penny and Francesc, if alive, will make their way onwards to try and find the rod.

Using rituals, Thorin and Urth establish a line of communication and Thorin re-casts Find Familiar, since his lizard was trapped outside a place too difficult to traverse prior. Then they venture onwards.

A hallway with 8 alcoves, small objects inside. At one end there are bronze carvings. Two faces. One elated, one despairing, but somewhat god-like/draconian. Thorin looks inside the closer. On the left, a lute; on the right a lyre. They start to glow with a purple light and start to play - but play very badly. Discordant, jarring. WIS saves all round - Urth nat 1, Flurth 7! They both take 15 psychic damage. Thorin 18, also takes 15 damage but he's resistant -> 7 taken. Then suddenly the playing stops and the enchantment with which the instruments seemed to be wrapped fades. Urth goes to touch the lute. It looks like the magic around it has faded; a trap was triggered, and it'll take a while to reset. Urth takes the lute!

Thorin PER 27, sees a script above the door in a language he doesn't understand. Urth/Flurth can read it - "**Pay the toll in blood or in song**", in Draconian. So Urth starts to play the song and tell the story for the Marilith, which they just heard! (Rolls high) -> Enchantment breaks all along the alcoves; it was tuning and playing the lute that seemed to do it and there's an audible click as the doorway unlocks. But Thorin now realises he can hear fighting from the room beyond! Spells firing, metal clanging against stone. He shouts to Urth / Flurth and runs to the door. He sends in the lizard first.

Inside - an impressive room! 15ft high, huge open space - a library. A large stone golem is being fought by someone in gleaming black full plate - a paladin. And there's a Red Wizard, too. Wait! It's - them! **The "rival" group from ages ago, on Toril, well before it fell - Velindra, Vallin, all of that.**

Thorin, PER 26. Willim holds a metal book, with metal pages and spiral binding. That's another one of the important artefacts! But he notices something else too - the battle is, well, relaxed! Spells "float slowly" through the air. Ah! Time dilation!

Well, Thorin makes the call; they're going in to fight for the book.



#### Francesc and Penny

The room we end up resting within has a curious-looking fountain. The water seems like it might have faint restorative healing properties. Francesc decides to try some! 6d6 -> 17; she heals for 17. Wow. Not bad. If placed a vial, though, it loses its magic. Marian gets in there, though, healing herself up a fair bit. The room has writings and a design that indicates it might have been some kind of religious sanctuary, a blessed room once up a time. Perhaps that spring - even if Penny doesn't really trust it - is legit!

Other than the way we came in, there's only one exit, so we start to explore. Following a corridor around a U-turn we reach a dark room with a triangular sort-of-altar in the centre of the room and, carved into each side of the centre, is a niche that's almost perfectly designed and each niche has a chest inside. Penny SUR 25; the room was designed for something else, with the altar placed as a trap. So something *inside* this altar, if we could figure it out and not trigger the trap, is probably important. Francesc investigation 21, nothing obvious, but the chests look like they're gold, silver and lead. Penny tries Detect Magic, wondering if there is anything interesting there; all three chests are magically trapped. Penny PER 15, looking for writing; a lot of inscriptions but she can't really make out what might be important or significant. All sorts of scriptures and writings.

Marian verifies that it's trapped, so we spend time reading things. Francesc can read Draconic; it seems we have to exchange things of a similar value, if we are to take anything from here.



#### Thorin and Urth/Flurth

He throws open the doors and shouts at the red wizard - after a strange feeling of magical transition, the strange time issue - "Throw us the book! We'll help!" - Initiative!

* Thorin - 10
* Flurth - 8
* Urth - 2

Willim looks incredulous and laughs; "Wait - you're the impostors! That's right; you survived! I don't know how, but the answer is **no**. This manual is mine!" He throws an Arcane Burst at the golem, dealing 26 damage. He looks a little injured; the paladin, Debra, is even more badly hurt. "Help us! Help destroy the stone golem before it destroys you!" - Thorin just says "Give us the book and we will!" - so instead she shouts, "Very well; I will leave you to die with it!"

Throin tries casting Confusion. Wilim makes his save but Debra does not and becomes disorientated. It's curious though, he notes that they're not throwing heavy magic at it. But Urth - ARC 27 - recognises that Wilim has an ability to cast levelled spells "for free". He must be a lich, and powerful at that. Urth wonders if *that* is why he's not throwing out big spells. He then transforms into a hulking crab! He moves to block the door, but in his new giant form, this gives the golem an attack of opportunity - and it crits. 20 bludeoning and 18 force. It's a lot of damage, CON 17, adds Bardic from Urth (d12) -> 28 total! He holds his Confusion spell.

The golem expands some kind of field that messes with people; saving throws all around; Urth is slowed. Flurth and Thorin are OK. The golem moves towards Urth; the lizard, which has run in to harass it, has to make a DEX save and (18) gets out of the way just in time.

Wall Of Fire ends up cast around the golem. The Slow effect doesn't get shaken though.



#### Francesc and Penny

If we have to exchange items of value... Well we need to know the value. So we have to open one. Penny asks people to step back and pulls out the lead chest, opening it. Inside is a spell scroll. Not so interesting. She puts it back and tries silver. Francesc - PER 19 - it's not silver, it's wooden and plated in silver! Inside is a twisting, strange, dragon-motif ceremonial dagger with electrum lines and amethysts set into the pommel. **That** is one of the items. Penny puts that back and checks the gold chest, for completion; ADV PER 17; same deal, wooden chest plated in gold; 10 pieces of some kind of currency with a hole in the middle that look like they're worth 10gp each.

So, the dagger. Penny HIS 15, the chest is maybe 50-100gp at most. Dagger? No more than 1000gp, surely?

Francesc has her Dagger of Venom... She thinks that's more. She goes for the swap. And it works! We put the chest back; nothing happens; leave the room; nothing happens; and after a short corridor, we get to a portal - no other option. We go through and - **a familiar room** - the 8 portal smoke-filled room.

After a debate with information provided on where people have gone before, we elect to go out via the East portal. Francesc goes first; but can't see at all. *Magical* darkness. Penny bumps into the back of her! Blindvision shows her a 10ft x 10ft room, a strange singularity, it's draining magic and light. We can't stay here! There's a body on the floor; it's tugging out our very being. Penny shows Francesc the door via literally pulling her hand to it; and the other hand to the body; Francesc drags the body - a dwarf - out, while Penny has to wait for Marian. As the door opens, Penny hears the sounds of combat! Initiative 8. (And Francesc, initiative 12).

Penny is being torn apart but CON save lucky 25, she's fine so far, but where is Marian?!



#### Everyone

In the library, Thorin-crab sees an elf dragging a dwarf info the room! "What clown car bullshit *is* this?!" shouts Wilim; "I want out of this room!" - he pushes past Debra and starts casting Misty Step; Flurth decides to Counter - CON 18 save - the cast fails. Enraged he orders Debra - who is unimpressed - to "get rid of these idiots!"; a confused Debra is barely able to act - swings at the nearest easy target... And that's Francesc. 18 to hit missed; she swings again; but it's even more wild. Really it's a comedy dodgy - Francesc is stumbling and almost falling over, trying to drag the dwarf into the room! So she shoves Francesc away instead - 10ft away and prone.

Penny is seeing this and wondering, **where** is Marian?!

Francesc stands back up, moves back a little but gets an opportunity attack by the stone golem; 13 bludgeoning, 6->3 force. She ends up next to the big crab against a far wall and puts Hunter's Mark on Debra. She's resistant to necrotic, piercing, radiant and fire, but she fires arrows, 27, hits; total damage, 22->11 piercing. Wilim cops 3 of the hunter's mark damage. Next hit is a crit! 25->12 piercing.

Thorin-Crab tries to claw Wilim. The first misses but the second hits, dealing 22 damage and grappling the mage. Wilim reacts with a Rebuke. DEX save for crab; uses Heroic Inspo; 16 total. The crab takes 30 fire damage! Holds concentration on the Confusion spell though. He notices the downed dwarf on the ground and casts L4 Healing Word as a bonus action - 23hp. The magic strangely kind of "sparks" as it hits him; but then is *sucked* into him and he glows, as if lit up from inside. He comes to.

"Join the fight, my Dwarven brother!" says Thorin - as a giant grab! - but in Dwarven, ADV PER 20. The new dwarf - **Gundtach** responds; "Brother from a crustacean mother, I will not forget this act of kindness. I presume this tattooed motherfucker in you claw is not a friend? Who else?!" "The golem and the black paladin!"

Initiative 9 (he's not technically an Ally of Penny; she's in the other room, shrouded in magical darkenss). He moves next. Sparks form around him, that look almost like raw spellfire; two each bolts to all three enemies. One of those is a crit on Debra, 2d10->4d10 - ends up at a whopping 39 damage (10,10,8,6 + 5) (but only half taken, because it's radiant), 30 damage to Wilim, and 38 to the golem. The golem's slowing spell drops at that point, as the golem's CON save is not enough to hold it.

*Finally* Marian steps through! Penny grabs her, jumps out the door *right* into the face of none other than Debra. She immediately tries to push her out of the way; hits with an unarmed attack and pushes her into the corner, prone, thus able to pull Marian fully out of the room. She throws in a blinding smite for good measure; the damage is only 3d8 -> 7 -> 3 radiant, but the blinding effect *does* work as Debra's CON19 save is only 10.

The stone golem walks through the fire wall - 5d8 -> 17 more damage; then it tries to slam into Flurth, since Flurth is holding the fire spell; hits for 15+8 damage total; CON save low - the spell fails. Then its second attack comes in - nat 20 - but the total damage is enough to take down Flurth, once again, all his equipment falling to the ground. Penny is now *really, really* annoyed.

Urth is similarly upset. He wants to cast Befuddlement, really just for the damage but ARC 18 - psychic damage - it's immune to that; it is a golem, without a mind. Instead he uses L7 Bigby's Hand, but it's attempt to attack misses (14 to hit). He *taunts* the golem now! WIS 18, which it fails on; now has DISADV on attack rolls for targets *other than* Urth.

Wilim tries to wriggle out of the grip of the crab; attempts Teleport; Urth once again attempts to Counterspell. CON19 - he's within 10ft of Debra and makes the save. He teleports a short range to the southern corridor and starts to run.

Debra drops her sword and tries to convince us all to stop fighting. PER 20. Penny ADV insight 24, she's serious about it; not lying; if she dies here, she won't be revived; if a lich dies here, the soul can't go to its phylactery...

Penny shouts to Francesc, "GET AFTER THAT MAGE!" - and Francesc agrees, running full tilt at 45 speed. And she reaches far enough down the corridor back towards the room where the Marilith is, and sees that he seems to be engaged in combat with him while Throin is trying to shout, "The things in there are our friends!" but she can't hear that due to the time dilation effect which she has now exited.

(End of act 2, part 35)
