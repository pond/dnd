# RIPA: Act 2 Part 24
## Session 70 (2025-07-22)
### Athas, city of Tyr, prison of fire (Outlands relative day 23)

We've made it inside the prison of fire and found out how to access rooms with prisoners in, but there's a problem - they are bound and held magically, yet we cannot use any dispelling magic ourselves as casting any spells activates all the fire traps - it would burn everyone.

Thorin has an idea; have a look at the fifth room, empty one. He calls down to us and heads there himself; we excuse ourselves from the room we're in, promising to come back and follow.

In the fifth room, Thorin perception 27 *does* see the pressure plate trap at the entrance and avoids it. A stone holds a central floor tile/plate depressed. So perhaps that's all it takes to "fool" the mechanism that the prisoners are held over. That's part of it, then. Francesc, investigation 22; runes all around the room, so it's a literal cage of fire. We know the ceiling turns into fire too, but we don't know what makes the *floor* do that. Thorin, arcana 24. He thinks that so long as *one* surface of this area isn't on fire, then *something* can be accessed. It's a big enough space that so long as only one of the circular wall, or the ceiling, or the floor is on fire, then we can stand in a safe place (but in the case of the walls, it's nasty; we'd have to keep dead centre, like the prisoners).

Thorin tries standing on the plate, and lifting the rock to see how heavy it is. He estimates some ~100lb or so. We'd need something very heavy to use as rock replacements in other cells. When under pressure, the plate is flush with the ground; we get the impression it would lift up above the level of the floor. This makes it hard to try and jam something into the side of the stone to stop it moving - a recessed, pushed-in slab would be easier to stick.

So, Thorin suggests that someone stays behind, grabs the rock and see what happens. He sees no solution. There are numerous bad outcomes. He gives Penny - because she is strong enough to carry the rock! - a potion of invulnerability. Just in case. Francesc tries to jam in a dagger, hammering it in, hoping that the plate can be stopped from moving. SOH check - with Thorin helping, with his mason's tools; 16+5->21.  Francesc and Thorin retreat, with Penny now having the fire shield.

Penny invents a series of new and innovative swear words, lifts the stone and steps one step forwards towards the exit. "Clunk!" - the bone dagger falls away. She starts to run out of the room, intending to return if the corridor bursts into flames too. Barely a second later, the floor starts to turn red hot and air above catches fire, but the plate where the stone was isn't on fire, at least. It extends along the corridor, but stops before the main room. So she turns back around and drops the stone back on, jumping onto the middle area. She swings the fire shield off her back and hunkers "down" trying to shelter at least on one side. The others notice that the other corridors and central area are *not* on fire. Penny takes 11->5 damage.

This feels like more than a minute. She sprints for it. "Skateboards" on the shield; ATHL 24; pushing off the walls, which aren't on fire, a bit. 7->3, 8->4 damage before she gets out. The shield is badly scratched, but basically still intact.

It takes a full minute for the fire to go out. Francesc comes up with an idea to substitute *herself* for a prisoner. We get them out and she wall-walks away.

OK, well, who first? Thorin re-iterates a desire to save everyone. Francesc calls it; first occupied cell, anti-clockwise. A young, late 30s early 40s human male. Francesc stands on the plate, awkwardly pushed up against the prisoner. Thorin tries towing the foot manacles and Penny tries towing the hands. The floating manacles aren't locked into place; they do start to move; but then they stop at the doorway. We have to drag the unfortunate prisoner back to Francesc! We'd looked for a release mechanism before but it seemed to be magical. Francesc, investigation 20, abjuration, a forbiddance thing. Could we just scratch the runes away? Penny, Aracana 11. We could cast Dispel Magic! ...Maybe not. Thorin 20, yes, scratching away would work. And changing the rune will change the nature of the magic. He tries it. The rune is changed; arcana 27, it seems to be meaningless now.

We try again. The manacles still float, but at least we can move the person out. They're mumbling. We have to tell him to keep quiet. "We're saving you but don't cast any spells or the fire will go! Be patient!" - Penny persuasion 19 - we're going to come back... We whisper-shout down the corridor, "It's clear" to Francesc. She uses a reaction to trigger the action to run, then run plus dash; effectively 3x movement; one round is spent in the fire, but she has the shield and can shield herself from the floor since she's on the wall. 3 fire damage total.

A moment later, the manacles fall to the ground. We make sure the prisoner is comfy and ask them to not move. Prisoner 2, 8 fire damage; we put prisoner 2 far enough away from 1 that they can't set each other free and cause havoc. Prisoner 3, 4 fire damage. The last person we go to rescue looks in better shape. Less malnourished. Attempts to speak. Same speech from us. Pointed ears, pale skin. "I'm guessing you're Zorhanna. Stay calm; we're joining the others..." - 9->4 fire damage for Francesc.

Now we have all four. The blindfold/hood doesn't want to come off; it doesn't have a rune; and anyway, how do we even get away?!

We never got that far. Thorin ropes up the still-blindfolded prisoners. We eventually settle on a variation of a prior plan. Rather than the reverse-gravity rod, we'll redo what Arturo once thought of and use the 2nd rod segment to cast Arcane Gate. It requires line of sight, but Francesc can jump up onto the walls, then look for a place to send the exit; look down the hole for the entrance; use the rod and we can all go through.

Penny hastily strips off the top plate and fetches the rod. Francesc will keep it in her bag of holding for as long as possible in between using it, since we're worried that it might be a "beacon" of magical power to anyone seeking such things while not in a demiplane.

Francesc leaps and climbs, peers over the edge and sees the exit past the courtyard. ADV stealth - easy. But now she's too far from the base of the hole! She can see Simera, still causing trouble... The spell's entrance range is limited. So she has to retreat! Thorin then thinks of a Familiar. It can be his eyes above the edge; he can cast close by for the entrance (safest to do that on the floor, in the non-fire zone), bonus-action to "see" via the familiar, then can cast the exit gate a long way away.

Done!

Thorin goes through first, roped up with the prisoners in tow and us behind, climbing carefully down and out - down into the gate, then a gravity shift to the horizontal exit beyond the compound. Francesc shouts up, hoping she'll hear - "Simera, jump down the hole!" - Simera just goes for it. The portal opening is on the floor. Francesc jumps in and pops out (ATHL 25) elegantly; Simera fires out of it almost like a canon (ATHL 18) and avoids the worst of it as she tumbles horizontally away, but it's certainly not an elegant landing.

Time to leave! Penny leads two of them, Thorin another, Francesc a fourth and Simera leads us to the closest escape route. Two of them are weak and compliant, and get allocated to Thorin and Francesc. The other two are more feisty; Penny persuasion 23, convinces them to keep going. Penny tries to cast Aid to help all except the better-condition Zorhanna. Francesc uses a Healing Spirit, too; that helps with all prisoners, and in her case she sends two of the five healing "batches" to Zorhanna.

We get below ground and start to head for the big tree. Simera runs off to warn the network that it's time to go! Penny tries Dispel Magic on Zorhanna; and that works, she's free. She's confused and thankful; "Alustriel?" she asks, thinking we were sent to rescue her once she realises we're not native Athans (it's quite obvious)... She doesn't know who the other prisoners are. Penny is already casting Dispel Magic on the human we first rescued! They're very suspicious, wild-eyed. "You were sent to rescue someone? Were you sent to rescue me too?!"

Penny thinks for a minute - "...well, as much as we were sent to rescue Zorhanna, yes." Persuasion 26 vs his 21.

Thorin lets slip that we've a shared goal, to defeat Karnak! Hmm, insight 20, he wasn't working *for* the king, anyway. We're not being told anything but they're not immediately aggressive.

Penny looks at the third one. Another Dispel Magic. An unusually small mouth, non-human - older too. They have large, opalescent eyes that they cover quickly, even though there's only dim light here. Their hands are nail-less and silvery, long fingers. They don't speak but make high-pitched strange whistle sounds instead. Penny says, "I don't speak your language and lack the magic to understand; I hope you can understand us; you're being rescued, stay calm!"

Thorin helps out with the last prisoner, so Penny doesn't have to blow her L4. This we realise is the first prisoner we saw and spoke to! Oops. Well, better late than never. They (he?) start to try and push away from everyone, eyes darting, frightened, crawling away almost to try and hide. Francesc goes to try and retrieve him. As she approaches they lash out. When she tries to offer food, he lashes out and casts it aside then tries to run. Francesc tries to grapple. 13. Misses. Thorin has to try Charm Person - and that works.

Once they're fake-friendly, Penny casts Create or Destroy Water in a goblet. She puts it as his feet, then backs away. "I've no idea what you've been through, but if you've any sanity left, this should be proof of our intentions".

He gulps it down and tries to speak but can't, too hoarse. Thorin hands over his water flask. Now the others have gathered, the prisoners sharing something of a bond and being concerned. Penny re-casts for a larger amount and the water is shared.

After a while the person starts to touch parts of Thorin's clothing; they trace shapes. Runes. Druidic runes, too. They're much older than they look, he realises; must've used their remnants of druidic magic to keep themselves alive. He repeats what he's said to the others about going to safe place in Druidic this time, and even writes it in the sand for good measure.

By drawing runes, the prisoner conveys that he has no idea how long it has been. Until he can see the sky he won't know. Whatever land he was looking after has been destroyed; he is all that is left.

Over time, more and more people gather at the tree. Simera has decided to make herself quartermaster, of sorts; checking everyone is here. "We may have gone too far!" says one. "They're even raiding houses now! Destroying parts of the city to find us!" - Simera thinks we have everyone that's still left. People assemble at the tree; **Thorin uses his L7 to cast Transport Via Plants**.

We're suddenly at the distant grove. It's not what we remember - busy. A heightened atmosphere, with lots of people and activity. The oldest prisoner is in wonder, only really now just starting to take in the strange reality of the situation. And suddenly, lots of people are approaching, full of questions. It seems they were waiting for us for leadership. The elves that Francesc "leads" are especially eager, flocking towards her, calling to each other to let others know.

Well, our plan was to lay low and wait for the city to burn a lot of resources looking for people who'd long gone!

Thorin is apologising to the druids of the grove for the unannounced arrival, but they're excited - "we cannot remember the last time we had this much help, that this was a possibility!"

Penny catches up with Zorhanna, confessing that we were *not* sent on a rescue mission. After dancing around "who knows what and what can we safely reveal" for around, our stories spill out, Francesc and Thorin joining in. She's astonished to learn that we have three of the four rod segments. We learn that Zorhanna was part of something called the "Circle of Eight" and by chance were scrying when Vecna attacked Toril. And of course, we were there, then, in Waterdeep, not that the Eight knew. Zorhanna asks if we were trying to meet Leirol Silverhand - yes, we were; "Well, you were destined to meet me!" says Zorhanna. Apparently, after Toril fell it was a "mad scramble to evacuate Sigil because the Lady of Pain was shutting it down to stop Vecna from accessing it".

She thinks Vecna is trying to seize control of the multiverse and rewrite reality. That's why Sigil is closed. But that, in turn, "fragments the multiverse" as that "city of doors" is the way that many travel between planes. She was sent to Athas, because it was suspected as the place where a rod segment could be found. Athas was "Vecna's test case" - he worked on Athas first, harvesting all the magic of the plane. But of course, nobody here knows about Vecna, but "the signs are everywhere", she says. Vecna has since perfected the approach.

It comes up that we have her bag and spell book! We hand it over and she hugs it. She'll rest; tomorrow, she'll help us any way she can.

Thorin meets with the druidic elder and gives him the staff piece. His demeanour changes immediately. "Where did you get this?" - Thorin explains. "I recognise this. It was my master's staff", says the elder. "It needs to find a home; it can be restored; but it will take more magic than we have access to". Basically - last Plant Growth on it for a full month and it'll regrow.

The elves decide to celebrate "their saviour"'s return, a celebration for all.

CON saves for revelry!

* Francesc 5 - blind drunk
* Penny 19 - remembers far, far too much about Francesc being worshipped
* Thorin (grudgingly) 15 (within Penny's aura!) - but does get a bit drunk

Eventually everyone falls asleep.



## Thorin's Athas druid grove (Outlands relative day 24-27 inclusive)

Training montage!

Penny rallies Veiled Alliance troops (ADV persuasion 22) while Francesc continues to help train the elves, mostly training them for recon and stealth (ADV stealth 22).

Thorin starts the process of rehabilitating the staff. The rescued druid starts to look better, too; it seems the magic of the grove is helping him.

Word gets out that something is happening here. A few tribes of the feral halflings arrive. Thorin takes charge of them! ADV religion 18. Well, they're not religious... It's more about fate with them. Plants, the natural order of things.

A couple of times, the druids use the big tree in the city to gauge the state of affairs there.

We learn over time that the temple is a bit of a maze. Traps, dead ends, guarded rooms; templars abound; all sorts of things to try and stop anyone reaching Karnak. He's deep inside, in his inner sanctum and has turned into a dragon, or is at least a long way along in the process of that.

Mynos is all questions. Where is Arturo?! They were close. We do our best to explain something we don't even know ourselves!

* Veiled Alliance and halflings on disruption to try and clear a path by drawing forces away
* The elves will be scouting around and checking for clear paths
* As the days go by Mynos gets more distraught. Arturo had the plan for what he'd do - wasn't he meant to "cancel out the king"

Thorin tries to chat to Mynos and teach him how to recognise the right from the wrong. It's an uphill struggle; he lacks the experience or the context. Thorin eventually has a good idea - offers that if he trusts us, Mynos could follow our lead. ADV persuasion with WIS basis, 4,6+5 -> only 11; Penny tries, 4+10->only 14; then Francesc tries! 19+0. That works. Perhaps the good-alignment of Thorin & Penny hampered them; neutral Francesc has a more balanced way of explaining things.

We intend to attack the palace at Athas "night" when the city is least active - that is, while the sun is up. To achieve this, three dusk-to-dawn cycles pass normally, but on the fourth "day", dusk to dawn extends as everyone attempts to shift their sleep from the usual Athas cycle to a more familiar-to-us "daytime". They stay up, through the sunlight; we are all underground below the grove in the caverns and tunnels. Eventually, it's the "last night" before we go. For almost everyone except our party, that seems strange since it's going to be dark soon; that would normally when they're awake!

Thorin produces a gem-encrusted bowl that he'd made (!) - he has a plan, a new spell; Heroes Feast. We all gain 13 temp HP.

* Us
* Simera
* Zorhanna
* The other two rescuees, now very much on board
* Old Druid
* Mynos
* Veiled Alliance commanders x 2
* A survival-of-the-fittest chosen Halfling champion

Around that feast, everyone else gathers. Many think they may not live through the following day. They go to battle. People share stories. Mynos is quiet and contemplative, grappling with a lot of new ideas. Zorhanna seems surprisingly at ease, effortlessly blending in and interacting with people from very different backgrounds. There's a strange mixture of hope and resignation to an assumed fate.

Many toasts. Too many toasts!

Penny heads to bed first. Thorin next. Francesc stays up, needing only a few hours of sleep. She notices Mynos standing in a raised area with an open space to the dark Athas-day, Toril-night sky. She wanders over.

"Anything wrong?"

"Do you think the is the last night for us?"

"No! We've managed so far..."

"If it *was* the last night, what are the things you wish you would have done?"

"I don't have many regrets. Even the things I look back on and wonder why I did them; without those I might never have come here."

"I sense you are content?"

"Pretty much. I get to shoot things in the face tomorrow! Things that deserve it."

"I'm trying to think if I've done everything in my life; if I have any regrets?"

"Just do whatever you can tomorrow. Don't believe in gods or any of that! Just act."

"You don't believe in gods? I'm not sure I do either. What could a god possibly do that I could not do myself?"

"That's the spirit!"

Mynos asks to meditate with Francesc, since she doesn't sleep. They sit back to back, watching as the twin moons set.



## Thorin's Athas druid grove (still Outlands relative day 27 - after sun-up)

The three of us cast off our Athas "disguises". We equip with our true armour and weaponry. The sight of all that metal raises spirits even further. Thorin wants to use his dragon shield so he gives the Sentinel Shield to Penny. We also make sure we get on our base layer of sunblock^Hanti-acid. Mynos gets the spare. Zorhanna uses Thorin's, because we realise that he is already fairly good against acid anyway thanks to his dragonscale armour.

The three druids together are all needed to transport everyone through the tree and into the city.

Veiled Alliance help coordinate. Elves head stealthily out (+10, Francesc ADV Stealth, 2,1 (!) -> 12 -> but plus 7 for natural dexterity, 19), guiding people towards places to hit and run without being detected. Ish.

Halflings meanwhile just charge! They're kind of a meat shield, helping us (with some of the Veiled Alliance) get through to the main palace on way or another. Thorin (12,6) + 10 + 7 (again) -> 29 -> a manic wave of disruption!

As for the Veiled Alliance, survival - Penny (15,18) + 10 + 7 (all three groups turn out to have the same mods) -> 35, the vast majority make it. At the temple, they are able to stand guard and in game mechanic terms we have 35 rounds before adversaries outside start to get inside.

We get inside - the three of us, Mynos and Zorhanna. Corridors are vast! 10ft wide, 30ft tall. The many, large area are covered in very intricate mosaics; walls are patterned in gold, paintings made of rare metals, gems instead of eyes and stars all around. PWAT has been cast by Thorin. We enter a corridor; Francesc creeps forward to a junction - stealth 43. It's a crossroads, but with many different other branches just a short distance down any of the other corridors. Over to her left, 60-70ft away, is a huge statue, some 25ft call.

1: Thorin casts Locate Animals/Plants, looking for a black dragon. He does not detect anything! Well, at least that means whatever he is, Karnak is not a full black dragon yet. Zorhanna: "Interesting..." - and casts Locate Creature instead; "...a great idea, I didn't think of that..."; she gets a bearing.

2: We advance. There are a few options; Francesc can see one option, so Thorin sends a moth Familiar down another.

3: More or less straight ahead there's a big fountain. Francesc is fairly sure that's the way to go, given Zorhanna's direction. The moth advances and sees a room full of offerings - treasure, urns, metal weapons, plate and cups.

4: We split up a bit, checking different directions.

5,6: More investigation. A door that Francesc had gone through a while ago starts to close! Penny tries to hold it open; ATHL 10, she has to use *herself* to block it. 8 bludgeoning damage. She calls to Francesc who runs into her, and the two fall back into the fountain room.

7: Thorin perception 29. Smells dark, rotten, putrid flesh. Tonnes of it. He sees stairs and, beyond, massive tentacles growing out of the walls. By this point the rest of us catch up with him; Zorhanna points; "It's through there!"

8: The moth flies into the room - and melts. Acid. And at that, two deformed-looking templars emerge out of the now-known-acidic mists at the back of the room, shadow blades drawn. A voice says, **"I thought I put you in the cage of fire. Have you come to worship me, finally? Didn't anyone say it was rude to lurk around corners?!"**

(End of act 2, part 24)
