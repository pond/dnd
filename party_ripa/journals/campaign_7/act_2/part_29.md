# RIPA: Act 2 Part 29
## Session 75 (2025-10-21)
### Campaign day 31 on Krynn, inside one of the Three Moons Vault towers

We've entered a basement level of one of the Three Moons Vault towers and quickly encountered some wraiths, who have left (Fl)urth and Francesc in quite bad shape. After accidentally disturbing a scrying pool just after the battle finished, we heard Lord Soth calling for someone called "Teremini", while making reference to the "rod piece" and talking about a ritual that's underway. It seems that the only thing Lord Soth saw was Thorin's (confused!) spectral dragon and after a while he gave up trying to get an answer, presumably going back to his ritual.

It's not hard to guess that the ever-evasive Alustriel's very hurried demeanour prior to our departure was probably due to her being aware of this ritual either being underway, or at least suspecting there being a good chance of it. Our party must decide whether we should try to press on in our current condition, risk trying to rest up nearby while remaining undetected and hoping that the ritual, whatever it is, doesn't complete, or even decide that we have to bail out entirely and come up with a new strategy.

We discuss whether or not to proceed but it's unanimous; we'll do so. There's no point coming back later, really, given that there could just be more wraiths by then. Thorin, uncharacteristically, takes some pity on Francesc's state in particular and offers to cast now, or hold a high level spell that can restore her health potential to maximum (though it won't heal; it just reduces HP).

Penny once again reaches out to try and figure out a more distinct idea of where undead may be via Divine Sense. A few above, many below! There's a strange presence too - surprising - a Celestial, on *this* level. Going downwards seems suicidal! Going up would be the play, but we all want to check out that Celestial signal. It seemed to be from *behind* the scrying pool. Urth suggests going up a northwards passage to try and find our way there. Healing up with stealth to check ahead, Francesc discovers a prison! There are a few unconscious beings here.

Penny approaches one cell. The person is curled up in a ball on the floor. Long, messy hair. Facing away. Thick traveller's clothes, ripped. Strange pools of unrecognisable liquid have formed in a few places on the floor. Urth notices strange feet; they're not wearing shoes and seem to have long, clawed paws. Almost canine... "Knolls?" asks Penny. Urth (HIS ADV 30!) - descendants of hyena-related humanoids, but they don't exist on Krynn - at least not previously. They're usually 7-8 feet tall but this person isn't that big.

We elect to come back later! They're asleep (or unconscious) and waking them might cause havoc. The celestial may know more anyway. A locked door to the West would lead the way we want to go; after a quick check for traps (15), tries to unlock SOH with Bardic -> 17; well, it's not elegant but it's enough. The door opens. The room behind reeks! Sewage kind of smell, big clumps of shed, bristly fur left around, claw marks on the wall. CON saves needed for those who are in.

Penny is OK so she proceeds. Thorin follows. Penny is looking for any spell components, sigils, exits; INVEST 16, no exits; not much to see at all, really. She looks closely at the hair and scratch marks. Nature 25. The clumps look like shedding. The claw marks look like something desperate to escape - more are near the door. Quite a bit of blood here too.

Penny turns on her heel, walks right out and pretty much orders Francesc - "open that cell door" (the Northwards one) "...please". SOH nat 20. Opens smoothly. No movement. Francesc and Thorin don't get anywhere with a medical check; Urth does better! They're alive but the pulse is weak. Their faces are partially changed - as if they were shapeshifting but got caught, or stuck, somehow. Urth remembers the red glow around us - something to do with preventing shapeshifting!

There are runes - tattoos or even *carvings* - that he finds familiar. They're druidic. "Markings of a tribe or circle", says Thorin. This one is quite badly wounded. Some of the strange pooled liquid here is what's come out of them, but it's not blood - a strange, shimmery, slick liquid. He casts Cure Wounds, albeit only for 9hp. A bit of colour returns as the worst of their wounds seal a little. They start to come to, but the moment they do, they retreat into a corner and start snarling at us, afraid. It's the behaviour of a wild animal, threatened.

Penny offers a waterskin as Urth tries to approach, ADV Animal Handling only 10; it seems to notice that something's not quite right; a bit of light returns to the eyes - and now it - they - speak in a hoarse voice. "Who - who are you? You're not... But you - you *are* a red..." - Urth indicates that he's wearing a disguise. Then he grabs the waterskin and gulps down a good half of it!

it looks pained - as if trying to shift back - Urth explains the red light is the problem. A conversation slowly starts up. This is a local, so to speak, from the South; they were captured along with the rest of his circle. They're being experimented upon; their druidic longevity is being extracted by experiments. And there was a unicorn! The oldest living being that was in their circle; Penny realises **the unicorn is probably the celestial**. This person's name is Vahn. He says another was taken to that bad room we saw earlier; we don't know what happened to them.

Francesc reminds us - "big cloud of Undead coming up from below, remember!" while unlocking another door; a woman lies here but medicine 23, this one has died, probably in this cell. Vahn pushes past and looks at the dead woman; he fights emotions of anger, sadness - but the anger rises - approaching rage. He's fighting something bestial inside.

Thorin's dragon spirit is down the corridor and detects movement from the far end. Thorin warns us; skeletal swarms are approaching! Francesc moves to the Eastward door; it looks like a main entrance. The lock is formidable and SOH 21 isn't enough to open it. Penny, seeing the struggle, dashes back out towards the scrying pool. Thorin's dragon begins to engage, using its breath weapon down the corridor to hit the leading swarm. Urth runs back to get a line of sight just beyond the dragon and casts a wall of fire, to block the way.

We've not seen this kind of magic before; Urth swings around his lute, deftly removing a finger pick from a chain around his neck, strums faster and faster as if "charging up" the lute, then *points it* down the hallway and in a flash quicker than the eye can follow, the fire wall bursts into view. The skeletons try to push through, all the same; they start to attack the spectral dragon.

Penny shouts back, "GET THAT DOOR OPEN!" and tries to find any kind of mechanism, opening, switch or similar; investigation 17; she finds only where the water is flowing out. Doesn't look like there's anything there. But there *is* a weird sense of unease, standing in this pool; it's desecrated ground. She runs to the edge to get out of the pool.

Thorin wonders if there's something as simple as a key to the door! Francesc tries to prepare herself to try and pick the lock again via Guidance. Thorin notices a *third* swarm pushing in behind the others! The dragon manages to take down the lead swarm, though, but the other is close behind. Penny starts to run back to the prison room, but Thorin is charging down the corridor towards his dragon as she runs in there; "The action is that way!" he shouts; Penny looks and notices that her Sense isn't indicating much more than we can see. She's encouraged and does a 180 to follow.

Urth is talking to the druid; he wants to join us and get some form of closure/revenge. Urth gives him a healing potion! The druid warns Francesc that the guards are coming from behind the guard but, strangely, Francesc persists - later explaining that she wants to give us another exit. She needs a luck point, then Heroic *and* Guidance - but finally, it unlocks.

Penny meanwhile shouts back "No more after this, we can see them all!" and reaches the dragon. "**Thorin!** Your fat-ass dragon's blocking the corridor". The dragon looks around at her, looking hurt and sad! She feels bad...

Three mechanism clunk and pull back. She figures that guards would surely have heard all this commotion and pulls open the door. "THe door's open!" she shouts back; looks down the corridor revealed; and realises the corridor it connects to is the one we've already walked down! It must be relying on the wraiths - seems like a pointless door!

Penny shoves past the dragon - squeaking of armour against scales and scraping against the wall - and finds herself stuck between dragon and fire wall. Jumping through isn't such a good idea... Flurth has wandered closer and opines that just *waiting* would do, the fire will take down the swarms. The swarm, though, has other ideas, walking in through the fire and hitting Penny for 7 damage. And this one is doing better against the fire effect.

Francesc investigates the Northward direction of the corridor and sees stairs heading up. Then she looks at another room off the North-South nearby corridor - a strangely shaped room full of raised daises with sarcophagi on them. There's a strange liquid flowing from the North-Eastern corner of the room. Vahn guards the stairs.

Penny is attacking the last swarm through the fire with the sun sword. 26 damage from two hits does it - they fall. She calls back, noticing now that there are no further undead in that direction. Urth drops the fire spell.

People decide to *not* investigate the creepy sarcophagus room! We start to head South, but Thorin and his dragon go to swap with Vahn - who insists on coming with us, since we're trying to find the unicorn.

Southwards, we feel - dread. To the East, strange columns and stairs up in something akin to terraces, within an older-looking sections. More of the strange liquid. There are figures carved into the columns - elves - but not the same age or style as in the entrance. The red mixes with a blueish light coming from the walls. To the West, a curved section that might well lead behind the scrying pool - and Vahn is about to run off. Penny has to persuade him not to! (26).

Francesc wants to investigate the columns room. Double-checking that there are no undead "visible" there, Penny says "shout if you need us" and heads West, chasing the unicorn signal, with (Fl)Urth and Vahn. There are a series of large iron doors dotted along the curved corridor. We reach one particular solid, large, iron door. The unicorn signal, fading now as the divine effect fades, is coming from behind it.

Francesc meanwhile continues to investigate this strange other room. Looks like there was an offering table that's removed, a tapestry, some of the earth is dug out here; there's a door at the far end; it's all a bit confusing. Insight 20. It "feels like" the series of steps heading up would be where people step upwards to pray. This door is where a priest might emerge - something beyond the "public" space. SOH 18, to unlock the door; just enough to unlatch it *from the other side*. Perception 17. She can hear wind. Fresh air comes from a long flight of stairs. She starts to walk up them and - DEX save, nat 20! 31 total. A tripwire, narrowly avoided. A few more along the stairs. Up at the top, a slight change in the red light, but she can't from here tell what it leads to.

Meanwhile Penny, perception 21, tries to find traps or similar. Nothing. Old-fashioned lock for a large kzy. Urth tries looking for a key, all around the crescent room; no, unsurprisingly. But he sees Istarian writing. The room used to be priest's quarters. There are ranks on each door. *Not* a prison.

Urth then goes to - sniff the mystery liquid (!) - nature, nat 20. Interesting! "This is some form of condensed... Weave. Magic! A condensate of magic extraction." He guesses it was extracted from beings, objects, magical effects, but it's everywhere, so if that's kind of 'distilled magic' - all over the place - then, wow, that's a *lot* of power.

Penny tries to barge the door. ATHL - only 14. Urth is running in and does the same thing - ATHL 24, the door flies open! And there is a - a... It's... A sort of winged elephant - *thing*? It's tiny, maybe the size of a typical house cat. There are four feathered wings, in fact, where ears would be.

(It's a Hollyphant).

Penny, REL dirty 30. Well, a unicorn is a manifestation of a celestial spirit; that's the form it chooses to take; but the forms can differ. If it *took on* the form of a unicorn to be familiar to druids, it *might* be forced to another form in this red field. Penny asks Vahn, "What was the name of your unicorn" - he answers, **Urian**. So Penny says, "Vahn, meet - I think - the true form of Urian. Urian, I think that you know Vahn." It emits a series of melodic tones. We don't know what that is, and then it repeats it; we *think* this must be language, but we don't know it.

We eventually get the Hollyphant to follow us. We meet up with Francesc heading our way and she asks, to Penny's embarrassment, if she asked if there were any other people trapped there! She didn't even think to check. So, Penny starts from the Northwards room. There's a puddle of the liquid which she has to stand in cautiously - no obvious effects - takes a couple of tries to barge open the door; then it opens, but there's nobody there. There *is* however some steps that head upwards but they're magically formed.

We team up and all try to open other doors Southwards. It takes Fran *ten* tries to open the door, ultimately taking 3 damage in the process! Her room is empty but looks _recently_ vacated. There are personal effects here. All rooms are empty. Penny's room has less of the liquid - partly dried - Francesc has more in theirs; but there's nowhere near as much as that Northmost room with the stairs. Francesc checks the personal effects. Religious iconography. Urth has a look and recognises nothing much, given his familiarity with this world - these are items that indicate the person who was here **thought the gods were real**. That's very strange for Krynn! Nothign Istanrian here.

Urth notes that the floor layout of this place look like a crescent - like the moon - the circular rooms jutting out, perhaps planets? NAT 20 on Religion. He remembers bard school; his esoteric interest led him to very old texts that talked about mythical beings called gods. They had religions and temples, with priests who held positions of power and privilege. That's nothing like Krynn now. The people here, he thinks, are *not* believers from another plane, another world. These are people who believed in gods from the very old stories of Krynn. But in terms of construction time, **these are new**.

Have the gods returned?!

Urth recalls things about hidden knowledge, secret knowledge; **secrets** but - he doesn't voice it! Penny and Francesc don't know.

We call down Thorin (who leaves the dragon on guard) and move to the sarcophagus room to investigate more. Francesc starts to carefully pick her way up the tripwire stairs. Lots of checks! Successful; she finds herself in a room that looks rather like a chapel, with an altar and pulpit. Nobody here - but then there's a voice! "Hey, who's that in there?!" - and out through the windows she sees a patrol that has spotted her (very high perception roll). They yell! **"We have an intruder!"** and start running to the East.

Francesc initiative!

The guards are starting to run in; she attacks the first. She hits, 16 damage; a second hit, more damage; then she bails out! She heads down the stairs, but has to be careful to avoid tripwires - but is hurrying and perception (12) is not great; DEX save - only 13! She hits a wire. A forcefield grabs her, 7 damage, holding her in stasis. She calls for help. She only made it about 12ft. A guard appears at the top of the stairs, hitting once with crossbow bolts for 5 damage. Then another leans in, firing twice again; she dodges one again, but the other hits for 12.

Urth: 19
Penny: 18
Thorin: 11

Francesc manages to break free of the force field and continues down the stairs. Perception 23, no problem; she gets to the bottom.

Penny manages to convince the others to *not* fight. Guards are alerted; we need to run. She recommends the 'weird' stairs. "That strange stairwell must lead _somewhere!_" - the others are convinced and run off. She waits until last. The guards don't come down; they are not pursuing; the wraith blew an alarm horn, and these guards seem surprised, so what was *that* for?! No time to think further - she runs after the group.

Urth ADV HIS 21. He remembers enough about hierarchies of the order of mages - the school of High Sorcery - that mages occupy a whole strata of status above anyone employed such as guards or administrators. The mages are well above anyone. If they give a command, it's (usually!) obeyed. And he realises - he is disguised as one. But they'd need to see him.

To Penny's astonishment as she runs after the group, Urth and Flurth turn and run back! At the base of the steps they both Misty Step, to the surprise of the guards. Their insight rolls are low (4) and they don't realise it is a disguise. "We took care of the ruckus. You can call off the reinforcements." "But there was an elf?" "*Now!*" he says - deception - **33**. The guards of course immediately capitulate.

Urth/Flurth have to be *very* careful descending the stairs. Perception nat 20.

Thorin casts Tongues to speak with the Hollyphant as we make our way to the 'strange stairs', no longer feeling so much urgency. This confirms - yes, it's Urian. He's been watching over the Circle of druids for generations. They have a rare condition where they're much closer to their animal sides than most. The condition is passed down. When the gods left the plane, Urian was sent as an agent; the gods can't show themselves, but they can do *that*. And *this* is Urian's normal form.

Penny asks Thorin to ask about the strange liquid, stairs and so-on. "Teremini and her staff, who are renegades, have been trying to extract raw magic - distilled magic - out of creatures who draw on the world's natural magic; druids and natural magical beings. She's trying to harness something tied to this realm and soak it in her own lunar magic, to activate a rod that she stole."

The druids knew about the rod because the dryads called out to them when the giant tree came under attack. The circle made an oath to recover it and avenge the death of the Ancient Ones who had resided in the tree.

Thorin, insight nat 20+10 -> 30! Urth, insight 19+mod, also manages to start to realise the way the language works. The rest of us all roll >= 20 insight and realise that Urian harbours a secret. Someting they're ashamed of; something they tiptoe around. Penny, helped by Urth, persuasion 25 to try and get Urian to explain. Vahn doesn't realise what he's saying but *we* can understand it. With great guilt... A character flaw of this... Always been viewed as the leader, the mascot, the herald that looks after the Circle. This caused hubris. A retaliatory attack was planned poorly. Not enough research into this "red field"; didn't realise that, by attacking thus impaired, that most of the members of the circle were doomed to death and Urian was giving Teremini exactly what she needed.

(This counts as a *secret*).

We all do *not* reveal this to Vahn.

Urian has seen other parts of the tower. Knows that the partially ruined White Tower is where some *really* awful experiments are being conducted. Teremini is often in the Red Tower. The "blood" (as he calls it - magic distillate) is being collected in the Black Tower. And Urth realises - **each of the sets of stairs we have discovered leads to a different tower**. Urian knows the way to the white tower; that's closest to his cell. So that'll be the strange magically created stairs.

Penny heals Francesc up to her new-low-max of 55 while we debate - Urth wants to "go with the mission" - red or black towers hold the rod and the ritual. We don't know which. But Francesc and Penny are interested in the white - experiments, sounds awful, people to rescue! At least it's ruined, too, so maybe we might be able to rest there. We do know:

* The magic distillate is taken to the black tower
* Teremini is somewhere in the red tower
* We figure that the ritual *isn't stared yet* - Teremini is doing the groundwork - Lord Soth isn't here yet, but will arrive once things are in place to start that ritual.

(End of act 2, part 29)
