# RIPA: Act 2 Part 25
## Session 71 (2025-07-29)
### Athas, city of Tyr, in the Temple (Outlands relative day 27)

From deep inside the Temple, a voice calls out:

**"I thought I put you in the cage of fire. Have you come to worship me, finally? Didn't anyone say it was rude to lurk around corners?!"**

Thorin uses his Clairvoyance boon to call forth his eye of Vecna, putting it out beyond the templars to try and get a feel for the room's size. He sees a huge room, with massive, gnarled old trees (surprisingly, though they look sickly) and - _something_ - in the centre, sat upon a massive mound of bones and sculls. Karnak, we presume! He's huge and misshapen; an abomination. Maybe 16ft tall! The head is dragon-like, as is the lower body, but there's a strange human quality to his torso. Around on the ground and on the walls are strange fleshy coiled tentacles. There's a 5ft wide chalice full of water in front of Karnak.

Penny's not in the mood to chat. She draws and lights the sun blade. Francesc readies the bow. Zorhanna drops Locate Creature and casts Mind Blank on herself; for the next 24h she's immune to psychic damage, along with a litany of other mental resilience features. "Sorry, I can only do that for myself!" she says; Penny quips, "It's fine, I have extraordinary mental resilience" as Thorin points at his head and says, "Nothing in there!". Mynos is uneasy; he seems to be "in his head". Thorin reminds him about the conversations we've had on self-determination. This helps; he focuses on Thorin. He forms a kind of telekinetic barrier, akin to Mage Armour.

Initiative!

* Thorin 24
* Zorhanna 23
* Francesc 21
* (Unbeknownst to the players at table) Arturo 19
* Mynos 18
* Penny 11

Thorin acts first. His perception is good; he thinks Karnak is at ease with the environment around him. The trees probably fuel it. He must be so in control of the environment that he can probably manipulate it to suit him. And it looks like he's resistant to a lot of things! (He's calling out as he notices things, and Francesc wonders if burning the trees might cause him to have to 'work harder' at getting magic; but that would mean killing plant life from further away).

He runs forward a bit and drops a L3 Moonbeam onto one of the approaching templars, along with a tentacle. As it happens, Karnak's eyes flick over to him and a wave of psionic interruption hits. Thorin INT save, 23! The spell succeeds & no damage. The Moonbeam damage potential is 17; CON 18 save for the templar; makes it, takes 8 (radiant). The tentacle writhes and retreats, apparently taking damage. The moonbeam also seems to affect the acid mist and the tentacle's movement makes the mist billow. It can be affected by air currents.

Zorhanna runs in front of Thorin and gambles on Karnak's psionic range being limited, with her just out of range in that position; she casts Magic Missile. 11 damage to Karnak. She's still in sight, if not necessarily in the same range, and that is an error - he throws a psionic shock at her. She makes an INT save; she's immune to psychic damage anyway, and isn't concentrating on spells anyway.

Karnak crawls across the *ceiling* towards our position and hangs from there, with one claw sinking into a tentacle below for balance. He can see Zorhanna and Thorin, with Penny just on the fringes and blasts his acid breath. DEX saves. Penny 23 (pass), Thorin 24 (pass), Zorhanna 20 (which is a fail). 15d6! 67->33 for her, and halved for Penny and Thorin again, to 16 each. Zorhanna reacts with some kind of Arcane Ward, soaking up 30 of the 33. Thorin notices that the templar in full blast of the acid breath is totally unaffected.

Francesc wants to run up the corridor, but it's covered in acid now. She can just about see one of the templars, but not Karnak. She scuttles up the wall to see him, quickly casts Hunters Mark on him then gets back to a safe space and fires at the templar (the dragon is immune to acid, charm, being knocked prone; it's resistant to fire; she calls this out). 25 to hit, hits; 19 damage; Stasis Strike takes the damage up to 25, plus WIS 17 save; templar makes the save, so no other effects. Next arrow hits too, 12 more damage. She notices a strange feeling, a sense in the back of her head; "shifty", almost a warp in the plane...

**...roses and birdsong; a tear opens; a flash of light and a huge fireball hits both templars** as **Arturo tumbles out into** a corridor of acid calling, "what the fuck, why am I burning?!" and rolls back out of the way - both of them fail their saves. They each take 29 fire damage (and the area is cleared of acid, at least for now). One of the templars now looks on the edge of death!

Mynos is close to Arturo and amazed to see this unexpected arrival. His spirits have lifted. "Arturo! Arturo, what was your big plan for when I came in here?!" he asks, telepathically. He responds that it was nothing in detail, but to *definitely not* sacrifice him as a pawn! "But should I get into the fray or hold back?" "Go for it, get in there!" - so he floats up and ends up above Zorhanna, then uses Psychic Shove (!) - a sort of telekinetic push attack - aimed one each at the templars and Karnak. 13, 22, 23; two hits, killing on templar and pushing another back, taking 25 psychic damage; Karnak isn't pushed, but takes 16 damage. He retreats some distance down the acid-covered corridor, but he's floating so isn't hurt by that.

The remaining templar moves to get a line of sight into the corridor and opens a Howling Void, centred where he can see which is roughly on Thorin; a great rift opens (again) from the ground (at least the acid drains!) but in our heads we hear maddening screams. WIS saves all around.

Penny 30. Zorhanna and Mynos are out of aura range but Thorin, Arturo and Francesc are all within it and all make their saves. Zorhanna's earlier spell means nothing can affect her; Mynos is naturally immune to psychic damage but *does* make his save (17) to avoid being frightened. Those of us who saved take 3 psychic damage.

Penny calls out, "too damned slow" and starts to run; she hears Mynos ask, "Do you trust me!?" "Yes!" - reality around her warps and changes. She is propelled forward and ends up right in Karnak's face! She's only 10ft of movement.

..."The hells with it"...

Runs forward and swings at Karnak! 23. Hits. Divine smite, senses undead too, so 5d8+5 Radiant total; 22 damage,, though, not too high. He seems to take all of that damage, but it's just a scratch! ADV perception 18. At best that was 5% of what Karnak can take. "Uh, guys, this one's a bit hardy..." she calls. Swings again. Crit! 4d8+5, 22 damage. She looks around; long limbs, tentacles; not much room to escape. So she stands her ground.

Karnak is unimpressed. He causes a Cone Of Fear, 30ft wide, but Penny is immune to that! He knows now, mind you. He speaks in a strange, layered voice - as if 5 or 6 people are talking simultaneously but slightly out of time; "Only fools don't fear anything. Is that what you are?" - with absolute honesty she answers, "Yep, nailed it..." - but she notices that he seems more connected with his lair now. There is a strange sound creeping into consciousness, screams and moans... But she takes 3 acid damage.

Thorin easily resists (WIS save) the strange effect and holds onto his Moonbeam spell concentration; he moves it onto Karnak (CON 18 save made), 15->7 damage. Now safe within the acid-free area thanks to  Wildshapes into a Giant Scorpion.

Zorhanna says, "Excuse me, scorpion...!", moving into the acid-free area cleared by the fireball. She throws a lightning bolt at Karnak, but he responds with Psionic Interruption - but her save is a nat 20 (total 30) and the spell succeeds. 10d6 -> 38 damage, which Karnak seems to take; and it kills the templar, who was in the line of fire, too.

The room would be dark, but there's light on Karnak - the sword and Moonbeam. But then Karnak gets annoyed; it seems he wanted to do something but it'd require darkness. It's as if he wants to reach out and swat Zorhanna... Penny, insight 17; he can teleport into shadows, but he needs to be in the dark himself. So instead, he lifts up his head and emits a strange, loud series of clacking noises - and crawling out of the stone throne emerge four more templars. They look different, though; more like ones we've met before, not misshapen.

Then, he seems to start casting something; he draws in defining magic from around and *all* the trees in the room die. And drawing magic alone requires CON saves for everyone within 60ft. Francesc and Arturo are out of range; Mynos is in range, Penny, dirty 20 (fail), Mynos 26 (makes it), Thorin 13 (fails). Failures -> 34 necrotic, else 17. Zorhanna uses her reaction to extend out her Arcane Ward, helping Penny avoid 31 of the damage (!). Penny recognises some kind of fire-based area effect and attempts to Counterspell; CON 18 save; he fails, but uses a Resistance. The spell happens anyway and basically gets everyone, both in the main room and down the corridor; a kind of firestorm.

DEX saves all round.

* Thorin 21
* Francesc 20 (with Heroic Inspiration)
* Penny 16
* Zorhanna 24
* Mynos 21 (with Heroic Inspiration)
* Arturo 22 (with a sorcery point)

<= 20, 38 fire damage else 19.

At least he takes 13 damage from Moonbeam!

Francesc fires at Karnak. 29, hit. 24 damage. Next fires at one of the Templars; uses Lightning Arrow; crit! 10d8 damage - 38 damage on Templar C, but there's a "splash effect" to 2 other templars (A,B) and Karnak within range, 19 damage potential, DEX 17; templars fail, taking 19, Karnak succeeds, taking 9. She retreats, but WIS save 11 for lair effects (but has DISADV on saving for Fear, but is immune anyway thanks to Heroes Feast).

A Lair Action activates. The whole floor changes across the entire temple and becomes shifting, crumbling stand. Anyone standing needs a STR save.

* Thorin 15 - as a Scorpion, he's able to climb out even though he's sunk
* Francesc 18 - holds onto Mynos and doesn't sink as much
* Penny 18 - also sinks, but her hands are free
* Zorhanna - sinks too
* Arturo 4 - sinks to the waist into the sand, holding him in place somewhat
* Mynos is flying

All of the templar guards also sink, except for the one (templar C) that's on top of the throne mound. Templar A digs himself out of the trap.

Arturo can *just* see the middle square between two of the templars so throws out a whirlwind. It catches A, B and C along with Karnak. DC 21 DEX, and he's done it with Careful Spell. The sculls etc. of the throne are whipped up into the wind, along with the three templars. 41 damage potential, bludgeoning; plus 3d8 slashing (from all the sand and bones) -> 13 -> 54 total. Karnak uses a Legendary Resistance (since he failed the save); templar guards A, B and C are all down. Karnak takes 27 damage.

Karnak is getting increasingly annoyed. He looks at Thorin/Scorpion, the source of the moonbeam; he throws out a Psionic Shock. His save, 17, fails; 30 psychic damage -> 15; CON save on the moonbeam but as DISADV due to the shock. 29 (!) - holds the spell.

Mynos flies forward and asks his allies telepathically if we're OK where we are and if we'd like to move. He can "shift" reality amongst us; casting Scatter, basically. Arturo is happy where he is; Francesc wants to move across the room to stairs she's noticed in the distance; Thorin/Scorpion wants to be close to Karnak; Penny just wants to be no longer buried in the sand!

Penny keeps on attacking. She gets in a hit (22), with L4 Divine Strike - 7d8+5 -> 32. Tries again. Hits (24), 28d+5 -> 19 damage.

A templar attacks Thorin/Scorpion. It starts channelling something, and Penny sees that it looks *bad*. Counterspell; CON 18 is made, so it's no good. Thorin makes his save, fortunately, but still takes 61->30 necrotic damage.

(Karnak "changes how the lair is working" but it takes a moment to take effect).

Thorin/Scorpion CON save 18, holds his spell. He attacks Karnak. 16, 21 for claws; both miss! (AC22). Stinger (tail), nat 1. Damn. He "re-wildshapes" to regain some health! He's in the acidic atmosphere still, but only takes 3->1 damage from it.

Zorhanna's turn. She assess the field and decides to attack. She manages to get Disintegrate through -> 10d6+40! -> 81 potential. ADV DEX save, makes it. 40 taken. He looks like he might be Bloodied now. He fails his Moonbeam save and just lets it happen, apparently not bothered by the effect; 11 more damage (on a bad roll). Doesn't get Breath back but *does* get Defining Magic. And that draws on *us*. CON saves:

* Thorin 15 (fails)
* Francesc 21 (saves)
* Arturo is out of range
* Penny 26 (using Heroic Inspiration)
* Zorhanna fails (despite +5 aura)
* Mynos (makes it)

Penny can't react with Soothe Pain (already reacted with Counterspell). 23 necrotic, halved for saves. Now he casts Disintegrate on Zorhanna! 81 damage potential. She has retained her Arcane Ward and she uses it in reaction. ADV DEX save (it's a spell) plus 5 for Aura, 23 total, makes it; 40 would be taken; magic resistance halves it to 20; takes it, rather than burning Arcane Ward.

Francesc attacks Karnak at range; 29 hits; 20 damage; then Ensnaring Strike, but 19 misses; she moves around the corner a bit, out of the far side of the room and into a hitherto unexplored corridor beyond. After that, Karnak's lair change takes effect. A Defiled Essence (Penny Arcana 31, Arturo arcana 22) recognise that healing *spells* might work in reverse and actually cause harm. At least the ground is now properly solid!

Arturo moves to regain line-of-sight and moves his whirlwind to clean up more of the acid. The remaining templar is pulled into it and takes 56 damage. He can't hear much due to the wind noise. Karnak makes his save, but still takes 28 damage. He retreats via his Fey ability to Misty Step.

Mynos asks Penny if she's injured. "Yes, but I'd rather you injure Karnak more!" "I can do both... Are we winning?!" "I _think_ we're OK, so far, at least." So Mynos throws 3 psychic shoves at Karnak; miss, hit, miss. 26 damage. He uses a psionic ability too; Channel Life; he takes 14 necrotic damage (which Penny notices) and heals her for 14. She recognises it's not *her* life force; she realises what he's sacrificed. He moves forwards, towards Karnak and calls out - "Karnak, you have been a tyrant for too long. This ends today!" - Karnak just laughs. "Whose child is speaking to me?!" "I may be a child but my entire life has existed for one purpose and one purpose only, and that is to end you!"

Penny thinks Mynos has established a life connection to herself. But costs him! She pours 40hp into herself (lay-on-hands) and continues her attack. She hits twice, getting 15 and 17 damage. She laughs impetuously at Karnak!

The remaining templar calls down a flame strike onto Mynos. Zorhanna is caught in it too. 18 fire, 18 radiant potential. They both make their saves, taking a total of 18 damage each.

A psionic cataclysm is activated by Karnak. A pulse of energy goes out. INT saves.

* Thorin 23 (with heroic inspiration)
* Francesc 21 (saves)
* Arturo 7 (fails)
* Penny 20 (fails)
* Zorhanna (saves, but is immune to psychic anyway)
* Mynos (fails, but is immune to psychic)

30 damage to fails, DISADV on next attack; no damage on saves. Zorhanna reacts to save Penny from all damage, as she's immune to psychic anyway.

Thorin returns to his normal form and moves to melee range, then drinks a Potion Of Invulnerability.

Zorhanna sees that she's damage, as is Penny and Zorhanna. She activates a Globe Of Invulnerability. But then Karnak casts Synaptic Stack, INT saves all round - *except* Karnak can only really access Thorin, due to that Globe. He then moves away; Penny opp attack, hit, 13 damage; Thorin opp attack, casts Faerie Fire but Karnak makes the DEX 18 save. Karnak kills his own templar through his spell! Thorin INT save, 24; takes half; 44->22->11 taken. But Karnak is now in darkness and can teleport - close enough to Francesc to attack. He hits for 17 slashing and 9->4 acid damage.

While Karnak is in melee range, Francesc from her perspective is further away. She gets two hits, for 33 and 12 damage.

Arturo moves his whirlwind. Karnak fails his DEX save for once; total damage, with some re-rolls, is 53. He has no Legendary Resistances left and takes *all* that damage. All the scull and sand shred into him. Then he appears to be at un-death's door, but there's a rush of necrotic energy. Screaming through the temple, we "feel"/hear all the energy around and within the temple. *All* his templars are killed... **He is revived, transformed fully into a skeletal dragon!**

"Do you really think you could take *me*, the dragon king sorcerer of Tyr... Six puny living beings? It has been fun toying with you but I'm bored with you now!"

Mynos looks at us and says, "This is why I'm here!" - and he uses Reality Warp. He takes 4d10 -> 18 necrotic damage, maximum HP *permanently* reduced by 18 short of a Wish spell; he and Karnak are paralysed by one turn.

The whirlwind goes wild... Arturo is very confused as another rift opens...

(End of act 2, part 25)
