# RIPA: Act 2 Part 11
## Session 57 (2025-02-04)
### Mournlands, ruined mage's tower, Outlands relative day 10

We met Mercy, leader of a small group of Warforged who want to save, rather than harness, docents - technology that held what they consider to have been souls (as close as the analogy can be drawn) of Colossi. These are held in reverence, instead of being used as now-"dead" mere tools for power amplification, as the Lord Of Blades would have it.

Llandro, the largest of all Colossi, has no docent; instead he used a prototype "grey matter engine", which amounts to the same concept of soul and consciousness, but on a much larger scale. In Llandro's case, the rod segment which we seek was used as the engine's power source. Llandro is merged with and trapped by the mountain _due_ to (they think) the Cataclysm, but lives. His existence, however, is likely to be an unhappy one given his physical condition.

Mercy's Warforged would not allow us to remove the rod and "kill" Llandro, although they conceded that they are small in number and might not be able to stop us. It transpired there might be a much better alternative though - a form of magical gem that can *hold* the consciousness. Llandro would be forever asleep, until such a time as a future construction of a grey matter engine or equivalent, might one day be able to carry his consciousness. They would guard the gem along with the docents.

We agreed. With that, they gave us information to help with our quest and even allowed use of a docent as an amplifier for the second rod segment, with which we accurately scried the position of the third within Llandro's trapped body. There were various possible locations of one of these powerful magic gems, but the easiest - in theory! - was to hope there may be one at the ruins of a powerful mage's tower, not too far away. We travelled there to find one.

Once within, we ended up at the basement and within sight of exactly what we need - but at that very moment, we are set upon by what appears to be the ghost of the tower's owner. Initiative!

* Francesc 13
* Thorin 12
* Arturo 11
* Penny 6

It's quite a tight space; there are other pieces of equipment beyond the crystal/gem under the cloche and cages hanging from the ceiling. Stones covered in glyphs of warding are at the bottom of the stairs, near to a mannequin close by, fitted with spectacular armour; we've avoided these so far; Thorin has landed in a circle of glyphs of some sort on the floor more in the middle.

The spectral mage stares at Thorin and drifts over, overlapping with his presence. CHA save 20+1 - he feels the numbing coldness of this strange entity for a moment, but it gets pushed out, unable to possess. Now its eyes sweep the room, seeing us all; some sort of strange coldness seems to draw around it and there are all the motions of casting a spell, WIS saves all round; we all roll unusually high, including Penny with a total of 30 (!) - astonishingly, the spell has no effect. Now it calls out in some language we don't recognise, flying away a little and swiping sideways; it seems to make a few pieces of what looks like Mah-Jong tiles fall off a display pedestal. As they land on the ground, there's an anguished cry, as another ghost appears.

Since the creature left Thorin's range, he warcasts Primal Savagery but he's not well practiced at casting upon opportunity and his swipe passes straight through it (nat 1 attack roll).

The new ghost also scans the room, but seems quite - scared, perhaps? It starts to scream and as it does so its face contorts into a horrifying, stretched-out appearance (horrifying visage) - another set of WIS saves. Thorin's OK, along with Penny; but this time Arturo, who had backed away a bit up the stairs and fallen outside Penny's aura range, along with Francesc don't resist the effect and are frightened (Side note: player forgets character sheet! Realises later in the game that Penny's aura should have prevented that, but it doesn't affect outcome so we just leave it as-is). Arturo (save value only 8); d4 -> 2 - suddenly, instead of looking his usual young self, he seems to weather; a hint of grey hair appears; he looks at least 20 years older. Thorin (ARC 17) recognises a strange, life-draining effect that has magically aged Arturo - but *can* be reversed. The new arrival then disappears into the floor!

Francesc, perception 23, can seem a faint glimmer of where the ghost *was* - which means she remains afraid, but stands her ground and attacks the spectral mage. Hunters Mark tells her that it is resistant to a *lot* of damage types and immune to poison, cold or necrotic damage. It also can't be physically restrained. There's not much she can do but try to hit it (while distracted about the other scary ghost!) and hope that at least *some* of her attack takes. Despite the distraction her arrow hits, for 16->8 damage; a Slow effect takes hold too. The second misses but at least she gets over her fear.

Thorin drops his existing moonlight spell and brings in the more powerful Moonbeam at L6, against the visible mage (the one that sunk into the floor ends up within the effect too, but is probably out of reach). Potential damage is 39. CON 17 save is failed *by both* as the one sunk into the ground had (as Francesc saw) not entirely vanished. They both seem to take all of it. The one in the ground leaps up, as if ejected forcibly, shredded, damaged and apparently terrified. The mage looks furious! Thorin then leaps across the room and lands just next to the crystal. He's decided to use no subtlety here and smashes against the cloche, which flies out of the way and leaves him able to grab the crystal - but perception 15; he grabs it and, as he lifts it, he hears a quiet "click" sound. DEX save 13 isn't enough; the wall behind the cloche has lots of small holes which, it turns out, are *not* decorative! A row of darts fly out; 18 piercing damage. Further, CON save 28; a strange, cold magic seems to emanate from the bolts - but he pushes it away.

Despite his fear, Arturo is more than capable of casting spells and does for his old favourite, Psychic Lance against the female spectre who aged him. Subtle Spell too and no wild magic surge; DC20 INT save failed, 33 damage... The spectre dissipates completely, disappearing as if in wisps and threads of consciousness. The small gnome, flitting up in the ceiling, wails and looks distressed! But Arturo is no longer afraid.

Penny jumps down, shouting, "This looks like a job for a paladin!", ATHL 20, perfect landing, swipes at the mage with the sunsword, 18 radiant damage; swipes again; 15 to hit, heroic inspo, 19. Hits, for 16 more damage. The mage looks at Penny and whispers something - that seems to have a tone of vengeance, as well as resignation. It doesn't look dismayed; it simply looks disappointed and frustrated. It vanishes.

Well, the two spectres who (deliberately or not) attacked us are gone. Thorin has grabbed the gem and the spectral gnome still flies above, upset but not attacking. She decides to elegantly jump down too.. ACRO 10! She lands outside the circle of runes but only just and has to kind of bail out of the roll, crashing into Thorin and trying to claim that she was helping him avoid more darts! She tries to examine the gem he holds, without touching it. But perception is only 9, but at that moment - more darts. DEX save; again, not enough; 21 damage. CON save, 18 (thanks to aura) - that same necrotic cold is felt, but again, brushed off.

Thorin's seen a second set of darts hit Francesc and between the laughter he hears the gnome chattering away in whatever language it's using, so casts Tongues. Now he can hear it trying to warn him and Francesc about the darts, as it'll keep firing! He warns her. "This is terrible, you can't understand anything I'm saying!" - so Thorin assures it he can *now* and asks it what is going on. "What? Well you set off the trap! There are lots more traps!" (and given Detect Magic's results, we realise that some of them are just simple physical mechanisms, not magical).

Thorin asks if the traps could *all* be deactivated... Well, the glyphs might be magically deactivated but the physical traps need much more care. "Why are you stealing the Master's Elemental? It is very foul-tempered!" - so the gem is either not what we think, or is "occupied". Thorin explains what we hoped for with the gem. The mood turns a bit; the gnome thinks we're thieves now. It claims they all 'live' here. Thorin starts relaying more of the conversation to the rest of us.

Arturo suggests we take the line of protecting them from the darkness infesting the place; Penny suggests a more truthful approach, talking about Llandro's consciousness. Francesc insight 15 sees that this gnome doesn't seem to be able to ever leave the cage - almost as if it restricts *itself* to that region. It sticks its head out but nothing more. Francesc gets Thorin to change tactic, so he tries to ask what's going on. "Why are you in the cage?" "The Master doesn't like his assistants messing around with things. If he needs me he will let me out to help. Honestly, I'd much prefer to be in here! I don't get hurt. And there are no accidents while I happen in here. But the Master is not around that much at the moment." At this, it seems as if the gnome is thinking something... Insight 27. He tails off... "Who are you, why are you here?" - he seems very forgetful. In fact he seems to have totally forgotten the entire conversation and might not even understand anything about what's going on. The Master has gone and is probably not coming back but even that seems forgotten.

Thorin tries a different line at deception! 15. It's not fully convinced, but sort of seems OK with it; it's no use to us; "You don't know the command words!" Things don't really improve on the conversation front. We don't get told the command word, but at least we know there's an Elemental inside. It's "one of the Master's prized possessions"; he'd never have sent anyone to get it and the gnome certainly won't tell us the command word. Thorin tries a Charm spell but it doesn't work.

(While this goes on, Penny wonders if this thing wants to leave - be free - but on insight 25, she's pretty certain that it *doesn't even know it is dead*. Penny is sure that these are all Restless; the two we have got rid of are only temporarily gone).

Thorin now tries Detect Thoughts. He gets surface thoughts and as he keeps talking, gets deeper; no, it can't remember the command word. But "Ness definitely knows the command word; speaking of Ness, where is she? She was supposed to feed me!". Now Thorin asks about the armour; "It's not going to fit you!" says the gnome. It was from a conquest; it's magical, treasure. Thorin asks what the most precious thing is? "The Master's spell books - but you'll never find them."

(Francesc meanwhile is investigating the runes on the floor. Investigation 14, luck point, 26. A cache of spell books is found! Arturo isn't book-based so these aren't interesting to him; things seem to be explained in a pointlessly complex and theoretical way. Francesc arcana nat 20 -> 22 - she knows enough to recognise that they're all Necromancy spells).

Thorin figures that if he slowly moves the crystal out of sight, eventually the gnome will simply forget that he has it.

**Francesc takes the spell books!** She hides them in the bag of holding.

Thorin wants to take the armour too. Penny feels its wrong somehow, especially with this worried gnome around, but she lacks the skill or magic to do anything about the spectres - "free" them - and this mage certainly doesn't seem 'good'; besides, Vecna is our big problem and anything that might help us fight, even if it's just tools to make money to buy more powerful artefacts - well, unfortunately, that makes sense.

(Via Detect Thoughts, Thorin has realised that this gnome has a limited loop of memory. It doesn't know the Master and Ness have actually died, isn't aware of what has happened above, doesn't even know about the Cataclysm. Ness knows the password, he's sure).

We don't know to summon Ness back. Penny wonders if those tiles on the table have relevance; but they seem random - a game that was interrupted? Arturo ARC 19, there's a presence tied to these tiles, on one side of the table only. There's a strange deafening feeling inside the room though, so something lingers here; a magical effect; something went wrong in this room some time. *That* is what effects this gnome and perhaps anyone else who stays here - like a curse. A never-ending loop.

Francesc tries to bag the armour. CON save, 17 (with aura). She feels poisoned, as a gas escapes from the corner of the room from vents on the ground. She stumbles over to Penny who helps with the poisoned condition as we all jump onto the stairs to keep clear; Thorin agrees to go down to block the vents and stop the poison gas from coming in. He tries throwing a blanket over them. That helps.

Arturo asks him to try and reset the game. Perhaps that'll stop the "loop". Arturo was going to do it before the poison gas was triggered. Thorin HIS 20 is fairly sure he remembers the way the tiles were before the board was struck. But during this time, he takes 8->4 acid damage from the remaining gas; and nothing seems to have happened when he resets the game. So now, he tries knocking the side of the board which Arturo said had the wisps of presence. This works! Ness's spectre rises up out of the ground.

Thorin immediately tries to apologise for messing up the game! "Oh! Oh. It's fine, I was losing anyway. It's fine... I do this to distract the Master." "Ah; I see..." "Who are you?!" (There's an interruption from the gnome - "Ness, did you bring the food? Ness I'm hungry!" "Just a moment; Pointer, I'll get it shortly!") Thorin tries to be persuasive as he relays information and Penny tries to help; persuasion 17.

Arturo comes down, curious. Ness relaxes at this, for some reason; Arturo is human and older. Ness seems to assume Thorin (insight) is a translator for this human!

"So have you defeated the Master?" she asks. "Are you the new Master?" - and Arturo just goes with it. He even goes upstairs and fetches some of the less messed-up books, putting them on shelves down here. Arturo promises he'll take much better care of her but does need to know the command word. She gives it!

We want to help more, but Thorin figures that if Ness is back, the Master might be back soon too. He wants to leave. So, we start to go... D20->17. We get out before the Master reappears, but we get the sense that we only just made it! The Darkness is still hiding away at what's left of the top of the tower. There are other doors to explore but we figure - quit while we're ahead... So we continue up, but now we need to get over the "forest" of plants. We used the Rod to jump in here, but we'll have to fly out. Thorin turns into a Quetz.; that solves that one! As we're leaving we see the shadow expanding back out around the tower.

Thorin lands at a high vantage point above the mist so we can discuss options. We've been flying towards Mercy's camp, wondering what we do about the Elemental in the gem. Thorin, back in dwarf form, checks the gem; ARC 19. When we say the command word the *trapped* Elemental will be released. The Elemental is then welcome to do whatever it wants... Penny might be able to Abjure it. Risky. Arturo's idea is to release the elemental over the enemy Warforged camp! But it'd be bad if it were an Air elemental as it could just chase us anyway. He examines the gem; it's pale blue; could be air or water. *Also* risky.

(An hour of discussion! Short Rest).

Group perception check; highest 16, Penny... We notice movement in the valley below. It seems like it is trying to be secretive. It looks like a group split into two, approaching from opposite sides.

This forces our hand. We figure Thorin will turn back into a Quetz; we'll release the elemental and Penny will try to Abjure it. As Arturo is holding the gem, though a crossbow bolt flies through the air and knocks the gem out of his hand! He takes 2 damage. Penny tries to catch it but SOH 5+0 -> nope! The gem lands on the ground nearby. Thorin still has Tongues and hears someone calling out - in the same language that Ness used - "Leave it! Leave it. You can choose to leave with your lives intact, or die for treasure!"

(Arturo's "Team Chat" is up now, so he relays it; he suggests turn into Quetz now and Arturo has his invisible Mage Hand on the gem).

A ragtag group of humans with crossbows is running up the hill. They're aiming at Thorin... It *just* matches AC for 10 damage. Francesc is torn about standing ground and fighting but Thorin insists we all get on board - so we do! Arturo drags the crystal over with Mage Hand.

Breaking out of the mist we see three people on each side of our hill. Two more crossbows fire; both miss wildly. Closer now, we see that these are soldiers - a hint of "fading glory" - but they seem a bit crazy or feral. They seem to be acting as a regiment, even so; and they're very much living.

We don't hang around - Thorin immediately takes off and, to stop more crossbow bolts, Francesc casts Wind Wall behind us - 15ft x 50ft - it blocks any more of their attacks. We hear frustrated yelling. "It's an Elementalist!" they're calling. Strange!

Thorin decides to give up on Mercy's group and tries to head towards Llandro, but needs a safe place to "drop off" the elemental. After a while of flying, but less than half of the distance, SURV 24; there's a plateau that looks good - above the mist. We set down and decide to give it a try. Penny takes the gem from Arturo, dismounts, walks a few feet away and **speaks the command word**.

Emerging out in a swirl of cloud, rapidly expanding to fill a 10ft space around, is a thundercloud. It's an air elemental. Penny calls out, "You are free and no longer under anyone's capture or control". Persuasion only 16; it's really the Abjure effect she is hoping for. The elemental is impressive - crackling with lightning and darkening rapidly. It speaks in Common! "If that is true, then give me my cage, that I will never be trapped again!" "We need this for the soul of Llandro, so that it will not die." "As I expected, like every previous master, you want nothing but power for yourself! I want power over my freedom!" - it launches in to attack.

* Arturo 28
* Francesc 28
* Penny 22
* Thorin 11

Arturo sees this and "bends time" and Penny goes first. She tries Abjure, WIS 17 save, which it fails; it is frightened, and has to now flee at maximum speed. Penny sees the cloud suddenly shrink away and she shouts, "TIME TO GO!" and tries to jump back onto Quetz.

Thorin doesn't waste time! Off we go. Francesc uses Longstrider to make Thorin's fly speed even faster; he can go at 90ft for the next hour.

We figure - 3 hours flying to get to Llandro. Penny, perception 17, sees nothing behind us. We could try to rest, but we're worried about things sneaking up on us. We figure we've spent some of our spells but not critically so; we press on.

Eventually the mountain looms up in front of us. It's extraordinary! Most of one leg, part of another visible, as if in a "battle-ready" pose; but embedded into the mountain. Even more strangely, this looks like it only just happened. No trees, bushes or grasses have grown around to soften the effect. The whole area looks craggy and blasted. Llandro was very close to the epicentre of one of the 'explosions', but not *at* the epicentre. That's *behind* the mountain.

Arturo is looking closely for tunnels; perception only 10, though; at this distance - nothing. Maybe in the shadows. He mentions it and Francesc checks more too (perception 26) - but she is distracted by something else first (see below!). We're also concurrently worried about the "effect" around Llandro; it might cancel magic and we could fall out of the sky. We drop down lower and Thorin perception 26 tries to *see* issues but can't see any specific effects. On the ground there seem to be plenty of tracks and other indications of movement - **and a few Warforged**, milling around the base of the mountain as if at camp.

Meanwhile, we all see that behind us **a cloud is approaching rapidly** - some 300ft away - but we've changed direction and we realise it had been gradually reeling us in once we slowed after Francesc's hour of speed boost. It's the elemental... Francesc starts launching arrows! The first hits; 21 damage; second hits; 13 more.

Thorin tries to straighten up and reduce the rate at which it closes ground. Francesc gets to fire more arrows. A solid hit, for 12; another very solid hit; 13 more again. We're kind of flying alongside Llandro. Penny and Arturo see that the Warforged below have certainly noticed us. We warn Thorin who starts to take evasive actions. D8->8. Francesc keeps going. Two hits; 9, 14 damage. We estimate 280ft and closing. Arturo considers summonining a spirit; perception requested, only 2; he calls a Force (amethyst?) dragon. It flies with us to start with. Thorin, evasion; D8->8 again. Not as evasive as we hoped... And we suddenly find ourselves *flying towards* the cloud. Only 120ft! She fires again; hits; 11... And that's enough, before Arturo even gets a chance to launch a Psychic Lance. It "bursts"; just dissipates. Arturo *thinks* something changed in the gem; but perception roll in the moment is too low for details.

Francesc's earlier perception roll at Arturo's direction - she saw three caves that look promising. One is close to the ground and looks like a full cave. One is maybe 100ft up the slope. Another is harder to see, some 500ft up. Penny shouts out in unison with Arturo - "GO FOR THE HIGH ONE!" - the Warforged are very aware of us and giving chase on the ground.

Thorin flies in directly - then **suddenly loses all control of where he is going**. The other three of us are totally disorientated. Penny is "flying" to the right, Francesc straight up and Arturo to the left. Thorin-Quetz is heading downwards.

Arturo is aware that he is *not* falling. It's very confusing. He only felt like he was falling once he stopped trying to do anything else and realised he's "falling upwards". Now he tries Feather Fall; his rise rate slows.

Penny has time to realise that "falling sideways" is great, until she's not in whatever this effect is anymore and plummets what she figures is 300ft down to the ground! Oh. So... It this - *it*? What a bizarre way to go. She chastises herself in her inner monologue! That was careless!

Thorin tries to "pull up". ACRO as Quetz; 8! The more he tries not to fall, the more he seems to.

Arturo spots his dragon having trouble too; ACRO for it; 14. The dragon mentally commands that it has figured it out and needs to fly. He sees Francesc has pulled too far away; so he commands it to head to Penny and try to catch her. Arturo himself is "falling" upwards, so he just lets it go.

To Penny's astonishment, she is suddenly caught by and riding a magical dragon. She asks it (if it can hear her?) to get to the nearest spot of ground and try to catch Arturo. Penny ends up down on the ground level with the Warforged - not great! - but at least "down is down", once she's there.

Arturo meanwhile lifts all the way up to the top of the mountain - exits whatever this field is and drops down.

Thorin gets the hang of things and figures Francesc is the least robust, and seems to be just heading directly to the mountain - so he chases after her. Francesc ACRO 18 (via Luck) - she figures she can roll when she "hits" the mountain, sideways-on. At the very last second she has an amazing idea; cast a Wind Wall to cushion the blow. Thorin sees the remarkable sudden spell cast, the wall of wind and acrobatic roll. She gently spins and lands on her feet, dusting herself off as if nothing happened.

Thorin resolves to never tell a soul that he saw it!

Arturo has dropped back into the effect and, this time, he continues falling normally as his dragon flies in.

Penny hears the sounds of stomping and clanking and hears three Warforged heading towards her. She's down on the ground. She turns and starts running up the hill! That damned cave entrance is some 500ft up!

Francesc likewise has the same cave in mind. She's about 300ft up and starts running for it. **He doesn't know it, but the 'gravity effect' is making this feel like flat ground for her!**

Thorin sees the dragon heading skyward; Francesc is running up, apparently fine; Penny is down on the ground running up the mountain chased by Warforged! OK, well, he heads for Penny then...

Arturo gets caught by his dragon and makes a beeline for the cave. Now that the effect has been figured out, it's easy!

Getting close, Thorin can see that Penny is running "on flat ground" while from *his* perspective, he has to fly in some other direction as his sense of "up" is very different. He is within 100ft of Penny and the pursing Warforged. Claws out, he intends to grab Penny and lift her off the ground - a few seconds later he does it. Very quickly, Penny feels a sickening sensation as gravity "spins" when Thorin makes contact; she suddenly "hangs sideways". Thorin aims for the high cave.

Below, the Warforged have started climbing up the hill.

Francesc - on "flat, level ground"! - gets to the 10ft high, 8ft wide cave entrance first. It's a tunnel that goes in a fair distance while turning inwards. She waits at the entrance, but keeps looking into the tunnel, wary of anything that emerge. She is joined by Arturo too. Their relative ideas of "upright"  are at 90 degrees to one another! Moments later, Penny and Thorin arrive, but they have the other idea of "upright", comprising 270 degrees total. Arturo's perspective is "normal", while Francesc needs to *lower herself into it*; while Thorin (as himself) and Penny need to "walk on the walls". We don't know what we need to do to restore 'normal' gravity!

Penny lights the sword, but Arturo ends up in the lead, his spectral dragon squished in behind him, as it's much easier for him on the actual-ground. The tunnel opens up into a cavern, about 15ft high by 25ft wide. The area is littered with debris - armour, crates and more. It seems like it was used as a store a long time ago.

Following, Penny suddenly falls onto the ground with an undignified "CLANK". It seems the gravity effect fortunately does not extend too far inside.

(Thorin has followed last using Mould Earth to try and close up the outer tunnel mouth as best he can. There's a lot of loose rock and earth around there.)

Arturo sees several dead bodies along a wall that look as if they were dragged there and placed there - respectfully. They're just skeletons now. Full armour; blue and silver insignia. Investigating the crates he comes to the conclusion that this was originally some kind of armour storage room. There are also strange objects that to *our* eyes would look like massive bullets, some 3ft long. There are pallets of them, some complete, some with missing objects, presumably used.

Thorin realises he left his blanket back at the mage tower, over the vents that were releasing the poison gas - the acid was eating into it anyway. There are plenty of blankets here, stored in neat folded piles, so he takes one and packs it away.

There are three exit tunnels. One looks man-made rather than natural and we decide to choose that. Initially there are more stacked crates; about 300ft in, we see strange scratches on the wall, as if counting - an inventory? Arturo thinks maybe people got looped around by the strange effects here so makes his own marks, so that he'll know if we accidentally retrace our steps.

The tunnel begins to pitch downwards quite steeply and the ground becomes uneven. We figure we've investigated this one quite well and can come back if we must, so start to head back towards the main cavern to try another tunnel and investigate. Unfortunately, Thorin detects via Tremorsense scratching in the distance - we think the Warforged might be at the main entrance outside. So we go inside one of the natural tunnels that we think is in the right direction for Llandro and make haste!

(Thorin at least uses Mould Earth to try and make the ground difficult and less inviting at the entrance of this tunnel).

Initially the tunnel curves gently in a promising direction. Then we notice a trickle of water, almost a small stream *of quicksilver* that seems to run along one edge. It isn't so much running "down-from-an-up" as just running along the wall. Francesco perception 27 - it's flowing, and *seems to be aware of us*. It carries along the tunnel; we follow it. Another cavern. Lots of separate tunnels - four - lead away in different directions. The trickle seems to come from an upper tunnel.

Penny wonders if the "grey matter engine" is damaged and leaks? That's why this stuff seems "aware" of us? The tunnel that it comes from is quite high up and hard to get to, but Francesc has a go, hoping to drop a rope. ATHL, 14. She jumps up and *just* clings to the bottom edge, then scrambles up and manages to stand in this new tunnel. It's tight, about 6ft wide. To us below, we see a weird gravity effect - she leans out strangely and from her perspective the rope behaves oddly as she drops it. It doesn't "drop" out of the tunnel entrance; she has to kick it firmly to push it away and have it fall.

STR save from Francesc as Thorin starts to climb; 12; she is about to fall and lets go of the rope! Thorin uses Moonlight Step. Now there are *two* holding the rope - Arturo and Penny get in OK, though it's a bit of a squeeze for the two of us. The spectral dragon is asked to wait and guard the entrance way behind, that we came through *into* this tunnel.

It's strange seeing Arturo old, but also, he was blue for ages. So it's not so strange. He has thick red dreadlocks and a bit of a beard. As we walk, Penny checks to see if he's OK; 16; he's OK, so we assure him that he's OK and it can be magically reversed - **but he should perhaps not go to bed like this** - Penny arcana 10; no idea! Thorin figures Greater Restoration would sort it though.

We press on; the little trickle of quicksilver is moving, rippling near us, as if watching. We're sure it's aware of us.

Arturo stops. He talks to the quicksilver, saying we're going to help, and even takes the gem to show it! As he gets close, it seems that the quicksilver starts to defy gravity! It pushes up almost like a psuedopod, observing the crystal. Arturo puts the crystal within reach... The pesudopod touches the crystal but then pulls away, so Arturo touches it instead! INT save 16, with aura. He's OK, but takes 8 psychic damage. Whatever this is, it is a *very* powerful presence. It's not trying to hurt him, it's just jarring. He gets the sensation that it is neutral, curious, seems to be getting friendly? It invites us to come and see it, but warns that there are "security measures beyond its control" (as best Arturo can explain it - he just sees visions in his head, brief flashes).

**There is no doubt in Arturo's mind - this is Llandro!**

(End of act 2, part 11)
