# RIPA: Act 2 Part 36
## Session 82 (2026-02-03)
### Campaign Day 33, Acererak's Tomb, Oerth

We are in a fight!

Francesc is chasing the mage Wilim; ACRO check to try and slide-and-fire... with a Luck point ADV 8,16 vs DC 15 - it works. He has line-of-sight; he re-casts Hunter's Mark for the mage now and fires. First attack would hit, but he throws up a shield; but the next *definitely* hits; Francesc piles Stasis Strike on top. It deals 18 damage and he has to make a WIS save; he fails! He's temporarily restrained.

Now restrained, Wilim can't run. He's already got the Marileth going after him, so he uses Misty Step; he starts running, but he's got Hunter's Mark on him. He's now in the strange bridge room with the acid waves.

Debra tries to convince us to focus on the golem, not her. Thorin INS 22 - she thinks it just woke up and attacked, but doesn't know why; we suspect it's the stolen artefact that Wilim took.

Francesc wonders if Wilim has the rod; that's more important than the book, she thinks. Her slide-and-attack move means she's prone, but she just *runs on the walls* instead of standing upright to get around the Marilith chamber and sees him through the portal. Hunter's Mark told her:

* He is immune to being charmed & psychic damage
* No resistances

...so she fires, 24, hits; 25 damage with Stasis Strike again, but this time he makes his WIS save. She fires again, casting Ensnaring Strike this time, 23, hits; 17 damage; ADV STR save; it works. He's ensnared.

Marian asks Penny who she should attack; Penny says, "The stone golem's dangerous. She's right about that. And I've got *this* one" - looking at Debra. She throws Arcane Bursts; 2 of the 3 hit (and wouldn't have hurt Debra, as it happens) dealing an astonishing 57 damage in total! It's very badly damaged now.

Thorin-crab is "all-in on Debra" (IRL!) and she's cornered, unable to dodge easily, but also Marian attacked the golem so her guard is lowered... He has advantage with the pincers. 21 to hit; hits! 17 bludgeoning damage and she's grappled. She's surprised and angry; she uses Hellish Rebuke. DEX save with +5 from Penny, 18; halves the fire damage - 27->13. "I told you! I'm *not* the problem! Why are you so determined to see me fall?!" - but Thorin just doesn't trust her if he turns his back; 21 to hit; it works. He doesn't kill her, but she's unconscious. He also throws a Healing Word at Gundtach, healing for 25.

Gundtach, feeling much better, throws three spellfire busts at the Stone Golem. It only takes one of them to destroy it.

That basically ends combat, but we don't notice anything different in terms of time. Penny starts dashing out to find Francesc; as she passes through the library doors, she calls back while running, "How do I sound?!" - Thorin thinks it's normal and shouts back "Yep, sounds normal!" - and Penny hears it normally too. It seems that the time dilation effect was linked to the golem somehow.

Thorin turns back to himself. With Gundtach's help, they investigate; he starts with checking artefacts on Debra. Amongst other rolls, REL 15, no recognisable god to her but she's a devout paladin of *something*. He "confiscates" all the armour.

Separately, while tying and gagging Debra, Thorin PER 18; Gundtach is a dwarf, but he also has long, pointy ears. Something else is mixed in. He asks. Gundtach explains he's not from this world (neither are we!) - he explains more; he's come from a world that's a city, called **Ravnica**. Thorin HIS 18. He's heard about it but doesn't know much. It's an old plane, but so developed - according to the book he read - that it essentially really *is* just a huge city, covering almost the entire planet.

Thorin finds out that Gundtach's world was also taken by Vecna. He's here to try and find something that can help; despite the dangers, he knows there are powerful artefacts. He describes the 8-sided foggy portal room, picked one door and ended up trapped in the dark room where we, too, stumbled upon him.

Meanwhile, Wilim (after taking 5 points of damage) dispels the ensnarement. Then he Misty Steps once more, having made a DEX save (with a 16 against DC 15) for the effects of the wind/acid as he gets quite close; and starts running. Francesc chases; on the very edge of the acid bridge, she can *just* see him half-covered as he disappears around a corner; DEX save with luck point 25, she's OK against the winds; DISADV due to wind - 18 to hit - he throws a shield; miss; then 20,19->30; not a crit, but All The Things including Ensnaring Strike, along with Stasis Strike mean 27 damage. Makes the Stasis Strike save, fails the Ensnaring Strike save and is once again restrained.

"Fine. What do you want? You want the book?" "Yes!" He throws the book!

At the very last second Francesc thinks about the rod. She moves out of danger from the ledge and grasps it, hoping to see if Wilem has it. WIS save, only 11. She collapses unconscious! But just before, in a very brief flash, she saw a sunken-faced, glass-eyed lich staring at her. Acererak is *holding* it. And so it is that Penny runs through the portal, to see Francesc unconscious near the bridge.

Thorin remembers being told about the wealth of knowledge in this library; the time dilation effect is gone and the golem has been destroyed - so he starts to look. It's a series of *amazing* books. It does indeed seem like just about *anything* could be learned here! That said, he's worried that there might be trickery - e.g. picking a book causes the Golem to reanimate. Urth helps Thorin investigate. 21. Only one book is missing; every other book appears to be present. The shelves are full. If you read anything in this room, you lose time... He figures taking any book might result in time dilation, another golem and who knows what else.

Meanwhile Penny has found Francesc. Looking for Wilim, PER 15, she instead spots a glint of copper - the book! Penny pushes in 5hp from the pool to try and bring her up - and it works. "What the hell happened?" "I got him to drop the book. And I touched the rod we have to see if he had it and... He doesn't."

Well, we don't know how to get the book. Francesc suggests Bigby's Fist, that spell, or something. So she guards the area while Penny goes to the library. "Does anybody have Bigby's Fist?" - uuuuh.... Well Thorin is busy, so Urth comes with her and we return to Francesc. Penny helps Urth not fall into the acid trap while he uses Mage Hand to retrieve the book.

...Thorin has been getting *very* tempted by the library books...

On the way back, Penny is looking at the book. Lucky ARC role, 21 (Francesc, 4!) - a book containing magical mantra and practices about health and metabolism. It operates as a manual of bodily health. It's made of copper and brass. She realises it will infer significant benefits if read, but the whole thing must be read quickly. She thinks - oh yeah, Thorin *purchased* one of those.

Back in the library we are talking about what to do, when Marian screams! She's opened the other door, opposite from the double doors, similar to the one that leads to the room where we found Gundtach. And there's a hand visible at the threshold. Penny quickly drags the person into the library; her blindsight shows her that another person is in there too. Asking for both Guidance and Bardic from Urth, she goes in and (CON 19) successfully retrieves the second person. Two men, unconscious, badly hurt but alive.

We learn from Marian that the elf is Vogren and an Orc priest is Talo. Francesc uses her up-to-one-minute healing spell. 5 lots of 2d6 healing brings them right back up!

Thorin tries to 'rally the troops'. He talks about how we want to *end* this whole maze; take down Acererak. He wants their help. Urth tells the tale of the Marilith and Penny tries to help, with Francesc offering Guidance too - and the total is a remarkable **30**.

They agree - but want to rest first. The Marilith is friendly and, in the end, we manage to set up camp there. Urth listens to her story for again! It's a long rest - so Thorin decides to use Heroes Feast for *everyone*, and he talks to Gundtach too.

Penny goes to check on Debra... She'd probably have died; nasty injuries; but Thorin had used Spare The Dying. Urth watches her while Penny chats to Marian's party.

* Gundtach isn't eating anything, but when Thorin prepares the Heroes Feast, he has _enough_ to gain its benefits. Thorin PER 30 (!) (nat 20). He has small fangs! But he's not undead; he has a heartbeat, he does eat a *bit*, he has blood. And the healing magic that was cast on him didn't work a normal way; it didn't mend wounds; it sort of... Got unravelled into pure spellfire that he absorbed. An - **energy** vampire?! Thorin can't resist and quietly asks. ADV PER 19. He is a *Dhampir* (this is a secret which Thorin chooses to keep). He likes to party; Ravnica has crazy amazing clubs. But he partied with a vampire without realising. During the process of being turned he woke, fought the vampire and ended up only having *some* of the features of a vampire as a result. What's more, he can somehow manipulate "raw" spellfire, direct from the weave. Over time, he's lost his entire network and community on Ravnica - a whole district was completely wiped out by Vecna. He wants revenge, but doesn't know how. He came here solo.

* Penny chats to the three who were here. She asks why the new two arrivals were there; Marian she knows, but what about them? ADV PER 20. The group was put together by Talo. They specifically had to get Marian and Laysa because they were trying to fulfil something they'd read - it's believed that the treasure of the ancients is in this temple (and indeed, we've found three such pieces!) - but she doesn't know that there's a prophecy - the ones who will defeat Acereak and claim the prizes of the Tomb are a party of four; one who is righteous and holy, one who has mastered the arts of the arcane; one of the land; and an elf who has a close relationship with the holy and righteous one. And Talo's four, they felt, fit the bill. *We might have done* but without Arturo, we don't quite match that description anymore.



## Campaign Day 34

From our long rest, Thorin has kept up his spellcasting on the staff. He's been calling upon other druids for help and we realise that we must have underestimated where it was at - because at his final casting, it transforms! It twists and bends into a sort of shepherd's crook, surrounded by tiny vines and small white flowers. This is the **Desert Heart**. It certainly doesn't *look* like it is of Athas! Its powers, though, are very useful and from appearance alone, it's likely to be underestimated.

Penny eventually chooses to wake up Debra and pushes in 10hp from her pool, after the rest (so she has got her 75 back, dropping down to 65 in this act). We all have Heroic Inspo by this point. We give her some rations. She tries to persuade Debra to talk about the history in between the time we scryed them and now. Penny with heroic inspo INS 3,4+7->11, she isn't able to "read" much and determine truth from fiction, sadly. She says they made it off-world, fortunately; they were working with someone who warned them in time. They have continued working with that "party" and are seeking a device that they were instructed to find. They're aware that we are on *some* kind of mission that seems to often take us to the same places as them. Sometimes they're just behind us, sometimes just ahead. As to what it is? "None of your business! Suffice to say, we have lost enough people. People close to me have fallen; people under my protection. The adversaries we face are powerful indeed. We may even share a common enemy. So why you're so determined to see me come to a brutal end; that must surely be your pride and malice."

She does concede that she was effectively used by Wilim. "He has intentions of his own, such as reaching for that book."

Thorin, Urth and Francesc have started listening. Francesc INS 30, while Thorin uses a potion of mind-reading while Debra thinks. She's trying to avoid saying names but *thinks* them and Francesc realises she's omitting things deliberately. She thinks we have the same enemy, ultimately. They have an enemy too. But she's not the leader of her party and doesn't always know what Wilem's ultimate goal is. She's on a holy mission - believes in the prophecy. She thinks we don't fully trust each other either? Why would anyone. Everyone has their own agenda.

Thorin hears the name "Vallin" in Debra's mind as the person she's working for. And Vecna is the person she's working against.

We don't trust liches, Debra did. Or not; she points out she does *not* trust Wilem! But she's *sure* her party is that of the prophecy.

In the end we need to move on, but we leave Debra in the company of the Marilith; she's being guarded for a couple of days. We've left food and water. Maybe Wilem will be back this way. Penny is pretty sure we've not seen the last of her.

Finding some private space, we elect to re-use Find The Path via the Rod. Thorin tries it this time. CON save 27, no problem! Curiously, he gets more information than usual! A left (West) exit in the library is faster but more deadly; the East (right) is longer but safer.

Given that we expect to have a *very* significant fight with Acererak, we go for the safer option!

A corridor leads to a hexagonal room. A bridge has engraved, coloured limestone tiles, stretching between two ledges. On either side is a pitch black vortex of energy. Thorin immediately suspects that there might be something displayed in the room that gives clues about safe passage.
