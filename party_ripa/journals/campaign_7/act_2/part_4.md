# RIPA: Act 2, Part 4
## Session 50 (2024-10-08)
### Trade Gate, Sigil day 4; Sky Dock, mid-morning

We have just finished celebrating an uncharacteristically successful fight by Penny, in which a Githyanki custom has been honoured. The outcome is that we are trusted in our mission to recover not just the second rod segment from the wreck of the Lambent Zenith, but also all of its surviving crew to the very best of our ability - including the aforementioned Githyanki's mate.

So far, our party has kept information about the rod entirely secret. Only rescuing the crew has thus far been mentioned to those around us.

We intend to "set sail" on The Scarlet Arrow, accompanied by a wasp ship owned and piloted by a Thri-Keen under contract of two Hadozi who have an idol. The idol is believed to be made of the same material as a dead god called Havoc and, in an inevitable coincidence, we _think_ the remains of this same god form the "rock islands" we have seen around the Lambent Zenith's wreckage in our various rod-segment-driven visions. Our reasons for teaming up with this second ship, then, are a plan "B" - we have a necklace belonging to a crew member as one possible focus for our Helm of Teleportation; or if that fails, we can at least try to reach near to the God. Either way, we have to gather enough information to allow the navigators of the both ships to effect an appropriate influence upon the 'drift' of their vessels upon the Astral Sea.

Departure is tomorrow morning. We have a few hours of time. We have to figure out what we'll do.

* Penny will wait a bit, then see what the Githyanki meant by offering to help us. They're not coming along; do they have information? Navigation aids? Point her at a library?

* Arturo wants to practice fireballs.

* Thorin wants to broker a trade deal with the Hadozi for our part in assisting their search. Arturo agrees to lead those as he's the more persuasive. They'll need to negotiate with the two Hadozi and Thri-Keen, who is already being offered a share in the bounty.

* Francesc is intrigued and wants to observe!

Our angle is that the Helm lets us get directly to the location. The Hadozi argue that we must bring them along as we teleport while they "secure" the goods and we go back to get the ships. In return, they'll give us one share. Split four ways. Arturo argues that there's a wreckage of psychopath crew we want to rescue to get on their good side, and they should be giving us a share just because we'll protect them. Low rolls on persuasion but a huge modifier, total is 21. They counter-offer. If we protect them during scavenging they will give us an extra share. In response Thorin pushes even harder! He wants a 50:50 split; we'd have *three* shares.

OK, so, the Hadozi say they'll come with us to where the helm takes us. They want *some* assurance! Some kind of exchange - something to guarantee we won't just leave them stranded. *Then* they'll agree to 50:50 between their group and ours. Arturo makes up something about needing a totem to get back places... 28 deception... They shake on it. But we *must* give them the idol and we'll get the sword back, so we can return it to the Githyanki. We have to wait for that until ready for departure, to ensure nobody cheats.

Meanwhile, Penny is talking to the Githyanki. He can't help with navigation, it'd be more physical stuff; but she should talk to a navigator. She seeks out the Arrow navigator and they explain as best they can that the understanding of location and relative position just sort of "happens". It'll be enough to visit with the helm and come back, then describe what we _understood_ inately.

Later, we all regroup. Penny learns about the deal. She's concerned about that; now it's "god first, ship next". And time spent "protecting" the Hadozi. We'll have to be very careful with teleport charges. Thorin argues that he wants to use the necklace first anyway, as the idol has been separated from the god for years; certainly not within 6 months. Well that's OK, but - we'll have to make sure the Hadozi don't freak out when we land on the deck of the cutthroats!

In the remaining time, Thorin suggests we find out more about Havoc with our friendly local bookkeeper. We have some VERY high perception/investigation rolls - Arturo's exceeds 30 - and yet, no. Nothing. Nobody has heard of it.

Penny, Religion 22. Gods can die many ways. Solar agrees. Be forgotten, decay and petrify; or lose all followers but not be forgotten - just lost faith. And a god can be killed by other means. Violent means... But it is *possible* that the reason Havoc died was that *everyone* forgot about it, everywhere. This could be why we simply can't find information.

The day comes to an end with nothing much more eventful happening. We elect to convert our currency back to gold in advance of travel.

Before bed, Penny asks the question we've been avoiding - if all goes well, how do we get them to give us the rod? We know they have it and they treated it as if valuable, but do they know it's magical? If they touched it, even accidentally, they'd certainly have a good idea!

* Arturo might have to try and steal it
* Thorin suggests making their rescue contingent on giving up the rod

...if we simply can't be persuasive.

We go to bed. Luck D20 -> 3. Nothing much happens!



### Trade Gate, Sigil day 5

We are woken by someone knocking. Arturo asks who it is - someone from Tomoko's ship. Arturo recognises the voice and we hasten to get up, pack and leave. Standing outside the door is a short-haired young man carrying a chest. He leads the way up to the Sky Dock and The Scarlet Arrow. The Thri-Keen and Tomoko are talking to each other on the walkway and the Harbour Master is present - looks like everyone is up to speed.

Walking up the gang way is the gith. He's come for his sword. Thorin is muttering about spells for ages - "For fuck's sake" says Penny, grabs the idol from him, gives it to the Hadozi, who return the sword. It's given to the Githyanki; we board the Arrow; and quick as a flash it starts departure. We watch from the top deck. The ship glides out from the pier slowly, then sails are unfurled and the speed picks up. Off to our side, a buzzing noise starts as the wasp ship, wings beating rapidly, comes up alongside. We can see into the cockpit with two Hadozi giving us the thumb's up!

Tomoko calls out, "Everyone, get settled in. All hands within the ship. No loose clothing or scarves or rope! If you have long hair pease tuck it in, just in case." Speed increases dramatically, as does height - it's almost dizzying to look down. We're heading for a portal to the Astral Sea.

Tomoko insists we safely stay on board! It would be very difficult to get us back once through. The wasp ship is keeping *very* close, to the extent that some of the Arrow's crew are a bit nervous. Tomoko is confident in the other captain, though.

Tomoko disappears into a navigation room. Suddenly, up a head, a classic circular portal, a whirlpool of colour, appears. There's a very strange dilation effect, as if we're catching up with the front of the ship; a sensation of pushing through jelly but also stretching; and then - as if a stretched rubber band was let go - we are in...

...a totally featureless silver void. CON saves all round.

* Francesc 8 - doesn't throw up, but thinks she needs to lie face down on the deck, as that feels like "up".
* Penny 9 - almost joins Francesc on the deck. In her case she's hanging onto the wooden railing at the side as if she'd "fall" sideways otherwise.
* Arturo 13 - he lurches sideways a bit, leaning as if off balance, but not weightless.
* Thorin 17 - he's fine. The ship's deck is clearly "down". Simple.

The navigation room door opens. People suppress chuckles until Tomoko insists the crew help us figure out which way is "up". The deck is "down". If we fall overboard, we can fly back by treating the ship as "down" and "flying for down".

Tomoko invites us below decks, to our quarters. For now, we have a state room. Two such rooms have four beds, two have sixteen. A four bed room is fine.

Arturo suggests we don't waste time and use the Helm to teleport. We need to get the Hadozi on board. Tomoko decides to treat us to a new experience! She leads us back up to the main deck, stand on the rail and step off - with a kind of forwards roll for flourish. They can float up and back and pretend to swim (!) to make the point that it's not really flying, it's more thinking.

We are invited to copy, and we do. INT check.

* Arturo 3 - troublesome!
* Francesc 5 - troublesome also!
* Penny 12 - unsteady, but manages to get a rough idea of how to move the right way.
* Thorin 18 - no problem.

Penny shouts out encouraging things about just "thinking" about wanting to go to the wasp ship and it _should_ happen. It does take a while, but Arturo and Francesc eventually get the hang of it. INT appears to determine speed. Our group is quite fast, 3x INT in feet - so Penny's moving at 57!

She gets close and realises she's entering the strange "bubble" of gravity and air that she now realises we'd departed from the Arrow - which is part of what made it so disorientating initially. Thorin and Francesc, with very high passive perception, suddenly realise they haven't breathed this whole time - there's no air to breathe but also, very strangely, no instinct to do so.

Penny clambers around to the cockpit window where the Hadozi were looking and gestures at them to exit. They point downwards and we remember the gangway entrance down there. CON saves again - as he moves downwards, gravity suddenly inverts as we cross the median!

* Arturo 22
* Thorin 20
* Francesc 16 - all OK above
* Penny 13 - surprised but recovers after some clumsy movements

We are beckoned inside and squeeze inside - it's a tight fit with all of us in there! "All right" say the Hadozi. "WHat now?" - we need something from the ship. Penny asks the captain what might "belong" in this ship. "Look in the tool box!" There's something the Hadozi say is called a "wrench". We take that, to use as the helm focus to return. Penny shouts up, "I don't know how long it'll take... Hopefully not long? Not even sure how time works here!"

Arturo meanwhile is sneaking in a screwdriver, too. He doesn't tell the rest of us. SOH 7! THe Hadozi see immediately. "We ned this too!" he says - "Backup!" It takes some convincing (their insight was nat 20!) but they decide to leave the idol behind, since Penny mentions that the Captain is still here and wouldn't abandon her share.

Over to Francesc. We all hold hands. She gets the helm and the necklace, and casts.

A lens shape appears in front of us; a tear. This expands and engulfs us. It's *totally* different from our normal check. More CON saves.

* Thorin 33
* Arturo 27
* Penny 14
* Francesc 8

...so Penny d8->2, Francesc d8->7. We all feel this strange sensation of extremely fast movement, then *slamming* into something. Arturo and Thorin are stopped dead, right next to each other, holding the Hadozi hands. But Penny and Francesc aren't there. The four are staring at the full technicolour kaleidoscope of red and orange, bleeding out from a really, really confusing view in front.

Francesc sees the four of them some 150ft away. Penny sees them about 100ft away; Francesc 200ft away in a different direction. We're free-floating. Penny starts to head towards Francesc, as she can fly quickly.

Thorin looks around. The Hadozi stare, agape. Thorin perception 15. The mass of "bleeding ink" seems to come of some gigantic mass, hard to understand in scale, maybe some 1500ft long? Made of disembodied bits of flesh, calcification... It is mostly not rock, though. It looks more like rotting meat! Admist this mass, parts of a ship. 5-600ft away, embedded to the closest part, is the stern of a blue and gold ship with a broken tall mast, tattered golden sail. 800-900ft to the next - seems to have a large oak tree growing out of it?! - and far away, over 1000ft, are arcing, stone ribs, 150ft high maybe, enclosing another bit of ship with a broken mast and golden sail. It looks like the bow is embedded into the mass.

We regroup. The Hadozi can chip at the calcified sections if they want it! We're going to start at the closest area - the stern - as the crew may have regrouped in a particular single section. Thorin and Arturo encourage the Hadozi to not reveal the value of the material; "just say it's medicinal!" says Arturo.

We get close to a "putrid flesh" section. No smell; it's not fleshy, actually; more like coral. Arturo tries to break a bit off. He tries a Firebolt for that. It doesn't look right! A kind of pebble of flame that flies out but, on hitting, it sort of flickers and dies rather than exploding. It *does* knock off a tiny chunk. As he takes it, it cuts him very slightly. It's very sharp. It does seem mineral in nature.

Thorin asks to look. Penny shouts over her shoulder "stop playing with the toys!" but perception is nat 1 + 2 -> 3, no idea where she's going really. Francesc, Perception with disadvantage; 18. This means she spots the danger! Two large creatures are following us. They've appeared from behind some of the floating debris...

Initiative!

* Thorin 20
* Francesc 15
* Penny 15
* Arturo 14

...and Thorin is busy examining the rock, unaware of the danger. It *is* a bit like coral. It feels like it hasn't compacted down yet, so it seems brittle. It is mineral, but there seems to be some substance in between the pores - star dust?! - that hasn't solidified. It probably eventually solidifies down into the material the the idol is made of. The "calcified" sections he's seen.

Francesc has yelled out a warning and is looking at a now-quite-close "Star Angler". WIS save... 11. It has some kind of lure dangling in front which flares with a warm, inviting, soft glow. She feels compelled to move towards it. We all sese its mouth opening wide... All Francesc sees is a lantern from the outside of her family house, being raised by her mother, inviting her in for dinner. Three bite attacks! 17, 25 - hits - 12 damage; next has DISADV due to a special feature; 22,20->20->matches AC, 9 more damage, 21 total.

At least she wasn't surprised by the creature's overall appearance! She gets to try WIS again; it works; now she knows she's been bitten. Sharpshooter means point-blank shooting is an option. Hunter's Mark is brought up - it has no resistances - she fires. 22, hits; 17 damage (taken in full). 22 again, hits; all the toys and some very high rolls - 26 more! She risks an opportunity attack and flies back a bit; luckily, its opportunity attack misses.

Penny is surprised; her turn passes; she catches up. Arturo likewise.

The other lantern now flares up, at a close by Hadozi. He starts to move; the fish gets close and tries its bites - there's nothing we can do. It gets two hits; the Hadozi doesn't go down, but freaks out and tries to run away, then getting bitten on the escape attempt. The other "runs" to try and help.

Thorin drops L5 Moonbeam onto that second Star Angler, moves up close and Wildshapes into a giant constrictor snake. The other Star Angler keeps up its chase on Francesc and attacks three times again. The first misses; the second misses; the third does hit, dealing 17 damage. She does not succumb to the lure this time. She retaliates; 32 to hit (!), for a big 26 damage. Second attack 19, hits, 16 more; throws more damage onto the 30ft-away other one, 6 more for that; plus a Statis Strike on the closest, 6 more - and needs a WIS save, DC16, or be restrained - but it makes the save.

Penny hands-on heals the injured Hadozi. 21 out of 42 restored. Then she moves behind the Star Angler that Francesc is on, moving behind it, activates the Sun sword and readies herself to defend and strike.

Arturo brings up a Draconic Spirit which deals and is resistant to Force damage; it appears next to Francesc, flanking with Penny. It doesn't use its breath weapon first but instead gets in two hits, 23 force damage. It's just hanging on! Now it flies up, since we're in a 3D space (!) and uses the breath weapon directly down - avoiding hitting allies by its close proximity and the narrow part of the cone. It fails to dodge anything; 9 damage, but still up somehow.

The other Star Angler attacks Thorin snake. Its first attack misses; next misses too; third, though, decisively hits for 10 piercing damage. Then it tries its charm effect again; WIS save; 23 - no problem! It slips sideways, dodging the moonbeam effect. Thorin elects to move the Moonbeam effect; DC17 CON save - it fails and takes a huge 30 damage.

The heavily injured Star Angler surrounded by our group still tries to attack Francesc, as it smells blood... 24 hits, and would do 10 damage but Penny reacts to reduce it by 1d10+4 -> 8. The second hits too, though, for a more substantial 19 damage - but the 3rd attack fortunately misses. It tries to charm Penny now! WIS save 18 (7+11) - it doesn't work - and it tries to escape. Francesc tries an opportunity attack, which just barely hits... Her arrow is aimed directly at the lure but as it is turning this means the arrow continues right through it's scull. It's dead.

Francesc moves her Hunter's Mark to the remaining Star Angler and fires - crit fail. Second attack; 21, hits, for a coincidental 21 damage.

Penny flanks and attacks with the sword. Hit, 10 damage; hit again; 15 damage. Arturo uses a Firebolt for 17 damage. Now the dragon goes in; hit, hit. 24 damage - it's ripped apart!

Battle over. Penny heals Francesc for 20. The Hadozi pluck up courage and approach one of the dead fish; one severs the "lamp" and bags it.

Thorin, perception 16. Doesn't seem to be anything else coming. Francesc neither.

We get back on track and head for the nearest section of the ship - the stern. The Hadozi aren't sure if they should stick with us or not. They disagree about where to mine and one is sure they'll be attacked! Arturo offers to let the spirit dragon hang around - hope on it and fly back to us if anything is attacked. That does it!

We get back on track. Thorin elects to stay in giant snake form - that'll be rather scary! There's a big "O" ring kind of area that we have to pass through. As Thorin gets through that he feels underneath him. Looking down, he sees - standing astride the strange coral-like mess near the ship - two fierce Githyanki, attacking him with swords... 13 and 11 damage, radiant. Penny shouts down "Oh bugger off, he's with us! We've come to rescue you! And we particularly want to find **Zastra**! Their creche mate **(name)** wants to find them!" - ADV persuasion, 23.

The female of the two spins around. "How dare you utter that name! Who are you? *Who* are you?!" - they look ragged. Haggard, almost; feral. L1 Healing Word on the male doesn't help. So she shouts down, "We are the advance of a rescue party. The ship The Scarlett Arrow is on its way to rescue the crew."

It's super tense. They back away down to the deck of the ruined stern section, which is partly embedded in the god's remains, in a defensive posture, fully armed. Penny suggests Arturo talk them down - she'll assist. He tries to give ship names, descriptions, how we got to know the Githyanki names, the necklace of the other crew member and *that* person's name - all that stuff. ADV persusasion 32!

At least this stops them immediately attacking. They take a step back. One lowers their sword. The other even sheathes theirs. "You? *You* have come to rescue us? How did you know we were here? What is the story?"

Arturo tries to bluff. Penny decides to tell the truth. She metions the powerful magic artefact; that's how come we knew they were here. The sword is drawn again!

"I knew it. You're just another person who wants the rod. We have defended it with our lives this whole time. You are *not* getting it."

There is more to and fro, but it's escalating things. Thorin insight 28, realises that the more confrontational we are, the more they are. He tries to mediate and calm things down. Suggests we meet with the captain. Arturo adds that we won't take even one step forward, we'll wait right here until the captain arrives. But Thorin notices that they're constantly looking around. On high alert, always.

"We can also help defend against what is obviously out here - we just took down a couple of Star Anglers."

"Why have you brought scavengers?"

"They helped us with passage" (says Penny)

"Do you speak for them?"

Arturo says yes. Penny adds, "But we don't exactly trust them. We're keeping a close eye on them."

This might be working, but one thing is clear - they will **absolutely not** let us take the rod. Any attempt would result in battle. We are at least permitted to "land on deck" but "none of us can reach Inda". "Why not?" asks Penny. "She's over there!" - they point at the bow section, furthest away, ploughed bow-inwards to under the rib cage area.

It transpires that the whole area is infested with creatures that stop anyone from trying to move between sections of the ship. They're all pinned down and must remain ever-vigilant. And we learn, too, that they've had visitors who've tried to board the ship. The only thing stopping them is the Githyanki.

We claim we might be able to get there - but they laugh heartily. "Have you *tried* any form of teleportation *since* you arrived?"

Oh dear. "Try it! Try any teleportation."

Francesc asks "does Misty Step count?" Yeah. It does. Arturo can do that. He is worried but they don't look malicious - if anything they look hopeless. Arturo tries. D6->1. He disappears, then reappears in a room that looks like some kind of kitchen. Someone down there is surprised, jumps back and starts waving a knife. A large female orc! Ah! The one! Arturo immediately shows the necklace. *That* is a surprising conversation!

Up above we can hear muffled speech; Penny shouts down "Are you down *there*?" to the deck; Arturo can hear. The half-orc meanwhile asks for the necklace and takes it. Arturo explains - in his usual rather edited form. But he has to excuse himself - our friends are in the middle of not trying to get killed by the Githyanki! - at this she shouts, "Come with me!" - and runs up, Arturo close behind. Up above we see the door flung open. She grabs the shoulders of the two. "Lysan! Zastra! I told you to come and get me if rescuers arrived".

Kycera also looks haggard. As there is to-and-fro, which mostly leads to general lack of trust, but the TL;DR - they're all exhausted; the last time they tried to sleep *space clowns* (!?) attacked them; a skiff crashed into part of the ship but they got attacked when they tried to help; a tree appeared... Now **Daveras** is here.

**We learn that at least one of the other groups who tried to take the rod was our rivals! Their mage wasn't the lich but the others match.**

Persuasion ADV 27 from Arturo. Kycera is convinced, though she's not sure why. "I think that they mean well and their hearts are in the right place. That still doesn't help us, because we still - we're never going to get Ilwyn to agree. And Figaro has totally lost his mind! He's locked himself in the state room and he's the only one know hows how to disable the safety field around the front of the ship. Even if we could get there, we would probably get killed trying to in there. And I'm pretty sure Inda is in there" - Penny interjects, "She is in there and she is alive" "- Well we could *try* teleporting in there but it is really risky."

Penny points out that, rod or not, she is honour-bound to rescue the female Githyanki. And of course, we are here to rescue at leasy Kycera too.

At that point, a haggard-looking elf, a sort of hippie-vibe, hobbles up the stairs. Sees us - Thorin as a giant snake - but immediately speaks in Druidic. So there's an understanding at that point.

IRL we stop here, to reconvene in 2 weeks.

(End of act 2, part 4)
