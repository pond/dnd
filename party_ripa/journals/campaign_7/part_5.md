# RIPA: Part 5
## Session 5 (2023-05-09)
### Day 4, 7am

We're in a clearing. There's been a strange experience with a gem dragon; we have acquired new skills and knowledge, by strange means. Penny and Thorin had a particularly strange trip; Arturo and Frances saw what really happened.

Cassee is distraught. "No! No, no no... This has *not* happened..."

Penny goes... "Wow. That was amazing. Look! It's cute!"

Cassee responds, "Not really..." - Francesc (nature 19) understands Cassee's worry; the birth of a dragon is "broadcast" in a quasi-spiritual way. Other beings sensitive to such things will be aware that it happened. Francesc warns us.

Arturo walks up to the dragon and says "Happy birthday!" in draconic, giving it scritches. It lifts its head, yawns and stretches. It opens its eyes. Not at all surprised to see us. It recognises us. Arturo offers it a potato; sniffs; ignores it.

Cassee is concerned that due to its neutrality, creatures of either good or evil might try to steal it and have it align with their wishes. She can't really form coherent sentences! Penny walks up, holds her shoulder - "Don't worry. You're not alone. We'll figure this out" - and casts Heroism. Cassee was conflicted academically about what'd gone wrong & the meaning - the consequences - of a dragon being hatched.

She takes a breath. "OK. OK. One thing at a time... It's happened. Too late to turn that back." Francesc, "It was going to happen sooner or later anyway." "Hmm. Well. First of all, I was right! This is an emerald dragon. So - two things. First... We need to keep this quiet and hidden. We have *some* time, but probably not *that* long until people triangulate where this is. We'll have to start moving or we'll bring danger to this town. Second, we can't look after this dragon unless any of you have acquired skills related to the training and teaching of dragons."

Francesc confirms that the *initial* "pulse" when the dragon was born is a one-off, but once we move, there's no 'signal' that might help enemies track it. Arturo suggests finding friendly neighbour hood druids in the woods - the red panda and so-on. Maybe they can help. Cassee might be able to contact people, who via slower means could help - but that might take too long.

And then there's the manor on Oak Street and the missing kids.

We figure we can take the cart (with dragon and Cassee, Thorin potentially hiding under the tarp) close to the manor. Arturo can scout out a stealthy entrance while Penny distracts at the front door. We have to ride the cart right through the town centre; Thorin will cast PWAT closer in so we have better stealth while Penny distracts. He'll wildshape shortly after.

It's on. We ride in. A commotion outside the museum! The equivalent of police cars and tape - lots of people, guards and makeshift wooden barriers. A well-dressed older woman stands, exasperated, on the front steps talking to the authorities as two workers head either side to take down the "grand opening" banners `:-(`

We try to kinda sneak past (!) in the cart. With PWAT cast, we all get +10, so even Penny (disadv stealth, 6-1+10 -> 15) manages to pass. We need somewhere to hide it, at the base of the Oak Street hill. Penny survival 10, Francesc 19; she finds a space where the wagon could be parked off-street. She wants to reverse it in! Adv animal handling with help from Penny, 17; it fits, but the parking isn't great! A bit of a scrape on the side of the wagon.

OK, so Arturo & wildshape Thorin - a spider: Stealth in. Francesc: On watch with the wagon (Cassee and dragon hidden in the back). Penny: In front, selling the religion of Meliki!

Up close, we realise "manor" is a rather severe exaggeration. It might've at least been passably tidy with a certain air of grandeur back in its heyday when the town here was much smaller, but today, it's really just a small, rather run-down cottage.

Arturo tries to choose a path that keeps away from windows on approach, while Penny goes for an external door about as far from Arturo as she can manage. Penny knocks. Groaning from inside. A chair being pulled back; the door opens, just a crack. It's a dark-haired, darker-skinned woman, maybe middle-aged. She looks stout and well built, wearing armour. "What is it?!" and Penny - persusasion 19+6->25! - launches into a sales pitch for the benfits of worshipping Meliki. It's not enough to quite win them over - they're not just going to start worshipping straight away! - but she certainly has their attention. In fact, a theological debate ensues, Penny being challenged by the person indoors.

Arturo hears the knock and door opening, and makes his way to the back, trying to keep away from most doors and windows. He tries to peek into windows; curtains are drawn. He tries to gently open a window - it opens outwards in two hinged panes. Arturo helps spider Thorin down; Thorin sneaks past the curtains.

It smells in here! Snoring. The room is dark. Someone is sleeping here. He examines the room; perception 12. Someone in the bed. Oh! Hello - it's a cat. Thorin climbs up the wall, to try and get out of range. The cat swipes, but spider Thorin avoids it and gets out of range. The cat sits, watching; it starts to wash its paws out of frustration.

The room is small, a rucksack on the floor and some dirty clothes on the end of the bed. The person asleep is male and quite large. Armour rests on the only chair in the room. There's one internal door, currently closed.

Thorin tries to climb up and over the room ceiling, towards the internal door hoping for a crack or keyhole it might squeeze through. Getting close, it's clear that the house isn't well built. There's a decent size gap between door and frame at the top; Thorin can squeeze through.

About 1 minute has passed. Penny and the woman in the front are deep in debate. Arturo gets restless and goes to check another window. He has to get over the outside wall; he scrambles up onto it, then lowers himself down the other side, eschewing a vault for fear of a noisy landing, or the gate for fear of squeaky hinges! Stealth, still within PWAT range - no footprints - 27! No problems at all. This appears to be a second bedroom. Curtains are open but the window is grimy; a table, a chair, a small bed that's unmade and a door open into the rest of the house.

Thorin sees the main room. A table, chairs, some weaponry leaning against funiture; the woman and Penny at the door. There's a writing desk near a fireplace and a pantry or larder kind of set of small shelves near a sink. There's also another small internal door, closed.

It's been about 2 minutes. Penny is still arguing. The other woman seems to be thinking she's getting the theological upper hand...

Arturo assumes nothing bad in the room Thorin was in since Thorin never reappeared or otherwise indicated some kind of distress. Instead of proceeding inside, he looks across the small courtyard to a small storage shed and investigates. Somewhat surprisingly given its condition and the lack of anything much of value seen so far, the shed is locked.

Thorin checks the last door internally. Small store room. Nothing suspicious. It seems to just be the two inside. Back in the main room, the guy has got up and opened the door; the cat runs towards Thorin spider. "Get a load of this!" shouts the woman over her shoulder. "What're you doing?" shouts the man to Penny - "on a Saturday morning? Decent people tryin' to sleep!" "Ah, well, the work of religion never sleeps, Meliki's work is always ongoing" calls Penny. "Meliki? Never heard of him!" "Ah! Well! Let me explain..." - and so it goes on.

Thorin returns to one of the bedrooms and climbs onto a pillow. He turns back into himself, intending to signal to Arturo somehow.

Arturo meanwhile is trying to get into the shed. He sees a window and looks inside. Very grimy; muddy-looking window; dark, but crates and boxes and bags are visible. Some of the bags - can't be too sure but they look similar to the animal parts bags. Misty Step! Arturo is inside now. It seems that the window can be opened from the inside but the door is locked. It'd need a degree of acrobatics ability to wriggle out through it.

Arturo looks for any kind of evidence that the missing girls might've been through here. Paperwork, belongings, anything really... Investigation for evidence, or insight for "anything unusual" - dirty 20 on investigation. There's a fair bit of traffic in here, that is, the shed is used often. Recent footprints. Many lead to a long bench, but the footsteps don't stop in front of the bench. They appear to go *under* it. Arturo looks under, for a trap door or similar. But the bench has drawers and cupboards - a cabinet - it's not easy to see below.

Arturo tries opening doors & cupboards. One is fake! It doesn't pull out. He tries to tug, and instead, it rotates. This makes the whole thing slide into the middle of the room!

There's a set of stairs down.

Thinking quickly, Arturo casts Minor Illusion, some 30ft in the air - it's an arrow pointing down. He recasts a few times so it dances and moves to catch attention.

Back at the cart, Francesc is having to "manage" Cassee. She's constantly talking over and over about different options, interrupting *herself* - Francesc after a while is trying to avoid eye-contact for fear of encouraging more! And, perception 22 - suddenly she sees a big flashing arrow above a shed. Not the stealth mission she'd expected! "These clowns have either found something or have got themselves into trouble" she thinks. "Cassee! Do NOT go anywhere with that dragon!" she inists. "I'll *know* where it is" (L3 Francesc can sense dragons within 6 miles). Intimidation 9.

Thorin, meanwhile, is standing on a bed - jumps into the room and tries L2 Charm Person, trying for both of the house dwellers.

The half-asleep guy is successfully charmed... And, with a 13 wisdom save on a DC14 spell, so is the woman. **It's worked again!**

Francesc arrives at the shed; she looks in the window and sees Arturo inside - he whispers "come inside" "where's the door?" "use the window!" "what?!" - Francesc acrobatics 2+5. She swears she used to be slimmer... Francesc tries to force it open wider, with Arturo's help. Strength, adv. - only 11! It doesn't budge.

At the door, Penny sees Thorin suddenly appear inside and the woman she's talking to stops mid-sentence and turns around to face him as he appears to cast a spell; it's familiar from the museum. Thorin chats to them instead. They say, "Well, we're stationed here. To protect the entrancts" - Thorin tries to convince them we've been sent by HQ. "Oh! So you want to get to the stairs?" Penny says "Yes please!"

And so it is, as Arturo and Francesc are trying to force open the window, they hear a key in the lock. He wants to try and close the window behind him but it doesn't close fully after being twisted by their efforts, so he just runs down stairs - but it's dark; he is forced to cast Light. Francesc flattens herself against the shed wall.

Arturo perception 12. In the panic of the moment he doesn't see a lever that would move the bench back into place. Just stone walls either side of stairs...

...the door opens. "Woah! What's going on? Someone's been in here!" calls the woman, seeing the moved bench - and a light shining up from a slightly-paniced Arturo at the bottom of the stairs. Penny tries, "You see! *This* is why we were sent. These are our associates - we knew the security wasn't good enough." Francesc, hearing this, strides in - "The security here is a joke! The window was wide open, I could've gotten in easily! Arturo goes with it.

Adv deception all round. Arturo and Penny (nat 20, woo) roll 24; that's enough without any others being involved. The Charmed people are convinced. They can't tell us what's down the stairs; Arturo convinces them that they need to go and apologise to the person in charge; they
get freaked out; we say we might be able to smooth things over for them; *we* report to Vallin obviously, who do they report to? At this, they look astonished. "You report to Vallin?!" - the  guy shouts, "I did *not* sign up for this!" and runs back to the house. The woman follows. The guy gets dressed hastily, dons a backpack and runs off. The woman follows suit, cursing. "Look, friend" she says, "Put a good word in for us, alright! We just get told to man the house. Make it look like people live here. Smooth it over with the neighbours when children get brought in" - and that would be that; within 55 minutes or so, they'll no longer be charmed.

But Francesc hears the bit about the kids. She knows they were being kidnapped.

**That won't stand.** Francesc raises the bow and fires at her, nearly at point-blank range. 21 to hit (with advantage from surprise). Penny sees something extraodinary; *slugs* - some kind of spirit slugs! - seem to appear out from her armour, apparently and then fly out with the arrow to add to the strike - 13 damage; the woman drops like a stone. Francesc now runs out to go after the guy, with Guidance (PWAT dropping) from Thorin. Hits again. 11 damage. That's another hit. Penny helps her bring the body back inside.

Penny and Francesc start looking for a way to get down the stairs while Thorin argues that we should just rest up! He changes tack and argues that we could wait for him to ritual-cast Detect Magic. Fair enough. Instead, Penny and Francesc do a good job of burying the bodies.

Thorin and Francesc lead the way down (dark vision), Arturo (still with Light) and Penny behind. After a surprisingly large number of stairs - 40ft or so descent? - it opens out, after being somewhat claustrophobic into a cold, slightly damp-smelling cavern. Rough rock walls give the impression of being dug out by *something* but it's certainly not built/crafted. There's an area of ground that looks most frequently used. Thorin 21, Francesc 23 survival; the most well-trodden leads to the right. We head that way.

There's debris... Even old bones. People? People that perished? Francesc also recognises *really* thick cobwebs. Up ahead, it looks like another cavern with some soft light; bioluminescent perhaps. A cavern to the right has lesser footfall. There's a slighy rotting smell; we guess that maybe it's storage, but want to check it out in case something bad flanks us from behind. Inside, rolled up in cobwebs, are mostly-devoured animals. We wonder if they were hunting animals to feed giant spiders! These things are very dead - decomposing. No rescue here.

We return to the well-trodden path into the dim light cavern. The bioluminescence turns out to be actually small, floating balls of light. Thorin notes from Detect Magic that they're magical.

Ahead, is some kind of building. Steps lead up to closed double doors that look like they might be thick hardwood, but with brass plate. No windows. It looks like it has been built of solid stone; old, but polished stone walls. Thorin - adv history to figure out age - 19. He thinks it's a few hundred years old; older than the village above. The doors have carved insignia that looks like two almond-shaped eyes, a long tongue that sticks out then wraps around the head and 8 bat-like wings coming out from all angles. Around chest height, all around the building, inscriptions are carved.

Penny approaches first, Arturo close behind. The inscriptions aren't in a language any of us recognise. Penny, religion 19-1->18. At least the *kind* of script and iconography are familiar. It's not specifically demonic, but it's linked to ancient cults of undead. She asks Thorin if there's any magic on the door; none. Remants / traces of previously cast magic but nothing much active now. She walks up to the door - as Arturo casts Bless on everyone else. "Oh great fairy, let's fuck them up" he announces!

Penny, perception 15+2. There's movement behind the door. Speaking, in a high pitched, slightly-squeaky female voice; a humanoid language, but one she doesn't understand. A gruff lower voice answers. Penny freezes and signals to the group. Francesc creeps up to have a listen too. Perception 19. Hears the gruff voice. "We're waiting. We're waiting for the signal, right?" The squeaky voice in a heavy accent, in Common; "I'm bored. We've been here longer than we're supposed to. Why hasn't anyone brought down any good?" There's then a third voice, faint, almost whispering, female; "Shut the fuck up. I'm so bored of you."

Ah! We retreat into a huddle. We can pretend to bring food. Arturo says he'll *impersonate* the voice of the man from upstairs via Minor Illusion to try and draw them out - and then we'll attack. Penny - after saying "at least try to capture *one* of them alive for questioning!" - and Thorin flank the door. Francesc retreats and readies an arrow; Arturo readies Burning Hands as we hear the squeaky voice shout, "Todd! Get the door!"

The door opens. Arturo very quickly checks to make sure there are no children present! Perception check is too low to be sure. "Todd" blocks the view, as the door is opened inwards; he wears armour. Arturo lets loose with Burning Hands. DC14 dex save, 15ft cone from about 5ft back. In practice it only affects Todd; he takes 10 damage.

Initiative:

* Arturo 20
* Thorin 17
* Francesc 9
* Penny 3

Todd's hair and cape are aflame; the metal on the door glows hot and as Todd staggers back it's flung wide open. Arturo swiftly casts L1 Sleep, aiming kind of behind Todd to hedge his bets on hitting anyone in the room but avoid our own party. 5d8 -> 1,1,1,3,4 -> only 10! Nobody falls asleep. Arturo flees as a voice from inside shouts, "What the fuck is going on out there?!"

Thorin activates his staff and runs up to Todd, intending to strike; perception 12. Nothing to see here! Attack 21, hits, max 12 damage. Thorin and Frances then see that a small halfling female has run up behind Todd. A voice shouts, "That's definitely not good delivery! I'm hungry and angry and we're under attack. This is the *worst* day of my life" - and attacks, with some kind of strange blueish-purple pulse flying out like visual soundwaves towards him. Thorin manages to dodge them both though. Arcana 6; he's no idea what they are. Suddenly Thorin shouts, "The halfing is an illusion!" - Detect Magic at work. It seems to be a displacement of a real person to him.

Francesc shoots the only *real* target she can see. Todd only looks mildly injured after 22 damage. Hunter's Mark. 18+9 to hit! Oh yes, that does it. Once again, Penny sees strange slugs speeding out towards them too. 19 damage total, right in the face! Ouch. He's fairly messed up by it.

Todd finally has a moment to take stock and retaliate. He sees Thorin closest and attacks twice with a longsword. 20 to hit and crit miss; the hit does 1d10+3->9 damage. Thorin reacts with Gift Of The Gem Dragon. He makes his save, so isn't pushed back but still takes 5 more damage. Suddenly, Todd pulls out a shortsword and tries an offhand attack! It hits, for 1d6->3 damage.

Penny goes for Todd too. Via inspiration she gets her hit, for a max 10 damage (no spell slots left for Divine Smite). She also holds her holy symbol, utters a prayer and gets back a spell slot (Harness Divine Power).

Arturo has trouble seeing Todd (half-cover) and might hit the party but risks an attack anyway, with Firebolt. 19 just hits! Damage is 3... But astonishingly, that's all it takes. Todd falls. Arturo barely has time to celebrate before a glob of sticky web lands just *next* to him, from above and behind him.

Thorin immediately - perception 22 - spots the spiders, up on the roof. One is roughly above Arturo, the above roughly above Francesc. Thorin calls out warnings! He wildshapes into a brown bear and having pushed more into the room, can see the *real* halfling caster - he charges. As he does so, he feels a strange stab in his side; someone inside the door, hiding in shadows (a rogue), has struck for 8 piercing damage and 8 sneak damage. Undeterred, Thorin continues to attack the halfling. He has two attacks and both hit; 1d8+4->7 damage for the bite, 2d6+4->15 slashing. The halfling is very surprised - "How do you know I'm here?" - and for the rest of us, her illusion now falls completely.

She responds with a release of some kind of blast of mental energy against the bear, twice; both hit. 13 psychic damage from the first, 15 from the next - he drops back into Thorin form, 10 points of damage rolling over. He has 10hp left. Thorin tries his second and last gem dragon reprisal; she fails her save; 11 damage and se's pushed away against the wall. Then she vanishes! Thorin can see bits of broken pottery and scattering bits of stone debris as she rushes to escape; but from his damage, his Detect Magic fails - *just*, Bless almost helping it stay up.

Francesc looks up, sees the spider, moves Hunters Mark and fires; she hits, including slugs; 14 damage total... The rogue attacks Thorin at melee range, hitting twice; 9 damage total. He has 1hp left!... The spider aboves Francesc hits her with a web, restraining her; then it crawls down the wall and attacks with advantage. It tries to bite; somehow, misses. Francesc is having none of it!

Penny runs in, flanks the rogue with Thorin and attacks. Hits with Divine Smite, 1d8+2d8->1,2,7+2 but notes more damage than expected from the smite, 1d8->7, 20 total; ah! This must be undead or a fiend.

Arturo looks around. The rogue seems badly injured but Francesc needs help too. He twins Firebolt to try and hit both spider web around Francesc and the rogue. 14 hits the rogue for 10 damage, taking them down; 10 hits the web, doing 4 damage -> takes 8 (vulnerable to fire); it burns off; then he runs around the corner to the inside wall, to hide from the giant spider above him. The spider pursues and attacks in melee, hitting for 4 piercing damage; *just* makes the con save; 5 poison damage. Holds his Bless spell.

As he has a brief moment to take stock, Arturo is startled to see 3 pits along the wall, containing **cages with terrified children inside**.

Thorin, with 1hp, figures he should probably run and hide...? He heads down the stairs, to be within range of the spider on Francesc but is pretty much tapped out. Instead, he sinks down and figures - what the hell. He starts his Detect Magic ritual.

Suddenly as arcane burst of psychic energy hits Penny (matching AC). This reveals the previously invisible halfling's location. Penny takes 14 damage. A second burst misses. The halfling's displacement effect seems to kick in again and she starts to shimmer.

Faced with the close-by spider, Hunter's Mark present; she drops her bow and has time to draw one of her two shortwords. Hits with 23, for - with "all the toys" included - high 19 damage. The spider bursts into a bizarre shower of baby spiders, which drop to the ground dead. She then moves to try and see the spider that's on Arturo; she's close to Thorin, doing his ritual (on the verge of death!).

Penny tries to run up tackle the halfling, past the giant spider; it's opportunity attack misses; she tries to attack the halfling. It's only a nat 2, so even with Bless is a big miss - but the sword passes through the space, revealing the halfling's apparent position to be, again, an illusion. Freed from risk of opportunity attack, Arturo is able to run around and carefully aim Burning Hands to just miss Penny and cover a likely area that the halfling must be in, since its spell effects were visibly emanating from nearby. The halfling dodges the worst of it, but still takes 6 damage and it's now clear to see where she *really* is - very close to the illusion.

The spider selects a target; it has no web attack still, so tries to bite Arturo. Misses!

Thorin continues his ritual.

The wizard tries to hit each of Arturo and Penny. Hits Arturo for 2d10+3->15 damage. Arturo falls; but before he does, he reacts with the gem dragon retaliation, the wizard failing to avoid it; she flies out of the door with 12 damage, falling unconscious. The second attack, to Penny, never comes.

Francesc moves Hunters Mark and shoots the spider. 18, hits. Total damage is 13. She moves in closer. Penny swings; hits for 7 damage. It's very injured but annoyingly, still up.

Arturo rolls death saving throw. The giant spider misses Penny. Thorin continues his ritual.

Francesc hits the giant spider (24) for a very solid 17 damage. That kills the spider, this explodes into black goo that splatters over Penny and Arturo.

Penny runs around - 4hp healing to Arturo; 3 to Thorin. Meanwhile, Francesc examines the halfling to see if she's full dead. Bleeding out - not yet dead. Penny has 1hp healing left! We bind the halfling's hands and then heal her for 1hp. Arturo calls that we should gag her too, in case of verbal-only spellcasting. Francesc starts checking doors and ceilings for spiders.

And then we hear it - plaintive cries of weak-sounding children from the cages below. Penny doesn't wait for Detect Magic. She runs down, starts smashing locks and opening them. **8 children!**

* Four human girls in one cage
* Two human boys and a very young half-elf boy in the next
* In their own separate cage, a young child with strange, black, pupil-less eyes, featurelss face, very pale skin, androngeous-sounding voice, shaking and weak; their skin changes colour when touched to help them out; *they* are very afraid of the other children

Penny doesn't know the race but knows the emotion. She tries to console them. With Arturo's help, persuasion 18 to calm them. We introduce ourselves. They say they are called "**Song On The Wind**".

While Penny keeps talking, Arturo takes the mage's staff and spellbook. He sees an amulet; arcana 12, doesn't detect if it is magical, but it does have an insignia. He checks what we now think was a priest; same. The rogue spy, Arturo notes, doesn't really seem undead per se, but looking closer, he notices a rapid kind of decay of their skin; they seem to be starting to heat up from inside! He gets a shortsword and dagger off the body just in time, before they self-combust!

Arturo tries to investigate more, but is covered in spider goo (investigation 4); calls Francesc over, who helps (investigation 8); nothing is found. At least he notices that the wizard's staff has an aura of magic.

Penny is trying to ask Song what race they are. They don't know. They're not from here; we're alien to them. Penny apologises for our strange appearance and says that it seems maybe their race is nothing to do with their capture, because there were others of "our kind" that were taken. They explain that they were "brought through" by magic. We start chatting to the other childen.

* We find out that the two girls we were looking for **ARE** here.

Penny pulls out rations (4 full rations for 8 kids). They descend upon them like ravenous wolves! We figure we can fit all 8 on the card if the rest of us walk.

Thorin's Detect Magic comes up. The staff is indeed magical; there's an unusual ability. It seems to be a magic quarterstaff of some kind - it can enhance spellcasting and flare with light. A **Skywinder Staff**. Then, in the corner, he spots something with a light magic emanation from within a bag. He digs through. It's a potion - **Resistance to Cold**. 40gp in there, too! The armoured guy has slightly damaged splint armour. We could fix it up; we put it in the Bag Of Holding. Arturo patches it up with Mending, takes about a minute. Penny figures it'll fit! We put her chain armour in the bag of holding and she now wears split (AC 18->19).

NEXT TIME:

* The children help us (despite our awful investigation rolls) notice a writing desk.
* What exactly *is* this ancient - temple? - for?
* We have the wizard for questioning somewhere & somehow.
* Children will fit on our cart to be taken to their respective homes if possible (we could walk alongside), but we might need help for some of them - e.g. where could we possibly take Song On The Wind?
* Don't forget about Cassee and the dragon!

(End of part 5)
