# RIPA: Part 36
## Session 36 (2024-04-09)
### Day 39, Neverwinter, morning

Thorin has at long last been fitted with his dragon scale armour. Hela asks if there's anything else we might like. Most of us are flush with new gifts - even if they came from the dubious source of the Lich VS - and don't have a need right now. But Hela does point out in particular an armour upgrade she thinks Penny (who is wearing Hela's decorative plate already), which is in a darker colour; a kind of dark chrome, offering additional magical protection. It's a reasonable price with an exchange. Penny is reluctant; the existing armour was her first "proper Paladin moment", with its strange anodisation in white and blue. But the new armour is practical, if nothing else. There's even an adamantine option - no more protective than her existing armour *except* in the case where a creature attacking is unusually lucky and might've dealt a particularly bad blow. This armour would take the worst of the impact. It's a dark grey and 2000gp not 2500gp.

Adamantine is the choice. 750gp back for the trade-in; ADV persuasion 3,4+9->only 13, 1250gp is the balance. No bargains this time.

Apart from perhaps any shopping or other menial duties, the keep is in good shape and we figure we might as well go directly to Baldur's Gate. We find a quiet corner and teleport - arriving in the Elfsong Tavern, at the bar, through the rift as usual - for us. Not so usual for them. People step out of the way, but carry on their business - given the early hour it seems like there's quite a lot of inebriation here!

We're about to head directly out to VS's mansion here, but the barman insists we at least buy something. Francesc buys some rations in the form of bread & cheese!

Perception rolls; Thorin and Penny are largely oblivious to people going past, bumping into us; but Arturo notices (19) that someone has tried to take something from Thorin's backpack. Arturo holds them with magic; they pretend to be drunk but (Thorin insight 22) knows they aren't. They make a show of "help, I'm being robbed!" and insists he took nothing. Penny tries to persuade him to talk; despite that being a 26, he didn't take anything. Apparently, he *really* didn't. A change in tactic; there's money in it if he's heard of strange stone tablets! Nope, doesn't even pretend about it...

...But Alder Ravenguard, the Grand Duke, has gone missing; he's the head of the Flaming Fist - it happened about 4 weeks ago. In a rather inspired move, Francesc then asks if there are any kind of pins or bows (!) or anything that will stop people trying to pickpocket us! We're very over it... A thieve's guild or something, a thing that'll warn people away? He tells us we need to exit the city. "What you want to do is head into Stony Eyes, just on the other side of the Basilisk Gate. There's a stables called **Garynmor**. Talk about getting a guard or escort. When they ask you where for, tell them **for Eastway**. That'll keep you safe here in Eastway." Penny flips him 1gp and lets him go. He continues, though. "If you find yourself wandering into Deepside, north of here, you need to go **The Undertaker** - at **Candle Hollows Funeral Arrangements** - and say you want to talk to **the Priest**."

We have to ask a passer-by at random for how we get started on the somewhat vague "can't miss it" directions we got from VS to the mansion. Basilisk Gate takes us to one side of the hill; another gate to another side, but a much rougher area, so Penny suggests Basilisk Gate. We could possibly check out Garynmor on the way by. In brief, that's exactly what happens. At the stables, Arturo persuasion - a huge 31. But of course, it's a bit of a racket; 5gp each for the first month of protection. We say we'll think about it! We'll meet VS first and see if looks like we're likely to have to spend much more time here but it's very unlikely.

There are around 4 streets here but there's one obvious main passageway, heavily used, dirt road pounded down, some paving stones broken or missing here and there; lots of service shops here; but behind, along the smaller parallel streets, are basically slums. It's busy and we see an unusual number of children. Up above us is the massive hill that overlooks the bay and city. But the hill clearly has no big buildings, so this isn't the right place. So either we have to walk around it the long way, or choose the other gate? From scrying, we remember the part of the city that we looked back onto. We decide that rather than faffing about back in town trying to find "a better gate", we'll just take a road to the hill and get to the scrub. It's easy to access from here.

We reach a ridge line that separates kind of the north and south "sides" of the hill. There seem to be an unusual number of carrion birds, circling the hill in general. Arturo notices; he suggests we go to where they're circling - and that's the top of the hill, a bare rock dome. We go up!

Perception, highest is Thorin 16; we're aiming for the top; we see three old stone villas with compounds and mature trees, lower down the slope. One of those matches the description of VS' mansion - olive trees, stone pines. Well, that's good; but we keep going up to the top for now. We find a series of entrances into what seem to be small caves or passageways. Lots of bird muck (!) but also bits of picked bone and so-on, littering around the entrances. Penny Nature 15; not enough to understand what did this. Could be lots of them, might be dangerous and it could be totally natural stuff anyway. Prey and predators. So - we decide to proceed to the mansion. It's not far.

On arrival, a low stone wall lets us see into the garden. We recognise it from scrying - this is definitely the place. There's an unlocked wrought iron gate, so we go in. A grounds keeper is present, not apparently doing too great a job trimming a plant for some reason; he looks at us as we walk in, but doesn't do much else except kinda freeze and watch us. Once we've gone past he just carries on.

At the back of the house there's a once-blue door but the paint is sun-damaged and peeling. There's a brass knocker ring that's inserted into the nose of a minotaur. Penny knocks with it just as Francesc is saying, "Don't use the knocker, it's probably booby trapped!"

Fortunately not - shuffling feet sounds; the door opens; a short female human, small eyes; "Yes?" "We're here to see Velindra. We're expected!" "Hold on." The door closes. Shuffling feet noises, departing. Shuffling feet, approaching. Door opens; "Yes, come in. She's upstairs. Close the door after you" - and she wanders off.

We head in and look for the stairs. It's a fairly quaint little villa, actually, in the daylight at least! It doesn't take long to find Velindra, in a dark room with curtains drawn, reading.

"You made it" she says. "Evidently" says Penny. "I promised you things. I have them here somewhere. Come in; have a seat."

We sit on a sofa - big enough for three; Penny stands.

"First, the bow" says Velindra. She produces an intricately-carved bow, which seems to be made of two kinds of wood, one threaded inside another then polished and carved to create a marbled effect. It's old; Francesc is warned to look after it, especially the string - handed down for the millennia.

Next, Arturo. "You're *sure* you want this?" "Of course!" She unfolds a silk package to reveal a vial that - in Arturo's mind alone - seems to pulsate and call to him. "As they say - be careful what you wish for. Whatever magic powers it seems to feed off your very essence but what it gives in return is quite formidable" she warns. Arturo is unfazed. He pulls out a dagger to cut a small amount of blood for the vial - but nat 1 - he over does it! Spurts of bloods spray around. Penny smiles - it's not doing the furniture much good, and anything bad for VS is good for Penny. She uses 1 of her hands-on pool to close up the wound.

Meanwhile, some blood did get into the vial and the moment it does, Arturo gets a strong sense that the vial's potential is now his potential too. It's like - an urge, to let go; step off the precipice, claim all the power within himself... He's spent a lot of time working on *not* letting all that out, yet this vial seems to encourage it!

She says she's not forgotten about Thorin. When she's done with the shard, he can have it - though she's no idea why he'll want it by then. He's sure we'll realise Vallin isn't who she's portrayed herself to be by that point; he explains that he has an obligation - he's magically bound. "There's one thing I can try" she says "but it does risk severing the staff's connection to its source of power" - referring to Thorin's staff. But Thorin decides the obligation is not something he minds so much as the risk of his staff being damaged.

Now, VS finds some very large scrolls - she magically moves a big table over and unrolls them; they're almost like large architectural plans when rolled out. Francesc can read that it's part of a poem. She rolls it back up and hands it Francesc - same again. We end up with rubbings for the three tablets VS has. That means we have 5 and know the location of the 6th - and our amulets mean that VS can't Detect Thoughts so doesn't know this.

The conversation turns to how we find the last one - or as far as VS knows, the last *two*. VS produces an old note book and flips to a particular page. It has a strange, leathery-face bookmark. There are some options for where they might be...

* One is underground, underdark.

* One is *very* underground - **Annam's Cradle** - there are stories about people having visited the place, though much of it is covered in myth.

* A cavern called **Tsojcanth** in the underdark, under the Sunset Mountains to the far East; a mausoleum or temple complex in the mountain? Once the laboratory or study of a great and very powerful witch, Iggwilv - better known as Tasha by many. Iggwilv went missing a century ago; most assume she's dead but anyone "with a few functioning brain cells" knows she is just somewhere else. Too powerful to have just *died*. Many artefacts and treasures in there - but of course it's a lethal dungeon, which is why it hasn't been ransacked already.

* A fourth option - a tower - possibly in the Mere of Dead Men but she's searched there extensively and sure it isn't there anymore. She thinks maybe it might be far in the south of Feyrun, in what was once the "old Killing Fields now overgrown by a jungle". South of Amh. She thinks she's isolated a location in the jungle.

She doesn't know if these clues are for the same tablet or different tablets. Arturo suggests we show our map of the Mere to see if that matches things VS as looked at. She's not seen such a map from *this* era before! She didn't find anything in the area. No tower there; if there was once one, it doesn't exist anymore.

"If I were a gambling person" says VS, "I would've found some of his very puzzling. Why would objects of such cosmic significance happen to be within what is essentially a tiny radius, around where we conveniently happen to be right now. None of these locations are on the other side of the continent, or even a different continent. Perhaps there is a pattern? Or perhaps the tablet locations have a pattern?"

We ask about where she found the three (but know they could've been moved over time).

* An expedition went north, past the Spine. In an old Duergar mining town, that mines a dangerous, magical ore, they found a first tablet.

* The second was found to the East, past Evereska, in the southern parts of the Anauroch in an old (giant's) tomb.

* The third she didn't find - she took it from someone "who is no longer with us" - she didn't find out where it was from! - "...in hindsight I might have not incinerated them..."

We've been keeping our cards close to our chest. Deception checks all round:

* Arturo 26
* Penny 20
* Thorin 18
* Francesc 18

We've been careful. Asked about the other *two* tablets and more. She doesn't pick up on the fact that we know another one. But the longer we're here the higher the chances of slipping up. She asks what we're going to do - we'll research and try to find the remaining tablets. We can bring the rubbings or even tablets to her. And she'll use them to "have a fighting chance" - to fight off this super god.

We realise that we actually know more about what these tablets do than she does. She knows the poems contain hints, but we know they're specifically hints to entrances to the planes where the key segments reside.

She Watches Thorin closely. She pulls the shard out of a drawer. "Time isn't something we have the luxury of anymore. I don't know how long we have but the demon incursion in the underdark is worrying because nothing had happened for a *very* long time - I've been aware of this for decades! - so for things to be suddenly moving, and they appear to be accelerating, especially in the far, far East - disappointing, I have contingencies..." - she seems to lose her thread. We enquire. She had a plan there and it "didn't work out" so we let that go! "...I have a network of people keeping an eye out for signs. If it looks like this being is beginning to move then we will definitely regret taking our time over this!"

Penny preempts this. She's giving this speech about time pressure, but we're aware. So what's with the shard; it tells her how far away this thing is. Her best guess based on that? Somewhere in the vicinity of **ten to 30 days**.

Well that focuses the mind. We might not have too many chances to get it wrong - we can only "slow travel" to places we haven't been before.

(Penny realises a little while later that that her "to the East" reference was the extra-planar beings which are on the way 'to get her', and Plan A failed - they're still on the way to get her. She has other plans!)

She has some - ex-colleagues, not friends! - who might be able to offer assistance. We could reach out them. She was on a council of a group of powerful magic users in Luskan - the Arcane Brotherhood - some amongst their ranks she would still "trust". But at the least, they can be of use.

"And what of Alder Ravenguard? Any connection" asks Penny.

"Alder Ravenguard has managed to get himself into a spot of trouble!" "Where did you take him?!" asks Arturo. "I didn't take him anywhere! He just sticks his nose into everything. The man cannot help himself! You are aware of what's happened in the East?"

Huh?

She pulls out a broadsheet made in Baldur's Gate. "Elturel Missing" - Alder Ravenguard was headed there, last thing she heard. Penny looks - "That can't be right. A *city* can't be missing!" - but there's a picture; a huge crater. Penny says, "The artist must be being dramatic, surely..." she counters.

The longer we stay here, the more chance we have of being seen through. We're going to leave. VS rings a bell; the short woman arrives to escort us out.

Oh. We forgot to ask about the carrion birds at the mountain top... Francesc suggests that Penny asks the gardener! Persuasion 26. They've been here as long as him - at least the last 20 years - he doesn't know what creatures leave all the bones; lots of rumours; "the dead three aren't truly gone" he mentions; word of cults... This is *not* our priority right now.

### Midday

We figure we should ask our friendly Underdark giant about the clues Velindra gave us! So, we use the helm; we're down in the city; the usual token-based shenanigans to get past the guards; and - decent progress:

* The underdark location *is* indeed their library.
* After a lot of consideration, we are as confident as we can be that it's not Tasha's cavern.
* We figure out where the tower is. The giant concurs with VS; the jungles. Now we ask if the knows where the ones we already have came from - to try and come up with a pattern for locations.

Our options are down to two. The jungle or the cradle.

What about the old tablet locations? A lot of them do seem to have a giant connection of some kind or other. The tower down south has no giant connection; but the tablet could've been moved there. Annam's Cradle, then? The Star Forge is reached by the same underground caverns that lead to Annam's Cradle.

The path to Annam's Cradle is long; we start in the Underdark and must travel for over a week *straight down*. Meanwhile the tower down South is also a very, *very* long way.

There's a shortcut to Annam's Cradle... A **two thousand mile fall** - launching ourselves over a giant shaft - which we estimate would be at least **seventeen hours of falling alone** and finding some way to *not* die at the end!

Except...

* Terminal velocity
* Thorin is hardy
* He can wild shape
* He can rest while he falls and keep shifting very 4 hours
* He could carry nothing breakable and a bag of holding
* Take a stone from the top, fall with the helm, get a stone at the bottom, teleport up to us waiting, then we all teleport down

...and, this being among the top 3 most stupid things we've ever done, we decide to go for it!

It'll take a day to get to the edge of the drop. We're told the way, with a map. Francesc decides to lead; survival 22; luck roll - D20 -> 15. On passive perception, Thorin and Penny sense a demonic presence as we travel. Thorin, futher, sees signs activity of people up ahead in one of the passageways off to the side. In whispers, Francesc argues that we might have these people come up behind us when we're waiting for Thorin. So, despite the demonic presence, we decide to get in close and, perhaps, attack.

We get close and can see into the tunnel. Arcana Thorin 24; an active magic circle *containing* a demon, stood there right now! Drow around are trying to keep it contained. Are they calling it and trying to control it, or are they trying to send it back? Francesc insight 27. A drow Loth cleric is preparing a spell, that seems to be to used when the demon is subdued. Thorin's arcana helps him recognise Banishment.

We withdraw, as quietly as we can.

We keep going for the rest of the day. We push ourselves, trying to get as far as we can. Unfortunately, Penny starts to become exhausted, so we're close - but not quite there. We must be within an hour or two, but we're forced to rest. We set up camp, but use only bursts of light briefly to try and minimise attraction of any people or creatures.

Watch is set.

* Arturo: Perception 11
* Thorin: Perception 28
* Francesc: Perception 11
* Penny: Perception 10.

Despite the low rolls - DM check is lower; nothing bad happens to us!



## Day 40

Francesc has spent her 4 hours after meditation swapping things around into the bag of holding ready for Thorin's fall. Arturo swaps his staff for his new vial, too.

We move on. A couple of hours later; a chasm. No visible other side. No giant spiders. A wind blows up from the edge.

Francesc tries to find a rock to give to Thorin - but in the end, he has to chip a chunk out of the cavern wall. He puts it into the bag of holding. The helm is in there too. Thorin attunes to it by dropping, temporarily, his staff attunement; it would break if he fell with it. Bag of holding.

Everything is ready...

WIS save for Thorin to actually step off the ledge. 26! This has been planned. He doesn't need to look down. He knows he needs to jump though, to clear the wall. Thorin does the whole "LOTR 'toss me'" thing, but that won't get him very far, so Arturo casts Fly.

Penny is holding on, ready to react to the moment he drops...

He flies out. He yells out to Arturo, "Let it rip!" when he's ready.

Penny watches and sees Arturo release the spell, waits just a tiny fraction, then yells "Wait! No! We forgot..."

...and Thorin falls! Unbeknownst to us, he is turning into a giant constrictor snake - head down, aerodynamic, max speed; short rests, eventually briefly drops out of that and immediately transforms back, over and over.

Francesc sees Thorin drop. 30 seconds; 1 minute; nothing happening.

"I can't believe he actually did that" says Francesc. We withdraw a distance and set up a sort of camp. Arturo lights a potato and starts working on Thorin's memorial. Penny (survival 4+6) and Francesc (survival 26!) forage; Francesc finds some interesting mushrooms. Meanwhile, Arturo starts thinking... The obscura showed him fighting a lich, but instead of casting a fireball, he got killed instantly! He fights the obscura; WIS save, ADV, 9,9+5! Not enough. Worse, he remembers the tower in the vision. Argh! We should have gone to the tower, not this stupid hole in the ground!

We start to basically kill time.

Francesc tries to prepare food; Penny tries the flute - performance nat 1 + 5 + prof, not great.

Francesc perception nat 20 - she hears footsteps despite the flute playing! Well, our camp is unavoidably not subtle, so we figure we can form up and wait for the person to approach. The potato illumination is turned off. Francesc sees three faces pop around the corner of where we are. Not human, not drow; short, small; "Don't stop on our account!" they say in Undercommon. Penny translates. So she shrugs and starts playing again, much to everyone else's annoyance; Arturo relights his potato!

They look like deep / rock gnomes. Francesc invites them to join us. She will tell the Fabled Tale Of The Falling Dwarf! They ask why we're here; Arturo tries to bluff but fails. He points out that we're in the underdark and are wary! They agree with *that* and explain that they're here basically doing a form of fishing. **Sturges** live in Harbin's Hole (kind of vampiric bats). They have rods and lines with bright slugs on the end. They go on their way, but we tell them they're welcome back here at any time.

After this, thinking a bit of stealth is not useful, Francesc swaps her helm attunement with Thorin's staff. It's an interesting experience!

**Meanwhile, for Thorin** he's fallen 4 hours... He feels the effect start to wane, turns into a dwarf then turns back into a snake immediately again; he rests and gets the ability back. Another four hours, and another quick switch; He once again rests to get that ability back. CON save 26; he stays awake in this third four our period.

D20->18. At the end of the 12th hour, he feels the magic starting to fade a bit - and at that moment, strangely, he sees a light coming up to him *very* quickly - it's disorientating as he's just turned back into a dwarf and of course is still falling, very very quickly. DISADV perception, a solid 19. He seems to have exited the hole itself and is in some kind of - well, a rift. **An *actual* rift**. He can see bits of the edge tears, a rip, intense radiant light shining out. And the place he's in is lit up. **WIS 26, he has the presence of mind** to choose to be something that flies, or turn into a snake again; he chooses a flying creature. He sees one nearby and without thinking much about it just changes into it!

Four of them were swopping through the air nearby. **He's become a Quetzalcoatlus. A dinosaur.** Slowing very rapidly; plummet, to dive, to glide at a fast 80ft speed.

He looks down at a truly massive cavern - *miles* wide and, he thinks, at least a mile high. It seems to contain a whole new world. The strange thing is, despite seeing the rift, he doesn't think this is another plane. He perhaps did not fall into the rift he saw - it's simply nearby and perhaps all the things that are in this cave have come through from there. Then he notices giant runes - huge, 100ft high, carved into the very distant walls. This space is magical and those runes are maintaining it. He sees a mesa; he glides down smoothly and lands. Not a scratch.

So there, then, stands a dwarf on a mesa, in a strange, giant cavern of dinosaurs and prehistoric plant life. This is not how he expected the day to go!

(End of part 36)
