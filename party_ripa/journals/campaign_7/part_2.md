# RIPA: Part 2
## Session 2 (2023-04-18)

Penny ends up staying behind in the forest to observe the captured, but then released hunters, to ensure their good behaviour. The group has agreed to investigate and try to find their daughters in return. Thorin, Francesc and Arturo proceed to Ondin to investgiate the warehouse where the hunters drop off their marked sacks of ill-gotten gains, for fear of reprisals against their kidnapped daughters.

Once there, after scoping out the location of significant buildings - including the aforementioned warehouse - Thorin and Francesc go to a local tavern ostensibly to gather intelligence about the criminal activity taking place. They are, however, rapidly distracted by the bar's ample supply of ale, and sit happily in a corner, mostly oblivious to the distrusting gazes of the bar's other patrons - who are all humans. It was, in hindsight, never going to be easy to go unnoticed here!

Arturo meanwhile has elected to take a closer look at the warehouse. While looking around, he is surprised to find himself being observed by a red panda. Apart from being a strange creature to see in this part of the continent, it doesn't act much like a red panda would - no interest in food; watches him carefully; but when he tries to approach, it flees. Arturo gives chase but the panda eventually reaches the boundary of the woods and Arturo thinks better of continuing pursuit, given the dangers of travelling the woods alone and the possibility of being lost.

Returning to the tavern, Arturo has more luck with talking to the bar tender. He asks questions - what's been happening around; any strange creatures in the woods; that kind of thing. Persuasion is well over 20. Bar tender is reminded of himself when he was younger - first drink is poured for free - and relays stories of odd behaviour of animals in the area. Hunters come back without success or even injured themselves, has seen strange creatures. There was a pack of wolves, led by a white-haired wolf; a cave bear injured hunters and chased them out. At night, *lightning boars* have been seen - wild boars, with lightning for eyes. The barman won't be drawn on talking about smugglers or things along those lines.

Arturo is directed to some hunters; he buys three drinks for them, goes to their table and speaks to table. Same sort of story. There's a theory - deforestation has been happening closer to Neverwinter, along with near Gauntlgrym. That is a recently-unearthed Dwarven civilisation city that was revealed when the volcano near Neverwinter was revealed and has been economically recovering since, leading to more deforestation there too. Thorin, eavesdropping, realises during this that the hunters *do* know something about smugglers though they claim to not do so - they're trying to distance themselves from the activity, since they aren't reponsible.

Later that night, Thorin has elected to sleep in an inn, but Francesc and Arturo are camping out and taking turns in watches (well, more or less; it's a bit of a skewed watch balance, since Francesc only needs to meditate for 4 hours for a full rest, rather than sleeping for 8). On the verge of falling asleep, Arturo fails to notice the red panda until it has sat right beside him. Very strange! Unable to think of much else to do, he strikes up a conversation; "Are you hunting poachers too?" - and *speaks* in answer - "Yes!".

All is revealed, The red panda is the animal form of the now-appeared halfling druid called **Eloise**, who, like our party, has been trying to find out more about the hunters. After hearing about the very complex plan related to putting Thorin in a sack in the warehouse, waiting until collection and tailing the collectors so we can find out where they go next, Eloise reveals that she already knows - **the criminals head to Phandalin**. Well-travelled Francesc knows it.

The group attempts to pursuade Eloise to come with her, but she "can't leave her territory". Arturo notices she wears enamel pin of a tree within a ring of vines is visible pinning her green cloak; he doesn't know what it is, but thinks it is significant and draws a sketch.

The next move is considered. It seems best to still try and follow the poachers - carts carrying the sacks that Eloise described simply as containing "animal parts" (!) - rather than just turning up in Phandalin with no idea where anyone might be hiding. At least Eloise had told Francesc that the warehouse in Phandalin is marked, so that helps a fair bit. The horses-and-carts turn up with a driver and "two muscle", load things and head off. Swords, spears, scimitars, whatever.

Watch is restarted, Eloise helping a while, before eventually saying goodbye (in red panda form) and heading off. Thorin is woken and brought up to speed; everyone gets onto the same page. There's a chance to pursue, intercept and question. There's a sneaky shortcut that Francesc knows, so the plan is to go the fast route. It'll take about 3 days for their carts to get to Phandalin by horse and cart, while the shortcut, albeit on foot, should only take 2.

A message is left for Penny at the tavern. Arturio takes it, having established a rapport previously. The response? "Scout's honour; I will get this letter to your lady friend" says the owner!" - hmmm, I guess that's convincing?

The shortcut route begins. It takes a while, but they exit near the Triboar Trail. Arturio recognises the location, but it is a *long* way from where he started before he got stuck in the Fey. Thorin knows about Triboar too - an industrial town. Meh, good ale, I guess. This is a route often used to reach Neverwinter and, indeed, the road is fairly busy. There is the tail end of a caravan coming past, with a couple of dozen wagons or so.

We decide to seize the opportunity and try to tag along. The idea is that our amazing battle skills can help them out... This works out; we tag along with the last caravan in the chain, offering our protection to a family there who are looking for a new life in either Neverwinter or Waterdeep (after the war, those cities have prospered; but ongoing weird weather for the last year or so have caused trouble for farmers and they've decided to try and make their fortune in the city instead).

It's not too long before everyone stops, camps are set up, food is cooked; there is about one more day of travel to Phandalin. Francesc does an excellent job of foraging and hunting, with more than enough to share around to help make friends within the wider caravan. A (mostly full) bottle of brandy is shared around. It's a good evening.

As the night draws to a close, Francesc decides to creep around investigating the caravans. There's a cart/wagon that's drawn away from the main group a little distance away, with various tarps and other things that seem to be trying to hide or obscure the view a bit. Getting closer, looking around the tarp screen since there seems to be nobody around, is the wagon with sacks that bear the mark we know is of interest. **These are our smugglers!** They seem to have wandered off, but Francesc suspects it won't be for long (and at this point, Arturo sneaks over and joins her). After a bit of investigation and looking around, they start to sneak away (stealth 20 Francesc, 21 Arturo) but as they depart overhear two people approaching.

Thorin meanwhile, increasingly topped up with brandy but having done OK so far on a con. save, has been making friends - and carefully asking questions about who's what and where - finds a caravan of dwarves returning home to Phandalin, having made "riches" - so, they have guards. They're kind of the life of the party and it's easy for Thorin to strike up a conversation and make friends. When asking about the weird forest creatures, they say that this is why they chose the caravan. They claim to have seen a silhouette of a dragon towards the Sword Mountains. They don't know anything about poachers - they don't like to get involved in local politics!

Eventually we regroup. Watch is established. The night is uneventful.

In the morning, as the caravan people wake, they prepare to leave without apparently bothering with breakfast. As people start to move, the poacher wagon seems to hold back. We see that there are four of them and apparently they're trying to bolt onto the end. We want to end up with the family we've been travelling with at the end again, just before the poachers; Arturo spends time getting ready and fakes a hangover/vomiting to delay departure and it works. The family and us start to pull into file at the almost-back of the caravan, then the poachers follow, but at quite a distance.

Later, suddenly we notice, after quite a sharp corner, that the poachers aren't coming around the corner behind us. After a while it seems that something is afoot. We claim to have seen bandits to excuse ourselves from the travelling family, and jump down to run back along the road and find out what's happened.

Rounding the corner at a run, we see the four from the poacher wagon - clearly ready for a fight. Their wagon is some distance behind, but the four have been waiting just around the corner. (It turns out that despite good stealth rolls, Francesc and Arturio were noticed by very sharp perception of the two poachers who returned to the camp).

Initiative is rolled!

Francesc aims for a bad guy with the longbow, hitting and making them a favoured foe; 14 damage. Another one takes aim at Arturo and, despite being a long way away with their crossbow, they manage to hit for 7 damage.

The enemies start to reposition and one, who has a kind of wizardy-look, seems to start some kind of strange prayer, reaches into his shirt and pulls out a medallion. **"By the power of Vallin, may your strikes be true!"** he calls and blesses the other three.

Arturo tries to put the enemies to sleep; 31hp worth of sleep - 3 of them immediately fall! He then runs a distance to try and hide behind a tree. Thorin runs over to Arturo to cure him for 11hp and activates his staff; meanwhile the awake bad guy helps another one wake up ("Fucking wake up sleepy head, what are you doing?!").

Francesc knows that her two companions are now hiding behind a tree and assesses the enemies; the favoured foe isn't really the danger; the heavy crossbow wielder is worse - she fires, but sadly rolls 1. Miss.

The other guys are awoken. They manage to see spot Thorin behind the tree; one calls down a Sacred Flame on Thorin, but he dodges it. Arturo moves forward to use Burning Hands, for 11 damage on a nearby enemy (fails the save) and 5 on a further (makes the save).

Thorin charges back into the fight too, using his full movement to get into striking range with his staff. Unfortunately, this means he's next to one enemy and another is then able to use pack tactics, using advantage to hit twice; 6 and 3 damage.

Arturo manages to get an opportunity attack when the one he's close to tries to move away, though; he hits for 6 damage. The aggressor tries his crossbow now he's at some distance but misses quite badly.

Francesc shoots at the one on Thorin; hits, and takes him down - through his mouth (ugh). It was the guy who cast bless earlier.

An arrow heads for Arturo; hits; 6 damage. In return Arturo throws a firebolt at a nearby bad guy, hitting for 8 damage; takes him down. Arturo is once again low on hp; and with Thorin - the only healer - similarly low, things are looking sketchy.

Thorin hits his melee combatant for 6 damage; he's injured but up; in return, two attacks; both *just* miss - Thorin's throwing around his shield, having none of it!

Francesc fires again. Hits; 7 damage... but then an inbound crossbow bolt hits Francesc back. 5 damage. Arturo repositions to get a clean shot and hits for 4 damage; this seems to motivate Thorin, who channels prior inspiration and *just* manages to hit the enemy with whom he has been trading blows and, fortunately, hits; smashes across his legs and takes him down - one more hit to Thorin and the story would've been reversed.

Back to Francesc; one is left; she wants to take her alive and tries to pin them with an arrow. It works!

That's it - battle over. Three dead, one captured. A lot of healing is needed! While healing is happening, Francesc looks to the captive. The woman is frightened, trembling; not apparently from the battle; she's whispering - "Mother, forgive me for what I have done!" - and she pops a vial, drinks it, convulses, coughs, bleeds from her *eyes* and dies.

"How's the interrogation going?" shouts Arturo...

A plan is hatched to take the clothes and impersonate the group of four, rejoining the tail end of the now-quite-distant, but catchable, caravan. Of the bodies:

* One seems to be a spy; a list with marks next to a few names; those names don't make sense, but the list is taken. 12 names, 8 crossed out. They might be places, people, not sure.
* One is a priest, or acolyte; there's a coin bag, with some 26 gold and 40 silver pieces. The party rather generously elects to split it *four* ways with Penny included, 7 gold and 5 silver (or thereabouts) each.
* There's a bag of harvested herbs - 25gp worth of healing medicinal herbs. Given a vial and time, that could be turned into a healing potion.
* There's a medallion with an insignia of 5 stars arranged in a pentagram. Thorin thinks it isn't magical (arcana 20); it has been used as a holy symbol, but isn't a religion (19) that he has encountered before. Francesc (history 19) thinks she might've seen it in a far-eastern area, Sea of Fallen Stars region - Cormir, Thay, months of travel away. So why is it here, on the Sword Coast? **Either way, it seems related to Vallin.**

Francesc noticed something familiar about the spy's cloak, before she killed herself. It's elven! **A cloak of Elvenkind** - a magical item that aids stealth.

Animal handling check goes well and Thorin calms the horse - who tells Thorin that his name is Bruiser - so that the group can now take the wagon.

The game is afoot!
