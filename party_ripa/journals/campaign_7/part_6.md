# RIPA: Part 6
## Session 6 (2023-05-30)
### Day 4, roughly 10am

The children have shown us a writing desk. Penny helps Francesc investigate; adv. 5,8+6->14. Papers; no writing; just diagrams - words, arrows, things crossed out. Francesc recognises a few words that match those on the list of cryptic words we already found. Looking closer, we see that not all words are the same and the paper here has fewer words, but there's a lot of overlap.

We discuss options as a group. With history, religion and arcana checks we struggle, though Thorin thinks that some might be magical; also on a 19 religion, he finds that two of the combinations don't make religious sense per se but the word pairs are each related to the same deity. Arturo persuades the kids to talk about it - and we find that they correlate to the words. It's not their names - it's related to things they represent in some way. We now realise that our original list of 12 entries had 8 crossed out - for 8 children.

There's one other name on the new list which isn't on our original one and isn't crossed out. **Gauntelgrim** is given as the location for "*green spider*"; Thorin recognises this as a recently repopulated Dwarven city. It's not too far, but the route is a bit awkward (the city was revealed to the "modern" world by the volcanic eruption near Neverwinter). We can't readily figure out how the strange word pairs near locations map to children by description - Song Of The Wind had one that reads "Tempest Song", which is easy enough, but others don't seem to make much sense; the kids help with some - things their parents do, star signs and so-on. At least we have the locations (but some are loose, e.g. location of parents, or in some cases, a very specific location which was where they happened to be kidnapped).

The kids don't know what was going to happen to them. They weren't being treated well but were being fed. They overheard that they were to be "delivered" - **brought to "the prophet"**.

The two hunter's daughters were both linked to the same town; descriptions were for one an animal and another a star sign. Another has a strange name related to "luna", apparently in relation to tides and things their parents cared about. It's like a cryptic crossword. We don't know why it's so cryptic.

Penny looks around to see if she can get any idea what this strange temple is for. Religion 3-1->2. That'll be "no". Thorin checks out the remains of the undead; investigation 2+4->6, not much info there!

Arturo and Thorin are badly injured and we know there are spiders down here. There's a lot of the cave that remains unchecked, but we're in no shape to do that right now. This all said, we don't know what's going on above ground either. Francesc, with Guidance from Thorin, sneaks back along the cavern and upstairs to check. Stealth 4+5->9 (!). Perception: 7+5->12. Francesc reaches the shed and hears sounds outside. A conversation about "they're meant to be here" - sounds like two - that are expecting the people we dispatched and buried.

Via passive perception, Francesc spots the lever that "closes" the bench above the stairs; it swings into place. She uses a wad of clothing to try and stop the lever from being moved, then comes back to tell us what's going on. We try to take a short rest. Francesc and the kids keep watch for spiders.

The kids gradually get more boisterous as they relax and realise they're safe. Francesc tries to get them to quieten (intimidation 2-1->1!) to no avail. While initially funny, Penny at the end of her short rest is also over it and tries the same thing herself, with more success (17+4->21); they quieten down.

Once it's finally quiet, we realise we can hear wind from another entrance/exit somewhere. Penny, survival - nat 1+4->5. Sigh. Arturo helps; 20+1->21. Sigh #2. He follows the fresh breeze, casts Light and finds a passage leading to a tiny sliver of light up above, along a shaft that's steep but crawl-able. The opening is mostly child-sized. Thorin gets up there to check the stone; finds a weak point; Penny jams her shield into a crack, then (athl nat 20+4->24) manages to force a key piece of stone out of the way, a couple of others then falling away; there's room for us to get through.

Francesc goes first to check where the exit is, taking her rope back from Thorin first; the exit is near a wooded area; the house is nearby but not in direct view; there's even a way behind the rows of houses along the edge of the woods to get back to where we left Cassee with the cart. Francesc drops the rope and ties off the end. Arturo follows; Penny stays mid-way as she's strong and can help the kids up; Thorin, with dark vision, stays back to keep a watch on the passageway.

As Song On The Wind gets into daylight, their skin changes colour; they take on a more opaque, solid and brown-ish hue.

We bring the captured gnomish wizard up in a sack!

Thankfully, when we get back to the cart, it's still there, along with Cassee. She's freaking out a bit because we'd been gone for so long, but is relieved. The dragon is still there - and the kids lose the plot. Arturo casts Sleep! 22hp worth -> all are asleep, along with the gnomish wizard. Penny drives the cart (animal handling 8+4->12 is enough) - a paladin in armour driving a cart full of sleeping children isn't too difficult a story to sell. Thorin turns into a horse to avoid being recognised in town...

...Francesc rides Thorin.

Cassee and Arturo walk alongside. Arturo convinces Cassee of our plan; deal with the children, we have people who can help with (at least some of) them and the dragon (the druids). Thorin and Penny (passive perception 16,17) both notice a small crowd gathered outside the warehouse. We take advantage of the rubber-necking; Francesc rides up on Thorin to check things out. She sees the warehouse "manager" standing outside the office, yelling at people. He's been striking someone - one of his staff, "I swear it wasn't me, I don't know anything about this!" - and Francesc recognises one of the voices from when she checked above ground at the farmhouse.

So, the "manager" knows all about the farmhouse. It's not something to deal with now - children first - and Penny is just driving the cart slowly on the whole time. By the time Francesc and Thorin is done, the cart is about d10->7->7 turns->300ft ahead. Someone in the crowd looks up and yells, "**IT'S AN ELF!...**" while pointing at the manager/supervisor; "...golden hair!" The manager looks up - "Yes! GRAB HER!"

Penny, perception 1+2->so that's "no". Arturo, 13. He gets the sense of a commotion but doesn't hear details. He tells Penny to try and speed up. Animal Handling 6+4; not much change.

Thorin bolts. He keeps away from the cart; that's reached the town centre roundabout and are turning left. History 3; no recollection; Francesc, though, 18+4->22. **"Golden Sylvanus" on the list.** Francesc looks over her shoulder - 3 people chasing on foot; Thorin is a riding horse at full speed, but Francesc wants him to slow down as these people know things. But wait! Bow & arrow. Francesc tries to shoot the manager in the leg. Dirty 20 attack roll; he's pinned. The other two stop for a minute, but he yells, "GRAB HER!" again and points. Thorin keeps running so Francesc shoots again! Aiming for a headshot, rather surprisingly; attack roll 21, damage 7 + slugs 6. They're (very) down. The other stops in shock and slows right down. Thorin *still* won't stop, so Francesc jumps off (acrobatics 19). Jump, flip, perfect landing. *Now* Thorin stops.

"Freeze, or you're next!" shouts Francesc as the remaining pursuer now turns tail to flee (we don't want them going to town to bring back 10 more). Intimidation 17-1->16 vs 15; it works. He stops, hands up. The manager is yelling furiously and hobbling our way; Horse Thorin charges at him! Attack roll 16; the manager is knocked prone.

So there's a guy face-down in the dirt, probably dead; one with hands raised; the manager, arrow in leg and prone; a distance away, the crowd by the warehouse has seen all of this go down and are slowly (but nervously) making their collective way in our direction.

"Why do you want me?" asks Francesc, of the guy with hands up; he claims to not know - the *other* guy (now dead) had shouted "it's an elf", apparently. Francesc disarms him; the manager is thrown over the back of Horse Thorin; Thorin gallops off to pursue the cart.

A while later, Penny and Arturo see the horse appear. "I can't leave you two alone for five minutes... Where's Francesc?" but Thorin stays in horse form. Arturo recognises the manager and ties him up, securing him to Thorin. A while later up the road, Francesc emerges from the side of the road and we all catch up on what happened.

* **We re-check the paper list more closely. Golden Sylvanus is indeed one entry. Another says "Fey Woods" - could that mean Arturo? Oh. "Holy Ambassador"; Penny. So, Green Spider... Thorin.**

Eventually Thorin turns back into a human. We put the manager onto the real horse (which Thorin tells us then complains, as it's overloaded - now dragging a heavy cart and carrying a body) so Penny jumps off the cart and leads the horse by walking instead. We keep moving as far as we can.

### 4pm

Thorin with help from Penny, adv survival -> 18; he spots after a while a particular combination of hills and a stream that indicates a possible cavern or upwelling source, and using that we follow the stream off-road to find a good camping spot. It's a handful - 8 now-very-lively children, that really want to play with the dragon (Penny's less successful intimidation check is 10). "But we were promised we could play with the dragon!" they claim; "Who told them that?!" asks Francesc, and Arturo becomes notable by his sudden absence.

Arturo and Thorin work on setting up branches and leaves to try and disguise the partly-in-cave camp. Penny and Francesc turn to the gnome wizard and manager but it's hard work. Thorin tries to charm the wizard; 14 vs 14, so it *just* fails. Arturo plays good-cop to Penny's bad-cop instead; persuasion 14 (Arturo) & intimidation (19) Penny. After a while she just starts essentially mocking us - laughing at the idea of us giving her safe harbour from the organisation that's "abandoned her" - "you don't know *what* you're dealing with here, do you? Ha! Oh this is going to be funny..."

"We know we're on the bad side of Vallin" says Arturo.

"Oh, you're not on the *bad* side of Vallin..." - she looks at Francesc - "...I know that *you're* on the list."

Francesc responds, "I know. Why?"

"I was just given the list. It comes from the prophetess, from the seer herself. There are fates worse than death, if *I* get on the wrong side of Vallin. There's nothing *you* can do."

Thorin tries threats but they don't work at all. Arturo tries too; the response is, "But  I *know* that's not how I go. I go gloriously. I've been told my future. I didn't know it would be me, but we know that *one* of us was going to be at risk of betraying everyone." She also laughs at the manager; "*That* oaf is nothing but a paid help!"

Arturo keeps trying, persuasion 22. The zeal fades from her eyes for a moment. But as the conversation continues, Thorin arcana 14 -> he notices that despite her hands being bound she's trying to cast something. She quickly says words of some of spell; he recognises it not as something he knows, but it's some kind of elemental conjuration. A wave of thunder explodes out from her - con saves for Thorin (22 OK), Penny (19 OK) and Arturo (6, fails). Everyone can hear it (**Thunderstep**) - she disappears! 19 damage to Arturo, 9 to Thorin & Penny.

Francesc, perception 15+5. The wizard appears outside the cave, about 90ft away from where she was. None of her bonds are with her anymore. She raises her hands to cast something else; Francesc fires her bow. It's only 12 but it's *just* enough; 12 damage; she falls unconscious - but just before it, manages to get out a dramatic monologue: "Vallin will have a piece of everything that she needs. She will be the goddess! You can't stop it!"

The kids get very overexcited again; this time, Francesc's intimidation (15) works.

Thorin gives up to sleep. Penny heals Arturo as much as she can; Arturo sleeps too. Penny heads over to Francesc who is checking on the gnomish wizard. Francesc, medicine 14. She suddenly seems to die! "Why did she die?" asks Penny. "Too injured". (Technically, failed 3 death saves). Francesc and Penny take the body back to the cave, next to the manager - a grisly intimidation attempt. "Tell us something more than we got out of her."

"I was hired..."

"Who hired you?"

"I was hired by a dark-skinned woman with braids, quite stocky" (Francesc recognises the description of the woman that was killed by the arrow at the old manor). "We were given a very specific job - to store things and to transfer kids to a safehouse." (The safehouse was the manor above the caves). "I was waiting for instructions on what to do next. We receive them from riders. We were supposed to deliver 8 kids in two days time and we got told that the remaining four people would appear before that happened and I'd have all 12 that I'd been tasked with. I don't have to find them - that's not my job - I just do logistics."

"Where would you take them to?" asks Francesc. He gives an address in Neverwinter. It's down by the docks. He just had to deliver the "12 live targets" and "all of the other things on our list; I was told anything that we found that wasn't part of the original manifest, we could sell for a profit."

All this talk of prophecy and seers makes the strange list easier to understand - it's vague; it was built by seers.

We're not sure what to do with him. Killing in cold blood seems bad. He's trying to argue that he can give us money; he tells Francesc where to find a gaudy gold and palladium medallion in his pocket. We don't know what it's really worth - "100s of gold" he claims. In the end, we decide we'll hand him over to the druids, to keep watch over him for a few days.

We head into watches while others sleep. Cassee and Francesc share a watch. Francesc (perception 18) notices that Cassee is seeming very nervous. She thinks we're putting the dragon at risk. "I've named her, by the way. **Spider**." - huh. **Green Spider could be the dragon, not Thorin?**

As watch switches to Arturo, he argues that Cassee should not try and rear the dragon at the university. Too many people are coming for it; many are very dangerous. The university isn't set up for that - it'd put many others at risk. He argues that the druids have skills to help rear it *and* have good protection skills; and they won't take the dragon away from her. This de-escalates things quite a bit and Cassee eventually goes to bed. Arturo watch, perception 12; no dark vision; doesn't notice anything.

Penny perception 11. Same deal. No dark vision; doesn't notice anything either!

Finally, Thorin with darkvision - perception 21. Part way through his watch, the kids start waking up and fooling around!



### Day 5, roughly 8am

In the morning, we try to find the druids as a big of a priority. Arturo and Thorin survival 12; can't find Druidic runes that should indicate a location. Penny wanders around and has a look - survival 20 (!) + 4. She's seen them before from hanging out with eleven druids in the past.

(Meanwhile, in the 30 minutes or so that has gone by, the kids are getting increasingly rowdy. Cassee has her hands full. The cart is her fort. The dragon is on the cart and she's got a letter opener dagger that she's trying to use to fend the kids off with! The kids are shaking the cart and generally being very badly behaved.)

Thorin looks at what Penny found. It seems to indicate a direction and a date. A conclave of druids should be about 6 miles from us following the stream, in an old grove. The date is lunar and, by some chance, the phase is tonight!

We'll have to go on foot. The path there can't take a cart. It'd be slow going - difficult terrain, things to carry; we could do it in a day. We leave the cart, put the injured manager guy on the horse and Penny leads it. We think it'll take about 4 hours. A shallow burial for the gnome wizard.

The stream is really nice to walk along in fact; swarms of mating mayflies or similar insects fly above it, small minnows and tadpoles within. The forest is in bloom. Trees have leaves or shoots out, but not so dense that it blocks all light. It's bright and sunny. The kids are quite resilient; they skip along, sometimes jumping into the stream, apparently fairly happy. Cassee talks to - or sometimes *at* - Arturo; theories of planar travel, how the dragon got here, the age of the egg and other more abstract things. She also poses questions about Song On The Wind, but they're hard to answer. We know from previous checks that they're not from "our" world, but (the same low rolls we keep getting!) we don't know anything.

After a while, we're climbing a fair incline and the forest becomes more dense. At the same time we notice signs of settlement; artificial changes to the natural environment.

### 2pm

We hear, before we see, the sound of activity - talking, singing; we reach the conclave. Trees with walkways lashed between them. Almost a treehouse affair in the middle between three larger trees with music coming from up there. It almost looks like there could be a tavern! Bamboo troughs channel water around the place. Some trees are evergreen; this adds to the impression of a more dense forest; the area underneath isn't in full sun.

People see us approaching. They look furtive. Penny, at the back leading the horse, notices galloping through vibrations in the ground. A centaur appears!

We explain that we're looking for Eloise. He knows her and, it seems, we've done well - this is apparently her clan's tree. Eventually he introduces himself; "My name is **Korthod**".

It's going quite well until we introduce Spider, the baby dragon. The centaur is astonished (and possibly, horrified). "How many of you have touched it?!" - apparently dragons tend to *imprint*. Certainly has with Cassee!

We leave the manager guy with Korthod while the rest of us make our way up the "treehouse" to find Eloise. The kids are a predictable handful. We get onto a kind of landing area before the tavern-like area that's about 30ft up. It's hazardous prior, without any handrails; at least there are some here. We start to go inside, which causes everyone to stop and stair - someone carrying glasses says "You can't bring kids in here!" - but then Eloise spots Francesc. "Wow! Hello, what are you doing here?!"

It's a mixed crowd. Pale-skinned halflings with chalk and charcoal tattoos, some human rangers, a humanoid owl and various others. A satyr stands behind the bar.

Thorin makes a beeline for the bar while Francesc and Penny explain the story again to Eloise, but before we get too far, Arturo suggests we should go somewhere private; Eloise says there's nothing to worry about.

* Eloise can help get Cassee and Spider to the Emerald Enclave that will figure things out from there
* We warn about the "green spider" reference on the list, having shown and explained it to her
* The kids can't stay at the Enclave, she thinks, but we're worried they could get kidnapped again
* We manage to persuade Eloise to at least perhaps find a place to keep them safe for a while, but send out messengers to parents (if the kids can give specific enough locations) so that parents get the choice to take home or not
* Long-term, if we think they're at risk or we know it's all safe (Vallin's done, somehow) then we can Skywrite to let Eloise know

In the mean time - drinks!

(End of part 6)
