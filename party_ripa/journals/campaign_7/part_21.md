# RIPA: Part 21
## Session 21 (2023-10-31)
### Day 18

Last night's whirlwind of rocketry was one of the more bizarre experiences the party has had, but had two extraordinary outcomes.

First, we own our own tower, the Barn Door, now four storeys rather than five and (thankfully, perhaps!) no longer flight-capable, but still, it's sturdy and can repaired as a going concern.

Second, we have been granted loan of two griffons which, the previous night, proved just about capable of carrying all four of us. This means we can head South to the theoretical location where in around 7 days the Trickster Moon should let us see the way to the portal that gets us to the Temple of the All Seeing Eye, from what was once "the oasis of Tashluta".

Arturo is told that the griffons will be fitted with double saddles. He's told how to look after them - feeding, watering and so-on. They're carnivorous and do need quite a lot of food - around 5lb of meat per day each. **It'll take about 4 days to fly to the rough oasis location** - so that's 40lb of meat! The Bag Of Holding is probably going to be getting a bit ripe by day 4...

We follow the carts out to the tower to check it out. To our surprise they bring along some tools to help clean and fix up a few things, in case we want to do that straight away. It takes an hour to reach the tower. In daylight, it's easy to see from some distance away; it's in the middle of a natural field but we beat a track through to it. Nothing much else is nearby.

There are stonemasons, carpenters... Candlekeep are certainly being very generous - they're even paying for it all. People get to work quickly - debris from the engines is removed (Candlekeep may well study it all - we don't mind either way). We help with both that and clearing out the various stacks of books. The basement is divided up into a few rooms including rooms that Arturo and Thorin want as bedrooms. The ground level is mostly open and communal with a kitchen off to the side. On the second floor off to the side is a space that can be divided into another couple of bedrooms with a big open communal space that can evolve over time. Up top, there's the observatory.

* We configure with washrooms, bedroom, kitchen, communal as above...
* We also might have:
  - Arcane Study (must be able to use an arcane focus or other spellcasting focus; roomy, comes with an assistant - "hireling"!)
  - Armoury (no prerequisites, roomy, another hireling)
  - and so-on - playtest rules; see external docs

...and we'll need to think on that. We at least make sure it's basically secure so we don't return from our adventures to find it full of squatters!

We have three days until we should get to the oasis location.

### Rest of day 18-20

D20s all round:

* Thorin 2
* Francesc 5
* Arturo 6
* Penny 7

...we spend a lot of time talking but a lot of time disagreeing! In the end we each acquire the equivalent of a single day of "calm", for research.

* Arturo cross-references more of the new maps and information against the Mere Of Dead Men map we had, thinking about the giants issue. Luck roll 14. The location of the Star Forge: A rough lead; communities from which the legends and tales of the Star Forge originated. They're in the **nation of Earl Kazar**, east of Tethyr. Tethyr is South of Amn. The communities around there - near the Culden Peaks and Cloven Mountains - seem to have a lot to say about this forge. **Morning Gold Keep** - a dwarven hold - and a human settlement, **Ilt Kazar**, are of particular interest.

* Francesc forages, happy to get into the nearby woods for a while. Survival 8 - the woods here are very different from the northern forests. Thorin, Survival 17. He realises that there are different types of plants that are different in these woods, but can be used in the same way. They figure out how to make a healing potion.

* Penny does some Palladin-ing. Persuasion 18. She tries to preach the message of Meliki - to not cut down the woods; in fact, maybe even plant trees around the tower.

We procure some meat for the griffons from town, get packed up and fly!

Towards the end of day 20, we each roll a D6 - **the number of Bastion Points we accumulate**:

* Arturo 6
* Francesc 6
* Thorin 5
* Penny 2

That evening, we're gathered in the tower when we hear a screech and thud. Two griffons land outside! They seem to make themselves comfortable by the wall of the tower.

While packing up our bags for tomorrow, Arturo discovers *fifteen potatoes* - he plants them outside.

### Day 21

We fly! We travel 80 miles (Rich D20->13, matches DM DC, no encounter). Thorin and Penny ride together up front. Survival adv., nat 20+5! The direction we travel is exactly right. Animal handling that night, adv., 22. Food goes well.

Watch:

* Arturo and Penny watch together, assisting each other with Perception: 16
* Thorin: 22
* Francesc (double watch - only needs 4 hours sleep): 18

### Day 22

After a brief ration-based breakfast we take off again. Thorin adv animal handling with Penny; 14 - the griffon is a bit grumpy; Arturo and Francesc, 16, it's OK.

Navigation is alright but not stellar today; Thorin adv survival 14. We get about 75 miles maybe towards our destination.

### Afternoon

Thorin D20->1, encounter! DM only rolled a 2, as well...

Disadv perception: Only Francesc with 16 sees it coming. Some birds flying strangely... Bats? No, not bats... Very far away - and very large. Dragons?! No - too small. **Drakes**. She shouts a warning and points to the ground, implying that we should land rather than trying to fight in the sky. Arturo survival, nat 1; we follow their griffon down - with no apparent destination in mind - but Penny survival 16, sees a clearing. She tries to urge the griffon to get past the other one, but animal handling is only 11. It doesn't really react. Probably not too happy with our high weight of Penny and Thorin!

Francesc sees they're still just out of range. Nature, 8; doesn't know what they are. Thorin, 19 - shouts, "Wyverns!" - poisonous stings.

It's a race.

Adv animal handling (Thorin assisting), Penny, 21; we stretch ahead. Francesc only 14; one wyvern begins to gain (15) while the others drop behind. It's still just 600ft away. We're around 300ft up and diving fast.

Next time around, the two slower wyverns drop back even further from Thorin and Penny, but (handling 14) the faster one (17) gains a bit. Francesc and Arturo fare even worse, with a second wyvern gaining ground, but this brings the fast one into firing range.

**Initiative**:

* Thorin 18
* Arturo 17
* Francesc 8
* Penny 5

Francesc initiates combat by firing, so goes before the above round. Favoured Foe but no time for Hunter's Mark; slugs cling to the arrow; 21 to hit, hits easily; *24 damage*.

The lead wyvern, after being hit, moves 160ft on its turn (full movement and dash). Roughly 440ft away.

Thorin uses Summon Beasts and a spirit animal appears, looking like a small griffon. It's summoned as far behind us as he can send it, in a defensive position; hovering and readying itself for an attack. Since we've been moving forwards on the griffon, It's about 360ft away from the lead wyvern.

Arturo flat animal handling 17+1 -> 18. He encourages the griffon to pretty much plunge directly downwards for the trees. It plunges 160ft and, given it was already descending, ends up only about 90ft above the ground. Arturo is planning Feather Fall.

The second wyvern closes in; it's almost within range of Francesc but she focuses on the first one again since, with the rapid plunge, they've pulled ahead and even that closer one is now 540ft away. She needs to aim carefully given the dynamics of the situation! The first attack just hits; 14 damage. The second hits more easily, the aim now practiced somewhat; and despite less stacking of features, again 14 damage.

The third wyvern (nat 20) catches up with the others and just gets within 600ft range.

Penny casts Bless on herself and can't do anything other than try to handle the griffon. Nat 1 on that roll, and nat 1 on the D4, so 7 total. It decides to dive directly down instead of heading for the clearing. It seems like it might be trying to knock us off. 160ft straight down. Unlike Arturo, *we* don't have Feather Fall... This brings us to within some 50ft of Francesc's intentionally-diving griffon.

The first wyvern continues to gain very quickly; swings mid-air to keep following Francesc's griffon down; it's around 300ft away again now.

Thorin, recognising the predicament, offers the Help action to Penny to try and get the griffon to pull out of the dive. His animal spirit is now about 300ft away from the closest Wyvern, and Thorin instructs it to fly to intercept - a full 120ft.

Arturo is 90ft off the ground and wants to pull up his griffon, zoom past; animal handling 17. The griffon pulls out of its dive and is 15ft off the ground. He gets it to land. He looks up to the Penny and Thorin plummeting down and gets ready to react with Feather Fall if it looks like they'll crash!

For sake of simplicity we say wyvern 1 is now 400ft from them and wyvern 2 is 420ft away. Francesc continues to attack the first one. 26 to hit, 22 damage. It's looking rough, finally. Fires again; 13; *just* hits... but it's only 7 damage. It's still coming!

Wyvern 3 is 440ft away.

Penny using help from Thorin, 4,16+5->21. She regains control of the griffon and, like Arturo and Francesc, it lands - but heavily. Thorin dex save 21 (with aura), Penny only 6 - falls off and is prone.

Wyvern 1 closes to 240ft of Francesc/Arturo / 220ft of Penny/Thorin, but within 40ft of his fey spirit. Thorin readies Flaming Arrows for if his creature is taken out; then gets it to attack - but unfortunately it misses.

Wyvern 2 closes to 240/260ft. It's 20ft from the fey beast, since that's attacking the slightly-ahead wyvern 1.

Francesc keeps up her assault but Arturo has called out that he's got a fireball prepped for wyvern 1, so she goes for wyvern 2. 14, just hit - 16 damage. Second with the -5 attack -> +10 damage Sharpshooter thing - 22 effective, easy hit. Total damage is 19.

Wyvern 3 closes to 260/280ft.

Penny stands up, sticks with the griffon. She sees the wyverns approaching quickly; she readies her circlet for Scorching Ray, for if any of them get within 120ft range while still alive.

Wyvern 1 is diving towards Penny's griffon, but as it departs Thorin's beast spirit's range it gets an opportunity attack and hits (20); damage 1d8+4+3, 13 total. It gets within 150ft of Arturo - 130ft from Penny - triggering his fireball. Potential damage 27, DC 16 dex save; it fails and is incinerated. Wild magic D100->2. He feels the dimension he's in fracture somehow - for the next 10 turns a wild magic surge will happen each time! The rest of us just hear Arturo say - "uh-oh..."

Thorin never got to trigger his arrow spell. He sees the falling wyvern carcass and avoids it! His spirit beast manages to intercept wyvern 2 and attacks; but misses.

Arturo D100->41; reality warps around Arturo **and he turns into a potted plant**. A bowl of petunias, of course.

Wyvern 2 is distracted by the spirit beast and attacks it. Its claws rake across; 19 hits; 13 damage. Then its stinger comes around, but attack is only 10 and it doesn't hit. The wyvern then carries on flying away, causing an opportunity attack - nat 20! 2d8+7 -> another 16 damage. It's within 100ft of Francesc, Arturo and Thorin, 80ft of Penny. Scorching ray triggers. Two of the three hit, doing a total of 18 damage.

Francesc sees that and fires at the same target. She's just out of range for hunter's mark, so runs forward a bit to get a little closer; just inside 90ft, Hunter's Mark is cast. Attack for 25 hits, damage 16. Second attack, with the -5/+10 - effective 14, hits; 22 damage. It's still *just* hanging on!

Wyvern 3 closes to 110ft of Francesc, 120ft of Thorin & Arturo, 100ft of Penny. But Wyvern 2 is directly below, 20ft down. Penny casts Moonbeam centred on Wyvern 2, so the beam hits both. DC16 con save; wyvern 3 fails its save and the damage it will take at the start of its next turn is a maximum 2d10->20. Wyvern 2 saves but has so few hit points that it will be taken out at the start of its next turn (except Arturo kills it with a fireball anyway a fraction of a second later - see below).

Thorin casts Flame Arrows for Francesc and activates his staff.

Arturo suddenly turns back into himself! D100->38. **The same four flumphs* from last time appear; take one look at Arturo, scream and scatter in all directions. Wyvern 3 is 120ft away from him; he can catch Wyvern 2 as well - fireball! 38 damage, which Wyvern 3 takes all damage. Wyvern 2 is destroyed. He runs a little along the ground under wyvern 3 and starts shouting insults at it!

Francesc (acro 21) deftly dodges the falling carcass of Wyvern 2, then actually jumps on top of it to get exactly within 90ft (DM fiat) of Wyvern 3 and with -5/+10 shoots; just gets the hit; with all the toys added including flaming arrows, 35 damage. The second attack, same risky strategy, easily hits; 26 damage.

On Wyvern 3's turn, the moon beam incinerates it! But now it's carcass is falling towards Arturo who had chosen to run under it. Dex save 9. Tides of chaos - 10. Splat. 18 bludgeoning damage! He's prone and restrained.

"I say we just leave him there. He's done for" says Penny.

A muffled voice from under the dead wyvern says "I've got it right where I want it".

A series of bizarre magical effects occur under the wyvern carcass as D100 -> wild magic events occur. For a moment his skin turns blue; Penny meanwhile has gone over to pull him out. In a burst of strength (athl 20 (!) + 6 -> 26) she *lifts* the wyvern body off Arturo, seeing but being unfazed by his blue skin; she takes the wyvern over to her griffon and drops it down, as if an offering.

Arturo runs over to a nearby stream to keep distance from us "just in case". Thorin helps heal him at a distance via Healing Spirit, for 2, initially. Wild magic surges continue; 80. His blue skin sprouts blue butterflies that start spiralling around him. Penny gets the cask from the bag of holding and pours a flagon. Francesc joins in.

Francesc realises (nature 16) that the poison is only in the tail. If we chop that off, it's safe to eat. She does that to one carcass; Penny attack dirty 20, chops the tail off near her griffon.

Arturo heals for 2; next thinks he has some kind of control over things around him; as if saving throw spells would work better than normal. Heals for 4; then the butterflies disappear and he's standing in a puddle of grease - in the river. Oh. Heals for 6. D100 again; 49, he feels a burp or maybe a laugh coming - no sound comes out, though, but pink bubbles do, floating away on the breeze. More healing, then the next wild surge sort of cancels the first (a speech issue that conflicts with the bubbles). Another D100; he feels a surge of empowerment... In addition to the saving throw thing, he thinks any spell would cause maximum damage.

Reality reasserts, but it takes about a minute for all the related effects to subside. He lies down!

**After a while, we all notice his skin is still blue! It seems - well, permanent. Some kind of benign curse perhaps.**

We decide to call it a day! At least the griffons have plenty to eat. As do we! It's not bad, in fact. We set up camp. Arturo at least gets to join in with the flagons of ale.

Under Thorin's direction we try to get poison from the tales into glass vials; with Penny's help, nature dirty 20. He's confident in the process. Francesc has the best dexterity - 3 SOH checks, all DCs 15 are met. That means we have 3 vials of wyvern poison! (7d6 damage if used correctly and worth 1200gp each).

We fill all water bottles (upstream of the oil!)

* Arturo and Penny watch together, assisting each other with Perception: 1,5+2->7! A pack of wolves is drawn in by the smell of dead wyvern. They gather at the edge of the camp fire radius. Penny decides to feed them bits of leftovers - animal handling adv. 15,19+5->24; they hang out, helping protect the camp.
* Thorin: With advantage from wolves - 14. He's confident in the wolves and reads a book instead!
* Francesc (double watch - only needs 4 hours sleep): With advantage from wolves, 22. No problems.

### Day 23

The griffons fill their boots on wyvern and won't need to eat again. The wolves can have the rest. They become very friendly - *almost* cute, but they're bit and certainly wild! - but we have to move on.

Penny assists Thorin again on directions; survival 14, like the previous day. Again, a bit off, but not terrible. 75 miles. D20 encounter roll (Arturo) 15. The day is uneventful, but he does get a strange feeling that we're entering into an area where, **were we not protected by our amulets, we might be watched - scrying**. A strange, oppressive presence. He's not sure what it means.

The area here is no longer woods or forest; it's patchy scrub, bare earth between. In the distance we see a huge mountain range running from the coast inwards, getting craggier and higher, with some at the very edge of vision look like they might have a red glow - volcanic!

* Arturo and Penny watch together, assisting each other with Perception: 3,13->15.
* Thorin: 17.
* Francesc (double watch - only needs 4 hours sleep): 25.

### Day 24

Hopefully this is our last leg. Thorin adv Survival 18, we're back on target. Penny animal handling, adv as we have spare meat even though they're mostly full - 16,17+5->22. She pushes them to go an extra half hour, to make up for being a few miles short the previous day, but that helps us track to the correct location on foot.

For the last 50 miles or so of the journey we're flying over pretty much desert with bits of scrub. There is soft rumbling audible from the distant volcanoes now.

The griffons eat a bit more food if they want, then send them on their way, back out of the desert.

We set up camp. We are probably only an hour away from our rough expected location and we've got a full day to plan tomorrow.

(End of part 21)
