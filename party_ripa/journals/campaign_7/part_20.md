# RIPA: Part 20
## Session 20 (2023-10-24)
### Day 17, around midday

After the ghostly excitement in the Firefly Library, we have awoken late to exciting news; Francesc has been granted access to the archives beyond the emerald gates, and can bring us through with her.

We get to the tavern for a very late breakfast! We recap everything that's happened. Seems like we *might* find the book that Xemru Thal left here, behind the gates; that might explain why Mayastan suddenly left.

We're admitted. The door opens. It's not a room - this was just a wall with a gate; an open space behind; another courtyard, but this one has various raised levels at different heights with steps leading up. The centre has (of course) a fountain and statue.

Penny collars someone to ask about our researcher, Tamra - if they're here, they can help us. There are couple of options; religion, or myths/history. We figure maybe our researcher is focusing on the view that the All Seeing Eye isn't a myth, but is in fact real - albeit considered by some a religion or even a cult; so we go in the direction indicated for religion. When we walk inside there's a clear boundary effect from some sort of spell; outside sounds are silenced immediately. It's dim light here but not dark - not using flames. We get the feeling you're meant to take those with you when venturing deeper into the tower.

Francesc (investigation 16) looks to see if there's a librarian around. A floor up someone is pushing a trolley with books. She heads up and asks about Tamra; we're in luck; we're told she's in "room 216". She points the way, over a fairly dramatic sky bridge. Beyond, many small rooms; 216 says "Closed". Francesc peeks around the corner - Tamra is there, fast asleep, head on a pile of books!

Penny - perception 1+2 (!) -> 3, they seem to be books... Francesc looks on the *spine* side. These are books about oracles generally and, one in particular, the worship of Savras. While we try to be quiet, Penny stealth 7-1->6, Francesc 18, Thorin 13, Arturo 22. She wakes up and jumps! Francesc dex 25 moves out the way as she leaps back.

We apologise, but then explain about Xemru Thal and Mayastan. 3-4 weeks ago, we say; that means "unfiled" - which was where Mayastan works. We explain a bit more about our history with this group; *her* reading of the books is certainly not that they're "good", just very _very_ neutral. Arturo asks if they believe in amassing personal power. Tamra isn't sure. She does know that they believe they, and they alone know the true future of the universe; and they're not afraid to "nudge" things - violently if necessary! - should people or events apparently not be going 'to plan'.

We could try and find out what books Mayastan read before leaving; or start with the book Xemru Thal brought in. We figure the latter - start with the source; Francesc helps, investigation 6,6 (aww) +8 -> 14. It takes a while, then; she's never been in this library before, so fair enough. The path leads to a different tower and we're shown a room full of tables stacked deep with unfiled books! Maybe some 250 books.

It's too many to check individually and we're not even sure what we're looking for. We need to ask about how these books come in - what notes are made. Penny, persuasion 20+7->27! We get taken to the 'entry register', a tome going back months; but we know a rough date range. The register has a name of a petitioner, name of the reader and the name of book. While Francesc searches, Penny looks over her shoulder - perception 17+2->19. It's written in terrible handwriting and hard to spot, but there's Xemru Thal. The book was brought in by reader **Aarodestar**; it's called **"The Canopic Being"**.

We're told Aarodestar might be asleep right now, so we divide the room into four and try to find the book from the spines. Francesc investigation 27; scans all the books very quickly. It's not there. Thorin, 21; not in his pile either. Arturo 8, Penny 5; we need help! Francesc helps Arturo and - not sure how it was missed! - finds the book, which is very large and looks like it's made of crystal. "Is that a book?!" says Arturo. Set into the spine is a row of emeralds and on each emerald is etched a letter of the book name. On the front, it's etched in illuminated script; and in the cover, is probably the largest emerald Thorin has ever seen. It must be worth at least 50,000 gold pieces.

So - what the hell even *is* this?

Arturo and Francesc open it but the librarians object; it's unfiled! Can they file it now?! Persuasion, Arturo with Penny's help, dirty 20. They tell us to go and read it so they can file it for us...

...OK, we take the book to a table. We open it - and, it appears to be in... We're not sure. Penny tries to persuade a librarian for help - 25 - the same person as earlier. Amnian, we're told. It's a dialect of Common but not a close one. This person luckily specialises in it! They flip through hum-ing and ha-ing. Arturo prompts for an explanation.

"What a strange book! This bit here is weird histories of a land that I don't think is real... Hold on... It's called **Tashluta**..." (rough Common pronunciation) "...a capital city in a mythical place in Amnian history. The region is **Tashalar**. A page or two later, the reader visibly shudders. There are diagrams on that page, but they look like dissection diagrams of a humanoid body! The next page seems worse, and then pages are flipped faster and faster. "What *is* this book?!" There are markings written in another script, Common we see, along some of the margins; and in a very different hand in Elvish, too. Francesc reads things like "Alive? How alive?", "Yes, possible", "This step first", "This should be easy", "Maybe this is the first step" and so-on... It's basically horrifying. A full description of the rituals, dissections and transplantations required to move body parts - hearts, lungs, eyes, kidneys - between humanoids, from a donor to recipients. **The book is apparently an entire ritual book about achieving a form of immortality through this process.** High level rituals must be cast each time. It's not a lich manual, but has similar feel; **Thorin arcana 21, it's a process for creating a rare elevated form of a mummy lord**.

If the heart of a mummy lord is safe somewhere, then if the mummy is destroyed it will reform next to the heart. Again, very like a lich, but they transplant multiple organs in others and you'd need destroy *all* such organs to kill the being, but it seems the heart is still the most important one. If that's destroyed there's no way to come back.

The ritual describe that the beings receiving these body parts, other than the heart, will be transformed. They're turned into servants of the mummy lord and their physical forms will start to change in time, into crystalline forms much as described in the book.

The reader has backed away from it. "I don't want to keep reading this. This is... This makes me very uncomfortable..." - and then runs.

Arturo can't read the book but flips through to literally look at pictures. Maybe there's a map?! But no maps. Just more rituals and diagrams. On the very last page, written as a note in Common, which Francesc reads over Arturo's shoulder - a list of names:

* Alessia Baseer
* Xemru Thal
* Zeren Zoradius
* Okuzor
* **Mayastan Sadaar**
* Thorin Beastcaller
* Francesc Icefrond
* Penny Jones
* Arturo Rey

...and the list seems to have been written in one person's handwriting, relatively recent, all written at the same time.

Solemn silence for a while.

Arturo breaks the silence. He suggests that the city named as an old Amnian capital *might* be the place we're looking for. Mythology/history section! Before we leave we make a copy of the names, check with the librarians but they only know of Mayastan, give the them the book back - it'll be filed under **Necromancy** - and head over to the other library tower.

Various sections... We pick Realms, can't find much and ask for help. We're pointed into a general area and Arturo with Francesc's help finds one book, that mentions Tashalar. We're allowed to check it out of the library so we take it to the other tower and room 216. Tamra's away but the books are still there, so we settle in and look through the book.

Francesc investigation 9; barely recognises the language. Penny perception 21 doesn't recognise the language *at all* but she *does* see one of many maps that looks like some parts are familiar; we stop there; Francesc looks closely. A reference at the edge of the map has a name of a settlement towards the South-West. Francesc recognises it as an ancient name for the city of Amn, based on everything else we've now seen. **A reference point**. An oasis is marked out as an area, "the oasis of Tashluta", though it's a little general and hard to pinpoint. On the Northern edge of the same map is a large area of rolling plains and low hills, not many marks, but there's a Western edge coastline. If we try to make a copy we might be able to cross-reference that with a real map.

There are what might be instructions and directions in old Amnian on a nearby page, so we mark that and keep looking to see if there are any other interesting things. Some 30 pages seem to cover different types of clothing! Then there's one that Francesc is sure is recipes. We'll take the old Amnian script back to the other librarian - still freaked out but this one is less scary! - Arturo + Penny, persuasion 25. Thorin arcana 24, some of the instructions are *arcane* - the place is protected by a permanent spell of hallucinatory terrain. It's only visible at a certain time of the day, during a certain phase of the moon - the "Trickster Moon" - and approaching from a specific direction.

We check outside! It's about a half moon. Francesc will know in one more night if it's waxing or waning, but Thorin nature check 21, assesses it and figures **we have about 8 days until that moon. If we missed that, about 2 days later would be another opportunity.**

Francesc has been trying to find maps (investigation 12) but no dice. Penny gives her some crap about that - how hard can it be?! - and tries herself; investigation 2-1 -> 1. Meanwhile, Arturo heads out of the emerald gates, finds a shop in the main courtyard and buys a map! 5gp. It's a good one, too, with a wide coverage that'll help us in matters well beyond our current problem.

It's late; a full day of investigation. Food o'clock.

We get to the tavern. Penny gets drinks (20cp for all of us). We need to correlate Arturo's map with the copy we made of the map book. There are some similar shapes along the coastline, tho it's not exact - main peninsulas match up.

Thorin (passive perception 18) overhears in Dwarven a not-so-quiet conversation about "...what a fucking mess this whole transfer has been!" - a grumble about Stonky's leadership. Penny shouts over her shoulder at the Dwarven table, "Are you any good with maps?!" - but is ignored (Thorin thinks he'll head over but ends up being caught up with the map too in practice, while Francesc keeps working on the map). After some improvisation, her and Arturo (with the help of a leather tie from Penny's armour as a measuring device) figure out a rough ratio of 3:7 for the map scale. Hmm. To do this accurately, we need a cartographer! Arturo asks around the room; persuasion 24. They want to be paid in drinks! As many as it takes them to pass out... It's a halfling; so long as they do the map first, OK...!

The halfling has cartographer's tools. He takes time measuring things up, then (with our permission) starts making up things on the expensive map. Pretty soon the location of the oasis is written down.

Onto drinks. We opt to start with the strong stuff first! Dwarven Brandy, 2sp each. We get four! As it happens - he passes out on the second drink (rolled nat 1). Penny and Thorin take the other two. "Cheers!" Con saves - Thorin 21, Penny 25! Francesc wanted one so she goes and gets her own, grumpily; con save 11; she's drunk.

We try to get rid of the effects of alcohol with food.

The halfling marked up distances; we don't know about difficult terrain, but we figure the distance from Candlekeep to Tashluta is about 220 miles. But the distance from Amn is only 120 miles.

Arturo persuasion 18 asks if there's anyone from Amn at the tavern. There was someone recently, but not any more. Maybe the readers? Mayastan is from Amn, we're told! Thorin suggests we go to speak to the now-rather-scared-of-us librarian in Unfiled. They're just finishing up their shift. "What is it?! What do you want?!" We explain. They *are* distantly from Amn, but haven't been there in many years.

Penny thinks that if we're going to find a way to teleport to Amn, then we could spend another day or two at Candlekeep safely researching more about the liches. Penny gets a physical description of Mayastan from the librarian just in case he didn't make it in time for the previous moon cycle (so we might bump into him near Amn). Finally, although it's late we return to the tavern since Thorin decides he *does* want to talk to the dwarves.

Thorin brings drinks. Awkward smalltalk happens. Thorin: Persuasion adv 1,2+1->3! They're not opening up to his charms... Penny perception 12, looks fine. Thorin talks about getting into the library via the battle, they get really irate, Penny perception 20, she heads over and tries to smooth things over but persuasion is only 13. The conversation goes to-and-fro but we do find out that they don't know anything about why Mayastan left. At one point they seem to mention something they shouldn't tho, about the "barn door"; Penny persuasion dirty 20 tries to convince them to open up, but it's not helping much; Thorin insight 20, the younger are wanting to leave but the older, Buron, is almost about to talk. As the two start to leave, Thorin convinces Buron to stay for more drinks. "Brandy!" says Thorin; "Oh shit," mutters Penny.

Penny con save: only 10. Very drunk. Francesc joins us, having recovered a bit from before (nat 20) -> handles it well. Thorin adv., 7,17. He's OK. Buron says "They kinda have a point, but they just see things in a - certain way. Radicalised youths! I used to subscribe to that but I'm beginning to... I had a health scare recently. Very different view on life now. Life's too short!" (slurring - "YOU had a health scare!" says Penny).

Thorin tries to convince Buron to talk. Adv.persuasion 20 but it's not enough. Stonky is the "chief engineer" and maybe has been radicalising people - at the "barn door" - is one of the more run-down looking towers. Short. Five-storey. Painted red door, looks like a barn door. "Stonky has been coming up with these plans... Mainly based around how most of the Readers he says are unworthy of the knowledge in these books - he's kinda taken advantage of the shuffling of the books; he's taken advantage of that to move some of his - well, I think his favourites! - into the Barn Door. It's still in the library so not a crime, but he's collecting them."

"What would be the chances of reading some of those?!"

"Get to the Barn Door. Don't know why you'd want to though. Bad poetry, gnomish soft-core (!) - honestly I don't think it's important stuff."

"But why?"

"I don't know. He's collecting them. He must have some kind of plan. I can't say any more than that!"

There might be *one* book that's interesting... Buron will try to get it to us. Thorin buys him another drink! Buron says he'll get the book now, so we wait.

Half an hour passes. We're starting to get nervous when the tavern door opens - Buron comes in, red-faced as if recently running - looks to us, clutching a book, he topples over on top of the book! Face plants. Penny medicine check. No pulse! Penny tries to push some healing into him, but it seems his heart has just given out. Thorin takes the book while Penny tries to bring him back... Another medicine check, dirty 20. It seems the only thing that would bring him back now would be something beyond revivification.

"I'm sorry, he's gone" she says, sadly.

People gather around. "I told him he had to stay away from the hard stuff!" says the bartender then asks if anyone knows Resurrection. Nope, only Revivify. We carry him outside and someone is sent to fetch the Prime Reader. Another request is made to get someone from the Engineering Corps, as he's "one of them". Francesc tries to figure out *why* he was running, insight 24; perhaps he got caught. He was bringing the book out of the library.

Healers and the Prime Reader arrive, gathering around him. Penny and Thorin stay with the Prime Reader to hear what they're saying, while Francesc and Arturo sneak off to the research room to read it.

The book is "Candlekeep Deconstruction" but all the 'c's are replaced with 'k's! "**Kandlekeep Dekonstruktion**". It is written by **Isajar**, a former Keeper Of Tomes. The book is bound in a black leather cover with red lettering, with what we think is an engineering corps logo embossed in gold. Crisp white pages, square, but well-used (it's been read a lot), full of diagrams, maps and descriptions of all the locations in Candlekeep from an engineering and architect perspective. The pages most used are a particular building that looks like the Barn Door with drawings of things built into it. The Barn Door appears to go a long way underground; it has things to the side which looks like the break off? And maybe massive *engines* inside at the basement?!

Meanwhile, Penny and Thorin listen in. Shock and mourning. "One of the good ones, always there!" says someone. Nobody seems aware of where he was running from; someone saw him come from the library and people did see that he was holding a book. This causes consternation. "Ask those two!" someone says. Penny catches the eye of the Prime Speaker. She accosts him for not letting the engineers be readers. "I didn't know he wanted to be a reader! He never said!" - but then they ask us about what happened to the book. Penny feigns ignorance, but deception 14 isn't enough. Thorin gives in tells the whole story. Penny joins in to back up the story.

We guess that Arturo and Francesc went to our reading room, so traipse over there accompanied by Prime Reader. We get inside. Francesc manages to convince the Prime Reader that she used her new 'reader powers' to keep it safe! But we do show the Reader that this building is quite significant, not just an abandoned tower.

We all exit down to the courtyard. Buron is being loaded onto a stretcher. **Dex saves**!

* Penny 21
* Francesc 18
* Thorin 17
* Arturo only 7

...the ground is shaking. A loud rumbling. Then there's an almighty crash, extremely loud and what looks pretty much like a fireball and plume of smoke flash up and spill over the wall of the emerald gate as a stubby-looking tower with a red barn door starts to fly up into the sky.

Pretty much everyone watches, speechless.

"See? This is what happens when you ignore your engineers and don't let them become Readers..." says Penny.

There's confused conversation as people try to figure out what's going on. Thorin and Francesc can't make out (low perception rolls) where the tower might be going. At least Francesc knows enough about projectiles to recognise that it doesn't have a trajectory to get into the sky - it's tipping over already and starting to flatten out; it'll go a fair distance but probably crash.

People have rapidly found out that *all* the Candlekeep engineers have gone!

"Can you levitate that? Or at least teleport in there to save people?" asks Penny, horrified.

*We* can. We have the helm and the book. Arturo also has Feather Fall. We ask how many engineers there were... 4, 12, 8, at least 20! They've no idea. There's no more time for discussion... Thorin and Arturo teleport. We ask for horses; Thorin will be at the village, but Arturo will be falling a long way away. At this point, someone says, "What are you talking about, horses?!" and Francesc and Penny are shown Griffons!

Dex save for Thorin & Arturo, landing on a heavily angled floor. Thorin 22, grabs Auturo (10) just before he tips out of a window - as a few books tumble off a nearby shelf and out of that same window. Worse, not only is this tower tilted, it's spinning; it seems this was a hurried take-off that wasn't done properly. All around are people grabbing onto stair bannisters, each other, even furniture - but all of it it's sliding around, mostly towards windows. One table flips up and blocks that window, but the rotation means that's not going to hold long. There is panic.

Thorin calls to try and convince more to come to this floor; Arturo casts Fly and tries to find more. Stairs up, stairs down. He goes up. A room full of boxes of books, not unpacked, all slid against a wall in a pile. Three very frightened gnomes are hanging off curtains, one wrapped up in one! "Find him! What's Stonky doing? Why is he not setting it right? He must be up in the control room!"

Arturo uses a piece of furniture to block the window. "Two of you! That way, get to the dwarf..." - meanwhile on the floor below, Thorin casts Conjure Animals. A collection of giant bats appear, instructing them to grab people. "The bats are safe! Don't worry!" shouts Thorin. The six on this level are taken out - not necessarily willingly! - out of the remaining window on this floor. Very carefully - avoiding debris to keep his spell concentration and not drop the gnomes and dwarves now in flight! - he tries to get the two other bats to help him - and seeing Arturo going up, he goes down.

Down, there's a room with lots of maze-like corners, very strange and a bright glowing core. An engine room. The whole thing is double height. Pipes lead to four engines which appear to be ejecting a series of fireballs; an extraordinary site; it's catwalks and empty space below, the fire from the engines hard to look at directly. Two are hanging off a catwalk while another is grabbing around with dark glasses on, hands on the ground looking for something. "Leave it Stonky! Leave it!", one of the hanging-on people is shouting. Thorin asks "What are you looking for?" "My ring! I'm looking for my ring!" - Thorin perception 20. A ring is bouncing down along a catwalk. He orders the other bat to go for it. Dex for bat 12, it can't quite do it; Thorin considers having his bat let him go, so he can land on the catwalk to grab the ring himself. After a moment of uncertainty he commands the bat to let go; dex save; 3+3->6. Annoying. He misses the catwalk, landing on a nearby wall instead. 3 points damage; con save to hold the spell; 23; spell is up. At least the ring rolls down off the catwalk and pretty much falls into his hand!

Thorin stows the ring in a pocket and shouts "I've got it! We need to get out of here. I can teleport you out!" Stonky says "I'm not leaving the tower! I can save it... These books... I need to start a new Candlekeep! This is my purpose!" The other gnomes try to convince him that this is a terrible idea. It's taking too long - Thorin gives up and tries to cast Charm Person on Stonky. The other two are assisted by bats, grabbed and flown up to Arturo's level. Thorin asks how many there are here; **16 engineers**. So 6 went down with bats. 3 down on the engine level. 3 on Arturo's level; 4 are unaccounted for - presumably higher up.

On Arturo's floor, two giant bats come up from pretty much nowhere (from Arturo's perspective), carrying a dwarf and short human! Arturo asks the same question. This leaves Stonky in the engine room with Thorin. Arturo hears that there are two more floors. He flies up. The top floor is an observatory - sky visible - terrifying view in fact! One person cowers in a corner, a halfling. There's a control chair, but Stonky put magic sigils on it so only he can operate it. The halfling doesn't know why Stonky isn't up here, getting the tower upright so it can properly land as planned. Arturo convinces him to get down to the floor below; collects two more on the floor immediately below; he flies all the way down to the engine room.

Stonky, despite advantage, can't make the save (WIS 16) and falls under Thorin's charm. "We need to right the ship!" he says. "Get me to my control room! I need my ring. I need the ring to activate the controls!" and not many seconds after this, Arturo arrives. He tries to convince Thorin that the books are worth saving; he twins Fly, the two of them (carrying Stonky) go all the way back *up* the tower, shouting something encouraging as they pass the collection of people clinging on in the middle floor, but then Thorin shouts that he'll get some out safe. He hands the ring to Arturo, gets the two bats - one to take Stonky to the observatory, another to take one of the nine on the floor; that leaves 8, and Thorin can teleport all of those away.

(Distantly giving chase but losing ground on their griffons, Penny and Francesc see the first set of bats fleeing the tower then, quite a few seconds later, one more; but we don't know anything else that's going on).

Halflings, gnomes, a dwarf and a half-orc gather around as best they can and agree they want to leave. Thorin doesn't waste time - he opens the portal and everyone tumbles out into the village tavern outside Candlekeep, at around 10:30pm! There's a conservation of momentum issue; people tumble and crash around the room as they kept their movement from the rocket.

So now, there's a giant bat, Arturo and Stonky heading up to the observatory. Arturo - arcana check on the ring - only 7. It's a magic item! Thorin, meanwhile, tells everyone to get back to Candlekeep ASAP; and then casts his third and final helm portal to return to the rocket - except he realises the Deconstructed book has vanished; Candlekeep anti-theft?! - but he has Stonky's ring, so *that* has to make do as a teleportation focus. It works, Thorin appearing down in the engine room, so flies up to the observatory to join the others.

The plan is to try and save the rocket. Thorin checks the ring as well; arcana 22; it is "Stonky's Ring", an item which allows one to cast Telekinesis. Like a very powerful Mage Hand. Thorin asks "how does it work? Can *we* land this?" - then Stonky starts describing what levers do. Thrust, angle, rotation... But you can't touch any of it because of the Ward. In fact if *anyone* - Stonky included - touches levers, the chair would explode. The ring is needed for anyone, then. "Ah, so you'd need Telekinesis" says Thorin. Stonky looks quizzical; "yes..." - he isn't sure how Thorin knows. Mage Hand seems like it would be strong enough too, though.

The rocket is now roughly horizontal. Its flight time is very limited. It's surprising the tower is even still intact at this point! Thorin is torn, he wants to keep the ring, but Stonky is attuned to it. After a very brief discussion Arturo elects to try the controls via Mage Hand. D20+spell casting ability. 22. He rapidly moves levers as quickly as he can, seeing as fast as he can what the results of each one are. At least he understands how Fireballs work! It helps a bit. There's a lot of swaying around as the rocket moves in response; con saves all round. Arturo 26, all good. Thorin 14, queasy but he's OK; however, Stonky, being held by Thorin now rather than the bat, pukes all over the floor.

It's quite a feat - concentrating on the twinned Fly, managing to manipulate the levers effectively, not getting sick or disorientated; eventually, it's upright and starts to descend. Francesc and Penny see to their astonishment the strange series of movements it makes, then its seemingly-impossible descent.

A full 15 minutes after departing Candlekeep, and quite a long way away now, the tower finally lands... But not nicely. It crashes heavily into the ground, vertically but very heavily. The Fly spell expires just before the landing; dex saves, Thorin 19, Arturo 14 - falls over but only with bruised pride. Arturo is pleased with how very upright it is. They venture down now to the lower floors, looking for books on the way. Perception - Thorin 16, Arturo 15. A few crates are unopened, but there are piles of Gnomes Illustrated (!) and other stuff that's generally not too valuable. There are a few history books, though, and one or two look quite interesting - Advanced Alchemy, a book on some kind of Mechanics, "Arcane Combustion Engines" - things that would be interesting to someone who wanted to fly the tower. So there's a lot of junk, but some of it's worthwhile.

These would all be in the Candlekeep register; it's probably not worth taking everything. Sadly, the entire bottom floor, the engine room floor, is missing; shattered, just crushed down. No more flying! The tower is here to stay. It looks like it could be stabilised with the old second floor as the new first floor!

The griffons finally catch up. Too many crates of books to carry; we think all we can do is leave them. People from Candlekeep are surely not far behind.

As we leave the tower, Thorin mentions that the Candlekeep Deconstructed book disappeared from his grasp after teleporting to the tavern. It seems that books "teleport themselves" to be still in the library. We figure that the books that fell out of the window probably went back to Candlekeep and it means that theft before Candlekeep people recover the books in the tower ought to be essentially impossible.

We figure out how to distribute people on the griffons so they can still fly. Just.

Back at Candlekeep, it's all arguments. Accusations back and forth. Stonky, though, is stripped of his Chief Engineer title. The others are forgiven for their part, Stonky - while still charmed! - agreeing to "take the fall". To honour Buron, there will be a new building called "Buron's Library" built where the Barn Door used to stand. At Penny's insistence, the Readers agree - begrudgingly - that while we won't all be made Readers, we can enter and leave at will in future (but only Francesc can enter past the Gate and of course we always must follow the rules).

Everyone's exhausted, and head off to bed.



### Day 18

That morning, a decision is made by the Candlekeep staff that it's just too hard to recover the Barn Door. Instead, carts are sent out - it's an hour's ride or so - to start collecting books before wards are removed to "disconnect" that tower from the library. **Then, to our surprise, we're handed a hastily written deed for the Barn Door to use and look after on behalf of Candlekeep.**

We own a tower!

Arturo pushes his luck - successfully! - and convinces them to let us have two griffons to fly to our next destination quickly. They can fly themselves back. *Now* we are sure we can safely reach our estimated location of what might once have been - or in illusion, still is - "the oasis of Tashluta".

(End of part 20)
