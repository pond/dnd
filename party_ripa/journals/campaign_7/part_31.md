# RIPA: Part 31
## Session 31 (2024-02-27)
### Underdark, towards the end of day 31

We are camping a safe distance from the shores of the great underground lake. Across it, likes our target - the city of **Gracklstugh**. We intend to cross the water tomorrow.

Perception, disadv without darkvision:

* Arturo (disadv) 15
* Penny (disadv) 4!
* Thorin 25
* Francesc 26 (nat 20)

There is little issue overnight as camp, thanks to keeping away from the shore. Penny sleeps soundly. Everyone else have trouble sleeping; something is hovering at the edge of dreams...? There's a strange sense of glee. Not happiness or joy; it's rather more unbound - almost maniacal. When they wake, it feels like there's been a rather tiring experience! It's still a long rest but people feel not as, say, sharp as usual.



## Day 32

We wake up. Penny says "oh my goodness, it's so *quiet* down here! I haven't slept so well in ages!" - Arturo mentions his bad dreams and hypothesises that maybe it's something from the city. Thorin feels the same. Francesc is particularly uncomfortable. Penny wonders if the dreams are connected to the way that people were going kinda crazy (or so we were told) in the city.

Thorin casts Water Breathing via ritual - it lasts 24 hours, just in case! We can all breathe underwater now - even the guide.

We descend to the lake shore. The air smells and feels colder. It might even be a bit misty. Thorin & Francesc via darkvision can see in the distance a bit of movement around, but faint; stealthy things; rising out from the lake are columns of rock (stalactites and stalagmites that have joined) that create a strange "made of sponge" kind of effect inside this space. The lake is eerily still. A lack of light makes it very hard to judge any distances.

Our guide leads us all the way to the shore. "I can take you to a ferry, but I'm not getting on the ferry!" Arturo asks, "Why not?" "I don't need to be in Gracklstugh..." - Arturo insight 19. He doesn't want to be caught there. Something about the docks? Arturo tries to persuade him to explain. Persuasion nat 1 + 11 -> 12, but Penny is helping via translation, and she luckily rolls 19+8 -> 27. This is not our guide's usual way into the city! The docks are a rough place. That's the only place foreigners are allowed. He "may or may not have" crossed other traders in his career and doesn't want to meet them again! He agrees to get on the boat, take us there, but won't get off the boat. We pay him at the dock. He won't disembark.

He starts to walk along the lake edge, apparently looking for something in particular, but can't find it. Penny asks. "I usually have a friend here who can ferry me over; he has a boat with a cabin. I can't find him anywhere. He doesn't seem to be here! The boat is called **The Plum**". Arturo elects to ask around. We search. Thorin, perception 27; around one of the rocky outcrops he spots a boat that has a cover / cabin, but it seems to be run aground. He points to it - the guide says that's the right boat, so we head over to investigate.

Francesc (INT-based check, 19) sees a hole in the boat and figures out that it doesn't look like it was caused by running around. There are big sucker marks on the side of the boat! A plank across the middle has been punched through. It's broken in three parts. Arturo starts using Mending to try and fix those up, as the breaks are quite small. It only takes a few minutes; the boat is lake-worthy again - but we have no navigator and, apparently, a giant octopus/squid risk!

The guide can point the way. It needs rowing. We push it into the water. Penny has a go at rowing - ATHL 21. Arturo prepares some ropes to lash Thorin to the boat should we need a quick getaway - he could turn into a large swimming creature and pull the boat quickly. He casts Pass Without A Trace; the boat leaves no wake or ripples. Arturo puts up Mage Armour. Francesc steers, Thorin keeps watch and Arturo mostly worries!

Thorin notices some very old, Dwarven runes with a touch of Undercommon - duergar probably - etched on some of the rock pillars. It seems the guide might be using them for navigation. One in particular seems to have three sets; "Sloobludop" - a place name probably - ah yes, another is "Gracklstugh" and the last one, "Blingdenstone". The guide indicates the Gracklstugh direction (so we know he's being honourable).

D20 chance die roll from Arturo: 7. An hour passes. We realise that where we were wasn't even the main part of the lake. After those last three runes on a pillar, things open up into a truly massive, boundless (given vision limits) cavern with far fewer of the rock pillars, presumably because of its sheer size. We think there are stars; tiny little twinkling lights above; occasionally they move around. Thorin asks the guide what they are. "You want to avoid those!" he says. "They are a mutation of winged manta ray-like creatures, which have a light lure on the stings in their tails. They try to lure prey in using them. As long as they're up there, we're fine!"

Arturo asks via Penny translating what would happen if he used Mage Hand to yank a tail. The guide suggests experimenting to find out - but when he is *not* on the boat.

Penny has to row in a straight line, with few markers, for at least an hour across the main lake. PWAT is recast. Stealth (including PWAT +10)

* Penny 13 (disadv., armour clanks when you row!)
* Francesc 32
* Arturo 26
* Thorin 25
* Guide 32

D20 chance die 17. Arturo & Penny (disadv) low; Thorin perception 26; Francesc notices too - with about 15ft of warning above us, something is descending on the boat. It seems to have blotted out the stars. They call out a warning.

Arturo tries to use telekenesis to push the creature away, some 5ft, but DC19; it is slowed down. This interaction however seems to make the creature lose some kind of invisibility; we see a 3ft wide brain with a sharp parrot-like, open beak underneath and long jellyfish-like tentacles trailing. It's a strange, pale, sickly pink. It is extending two long tendrils towards Arturo! The attempted attack glances off the Mage Armour.

Thorin casts Earthbind (STR16 save required). It matches the DC to make the save. Initiative, +3 form aura:

* Arturo 20
* Penny 12
* Francesc 10
* Thorin 9

Arturo figures - big brain, hurt it with Mind Whip. DC16 INT save. Nat 1! Fails. Arturo adds Empowered Spell. 9 damage, plus all the usual bonuses of Mind Whip. It's stunned. He lies down in the boat to try and get further away!

Penny isn't in melee range throws rays of fire from her circlet. One misses but two hit, for a very solid 19 damage. Briefly, it is illuminated more clearly. It screeches!

Arturo tries to see if the creatures ("stars") are reacting, but perception roll is too low for him to tell.

Francesc "Shoot It In The Face" Icefrond gets a hit with the longbow, for 16 damage. Her second attack hits too, for an additional 7 damage. She swears, "*Nearly* took it down!" she exclaims.

Thorin casts a Starry Wisp at it, hitting but only for a middling 8 damage - the creature is *very* badly injured. Apparently it thinks better of its actions. Penny starts rowing again, hard out! ATHL 21. Meanwhile, Arturo arcana 17 - he figures this was a Grell, an opportunistic hunter. If Grells are around, relatives of this creature probably are too. **If it gets away it might bring friends!** "We must go after it!" he shouts. Penny digs in the oars to stop the boat. Range is maybe 40-50 ft at most. Arturo throws a firebolt; he hits for 6 damage. The strange creature falls out of the air with a loud splash into the water behind the boat. Penny picks up the pace again.

Thorin sees the water under the boat start to glow faintly purple! There's a kind of upwelling current that pushes us along; it's happening just behind us. Some kind of mouth opens just below where the grell fell, opening up a vortex; the grell is swallowed. Things become calm again.

One last chance D20 from Arturo - 20.

We hear a strange, sharp screech from high above us. Then there's a strange thudding sound. The cavern seems to shake! Some battle is happening... Penny ATHL 14. *Rocks* start to fall from the ceiling. One smashes into the boat as Penny is trying to avoid them - a lack of Darkvision makes that difficult! The boat is heavily damaged. Penny is in the middle. Arturo was in the stern behind. Thorin and guide were up front. Francesc is beyond the cabin, just Penny.

The rock is falling on Penny! DEX save - oh dear, 11. The others basically see Penny falling into a gap between two remaining pieces of boat, into the water - the boat is smashed into two, it's done. We have two pieces of boat and a gap where the middle bit used to be. Thorin shouts "Plan B!" - he turns into a giant snake as Arturo gets the rope into the snake's mouth. In fact, the rope is sort of holding the two bits of boat together.

Penny tries to swim onto the snake, ATHL 18, manages to grab the rope without pulling other people into the water! She ends up near the guide. We're all riding a giant constrictor snake now! Swim speed is 30. The broken bits of boat fall away.

The guide says "This is not going *at all* to plan!"

We argue that we *did* have a plan B, and it's working perfectly. The guide then points at a nearby raft, also damaged by the rockfall, a whole bunch of creatures holding onto the side and some others swimming around. "Is *that* part of the plan?!" shouts the guide.

Arturo history 21, Penny nature 20 (Thorin - 14).

Arturo sees that is Kuatoa in the water; they were pushing the raft. A bunch of *slaves* are being pushed aboard the raft. Penny recognises the species - humanoids including Deep Gnomes caught as slaves, and recognises the "fish people" corralling them. "We can't let that slide!" she shouts. "We have to help."

Thorin-snake starts to head towards the raft. Arturo 2xD6->9 -> 9 slaves.

Penny throws down a moonbeam over the swimmers. 5ft radius. We see clearly now, 9 slaves trying to keep on the damaged raft as the Kuatoa circle them. Potential damage 13, CON 17 saves. The kuatoa swim gracefully; some slaves who keep sliding off the raft are much more splashy and noisy. They're attracting attention.

As the moonbeam sears one kuatoa (13 damage), getting another partially (6 damage). All four look our way. Initiative:

* Penny 17
* Thorin 15
* Arturo 14
* Francesc 11

Penny keeps moving the moonbeam on top of the injured Kuatoa, potentially doing another 6 damage; the one who was hurt last time is hurt as much as the first this time too, also taking 6 damage.

Arturo thinks that if he's very careful with a fireball he could get two. He shouts to Penny, "Fly or crocodile?" "Uuh - fly!" - and he casts Fly. He twins that, including himself in Fly too, calling out to the slaves, "We're coming to save you, the snake is our friend, swim to the snake!"

Thorin-snake is about 30ft away from us. He sees that the kuatoa can swim about as fast as he can. He also notices that one of them looks different from the others. He backs away, keeping within range of darkvision - 55ft or so! - and waits there, knowing that he has the guide and Francesc still riding on his back.

A spellcaster Kuatoa summons a water elemental. Francesc kills that spellcaster, but it leaves the elemental uncontrolled. The moonbeam takes down a Kuatoa; another is near death. The other heads towards Thorin-snake. Penny moves the Moonbeam over that one, hoping to slow it; potential damage 12.

Thorin-snake senses movement in the water, deep down... Something has been attracted! He ignores this and the Kuatoa, swimming towards the slaves to try and effect a rescue.

Arturo tries Mind Whip, twinned, on the two surviving Kuatoa, using his shard to confer disadvantage on the save for the closer one. That takes 6, the other 16 - that one dies. Just one left.

The water elemental disappears into the water.

The nearest Kuatoa, stunned by mind-whip, tries to throw its spear-net at Francesc. It misses, just. The effects of moonbeam hit it full force, and it too sinks down below the surface.

We think we've won and we're thinking "rescue 9 slaves". Penny sees Thorin-snake behaving a bit strangely; something is amiss (insight 17). Her and Arturo are flying and then start to see soft purple light below the water. "It" is back!

Arturo yells at the slaves to get onto the snake. Penny backs him up. Adv. persuasion 30 - they put aside their worries about the giant snake! The raft is sinking anyway. Arturo and Penny fly down to help people "aboard". As soon as the last person is on the snake, Thorin-snake guns it! Away we go.

Fly starts to fade before we reach the shore. We have to get onto the snake. It's a squeeze! 13 people, but the snake can, amazingly, just about carry the load. It helps that some slaves are gnomes and don't weight much. Some are humans; Arturo asks what happens. They were a scholarly expedition! They never realised how - *messy* and weird things had become in the Underdark. They'd heard reports about things being "off", so came down to study, but never expected their guides and guards to be overpowered by Kuatoa en route to Sloobludop. They're pretty sure they were being taken somewhere to be traded. They are at a loss. The humans want to get to the surface. The rock gnomes just want to get home.

We consider the teleportation helm to at least return the humans. Except now, up head, unmistakable light from burning torches on the docks of Gracklstugh. Francesc has the helm.

Arturo asks if there's anywhere we could pull onto the bank without actually entering the docks. Perhaps we could do it from the back of the snake? Francesc asks Arturo for a potato!

So the short version is - Francesc disappears (taking the scholar slaves to our keep outside Candlekeep), then reappears a short time later uncomfortable close to Arturo!

So we've a giant snake, 3 rock gnomes, a duergar guide who does *not* want to go to the docks and the rest of our party. We just don't have a choice. Docks it is. We rock up, bold as brass, riding a giant snake - just another day on the lake. Thorin-snake crests up, sliding up onto a pier. Once we're all on dry land he turns back into himself.

Two guards are running in our direction. "You're not allowed to be on there - all vehicles - have to - you need - pay for mooring!" - but Thorin is now our vehicle. "No mooring is required!" says Thorin. "Nonetheless - all visitors - report to the Dock Master's office!"

We along with it. The guide is using Arturo as a human shield (Arturo happily obliging) to try and keep his face hidden. He tugs at Arturo's hand and says something; Penny translates "I'm not going any further!" - he holds out his hand. Thorin pays him the remaining 50gp. "It has been... Doing business with you! Keep a low profile if you can." "Unlikely!" says Arturo as Penny translates. The guide slinks away, presumably to try and find passage on _any_ vessel leaving.

We arrive at the Dock Master's office (with 3 rock gnomes in tow). The party nominate Penny to speak for them.

A female, battle-scarred deurgar marches out of the office. "Ha! You're them magic users that did just arrive. I see. You'll be wanting to get in. You can't go in. You have to stay in the docks. Register yourself and your slaves here before I can let you any further. Slaves do not sleep in the inns." "They're not slaves!" says Penny. "They are clearly slaves!" "They're not *registered* as slaves." Arturo tries to help but 3,4+8->12 maximum. Then Arturo remembers the emblem for city access. So Penny shows that. The Dock Master looks worried suddenly. "I know you *say* they are not slaves, but if you want to go any further, you won't be able to bring them in unless they *are* slaves. So what are they? Free to wander and free to go; or they have to be registered as your slaves."

We confer with the rock gnomes. They want to get home - back across the lake. They have nothing, though; we could try and secure passage. Penny asks the Dock Master (persuasion 22) - "Well, alright... I guess you were telling the truth otherwise you wouldn't be trying to get rid of them! There is a boat headed that way" - she turns to the gnomes - "If you are willing to work for your keep I can arrange for you ride on there as deckhands." They agree.

Penny gives them 1gp each to help get them started. They could probably do with clothes, for a start!

They are very grateful. Not only did we save them, but we've shown "rare character for these parts in these Times Of Trouble". One of them says, "We have nothing to give you in return. Everything we had was taken. If you ever find yourself in **Blingdenstone**, come and look for us in the **Gold Whisker Warrens**."

Arturo tries to say something kind of coded to imply "lidded eye", and one *does* respond. "Though you may not see what is in front of you, you can see the truth beneath. We trust that you will be able to see past that which afflicts us in the Warrens and know that we, too, are pure of heart." Penny religion 7 (!) but Thorin, religion 22. **They're lycanthropes**... he figures - were-rats! They seem to have very good control of their senses. Not a form of lycanthropy that makes them go mad.

In any case, the Lidded Eye veiled reference was noticed.

So, we are admitted. We're in the **Dark Lake docks district**. Perception in the dim light (ADV if there is a city-based skill):

* Thorin 21
* Francesc 19
* Penny 4 (!)
* Arturo 3

Arturo and Penny are busy talking to the Dock Master. Meanwhile, Thorin knows the rough layout of dwarven cities and this meets expectations. He expects stairs from the docks to the next district. Lights and fires come from probable furnaces, burning with green-blue flame - they must be smelting some strange ore. Arturo via Penny asks where a bar where we might meet Drow may be. "I'm not your city guide!" she says. We head out.

An inscription above a gateway to the Dark Lake district... says "**Welcome to the City Of Blades**" in Dwarven.

We approach the gates. A pair of guards are roughly handling a merchant. We don't get involved. We're now on even ground; worked stones, roads, not the uneven natural (or partly natural) passageways we've been on for so many days prior. Streets have hexagonal stone tiles, decorated. It looks like a sizeable city - Thorin thinks it might contain more than 10,000 inhabitants!

Surprisingly, proper lamps line roads. Duergar it seems don't mind wandering around in proper light, rather than dim light or darkness. Side alleys though are dim, heading into darkness. Even so, we try to be inconspicuous! Stealth, with PWAT:

* Arturo 23
* Thorin 27
* Francesc 25
* Penny (disadv) 22

Rather than walking in the open, we keep close to the sides of buildings, trying to stay more in the shadows. We see a mixture of people here; quite a few duergar, unsurprisingly; a few humans wearing dark cloaks looking like they, too, are trying to be inconspicuous; some deep gnomes; and a few drow; even a few Kuatoa.

One thing is for sure - it is *loud* here. A constant clanking and thudding echoes through the city.

We discuss - what next? Finding drow in a tavern, from our original discussion with our became-our-guide, still seems like a good bet. It's better than nothing and we could get a tankard or something for return via helm in future.

Luck die - Thorin this time - 19.

In the process of trying to avoid people, we find ourselves heading towards some kind of tower. And then out of a side road, for some reason - some kind of mob. Two groups seem to be clashing. Five duergar teamsters are riding and herding 9 large "steeders" - very large, spider-like creatures - that seem to be in a bit of a frenzy as the teamsters try to protect them and get them into the square. This group is being attacked by, well, **derro** - feral duergar. It's just like the guide told us, way when we first met - duergar that seem to have lost control and are acting out wildly. They trying to jump on and ride the steeders, throwing things at the teamsters - acid pouches, we think?! - then a group of give run at us!

Penny thinks she'd be on the side of the law if we fight. But don't mess up the city! Initiative:

* Francesc 26
* Arturo 19
* Penny 18
* Thorin 16

Francesc is quite trigger happy and just fires. She takes out one, but a second arrow goes wide.

Arturo considers a fireball. Not only could he hit the ones running at us, he could get a few harassing the duergar teamsters. He sends it upward to try and avoiding damaging the city! Four make their saves, 5 fail their saves. A whopping 37 damage to those who fail, 18 to those who succeed - oddly he has a flashback to a fireball to kill al lich in his vision; "Die lich!" he shouts - they are *all* incinerated.

The other derro take one look at that and run, as an over-excited Arturo shouts threats about melting their bones and so-forth!

Perception: low, except Thorin 19. The square is suddenly silent, except for the clanking. Everyone in the square is staring in astonishment at this strange, blue human, who is shouting as if mad himself! Thorin taps Arturo on the shoulder - "all right - maybe - take it down just a bit...?!"

Guards are arriving. Some catch remaining derro. Another one starts speaking Undercommon to Arturo. Penny translates; he's thanking us for our help. It was mob who overpowered a group of guards further. "We appreciate you stepping in and helping even though you are not citizens of the city. What is your purpose here? Is there anything we can help you with?"

Penny and Thorin just straight-up describe the tablets and Drow; we might be able to get information from the Drow.

The guard captain says he'll ask around - guards will surely have seen drow carrying giant tablets. But where can he find us? We are trying to find an inn; recommendations welcome!

We do know that we were warned about guards being demon-worshippers! Arturo later, when he is able to speak and hear languages he understands (!), reminds us of this. But we are being careful - Thorin, insight 15; the guard captain is being truthful and responds in a thoughtful manner. When we say we don't have an inn to visit yet, he takes a moment. "You might want to head to - uuuh - investigate the Cairngorn Cavern, because there is a - uuuh - hermit stone giant that hides out that way. The Stone Guard that are a group of guards that I happen to work closely with, well, they have amongst them a worshipper of **Skoraeus**, the Deepfather. Look - there are ways to get in touch with the Stone Guard but **be aware that Cairngorn Cavern does have a 'reputation' of late; the giant that used to be a hermit there has been behaving erratically and those who have seen him have - well, they sound incoherent when they describe what they've seen, so we're not sure what's really happened. Anyway! You would be best off finding an inn in Darklake District**."

He continues - "A place to stay, well, the **Ghohlbrorn's Lair** is the place to go!" - Thorin understands that this Dwarven for "bulette". He assures us it is safe. It's in a small cavern beneath the Blade Bazaar, but to *meet* people and drink without being surveilled? Do it out in the open where it's busy. The **Shattered Spire** is the place to go" - he points to the tower we'd by chance been headed towards anyway.

We see eventually that it's reached by a bridge across an arm of the Dark Lake, made out of very strong *wool* (!) - from a special kind of ram - perhaps that's to keep quiet, above the dangerous waters? Anyway, the spire itself appears to be made of plates of petrified fungi. It's strange but impressive to look upon.

Once the guards have departed, we confer. Talking to people at the Spire makes sense. But staying here longer? Arturo is rightfully worried. It's a police state, with craziness going on, aligned with demon worshippers. Staying a night or two might let this Captain give us more info - or sell us out, inviting attack. While the Helm is a possible escape route, we're well aware of Counterspells.

At least we're agreed on the spire. D20 luck die -> Thorin -> 1.

As we head towards the tower, we see lots of activity in a market to the north. But where we're headed, the crowds seem to be leaving - drawn towards the market commotion - that gives us an opportunity to sneak over the bridge.

It's strange. A bit of give, trust is needed! We can see reflections on the water below of the smokey city lights. The water's surface is about 10ft below, with ripples from passing boats that bounce off the walls of the channel and the cavern further out.

We reach the Spire and step inside.

The clanking of the city is replaced by the loud din of a busy tavern. Stairs around the outsides lead to a series of concentric balconies overlooking a central bar on the ground floor. There's no apparent entertainment, other than the drink! Floors 1 and 2 have full tables. Small fights are happening on floor 3; someone is being dangled over the balcony edge! A female duergar passes by tells us to grab a seat and "order at the bar - we don't do table service!"

Arturo gets to the bar. He claims we're doing the "most epic pub crawl you've ever heard of - we'd like to buy a drink and the mug it comes in!" A good story.

The bartender can speak Common, fortunately. He reaches up to a shelf and fetches four mugs that have a kind of hammer-like shape. They look superficially to be made of steel but when we examine them closer, we see that the material is some cheaper metal. He hits a button on the bar that makes it jolt and move downwards to reveal a giant array of barrels - "what's your poison?!"

"Some kind of giant ale!" says Arturo, hedging.

"Four choices! Bar tender's choice?"

"Yes!"

The four mugs are "filled with Smokestack" - 8gp, 4ps - these are expensive tankards! Arturo bargains, trying to argue for just one tankard and argues that they're clearly no real steel. Persuasion 22! "All right, fine!" says the Bartender. Three of the beers are transferred into "normal" mugs. "One Shattered Spire mug and three you need to return to us! That'll be... Four gold, two silvers... And you get one gold per mug back when you return the mugs".

We will definitely return the mugs! It tells us a lot about what happens here. It's not so much the mugs not being returned, it's more that they get destroyed when used as weapons - as we saw up on level 3!

We head past the fighting level and get to level 4. That seems to be, in fact, the top floor. People are on dates, or people are conducting sculduggery. We fall into the latter category! We need to look down to the floors below for drow. Perception:

* Francesc 25
* Thorin 19
* Penny 9

Francesc points out a table with 2 Drow and 3 Quaggoth slaves. Time to have a chat!

(End of part 31)
