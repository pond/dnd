# RIPA: Part 29
## Session 29 (2021-01-30)
### Underdark, Drow watchtower

We have battled and defeated Drow in a watchtower, but uncovered disturbing evidence indicating that at least two of the tablets of interest to Velindra Shadowmantle are down here somewhere. This group of Drow are some sort of demon-worshipping cult, hiding themselves it seems from the usual Loth-worshipping Drow (they certainly lied about their religious allegiances to us!).

Looking around the base of the tower, there's maybe 20ft clearance on three sides of the tower, which is built out from a stalagmite that supports the cavern ceiling some 150ft above, with the stalagtitle dropping down behind the tower maybe 100ft or so. We're essentially on a mid-level ledge. There are numerous smaller ledges and walkways that look to have been naturally carved over time.

We discuss ways to try and find these people that were captured, with tablets. We aren't happy staying in the tower as this might take a while, so instead we figure we'll venture out and try to find somewhere to hide, then investigate more. To kick things off though, Arturo - survival 14 - there are a few possible tracks, but they all generally head further into the cavern. We might as well look for a hiding place in that direction. Francesc is on the case for that - so we head out. Thorin, Penny, Arturo, Francesc at the rear. Arturo brings up Mage Armour and Thorin casts Pass Without A Trace.

Francesc spots (perception 18) one possible hiding hole that's about 15ft up, along a ledge. Thorin (perception 23) finds a tight squeeze through a crack in rock to the right, which has air coming through. It's a tight squeeze though; Penny would need to take off her armour. Francesc decides to check out the ledge. Does a running jump - ACRO nat 1, doesn't work! Splat. Has to climb the hard way. ATHL 16, much better. There is indeed a place to hide; it's not a path, just a ledge, but we'd be within 20ft of the walkway and would need to be very quiet. No lights.

Arturo checks out the alternative. He casts Light to be able to see through the crack. As soon as he does, lots of insects of all sizes scurry away, including many that disappear into the crack itself. It looks quite dense, but maybe that's normal for the underdark?! He pushes in. It's about 30ft deep before reaching a small cavern, some 30ft wide and 10ft tall, 20-25ft across - sort of oval. A shaft in the roof heading upwards leads away somewhere; there's another crack on a far wall too, with wind blowing through. He looks inside. The ground is covered in large old, almost dusty cobwebs and there are bleached bones.

He takes a mouse scull as a teleport focus, but realises that there's still only one charge left on the helm. We'd not want Penny faffing with armour on the main trail, so maybe the charge to get *out* is best. Arturo explains, so we find a rock for a focus to teleport *out* then Francesc helps Penny get the armour off and we all try to squeeze though. It's awkward but it works. Penny goes in first, so she can get the armour on as soon as possible. Once inside she starts putting it all back on. Thorin goes last. Francesc elects to go last, just as she hears the sound of movement from afar. Faint, but something is approaching. Stealth 25, no problem, but she has the presence of mind to loud-whisper a warning to extinguish the light.

Francesc waits just inside the darkness of the crack. About a minute later, two dwarves pass by, headed the same way we were going, travelling quietly. History 16; these are in fact Duergar. They're speaking in a language she can't understand. They carry large backpacks stuffed full of things.

OK, right then. ATTACK! She sneaks out, the rest of us aware of what's going on via more whispers.

Stealth all round - Penny's not got armour disadvantage, but still rolls 4-1+10->13. One of the duargar hears it, yelps and spins around. Francesc lets an arrow fly. She's technically still hidden so gets advantage and uses the Sharpshooter -5/+10...

* Arturo 25 (with Penny's aura)
* Penny 18
* Thorin 16
* Francesc 15

(the first three of us are pushing through the crack after Francesc, then she fires)

...it hits! With all-the-toys, 27 damage. It falls dead. The other calls out his name, which is pretty distressing! She goes for that one now; the arrow goes wide and misses. In Common, not speaking Undercommon, Francesc tries to get him to stand down but he looks very angry. Inside the cavern, within the crack we hear him yelling, "You killed Klorfrie! Why you do this?!" and Francesc sees the dwarf grow hugely in size; some 10ft tall and 5ft wide. He smashes himself into the canyon wall twice, trashing around, trying to cause rocks to fall. DEX saves all round!

* Penny 17
* Francesc 26
* Arturo 5+5 for aura, 10 -> 7 damage
* Thorin 9+5 for aura, 14 -> 8 damage

Arturo reaches the main cavern and tries Mind Whip. INT 16 save, it fails; the giant duergar stops moving, stunned; 13 damage. Penny hears Thorin calling that "we need information!" so tries to punch it, but miraculously misses twice, disadvantage yield 1,2 and 4,5 with a +6 mod -> badly misses. She withdraws to a safer distance!

Thorin tries Entangle (but this unfortunately means that PWAT fails). Surprisingly it works (rolls 14 on the save). Francesc moves Hunter's Mark. She tries hitting with the hilt of the blade; it hits but it's only 1d4 -> 4 damage, but with 1d6->5 extra from Hunter's Mark. Second swing; 15 to hit, doesn't make it.

The duergar looks for the closest target. Francesc! It swings, but it's hampered by entanglement and misses.

Arturo follows our lead and tries hitting it with a stick; ADV from entanglement; hits, for damage - and that does it! THe duergar shrinks down, unconscious but no longer entangled. The dead guy fell off a ledge and is a long way down; we pull the unconscious one into the hidden cave, tie him up, stuff various blankets and cloaks in the exit crack on our side to block light and sound a bit. Penny (medicine 16+2->18) stabilises him at 0hp. Francesc investigates the backpack; 16. It's full of wrapped-up goods and ornate boxes with trinkets. Precious and semi-precious stones in a bag. There's a roughly-bound notebook stuffed full of extra pages with Undercommon. Penny checks, using Light relit from Arturo. She is able to understand most of it; there's dwarven mixed in here and there, which Thorin can read. There's a purse with 18 gold and 10 silver.

We spend time checking the notebook.

* Orders 
* Bills of lading
* Invoices
* A ledger of where he's been
* What he's bought what he's sold
* Names of guards and how to bribe them!

This is a trader, on his way back to somewhere called **Gracklstugh**. An address in "West Cleft", going through agents in the "Great Gates", a reference to 'moving it' to 'foreigners in the Darklake District'. There is an additional list of places where he's going to trade. Francesc insight 23, none of the stuff in the bag is made of metal - steel or iron. It's all precious metals (silver, etc.), gems, or wood, ceramic and so-on. His armour and weapons are metallic, though.

Penny's wrestling with the fact that we seem to have just straight-up murdered an innocent trader.

We have to ask questions, so Penny puts in a few HP to wake him up. He's panicked and thrashes around. Penny tries to calm him down, apologise, it can't be fixed, and so-on, he clearly thinks we're bad people (we are!) - persuasion 26 - but for all that, he'll at least talk. *He* doesn't want to die and suspects we'll kill him if he doesn't cooperate.

* Has he heard of strange stone tablets, two in particular, found by Drow hunting parties and brought down along with prey they captured - **no knowledge at all**. We'd be better off asking Drow about Drow affairs! His only contact with Drow is avoiding them, getting into unwanted fights from them, or occasionally in controlled areas of Darklake District (on the shorts of The Darklake) there are controlled inns and taverns where Drow are allowed.

* Gracklstugh is a major Duergar city. A capitol of sorts in this part of the underdark.

* Does he know any of the Drow pathways? He uses the same pathways to get to small towns and outposts along the way to the capitol.

* Has he heard rumours of weird stuff, demons, places he has heard have become recently dangerous - avoid them?

Persuasion lucky roll again, 24. The words Penny uses trigger a memory. He doesn't spend much time in Gracklstugh - the city is too strange, strict, stifling (a police state, we infer - he prefers the smaller settlements along the way, for the 11 days along the road from where we are now). But the **last time he was there he noticed very strange things.** Quite a lot of Duergar were behaving very "**Derro**"; he seems to revile this; Francesc history 21 - it's a particular subgroup of Duergar who are considered 'wild'. They don't work with society. Chaotic.

He thinks there's *something* wrong there; the last visit he went, lots of Duergar were just acting out - flouting the rules, very obviously and loudly, but the police then would clamp down in very draconian ways. He saw a trader wearing lots of jewellery, flaunting it - that's frowned upon - who was beaten unconscious by the guards!

The city is roughly Eastward. Arturo learned cartography during a near-death experience and is drawing up maps to try and help us navigate.

He says a particular word - Penny doesn't recognise it; Thorin ADV history, 15. A word he's not heard in a very long time; very old dwarven, perhaps now appropriated by the Duergar language. The word is "madness". The city is being slowly overtaken. Even the "**keepers of the flame and the dragon**" are affected. Francesc gets Penny to enquire about that! The city has a red dragon, which keeps all the forges running. Penny jokes about the legend of Themberchaud being fat because he gets fed gold to keep the forges going; the Duergar hears her say the name and thinks she must've visited the city! **It *is* in fact Themberchaud!** But there are rumours that the red dragon's eggs had been stolen (by the thieve's guild of sorts, the Grey Hands?) so the dragon is becoming very out-of-control but the Keepers Of The Flame can't just kill it and hatch a new one as they've done for millennia past.

Penny thinks:

* Maybe the extraplanar incursion 
* Could be the demons from these Drow, but the Drow don't go there
* Ilithids?!

Francesc gets Penny to ask why he's got no metal. Why would he go to the place that *makes* metal using metal exported to the surface?!

He (low WIS save) decides to ask if he can be recompensed for his dead friend. Penny thinks that's kind of reasonable and maybe he won't rat us out if we do that. Francesc, insight 18, thinks dwarves in general are very lawful, a deal is a deal. His taken told and silver are quietly returned! So, what does he want? Arturo with Penny's help tries to persuade him with 100gp. ADV, 29. He's particularly scared of Arturo, who was the person who took him down!

He becomes emboldened by this. We're the trading type, huh? "Are you headed to Gracklstugh?"

(We confer).

"Sure."

He has two proposals. He introduces himself! He is **Hoskuldr Mithrilstone**. He could be our guide; he'll get us there on the fastest route possible. He thinks - if we aren't rubbish at walking! - in just 9 days by the fastest route, with only two longer stops. There'd be a contract for this work. To get us there would be 40gp. Every day less than 11 days it takes, is a bonus 5gp. He claims that the only safe entrance is through the Darklake Docks; the last day involves crossing the lake from the pier on the side closest to us. He can get us to the pier at the start of the 9th day, so we'd be in Gracklstugh by the ninth day. He mentions that it's about 300 miles!

Alternatively - he has a very special token for a specific inn that we'd need to get to. That's the only way to get in the door - it's for foreigners only and this token is needed for trust. Tucked into his armour, it's a large octagon-shaped, partly metal embossed object with Dwarven writing. Penny asks where this thing is made - somewhere in town, but he doesn't know where. She asks price; he claims a special price of "50gp".

Francesc pushes for faster travel options (we think the helm is too dangerous - we'd arrive *in the factory* where the tokens are made, they'd probably therefore think the one we had was already stolen, they're on high alert, they beat a trader unconscious...) - well, there's a very dangerous option! The Silken Paths (spiders). Crosses a giant chasm. 4 days. He'd want 100gp, all-in. 150gp for the fast, dangerous version ("You *must* keep me alive!") and the token.

Hazards *other* than the obvious giant spiders:

* Heavily hunted - sometimes Drow, but they're afraid of the Cloakers!
* This does at least mean there are fewer Drow, uuuh...
* He claims that if we stick with him, we have a better chance of getting past them

...there's not complete consensus. We say we'll give that a go, but for the right price. So Arturo and Penny start bartering for price. ADV Persuasion 23. He's aware that we're bartering! He thinks about it... "Fine. You're talking both things - 125gp, all-in. I need that in actual gold, up front." Arturo then offers to retrieve his friend's backpack and bring that along, for a further 25gp discount. "As long as I'm not the one carrying it!"

Arturo uses a Fly spell to get down there. Carrion eaters are already on the body, but they scatter when he arrives. Arturo checks it briefly - it is also full of trade goods. There's no map, but there's a list of runes arranged with arrows and numbers which seem to indicate that there's some kind of - go here, this many steps, then here; he pockets it, to hand to Thorin later. Some ceramic items are smashed; those are discarded to lighten the load. Even so, Arturo has to fly very slowly back up - he's essentially encumbered.

A nerve-wracking 10 minutes has gone by while Penny, having once again gone back to the main cavern, puts her armour back on. When the backpack is returned, the Duergar is a bit disappointed as he hadn't accounted for all the broken items, but after thinking a while he decides that it was still a good deal to let go of 25gp in exchange for that.
Thorin pays the 50 up-front for the token; the deal is that he'll get the 50gp remaining once we reach the city.

"Shall we go before we encounter other people?" "Yes!"

We're taken along an earthen bridge. We rope up for safety; it's narrow and we'd possibly not have used it without a guide showing it was safe. Thorin keeps reusing PWAT on the staff - very useful!

Interestingly, the path on the other side is *much* more well trodden than the path we were on previously. Arturo asks how we can avoid running into people... "If you keep to a pace, everyone moves at more or less the same, so we shouldn't run into other people. We need to keep our pace up! Our first stop is a long way away."

We keep alert as we go. Francesc perception 7, Penny disadv 10. We don't notice much. Arturo keeps an eye on the guide though, to make sure things are above board. He occasionally runs ahead (warning us before he does so) to "check the coast is clear".

We reach a strange area that looks like a dead end. "Strap everything onto you!" he orders. "Nothing loose hanging". We do our best. "You're not going to suddenly get scared and not follow me?! No loud noises. This is fine. Trust me!"

Hoskuldr steps over to a hole on the edge of a drop. **He then steps into it and disappears!** Arturo goes second; knowing that he can fly or feather-fall, Penny jumps after; Thorin third; Francesc last. We find ourselves in a shaft with a loud 'whooshing' sound from somewhere ahead. Eventually, the shaft angles a little and we realise we're on a slide - it's a slick-sided thing, but we move *very* quickly. ACRO / ATHL check:

* Francesc 18
* Penny 21
* Thorin 15
* Arturo 7

Arturo's getting stuffed up - and suddenly his tunic elbow catches fire from the friction! After a couple of mins, CON saves:

* Francesc 8
* Penny 18
* Arturo 13
* Thorin 26

Francesc barfs! The party is now essentially being chased by Francesc and barf. TEN minutes - we're still going! CON saves again:

* Francesc 5
* Penny 19
* Arturo 15
* Thorin 27

WIS also:

* Francesc 23
* Penny 16
* Arturo 11 (he gets pretty scared at how long this has been going on)
* Thorin 23

Eventually things level out and we slow down. We've all got bruises and sore elbows; Penny heals Arturo's elbows. We all land in a sandpit; Penny is worried that all the barf will follow, but it seems to have mostly stuck to the inside of the tunnel!

INT based survival; highest is Arturo, 23. He has a good sense of rate of fall and thinks that given the time we fell for, we must have descended (at an angle) 3-4 miles in just a few minutes.

"None of you have been in the Underdark before, have you?" says our guide. "Ha. Well. Welcome to the Underdark. Where you were before? That was just a cave. We call that the Overdark."

* Arturo chats a lot to the guide - city etiquette, pretty much. How to not make faux pas and get murdered!

We're passing through a very rich fungal garden at one point. The guide insists that he harvests some very precious mushrooms here. Penny, survival 18; Arturo likewise. We find a few interesting mushrooms too. Francesc, 10; she puts her hand into some acidic slime mould and takes 9 acid damage. Penny heals it (through tears of laughter).

* Arturo - D20->3 - a bluecap - it's inedible but he can shake out spores (gets a bag full) and Duergar prize it as the flour of the underdark.

* Penny - D20->19 - on approach the guide shouts out a warning! - a 2 foot tall mushroom, but only the cap is needed (the guide helps remove it); wrap it carefully and don't let fire need it. A single torchstalk cap can burn for 24h once lit or if fire is thrown at it, it explodes in an incendiary cloud of firey spores, setting everything around alight.

Hoskuldr finds all manner of mushrooms, mostly small, which he pockets. Eventually, we are led away from the chamber. We get dim light for a while by some of the mushrooms lighting up in a dim glow as we approach; a while after we've gone, they go dark.

### Day 29 is crossed into as we travel - we don't know the true time-by-sun above ground

There's one more slide. We're better at it this time. Cloaks are wrapped around to help avoid abrasion and so-on.

The day's end is reached. "We're almost half way towards the Great Chasm; we deserve a good rest. Just a little bit further on there's a settlement with an inn" says Hoskuldr.

The settlement is a "free city" - just a handful of buildings, a hamlet - but it's open to all races ("...of the underdark"). There's a small store, a true tavern, the inn, a place that fixes weapons, another that fixes armour and shoes and so-on. Very much a trading and service waypoint.

Tavern first! Not many people around. Two in a corner seem to have a shroud of darkness around them; they're had to see. Some Deep Gnomes are playing cards on a corner table. A rather out-of-place scarred barbarian woman with leathery dark skin and braided hair pulled back sits alone with a huge plate of insect legs of some kind and a tankard of ale. Two Duergar sit close to the bar, arguing with a staff member.

Hoskuldr says he'll take this time for himself and leaves us. We need to be ready to go after we've slept at the inn.

Arturo wants to talk to the gnomes, but none of us speak Gnomish. As Arturo approaches, the switch to Undercommon. Arturo uses Penny as translator, but as they hear that, they suddenly switch, surprisingly, to Elven. Now Francesc understands. Finally, they try to speak a very broken Common. Arturo buys them a round of drinks which lifts the mood immediately!

We start asking questions. We get as far as being honest about trying to rescue people but phrase that as being due to these bad Drow who aren't Loth-worshippers; could be a threat to the Underdark. Penny and Arturo work together in a combination of Common or Undercommon when needed for fluency. We (covertly - Arturo SOH 21) show them the letter we found at the tower, which was in a non-Elvish Undercommon variant but a lot of ciphered text we never decoded. One of the three gnomes sees it and changes tone immediately; "too many ears! We must go out of town." Penny insight 16+2->18. The voice quivers with fear. Penny says to the other two, "You two get some food" and we head out with the Deep Gnomes. One of them has taken a breadstick and drawn in the soup a rough map of where we should meet! "We'll leave first, a few minutes later you leave and meet us".

Upon that we realise we should take Thorin too for PWAT. Francesc has to stay to keep up appearances of buying food and drink. 22sp all-in for everyone's food and drink. They take our currency, via weight. Group deception to try and look conspicuous; ADV because Francesc stages an argument:

* Penny 23
* Arturo 28
* Thorin 16

The "soup map" takes us a few minutes out of town and into a hidden side tunnel. Realising that two of us can't see in the dark, one of them pulls out a contraption which has mushrooms put into it, the squishes them, emitting a bioluminescent glow.

"*That* letter. How did you come by it? Why do you have it?"

TL;DR one of the gnomes is aware of an unfolding situation and realises that this letter matches things they've heard. This gnome is part of "The Lidded Eye", an Underdark network opposed to "some kind of authoritarian dictatorship network of priests and seers on the surface who seem determined to shape destiny on the surface called the All Seeing Eye". It's a resistance network, trying to undermine the All Seeing Eye. They've discovered that two great forces are meeting, clashing, trying to shape destiny. Around it is this 'mouth of hell'. One side wants it unleashed - Shadowmantle, we think - the All Seeing Eye does not want it unleashed.

Penny asks why that's such a dangerous thing to have - the letter, that is - why all this hiding around outside of town? "Because this is *proof*. This letter proves all of the fears that people have, that this network exists and is organised and will invite us to be hunted down and persecuted and killed." The gnome speaks of himself as if part of the Lidded Eye; his two friends are not involved. He notes that the network needs eyes and ears above ground, so it's not just Underdark folk. This explains everything - the gnome is familiar with the cipher and had read the letter easily.

He does reveal that the ritual - whatever it is - has already commenced at the "mouth of hell".

He doesn't know where it is - quite far. But he thinks that's not the problem. If the ritual succeeds, it weakens the protections that exist between the demon lord plane and the Underdark plane. They could emerge from anywhere. The gnome believes they've already had a seeping pervasive presence that's been going on for a while, but it's really hard to pin down.

He doesn't know what the stone tablets might be for. He'd heard that the ritual had been cast and presumably completed, and there may only be one way of fixing things - "A long time ago, stone giants figured out a way to close such portals. That might be linked."

He then tells his friends that it's too dangerous for them to stay here tonight! They wish us luck. The last thing he says before going - "I don't know what your purpose is down here, but you may have involved yourself in something bigger than you anticipated. Hopefully you find it in yourselves to do the right thing."

We return to the tavern. More drinks. Francesc is brought up to date.

* Velindra Shadowmantle does - it must help her with whatever *she* wants to do
* The All Seeing Eye is probably evil; but they don't want the Mouth opened, perhaps because they just don't want anything that Velindra does want!
* The Lidded Eye opposes the All Seeing Eye, but doesn't want the Mouth open.

For all that:

* The ritual to open the Mouth is probably opened now. Specific demon lords can come through between the planes (we think of it as a door but it's not specifically such; incursions can happen anywhere with the barrier between the planes weakened).
* The Stone Giants might have once known how to close such a door once opened (or more accurately, restore the protections now weakened).
* The tablets we've heard of are probably connected to this, but we only know of a couple of them and you probably need all five. Shadowmantle wants them - either to prevent anyone using them to close the door, or perhaps to be able to close it herself once she's done whatever she needs with it.

Is Vallin of the All Seeing Eye simply evil? The lesser of two evils, since she opposes Shadowmantle? 

We're tired. We head over to the inn, get a large room, set up alarms and try to get some rest.

(End of part 29)
