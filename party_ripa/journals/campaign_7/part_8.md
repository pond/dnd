# RIPA: Part 8
## Session 8 (2023-07-11)
### Day 5, around 8pm

We've finished battling. We have found an interesting amulet and this piques Francesc's interest - she investigates more. Nat 20+6! She focuses on the spell caster orcs in particular. She finds various bits of jewellery that look valuable and a strange kind of tablet with writing on, but shaped in a kind of totem shape, resembling a boar; it looks like some kind of code of laws. There's a basic large warm cloak intact which Francesc takes, but most other clothing and equipment are damaged. There's some kind of crown fashioned from deer antlers, which isn't magical but clearly has ceremonial significance - it goes into the bag of holding, just in case. Finally, Francesc finds a component pouch with little of interest inside - except a small diamond, which we estimate is worth around 300gp!

We discuss our next moves. Eloise wants to tend to the wounded, hoping that she can convince them not to continue cutting down the forest. Penny wants to help and uses as much lay-on-hands pool as she has available. This is Falcon's area so he'll stay too.

Doric meanwhile has lashed fallen logs together into a raft! The five of us figure we can take watches on the raft, drifting downriver. It's arguably safer than hanging around in the wild woods after dark with no proper shelter. We figure out a watch rotation with two on, three off, helped in part by Francesc being able to recover more quickly than the rest of us (long rest equiv via meditation in 4 hours).

Doric and Penny start on first watch while the others rest. Penny, flat perception (despite no dark vision, due to Doric's aid) 16+2->18. The raft moves swiftly; the current is quicker than we thought. Doric explains that the logs are brought from the forest to Neverwinter by floating them on this very river - it heads to the city. In the twilight, the damage at the fringes of the forest, or damage caused by piled up slash damage. Doric becomes upset and withdrawn as more of this is revealed.

Arturo's watch is next, overlapping as Doric sleeps and Francesc wakes up; perception 17. Arturo tries to cast a spell to help with the observation, but triggers a wild magic surge! He manages to fold it into some kind of bubble that surrounds him; tells Francesc it's OK; but then the bubble pops, and Arturo has vanished!

At this point, Francesc is alone on watch (and rather surprised), but also has to try and steer the raft - athletics check... 12. Rapids, bumpy. Penny con save 2+2=>4, Thorin => 13. Penny's woken up. Francesc shouts "it's all fine! Go back to sleep!" and Penny obliges, as best she can. At the end of what seems like a very long 3 hours, Thorin is able to assist, watching while Francesc steers - Thorin's perception is Nat 20+7! - though he doesn't actually notice Arturo's absence for a couple of hours. Francesc does her best to explain the rather improbable story.

### Day 6

Finally, the sun starts to rise, lighting the very edge of the horizon. The raft is clearing the thickest part of the woods. Penny gets up and hears the same story about Arturo - "a dangerous thing, uncontrolled magic; I hope he can find his way back."

We're hungry. Francesc (survival 19) and Penny (survival 21) manage to fish with javelins and arrows, quite successfully; about two meal's worth for us all. We don'd mind the raw fish - we could park up at the bank and cook, but don't see the need. Penny tries to cheer up Doric, given that she and Penny+Francesc are doing the same kinda thing, but Persuasion is a nat 1! So, no good.

Doric says we're still two days away from Neverwinter! Not a good idea to enter by river either - the city has gates, and we're supposed to go through them. There's a ferry crossing point which we can use to get out later today, then a day on road.

Penny (survival 16) and Doric navigate; the mooring is quite easy to find. We get started on the road.

Thorin has a herbalism kit and with Penny's help, survival 15, tries to find herbs to work on a project. 3d8 -> 3,2,8 -> 13. Thorin finds 13 gold piece's worth of medicinal herbs over the course of the remaining five hours of walk. Thorin knows that if he finds about 25 gold worth, he can spend downtime during a long rest to use the kit and herbs to make a standard Potion of Healing - if we have a glass vial for it.

It gets late. We need to set up camp.

(Penny pulls Francesc to one side; we have a line, her and I, which we try not to cross though sometimes we can be quick with the weapons ourselves. But the other two, Penny is less sure about right now. She thinks we should be careful - they seem like good people, but they definitely seem quick to join a fight.)

Watch: Thorin 15, Penny 13, Francesc 11. There's a period where the fast-sleeping Francesc is on solo watch, without any overlap. She doesn't notice a figure until they are moving really quite close to the edge of the camp, and even then only because of darkvision. Large! It approaches slowly from the opposite side of the camp fire.

Francesc does not reach for weapons - she starts to walk around, approaching the creature. Ah! It has antlers... But its size and shape look Orc-ish. Once the flare of the camp fire is out of the way it's easier to see. **This is an acolyte of Talos** holding a staff, but **not looking like they are about to attack**.

Penny is closest at that point. Kick in the ribs! Penny starts to wake up and, as she does so, Francesc raises a hand - "Hello, friend". The figure stops. Penny is realising what's going on. The figure speaks haltingly, fortunately able to speak some Common.

"Not an enemy! Here, need to understand. You, your purpose. Are you same side of war as us? You attack us. You have holy crowns!"

Francesc: "We don't want war. We protect people."

"You protect people. You attack forest?"

Penny: "We we caught in crossfire, in war. We protect forest AND people. We think that protecting people can teach them not to harm the forest."

The acolyte shakes his head. Walking up behind hi are two wolves. Francesc wakes Thorin too now.

Francesc: "We *don't want war*. I care about the forest as much as you do."

"But people destroy forest. You cannot. You must choose. People or forest."

"Not all! I am a person."

"No. You are Sylvanus. Sylvanus protector of forest."

Penny says: "I'm a person! I protect the forest. I worship Meliki."

Thorin chips in. "I am one with nature too. A person or a beast." - and he says this in Druidic. The Talosian acolyte is a cleric *and* a druid. This gets a good response. A shared language. The conversation is now more fluid. **His name is Krunik**. He is from the Circle Of Thunder (a druidic circle), worshiping the God of Storms. Thorin knows that Talos is technically an evil weather god, not a nature god! So these Orcish druids are a conundrum.

His is adamant. The razeboar lives in the forest. It is an embodiment of Talos. The forest must be protected. People destroy the forest. All must be killed!

Francesc and Thorin point out that the damage to the forest is only from a few people. If *all* went to war, the damage could be much worse. By the time a war was over, there might be nothing to fight over. Penny senses frustration from the Orc, but agrees with her companions - "I left my forest home to spread the word of protection, not destruction. But if all went to war, everything could be destroyed; you might win, but there might be no forest left by the time you do" (persuasion 19+6->25).

The conversation reaches a turning point. Krunik does not agree that attacks and war are the wrong path - but - the circle can agree to disagree and they won't take offence. Penny thinks that seems reasonable; but Francesc pushes a bit, asking for some kind of time for proof in our methods. Krunik asks if we would stop them killing - and Francesc says yes, we might!

Penny has to step in. It's hard enough to convert the people of Neverwinter to the cause of forest preservation, without trying to convert the cause of the druidic Orcs too! We can't patrol this forest and if our quest at Neverwinter succeeds then people wouldn't be coming here anyway. Francesc still says that if we are *there* when there's a fight, we'd defend people. Caught in the crossfire. Thorin tries to explain in Druidic. Basically, the uneasy truce is that we're not just going to attack each other randomly.

Francesc asks that if people do stop coming here to destroy, that they remember us kindly, not remember us as those that were drawn into a battle and killed some of their circle. He simply asks for the ritual crow of a fellow circle member to be returned - which we do. We think it's too risky to ask about the totem with the writing. Thorin apologises for the incident where we were caught in the battle. It's taken at face value.

As he leaves, he makes a whistle. The two wolves leave with him, but two more emerge out of the shadows *and* three giant spiders - they were hiding. We're lucky to have escaped battle.

Back at the camp fire, Doric is awake. She asks what we were doing. Francesc awkwardly explains the TL;DR, "we've kind of agreed to not kill each other for now".



### Day 7

In the morning, foraged fruit and nut is for breakfast. We cook the now-older fish using dried driftwood up on the banks. Doric is able to start a fire with magic. She thinks we can reach the outskirts of Neverwinter by tonight if we push. Since we're leaving the woods too, we scout for resources. Francesc looks for food; survival 21. Two fat grouse. Penny helps Thorin look for more herbs. Advantage survival 23! 4d8->16, that's 29 gold piece's worth of herbs. That's enough for a potion of healing, if we find a vial.

On we go.

The road gets busy. People are jostling. Carts. Gangs of young people selling wares. Perception: Thorin 12, Francesc 12, Penny thankfully 19. (Doric isn't having a bar of it!) One of the groups of youths, Penny spots, that they're trying to steal our stuff, hiding their actions amongst general mischief, sliding a hand into Thorin's pouch.

Penny draws her sword in flash and holds it by his throat. "Why are you attacking me, miss?!" "The gods would not like theft."

They show empty hands, trying to prove that they've stolen nothing - but Thorin is missing 50gp of his stash. "Give back my gold. Right now." "I didn't take any!" Francesc says, "Empty your pockets!" One is reluctantly turned out; buttons. Another; feathers, a fishing hook. Thorin, insight 26; he knows they're lying; long sleeves. They seem to be pulled right down... "What's up your sleeves?" "My arms sir!" Penny intimidation 15. "Stop the games, kid!" - contested against 16, dammit. Francesc uses the slugs as Mage Hand and uses them to basically shake down the kid. 50gp fall out of their clothing.

Thorin actually ends up with 50gp+d20->17gp more that were stolen by others.

Penny tries to convince them to go straight ("with those skills, you could join a circus or something!") - but nat 1 *again* on persuasion -> 7, she obviously has no success and sighs. "I think I'm with Doric. This is gonna be a shit town!" "I told you!" says Doric.

Closer to town we see makeshift shacks, market stalls and even more people. Farmers with laden carts and all manner of other people coming and going. The river is visible not far away too, with various boats sailing through gates into Neverwinter itself.

It's huge, but it's under construction; a whole section has various scaffolds and makeshift lifting winches, repairing damage from an apparent lava flow and earthquake over there. Nearby, an almost-finished colosseum with two huge statues dominates the area and, behind, a large castle, some 60-70ft high, right up against the coast and huge city walls that encircle the whole town. Those alone stretch up 40ft with frequent guard towns. It's virtually a city-sized fortress!

### 5pm

Progress slows. A traffic jam. We stand around. After a few minutes, we move forward a bit. Francesc and Penny aren't exactly great with cities and Dorin is largely producing a string of expletives making her displeasure about cities clear! Thorin, though, is more experienced. There are usually ways to expedite things - usually involving money. He says we should just walk up to the front! Despite Doric's protestation, and shouts from the road of "There's a queue here!" and similar, we march confidently on, following Thorin.

With Thorin's passive insight of 17 he quickly spots a guard he thinks is in charge at the main gates. He's checking papers. Human - in fact, all guards seem to be. Thorin helps Penny by explaining that we basically need to bribe him, so she tries persuading them, brushing dust off her armour on approach! He casts Guidance too and gives Penny 5gp - he reckons their weekly wage is probably not much more than 2gp, after all.

The look Penny up and down. Clearly a Paladin with an unusual entourage... "Madam... Knight? I presume? Is there an issue...?" "We're here to spread the word of Meliki. A holy mission. We travel on religious business, spreading a message of understanding. Gods wait for nobody and look after all, especially those with the safety of the common folk at heart..." Sadly even with advantage, and holding gold pieces in a subtle gesture, the roll is 8 and 8 plus 6 and the d4 Guidance is only 1, so that's 15. The gold confers a +5 and that's just enough (contested roll was 18) "...and this is a contribution from the church of Meliki for the good work you do!"

Well, it's only just scraping through, but it's enough. Doric looks surprised... Maybe we're not as different from her usual party as she thought!

Inside the gates is very different from outside. Beautiful cobblestone streets and large, 3-4 storey high stone buildings with impeccable stonework. Wow. We're going to need a map! It's still very busy of course, some people well-dressed but mostly commoners. Francesc flags down a random passer-by and asks for the "Purple Pennants" inn. "Edge of the inner city". Huh?! The blank look we give leads to more detailed instructions, thankfully.

We're warned to keep our wits and purses about us if going there!

### 5:30pm

* We walk past a very large market on the way. A tonne of stalls and a stage in the middle with some kind of recital going on. That looks like something to check out later.

* We make it to a fountain we were told is a landmark. People carrying notice boards, "New to Neverwinter! Get a guide! Local insight!" - etc. etc., with prices. What we need is a map!

* We reach another gate, huge, big walls - inner city entrance, we guess. On the right, a building with literal purple penants dangling. That'll be it.

There's a sign that says, "Full". I guess it has no beds. We're mostly here to drop off Doric and collect our 50gp!

We go in - and it's packed. Shoulder-to-shoulder more or less. There are performers playing music, some people playing pub games, bar staff around, drunken revelry throughout. It's more racially mixed - some dwarves in a corner attract Thorin's eye and he heads over to ask them about Ed. Francesc investigates by scaling some rafters! Penny sticks with Doric. Investigation 14. From the vantage point she spots the tribeswoman that was with Ed, though can't see Ed himself. She's having an arm-wrestling match! Francesc grabs Doric.

Thorin meanwhile avoids being drawn into drinks with the dwarves - wisdom saving 25 - the dwarven ale looks really good! - and they point out the "very annoying Bard" and "his weird giant wife"! So Thorin knows where they are too.

We all end up over near Ed and the tribeswoman. Ed is taking bets for something while she continues the arm wrestling match and - SLAM! - wins easily, against a big viking-like guy who accuses her of magic in a sulk. They spot us. Doric sidles up. "Can we get out of here?!"

Ed: "Oh! You were good for it! I believe this is for a job well done." He hands us a bag of 50gp. Doric wants them to leave, but we ask a few questions about the layout of town - a modest inn is fine; Ed recommends **Two Left Feet**, about 3 blocks away, heading away from the inner city. An unusual innkeeper but with "a really good heart". A very good tavern is nearby, a mead hall and ale house in fact - mead is **Half Brewed** and the alehouse is called **Southside Ales**. As for jewellery - and that mention gets Ed's interest, until we mention it's just druidic and orcish - **Shamlar's** - he collects things, items of arcane or cult interest, could be just what we're after. As for a good market, we've already gone past it. But for more upmarket shops, **Lion Shield Coster**, a Swordcoast-wide chain. Not the cheapest, but very reliable wares.

Ed says they're headed to the castle. Mean time, they've got other business to sort out.

Before we go, Penny says to Doric, "We really *are* here to try and save the forest, too. We'll do our best." "OK... Well... I enjoyed travelling with you. I want you to know - well - you're definitely not in the lower half of humans I've met!" - Penny laughs. "Thank you!" - "but most importantly, you fight well."

### 6-6:30pm ish

We beeline to Two Left Feet. It's getting later and some of the shops and traders will be closing, so we figure we'd better secure a bed before exploring more for food and drink in the evening.

It's a less "posh" area. A simple sigh; "Rooms. Breakfast. Board" - Two Left Feet. In we go.

It's quite a big door. Ed had aluded to this place catering for "all shapes and sizes" - the opening must be some 8ft tall. Behind a counter stands a slightly wrinkly-skinned "not quite human"! Half-something. No tusks, so not half-orc... Half-troll? They're 7.5ft tall - but they look kindly. Glasses are pushed up from the bridge of the nose. "Ah! Travellers. Are you looking for a room?"

We ask for 4, hoping we'll find Arturo somehow. Another person, apparently a partner, arrives; similar-looking, another gender, but half a leg missing and peg in place. Trolls would regenerate, so who knows what the story is there! They say that they have a room that will fit "four normal sized folk" or "two large folk". We have to share large beds though!

A room with two big beds would be 8sp a night. With board - breakfast included - cheese, bread and so-on that can be taken away, fresh fruit - would be 2sp each. We take the room for now as we don't know if Arturo will appear. We're asked how many nights we will stay. Francesc suggests 3. If we pay up front, we're told that we can get breakfast included for free! Good stuff. 2gp, 4sp.

(We realise both of them have missing right legs! Francesc asks; they got into an "existential scrap" but managed to escape.)

It's a good sized room with huge beds, clearly meant for large creatures.

We head to the market, but figure we'll try to see if Shamlar's is open just in case. It is! Opening hours say "10-10". We head in - Thorin casting Guidance on Penny on the way in.

It's a visual cacophany of tables and shelves packed with all manner of things, most of which we can't imagine people would want to buy! There are things like jars with shrunken skulls; a bowl full of glass beads on display; and an old-looking woman with stringy long hair died in various colours comes around the counter. "WE'RE CLOSED!" "But the door was open!" "What time is it?!" "About half six" "Oh! We're open!"

We produce the "rare art artefacts" from the bag of holding. She sweeps the bowl of glass beads off the counter! They go everywhere. She reaches into her eye and plucks it out, holding it close to the items - it seems to be some kind of magical seeing device. Penny talks up the items as best she can - persuasion 18 + d4->1 for guidance -> 19.

She makes a few guesses - mostly wrong! - about the origin of the items, and we politely answer as best we can without discouraging her. She offers 51gp for the six items, as a set. Seems a bit low... As a test, Francesc shows her the diamond. We know that ought to be around 300gp. She puts it through various measurements. "I would give you 300gp for this." At that point, Thorin asks about is Vallin medallion; no precious metals; she examines it but then looks uncertain. Almost angry. "Where did you get this?" - Thorin, insight 23. She's reacting to it warily. She thinks she recognises it and it makes her uncomfortable.

Penny chips in. "We got into a fight with some... Not nice people. We took this; we think it has significance."

She starts nervously looking around and casts some kind of spell. She runs to the windows and looks around for a while - curtains are drawn - paranoia? "What's got you so spooked?" asks Francesc. "Put away your eye!" she says. We figure she means the medallion. Thorin stows the item. "It's the Eye Of Vallin. Have you not heard? It's a new force in the land. I don't wantt o get caught in this! Take your gold. Will you sell me the set? 51 gold. Take your gold." "Yes!" says Penny. "OK. We're closed. We're closed now!"

Penny wants to get a bit more info - persuasion 20+guidance 4, 24.

"It is a new movement. I hesitate to call it a cult, because they're not a cult, but there is a new force; there are whispers of a Seer out in the desert, rising with dark powers. Seeking to supplant a god. Her followers all carry this eye. It is said that she can see everything that this eye can see. Take it out of my shop! I don't want anything to do with it. I've stayed under the radar with them and wish no ill to come into my house."

Thorin detects no magic no it, but Penny suggests putting it into the Bag Of Holding. If it *can* see, it'll have a hard time doing it from a Bag Of Holding!

We thank her anyway, and head out. Behind us, we see her peeking from around a curtain as the sign on the door is flipped to "closed".

Penny wishes she could've got the name of the Seer!

We have the other gold and paladium medallion from a while ago, and various spare bits of armour, dagger, chain and so-on. We end up with 45gp in total at the market, *excluding* the medallion. We look for jewellers and find a couple on the main street leading towards the inner city gates near the Purple Pennants, but they're cloesd. We'll have to come back another day, but at the same time, we get the feeling that we might get a better deal in the Inner City.

We find a vial for Thorin's healing-potion-to-be - 2sp.

Our thoughts turn to protection. Better armour. We seek Lion Shield Coster. It isn't hard to find - a large 3-storey building with a large shield sign with lion heraldry affixed on the outside. Inside, signs point to weapons & armour on floor 1, travelling, camping and food on floor 2, speciality items, kit sets and artisans tools on floor 3.

Thorin looks for shields on the ground floor. He can't find much that gives him more protection - nothing magical - but there are various different types in case he wants a change; so he looks for armour instead. Penny gets interested too at this point. She immediately sees a display of two truly beautiful, gleaming, decorated plate armour sets. It would befit the most devout of paladins! Sadly, she takes one look at the price tag, and has to sigh and walk away - 1500gp.

Francesc has better luck; she spots some studded leather armour that's well within our price range. Thorin notes that most protection is from metal, but that's no good! One Heat Metal spell and he'll fry. Druids are cautious that way. There are various hide and leather options though, but it's a difficult call to see if anything is worth it. Almost walking away, he spots suddenly in a corner some well-made, thick hide armour, that's in a good size and not just some barbarian scraps - this is a professional, properly made item. Given his dexterity, it makes sense to wear it; and at only 10gp it is a bargain! He decides to trade his leather armour for 5gp and we'll bargain for that plus 45gp for Francesc. Thorin also spots a cheap sickle, good for harvesting (1gp) while Francesc spends about 4gp on a set of cook's utensils.

That's 60gp all-in, minus 5gp from Thorin's old armour and another 5gp from Francesc's. We spot a couple of two-man tents - better than sleeping under the stars! - so that's 4gp more; a few blankets; 2gp. Thorin grabs a grappling hook, 2gp. 68gp total. Francesc gets a healing kit for 5gp and spots a really good quiver, 1gp and we grab a shovel - we buried people by hand before! - for 2gp more. 76gp. Francesc finds a hand drum, but doesn't want to pay 6gp. Penny sees a flute for 2gp and grabs it, 78gp and finally persuades Francesc to get the drum after all, 84gp.

Bargaining time! Guidance and Penny gives it a go, but with a nat 2 + 6 and d4->1 *again* we don't get any money off. 74gp after sales of older kit. Thorin and Francesc have accumulated a fair bit and pay 37gp each.

We exit.

"I've never really been one for mead", says Penny, still thinking about the 1500gp armour. "Southside Ales?"

### 8:30pm

It's a brewery with a large ale hall attached, with ale to take away - barrel, flagon and so-on. A "portable" barrel of ale costs 25gp. Penny measures it up with a bit of rope... It'll *just* fit through the neck of the Bag Of Holding... It's not a difficult decision. Penny and Thorin both unsuccessfully try to negotiate the price, but *then* we hear of a half-barrel. Ah... Only the better aleas are available. That's about 25 gallons - 200 pints! - with the cheaper end of the good ale at 5sp/ga -> 12.5gp -> Done! Well.. Actually... It's 14.5gp but if we return the barrel it's 2gp back. Even better, for 15gp, the offer us tankards and we manage to bargain up to 4 of them. **So, 4 Southside Ales branded tankards and 200 pints of good ale for 15gp**. Not bad!

5sp gets us food all round, and good food at the. Penny asks the price of a tankard of their best dwarven ale; but they don't sell dwarven ale. Oops! Best ale? Well, per pint, something like 2sp. Penny gets 3.

We sit, full of good food and ale, with a temporary sense of relief - though we know there is much to be done and in the back of our minds, we're worried about Arturo. It's nice to have money to spend and a good place to enjoy it.

The day draws to a close; we wander back to the inn well almost at 10pm, with vendors closing and the streets quieter but pockets of rowdy people outside drinking dens. Some guards are patrolling here and there.

Back at the inn, we realise we probably don't need to be on guard. We don't need to watch; we are able to, finally, sleep restfully... Inspiration all round.

(End of part 8)
