# RIPA: Part 4
## Session 4 (2023-05-02)
### Day 4, 4:30am

It's time for the museum Murkmire Stone heist. As we're getting ready, we're startled by a rustle in the bushes - but it's just Francesc! She's caught up with us at last. Penny gives Francesc the cloak of elvenkind back. After that, it doesn't take long to bring her up to speed.

The moon is still visible, casting strange, long shadows across the ground. Cassee tells us that she's *really* close to figuring out how to stop the egg hatching... Yikes! Not actually sure yet?! We've only got a day or two, in that case; but she thinks that once the egg is put into the Bag Of Holding, it should slow right down.

Arturo offers to be the lookout. He's human and *relatively* inconspicious. We agree; he gives Thorin the bag of holding.

The plan is for Francesc to use the cloak and her natural stealth to climb up to the roof and drop a rope. We walk into town. It's quiet - at this time of day there's nobody around, not even guards. At the back of the museum there are various crates and carts around. We check tarps in case the egg/stone isn't even inside yet! We don't find *that* but we do find all manner of trays and other paraphernalia which is probably related to the gala this evening. We figure we'll try right now, rather than in the middle of the busy gala!

Francesc investigates with Guidance from Thorin (18+d4->4 => 22). There's a cellar door next to all the crates, which must be for loading (and is on the map). While he looks around, he notices a soft light moving around the building on the second floor. Could be a guard! Apart from *that* the corner of the building looks freehand-climbable due to the decorative stonework, out of view of windows.

Francesc easily make the climb (acrobatics DC 15, rolls 21 + 1 from another Guidance). At the top, the wall has kind of faux parapets, decorative only. The roof itself is modern-looking with shallow pitch. There's a skylight. Francesc wants to check it first, lying flat and shimmying up the roof to peek over the edge. The angle of the moon gives a bit of light off to one side. Looks like there are lot of unpacked crates, even bits of waste wood and more, stored in the attic space. There's an *inside* latch which would open the skylight.

Francesc lowers the rope, securing the end on one of the faux parapets. Dex check for the knot: Nat 1+5! -> 6. Francesc is sure it'll be fine. Penny thinks she's heaviest to decides to go first - athletics check another nat 1+4 -> 5. As Penny grabs the rope and pulls on it, the rope starts to slide... Dex save from Francesc to catch it! 19+7->26. Phew! She tries the knot again. Dex check 11. The DC is 10. OK, it's sound.

This time, the rope being sound, Penny adv. athl -> 15 total, scales it fairly easily. Stealth disadv 3. She makes it up, but everyone knows it's noisy. Arturo sees the light approaching the window and uses Minor Illusion of a crow hitting the glass and flying off.

OK, so trauma, but two of us are up. Thorin's turn. Francesc and Penny pull him up, adv athl dirty 20 - easy (and a lot quieter) - also means the rope is coiled up top, but tied.

Thorin has the idea of ritual-casting Detect Magic in case of magical alarms/wards; about ten minutes later, while Penny and Francesc argue about rope tying, climbing skills and owed gold, Thorin detects a subtle low-level natural kind of magic in the attic. Something in there is magical, maybe transmutation. Thorin lets Penny and Francesc know.

We try to find something thin to get into the gap around the skylight frame - we don't have any daggers but Thorin does have a kit which includes a thin file. Proficiency-based dex check, 19 from Francesc, who has cook's utensil's proficiency and treats the file basically as if it were a knife of sorts. It takes a while but the latch swings down eventually and the skylight lifts open. We use the still-tied rope to help get down, not quite letting it touch the floor by coiling spare rope around the parapet, not so much because of the drop but because it'll help us get out later.

Thorin goes down. Detect Magic is still running; he sees that the magic is coming from a chest near the walls. He heads down to investigate and the rest of us follow.

The chest is about 3-4ft by 1.5-2ft; big; ornate - polished brass with painted wood panels. It's got a latch but isn't locked; a classic barrel top, decorations on the metal and rivets. Penny suspects a mimic! Nature check - 2+0. Oh. It's a chest. The magic comes from all around it, so might be the chest itself.

With Francesc's help, Thorin tries to look closer. Investigates - adv check, 1 and 1! Penny gets closer too...

...Roll initiative!

* Thorin 15
* Penny 10
* Francesc 8

As Thorin and Francesc try to examine the chest for symbols, Thorin thinks he sees one - it gets bigger - then the chest opens itself - ah. It's full of teeth. And a tongue. **It *is* a mimic!**

Thorin wildshapes into a Dire Wolf, expanding in size next to Francesc. She's still 5ft away on the diagonal, he's in front. The wolf gets advantage on its bite attack - but 2,5+5 -> 10 -> it's a miss. Penny draws her longsword, runs up and has a go; nat 2+4 -> 6 -> also a miss. FML. Finally, Francesc; she draws both shortswords and swings once with each. Nat 4 (!) + 7 -> 11. Universe implodes due to statistical improbability; campaign over. She tries again with the offhand. Same again.

The mimic - somewhat surprised by now at having been completely missed no less than four times - "looks" around and tries to *stick* its tongue to Francesc, who attacked twice and got closest to hitting. It misses. Phew.

Thorin tries again. He rolls a 1 and a 2.

Penny tries again. She rolls a 2.

Francesc tries again, aiming for the tongue. NAT 20. Thorin and Penny FUCKING HATE Francesc. Via Favoured Foe, 20 damage, good damage rolls. Swings with the off-hand; 24. Hits again. 3 more damage.

The mimic tries its sticky tongue again; it hits (21). 7 damage, and Penny is adhered to the tongue (grappled). Karma...

Thorin, once more; hits for a max 15 damage. Penny piles in; 12+4, hits. With a divine smite thrown in, 14 damage. The mimic's badly hurt. Francesc wants to take it down - hits, 9 damage... And the off-hand swing isn't needed. The sword slides under the tongue, severs it; the whole thing changes appearance into a strange pink mass, covered in teeth, no longer looking like a chest. Some semi-digested leather armstraps and a boot fall onto the floor. Euw.

Thorin notes that the magic around the chest has dissipated. While Penny heals Francesc, Thorin heads to the stairs and squeezes down them, still in large dire wolf form. The stairs come down near the privvies. No magic on that floor - he's on the lookout for the guard, too. Perception adv 5+5 (!) -> only 10. He can't hear anything moving but does see the opening beyond the privvies (which smell clean). We could possibly even hide in there!

Francesc squeezes past and tries to be stealthy - adv stealth only 4,3+5->9! Oh dear. After pushing past the dire wolf (hence poor stealth), she sees the big Allosaurus display. Grand stairs lead down. She sees a bit of light down there, possibly coming up the stairs. She whispers "hide!" - Thorin shifts back into a dwarf; all three of us hide in privvies.

Adv stealth - Penny 1,19-1=>18, Francesc 18 also, Thorin only 8... The guard comes to the top of the stairs; sniffs the air (dire wolves don't smell great, I guess) - and inside the doors we can see the light moving past us. We hear steps up to the attic - oh. The window is open, there's a rope and there's a dead mimic. Penny's closest. She opens the door, runs up and tries to hit him with the sword hilt to knock him out. Hits 15+4; 8 bludeoning. He's knocked out. Hopefully doesn't even get to see her but she can't be sure. Penny and Fran tie, blindfold and gag the guard with Penny's rope; we look for keys. There's a strange key card - Thorin tells us it's magical; an aura of divination - activation and deactivation of triggers and alarms. We take that. There's an old-fashioned key on a ring - big, brass.

Without delay we head to the door to the Murkmire exhibit. Thorin notes abjuration magic; an alarm. We need to figure out how to use the card. Penny tries arcana, but only 5; Thorin looks closely, 11; Francesc looks closer - Nat 20 + 5. On the side of the door, something that looks like part of the decoration around the door is actually the right shape and size for the card. The card has a decorative shaping at the bottom so it can't be placed the wrong way around. As the card is placed, Thorin sees the field drop down. It just needed to be slotted in and can be removed. We push open the double doors.

A very ornate room; pedestal in the centre; velvet rope; the pedestal has a plush-looking diorama built around it and resting in the middle on metal 'talons' is a very large - maybe 2ft on the long axis - emerald. Well, almost an emerald; it seems to be covered in scales that look like petals. Thorin detects a VERY strong source of magic from the item itself, but also a very complex series of abjuration magics on the pedestal, claws and underneath the egg. We look around the room - a fake story about the history - a woman called Alda apparently found it, with tools on another wall that are allegedly the tools she used to help find it. There are even drawing of her gifting it to the museum. None of that seems to be true - we have the ledger from the warehouse showing the purchase transaction, so even though we don't know if Cassee is telling the truth about how she found the egg, but we know that much of the story here must be wrong.

Thorin notes a display case full of other gems... No magic... But Francesc and Penny don't want to just steal for the sake of it. Thorin investigation for the rest of the room - 21 (Penny? 3-2 => 1. Yeah.)

* There's a vent hidden by a curtain that leads out of the room to the main exhibit area.
* The door we came in seems to have a mechanism that looks like it locks if something happens.
* There's a hollow bit of wall behind an info panel - Thorin is feeling the stonework and notices the difference.

The info panel is lifted off. It's a passageway/doorway, leading to the next room. Why has this new building been created with these strange secret passages?!

We investigate adjoining rooms through that passage. It's dark, but Thorin and Francesc can see. If we set off the "alarm" around the egg, are there any other doors that might close and block escape? Francesc perception 24. There is a row of displays in the "Underground Wonders" section; something looks familiar. There's a large stone here, roughly the same size and shape as the egg in a display case, but no magic here - just an alarm at the far end of the corridor which looks like it'd close off if we triggered things again... **The ol' switcharoo?**

Penny 22 athl, lifts the glass case without dropping it. Thorin gets the egg-like stone and Penny puts the glass back. We go back to the egg room. It's going to need two people - one to grab the egg, one to drop the stone. Penny will drop in the stone, Francesc will slip the egg into the bag at the same time & Thorin casts Guidance on Penny to help, then steps outside the room (with key card, just in case it still works).

We *both* roll a nat 1.

At least Francesc has the egg, but the stone smashes, the alarm sounds and doors lock. Penny wisdom saving 18, Francesc 22. At least we resist magical effects of the alarm! No paralysis...

We head to the secret door; we run through the exhibits to the cafe area. Francsc is a bit faster. Initiative rolls for order of movement:

* Francesc 20
* Thorin 14
* Penny 14

Francesc approches a corner where she can see a light coming up the main stairs. She prepares an action to try and fire an arrow that'll pin them. A dwarven male guard appears, running up the stairs; this triggers Francesc's prepared action. 26, definitely hits; 6 damage; it goes through the guard's *shin* and he calls "intruders, there are definitely intruders!" - another voice says "yes of *course* there are, the alarm's gone!" - runs up, a female dwarf; sees Thorin and points - "wait, you're a *dwarf*!" and Thorin uses the opportunity to try and bluff his way out of it. Deception check 14; it's not enough. She doesn't believe him.

Thorin tries a different approach and casts Charm Person on the same dwarf. He more or less repeats his previous attempted deception. She fails the DC13 widsom save and is charmed. "Oh! Yes! Right, I can see you have the key card too... Well, the alarm has clearly been triggered by someone in there who's trying to steal the egg - that's why you can't get in." She says she can't get in anywhere as the alarm's gone off and strongly suggests we all leave right now. The other guard is astonished - "Linda! What are you doing?!"

Thorin doesn't waste time and runs towards the attic stairs. And then - an Ankheg statue that was apparently on display suddenly *animates*. It looks around and more or less picks someone at random to attack; it seems to detect *something* and heads towards Francesc - but for a moment, almost goes past, looking as if it is going for Penny. Since Francesc is on the way, though, it makes a claw attack on the way past but misses.

Penny runs around, tries to attack but rolls at nat 3. She has presence of mind to use her last spell slot to cast Shield Of Faith to give Francesc +2 to AC since she's squishy and close by. Thorin shouts to the charmed guard, "help my friends! They're not robbers!" - it's contested persuasion but Thorin wins out. The guard starts clanging and banging things to try and get the Ankheg's attention - to distract it. Francesc risks an opp.attack to get distance (the Ankheg misses) and fires her bow, but (nat 2+9->11) misses.

The other guard tries to get "Linda" to see sense, but she's fully under the influence of the spell.

Thorin tries Charm Person on the *other* guard - and astonishingly, it works! Now both are on board with Team Distraction.

Meanwhile on Team Ankheg, the Ankheg tries to claw at Penny. Nat 1. It's not just us! It tries a second attack but luckily, that also misses. Penny tries her luck on an attack - it's only 14, but it's enough since this isn't a real Ankheg. Low damage roll tho, only 5. As part of the taxidermy exterior is carved off, Penny sees a metal skeleton beneath - it's mechanical.

Francesc uses Hunter's Mark *and* Favoured Foe. Nat 20! 2d6+2d4+2d8+5 - the primary damage is max, 21; 2d6->9, 2d4->3. An astonishing **33 damage**. It's very seriously fucked up by that.

(In terms of the guards, we know Thorin's been seen, but Penny has been hidden behind the walls and later, Ankheg while Francesc was mostly covered by the cloak - stealth 18 - face obscured).

The guards see the tide turning and figure they can leave us to it! They head downstairs! Thorin takes advantage of this to keep spinning the story about how we stumbled across intruders, "and the guard upstairs was part of it!" he says - once Charm Person wears off, *maybe* they'll still believe the BS?!

Penny gets hit by a claw attack for 10 (out of 18hp, so that's a bad hit). Strength saving: Nat 20 (at last) + 2 -> 22. Phew, not prone. It tries with a bite attack now, which fortunately misses, its metallic teeth scraping off the shield. Penny retaliates, nat 5, misses. Francesc has another go with the bow. Hits, total 16 damage across all die. The arrow hits something important inside the mechanism, which whirs and grinds to a standstill. Hearing Thorin spinning his tale, we keep hidden.

Thorin wants the guards to go down, because we don't know what else is downstairs; that works. We run up. The guard is awake. Penny has to sacrifice the rope that ties the guard, but her and Francesc decend on the other rope while Thorin unties it, casts Jump on himself and leaps down to the ground some 20ft below.

"We need to run away now" says Penny to Arturo. At least only Thorin was seen (!).

We make it back to the camp. People are still asleep. Cassee is awake, nervously waiting. Francesc, insight 18 and Thorin insight 23; do we give it to her? She's clearly truly very concerned. And Thorin sees that she's prepared all the things for the anti-hatching spell but isn't fully confident it'll work. But she doesn't want the egg *here* - she wants us to get out of town.

This is a good idea. We pack up camp as quietly as we can. Arturo then says - "wait! What about the daughers?" - we need to investigate Oak Street, that's right, but we're in no state. Francesc had passed a windmill with a strange apocethary attached - a crazy old lady! - and suggests we go there instead, so we're not too far from town.

By the time we get there, a thin line of light is on the horizon; dawn is about to break. Cassee starts her ritual. Short rests all round; Penny heals up.

"All things considered, when you think about what *might* have happened, I think that went really badly" observes Penny.

We have breakfast (2 rations used for all of us, knocked off from Penny & Francesc's inventory for now).

The first rays of sun appear in the sky. Cassee gets excited and asks for the egg. It's given in the bag - she tells us **we can keep the bag** so Francesc takes that... Cassee takes it out carefully and places it in the middle of a design she's made on the ground. She seems to pull runes and lines of light out of the air as she casts; she chants in an old, arcane Elven tongue that Francesc recognises. She puts her hands on the egg after a while; each rune starts to settle in and land on the egg as she continues to speak. Her voice wavers for a moment; then she retries, repeating an incantation. She's very nervous and unsure... She finishes.

The runes encase the egg. The glow brighter. Wisdom saving: 2+4 -> 6, 14 for Francesc and 10 for Thorin. Francesc is OK. She sees what happens...

* The runes glow but then seem to crack.
* As they crack, the petals/scales on the egg fold outwards like a flower.
* A very bright green light shines, so bright that Francesc has to briefly look away.
* At that same moment the sun crests the horizon, lighting the ground around us.
* Francesc sees Penny & Thorin's eyes turn white.

...but Penny and Thorin do not. Thorin:

* He sees the runes touch the egg, then hears a voice.
* "Thorin. Ah. It *is* you. Where have you been?"
* He finds himself in a room within the mountainside town of his childhood. His father is there.
* Thorin has been playing with carved stone in the shape of animals. His father asks what they are. "Animals!" says Thorin. "Why are you interested in animals?" "They're fun. Look at them!" "Did you make these? This is good skill. Imagine what you could do with stone on a temple or a building. I'm proud of you."
* Then his face seems to change, glowing from behind; almost taking on a draconic aspect. Everything around turns a lush, emerald forest green.
* Thorin is in a primordial forest, ancient, gargantuan plants, multicoloured huge birds, 30ft long centipedes. Thorin is a "presence" within this, watching in wonder.
* The voice now sounds a bit different; "is this what you were looking for? Primeval nature?" Thorin answers, "yes". "But what about civilisation?"
* Thorin feels himself lifted out of the forest, over old, beautiful treetop cities built by elves, on the edge of human civilisation on one side and dwarven on the other. "Is civilisation not important? What is your feeling about it?" "Conflicted." "If you had to pick a side, which side would you pick?" "Nature." "Interesting. You'd protect nature."
* Thorin senses a comforting, understanding presence around him. It feels very old. Wise. But somehow, reborn; there's a sense of wonder and isolation about it.
* Lifting higher above the treetops, sun breaking over the horizon...
* ...Thorin opens his eyes and sees that the egg is fully open. Inside is a crystalline green form, curled up.

Penny:

* The light of the runes cracks slightly. This is a bit concerning.
* The runes fly out at Penny, shattering; she shields herself instinctively.
* When she is able to next look back, she hears a voice speaking in Elven. It sounds like one of the elders from her parents' treetop village.
* She stands in front of Penny in a Tolkien-esque, Lothlorian elven doorway, softly lit from behind - all the tropes. "Are you ready?" "Ready for what?" "I thought you wanted to join the children on their lessons" "OK!" "Come with me"
* Penny is led into a classroom, like a small amphitheater. Children sit around, listening to teachers stood centrally.
* Despite having wanted this for years, Penny feels somehow disconnected. It's all very intellectual which aren't all she really thought they would be - it doesn't really open her mind, she isn't as bright as the Elven children.
* These aren't her people, as much as they try to welcome her. She probably can't live here. Someday she'll have to find her own path.
* The voice - sounds slightly older now? - "...Penny, this is what we had when we set out, and we want you to have it" - Penny's mother hands her a small wrapped up satchel, which Penny still has today; she gets to pick a trinket.
* There's a sense of a presence, always watching; a green spirit of the forest; she got the same sensation when Penny first encountered Francesc (there was a poisonous snake about to strike her, but an arrow stopped it - drops of venom on Penny's shoulder, that's how close it was).
* Next a jump, to Francesc and Penny running to a tree to see who was first to the top of a tree to see the sun rise. For once, for the first time, Penny wins; sees the sun rise...
* ...and the egg has opened.

We realise that the spell hasn't worked as expected. The egg wasn't stopped from hatching - it was accellerated. The hatchling has reached out to find a sense of belonging to a work.

### 7am - LEVEL 3 by Milestone

We all receive a gift of the Gem Dragon - a Feat.

* Penny bumps Intelligence by 1. It means the Telekenetic aspect is at a very low DC, but goes to the next even number up, so stats improve across the board for INT-based checks; and it's in keeping with the story above).
* Francesc bumps Wisdom.
* Thorin bumps Wisdom also.

(End of part 4)
