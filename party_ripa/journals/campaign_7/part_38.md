# RIPA: Part 38
## Day 40, approximate (time of day unknown)
### Annam's Cradle, giant keep, portal room

The party has joined Thorin at Annam's Cradle, via teleportation helm, after his dramatic two kilometre controlled fall. We end up seeking the stone tablets in a giant rock pillar, which looked superficially natural but on closer inspection appeared to be artificially constructed but ancient, into which we discovered a giant-scale keep.

Finding little of which we could make sense on the entrance level, we descended and discovered some kind of partly-collapsed temple complex. Down a short corridor, we stepped into a room and were assaulted immediately by some bizarre effect, centred around a portal in the room; Francesc and Arturo have been badly hurt and seem frozen in time, or otherwise "glitching"; only Penny and Thorin managed to somehow escape the effect.

Thorin, Arcana 19. A very strange effect is indeed coming from the well/portal; as Francesc and Arturo "phase out", he sees if he looks closely that they are still there but sort of transposed into a purplish-black plane filled with wet, slimy, purple tentacles where air would be. It's not a magical effect, Thorin knows; the barrier between planes has been weakened here - another plane of existence is spilling through. The walls around are a mess too; it looks as if rock near here has been thrown to this other plane, then returned back to this plane in that strange, melted form.

Penny ADV perception - this is her subclass! - 1,17+2 -> 19. It is, specifically, an incursion from the Far Realm. She uses Channel Divinity to help bolster their wisdom, charisma and intelligence; they are clearly fighting.

Arturo and Francesc have meanwhile figured out (via rolls) that they need to get away, but get away at just the right moment - when in *this* plane. Arturo contemplates Misty Step; Francesc wonders if using Gaseous Cloud would help. Arturo sees solid items around the room; he figures he might do better (Arcana 13) to use Telekineses to move *himself* in places Misty Step might not go. On himself, he thinks that he might be able to push further than the usual 5ft.

Thorin and Penny contemplate spell-based solutions but simply can't get a "grip" as they phase in and out of our plane too quickly.

Arturo's first attempt leads to him pushing against the tentacles... The timing isn't right. Francesc is still trapped and sees Arturo struggling; so she tries changing into a gaseous form (last L3 slot).

Still trapped, INT saves are needed again - fortunately, ADV thanks to Penny's effect. This time, both save against any further damage or exhaustion. Lucky! But they're still trapped.

Penny and Thorin continue to resist the effect too. Penny wants to push the two of them back with her Gem Dragon trick, but she can't time it right (perception only 6). We both do, however, notice that the middle of the well is now only the far realm - that well exists in the other reality - so this really is a full-on portal. Counterspell wouldn't work, but *maybe* there might be active portal magic that could be dispelled? We shout that to the other two, hoping that they might be able to do something.

Francesc, though, is trying to get out of the room in her gaseous form. D20->13, she manages to slide out *just* past the door instead of further into the Far Realm - and in so doing, realises that any different timing could've caused a lot of trouble. Arturo tries again too - perception Nat 20 - Misty Step this time works perfectly. Both are outside the room and clear of the effect.

This leaves Thorin and Penny. Thorin is keen to try another exit, though; Dispel Magic won't work, he thinks; both of us - Arcana 16 (Penny), there's a way to close this, there are spells that specifically close portals; we've shouted to Arturo - he knows that too; and we realise that none of us know the spell.

Thorin really wants to try other exits - use the helm, throwing a rock to the other two or something. But we only have one charge left and we could therefore get stuck. Penny tries to talk him out of it; persuasion 21; he relents and we quickly leave the room, rejoining the rest of our party. Penny checks the other end of the corridor, but whatever was down there - temple or otherwise - is sealed off. Arturo and Francesc are slimy! Arturo starts experimenting; outside the doors, everything is normal, so there seems to be a distinct barrier; he tries pushing a potato through on a stick. Both are wrenched out of his hand!

(Thorin notices a mashed up potato on the ground, phasing in and out).

He gets another potato; hands it to Penny; "Here's your far realm detector!"

We elect (Penny needing a rest for her Channel Divinity to be used again) and get to the turret room that had the broken stairs upwards. Arturo casts Fly on Penny so she can lower a rope. She drops a rope and people climb up easily. We get up there; a broken up room, but with a corridor. The potato is thrown; no problem; we follow along. A less damaged area a short distance along has a 30ft high ceiling with long strips of carvings in Giant runes. Francesc reads them. They're sagas - stories; about this place being a stronghold; about the ancient ones seeking to recreate their version of a Garden of Eden before their ancestors (now considered the Gods of different kinds of giants) fought amongst themselves in their hubris and arrogance, eventually being cast out.

Big door on the right (but Arturo lost his dragon when he was hurt). Big room ahead. In the distance straight ahead there looks to be a similar tower to the one we came up with a stair or two heading down, but the rest of the space is full of collapsed rock; it is impassable.

We try the nearest door. With help from Arturo's Telekenesis, Penny can't budge it (ADV athl 17) - but then she realises it's hinged on the side she is pushing! She moves the other side; ADV athl 24. It opens (with a lot of effort), swinging in from a left hand hinge.

This room is damaged with more rock problems. But this isn't "molten"; it looks like a giant spike of earth has
been pushed through. It looks like a Giant-sized Wall Of Rock. Thorin, insight 28; the nature of the casting seems to indicate that - in his estimation - a Giant spellcaster (!) has done this mid-battle. It's been here for long enough that it's weathered. Whatever might be on the other side is probably long gone.

We decide to go to a corresponding door further along (Thorin . This one hinges differently! Penny fails on the first attempt and succeeds on the second, very similar to last time. The door grinds open, this time as double doors, opening in the middle.

There's a lot of damage here and a set of shelves - not with stone tablets; but with, in fact, giant scrolls made of thick hide. Francesc springs into action. We learnt that this is **Korantor Keep**, once a religious bastion - a place of study and meditation, a place of significance in Annam's Cradle. Further, we read that with a lot of magical power a ritual was enacted that created a permanent tear to the Positive Energy Plane - the rift above acts like a kind of sun for this land. It took hundreds of years to complete all the life rune writings we've seen. The plants and animals are all from the giant "Garden of Eden" - to the giants, it's all normal. Strife, inevitably; their role is to try and bring the giant folk together - the different tribes. There's no mention of the caste system though. Some scrolls describe the power of the runes, too, but don't say how they're used.

So, all well and good - but no magic scrolls.

Arturo could transcribe them - in case it's useful in future - in an hour. We might end up back here for a long rest later. For now, we move back into the big space and head East. An amazing tapestry is hung on a wall, 20ft high and tall, with a weaving of Dian Castra (daughter of Annam). On either side of a narrower hallway are 20ft tall carvings of mostly cloud and storm giants. They seem to be presented as sages - custodians of the Keep, perhaps.

Thorin perception 19, Penny 22. Heavy double doors at the end - but - warped walls, melted. There are double doors ahead; and a side corridor to our left. We throw the potato down that corridor - it is sent by Francesc on an arrow - and is mashed as it gets close to the wall. Penny thinks the wall "North" to get to the double doors looks good; she figures that could be safe - but behind her, Francesc and Thorin keep close to the Southmost wall, as far from the melted walls as they can go, on the diagonal corridor. Arturo joins Penny. He has a potato held out! Penny uses that to approach the middle of the doors, perilously close to the bad wall; but the potato is OK; Penny pushes, with Telekenesis help; two attempts yet again; and the door opens.

Arturo WIS save +5 with Penny - 20 - it's the same room. The well room. Impossible, really; it's on the wrong floor. Reality is warped. We back away!

...So we went up 20-30ft up that tower, followed a level corridor, and ended up opening a door to a room that was in the basement...

Meanwhile, Francesc and Thorin follow the the corridor. They reach a room heavily affected by the melty effect and Thorin hollers for Penny! Walls and ceiling are molten but the potato rolls OK, so Thorin tries crawling, asking Penny to keep close for aura protection. She crawls too. Ahead there's an untouched wall, strangely, with a rune on it. Whatever that rune does, stops the room from being affected. All around it there is damage, but *not* where the rune is.

Francesc is behind, and - History with Luck and Guidance, 24 - it's similar to dwarvish and giant word that seem to be related; the word for "order", "lawfulness" or a general lack of free will, or lack of chaos.

A potato! We etch it onto this world's most lawful potato and throw it towards an area where a previous potato got mashed. It lands and is fine.

And with that - we draw runes all over ourselves. Head, hands, feet, arms, legs... We don't know how far away from the rune something needs to be, in order to be affected. The one on the wall has some space around before "melting" begins, but not much. We're quite a sight!

We follow down a bizarre corridor, very heavily melted. Double doors - this time opened on first attempt! - seems to lead to some kind of relic room. A censer some 8ft tall is made of gold and brass, with etchings and carvings to let smoke though. Hanging in a wardrobe, door ajar, is a beautiful 25ft tall silk vestment in blue and gold. "That should fold!" says Francesc! It looks religious. But Penny points out that this whole place is related to the genesis of their very Gods - to ransack this would be about as insulting to modern Giantkind as one could really imagine.

An altar and vases that once held flowers, now long rotted, indicate that this place wasn't closed down "cleanly"; it was abandoned.

A "conversation" about grave robbing ensues! The vote is tied but Arturo gets the closest persuasion. As he takes down the vestment, he sees a religious symbol, clearly very significant. He suggests we take this to the Giants; Penny and Francesc are certainly onboard with that. The shield-sized holy symbol *just* fits in the Bag Of Holding. Rolled up, the vestment takes up the space of two tents so our Bag Of Holding is almost full now.

Thorin notices, on the alter - dwarven and giant runes being similar - a tablet that seems to have some kind of prayer request. As best he can tell, it's to pray for "calm heads and peaceful resolution at village of Hiatea's Hearth". The implication is that these people are downriver - the ruins we spotted before going here.

We exit and carry on down the bizarre, twisted, melted corridor and end up looking North, ish, towards some strange space that Thorin is sure (via Insight) is from the basement. A transition space of some kind (Penny might recognise this but - insight roll, 1+2!)

Arturo - 16 arcana; the room isn't really magical but there are a lot of magical effects along the walls. Thorin, religion 20 - there is writing on the walls **that is not in Giant**. Runes of binding, clearly arcane but the magic has possibly worn off a long time ago - binding or controlling? Thorin wonders if we should rest! The room is also not 30ft tall. It's only about 10ft tall. This isn't a giant-sized space and the stone is totally different. There is a row of stone-carved columns down the middle, too. A broken, collapsed door is just visible in the distance at the far end of this long room. Three stone tablets are also at the far end and stairs to the left lead *down*.

Penny, Detect Magic. No magic remains. There are indeed remnants of protective runes, but not much else. There's a background that tells her, too, that something is very different here. It's dark, depressive. She feels like it's not even the same plane. **Another plane seeping in?**

We're low on resources. The party agrees to return back, retracing steps, to get to that big scroll room to long rest. On the way past the wall with the big protective rune that we copied, Francesc examines the rune; the wall is not too significant, but perhaps what was next to it once was - only now, it's the strange, warped passage. That, we realise, was not there originally; it isn't just a melted form of an existing corridor. **It did convey us to another plane.**

We get back to the scroll room. Arturo starts transcribing. The "law" rune doesn't come up once. It's a written language, of course, so the rune wouldn't be literally written down, but it *does* mention the "life" rune - though not the "death" rune. Francesc copies the copy, to be able to give a copy to the giants.

Watch (in an unusual order):

* Arturo: Perception 15
* Francesc: Perception 25
* Thorin: Perception 10
* Penny: Perception 6

...but DM requests each of those turn into WIS saves. 20, 27, 15, 15 - as each of us try to go to sleep and when we then wake up, Francesc realises something is wrong. She wakes Thorin who's next on watch. She realises that whatever is going on means that we're not recovering as we would expect. For one thing, she realises she is *asleep* - not meditating - she hasn't woken Thorin at all. It's a lucid dream! We all gradually realise that we are able to influence the dream. Our companions are believable, but it's all imagination. Or at least... That's how it feels to us (*transcriber's note - am very confused at this point, notes here are unreliable*).

(The 15 rolls are fails and now Thorin and Penny get a point of exhaustion; now we all have one).

Francesc, at least, is actually asleep. She doesn't know how to wake herself up from a dream. She tries slapping herself in the dream! She's seen people do that to other people in order to wake them up. But it doesn't work; and she takes 4 points of psychic damage, too.

Arturo thinks it's a dream too *yet* sees Francesc slapping herself. "Don't worry about it, I sleep every night, it's normal!" he says and tries to reassure her further.

Thorin and Penny go through the same thing; they believe they've woken up from their watch, but then think something is amiss, believe it might be a dream and aren't sure if their other team members are real.

Meanwhile (due to saving throws) Arturo and Francesc start to figure things out. They start to think they are *not* fully in control of the other person, so start to untangle possible-dream from reality, increasingly of the belief that they're really awake. Arturo glances around the room; at a brief glance it seems the same, until he wonders if it is decrepit and crumbling - it isn't now. But he's confused. Did it always look like this? There are heavy footsteps from outside the room.

Arturo says this to everyone. Thorin and Penny do hear this. So Thorin now wonders if he's asleep or not - he tries casting Dispel Magic sort of on himself. He feels the spell cast and work but nothing changes.

Francesc pushes the door open. It seems to open easily, which ought to be impossible. Penny says "That should be impossible, so this is either a shared dream or shared hallucination."

A tall stone giant wearing long flowing clerical robes (though not as fancy as the one we found earlier) is walking past on what is now a long, ornate, undamaged hallway. Arturo shouts after him asking for a rune of wakefulness - the giant doesn't appear to hear at all. Francesc tries the same in Giant; the person keeps going. The giant is heading for the well room door - or at least, it was in "our time". The door is pushed open; we run after; then there's a voice in our head that seems to transcend language:

* "Don't run. It's disrespectful"

Penny fast-walks, like Kath & Kim! The others slow down a bit...

* "...Don't touch the well. Don't interact with anyone"

The double doors open and we get in. This is a different room. There is a well, though; fountain-like; there's a domed roof with gems installed like stars into the roof. It stretches up high and there seem to be bits of sunlight coming through some of the gems and crystals at the top. Arturo runs for the place where we saw the "Lawful" rune and heavily melted corridor. Instead, there is now a small meditation alcove with a cameo of Dian Castra. Meanwhile, the stone giant fills a jug with water from the well; throws in some (giant) flower petals; walks around it twice; there's no door on the other side; she comes back out, walking past us. The other two scatter but Penny holds her ground - the giant walks "through" her. CHA save - 30! - for a moment a sense of self is threatened; a loss of identity; she pulls herself together though. She's being pushed out of the way, as if with invisible force; 8 force damage. "It's fine, all a dream!" she calls.

* The "voice" sighs. "I told you to stay out of the way!"

The giant stops, looks around, "Who's there?!" - looks down, gasps; "Small folk?" - drops the jug, which smashes and water goes everywhere. She doesn't seem aware of the other three. Penny is now visible and tangible.

Penny calls, "Not a dream!" to her companions but the giant says, "Of course it is a dream! This is the temple of dreams. But you are not from here. You don't belong here. How have you come to be?!"

Insight (group), Francesc 25. She's trying to figure out whether or not to sound the alarm - Francesc shouts it - but this makes the giant jump, now aware of her.

Now Penny has to help Francesc try and be persuasive. But in this, we learn that this isn't a different time - it's a different *plane*. This is the realm of dreams. She knows the "physical" realm is in a mess and she knows that. This place mirrors it somehow.

(A wild magic surge happens from Arturo - trying to help combat his exhaustion and be persuasive - a fog cloud spreads out! But the giant is above it. This makes Arturo noticeable too.)

Thorin and Francesc work together for insight; with Luck, 24. Arturo, persuasion ends up 29.

* She is the last guardian here
* She chose to wait out what was happening
* A new member of the order - a Storm Giant - arrived, rose through ranks very rapidly
* Played around with runes to capture and harness their raw power
* Wanted to fold space to create more space
* Somehow warped reality, collapsing the third and first floor together into one point
* This destroyed the well, which was only magic in that it generated water 100s of feet in the air!
* But this warped the whole area
* The rest of the order fell trying to fight back Mindflayers who came through
* She discovered that the fold had connected to a strange catacomb in another plane, not Giant
* They call it the Hall Of Bones
* To try and serve her purpose, she deliberately fell into the Sleep Of Stone Giants after crawling her way in there and putting up a lot of wards to try and wait out everything
* Her body is in there somewhere, right now, asleep
* She doesn't want us to retrieve her body if things aren't safe!
* If whatever was happening in the Hall Of Bones is still going on, don't wake her (things in balance)
* But if the wards are faded or things are resolved, wake her up

So the binding magic was for things down there - are they still bound?!

* Francesc asks about the room with the stone wall in it - just hides toilets!
* Thorin asks about the stone tablets - she thinks that's all after her time; but she thinks that if there was ever any such thing, it would be well guarded by other giants - Hiatea's Hearth
* She thinks she has been dreaming 6-700 years (doesn't seem long enough to us...?)
* The mind flayers were defeated; of those defending, most died; some were trapped in the Far Realm; a few left
* Arturo asks about the death runes; she doesn't know but points out that there are other giants in the area (or were), any of whom might be responsible

Thorin asks about treasure! If we can survive the battle to take anything we probably deserve it... Just don't disturb their holy sites. Arturo nervously asks about the holy symbol; that's OK.

* Francesc learns how to wake her up if we need to. It'll need that same holy symbol and some words (which Francesc learns).
* To wake up ourselves, go back to the room we were in and "go to sleep"
* If this giant is still in her dream realm, we can revisit by (really) going to sleep again in that same room

We all eventually wake up, for real - long-rested.



## Day 41

We make our way back to the Hall of Bones. Thorin goes to the far end to check the stone tablets and broken door. Through there is a strange room with two large brass braziers, ashes inside, with an altar beyond holding a sarcophagus.  Penny "pings" with Detect Evil & Good; nothing. Whatever was here left a *long* time ago. It would've been about 10ft tall.

Penny, surprisingly, Investigation 19-1->18. There's writing all over the alcove and sarcophagus; the sarcophagus has a drawing on the top which looks like a three-headed creature. One humanoid and male with triangular eyes that look Jackal-like, long, wild hair; either side, wolf heads; the body is a strange muscular-looking mass, not human, with eight large hair spider legs.

Arturo can read - just - the writing. It's similar to Infernal; technically he thinks Abyssal. It seems to be a series of exaggerated exhalations - stories of glory. One word *might* be the creature's name; INT-based check; 16; "Mis-ka" or "Mees-ka". This *isn't* the name of the thing in the sarcophagus. The drawing/carving is of a deity; perhaps a priest was entombed here.

Thorin notes (based on stonework) that the door was broken down about a century ago, *from the inside*. It was magically destroyed. We figure this qualifies as "something that was bound is no longer bound"!

We go into the room mid-way along the hallway. D20->15 from Francesc. There are double doors, "normal" size; about 12ft high; Francesc can open them easily. Curled up in the back of the room, lying asleep, is a stone giant in clerical vestments. There's also a faint, ethereal figure standing over the giant. Francesc insight 24; this wraith-like figure is trying to steal something from the sleeping giant. Penny notes via Divine Sense that this is undead, but in a strange way; odd planar things; this creature is in the Ethereal Plane. It seems to be trying to extract *something* from the head of the giant, *in the Ethereal plane*.

Francesc attacks! 31. The magical arrow flies *very* true. It connects with the creature's face, passes through leaving wisps of smoke; the creature turns to regard her; a pulse spreads out, some kind of ring of green fire. A skeletal face with one massive, glowing eye now regards us. There seem to be wisps of memories or something, leaving from the head of the sleeping giant and going *into* the cowl of the creature. We see one hand is strangely mechanical; the other is withered, almost cracked dry skin over bone. All round it runes start to spin rapidly; it seems the last of what it wants to take is being taken; it is thrown back; and a strange being, a torso of twisted, gleaming gold with broad shoulders, a metal spine reaching gold hip bones, is seen. No legs. It throws back its cowl and the eye scans over us. A wave of sickly energy hits us.

"Yes. There is great potential here! May we meet again. But until then I have my eye on you!"

STR saves - Penny and Arturo are throw back out of the room, prone. Francesc dodges, Thorin likewise. They see the sigils kind of "click" into place somehow, halt, then spin into a vortex - some kind of portal - nothing like they've ever seen - the creature jumps through and the portal closes with a loud, concussive blast.

Random die roll: leads to strange charms. Thorin and Penny have the Charm Of The Eldritch Eye; Arturo and Francesc have the Charm Of The Creeping Hand.

Penny picks herself up and clanks back up the stairs. "Ouch. Can we wake up the giant now?"

We do it. She wakes up. "Sorry, someone stole memories or something?" "I don't appear to be missing memories!" - we describe what we saw. Arturo points out that you wouldn't know missing memories! We also mention that the creature in the sarcophagus has gone. Turns out it was a powerful mummy - **maybe even a mummy lord**. Could this be the "oracle"?

The giant is very grateful to have been woken - she's the last to carry the secrets of her order, possibly the only way to track down this mummy. Arturo offers to take her to a Stone Giant village when we're ready to leave (we can portal her up and out).

As she moves we see beneath the clerical vestments a breastplate with the Lawful rune.

Thorin asks about spells that might bind mummy lords. The stone giant tries to explain the principles and magic required; rituals, that take an hour; a Magic Circle, to prevent something leaving a space. There's another one; an hour again; cast Planar Binding after Magic Circle. This is for extra-planar creatures. But if the Mummy Lord belongs to this plane then it won't work.

She offers help off the tower, but we can fly; Thorin figures he can get us to the (ruins of the) village quickly. Meanwhile, Francesc notes that the helm is fully recharged, so it was dawn *somewhere* while we "slept".

Thorin transforms into a giant flying beast. We jump aboard. Thorin makes his way to the village, up high.

It takes a while even with the giant beast's giant form. On approach, **we see a stone giant engaged in battle at the river's edge with a truly massive creature, crocodile mouth, frog throat, long tail, huge claws!**

(End of part 38)
