# RIPA: Part 18
## Session 18 (2023-09-26)
### Day 15, 5:30-6pm

We are inside Candlekeep, heading to The Hearth for food (and maybe gossip).

We head to the bar first. There's a half-orc bartender; she's cleaning up a mess someone made - food all over the bar! We're asked where we're sitting - where's good for gossip? Here! At the bar. She's called **Klyga**. We get set up at the bar and place our order. We end up sat in order of height! Thorin, closest from the door; Francesc, Arturo and Penny.

We opt for the daily special, a "Johnathan Sandwich" - huh? - basically cured meat, pickles and so-on. Thorin and Arturo go for mead; Francesc and Penny beer.

Penny asks a rather broad question about whether or not Klyga has overheard stuff about Vallin and so-on. The name did come up, recently; nothing about a town to south. Penny tries to clarify. She thinks a while. "It was an older guy who turned up maybe, three weeks ago? Four weeks ago? Something like that. Can't figure out what they were here for - I presume research! - and he mentioned Vallin? Or Vallinus? Can't remember much else. But then last week, we had someone saying they were headed out to look for Vallin." He had a research assistant but she can't remember who.

Thorin asks if they mentioned much else. "Hmm... Go and talk to **Little One**. I think that's who they spent the most time talking to." We hear that this was an Avowed, too; so he had no research assistant. He left; she remembers, **Mayastan** was his name. One of the senior readers, in line to be one of the greats... Specialised in histories of the realms and the nature of magic. She wonders now if the old fellow a couple of weeks prior had something to do with Mayastan leaving.

We ask where we find Little One - she points to an ogre sat in a booth!

Francesc figures speaking Giant might help so she heads over with Penny for moral support. He's reading a book with a mug of some hot drink. Francesc asks if she can join him; certainly! She sits to the right. The book is called "Storm King's Thunder", he explains. Francesc recognises that the ogre is wearing a Band Of Intellect - that's why he's so articulate. She asks about the old guy a while ago asking about 'the seer' - no, he's **Xemru Thal**. He's from an *order* of seers. The House of the All-Seeing Eye. Little One isn't sure why he came; apparently he delivered a book that caused quite a stir due to its rarity. He left quickly - the next day! Never even had a research assistant. Mayastan's conversation was different - was just being very nice to Little One! Talking about what he brought to Candlekeep, what he was capable of; just being supportive. On an expedition out; looking for a portal of some kind?

Francesc asks if there was any hint about where that might be. Nope! But he pulls from a Bag Of Holding a set of beautiful books, tokens and mementos, putting them out on the table. "It's just strange that he'd give these to me - I never saw him without these - I remember at the time thinking it was odd, but he was being so nice."

Little One doesn't know what the book was called. The Readers definitely would!

Meanwhile, back at the bar - Thorin, perception 28. Someone is speaking Dwarvish. Low voices, two of them, sat at a table kind of hidden around a corner from the bar. One says, "It's not right. No... I just - I don't believe it anymore. I don't think he's doing the right thing!" "Stop. You're just having cold feet. Remember why we're doing this. Stonky is right! Stop overthinking it. You're the only one." The first speaker is unconvinced. The other says he just needs more to drink. That seems to distract them for a moment.

At this, Thorin quickly orders a couple of drinks and heads over to the table. They're surprised, as if they didn't expect people to even know they were there! Thorin offers them drinks. He sees that one is much older; looks surprised; the younger one looks startled. "What? What did you overhear?" "Nothing significant!" says Thorin. Deception 6! They take the drinks, but clam up; but the old one suddenly opens up - "Why don't you join us?!" - the young one seems angry.

**Buron Sternmetal** is the older guy; the younger is **Trop Thunderhue**. They maintain the mechanical/magical parts of Candlekeep; they tend to get overlooked, but they see everything. They start to wrap up, talking about how books had to be moved from a tower that wasn't properly maintained and the new tower isn't fully warded yet... "What does Stonky think about all this?" asks Thorin, trying his luck; but he's just told to *forget* anything he heard by an angry Trop, who drags Buron out.

Back at the bar, we compare notes over the sandwiches. Penny asks Klyga if she knows who 'Stonky' is? One of the engineers. Promoted recently she thinks? A Rock Gnome. This all starts to feel like a heist.

### 7pm

Finished up and paid up (3gp), we check the smithy again. It's open. An older Gold Dwarf is there, called **Kheril**. The "Hammervines" is shown in a big family crest. Seems like smithing is competitive and he's won a few things. We introduce ourselves and get into things about the book; it turns out that Kheril knows Runic Giant and *that* is what we were missing when trying to understand that second book.

The book speaks truly; the person had spent time in all three organisations that are written about. It's useful background information about giants, their history and society, but otherwise probably of more interest to actual giants than it is to us.

Arturo asks if he wants to come with us when we meet Fire Giants! They respect skill after all - he would be delighted, *if* we could ever find any. He trained with Fire Giants, but never completed the teachings. That's where he learned Runic Giant, far to the East towards the Waypeaks.

Eventually we head off to bed.

## Day 16
### 8am

Francesc is already awake, Thorin and Arturo next, Penny sleeps in until woken! We grab breakfast at the tavern and remember that we were told books would be dropped off at our research room overnight. We head to the Pillars and find our room, use the rune sequence we were told by Tamra and find some books on liches, as promised.

There's also a note; a couple of books on the Cult of Savras were moved to the Firefly Cellar temporarily (wait, isn't that the place without proper warding?!) and we could read them ourselves. Anything about *achieving* lichdom is entirely restricted.

People are talking about liches but Penny has a far-off look then says, "but wait, isn't that the library without proper warding?!" - and explains that books about Savras are possibly vulnerable to being stolen - either by chance (the dwarves?) or by malicious actors. We *know* that people are after this info. Should we get there quickly, before anyone else?

It's agreed. We head out immediately to find the Firefly Cellar. Penny asks someone, Persuasion 25; but do we have permission? Penny shows the note from Tamra. Ah! Right. *Technically* that cellar is not behind the emerald doors... A loophole! We are given directions and we follow them promptly. "Firefly Cellar" says a sign with and old-school 'basement record store' arrow that points rightwards then downwards.

We go down two floors to another sign - dusty, partly cleaned - for the cellar again. There's a trap door underneath; a true cellar door. We open those and descend.

It's a strange space. We overlook a small circular room, opening onto a much larger space that's gently lit by hanging jars full of fireflies; it's around 100ft across. Rows upon rows of bookshelves, curved, form broken rings below. A wooden-railed, banistered balcony looks down to the level below. Hanging on chains in the middle of the room is a sculpture of marble, which looks like a flock of birds - but they're all books. There are 8 alcoves equally spaced around the circumference.

There's a pulley-based book lift that's partially raised off to one side. There are also stairs behind us; we could carry on downwards. There is movement below. Penny heads down, but Francesc stays up by the door. Arturo casts Light on his staff and follows Penny. Thorin follows behind, leaving Francesc on the upper floor. We reach a lower level; there are more bookshelves, but a very interesting bookshelf is stationed in the middle. It looks like it has been cleaned and repaired but not yet restocked. Piles of books are present. Someone is up on a very tall ladder, putting books back. Elven. Penny calls out "Hello there! We wondered if you could help us find a book or two?"

The person calls, "Ebda? Are you back already?" and another voice further away calls, "I never left!" - the elf on the ladder now looks down and is surprised to see us; she calls out "Oh, visitors! I'm **Scribe Varnyr**. Sorry for the state of things!" - and explains about restoration being a 'work in progress'. She asks Penny to take a stack of books to Ebda - "he's over there!" - she says.

We take over the books to Ebda, a human, who insists that we ask the Scribe if we're after books. We go back to her, and then she calls over Ebda; he seems flustered and short-tempered, saying his daughter is sleeping. Penny wonders if he's covering for something but, insight 20+2, it's for real. His daughter is the most important thing to him. He's not as old as he looks but his pessimistic outlook has perhaps aged him. He's apparently a bit annoyed that someone called **K'tulah** is being allowed to study down here, rather than in the dorms.

It seems the books haven't been unpacked and catalogued yet. He can show us the box they're all in and we can look through it if we're careful with the books. We start searching.

We do quite well and find 3 books. We ask the scribe if it's OK if we take them to the research room - but that's not allowed as this is considered part of the main library. We can take them to a room and read them in the cellar. She tells us to ask Ebda; he's unhappy of course; but he relents and brings us directly across to the other side of the circle from where we entered, where in an alcove yet another set of stairs descends down and reaches a corridor about 80ft long. We're taken along, via some intermediate room off the corridor, and eventually get shown a room with a desk, a bed, and that's about it! We're left in peace so Penny fetches Francesc and we start researching.

Arturo, Thorin and Francesc look into the books (Penny's not got investigation as a strong suit).

Francesc: Investigation 26. Thorin 12, Arturo 10 - even with Tides Of Chaos (that was worse!). Between the three of them:

* Two of the books - from the Sword Coast - refer to it, and our research assistant referred to it, as "The Cult Of Savras". But we thought Savras was an actual god, so it's strange to be called a cult.
* One book refers to it as an actual religion; or more of a belief system of some of the Eastern Empires (where this book originates).
* The Sword Coast books seem very unconvinced that any of it is real. There are no temples to Savras in our area. Worship of Tymorah has replaced that (a Goddess of Luck, rather than a Goddess that claims there is predestined Fate).
* The Eastern book talks about the temples and the House of the All Seeing Eye, in the Anauroch Desert.
* It refers to the ancient Netherese City now occupied by the House is **a city of many portals, including portals to other planes**.

Meanwhile, Penny perception 19+2 -> 21. She hears a very confusing mixture of sounds coming from a neighbouring room across the hall. One sounds like it has a young girl singing; but very complex songs and strange sounds and, oddly, the same girl singing in snippets come from a further room. Like a conversation between three people almost. There's the sound of sweeping, of gears grinding and what sounds like a tower of books falls over. Penny investigates the strange room and listens at the door across the hall. Can't hear much (adv perception only 12 total). It's the same set of strange noises, then silence. It repeats. Penny opens the door and looks inside.

A loud male voice shouts, "Get out of here!" and a large-beaked creature wearing a hooded cloak, sat on a bed with toys in front. But again the sounds repeat. Penny tries to persuade the bird creature to talk to her; but as she tries, it repeats in an angry female voice, "How rude! Do you have no decorum!" - Penny has no idea what to make of any of that, nature check 4+2, so she apologises, closes the door and returns to where the others are reading.

After about 4 hours, we wonder if we should try to re-examine another book. Perception checks all-round; Thorin and Arturo roll high and for some reason find out that all four of us are humming the same tune. Francesc asks who started it? History Penny 19-1->18, she's heard the melody before, down here, someone was humming it... Arturo tries to stop humming and can, but notices that he has to concentrate on it, like he would concentrate on a spell.

Penny thinks this might have something to do with the door next door where she'd heard the child singing. Not humming though... She knocks quietly. A child of about 7 years old opens the door, wearing a egg yolk yellow cape. This is **Gailby**, Ebda's daughter. She's singing a different song now, smiling. In her room, Penny notices lots of drawings on the floor. Penny asks, "What are those drawings of?" "Nothing!" she looks embarrasing. Penny is still humming though. "What is that song you're humming though?" the girl asks. **K'tulah** might have been singing it? She's very furry with a nice tail (a Tabaxi). The bird is **Crinkle** and they are a **Kenku**; we don't know that race; they are the caretaker.

Penny says the others can keep reading books if they want but Penny doesn't like this whole "forced humming" business; Arturo suggests she focuses on not humming, but first, Penny casts Detect Magic. There is of course magic coming from just about everywhere. Nothing on the little girl and the rest of our party don't seem to have any consistent magical auras that might indicate a common enchantment - perception 16 - it doesn't look like any spell is active - **but** all of us seem to have some very mild, minor, well, _something_ - a colour of magic on the four of us and the girl. Penny can't determine the school, but it feels similar to a curse!

Penny drops the spell and concentrates on not humming; she tells the others what she found, Francesc decides to keep reading as that's important, but the rest of us go to find **K'tulah**. She's one level up, sat against a bookshelf, surrounded by a few books that she's found, flipping through them and humming a tune. Penny introduces herself and asks about the tune she's humming. "What tune?" - Thorin's insight roll isn't great but she seems to be telling the truth. She finds the same as us - it takes effort to stop humming. She's not left the Firefly cellar all day; she's seen Crinkle and Ebda, Varnyr and that's it.

(Meanwhile, Francesc - investigation 20 - finds from the Sword Coast books that there is are sinister notes behind the Savras _cult_ - they believe so strongly in what's written that they might act to try act on those they think might be stopping that from coming true; "Fate Changers". They might be violent.)

She suggests finding Varnyr, who's left the Firefly Cellar. Thorin wants to find Ebda first. He looks frustrated. He's humming! He's annoyed. "This earworm! I bet you it's that Tabaxi!" and so-on.

### 6pm

It'll be interesting to find out if we stop humming when we leave this cellar; and we want to find Varnyr, who's still not back.

We head upstairs. We hear the sound of creaking on the stairs, then a thud, then some incantation is spoken; and there's a strange thrumming sound. A wave of quiet passes through; Silence? Reader Varnya comes down the stairs. Penny immediately asks, "Is that spell to combat the humming?" - and she sighs - then with effort stops humming! - and says, "I'm really sorry! There appears to be a situation that is unfolding... For the safety of Candlekeep, I'm just going to seal us off until we can figure out what's happened. When I first arrived at Candlekeep, the Avowed were concerned about a Singing malaise; a book merchant was brought down here after he began singing a certain song and more and more Avowed started. But this was a *long* time ago, when I first arrived, some 500 years ago.

It seems that this is some kind of *infectious* thing. And so we're locked in here! K'tulah starts to freak out until Penny talks her down (DM says - "what's good for the kitten is good for the litter", which is what Penny does *not* say for fear of offence!)

Thorin has an idea. Get *everyone* down here together, then all of us focus on not humming all at the same time. It takes a while, but (with Ebda's help to fetch Crinkle) - well all focus on stopping.

"Let's go through what we know" says Varnya. "How did this start?" - we didn't run into K'tulah and Ebda was annoyed at K'tulah for humming; so K'tulah was before the four of us, it seems Ebda started after we met him, we probably made Gailby start humming. Then Penny remembers that Crinkle made a "falling books" noise; we end up visiting where that happened. It's near a wall in the lower library gallery. It's all now arranged beautifully, everything sorted. Penny asks how long ago that all good sorted out; Varnya says 2 days ago. Varnya will try and find out what book the merchant brought all those years ago. We will all investigate singing curses, earworms, and so-on while she does that. Ebda and Gailby head off, K'tulah looks into singing curses.

Penny investigates the bookshelf area with Divine Sense. She detects some kind of evil presence, but it's the whole area; not any specific book. It's kind of weak. Penny asks for help carefully unloading the shelves in a way that's easy to restock after...

...dex saves requested! Penny and Francesc take 3 bludgeoning damage; as we start to take books off, the entire set of books flies off the shelf smashes into us! We both take 3 damage. Thorin and Arturo dodge. The books fall to the ground and the shelves are still there, unaffected. Some books are left, from around the edges of the middle section that is now exposed. The shelf is open-backed; just stone, the shelves built into that. Thorin investigates the brickwork - is it new, moved, hollow behind...? The brickwork looks ancient. In the rest of the cellar, the brickwork does seem older though - a few more centuries. And the newer brickwork is hollow. Francesc and Penny exchange glances (is there a merchant buried behind here?!)

Thorin uses his mason's tools to try and remove a piece of the blockwork - but the skill check isn't great... A brick cracks. Ebda runs in, horrified, Crinkle in tow; we explain (with his frequent interruptions) and he relents, partly because Crinkle starts saying "told you so!" over and over. Apparently, Crinkle might have already suspected something!

Thorin gives up being subtle and chips away the stonework. Behind is a scull! It's not magical, just a scull; Francesc examines it with Mage Hand. Penny uses Divine Sense again. The scull isn't evil; the patch of wall still has that remnant; surprisingly, some of the books on the wall are also showing signs of it. It's as if something spread out and diffused, tainting what was around.

Suddenly the lights dim and start to flicker. We hear Gailby calling for her dad. But then the lights come back on; and then it gets colder... "Dad! Dad!" calls Gailby again. Francesc runs over to find Gailby, Ebda having left the room. She's clutching a drawing pad. Francesc looks after her. "Where's dad?!" she asks. She brings her back to the room with all of us, while Thorin then heads off to try and find Ebda. Meanwhile, Penny tries casting See Invisibility, to see if there's anything going on; but there's nothing visible around. Nothing in the ethereal plane, nothing invisible in the room.

Thorin moves down to the now-dark lower floor; he can see in the dark; 26 perception. He hears the sound of humming! Ebda is on the ground, eyes bulging in terror, clutching the side of a bookcase, and seems paralysed; he's not humming the melody now, he's singing it quite loudly. He doesn't see Thorin and Thorin can't shake him out of it. Thorin runs up and gets Penny. She comes down, and immediately sees a strange shade in the Ethereal Plane in front of Ebda, holding his head, mouthing in time to his singing. She shouts "There's a ghost on Ebda! Get the others!"

Penny tries Abjudge The Extraplanar; no effect; she takes swings with her sword; she connects and uses Divine Smite. 20 damage - so it's affected, must be some kind of dead; it shrieks and dissipates. It's gone somewhere else. Damn.

Ebda comes back to his senses but screams, then collapses to the ground. Gailby screams and runs away...

...A ghost chase is afoot!

(End of part 18)
