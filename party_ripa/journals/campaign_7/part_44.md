# RIPA: Part 44
## Session 44 (2024-07-09)
### Day 44, bastion outside Candlekeep

The party has returned from the Underdark, at the cavern complex of Web's Edge (about an hour on foot from Menzoberranzan). There, we encountered a false priestess of loth - actually a Yochlol, a shapeshifting demon - that was apparently working with a Spider Dragon, most likely on behalf of the Demigorgon, protecting the first segment we have encountered of the Rod Of Many Parts. We defeated the demon and recovered the rod segment, but the Spider Dragon - a bizarre and awful creature, but nonetheless a true denizen of our plane and not an inter-planar invader - lives to fight another day. The party teleported away using the Helm along with a sole surviving rescued prisoner, a huge cyclops called Gertrude, who helped us in the battle.

After studying the segment for a while, the party fell into bed exhausted. We awake in the calm and safety of our bastion outside Candlekeep. Gertrude is asleep outside.

Over breakfast, we discuss what to do about the rod. We could ask Mayastan but he doesn't know about the rods and learning about our quest might put him in danger. Arturo suggests Candlekeep. We can research planes and see if any descriptions match planar visions we see when we hold the rod segment; we might also try to get a small bag of holding or similar, to avoid having *everything* in one place - keeping the rod in a pocket dimension seems prudent, to reduce the chances of it being uncovered or influencing us.

### 9:30am

With Francesc present, we get into Candlekeep easily. We figure we should ask for a research assistant and a private room to reduce the chances of the rod being seen. We should also, "just in case", always either have the rod in the bag, or the rod held (since we have the anti-scrying amulets).

* Penny feels that there are all manner of demonic incursions and surely the Demigorgon or their minions will notice the missing rod. Who knows what's looking for it.
* Arturo concurs and adds that we're also not trusting VS or VS at this point either, and we want to continue to hide this rod segment until we have any idea who *can* know about it.
* Francesc and Thorin are on the same page, unsurprisingly, though Francesc's state of mind is perhaps a bit more calm that Penny. Thorin admits openly to being tempted by its value - maybe Vallin would release him from his curse/bond with the staff in return?

As we discuss it more, talking about where we feel safe, we realise that we feel safest when we keep moving. Right now, at "our house", which is potentially well known - it feels safer but really, we are probably at greatest risk. This time Francesc leads that idea, because as a hunter/ranger, she is used to moving.

We end up with a big pile of books about many, many planes. Where to start? Penny suggests that we each hold the rod and see what vision we experience, then describe it. Are they the same?

Francesc starts. WIS save, 27 (with aura). She's very centred and focuses on the visions. She discusses with Arturo about it; should she try to figure it out or describe it? As she does this, Penny realises there's a confusion factor in the rod initially so uses Channel Divinity to give ADV on the WIS save. Francesc decides to think back - HIS 24 - brief glimpses of utterly alien creatures, a very different sky, a very, very different plane. She starts checking books and marking places.

Thorin is next. He wants to try and *see* what's going on (Perception) to fill in details. WIS 20 (a bit low, even with +4 aura and divinity ADV, but it's enough); perception is only 12 though! He sees a bunch of crates. They're blocking his view! **He's too short to see** (!) and can't actually move, to physically get around or over them. But it feels like a hold of something, like a ship; oh! The rod is *in here* somewhere. He's sure of it.

Very different from Francesc. We think that it might be - which plane is it on vs where on that plane is it?

Arturo is happy to go last. Penny gives it a go. Also WIS only 20, but that's enough. Perception... For a minute she can't see (nat 1+2) - lots of boxes - then remembers (Inspiration, 15) to turn around! She's now looking at the hold of a ship, crates piled around; but turning around - the rest of the ship **is missing**. Jagged ages, as if smashed. There's a swirling mist of purple and glittering light; she thinks she sees distant islands; but one seems to be floating and rotating! She then spots one or two boxes floating, out in the air beyond.

Penny hands it to Arturo. WIS save, 16; a bit more of a trippy time for Arturo! He gets a wave of sensation, as if he sees and feels and hears everything all at once across time but compressed into a moment! He tries to see if there is *anything* he can seize on, opting for magic; Arcana; he can kind of make out a strand of what's going on; the rod itself seems to help calm the chaos a bit. It's as if he's holding a piece of string with time running along it. A train is going through the sky, lying out tracks as it goes. It is loaded onto a ship. The ship takes off; a huge plane behind it, rising out of the middle is an apparently endlessly tall pillar of rock. Around the middle of the rock is a huge torus; a city is built on the inside of it. The ship has taken off from that city. It's not really a sky and a ground; it's a ground above, and a ground below. As if on the inside of a torus itself. Gateways, portals, and more. This ship was flying - away from that place.

He describes this and Penny is sure it's Sigil, given that's the rune related to our best-guess order of the seven poem parts.

Francesc investigates books to try and match everything up. 29, plus a d4 for Guidance; but the DC is above 30 in any case. We learn of planes, the astral sea and so-on.

We don't know where in the astral sea this thing might have ended up, or even if it *was* the astral sea. But we know it came out of Sigil. Flat luck roll requested: 9. Needs more. Perception roll: Arturo saw a flash, he's able to "zoom in" - **the galleon's name was visible briefly** - **Lambent Zenith**.

OK, so, how do we get to Sigil?!

On the previous 30+ insight role, we know that there *are* ways to get there; doorways. But we can't just "portal" there. It's a protected city. Only approved, protected cities work. Penny says, "but we're in Candlekeep? Surely someone here might at least know where to find one, short of one being actually on site!"

We ask our research assistant. "Hmm! Let me ask a few people..." - in the end we try to persuade people for an audience with the Prime Reader. Penny and Arturo work together; Arturo persuasion 29!

* They don't have a portal here
* They re-explain what Francesc already knew...
* ...but then also mention "Lady Of Pain", which sounds really awesome - runs Sigil; maybe even the creator of Sigil; maybe even the creator of the whole multiverse
* If we ever come near here, we *must* avert eyes else we might offend her and be transported into a maze dimension where we can't die but can't escape either
* The closest person that *might* be able to ask - and we're only told this because of the high persuasion roll! - is that **Lady Laeral Silverhand**, current Lord Protector of Waterdeep has a sister in Sigil, **Alustriel**

So we thank them and, without further ado, decide to go to the tavern. We're told there's a good chance of someone there might've come from Waterdeep, and we may be able to barter for an object that we can use as a helm focus. There's nobody selling things like bags of holding on the Candlekeep campus, but there are plenty in Waterdeep too.

Arturo doesn't waste time - he goes straight to the barkeep and asks if there's anyone from Waterdeep. "Yes! There!" he says, pointing on this floor to a corner where four people are sat with something that looks like a dragon; not a dragon*born* though one of them is, but more a small dragon acting as if a rather large dog. The dragonborn and dragon seem related. There's a tall, muscular female human with pale skin; she has an amazing dark metal helmet and full-on set of armour that's similar to Penny's - probably adamantine. Hers has a deep dark red cape, too, though. Penny's not at all jealous... `;-)`

Next to her is a figure in a long, thick cloak, dark purple laced with silver and light blue. The hood is up. Staff leans next to them, glowing slightly. We start to get the feeling that this is the "make us feel bad" party. There's a half-orc too, wearing a mottled kind of brown and fawn coloured fur shawl, a necklace with lots of bones - and a crown! It has deer antlers. As for the dragonborn, they're sat on a stool, hunched over, does also have small wings so maybe not dragonborn? Seems male, looks brass dragon-like though.

Arturo looks closely at the half-orc. Is there any indication that they might be related to the "isolationists" we met? The horn crown looks familiar, but this is a half-orc and bears the markings of being in civilisation a lot. They have a staff with leaves growing out of it too.

They're sat around a huge turkey, eating it, except for the wizard-like one who sits back with a chalice of wine. There are some other drinks on the table. The dragon around the table has some bones in front of it - looks like it has had food dropped for it. Penny notices it has big back legs but, actually, no visible front legs; claws are on its wings, which are wrapped around it. **A drake**. Looks poisonous too.

Arturo decides to get a chicken for the drake. We awkwardly try to introduce ourselves; they look us up and down. Persuasion 33! They (rather unenthusiastically!) agree that we can sit with them - but they don't move; we have to squeeze in. Penny and Francesc fit between the mage and knight. Arturo and Thorin sit opposite. We consciously avoid the drake! We can't all sit though.

We try to open conversation by asking about Waterdeep - our travels take us there; how's the city going? We figure out that the half-orc is friendliest and they (she, we think) - **Kolli** - is from "around Waterdeep" but **Debrah** is *from* Waterdeep. At this - "Debra Landers, Paladin" she says to introduce herself. "Penny Jones, also Palladin!". The half-orc points to the *half-dragon* we learn, **Vercatus Caramanthus** and the drake is **Vercatus Jr**. Vercatus says, "I wouldn't bother telling you where I'm from - you will not know where it is! I can assure you, you have never been or heard of it before!" Arturo tries to be charming; "Well, we always like to learn". "I'm from a wilder part of Krynn" - surely that was in the books - we all roll history and somehow, our highest roll was Francesc with 12! It *was* in the book, we just don't remember... Arturo tries to brush it off as if we weren't all trying *really* hard to recognise it.

(This isn't getting any less awkward).

"And this is..." says Vercatus - and they slam a dagger into the table and says, **"No!"** - as he slides the dagger back out, we notice an unusual serpentine blade. Arturo casts Mending on the table. As he spends the minute casting the spell, as he's walked next to this mystery party member, he looks - perception dirty 20 - the fingers of the hand are very thin, gaunt, dark-skinned but ashy, almost malnourished; very thin arms. The air round him seems cold! Penny, Insight 15, notices Arturo's raised eyebrows and worries; she activates Divine Sense. The spell-caster is undead!

(We pretend not to have noticed).

Arturo decides we don't really trust them, so just says we're collecting nic-nacs from different towns. We even show them some of the tankards. "What, do you do that too?!" says Kolli and opens a bag, starts to pull way too many items out - must be a bag of holding - and has a spare tankard from the Yawning Portal! They'll trade. We have spares of the Southside Ales commemorative tankards - Neverwinter - and they haven't been; but in the discussion, the undead pipes up - shithole of a place, full of undead and brigands! - "You should go, it's fun, live a little" says Penny - and in the process of the discussion the party at one point give away their name; **Wilim**. The name Velindra Shadowmantle comes up and that really raises ire. "She promised our people freedom, a second chance, a new world. She stabbed us all it the back! She destroyed families, bloodlines, lineages... She had better run if I ever see her again."

Thorin, perception check, darkvision (21); Francesc is further away but tries too (17). Thorin sees under the cowl now. Very gaunt, sullen, sunken face; Thorin picks up on the unnaturalness of it all. He can also look under the cowl; tattooes up the arms, over the top of the head, which is shaven.

We swap tankards.

They talk more and start asking *us* about what we've been doing. We talk about being interested in stuff that protects against underdark incursion; Debrah asks what might help - persuasion 27 - Penny rather unwisely is convinced to pull out her sword and show it. This of course makes Wilim flinch badly, but Penny, perception 15, also notices that Debrah seems to be steeling herself too - trying not to react to the light. Francesc notices; Religion 19; he asks her what *her* cause is too. He asks what Debrah's cause is. "An avenging angel! I do what is needed to make things right" - it's righteousness, but she avoids the word "good" at all times. "And would you follow the rule of law to achieve that, or do *anything*?" asks Penny. "Law? What good are we without law, except barbarians?"

We start to suspect a lawful evil group.

They recommend places to go at Waterdeep. Yawning Portal to be close to the action and search for treasure in the dungeon beneath!

In turn, Arturo asks where they're headed; perhaps we have recommendations. In discussion they reveal that they're looking at mythology, elemental planes, perhaps even leaving this one. Arturo asks about Sigil but the imply Wilim has "some talents" (we suspect Planeshift). Wilim decides he's tired of conversation and leaves to "do some reading". Penny tries, with Arturo's help, to get to the heart of it. "So what is it you're actually looking for? You say treasure, but it must have some purpose." ADV persuasion 26; but ADV deception only 14. Unfortunately, she knows I'm hiding something and I'm fishing!

She hedges "Suffice to say for now, we're trying to find information that could help us decide - not to put too finer a point on it - the fate of creation itself."

As the conversation dances around Penny is almost persuaded to maybe open up with more information and trust this group, as an enemy-of-an-enemy, but then Debrah starts on, essentially, a "Might Is Right" situation and power must be "in the right hands". And that means - someone. How do you decide?

Penny and Debrah get into a rather intense theological discussion! Arturo finds an obvious way to exit, "oh it's getting late!" - and we manage to withdraw.

We have to assume they're looking for the rod too. But who are they working for? Not Velindra, clearly. Vallin? No... **Arturo suggests Vecna**. Ah. YES.

* Francesc and Arturo cook up a plan to bribe their research assistant to tell us what they're looking for
* Arturo will also bribe *our* research assistant to not take bribes
* This is the best plan we've ever made

Thorin objects. Overruled.

* More talk. We modify the plan - what if our assistant is bribed for more, or their life is threatened?
* We go for misdirection instead - we'll get our assistant to research Krynn, as that's our next destination because we heard that name from a group we guessed were after something important and believe they slipped up in making it.

We find their research assistant first. They're carrying a big pile of books and when Arturo tries to stop them, he says "well, sure, put these down first..." - perception 21; the spines of the books describe modes of divination, communing spells, and the history of old - ancient - wars. Heavy history, almost mythological stuff - perhaps related to Vecna.

"100gp to come with me and we'll have a word" says Arturo (!)

He's a bit confused! But he agrees to follow Arturo into a side room... Persuasion ADV (thanks to bribery!) **32** (woah). It was 100gp just to talk; there's another 100gp to give us a list of the books they've researched. Arturo hands over the 200gp. It turns out they remember who we are - they were involved around the edges with the tower incident that led to the creation of our bastion.

"They give me the creeps!" he confesses. He mentions a "Red Wizard" - OK, so that's what Wilim is, whatever 'red wizard' might be...

* They asked to find battles that involved extra-planar entities, big powerful ones, who might have interceded in them
* Not necessarily deities - "just" very powerful extra-planar beings
* Especially interested in powerful artefacts that might've been used and what happened to them afterwards
* Asking for information about a particular organisation called the **Golden Vault**
* Very interested in addition about a particular class of objects in the Astral Sea; **the husks of dead gods**
* They have drawn some conclusions; came up with two areas of interest - two "hub" areas - they think the Golden Vault has a vault in the city of Sigil, or the Radiant Citadel (in the middle of the ethereal plane)

We reconvene. Before we speak, Penny holds up a hand. "We have anti-scrying. But we don't have 'anti someone stealthy hiding around a corner listening in', nor 'anti group of powerful people hiding around a corner waiting to jump us'. We should get to Waterdeep as soon as we can then find somewhere to go and talk more." We do have to go through the front door before we go anywhere, though. And we need to tell people at our keep that we'll be away a while again! We elect to just bypass the misdirection for our assistant. It's not like we didn't already look for a laundry list of books that give away much of what we did.

### Bastion turn

(...deferred for next session...)

At the bastion, we offer Gertrude a room... A stable, or we could add an outbuilding, and so-on! She's welcome to stay as long as she wants. She agrees, and says she'll probably stay until we get back.

Francesc looks quickly at the quite new library. Krynn books? Investigation 28. Yes! A *Draconian*. Creatures made from a corrupted (!) metallic dragon's egg. They're closer to dragons than Dragonborn. We set Mayastan, as a backup plan, on Planeshift and so-on - ways to travel.

We head up to the teleportation circle. We collectively decide that the tankard is legitimate - the collector did seem legitimately excited about it! We decide to risk it. We have got 3 full charges back on the helm...

### Yawning Portal, Waterdeep, 2pm

...and through we go. DEX saves all round!

* Thorin 10
* Francesc 26
* Penny 18
* Arturo 11, wild magic surge, 17

Francesc yelps and grabs onto a rope hanging above - we've appeared on the edge of a *chasm*. We're in a tavern, but we're on the very edge of disaster. The drop is *huge*. Various ropes hang from a floor above. People all start yelling - huge commotion. Arturo grabs Francesc; Penny had enough of a foot on the ground that she's able to grab a railing.

Penny swipes to grab Thorin, but nat 1! - he changes into a bat at that very moment. Disaster avoided!

We manage to get ourselves onto the floor proper. Ground floor, too. There are some three storeys above us. Penny looks to the bar. A guy with a dark blonde handlebar moustache stands there. She runs over. "No time to explain, terribly sorry, we need an obscure place to stay. Somewhere adventurers normally wouldn't". Persuasion 22.

"Woah! Woah. There's a lot going on here. First of all, you look like you just teleported into my pub! And teleported over a several thousand foot drop. That's a safety hazard. You've broken at least four bylaws teleporting here and now - well, everything about you reads fugitive. I like the sound of that! If you're running... You know the one place people will *not* expect you to stay... The most obvious place. The most famous inn in all of Waterdeep! Which is *me*!"

Penny asks why the tankard took us to the edge of the hole... Turns out ore is expensive, so he mined it himself - from the portal! We should probably be thankful we didn't end up in a portal at the bottom.

He's **Durnan**. Francesc still thinks we should go somewhere else. Durnan overhears and asks what we're afraid of! If we're *really* trying to hide - we should "go underground". Literally, below the ground. He realises we've never been here before. He tell us to pop our heads out the door. Arturo does so.

We're on a hill. A beautiful castle is off to one side. There are rows and rows of 3-4 storey buildings with wide streets between, down to a port and harbour, islands with strange closing gates enclosing everything, huge city walls; he looks up; it's a *massive* city. But people outside look - proper. No weapons. Carriages, carts, people on foot, people on horseback - **a beautiful metropolis**! We haven't seen anything like it. It's *nothing* like Baldur's Gate - not just a total dive.

Durnan explains that only about a quarter of Waterdeep, though, is above ground. There's far more below!

Penny isn't keen. Anyone might see us and sell us out for a few gold to the party we met at Candlekeep. Here, we've been seen rather obvious on arrival, but people are drunk and merry and come and go - maybe we stay here!

Durnan agrees. We'll have his protection! He argues that this place is the last line of defence against all of the demons below. Penny mentions he probably should double the guard; he asks why; Arturo mentions the Demigorgon. Durnan writes an item for the job board to "stop the Demigorgon entering this plane again, enquiries within!" - Thorin, quick as a flash, takes a tab off that job. **Price is discussed - 10,000gp.**

We get a room on the top floor. Fourth. We guess at three nights... Our own bathroom (!)... 12gp. Comes with food!

Up there, Arturo talks about what he discovered. OK, so maybe Sigil knew it had something important, was transporting it to this Golden Vault group or actual vault or whatever, and either crashed or maybe even was attacked to try and steal the rod. We think maybe it's in the astral sea, crashed into an old god husk, whatever *that* might be?!

Right. Laeral Silverhand. As we get down, Francesc mentions to Durnan that we saw nobody was carrying weapons. Durnan gives us a pamphlet! Waterdeep's civilian rules; we need a licence to carry weapons, so we're e.g. working as a registered bodyguard; else they must be stowed. At this, Arturo asks about Handy Haversacks. **Southern Ward**, we're told. Lots of lean-to market stalls around a central square that acts as an all-day, all-night bazaar.

Penny is allowed to carry the "hilt of a sword". Staffs are OK too... Isn't that biased in favour of magic users? Oh, you can't use magic in the city without a licence.

So why are we here? Well hypothetically, if we needed an audience with Laeral Silverhand...

Durnan laughs so hard he accidentally pulls the spigot out of a barrel from which he was pouring ale.

He tells us, as least, where to find her, but *money* is needed. This is the richest city on the Sword Coast. Arturo tries to be persuasive, with some subtle guidance from Thorin... Persuasion 22... Durnan has a friend, **Mirt**. He might be one of the "anonymous people on the council who is unnamed - I can arrange a meeting with him... And that's all I can do...!"

He also mentions that a carefully-passed piece of gold can get us a long way.

We go shopping! Turns out a haversack is more rare and expensive than a bag of holding. We end up haggling at Ala'Din's Cave, and get a very plain, hessian, beaten-up looking bag of holding with 500gp discounted to 400gp (Penny ADV persuasion with Arturo's help, 29).

Penny is persuaded to find a way to hide the new bag inside her armour, so we find an armoury. For 5gp, they provide a comfortable way to store the bag under the armour. She has to remove her top plate to access it, which takes a while, but it's very secure. Nobody's going to pickpocket it!

We wonder if there might be magic items that could help us. But we're a bit tapped out on attunement. We are directed to Balthor's, best described as "The K-Mart of magic stores". Trouble is, everything we ask about requires attunement. Arturo would find a Ring Of Mind Shielding very useful but has nothing he can drop safely. In the end, we leave without buying anything. Arturo, arcana 20, finds an Amulet Of The Planes. Basically you can cast Planeshift yourself! It works on kind of a luck basis... You must know the plane and location where you need to go. DC15 INT check, but if failed, D100, 1-60; random location on the same plane; 61 or higher, random location on a random plane. Penny says outright, "Too risky" - but Francesc asks the price. **50,000** gold pieces. We have about 8,000 in cash, maybe 10,000 all-in.

As we walk around, Francesc - perception 19 - notices the Thayan Embassy we'd heard about. We see people in huge robes, very ornate, tattoo styles that we now recognise. Many are clearly undead. So, **we know for sure that Wilim was a Red Wizard of Thay**.

(End of part 44)
