# RIPA: Part 34
## Session 34 (2024-03-19)
### Day 33, afternoon, Cairngorm Cavern

We've defeated some demon cult Drow and made an ally of a Stone Giant and four accompanying Duergar. We are now to be taken to see a more important giant to talk more about the stone tablets, two of which have now been transcribed onto parchment we hold. There turn out to be seven in all, which are parts of a poem identifying the seven locations, on seven planes, of fractured parts of a rod that were used to banish the Demon Queen to a prison dimension many centuries earlier (specifically, if you know how to read it, the poem tells you where the gateways to these dimensions are; and further, specific runes must be inscribed on the rod sections before attempting reassembly, else they will repel each other and teleport to new, unknown planes, becoming lost forever).

We don't know if the demon cult want the tablets to avoid the rod being found because it could be used to banish someone again, or to try and assemble it to try and reverse its effects and bring *back* the Demon Queen, or something else.

We are also sort-of-on on two simultaneous, conflicting missions.

* Themberchauld is at the end of his reign as Wyrmsmith, and is becoming paranoid about the Keepers Of The Flame. He has tasked us with finding out "what they're up to".

* In turn, the Keepers have tasked us with finding an egg stolen by the Greyhands of a dragon that would replace Themberchauld. Themberchauld is right to be paranoid - an outgoing dragon is slowly poisoned until weak enough to be killed outright! There is a possible lead to this in West Cleft, not far from the entrance to the Cairngorm Caverns, but in a wild outer part of the city of Gracklstugh populated by a great many derro.

Meanwhile, there is of course the ongoing wider issue of the lich Valindra Shadowmantle who wants to find her phylactory, and the extraplanar creatures travelling through the Underdark to meet her. We're working on a hope right now that the path we're currently on will converge with all of that in due course, since the demon worshippers, the "gateway" (or rather, the now very thin barrier between the demon plane and ours) and the extraplanar incursions all seem related; and we have been told of connections, albeit not necessarily as first-hand knowledge, between Valindra Shadowmantle and the demon cult.

We will be taken to **Hgraam** by our new Stone Giant ally.

While some of us are talking to the giant, others are checking the Drow bodies. We find a few things:

* **Two good-sized emeralds worth 1000gp each**.
* **Three small diamonds, worth about 300gp each**. Those would be useful for Revivify.
* We find a magic item - a dagger of venom.
* A spider silk / leather armour, quite beautiful, though it would make Francesc look quite Drow-like. It's lighter than  the things Francesc wears right now and Thorin is eyeing up her studded leather as a hand-me-down! Drow elven chain, with very particular magical properties.

The armour would be great for Arturo; the dagger good for Francesc; Thorin bags the emeralds, while he and Francesc share the diamonds for use with Revivify spells (noting - as an aside - that we know we'll go to L9 once we've met with the giants).

Francesc goes digging around with Guidance from Thorin. She finds a pin on the ground from near where the priestess exploded (!). She can sense that its magical; so Penny checks - arcana 1-1 -> 0. It's a pin. Francesc meanwhile notices there seems to be an impression of the priestess on the ground, despite that being impossible. Arturo - arcana 24; ah! After-images of an illusion. **This is a masque charm**. He explains and Penny says, "Oh! So the priestess was disguised then; she wasn't who she appeared to be."

So whoever or whatever this was, it wasn't a Drow. And that does explain the explosion, perhaps! Francesc starts investigating the remains - investigation 20. There is a smell of a faint hint of brimstone from the charred remains. Things that should be pieces of flesh are actually some kind of rock; whatever this was, it seems like it was some kind of demonic essence infused into a rock effigy. **That means that whatever we "killed" when the priestess went down is probably not dead, more just banished**. Francesc explains all this to the giant, showing the bits and pieces.

The giant's expression clouds over. "But stone is sacred! This is a bad thing... Possessing stone... Poisoning it. Please come."

We are led deeper into the caverns, towards a small community of Stone Giants. In a particularly large cavern, sat cross-legged at the back, is a very old giant, wearing "real" clothing - not just scraps. When he raises his head, we see his eyes look like cloudy opals; possibly blind. This must be the oldest giant we've ever seen.

They "look" in our direction and speak. "Ah..." - a long pause. "You *have* come. I was wondering if this would come to be. What, or how have you chosen; who have you allied with?" - and he speaks in Common.

Arturo explains that Penny is allied with Helm's Hall, against general incursions; we're sort-of on the side of the Lidded Eye deep gnomes too; and we did agree with the Mummy Lord / seer to retrieve the "crystal" / black scrying shard that Valindra Shadowmantle holds. "Oh, and *you*, of course!" adds Arturo.

Hgraam chuckles. "A cautious answer, but one that reveals nothing. Perhaps you haven't actually decided? THat's also not a bad thing but you'll have to pick a side pretty soon! As for me - funny you should say that. I've also been trying to delay picking a side."

**He thinks the demon invasion is a distraction.** So - by who, and why? "My visions are clouded around this question. As you have already hinted, I know you're aware that there are many factions converging. We *could* try and understand what they are trying to achieve. We *could* try and decipher their motivations. But consider this - what if *none* of them are actually truly aware of the reasons why they're doing this? They may think they know, they may think they have chosen; but what if none of them have actually been given a choice because there's something else going on that requires all of these separate actors to do what they're doing."

He continues. "I've sensed beyond my reach, beyond the veil of dreams, that there is possibly a force behind all of this chaos and conflict and I don't know *why*."

Penny shrugs and says "It seems reasonable; when we talk to any of these factions and ask about things we do know, they often don't; they all know different bits of the picture, rather like us, but nobody knows how it all fits together. So yes, they *can't* know exactly why they're doing what they're doing."

"They're reacting" says Hgraam. "You apply pressure, predicting how people will react. But how does it all fit together?"

Arturo suggests a proxy war between the Mummy Lord and Shadowmantle. As for the wand we're trying to recover... we're interrupted when we mention that, and explain about the tablets (as best we understand it) and that maybe someone is trying to *assemble* it for some reason. Hgraam says he hadn't considered that, because - not that it isn't powerful - he doesn't really know all it can do, so can't say what anyone might be using it for.

We know people want the tablets; but seem to want the *tablets themselves* and not just a copy. Hgraam says that this suggests it's less about the information on the tablets, and more about keeping the information away from others. So take them, use or copy them, destroy them? Or perhaps they really do need to be physically present - something might happen when all are together. We do know that it's **useless without all seven**. Only all seven together have a meaningful poem that gives the clues about the seven gateway locations. But even then, mere transcription seems insufficient; what about the runes that should be inscribed on wand segments, for example?

Thorin considers teleporting to where the tablets came from! But there's the "last six months" problems. Oh.

Hgraam says, "Well, don't get me wrong - I don't think it's actually bad or wrong to want to affect the world around you as a reaction to things that are happening."

Thorin asks what side Hgraam would take. Insight 26 into the answer. "I have been thinking about that question a lot. I've been hoping that a sign would point the way..." - the insight says Hgraam was hoping that we'd picked something and he could quiz us about our reasons. Interesting; he has some self-doubt despite his age. (He's hundreds of years old).

Penny says, "We don't have a side. And we shouldn't. None of them know why they're doing anything. Neither do we. So we can ally with those who are aligned with our interests at a given time, to help improve the state of our knowledge, or help address the demon incursion." "We'll be done when there are no more demons or undead armies!" adds Arturo. Penny adv. persuasion, only 19, but Thorin's added Guidance, +4 -> 23.

Hgraam sits back and calls to an assistant with hand signals. An acolyte comes over and unwraps a silk bundle. A clear, large piece of quartz is produced and handed to Hgraam. He holds it up, looking at it - strangely - off to one side slightly. It thrums with energy and glows a little. He looks down to us and says:

"I don't know if there is trickery afoot - if you are just very clever. There were a dozen different answers you could have given me and only one that I was looking for. However it is - you have done so, against my deepest fears and doubt. You have given me the answer I was looking for." He puts down the quartz, which stops glowing.

"You have our secrets; secret, because outwardly, legally, we are bound to the Duergar king - the Stone King. This decision was made by my ancestors and we must obey it. But something that people don't know is that we've kept **Graven Hollow** active this whole time. It is a **library of the past, the present and the future**. It is also where..." - and he projects a thought; he's saying something verbally, but we in our heads all hear something else - "...it is also where **the last of the seven tablets is still hidden. It was never moved from Graven Hollow**. You may find yourself needing to go there at some point. Probably not right away, but you will know when you need information that no mortal library possesses! We have that information there. It contains the echoes of everyone, every great sage and seeker; thinker; philosopher; writer; that has reached the pinnale of their craft and ever visited the library in the past *and the future*."

He hands us the 4ft long crystal! This is the **Stone Speaker Crystal**. Its true powers are revealed within the walls of Graven Hollow. It is carved from the stone from which the library itself is carved. The acolyte will tell us the route, including how to get there from the surface.

"Will you stay for the day? We have much to discuss; many notes to share." For one thing, he's never been inside the All Seeing Eye temple and doesn't know directly what the *other* VS has been up to. He also knows where the Star Forge is! We definitely are happy to swap notes!

* The day passes. A combination of rolls.
* History is key, insight too, and a persuasion or deception roll.

Penny and Arturo dicsuss privately if we should hold anything back. We don't think so. The Mummy Lord stuff is the most sensitive but also the most interesting, potentially! So Francesc helps Arturo with that.

* History 22 (Francesc)
* Insight 21 (Thorin)
* Persuasion (with Bend Luck) 22

No resounding successes, sadly; but no failures. Hgraam shares things he knows that we don't. Most of that is focused on Valindra Shadowmantle. This is his insight; Thorin thinks it is reliable.

* He believes on the surface that there are a number of competing people who are probably all driving towards the same goal in the immediate vicinity.

* The Drow are playing against each other. Loth is known for this - playing off families - a 'survival of the fittest' approach. She takes delight in seeing them destroy each other. She's in the abyss and consorts with demons all the time, so it seems unlikely that the "official" Drow position with Loth is any different from the "demon" position.

* All evidence seems to point to the main emergence of initial Demigorgon at Menzoberranzan, the Drow capital city. Whatever ritual they did initially to weaken barriers and get one through, probably happened there.

* His theory, then, is that Loth is behind *both sides* of the Drow behaviour.

* The Drow *believe* they are opposed to Valindra Shadowmantle, but whoever is orchestrating all this - Shadowmantle or someone above her - probably has them all really going in the same direction overall.

* Given that we did reveal we have her phylactory - which is why we asked about the Star Forge - he says that she's withdrawn from direct involvement in affairs in the last few weeks; that's explained now, says Hgraam. She doesn't want to risk anything happening to her while someone *else* controls her phylactory. She can't take as many risks.

* Hgraam is sure she's evil but, oddly, she does good too; whatever her plan is, which he doesn't fully understand, could do with more information and visibility!

He suggests that we have accepted and not yet completed *many* missions! He won't give us another. But in terms of priority, we should probably try and understand what Shadowmantle is doing. We have some idea of Vallin's side, but not Valindra. And he asks an interesting question; why do we want to destroy the phylactory? To kill the lich. But why do we want to kill the lich?

On the stone tablets; we can collect them and the giants will accumulate them in the library. We think that's the best plan. But Arturo says we should keep one back, just in case the library gets compromised. We also do have our transcriptions.

The day eventually draws to a close.

### LEVEL 9



## Day 34, Cairngorm Caverns

Much debate about what comes next! We consider the most recent; the dragon egg and Themberchauld. Thorin insight 18 - hand over the egg *and* tell the dragon. Eventually Penny times out, says, "...fucks sake", turns around and starts walking towards the cavern exit with an intent to reach West Cleft.

We reach there - Penny some distance in front, Thorin, Arturo, Francesc. We reach the edge; worn and crumbling stone stairs down the inside of the rift between here and the main city. We descend. Hovels stacked upon hovels! Francesc persuasion 25; most are Derro, but there are a few regular Duergar and even a few non-dwarves. Teeming. An air of madness and squalor; destitution; illness; Penny ends up shedding a few healing points to five people. Reactions range from grateful, apologetic, joyous, fearful... to violent! Not too surprising.

Penny is given the pin by Arturo, disguises herself a Duergar and starts making enquiries in Undercommon. Not Derro. ADV deception, pretending to be a merchant looking for Greyhands; 18. We're given the runaround a bit, not too surprising; 45 minutes of being dragged around from one hovel to the next! **But** - eventually - we are at something that passes for a kind of market. It's an alleyway with vendors - of sorts - but they only sell bits of broken mushrooms or flame grilled rats! We can apparently find someone here called **Droki**, a Derro, associated with the Greyhands.

Penny buys a rat - 1cp, SOH 14, doesn't spill gold and silver all over! - and enquires about Droki. She bribes for information with another copper. But first, the family recipe; she's handed the rat. It's not bad! CON save, dirty 20. It might not have been the healthiest rat in the world but it goes down OK. It's very charred! The vendor is delighted. "Good rat, good char on it!" "Interesting... I like that you actually *ate* that rat!" - the Derro trader is not quite as crazy as she thought; there's a lucidity. "Do you need a glass of water?" "Nah, really, I'm quite happy with rats!" "Droki's behind that curtain over there..." - he pulls on a string connected to rattling metal cans. After a delay it rattles back. "You can go in!"

(Thorin insight 21 - he's not crazy at all; the whole thing is an act. Also, nobody else is buying or eating rats!)

We head behind the curtain, Penny first. There's a dark corridor there, narrow. Penny's blindsight helps. There are rooms off to each side with entire families crammed in! Someone each time we walk past looks up and points further in; Penny keeps going. One, two, three, four doors passed. At the fifth, there's a room with a female dwarf with a baby and child; she points to the door behind us. Penny turns and politely knocks. She notices the string leading in above the door, that must go back to the rat vendor. The door opens. We go in.

Sat on a mat on the ground, next to what looks like a large wooden spool being used as a table, is a female Derro in fancy clothing and a small jar with a few fireflies giving very dim light. She has braided hair that's been coloured in pinks and purples. As we walk in, Francesc ADV history; 17. Her hands are folded on her lap; she's waiting for Penny to speak. Penny comes in fully and waits for everyone else to come in. When Francesc walks in, she recognises her at the same time as she calls out - "Ha! It's you! I knew I'd see you again!" - it's the person Francesc spoke to when on watch above the 'hotel'.

She says, "I don't have it!"; "Who does?"; "You're not going to like this! The way we work is that only one person is given a secret, so that way, it's less likely to be divulged. I'll give you one guess about who held the secret!" "The person the guards already captured and killed?" "Yes! The old leader. However, this of interest to quite a few people. As far as we're concerned, the Greyhands would like nothing better than for it to be lost forever! That's why he didn't say anything. We don't fear the dragon down here... But the Council Of Savants has been trying to find it and have been pressuring us; they make a good case; the lives of many _others_ are at stake if the dragon does totally lose it. We figured we could apply leverage to the Keepers Of The Flame though we never intended to keep to any bargains struck, of course! But we didn't get the chance."

She asks what we'd do with the egg. Would it be possible for them to have mutual goals? What *are* their goals? "Proper recognition of our rights as Derro and for us to be allowed back into the city again." "When did they throw you out?" "Well it's not entirely their fault... We did stage a rebellion! And we were close to overthrowing the king. This was a *long* time ago. But the king pushed back the tide by allying with the Stone Giants. They kicked us out, denying us recognition as people; Derro were slaves of the Duergar for several hundred years. We rose up and once again almost killed the king! This time our demands were to be freed as slaves. Our negotiators didn't manage to get equal rights as citizens, though. *Except* for the Council Of Savants, who are ostensibly our representatives, who live in luxury in the city as our elected representatives."

* Find the egg
* Use it as leverage to get the Keepers & Council to present a united front to the King
* Get the Derro legally enshrined as citizens
* Collect reward from the Keepers - maybe
* Warn Themberchauld
* Collect reward - maybe
* Get to the stone giant temple / shrine that Thorin wants to visit via Helm after the guy we rescued from the spider webs across the chasm told us about it
* Portal home (the Helm is 3 charges back now).

We do this as rolls. We're presented with what evidence Droki has - investigation 25. Great! Next, Survival to find out how to get to the locations. Survival rolls are good enough to tell us the way.

* A maddening array of tunnels created by a giant purple worm
* A location in the city called the "Hall Of Sacred Spells", carved into a stalagmite in the northern area

We all agree that there's a twisted logic to the Hall, which is under where the Council of Savants live; that sounds about right! So we go that way. Our tokens get us back into the city. We reach the giant stalagmite; a ground entrance is a kind of courtyard, complete with a carved fountain, little potted bioluminescent plants; carpets, wood carvings, moss sculptures - opulence. Each of the Council seem to have harem-like apartments with intense decorations.

Arturo deception 25; he gets us in easily. Now we need to be stealthy! Group-stealth; Penny *disadvantage* rolls **two natural 20s** for 19! Madness. With PWAT, it's +10 for everyone. We take a while investigating and looking; between Thorin and Francesc, we *find the egg* (and we're not discovered - D20 luck roll by DM, threshold determined by perception vs longer-taking investigation choice; we went with investigation). It's in a treasure room, disguised; these Savants *knew* about it the whole time. Corrupt.

We take the egg, leaving behind its case and cover. Arturo leaves a potato as thieve's calling card! It *just* fits into the bag of holding.

Now we need to coerce the Keepers to kick the Council into touch and get a united from to the King. We stride into the temple; a booming voice immediately; the first person that saw us was the Dragon. "BRING ME MY FAVOURITE NEW FRIENDS!" demands Themberchauld. Sigh.

Arturo is forced to try and convince the dragon straight-up that the people here are just hiding that basically they're not competent! The profits are sliding; the kingdom decaying; the only reason they've any wealth is the dragon himself. He should find somewhere new where he's not being held back! Deception: It requires a few tricks like Magical Guidance, Thorin's help and more, but the outcome scrapes up to dirty 20. The dragon's insight is lower (only 14) - he's convinced. "Yes!" he says - "I must search for a new lair, every day, without them knowing. My servants will secretly convey my gold to the new lair!" "Genius!" says Arturo. "We are happy to have served you."

The dragon digs around in his pile of gold; then instead, pulls off a very large dragon scale from his own body. He gives it to Arturo as a token of appreciation. "It will keep you safer until I have need of you again!" says Theberchauld (we can have it fashioned into a shield or armour for fire resistance). We are permitted to leave "until I call for you again!" so with withdraw.

Outside we're immediately accosted by Gartokkar the Keeper, who wants to know what's going on. We end up down in his secret tunnels again and lay things out - the corrupt Council, legal rights, all of it. A meeting can't be called with the King except by the Stone Seeker - oh, well, we know that giant well!

It's a long day. We join the dots with the various people and end up in front of a king, grumpy at being called to a meeting late in the day - Deep King **Horgar Steelshadow The Fifth** - sits upon a throne made of mithril. His enormous crown would add a few feet to his height, and his beard covers his entire front down to the ground when he's sat. Lots of politicians and people who are needed for such meetings and legalities; guards too, of course, in a large number; even the Council Of Savants are here.

Penny has to speak for the group, as she's charismatic and can speak Undercommon. Arturo helps with ideas. Persuasion 26 (with Guidance) on the Derro being made citizens. The Council of Savants do *not* support our petition! They argue that the Derro are "easily misunderstood" and Duergar communities with strict laws are not places where Derro can thrive. Their counter-persuasion is low though; the Keepers weigh in, surprising everyone, supporting the motion (because *they* know about the egg). They claim the God Of The Forge has spoken to them through the Wyrmsmith and "all of (the God's) children should be treated as equals".

The law - any Derro *currently* living in the area is granted citizenship. There is a provision - Penny double-checks! - that they can't rise up and start being revolutionaries again! The Council of Savants storms out of the room, very angry.

In due course, we make a show of "going to find the egg" and returning it to Gartokkar, since he's kept up his part of the bargain. And being lawful, Gartokkar keeps to his word - he produces a **huge chest of 10,000gp**, much to Thorin's glee! We don't tell him about our persuasion with Themberchauld - if the dragon leaves safely, the Keepers get what they want; but if the Keepers poison the dragon anyway, well, that's one less Red Dragon in the world. We also spend time to get back out and tell Droki about the Savants' skulduggery.

Finally, it's over. It's late in the day, but Thorin is keen on finding the treasure catacombs... They could be very big, very time-consuming and very dangerous. That said, we figure it's not going anywhere. And it's a giant's tomb, so if Stone Giants we could be waking up creatures that aren't even dead *and* annoying our allies.

We vote 3-to-1 that we should leave this for another day. Daylight would be nice. Arturo packs away his Drow armour so it's not going to get destroyed by the sun and think, well, maybe *home* for a day or two! We can always get back here via the Helm since we have a tankard.

* How do we find out more about Valindra Shadowmantle? She was digging up stone tablets via deforestation.
* What we're doing now is to fight her. So we want to do more of that.
* We can't risk the scrying orb; we were warned against it.
* Directly talking to her might help... Or perhaps ask someone at Candlekeep nicely to use Sending?

Arturo suggests something old school; spying. We have the amulets and PWAT; we could try and spend time observing her operations in person, to see what's going on. Certainly, if she *has* found any tablets, we want them.

She has a house in Neverwinter; we also saw her at a villa in Baldur's Gate; but she probably has other places, too. If she has any tablets, even if we find one, we might not know if we've found *all* of them. And what about the deforestation? Did they find anything?

In the end we decide: Back to the woods. The tavern at the front lines (if it still exists).

We find a back-alley, since using the Helm directly out of the middle of the city would be bad form! The rift opens; we walk through; and just like that, the Neverwinter Woods Tavern, right by the bar. Francesc and Penny need DEX saves. Penny, 10; Francesc, 29. A mug is flying in Francesc's direction; she ducks; it hits Penny!

"Ouch! What was that for?!"

We realise that the tavern is - ummm, lively. A "friendly" brawl? Penny tries to grab someone - ATHL 11, nope!

It's very lively... Oh. Night sky. Night time, so we're probably roughly aligned with an expected time of day. Eloise is standing on a table singing; Thorin also recognises the barkeep. Sat outside on a balcony are a few more that they recognise from our first trip here. (Basically, the cast of Honour Amongst Thieves).

Thorin wanders up to Eloise to ask what's going on, along with Francesc and Arturo. "We've succeeded!" she says. "It's great! Come on!" "Succeeded with what?" "They left!"

Simultaneously, Penny has made a beeline to the balcony. And she gets the story - the whole thing; Thay, Lord Neverember is back, the works.

Meanwhile, Eloise is being quizzed by the others. We've been away 7ish days; Eloise says that about 3 days ago, there was a Stop Work order. A truce of sorts. The workers all left; they'd run out of money, didn't get paid (we knew about that!) and another group *were* sent to log in another area but got pulled back the very next day. The New Neverwinter initiative had decided they were finished with the Heart Of The Forest. Too expensive, etc. etc.; many excuses; they left, and that's all everyone cares about.

(Penny hears another version of the story but it amounts to the same thing. The forest seems to be safe. She's conflicted; it seems a very good thing, but she's somehow disappointed that she wasn't part of it. In any event, she congratulates this strange group of people, sincerely, and thanks them for saving the forest and - it seems - for quite possibly saving Neverwinter itself. For some reason, it never crosses her mind that they might be lying. It just seems - right. The story just seems solid; believable.)

We rejoin as a group and allow ourselves, for the first time in a while, to cut back and enjoy the moment. We all care about the forest. Inspiration all round. We are quite happy to spend the night here! Penny ends up in a drinking competition with the strange barbarian lady. The rest of the party are being sensible and going to find somewhere to camp; but Penny ends up face-down in a pool of beer on the tavern floor, sleeping soundly, and has rarely been happier.



## Day 35, at the old Front in the forest

Everyone *else* wakes up refreshed. Penny is hungover - amounts to a point of exhaustion, but it'll hopefully only take a few hours to get past it. In the end she uses a bit of healing to bring herself back up (but with no full Long Rest, she has 35 of her usual 45 left over today).

The key takeaway is that it was the *New Neverwinter Initiative* that decided to stop looking for the tablets; that's Valindra. So, our plan to go to Neverwinter is unchanged - Thorin is keen to check on his armour *again*, despite it being about 7 days sooner, still, than we were told for when it would be ready!

We are once again unwelcome surprise visitors to Southside Ales!

Thorin wants to make a beeline for the armourer. So we do. Hela says, "it's *NOT READY!*", unsurprisingly! "I *told* you how long it takes!" Thorin is asking if there's *anyway* it can be any earlier. "Four days now is the earliest I can possibly do, and that won't be polished. That'll take at least another day. But I'll want paying for the rest of the armour now" - so Thorin pays the rest. He also asks while there about the red dragon scale. Hela can turn it into a shield easily enough (but not until Thorin's armour is done!) - it'll only take 3 days though, so she could do *that* and *then* finish the armour.

In the end we decide armour first, shield next. We might even be able to get the shield made by our own armourer, back at the keep. Hela *is* interested in the Hellfire Scimitar! We dont't have a use for it. "And there's *always* a market for that kind of thing" she says. Arturo persuasion is nuts - **30**. Hela says she's got buyers already! 800gp is offered. Done! That's much more than the normal price, but apparently, it's in great demand - she'll overcharge someone in turn.

Hela recommends temples for buying scrolls; if we can't get Candlekeep to help, we could use a Scroll Of Sending potentially, to talk to Valindra. Francesc reminds us that we have a Scroll Of Summon Demon to sell, too; OK, so, perhaps *not* a temple!

(Meanwhile, Thorin does a bit of shopping to get various spell components).

At a temple, we're told that they would *definitely* not want to buy the scroll, even to stop it falling into the hands of others. But a general Arcanist (a wizard) would surely be interested. Not divine. But we could just keep it - it's potentially quite dangerous. OK, fair enough. 150fp for a Scroll Of Sending. Between Penny and Francesc we don't *quite* have enough money; persuasion 25 to try and bring down the cost. They'll happily give it us for *free* if we'd help at the temple - "we could certainly use someone to help out here with the visitors, supplicants and so-on..."

(Penny is tempted)

"...for a week!"

(Penny is not tempted).

Thorin eventually catches up with us. We pay the money. Penny says it's not the first time she's had that question. Once - if we survive it - our trials are over, she vows that she will come back and help out at some of the temples in Neverwinter. She thinks it would be good for her.

Now we start digging. We're looking for info on New Neverwinter Initiative. We present ourselves as mercenaries/adventurers for hire - since they'd had some trouble! - to help them find, well, whatever they wanted to find. Penny, Deception 18. The "Neverwinter Woods job" now called off leads to a new focus - the road between Neverwinter and Waterdeep along the Mere of Dead Men. Lord Neverember was always obsessed with that. Thorin insight 27; this is a resumption of old activity previously put on hold. It's not likely to be anything of interest to us (and the Mere is a *very* dangerous place to be).

We have to push harder! Dropping hints - Valindra Shadowmantle; the names on signed work orders we saw at the camp; that kind of thing. Arturo tries. Deception is low; metamagic reroll, lower; blows Inspiration; a *bit* better - with Guidance, too, dirty 20. He discovers that the Captain from that job is still around and giving orders, on a reconstruction job in town now - the arena was damaged in the recent "troubles". We hear that Valindra Shadowmantle *withdrew* from the Council of New Neverwinter Initiative a few days ago and the last they heard, she was leaving town for a while. Business elsewhere. The people we talk to don't know, but her house staff might be - he knows where the house is, at least.

Thorin gets the distinct sense that things in Neverwinter are over - she's done with that and going somewhere else now.

We get to her address; a 3-storey stone villa, beautiful, amongst other beautiful old buildings that seem to have been untouched by the not-too-long-ago eruption. There is a full, mature garden with old trees and a high stone wall, along with a wrought iron gate - closed. We start off with the open approach, going up to the front gate. Thorin perception 24; it's locked but, interestingly, locked with a heavy chain and padlock, with the padlock on the outside. It feels like the place is abandoned.

We elect to poke around! Stealth with PWAT:

* Penny 20
* Francesc 28
* Thorin 29
* Arturo 18

There's an alleyway that we might be able to get over; Francesc's slugs lift her up and she lowers a rope. It's not that high a wall anyway; it's easy enough for us to get up here. We saw her under a tree when scrying once - it certainly wasn't here! The garden is entirely unfamiliar. Penny casts Detect Magic. She senses a fair bit; Abjuration on the doors and Divination in parts of the garden; a very powerful presence of Necromantic magic from the ground. Windows on the second floor are not covered by the Abjuration though. Divination shouldn't be an issue due to our amulets. The necromancy is in veins and tendrils weaving through the grounds of the villa. Penny decides to follow it a bit. It's rather like tree roots - and indeed they converge on an old-looking stone pine, that grows in the garden. The tree seems normal *except* it pulses with necromancy. Thorin considers Speak With Plants; well, with caution, why not...

...so Thorin asks if it knows what the deal is with the magic running through the tree! Penny helps by describing the magic so Thorin's question can be more directed; ADV persuasion 19. It responds that the magic is what sustains it. It asks Thorin for some help; it has not been fed in a while. What does it need to be fed? It loves, primarily, fresh blood, but can make do with buried, freshly killed animals and people at its base. It has been a few days since fed. Thorin is keen to help simply because it might then give us more information. It does seem to be at least 100 years old, so might know *something*. Thorin counters by enquiring what it was fed before - "The blood of servants!" it says - 'the master' goes into the house, sometimes; the tree knows nothing more than that. "You clearly have questions; I can find you answers" tries the tree; Thorin goes for that, to Penny's surprise. He feeds it some of his own blood! It's the equivalent of about 10hp.

The tree livens up immediately, looking less tired and withered straight. "As promised I will get your questions answered" it says, then goes silent for a while... Then Thorin feels a shudder in the tree, and Penny, with Detect Magic still active, sees a pulse of magic emanate out from the tree's base, headed towards the house. Penny perception 16, Thorin 14, Francesc 24; out of the corner of Francesc's eye she sees a flicker of movement. **Two ghosts** seem to phase through the house!

"I have fetched people to answer your questions for you!" says the tree.
