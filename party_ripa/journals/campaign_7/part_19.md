# RIPA: Part 19
## Session 19 (2023-10-03)
### Day 16, a little after 6pm

A ghost!

Ebda is lying on the ground, back to his senses but terrified. His daughter Gailby has run off into the dark and, somewhere in the now-sealed-off Firefly Library.

Penny runs between bookcases, in the direction the spirit went; she's just in time to see it vanishing into a wall - solid earth behind, so far as Penny knows. She shouts to ask if anyone saw where Gailby went; Thorin saw her run down stairs just near Penny, so Penny runs in pursuit (she can't fight what she can't see, but she can try to look after the kid).

Arturo stays close to Ebda. Arcana, 17; Ebda lost his mind for a while! Hopefully it's not permanent but he isn't in control of himself at the moment. It seems to be some kind of magical possession, but is wearing off. Artuto shouts that out to let us all know; Thorin steps over Ebda to cast Barkskin on Arturo - but starts singing since that requires concentration; Ebda starts singing too, but *stops convulsing*. Arturo and Francesc overhear this; con saves; Arturo (16) resists the effect; Francesc (nat 20!) very much so. Penny's out of earshot, a little way down the stairs.

Penny is chasing after Gailby. She runs into her room, but Crinkle comes out; says "Whats going on here?" then comes into the room and starts trying to console Gailby, singing a lullaby (not "the" song!). Penny quickly fills in Crinkle and asks if he can look after her - he pulls two daggers! K'tulah appears and another summary; she says she'll help with looking for the ghost. Penny runs back upstairs - into the sound of singing, unwittingly; con save: nat 1+2 -> 3, a surprised Penny starts singing.

Arturo meanwhile has cast Sleep to stop Ebda from singing. It works and he stops, so Penny joins Thorin in unwilling song, but Ebda, Francesc and Arturo are not affected. We *all* have to try again. Arturo (23), Penny (21) and Francesc (11 - just, DC 10) - we stop singing, but Thorin is concentrating on his Barkskin spell.

The lights flicker in a strange concentric wave from the middle of the room and the temperature drops more. K'tulah comes up and avoids singing too. Penny runs around the bookcases to the centre section. Thorin follows. Penny perception 19; she hears distinct singing coming from *upstairs*, where we were before. It's towards the upstairs area and roughly in the direction of the bookcase with the wall section that we pulled out.

Penny and Thorin run up to investigate. On arrival, Penny gets a sense of horror - the scull is singing! Actual words!

* "See a mother scything wheat. Forgotten husband sleeping near. With one swing she took his feet. With another took his ear."
* "Does the shadow have a name? Shem Shein! Shem Shein! Causes grief avoids the blame. *Shem Shine! Shem Shein!*

There's only Penny here not singing... The scull and Thorin are too. This outnumbering seems to make things worse... Two shadows (not invisible, we both see them) lift up out of the ground. The song continues.

Penny draws her sword again - "I'm going to destroy the scull!" but Thorin says "What if it's giving us info?" and so she shouts "Fine, you listen to it then!" and changes target to the nearest shadow. Thorin roars a battlecry, hoping the others below will hear. Initiative!

* Penny 15
* Thorin 10
* Francesc 7
* Arturo 6

The shadow *behind* the nearest surprises Penny by shifting through the bookcase to get behind Thorin and attack. He has Darkvision so there's no disadvantage. 22 to hit. 10 psychic damage! He reacts with Gift Of The Gem Dragon; the spirit is pushed back 10ft and takes 2d8->6 force damage. It seems to try and hide behind a bookcase after that, but Thorin, perception 14, sees its hand around the corner.

Penny swings and hits, with a divine smite; 8+14->28 -> 36 damage. It's not down yet. She swings again but, very frustratingly, she misses and it attacks in return. It crits; a whopping 15 psychic damage (con save 14, doesn't sing). For this rare time, Penny also tries her Gem Dragon - and it works - what's more, 2d8->8+8->16 max damage. But it's STILL up, and runs around a corner too. Perception check only 8; can't see it.

Thorin hears:

* "See a dog that knows how to heal."
* "Never heeds plea nor commmand."
* "Mother gave it a tasty meal."
* "Dog chose instead to eat her hand."
* "Does the shadow have a name? Shem Shein! Shem Shein! Causes grief avoids the blame. *Shem Shine! Shem Shein!*

...and is now singing along. He thinks he has no choice; he drops his Barkskin spell (*that* will get Arturo's attention!) and uses L3 Summon Beast to call a small land beast spirit next to the Shadow that he can see. He gives it orders to attack and keep searching if they hide, then as his bonus action, shapes into a bear - but is constrained by the closely packed shelves. At least his singing stops... ...but the spirits are still around. He pushes his way around the corner; perception 23. He sees the spirit Penny injured.

Francesc is running for the stairs as quickly as she can go. She runs into the centre section, dashes to power a jump and leaps for the centre balcony - DC 20 athl - rolls exactly 15+5! Makes it all the way up to the upper floor in a single go. It's all leaping, forwards rolls and arrow drawn at the ready.

Arturo runs and just makes it into the shelving gap that lets him see the centre sculpture and railings; that's enough to Misty Step - so he also appears up at the top very quickly. He throws Firebolt, hitting the spectre for 16 damage, but it only seems to be affected a little (takes 8). The flame is absorbed, almost extinguished (but at least that means it doesn't hit the books on the shelves behind!). That spectre now acts. It is fairly surrounded - Arturo, Francesc and the the spirit animal. It tries to escape through the bookcase giving the animal spirit an opportunity attack - but it can't quite manage to connect.

The spirit passes through, into the corridor with the bear which also has a swipe (but at disadvantage thanks to the cramped space); but it can't connect either. The spirit then carries on and tries to attack Penny but the armour does its job and the attack deflects. She attacks right back. A hit! With L3 divine smite, and it's a 20*2+9->49; it evaporates. Then she runs around, sees the other one, hits but it's only glancing (6) so smites again - all L1 gone now - and it's 7+8+8->23, so a highly unnecessary 52 damage. The spirit fails.

Thorin hears the song continuing:

* "See a son doing his chores"
* "Washing clothes for folks in town"
* "Fell into the river's roar"
* "Sank to the bottom and drowned"
* "Does the shadow have a name? Shem Shein! Shem Shein! Causes grief avoids the blame. *Shem Shine! Shem Shein!*

Then it starts a kind of half-word, skips almost and starts the first verse again. It's more of a sound, not really intelligible. Seems to start with an "S". That's about all he can tell. K'tulah then shouts "Come down here! He's coming to!" and Penny goes to grab the scull and throw it in the bag of holding. Arturo con 20, Francesc con 20, Penny scrapes in with 11. Makes it! (Thorin is still a bear).

Penny jumps down. Not a good idea in full plate. CRUNCH. Dex save, 12. Clumsy. She shouts up, "Don't do that!".

Eventually we're all downstairs again; Thorin drops his bear form to tell his beast spirit to follow. K'tulah has her scimitar out, aimed at Ebda. "What's the meaning of this?!" he asks. Thorin, Arturo arcana check; 5; Thorin arcana check 14; he can see that K'tulah is preparing a spell that looks like she'd entangle him in vines if he moved. She's a druid!

Penny asks "Why is he at sword-point?" and K'tulah answers "because he was convulsing and singing?" and Penny explains that is was possession. She tries to explain the same to Ebda. Persuasion 24. K'tulah drops the sword but says - "I'm sorry, I can't be down here... I need space..." - Penny tries to talk her down; she moves into the centre space; Arturo is sneakily casting Sleep on her! It doesn't work though. Sleight of hand check, 6. She turns around angrily - Arturo starts speaking fast! - "I'm sorry you were freaking out" etc. - persuasion 16. She calms down but she is suspicious.

Penny asks K'tulah and Ebda if they know what "Shem Shine" might mean; she suggests Varnya; we all head to the book binding room, where she was searching for info, and repeat the question. She has found an old journal.

Apparently there's more to the mystery. "The book was brought by a book seller who had a very long relationship with Candlekeep. Used to bring fantastic books, actively collecting. He'd arrived with a very interesting contraption - a mechanical book - hundreds of years ago, this was; it was very interesting to him. On his very first day in Candlekeep he was struck down with the singing malady. Others were affected and they even started to hurt each other. The book seller and four others were brought into the Firefly library, to see if it could be sorted out; but it went quiet after a short time; all five were found dead. One was crushed under a bookcase that had fallen and the book was below it."

The book was considered the issue and banned to a vault. That book had been kept hidden until Stonky's crew was moving things around and a box ended up back here, with relocated books, in the Firefly library. Varnya suspects the book is here. The book is called "**Shem Shein's Bedtime Rhyme**".

She thinks the scull in the wall, based on the journal, is from the head of the bookseller being buried in the wall (!). There's no explanation about why!

Arturo points out that four died. Two shadows, one spectre; are there two others. He asks if Varnya knows where the book might be - Ebda had everything arranged to "his system". Ebda tries to describe it. Thorin history 10, Penny history 13, Francesc 20, Arturo 12. Francesc gets a good idea based on his system that the book is probably upstairs - in the bookcase that "threw books at us". Nobody cleaned those up, so we head up once again and start searching. This amounts to a short rest (Penny uses Harness Divine Power to reclaim a L2 slot and via rest gets her innate Channel Divinity back, but her amulet is spent).

Penny is asked to roll a D6 -> 1. DM rolls D4; Arturo needs to make an intelligence saving throw. 12, on DC13... He takes 9 psychic damage and is frightened of - well, he swears he sees a manifestation of the shadow appear and take on the shape of his worst nightmare - a fey alligator, as they'd sometimes stalked him in the fey. We all see Arturo freaks out and runs randomly away from things we can't even see! Penny calls out but persuasion 12, no effect.

After a minute, Arturo recovers, but he's run downstairs and alone (though K'tulah is somewhere down there too).

Rest of us - wisdom saving; Francesc 22; she senses a malicious whispering voice in her head (and blocks it out). Thorin 26. Penny inevitably 12. 7 psychic damage. D4->1 - she attacks Francesc. Attacks, 17 - Francesc dodges. Penny recovers as her sword clanks into the ground. She realises she's just attacked Francesc. Penny looks started, and horrified, but also bursts out laughing - perhaps from relief, let's hope so! - "I have no idea why I did that!" "If it was *anybody* but you, you'd be getting shot in the face!"

Meanwhile, downstairs, Arturo perception: 6. He doesn't notice until K'tulah turns around and exclaims "What the...?!" - Gailby is standing, shaking, eyes wide, tears running down her face, holding a huge book - she drops it and is splattered in blood from the corner of the book. "He - I - I didn't mean to - he attacked me - I swear he attacked me - ..." - the book is huge, mechanical in nature with clockwork turning on its surface; the corner looks like it has been used to bludgeon someone.

Arturo's go-to: Sleep. 21hp worth; Gailby slumps to the ground. He shouts "THE BOOK IS HERE! And Crinkle is hurt!"

Penny jumps down - she risks it! - dex save 20-1, for once it's actually an elegant three-point landing. She runs past Arturo shouting "Stay with the book!", jumps over Gailby and runs for the stairs down to the rooms. Down there, the door to Gailby's room is open, Crinkle is there but - perception 19 - no daggers; he shouts "The daggers are missing!" and then kneels to heal him. It turns out Arturo ignored "stay with the" book and has run after Penny, arriving a moment later and starts searching for daggers, or evidence that Crinkle did attack Gailby, but on hearacing about the missing daggers runs back, checks Gailby; "daggers are missing, someone is armed!" he shouts.

Francesc jumps down (dex 14, it's inelegant but OK), sees the book, uses slug mage hand and puts the book into the bag of holding. Thorin dex 17 on the jump - elegant landing! Laughs at Francesc, shouts "ha! But don't touch the book!"

Penny meanwhile pushes some hands-on healing (5) for Crinkle. He's not dead, thankfully; he regains consciousness and says, "She came for me! She came for me, ma!" and we say, "It's OK, she's sleeping now; something to do with the book that she found. The clockwork book. Did you see it?" He says, "Oh..." - and insight 17. Guilt, responsibility. She says "Ah, you did see it. No time for worrying about that! Lets get upstairs and see what we can do to fix this."

Through a series of mimicry, he conveys that nobody respects Gailby or treats her well. The book looked so pretty. Makes singing sounds, dances; he thought nobody would miss it. Took the book, had been playing with it and gave it to Gailby. She's always been kind to her. When he gave her the book he got worried - she started to draw things - he points to them. They're dark. A woman chopping at a man with a scythe. A child drowing in a river. Penny had asked about those, but Gailby hadn't answered. Penny hugs Crinkle and says, "Kindness is never bad, even if the path can be difficult sometimes. Come with me." She heads upstairs, Crinkle in tow.

Upstairs, Penny explains what's going on. The book seems to be the problem, but we're still concentrating on not singing, so might not be the whole story.

It seems that this affliction is a form of curse. How can it be broken? Arturo suggests the risky strategy of finding the end of the verse. We don't have many other options.

Francesc uses her slug mage hand again to pull the book out. She passes it onto Penny in case she gets possessed or something, so Penny holds the bag open. With Francesc's consent, we tie her up so she can't be possessed and run. She can use mage hand to read the book. We keep at a distance where we can't see the pages.

"Shem Shein's Bedtime Rhyme" - the book opens. No pages. It opens out and is kind of a popup story. There's a music box, which plays the tune but it also starts to sing (Thorin puts hits fingers in his ears!) and as it does, the scenes in the pop-up change to reflect the song. There are *four* areas that pop up. The mother and scythe; a shadow pops up and grins. The dog. Another shadow as the dog eats the hand. The third is the boy. The shadow smiles and kicks the boy into the river. And the fourth... It tries to open but stalls, breaks and the story restarts.

Francesc closes the book. We figure we need to fix it! Penny insight 17; she's uncomfortable and not possessed so she unties Francesc.

If there's something physically broken, Arturo could cast Mending. But maybe it's a magical problem. Francesc investigates; the rest of us aren't proficient in such things. Dirty 20! Good stuff. Physical damage to the book has caused part of the mechanism to jam. It's not broken or torn so to speak, it's just blocked. It needs someone with great dexterity and fine tools. We ask Ebda, Varnya and K'tulah. K'tulah has good dexterity, but not quite the hands or tools. She could help though. Francesc has her thief's tools - with K'tulah's help, she tries to unjam the mechanism.

Francesc suggests casting Silence so that if the book runs and we can *see* the "pictures", we can decide if it looks like a good or bad ending, we can make a call on whether or not we then try to actually, say, destroy the book. She gets us all to stand back. Thorin's fey beast guards Gailby, with Ebda at her side too.

Francesc casts Silence centred on the book, then attempts repair with K'tulah's help. SOH check - nat 20!

In the silence, Francesc realises she no longer has the urge to sing - which helps, because Silence itself needs concentration. With great focus and concentration available in this calm and quiet, she quickly manipulates the tools and the gears pop into place. One last tug, and the book starts running. Penny moves forward to get a better look. In the silent zone she too loses the urge to sing. Penny beckons everyone else in. Arturo follows. Thorin keeps distance in case he needs spells; the book is fixed; he *does* still need to concentrate.

* The first scene is the same
* The second the same
* The third is as before
* And now the fourth - it has a young girl in a room with a millstone and the shadow appears, smiles and tries to attack her - but she flips a round, smiles, presses something that calls the millstone to fall; the shadow is trapped and dragged under the millstone, with a look of horror; it disappears

The book shudders, changes positions somehow, and there's a strange wave of energy that expands out. We all feel it. The book starts again; we're now the characters it shows. The dog is now a bear, the mother is Francesc, the boy is Arturo, the father is replaced by Penny. The last scene is the only one that doesn't change.

Penny backs away out of Silence - the need to sing is still there - and shouts, "We need to kill the final shadow!"

CHA saves all around. Penny 24. Arturo 23. Francesc 19. Thorin 14... **He is charmed!** He starts singing immediately. As he starts to sing, the rest of us all feel the room get cold gain. As it does, the firefly lamps start to go out above us, but Arturo's light spell stays up. Appearing next to Francesc is something that looks just like the shadow in the book. Black, grinning; K'tulah makes a kind of soundless (Silence spell) scream and flees. The exits are blocked by either the book and shadow, or the singing charmed Thorin; she is trapped in here! She runs wildly around the room, trying to figure out what to do.

Francesc perception 15. She sees the shadow easily enough. She slams the book closed with mage hand. When she does...

...initiative:

* Arturo 21
* Francesc 18
* Penny 12
* Thorin 10

Arturo acts first. He steps back out of Silence and tries Tasha's Mind Whip. DC16 int save, and even with +5, the presumed-Shim-Shine spirit fails. He deliberately triggers a wild magic surge too - D100->26 - a third eye appears on his forehead for a minute, giving him sight-related save advantages. That certainly helps! Shem Shein takes 14 psychic damage too.

Thanks to Arturo's mind whip, Shem Shine can't take reactions so Francesc, otherwise in melee range, is free to back away - so she can get to a distance and attack with her bow. Dirty 20 to hit; with various additions, but some low rolls, 15 damage. It looks really close to death! Second attack, with Sharpshooter and -5 for the +10 damage - still 22 to hit. Damage is 19 - that's more than enough! She shoots it in the face; the arrow pops out of the back of the head, as the shadows seem drawn to it and stick; all the shadows pull apart **but then rejoin** - Shem Shein still stands!

Arturo perception 20, is *very focused on the book*. It is going to attack Francesc as she's very closed to the book... But the Silence spell seems to frustrate it. It moves forward between the book and Francesc, but is still confused by Arturo's attack and isn't able to do anything more.

(Side note - we forgot that in the first pass; it got a nat 20 and dealt 39 psychic damage, taking Francesc down. Thank goodness for the Mind Whip success!)

Penny runs up to the book and attacks it. Hits, with L2 smite. Not undead tho; overall damage is 23. The mechanism is shattered. Shem Shein looks very angry at Penny. Penny walks forward, kicks the book out of the way (athl 19 -> 9 feet) - Arturo with his third eye (perception 17) notices Shem Shine has its attention drawn to the book - and tries to attack Shem Shine. It's a solid hit, the last L2 smite; 26 damage; Shem Shine is blown apart, but **still reforms** - so it's unconcerned about the book being destroyed, and its regenerative abilities aren't harmed.

D20->12, above 10, the beast spirit remembers its order to attack shadows. But Thorin is charmed, and closest to him is Arturo. He's thinking about Tidal Wave, but realises that would hit the book (and being charmed prevents him from doing that). Instead he turns back into a bear and attacks Arturo. His first attempt misses; those miss too (rolled a 4 then a 2 on the attacks)! CHA save 16 this time - he breaks the charm (in bear form).

The spirit beast attacks Shem Shine. Crit! 2d8+4+3->15. The spirit rips into Shem Shine, but once again, he reforms. There is no indication of reformation; but each time he's on the verge of death... But *not dead*.

Arturo remembers that the book showed Shem Shein being crushed. Is it that simple? Above us, hangs the giant sculpture. 4 chains, 1/2 thick each. An arrow wouldn't do it. He twins Firebolt to try for two chains. 11, miss, 14, hits; 13 fire damage. A bolt at the top melts and one chain falls free. The sculpture swings slightly and stabilises; it looks like it'll land more or less exactly in the middle. Arturo moves to push the book into the centre with his foot then retreats!

Francesc thinks one chain might not be enough to hold it, but she can take out a second chain, at least, opposite the first to hope that it still looks likely to fall centrally. Despite proximity to Shem Shein she fires at them, with disadvantage; even so, that's a hit, 24. Damage with slugs is 12. Not *quite* enough to break the chain - second attack, same chain - this easily breaks the chain. A clunk and the statue now swings gently, which is rather unsettling.

Francesc risks backing away from Shem Shein; he misses, just; Penny perception 21, the attack is identical to the invisible spirit that attacked Ebda. She figures the invisible spirit from before probably *is* this same creature.

Shem Shein moves to be between Francesc and the book - but then attacks her; Penny hits with an opportunity attack which just, as before, takes it down but it comes right back up. Shem Shine hits Francesc for 15 psychic damage; then it goes and *hugs* the book and looks up, soundlessly hissing! It seems to be saying something but we can't hear it.

Penny moves out of Silence and tries to hit the chains. She manages to get two Scorching Rays (the first of the three, nat 1) from her amulet onto it, but the damage rolls are unbelievably bad - 4d6 total as 1,1,1,2 -> 5 damage is nowhere near enough to break even one of them.

Thorin, as large brown bear, is very heavy. He decides to try and climb up bookshelves a bit (10ft) and then jump (Athl DC 15) atop the structure to break the chains. Check is dirty 20 - he lands on top heavily. The slightly weakened third chain breaks - and the fourth then snaps too (DM rolls to check). **The whole assembly, chains, sculpture and heavy bear crash down 25ft!** Bear Dex save 16, the sculpture takes most of the damage. Shem Shein's mouth opens in a Silence'd scream as the book and him get crushed; a strange swirling around us; lights around come back on; it stops getting cold.

Most of us are backed up against bookshelves. Thorin perception 9, Penny 10, Arturo 16, Francesc 25. Francesc sees that one book in particular, on one shelf, shakes a lot - then falls to the ground - and turns into a copy of Shem Shein's Bedtime Rhymes!

*Francesc decides to just try and silence it - she grabs it with mage hand and puts it into the bag of holding.*

Some of the sculpture falling was outside the Silence range; the whole place shook; this brings Varnya running. "What is going on?! Wait - wait a minute, do you feel like singing at all?"

Penny, being hilarious, sings ""Does the shadow have a name? Shem Sh -" and gets punched in the face. Fair enough.

Varnya wants to lock up the book, but we're not too confident in their ability to keep it safe this time... Varnya argues, but we hold fast. To remove a book from Candlekeep requires a council vote and we're asking for that. Arturo has a different opinion - an adventurer's life is a dangerous one; we might die before we find a way to destroy it. If we *do* find a way, we can come and tell Candlekeep. Persuasion is only 13; Varnya is convinced but Penny less so, but Penny WIS save 18 (self-set DC 12) relents as this is good for the group.

Silence is dropped. Varnya casts Zone Of Truth and asks if anyone has an urge to sing. Arturo grumbles but doesn't argue back; Thorin insight 23, she's understandably paranoid but legit so he's OK with that too; Penny would like to check with Detect Magic herself but is out of spells, so goes along as well. We all seem to be fine. Varnya agrees and dispels the arcane lock. We can leave the cellar.

K'tulah dashes out immediately!

Varnya pulls us aside. "You are clearly here for a reason - for research. And I owe you... I hesitate to say 'my life' but having read the journal, I think we all owe you our lives for what you have done. In light of what you have suggested and your concern about this book, I am going to submit a motion to the Prime Readers if you think you might require access to Candlekeep in a greater capacity than you currently do. Do you think your research would benefit from benefit access?"

(An understatement would be 'yes').

"Do any of you in particular seem drawn to the protection and collection of law and knowledge?" - Penny is, in many ways, but she's not "book smart". Arturo says he's got an interest, but Francesc also is something of a collector of knowledge. Arturo is interested more in secrets than documents; Francesc volunteers. Her name is taken down.

"I think you deserve a good night's sleep somewhere there's no threat to your life and no supernatural possession! Thanks again. I know where to find you."



## Day 17
### 4am AND LEVEL 6

We were trapped down for ages. We're allowed out at 4am and head straight to the dorms for a rest.

* Level 6!

We wake up around midday, but Francesc as usual only needed a few hours sleep and has already discovered a letter addressed to her, with a wax seal, which had been slipped under the door. Inside is a "letter of initiation into the ranks of the Avowed" as an "Avowed Adventurer and a Seeker Of Lore". **This means Francesc is allowed to conduct research within, and bring assistants into, the library beyond the Emerald Gates**. There's a whole page of rules, of course! *At last* - we might finally find what we need to start piecing some of this mystery together.

(End of part 19)
