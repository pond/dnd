# RIPA: Part 25
## Session 25 (2023-12-19)
### Day 26, some time after 10am

We have entered the All Seeing Eye's floating cube in Saiyadar. After exploring a few rooms, we ended up fighting a battle in what we *thought* was a trial room. A long corridor led away at the back of that room and the party had split, simultaneously encountering something very odd down there - an evil, noxious cloud of some kind - above a scrying pool. Some kind of other entity was present, hosted within a kind of crystal golem body, and claimed to be trying to get rid of the cloud.

We managed to defeat the aggressors in the trial room, retrieving a Sun Blade sword from a crystal dais (which was destroyed in the process). The entity present in the scrying pool seemed to be aware of the battle taking place and had mentioned "...sun blade...", seeming to be worried, before leaving that room presumably to head towards the battle, but we have not seen or heard from that entity since. We are very unsure now if our actions were taking part in a trial, or breaking rules and stealing!

Arturo comes into the main room from the corridor he was hiding down. Penny perception 15; he has a shard of some kind, that seems to absorb light or emanate shadow? It doesn't seem *dangerous* - so she asks "What's that?!" and Arturo tries to explain how the crystal powder had led to some kind of vision and then this shard had appeared. He hides it inside his coat.

Perception, Thorin, 19. He notices pieces of crystal from the dias slowly moving along the floor, skittering over his feet and heading back towards the middle area. Francesc 18, hears the sound of soft footsteps. It's Alessia. "Goodness! What happened here?!" - Francesc tries to bluff that the crystal dias just exploded (performance 7, not believed!)

Penny asks, "Sooo... Can we keep this?!" holding out the Sun Blade hilt. "I'll give it back if it's not ours to take." She looks at it, thinks a moment; "I mean - it hasn't always been there, just for a few weeks, eh! Easy come easy go. A previous group of visitors put it there, but I don't know much about it. The dias is repairing itself and I don't think the hilt was ever part of the original room of trials."

Arturo explains about the Dao attack, and says it was presumably a trial; "No, no it's not! This room *used* to be called the Room Of Trials, but that's *before* Vallin was installed here as the oracle." Penny asks about the golem and pool; "Oh, that was probably the voice of Vallin! You encountered one of Vallin's protectors and conduits".

Thorin asks about a more detailed way to Vallin's sanctum. Alessia isn't sure why we want to do that - there's no guarantee that we'd get in. The doors don't open unless we're invited and if we want to speak to Vallin, we can speak to any of the golems. But we prefer the in-person thing... The route - through the pair of doors on the other side of the room, down the corridor, into the great hall, other side is a corridor, heads upwards to the atrium of the sanctum. Penny asks about the hall of mirrors too; Alessia will help us through if we need it. We just have to find her and ask. She heads off.

The corridor through the double doors is rather confusing, crystal walled at an angle. We consider some options; Thorin in particular needs to rest to regain some strength. During the hour we hang out, the dias completely reconstructs itself! No hilt-shaped hole.

We decide to go and try to find Mayastan first. Penny has Blindsight so at Arturo's suggestion, she goes first. She steps into the room with her eyes open normally. Even the entrance itself is hard to discern due to the mirrors and the crystal walls all reflecting. DC20 dex! Fails badly. 27 psychic damage! Francesc only got 9. Unable to separate blindsight from regular vision in the chaos of the mirror, Penny tries closing her eyes. This helps. The confusion abates. She can feel exactly where the mirrors are; doesn't bang into anything. She calls out - "Mayastan! Are you in here?" - but there's a confusing echo. Tinkling sounds; the mirrors moving.

Insight, 20+2->22. Penny figures that if we hold hands, she could lead them safely through with their eyes closed without them walking into anything. So we do that. We walk down the room, but (adv perception 6!) there seems to be no exit. She inches forward and checks again - adv perception (16,20)+2. She's near the far wall; something to the left and right though. A mirror on the left is different; it does seem to be a mirror but hangs differently. On the right there's a tiny break in the mirrors; a gap. On the left, that mirror rotates to reveal a corridor. On the right, there's a very narrow gap - maybe half a foot wide; Penny thinks she could nudge into it gently... We've been chatting as we go; Thorin could turn into a mole, but he's feeling rather short on resources. So, Penny tries to squeeze through.

ACRO check, 11-1->10. Oh. A louder tinkling as Penny brushes against a mirror, which makes all the others move, but with eyes closed, people are not harmed. Penny finds herself in a 10ft x 10ft room, no mirrors - so he opens her eyes - quite dark, strange stars and nebulae beyond its crystal walls. She tries the sun blade, low! Light helps. In one corner there is a crumpled robe with a small satchel; in the opposite corner, scratchings on the floor. The robe seems to be put there to try and hide the satchel but not a great job! In the satchel is a diary and two vials. Starting at the last blank page of the diary, Penny searches backwards to find the last written entry. The last written page has several small entries.

* The last says, "I think it is unavoidable - it is probably my time - it could be glorious; I'm not sure. She's called me to the sanctum."
* The previous entry; "I'm not sure how useful this information will be for him. It's probably too late for me. Besides, I'm curious to know what kind of powers I'll gain."

Curiosity piqued, Penny keeps searching back. Some writings seem paranoid or rambling; others show clarity; "I think she's crazy! She must be crazy!" or "It makes so much sense and it is ultimately for the greater good - she could in fact be the true prophecy", and so-on.

* Then, "I've become quite close in a short amount of time to the Dragonborn" (that's Mayastan). "I think I might share my concerns with him. He seems learned - unlike the others."

Penny bends down to see if the scratchings on the floor make any sense. Nope! They look like arcane workings. Crazy maths on blackboard thing. Penny fetches Thorin, less cautious about brushing against mirrors now since if we keep our eyes shut, it's noisy but not harmful. She shows Thorin the scratchings. Thorin, Arcana 18. They look like wizard's writings. Glyphs and aracane formulae. They seem to describe something he doesn't specifically understand - possibilities and likelihoods of parallel related, but different outcomes, magically linked. Penny guesses that maybe he was trying to figure out how the oracle works.

Penny also shows Thorin the vials from the satchel. Potions of healing of some kind. Penny leaves a note saying "We took your satchel and went to find you, if all else fails, seek Alessia" and moves back to the mirror room, wearing the satchel for now.

We all get led back and into the other exit. A long corridor. Very odd, crystal walls, not flat. Thorin takes the lead. It's quite beautiful/trippy beyond the crystal! Thorin presses on around a corner, along another stretch, and on. It's a long way, with a gentle sideways slope. Arturo proceeds cautiously, running his hands along the walls looking for other hidden exits. Perception 13; he doesn't find any, but *does* note that the walls seem more or less *perfectly* smooth. Surely, this was all built with magic.

(Along the way Arturo asks about the vials. Potions of *Superior* healing. Francesc and Arturo take one).

At another corner, there's a sudden downwards change. It's a steep ramp - some 70 degrees! Thorin starts to walk but all we see is that he "tilts". Another strange gravity thing. We all follow. After one more corner, it opens up - into a *huge* room. A globe, probably some 100ft in diameter, with an entrance at the far side. **The Observatory Of History**. Francesc walks in - and lifts off the floor, floating. She realises she can direct her travel with thought. No gravity!

Visions, all around. A spherical IMAX. We try to focus on a vision. Perception all round. 19 Francesc, 17 Penny, lower for others. There's a moment of clarity; a vision of when Penny and Francesc first met. Then we see independent visions of things we did separately. We stop really noticing, or perhaps even *seeing* Thorin and Arturo. After a minute or so, we both get a rough sense of being able to focus on particular bits.

* **We can replay up to 10 minutes of any past event of which we are aware**

This even includes things we are not part of, it seems, from some of the visions.

We discuss it. The main idea of figuring out the Vallin kidnapping thing is important - but that's why we are here and why we want to see Vallin. The idea of seeing the reaction of the lich when they realised we had their phylactory has some merit because that's a whole other part of our adventures that we've made little progress on.

It's decided. Francesc focuses.

A garden. High walls, towers behind it. Sitting in the shade of a gazebo is a very pale female elf. Long, lustrous black hair, pale skin, dressed in a light night gown (though it is the middle of the day). She plays around with some kind of magical item idly; toys with jewellery; looks bored. She sighs. Looks over at a plant near her - and withers it! Then brings it back to life, then withers it... *And then her eyes widen. Gasps.* She makes little choking sounds and grasps at her chest. Sits bolt-upright, then screams - "**WHO?!**".

She waves her hand across the ground in front of her which churns, turns to mud, sinks and creates a pool of dirty water. She uses it for scrying. She looks in and sees the four of us fighting down in the tomb. She stands, looks closer, then says, "Ha..." - raises her hand, pulls a rod wand out of thing air and starts to inscribe a teleportation rune on the ground. It takes a minute, then she steps through. The vision lurches. The world appears upside down for a moment; then she is standing in a library of a beautiful villa in a totally different city. It looks like Neverwinter, from what we can see.

She walks up to a writing desk, flings it open, rummages through and finds a figurine of a fly. A magic word is spoken and it turns into a giant black fly. She whispers black/dark speech to it. The fly heads out of the window, into the daylight beyond. Now she marches to a hallway, pulls open a warddrobe door and pushes against the back of it. A panel slides back and spiral stone stairs appear. She heads down, a strange green whispy light behind her (apparently magically created).

There are people chained against the walls - dead. In the middle of the room she goes up to a kind of small stone, dark purple, looks like it has a very bright *star* shining in the middle, hanging above a starlit sea, somehow. She carefully picks it up with both hands, puts it into a satchell, stops for a moment to look up and around, then looks straight at Francesc - in the vision - before it ends...

* Francesc, history 22. It's definitely **Lady Velindra Shadowmantle**.
* Oh, wait a minute! **V.S.**! *Not* necessarily Vallin at all.

...INT save, Francesc. 22. This is the past. It can't be changed. Best to just watch it and let it go.

* Describing the fly, Thorin thinks it was a Figurine Of Wonderous Power. The fly was probably a foot long or so; surely we'd have seen it? If it wasn't looking for *us*, then what was it up to?
* Does the lich know we watched her? That whole "looking at Francesc" thing seems to be a bit too much to be a coincidence. At least our anti-scrying and being-in-another-plane thing helps!

We decide to depart, following across the room to the doors at the far side. Arturo continues checking walls. This time, at the end of a long corridor, he finds cracks that mark a door. He pushes, and it slides to one side.

A strangely shaped room, four pillars with globes above carved like eyes, strewn with various lounging pillows. In one corner, lying collapsed is someone in a robe. Francesc recognises Candlekeep colours. She moves the robes to see a dark green dragonborn, collapsed. Penny, medicine check 14. Shrivelled on the ground next to him, Penny spots a strange-looking "rock", shaped like a pancreas, shows signs of being hacked in half before becoming petrified. The man is dead. He's got a wound inside the robe where the pancreas would be... Yet he holds a dagger, loosely, as if he did this himself. Strewn under him are various notes and a couple of scrolls. Thorin looks at the scrolls, but they can only be read by wizards, sorcerers or warlocks. Arturo has a try, while Francesc starts investigating the rest of the room (16). There's at least one other hidden door. There's a cooridor at the far end leading off to a warded, locked door.

Arturo arcana 14. The scroll is titled, "The ritual of restoration", written entirely in arcane. It describes the process of recovering and bringing someone back to life, who has become a canopic golem. We remember about this in the crystal book; rituals to turn into a mummy lord, very hard to kill, their organs transplanted into recipients, who become canopic golems under their control. A canopic golem is a crystal being... **Oh by the hells - Vallin**.

(Arturo pockets the scroll. Well - we pocket *all* the paperwork).

Penny suspects Mayastan was in that situation, guessed it, chose to end his life and destroy Vallin's pancreas and destroying it. We read the notes - grim reading; but it confirms it. And the other robe we found - "I wonder what powers I'm going to get" - did this other person willingly submit to this awful process?

Two scrolls, though. The other is a list, like a matching game. Experimental notes at the top, in a similar writing to the diary Penny notes. "Apparently, choice? Not all turn into golems. Some retain bodies and memories? Why?" Underneath are organ names and names of people:

* "Okuzor - eyes"
* A few other body parts and names, some guesses
* "Me?" (Arrows point to possible organs including pancreas)
* "Semru Thal - nerves"
* Heart and kidneys mentioned

It ends with, "Must be nearby. How many of us are there in here?"

We wonder if Vallin is "complete". Apparently a pencreas isn't done yet. We don't still have access to The Canopic Being. But that book talked about achieving *higher* levels of being. We figure Vallin is probably already a mummy lord. The notes did mention about the heart - "**As long as the heart is intact, the mummy lord cannot be fully killed**".

Of course, we're all thinking - is this why we're here? At least our names are on the list.

Out of paranoia, we check ourselves! Medicine checks all round. Most rolls are low! Generally though we *think* we're OK?!

We look around. Perception 20, 20, 26 for everyone except Thorin. A tingle on the hair on the forearms... We turn to the door, the hidden one found earlier. It swings open. A voice we've heard before. "You may as well come in" - Vallin's voice, projecting from a canopic golem.

"I don't think we can take this person, so we just need to make a good impression!" says Arturo. Penny says to Vallin, cheesily, "Yes. We clearly have much to suggest."

This is a different golem from the one we saw before. It floats in the air, toes pointed down. "Welcome to the antechamber" it says, then stops, its eyes travel down to the satchel Penny wears, there's a brief moment of recognition, then it disappears. Penny asks it, "Did you change willingly, or was it forced?" It answers, "Everyone here is here by their own choice. They followed the prophecy. Did you not choose to come here to see me of your own volition?" and Penny answers, "I wasn't talking to *you*, and you know it." "There is noone else here for you to talk to".

Arturo remembers pictures of canopic jars in the book. A mummy lord's organs are moved into the receipient being; the recipient's organs are put into the jars. If the organ is put back *into* the recipient, they can be restored; but the rite in the scroll does say that you need to somehow "restore" that in their body. Difficult enough in a "person" but even harder in a crystal being!

Perhaps there's hope for Mayastan, somehow, though.

We enter the chamber. Some 40ft high, very strangely shaped, antechamber.

Arturo asks why we've been brought here. "I wanted to give you a choice" is the answer. Perusasion 18. "You are charming. I'll lay it out for you. Please come with me." The canopic being holds hands out, apparently wanting us to take their hands. Arturo first asks to be told where we're going. "Of course!" - she points upwards. A door hangs at a 45 degree angle up above us. Arturo complies; then Penny; the others hold back - "I can take all four of you!" - so Francesc and Thorin join in. We're all levitated. The door, upon approach, pops inwards, then slides sideways.

We're levitated through the doorway and into another room. Motes of light float around in a cube shaped space. The golem lets us go; we float, like we did in the observatory. Beyond the crystal walls, the cosmos. At the far end of the room, sat cross-legged, is a beautiful-looking elven woman with lustrous black hair, pale skin (sounds familiar!) with green monk's wraps and a long flowing golden thread robe. She wears a diadem with a big crystal in the middle. Looking closer, we see these motes are small eyeballs! They all move around, like dust in air currents, presumably at her bidding.

The golem retreats back out of the space.

Arturo thanks Vallin for the personal audience. Sooner than we expected... Penny says it might have something to do with Mayastan's dead body in the adjacant room! Vallin insists he came of his own volition. Penny, dex check, moving closer; takes a few tries (10), but eventually can move more or less normally. Arturo (20) finds he can move quite quickly. Thorin (16) has a go - easier going than Penny but moves a little quicker than normal. Francesc (10) has the same trouble as Penny.

Arturo if Vallin knows *why* we're here. She chuckles. "A clever question. Do I know for sure *why* you are here? No. I know that you were to come here; I knew, or rather I know that you are meant to be here and what has brought you here. I even know what happens from here. But, no; do I know why? Your reasons are your own." Arturo asks about people who seem to be her worshippers kidnapping children! Heretics perhaps...? "They're not my worshippers. Savras has very few worshippers!" - but then she seems to catch herself. "Sorry, I mean *I* don't have that many worshippers. Of course not; I'm not a god." Arturo shows the symbol that one of the clerics was using to pray to Vallin.

She levitates it towards herself to look more closely... Then crushes it into dust! "*A perversion!* This is the problem with people. You know roughly what happens with the world, but very little actual control over what individuals will do. Take for instance your friend here, who has the sun blade. I know that you have the blade and I knew that you would get it and have it. But what you did when you had it, that is not entirely clear. I can't see past the choices I don't understand. So if I don't know why you make the decisions that you do, I see two possible futures."

"Now, you've been patient, I've been patient, but neither of us have much time, would you agree?" Kinda no! She seems to have eternity and we're not in a rush! With a wave of her hand she scatters the 'eyes' away. Against the backdrop of the cube, images start to play out. She looks around, fishing for one; pulls it front and centre, illusion magic. Major Image maybe, thinks Arturo. "Do you understand possible realities? There are two possible outcomes that I have seen. This is one..."

She shows the sun blade being wielded by Penny in combat with Velindra Shadowmantle.

"...and this is the future I am trying to make happen." "Why?" asks Thorin. "Because this is what happens if she's allowed to run free."

Another vision of the future. An undead army is sweeping across all of the major cities of the Sword Coast!

"Of course, it's not entirely alturistic; I become overrun and my own life is forfeit - and that simply cannot be. However, this is the other future..."

The image changes again. This second future shows Penny brandishing the blade over her head, swinging it down, with Vallin herself extending magical shields to protect herself from being attacked.

"So you see, I don't know which way you're going to go. But I can only ever allow *one* of these futures to happen."

Arturo agrees that we pose no threat to her now and don't want to see the Sword Coast overrun, but has an issue with these "not followers" and if she'll help with that we'd have no quarrel... Thorin insight 19, Arturo persuasion 20+8! She's not lying. She wasn't telling the entire truth either. She has to kind of admit; "I might have set some wheels in motion... I didn't intend it to happen this way! But I gave a list of people out. A list of descriptions. I've seen my life threatened by people in the future. And I described that to some of the followers of the All Seeing Eye in the temple. And yes. I'm aware that some have taken it to mean that they must search both future and present for threats to my life. They identify children who might grow up to be people who might go after me and kill me. I realise that is a very flawed method. Which is why I set plans in motion to get *you* to come here directly, so we could enact a much stronger plan! Something more lasting. Something more durable. Something more immediate."

Thorin asks, "Did you make any plans for the kids to be released?" "I saw they were taken. I did not instruct it." Francesc says, "But you're a mummy lord! I mean...?!" - she turns to Francesc who hears a chuckle; "Of course you know. I suppose you've read the book as well?" Then out loud - "What's interesting is that the four of you are a big unknown to me. I could track your possible futures right up until about two weeks ago. I'm very interested to know what happened." Thorin looks alarmed; "Well, I know you have the amulets!" she says. "But why should we trust you?" says Francesc. "Because we could mutually benefit each other." "What do you do for us?" asks Thorin. "I can imbue that holy weapon of vengeance with some form of protection, so you no longer need to rely on these amulets."

Penny says, "The amulets work. I want Mayastan brought back. As himself. With his own organs." "You are welcome to do that! I know that you have the Rite Of Reclamation on you. I saw you take it." "Do you have his organs?" "You know where his pancreas is! It's in the grand hall, in a canopic jar."

Francesc shoots for the moon. She wants the forest burning at Neverwinter stopped. "I can order an assassination", says Vallin! Francesc asks if we can stop it without such extreme measures. "I find the most effective and sure-fire way of affecting the future is to identify those who would make a future happen and remove them. Those are the methods I have to offer."

Vallin offers us a simple path now. Questions about the future.

"Where is the Star Forge?" "North of the mountains in the mouth of the Delimber Vale. But you will not get to it from above ground; it must be approached from under. Why do you want to go to the Starforge? Is it because you want to destroy the phylactory? Then I can make that the trade. *I* can destroy the phylactory. I don't want to leave my sanctum - I can't destroy the lich. I don't want to be contaminated! If I am exposed to the pollutants of your world, I will be denied ascension."

Vallin mentions pretty dangerous force moving through the world. We realise that this refers to the same forces Helm's Hall detected. Valindra Shadowmantle holds an artefact which is drawing the forces of this otherworldly army to her; and if they were to ever meet, they'd become "too powerful for even me to defeat. We would lose your world. I would be fine; I would lose the conduit to which this place is tethered; I could create new tethers, but that would take a long time and delay my ascension."

We hear that the scrying pool has been "corrupted" and Vallin doesn't know why or by whom!

Penny says, "Honestly, I would choose *both futures*, except you claim you'd only accept one - understandably". Penny tries both Divine Sense to see just how 'evil' Vallin is, by her compass; Vallin is definitely undead; some kind of higher form of mummy lord; nothing consecrated/desecrated; and L1 Detect Magic; it just fails. It's as if never cast.

We need a moment to think. There's one place all the eyes cannot see - the hall of mirrors. That's probably why there was a hideway there. She permits us some time to think, but insists we are quick!

The golem carries us back. Penny is headed for the hall of mirrors, but the others suggest bringing Mayastan to the Great Hall to try and help him. Thorin thinks he knows the way that we were told by Alessia, so heads through double doors out of the sanctum. We head out of the chamber. CON saves; Francesc and Penny 15, queasy but OK; Thorin & Arturo fine; this is all because of another strange sloping floor and gravity shift. We head along and soon enough down the corridor reach the Great Hall.

A ledge runs around the great rectangular (top-down) space (with a crazy shaped roof and floor). Ramps lead down to a lower section. Clay jars covered in writing are set at various points around the ledge. At the bottom is a diamond-shaped depression with a sarcophagus sitting in the middle.

Three try to go down to the sarcophagus. Penny doesn't risk it - armour is too heavy. Acrobatics for everyone else run around the 7,8,9 range! They slip and slide, fall around and *just* avoid falling off the edges, 80ft drop! They are prone, looking over the edge... Then Francesc remembers she can fly! She lifts up. Meanwhile, a canopnic golem has appeared in the middle of the room and floats, observing. Francesc flies down towards the sarcophagus - down, down... There's a dais there, looks like a big eye from above, with the sarcophagus as the pupil. When about 20ft off the ground - CON save. 8. She starts retching and reeling! She's engulfed in a 30ft sphere of a Stinking Cloud, triggered by her proximity.

Once she's recovered a bit, Francesc beats a hasty retreat!

"Let's just focus on the pancraeas from this corpse we've been lugging around..." suggests Penny.

**"One lich at a time" says Arturo.**

Francesc looks at the jars; nothing; Penny asks the golem, but persuasion is only 12, perception at an eye movement it makes is only 14. At least she deduces that it's to the right of the golem. The jars are delicate and old; someone with nimble hands is needed to help open a jar. Not Penny this time! Arturo helps Francesc.

* First jar: adv ATHL 24. Pair of kidneys.
* Next jar: adv ATHL 23. Heart.
* Third jar: adv ATHL 17. Oh! A pancre - and the jar is clipped by the side of the lid. It rolls!

As a reaction, Arturo tries to grab it! Check to catch it, 22. He catches it just in time.

We check the Rite scroll. Wax, holy water, dust from Vallin's body... Oh. Or resurrection! Candlekeep could do that - our only option, really. So we have to bring him and his pancreas along until we're able to get back there.

We get into the Hall of Mirrors, where we have privacy. Penny opines that while she hates the idea of a mummy lord, and might not trust Vallin's words at all, she thinks that solving the extraplanar incursion seems important! We were already keen to get rid of Shadowmantle. Thorin suggests grabbing the heart the Great Hall and using the teleportation helm, in an attempt to get at the mummy lord directly. Penny and Arturo advise against it. The discussion continues for some time, quite intense; moral dilemmas abound.

In the end we decide to agree to Valin's terms, but on our conditions and with Penny keeping an open mind to research killing mummy lords and maybe coming back to do that in future if we felt morally justified in so doing. After all, we certainly don't konw how to kill her *now*, so heart or no heart, we have to be able to get back into this cube at some future point to have any chance either way.

We leave the mirrors to get back to the sanctum, but we get diverted by Thorin who wants a look at the scrying pool himself. Francesc's magic determines that the cloud is indeed poisonous and corrosive. Arturo's high arcana check means, via his Fey Wild experience and understanding from studies of things like the consequences of backwards runes... This is a consecrated holy area, but some ruins have been flipped. He'd need to spend a minute to do it, and would be somewhat in the miasma - unless he uses Mage Hand!

After a minute, he flips the runes. A change in the room - the fog slowly starts to dissipate. The pool over the course of another minute or so starts to go clear. Scrying pool... It clears, it cools; we look; it turns crystal clear. Thorin aracana, Francesc history, both 13; they don't quite understand how to use it. Penny (via passive perception) notices a set of dusty divination components and a cabinet - with a false back. She taps on the back a bit and, with luck, it clicks, and pops back; there's a standing scroll case with two scrolls and a missing third one. All the same kind of paper and scroll design as the Rite Of Reclaimation. In front of that, is a beautiful looking crystal ball! Penny arcana 3-1=>2. Thorin has a look (Arcana 19) - a *very* powerful magical artefact that's been hidden here for some reason and apparently forgotten. It looks like it is part of a bigger grand design, since Thorin can see where claws would fit into the bottom of it. It is a ball of True Seeing, allowing a user to cast the Scrying spell; but giving the gift of True Sight from the point of scrying. Francesc puts it into the bag of holding straight away! It's now in a pocket dimension... We have our amulets... No golems here... Hopefully Vallin doesn't know.

One of the scrolls is in an arcane language. Aracana rolls for three of us are very low, but Francesc, 20! A series of command words to disable a Glyph Of Warding. The last scroll is a scroll with an arcane lock on it. It denies access to a certain area. These are one-use scrolls, though.

A crystal ball, glyph that removes a ward, denial of entry and that missing scroll - probably the Rite - it seems like someone was plotting against Valin.

Arturo decides to try and use the crystal ball to scry into that locked room! It works... He sees through it. A treasure room. Shelves and tables *full* of items. Right in the middle of the room is a twisted, ancient silver clawed stand; sitting on top is a black ball. Arturo "approaches" while scrying. WIS save... 4. He hears sounds coming from the crystal ball, rather than directly into his head. Whispers. He doesn't know if others can here. "Come. Your destiny awaits. I have been ancitipating your arrival" all that kind of thing. Given that WIS save - Arturo is compelled to 'look' closer... An infinite black void... Pinpricks of light that get larger, swirling like a nebula; exploding into stars as he's drawn in; something tells me he's seeing the birth of a new universe! "All of this could be yours" says the voice; "Together we can mould the universe to your design". Arturo whipsers, "Are you Savras?" "Savras?! You think I am a mere god?" (the rest of us hear Arturo muttering). "You have all the tools you need to reach me" says the voice. "Come! I'm waiting!" Arturo asks, "How do I deal with Valin?" "It will all be revealed!"

Arturo puts the ball away. He tells us there's a huge treasure room and something that looks really useful against Savras *and* the lich. Penny, insight 13, she doesn't see a particular danger in what's being described, but Francesc is still unsure. She thinks its a dumb idea though! Penny does warn that - again - **Valin might see this as an attack**. She tries to persuade Arturo; dirty 20. Arturo claims that Valin has shown no ability to leave her plane and hasn't shown any particular help to us, so we could do what we need to do and teleport out... His persuasion, 10.

Penny - Capybara face.

Arturo hears *some* sense and is a bit less certain.

Penny tries to convince Thorin too, only 11. Thorin's persuasion roll is 12! He's not convinced. *Treasure!*

Undecided, we know we at least have to head to the sanctum.

In the sanctum, Francesc picks up the petrified pancreas and examines that warded door. There's some kind of lock with a hole that looks like it'd fit the gem we saw in Valin's diadem. The ward will trigger if anyone tampers with the door. And of course we have the scroll. We *can* disable the ward - but it's still a locked door and we're not good at picking locks. We could bash the door (says Arturo) but it'd be noisy ("but you could cast Silence!") and they'd *know* we'd done this because the door would be destroyed.

Thorin isn't happy, in particular he doesn't know if we can ever get back in here. He's going to try and teleport using the tile, but that's to the courtyard in another plane. Arturo could try teleporting into the treasure room at some risk, since Arturo saw in there very clearly.

"I think this is possibly the stupidest idea you've ever had" says Francesc, but Thorin's enthusiasm is unbounded. Penny agrees with Thorin, but has to go where they go to protect them if need be... Arturo would have to attune to the helm. Argh. Back again! We don't want to risk that right out here, with only one door betwee us and Valin (!), so we go back to the scrying pool and Thorin looks there. He doesn't dwell on the room - just a quick look to be familiar enough for teleport. D100 -> 79, phew!

It works. We are teleported into the room. Treasure everywhere. All gems seem to be emeralds. Penny says, "*Please* don't take anything, *none* of this is ours..." - right in the middle of the room, the antique silver pedestal. Penny sees it - WIS saves all round.

* Penny 28
* Arturo 11
* Thorin (with inspiration blown) 21
* Francesc 18

Penny points at the very creepy black ball on the pedestal and says, "Hmm, Arturo, so would *that* happen to be the thing that's going to help us defeat both Savras and the lich?" "Yes!" says Arturo, enthusiastically.

Penny via 28 wisdom save knows this is a thing of legend. Immune to all damage. "Obscura Forturum". We all hear the whispers this time, but don't get drawn in. Arturo on the other hand, *really* wants to touch it and attune to it. He starts to move towards it. Penny tries to grapple him - athl, only 10. Thorin tries too; 13; Arturo 17, he wriggles out of our grasp. While we're doing that, Francesc tries to swap the two balls at the same time. The true sight ball goes onto the pedestal and the Obscura goes into the bag of holding. Slight of hand, 14. Arturo tries to grab it, 17 again. He gets it!

The orb is giving Arturo visions of a future where he is in *full* control of his magic. Wild magic surges do not happen. He's whatever colour he wants to be. He's in the Fey Wild, but in control of his surroundings, by himself, doing whatever he wants. No moths.

Arturo has spider-climbed up to the ceiling. Penny moves away as far as she can, unsure what to do. Thorin tries to Entangle him with vines, which Arturo is too busy examining the orb to even try and avoid. Francesc flies up to try and wrestle it out of Arturo's grasp, contested athl; 16 Francesc vs 13 Arturo. Francesc has the ball! WIS save. FFS. Natural 2. So now *Francesc* is being controlled but Arturo really wants the ball back.

The future she sees... The forest is growing. Cities are retreating. Gods are dying. The ball promises to give her the power to do this. She becomes a ruler over a multiplanar world where keys can close off doors to planes of Gods.

She puts it into the bag of holding.

Penny, insight 17. She sees clearly that both of them have been taken over by this thing.

Oh, dear...
