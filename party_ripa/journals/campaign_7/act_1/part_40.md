# RIPA: Part 40
## Session 40 (2024-06-04)
### Day 41 (Late), Gracklstug

We need to see the Stonespeaker, but there is a debate about the location of tablets. Three are already in the library. One more is now with us. We've got rubbings of the others, so all we need now is the one left in the library. We're not sure if we want to now gather four of them in that library - the lich having the other three now - but we don't have much choice; it remains the safest place we can think of.

We consider a possible ruse, then; instead of storing this found tablet in the library, give it to the lich as if playing along. This keeps knowledge of the remaining 3 in the library secret and stops the lich asking prying questions about this particular area.

Off we go - the Stonespeaker is surprised, to say the least, to meet the new giants! They will be fine; they're already chatting to people about what's happened here, and what happened to them. Collectively, persuasion 24, we're already allowed into the library; but the issue of taking the newly-found (albeit replica) tablet is more difficult. In the end, they agree to spend time making a new physical copy of that replica, and letting us keep the old replica.

We elect to wait. They get started on the replica; we will rest "overnight".

Francesc remembers the "one big eye" encounter person that she *almost* knew, but couldn't remember quite in detail; she asks the giants, describing as best she can. (DM history roll) - they don't know, but if there was anywhere that this information could be found - the library!



### Day 42, Gracklstug to Graven Hollow library

A younger acolyte named **Jaal** is fetched. It's quite a distance to the library - over 300 miles. But we have the long crystalline rod, the Stonespeaker crystal, which they say did come from there. We don't know how long ago it was taken though... But we don't have a choice because we only have a few days to locate all of this information. The guide, just in case, spends time describing in painstaking detail what the entrance of the library looks like.

Jaal asks if we're ready... He's happy to risk the teleport. He fetches the new replica. We bag the old one. The male giant from the Cradle wants to come too - he offers to carry the tablet too! To be polite we agree (and he has many more precious things from his old village).

D12 -> 3; having thought about it overnight, the Stonespeaker remembers that the crystal was fetched only around 3 months ago. Risk averted! The helm will get us straight there. The portal opens; we all step through.

A crystal archway - an inscription in Giant, "The Society Of Brilliance"; crystal stone all around. Jaal takes a while to get his bearings. "This is the right place... This is - unusual. We arrived here in the blink of an eye!" We explain briefly about the Helm.

He tells us that when we walk through the entrance hall, we must think of something we want to know and we must not make any eye contact with anything in the room!

* Francesc thinks about the one-eyed creature
* Penny thinks about how to understand the poem of the tablets
* Thorin thinks about how he uses the staff he has
* Arturo wants to know about ways to return to the fey wild!

ADV wis save, +5 aura bonus.

* Francesc 19; she's aware of large, 4ft long spiny-backed lizards that are lounging around and sometimes moving a little!
* Arturo 19 
* Thorin 24; he too notices the lizards
* Penny 26

At the end of the entrance hall is a gate. Jaal is keeping his eyes down-cast. "Stop, wait here". A voice - serpentine sounding - says, "it's about time you lot arrived. Come! The library has bid me to guide you through the gate and I've waited too long for you already!"

It's a large lizard creature, think Francesc and Thorin, as they see one of them walk forward in front of us. As it approaches the big stone gates, they swing open.

Everyone resists the temptation to look around until we're through!

An old foyer, damp, water running walls and into pools nearby; beyond, though, it is drier; it seems that the water is being carefully channeled. The lizard is a basilisk - ah! That would turn us into stone!

Massive basalt doors in dark, dense material are flanked either side by 28ft tall stone statues of armoured, stout-looking giants. Jaal leads us on. The statue heads turn to follow us as we walk. The room is huge - ceilings more than 30ft up, the corridor opening to an enormous central area with numerous corridors off in 8 directions, a sunburst pattern. There are steps leading up to other levels.

Arturo asks Jaal - "how do we find anything here?" "First thing's first! Let's get the tablet to safety; I assume you'd like to see the tablet in the collection". He places his hand on the ground and starts to hum; it seems to reverberate through the floor, which then produces a series of rumbling stones that assemble into a form that introduces itself in a gravelly voice as **Horm** - a Keeper who can help us navigate the library. "Would you like to place anything in your quarters before we go further?"

We're keen to keep moving. Jaal and the older giant join us. We now see three other stone giants here, that seem to maintain the library, moving books around; they don't speak but make eye contact and acknowledge other giants. They don't look down to seem to notice us! Horm explains that they are the actual librarians.

* **Ulthar**, keeper of the past
* **Urmas**, keeper of the present
* **Ustoba**, keeper of the future - a dream-seer

Insight/Perception:

Penny 16, Ustoba seems concerned! She's not meditating, but in her head instead about something upsetting. Penny asks Francesc to ask if she's OK. Persuasion 17. Ustoba's eyes cloud as if having a vision for a moment; but then she holds a tablet she was working on forward, above Francesc, as if handing it to someone her own height. The old giant from the Cradle intercepts it. What's written has been repeated over and over.

**Chaos - fire - blood - death**

It's in a spiral, with twin forked symbols; large and small runes around, looking totally chaotic. It looks unhinged.

OK, moving on...!

We're led to an area with numerous alcoves. Some have many shelves of books, but one has seven pedestals. Three are filled. We immediately recognise two of the tablets; **so here, at last, is the seventh**. Jaal places the fourth tablet into place.

We wait for the transcription; it will only take a few minutes.

We ask Horm about the one-eyed creature we met. We're brought to the Halls Of History; they're downstairs. Of various topics offered, Religion is a "maybe" but "famous people" seems likely!

Dex saves - Penny 22 surprisingly, Arturo 20, Thorin 10, Francesc is still transcribing. Thorin doesn't notice someone walking into him as we head inside! He is clipped for 2 points force damage - it's from a strange, translucent (almost) being, sort of phasing past. She looks elven, tall, ageless; at a guess, 300-600 years old. Her hair is completely silver, fine features, a long golden-white flowing wizard's robe that's a bit over-the-top! She holds a staff with criss-crossed metal bands at the top. She seems oblivious to anyone else around, fixated on trying to find information.

Thorin perception 24, thinks he recognises this person from books - legends, really - she should be a lot older than this, even when written about hundreds of years again. He calls out "**Alustriel**!" - she stops, turns and says, "I don't believe we've met!" "No - I've only ever heard of you in books, of times long gone." "Yes, books, useful things." As she leans closer he notices that she's even younger than he thought; she's coalescing now into something a bit more solid. Half-elven? If human she'd be in her late 20s only. She smiles; "That is very kind of you to say; but I still don't know who you are!" "My name is Thorin Beastcaller" "It is a pleasure meeting you. Were you after something? Can I help you in any way?"

Thorin explains as best he can.

She floats down the hall, pulls out a book and brings it back. "Wouldn't happen to look like *this* would they?" - she opens the book. Hmm - well, similar, but not quite the same. The picture we see is clearly a lich - ghastly, dead-looking, but does have the missing eye and hand thing going on. "That might be them, but they didn't quite look like that..." he says. "Well," she says, "he is a menace, a tyrant and a problem - at least he was in my time. There's an entire section devoted him" - she points. Penny asks, "What's his name?"

(She has already had a guess).

The book's title is "The Tyrant Of Oerth - The Lich Vecna" (she says out loud, "it's not wise to speak his name!")

(Yeah. It's him... The boogeyman.)

She says that this is very troubling - especially when we reveal that the reason we asked was because we *met* this person. She explains she's messing with time (!) "...a dangerous thing..." - and has possibly already said more than she should. She wishes us "a turn on luck's wheel; perhaps we will meet again and, when we do, I will be in the right time to lend you more aid."

She nods, returns to her translucent form and returns to book browsing.

Whatever we saw, it wasn't the same though. We saw a sort of mechanically augmented creature. Yes, a missing hand; but replaced with metal. A glowing small eye, rather than a missing eye.

Horm has overheard all of this and is concerned! A few minutes in, though, he seems to cheer up (or at least stops looking concerned).

We will have to return here to read as much as we can. Arturo wants to know first if those seven pedestals had a particular order. We return there; Francesc has finished transcribing; but Jaal says that we don't know the order. Penny was also, of course, wondering how we might decode it.

So what now?

To start with, we figure we'd read each tablet and see if it seems to have a start an end, or if there's an indication of flow from one to another. INT-based insight, Francesc, 22. Four of the tablets have in particular a kind of cadence, a rhythm, based on units of four; and three have a cadence of 5-words, 3-words; 5-3-5-3 each. Arturo suggests mixing them - the fours with the 5-3-5-3 in between. There are a few permutations of that but each tablet is otherwise kind of self-contained so that's tricky.

Insight all round. Highest are Arturo 19, Francesc 21; the alternating pattern is shuffled around, but they can't figure it out. Thorin steps in to have another go. Francesc helps him have a go. We're into a second half hour of playing around. With Guidance on himself, Thorin gets Insight 26 (lucky 4 on the d4). It's narrowed down, he thinks, to one of two possibilities.

* One way of reading it suggests a sequence of places. Each tablet references some kind of person or myth or deity. Reading it over and over, he figures out that only one of them makes actual sense; the other refers to stuff we have no knowledge about. Discussing *that* with the rest of us, we realise the rest of us don't know either. Perhaps each tablet leads to a location where people would recognise those names, leading to the next location and so-on.

* Another way to read it is a possible narrative, an overall story, where people try to find something important - a cornerstone location of sorts - in each world; the piece is placed there, but becomes indispensable to that world, adding to its protection - they won't want it to be removed and it might, indeed, even doom the world to take it.

Of the tablet with names/places we recognise - there's a location of which we only recently became aware; the Abyss. One of the pieces was hidden in the Realm of the Demigorgon. But if the Demigorgon *found* the piece, perhaps he brought it with him to *this plane* since he's now here, somewhere, in the Underdark.

Unable to really assist further, Arturo asks for help hunting for his Fey Wild solutions. He's taken to the Present. He sees a young, raven-haired woman, human, wearing a somewhat pointy hat - wizard-ish! - with a gnarled branch staff and a belt made of gold cord. The staff has, at the end, some kind of bristles - almost like a strange broom! She has a chicken's foot tattoo on her eye and looks to be in her 30s. She's running around quickly, pulling out books, in a flighty way. Arturo has read of her; this is the Creator Of Spells - **Tasha**. Like the elf, she's transparent - perhaps even moreso.

Arturo calls out, "Excuse me, are you the guide here? Tasha?"

She's less "present". Arturo finds he can even occupy the same space as her. So instead, he just starts checking books. **Rules about crossings; when they happen, pass phrases** - actions, shapes, words, dances, songs, anything, specific to each crossings - and they exist across most Prime Material Planes. They tend to be places where imagination is more likely to be the rule than the exception. So they don't tend to crop up in, say, court rooms in towns! Old forests; magical-looking waterfalls; mushroom rings are common.

Francesc and Thorin crack it. With Guidance (d4 -> 4 again!), insight 31.

This time they ignore the 4/5-3 alternating cadence and rearrange things based on eliminating every second line, those being - they realise - flowery, decorative words, then it reads as if instructions. The plane, place and the word to dispel the repelling nature of the rod.

The 'removed' lines form a flowery fable poem.

"Miska, the queen of wolf spiders, demon lord, ancient one, of pure chaos; the universe threatened, the Wind Dukes of Axa, their laws combined, a rod created to banish the chaos at a point, a pivot, when all is but lost. They used all the laws at their disposal to banish and lock her in Pandemonium, and held back chaos, and established law; ordered the planes into where they belonged; separated the multiverse. And to hold this, a piece of the rod placed at each plane."

So... Perhaps the veil between Abyss and our plane has been weakened because the Demigorgon *did* bring it here?

And... If we gather these pieces, does this not mean that all those planes start to collapse back together? Seems like it - and we've no idea how long we have before that gets Bad (as in, "we're too dead to use the rod to fix it" bad).

**At least we now have the seven words to join the seven segments and should be able to determine the 'powers' that each segment has.**

The first one is easy enough. **In terms of power - the rune for the Demigorgon's piece, believed now to be on our plane, has the power to Speak/Commune/Communicate** - that might be how he arranged to get the cult together which brought him through; it can speak across planes.

Arturo is able to identify locations of runes, based on patterns, and Francesc translates.

* Speak/commune/communicate - as we know
* A great illusion, all-encompassing
* Grow back/Rebuild/Regenerate
* Portal/gateway
* Upside down/Reversal
* To see a road/Find a path
* Double/Duplicate as it pertains to creatures

Francesc, perception 24. The 'duplicate being' rune actually has more - a rune for the Nine Hells.

The poem's narrative indicates that the first of the rod segments in the sequence would be the Commune. The seventh would the Duplicate/Nine Hells. We decipher what we think for now is the correct order (but we might be wrong):

* Speak/commune/communicate - also a rune for the Abyss
* Portal/gateway - also a rune for "centre of the wheel" - Sigil, we think
* Upside down/Reversal - a rune for a world that is cut off from all
* Grow back/Rebuild/Regenerate - a rune for a deathly shadow / Shadow Fell
* To see a road/Find a path - a rune for a plane or world of dragons
* A great illusion, all-encompassing - a rune for what we now know is Oerth
* Double/Duplicate as it pertains to creatures - also a rune for Nine Hells

After several hours, that's all we can really get. It's really not bad!

Thorin has some time to research about his staff and the binding curse, to see if he can be released from VS's obligation. D20->7. We all enter an area of the future. We want *to* remove something - future tense. Sat in the middle on a chair is a blue, glowing, spirit-like being; Thorin (15 Arcana) thinks that he's seen books with drawings of this person. A famous mage! He likes to draw himself on his own books - Mordenkainan. This time he *does* notice us when we come in. He looks *very* old; wizened, restful, but not decrepit. His eyes light up! "Young adventurers! I remember when I was an adventurer. Hotblooded, reckless! But so powerful. Are you here to discover your future?" - he cautions us that trying to avoid things can be what causes them. Don't overthink it.

Thorin explains about VS and the staff - the 'pact', or obligation. "May I see it?"  "Sure!". He examines it; determines that it can be removed with a Wish. But he's not here in person - just an echo from our future! - "but I have advice for you. This type of magic lasts only as long as the one who created it is alive." This *does* work for an undead who cast the spell while undead.

"Depending on the nature of this creature, this entity, that might be easier than finding someone who is willing to cast a Wish for you. It is a very rare and very powerful spell, one that took me a very long time to learn. And I cast it only sparingly, as it is something that changes the very fabric of the universe when it is used. And there is a risk every time it is used, that you lose the ability to ever use it again. If there is another solution, that is often the better one."

Thorin thanks Mordenkainan, who goes on to tell us stories, which helps us pass the time.

After a while we return to the 'Vecna section' to see if we can find out more. Mechanics: Each book is 1 hour, to be flipped through. Some are in Common, or other languages. We each spend some 3-4 hours on this, which is as much as we can stomach before being overloaded with information!

We've been in the library for 6-7 hours now. Horm comes by to check on us. "Would you like me to show you your rooms now?" "Yes please!"

* **If we roll any history, insight, perception or arcana rolls pertaining to Vecna or his actions, we will have both Proficiency and Advantage**

The quarters are Giant scale. We can all share the same bed as it's big enough - some 8x25ft. It's a stone room.

Wandering around later, we see more of what we learn are *apparitions*. These are echoes - people who have in the past, or will in the future visit the library. The librarians ask who we saw, as different people walk into rooms and see different apparitions. Penny asks if *we* would be apparitions and to our surprise - yes, we may have already been apparitions to people who visited in the past; and might also be for people who visit in future. But our "present selves" have no memory of it. Sometimes, apparitions are simply too distant anyway - Arturo experienced that with Tasha.

We debate next steps. We could go to see VS with the tablet, to see what else she's learned. Every time we visit, though, there's a risk she'll see through our deception. We think we'll keep it in standby and see how far we can get on our own steam - get to Gracklstug? But then Arturo reminds us that we have an "in" with a House at the Drow capital. And we have a symbol from there. We could teleport directly!

After some debate... We decide - yes. We'll risk it!

It's been an intense day of research. Exhausted, we head to our quarters and sleep.



### Day 43, Graven Hollow library -> Menzoberranzan

Luckily the helm has recharged with two spells, so if things go badly wrong with the Drow, we've a chance of a quick exit.

We say our goodbyes; the Helm is activated; we walk through the tear in reality.

D4->1. Initiative rolled all round to see who does what. Three of us get 19! Francesc, 16. Francesc is not quite as on-guard as normal, but the rest of us recognise immediate peril.

We are in a grand hall, near some curtains to the side and **all eyes are upon us** (the helm portal is hardly subtle). A woman sits upon a throne on a raised dais with an elaborate headdress. She has a corseted large dress made of chitin, bone and spider silk. Standing on either side are two male Drow with full armour. There are four females in priestess robes and some 18-20 or so guards stood by various pillars. There's another Drow gentleman kneeling in front of the 'queen' pleading some kind of case - and we recognise the Scion, with retinue, also on one knee.

Arturo quickly pulls out the symbol and with Penny's help tries speaking quickly; we're here by request to help kill the demons! Persuasion 20. Not quite enough; guards don't lower crossbows - but also don't lower them. The Matron is confused; Arturo is somehow leading but Penny is translating.

She chooses to address the female. But the rest of the room suddenly tenses - as a moment later, Francesc arrives. *Wrong kind of elf*. And the scion looks horrified.

One of the priestesses glides over our way. Thorin notices that she's a distraction; WIS saves; Penny 16. Arturo 18. Thorin 33! Francesc 14... She's held in place, unable to move. Penny speaks quickly, and says in Undercommon - "it's worse than we thought, Vecna is involved, and the Demigorgon is already on this plane".

One of the male Drow hanging back in the shadows lurches forward and hisses. "Fool! Do not speak the name that cannot be said! Why would you bring such wrath down on our house?" The Matron says, "Who has sent you? Which of our covetous, jealous rivals has inserted this worm of a spy into our house?" then to the Scion, "Why do you bring these spies to us?"

Penny says, "Superstitions aside, valid though they may be, I give the name because the danger is already real and present." Thorin adds, "The evil is already at all of our houses." Penny continues, "We're here because your scion wisely thought we might have something of value to offer you!"

The priestesses, annoyed at the failure of Hold spells, twirls towards us with three-headed whips out. One hits the scion. "This one? You would raise the actions of this male in this house? In front of the first daughters of Benra? In this house? Audacious! And what makes you think we need *your* help? What could you possibly bring us which Loth herself has not already bestowed upon this great house?"

"We know the location of the first two rod segments and how to join them" says Penny.

They don't seem to know what the rod segments. So we explain what it is.

"You would bring this cursed item, this artefact of legend, into this world?"

Penny says, "We would if it were the only way to defeat the powers that rise to destroy everything."

The Matron stands, apparently angered. She steps onto a small swarm of giant spiders who carry her towards our group. "You of little faith! I would expect no less from those who would consort with traitorous children. *We* have ultimate faith in Loth. She provides. There is *nothing* that can threaten us here. Loth would never allow it. We have shown our strength! We are vicious and merciless, and in our greatness she will certainly protect us. We have no need for your tricks."

Thorin tries... "We believe Loth has sent us!" - deception, meanwhile Arturo is trying to be obsequious to assist... ADV, only 9. (Meanwhile, Francesc breaks the Hold spell).

So that goes badly. At least it makes the Matron laugh! Then she turns, apparently ignoring us, and turns to the Scion. "Are these people that you have allied with and consorted with? How else would they have marched right into my chambers? Did you give them that pin?"

The scion draws his blade. He guts one of his guards! He says, "My pardons; I have wronged you. I have been misled by those close to me." He slashes himself too! "I have wavered. I did in fact ally with these outsiders - what was I to do? I do not have the ear of the Priestesses, or of you, Mother. I was doing the best that I could. Clearly that is not enough. I will remove these Upworlders from our House - and remove myself. I will come to seek your forgiveness another day."

He yells to us. "SCUM! Slaves. Come with me!"

We comply. We try to mimic his 'retreat' body language, all backwards and bowed.

He leads us out into the labyrinthine halls beyond the throne hall. One guard is dead, he is injured. "What were you thinking?! We need to get you out of here! That was suicidal, appearing in the Hall when the Matron is there..." - that was the 1 on the d4. Penny meanwhile hands-on heals a bit. He seems surprised. "Why are you being kind to me?!"

He finds a side cupboard with some dark cloaks. "Put them on! Cover up, especially *you* with your - shiny things!" - he means Penny.

We go out a doorway to the side. It's very dark here; Arturo and Penny can't see much. Francesc and Thorin see a massive subterranean complex, huge stalactites that are more like rock pillars, often connecting with stalagmites. A bristling city of towers is built into the rock. Very old strands of giant spider silk are so common that they almost look like a layer of cloud in places. A purplish glow from veins in the rock is the only light source. The city is built in many layers. A whole section looks ruined - recently so - crushed and crumbled, with a big hole in the wall of the cavern, about 300ft away. Indistinct in the dim light, though.

The walls feel organic. Everything is covered in strange patterns, almost fractal, of webbing; it seems all over. Ground is dark rock, worn smooth from probably centuries of footfall. We're led into something that might be an abandoned residence or store room. "So really! Why have you come here? Why have you risked your lives coming here? Is what you say true?"

Yes, it is. And how many other gods can Loth defeat, however powerful she might be?!

He sighs. "I have bad news for you... You must not tell anyone. I don't know who we can trust here but you're not from here, so strangely, you're probably the people I can trust most in the entire city! **Loth is behind the demon incursion.** I have actual proof of it. I have operatives in the Demon Web Caverns not far from here; my spies at Web's Edge have spotted a Dragon Spider (!) with priestesses of Loth who are summoning forth rank and file, and generals, of a demonic army. There are reports that there is a *very* powerful artefact that they have gained control of. More demons appear by the day. The summoning appears linked to the artefact but none of us can get close enough to figure out what they're using."

He has no idea if this artefact is the rod piece we think is on our plane. But somehow, they're able to coordinate with all the other demon armies; a network of spies, cross-cultural, reporting a very coordinated mobilisation of various demonic forces all around Blacklake and beyond. That does sound like perhaps the rod is being used as a communication tool, but something else might be doing summoning. **And worse, they have now managed to open a gate large enough for the demon lords to physically push through now - not just their influence.**

None have come through yet, but it is believed imminent.

There are plans afoot to maybe try to incite and free slaves in the city, in order to cause a riot and bring the attention of the Houses down to quell that. It would be a distraction. That might help us get close enough to see what was going on at the Demon Web Caverns.

Arturo tries to convince for a modification to have them riot but also run - so that Houses must give chase, to try and extend the duration of the distraction; persuasion 25; OK, he'll go with that. But they need to be corralled away from *us*, in a direction that takes them away from where we want to investigate. Arturo says that the Scion should talk to a slave leader, instigate the revolution, give them supplies to help their cause, and give them a safe exit route - *away* from us. And who knows - some of them might actually survive, this way around.

### LEVEL 10

It will be two to three hours as we lie low in this strange little place until the distraction starts. Arturo dons his silk armour to fit in more. We decide we can't risk waiting until the distraction is underway before moving closer, as it's about an hour to the Caves we were told and we don't know if it will last that long.

Instead, we're going to have to use cunning and stealth to get closer, then wait for the commotion to start.

What could possibly go wrong?

(End of part 40)
