# RIPA: Part 14
## Session 14 (2023-08-29)
### Day 11, 6pm

A few hours have been spent making arrows, helping with healing or making healing potions (which Thorin completes) and so-on. A difficult, yet inspiring time.

Combat with a black dragon awaits us in the marshes beyond.

### ...Meanwhile, Arturo

2-3 days ago, Arturo helped us escape the lich and sneaked back to Neverwinter to research destroying the phylactory. Investigation 18, he manages to get hold of a contact known from back in the fey wild - but the answer is, as always, something of a riddle...

* Giants are involved, somehow!
* "How do you know that they're trying to kill you?" (The lich trying to kill us, that is)
* Destroying it requires equal force in magic to that which created it, so understanding its magical creation can help. The giants know a lot about that kind of thing, or Candlekeep.
* He's granted a boon from his fey contacts - a fey horse, that can ride through the night.

After a couple of days, Arturo starts to get a growing sense of unease - a feeling that something bad might happen; to him, or to the party, he's not sure; down South. He listens to his instincts. 

### Day 11, 7pm

Arturo crests a ridge and sees Helm's Hold. Even from this distance, he's surprised to see a huge funeral pyre burning outside the walls - unbeknownst to him, it's the collected now-dead undead being burned for cleanliness.

The rest of us are hanging out in the courtyard and we hear a ruckus from the wall - "Someone's approaching! A horse, a horse!" - Penny is worried it's another attack finds a way onto the wall to try and see what's going on.

"It's after sundown! State your business!" shout guards. A voice muffled from below sounds kind of familiar... "Ah! The heroes of the siege! Open the gates!" - so Penny figures it must be someone we know - and riding in through the gates, into the courtyard, is Arturo. He jumps down off his horse - which promptly explodes into a cloud of butterflies that fly off, to everyone's surprise!

"So much easier than finding parking!" says Arturo. "I've made such great discoveries!" he says and launches into it as Penny calls Francesc over. We all head to the tavern. Thorin comes down, sees Arturo and just says "What are we drinking?"

We catch up on liches and amulets. Talk turns to the dragon. There's the issue of self-protection; can we afford new potions of acid resistance? Nope! Maybe healing, if any's left. We're talking about this openly... Perception all-round meanwhile:

* Penny 22
* Thorin 21
* Francesc 12
* Arturo 7

Penny notices someone unfamiliar, not seen before in the tavern but is being treated like a local, who's trying not to be noticed - eavesdropping (Penny's perception matches his stealth DC). It looks like he's thinking about saying something.

Penny turns and says, "Join us for a drink, friend?" He answers - "Well... Why not! It's probably good to drink with a friend before you die." He walks over - "I couldn't help but overhear you're thinking of attacking a dragon. Is this some holy mission that you've been tasked with? Are you under some kind of compulsion? What is this death wish you have?!" "No compulsion, but we are serious." "What special skills do you have for dealing with dragons? Any special equipment?"

* Penny persuasion 21
* Francesc insight 8

Penny sees he's still not truly saying what he thinks. She coaxes it out. "You're not the first people to have tried tackling the dragon. But of the people I know, only one has ever returned with their life..." "And who is that?" "He lives up in the hills - in the foothills of the mountain, not in town. People think he went a bit crazy after that. I'd just hate for to happen to you." "So would we! Any tips?" "I don't know. I mean... How good are you at talking to difficult people? He's the only person who might have first-hand accounts of encountering this dragon?" Penny shrugs, "Well, I don't know *how* difficult he is - but *we're* taking..."

Arturo chips in. "Yeah - where's the guy?!" "Theres's a path leading up from behind the temple. It goes up along a rock ledge and along the leeward side at the base of the mountain. There's a grotto there. Used to be a mining access tunnel. He's decided to set up there. Some of the older folk do still care for him and even bring parcels of food but he doesn't come to down. His name is **Durum**." The man raises his glass. "Hopefully a different story for you!" - we match the toast. He downs it and bids us goodnight.

"We should bring him food!" says Francesc. "Is it too late? It's dark" says Penny. "He might like that!" says Francesc. Well, it might be dangerous, but compared to a black dragon? And it's dinner time.

Thorin pays for some food - our total for everything is still only 4sp. The people at the bar know of Durum and give us what they think he likes. They say, "When you're up there, could you bring the empty bottles back?"

We head out. Arturo casts Light on the top of his head! "I'm a beacon" "That's one word for it..."

Soon we're going along the ledge path. It's not hard to find but a bit precarious; we take care. Soon we see - well it doesn't look like a grotto. It's definitely a tunnel entrance with what used to be stone arch, with some stones now fallen. Former mining, very identifiable to Thorin. It's dark inside but there's a bit of air moving from within. Penny calls, "Hello, Durum, we've got some food!"

Nothing for a moment, but then banging! Then a soft glow starts to move from within the tunnel towards the entrance. A candle, in a candleholder, we see as it gets closer, held by a 40-something unkempt man. He wears leather armour, and peers out over the candle. "What are you? Are you angel? You're so bright!" Penny's moment of ego is destroyed as she realises he means Arturo. Arturo drops Light as it's much brighter than the candle, and easier for everyone to see.

"Thank you for dinner. Usually people just leave it at the entrance." "Our pleasure - we thought we'd have a chat" answers Penny.

He looks a bit nervous and pushes some things to the side of the wall; kind of a lot of trash around; "I don't have anywhere for you to sit..." "Floor's good" says Francesc, but he says, "Um, I wouldn't sit on the floor if I were you..." - things don't smell great, and we don't ask questions. We hand over the food.

We ask if it's OK to take the bottles back as the tavern asked for them. "Oh! Yes! Yes..." - he starts to hand a few, some not quite empty - not sure with what! - and he pours them out. We collect a few. Everyone looks at Penny, so Penny puts them in her backpack... "You're immune to disease, right?" whispers Arturo.

Penny says, "I did want to chat about something that might be distressing. We're - well, there's no easy way to say it - we're planning on attacking the dragon tomorrow."

Colour drains from his face. "No... Don't do that. Don't do that! It - it - it cannot die. It is death itself! It is walking death." He has a glazed look.

Penny and Arturo both get persuasion 17 independently, trying to convince him to talk more. It takes a while, but then he looks like he's recalling things. And he recounts the tale.

* He wasn't the only one - there were five of them. They'd heard of treasure there. They knew there was a new dragon inhabiting the lair, which they think means the old one died. Not that long ago - a year, maybe year and a half. The dragon had only just arrived.
* They thought they'd sneak in and plunder the hoard when the dragon was away but got it wrong. He tells us about the way in, an old roadhouse, with stables there's a trap door with a series of tunnels opening up into a larger set which head to an old cavern complex, probably inhabited by another kingdom some time? Lots of statues, some tunnels very architecturally designed.
* They found the hoard and started loading things but then one realised it was just bones they were loading. It was an illusion. Hovering above, clinging to the ceiling, was the dragon; acid dripping down, which maimed and killed one party member quickly.
* The dragon just dropped down and attacked. Its acid breath was devastating, killing another. It has one clear and one cloudy eye, but they think it didn't even seem to need the eyes to sense where they were - it was pitch dark inside. They don't know how long it was waiting, or whether it is just always there.
* It seemed cruel. It chased them around tunnels; they'd run, thinking they'd escaped but not knowing the connections, it would appear and try to herd them back into the main chamber. A third party member was lost to fear - just ran into a poisonous cloud of something and expired.
* He ran; never saw the fate of the fourth and carries shame and guilt; "I never even got to use this sword I have, that was supposed to kill the dragon!"

Charisma -1 Francesc promptly says, "Tell me more about the sword!" "It was something we plundered from a very old barrow near the coast, that belonged to an old Knight Queen; it had carvings of dragons all over." He thinks it's the only reason he managed to escape; perhaps the dragon kept clear. But it's the only thing he has left to remember his friends by.

Thorin considers asking if he'd go back with us - 15 perception. He senses that this guy might *once* have had his wits about him, but now would be a total liability.

Arturo says, "You seem trapped in this horible thing that happened. Living with this constant reminder of what happened isn't good for you... Perhaps, give -" and Francesc speaks over him, "*lend*" "-us the sword?" finishes Arturo. He maybe needs another reason. Arturo thinks that the sword might let someone get close to the dragon; betray it, perhaps, by fooling it; then killing it with the sword.

He says he'll lend it to us if we kill the dragon *with* the sword. And he wants a memento - it's good eye. We'd be happy to!

He hobbles back into the tunnel a bit then pulls out a beautiful sword. It has dragon wings for its cross-guard and a coiling serpentine hilt, etched in silver. It's in a leather scabbard, threaded-through with silver carvings and runes. Old Elvish, Francesc and Penny note - "laying down the wyrms of darkness", or words to that effect. Whoever made this sword definitely intended it to kill dragons.

As he offers it, he says, "I want this back! I need something in exchange..."

We realise that only Penny can wield this heavy weapon. Penny offers her +1 sword in return. He raises the sword up in a salute; he was in some knightly order; he must've fallen far. There's not much we can do except try to kill this dragon.

Francesc con save 15, DC16, finds herself struggling with the smell in here and wanders out. Penny returns the salute with her sword, then swaps and says, "We will see you again soon I hope, with trophies. And then the past can stay in the past."

We head back to town.

We head back to the tavern. Thorin and Francesc make a good argument for it! We return the bottles - one of which smells very suspicious - Penny sniffs her backpack; going to need a cleaning stone... A free round of drinks, then we crash.

We set up watch. Arturo (7) falls asleep - well, he'd been riding all day. Otherwise, the watches go fine.



### Day 12, 7am

We head downstairs for breakfast before our fight. The tavern keep know what we're doing today... And more and more people come in for breakfast too. But most of them just sort of sit around. Some 20 or so. We go to pay, but then the townsfolk stop us paying. "Your headed out today to find the dragon, rumour has it?" "Yes!" Outside, another dozen or so who couldn't fit inside are crowded there, milling around and walking with us. More and more join the procession as we head towards the gate.

It's touching but also a lot of pressure!

At the gates are the old priest and the younger female one we'd seen with him. They open the gates for us. One of the townsfolk comes up to Francesc and puts a flower garland necklace around her. Some start muttering blessings and the priest even leads a short prayer, asking Helm, as the watcher, to look after us, as we looked after the town. "May he spread his protective shield over you."

(We all gain a one-off use of a D4 for any roll).

We walk out, watched from the gate by a crowd of townsfolk. As we get out of earshot, Penny says, "Now the most important thing we can do today, is not die..." - 4 temp HP all round.

Realising none of us can speak frog today, but Thorin had spoken the night before. The frog can't shield us from dragon minions; the dragon has many. Lizards, snakes, scorpions, crocodiles, lizardfolk and more. The frog indicated about 2.5 hours from the marsh edge to the roadhouse. We figure we're probably not getting in undetected, but we might be able to sneak around *inside* maybe. The dragon will know we're there but not necessarily where. We can at least try casting PWAT 15 minutes ish out, maybe.

And so, in we go. Deeper and deeper into the swap. There seem to be old road markings at one point, but submerged. The frog, pointing the way with front feet, knows its stuff! The terrain should be very difficult but it knows dry paths (even though they don't look dry).

We reach trees growing over ruins. We're about half an hour from the roadhouse. Thorin casts PWAT - swamp gas seems to obscure us from view and the swamp immediately hides our footsteps behind. Francesc, history check; only 3+5->8! She knows the ruins must be significant but can't place it; Penny 17-1->16, it's an old early human civilisation; odd that it's in the middle of a swamp but probably predates the Mere of Dead Men stretching this far. Several hundred years old.

Last approach to roadhouse - stealth (with +10 for PWAT):

* Francesc 24
* Arturo 35
* Thorin 19
* Penny nat 1 - 1 + 10! Penny stumbles in her armour with a very splash and slapping of a twig; Arturo makes an illusion of a bunch of frogs scattering around to try and cover it.

The roadhouse used to be surrounded by walls but they've crumbled. Two storeys, the upper partly collapsed. That plus stables line a courtyard; we have to step over a collapsed door in the wall to enter. Francesc perception 16; she notices movement in there. It doesn't look like animals. It looks humanoid.

"There's something in there that looks humanoid."

Arturo wants to sneak up and check it out, while Francesc readies her bow. Arturo perception: 8. He sneaks around the crumbling wall on soggy ground but it's dark inside. He returns and swaps; dark vision is needed. Francesc perception 12; she sees a skeleton shambling around inside, slowly. After thinking a while, she thinks she'll take it! She fires. She hits, slugs included; 18 damage. It drops! It scatters into a pile of bones - as another one shambles over to investigate... Francesc tries again with her second attack (no slugs). 18 to hit -> hits, 11 damage; it's injured but up. Arturo looks around and tries Firebolt. 24 to hit; 13 damage; that does it! It burns into ash.

We wait... Nothing else.

Beeline for stables, or at least the building where the skeletons were. There's writing above the door in what Thorin recognises as a form of Dwarven script - "Horses" - OK, that's it! There's a big, askew trap door that's hard to miss.

Penny helps Francesc check for traps; perception 16; no traps - but it is in frequent use. There are wet, three-toed clawed footprints. "Lizard people!" says Francesc.

Thorin has darkvision and is quite hardy; he says he'll go first. There's no ladder; he jumps down into the space. It's a cellar of sorts. There's a tunnel opening that looks like it's just been hacked roughly into the wall. The tunnel after looks like it has been dug by claws. While Thorin investigates, Arturo rigs up a rope to help us get back afterwards.

We all drop down.

Arturo, survival 14, can smell rankness in most areas, except directly in front; Thorin nat 20 + 8->28 perception, sees all kind of tunnels and a room to the right with all kinds of stuff dumped into it, as if a collection room. We figure if the Lizardfolk dumped that then the dank smelling stuff is from the swamp and the clean smell in one direction might be the lair - Lizardfolk might be smart enough to keep very clear of it, due to the dragon. Penny Perception only 10, the cleaner air is to the right & forward; Francesc, Perception 21, same result. We head that way.

We reach a point where fresh air seems to come from *two* directions, but Francesc (perception 21) hears scraping footsteps coming from the right-hand of the two tunnels. We hide towards the left, clear of the "fresh air" tunnel that we followed. At this point - Thorin's nose goes wild. **He smells gold**.

It's a pool with what *looks like* a small hoard! Stealth all-round:

* Francesc 21
* Arturo 19
* Thorin 14
* Penny 13

...and despite these lower rolls, we see a Lizardfolk person walking down the tunnel but it doesn't see us. Penny meanwhile looks at the ceiling in the hoard room; despite perception only 11, she realises that the ceiling itself is only about 15ft up. This is a small room - it would need to be a very tiny dragon to hide inside there!

Arturo can't really see where the Lizardfolk character is going; but Francesc perception 16 spots two others behind. They appear to be patrolling. Arturo speaks Draconic and hears a voice saying, "...says they're around this level! We need to find them..." - seems like they're looking for us. He whispers the warning.

We figure we have to attack! Initiative:

* Francesc 16
* Arturo 16
* Penny 15
* Thorin 13

Francesc steps out to get a clearer view and aims for the middle of the Lizardfolk; 29 - of course this hits! Hunter's Mark is on, slugs too. Total damage from all that is 20. It looks very injured but is still up. Second attack lower; 17; but this also hits for 13 damage, 33 total. It falls. The one behind reacts immediately in horror and reaches for its weapon. The one in front saw two arrows, reaching for its weapon - but then we hear a voice say something (Arturo hears; "They must be around here! Attack!" and a reply, "No we've been attacked!") - yet we can only see 2 Lizardfolk left and neither spoke. There must be two more.

Arturo thinks he has no choice, especially with the darkness and knowing there seem to be 2 others we can't see - he throws a fireball, centred roughly on the one he *can* (just about) see at the back. D20 wild magic, no surge. DC16 dex save with per-entity max potential damage 8d6->32. Both the remaining visible Lizardfolk fall. We can't see the two others - one falls, but another dodges on the very fringe; 16 points taken. **112 points damage** total! The fireball is a strange bright green, with wispy edges that almost look like green fire tendrils that reach for the creatures. We hear a shriek of pain from the unseen Lizardfolk. Arturo then hides!

Penny runs forward as far as she can and throws two javelins. There's some lingering green flame that provides *just* enough light to see. Both javelins hit but both do minimum possible damage; 1d6+3->1+3->4, and same again; 8 points only. That's not enough. Thorin tries something similar but he's a bit slower and can't make it far enough to see around a corner... He shouts to Penny to, with her reaction, try and angle her shield to do a trick shot and bounce magic stones off her shield! Thorin rolls a high 25 to hit - *clang!* - the stone bounces at (the unbeknownst to us, Shaman) Lizardfolk and does 7 damage. The creature drops! Penny hoarsely whispers "that did it!" - we are surrounded by five bodies. Penny retrieves the javelins.

We investigate the bodies quickly. They wear shells and bones as armour! Clavicles and more; shields are made of hip bones. They're big - larger than human. Grisly but apparently quite effective. Arturo tries to figure out what they might have been; nature -> 8 - some kind of animal! (He tells the party that we should probably move quickly now as surely, everything down here knows we're in the caves).

We can see clearly where they came from. The scorched earth and signs of battle are obvious; hiding is pointless; we just run, heading in the direction from which our assailants came.

This takes us downwards... Deeper...

Penny survival 22 - clouds of unnatural putrid air; she warns people that this is probably the noxious gas we heard about, or something similar; Arturo tries a lit torch and finds the gas extinguishes it. Part of the torch lands in a puddle and melts! So we have to avoid wet walls and wet patches on the floor - they're acid. We can hold torches out and detect gas clouds by watching them be extinguished. Francesc perception 18, Thorin arcana 18; he realises that the effects we're seeing are magical, not natural. A strong, resident presence of something very magical. **We must be within the area of the dragon's lair** - the region it can influence.

Weapons drawn and a torch held out by Francesc at the front, we proceed down stairs. Low corridors open out into large caverns. A series of very confusing tunnels; a larger cavern; there are slithering and echoing noises; scratching; then a strange echoing moaning... Up ahead, a small shaft of light coming through from some kind of crack ahead, illuminating a much larger main chamber. And in the middle, a *massive* pile of gold. This is pretty much what Durum described. Penny with her sword is gesturing up towards the ceiling inside.

Then there's a voice, echoing in the corridors and caverns - Draconic - "Why have you come here to die today? What special significance does this day have for you, that you would wish to perish, mortals?" Arturo says in Draconic in response, "We had a very nice breakfast today!" - a strange echoing life. "Yes, I haven't eaten yet either... Looks like I too will have a delicious breakfast. *But* - maybe something more fun. You are not like the others. What do you want?" - Arturo translates it. But then the dragon speaks in Common - louder - "What *do* the four of you want? What is your heart's desire?" "I've always wanted to kill a dragon" says Francesc; Penny answers "Yeah, and take it's good eye!"

Francesc can see the roof of the illusion chamber now but can't see any dragon. Perhaps it's invisible. She fires a flaming arrow up at the roof to see what happens; Arturo fires a volley of Firebolt up too.

The arrow heads up, hits the ceiling, bounces and falls; hits nothing. Similar story with the Firebolt. A voice VERY close to us on our left says, "Clever! This is going to be fun!" and we hear clattering of claws, as if from all directions.

Penny goes for it - a full dash into the illusion room, up against a wall. Arturo heads closer, on the other side of the room; Thorin jumps right into the edge of the false hoard! He sees immediately that he's stood at the edge of a pile of humanoid skulls and bones.

Scratching noises from the corridors again. All different directions. Penny shouts, "Steady, it's just trying to play with us!"

A voice seems to solidify in a corridor across from Penny, far over that side. "Let's make a deal. I don't think you want to die today! I don't sense that overwhelming desire in you... I can usually smell when someone desperately wants death; and none of you have that scent. So, maybe, you can do something for *me*." - during the speech Arturo tries to stealthily creep around in that direction while Francesc, intelligence-based perception, tries to figure out the true location - *23*, great roll - a very quiet noise coming from the other side of the rock wall behind Penny, the very opposite direction from the voice. It's a trick; the dragon is far away from where it thinks it is.

"Tick tock, tick tock. I'm getting bored..." it says.

Francesc moves forward a bit; tries Faerie Fire - 60ft range, 20ft cube. If it works it'll be great, but the DC is only Dex 14. The dragon rolls a nat 5+6->fails!

Lit by a violet halo, the dragon. It laughs! "Ha! Right! You *are* going to be more fun. I am glad. So much better than all the other boring cogs that wander in here, looking to rob me!"

Penny shouts, "We don't want to rob you. We thought you might be interested in looking at this sword..." - "A sword? A magical sword? I'm always looking to add more to my collection! So here's the deal. I need tributes! I am **nearly there**!" - there's a slightly crazed tone to the voice; it's obsessed with collecting value, it seems. Just a few more, as if something very important might happen at some threshold of collected amount.

The dragon starts to crawl around and emerges at the head of the chamber. "Might as well introduce myself! I have taken an old name. You can call me Klaugmyathar."

Francesc history 23; a shiver down the spine... There was a very vicious, terrible old green dragon that used to live in the Misty Forest that terrorised people there, but was killed a couple of years ago. It had a very similar name... That cannot be a coincidence. An old dragon's name, a different old dragon's lair; it's trying to establish itself. The creature has a commanding presence. It's very large; but only *nearly* full adult size.

Francesc stops thinking. She pushes up against a wall, trying to keep out of line of Thorin and Arturo; **then she stops waiting and fires!**.

Sleight of hand check - nat 20! Klaugmyathar doesn't notice her setting up the arrow. It's a surprise shot. Flaming arrows, slugs, favoured foe, advantage on the attacks as long as the Faerie Fire is up - it just gets a hit for a solid *22 damage*. As it hits, the illusion in the room is dropped. The gold is gone.

Initiative!

* Francesc 23
* Arturo 15
* Thorin 15
* Penny 14

A strange, misty shape unfurls around a bunch of bones that then rise up - some of them are skeletons. At least 3 undead.

A new attack round. Francesc shouts to nearby Arturo, "fireball those!" pointing at the skeletons, then fires at Klaugmyathar again. 20, hits, another 22 damage. Fires again, 26, hits, 24 damage. Then she runs for cover behind rocks not far from Arturo.

A skeleton moves to attack Penny. Hits; 5 damage.

Emerging at a run from a side tunnel - another Lizardfolk.

Arturo's up. His second fireball, just one left. No wild magic surge. Rerolls 4 of the dice, for 18 + reroll -> 16 -> 34 total; DC 16 dex save. The dragon *just* fails the dex save and takes full damage! His eyes flare with a dark purple angry glow (including the cloudy white eye). Two skeletons drop, one still up; it looks more powerful somehow, has a bit of flesh on the bones and did take a lot of damage but didn't fall. That one's certainly different! The recently-arrived Lizardfolk takes full damage too and is killed. A whopping **153 damage** overall! Arturo repositions to try and avoid lines of fire from the dragon's acid breath.

At this point, a little later than we expected, the dragon acts. A cloud of infected air fills the space around Thorin and Penny. It's a DC14 con save against disease - but Penny is immune. She can feel the pull of it and the stench, but isn't harmed. Thorin saves and only takes 5 poison damage, but is resistant to that, so only takes 2 overall.

Thorin acts. He moves sideways to get out of the cloud, away from Penny; he wants a good line of sight on the dragon. He casts Tidal Wave, trying to get both the remaining undead and dragon in a left-right sweep. Penny sees all the wet air suddenly coalescing into a wave that crashes down onto the undead and dragon. DC16 dex save - both fail! 4d8 and knocked prone; the dragon's too big for that but the 22 damage still affects it. The skeleton is taken down. Klaugmyathar's getting a bit beaten up. The bad air cloud is washed away too!

Thorin then Wildshapes, taking the form of a bear.

The dragon acts again. It spreads its wings and lifts off. Fortunately the cavern roof limits its height; barely 5ft off the ground; but there's suddenly a psychic wave, a whispering voice from every corner of the cavern. "You had the chance of a lifetime, to play and to gain favour! You have chosen very poorly - unfortunately, you have mere seconds to realise your folly before you *die*."

Wisdom saving throws against Fear, DC unknown.

* Penny 20+5->25. 
* Francesc 18
* Thorin 19
* Arturo with Tides Of Chaos 17

It's enough. We're not afraid... But it's not finished. It flies over towards Thorin - so after all the waiting, Penny is now too far away to do anything - and throws acid breath in a line at Thorin and Arturo. Dex saves. Inspiration burned for Thorin, but still is only 10; 17 with Arturo using his D4 Bless from the townsfolk.

27 damage for Arturo, leaving 10. A full 55 damage for Thorin; Absorb Elements is no use because in Bear form he can't cast any spells. His bear form drops only a few seconds after he took it and he ends up with 21 damage rolling over, leaving 31. Thorin can't possibly hold his spell - the flaming arrows drop.

Finally the dragon tries to bite Thorin but misses. Penny has to full dash, the dragon just outside her 30ft range; DM fiat - offers that she can sacrifice an attack to try a jump with an athl check, but if she fails to hit she'll fall and be prone. Athl 13 is *just* enough; Branding Smite cast; Penny tries her attack with Faerie Fire advantage - 22 to hit; that does it! 1d8+3 + 3d6 for dragon sword + 2d6 for Branding plus L2 Divine Smite 3d8. The total damage is 36, a great deal of that Radiant. Klaugmyathar look quite messed up.

The dragon uses a legendary action to use a wing attack. Penny and Thorin need dex saves. Thorin 22. Penny 13 + townsfolk D4->3, 16 total. She does OK! Not knocked prone, no damage, but she's now hoisted into the air, hanging *by the sword* as it tries to fly away... Scraping across the top of the cavern, it's maybe 15ft off the ground.

Arturo hears it almost arguing with itself! Schizophrenic stuff. Gollum-esque, to-and fro, agitated, worried... Crazed.

Three Lizardfolk run in, having rolled very low initiative (we're still on round 1 of combat!). One throws a spear at Penny. It just hits - 5 damage - but she still hangs on. The other two only have time to run into the room.

Round two! Francesc. Sharpshooter can take an attack penalty of -5 for +10 damage, with advantage of Faerie Fire; 21 to hit - that does it! Slugs, favoured foe, 25 damage.

The arrow pierces straight through its throat. A big explosion of blood and acid sprays out; the dragon nosedives into the ground with a thump, its eyeball pops out and rolls to Francesc's feet; Penny dex save, nat 1-1 -> 0, burn Inspiration, also nat 1-1 -> 0 (!), so 3d6->fortunately only 6 damage. A very messy, very dead dragon pins her down. At least the acid from the destroyed throat pouch from the throat didn't hit her!

Francesc tries to hit another Lizardfolk with the second attack, but misses. Can't win 'em all.

Arturo moves up and starts shouting "We Killed Your God!" at the Lizardfolk in an intimidating way; intimidation check with advantage, only 16; insight on their part means two of them back down but a third is enraged - "No! You must pay!" - to which Arturo responds with Firebolt, hitting for 13 damage. At this, it backs down; all three flee. He hears them arguing in Draconic as they retreat; "We must go to the shaman!" "No, but that means we're free! We're free to live our lives" says another. Arturo calls after them; he name-drops Krstjan, speaking in Draconic, advising them to seek his advice.

Maybe they will, maybe they won't.

Sudden CHA or WIS saves all-round, Penny CHA only 10, Arturo CHA 14, Francesc WIS 17, Thorin WIS 15. Only Francesc succeeds.

Francesc, having struck the killing blow, can feel a wave of almost psychic disturbance spread out from the dragon. It's like a fragmenting of reality. She steels herself against it - the dragon has very unusual death throes. Penny on the other hand is at ground zero, trapped under the beast. She feels a personality kind of fracturing; the schizophrenic, multi-voice feeling as if the dragon was made up of a number of echoes of different souls. Different versions of the same dragon. In her mind, she sees pictures of a huge battle involving a large volcano and many dragons; a portal opened; other versions of dragons from different times and planes leaked through. This dragon lost its eye there and, it seems, in its youth, was badly affected by that strange portal effect.

Thorin - hears the dragon think it will be able to become more powerful; it will get more legendary! - it recognised it needed more wealth to become the most powerful version of itself. That's why it wanted to expand its hoard and was so obsessed with being *almost* at the threshold it believed it needed.

In Francesc's mind, she see pictures of its hoard. It's not on this level... Hidden. We must find how to get to it.

A muffled voice from under Klaugmyathar shouts, "Can someone get me *the fuck* out of here?" - so Francesc helps Penny, picking up the eye along the way! Penny tries to cut off the whole head... It takes a few hacks, but it's doable. Penny ropes it onto her backpack but is heavily overloaded by that.

It takes a while to find the hoard, but it's really just a matter of being methodical.
