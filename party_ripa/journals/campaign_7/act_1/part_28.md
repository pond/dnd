# RIPA: Part 28
## Session 28 (2024-01-23)
### Day 28, Underdark, drow tower

Having literally fallen into the Underdark, we've not done a good job of trying to understand Drow or convince them to help us in any way and, given that it seems they are minded to kill us, we try have the first word on that. Penny has drawn and activated her Sun Blade.

Initiative:

* Francesc 27
* Arturo 21
* Thorin 20
* Penny 18

Francesc grabs the bow and shoots - aiming for the face as usual. But in the hurry - and the glare from the Sun Blade! - the arrow goes wide. The next arrow finds its target; 12 damage (across his ear). She kicks the trap door closed.

Arturo runs to the trapdoor and positions the imoveable rod over the opening side of the hatch, then runs back to his starting position with the bulk of the party between him and the drow.

Thorin summons L4 Summon Beast; a small land beast spirit appears. He tells it to attack, then wildshapes into a Dire Wolf. The spirit attacks; one attack hits, doing 10 damage.

There are skittering sounds... Then bursting in through a window at ceiling height appears a fiendish giant wolf spider. It drops down to the floor and moves to bite Arturo. It succeeds, for 7 damage, but he shrugs off its poison, though does take an additional 4 damage from it. It moves between Penny, Francesc and Arturo. Almost at the same time, there are running sounds then thuds against the trap door, which starts banging against the imoveable rod. Then there is the sound of the people running back down the stairs.

Penny focuses on the Big Bad; she casts Branding Smite and swings at the drow twice. 22 to hit; it tries to block her, but she slices through it with the sun blade. Even with a divine smite on top, it's only 17 damage (3d8+2d6+5, 41 max). The second hits with another smite but, again, damage rolls are low - 16 damage.

Levitating up to a window across from the spider appears another Drow, one from downstairs. We're about 25ft off the ground, so they're quite high up - another spider crashes in at the same time, attacking the dire wolf with its bite, matching the AC to hit; 5 piercing, 8 potential poison but the dire wolf has advantage on the con save, +4 from Penny, and poison resistance; it makes the save, taking only 2 damage.

Now, at last, the drow Captain acts. It hates the light from the sun blade, so it casts Darkness in a 15ft radius around itself. That pretty much fills the room - we're all now unable to see, even those with Darkvision, *except* Penny with her limited range Blindsight. In Undercommon, it tells the spider to "take out the soft, squishy ones!" (and Penny shouts out a warning). Faced with a range of targets, the Captain swings at Thorin's beast spirit and hits; it does 10 slashing damage and 13 poison damage (but no CON saves or similar).

*Another* spider enters the room - not that we can see it - and in fact the drow Captain had been speaking to *that* one, which is coming in the same window as the first; it goes for Arturo, biting for 5 piercing. CON save 14; that's enough; so, only 4 poison damage. He uses his gem dragon reprisal as a reaction; the spider is hurt by the blast and, further, pushed backwards though Arturo can't see where - in fact it's thrown out of the window and lands 25ft below with a heavy thud/splat; we're pretty sure it's dead!

Francesc can't see a thing. Arcana 16; she knows Darkness has a 15ft radius, so she follows the wall around in the direction that gets as far away as she can from the Captain. Unfortunately the giant spider next to her which she couldn't see crits with an opportunity attack, for a fortunately-low 5 piercing damage and potentially a very high 19 poison damage. At the point of leaving the spider's threatened area she's not in Penny's aura, CON 11 is *just enough* to fortunately save against the worst of the poison to take only 9 damage.

So, she can see - a great mass of blackness. She's *just* able to get far enough around to see the mage drow that was floating at the window. This being an underground tower with no risk of rain, it has shutters but no glass, so she's free to fire at it; 13 to hit misses; 19 to hit works - 17 damage. Caught entirely by surprise, the drow looks quite injured, but does *not* lose concentration on its fly spell.

Arturo heard the nearby spider attack Francesc, so he knows it'll be a moment before it's gathered itself to attack again; but he doesn't want to move, instead throwing a panic fireball into the room! He's trying to get it towards the mage in the window, because he figures it'll also catch the Drow captain and possibly cause Darkness to fail. It will probably catch Thorin and the spirit, along with maybe Francesc and Penny, but you can't make an omlette without breaking a few eggs... (via markings on game map and a D20 roll where 20 was best outcome & 20 was rolled!) ..."only" Thorin is caught of the allies!

Turns out a fireball in a small stone tower room is LOUD.

Thanks to metamagic, Arturo is able to see the fireball as it forms and modify it to bolster its power during the detonation. 38 potential damage, on a DC 16 DEX save. Thorin's dire wolf form dodges the worst, taking 19 damage. The captain, mage and a giant spider are hit; the spider is incinerated, but the mage and captain both make their save (19 damage each). Francesc sees the mage outside is seriously injured, badly burned, clothes on fire, but somehow holds onto its flying spell. It's in truth a grisly sight. Annoyingly, the Captain holds Darkness as well.

Thorin has held onto his dire wolf form, just. Flanking advantage cancels the darkness disadvantage for the captain, so Thorin attacks, but - 12 - can't get in a hit. The spirit wolf tries its luck too, getting two solid hits - 12, 10 damage. The Captain still holds its spell.

Penny senses shallow, ragged breathing from the captain; he's in bad shape. Behind her, the spider attacks Arturo again; 4 piercing, poision saved, 3 damage taken. Once again he tries his reprisal; DC 16 STR save; spider fails the save, taking 13 damage; a giant dead spider flops wetly against Penny and drops to the floor.

Luck dice -> D20 -> 3. Arturo feels a cold blade sink into him, pull out, then sink into him again. Some unseen assassin has crept in the nearby window; 10 piercing, 9 poison; 7 piercing, 10 poision - he's down (on the second blade, before the poison even comes in). Penny doesn't know why, but just sees Arturo collapse (saying, "oh fuck") as she wipes spider innards off her face.

She figures Arturo has a moment or two of holding on while she could heal him, and the Captain is *almost* down. So, she attacks; another L2 Branding Smite, first attack 1,10->18 - just hits; even with a parry. Total damage 25. The Darkness falls, but the Captain is still up; one more hit; 3,5->13 => miss. And *now* we see another drow, standing over Arturo by the window.

The mage (oh yeah, the mage is still up!) levels his staff and spits out an Elven curse of some kind. Penny DEX nat 20 plus mods, Thorin only 8 with all mods. Penny takes *17* lightning damage, and Thorin's wolf form takes 34 - he falls back to his dwarf form, 23 damage carrying over. The beast spirit is taken down too.

The captain has disadvantage in attack because of the sun blade, so turns around with Penny behind and goes for Thorin instead, hitting for 7 + 14->7 poision. Thorin reacts with Gift of the Gem dragon, but the Captain makes the save; he does at least take 2d8->9->4 damage. Realising that the poison isn't working, he turns back and swings rather blindly at Penny, but that does hit; 8 + 17 poision. Penny only has 18hp left.

Francesc keeps going with the mage. She hits (28!) for 10 damage. That's enough; it falls - as it does, Francesc sees that it'd reached into its robe and pulled out a scroll of some sort, but never gets a chance to read it. Perception 10 - she can't see what it says. Thorin's closer; perception 26; "Summon Demon"! Francesc has time to fire again, this time going for the Captain; 19, hits, 12 damage. She throws L2 Ensnaring Strike on top; 6 more damage; STR 14 save, which he makes.

Arturo death save: 17, success!

Thorin isn't sure how close to death the Captain might be (medicine 11); ends up going for Moonbeam, bringing it down on top of the Captain. Potential 3d10->max 30 damage! He wildshapes into a giant boar.

The warrior that had attacked Arturo sees Francesc take down the mage, and now threatens the Captain with ranged weapons, so runs up to melee range to harry her and attacks with a dark steel shortsword. He's beyond even the brightest range of Penny's sword (and she'd dialled it down one step at the very start to avoid blinding her own party!) but despite that - both of its attacks miss!

Penny *must* take down the Captain. She hits (26) for 19 damage, with a smite; it goes down. Off with its head! She recovers a spell slot. She can't risk getting into melee with the new arrival as she can't risk a hit from an opportunity attack, so instead runs over to Arturo shouting, "Thorin, help Francesc!"

Francesc drops her bow and pulls out a sword; 23 to hit; a new favoured foe casting; slugs etc.; 15 damage. Next hits too; 8 damage.

Arturo death save: fail.

Thorin-boar runs to flank the bad guy (there's a table in the way which prevents a charge) and tries a tusk attack, but the drow parries (using its reaction). The warrior ignores it, swinging at Francesc but missing the first time (she dodges); it does hit the second time. 6 piercing, 13 poison.

Penny finally manages to heal Arturo for 15 from the hands-on pool. He's up! Seeing the warrior briefly distracted by parrying Thorin-boar's tusk attack, she is able to drop her sword, grab her bow and withdraw to firing range. She puts Hunter's Markk on it - it looks pretty healthy! - and fires, 19 to hit, hits since it parried the tusk attack and can't then parry her so soon after; 21 damage. Second arrow - 29 very much hits (temporarily forgetting Sharpshooter -5/+10) - 14 damage this time.

Arturo is up, assess the situation, runs up to put the table between him and the drow - then uses Burning Hands, but avoids Thorin in the cone. DEX 16 save. It makes the save; effective damage is 10. Not *quite* enough!

Thorin moves the moonbeam above the drow; potential damage, 3d10->26, another very high roll. The drow acts next and makes a save, taking 13 damage. He's destroyed!

Penny says, "I don't think we want to fight our way out of here and I don't think we can climb out of that hole either. We should teleport."

We quickly examine the room. During that, Thorin drops in Healing Spirit to help us all heal up. Penny empties the hands-on pool in addition, with another 10 to Arturo and Francesc.

Francesc grabs the scroll. Arturo rolls 8d6 by DM request, of which 3 die are 1s or 2s (this means the fireball damaged 3 of the 8 flammable items in the room; one is fully burned, two are charred). Thorin, 25 investigation; Arturo 19. Perception Thorin 19, Penny 18.

* On the desk there's a scroll that's been destroyed
* There are two items that are damaged - one is some kind of **wooden cipher** that's charred and probably now very fragile, but looks usable; the other is a **leather-bound book**, the leather badly burned but the contents in good condition
* There's also an **undamaged letter** that's encoded which we could decode right away with the cipher
* There's a bracelet with **30 poisoned darts** (extra 1d6 poision per hit, no save) - Arturo is interested as it could be quite hidden
* A **dark steel scimitar** that seems to be some kind of infernal iron
* A large, beautiful, antique gold goblet, encrusted with gems; Thorin, expertise perception, 22; probably worth 1000gp overall, **almost a 1000gp bowl**
* A **bag of beans**! Thorin, arcana 16; 3d4->8 beans in the bag.

Penny investigation 13 to get a rough idea of what it is; it's written in a script of elven close enough to Undercommon. It's a kind of ledger. She reads a few pages and realises that the spiders were fiends; they were susceptible to fire and radiant damage in particular. There's a demon-worshopping cult of the drow in the area, which explains why the Captain kept banging on about the official drow religion so vehemently - a smoke screen! People are being taken from above for spell components for a ritual to try and release arcane bindings on fiends. They seem to have found some kind of - "Mouth of Hell" is the best translation! - from which they could summon forth demons.

**Could this be the source of the incursions we've been trying to understand?** Nah - those are too far away. *But* there is a mention towards the end that when they brought the most recent set of prisoners, they also brought down two massive tombstones covered in "foreign writing". So they've captured people from above and the stones. Penny's heart sinks - we probably can't leave here yet.

Arturo via arcane study uses Identify; the beans and bag are magical. The beans are full of arcane potnntial and very heavy! 1/4lb each. He realises that if a bean is removed, planted and watered, one minute later something will happen. Toadstools, a geyser, a Treant and so-on; many effects, with variations of each, some of which may be helpful (e.g. edible toadstools that boost your heath) or others less so (toadstools that poison you). It's also possible to dump the whole bag on the ground to cause an explosion rather like a small fireball. 

The cipher is very delicate. Arturo casts Mending and after a minute, it's not quite so fragile (DC 20 -> DC 15 for three SOH checks in a row to complete deciphering). Francesc is the most dextrous; Thorin can try to read the output (Penny is busy with the book). We don't have Guidance or similar, so Francesc just has to wing it!

* Francesc's first SOH roll is 5+5->10, and Arturo's Bend Luck can only add 4. DM freebie! Retry, dirty 20.
  - "Dear Clerist of the Lidded Eye..."
  - Not in Elven undercommon; a different script; these drow didn't write this and it wasn't meant for them

* Second SOH only 7, no salvaging. The cipher breaks.
  - We get very little, lots of gaps with words we just can't figure out
  - It's an interception; cells communicating with other cells - spies basically
  - They've been watching something called "V.S."
  - "She appears on the move"
  - Something about "Having the shard" (so that's Velindra Shadowmantle)
  - "Many forces have mobilised that have lain dormant for centuries"

This looks like some kind of powerplay thing. Velindra is making a risky move to switch allegiances from Thay; she's been a vassal of Thay, working on trying to secure a hidden power base for Thay in the Neverwinter woods. There's an old temple that she was trying to use into a portal. But she's decided to betray all that; the drow think she's been contacted by a "greater power" (and our understanding is that yes - she has indeed).

We don't know if the tablets being searched for are part of keeping up appearances for the power base for Thay, or part of her other plans. It's possible that the Drow are working against her. Perhaps someone else can decipher the rest given what they've got. **Francesc suggests taking it back to Mayastan.**

Francesc is looking at the cipher and realises there's a vial of poison inside - it was possible to be hurt or possibly even killed with a wrong move, so in a way, having it break without deploying the vial (thanks to the charring) might've been a funny kind of luck. We also find in a chest:

* 49pp
* 801gp
* 1009sp

Penny insight 18, Thorin 23 - both realise that this is a watch tower. There are likely to be patrols that come past this way. There's even a roster - we have around 10 hours until the next patrol. We don't want them looking for us, so we figure we might have to come up with something to incriminate the Drow captain. We've got a reasonable amount from the joural, so Penny leaves it open, on the page, on the captain's body. For good measure, Francesc uses a fiend spider leg to hold the page open from the one that got squished against Penny by Arturo's gem dragon reprisal.

We decide to risk a long rest, right here. The immoveable rod is on the trapdoor and we can barricade the shutters with bits of wood from furniture.

Watch is set up. Perception:

* Arturo: 18. Skittering sounds; various giant insects moving around, nothing trying to get in.
* Thorin: 15. Almost eerily silent.
* Francesc: 23. Almost gets a scare, figures moving along a wall opposite but they don't look towards her - and they aren't drow; something else; small, humanoid, seem to be humming! Smaller than drow. 
* Penny, with Francesc helping -> ADV: 20. This seems too good to be true; we've had all this time undisturbed!

### LEVEL 8

We level up! The session ends there.

(End of part 28)
