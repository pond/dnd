# RIPA: Part 39
## Session 39 (2024-05-14)
### Day 41, Annam's Cradle

We spent the night in Korantor Keep. In so doing, we discovered a kind of parallel dream world, wherein a sleeping stone giant, the last of the watchers of that place, told us about a creature or creatures bound by magic nearby in a connected, other plane domain which we had by chance stumbled upon ourselves earlier that day (but not explored). She told us to wake her if thing(s) bound there had since escaped. We investigated and they had, of course, escaped! Before being able to wake the giant, we first encountered a bizarre creature, a sort of mechanical, skeletal affair, with one empty (or, at least small) eye and another big, glowing eye; it seemed to be trying to extract something from the mind of the sleeping giant; it scanned our group with a strange green ray, made a comment about "There is great potential here" and meeting again, then teleported away. The teleport was strange - perhaps inter-planar. We each discovered a *gift* of a new ability after that, too, despite the unsettling appearance of this individual and the nefarious act that we seemed to have interrupted.

We woke the giant. She agreed that she would like to be taken back to the other giants in the village far up above, once we are able to depart; in the mean time, we headed to the ruined nearby village of Hiatea's Hearth, having been told that the stone tablets we seek are probably there. Thorin wildshaped into a creature large enough to carry the rest of us over, but as we got close, we saw a different giant in battle with some kind of huge crocodile-toad-lizard creature on the outskirts of the village, at the bank of river!

We're about 1200ft away and 400ft up - quite a distance. Penny tries to figure out who is the "good or bad guy" but Insight 5+2->7, no idea. "Anyone got any clue of which one of these we fight?" Arturo says, "I think we can probably converse with the giant and not the crocodile monster, so let's start with the crocodile monster!"

Thorin starts to dive in towards it. His best speed is about 160 at a dash, which would take us 7.5 rounds to cover the diagonal 1200ft down. Within about 24 seconds, Francesc would be in range. Arturo offers to Fly Penny (60ft speed) once we're close.

Around 1000ft out. Francesc is readying the bow. Penny has the sword lit. The crocodile-ish creature is charging at the giant, then claws at him. The giant is swinging his club to try and push it back, but seems a bit clumsy - this is not a warrior; no big sword, no armour, just a club. A villager fending off a wild animal, perhaps.

880ft. Francesc tries shouting in Giant, so that the "villager" knows help is coming; she's trying to be loud so this is treated as an intimidation check; but it's only 10; no reaction. Penny starts to cast Bless for Francesc, Arturo and Thorin; initiative is rolled.

* Penny 21
* Arturo 20
* Francesc 19
* Thorin 9

(Francesc predicted before the roll that this is the one time that she'd get to go first when she's the person with the lowest range and least ability to do anything!)

720ft... Bless is cast... Not quite close enough for Francesc. The giant has his hands up, sometimes looking very focused and trying to touch the creature with bare hands; it's strange; perhaps there is some magical ability it wants to use? The creature is slimy and evasive. At one point, though, he succeeds, but nothing much seems to happen and the giant is surprised. We learn that this is a Krasis later. It shakes its head; slimy water is flung from gills; it tries to bite but (nat 1) the giant blocks with his club.

Penny holds fast. Francesc will react once it is in range... Thorin reaches 560ft, but on the way, as soon as she's in range, Francesc fires. **Crit!** - aimed at the base of the neck - 26 damage. The arrow sinks into the open gill and that *certainly* gets a reaction; the creature thrashes around and turns to face us. It runs, somehow skittering across the water's surface, apparently looking for us; then dives in. We've a rough idea of where it is - we can see it under the water, but with refraction - range attacks are at disadvantage.

The creature must be around 500ft away, as it is heading our way. Penny continues to hold. Arturo casts Fly on her and for a moment she nearly lifts off Thorin before grabbing a tighter hold. Francesc fires twice. The first hits; a solid 21 damage. Second - hits thanks to Bless ("*not* totally useless!" celebrates Penny). This one doesn't have All The Toys on it, but still does 8 more damage.

The giant runs forward into the shallower water at the edge of the river. He crouches down and puts his hand into the sand on the shore. A strange ripple seems to form under the water, as if the sand is moving. The waves seem to have the intent of forming some kind of strange water-liked barrier in front of the giant. Arturo is a bit worried; he knows necromancy might be happening in this village - is this giant the culprit? He can't figure it out in arcane terms and tries looking for any obvious decoration - bones, sculls on a string, anything! Perception 6; can't tell.

Arturo, survival 18. The way the huge beast ran *on* the water briefly was extraordinary; it looked some 30ft tall (30ft from tail to snout). He suggests to Thorin that we get within 120ft but no closer, except perhaps as a fly-by - he wants Telekenesis, 60ft, to try and lift it out of the water - as it's a danger zone potentially for this thing to jump out. So we keep diving at the creature... Thorin closes to 180ft. The Krasis moves incredibly fast now it's under the water. As fast as we seem to be, it seems to be equally quick, moving some 160ft towards us - only 340ft maybe now - but then it dives, and we can't see it.

Penny prepares Scorching Ray once we get in range. Arturo prepares Psychic Lance, as he realises that with Telekenesis he'd lose Fly! Francesc tries arrows at where it *was*; the hits thanks to 4 with Bless, *just* hits. 21 damage! She fires again and hits conclusively; 14 more damage. Now the giant acts again. It lifts its hands out of the water; it seems to be pulling up strange, black mud strings from the end of his fingers that look almost like melting tar. He starts moving his hands in the air to create a rune. Penny, history 17-1->16, she *does* recognise it - it was carved into the skeleton of the T-Rex. She calls out, "That's the same magic as the T-Rex!"

The hands are slammed down into the water. Strange skeletons start to appear from the water's edge, covered in tar, behind for now the strange "water wall". They seem to be adopting a defensive position.

Thorin has a difficult decision. At 180ft out - *ish* - he has to continue to go in or perhaps keep distance; full dash, all the way in - ATHL or ACRO change, gets 10 total. He tries to be graceful but doesn't level out fast enough! It's been a long, steep dive, and he wants to only get within 40ft altitude but drops lower, to around 30ft, roughly above wherever we think the Krasis dived. At that very moment, Francesc's passive perception alerts her to a blur in the water - and then the Krasis bursts out, leaping towards us.

Penny's rays shoot out. She's surprised by its sudden appearance - it is jumping *over* us! - and only one hits; 8 damage. Arturo's lance strikes true! A -4 on its intelligence make it impossible to save against his DC and is incapacitated, 31 damage, *but* does get its initial attack in - its tail swipes across Thorin's back. Francesc is in line for the hit... Francesc perception 20, she's not surprised; she sees it coming, but it still hits. She takes a huge *33* bludgeoning damage! STR save; between Penny's aura and the Bless it's a very high save (well over 30). Somehow she avoids being pushed off! She reacts - Gift Of The Gem Dragon - it isn't pushed away but takes 3 more damage.

On the Krasis turn it just plunges into the water with a loud splash!

"Is it a beast?!" shouts Arturo. Penny survival, 21, "Some kind of monster!"

Penny can't see it! It's fallen into the water. She calls to Thorin to circle, detaches and flies; perception 18+2->20; she can just about make out the creature, fairly deep under water though. It seems to have swum under us, as if it's going to spring back up. She moves off as far as she can to one side to avoid being in its path, then drops L3 Moonbeam down into the water. This makes it easier to see!

Arturo thinks about Fireball... Arcana check; he figures magic *will* reach it but that kind of energy release under water will create quite the blast radius as the water turns into steam. Thorin, Arturo and Francesc are about 30ft up and 10ft to the side. He throws it! A tiny marble of magic; it hits the water quietly, very quickly, bubbles trailing behind; there's a flash, then a dull thud, then a *tremendous* blast and almost deafening hiss as water explodes upwards and outwards. Penny had moved far enough away to be out of the range, but Thorin, Arturo and Francesc are in trouble.

The Krasis makes its save; takes 18 damage; Francesc (20) manages to stay on Thorin's back but Thorin (9) is knocked violently sideways and Arturo (12) is thrown off, falling to the water. Thorin tumbles sideways and hits the river too, carrying Francesc with him. She uses Writhing Tide, a raft of slugs (!), to stay up and above the surface, around 10ft. She fires arrows. ANOTHER crit - but the roll is at disadvantage; it's still at hit, at least; 20 damage. The second attack misses the mark.

The giant is walking casually away from the river, apparently heading home!

Thorin has changed back into his dwarf form, spluttering and splashing around in the water. ATHL 17, he reaches the surface, and somehow manages to cast a spell with verbal and somatic components - he invokes Conjure Animals, 2x CR1; two giant octopi appear. He orders one to grab him and hold him out of the water, and another to grab Arturo and do the same.

The Krasis acts. The psychic lance stun effect has worn off. Once again it decides to attack Francesc and tries to bite.  As it moves it takes 18->9 damage from Moonbeam, but manages to deal 35 piercing damage to Francesc - she goes down. She's also in its mouth. Then it tries to swipe at the octopus holding Arturo and hits, dealing 19 damage. A third attack! The tail swipes at Arturo atop the octopus; even with Shield that would match his AC; 27 damage - and very happily for Penny, he keeps his Fly spell up. But it's not done - the tail seems to have control, grip; it contents with the octopus; but the octopus manages to hold on. Arturo reacts with Gem Dragon, which pushes it back a short way and deals 6 damage. It lets go of Francesc who splashes into the water, and starts to sink down; it's not dead; but it is trying to get away (Thorin, passive insight).

The monster is sinking away. Penny really wants to attack it, but Francesc is also sinking and in dire straits; Penny is just able to reach her by fly, ATHL check *just* scrapes (*just*) enough to lift her out of the water; 40 points hands-on are dumped into wake her up... But this means that the creature has escaped. Thinking about it, Penny isn't sure she could have ever done enough damage, even with solid hits, to bring it down in a single attack.

Arturo shouts, "Let's get to shore and regroup!"

Near the shore, the strange undead creatures are still wandering around. They don't attack us. We figure - we need to talk to the giant; removing its defensive creatures might annoy it; we leave them alone.

As we stand at the shore - the octopi hanging around just in the shallows - we see the giant watching us from nearby, at a crumbled building. In Giant, it asks us what our intentions are. Francesc tries to allay its fears; even with help from Penny and Arturo, though, persuasion is only 11. He doesn't attack but doesn't trust us either. He steps forward a little. "And why should I answer your questions?"

We were at the keep; the giant there is awake; the evil is released; we need the tablets to help.

The giant shrugs. It thanks us for intervening though attacks like this are commonplace and he seems confident that he'd have fought off the creature either way (Arturo insight 15, the giant would've been injured but with its rune casting completed, it would've had a chance to escape).

Arturo suggests we ask permission to be let into the village and speak to the Chief. No - because *he* is the chief! Francesc insight 26. Not only is hiding something, but he might also be the very last survivor.

We suggest that he could come with us when we leave, along with the other giant.

"I cannot leave my charge. I am the last of my line that protect Hiatea's Hearth and the magic within."

We don't mention the Archive directly, but suggest that there is a safe place guarded by other giants - we could move him there. Since we found this place, others surely could too; we could move him there. Arturo is disadvantaged by working through Francesc for translation, but still gets an 18 persuasion (not 32!).

The giant is weighing things up (DM roll). He turns to Francesc and says in Giant, "Very well. Come in. Follow me." Francesc insight 19; he's suspicious of *us* but it seems genuine. He has, sadly, a sense of hopelessness; what will happen when *he* is gone? The idea of being able to tell other Giant-kind is alluring - even, perhaps, necessary.

Francesc notes something of interest; **he is not as surprised by the presence here of 'little folk' as we would expect**.

We get inside. The space is huge! Even scaled down to a "human" size, this would be a big space; like a huge dining hall, numerous long tables - stone slabs, not wood - but with massive, perhaps-once-Redwood benches - and a large hearth with soft glow, though not a full fire. Once, this space must have been glorious, carved directly out of a rock outcrop. Small shafts of light come down through natural sky lights. Upon a raised dais stands a throne, flanked by two ornate tables with runic carvings. Remnants of tattered and faded tapestries show heraldry; scenes of empires.

Arturo comments (and is translated) saying, "This must have been a huge empire back in the day." The giant looks confused - "Which empire are you speaking of?" Francesc tries to name an empire, but (deception roll is low, even with advantage) he is not fooled and asks, "What do you know of Hiatea's Hearth?"

For the next ten minutes, the giant walks us along the Southern and Western walls, describing the tapestries. He explains about the rise of each empire and how cunning, strength, skill, wisdom or knowledge, each empire rose and took a place on the throne. It is *the* seat of Giantdom in Annam's Cradle, but - and he pauses - he describes that the seat of power here grants actual, tangible power, including the powers of previous empires; *but* it comes with a curse. No empire has ever succeeded - it always implodes, eating itself from within. The greater the rise, the greater the fall. This has been the nature of the struggle here - a seat that is coveted, empires rising quickly - in 5-10 years - but then only 15 years or so later, things go back to disarray and chaos for decades. More time is spent in chaos than order. These timescales are very surprising to us - to a giant with a giant's lifespan, these are practically the blink of an eye. He's seen five himself, but none for the last 160 years. Each collapse tends to decimate the population. The last one he saw fell to civil law and an incursion (the mind flayers), losing almost all the remaining giants. He would be surprised if there were more than a couple of dozen giants left in the whole land.

He does not know if any of the invading mind flayers made it out. He's not been allowed to abandon this place, as long as its magic and its artefacts remain. The magic is bound here, and we don't know what items we might need to remove; he can't leave as long as that magic is here. Francesc asks if that magic only works for giants; he doesn't know. No small folk have ever got close enough before!

Penny casts Detect Magic while Thorin examines stonework. The stonework is amazing, but has no special properties beyond the extraordinarily high quality of the workmanship. It could only be made by stone giant artisans to such scale and precision. Detect Magic meanwhile gives no clear read. There's magic in the area but not specifically from the throne. Penny starts to look around.

Francesc and the giant continue talking. The throne was always viewed by them as largely symbolic; he doesn't think it is magical; but it *does* seem to be cursed. Arturo helps (32), asking more questions to try and get the whole story. The stone giant thinks then asks us to follow him.

There is a bedroom; a kind of cellar; some kind of library, or trophy room. There are some artefacts there. Penny perception ADV (Detect Magic) 17. Plenty of items are considered artefacts here, but are *not* magical. In a lined box with a flipped-up lid we see a stone tablet. We point it out and ask about it. He knows it is part of an old, 7-part poem. He goes to check more details and returns with some note books! "It is a poem that describes the last time that the Rod of Law was used and how it was banished, including ways to start the hunt for each part again."

We reveal that this is, indeed, the poem we've been seeking - this tablet is a copy, he says, the original being destroyed. Arturo suggests that bad people might seek this; we might need to take this away to help save him! But this is one of the artefacts that this giant has been tasked with protecting and he does not agree. We are certainly allowed to take a rubbing of the surface.

Penny has still found no particular spell or artefact that seems responsible for the description of what happens on this throne.

After a while, she gets Francesc to translate; "I don't think the throne is magic at all. I just think this is what power does. Especially power taken on the basis of a myth. People *expect* the throne to help them rise to power. Those looking at the king on that throne have the same expectation. But other people would constantly then be plotting to gain that power for themselves. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We've seen similar cycles, albeit without the myth of the throne itself, in countless small folk kingdoms over the ages."

But how would you prove it - what's the difference between a throne that has power from assumption and myth, or one that has power from magic? Very true.

Thorin in the same vein asks about ceremonies and conditions for taking the throne. There are some ceremonies but there are all different ways that people have ascended (as he listed - wisdom, cunning and so-on). The only constant thing in the ceremonies and rooms is that one hearth, which is a fire that never goes out. We think we'll examine the fire more closely soon, then.

Francesc gets around to asking about the little folk - he wasn't too surprised - small folk have appeared periodically. A few years ago, a small entourage came to pay respects to the last empire and examined the trophy room in which we stand (the tablet was here at the time). And then he mentions - of the entourage - **they were demons**. The leader of the group might have been a vampire? He's not sure.

Penny's looking at the hearth now. It's surrounded by a number of perpetual flame spells. In the middle is a portal! Arcana 19-1 -> 18; there's a sense of a plane of pure chaos, but not random chaos; a chaos with evil intent. It's tiny - barely enough to put your hand through - perhaps that was enough to corrupt things. Penny draws the giant's attention to it. Can he see it? Is he aware of it? He can't see it. Arturo suggests that the demons who visited perhaps left a portal so they could come back any time. "Then we must close it!" says the giant.

Thorin considers his options. We ask if the giant trusts us enough to cast Dispel Magic *on the portal*. With Penny helping (via being able to clearly see the portal thanks to Detect Magic, still up but about to falter) - persuasion 28 - he's happy. But if *anything* goes wrong - "I will have to don my mantle as protector of the hearth. You know what that means!"

Thorin casts Detect Magic (on the portal and only the portal!) but it's a high level spell. Arcana, 10, with self-guidance, 12. Penny says "...nah. Didn't work!" Francesc says, "Do it again!" So Thorin casts again, Arcana, 17, adds Guidance, 18, then Arturo adds Bend Luck - +3 - 21, that's enough! (Just!)

It closes. Penny says, "Bingo!"

As this happens, we get a strange sensation; the giant feels it too; CHA saves.

* Arturo 16
* Francesc 17
* Penny 24
* Thorin Nat 20 -> 26

Turns out the DC is higher than Arturo and Francesc managed to roll below. Penny and Thorin get a feeling that the fabric of the room somehow changes and shifts slightly. We become aware that the portal is ancient! It has been here for hundreds of years. It's *not* from the recent demon visit. Only the waning magic of a permanent gate, placed here a very, very long time ago, left it. Could well be the reason people on the throne found it hard to keep power! The shift in the room is curious; a feeling of being calmer. An edge, that's gone - anxiety - not our interactions with the giant; it was this portal, this "gate", that was causing the feelings.

Arturo and Francesc, on the other hand, see different things. They each see variations of the same. Arturo sees in his minds eye a crumbling, floating castle in the maelstrom of pandemonium and has a strange feeling of being two feet behind someone he's following - a trailing gown, gold sash, embroidery; every time he turns a corner he sees it, briefly, just ahead. He ascends crumbling steps to a stone courtyard, parts crumbling away, even as he watches. Francesc sees something that reminders her of her core philosophies of - are the gods real? If they are, why are they so petty and almost at times evil? Would the world be better without them? She realises she's in a meeting room in a tower, surrounded by gods bickering. Someone seated at the head of the table, wearing a crown of gold, with purple and gold robes, stands, it gives a withering look and a ray of green scans out of its eyes, a large purple gem in its chest pulsates; they all disintegrate! The walls crumble as it looks to Francesc and tries to say something to her. And as Arturo at the same time turns a corner, he sees the being - the same creature he saw when we woke the sleeping giant - it speaks; "I will remake all of reality. Are you in my reality or will you be erased?" - Francesc hears, "The gods are false; they will be destroyed; there is no need for gods anymore."

Both come back to their senses in the room which, to them, seems the same as before.

We spend some time comparing notes as we all had very different experiences. That includes the giant; he concedes that maybe there was a curse after all. Arturo tries his luck again. The power of the throne is gone; there are not enough giants left to try and claim it. The curse is gone too, now the portal is gone. We can help him pack treasures to be taken somewhere safer, for the legacy to be protected, forever more. Penny helps too - this treasure isn't random; it'll join similar tablets, and it's protected by giants - _stone_ giants - who consider their treasure equally important. ADV persuasion is 27, plus a DM-suggested Bend Luck of 31. The DC is 30 - we're trying to persuade someone to abandon a generational post!

So, remarkably, he agrees.

**History, Francesc, 19; she is sure that the person she saw in her vision is historically significant but can't put her finger on how she knows them. She's pretty sure they are... Somebody! It needs researching, perhaps at our Candlekeep bastion.**

### Day 41 (Late)

We use two helm charges. A giant bag - even giant for the giant! - is carefully packed with numerous priceless artefacts. It's teleported to the priestess, with him; then we all leave this strange domain. Abruptly, we are back in the strange, dark timelessness of Gracklstug.

(End of part 39)
