# RIPA: Part 30
## Session 30 (2024-02-13)
### Underdark, stopped at the first waypoint on the way to Gracklstugh

Watch is set.

* Arturo and Penny work together - Penny negated-disadvantage-flat 14+2->16. Uneventful.
* Thorin - 12+8->20. Again uneventful.
* Francesc - nat 2+6->8.



## Day 30

Penny spends a bit of time swapping out the scrying orb for her amulet again. It seems more useful here!

In the morning, Thorin, Arturo and Penny wake up to find Francesc is outside the room, pacing nervously. We've all found it quite unnerving having no idea of the passage of time; no sky, no natural light. More than that, Francesc was guarding our guide to make sure he didn't sneak away and fetch anyone to try and (say) rob us.

Hoskuldr wakes and we gather. We decide to proceed, without breakfast - more sliding tubes today! Onward. Jesse sets up PWAT as usual and keeps a close eye on the guide.

We're told that we'll get to the Silken Paths today... Penny keeps an eye on where we are and where we are going (Survival 15+5->20). Some stalactites and stalagmites are so big that *settlements* are built into them - connecting walkways, carved out buildings and more. There's a soft glow of lights - odd, can't all the Underdark denizens see with no light? - looks like a *four storey* structure in one.

Arturo (survival 10) is on the lookout for threats. Smells are very strange here. Then he realises - after almost stumbling over one - that there are husks of bodies, mouths agape, empty eye sockets, chewed-through sculls as if something has sucked out the brain. 

Thorin is on the lookout for things generally. Perception 24. He notices that while we're descending slowly, it's not as steep as yesterday (slidey tubes notwithstanding!). There are lots of large mushrooms around; frilly-edged - with quite a few of the husk bodies lying near them. He figures **something about this are must lure people to their deaths**. It has a forest feel - we spend a good hour walking through this bizarre environment. Occasionally, out of the corner of his eye, Thorin thinks he sees movement, especially near cavern walls. We guess that the forest area must be a mile and a half wide, so the cavern is truly vast. We walk on raised paths or through less overgrown sections, following our guide closely.

It takes the better part of four hours to get through all this, from start, to a chasm, the giant stalactites and stalagmites and the mushroom forest. Now we seem to reach more established, distinct paths with land bridges that look down over chasms with the sounds of running water. Thorin and Penny via passive perception notice that one of the works in the road - one we do not take - has what looks like footprint tracks and - Thorin thinks - raw *gem dust*, as if abraded and rubbed of things. Thorin is sure that this is must be a mine. There are wagon tracks in the dust, too.

We reach a ledge; the ceiling is only about 100ft above. The guide stops us and warns us to be *very* careful! It's a very, very long fall. He edges along the ledge that runs along the side of the canyon wall. There is nothing below - none of us can see any sign of a bottom to this drop. About 50ft along, there's a strange carved-out cave area with decorated walls and etchings. A pulley system is attached to the roof of the cave. There are levers, cranks and gears.

The guide asks for help - Penny steps in; adv ATHL, nat 20+6 -> 26. She hauls a basket of sorts across to our side and she steadies it so it stops swinging. The guide tell us to get in - Arturo suggests he go first! He claims that he needs to "set it before I jump in". Insight rolls don't help much, so it's a leap of faith. Everyone gets in except Penny who has to hold the basket steady and the guide to pulls various levers. When he's done, he and Penny must jump in together. With one last pull, Penny hauls it around 180 degrees and it "clicks" onto some kind of other track. He runs and jumps in shouting "now". Penny dives in after, just in time - head down, feet up!

Look a rollercoaster it gains sudden speed, stomachs in the chest, as it plunges down - Francesc (nat 2+1+5 from aura) spews *again*, Francesc CON 13 is fine (inc +5 bonus). Thorin 25, Arturo 31!

The plunge this time isn't anything like the tubes before. Four or five minutes of rapid descent is followed by us levelling out and slowing. And from there - we have to crank it manually. There's a rotating handles (like hand-driven bike pedals) that keep things moving.

We enter a long gallery-like room, with numerous cables and tracks running over the top. There's a depression that the basket scrapes into and is briefly held by, until we jump out and lighten the load. There's dim light here, and we see that the basket is quite dented! It must hit things some times.

Not much can be done about the mess in the bottom of the basket... Oh well!

We go *way* off the beaten track now. Small passageways, lots of dodgy ledges. It does not look like a well-travelled route. Penny Survival 14; with Arturo's help, 16. It's harder to track where we are - not so many obvious landmarks. A lot of similar visual cues. The temperature has dropped considerably compared to before the mining cart - we'd ready that some of the Underdark could be very warm, due to lava pits and suchlike. Perhaps this cold is comforting!

We go past what look like abandoned, burned-out settlements. They seem to have been intentionally destroyed and abandoned for a very long time. It's hard to tell how long. Much of the Underdark seems to be covered in cobwebs, so that's not a sign, it's more about dust and general decay. They're small buildings, even dwarves would struggle - this feels like a place that deep gnomes would have lived.

Another hour passes by. WIS saves all round!

* Penny 26
* Arturo 25
* Thorin 17 (inc +5!)
* Francesc 25

...we are not affected. Only Thorin even slightly notices a temptation or confusion - from a singing that breaks out. It's very strange, creepy, sounds almost like young children crossed with the rubbing of balloons. It's a strange chorus. It is a well conducted choir, though! Our guide, belatedly, tells us not to listen to the singing. "They won't hurt us - we're not going into their territory - but whatever you do, don't breathe it in!" - and holds a scarf across his mouth and nose.

We reach a very large, open cavern. The singing is loud here. This place is almost brightly lit - a kaleidoscope of colours up to a 200ft high roof, bioluminescence aplenty. A huge multi-level mushroom forest. Even Francesc is impressed. Strange, animated, shambling, fungal creatures - some of which looks like fungi which animated a dead body, others that look like just animated fungi! - are singing, though they don't move their mouths.

The air is thick with spores.

Thorin, 18 arcana. These sound very much like something he's heard about from other Dwarves - Michonid colonies. They share a hive mind within each colony. Some of the bigger ones seem to stand around and direct what the others do, but without saying anything - some physical movements, but it mostly seems to be just a mental connection.

It takes about 20 minutes to clear the large colony. We've been travelling for around 6 hours. "All right - everyone OK?  Dust yourselves off, you'll be fine! It's only a danger if you've illnesses or if you're dying..." says our guide "...you don't want those spores on you if you're dying."

We reach a point where we're told a decision must be made. The silken paths are ahead. Do we risk crossing now, or do we rest first? We have PWAT up; Arturo cast Mage Armour at the start of the day and we don't want to waste that either. It's been about 6.5 hours.

Press on.

Insight - low all round. Thorin, perception 23 - he notices our guide **silently mouthing a prayer** and wiping sweat off his brow! Thorin says loudly, "He looks quite nervous!"

We're taken past a kind of corridor. It's dimly lit all around by bioluminescence. We're firmly instructed to stay *behind* our guide while he checks everything. He wanders out into an area darker than where we were; none of that bioluminescence there. Almost no light at all. An almost trick-of-the-light occasional flash gives us some idea of something in there, but otherwise; pitch dark.

Thorin and Francesc can see a short distance ahead in black and white, some 60ft or so maximum. Beyond that, nothing. Penny has some blindsight to 10ft, but that's it. Arturo has his hands on Penny's shoulders, Penny has her hands on Francesc's shoulders. Our guide seems to have better darkvision than us, thankfully!

Francesc and Thorin notice very thick, cloth-like spider strands on the sides of canyons. There are sharp, jagged rocks.  Penny (sound) perception 5+2, hears nothing much but Arturo (perception 19) hears strange clicking and skittering noises, as if distant things are moving or distant rocks are falling. There's the occasional sound of dripping water. After a while, we're not sure what is our imagination and what is real.

We reach a ledge. Here, stretching out in front, are the largest spider silk strands Thorin or Arturo have ever seen (or Penny, close up, by Blindsight). **They're nearly a foot in diameter** and corded - large numbers of strands appear to have been twisted, or connected and congealed, together. It seems a natural process, not something constructed. They go well beyond the limit of our sight, into the darkness.

The guide whispers, "This is the Great Divide. We're going onto secret paths. When we get onto them, three things you must know - do not make too much noise! When you're walking, for every three to four steps that you take, do a few random ones out of time to break up the rhythm. You don't want it to feel like people walking. We will have to go very slowly. Finally, test every strand with your weight as some are weaker. Whatever you do, do not fall - this is nearly 1000ft deep! **Be patient - we cross at the narrowest point, but it's still 2000ft wide here.** Once we're over, everything improves!"

Arturo and Thorin come up with a plan, that if we're in trouble and within ~600ft of the far side, Arturo could cast Light on one of Francesc's arrow and fire that to the other side, then since we'll be able to see that location, use the Helm - now restored up to 2 of its 3 charges - to teleport to the far side. Arturo could also cast Fly on himself and one other person ("The guide, probably!" he says).

We're expecting trouble. Penny casts Aid, giving 5 HP boost to Francesc, Thorin and Arturo.

We step onto the web. Francesc and Thorin realise that there are multiple layers of strands. Below, there must be at least 60ft of various layers, 5-10ft apart, as far as they can see. At least if we *did* fall there'd be a chance of landing on a layer below rather than just plunging 1000ft! Stealth, ADV all-round due to shuffling on the web:

* Penny nat 15 -> 14 -> 24 with PWAT
* Francesc 26 with PWAT
* Thorin 21
* Arturo 21

DM rolls perception... 

Around 480ft along, we're all asked to roll a D12.

* Penny 5
* Francesc 1
* Thorin 8
* Arturo 8

Francesc suddenly stops. In front of her is a large cocoon suspended across 3 of the strands. She examines it... "They're alive!" she whispers. We could go past, but Penny and Francesc aren't happy about that. Penny has a longsword, but Francesc pulls out a dagger. She tries to cut into the cocoon. DEX 14, trying not to cut the person - nicks them a bit (oops) but does get into there. A 3ft tall, young male Halfling wearing light brown leather armour with backpack and the works - an adventurer. Very faint breathing. Penny medicine 12. He doesn't respond, the body is limp as if paralysed; his eyes are slightly open. Penny lays on hands to grant HP and cure poison, but Arturo gags the guy with a scarf lest he scream or otherwise cry out. Penny says, "We're rescuing you but this is a *very* dangerous place, be very quiet!"

The body warms up. Penny gets a sense of purging. He coughs into the rag that Arturo used. Penny repeats what she said; he nods. He stands up. He seems quite injured. Penny puts in another 5hp from her pool. He's at +5. He's weak but up. Whispers, "follow us, step exactly where we step, use irregular footsteps". Thorin and Francesc see that the guide is distraught! What are we doing?! But we press on. Fortunately, Thorin is able to extend PWAT's aura to the new inadvertent party member (house rule). He stealth roll ends up being 32. He ends up hanging off Arturo's belt - he, too, cannot see in the dark! To have got where we found him, he probably got caught as part of a wider party and was believed killed.

Arturo hears something that sets his hair on end - the sound of chitin rubbing, getting closer. When he tries to figure out where it's coming from... **It's coming from everywhere**. The guide stops. Then turns and says, more loudly, "We need to move **FAST**!" - he moves quickly, but not carefully - but we're barely 500ft along a 2000ft journey! We go after him, trying to keep up, but Penny hoarsely whispers, "Keep your calm, you fool, and keep close!" Persuasion dirty 20. He's very keen to keep going. "Step where I step!"

We keep going but we know combat is inevitable. Thorin suddenly turns into a giant spider - he'd be capable of carrying the halfling but Arturo doesn't know that. He senses **the party and 18 giant spiders running our way!** Arturo passes the halfing to Penny and says "I'm casting fly!" - and casts on himself and Penny, who is now carrying the halfling while trying to assure them it'll all be fine. Penny is close enough to see Thorin-Spider and passes the halfling onto the spider's back. Francesc breaks into a sprint - but the speed is 20, with a dash action, ACRO 15, just enough - 40ft a round. 

Penny draws the light sword, flies up a bit above the web and calls "SHIELD YOUR EYES!", then illuminates the sword at full brightness.

We all now see this huge, huge cavern. Layer after layer of glistening, corded web strands. From the edge of the light, we see numerous reflections in eyes of spiders; it seems like an endless wall, closing in! "It was better when it was dark!" says Penny as the guide complains loudly about the light. But the guide can see a direction where there's a break in the wall of spiders and the guide runs for it, shouting "STAY ON ME!" as he runs.

Arturo, Thorin-spider with halfling and Penny are able to keep up. Arturo starts using Firebolt to try and cut the webs that lead to our layer, hoping to cut off the approaching giant spiders. Attack 25; he hits a nexus of strands, and a whole bunch of webs incinerate! A top layer on one side falls, spiders jumping all over. Four fall. Penny uses her Circlet Of Blasting - hit, hit, miss, onto the opposing side. While one hits a layer below, the other two drop some spiders down onto a layer below, causing a delay. Four more fall. **Ten still on target!**

They're about 120-150ft away at the closest, Thorin-spider notes via Tremorsense. But they're not gaining on *him*. The halfling on his back leans forward, "I don't know who you are but thank you for saving me my name is Fargus, **Fargus Rumblefoot**, what do I call you? I guess you can't talk right?!"

Arturo perception 17, Penny 21. As we run, Arturo D6->2 - two rounds of flight pass by, 180ft moved - 780ft from the starting edge. (Run, Firebolt; Run, Dash). We hear two winged creatures heading towards the light - Penny shouts out, "**CLOAKERS!**" - they come two different directions. Arturo tells Penny to turn off the sword light, casts Light on a potato, Mage Hands it 60ft forward as a distraction, then uses Dust Of Disappearance - he manages to catch himself and Penny, along with the Guide and Francesc; they become invisible. Thorin and the halfling on his back are not invisible, but are now in at best dim light. 960ft. We push on and try to fly even faster.

Francesc ACRO 24 - she is jumping nimbly from strand to strand. Thorin feels her movements. What little Arturo and Penny see is mostly just the vibration of the web strands from her movements.

The halfling yells, "They're closing in!" - Penny doesn't know if it is Cloakers or spiders!

Arturo deception: 17. We get another 2 rounds of full dash - 1220ft. Arturo notices a brief moment where the potato light is blocked; a flurry of wings; the potato is gone! Penny and Arturo are plunged into darkness. Thorin is too far away (60ft Blindvision, and Penny and Arturo deliberately ran ahead) to see the cloakers. Penny has no choice - she draws the sword and relights. Woah! **NOT** Cloakers. Black squid?! (**Darkmantle**).

She engages. She gets a first hit with Divine Smite but only 13 damage. It isn't resistant, but isn't vulnerable either. She attacks again. 16 damage; that's enough - the first one goes down.

Arturo can see the other strange black squid. Initiative: only 4. Penny is shocked to see the other squid thing head to Arturo, *not* Penny. Thorin gets within range and sees this all unfolding. He sees the Darkmantle try to engulf and crush Arturo. His mage armour is AC 15 vs attack 14 - win! But that said, it's in melee range now.

Arturo notes that its speed equals his own while flying. He tries Mind Whip instead. DC16 INT which it can't possibly make. 3d6->only 8 psychic damage and is stunned now. Arturo can disengage so flies past it, as fast as he can to.

Thorin sees that Arturo, Penny and the remaining creature we were flying about 30ft above the layer of strands we are on. The guide is shouting back, "Stop picking fights with everything!" and Thorin agrees - he keeps running.

1280ft.

(Penny, initiative 21). Sbe flys up and starts swinging at this other creature. She hits for 21 damage - coupled with Arturo's hit, she takes it down. The spiders are still coming though, so she chases after Thorin.

Thorin adv. ATHL, 17. He runs and jumps - 6 more rounds pass! We're just running - another 6 * 60 -> 720ft, which brings those who are flying exactly to the other side, but we keep slow to keep them in range. The spiders are just behind.

1640ft.

Arturo has been sending out Firebolts. D6->5, he manages to take out five more sections of the web to further delay the chasing spiders. This delays all ten remaining spiders, falling down to lower levels - they can't catch up.

This means the guide, Francesc, Thorin and halfling are running on one of the few intact webbing strands! We all make it to the 2000ft mark. The invisible Francesc appears visible as she decides to throw some arrows at chasing spiders, getting some hits.

Then we shout to the guide, "Get us out of here!" "This way! This way!"

As we run, we see two strange goblins, stood on this side of the chasm, looking very surprised - "I don't suppose you need a guide?!" shouts one of them (Thorin and Penny hear this via passive perception) after our fleeing party. **Made it!** We've passed the spiders. But we didn't see any Cloakers. We just got attacked by Darkmantles - we were lucky. Perhaps there aren't even Cloakers in this area; surviving long enough to tell the tale would be a difficult endeavour!

After catching our breath, the guide brings us along to "safe-ish" area to camp. No inns here. "Another day of travel until we get close to the lake, and then we cross."

We elect to camp. It's been... A day.

"I've used this place before when I was younger. I'm pretty sure it's still here..." says the guide; within the next hour, the guide finds a good place to crash. As we walk, Fargus runs up. "I don't know how this works?! Thank you very much for saving my life! I'm Fargus Rumblefoot. I'm not from round these parts. Neither are you by the looks of it..." - Thorin mentions gold as a reward. "I do know where a very large hoard is located if you want me to show you...?" answers Fargus, who says there were looking for a tomb down here but got attacked by a pack of insane gnolls. He escaped; the rest of his party didn't; he reached the silken paths, dropped his torch and that attracted spiders. But then, we came along. In addition to everything else, he insists on the "one who brought me back" - Penny - takes a Potion Of Invisibility that he carries. She accepts, with thanks.

Thorin insight 24; he's telling the truth, though Thorin can't tell if the map is accurate. We ask the guide about tombs - "yes, plenty! But if it's lost - well I would't know."

The guide, who is very not interested in lost tombs, pulls out a scrap of paper. "This is a copy of the map that was drawn, not much use on its own, but maybe you could use that with your own map together to figure things out? I will *not* be needing this. I'm not cut out for things like that!"

Arturo reasons that we could continue to the town, but *could* teleport back here to find this tomb if we wanted. **He takes a memento of this location for teleport reasons.** In the mean time he argues that time is short - we should keep the guide while we have him and get where we're going.

Camp is set up; watch is taken.

* Arturo and Penny work together - Penny negated-disadvantage-flat 19. Uneventful.
* Thorin and Fargus work together - adv perception 28. Again uneventful.
* Francesc...

...we get rudely awakened Francesc shaking us awake, "Be quiet! I see movement!"

We're up on a ledge. We sneak to the edge. Below, 3 figures seem to be tracking something, slowly moving towards the rock wall that we climbed up to reach our camp spot. **Drow**. But we had PWAT and the amulets... They surely can't find *us* but might find whoever was *before* us here! One has a crossbow. Another has a strange-looking flail. The other wears a robe - a mage, probably. The mage seems to cast a spell - Arturo arcana 21 - a spell that detects life force. *We* can't be detected but our guide and halfling could! We're all keen to nip this in the bud and ambush.

Francesc fires at the mage. Initiative, at +3 as everyone is within Penny's sentinel aura:

* Francesc 19
* Penny 17
* Arturo 15
* Thorin 12

The mage's spell completes... Stealth, for Thorin and Francesc who are at the edge of the ledge:

* Thorin 14
* Francesc 14

Two of the three Drow are surprised by what happens next. Francesc's arrow uses 'all the toys'; she risks Sharpshooter. It works - she hits - 1d8 + 10 sharpshooter + hex + favoured foe + slugs -> some low rolls, sadly; 25 damage. Second attack, tries the same trick - it *just* hits, matching 12 AC (6+11-5). 22 damage this time. The mage falls!

Penny throws a javelin at weird flail guy. Disadv nat 22, but the low roll is 16; it misses, bouncing off studded leather. Next javelin of 5 - another nat 20! But disadv, so, 22. Hits though! 11 damage.

Arturo throws a fireball above the two remaining Drow. DC16 DEX. One passes, one fails. L4 -> 9d6 potential damage, re-rolling up to 5 damage dice. 27 potential damage; one injured one takes all 27, the other takes 13. Arturo runs back from the ledge edge to try and hide!

Thorin casts Erupting Earth on the area where the two Drow stands. Again, DEX 16 saves - this time, both make their save. Potential damage 33, so each take 16.

The crossbow-wielding Drow fires at Thorin. Hits! 12 damage. His HP from Aid still *just* apply. He needs to make a DC13 CON with advantage; easy (23). Poison is on the arrow but it takes no hold. He takes 7->3->1 (due to resistance) damage.  The Drow deftly reloads and fires again, hitting for 6 damage, but this bolt has no poison. It starts to run towards the wall where we climbed up. The Erupting Earth spell makes the terrain hard to cross and it gets no purchase on the wall.

The flail-wielding Drow casts Levitate to get off the difficult, crumbling ground; it swings its flail as it rises onto the edge of the ledge.

Francesc is now in melee range. She drops her bow and draws her shortsword - but both attacks (11, 15) miss. Penny and Thorin hear - "Possessors! Possessors of the demonic taint! You must be obliterated to stop the corruption. DIE! Die demon spawn!"

Penny stays "We *killed* the demon-worshipping Drow in the watchtower. We do not want demons in this realm" - persuasion 18; the Drow stops for a minute; "But you travel with *that* who would worship at their feet!" - pointing to the Guide. The Guide spits out, "Assumptions! How dare you presume to know anything about me, filthy, cruel, arrogant Drow!" - the Guide has his hammer and is starting to grow! The Drow seems focused on the Duergar. Penny says, "Stand down or die", activates the sun blade at minimum brightness and swings. 23 to hit, 12 radiant. Swings again, but misses. Even so, he looks quite injured. Intimidation: 21. She lowers the sun blade at his eyes and says, "Lower your weapon!"

The Drow relents. He lowers his flail. Penny lowers the sword. The flail Drow calls down to the crossbow wielder to disarm. "If the **scion of House Baenre** perishes, nothing can hold back the wrath of Matron." (Loth). Penny says, "Where can we find this scion, so that we might protect them?". Meanwhile the mage is on death saves - one from the fireball, one from the earth; he fails. They point at the dead mage! We all call to Thorin - "Revivify! Revivify!"

He climbs down and revives the mage. Penny climbs down and adds a few more HP. The other two guards calm him down (with a nat 20) before he casts more spells to take us out!

* They tell us to keep our "wretched dog back" - the Guide.
* Fargus offers to accompany and entertain the Guide in the cave while we speak with the Drow down in the wrecked path down below.
* The mage asks why he cannot detect us, if we are not using foul magic. Penny says, "We *are* using magic; but not demonic" - she points at her amulet. "That is not one of Loth's" "No shit!" "Well if it's not one of Loth's, it's bad magic" "Fine! It's bad magic. But it's not *demon* magic."

And so it goes, to and fro. Things get more reasonable. The mage says, "Shall we just agree that I will give you *this* for bringing me back? It's half of it - because it's partly your fault..." - and hands Thorin 150gp of diamonds, half of the cost of Revivify.

He talks about the ripping asunder of 14 of an entourage by demons; he blames us, but of course, we're not demons! How did they come through?! We explain about the "mouth" being open. Demons can perform incursions onto this plane. He thinks our idea of going to the city - the *centre* of demon activity in his mind! - is a bad idea.

Ultimately, he seems convinced ("despite your murderous intentions!") that we do want to destroy this "network of infidels and traitors" - we've explained about the stone tablets; he might be able to help us find them. He holds out an amulet - **a golden spider wrapped around an amethyst**. "Which of you speaks of the leader?" and without missing a beat Thorin sticks out his hand. Penny rolls her eyes just as the Drow says, "At least it's not the human! Find me at the house of Baenra in the Great City". We learn that the amulet is the insignia of his House.

Thorin is pretty sure that the Great City refers to "**Menzo Berranzan**", the Drow capital.

Thorin asks if the insignia is made in the city? "I would imagine so; this kind of craftsmanship isn't find anywhere else."

The Drow entourage start to head away. The mage is berating his guards for the poor job they did protecting him from harm!

We resume our long rest. We need an extra hour, but the night thereafter goes without issue.



## Day 31

Penny hands Thorin the invisibility potion. "You got him off the web. Besides, I'd make too much noise in all this armour, invisible or otherwise!

Over the course of the day, our guide leads us to the shores of the great lake. Along the way, it's a sort of Greatest Hits of the Underdark's most dangerous and treacherous sights - sinkholes, which almost all of us fall into (except Francesc); a weird fungal bloom that seems to be killing and devouring everything in its path (which we avoid - lots of breath holding, Penny's aura etc. - Penny is immune to all forms of disease); a minor skirmish with crazy goblins that seem to have mutilated themselves and are dancing around a cauldron containing their own fingers and toes, yelling about the "Pudding King", etc.

(We note that there is a lot of Crazy going on - stories about crazy gnolls, these crazy goblins, stories of bad things in the city - it all seems to be down to this demonic incursion and influence).

At long last, the shores of Darklake. The Guide advises camp - but not at the shores! We pitch up a long, safe distance back from the water.

(End of part 30)
