# RIPA: Part 33
## Session 33 (2024-03-12)
### Day 33, Gracklstugh

The tokens we were given worked... We spent the night beyond the wall, in the safer, sort-of-Duergar-only section of Gracklstugh.

An extremely eventful day yesterday has left us with many new avenues to explore but also a sense of urgency - the stone tablets we are seeking are probably being taken to the city's red dragon Themberchaud to be destroyed. We have learned that they are - or at least were - now being conveyed by Duergar, who have a two day head-start over us but will probably be hampered by only moving "between shifts" at quiet times when they are less likely to be observed moving such large items around.

We awaken in a shared room in an inn. We wake up when we wake up! We don't know if it is day or night. The city is noisy; the air is heavy with a frequent blown-through kind of hot smog. Francesc has trouble meditating. She "wakes up" first; then Arturo; then Thorin and Penny at more or less the same time.

"We need to find the duergar carrying the tablets - we have to give chase" (stating the obvious). "How?" asks Francesc. There's a suggestion of getting food as we don't know we might next find food (so we head down to the inn, rather than drawing on rations). Roper steaks of all things...

###  Around midday

...It seems to be lunch, so that gives us some idea of time-of-day. 1gp each. Other people are observing us. Maybe we have to speak to someone who might've seen something. Most people look kind of low-key hostile! Not shady, just distrustful. The least of those is the inn keeper, so Thorin asks if he's seen or heard about the stone tablets. He speaks Undercommon. Penny joins in; Thorin ADV persuasion, only 11 - but it's enough! (They rolled 10). "Look... I wouldn't get involved in anything" he says. "But yes - we did have a few people in here talking about a handover happening out towards Caingorms." "How long ago?" "Yesterday".

He warns us to take care. "You really stand out in these parts! All eyes will be on you - there are many things happening in the city which seem unusual right now. I wouldn't want - if I were you - to be involved in any of them." In particular, he advises us to "stay on this side of Ladauger's Furrow - nothing is worth dying for". And the Cairngorms are out that way - of course.

We thank him and, of course, head directly for the Cainrgorms. It's not hard to spot a giant split, a quake-like chasm as far as we can see, with numerous bridges built over it. That must be the Furrow! Thorin leads; Francesc helps; Penny and Arturo trail, Penny reading out Undercommon signs that Arturo can't read, just to let him know kind of what's going on. Arturo keeps an eye on the rear (perception 19); Francesc watches keenly at the front (perception 25). People seem to keep to themselves and seem very well behaved; but Arturo recognises this from some areas of the Fey. People are acting as if they're being watched by guards all the time - yet we don't see any.

The bridge we reach is numbered. It seems they all are. This is #14. Thorin and Francesc can see huge 60ft high stone gates shut at either end of the furrow, that extend down into the furrow at the far ends where it's less deep. In the middle, it plunges down at least 150ft. They clearly don't want anyone going in? But we start to see things set into the walls on the inside of the Furrow - dwellings. So it's the opposite; the gates keep things *out*. People live within - in fact it looks like a majority of the city night. There *are* dwellings within the furrow outside of the gates, for those who presumably have little choice but to live with a greater risk!

As we cross, we get close to the brutalist, square, block-like foundry buildings. Then Francesc notices a shadow - and all her ranger senses trigger. **A dragon**. It flies, improbably, a vast round body with impossibly small wings, somehow flying around in the dim light, silhouetted. It lands on a circular building, claws over the edge, breathing fire right into the heart of it. Things get very hot, very bright, machinery starts moving faster; it lets out a low rumbling growl and moves to another location.

The cavern ceiling here is lower than we thought, which explains the smog. The buildings go up about 50ft, the cavern some 100ft above that - 150ft tall maximum. It must be quite cramped for that dragon!

Where now? Penny tries to accost a stranger. In her "best" Undercommon, with Arturo's help, she asks about directions to the Cairngorm cavern. Persuasion 15. "You just head out! It's to the left. Outside the city." Options are pointed out. Thorin heads left, towards one of the huge furrow gates that we're told are an option to get outside.

Penny's 10ft Blindsight triggers a bit as we walk. Two guards are following us. She loudly exclaims, "We really *are* going to the cavern. And if you want to check our credentials, you are most welcome to do so."

The air shimmers a bit. Two duergar guards become visible. They head past everyone, straight to Arturo! They say in Undercommon - "Come with us." We translate and translate back, "Why?" "We've been told to find the blue foreigner and take him to the Keepers Of The Flame."

We'll go - but only all of us, together.

180 degree turn! We're led to the other side of the cavern, onto another road out, to the other main gate at the other end of the furrow. Occasionally Penny spot other invisible guards. Arturo asks (via Thorin translating) why they were following, invisible, rather than asking earlier? They claim that their instructions were very vague and they were trying to figure out if this was the right person. Arturo (via Thorin) asks who gave those instructions; Penny chips in on that one; ADV persuasion Arturo 29. They says, "We were told to bring you *to* the Keepers Of The Flame, but it wasn't a Keeper who sent us" - they touch an insignia - it doesn't match anything we've seen before, e.g. the Stone Guard. They don't explain it. They just say, "You've attracted the attention of - if not the most powerful, but the second most powerful being in Gracklstugh. I would be honoured if I were you, but keep your wits about you; we don't all serve the same masters here!"

We're lead out a side door past the gate, along a lengthy colonnade, to some kind of temple, 40ft high entrance, a huge opening above the temple that looks like a huge rose window but without glass. The whole thing is covered in huge scratch marks. Inside, an older male Duergar with one milky-white eye introduces himself as **Gartokkar**. He is the current Flame Keeper. We surmise, the "head" guy. He asks why we're here! The guards try to explain. When Gartokkar asks *who* sent, a deep, echoing voice, with booming vibrations, says, **"ME! I asked for the fire blue thing!"**

There is a deep thudding from the back of the temple. **"Gartokkar! Bring my guests!"**

Insight rolls are low except Francesc, 20; Gartokkar is out of sorts. He did not expect any of this to happen and is trying to figure out what's going on, just as we are! He does what he's told; we are brought to the back, past a destroyed area of temple and to a massive chamber. Sitting on a pile of - Thorin estimates around 250,000gp! - is the big, fat, red dragon. **This is Themberchauld himself**.

So this is the *second* most powerful...

Arturo claims to be honoured and bows. Themberchauld looks pleased. He sweeps a front paw across the pile, causing gold to cascade out in a wave. **"Approach! Come closer!"** - he smells all of us, hot breath; eyes blink and refocus, repeatedly; then he shouts, **"Give me privacy! All of you leave!"** - Themberchauld even threatens "any sneaky hidden guards" too, with being eaten!

He steps forward, slams his side into part of the chamber and rocks fall, partly blocking the entrance way. He turns to Arturo. "You are good with fire! I could see a big explosion in the docks yesterday. I believe that was your doing."

Yep.

"They're lying to me. Something is deeply wrong. I've known for years now; they feed me, they give me slaves when I ask, they give me treasure; in return I am the Wyrmsmith. I keep the flames going..." - he thinks the Keepers are hiding something from him. He's been wondering, why settle for a trickle of treasure, a handful of slaves and the occasional snack, when he could "as is my right!" rule this entire cave network and all the creatures in it.

Arturo leans into it. "The guards told us not everyone serves the same master - and they said you were the *second* most powerful being, which I was shocked to hea - "

**"- WHAT?! *SECOND* most powerful? I MUST KNOW who is the most powerful! I must know!"**

He gives us a mission! Find this "impostor" who thinks they're more powerful. Find out what the Keepers are hiding. He seems to get distracted by his own thoughts about it might be! Arguing with himself.

Arturo mentions the ethereal plane 'tentacles', which Penny talks about. Themberchauld agrees, claiming to have been visited by a mysterious eye that told him reality was calling apart "like cheese" (!). Themberchauld claims that the Keepers are responsible; sneaking around, hiding something. Start there and uncover their "dastardly secrects" - and report back! Gartokkar in particular has, he claims, been sneaking off, going into caverns - little caverns, where he can't be followed...

We talk of tablets. The dragon misunderstands and thinks we might be trying to strike a deal, to get the tablets in return for our "mission"... (DM roll), but he's in good spirits; and so, that's some kind of strange deal. That said, he's not heard of any of the tablets, so we doubt he can keep up his end.

On Gartokkar, we ask if there's a way for us to have some authority. Does the dragon have anything that can be used to assert the dragon's authority? He digs around in the pile of gold and pulls out a medallion with geometric patterns that look similar to some on the outside of the temple. He gives it to Arturo. It's pretty big! Two hands to hold it, given the weight.

(We get a point of Inspiration for surviving against Themberchauld!)

We head out. Gartokkar immediately comes to us. We speak openly of what happened and show the amulet. He realises we are brazen enough to tell us exactly what was said! So are we going to do it, he asks? Penny shrugs - depends - she mentions the tablets, the "portal", etc., what does he have to say? He says we can't talk here and takes us elsewhere. We follow. A sign says "**Whorlstone Tunnels**". He's *extremely* nervous. The sounds of the city are muted. "What does he know?" he asks us. Gartokkar is challenged in return by Arturo. "Well, he's not crazy; he's getting increasingly difficult to control... The Keepers play a very important role here. We have kept this whole kingdom prosperous. We keep the factories going. We have the Wyrmsmith, of which Themberchauld is only the most recent. ADV persuasion (Penny helping Arturo) 21, just enough.

It seems we are basically facing a counter-offer. "I need you to go to Themberchauld, to come up with something he'll believe. The **Greyhands** have stolen the next Wyrmsmith." "Ah, yes, they stole the egg. We heard." "Yes! Themberchauld should be reaching the end of his tenure - but we can't replace him - not with the egg missing."

He rants about the "Greyhands" a while. They could've taken the egg anywhere. He says, "Do this for me and you will have the Protection of the Keepers Of The Flame. I can get you an audience with the Deep King himself."

Arturo convinces him to take us to the Deep King now! Themberchauld already fancies himself more powerful. Besides, find the egg and the city will pay us 10,000gp - and if the King is able, he will help us find the tablets (he claims).

Arturo says "Yes" (Francesc thinks so too) while Penny is thinking "...and how on earth would we do that?!" and *then* on top of it Arturo asks if he's paying as well as the Greyhands! We'll be talking to them next, after all... Persuasion 26... "OK, fine, 10,000 gold *and*" - he offers a Potion of Invisibility. Arturo takes that right now. He is able to at least open up a bit the Greyhands and where they might be. The Keepers caught who they thought was their leader in West Cleft, close to the Cairngorm Caverns, past the gate. But he never said anything; nobody came to rescue him; he let himself be killed in the end.

OK, so, we head back the way we were going! Towards the other gate and the cavern and - it seems - a stop along the way now.

We get all the way through the town again and leave the town via the far gate. It's *really* busy! Crawling with people; some 500 outcast / derro all living on top of each other in the area where are, initially. Cackling, mumbling, yelling and screaming; it's seems mad. The derro seem crazy, yet seem to function somehow here. It's as if that is their nature, but they work with it. Penny sees no invisible guards now; Arturo has Mage Armour up; Thorin casts PWAT.

On the left, walkways and broken half-stairs lead down with a sign of West Cleft. To the right, a huge cave entrance, one of several in the walls of the cavern there, signed for Caigngorms.

The group vote is to go for the caverns. Thorin leads, Francesc tails.

Francesc, survival 23; a set of wagon tracks with dwarven footprints of maybe three people next to them, lead to a specific cavern and side-track. A second set of prints of numerous light-footed creatures, finely-crafted boots, seem to meet the dwarven footprints and follow in the side cavern. Francesc sees telltale pinpricks of spider feet too. Drow.

Follow. We leave no footprints thanks to Thorin's spell. Thorin, Penny, Arturo, Francesc. Thorin Perception 27. Stealth -Arturo 22; Thorin 23; Francesc 31; Penny (disadv) 16. We follow from cavern to cavern, doing a fairly good job of keeping out of eyesight or earshot. Finally, in the distance, some 150ft away, we hear faint conversation.

Thorin & Penny can understand the Undercommon conversation - but one is in Giant, which Francesc catches. One shouts; "Hand them over. They're not yours to take!" A shouted response, "Get out of our way. We will dispatch you like we have dispatched everyone else. These are ours. We have given blood to get them. Nothing is going to stop us from taking them where they must go. Leave now. Move out of the way!" then in Giant, Francesc hears - "GIVE THEM BACK TO ME!"

We sneak closer, trying to get a feel for numbers and see if we can overhear anything else. We feel like we might be on the giant's side. We're looking for House of Baenra symbols (golden spiders wrapped around an amethyst), or to see what's going on in the Ethereal (but it transpires that the DM's colour of seeing tendrils in that plane is not a free pass to see who's "infected" by the possession via See Invisibility so this doesn't happen!)

Francesc whispers "side with the giant". Arturo suggests Penny just go out and ask if they're House Of Baenra; she says no, then they all argue so she starts to walk out to do it, then he walks out intending to fireball the closely-packed drow! Initiative:

* Arturo 22
* Thorin 18
* Francesc 14
* Penny 13

Penny's barely moved 5ft before Arturo rushes past. Dim light - enough to target a fireball. D16 DEX; potential max damage 34. One failure, 4 successes. There's a priestess, two guards and a mage, plus a giant spider - the spider takes the worst of it. Arturo runs back down the tunnel! Much confused yelling as he retreats.

"How dare you attack us unprovoked! In the name of Loth, die the slow death!" shouts the Priestess, and starts swinging a strange flail. She commands the House Captain to attack.

Thorin shouts in undercommon, "We're on your side, giant!" - and he notices that the Drow are using the fireball as a distraction and are now going to attack the giant and Duergar. He casts *L4* Erupting Earth, trying to not make our own path to the Drow too difficult. The potential damage is also 4d12->34, bludgeoning. This time, all succeed in saves, but still take 17 damage each. He turns into a giant constrictor snake and heads towards the enemy group.

The Drow Captain assesses, fires his hand crossbow at the snake - but crit miss - then tries to jump onto Thorin-snake; he makes it, and from atop the snake's back, pulls a scimitar to slash twice. Both hit, 14, slashing and what would 28-> 14 poison damage.

One of the giant's duergar crew now acts - enlarging, as he runs towards the Drow. He throws his axe (his haft), which is sort of "phasing" in and our of view rapidly, at the Drow priestess; the guard in front of her reacts by lashing out with a whip to try and catch the haft, trying to hook it and take the injury in her place. It works and the guard takes 11 damage.

The Drow mage starts weaving strands of darkness; he summons a shadow demon. "Ha!" says Arturo. Correct bad guys! Except - the shadow demon is only visible to Arturo because it's at the cavern tunnel junction where the rest of us are still hiding. Then the mage tries to hide around a corner! The shadow demon heads for Arturo and claws at him but misses. It's in dim light and hides in shadows. Neither Arturo or Francesc can see it but it's within 10ft of Penny, though, so *she* can see it.

Francesc starts running out to fire at a Drow, but an opportunity attack from the unseen demon causes 17 psychic damage.  At least that makes it visible! Francesc throws everything at her attack on the priestess, despite that; 18 to hit, hits; lowish rolls, but 15 damage even so. Second attack, he gambles with Sharpshooter; it pays off, hits, 22 further damage. The priestess is looking *very* rough. Francesc then sneaks back into the tunnel.

Another duergar does the same thing as the previous, running towards the Drow and enlarging. It takes out a now-huge javelin and throws it at the priestess - but it misses!

Penny shouts "guard your eyes!" and activates the sun sword at full brightness. The shadow demon recoils. She attacks twice, moving to flank it with Arturo. With Divine Smite, she does 21 damage, doubled to 42; it's *almost* destroyed. She takes another swipe without any spells and takes it down. She runs out into the cavern.

The Drow guard who reacted earlier now casts Darkness, over the approaching Duergar, mostly just in front of itself. It runs around the edge of that to see the captain on the snake and uses a bonus action to command the captain to attack the snake and its attack *just* hits, for 7 slashing and 15->7 poison damage.

The third Duergar skirts around the edge of the darkness and we hear the sound of glass vials smashing on the ground; we hear huge explosions and shouting, but can't see what's going on over there.

The priestess casts... Something. Religion and arcana checks group-wise are 11 at most, so we have no idea what's going on, but Thorin-snake senses the Drow on top of him healing. It turns out a 30ft radius sphere of healing has spread out from her that heals all targets for 23!

The spider acts. It throws a web strand out, swings around the darkness towards Thorin-snake and turns into a Drow arachnomancer, along with three smaller spiders! They scuttle up walls, probably preparing to drop on people. A 20ft radius sphere effect hits Thorin-snake, Penny and the Drow captain atop him; CON save, +5 bonus from aura; an *obstructed* terrain area forms. Penny only 16 (nat 4, blows inspiration and rolls nat 3). Thorin 24. Only Thorin makes the save, so Penny takes 22, Thorin-snake 11; Drow captain takes 11 too.

The area is swarming with an insect plague!

The giant is calling out - Francesc understands (though she can't see it) - to **Skoraeus Stonebones**, apparently invoking *something*. It breaks off a chunk of stalactite from above and flings it in the general direction of the Drow guard and Arachnomage. The huge chunk of rock finds its mark, dealing 35 damage. Two spiders on the wall are killed, the Arachnomage is hit and the Drow guard is badly injured too.

Arturo can't see where his in-preparation L3 fireball is going, but it's an unusual spell and line-of-sight doesn't matter. He mentally focuses on the wall of the cave behind where the darkness is; he doesn't want to move, due to the insect plague; this means the fireball must travel on a curved path around the tunnel wall. The DM ruling is that it's a spell attack and at 21, it hits and importantly, the distant Drow mage can't see it being cast. By the time the fireball is in sight, it's too late to Counterspell - otherwise it would've reacted to break the L3 fireball casting. A very solid 33 potential damage.

The third spider up on the wall is taken out. The Drow mage is hit badly but *just* hanging on. The Drow guard is badly hit and the Darkness spell falls. The priestess is not down, but not far off and, finally, the Aracnomancer, who makes the save, manages to hold onto the swarm spell.

With Darkness down, a Duerguar soulblade seems to shimmer into view at the far end of the cavern, quite close to the mage and priestess. It plunges a blade into the mage, killing them.

Thorin-snake exits the insect plague. The Drow captain (dex save) manages to stay on top, so Thorin-snake tries to constrict; 21 to hit, it works, so he's restrained; 2d8+4 -> 15 damage. He starts to drag the Drow captain towards the Duergar. In response, the Captain tries to escape, ACRO DC16, matches it! He gets free, rolling off the snake and further into the cave. As he starts to roll out of range of Thorin-snake, he reacts to re-constrict; it works, and with a nat 20, no less. 4d8+4 -> 20 additional damage. As a bonus action, the Captain calls out to the priestess - "Watch out! There's a soulblade behind you!"

The haft-throwing Duergar has reached the difficult terrain, so instead of going deeper it moves sideways and attacks the restrained Captain with Advantage. 11 more damage.

Francesc is a bit stuck, behind the giant insect swarm, stuck in the tunnel. She looks around and manages - thanks to her extraordinary Sharpshooter abilities - to see through the obscuring swarm, down the tunnel, past Penny and just glimpses of the Drow Captain - so she fires. 27 to hit, hits; 16 damage; she fires again, nat 20! A very solid 21 damage. Now the Captain is finally looking quite rough.

The second Duergar, the stone guard, jumps - right where Penny was going to go !- to attack the Aracnomancer. Hits for 12 damage; the plague spell is maintained. L2 Branding Smite, L2 Divine Smite; the 2d6 is only 3, but the other rolls are OK, total damage 30. That does it! The plague spell fails. She hits again, L1 branding smite too, but this time the damage is only 16.

The Drow warrior next to the Arachnomage attacks and hits the Duergar once, for 8 damage total (thanks in part to poison resistance). As a bonus action, it commands the Captain to attack the snake again; hits, 7 slashing and 14->7 poison damage. Thorin drops back to his Dwarven form, next to the Captain.

The vial-throwing Duergar throws alchemist's fire at the Drow priestess - but it misses! The priestess casts another mass cure wounds, as we were all fearing; herself and her allies gain 18hp each. She holds up a strange statuette and smashes it; she's looking for a D20 - 15 or better for whatever she wanted to make work; but gets 9. The statuette explodes with strange demonic infernal energies, backfiring horribly; she takes 6 psychic damage. Penny, 17-1->16 religion; she was trying to open an abyssal dimension portal to get a greater demon through. Penny shouts, "We *definitely* attacked the right group - she was trying to call forth more demons" (even though Penny heard, when she cast Mass Cure wounds, that she evoked the power of Loth to do so).

The Arachnomancer reaches forward and (by d4 roll) touches the Duerguar. Hits, *46* poison damage, which even halved to 23, takes down the Duergar. (NB, if that D4 had selected Penny, she has exactly 46hp left so would've gone down immediately). It turns into a demon spider and starts to escape; Penny hits with an opportunity attack and another L1 smite; 26 damage.

The stone giant (who we'd almost forgotten for a moment!) moves forward alongside the first Duergar and near Thorin, grabs the Drow guard; it tries DC17 DEX and succeeds; but it still takes half damage - only 8 - as it is thrown across the room! It smashes into the wall not too far from Penny, landing prone. Then the giant throws another rock at the prone Captain; 30 damage, this time; the Drow Captain is *almost* gone. It reaches down in the rubble of erupted earth at its feet **and pulls out two stone tablets**.

Arturo uses movement and Misty Step, to get up to the fallen Duergar. He swiftly pulls out a regular Potion Of Healing and administers it, just before life leaves the body, for 6hp.

The soulblade attacks the priestess - but again, misses! This is one slippery priestess.

Thorin thinks for a couple of seconds - lots of options - then casts Summon Beast, pulling a small beast next to the prone Drow captain. He activates his staff given he's close to melee range. Then his small beast attacks the guard, hitting - which is enough; only 1hp left it turns out.

The Duergar that Arturo bought back turns invisible! It says in Undercommon, "Like the shadows in the night!" (Penny thinks, "really?!").

Francesc moves to get a line on the priestess. She takes a risk on Sharpshooter, 27->22 to hit, definitive hit. A very solid 35 damage. The arrow pierces an amulet on her chest, which shatters; she looks down at it, as it starts to kind of reach out and pull her into a strange tear, that's been created by the amulet. But as she dies, there is a *huge* explosion of necrotic area. *EVERYONE* on the battlefield, except Francesc, is within a 60ft radius; Arturo is at least within range of Penny's aura. DC19 CON save. Arturo just makes it. Penny, dirty 20. Thorin makes it using his Inspiration. Various other successes and failures across the rest of the enemies and friends; Thorin's spider, just close enough to be within Penny's aura range, also gets dirty 20.

Successes -> 19 necrotic; 38 for failures.

Not content with *that* fuckery, Francesc fires again. She goes for the escaping demon spider and despite only 14, that hits the Arachnomage in spider form. 9 damage; it falls.

Penny runs up and takes down the drow guard. The stone giant is very distressed at the downed duergar. She gets to the nearest and brings them up for 10 hands-on. Penny brings up another at a distance. Thorin brings up the alchemist as Penny runs over to the Soulblade and puts in another 10.

Francesc starts to talk to the Giant, as she's the only one who can speak that language. Penny is able to help with suggestions of things to say. Meanwhile, Arturo starts looting, with Thorin's help!

We learn from the giant pretty quickly that there are *seven* tablets, not five. Each is part of a long poem, written by Skoraeus Stonebones. The poem, to those who understand it, **is supposed to reveal the seven locations of the Rod Of Seven Parts**. These giants believe in order and lawfulness - Duergar are likewise very lawful, so support their cause - but a long time ago, there was a manifestation of the Demon Spider Queen (one of the avatars of Loth on another world) representing pure chaos, who destabilised the universes, trying to draw them together into a conglomerate over which she could rule. The Lords Of Akabar came together to create a Rod Of Law to defeat her, as it's meant to banish someone to a prison plane; especially things that can't be killed, as was the case with this Demon Queen; **but this act shattered the rod into seven parts which repelled each other, ending up in seven different planes.**

The poem is written for those who understand The Dreaming and the principles of life and order; such people can decipher the poem and understand locations of gates to these seven planes. There are specific arcane glyphs that must be inscribed on each part of the rod before they could be drawn back together, else an attempt to bring two rod parts together would cause them to repel and once again teleport to other planes, lost forever.

He thinks a transcription of the tablets would be enough to go on, but we'd need all seven tablets for it to be useful. He is not sure why someone might try to steal these tablets.

He will take us to a Speaker who can help us further.

While we're there, we show him our giant books. They're a journal of some kind. Francesc explains where they're from. It's an old, known Dreamer, and old Stone Giant of legend. He didn't know they had existing works left. So since they're helping us, we are happy to give this back to their culture. The giant is happy for us to take transcriptions of the tablets; but he has heard news that the "old bedrooms" (tombs, the old giants go into an eternal state of sleep, not technically dead) have been plundered and tablets are being stolen.

...laptop batteries halt play!

(End of part 33)
