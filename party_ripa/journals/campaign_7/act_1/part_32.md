# RIPA: Part 32
## Session 32 (2024-03-05)
### Gracklstugh, equivalent of afternoon of Day 32

We are in the **Shattered Spire** tavern, in the large Underdark city of **Gracklstugh**. We are looking for Drow who might know something of the stolen stone tablets, because we think that they might hold the key to shutting down the 'doorway' to the demon plane. We have been told that **Ghohlbrorn's Lair** (located in a small cavern beneath the **Blade Bazaar**) might be a good place to stay if we're going to be here "overnight"; a guard captain is asking around for information about the tablets too, so this might be worthwhile. Further, we have learned of some Stone Giants, at the **Cairngorm Cavern** - but the giants are recusive and, if recent troubling stories are to be believed, may have succumbed to the creeping madness that seems to be afflicting the area.

Earlier, Francesc pointed out a table with 2 Drow and 3 Quaggoth slaves. We're on the 4th floor, with romanticism and sculduggery; they're a floor below, across the building from the fights (!).

We figure we'll need to deceive; we don't know if they're demon-worshipping Drow or Loth Drow and we can't tip our hand either way. Thorin will come as our "owners"; Francesc will observe from afar, keeping our table up on the fourth floor; Penny will do the talking, Arturo helping.

The Quaggoth pace around, one positioning themselves between us and the Drow, the other two backing away, growling. The Drow are male and female. The male turns to face us; the female feigns disinterest. We figure, given the Drow society structure, that she's in charge.

"There's plenty of space upstairs."

Penny tries, "strange tidings around these days - talks of demons, gods, tablets and madness." ADV deception, 12,20+5 -> 25. At this, the *female* Drow replies - in Common. "It pains my ears to listen to you butcher my language!"

They comment on things going on with thinly-or-not-veiled disgust. "Aberrant behaviour" in this "Godless city!"

Thorin insight 22. He senses that she's over-compensating! She's too vitriolic about the city - it's practiced; insincere. He asks, "From which city do you hail?"

"You wouldn't know the cities of the Drow."

"No, but we are interested in the area; could we buy you a drink?!"

"We're from Mantle Derrith" (sp?) - Thorin senses an outright lie. Arturo mentions that he knows elves in **Menzo Berranzan**, which is true, but she reacts with scepticism. There's a degree of deflections.

It goes back and forth a while. Penny chips in, "If money is goal, we're in the market for some specific stone tablets." "What kind? Not my speciality; I tend to deal with more... Shall I say... Organic things!" Penny nods, and describes the tablets, which she points out have been known to travel alongside "organic" things. She responds by asking *why* Penny wants them. Penny insight 18+2->20; she's deflecting again, trying to suss us out.

Arturo mentions that we have a contact in the House of Baenra. Perception 19 - a flash of anger spreads across her eyes, momentarily. She delivers the usual evasive/sarcastic response; Arturo reads that and claims they "attacked us in the night like cowards" - "I'm not surprised! That certainly sounds like the default for House Baenra. They had _one_ famous scion and have traded off that fame ever since! Surface-dwelling traders and do-gooders is how I would characterise them." "So where would we find others who are *not* friends of that House?" asks Arturo. She laughs. "Do you know so little of Drow society? No houses are allied. Every house is out to undo any House above them. The Baenras have managed to secure themselves as the Second House of Berranzan, so *eleven* other houses are actively seeking their destruction."

Arturo says to us, deliberately loudly, "I guess there's no information to be gained here" - Penny says, "Apparently, no trades to be made..."

The female Drow tries a bit of a sales pitch on hired muscle, exotic foods, elixirs, and so-on. As we depart she calls, "What *is* your interest in those tablets? You never answered my questions!" Penny shrugs. "You never answered ours". We depart back up to the fourth level to rejoin Francesc, but Thorin doesn't want to rejoin her directly as that would give away our connection to her.

Perception:

* Penny 16
* Arturo 18
* Thorin 19
* Francesc 21

Everyone except Penny `;-)` notices that the Drow female down on the third level has pulled something out of her pocket and is talking to it. A sending stone? No - Francesc spots a spider. She puts her hand behind her, but it's too dark to see where the spider goes. Seems likely that she's telling people about us! The rest of us won't know that until we get back to Francesc.

The other three want to get a message to her without meeting back up but we lack spells for that, so Thorin decides to go to the bar, refill drinks and ask a staff member to pass a message. We don't know about the spider but still suspect a potential future ambush (and really, the higher our profile in many ways the better, so long as we're prepared). They can deliver a drink to her; we find a drink we think she'd kinda hate - a particularly thick, oily brew of Darklake Ale  does the trick - and send:

* "Suspect ambush; do not approach us directly. They know something but were evasive."

The message reaches Francesc. She nervously tries the stout... Very heavy, smokey, malty-heavy, almost a rye bread flavour. It's actually not bad! She figures out a way to get a reply back:

* "Female Drow sent a message via a spider - I'm sure she is watching you. I'll hang back and cover you from afar".

Arturo, meanwhile, is feeling quite unsafe. WIS save. 7. He starts to feel a bit paranoid - the exchange earlier went exactly as he thought. Evasion leading to danger. He's becoming convinced that his "cover" has been blown, somehow. A feeling of imminent danger. It reminds him of when we were with the Mummy Lord (mechanically he's hyper-alert, so perception rolls are with *advantage* but insight rolls are with *disadvantage*).

We finish up our drinks (as two separate groups) and decide to head to our suggested accommodation. If we don't get attacked on the streets, we'll be able to get indoors and fewer people can attack us at one time (though Arturo points out that fireballs are much more useful outside!)

The Blade Bazaar we're told is back past the docks; we have to retrace our steps then keep going towards that area and find the entrance where the Lair can be found. Thorin wants to keep in busier areas, so we head in the direction of where we'd seen people running in the prior ruckus - by stalls and market areas, up against main gates on the whole. Guards and workers are clearing debris from whatever went down here earlier. We don't recognise anyone. Francesc sees us leave the tavern and follows stealthily, at a distance, trying to hide wherever cover provides; in shadows if there are no people, else hiding in plain sight in crowds. ADV Stealth: 23. The rest of us move slowly, keeping aware. Perception:

* Arturo (ADV) 20
* Thorin 20
* Penny 8

Gates to the rest of the city are manned by guards who turn away anyone who's not Duergar. We have tokens to get in there in theory - but don't need to. We continue to Blade Bazaar. It is almost chaotic; a busy night market. It's got unusual and sometimes disturbing things for sale - weapons, armour, wagons all good; but also animals and slaves. Perception:

* Arturo (ADV) 8
* Thorin 11
* Penny 8

It's... Very crowded! Even so, the stalls look interesting. Thorin says we've a gem-encrusted goblet to sell but Arturo reminds us that minerals and metals aren't valuable down here. We check our inventory but don't have much to trade; Francesc has the black dragon scales, but she's in hiding. We're not sure what we want, but Thorin does think his shield could do with some work. Perception 23; nothing magical in sight; the ones he sees are ornate but probably no more protective than his thick, well-made bark shield.

Penny tries asking for the entrance that gets to the Lair; persuasion 16; that's good enough, and a passer-by points to a mushroom cap of sorts. Thorin insight 19, it's legit - and then he notices the "Ghohlbrorn's Lair" sign above the mushroom!

The entrance is only wide enough for one of us at a time. Thorin first, Arturo next, Penny last. Perception:

* Thorin 11
* Arturo ADV 20
* Penny 19

Thorin sees not much of interest! It's the right place. Arturo, in the middle, with a high roll, sees - he's sure! - out of the corner of his eye, climbing onto a doorway, a spider. Penny is last; she sees Arturo spotting something - and then sees him try to hit something with his staff! Attack roll 6. Um. No. Penny's not sure (via passive insight 12) why he did that; he's been a bit erratic lately... Thorin (via passive insight 18) realises he was attacking *something*, looks closely but can't see anything. Arturo claims it was a spider.

The entrance leads directly to a spiral ramp descends some 20ft in a wide arc. We descend, exiting into an underground lobby. A Duerguar sits behind a heavy oak desk that looks very precious. Wood, down here! "Three rooms? Room for three? or a combination?" (We confer...) "Big room!" says Thorin. "Big private room or a dormitory?" "Private!" "We have a room for three and a room for 6" - Thorin opts for the room for 3, not wanting to give anything away. "How many nights?" "Just one!" "We're running a promotion where if you stay for two nights you get the third for half price!" Thorin declines. It's 15sp for the night. "Towels are 2 silvers extra". There's a 3gp bond which we get back if we "leave everything in one piece". That's actually a good idea - we're surprised, if relieved, that it's not more commonplace.

The room, accessed from the middle of a corridor - 6 separate corridors leading off the reception desk - is strange. No windows, but there's a fresh air tube. It's quite small - but big enough for a spider. The room is very defensible otherwise - a doorway with a bolt across, a small open space in the middle 5ft x 5ft, and three beds against the walls.

"Should've gone for the 6 person" says Penny.

We realise we haven't eaten, all day. We don't really want to leave and risk attack, so we use rations.

Francesc sees us go inside. She hangs around to see if anyone else goes in. ADV Stealth: 17; perception, 19. Lots of shifty people! But this is a city and plenty of people have seemed shifty. None seem to be paying attention to the entranceway, though. She sees no spiders. She waits several minutes, then is just about to go inside - when a voice says, "What are we watching for?" The voice is coming from below, about hip height. Looking down, she sees a very short, scraggy-looking, pale-skinned, female dwarf that looks very underfed. She has wild hair and a big grin. She holds a broken bottle as if it is precious and plays with huge glass beads on a necklace around her neck. She wears a backpack with a giant bone sticking out of it.

"I'm just watching to see what I can see!"

"What are we looking for in particular?"

"Anything exciting!"

"Invisible things?"

"I'm looking for clouds."

"You're an idiot! There are no clouds down here."

"Have you ever seen one?"

"No! There's no atmosphere down here that could generate clouds - what - what is wrong with you?"

"Fine!" - she moves 3 feet away and stands there. Francesc, perception 15; it seems like people walking around *actively* don't see her - like people actively "don't see" a beggar. So Francesc asks, "What are *you* looking for?"

"Signs. Demonic signs. Signs of possession?"

"Can you describe a sign? What should I look for?" - ADV perception (else it would've been a zero!) - only 7. The dwarf asks, "What do you mean? Have you never seen demonic possession before?" "I'm down here looking for clouds! What do *you* think?" "Well I know *you're* not possessed. You're just being rude because you think I'm stupid."

Then she points to a merchant. "See how he keeps turning to talk to someone during trading, as if getting a second opinion?" - Francesc can see; there's nobody there; he seems to be talking to nobody. Francesc asks, "So does he see someone there?" "I've spoken to him. He claims it's his brother who is there but invisible..." - she holds up a gem - "...I have an ability to see the invisible, but there's nobody there" (Francesc insight 15, it looks like a Gem Of Seeing and legit, though why this strange dwarf has one is anyone's guess).

Francesc asks for more information and is asked to talk to another merchant - "Ask to buy something, then ask to sell." Francesc tries to keep an eye on the entrance to the Lair but complies. There's a break in trading. The duergar looks excited. "I'd like to buy something!" says Francesc. "What would you want to *buy* something? What's wrong with you? What do you think this is? A buying place?" "Well then I'd like to sell something!" "Oh, well then! What would you like to sell?" "This plushie!" says Francesc, holding out the lion plushie (from our teleport collection). He examines it, seeming unsure. "I will give you... 30 gold." "30 gold? 40." "40? 50!" "60!" "I don't have 60." "OK, 55." - he hands Francesc 55gp. "Now, do you want to buy something?" asks the man, but when Francesc tries, he gets very angry and starts shouting. She retreats!

(Later Arturo comments, "So you took advantage of a mentally ill man?")

It's certainly not normal behaviour! The dwarf explains that this started about 2 weeks ago. He's done nothing but buy junk and not sold anything. She asks, "Do you know what the rules are here? They worship a god of minimalism and - well, it's sort of frowned upon to be flamboyant, to wear jewellery and showy things. So that's why it's strange to see *that*..." - and points to two Duergar manning a stall that seems to cast various pieces of cast metal, but they wear bright pins of birds and cherries, glittery things in their hair, beads in beards.

Now she tells Francesc to wait until the guards come around. When the see the two Duergar, they drag them around from the stall and start beating them!

This strange dwarf thinks this started about 2-3 weeks ago and has been getting worse. She thinks it's an influence of a demon lord called "**Demogorgon**". She pulls out a piece of parchment, which looks like a kind of skin. She unfolds it, to reveal a drawing of a two-wolf-headed creature with long whip-like tails, a strange giant werewolf-like being. "Some of the more... Touched... Derro, have been hearing _calls_ from the lake. I'm pretty sure it's this demon; thankfully, we seem to be resistant to its effects." "For now!" "I think we've kind of lost enough of a grip on reality to be affected - oh! I have to go." She runs off. (Francesc surmises that "we" just meant herself).

It's been at least half an hour since Francesc separated from us. In the room, we're getting nervous. Francesc meanwhile goes into the Lair to get a look at the layout. She realises there's no bar where she could hang out. "I'm after a room" she says. "But you don't need a bed, do you?" "No" "That'll be... 2 silvers."

Francesc is taken to a door; a small room with a few breathing holes and a round meditation mat in the middle. It's barely 4ft x 4ft. The door has no lock.

In the room, we wonder what Francesc might be doing. Penny insight 11; Francesc is probably annoyed... After about an hour Arturo takes matter into his own hands, intending to go to the mushroom entrance and waves at the crowds at the bazaar! Perception ADV 15; as he walks along he is so sure, as he exits the door the room, that he walks into a bit of a cobweb.

(Chance die are rolled)

Arturo is waving his hands around at the cobweb, but by chance sees Francesc leaving her room to go back upstairs. She hears him calling and turns to see him holding his staff, next to door. "Help me find a spider!" he says. Francesc adv pereption 24. Hiding in a dark corner of the hallway is indeed a spider. Arturo tries to grab it with Mage Hand; unarmed attack with spellcasting mod; 19. He grabs it; the spider in sort of encased in the magical hand. Arturo and Francesc go back into the room, mage hand in tow.

Francesc brings us up to date on everything she learned and vice versa. She apologises to Thorin for selling his plushie but she got fift - forty give gold for it... Thorin insight 16 vs deception 12; he finds out it was 55gp (but lets Francesc keep the 10gp difference anyway).

The spider does not seem particularly intelligent; it's not magical it seems. Thorin tries to cast Animal Friendship through his staff. WIS 16, but it does well and is not charmed. It glares at him with all 8 eyes! He tries again with the staff. Nope! Thorin tries a *third* time! *This* time it works, though this spider will be very annoyed when it finally recovers control. He casts Speak With Animals and asks why it's following him and what it was doing with the Drow.

It was asked to just follow us and leave a beacon at the door. "Have you left the beacon?" "Well I *had* but then this one" - points to Arturo - "walked into it!" - so its "web beacon" is no longer active. "Why do you do this for them?" "Because my queen, my god queen, has asked me to?" - it doesn't really seem to understand the question. "Have you seen any stone tablets?!" asks Thorin - ADV persuasion 18. "I haven't seen any stone tablets, no". "Have you heard about any?" "I recall hearing about it from within the pocket in which I live. I heard some people asking about stone tablets." (That turns out to be just us, earlier today!)

We figure if we *want* to get ambushed, we need to let the spider set up its beacon.

We hatch a plan. The spider weaves its beacon on Francesc's room and Penny casts Alarm on it. Then we'll know when the room is being attacked. But Animal Friendship lasts 24 hours, so to avoid the risk of the spider telling the Drow what happened, we ask it to wait with us.

Arturo investigates. While all the tunnels do converge on the reception door, as if radial, there are other connecting tunnels around the circumference and from our room to Francesc, those are a good option to get around without alerting whoever is in the middle.

The spider is persuaded, so sets up the beacon and Penny sets up Alarm.

We lie in wait. Amounts to a short rest.

2.5 hours later - the alarm goes off. "It's on!" says Penny! We hurry along the tunnels - three of us on the circumference, and Francesc via the radial tunnel. As three of us run, Arturo casts Bless; Thorin casts Guidance on Arturo. ATHL checks:

* Penny 11
* Thorin 15
* Francesc 17
* Arturo 20

Arturo gets there first. He sees a male Drow in spider silk armour, running back up the corridor away from the open door of the (empty) room. Francesc going the other way meets him head on, at the junction of the corridor and lobby - where sadly a dead Duergar lies. (Thorin sees things in the distance as Arturo casts; Penny is too slow).

Arturo tries Mind Whip. INT DC16 save; the Drow fails. He chooses to keep running (taking 3d6->10 damage). Francesc tries to shoot his legs to stop him running more (but keep him alive). 27! Bang on target. 13 more damage. He's unsteady but keeps going; she fires again; but this one misses.

Thorin runs closer. He's well within 60ft; he casts Entangle. STR16 save; the Drow fails, just! He's captured. There's a 20ft square area of difficult terrain mostly on a corner where the Drow stands.

Penny gets up behind Thorin and tries a javelin, but in her hurry it goes very wild. She shouts, "Stand down or die!", but intimidation is only 13. She sees the Duergar but is too far away to do much at this point. Francesc checks the Duergar, medicine 20, bleeding out from a deep cut to the neck but not dead yet. She casts Healing Spirit, grating healing to the Duergar. That stabilises them, the wound on their neck closing.

Arturo decides to twin Polymorph, imposing disadvantage on the WIS 16 save, to turn himself into a giant spider and the Drow into a small spider. The Drow changes.

Francesc is worried that others must be coming. She wants to get past the entangled area, but it's not magically difficult terrain so Long Strider gets her onto the other side easily enough. On the other side, she checks. She stars stealthing up the ramp. Nobody up top, either.

The Drow-spider makes a run for it!

Thorin perception 18. He sees the spider disappear into the entanglement plant growth and drops concentration. The plants wither and vanish; the spider is running for the ramp. He tries Dominate Beast. WIS 16 save. Arturo sees the Drow-spider start to resist the effect, but has no metamagic left and can't do anything; the Drow-spider keeps going. He calls to Penny.

Penny runs after the spider calling up to Francesc to watch out for it, while cast See Invisibility. Interestingly, she sees nothing invisible! What's going on? She shouts up to Francesc, "...and I can't see anything invisible, either!"

Arturo-giant-spider throws a web at the Drow-spider, which hits, but the Drow-spider seems unaffected. It just crawls up on top of the web strands. Instead, he uses his fast speed to crawl up onto the ceiling - he gets above it, but about 10ft behind its position.

Francesc can just about see the spider but an attack would be at a disadvantage. She grabs a tankard and tries to put it upside down onto the spider! Dex-based attack is 19; she catches it easily. This gives the rest of us time to catch up. Francesc if anyone has paper as Arturo turns back into himself, but then the rescued Duergar receptionist gives us a sheet from the guest book! "*That* thing came in. I asked it wanted a room; it said no; I asked why it was here and it slit my throat!"

We take the spider back to the room, which is a squeeze as-is with four of us, but Thorin now tries Speak With Animals and tries to get it talk.

(Francesc and Penny keep alert, on watch; Penny can see into the ethereal plane with her spell up, and doesn't see anything 'per se' but sees strange filaments in that plane which don't look... Normal. Religion ADV 16, it looks like strands, as if of fungi, that spread. They seem active and moving - creeping towards the four of us, the inn keeper and towards most of the other rooms here. Penny says, "There's something coming for us - slowly - from another plane; it's all over everywhere; I think it's this madness - a visual expression of it."

We'll go mad ourselves eventually, if we don't solve the problem or get out of here.

Meanwhile, Thorin's second use of Dominate Beast works this time. The spider says, "I am an agent of the High Priestess of Loth. I'm tasked with killing anyone connected to the Demon Worshipping Cults." Arturo asks why it thought *we* were such types. "I was just told to find the sigil of the spider." "But what about the innocent guy on the front desk?" "Innocent?! It's a Duergar! There are no innocent Duergar."

So perhaps the Drow to whom we spoke *was* on Loth's side.

"What was your plan, knowing there were three of us?" "I have three poison blades". Penny asks, "Where can we find the female Drow that hired you?" and Thorin translates. "When I finish, I'm supposed to return to Shattered Spire to be paid." "How much?" "3000 gold". Thorin asks, "Did you get a down-payment?" "Yes" "How much?" "150 gold. Standard. I spent it, on my blades!"

Thorin asks if the spider knows anything else. "I'm a mercenary. I don't ask questions. I get given jobs and I do them."

We figure they'll definitely kill us when he turns back into a Drow. Arturo suggests going as far as we can into the lake in the hour until it turns and throw it into the lake!

Penny asks about stone tablets. People have talked about them. Some other Drow. It's vague; "They weren't paying enough! They wanted me to kill people who were following them." "Do you know where they went?" "No. But I spoke to them when they were sneaking into the city - crossing the Furrow in disguise - I believe they were headed that way because nobody can follow them." "Why's that?" "Because only Duergar are allowed past those gates."

Arturo asks his name. It's "**Ixlyll**".

There's talk of killing this assassin - barricading him into Franesc's room with Moonbeam, or something. Penny is uncomfortable. Perhaps go back to the Spire, show the woman Drow as a "show of good faith" that we didn't kill the assassin, we're not demon worshippers and only kill demon-worshipping Drow, etc. etc.!

On the way out the Duergar in the lobby gives us our money back *and* lets us take the 6-person room for free. Win.

We return to the Spire, with two spiders! It takes about 10 minutes. As we walk in, we see the female Drow regarding, us, very cool. She says something to the male Drow, about "I told you that elf was one of them!"

Penny launches into the story. Persuasion, dirty 25.

The female Drow says - "well, first things first! My spider and the assassin please!" - we hand her a spider in each hand! She puts one into her pocket. She throws the other spider at her slaves. She crushes the spider as she does, causing it to turn into an assassin; they savagely rip into the assassin, who is horribly injured - but not killed. "Your reputation is ash" she says. We get the feeling that our attempt at mercy might not have worked quite how we wanted... He flees.

She says, "take a seat! Let's start again."

She's sceptical. *She* has heard that the tablets *opened* the gateway. We think it closes them. We say we're not 100% sure who is right, but we'd ask the giants at the Cairngorm caverns. "But that's beyond the wall!" she says, implying the gate; "Oh, we're more resourceful than you think!" says Penny.

At one point she says "You're wanted people". "Oh! Thank you!" says Arturo, apparently genuinely touched (!). It turns out that the demon worshipping Drow have spread a story that there are four demon-worshipping adventurers. That makes us a target for Drow cavern guard. We also describe the encounter with one of the scions of the House of Baenra; she hears with glee that we killed a scion, but is annoyed that we brought them back. "It's more important to have leverage!" says Arturo, but she argues that males in that House are unlikely to keep their word.

We enquire more about the story of the stone tablets being used to keep the gate *open* rather than closed; "Several matrons" she says "tell this story. Even the Matron of my own House". She says that the tablets were taken through the gates. She can't give a direction, but can describe the people who took them through. Thorin insight 26; she believes what she's telling us. If she's lying, it's because she's misinformed and unaware.

"Your first mistake is assuming that you're supposed to be tracking Drow" she says. "They were transported that way, but needed to get past the gate so they were handed to a group of Duergar who are now carrying the tablets. Apparently they're carrying it deeper into the caverns - into the Old Places."

Thorin wonders if the tablets really *were* to close the gateway, then these people would try to destroy them. Thinking about, she suggests that they're taking the tablets to Themberchaud, the dragon of the city, to be destroyed as they're otherwise hard to destroy. So perhaps we're right. **We figure we need to catch them up, but we're a long way behind.**

She says: "They wouldn't want to travel openly with them, so they must be careful" she said. "They must be going at the change of shifts, during the quiet times. They went past those gates two days ago. It's not easy to get to the Keepers Of The Flame - they're very insular and paranoid at the moment; something seems to be wrong - they're being unusually secretive about *something*. I don't have any more information. Things that happen on the other side of the Wall are at best conjecture; rumour; whispers and exaggerations."

Arturo suggests that she perhaps stays back to intercept other tablets. But the Drow says she doesn't want to stay too long. She says no; she "feels like she might be going a *little* mad..." - Penny's See Invisibility sight lets her see the tendrils. Many here, but (insight nat 20+2 -> 22) **the more drunk the table the further back tendrils are from them**. Penny therefore concurs that she shouldn't dwell, but as long as she's not too drunk to function, the Drow will be better off. It seems that the tendrils are drawn to more intelligent beings, which is perhaps why animals don't - yet! - seem affected.

As a closing line, Thorin asks if there is anything else she can do to help? "You were going to give the assassin 3000gp, after all" - Penny helps to negate the persuasion disadvantage (!) - he rolls 19. "I can give you something a bit more useful!" - and she hands us a tiny vial of liquid, inky black swirling over quicksilver. "Don't drink it! It will kill you" she says. "Throw this on the ground if you need to make a hasty escape" - it's the equivalent of a Potion Of Darkness.

So that's it. We leave, and head towards the gate. We figure we'll find an inn on that side - it should be much safer to sleep there.

At the gate the guards react predictably, holding up great axes. They look incredulous, as if there was no way we could possibly not know the rules! We show the insignia. They're *very* surprised. A senior guard is fetched. They can't believe it. An even more senior guard is fetched! They can't deny it... Thorin can understand most of their Duergar-native speech.

Very reluctantly, they let us through. We are stared at as we enter, unsurprisingly. What's interesting though is that, despite the stares, Duergar are civil; we're in the city so somehow, we *must* be allowed; they actively avoid us. We notice that things here are not normal either. More adornment, even the guards on *this* side harass people for it; so the madness is here too, not just beyond the wall. We see clerics, people with stone symbols; others with flame symbols; there seem to be acrimony between them. We even overhear a story of a rampaging giant that's "escaped" (come down from the Caverns) who had to be chased away. "We need to speak to the Stone Guard! Why aren't they doing their job?!" - and so-on.

Eventually we manage to corner a couple of Duergar to ask about an inn! They tell us about an older inn that's supposedly more welcoming.

The inn does take us in. We get room, get a light supper, and, at long last, rest in one room.

CHA saves - with +5 bonus - Penny 21, Thorin 24, Francesc 24, Arturo 26. Everyone else sleeps soundly; this time it's Penny's turn to get an inkling of the strange sense of manic, maniacal glee the others experienced before, but it doesn't make her less rested - she's just more aware of it all.

(End of part 32)
