# RIPA: Part 24
## Session 24 (2023-12-12)
### Day 26

It was an exciting night in The Bluewater Inn, after an attack by a group of four who seemed to believe they were part of the Oracle's prophecy instead of ourselves. But for having found our actual names in the book at Candlekeep, we might well have believed them - the descriptions / codes on the code sheet we found early in our quest are sufficiently vague for doubt.

Thanks to the temple guards offering to keep watch for what remains of the night, we sleep in a while to awake refreshed and healed from the early morning combat.

### 9:30am

We wake up naturally; very little light comes through the very heavy curtains. It would be possible to sleep even in the middle of the day.

"Breakfast!" says Penny, Francesc already being awake; a knock on the door - Arturo, thinking the same. We all head downstairs. We eat light; toast with spread, some dips, dates. What are we going to ask the oracle?

* What's going on with this "Vallin" cult? Kidnapping kids etc.?
* Why are our names showing up in text, especially in the crystal Canopic Being - creating a Mummy Lord...
* What *is* the prophecy that they were trying to force to come true?
* Maybe ask about the extraplanar stuff learned about in Helm's Hall, but we're not sure *what* to ask there.

### 10am

The cube hangs in the middle of this depression, which sits deep in the mountains. We can look back a distance to see a carved "channel" through the mountains. An exit path? Meltwater from the mountains feeds this oasis - it's quite lush. Along the middle of the village runs an ornate, official, rectangular paved area, that looks very 'official', lined by low, flat-roofed buildings some 2-3 storeys tall at most. Then there's a very wide set of steps, a flat area and another even wider set that lead up to a raised Babylonian-style large building that we think is the main temple. The club hangs behind it, a centrepiece of the town.

We head towards the temple. It's sedate in town; quiet, people going about private business. Once we get to the courtyard at the first flight of stairs, though, it's very busy - many people, at least 30. Penny (perception 13+7) notices two kinds of people. Some are in flowing robes, a canary yellow; then there are people in normal, varied clothing - though nothing fancy, on the whole. We might be the most fancily dressed people here!

The robed people seem to be coordinating things. They are talking to the other dressed people. The robed-wearers have jewellery, we see, with symbols we've seen with the Cult of Valen early on, or a variant of it; some have one eye, some two or three. Rank? Thorin doesn't care and marches onwards up the next set of stairs. Immediately we're chased after by robed figures - "wait, wait, where are you going?!" Thorin bluffs - "The oracle is expecting us?" "Be that as it may, we *do* need to vet everyone before the enter the House Of The All-Seeing Eye".

"Who are you and where have you come from?" - we just tell the truth. We're told to wait. Usually a symbol or portent of arrival appears in a scrying pool, but it didn't for us... They go to check. Ah! Our amulets. They work *very* well.

After a while people emerge. One has the three-eye symbol. They've "seen us" in the pool - visions of us, presuably - and they say they'll escort us in immediately. Penny goes first - as people debate order! - Thorin second, Arturo third, Francesc fourth.

A *huge* entranceway - above it the largest emerald any of us have ever seen - marbled floors, tiled walls with a strip along that has a green eye every 10ft or so. We reach a tall wall with a carved and painted relief showing the three eyes, connected in a triangle, with various circles and rings emanating out. In front is a large circular pool, with a few of these robed-presumed-priests resting around, reclining, looking at the pool; they occasionally stir it with shepherd-like crooks. They look up at us and say to our guides, "Yes! That is them". One comes forward and asks our guides if they have the notes about us?! We don't know what that means but it seems to cause surprise. It seems very unusual to just walk up and walk straight in! "I guess someone should tell Alessia maybe?" says one, "I think it's too late! We just have to take them in" says another. Then one at the pool yelps and points at the pool. "New pictures!" and as the priests start to look, the four people who brought us in and clerk who'd been asking about paperwork usher us onwards.

Arturo feigns tripping over to delay us a moment while Francesc tries to see what is in the pool - perception 25. It shows a face of a tiefling with long red hair, wearing very fancy firey clothes. Not someone we know.

We're taken around and behind the area we were at, then up zig-zag stairs onto a raised platform. It looks down to an open centre - the temple is "hollow", with a shaped well in the middle that would seem to fit the base of the cube were it to descend into that space. The platform we're on, from memory, would be about right to face the doorway we saw last night. "I take it none of you have ever visited the oracle before? Have you ever been in the cube?" we're asked. Nope!

We're given strict instructions:

* Once we get to the door head straight to the portal
* A tall rectangle under the symbol of Savras which should open as we approach
* Do not walk backwards and fall out, we'll die!
* Do not touch anything else.

We learn that Alessia has been in the cube as Vallin's attendant for several years. Some people are allowed to stay and study within and may be there a long time too. Months, maybe. But they do say they're not sure if time passes the same way in there - they've never been!

We're told to go one at time and step forward off the edge of the platform. Penny steps forward and there's a disorientating lurch - CON save 13, just about OK - then a giddy or dizzy feeling of not knowing where "up" is. The rest of us see Penny kind of tilt backwards until almost horizontal, then float up towards the doorway - orientated apparently at an angle that makes sense for it. Thorin next - CON 17 - all good. Arturo - CON 26 - very much no problem! In addition, perception 12, he overheard just behind him one of the attendants say, "Strange - he wasn't blue in the pool!" Francesc last - CON 5! She does what could best be described as falling in zero-G. Spinning, or feels like it; nauseous...

...as Penny gets to the top, entering the doorway in the side of the cube. Now it feels like solid ground. She looks behind herself but with that CON-13, feels a very strong vertigo - the whole world behind appears to be at a tilt! She looks back down the corridor. She walks forward to give Thorin and Arturo room. Arturo looks back to see Francesc kind of flailing along, almost crawling along the invisible "ground". Fearing she's going to miss the door, Arturo uses a telekenetic shove - she lands just inside the doorway, prone.

It's less a corridor as Penny had expected and more of an entrance hall, 10ft wide by 15ft deep maybe. There's a portal at the end. Thorin via passive perception, sees writing on the walls - runes, heiroglyphs; not a language he recognises. Penny steps towards the portal; a line of light appears around the edges, but it's just darkness with some purple motes in the middle. For all we know this is just an obfuscated doorway into the cube, because the cube is huge, so we've no reason to believe this is a portal to another place or dimension.

We all step through.

A moment of disorientation, then 'fog' lifts from our eyes. We're stood alongside each other somehow, not in a row now. A woman with dark skin and hair with a thick, dark braid, wearing yellow and green with a sash, a necklace with two large pendants, key-shaped, stands in front of us. "You've arrived!" She says she was told to expect us, and maybe prepare somewhere for us to stay as we might be here for a while. "I am Alessia. Welcome to the Oracle's Sanctum. How can I help?" We ask to be taken to the Oracle, but she's not been instructed to take us there yet - she was going to show us where we can leave our stuff, while we wander around and explore the "rare gift you've been given - access to this place". Arturo asks if there are any other guests in the Sanctum right now - yes; one, she can't remember where he is, maybe the Oracle - three people probably - Xemru Thal came through a few weeks ago, might be working with the Oracle right now - Zeren Zoradius too, a mage - Mayastan too. She thinks there might be Okuzor here but "I haven't seen that tiefling barbarian in a long while". Alessia thought Mayastan ("the dragonborn") was outside, but she's not found him around lately and wonders if he's with the Oracle. He might be in another room she describes which apparently blocks all scrying.

The list of familiar names makes the whole party feel like we kind of want to make our way to the Oracle right now, but wisely, Arturo asks more questions. Alessia mentioned it being "a gift" to be here; what is there to see? "We are floating in the middle of eternity. This room has walls, but beyond..." - and we see corridors beyond that are walled by strange, wispy clouds, or transparent walls of some kind; hard to discern. "There's the hall of mirrors - the mirrors of fortunae - some supplicants spend time there trying to contemplate all their futures and possible pasts. There's the testing chamber, which hasn't been used in a while - powerful forces there, things that speak to people who have destinies. There's a scrying pool, though it seems to be an unusual weather pattern in there right now and nobody has been in for a year or two - a place for visions, though. There's of course the Grand Hall, in the middle; you know, the cube you came through - like a small replica of that. Worth exploring, just be careful not to fall down! There's a ledge but no railings. There is a meditation room and of course the Observatory Of Fate, which is Vallin's private sanctum." We're allowed there if she's meeting us in person rather than speaking to us through one of the "voices of Vallin". Alessia says she's never been in there herself. "Lastly, there's the Observatory Of History where you can see and relive moments in the past." She also directs us to the room we've been allocated and lets us know that the private sanctum is "through" the Great Hall, but that's all we know about that.

We're left to decide what to do. Francesc says, straight off the bat, "Let's go to the Sanctum!" - so we head towards the great hall, as the sanctum is the other side of it. Francesc heads off in front... DEX save! 10... Inspiration burned; 28! Walking into a room, she narrowly avoids something that brushes past her that feels sharp, hanging from ceiling to floor, becomes very disorientated again; a 20ft room, but she sees herself reflected a million times. Ah! The Hall of Mirrors.

Penny got distracted by a corridor to the right, into a diamond-shaped room with a ceiling rising to a point, but with a flat floor. In the middle is a square, set at a 45 degree angle; a crystal dias upon it. Perception only 11! Strangely bright in here, a light source apparently in the middle of dias. Almost like sunlight. Crystal walls, too. Penny thinks this is the trials room maybe. Thorin and Arturo join.

Francesc remembers that Mayastan might be in here, according to Alessia, because nobody can scry/see in there - so she wonders if she can search here... But based on brushing ehe sharp edge before, it feels like this is a very bad place to be at all clumsy! It would take a while to figure out the place. It might help if there were two people, to help at least figure out right-and-left amongst all the confusing reflections! She tries drawing her sword and taps lightly on a mirror. The mirror is close by - the *entire room* seems to ripple and she takes 9 psychic damage, as a sense of direction and physical space is assaulted even more by the ripple effect.

Francesc backs out, comes back down the corridor to find us and updates us. Mayastan might be in there. As this happens, Arturo suddenly notices something - perception 21 - he can kind of block out the bright shining light's glare and sees a slight crack runs from one corner to the other of the dias. Embedded in the middle appears to be a beautiful, ornate, old-looking shiny sword hilt, probably platinum; hilt-only. A gem is set in the crosspiece and this seems to be the source of the light. Arturo tells Penny she should yank out the sword!

Penny looks down, shielding her eyes and wathcing her feet, to get close, hoping to close her eyes and use her Blindsight. Getting close, she *feels* in her mind a kind of psychic thrumming, or pulsing. She feels like she might be slowing down and indeed everyone else sees her apparently moving in slow motion... She tries engaging Divine Sense to detect evil things up close; nothing in the room; a faint influence of some kind at the edge of a 60ft range to the left, though, something evil; but there's good coming from in front. She turns and moves that way. There seems to be an exit there. The presence is a fair distance away. She calls back to tell the party. Thorin suggests it's a set of challenges we need to pass. Penny decides to head down that corridor. Thorin meanwhile investigates the dias more closely again, but Francesc chases after Penny.

Thorin notices the crack in the dias. The sword has been embedded in there; he figures the only way to get it out would be to break the dias. He considers his options - at which point Arturo telekentically shoves him! His movement is slowed, but when someone *else* moves him, he seems to move at full speed.

Penny feels like evil is coming to the right, but the distance is maintaining the same. Just a long way away. A faint distant aura. It's not moving, it's just far. She heads down the corridor going that way - a fair distance; a short section at 90 degrees, then turns back the same way. A fourth (of five) divine sense; the evil is within range! 50ft. A field - an area. The area in general starts to feel like a corrupted, once-hallow space.

Meanwhile, Thorin tries to smash the dias with his staff! Attack - 18, matches AC. 12 damage. It cracks more, but hasn't shattered. The thrumming in his head increases in frequency. Arturo tries to mend cracks to stop it shattering completely, but leaves cracks around the sword - they both want to try and extract the hilt without the whole thing breaking. Arturo - investigation during mending, 15. As he's waiting for the spell to take effect, he notices that the cracks are slowly sealing up themselves anyway! He lets Thorin know. An attempt to use an earth moving effect doesn't work.

Penny and Francesc advance and peek around a corner. There is a pair of doors, behind which is most likely the sense of evil. We go to the doors and open them.

There's an impenetrable, thick cloud or fog. It has a strong smell, musty and old, corrosive maybe; it hovers over a fetid-looking pool that has an ornate area. "The pool of visions!" says Francesc. "She said there was 'weird weather' in there." Perception Francesc 19; at the far end of the room, she momentarily spots two glowing, yellow eyes. "Something in there with glowing eyes!" she says. She tries casting Faerie Fire...

...and Thorin wildshapes into an Aurochs and tries to charge. With a telekenetic shove from Arturo to help, he charges... Adv attack, nat 3, nat 3! 10 total. Complete miss. Backs up and tries again. This time, dirty 20 attack; he hits, the dias shatters and the hilt of the sword *hovers in the air*. Thorin-Aurochs motions at the hilt with his face! Arturo uses his mage hand to move it - but the moment it moves, a strange psychic blast seems to come from it, emanates into the mage hand which shimmers and then shatters. Arturo is unharmed; the hilt falls to the ground. Both of them then get a strange sense of not being alone. Initiative!

...and meanwhile, Faerie Fire via slugs. The spell heads towards the creature and just immediately falters and fails - the entity doesn't even seem to dodge. Initiative! Ah. Us:

* Francesc 18 (+3 for Penny's aura)
* Penny 9 (+3 for aura)

Dias:

* Arturo 14
* Thorin-Aurochs 2

Francesc sees the spell "sluice" off the entity and just for a moment, sees a creature illuminated that seems to be made entirely out of crystal. The eyes glow yellow and there is a chuckling; a female voice; "Huh. What are you doing? Why are you here. You're not supposed to be in here..." Francesc responds, "We thought there was evil in here!" "Yes. This pool is corrupted and I'm trying to fix it. Why did you just attack my voice?!" "Evil. Evil creature, yellow eyes..." "I see...!" - Francesc insight nat 20->26. This creature is completely unthreatened by her, but if she attacked it, it would attack back. It's not being hostile to us though. Francesc stands down.

Arturo screams out, "OUR LIVES ARE IN DANGER!" (Penny, perception 16 - *thinks* she hears 'the sword!' whispered and the lights where the eyes were go out) - and, as the creature roars, "Who dares steal the sunblade?!", Arturo throws a fireball. It gets DEX 16 but Arturo uses Bend Luck, 2, DEX 14; it fails its save (meanwhile - Thorin, arcana 26; this is a Dao - a very selfish embodiment of the Spirit of Earth - usually a lawful-evil being that lives on the elemental plane of Earth; the nobles of that plane. If they're here, then someone or something has bound them to service.) Arturo deals 31 fire damage, flicking over the creature in green. Bits of its rock exterior melts and cracks. He then runs with a DM-permitted Misty Step to get as far away as he can down the same corridor Penny and Francesc took.

The Dao looks at Arturo, then at Thorin-Aurochs; then it summons an Earth Elemental behind Thorin; then it glides throught he ground towards Arturo. It'll be a tight squeeze going down the narrow corridor though! That's only 5ft wide and the Dao is large. The elemental attacks Thorin, hitting twice - 16 damage, then 13 damage. 29 total.

Penny has heard the cries and shouts across the room "I don't suppose you could help my friends while you're there?!" then runs back as far as she can go towards the dias room - but it's a long way away. The crystal creature (eyes no longer visible) - "canopic golem" - floats towards Francesc, moving through the fog. Francesc can see that its eyes are just inset areas in the crystal now, but one has a slight crack.

Thorin-Aurochs decides to charge at the Dao, risking the opportunity attack from the elemental - which hits, for 17 damage! The Auroch form fails and Thorin turns into himself, but is at least out of melee with it. He L3 Conjures 4 beasts, CR1/2; 4 black bears appear, surrounding the Dao (initiative 19) and tells them to attack what's closest to them. He finally wildshapes again, this time into a cave bear.

The bears act next - each multi-attacking; on the Dao - 1: hit (7), miss; 2: hit (3), miss; 3: hit (3), miss; on the elemental, 4: miss, hit (6) (but the elemental doesn't seem as affected by that - takes 3).

Francesc shouts a hasty apology to the golem (!) then also runs down the corrior as she can, passing Penny along the way. Arturo tries to Mind Whip the dao (INT 16, it has +5, makes the save). It takes half damage - 2 points. He carries on running.

Regrettably the Dao melts into the ground and reappears right next to Thorin-bear; no opportunity attacks as a result; it sees the biggest bear in the room and attacks. It hits twice. 19, not knocked prone, CON save, 6; loses concentration on his conjure spell - the four other bears disappear. The second hit does 25 damage! His bear form is knocked prone as it fails and he drops back to dwarf form. The earth elemental comes around and attacks too! The first somehow misses, despite Thorin being prone; the second hits, for 19 damage. Thorin tries Gift Of The Gem Dragon *and it works*, pushing the elemental 10ft away and doing 9 damage.

Penny gets around the corner and sees Arturo fleeing *towards* her - "What's going on?" she shouts. Arturo shouts that there's a Dao killing Thorin (!).

Thorin decides that discretion is the better part of valour. He dropped back into Thorin form far enough away from the Dao to avoid an opportunity attack and the elemental was pushed back by Gift, so he starts to head for the corridor - and surrounds himself with *8* conjured wolves for good measure (initiative 10).

Arturo sees both Francesc and Penny on the way, so turns back again and runs back towards Thorin. He gets close enough to the dias room to see the side of Thorin just at the edge of a corner inside the room and tries Polymorph, to turn Thorin **into a giant ape** and shouts "Thorin's a big ape now!" down the corridor in the direction of Penny and Francesc! It's *huge* (3x3) - wolves are scattered in all directions. It's almost two tall for the chamber. He twins Polymorph, using all his sorcery points, trying to turn the elemental into a frog! It fails its save and turns into an ugly frog. It *adds* hit points, effectively, but stops it from being able to attack.

The wolves were last told to protect Thorin, who's now a giant ape and can't give them other instructions. The dao shifts around; looks directly down the corridor towards Arturo, dropping the elemental spell - the frog-elemental vanishes - then its eyes glow bright blue and it says *something* - sounds like mud sliding off a cliff and landing far below! - which gives Arturo a very strange creeping sensation in his head. WIS save, looking bad, Tides Of Chaos, 12; can't make it... It looks to him as if all the wolves turn towards him, their skin peels off to reveal fey wolves beneath; they come stalking towards him... He's very scared. ("Phantasmal Killer").

Penny gets around the corner and see Arturo is scared; she can see the feet of a giant ape in the room beyond; nothing else to do.

Thorin-ape tries to attack the Dao, pushing past the wolves; he gets a hit - a crazy 7d6+6 -> 37 (error in that roll realised later, but we keep it for simplicity). The Dao's concentration is broken and Arturo's fear is gone - the imagined-fey-stalking-wolves disappear.

Francesc arrives in between Penny and Arturo, seeing much the same as Penny did, but Thorin's attack means that the Dao is now visible - she casts Hunter's Mark. Arturo can see the same thing, so given the Dao is just about in sight, he tries Mind Whip once more. It fails its save! 10 psychic damage and it's stunned.

The Dao reels from the attack; it casts Invisibility! It disappears.

Penny runs into the edge of the room; she knows where the Dao *was*; she runs around (full dash) and once she gets within 10ft, can see the Dao again. She just manages to get up alongside it - melee range.

Thorin-ape continues his attack! Despite disadvantage, first hits; second misses. 3d10+mod -> 20 damage. Francesc sees the blows land but still can't see the creature so is at disadvantage too, but moves around the ape to get what *would* be a line of sight and fires. Hit. 24 with all the extras. Next attack hits too! 13 damage.

Arturo hides! He uses his Pearl Of Power to get a spell back.

The Dao disappears into the ground! It reappears... Somewhere.

Penny creeps forward and then spots the Dao; manages to flank with a wolf; L2 Divine smite with a hit, only 14 damage. Second attack is a miss. This gives Thorin a rough idea of its location and he moves to attack, more wolves pushed aside; hits twice; 44 damage! This is enough. The invisibility fails. The Dao crumbles into crystal dust; the glow on the hilt goes away.

CHA checks all round. Arturo 18, highest of the group; the crystal powder starts to swirl around him. In his mind's eye he sees the crystal walls around him disappear and he's floating in space. Little windows appear far away. One has a swirling purple mist behind, looks like the fey wild. Another is full of dark shadows. A third seems to have a weird, squelchy-"feeling" purple starlight that almost looks like wants to burst out of the door. A fourth has a small ball of flame; a fifth, an ice moon; a chunk of an asteroid; a tempest of air in the midst of nothing. Arturo feels as if he can call one of these things to himself.

Arturo thinks of balance. He has drawn on the Fey a lot. He draws on the shadows instead; he feels - as the swirl near him - *safe*. They coalesce into a Shadowfell shard in his hand as he "comes to", to see that this has happened in the real world.

Thorin is still a giant ape, so Penny picks up the tooth pick. CHA save 18+11->29. There's a presence in the sword; a holiness and righteoussness in this thing. An essence of it. It seems that it can be immediately attuned to... She drops her Cloak of Elevenkind to discover that this is, literally, a Sun Blade.

(End of part 24)
