# RIPA: Part 17
## Session 17 (2023-09-19)
### Day 15, time uncertain

* We are trying to find the "oasis in the desert" beyond Candlekeep but before Amn, wherein a portal to the now-known-to-us-as-an-oracle Vallin may perhaps exist.

* Thorin and Arturo are back at the Amnian Trader's Guild working on *writing a book* to get us into Candlekeep, as we may need to search there.

* Penny and Francesc found a library. A librarian assisted, but said that someone else was recently asking about the same things. They couldn't remember much of a description. We find a book that would have the right information - but a page has been torn out. **Someone is ahead of us and looking for the same thing**.

We return from the shelves to Arturo and Thorin, bring them up to date and kick around options for travel. As best we can ascertain from our understanding of the teleportation helm, it does allow us to *try* and go somewhere we haven't been before, but the risks are high if it's based only on a description.

Arturo has been helping Thorin with writing, and finding out more about Candlekeep's entry requirements. Something "worthy of the collection" - information that might be of interest to someone. They've accepted journals and diaries. To try and gauge how good Thorin's book is - history check; 4 total. The book is a valiant effort, but the librarian - charmed somewhat by Arturo's manner - glances at it and, well, as politely as she can, says it probably won't cut the mustard.

Right. Well. Bookshop! We're told that Baldur's Gate is *the* place to find rare books that Candlekeep does not yet possess. The librarian can direct us to a bookshop; Arturo persuasion with Penny's help, 15; she's holding something back. Thorin pitches in and tries to indicate that we're maybe happy with "bending the rules" a bit, after some insight that maybe she's holding back something along those lines. She talks about a temple that has rare scrolls but very expensive; or the lower city... We look like we can - uuh - handle that... "You want to get to the neighbourhood known as The Steeps. All the book sellers there pretty much run a side-business supplying people for Candlekeep. Of course, I wouldn't doing my job if I didn't tell you to be vigilant! Because Baldur's Gate is the last stop for people headed to Candlekeep, then if you make it well known you're headed that way, people *know* you have a rare book. And those rare books then tend to somehow find their way back into town."

Arturo and Thorin ask if there's anyone she can in particular recommend. Persuasion only 14, she doesn't seem convinced. Not worth the risk for her!

We figure we might as well ask the question of price at the expensive Upper City option, which we were told was called the "**Unrolling Scroll**". We get outside the library; Francesc perception 21. She sees a white marble building that looks kind of like an unrolling scroll. It's only about 3 blocks away and we head there.

(D20 roll by DM)

As we walk, members of the watch head in our direction and eventually stand in front of us, stopping our progress. "Nice day to be wandering the Upper City." They ask to "see our tokens". Arturo says we're misplaced them. Deception 25. We scrape by; the guards say that we need tokens or we're in trouble.

Penny wonders about that. We didn't need them before. The armour isn't being persuasive; nobody else around is wearing it. No knights and paladins... Wealthy people and their retinue. If anything they might have two guards. What's more - we suddenly realise we haven't seen a single horse in all of Baldur's Gate. Weird!

The guards are still watching. We end up giving up - and head to the gate. People leaving are just politely nodded to; people *arriving* have bags searched, they're having bags searched, are being asked to shown tokens, proof of employment and so-on.

OK, so, we can't *buy* tokens. Perhaps deception; look like a rich person or two, with bodyguards. We are overheard! Someone walks up - a fair-skinned lady. "I can't help but notice you're in a bit of a pickle! It looks to me like somehow you've found yourself in the upper city and lost your tokens." "Yes, indeed!" "Luckily for you I'm a kind soul who likes to help people out so they can get on with their own business. Do you fancy a little drink?" "Absolutely" says Arturo. Thorin insight 22. Definitely up to no good, but not meaning *us* harm.

She leads us around a corner and to a doorway in a narrow street. A tavern; "**The High Elf**". We get seated. Of course it comes down to money! Four tokens as produced; we try to convince her that we should perhaps get a "better" rate. Penny persuasion 21, Thorin 16, Francesc 6, Arturo 15. The tokens are 10gp each. She claims they are real tokens; Penny insight 14, well, hard to say but probably OK! In the end we give in... They might be otherwise useful. *But* we do get ushered out when the gates shut.

Sigh. So. We each get a hexagonal thin metal plate embossed with a symbol with a small snake with wings.

"My name is **Savikas**. If you need anything - and I mean anything! - this is my part of town." She's often around the area near the Unrolling Scroll, or outside daytime, she'll be at the **Low Lantern** by the docks in the lower city.

"A pleasure doing business with you!" says Arturo. We finish our drinks and head out and now make a beeline for the Scroll. The same guards are nearby. They smile and walk over, full of attitude. We tell them we found our tokens! Dropped near the gate. They scrutinise them for a slightly too long period of time - but in the end they have no choice but to let us go. The tokens work!

We head into the ostentatious temple, a sweet incense smell in the air. 25ft high open space at the front tapering to a nave at the back. Lining the entryway are long galleries full of books and scrolls. Dressed in clerical robes of grey with silver and yellow highlights are various people tending to books - dusting mostly.

We are greeted and ask about a book or scroll for Candlekeep. A middle-aged woman with soft-looking face and dark, curly black hair comes down to assist. She gets into it... "It does come down to means, of course! I can show you the texts - the other rare tomes - but I suspect the cheapest and smallest ones will do!"

One is "The Account Of The Lamasou". People who were encountered these mythical creatures in the Southern deserts. They tell stories through song and this was written down as a collection of recorded oral traditions. "This is the original written account and the only known copy to exist" we are told. It took years to assemble. 150gp. OK, well, it's faster this way... 150gp is paid (bargaining not yielding fruit).

We learn in passing that there is magical protection around Candlekeep. Teleport directly is impossible!

Francesc, on a whim, asks about the book we found in the library. Do they have a copy? To our surprise - *YES*. It isn't for sale, it's part of their own library. We flip hastily to where the torn-out page had been - but cannot find anything important there. Insight Francesc with Thorin's help, dirty 20. We can't figure it out. There's nothing obviously relevant to us in there. Nothing about the place we're looking for; no description of a site that reaches Savras on the Sword Coast. The sentence at the end of the last page we'd saw *looks* like it would then be followed by an account of Sword Coast locations but, instead, the book talks about Savras not being worshipped on the Sword Coast at all and there being no place of access there. The sentence flows, the page numbers line up; it just doesn't say what we expected.

We believe the find of this book in the library was significant. We make a copy of what was on the page, but have no other information.

We can't teleport to Candlekeep. We figure we'll ask the Amnian traders about the nearest towns - maybe that'll be enough; maybe they have something *from* such a town that we could use for the teleport. So, at the Guild, we ask; and they ask around; fairly thorough checking within the group; basically, no. They're unremarkable and nobody can give us enough to even try a high-risk teleport.

It takes 5-6 days by caravan to get there, we're told. It seems that not only don't we have any idea where or if this "mystery town" might be; but it might not even exist.

Thorin wants to risk it. He got a good description of a town, unremarkable though it might be, and wants to try to teleport. He has 3 charges and can bring us back to our lodgings via the room key. We need a place to do this.

The toilets. Of course. "So, it's come to this" observes Penny.

Thorin activates the helm. D100->59 and D100->70. The tear in reality opens; we step through. It's not horribly bad; we don't feel any pain from bad planar travel, but we are not on target. We don't even know where we are... We're near some woods, about a mile away. Low rolling hills. No waves, no Candlekeep on a hill, really no sign of where we are.

Penny says, "I don't know where we are, but I know we're not where we were meant to be. I'm not hurt. Anyone else hurt?" - nope, all round. "Well, let's try again!"

D100->39. The tear opens, we step through... Suddenly we feel strange shoves and shunts as if being hit by things. It's as if the planes themselves are battering us! We take (of a maximum 30) 24 (!) force damage - and we fall out of the other side, more or less. People are all around! Thorin perception 27; he looks around; wait... What? A hill rises next to us; little houses around; a towering, 100-120ft high citadel made of white stone that rises promontory, flags above (DM rolled D100->90). Penny con save 17, keeps her breakfast but says "Let's never do that again!"...

...but somehow we made it. Thorin managed to get us nearby! He casts L3 Healing Spirit that manages to heal us all for 9 each. Penny throws in a bunch of healing too - 10 for Francesc and Arturo; 5 for Thorin.

Thorin is examining the helm, looking concerned. It turns out that he'd miscalculated. That buffeting by the planes - he figured that was worst-case - but when it happened and he tried to pull things back, he'd assumed it would just throw us out somewhere. In fact, he now recognises that we could be *trapped* in the buffeting and it could easily kill us.

Well then. That's a risk reassessment!

### 2:30pm

So it's not even two weeks since we all met and here we all are, early afternoon, outside Candlekeep.

Around us are what look like once temporary buildings, since added to and made more permanent. This settlement approaches ramshackle; certainly chaotic. It sprawls around either side of a beautiful road with various people walking or riding. Many have bags and chests, a few with carts. There are stalls with makeshift canvas awnings and a couple of slightly larger buildings that might be taverns or inns.

Francesc suggests we get tankards from the inn or tavern! Thorin is on his guard; people in this town might've been refused access to Candlekeep and might be looking for a way back in - and we might be that way. Thorin casts Enhance Ability to try and keep his wits about him.

We enter "**The Shaggy Lion**".

Penny asks about buying beer *and* the tankard in which it comes. No - but he has "these..." and shows us a plushy lion. He says they're made here. Francesc asks for a lion and four dr - but Penny interrupts, "Two lions!" and Thorin chips in, "No, three!" - though Arturo says "I'm not a child!" and doesn't want one.

The drinks are 4cp each and Penny barters (dirty 20) on the 2gp (!) each lions and we get three for 5gp instead of 6gp. Thorin insists on getting two lions only; in the end Penny forks over 2gp from her own purse.

(As we go through our drinks, it occurs to us **that we still have our room keys** from Baldur's Gate. We paid for two nights, but it's unlikely we'll be back in time...)

Thorin wants to keep alert and doesn't finish his drink. Penny finishes it instead. "I don't know how we're still alive... So yes. Let's go to Candlekeep."

We get on the road; it heads directly to the citadel, built atop the rocky crag. There are very high walls. Birds fly around, but don't seem to fly *into* it. A high wall runs up about 40ft, and built where smaller watchtowers might be are huge 50-60ft fall wizard's towers. Inside, the citadel bristles with smaller and larger towers that lead into a central main keep, which steps inwards (Art Deco style). There is a huge double gate ahead, at the end of the road; in front, either side, are two beautiful pink marble statues, 15ft high, each of a lion.

There's something of a queue at the gate; 6 in perhaps two or three separate groups. There is some sort of altercation with guards at the gates, who wear blue silk shirts, with long-sleeved white shirts _underneath_ and a strange leather cowl with kind of shoulder pads with a semi-circular capes and a leather apron of sorts with pockets. There are three of them. All three are involved in this - discussion? Altercation? The disagreement seems to be about whether or not the book should be allowed.

While listening in, we're approached by two more guards who come out of a doorway to the side of the gates. They ask what our contribution is? Francesc produces the expensive book. They examine it and seem relatively interested. "What is this? I've never seen this before..." - another is called - hums and has - and soon all five are clustered around. They all agree that none of them have seen anything quite like this before and we are invited through the door. "Before you can pass into the court of air, we just need to get this checked."

The other group looks dejected. Penny speaks to the sages; "I couldn't help but overhear that other group with that interesting new edition of a book..." - but even with persuasion 18+7->25, it's not enough. We learn that it was the "Traveller's Guide To Baldur's Gate", of which there are already a great many prior editions.

We get to the gate and one of the sages runs off to another gatehouse. Only a minute later they come back and say they'd love to have the book. It would be their first copy. "**So - welcome to Candlekeep!** It is slightly unusual for us to admit four people on a single book, but do remember that if you come back again, **you should each have your own book**".

There is a courtyard ahead - the Court Of Air. Stepping into this, sound changes completely. Penny perception 16, Francesc 15, Arturo arcana 10; a magical barrier; we hear no sounds from outside. There are birds inside here, gold finches and parrots, but very different from the birds outside - mostly seagulls.

A lady approaches and introduces herself as **Tamra**. She asks if it is our first visit? Yes. She is going to be our guide and research assistant. First thing, get us settled? "Then we can talk about what you need to achieve while you're here." Penny asks, "How long have we got?" - a confused answer - we ask more clearly; is there a time limit? The "oldest seeker who has been here, she's been here for 40 years!"

We are told a series of rules. No fighting! No stealing. No copying - we can take notes but a full copy must be paid for and done by scribes on site. We are also of course not allowed to damage, mark or otherwise alter any of the works in any of the libraries.

* Savras! Vallin, and the town.
* Ways to defeat a lich
* Where can we find giants?

It is suggested that we maybe use the bathhouse as it "looks like we've had a hard day" before we get to our room. We figure it's about not dirtying the books! So we have to do that first. We get cleaned up quickly.

### 3pm

We're now taken past a Granary, a Temple Of Ogma (same as the Unrolled Scroll) and to the **House Of Rest**. It looks rather like a 3-storey inn. There is a tavern next door called **The Hearth** and once we've got rooms sorted we'll meet our researcher there. We go for the usual 2 rooms. Magic tokens grant access.

The rooms are next door to each other and on the 3rd floor. We're apparently in an "extra wing" as there are quite a few Seekers around right now. When we enter the wing, before going into our rooms, there's a slight shift in reality feeling; it seems that this is an extra-planar space. So *that's* what "extra wing" means! The rooms are simple, serviceable and there are shared bathrooms shared between a few rooms.

Once settled, Arturo and Thorin come to Penny & Francec's room. Do we reveal all our requirements to the researcher? We figure we might as well trust her with it all. It may well be the least they've heard over the years and the opportunity is too great here to not take a risk.

We go to The Hearth, a two-storey stone building that reads very "tavern" (!) to find Tamra. The front door opens into a landing with stairs down that shows a surprising huge space! *Four levels with mezzanines*, a huge hearth with roaring fine, windows that show a starry sky beyond, a big performance area (currently occupied) in the middle, a bar on the right, some privacy booths on the left and, way up the top, it looks like there might be private rooms off the mezzanine. It's surprisingly busy; maybe 3 dozen people scattered around; We see someone waving - Tamra, on the 2nd floor, seated at a long table. We go up to meet her.

She has a plate with some nuts and small flat pancakes; she drinks a mug of what looks like a warm drink, maybe Mastica brew?

She asks what we're trying to research. Francesc explains our three main lines of enquiry. Tamra will, after checking with us, give us summaries of things she finds and from there we can dig in more. She can't research two things at once; we can do some limited research in a public area; but better than that, Tamra can find us books on a topic from the main library and bring them to us for further investigation ourselves.

She will start with that - she'll bring us books on destroying liches first tomorrow morning, then get on with Savras portal research. **We're told the location of a research room where she'll leave the books she finds and a rune sequence to get in there.**

We are at something of a loose end. We figure we might check "The Pillars", the public library area, to see if there's anything on giants.

Across the Court Of Air is a small collection of towers. As we cross, on the left, we see an emerald door - Tamra went that way - it must be the entrance to the main library. Surprisingly there's a smithy and stable there, as well as a clothiers. We reach "The Pillars" - "Pillars Of Pedagogy" - flat-topped towers. Private study rooms are there - ours included - but there's also a moderate library here.

We're looking for info on stone giants, settlements, forges... Investigation: Penny 12, Thorin 13, Francesc 24, Arturo 20. The latter two find some interesting things.

* Stone giants are half-here, half-not! An eye in the Realm of Dreams at all times. A form of reminiscence of glory days.
* They're not hostile to small folk; more sort of disengaged from everyone, if anything.
* Reclusive, intellectual; the least violent, or haughty.
* Stone giants have no forges. Fire giants are the smiths of that society and are their forge masters.
* Fire giants are more tricky - they prize martial skill; prowess in battle.
* We'd heard about the **Star Forge** and look for references to it. Used to be home to one of the proudest clans of Fire Giants.
* We already knew it must be deep down and close to volcanic activity; magma-fired.
* Not much information on this; giants are few and far between, spread out across the land.
* In times long gone, they were much more prevalent. Definitely a faded glory.
* On geographical locations; nothing on the Star Forge in these books, certainly. Some books have maps of ruins from old giant civilisation but that's about it.
* There's a clear hierarchy of giants even today but there isn't much of a giant *society* left now though.

Thorin thinks about cross-referencing our "pre-marsh" Mere of Dead Men map vs all the giant artefacts we found. It seems there must be something there - Thorin investigates more, with Francesc's help. Investigation: Only 8 sadly, even with Advantage. We might have to pass that onto Tamra.

Arturo wonders if someone here might be able to translate our Giant books. Francesc spoke enough Giant to get the gist of them. They are two separate books:

* One is "Dian Castra's Saga" opens with a long, rather dull (!) poem; it tells a mythic history of Giant kind and how Dian Castra, apparently more or less elevated to Goddess of the Giants, tricked their creator God (kind of) into granting her divinity; chronicles the downfall of the society before she did this.
* It lays out the caste system - but the whole book is in poem - so it can be a bit lengthy. Giants prize skill; the best crafter, best smith amongst fire giants is elevated to the top of their caste. The leader would be the best smith.
* Within each caste, the greatest of a lower caste is less than the lowest of the next caste above. Hill giants are below stone giants, always.

* The other book is written in some kind code.
* Talks about three opposing philosophies in Giant life; we're not sure how much is true; talks about worlds and realms.

He asks around to see if anyone in Candlekeep can help. We learn that the proprietor of the smithy is fluent in Giant - a Gold Shield dwarf who knows a lot about giant runes. We might be able to convince him to help!

Perhaps that is our next port of call.

### 5:30pm going on 6pm

We head to smithy. A sign says "Out For Dinner". That sounds like a good idea - we've not even had lunch! We decide to head back to The Hearth.

We'll pick that up in session 18. If we decide we want to try listening in on people for gossip or even perhaps overhear anything to do with our own interests (should the mysterious person we *might* be chasing somehow already be here themselves), well, that might take some time...! 

(End of part 17)
