# RIPA: Part 9
## Session 9 (2023-07-18)
### Day 8, 7am

During the night, perception 18+5 -> 23, Francesc is mediating - but hears much more in the meditation than she's used to. People walking around, people snoring in the next room, a conversation downstairs... A lot of "stuff" happens in this place. It is never quiet or peaceful.

In the morning, Francesc is awake before anyone else. She wakes the rest of us. Thorin tries to convince Arturo to hand over any "spare" gold. Thorin and Arturo had to top & tail in one bed, while Francesc and Penny would've done that - except Francesc just mediated on the floor so Penny lucked out.

Penny insight 21, Francesc 20, Thorin history 12, Arturo 16.

Penny is looking at the medallion. We were mostly here to try and find out more about Vallin; what comes next? And what about stopping the deforestation? If nothing else, there's a warehouse by the docks we were thinking of checking out.

It's quite early; the sun has just risen 'behind' the city, illuminating the sea. We're in the south-eastern quadrant of the city, which we recall is large. To the west, the docks and warehouse. We try to get there but fairly quickly hit another diving wall, which seems to divide the part of the city we're in from an area called "Neverdeath". It seems to have no barriers to entry - an archway - and various religious-looking buildings beyond; even some trees. Out of curiosity, we enter.

It seems to be a general mausoleum and worship area for gods of the dead and afterlife. This is a large area that clearly is of great significance to the city. The mood is sombre and quiet. Arturo says, "This place is *very* inaccurately named!". 

Penny history, 18-1 -> 17; might there be something here that is related to Vallin - the god the seer is trying to supplant? Some kind of god of divination. There are a few but we're not sure which one - depends on the pantheon. There doesn't seem to be much here. Arturo wonders about gods related to nature - Vallin seemed to be interested in animals as well as children! - so tries investigating, but (with a 6) - it seems to just be gods of the underworld. One thing does catch Arturo's eye but the significance is unsure; a symbol on one of the crypts, but he can't remember where he's seen it before. He takes a sketch of it just in case. Then he shows Penny - nat 20! minus 1 -> 19; a god called **Myrkul** - this is a "banned" religion. Bad news. They were somehow involved in bringing about the Spell Plague. Thorin (religion 23) concurs.

(Mortals had tried to overthrow Gods of Death, which ultimately threw the world into turmoil for some 150 years; the period of the Spell Plague).

The crypt door could lead down somewhere... This religion *is* banned after all... While Penny hears Thorin that we're looking for the warehouse, she's curious, Francesc a little too - so we decide to go down.

The door is strange. It's a stone door that slides quite smoothly. Counterweighted, suggests Francesc - and in good working order, so clearly used. Penny draws her sword. It's dark; Thorin and Francesc can see, but Arturo and Penny can't; Arturo (via L4 change) casts Light on his staff. Penny nods a "thanks"!

The crypt is small - about 10x20ft. The scuff marks from the door show a lot of movement between the door and tomb. Either side of the tomb are small slots, mostly containing urns. The crypt is well-kept - not covered in cobwebs or debris. Penny looks closer. Seem to be pretty standard cremation urns; various symbols and runes. She tries Detect Magic. There is an emanation from the edge of range, *below* us. Necromancy school. She focuses on the crypt lid but can't see much; Francesc looks closer and notices that the lid is not locked in place and is *almost* perfectly placed, but slightly out of place.

Penny tries to move it - Francesc helping - adv athl with Guidance from Thorin, but only 2,7+5 + d4->1 -> 13. It takes a while of pushing - in part in the wrong direction initially! - to finally get it to kind of lift and swing. It's counterweighted somehow, like the door. Thorin casts Pass Without A Trace as a precaution.

Inside the coffin, a flight of stairs. Penny asks Arturo to keep the light up and leads the way, sword at the ready. Arturo follows, but then Thorin suggests it might be a good idea for someone with Darkvision to go first! We swap order, Thorin, Penny, Arturo, Francesc. Francesc looks at the lid and sees that there's a rope that can be used to pull the coffin closed from overhead. She closes it - she'll easily know if anyone follows now.

About 15ft down, there's a floor. The magic is still below us so she whispers, "we need to try and keep going down". There's a small room ahead. None of the designs or symbols here or above represent Myrkul; just normal for-the-dead crypt stuff! Arturo looks for symbols of any other gods, but nothing catches his eye; so that's unusual in itself. It is *intentionally* generic.

We worry about traps but nothing untoward is seen, albeit unusually clean. We advance. As we get into the door, Penny senses an abjuration field on the far end of the room at the door there. Arturo throws a potato at it, using his mage hand to get accuracy! It really just *carries* the potato. As the potato goes through the far doorway, there's a "whoosh" and jets of flame shoot out, baking the potato.

Penny says, "OK, Thorin, it's *fine* - off you go!"

Arturo tries a second potato to see if it resets quickly. It does. Arturo now has two baked potatoes. He bakes four in all, one for each of us. There *must* be some trick to this...

* Francesc: 10 investigation
* Penny: 10 perception, Thorin 10 too!
* Arturo: 14 arcana

Arturo notices it triggering every time something goes through. So there must be a field that you cross and there must be a way to turn it off / temporarily disable it. If it's a magical field, he figures it's likely we need a magical trigger - a password, glyph or similar. He tries a Minor Illusion to draw the Myrkul glyph - and penny exclaims, "That did it!" as the magic drops temporarily.

We run through!

The corridor is only about 20ft long, followed by a stone spiral staircase heading down. Penny figures we're at the right level for the detected magic; the spiral went through 180 degrees but the magic is out of range for her right now. Arturo turns off the light, at Thorin's suggestion. He and Francesc have 60ft darkvision.

Now, *this* looks like a 'real' crypt. Lining both sides of a 30ft wide room are rows of stone coffins with covers. Occasional breaks in those rows have alcoves with statues standing within. They're not humanoid - some kind of creatures. Thorin doesn't see anyone; he suggests that the light is probably OK for now.

Low perception checks all round, but Thorin 16. There's a totally different language here. Older inscriptions. It's not Sylvan or Undercommon, though one or two runes look similar, but Francesc notes some similarity to some other runes and Giant. The statues appear to be demonic-looking; misshapen.

There's a grand-looking double door at the far end of the room with intricate carvings including two almost-humanoid figures - devils - with big bat wings folded above them, standing in the middle of each door, with arms reaching across and clasping where the lock of the door. They seem to be flying above a plane where there is the depiction of war.

Penny enters the room and quickly detects weak other magic in the room. Evocation, along the walls; creation of energy. She cautiously moves forward, slowly. As she walks through the room, soft green flames light up along the walls. Might just be mood lighting! Immediately behind the door, the strong sense of necromancy. She now sees that surrounding the door is a band with an intricately carved collection of various human figures apparently in various forms of agony.

Penny advances to within 5ft and gets a good look at the lock. No magic on the lock itself. It's a mechanism, but we don't have the key. The fingers of the devil hands seem to be holding it closed. Francesc holds back. Penny perception still only 6... Nothing; Arturo not much better. Thorin gets close. Perception 20. He smells it before he sees it! Old, dried blood. He sees that the leather armour of the two devils are lightly stained with old, dried blood, on their chests. Arturo points at the various carvings around the edges, grisly as they are; religion 7, can't make anything of it; Penny religion 15; they represent the horror stories of all the different 'rewards' that await in hell. She recognises the battle though - the Blood War, an old take, all the demons attacking all the devils - the Nine Hells & the Abyss at constant war.

Penny tries to cut herself carefully, to drop some blood on the fingers at the lock just in case. This does nothing but she realises she's overdone it, bleeding more than she thought - d4->4 damage! - but manages to saturate enough blood into the devil's leather armour, noticing now that there seem to be small holes, as the blood soaks in rather than dripping down. There are little clicking noises from within the door and the hand of the demon she's next to move a little bit. She says, "Well, blood's working but it seems to need a lot!"

Thorin now tries the other demon, but uses water; this just flows down over the statue. It has to be blood. Penny says, "Just one more person" and Thorin steps up. He uses a dagger; d4->1; it barely works. Penny smiles at Thorin and says, "This is for the right reasons." He tries again; d4->2; there's enough movement to guarantee that this door opens that way. He goes once more. d4->2 again. Penny mutters a prayer to Meliki, and follows suit; d4->4. The side of the door half opens. We realise it's going to take a lot!

Penny hands-on heals Thorin so he's not causing more damage than he should. d8->3, his is half open too. Penny, d8->7; 15 total; hers opens fully. Thorin d8->1, a bit more! Finally, d8->8; the door is opening. She just has time to fully heal Thorin but only has 3 left for herself and doesn't have time, as the door is moving and swinging out quite quickly. The hands release and the heads lift a little of the devils; we see they have gems for eyes.

The doors open...

...and it's just a wall of earth! There's a tiny 1ft per side cube cut out in the middle, and on that is a tiny stand that looks almost like a throne, with a hand holding a cushion, and on that is a ring, with a small gem. The necromantic energy is intensely power and comes from the gem and ring. The whole contraption, all of this, seems to protect just this small space.

Francesc advises caution uses her Primeval Awareness sense to check for undead and be ready for any necromantic shenanigans! She detects a few dozen undead within a mile of us, some quite powerful; including some fiends - half a dozen or so. Penny asks how many are *close by* though - a reasonably strong undead presence in the *immediate* vicinity though not visible and an *extremely* powerful undead force or spirit of some kind, tied directly to the ring itself. THe ring is itself registering as a powerful undead "thing".

* Penny tries Abjure The Extraplanar to attempt to turn nearby undead. Her amulet glows with soft sunlight, filling the area, with some slight glittering motes.
* Thorin meanwhile - wisdom saving throw 9; fail
* Francesc at a distance sees that Thorin is just staring at the obviously very valuable ring... Francesc tries to shout a warning
* Arturo perception 14, sees Thorin reaching for it and grabs it with Mage Hand, throwing it into the Bag Of Holding.
* Thorin is released from his thrall, but the moment the ring leaves its alcove space there's a strange loud psychic shriek and earth around the alcove starts to crumble away.
* Hound like faces appear, scowling, but they yelp and draw back from the Abjure light; but one figure, looking light a knight with a full visor and greatsword - and takes a swing.

Initiative:

* Francesc 21
* Thorin 8
* Arturo 6
* Penny 0 (1-1 => 0!)

Francesc tries to get an arrow ready but is caught off guard; Penny sees it, reacts, shouts some inspiration; the attack is more settled, 18, but still misses, glancing off the plate. Francesc shouts a warning "Woah, that was *not* a bad shot..."

Thorin steps back a little and casts Summon Beast, really trying to give this undead knight another target as a distraction; a land spirit - he picks the appearance of small owlbear! As a bonus action he commands it to attack. He commands it to attack. D20+7 -> 11 -> wild miss!

Arturo casts Bless on everyone *else* then moves away, behind people, to keep safe... **But rolls a 1 on the wild magic check.** D100->37; the air around him discolours and, creeping up from behind the three party members he tried to bless, space kind of folds and strange jellyfish-like things with dangling legs and eyes on top emerge into the space. They look confused, see us, scream and try to move away. 6 flumphs!

The knight acts. It attacks the thing that attacked it most recently - Thorin's owlbear spirit. 26 hits, doing a whopping 18 damage; the second attack lands too (25), for a further 9 damage. It's *just* standing!

Penny shouts, "I think it might be time to make a departure!" and swings, dirty 20 to hit, before Bless - does connect - plus L1 divine smite (3d8) -> 7 from the weapon and only 10 from the smite, but the radiant damage harms it badly for an equivalent of 27 damage. It's a good hit; but it does reform around the damage quickly. She holds her ground and leaves it to the party to try and hit, or run.

Francesc goes for another arrow. Everything on it - Hunter's Mark, Favoured Foe. 22 to hit, before Bless; that does it! 17 damage all-in. It's still up, albeit injured. This time, the +1 arrow fired sticks into it. Thorin acts. He runs up behind Penny and throws his magic stone! He starts to aim, almost misses (18), but is Inspired by the moment of battle - his new stones, his spirit - and tidies up, 25 to hit; does it! 9 damage. He commands the Owlbear spirit to attack and activates Shillelagh on the staff. It does attack, but misses.

Arturo goes for Mind Whip on the knight. DC15 save; it just fails. 6 damage, but he's lost his reaction and his turn is limited to only move, act or bonus act. D20 wild magic -> 7, all good.

The flumphs appear to be frightened of Arturo and run away; they're all crowding away, but that means Penny's kind of hemmed in. So is the knight, too; it it swings at the spirit, and *just* hits, doing 13 damage. That takes the spirit down, so the knight looks around, sees Penny and takes a swing - but (attack roll 11) the flumphs are distracting and it misses easily.

Penny tries her luck once more, but she misses wildly (9). This time Francesc reacts with *her* inspiration and - 18+5, it's a hit! 8 + 12->24 of damage, 32! Penny swings, connects, calls on Meliki and a blinding blue-white light gleams off the sword which carves through the knight spirit - right shoulder, down through to the left of the torso. There's another scream, and the knight is sucked back into the earth; it reforms this time, and Penny shouts, "Let's get out of here before the hounds return!" - Francesc leaps over and grabs her two +2 arrows - DC13 dex, matched by roll of 13 - and as we run Penny shouts, "Don't forget about the potato!"

As we run, we notice the green flames in the hall have turned orange. As we go through the door, Thorin is looking at the gem eyes of the devils; he figures he could get them out - with a few minutes of work. He knows Penny's Abjure effect will falter much quicker than that so turns and draws up the rear, running after us. Up front, Arturo draws the sigil, disarms the trap, we run through and Penny shouts, "Francesc, you know how to open that, right?" - but Francesc stops!

"Let's wait a minute! I wanna see if those hellhounds come back - and get burned in the trap. Then we could collect the gems..." Francesc Religion check - nat 20+2 -> 22 - oh, wait, hellhounds. Immune to fire. "...Scratch that plan! I know how to open the door." She nudges the door which swings open easily and a moment later, we're back out in the bright morning of Neverwinter.

Francesc says, "Oh. We forgot to shut the doors down there."

Penny sighs, turns round, goes back in and opens the crypt. Looks inside. No noise. She calls, "Arturo - I need the light and sigil!" - and starts down the stairs. Everyone else follows. Thorin mentions the gems and, given his actions earlier, Penny is certainly happy to assist. Arturo finds that even his drawing of the sigil works. We advance cautiously, back down the spiral stairs. The flames here are still orange. The door is wide open and the earth has re-formed. The empty cube of earth is still there, but the hand that was holding the ring is sunk slightly into the earth and the pillow has fallen on the ground in front.

We consider getting at the gems in the eyes. The doors are fully open, so we can't really reach them. We want them to be somewhat closed; so we just try pulling them. Penny puts the pillow back in the cube. The doors begin to slide closed, moving of their own accord. Francesc leans against one to try and stop it - athl 20 - hers stops, but Penny - 9 - doesn't manage to stop hers; Arturo leans in, 19, he holds it. Penny helps Thorin onto her shoulders and he gets to work on one door using his mason's tools.

The first time doesn't quite manage to get any. The second one is enough and one gem is pried out. At this point, Francesc and Arturo can't hold the doors open anymore and they swing closed. The heads of the devils lower their heads and their eyelids shut. At least we got one gem! Thorin takes a close look at it; isn't sure; Francesc looks closer; a fire agate, 50gp. As we leave, the flames in the mausoleum area die down and go out.

Back outside.

"Warehouse?" says Penny, trying to patch up some of her hand wounds with makeshift bandages. None of us have a clue where (low Survival rolls) except Thorin, who leads the way - but it still takes a full 25 minutes to navigate out of the complexities of Neverdeath, and through to a very different style of city. Rather than the mostly wood 3-4 storey buildings, here things are white and grey stone, solid, painted banners and signs all over, some 5-6 storey. Old-timey, old-fashioned look to it all; leaded windows, planters, tidy cobblestones. Temples, halls of justice, larger inns, festhalls, places of learning...

It's busy here - mostly, construction. Plenty of scaffolding around. Closer to the river we see up close now the large colosseum, close to some kind of government or other official-looking buildings. Beyond, three arching bridges, soaring over to the other side, connect to a large castle, also partly covered in scaffold. It looks like the 'main' castle of Neverwinter, with spires and towers rising at least 100ft or more above the ground.

There are a few traders too and a small number of patrolling city guards. Signs point us to the docks, which take us out of the city and down to the sea. On the way, Penny spots "All That Sparkles" - some kind of jewellers. She says "Let's just try and sell some stuff!" and Penny marches in, Arturo alongside. At least her armour and clothing are intact and might give a good impression.

Tall windows, a painted ceiling, chandelier, a couple of gnomes walking around. One spots us. "Ah. Can I help you?" and Penny says, "We're selling, actually..." He goes to fetch "the mistress", an older-looking half-elven lady. "I hear you have things to sell?" and we are invited to sit at a marble-top desk, in upholstered chairs. Penny and Arturo sit. Thorin and Francesc browse!

Penny gets the palladium/gold medallion and the recently-acquired gem and presents them. Adv persuasion 23. The gem - definitely 50 gold. "It's a good cut and weight" she says. "This other one here though... I need a bit more information about it..." - Penny just says that, clearly, we're adventurers; and this belonged to someone who used it for bargaining. Since it was given to us willingly, it's legally obtained - the lady reveals that it has a family crest; it would've been difficult to sell without knowing how it was acquired. In the end, with persuasion, she offers 400gp. It sounds good, but at that point Francesc produces the Orcish totem with the Orcish writing. She recognises the dialect and that it's Orcish; calls a gnome who speaks that to read it. He says, "It is a code of laws. It is a code of laws governing behaviour, rituals and revenge. Revenge for... Oh, interesting! This is - where did you get this?" and once again Penny does her best to explain. At this, the gnome explains more.

"First of all, it's beautiful because it's made of onyx which is itself quite a rare stone. It would require a lot of care and skill to etch these runes onto this small tablet. It actually has a name - it says that it is called the **Tablet Of Abberabbi**. Something to do with a circle; it directly translates to, **'Dread Ring'**. This is a revenge code, binding the people who carried this to revenge or avenging this 'Dread Ring'. So that other circle has done them wrong, or done *something*... Possibly the circle of orcs from which this was taken was even formed around this code, in order to combat whatever that is. I'm afraid I don't know much more than that - no context - only what's etched."

Penny thinks for a moment and says, "I don't think it's for sale" at the same time as the lady says "unfortunately I don't think I can buy this from you - it looks like a religious artefact". Penny says "Yes, we should return this! But we'll gladly take the 400gp."

A chest is opened; a bar of metal is removed. "Is this... or...?" and Penny says "Maybe something a little more spendable?!" - another chest; 40 platinum pieces are removed. Thorin appears suddenly, drawn by the smell of currency perhaps!

We thank them, especially for the information about the tablet.

Finally we depart and - again - continue on our way to the warehouse, which is approaching myth status by this point!

### Mid-morning

We reach the Western dock district gates and continue on. Guards are there but don't check any papers of people like us leaving, but they *are* checking people coming back in so we'll have to watch out for that later. Out here, there are various stone platforms with sets of stairs between them, forming terraces down to a sea wall and docks some 40ft below us. The city is raised up above.

There are of course many warehouses and other buildings and many large piers with rows of ships, along with the large river and docks apparently on the other side of the river mouth. There's even a large galleon that seems to be beached over there and turned into some kind of establishment.

All we know at this point is that there should be a mark of Vallin on the warehouse of interest. Investigation all round. Francesc's is highest at 19 (Thorin 17). Both notice a smaller warehouse down near water level, almost hidden by weeds growing over and around it. It's not so much the "mark of Vallin", not the same thing as the Eye Of Vallin - it's just the symbol we've seen before for the wider organisation.

It looks busy. There are people walking in and out. We walk towards the door, hoping to just stroll in - but we're stopped at the door by a foreman. "Are you lost?!" "Trading!" tries Penny. "We're not a shop!" - we try our best but he's *not* letting us in. No work, no charity, no goods! No fish either. We head away; a short distance away, Penny asks Thorin if he's willing to shift into a shape like a mouse, spider, or cat to have another look. "I suppose people don't *hate* cats..." says Thorin. "More likely to attack a mouse or rats!"

Thorin's up for it. Thinks it's worth checking out while it's operating. Plenty of crates and barrels around to hide behind while Thorin wildshapes. He strides on in. Nobody seems bothered about a cat! Various baskets and crates, loose items, it's mostly a jumble. There's an upstairs level, like a mezzanine and, as always it seems, there's an office in the corner. About 6 people are present. Thorin sniffs at the crates. Adv perception 24. There's a corner with a strong smell of urine! Nope! Has to move away from there because that's a strong smell. Some crates have a smell of food, but one set of crates are covered by a tarp and there's a kind of earthy, old smell; musty. The crates are sealed.

There's not really anywhere obvious that could keep, well, *people* if kidnapped victims were brought through here. At least - not on this level. He checks around to see if he can spot anything that might provide access to a lower level; trapdoors say. Investigation 17. No trapdoors but the office door is open - he trots inside. Smells of sweat and habitation. Almost like a bedroom. So it's like a number of people sleep here, but clearly not in this office... So *something* is going on for sure. Thorin-cat tries to sniff around and find the strongest source of that smell. A cupboard. He tries to bat the door open with a paw. It's not locked; it opens easily. It's full of clothes. *Those* are the source of the smell. A *large* number of clothing items that look like they belong to many different people; a combination of adults and children - well, teenagers maybe.

So lots of people had clothes worn, not washed, taken off them.

This is a warehouse office so there is a *lot* of documentation. All manner of files, dockets and beyond. Too much to readily search. Adv perception - 24, leading to adv investigation in an attempt to match the smell of the warehouse office's seat and desk area to someone in the warehouse itself, trying to get a feel for who leads this. Only 13 this time. Takes a while but Thorin narrows it down to one of two people. He recognises neither. Both are similar but not *quite* right, which is the confusing part. They also look similar! Male, 40s, working on the floor of the warehouse moving things around and checking things off on clipboards. Brothers perhaps, with a third one somewhere?

Thorin-cat goes up the mezzanine. Lots of sacks; food, flour and so-on. Earthy foody smells, nothing off - oh, wait, except for one sack which might be food that's turning a bit! Nothing hidden, no unexpected doors, it's just extra storage. He heads back down to the main warehouse to watch the two maybe-brothers for a while. They don't do much of interest, but it's still clear that they're higher up in the chain as they do less work and get more break time.

One last roll of the dice, so to speak; Thorin-cat figures that knocking something off a table and making a noise in the office might give something away. There's a flask of ink, so that's knocked off and smashed on the floor. He runs outside quickly, as someone else is shouting something and one of the two maybe-brothers heads over, sees the broken ink flask and arising mess, and looks around for a cause. Stealth check: 18; even with that (contested roll) Thorin is spotted. "Who let a cat into the warehouse?!" and chases after Thorin-cat with rolled-up papers. Thorin dutifully plays the part and flees.

Back with the party, Thorin fill us in; two of them suspicious, easily identified as a pair. We didn't find out much perhaps, but it's definitely the right place.

(End of part 9)
