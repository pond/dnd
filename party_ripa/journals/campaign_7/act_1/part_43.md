# RIPA: Part 43
## Session 43 (2024-07-02)
### Day 43, Web's Edge

(As aside we realise we have been in error on Francesc's abilities - Hunters Mark and Favoured Foe cannot stack, as both require the equivalent of spell concentration. The table agrees to play RAW from this point on).

After many battles, very low on health and resources and very much in need of a rest, Francesc has accidentally stumbled (with Penny's encouragement!) through a secret door right into the lair of the Spider Dragon, alongside which stands the Loth Priestess. Far across the chamber, tied up in a mass of webbing, she has seen the **first rod shard**.

If we run, the shard will surely be moved and we might never find it again; but if we stay and fight, it looks like certain death.

From the end of part 42, initiative rolls were:

* Francesc 20
* Arturo 18
* Penny 18
* Thorin 13
* Gertrude 8

The Spider Dragon has moved to the ceiling of the cavern, climbing the walls, some 50ft up. This takes it out of reaction range so Francesc decides - retreat would be useful; can she drag the priestess back to fight us in the adjacent room, which the dragon can't squeeze into? So, Francesc assesses the priestess for armour, as a prelude to an attack. Insight 19. This looks like a classic Priestess Of Loth. Too classic? Every trope is there... Could this be an illusion? Only one way to find out! Hunter's Mark (down as she'd been concentrating on healing Thorin earlier) is cast with a bonus action. With Sharpshooter, the first arrow is fired - but only rolls 14. It flies towards the priestess, who seems to dodge it, almost in a relaxed way. The arrow flies wide. 

Eyes narrowed, deep breath; careful aim... CRIT. The arrow strikes right in the stomach. 39 damage, magical. As it hits, the wound seems to almost leak mist! The priestess starts to change form - into a mist cloud of some sort. Religion check: 6. Could be anything!

Just beyond the door, Arturo can't see anything. Francesc turns and flees, shouting an abbreviated form of the problems in the adjacent chamber for the rest of the party! She runs into a far corner of the (overturned)Â table room to hide.

Arturo acts next - he hastily shoves the door shut! Now he casts Light on his staff, to be able to see properly and clears out of there.

(Francesc is shouting to Gertrude, over in the summoning chamber southwards to watch out!)

Penny runs up to the deer and starts dragging it towards the door. Heavy going; halves her speed. She goes as far as she can. Still about as far to go again to get to the door; something might come through first... She relights the sword. She shouts back to Thorin, "Don't you *dare* lose concentration on this!" - Thorin runs into the table room too, tucks in behind Arturo, sees that Francesc is in very bad shape and throws L3 Healing Word her way, for 6d4 + 5 -> 19hp.

Gertrude runs up and squeezes in as far as she can to try and help.

And then... Nothing.

Penny listens as carefully as she can for anything next door - but no, nothing; even with perception nat 20 + 2 -> 22. No movement, anyway. There's a skittering sounds - tiny spiders? Scattering inside this room? She looks up to see the small spiders that came through the door spreading up - but then also sees a sickly yellow mist spreading out across the ceiling! The cavern roof is about 20ft high; the mist is about 1ft thick; doesn't look good. She calls a warning.

Suddenly we all hear clawing sounds and the sounds of stone falling, as something moves across the chamber beyond? Hard to say; we almost feel it *in the rock* itself. Even nastier!

Francesc spends another second or so explaining a bit more about what she saw. The mist is familiar - yellow in the light, black and white prior with Darkvision; this is the "priestess". Will arrows hurt it in this thin, mist form? Again - only one way to find out. Sharpshooter again. 16; hits. 29 damage, without a crit! Not bad at all... Another arrow; 23, hits; 22 more. 51 in total! The mist sort of splatters out yellow ichor onto the cavern ceiling, and looks as if perhaps it has shrunk somehow. She retreats further.

Arturo considers trying to use Telekinesis to "scrunch" it into a ball. Perception only 10, but it's hard to see in dim light from Penny's sword and his staff. He's not sure if it'll work - so changes tactic. Psychic Lance, but as a "subtle spell" (new feat). DC19 INT save, DISADV; one roll is dirty 20, but the other is below 19 so - the "mist" fails its save. It sort of vibrates and shudders! A huge 31 damage; incapacitated.

Penny is seeing this happening as she continues to drag the deer - nervously! - below the mist. She can just about reach the secret door, but doesn't have time to open it yet.

Thorin looks around the corner, sees the mist, he's holding concentration on Polymorph; not much he can do! He retreats back behind the dividing wall and throws L1 healing at Francesc (11 points).

Gertrude squeezes through the tunnel until more or less eye level with the mist! "What is *that*? That does *not* look healthy!" she says, in Giant. "Yeah, we're trying to kill it!" replies Francesc.

Francesc can't see past Gertrude now so runs back around the central dividing wall to get a line of sight on the mist and carries on shooting away. Hits; 25 damage; the mist shatters! In its place is - just bizarre. **It's the weirdest looking thing Francesc has ever seen.** It's an amorphous kind of lump, sickly yellow like the mist it materialised out of, with strange appendages grasping the ceiling; battered, but very much present. A drooping eye on a sort of melting goo stalk hangs down while two more start to appear out of the mucus. Arturo, Thorin - religion 21 - this is a **shapeshifting demon, used by demonic forces to infiltrate organisations - a Yochlol**. Francesc tries again; 15; just misses.

Arturo's psychic lance is fading; the creature shakes off the effect. Knowing that this is a demon, he knows it'll be resistant to a few kinds of damage - but it's not a mist now, so he *does* try his Telekinesis this time. He has a 9 to beat on his contested roll - no problem. He grabs it and throws it to the floor!

Penny presses the button; the door opens and the sword lights 15ft bright, 15ft dim into the cavern beyond. She sees for the first time into the room... and sees a *thick* mass of extremely wet, sticky-looking spider webs that are covering a cube in front of her. If she wants to throw the deer in, she'd need to cut a hole for it first! Instead, for speed, she tries to squish the deer into the web space! ATHL 21 (and a very unimpressed deer) - then DEX save, just makes it, 13; she manages to not get her own arms trapped in the sticky web! Hastily she presses the button and as the door closes, she yells to Thorin - "drop the spell!" - as the fire elemental should burn through those webs quickly.

Thorin drops the spell. He's not sure why he was asked to but then there are bizarre crackling, burning, popping and bursting noises muffled by the door. He conjures a L2 beast spirit, a badger, which he instructs to run up and attack; it does, and would *just* miss but for advantage - so gets its hit, for max d8 + 4 + 2 -> 14 damage.

Gertrude tries to attack. She's in such cramped quarters that she would be disadvantaged, but the creature is restrained by Arturo's spell which cancels that out. She hits decisively. 3d8 -> 8,8,5! -> even without the +mod, that's enough to take it out. It dissolves into a puddle which fades into the rock ground, almost as if acid, but without leaving marks.

There is a sudden commotion from the adjacent chamber. It seems the Spider Dragon and the elemental are engaging in battle!

Francesc suddenly remembers the vital information - a rod piece is tied up by webs near the ceiling at the *far* end - Southernmost - of the cavern. She's the furthest from the door and the fastest. Penny, still next to the secret door, shouts out, "I can take a hit or two if we need a distraction..."

Screw it. Francesc shouts, "Arturo! Coordinate with Message!" and bolts. She's *very* fast! She grabs a bone from nearby (!) for use as a Helm focus as an escape strategy, then runs full-tilt. She gets right through the summoning chamber, down the Southward tunnel and whips around the corner to a double-door that we haven't been through before (as it was beyond the small acid pools that we suspected were bad news!) As she careens through them, she sees a large chamber; and needs Animal Handling - with Luck point, 21 - she sees four giant lizards along the walls. If she moves smoothly and quietly from here, they shouldn't move to attack. She suspects they're here as Spider Dragon food because there is writing in some strange form of elvish, probably an old form, that she is able to translate as "**Ker'Arach** Feeding Schedule". Well, she knows the Spider Dragon's name now!

Arturo casts Message. "Are you safe?" "Dragon is called Ker'Arach - one more door - just a few more seconds - giant lizards, must move slowly!" - and holds his position, thinking that if the door opens and the dragon's breath comes through, he should be out of the way.

So Penny thinks she's going to be the distraction. The door and corridors are tiny; "Gertrude, get to safety" she shouts and presses the door button. She's surprised to see the spider dragon and fire elemental in battle; the spider dragon is down on the floor trying to attack and is partly engulfed, and a huge mass of impassable spider webs that haven't been burned yet. Penny been realises her Circlet hasn't used yet; so she shoots rays of fire out. It's not great; she does about 16 damage, which amounts to two 5ft cubes of web being removed. She's creating a tunnel, upwards so that she (and in due course Arturo) can see through to the rod fragment. She hopes it's work - she's no idea what it looks like! - but it creates enough of a space to squeeze into the room. She's uncomfortably close to the fire elemental, and just behind that the giant Spider Dragon.

Thorin runs up close to the door in case Penny needs healing then tells his badger to run in and attack anything that's not an ally! It attacks the fire elemental and amazingly, gets a hit for 13 -> 6 damage; it takes 4 fire damage in return (26hp left).

Penny watches as Spider Dragon... Gets its breath weapon back. Ooooh boy. The elemental, badger and Penny are all within range. DEX save, 17+4 - 21, so she at least takes 78->39 damage, a mixture of piercing and poison. Ouch. The badger is gone! The fire elemental makes a save and is immune to poison and resistant to piercing, so it only takes 10! The webbing around Penny is now coated in tiny spiders.

Francesc can hear things escalating in the ever-nearer chamber as she moves a bit more carefully and stealthily to get past the lizards. Another door; she opens it carefully; and there it is - up at the roof, the rod, encased in webbing itself, but that's OK; it's held by about 5 very thick strands of webbing, attached like anchor ropes. But a fireball - well, that should release it and drop it to the ground... So she gets ready to run in to catch it.

Arturo figures he can't risk just throwing a fireball unless Francesc is ready and has to spend some valuable seconds using Message to check with Francesc and hears that he can, indeed, now throw his spell. He calls to the rest of us - "get ready to meet at the summoning circle on my mark!" - as we know the dragon can squeeze through some of these doors - certainly if Gertrude can. So it'll be in pursuit.

The fire elemental attacks the dragon. One crit; continues its assault after; moves directly on top of the Spider Dragon.

Penny gets ready to dash for the summoning circle as soon as the fireball is fired!

Thorin realises it's time to go! He throws L4 healing at Penny - 25 back - and runs as far as he can, bumping into Gertrude (who is then moving into the main chamber).

The Spider Dragon once again gets its breath weapon back, but needs to move away from the fire elemental in order to use it. And it's not stupid - it saw the elemental took much, much less damage from its prior attack than expected. So instead, it pulls away and then claws (much to Penny's relief - she has seen the Spider Dragon look right at her!). Its tries to claw its way through the fire (!) the first hitting the second missing; but it's not enough; the elemental is still up. So it's forced to bite - which hits, but astonishingly, the elemental is *still up* with just *one hit point left* - the Spider Dragon stays put!

Francesc spends another turn holding ready for the fireball.

Arturo has to get close to the door to be sure his fireball will hit the right general area; he can't see it clearly through the "web tunnel" but has a good idea of where the "anchor points" converge. The fireball is thrown! His damage roll is solid, too - 37. Francesc has a split second to see it coming and guard her eyes; it explodes just under the ceiling in a bright flash of light and the Spider Dragon screeches in a way that almost feels psychic. Penny can't see through the mess behind her but starts to flee. Meanwhile, a rod, almost heat-sterilised, seems to hover in the air for a moment - then plummets to the ground, Francesc springing into action. ACRO 24. **She slides along the ground and catches it neatly before it even hits the ground!**

Francesc has a piece of the Rod Of Many Parts.

(Meanwhile in the cavern, the fire elemental continues its assault).

Penny thinks back to the Spider Dragon. It looked beaten up, but not severely so - ADV Nature, dirty 20. She thinks it wasn't a demon. It's a creature of this world. Kind of surprising. But this Spider Dragon is not from the abyss, so it's an evil thing, an aberration, but ultimately not an incursion. Its kind lives here, in the Underdark. As she continues running, she laughs inadvertently - what a ridiculous time to think, "Live and let live"! She ends up next to Gertrude.

CHA save:

* Penny 29
* Arturo 21
* Francesc 15
* Gertrude 16+aura+1
* Thorin 5

She hears a strange noise behind from Thorin... She doesn't know, but he's stumbling around, almost drunkenly at this point; acting as if he's grabbing things that nobody else can see, in a kind of slow motion. The rest of us get a strange momentary flash, a feeling as if we're travelling in another dimension; and in that very brief flash, we see around us a sort of more extreme version of the Spider Dragon cave. *Building*-sized strands of webbing, but they're made out of strange peeling magma; a hellish landscape, as if impossibly the air itself is on fire and the ground itself is lava; swarms of flying imps in the distance; the clash of gargantuan armies.

Thorin is caught in the illusion. Penny turns right around and is about to run back - but Gertrude beats Penny to it and scoops him up!

Next, we hear a strange triumphant roar - quickly followed by a cry of frustration. Heavy thudding and scraping sounds rapidly shift as we are all *sure* the Spider Dragon is now running towards Francesc. Francesc, of course, is very well aware! She sees the glow of the elemental through the webbing wall extinguished; hears the roar; it moves to the roof and looks over the web wall right at her. Its roar is in Draconic; only Arturo understand; "That was given to me by the master on the Other Side! That was mine! It is my toy! They come to me for visions! Thief!" - and it runs towards her...

...and it runs *fast*. It hasn't finished attacking - only took one for the elemental - and claws at her; 18 against AC 19; misses; but the bite is 19, and *that* hits. 8 piercing, 18 poison damage; and her Reaction was used to catch the rod. Francesc considers running back South but realises the dragon can squeeze through and given how fast it moved, she's sure it would catch her in the "lizard room". But when it ran at her, it barged its way through the web wall enough to create an escape route below where Penny originally burned. So she runs *around* the Spider Dragon to the secret door, just makes it through and hits the button... She does a bit of self-healing too, *just in case*.

Arturo runs for it, leaving just as Francesc bursts through the doorway. He makes it to the group of us at the summoning room.

Penny shouts, "Where's Francesc?!" and moves to Thorin to try and help him break out of whatever it is that's affecting him. Her aura seems to be enough and he regains his senses.

There's a heavy crash and thud, then rapid skittering noises; more thuds and crashes; and to our horror we see the Spider Dragon just below the entrance to the summoning chamber. Penny, WIS save 19, realises we can't say here - we've no choice - she doesn't speak giant! - she points wildly North again, back the way we just came!

Francesc runs as far as she can, shouting, "Everyone! This way!" and readies the Helm spell as an action. She yells out, "Gertrude! It's a teleport! Don't resist the spell!"

Arturo is about to run then decides - he wants to have one more go at this dragon. It's clearly incredibly strong, and surprisingly dexterous given how it moves, but maybe not the smartest dragon ever. "We're getting out of here Ker'Arach, and you can't stop us!" he shouts and uses Psychic Lance, subtle spell, and the DC is so high that the creature can't actually succeed. INT is -2, DC is 19. 27 damage, too. Amazing! For the first time, this thing looks a bit unsteady and a bit injured. He runs up and finds Francesc. (Investigation 20, requested by DM)

It's so tempting - so, so tempting - but Penny knows when to quit. Injured it might be, but it has a *long* way to go before it might fall. She runs and also catches up with Arturo and Francesc. They're shortly joined by Thorin and Gertrude. That last appearance triggers Francesc's action; she completes the Helm action.

We "step through".



### Day 43, late, bastion just outside Candlekeep

It turns out Francesc had chosen the observatory level of our tower. Oh dear! Gertrude fills the whole space! The rest of us are squeezed in, but - we are safe, and we are safe. Thorin has one L4 spell left and says "This won't hurt a bit!" to Gertrude - he Polymorphs her into a female dwarf. She's able to walk outside easily, then he drops the spell and she returns to her normal form.

After all the excitement has died away, Francesc looks down and realises she is *still holding* the Rod segment. "We - we've got the first piece!" she announces. This demands study!

Francesc, investigation 19. Thorin ADV Arcana 21, helped by Arturo.

Despite our injuries, we have this rod and want to learn about it. We don't know what's happened in the Underdark with demons or anything; but this rod is made of a very unusual metal and holds a piece of clear, green crystal which terminates in broken edges that look like they were pulled apart from another piece. It emanates with some kind of stabilising energy but reacts somehow to Arturo; we figure that this is because his powers are chaotic. For his part, he feels somehow more restricted, yet also more focused and powerful, when near the rod.

We can't attune to it, but whoever holds it has a strange sense of - well, the best description is "second sight". We get impressions - an idea - of another place. We all see the same place, too; it seems it is trying to communicate something to us, but it's too alien and too far above us to understand. We need someone more learned to make sense of this. But what if Velindra knows we have it? What if Vallin knows we have it? If we ask anyone, *they* could be subject to scrying, even if we can't.

One thing is of no doubt; for all its apparently immense power, it's much less than it would have if there were two pieces and dramatically less than the whole rod. We realise the power must multiply, not add! Quite something.

After a while, we realise that it lets us cast a spell. **Commune**, once a day. We can contact a deity, a proxy, a higher power - and ask up to three questions that must be answered yes/no, and ask them all within a minute. If you're a religious person you'll know the deity, else it could be any deity. And they'll know that you've contacted them.

With this revelation, Francesc gives the rod to Penny. Penny looks shocked hands the rod right back! "It's not faith if you *know* they're there"... But still, she's somehow tempted. Would she still be a paladin if she *knew* her God was real? If she actually truly spoke to them, knowing via magic that it was for sure not an illusion or dream or similar?

Arturo found several journals scattered on the ground from the fallen table and grabbed them - we should investigate those soon... A quick glance shows that it's not the Drow in control. And that hellscape we saw briefly? *Those* are the Demon Web Caverns.

Before we do more, we *really* need to rest!

(End of part 43)
