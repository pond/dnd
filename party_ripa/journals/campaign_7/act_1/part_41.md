# RIPA: Part 41
## Session 41 (2024-06-11)
### Day 43, Menzoberranzan

We are hidden in an abandoned dwelling just outside the palace in Menzoberranzan. We have learned that **Loth is behind the demon incursion**. In the nearby Demon Web Caverns, a legion of demons ("rank and file, with generals") are being brought through - more demons "arriving by the day" - and the arrival of Demon Lords is also considered imminent now, though is believed to have not yet happened. Loth's priestesses are, for good measure, reportedly accompanied by a Dragon Spider, whatever exactly *that* is.

All around Blacklake and beyond, demonic armies seem to be coordinated somehow. We suspect that the first rod fragment is now on our plane, since it's related to communication, and that this artefact is enabling that activity.

We await a distraction - an uprising of slaves - that should pull attention away from the Demon Web Caverns, about an hour away from our current location. We want to get there during the distraction to see what's what.

We decide to head out. We have had scant chance to plan, except to note that we've no idea what we'll face. Penny advises people to keep close, to process the fear and dread of whatever we initially see, before scattering for cover. So... PWAT is cast. We have a certain amount of face coverings and disguise. Francesc leads, following the instructions given by the scion accurately (Survival 27). We wind up to an upper level. After just under an hour, Francesc thinks back for things to watch for - we should reach a long cavern ending in a tunnel which has clearly been carved. Doors at the end. He's never got past that.

* Little is known of what is beyond the door, except that at one point, said the Scion, it was the lair of some underdark colony of creatures. It had some ancient name but all he had heard was Web's Edge; which is strange, since as far as he knows, it is just a series of caverns. Slaves *are* taken in, he knows, so he thinks there is *some* kind of group - activity - in there. It's not abandoned.

* It's now dark. Penny can only use her 10ft blind sense. Arturo is fully blind. Conga line solutions!

We advance cautiously and stand at the doors. There are runes and other ornamentation carvings all over the wall into which the doors are set. There are no handles. Low perception rolls... Can't see a way in. Thorin does notice that the wall is covered in runes, except for a few areas that seem to be blank. Arturo runs his hands over them to help try and understand them - they seem to be of an arcane nature, and Thorin with that help - arcana 24 - realises that there are runes in some of the visibly blank patches. He can feel them. All the "empty" spots have runes. And with that, there's just about enough to read some undercommon "letters", or equivalents thereof - but more, as Arturo moves his hands over them he finds accidentally that they move, and push others out of the way when they do.

Three runes are the same - E, equivalent - and all the other letters are different; S, G, W, D, B. Ah! WEBSEDGE. There's a clunk and one of the doors sinks in, opening. Pitch dark inside.

Francesc slips inside. PWAT out of range; stealth check 23; a big, elongated cavern running mostly perpendicular to the door, smells of death, but there's fresh air too, so not musty. There are skeletal remains of two dwarves, an elf, a gnome and a tiefling. Nearby, there are two fist-sized rubies! They're embedded into equipment that lies next to the bodies. Feels like a trap! Investigation 29; they *are* trapped - and made of glass. Not rubies at all. It's some kind of magical proximity ward; she can sense a highly charged magic behind it; a jolt of lightning perhaps.

Arturo checks in regularly via cantrip as long as he can, so Francesc can update us with what she's found. Arturo suggests seeing if the ground shows any paths-well-trodden to particular doors, as there are a few exits from the long cavern. As she goes to check, she sees a door open! Quickly, she turns invisible. Two sets of footsteps. They're too far away for her Darkvision, whoever they are. They sound clear at first, then more muffled, as if they've gone around a corner or similar. Then there's silence, a huff, and one says in a deep, growling voice, "Go over there! Stay away from me!" and a raspy dry voiced response; "Gladly! And you stay away from *me*!"

On Arturo's next message "ping" she warns that there are creatures coming through, but they seem to be moving towards what seemed to have been, on her earlier quick investigation, a shrine to Loth further away, on the opposite end to the bodies. At the doors, the three of us decide we'll run in and try to take out these two creatures - as quietly as we can - but Thorin wants to try and take them as prisoners, and not kill them. Fireballs might be a bad plan. We start to creep forward; Arturo casts Bless. We get close...

...Initiative!

* Francesc 19
* Arturo 19
* Penny 16
* Thorin 15

One of the two looks like duergar assassin (the other a hobgoblin - possibly a spellcaster) but looks startled rather than acting. It's Francesc, then, who gets to act first. She throws a Silence spell into roughly the middle of the Loth shrine area. Arturo tries to find a wall, follows it into where he thinks the shrine would be and readies a fireball. Penny runs around, following a wall on her side until she can't hear her footsteps, takes one step back out of the Silence zone and lights the sword - 15ft bright and 15ft dim is enough to light up the Duergar (but also a lot behind us). This is enough for Arturo to throw a fireball into the middle of the room and it does work silently, but the damage potential isn't what he hoped - he was holding back a bit - 20 max. DC19 dex saves; the assassin makes its save and evades *any* damage. The other saves too; 10 damage. They are surprised and turn to face us; the duergar assassin meanwhile is covering its eyes, apparently hating the light from the sword.

Thorin runs up to the threshold of Silence and sees a 20ft gap between the two - he has a cube that can mess up the ground, but it's 20ft on the edge. Pythagoras! The diagonal is just under 30ft, so can get them both; but this cube also then clips into the cavern wall, destroying an idol of Loth carved out of the wall. Potential damage 16; DEX 17 saves. Same saves as before, though! Both make it - so the assassin, once again, takes no damage; the hobgoblin takes 8. There's a look of horror on their faces, though, as the statue of Loth churns and crumbles into rubble. Interesting - these aren't Drow! The mage, in fact, seems so horrified that she doesn't even act, frozen for a moment.

The assassin recovers from the surprise and darting around. The light is really bothering him though. He pulls something apparently out of the air; a strange, shimmering, blade of force. He rolls away from the difficult terrain to the cavern wall, still trying to shy away from the light, then tries to sneak behind Thorin, up close to Arturo, but it's still in the light. It's a risk as he's put himself into a flanked position, but even so - choices, choices! His chosen target is Thorin... The attack matches the AC. It fortunately can't do sneak damage as the light is causing it disadvantage; 8 piercing, 21 psychic damage. Woah.

Francesc wants to take out the assassin - if there's a prisoner, it'll be the mage... "All the toys" except Hunter's Mark as concentration is needed for Silence; Sharpshooter too and even with that, 26 to hit. 30 damage - but it reacts in a way that halves the damage (uncanny dodge). Sadly the second attack misses, even with Bless.

Arturo takes the opportunity, seeing the assassin dodge, to run clear. He goes for Psychic Lance on the assassin and it works - the save is failed; he's incapacitated now; plus 7d6 -> 19 psychic damage. But he's resistant! 9 taken.

Penny looks at 3-against-1, shouts, "You've got him, right?" and runs into the Silence zone to attack the hobgoblin. She misses wildly on the first attack, but the second hits, with a divine smite for 17 damage. This does seem to injure it quite heavily, though. So that's good, but unfortunately the sun blade's light is not really on the assassin anymore as he's quite a distance away and Thorin's body shades it somewhat, given her position and his.

Thorin sees it and moves around so that at least the dim light is on the assassin again. Then, he conjures a fire elemental; tells it to attack the assassin; and runs into the Silence area too, a short distance behind Penny.

The hobgoblin backs away and Penny gets an opportunity attack - hits, but minimum damage of 6. It groans - and we hear it! - it's found the edge of the Silence zone. And since Penny has reacted, she can't Counterspell what it does next. A 60ft cone of cold jets forward, glancing the elemental and just missing the duegar; CON saves all round - and weirdly, it's all 27s! That includes two Nat 20s. 45 damage halves to 22 cold damage. Then it tries to run, skirting around the edge of the cave, muttering to itself the whole time. Perhaps it's checking the Silence zone. Thorin, fortunately, holds his Elemental spell.

The assassin misses its turn, since it's incapacitated. The Fire Elemental now attacks twice; one hits, 10 damage, and the duergar is set on fire!

Francesc backs away to an even safer distance and fires at the assassin, once again with Sharpshooter. Nat 20! 35 damage. The second attack hits too, for 21 more damage - the assassin falls. The corpse burns. People might smell it...

Arturo, surprisingly, runs in, around the corner and right up against the mage, hoping to cause distraction. Penny takes advantage of this; hits with the hilt of the sword twice - d6+4 - 5, 8 damage respectively. She falls unconscious.

Silence is dropped. We tie up the mage, take away component pouches and other trinkets; then Penny self-heals herself while Thorin and the fire elemental go wandering off to check the duergar and keep an eye on other doors. The duegar's sword has vanished! Penny, investigation on the mage 15. There's a lot of imagery - spiders or webs feature heavily - but nothing magical or valuable seems to be on them; no significant gold or similar either. Arturo tries to use bits of spider-decorated clothing to "look the part". **He does find a small pentagonal token; a coin almost, but bigger**. In the middle are five interlocking rings each of a different design; lightning bolt, ring of fire, ring of ice, ring of water, one of maybe gas/air, based on designs etched on each.

Francesc digs through rubble; offerings have been placed where the altar and idol were; there are even body parts - organs. Penny says more will be coming! She puts in 1 point of healing to wake up the mage. She tries to intimidate the mage into telling us where things are. Intimidation 23.

"You are most assuredly too late! Nothing is going to stop what has started. The ritual will complete and you and *all* of your kind who do not believe, will die!"

Then it misty-steps - verbal spell! - the fire elemental gets an attack of opportunity as it runs past. 15; that hits - the mage has no armour. And that's the end of the mage - well below 1hp and on fire.

Francesc and Arturo look at the door they came through. It has a five-sided hole in it. There is the symbol for a skull and crossbones on the top corner. The other corners are not marked. No light or other things from around the door. They move on, to check the next door, not far from the corridor/tunnel we came through. This one has a lightning bolt. The last door is near the bodies and traps. Arturo risks casting Light to see what he's doing here. This door has a handle - but it's trapped. Something on the other side of it; pressure; something like a glass vial that would be crushed, or similar.

Penny comes over to look - investigation 19-1 -> 18; no hinge. Not a door? This whole corner is probably a trap. The middle door has a symbol which matches one on the pentagram "token" that Arturo found, but the two that we attacked came out from the curious "scull and crossbones" door and seemed to know what was happening - so it makes some small sense that, maybe, that's a good place to go. But which symbol on the token matches the scull and crossbones? Poison? So, perhaps, that gas/air symbol? He uses mage hand, from a safe distance - which we all take - and tries that match. The door swings open!

Thorin keeps the fire elemental back; Francesc tries to sneak in and see what is beyond. Stealth is 20; but straight away - **initiative! 11.**

The sight ahead is - bizarre. Metallic, very large, 8 sharp legs; hard to say if it is organic or not. The rest of us hear a yelp - initiative all round.

* Thorin 27
* Fire elemental 24
* Penny 23
* Francesc 11
* Arturo 5

Thorin can see into the dark room through the open door and sees the same bizarre creature. He turns into an Air Elemental and then, with great speed, rushes across the cavern in front of us until he's in directly front of the metal creature. His Whirlwind attack requires a save that the creature has +7 for, yet it still fails; it's flung sideways 20ft, taking no damage due to immunity, but is knocked prone. He flies in for another; this is a Slam attack, with advantage since the creature is now prone, and dealing magical damage thanks to one of Thorin's various feats. Sadly the first (17) misses; the second (18) misses too.

The fire elemental (DM fiat) winds its way through the door, like a tongue of flame sweeping around between them (if it moved normally, it would've burned us both!). It covers the metal creature and gets a crit hit too, 4d6+3->20 fire damage; it doesn't catch fire; another attack; 19, this hits; 2d6+3->6 more; plus 1d10 just because the fire is all over the creature; 2 more. It stays in the metal spider's space.

Penny runs in, gets in its face and ADV (due to prone) attack, two hits, both with Divine Smite L1; 17 and 19 damage.

D6 roll; the spider rears up, its head rotates around and single eye in the middle of its eye appears as a metal plate kind of peels back; a beam of energy lances out towards Air-Thorin. 18+5->23 DEX save; the elemental dodges the worst. 20->10 force damage. But now the spider attacks again with its legs, attacking twice; the first hits, the second misses; slashing (Air Elemental has resistance); 16->8 damage. It is, of course, no longer prone.

Thorin just holds onto his Fire Elemental (CON save 15, 10).

Francesc risks Sharpshooter, and does not get the hit - even with a Luck point. The next attack takes less risk, 27, could've taken the risk (!) and gets a solid 31 damage, piercing and force (but magical, because of the bow). Perception check 18; the arrow pierced armour at a white hot point; damage was clearly done; yet it doesn't really look too "hurt" at all.

This thing is *tough*.

Arturo runs to the doors, just reaching the door to see what's going on inside (now very brightly lit by fire and sword). He tries Psychic Lance again, DC19 INT with 7d6 potential damage. It can't possibly make the INT save, so is incapacitated; 33 psychic damage - but **it takes nothing**.

Thorin thinks better of a Whirlwind, and goes in for slam attacks. Advantage due to flanking. The first hits; second doesn't. 14 damage. At least it does look a *bit* beaten up now! The fire elemental decides to stay in the space of the spider, to get that extra 1d10 fire damage -> 10, great. It moves out so it can attack. The first misses, the second is a crit! 4d6+3 again -> 17.

Penny keeps attacking, with Thorin flanking. She gets two hits, for 20 and 9 damage (the first with smite, the second without).

The spider can't attack; it's incapacitated.

Francesc crits; 30 damage. Another hit; 17 more - that's it! The spider completely falls apart (noisily). As it does this we see that parts of what held it together are breaking into strange shadow spider forms, which Thorin - arcana 18 - recognises as being a symptom of this being a construct which was inhabited by a summoned demonic spirit. The spirit isn't dead, but *is* banished back to its "home" realm.

We've never seen a creature like this before (it's a Retriever, but we don't know that). There are runes in the molten mess that we realise it might have activated, but didn't seem to get the chance - three spells, *plane shift*, so it could potentially have shifted planes! Presumably, **it could carry things between planes** - what was it here to acquire?

We look around the room. A guard room chamber, of some kind - hanging from a wall mostly opposite the door are many hooks, including a large ring of keys. Francesc grabs them. Southwards (we think!) is a section that contains prison cells. Four cells. One has a cyclops, the next a dead elf, the third has a bugbear slumped against a bench and the fourth seems empty. A large chest, in some degree of disrepair, stands against the wall; a massive 11ft-long club leans against it - cyclops sized, perhaps!

None of them are reacting to us, surprisingly.

The club is magical. The chest is a magical dagger and longsword; very sharp and deadly. They look elven. Penny goes to pick up the club and is amazed to see it resize to fit her grasp!

The cyclops seems to speak giant. Francesc, with Arturo's help, asks if it wants to fight our oppressors! 14. It doesn't take much... "I would very much like to take the head of the hobgoblin witch". Ah - well - we already did that! But the cyclops will still help. She's called **Gertrude**! There was another survivor, but they've been taken for sacrifice in the ritual.

Passive insight; Francesc notes that despite being feed she's very dispondent still. She reveals that the hobgoblin mage / witch captured here and brought her here as a prisoner, hoping she'd reveal Blingdenstone's interest in a ruined underdark city called **Ched Nasad**. There was a rock gnome friend called **Rockzana** who'd worked security in a nearby mining operations, but discovered that two of the leaders were secret Loth cultists who'd infiltrated the Blingdenstone mining guild and were working to try and overturn the city - Rockzana had been too scared to tell anyone but Gertrude, who'd in turn not been able to tell anyone and figures she'll die; and she really wants Blingdenstone to know!

**We get a strange sense of a - currency. A tether to this currency? Were we to choose to reveal this secret to the 'universe', we could use this strange link with this being we met - we think it was Vecna - to grant us some kind of special boon. If we tell anyone, that's revealing it. We all know this secret so it could be used just once.**

Gertrude is aware of who else is here - and warns us...

* A dark elf (Drow) assassin is around
* There are two orc necromancers
* Two grimlocks (twisted underdark creatures of magic)
* An **erinyes** - a fallen angel - very dangerous! Appears to be in charge.
* "There was another prisoner here, who was replaced by the elf (who resisted, was injured and died from the injuries). They were, it turns out, one of the cultists who'd said the wrong thing; they were taken and sacrificed... And I think **at least one Greater Demon has been summoned as a result**."

We try talking to the bugbear. No response. Head in hands. We unlock the door and Penny goes in to see what's wrong - but it's already dead, from lack of water or food. Gertrude says the cultists are very strange; they need prisoners for sacrifice, yet let them die from neglect.

(Penny meanwhile adds her remaining hands-on 8 points from the pool to help Gertrude; she's only at 48, some *90* short of max, but it's better than nothing...)

Does she know where the ritual is being done? They're taken to a summoning circle to the north of us. North it is!
