# RIPA: Part 10
## Session 10 (2023-07-25)
### Day 8, late morning

Thorin-cat investigated our target warehouse in Neverwinter. It's the right place, but we struggled to find too much on a quick look in daylight hours. A couple of people might be running the show - by smell, they're similar but not the same - we consider the possibility of there being perhaps 3 brothers or something along those lines.

We consider options; ask around to see if people 'saw' stuff, search around for - evidence, FSVO of evidence; then Arturo comes up with, if nothing else, the idea of telling someone about the Myrkul 'cult' we discovered. He spots some people that seem like they might form a city watch. We don't want to talk about Vallin or kidnappings as we don't know how high that goes - who might be "in on it".

Arturo asks for assistance for one of a pair of guards who seem to be focused on crates being unloaded. There is some to-and-fro as they try to figure out what we want; we mention the 'banned religion' and that seems to make them decide what we have to do. "Well, I guess I have bad news for you... You'll need to go to the Hall Of Records and speak to a prosecutor there; you probably want to go to the section on Civic Organisations, to make a complaint." That's back again the where we came and they can be *very* slow. There's also the **Neverwinter Nine** (essentially, the police) that the Hall would contact if they thought it was significantly dangerous; we could try going to them directly; after all, if we think it's an urgent matter where other people might get hurt, we should perhaps go there directly...

...Thorin, insight 20; these people are only focused on their job and don't want to get involved in anything else so they're doing anything they can to palm us off. We confer and Thorin lets us in on it. Penny turns and asks, "On an unrelated note, we might be getting a taste for this adventuring business; is there a tavern or other meeting place where like-minded adventuring types tend to meet up to share stories?"

"Ah! In *that* case, you want to go *there* - the **Moonstone Mask**. *That* is the place for adventurers" (and he points to a small island connected by a stone walkway to the docks). "Maybe less gossipy; that's more the **Driftwood Tavern**" (and he points across the mouth of the estuary to the northern side of the harbour entrance). "That's the place for more unsavoury types. They stay at the **Beached Leviathan** too" (and he points to the beached galleon we noticed on the same northern harbour side). Arturo thanks him by handing over a baked potato.

It'd take 20 minutes to get to the Neverwinter Nine, so we could lodge a complaint there then get to the bars when they might be more busy.

On the way back into the city, we're stopped by guards (as we noticed, when we were exiting to the dock). A guard recognises that we just went through earlier tho, we're not new arrivals, so we're allowed in. Survival - Penny 12, Arturo 14, Thorin 16.

Our path leads to a good look at the three huge, soaring bridges over the river, two of which are still being rebuilt but one that's got heavy traffic. It leads in the direction of the big castle, which is also being repaired and looks uninhabited. Our path, though, stays on this side of the river for now.

We reach the "Protector's Enclave" where we were told we'd find the Neverwinter Nine, in a section of town that looks more fortified. There's an old keep in the middle of a square, with quite a few full armour guards around. 

Upon entering the building, Thorin perception 20+7->27. It's crowded bordering on chaotic - like an Earth central city police station - but Thorin sees some constables and figures we should talk to them. He barges forward and we follow in his wake. He points out one in particular, and thinking that she might not be too keen on an angry dwarf, Penny tries to be persuasive with a summary of the issues - persuasion 14+6->20. It works. She rephrases what Penny says in a very specific way, which happens to hit 4 flags in particular, which gives her a reason to extract herself from the other mess and lead us to a room.

Two of the crowd don't take the hint and try to follow into the room. Penny lets our party in then turns to face them, puffed up chest, being deliberately That Person - full paladin - "dissuades" them from following in (intimidation 18+4->22).

Her name is **Timus**. We have to explain things carefully; it's almost as if, as she flips through a book, she's looking for similar cases. (We turn on the charm; Penny apologises and introduces us, Arturo compliments her on her attention to detail and trying to see the big picture.) Apparently, there are no similar cases; but she grabs a reference book and *does* appear to find a reference to Myrkul there. "Ah, yes, a god of the dead; I wonder why they're banned... A member of the Dead Three..." (Flips pages) "...Bane and Baal. Yes, all three *are* banned. I will escalate this to the **Church Of Tyr** here" (Arturo later explains that this is a god of justice).

Arturo asks to borrow the book she's using on the pretence of looking for some of the pictures or runes we saw in the crypt, out of curiosity, but actually searches for Vallin information. He doesn't find that, but *does* see the symbol that was on the underground temple where we found the first set of kidnapped children. It is an icon in the worship of **Shar**, a Drow goddess. Deception, poison, trickery, assassination. Acting confused, he shows this to Timus - "I think I might have seen this one; have you seen this happening around here?" "Yes, of course! When the Chasm opened..." (the volcanic eruption that caused all the city damage) "...there were underdark forces spreading across the city. We dealt with the worshippers of Shar and, well, thankfully by the time I was on the force most of it was settled. Ten years ago though it was still pretty serious. It's still happening, but we're keeping an eye on it; being vigilant."

In passing, we learn that bounties for adventurers are posted in the Halls Of Justice, but all of the "serious taverns, especially the Moonstone Mask, have up-to-date boards that show active problems that they remove as soon as solved".

Timus says, "What *is* your interest in town?" and Penny tries to explain; she's being deliberately a bit obtuse, so at one point Thorin shows the Vallin symbol "in connection with" the Shar symbol. She's not seen that, and can't find it in the book she uses as a reference; but as we explain more and even mention possible connection to kidnappings, she's concerned - and insight & perception indicate that she's honest when she says she has no knowledge of this. She says we might need to take things all the way to **Soman Galt**, the major of town.

She's not too surprised at criminal activity at town. Penny says that, surely, it's the same in any big town but her guarded response indicates that the change of leadership in Neverwinter is perhaps contributing to a rise in criminal behaviour. Dagult Neverember, it is clear, is her preferred leader.

"You're not the first to complain about people going missing; you're not the first to suggest that there's a smuggling ring operating out of the docks. I feel there is a chance it *is* connected to these other reports, so..." she sighs "...I'll have a look at what resources we have and see if we can spare anyone to go down and keep an eye on the docks."

She does mention libraries we might visit where the name "Vallin" might have resonance. The **House Of Knowledge** is an official mage's archive nearby and on this side of the river, but there are more on the other side of the river.

The excuse we gave for her to finish her pipe has expired; the pipe is done. She sighs heavily and heads towards the door. "If there's nothing else...?"

We thank her and depart, heading outside.

### Approaching midday

It's probably a decent time to head to the other side of the river. Thorin mentions that it looked like the Beached Leviathan already had some activity even back when we were on the docks, so we figure we may as well head to the working bridge - it's quite close - and get down the other side.

The streets are crowded with people who mostly seem to be looking for, or eating food. We have to move with the flow of the crowd. We see from signs that the bridges have names. **The Dolphin** is closer to the docks. The **Winged Wyvern** is in the middle and operational. The third, **The Sleeping Dragon**. Once on the bridge we're just "carried with the tide" of people - very, very busy.

Penny, perception 21; Thorin 12; Arturo 15. Penny notices, as we try to push through, that someone bumps into Arturo awkwardly - and that's not the first time she's seen that kind of move. Two people are closing in on either side of Thorin as well. One pushes Thorin into the other; a hand slips into Thorin's bag. She shouts and tries to grab the guy (it's far too crowded to draw a sword), but he moves too quickly. Thorin tries to grab both - one hand each - but can't manage it. "Put that back!" shouts Arturo trying to be intimidating, using Minor Illusion to amplify his voice.

The hand is withdrawn from Thorin's bag, open, holding nothing. They claim to be innocent of course, but Thorin insight 27 knows they are *absolutely* covering up and were definitely thieving. Arturo pats them down with mage hand - lots of clanking, much stolen gold! - they run off; as they depart, Penny rather pointlessly shouts, "If you don't want me to report you to the guards and *personally* report you to Timus at the Neverwinter Nine, I suggest you *stop being criminals!*".

Arturo takes stock. Mainly, he got fairly random, not-personalised jewellery. The game side here says they're an equivalent of 5 art objects of 1d10 gold each - which is rolled to 26gp worth.

Finally, we get to the other side of the bridge and - it's even *more* crowded! There seem to be people trying to go about their business, but it's all made a mess by a lot of tourists and even people who seem to be tour guides, tending to groups, wide-eyed, mouths agape. We see **Castle Never** up close now. some sections at the front are open, outer walls demolished and under repair, showing clearly big halls inside, mosaic floors, tapestries on the walls... It looks grand inside, but it's interesting that it doesn't just look like seismic activity here. There are signs of battle damage, which we presume is from the Underdark trouble.

We're still trying to get through to the Beached Leviathan. Arturo mulls food up here, but Francesc and Penny do *not* want to spend any time in this heaving clusterfuck of people than they must! We are corralled down spiral stairs with more of the crowd as we make our way towards the distant ship-housed tavern. Finally, things quieten down and open up. Beach-like areas on the river side; shacks; squatters; even people sleeping on the sand fully clothed.

There are some people who seem out of it just outside the Beached Leviathan. In particular, there's a very well muscled, attractive half-elf with pants ripped off mid-thigh who's smiling and dancing as if at a rave, dancing to music we can't even hear, with a bag that seems to be his belongings nearby, pointing at us, strange out-of-it hand gestures... Arturo medicine 5, he's having fun; Penny 14, he's sweating; that's why he's so ripped `:-D` - whatever it is he's taking, it's endless energy. He probably dances 24/7, entertainment to the people sat outside.

Arturo wonders if this guy might see things. Maybe he could have a conversation. Arcana check on approach, a whopping 3! He's got no idea if they're under a spell or narcotics or what... Behind, Thorin checks arcana too, 23; Penny is holding her amulet of the devout and trying to avert her gaze! Thorin detects faint fey magic. He's under some kind of charm. 

"It's night! Time to dance. It's night *somewhere* in the world. It's night in my mind! Do you want to enter my world?" he asks.

Oh boy. Thorin whispers "fey magic" to Arturo; Arturo figures he might be cursed - perhaps he offended a faerie or similar. He has to dance until he fulfils some particular condition. Arturo elects to humour him and dance along! Someone shouts out, "Oh, don't fall for his crap, he's been doing this for weeks!"

Arturo asks while dancing if he's pissed anyone off - no of course not, well except for this *one* woman... Arturo tries to ask what happens. The guy tries three times to describe it, but somehow, every time, he gets sent off-tangent. "This woman with the golden eyes... She's very beautiful, very ancient I believe... But she lives here and nobody knows... Nobody knows how dangerous she is!" - then he snaps out of that moment of clarity and seems disconnected again.

Ooookay. We head inside!

Inside is quieter than out, people preferring the sun outside. We elect to just eat and listen to people. We figure people avoiding the sun and having quiet conversations in the less-populous part of the tavern might be the better place to listen, but the interior for food/drink is split across three levels. We could sit at one of the bars, at long communal tables or at individual tables.

There's a person sat in the quietest corner of this floor on their own with their head pulled up. Penny, insight 17+2; cannot see their hands or face, unusual to be inside with a cloak. Probably not human. They're on a table for two. Next to them is a table for four. We choose that table. As we approach we hear a voice:

"You don't wanna sit there"

"Why not?" asks Arturo

"Look around. There's plenty of seats. You don't need to sit there."

"We'll take this table" insists Arturo.

"Suit yourself".

They have a long, pointy face that shows a bit out of the deep cowled hood. A plate of food in front of them looks ripped apart. Too tall for a goblin. Arturo offers to buy him a drink! Persuasion is a very good 26. Perhaps it's Arturo's fey connections? The person is a bit surprised and pulls back a bit, which lets light from the bar shine on them. They have a long black bird's beak. They have hands that are claw-like. "That is very kind of you, but it's really too early in the day to be drinking".

"Very responsible of you!" says Arturo, looking around - lots of others are drinking.

"Pull up a chair if you want".

Arturo pulls up a chair. We do too. We can now clearly see a crow's face. 

"You have guts, boy. I'll give you that."

"I don't have any reason to mistrust you... I'm a bit worried about the guy up front, though. The dancer."

"I think he pissed someone powerful off. He's been dancing there for about 3 weeks now. He's lost a lot of weight! I don't think anyone's figured out how to help him."

"Have you met anyone with gold eyes around here?"

There's a telling silence. He turns to Arturo. "Why?"

Arturo just returns his stare for a while. Then changes topic. "I'm interested in exploring around here. Off the beaten path. Do you know your way around the alcoves of this place?" "Of the city?" "Of the Beached Leviathan." "Well, there are rooms upstairs; it's cheap, I can tell you that." "Places that are off limits?" "Well, our rooms, for a start!" "Are some permanently rented?" "They offer good rates for longer stays. Our friend outside..."

Penny interjects, "Well whoever he pissed off had golden eyes!" - persuasion 14+6.

The crow turns to look at Penny now. It's a bit unnerving! Big black eyes under the cowl. "There are a few reasons why someone would have golden eyes. You can be born with them, or you can have them through a... Process. If you're asking me if I *know* anyone with golden eyes, sure, I do. I think most people in Neverwinter know her. She's not the only one; but I'm sure she's the most famous." Arturo says, "They seem like a knowledgeable person. Maybe they can help with the boy's condition". "I doubt you'd want to get involved with that! They belong to a different society from... *Us*. And I would hate to have her gaze directed at me."

He can at least tell us the name. "**Lady Velindra Shadowmantle**." "Sounds a bit ominous!" "Yeah. A powerful person. She was one of the chief advisors... She's one of the people who resist the New Neverwinter movement. Rumour has it that she has other reasons to be interested in things in Neverwinter - I don't think she necessarily has the city's best interests at heart." Arturo leans in conspiratorially - "How does she feel about trees?!" "I don't know the answer to that! I'm pretty sure it's not straightforward; she *is* an elf, so she ought to be interested in trees, but she has an aura of decay about her. As I said. Not someone you want to know that you exist!"

It seems she's still a political force; not in office, but has found ways to ascend above that.

Arturo asks about him and "brothers" he mentioned. What do they do? "Collect things and interest for people who show courage, or righteousness" (he turns to Penny at the latter word). "We collect things that can be misused by those with bad intentions."

Penny gets some parchment, writes the name Vallin on it slides it to him. Thorin slides over one of the medallions. "Funnily enough, we *are* interested in information..."

"Where did you get this?! We can't talk here."

"Where?"

"Come to my room."

Thorin insight 16, doesn't detect any deception but there *is* another layer here.

He slides back the amulet. "Wait 5 minutes. 416." Gets up, loudly says, "Well you don't have to be rude about it!" and walks off. We get back to the bar. "Don't take it personally - he's rude to everyone!" says the bartender. "What do you want?" - a simple ale is a copper. Penny holds up her bloodied hand. "It's been a day, anything stronger?" "5 coppers gets you a rum". "That'll do!" - four of them; Thorin pays 2 silvers. The barman joins us. We take the shots.

Penny says, "We're a bit short on funds, we tend to spend it on rum... Any cheap rooms? We can share...?" "Well, do you need so sleep in it?" - we have 2 nights left at Two Left Feet; he's asking in coded language if we just need a room for an hour. A dodgy meeting - or hookup... "...no, we don't need to sleep." "Room for an hour? 1 silver." Penny pulls a face and tries to talk him down - persuasion 24. "Fine. I'll do it for 5 coppers. But you don't get a towel and you clean up your own mess!"

We're given a key for 511.

The stairs are external. Up the stairs we go, "accidentally" exiting a floor early. We chat on the way up. Lady Velindra Shadowmantle sounds interesting... A dangerous person but someone we might want to try and talk with.

We knock. The door opens. We go inside.

There are two present. The one we talked to and at least one brother, we assume, who is not a crow; a man in his early 60s, kind of haggard, scraggly long hair and unkempt beard. We present the Vallin medallion again. The human-looking one takes it and examines it. "You're right... It does look a little bit like... But not entirely... That's odd..." He holds it up and takes out what looks like some kind of jeweller's magnifying glass. "It's not magical; so it is just symbolic."

The crow takes it. "Well, I still think - it does look like Savras, doesn't it?" Thorin religion 20+4 (third crit of the day!) - in religion terms, a God of Fate who can see all possible futures. Savras' symbols it 3 eyes. The crow explains that this is arranged like that except it has extra things added. It seems to be a modified version. An expected triangle, the odd added 5 stars marking corners of a pentagram, but then the expected 3 eyes and then added again, in the very middle is a carved hole, a punch-out, that's diamond shaped.

We relate a condensed version of our whole tale, from hunters to kidnappings to Neverwinter. Unfortunately, neither of them have heard of such things here, "But we could check with our brother? Maybe he has heard something about that. He's out at the moment. Not very much to go on! Except... Are you pretty sure you have the *location* of a warehouse that's linked?" "Yes." "You're certain?" "Very." "Well that'll make it easy to scope out. Most warehouses tend to close at around 6 o'clock so you could scope it out, follow them, see where they go; if the activity is not being conducted out of that warehouse, they might lead you to it."

Arturo mulls the idea of perhaps scaring them somehow so they think they have to check on kidnapped people. On the other hand, we could just shake them down for information! It'd blow our cover but we've already done a lot of burning of bridges in the previous village. He asks if the brothers if they could get involved and let the people there know that they've "been rumbled" - the brothers don't get involved like that. Too dangerous. They just collect information (and dangerous objects!). If we know someone in the police force and tip them off, perhaps they'd send some guards to spook them. Arturo considers possibly starting a rumour in the tavern, too.

Thorin asks if they have anything else. They wanted to meet behind closed doors after all. "Well, yes... There are stories afoot that we've been following. Not sure where they lead, yet. But there appears to be old rivalries that are either dormant or in an uneasy truce for quite some time due to the rebuilding effort, since the end of the spell plague; old battles put on hold. But - they seem to be starting back up. Multiple forces at work that we can observe even from the city. Baldur's Gate forces have been seen here; Neverwinter is also home to a very cosmopolitan mix of people from the North - we've observed clandestine meetings between people clearly talking about something extra-legal! The fact that you're bringing *this*" - he hands back the medallion - "back now, sounds like another faction. What they want, who their rivals are, and so-on - that's all very concerning to us. At the end of the day the people who suffer are the citizens of Neverwinter, just trying to go about their daily business."

The city has been a battleground before. They don't want it to be so again.

They ask, "What are you going to do?"

"We'd like to know if the mayor already knows about this? Who can we trust?"

"The *mayor*? As inept as they come. Basically just an administrator. Holds no power. I wouldn't trust anyone in power though! It's the Lord Protector of the city that wields the real power. He *seems* to have overturned a lot of Dagult Neverember's 'new Neverwinter' policies; it's really set the movement back a bit. Reversed a whole lot of things. Just about abolished all the rebuilding taxes levied on wealthy merchant families, which has caused a boom in business for them."

Penny had misunderstood. She'd thought the references to "New Neverwinter" were from the new Lord; it seems, not so. It's a name for the political movement of Dagult Neverember, now missing though (we were told) still alive, and the new Lord is undoing a lot of that. Since this includes things like taxing the rich, Penny finds herself aligned with that new movement, and Dagult - *not* the current Lord and their undoing of these things. There is pressure to finish the colosseum to bring back some summer Games, which rich folk like, but which have a reputation for being very violent.

She learns that Dagult did tax the wealthy - but did also abolished all of the Guilds, akin to unions; organisations wielding political power in the city. So he was apparently doing good things from our perspective, but perhaps was acting in quite a dictatorial fashion and didn't like the possibility of political competition? "He didn't like things like collective bargaining and fixed price wages, stuff like that. He wanted a free market - trade. By all accounts, he rescued the city - it was in complete ruins when he came in" - but TL;DR, times change.

This explains Lady Velindra Shadowmantle's behaviour. She's in the pocket of wealthy families. If they were hurting from taxes then, for all we know, she might even have been partially or fully responsible for Dagult's disappearance and the new Lord Protector, who has only been around for around a year now. The describe the location of the "Shadowmantle Villa", where she lives if in town, but she is often not there; yet appears to be able to come and go largely undetected. They'd tired to have her followed.

Arturo wonders if they can enquire about Vallin and where Shadowmantle sits - does she support Vallin, goes against them, no idea? Is Shadowmantle an enemy, irrelevant or a friend? Persuasion with Penny's help is dirty 20. No suspicions are raised that we have ulterior motives, but we don't really get a confirmation either way.

On a whim, Arturo mentions Myrkul. They know all about that! "You didn't go down there, did you?!" Since they were talking about dangerous artefacts and given Myrkul - we lack any way to Identify - in spell terms - that ring. So, Arturo uses Mage hand and lifts it up.

**Instant fear.** The leap out of their seats backwards. Hoods go up. Cloaks are pulled around themselves. The human out of fear *changes*, quickly, into a crow - an actual bird. It flies at the shut window of the room! Complete commotion. Arturo quickly stows the ring.

The first brother, the crow - "What have you done - why do you *have* that?! Have any of you touched it?!"

Thorin did fall under the thrall a while, we confess, but we stopped him from touching the gem. We don't know what it is though. They clearly do. Penny says, in exasperation, "So what is it?"

"It's a phylactory!"

Penny and Arturo go wide-eyed. Thorin and Francesc are confused; so we explain about liches, and how if killed they go back to their phylactories, regrow a body and return, potentially years or centuries later; essentially they're immortal as phylactories can be almost any object and buried, so long as there's space alongside to grow a body, so they're almost impossible to find.

Liches, understandably, are precious about these things and some kinds of lich pretty much know where they are at all times. They might even be able to see through them... Possibly even in a different plane, so being in the Bag Of Holding doesn't necessarily save us.

"How do we destroy it?"

"Don't know! They're probably enchanted to be *very* hard to destroy."

We explain the story. They say, "So you *stumbled* across this? Wow. You're either extremely lucky, or extremely unlucky! It's too early to say. We collect artefacts that can be used for great good, but also great evil; a phylactory is not one of those things, though."

"Do you have any anti-scrying magic?" asks Arturo.

"Yes, there is, but we don't have the power to wield such magic. We recommend you go to the Temple Of Tyr, or if you need something more powerful than a one-time spell that expires after a while, or go to Helm's Hold if you need something more permanent. It's a two-day ride South; an old, fortified monastery, to Helm. But be aware - the order that's taken control of Helm's Hold is something of an extremist arm! They're a bit more militant than your typical..." "Everyday monk?" "...Yeah."

They can give us the name of a contact - her name is **Klarin**.

We figure we should perhaps go to the temple first, for a short term solution, then consider our options with Helm's Hold. This is all, though, a distraction from the Vallin problem.

"Well, we don't know who the lich is. But we do know that the Myrkul shrine is very important to the them. We had suspicions that their phylactory was linked to it. We thought they maybe had a portal there, which took them to the actual storage location."

The crow turns back into a man. "Do you want the worst news? Our brother has a theory that Velindra Shadowmantle is actually a lich... And her agents are the reason we know about that crypt. They have gone into that crypt before."

Sigh. Well. There's a good chance that Lady Velindra Shadowmantle knows we have it - Thorin, at least, looked into it. So he was rumbled in the museum heist, and he's rumbled at the crypt!

In the end, we move on. We take a risk with the phylactory and don't just dash directly towards some anti-scrying magic! We figure we'll take a rest at **Driftwood Tavern**. It's quieter than the Leviathan, but it's also all on a single level and while there are benches outside it seems to be mostly for people with pipes who aren't eating full meals. Maybe we have a chance of overhearing some gossip here.

The main feature inside is the bar - very long, lots of seats. There's a back wall of casks. All tables are communal; no empty tables but plenty of space. We figure out the food situation at the bar - plate of food and a light ale each would be about 2sp for all four of us. Easy. Then we sit as close to the middle of things as we can.

Quickly arriving for each of us, a chunk of crusty bread arrives on an enamelled tin plate with a warm barley and lamb stew with carrots and celery. A light, fizzy lager.

Penny, perception only 11. Distracted from worries about maybe having done the wrong thing at the Myrkul crypt. Could've endangered us all, mortally. Thorin's perception isn't much better, 14.

Arturo persuasion 24, speaks to three goblins sat next to him (speaks a shared second language). Ends up in a broken Sylvan/Common combination, but it's effective. They work in construction and know "all about the goings on at the Docks". Arturo starts asking about the problem warehouse, especially the manager. As soon as he mentions that warehouse - "Ah! That place! Racist they are. Fully racist. They refuse to hire goblins! We are very good workers. What do you want to know?"

Arturo asks where the manager goes after work - "I think he's up to no good that guy, I think you're right." "He doesn't always turn up to work; sometimes he gets his two sons to look after it. Looks like an old pirate if you ask me! We know that his two sons are quite brash, not nice people, they like to brag. Go to the Moonstone Mask and brag about how successful they are! I've never seen their warehouse full - I don't know what they even trade in - can't sell much - random, single carts showing up. No large shipments. Seem really to ever send things *away* by ship; nothing's ever arrived that way." They add, "They even had a shipment leave about two days ago. If you headed to the harbour master you might be able to find out what the ships were; it was, like, a caravel; that's what we got told; a small shipment, a small ship. There can't be that many leaving in a single day. I'm sure the harbourmaster would remember."

* We should talk to the harbourmaster. That's probably our next move.
* We could go to the Mask and try to play the brothers with alcohol. Then try a shakedown. Maybe drop Shadowmantle's name, see their reaction.
* 6pm stakeout of the warehouse perhaps less important given the above.

(End of part 10)
