# RIPA: Part 12
## Session 12 (2023-08-08)
### Day 9, around midday

We're running towards Helm's Hold. The main gates are guarded. The guards don't look friendly.

Closer to the coast, a bit further down the road, we see ruins of a town. We reach a stone bridge that crosses a kind of chasm-moat surrounding the front of Helm's Hold. Far down is a river, flowing in rapids, flowing out into the edge of a swamp towards the coast - this is what has eaten away at the ruined town. It's the **Mere of Dead Men** - famous, Thorin tells us - and most definitely *not* a hospitable place.

The guards have crossbows drawn. Penny, slowing but with arms aloft, hails them "in the name of Goddess Meliki" - seeking refuge. Persuasion 19; they say, "The watcher - the never-sleeping eye" and Penny knows this drill! She's heard of the religion and shouts back the proper response, "Helm has returned". The portcullis rises!

As we come in, we realise there are two such gates; they could trap people in between should they wish. The gatehouse arch is some 15ft high and about 8ft up, a narrow arrow slit where trapped people could be picked off.

Inside, it's somehow bigger than we expected! Penny was expecting a rather modest keep of some kind, but it is larger - in fact it's more like a small town inside. There are two large rings of buildings and an inner set of gates with raised buildings behind a secondary wall of defence. That includes a beautiful looking cathedral; from outside that had looked like a tower of the keep, but inside, it's a lot easier to see what's going on.

"We should head there!" says Francesc - so we walk along a stone road that heads away from the main gate, passing various buildings; a smithy, market - "**Hartward**" is written on a sign here - then there's the other gate for the inner "ring" - is not closed, but guarded. We aren't challenged as we pass through. There's a sort of roundabout road here before a rise that the cathedral sits atop. There's a single, large tower and spire on the front, which from entrance to peak must be 50ft.

* Penny perception 15
* Thorin 20
* Francesc 14

Francesc feels like it's "just civilisation" again. Another town. Lots of bustle, noise and stone. Thorin sees a few dwarves - at least a dozen, more than he expected, including some in full plate armour. Penny recognises that the people here are dressed in three ways, all official-looking:

* Knights/paladins in plate or half-plate, sometimes very decorative, many with capes or cloaks
* Behind or alongside, carrying gear usually, are squires
* The third type wears clearly clerical robes

The knights and clerics seem to be in two different colours. The gauntlet-first-eye banners are red backgrounded with white trim; one set of the knights and clerics match, in some cases with the same logo as an insignia; the other group seem different.

Thorin tries his Dwarven charm by trying to strike up a conversation, in Dwarvish, with a Dwarven knight passing nearby. He asks who we might speak to about our problem. "What brings you to the cathedral, brother?" he's asked. He does his best, with Francesc and Penny interjecting, but we're not very persuasive! (Low rolls all round). In the end the dwarf knight gets us to follow him to the cathedral, marches us through the main doors, down the middle past all the pews and to the alter. On the right hand side, he walks past and bangs on a door.

"Just a moment!" calls a voice; then a rather angry-looking, severe-dressing priest appears. A rather tense conversation takes place; TL;DR, they will try and cast "a veil over us" so that we have some protection but long-term anti-scrying magic is much harder and he says he can't grant such a risk. We have to "talk to the **Holy Watcher** about this" - but he can help in the mean time. He takes out a censer, fills it with incense, lights it, then starts to swirl it around. Thick smoke starts to surround us as he speaks some kind of incantation. When finished, he says, "This will protect you for eight hours." "Thank you!" "Now you'll need to speak to the Holy Watcher - I can't cede on her behalf..." "Where we can find her?" The priest looks at the knight dwarf - "**Sir Fatfoot** - you can take it from here!"

Thorin looks to Fatfoot. "What now?" 

Well, we need to speak to **Holy Watcher Querri**. We came directly from Neverwinter, so "You now fall under the protector's law, which is a law we have here for anyone from Neverwinter." He lights a lamp. "I must insist that you take your armour off, along with any cloaks and capes. You can hold something up, but you need to undress so we can examine you... We need to see if you have any spell scars. From the spell plague! That's really the only reason that Dagult ever sends us anyone from Neverwinter."

Penny sighs and complies. Kinda gross but it sounds necessary. The lamp shines a curious light; the guy is apologetic but also seems a bit angry as if that's really not meant to be his job. We're apparently clear of whatever it is the lamp would reveal; we dress again. We're each handed a small satin ribbon that we're meant to keep on our wrists so we don't get thus challenged again.

There are two inns where we can stay:

* Hungry Flame
* Venture's Rest

Thorin asks which is the most lively... Venture's Rest. Penny asks how long we might be waiting, given that the magic spell upon us has a limited lifespan. "We would hope that you will be able to see you today!" He'll send word to try and get us an audience, and find us at the Venture's Rest, via a message to Thorin.

Well, at least for now we've an extension on our scrying protection. It's a curious place we're in but we might as well get to the inn.

Penny asks a passing cleric. He's confused at first, before saying "Oh! You mean the old Dirty Dwarf? What did you say it was called now? Venture's Rest?" - we are given directions.

As we go, even Penny can't miss the fact that there's surely a Dwarven connection here. Big thick walls, 50ft tall cathedral but smaller inside than expected - very thick walls again... Surely, a Dwarven heritage? She asks Thorin, but he's not too sure; this isn't a Dwarven place of which he has prior knowledge and there *is* some Dwarven handiwork here but not all of it. The inner keep seems original and older, with non-Dwarven additions outside.

We approach an interesting-looking two storey building projecting out of the exterior wall, with two large chimneys billowing smoke. Even for midday it sounds lively! There's a lowish door, which Penny and Francesc need to duck under a bit. Thorin can easily see (perception 25) that the sign outside had been painted over and once said, "The Old Dirty Dwarf".

Inside, there's a strong smell of - well, for Thorin, familiarity and good Dwarven brandy. Thorin mentions it... Hmmm. Penny might be warming to the place after all.

There are actually quite a few empty tables here; most of the lively noise comes entirely from a table of 8 rowdy dwarves. We approach the bar - someone yells to someone else to get the attention of the bar man - **Arm Darh**, AKA **Twofeast**. He and his wife **Missora Bravehead** run the bar. Apparently the noisy group are celebrating a raid, we're told. We discuss rooms and he ends up showing us one. At a door upstairs, he tries various keys and eventually finds the right one.

The room overlooks the street and has three longer beds - more than enough for Thorin and good for Penny and Francesc. Spot on. "How much?" "This will be 6sp a night." He'll hold the room for 3 nights with that price (though we're only paying for one right now) - we'd settle up at the end. There's a tavern downsides with food, brandy and so-on that's at extra cost.

"How long have you owned this?" asks Thorin. "Since the name change! It was named after Missora's father. He started the place about 200 years ago." They got told at some point that maybe the name was racist (!) and could attract - the wrong kind of people... Thorin pays and gets the key; we think we might try some of that Dwarven brandy. "And lunch", adds Francesc. He also mentions - for no particular reason - that there are baths at the end of the hallway; including something called a "shower", in fact. We take turns and eventually get to the tavern.

The group of 8 down there are wrapping up - trying to stand and leave, though some require assistance. We order - and then, venison and Brandy. It's for us a lavish spend - 1.5gp - Thorin tries to barter and it doesn't change the price, but it does increase the size of the brandy pour.

We discuss what we're going to do... Hide this phylactory, then what? Revenge for our crow-people friends? Destroy it? Francesc says yes; Penny is glad, she wants to; but how?

Missora is arriving with more brandy and overhears. She says we're in the right place if we want to destroy an evil artefact... She speaks in cryptic terms a bit for a while and we look blank (increasingly joking badly as the brandy takes hold); she sits, with brandy herself; this seems to be something she thinks is quite secretive. "There are good elven smiths, yes, but dwarves are known for being good smiths too. Now, we didn't learn our best skills independently; we were taught them. Does your clan teach where we learned our smithing skills from?" Thorin says no. "The greatest forges are not Dwarven forges, but Giant forges. We learned from *them*. If you want to to destroy an artefact, you need a very *very* powerful forge. With a lot of magic. Dwarven forges - did you know, our entire language, our very form of writing itself is based on the runic language of the giants? I would say - depending on how powerful this artefact is - you might need to find a giant forge. A dwarven forge *could* do it. But a giant forge would *definitely* do it. That's all I'm sayin'!" - she tops up our glasses and walks off.

Penny looks at Francesc; know any giants?! Giant society is complex and generally giants aren't - the nicest. But there *are* some that are friendly. An entire civilisation with their own society spanning as much diversity as any other culture."

Francesc (history only 10) knows that most giants have left the land now. But there are different kinds of giants live in different places - hill giants live in hills! There are storm, cloud, fire, frost and hill giants.

While we discuss it, Francesc is quietly trying to slide a dagger under the ribbon to cut it off for Hilarious Reasons. Thorin sees easily (Francesc SOH only 6). Thorin casually pulls his arm back - and punches her in the face. Unarmed attack... 20(!)+2->22. 1 damage, since unarmed crits have no dice to double!

The door swings open. An older-looking knight walks in. A paladin in fact. He's alone. Maybe in his 60s. He pulls back a bar chair and sits. Missora comes out; "Oh! Oh my. Sir **Javen**! What an honour to have you in here!" Penny wanders over, largely uninvited; "The brandy's really good" He looks over. "Oh is it? I don't drink. But thank you!" Penny is reminded that she probably shouldn't either, but when in Rome...

Missorah brings over some tea. It's met with approval. "I haven't had this in a while! I'm glad you still have it." He reaches for his coin pouch. "Oh no, I couldn't possibly take your money..." says Missorah; he immediately just says "OK!" and puts it away. Insight is only 11; Penny sees Missorah is treating the guy with authentic reverence and respect. The man himself does have may battle scars and the way he hoisted himself up onto the bar stool suggests long-term injuries. Around his neck he wears several amulets on chains. Penny says, "Forgive me, I'm new here. May I ask - what those amulets represent?"

He says yes, but then remembers himself; stands, "I am **Javen Tarmikos**." "Penny Jones, paladin!" "Ah. Well. This here is the Order Of The Guilded Eye, a holy paladin order that I founded. Are you familiar with the holy orders of the land?" "No, though I would guess that the Guilded Eye refers to the banners?" "Yes. Helm is crying from all the injustice and evil in the world that goes unpunished. He cries these tears of gold for this is the world that he saw when he returned, from his long absence. I was once a member of another order, too - a similar symbol - the Order Of The Gauntlet. Their inaction led me to create this order." Francesc has wandered over; she's overheard that and is surprised. She thinks of the Order Of The Gauntlet as one of the most zealous and militant orders along the Sword Coast - a reputation of being very proactive and, indeed, by good-aligned people, even criticised by acting too rashly to punish those who they believe have done something wrong.

Penny says, "So what are your feelings about liches then?" "Not a trick question?" "No" "We should hunt them all and kill them! But also ban all the books that teaches lichdom, and if anyone shows a predilection for lichdom, kill them before they can do that." Penny winces at the latter. "Evil is innate" he says, and argues on that basis that eliminating a threat before an atrocity is a better way. Francesc argues back that some are capable of learning. Essentially, atonement; second chances. Doing something bad, learning, balancing it out later.

And why are we here? Well, we're wondering how to destroy a phylactory. "Hypothetical?" "Um, no..." - he learns that we're organising an audience with Holy Watcher Querri and offers to take us there straight away.

Francesc makes an excuse about fetching something from upstairs, giving Penny "the eye" and takes the moment to explain about the Order & it being rather militant. The discussion about killing evil "early" makes more sense! We'll have to be careful. He might decide *we* are evil - indeed the Holy Watcher might be even *more* zealous.

Meanwhile, Javen is telling Thorin that he believes (truly!) that he is the "holy right hand of Helm" and had "a feeling" he should be at this bar today. He gets that a lot, he says.

As Javen turns to go, he puts his hand on the bar as if to steady himself. Perception - Francesc 17, Penny 18, Thorin, 26. We all notice a gold piece left on the bar as he leaves.

We're being led back towards the cathedral. People move out of the way as Javen comes through; some even bow. We talk about Vallin & the kidnapped kids; he pushes us about battles we've had; Penny does describe the Merkul temple; "A helmed horror" he says of our description of the spectral knight. He says that Penny seems like a watcher to him... She's surprised; she has indeed taken the Oath Of The Watchers. To protect the plane from incursions. She says, "Yes, but not alone!" and gestures to her friends.

He shows another amulet. "You asked about these. This..." - he motions to another, as yet undescribed - "...was given to all of us who survived the siege of Helm's Hold against the agents of Azmodius. The arch-devil; an infiltration at every level of government including *here* in this holiest of places. There is nowhere that is safe from corruption. Evil *and* well-meaning forces of good from other planes have used our world as a battleground for millennia. This has to stop! Like you, I too have taken the Oath Of The Watchers. You and I - we protect this plane. You do good work."

We reach the cathedral. The priest from before sees us, looks shocked at the sight of Javen, hastily tidies his robes, then rushes to unlock doors that lead to much more of the cathedral behind the space we've already seen. There are stairs and chambers. We're led up the stairs by a suddenly-very-deferential priest! Javen just continues talking as if this is routine - not being an asshole (!) about it, just letting it happen as all this fuss occurs around, acolytes being sent ahead and so-on.

A door opens. A lady in pearl-white clothes with accents of red and a blue short cape with large decorated cowl, with high-backed collar that forms a spade-from-cards kind of shape, decorated with embroidery, appears. Her hair is put up in a bun with extra combs added to look like a mitre. It's... A lot.

"Sir Javen! I had a feeling you were coming to see me today!"

"Ah! Yes! Querria! It has been - 3, 4 days?!"

"You're funny. It's been at least a week..."

...and so-on. Insight Thorin - low (!) - Francesc, Penny 24, 20 respectively. There's a lot of subtext - it's almost like sparring verbally. Penny wonders if it is a form of competition; she runs the order that he founded? Well, she maybe feels that he doesn't appreciate how he is a relic! It's her order now. **There's tension in the fact that leadership has changed over**. Francesc detects in Javen that he considers her to be somewhat insecure and defensive; she's good enough to run the order but isn't acting like it.

We're taken into what appears to a private prayer space of sorts. Querria looks a bit confused; Javen introduces us; then hastily makes his exit!

We start to explain that we had a scheduled meeting but it kinda got - well - expedited?! At this moment a squire is running up with a note looking flustered; Thorin notices Querria giving the squire an alarmed look as Francesc is trying to reach to take the note but Sleight Of Hand is only 7 - everyone sees. Unperturbed, Francesc opens and reads it before Querria takes it off her.

The note said "Tell them I'm busy"...

"...You won't need that now!" says Querria as she grabs the note; "please take a seat".

Penny gives the short version. Phylactory, want to destroy it, dangerous, told to come here by the people who died - Forlorn Keep. TL;DR, she's interested; and she wears - but is hiding - an amulet of Proof Against Detection that makes her impossible to scry upon. An amulet that prevents her being detected or found. We figure that 8 hour anti-scrying magic might not work, I mean, we don't even know *where* we can destroy the phylactory.

A rather frustrating to-and-fro conversation follows. It's very difficult to get any real help. She won't give us the amulet, which is understandable. She suggests Candlekeep as a place to research the destruction of the item; but that's days-to-weeks away. A travelling priest could accompany us at 100gp a day and 250gp per casting of the anti-scry spell; well beyond our means. The trouble is that there's not much to go on... Hasn't even see the phylactory...

At that, we say - well we're protected by their spell; she has her amulet; we can show it her. She thinks for a moment then agrees. With Mage Hand, Francesc produces it. Querria casts an Identify spell then says - "That's odd! This is also shielded. The spell did *not* give me the name of the soul-bearer... That is highly irregular." Thorin asks if it's the phylactory that's shielded, or the lich; "A very good point, Mister Dwarf!"

* The lich is probably quite old and has learned from past mistakes!
* The identify spell does tell us that it's a Ring Of Power; a very powerful magical artefact in itself.
* Penny asks what such a ring does. Very rare. Associated with spellcasters of the arcane variety - wizards, sorcerers and the alike; it greatly extends the range of their abilities; gives them more power. Magical power.
* So we could destroy just the phylactory part, but that is probably quite complex; or just research how to destroy a Ring Of Power. Destroying that would destroy the phylactory - probably...!

All we can think of is going back to the tavern. Best we can think of is making enquiries about where giants might be and hope that a forge is good enough to destroy the artefact. The barmaid suggests we go to the market and ask for **Vaeni Greenlade**, a halfling jeweller with a store there, we might have some luck - rumour has it she once had an affair with a half-giant! She's there for the night market.

Once out of earshot Penny declares, "This place is fucked up."

### 6pm

We continue to kick around options, trying to figure things out. Dinner rolls around. We head to the night market as suggested.

It's lively - not as food as we expected; more just stalls. A dozen or so. We spot the jeweller halfling easily. She is next to another stall is called "**Nala and Rainforge**". It sells things that look like - well, cosplay. Overly (but beautifully) ornate weapons, armour, clothing, boots, pouches; it's very fine handiwork. Seems like it *should* be practical but it's certainly not utilitarian. "**Greenlade's**" own stall has a lot of different jewellery on it. It's a bit quiet here, which is perhaps not too surprising given the nature of the market.

"Lady Elf. I am Fuma! Fuma Nala" hails someone from the adjacent stand. "I think this would look amazing on you!" Francesc isn't too interested, but Penny realises that she could perhaps brighten up the outfit and look a bit more fancy - there are bracers, fine chain link, for just 1gp for the pair. Penny buys them and puts them on - it's a good addition to the rivets on the splint armour.

Vaeni has seen this (as we hoped) and is getting ready to hopefully serve actual customers! Francesc heads over. She looks and pulls out a box of earrings - then finds some - leaf earrings! They're very delicate and nice; they're a bit much; there's also some bow charms, but that's definitely too much. Francesc goes for the earrings. 1gp also.

Penny finishes up and wanders over. We start talking. Without trying to offend - she does know of a forge; it's all conspiratorial whispers! "It's the Star Forge! It's on the scale of a giant..." "Where is it?" "Oh... My goodness..." - she talks a while of a story, and ends up pulling out a travel diary. It transpires that in her wayward "middle age" she did indeed fall in love with a half-giant and wanted to see the world. They travelled. He showed her the world of his parent; and in the bowels of the earth, powered by a magma chamber, was the Star Forge - one of the most magical and powerful forges in existence. "However, finding the forge is just the first part. You need someone to operate it! It's been abandoned for centuries."

We learn that Fire Giants used to work the forge - 24 to 25ft tall. Thorin can't wildshape to anything that big. So not only would we need to find the forge, we'd need to find a willing fire giant. The location is a problem too - a long way south, more or less in the Greypeak Mountains. Parnast is a nearby town. From where we are, she figures it would be - well - at a guess - "about 500 miles from here? As the crow files?" (so that'd be 20-21 days).

"But. But! If you're thinking about something *like* that - I have it on authority from people who've come from Gauntlegrym - that there's a power in that old Dwarven city that *could* come close to the power of the giant's forge. If you want to risk it."

We thank her and finish up. We head back to the tavern and there's a lost-looking cleric there; he spots us and we realise this is the person who's going to cast the anti-scrying magic. He has a room ward for us that will, surprisingly, last until sunrise (DM fiat) - and he'll be here in the morning too! So that's great.

So, OK then - long rest.



## Day 10 - overnight

D8->4 rolled by Francesc overnight. At the end of her 4-hour meditation, she comes to full consciousness and hears yelling. At first she thinks it's just tomfoolery, but then distant bells start to ring. And more. **And more**. She wakes us immediately. First words out of Thorin's mouth - "Fucking lich!" - we can smell smoke.

The male owner thumps on the door. "Run to safety! Get to the basement! Helm's Hold is under attack!" - we tell him to head onward and keep safe and we quickly grab our stuff and run downstairs and outside.

On the street, we can see guards running, some in the process of hastily arming themselves - reserve guards, not on duty, running out of houses. We hear an almighty crash from outside the walls and some strange shape flies above us. There's the smell of acrid burning. Penny suspects a black dragon and says as much but (disadv perception) sees nothing (6). Francesc same. Thorin, though, 26 - he sees the clear outline of a dragon, especially as it flies past a plume of arcane fire being thrown up by the defenders. He sees, at the cathedral and stood in the bell tower section of the cathedral, is the Holy Watcher Queeria channeling a sunbeam to try and catch the dragon.

Penny claps Francesc on the back; "I'm sure you can get this!" and casts Heroism. It'll last a minute, but Francesc sees that the dragon has done a fly-by and gone out of 480ft range. Thorin adds in Guidance.

The Holy Watcher is trying to cast light and almighty commotion is going on at the top of the city walls. Penny says "Dragon's a distraction? Let's get to the wall!" and runs in that direction. Despite the brief head-start, Francesc finds it easy to leap onto the city wall in a matter of seconds - the inn is built into it; lots of ways to climb. Penny and Thorin trail in pursuit. We can see all sorts of melee behaviour. One knight even jumps, roaring, down off the wall into whatever is down below. A blast of arcane fire from the defenders briefly lights the scene.

* Stretching from the Mere Of Dead Men there seems to be a procession of bodies coming towards the walls. The city seems to be under siege by about 150-or-so undead of various kinds!
* There are some larger creatures amongst them. Quite close by is a 14-ft-or-so high humanoid that appears to wear regal armour - blue, white, gold, a helmet covering its face, but working for the enemy, attacking the walls like a living siege engine.
* (Via perception rolls) We see amongst the undead a magic shroud surrounding some kind of priest, who seems to be controlling some of these undead. Francesc points - we all agree - "Always taken down the spellcasters first!" - a bone mask lightly armoured, controlling the undead. About 60ft away from Francesc.
* Immediately behind there's another caster. A hood, caught on part of a bone shard of its scull - full bones, rather than a body - wearing the remnants of a diadem crown / mage's circlet; rings and bracelets; throws shadow spells. Not a lich.
* A dozen skeletons or so. Alchemist fire wipes out some of the skeletons.

Initiative:

* Thorin 16
* Francesc 14
* Penny 0

The priest looks around around; as it lifts its head we can see it is a human - alive! - and seems to complete some kind of spell. Ground around it starts to crack and rise - an Earth Elemental springs up.

Thorin tries to Charm the humanoid "siege engine". WIS 15 save; makes it. It is already, in fact, under some kind of control. He also creates some magic stones to throw.

The undead caster opens its mouth and smoke appears, gathers around it and then it looks at Thorin. It curses him. It is like a grey bolt formed from the smoke which flies at Thorin and strikes him. He takes 17 necrotic damage.

Francesc sees this attack and responds in kind. She attacks the undead caster back with all the trimmings - Hunter's Mark, Favoured Foe; attack roll is only 13 but that's enough, for *this* target at least, doing 19 piercing damage. The undead caster seems to resist a lot of the non-magical damage.

Some of the undead try to start to clamber up walls, using fallen bodies of other once-undead to help. The siege guy turns to Thorin (makes sense given the attack, but actually decided by dice roll). It seems focused on him... It throws a rock, trying to knock out the parapets to expose us to attack more easily. Crit `:-/` - it does 8d10+6 (!!) damage. A section of wall collapses. Thorin is fully exposed.

Penny runs over; grabs the stones; tries to throw it; misses wildly (nat 2+7); sees a nearby Paladin and jumps down to a nearby paladin (Athl 23). He turns - it's Javen! He says "Penny Jones?!"

The elemental slides through the earth and forms a land bridge to help the undead start to climb and attack Thorin; the attacks miss. Penny notes that the elemental is now within 30ft of her... That presents an opportunity which she *hopes* she might get to take.

The priest moves a distance away and casts Shatter at the gate. 9 damage. It's still in place but the stonework is cracking.

Thorin creates a (L2) small land beast spirit, which looks like a small wolf, in front of the undead caster; it attacks once and hits - 1d8+6->10 damage, of which it takes half. Thorin then Wildshapes into a brown bear.

The undead priest now exhales grave air, shrouding itself, solidifying as ice; it seems to have bolstered its defences.

Francesc draws a magic arrow and fires - 24 - hits! Magical damage too; no resistances. 20 damage total, all taken by the bad guy. That's enough! The arrow strikes it in the face (of course); the back of its scull explodes and it crumbles to dust. The cloak falls to the ground.

More undead try to use the undead land bridge created by the elemental. One makes it close enough to attack Thorin and hits; 1d6+2->8 damage.

The siege guy tries to bash down the gate, attacking it twice with a greataxe. Both attacks hit decisively; 25 and 28 damage; the outer gate is torn apart and the creature moves to the inner gate. "HOLD THE LINE!" shouts Javen.

Penny is now able to use her Abjure The Extraplanar feat to get the elemental to run - WIS 14 save; it rolls 8. She also switches to her Divine Favour spell. At this, the elemental runs, pulling all the skeletons that were using it as a land bridge with it. There's a gap in the wall and the skeletons are trampled!

The priest drops control of its elemental, which is now effectively rogue; it sticks its staff into the ground which shakes, then a ripple moves forward and a hand of stone bursts forth from the stonework right next to Francesc and tries to grapple her. It meets AC exactly, to hit; 14  bludgeoning damage. Not grappled, at least; it was an attack. She reacts with her Gift Of The Gem Dragon and the hand *just* misses its save; it takes 8 damage and is pushed away by 10ft. There's a strange reverberation through the ground and the priest calls out - she realises that the *priest* took the damage.

Thorin-bear climbs down the walls behind the siege guy. Bite attack is a crit! 2d8+4->1+5+4->10 (not great sadly, for a crit). The claw attack is high too, 23, hits; 2d6+4->9. As a bonus action, Thorin-bear mentally commands his spirit to attack the priest spellcaster. Another great roll; 23 to hit, doing 13 damage. Luckily, the attack damages the caster enough that their concentration fails on their spell and the giant earthen hand disappears (nat 1).

Francesc moves as far away from the hand as she can, while transferring Hunter's Mark and firing another magic arrow at the priest. Hits; 17 damage in total. The priest is very injured, but still just up. Remaining skeletons across the field start to fall, as he's losing control - all his energy to keep himself together it looks like! It looks up and screams out a long word in a language we don't understand - perhaps the name of the dragon, because the priest finishes the sentence with "...to the safety of the swamp!"

The siege guy attacks Thorin with an axe; it hits for 29, throwing him out of bear shape. The second attack *just* misses - 15 vs AC of 16. He's only on 22 AC now so a hit would've been bad news. Instead, he can react with Gift Of The Gem Dragon and, surprisingly, the big creature fails - it takes 10 damage and is thrown away from him, against the interior gate.

Penny has no line of sight on the priest so tries to stab through the gate. Just makes a hit! With Divine Smite, it takes 8 piercing damage, but 15 total radiant - which it is susceptible to; 38 taken. Javen asks her to keep her sword in place to skewer it (!) and attacks - also gets a 19; hits; a Divine Smite; he takes it down! It burns to a crisp and falls to ash.

There's a loud screech and roar from the air; a flurry of wind; the black dragon is flying by, swooping down, probably trying to save the priest. Francesc is given a shot at the creature for colour (DM fiat); 27 - definitely hits; then, dex save 23; Francesc dodges a wing that flies down as it tries to throw wind at her to knock her off the roof. It sweeps up the priest in a claw and tries to flee.

Francesc's not done. She has darkvision; she can still see the departing enemies; the claw gives the priest cover, but Sharpshooter bypasses that. Attack roll is 28! Hit, for 17 damage. A loud roar from the dragon, then a spray of acid arcs across the ground in anger, as it tosses the dead body of the priest away; it disappears into the night, heading for the swamp. The rest of the undead army is in disarray, collapsed or fumbling at random; the earth elemental staggers off into the distance - it'll be a danger for an hour while it might attack others, but we're in a remote location so, we hope, nobody will be hurt. We're not in a shape to pursue.

Javen claps Penny on the back, approaches Penny and says "May I?" and lays on hands, healing for 15. Penny heals Thorin for 20 (back to full). "That was very heroic!" says Javen at Penny (to the chagrin of Thorin and Francesc, who took the greater risks and did much more damage).

Francesc wants to recover her +1 arrows, which gives us time to search the battleground. Penny gets an unusually high investigation - 18 - and finds an Amulet Of Control, which is how the control was done. She heads over to find Francesc who's found her arrows in the human priest, but *doesn't* find a companion amulet there. Strange. Perhaps this one wasn't controlling anyone! Francesc does find a Necromancer's Ring; it can animate the dead! That goes in the backpack - Penny expresses grave concerns about using such an object. If we're going to destroy the phylactory, we should probably destroy that ring and the amulet at the same time.

Thorin tries Detect Magic to find the other amulet, but there are no other magic items on the human priest. Looking around he finds a strong magical aura on a pile of bones that he assumes was that undead caster. There's a longsword; strange looking; dark metal - as if forged from a strange, dark, blue-ish steel. It's a +1 longsword which would be something Penny might use but there's no way she's trusting it without further identification.

We figure we might be able to get Querria to Identify it. We figure we at least earned *something* in aiding them. We surmise the attack was nothing to do with the lich - and indeed Jared confirms that the priest and dragon attack from time to time. They've never been able to take down the priest; he's not sure how come he always seems to have so many undead. At this, Francesc shows the ring she found. We figure that was a mechanism of undead animation.

In town, paladins are busy healing people up, dealing with acid burns and the like; tidy up of damage is started. We get to the church. Javen finds Querria to make sure she's alright; he'd seen her at the tower during the first attack. They exchange looks - coded language?! Jared says they need a "quick chat in private". They enter her prayer room and the door is closed. Francesc and Thorin within a second have their ears up against the door!

Querria: "...no but I need it! We need it."

"Now you're being ridiculous. Why do you *need* it - think about this - I think it's pretty clear. Look, we're not sending a crusade with them; so *this* is how we help."

"It's my call to make."

"I know. I'm not taking that away from you. I'm just saying that..."

She interrupts - "Yes, in *your* day that's what you'd have done."

"I'm not arguing with that. I agree. I'm just asking that if *I* could have that, for me, then I would give it to them."

There's a sigh and an "OK"; the sound of things being moved around and footsteps towards the door. We back away quickly. She says:

"So I've been thinking that in return for your help in defending Helm's Hold today it seems only fair that we grant you these" - and she takes the box Javen is carrying. She's carrying an amulet herself; she hands us a box with *three* of them in. The same thing. Well, that's kind of amazing; except there's a fourth member of our party. Francesc tries to explain. We don't want to seem ungrateful but three doesn't cover us! Penny tries to help; persuasion 23!

Javen turns to look at Querria. She gives him a look, "don't you dare..." it seems to say; but then her face softens. She takes off the amulet. "Here. But when you're done with them *bring them back* so we can help other people!" "Of course."

Francesc remembers the sword, too. "Can you identify this?" "It's a magical sword with an enchantment that makes it keener and sharper." "No curses?" "Not that I'm aware of..." - Thorin was carrying it; offers it to Penny; Penny takes it.
