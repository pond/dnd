# RIPA: Part 35
## Session 35 (2024-04-02)
### Day 35, Neverwinter

We've found our way into a walled garden at one of Valindra Shadowmantle's mansions, in Neverwinter. It seems to have been recently abandoned. A discovery of a vampire tree has led to the largely accidental summoning (by said tree!) of two *ghosts* who can, in theory, answer our questions about where Shadowmantle has gone.

Penny, Insight 6. The spectres are heading towards us as a group; she can't tell if they're headed to, say, Thorin, or all of us. She tries raising her sun blade at full brightness and shouting out, "Halt, undead things, and answer our questions!" but they ignore her and drift forwards - now it looks like they're focused on Thorin.

Thorin and Francesc note that they both seem female, but look different.

* One is spectral - translucent - in a flowing, sanity, strappy kind of nightgown. She looks maybe half-elven, but has no hair on her head, as if shaved; her skin looks dark, but not black. She wears various rings and bangles.

* The other is a wraith; less well formed, harder to make out, straggly hair; identifiably female but only just, given the indistinct form that wraiths take.

Penny, religion 9, does not recognise what type of ghosts these are or what that might mean. The spectral one speaks first, generally addressing us, facing all - "I was told to expect intruders or visitors, I forget if there is much of a difference between them; I believe you are the ones I am expecting - although you are hidden from sight, or at least you were until I saw you with my own eyes. Why are you here?"

Arturo says it's just a precaution - nothing personal; here to visit our "good friend, tree"! Deception 29. We are invited in... Penny puts the sun blade away. "Sure!". We are led to the outer door; her spectral hand rises and traces a sigil; the door opens. It's recognised as a sigil of Knock, a spell, so we'd need to know that spell to repeat the action.

A rug; wall hangings; curtains all drawn. A lobby of sorts, so it seems we were in a front garden. Arturo and Penny team up, with Arturo doing a lot of the talking. The wraith drifts into a corner as the spectre keeps talking. Arturo says we want to broker a deal with Valindra. But "You're a little late - she's left for Baldur's Gate. She has a villa on the hill; I can tell her to expect you...?" and Arturo says yes. There are only four old estates on hills outside the city and she describes the distinctive features of Valindra's place.

"She did instruct me to expect someone, and did instruct me to ask you for her ring back."

"It's very precious. We'll only give it to her in person."

The spectre insists that we can't leave without giving the ring back. The spectre and wraith drift away; we debate. We want an audience to find out more about VS; so real or faux diplomacy must persist. But we can't give up the ring and won't even admit to having it. Spectre and wraith return; she insists on giving the ring; Arturo insists he doesn't have it - deception 16. The spectre's insight matches that; "I don't blame you for trying! It is very powerful. But it would be *very* unwise of you to hold onto it." We insist that this is our leverage for brokering a deal... The spectre huffs and looks a bit resigned; then says, "Very well" and touches a pendant around her neck. Francesc (religion 20) sees a large ring hanging off a necklace; the ring has a black face with a misshapen kind of almost-human scull on it; around it is the skeleton of a large snake eating its own tail; she is mumbling a few words...

...Penny tries Counterspell. Even using Inspiration Penny's Arcana check is 14; L4 or lower; not good enough. A gate of some sort opens, mist flowing below. A very familiar faced figure steps forward, but with pale, almost white hair. It's **Valindra Shadowmantle**, in person.

"I had a feeling you might be difficult" she say. "Come with me. Let's go somewhere more civilised!"

She leads us out of the lobby-like room, through the house, up stairs and into an upper floor large front room with various chairs and other pieces of lavish furnishings. The spectre and wraith guard the exit. But we note the window in this room is upper storey; no wards...

"Before I ask you for the ring again, you've gone to a lot of effort to track down where I live, to come into my garden... Speak."

Penny says she is worried that Valindra summoning demons and that this will spell doom for the plane. "I am not summoning demons. The Drow are summoning demons." Francesc asks why Mummy Lord Vallin things Valindra is doing it. "I don't know. She is misguided. She believes strongly in a _version_ of the prophecy; but I interpret it differently."

Thorin insight nat 20 -> 29. She's not lying!

* Over the next few minutes, she describes that there are various signs and portents
* A lot of related prophecies related to those are nonsense - fearful, ambiguous
* But the particular one we are interested in has initials that made her take note
* The initial prophecy was that a "V.S." would *help* this power come back; she's decided to oppose it though; so Valindra thinks that this now refers to Vallin, and it's *Vallin* who wants to bring this ancient power back.
* She's made it her life's work to thwart it
* She thinks it's a distraction for something else
* She thinks Vallin has been corrupted / tricked; she does not have pure sight anymore.

Arturo gives away that we saw an Obscura at Vallin's treasure room. "That explains a lot!" - but she doesn't realise Arturo is under its influence! (DM roll). "It shows only a twisted version of reality and the future. It has its own mind."

Francesc asks why Valindra wants to thwart it - "I don't want a new world order" - the ancient power does not share!

Penny asks why some think that extraplanar beings, from far beyond the region of initial influence of the Drow demon incursion, might be coming through; and why people might believe these are headed towards Valindra. She does, after all, have the dark shard.

She claims that these are being sent by the Big Bad to kill her; she's the only thing standing in their way; she *needs* the phylactory back. Thorin insight 24 - it really is something she believes.

That's a turn-around.

Penny pushes... "What do you use the dark shard for?" "How do you know about that?!" - she claims to not have the shard on her. "It is a very dangerous object. I've been using it to keep tabs on a being that I believe may consciously or unconsciously be a pawn or maybe more than a pawn. A knight or bishop, of this force! It's found a way to break free of its prison and entered our plane."

So Penny takes the plunge. "You have been seeking the same tablets that we have." "So you have been seeking some too?" "Yes" "Have you found some?" "Yes" "**I have three of them**."

Thorin knows she's not doing this out of the goodness of her heart. But only so that she can keep power. And if the chance arose, from getting powerful artefacts to counter the Big Bad, to gain even more power herself using them - she'd do so, without doubt.

She concurs that putting the 7 tablets together might provide a way to get an object for dealing with this being "should the *plans to keep him away fail*".

Penny admits, "Now those plans are *not* something we know about." "No. They're not! There are forces far older and much more powerful than the likes of the four of you, who have been working on this for a matter of days. There's no reason for you to know this. You took my ring for no reason at all!"

Self-assigned DC13 WIS save for Penny; she rolls 13. The enemy of the enemy is my friend. The others start shenanigans...

...so Penny explains that it sticks in her throat, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And then Penny says, "But she said that she'd have killed us already and taken the ring. And she says we have no power and we're basically useless." So Penny turns to VS and says, "So if you wanted us dead, you'd have done it already. You must be concerned, at some level, about coming to harm."

At this, Valindra points a finger at Arturo and casts Power Word Kill. He falls; Thorin tries to Revivify but VS counterspells. In an instance, Francesc grabs an object at random from the bag of holding and tries to use the Helm (dice roll) - but the object was from another plane! Of all the things to grab. The spell fizzles!

"Just stop. CHILDREN!" shouts Valindra. "I'll bring him back. Just stop."

Ugh. Fine. "Fine" says Penny. "But if you fuck us over, or hurt us in any way, any cooperation stops. We can be more resourceful than you expect, and you just gave away some of your abilities. We're quick learners." And Thorin pretty much threatens her - "You can't kill all of us!" - so she points a finger at him and a thin green ray springs from her finger - a Disintegrate spell. DEX save... Even with inspiration, Thorin fails by a mile. 76 points of force damage! And - he's not even dead!

(But we realise that if he'd taken a bit more he might've turned to dust and couldn't be raised).

To our collective astonishment Thorin reacts with Gift of the Gem Dragon, which pushes the rest of his party back ten feet. Got to admire the spirit of the idea though.

Penny repeats, louder, "Fine! What now then?"

"Which one of you has the ring?" - the spectre is sent over and collects her phylactory. So much for giants and star forges.

Thorin's not done yet though - Thorin hasn't handed her the phylactory. Thorin's handed over Stonky's ring. Valindra just pockets it and asks for her *real* ring. Francesc has it. She produces it; the spectre takes it. Valindra draws a sigil which creates some kind of ripple in the air. She pops the ring inside; it seals. At least she keeps her word; Arturo is resurrected.

She has three tablets. "You have two. There are two missing" she says. She's done with Neverwinter; her searches take her further South. "I need to figure out how these tablets work; why they're important." She only cares about what's on the tablets, she says, so Thorin suggests that she gives the ones she has to us. "Why don't I just give you a copy?" she counters. We are to meet at her villa in Baldur's Gate.

She says that one option is to try and *close* this plane; at least as a temporary solution; but it'd only be a matter of time before other realms fell and we were isolated.

"Don't look so glum... You were never meant to have this ring..."

Rich suggests we can at least stop worrying about the amulets!

To our surprise, VS offers us something; name our price. Arturo asks for a magic item he had an interest in; she agrees; Thorin asks for the shard! The mummy lord's pact, and all that. So she says no, but asks why. He explains his deal with Vallin. "Interesting!" she says; Penny & Francesc insight 19. Oh. A lightbulb moment for Valindra... **"Vallin wants it. That can only mean she doesn't know what it does, or she does know but wants to contact them... I'm still unsure if Vallin is a chaotic element or a cleverly disguised insidious element placed on this board. Is she a wildcard? Or is she an actual piece?"**

(This of course is a reminder about why we should all keep our amulets).

Francesc asks for a better bow. Yes! And - "Tell you what, Dwarf. When I'm sure that the threat has been neutralised, the shard is yours. And paladin! What would you ask of me?"

Penny thinks for a moment, then says, "A headband of intellect."

Valindra pauses for a moment, says something to the wraith; it goes through the wall and returns with a headband. Valindra hands it to Penny. "Double-edged sword this, really. Sometimes knowing too much can make things less clear! But like any good tool it depends on the wielder." Penny says, "And unlike an intellect gifted by nature, this can be simply removed." "That's right. But be aware... It doesn't give you knowledge. If you were to take it off, the knowledge goes with it. So be careful."

She looks to Thorin, who's not looking very healthy. "You might want to sleep that off!" she says.

We are shown the door by the spectre.

Falcon Manor; that's the name in Baldur's Gate. We are to meet her here. It's the middle of the day. Thorin is quite injured. We're shaken. Penny says, "Where's the nearest bar?"

If nothing else we have got a taste of the level of power Valindra bears.

We end up in a bar near the under-rebuild arena. The **Five Frogs** Tavern. They're on the sign in the colours of the five chromatic dragons. A heavy-set bar lady called **Muriel** asks us what we'll have. Porridge with meats, or vegetable soup with bread. Three soups, except of course for Thorin! Drinks - a black brew? A daytime drink? We figure - mastica. Or ale? Ale! There's one on special. That's a win! Specials. "Neverember's Neverending Sleep", apparently; since he's awake they're trying to get rid of it.

We end up at a table with (very) large flagons of the bargain ale, along with big bowls of the food. The ale is cheap, the food is expensive, but the food is very good.

It feels like a failure, losing that phylactory. But we're getting some magic items. We're getting the tablet transcriptions. We got a lot of information. And we're alive. Sigh. Valindra knows we can teleport, but doesn't know we can do that to Baldur's Gate specifically. Thorin's armour will be ready in a few days. We might as well spend some time at our keep, see how everyone's doing, then hop back here, get the armour and get to Baldur's Gate via helm. For all Valindra will know, we went by boat.

Penny is toying with the headband. She'd have to un-attune from something. Might be worth it. Might not be.

So, we go home. People have been busy! **We can all add 2 x L9 facilities to the Bastion.**

* Greenhouse (Thorin)
* Laboratory (Thorin)
* Sacristy (a shrine in the gardens) (Penny)
* Scriptorium (Francesc)
* Teleportation Circle (in the tower) (Arturo)
* Training Area (Arturo) - specialising in stealth
* Training Area (Francesc) - specialising in lock picking tools
* Trophy Room (entrance hallway, tower) (Penny)

Most things are hosted in a new outbuilding or just the grounds in general. We also all roll 6d4 (max 24) to set up Bastion Points, having lost track prior.

* Arturo 18
* Francesc 17
* Penny 13
* Thorin 15

The upcoming bastion turn is then rolled for as 2d4 and 2d6 for the L5 and L9 rooms we now have, adding:

* Arturo total 22 (bad luck, rolled *four 1s!*)
* Francesc total 30
* Penny total 31
* Thorin total 32

A scroll of Remove Curse is commissioned for 200gp. Thorin starts harvesting herbs, considering rare portions; expensive at 2000gp, but he figures - damage resistance from a Potion Of Invulnerability sounds useful for him. Thorin has to spend a full day in his new laboratory crafting it.

Time passes. Night falls; we sleep.



### Days 36-38, our keep, near Candlekeep

It's almost disorientating to wake up somewhere safe. And we realise there's one less thing to worry about - for now, as far as we know, there's no lich trying to find and kill us.

The keep is a hive of activity. The rest of the day is spent by people doing stuff - hirelings, or ourselves, writing spells and so-on. Penny is interested in trying to do better with stealth in her armour, so she joins in training in the new training area for the day.

Vilhamena sets to work on the red dragon scale shield.

Francesc wants another 500gp for a Revivify scroll that's stand-alone; no 300gp diamond needed. That's in case of emergencies, but very useful as a one-shot dead certain way to bring someone back (at least within the usual other constraints of Revivify).

Arturo invites someone from Candlekeep to visit via our new teleportation circle. There's a roll involved but the outcome is that the decline! Learning that he did this because he tires of his blue skin curse, Penny dials in Remove Curse one morning and casts it for him.

By the end of day 38, we figure we'll teleport to Neverwinter. The Helm will then regain its charge overnight and we can go to collect the armour.

Before we go, the Bastion asks what we want them to do. More 2d4, 2d6 rolls are permitted (DM fiat to accelerate use of Bastion, since our fast-travel ability means the days pass much more slowly for us than they might for parties moving between major cities on e.g. horseback).

* Francesc 44
* Penny 47
* Arturo 33
* Thorin 41

Mayastan has updated a report on killing a lich, and the crystal golems. On liches:

* If you kill a lich and their phylactory has been destroyed they *really do* die. Definitely confirmed.
* **They are susceptible to radiant damage but very resistant to a lot of other things and indeed immune to many.**
* **Immune to normal physical damage or poison**
* **Resistant to cold, lightning, necrotic**
* **Cannot be charmed, frightened, paralysed or exhausted**
* **Automatically resist effects a certain number of times** (Legendary Actions)
* **They can paralyse with a touch!**

His advice is to avoid liches.

On golems:

* **Immune to poison, cant be blinded, charmed, deafened, petrified, exhausted or frightened.**
* **Automatically succeed on any spell saving throws of L7 or below**!
* **Attack rolls of any spell L7 or below will always miss.**
* **Worse, if a spell misses, a golem can redirect it to another creature.**

His advice is to instead release them from a curse; find the removed organ, get it next to them and cast Remove Curse; (or create a tincture using the ash of Vallin).

With everything wrapped up, we head over to Southside Ales, Neverwinter, by helm. This time, we step through the portal and people are looking up at us. They look to the barman who just nods; we look up and see a sign. "Do not sit here - frequent rift opens" - there's no table in the space now! We tip the bar 10gp.

We get food and drink here. They are delighted to be paid in copper pieces... They fetch a scale so Penny can weigh it out! We need a place to sleep though; we remember that Five Frogs called itself a tavern but had rooms like an inn, so head there. One room so we can set up Alarm. We might not be being chased by a lich but we're still being chased by everything else! 5sp, paid in copper too.

The usual for Watch.

* Arturo: Perception 7. He sleeps soundly!
* Thorin: Perception 19. He's not happy being back in the city. Noisy and smelly.
* Francesc: Perception 9 - unusually low. Like Thorin, she doesn't like the city.x
* Penny: Perception 2 -> 4! *BUT* - Francesc on watch is more awake now with Penny up too, perception 26.

Francesc hears voices outside. What's unusual is that there are voices outside of people who seem like they're deliberately trying to be quiet; they're in the alleyway outside, on the ground floor - we're on floor 2. She alerts Penny and tries to stealthily open the window to look down. Stealth 27, with newfound training-gifted proficiency.

Two figures, wearing cloaks, are talking to each other. She can *just* hear - "That wasn't meant to happen! You've screwed it all up! We're going to get into trouble. We need to leave town... This is *on you*. You need to explain this." "No! Nobody needs to know. You need to get out now!" - they start to run off. Francesc considers chasing, but doesn't want to leave the party so, instead, she casts Web! DEX 15. Both are entangled. Penny decides to get down there by jumping! ATHL 25... And they wriggle free. She shouts, "Stop! Or my friend will shoot you in the back of the head and I'll have a good at you with *this*" - but while saying this she lunges at one of them to grab them. Unarmed strike - nat 20! She gets a good hold. The other stops. "But - but - why are you attacking us?" says one. "Francesc?!" calls up Penny.

Francesc explains she overheard stuff. We want to know more. They argue that we're thugs, who caught them! Well, insight 15 Penny, that's kind of fair. But Francesc is also very suspicious of people under our window whispering.

There's to-and-fro. They argue that they witnessed murders. They screw-up was that one of the murderers saw them. They want to get their families and get out. We want them to give us descriptions and they do they best they can but the murderers were seen at a distance and hard to spot. They're runners - smugglers - tried to take a shortcut near a rift, seeing chainmail guards dragging some tied up people onto an altar and killed them. They can tell us where we can find it.

Penny ends up casting Nondetection on both. An expensive gambit - 25gp each - they at least can't be targeted by magic scrying now. They run away.

Thorin is *not* impressed at the expenditure. But we're up and awake and he says - "if we're going to go to any catacombs, let's get my armour!"



### Day 39

The armourer was already up, apparently waiting for us, figuring we'd be there first thing!

She fetches the black, dragonscale tailored armour. It even comes with an optional helm that she explains is mostly for show...! There are gauntlets and shoulder pads, and even some decorations of teeth to try and add to the intimidation effect. It takes a while to get Thorin fitted, including using an awl to get extra holes for leather bindings and so-on. 

**Finally! The armour is done.** He has to swap attunement with his protective cloak, but still ends up going from 17 (with cloak) to 19 (with attuned armour). There are also some saving throw advantages too along with acid resistance.

(End of part 35)
