# RIPA: Part 37
## Session 37 (2024-04-23)
### Day 40, time unclear

Most of the party waits above a vast channel that drops, we believe, around 2km straight down - a shortcut to reach Annam's Cradle, where we *hope* to find another stone tablet.

Thorin used a combination of wildshapes and short rests to drop quickly as a giant serpent. Our crazy plan calculated his maximum falling speed and how bad his injuries would be if he simply fell the full distance; it *seemed* survivable... but we never expected the fall to open out into a giant cavern full of prehistoric plants and creatures. Thorin saw some Quetzalcoatlus flying and, whether or not he had any idea what they were, this allowed him to Wildshape into their form and fly to a safe landing. Back in his Dwarven druid form, he stands atop a mesa looking down at the bizarre landscape around.

The space is immense. Tens of miles across. There are lots of giant trees below. A few other plateaus nearby with some canyons between them; there's also a huge river - it must be at least a mile wide! - that flows quite close by, some 6 miles to the West. There's a massive column of rock, several miles thick, that rises towards the vast cavern ceiling and disappears out of view into clouds.

This seems like a good time to fetch backup!

Thorin searches on the ground around and finds a decent-sized rock. It is clearly part of this landscape and not something that might've been placed or otherwise fallen from elsewhere, based on how it looks compared to the many other bare rock faces around. He teleports.

Back at the party camp, the 'fishermen' left some time ago; we've had a long rest; D20 each:

* Francesc 20
* Arturo 14
* Penny 13

...which means that we all are at the camp, rather than wandering off exploring, when Thorin appears through a reality tear; and we see, very briefly though it, something impossible - sunlit, lush rainforest.

"What was *that*?" asks Penny as Francesc expresses her disappointment that Thorin isn't dead... Penny wonders if he perhaps fell all the way through the world?

Thorin doesn't explain, gleefully liking the idea of us being in dark! But - Francesc has Thorin's staff and Thorin has the helm. They really do need to swap. An hour is spent attuning. During that time Penny refuses to let Thorin get away with silence and tries to persuade him to at least tell us *something*. Persuasion 27 against insight 16! It ruins Thorin's fun but - he explains. At least we won't be going down there, be blinded by the sun and eaten by weird giant flying creatures. We're a bit worried because Thorin thinks he *might* have fallen to another plane, in which case the helm won't work - but we'll have to try it anyway. Worst thing that would happen, based on our experience with VS and the infamous pillow, is that the spell will fail. And Arturo points out at that Thorin got back to us - so it *must* work.

An hour passes. We hastily pack camp and the helm is used again.

We're ready for bright light! We have our eyes guarded. We appear back on the mesa. Of course, it still takes some time to adjust. We start t realise that it's all kind of an illusion; there are walls to the cavern, and above those clouds there seems to be some kind of actual strange dimensional rift. This is the light; it's not a sun, it's a tear in reality. We also see the (literally) Giant runes that Thorin noticed; Francesc identifies as them as runes related to Creation and Life.

It feels odd here. We're too small! Trees, flowers, everything is just giant. Megaflora. We see the giant flying creatures Thorin had seen and (reluctantly!) described. Other megafauna moves around noisily. We are on guard; Thorin casts PWAT from his staff.

So, we assume this is Annam's Cradle, or at least, the Cradle is here somewhere. But this place is huge; how could we find a tablet in amongst all this?

Thorin suggests he could fly as a scout; we could travel by river; he thinks he might've seem some kind of ruins to the South East. Thorin noticed to the far North West while falling that there was a really huge waterfall, so by luck, this means that the river seems to flow in that direction.

We all agree. Water route it is. Trouble is, we're atop the mesa and it's not really walkable - a 350ft drop, almost sheer. Arturo suggests feather fall - we might be able to fly on the new creature Thorin has learned, but jumping is more fun! He casts his spell; we run and jump off dramatically; and then float gently, but swiftly to, getting down before the spell fades.

It's really strange. Everything is the wrong scale. It's stranger up close than on the mesa, and we realise distances were probably greater than we judged because the objects we might've used to judge distance were bigger than we thought.

Penny helps Francesc lead the way. Francesc ADV survival, 20+7->27. She decides to take us south, along a canyon path, towards the river. It takes a full 2 hours to get clear of the main jungle but we think there are still about 2 miles left to go. Here, there are trees, but it's much less dense. Undergrowth rises to about 5 feet and trees are more sparse.

Francesc, perception 24 (and Thorin, 23). Movement in the undergrowth to our left and then, a bigger distance away, the right. Francesc is considering investigating - but Thorin breaks into a run! We give chase. As soon as we do, the movement starts to converge towards us.

ATHL/ACRO:

* Penny 20
* Francesc 10
* Arturo 7
* Thorin 6

Penny very unusally finds herself in front of everyone, wondering where they've all gone! Behind her, Francesc's foot has snagged on a vine just as Thorin trips and Arturo falls over him.

Crashing out from the undergrowth from Thorin's left is a large, 3-4 tall, thick carapace beast with long antennae. Thorin DEX save 21, he rolls out of the way but the creature just kind of - crawls over him; ambles; he takes a bit of damage; Arturo likewise ends up under its feet, DEX save 12, he is knocked fully prone. Another creature appears next, antennae check the party but aren't a threat apparently; it continues. Then the two creatures detect each other, rear up and start to fight.

Penny sees the bronze, armoured, giant centipedes ride over the party and fight. She comes over to help people back to their feet. **"We're like insects to the insects here!"** comments Arturo.

The two creatures are fighting very viciously. It would be *bad* to be the target of either of those! Francesc, insight 15; she thinks the four of us, if we got the jump on one of them, might, if lucky, be able to prevail.

We back away as quietly as we can. PWAT, as we keep close together, means that the undergrowth closes back up behind us.

Fortunately, we have no direct confrontation from any other creatures, though there is *plenty* of life around, until we get to grasslands - even the grass being giant - close to the river. There are some stands of trees here and there and the jungle stretches down to the river's edge further South of us.

We're not in the clear yet - there's a reed bed in between us and the river. So what now? We will build a raft or ride on a wildshape beast of some kind? Perhaps we could create something from these giant reeds. With Francesc's help, Penny starts trying to "farm" some of the reeds to fashion a raft; survival 24; we get quite a few. ATHL with Francesc's help again, 15, it's just enough to be able to form a woven raft. It's about 8ft by 8ft. That's good, but we need something to use as an oar or a pushing pole.

Thorin looks around; perception 29; a 15ft tall reed is found; Francesc 27; but on approach Francesc sees a pair of eyes looking from the water's surface. Then a second pair. Both glow a strange dull yellow; an unnatural appearance and huge - around a foot across. A change in the wind brings a bad smell from the direction of the creatures too... Decay, like a bog with things rotting in it. The two sets of eyes are about 30ft apart from each other.

Arturo and Penny are near the bank, but some reeds and river are still between them and high ground. Francesc gets the feeling, given the positioning, that these creatures were hunting us - isolating us - they're blocking our route to safety. They rise. 25ft above the water; rotting looking fetid; huge legs, tiny arms, fat torso; there's no way to avoid a fight! (Undead t-rex?!)

Initiative (with +4 aura):

* Thorin 24
* Francesc 18
* Arturo 15
* Penny 5 (sigh)

There's a gap between them - if we could make it through, we could get to dry land.

Thorin tries Erupting Earth, L4, 20ft cube. It hits both of the vast undead creatures, potential 24 damage each and both fail their saves; he then wildshapes into a giant scorpion and moves to face down one of the two creatures.

Francesc withdraws to a safer distance (!) and fires at the t-rex that Thorin is facing. She throws everything into it, with Sharpshooter; just makes the hit; 31 damage! Second shot; hits; another high 29 damage.

At this the *other* zombie t-rex roars - well, it's kind of hoarse, as if hacking up a hairball - but instead of that, a zombified beetle is thrown up! It falls to the ground in front of it. It sees the scorpion engaging the other t-rex but then notices the rest of our party. (Dice roll). It decides to go for the scorpion. It moves alongside then tries a bite - but that misses! The erupted earth causes it to stumble. It moves a bit to get better footing and tries swinging its tail - towards Penny. Matches AC to hit; 18 bludgeoning damage. Penny tries her gem dragon reprisal and surprisingly - it works! (Nat 1 on its STR save). 2d8->5 damage and it is pushed back a bit.

Arturo summons a large spirit dragon. He moves back a little and his spirit moves in to attack the t-rex that hit Penny, but flies up and realises it can get an angle to hit both with a breath weapon. The DEX save DC is 19, but with -2 on DEX they can't succeed it. 2d6 -> 4 damage each. Further attacks do 23 damage to the nearest creature.

Now the first t-rex acts; the giant scorpion is the most obvious enemy. It goes for the bite and gets a hit - *32* piercing damage; but due to the scorpion's size, it can't hold the creature in its maw. Then it spits out a zombie frog!

Penny's turn - and despite the danger there's not much choice but to run in and get to melee range. She attacks the other t-rex. Just gets a hit. With L1 Divine Smite, 4d8+5 -> 23; again; hit again, 22 damage. There's a slice through its chest cavity that lets us see into the rib cage; where its stomach should be are more writing zombie limbs! Things it has eaten that did not die and became undead. That's very not good.

The frog attacks the scorpion in a lunge. Hits! 7 bludgeoning damage. Reaction reprisal, gem dragon - the creature is thrown back, taking 8 damage, which is enough to sort-of take it down; CON save; it comes back up with 1hp. The beetle zombie lumbers towards Francesc and Arturo, gets close but doesn't have time left for an attack just yet.

The giant scorpion attacks the nearby t-rex (the one that first approached). Two claw attacks - both miss, sadly! The stinger finds its mark, though; 1d10+2->9 piercing; but it's immune to poison damage, since it's undead.

Francesc moves away from the zombie beetle, risking an opportunity attack but it misses; she fires at the t-rex Thorin just attacked. Just makes the hit - 35 damage! It's falling apart and a truly horrifying sight as a result, but still up. This one *also* has a stomach full of zombie creatures. So, Francesc tries a lightning arrow; solid hit; this affects the t-rex and the creatures inside it. The t-rex pretty much explodes at the damage. 3 zombies spill out. DEX 15 save for each; lightning damage potential is only 2d8->5 each though. The effect hits the scorpion (which takes 2 damage, making the save) and even the other t-rex; all four creatures fail, taking 5 lightning.

T-rex B shakes itself and looks down at Penny... But first, it coughs up another zombie... And it notices the gem dragon and the scorpion. (Dice roll). The gem dragon is at mouth height so it tries a bite! And lucky for the t-rex, unlucky for the dragon, it matches the dragon's AC for a huge *34* damage this time. Again, though, grappling is not possible. Now it swings its tail at the scorpion. Again it matches the AC! 19 damage. 1hp left!

Arturo throws a carefully-placed fireball which hits a lot of the bad guys and just avoids the good. It gets some new arrival zombies and remaining t-rex, but three zombies are out of range. None of the creatures are able to avoid the blast, the DEX save DC being a very high 19, and the damage roll is 34. Those zombies are immediately wiped out. The t-rex on the other hand - is *just* hanging in there! The gem dragon flies in and finishes the job... and luckily, this time, only 1 zombie manages to survive that and falls out. The gem dragon attacks one that's close by, 13 damage from the claw; it falls and stays down. It flies around and gets 6 damage to two by breath weapon, one just at the edge of range, the cone positioned carefully to avoid hitting Penny. The distant one had bounced back with 1hp - and bounces back yet again at this new attack. Thorin-scorpion gets caught too, though and having only 1hp left, turns back into Thorin.

Penny manages to flank the zombie threatening Arturo - ADV attack, nat 20, but 2d8 damage is only 6; + 5, total 11, and being a crit, it falls. She throws a javelin at high range and *does* get a hit - but the annoying frog goes down, then comes right back up again for a third time! Now the apparently unkillable undead frog runs up to Thorin; hits, bludgeoning only 2 damage and he reacts with Gem Dragon - it fails its save; 2d8 force damage; it takes 9, is pushed 10ft back, another save; and extraordinarily, **it comes back a fourth time** with 1hp.

Penny is somewhat disturbed by this. *Surely* this is some unholy creature protected by demons! "I don't like it here and I want to go home!" she shouts.

The other remaining zombie runs up to try and tackle Thorin, but the gem dragon gets a 10ft-reach opportunity attack, hits and fully takes it down.

Now it's Dwarf Vs Frog. He activates his staff and hits; 11 damage. And finally! It falls and *stays down*.

"Meliki, I don't know what you think you're doing but you need to get your shit together down here" mutters Penny, in an unconventional prayer, as we look around to the numerous chunks of zombie flesh that surround us. Thorin tries to help with a religion check; 1, 4 minus 1 -> 3. Nope.

Francesc investigates... She sees etches on the sculls - a giant rune of death. This was probably actually a rather convoluted form of security! Thorin suggests more investigations. Arturo's dragon is around for a while; it clears out a few more strange zombie creatures - including a zombie dragon fly with only two wings, both on the same size! Arturo via the dragon sees that these things seem to be centred - oh, oddly, to the North West, by a nearby giant rock pillar.

Arturo thus suggests that we ignore the ruins to the south and consider going upriver, which at least we can do on foot. We leave the raft pulled up well clear of the river bank and start walking.

The pillar is the one we saw from them mesa. From down here it's hard to comprehend; it goes right up into the clouds and, when those move and we see gaps, seem to reach the cavern roof. It seems impossible - its sides are jagged, but seem largely vertical. Close up we see there are sort of fins of rock, with big junks of 10 or 12ft high boulders that have fallen and embedded themselves into the ground around. They seem to be bits of these "fins" that have eroded away over time. Looking closer, it seems like these fins were once very geometric - unnaturally so - constructed; but now, things have eroded and fallen.

Arturo tries asking dragon to fly up. He wants see if there is a top, or if it connects with the cavern ceiling. It takes a while to get high enough to even see the top, in the clouds; but there is one - yet it's about a mile high! As the dragon comes downwards, though, it changes upon the sight of some kind of unnatural-looking entrance. It some 500ft above ground. Climbing might be possible but would be dangerous.

Arturo suggests that - if we don't mind splitting up - we could ride the dragon up there in two tranches. Penny hands-on heals Thorin and herself, then Arturo and Thorin head up. They see giant bats sleeping in some of the crevices and folds on this huge rock pillar, but don't awaken and attack. The gem dragon, about half way through its spell time now, lands on a roughly flat area and drops them off, quickly returns and soon we're all back together.

We're looking at a 30ft high break in the wall that at first glance might seem like a cavern, except a building has been constructed just inside. There's a rather ruined aspect. A round tower used to stand towards our right, East, but it has fallen.

* Penny perception 19
* Francesc investigation 12
* Arturo arcana 17
* Thorin religion 8

This place is huge. Hundreds of feet. Again, on approach our sense of scale was way off. There is no vegetation here, but there *is* something greenish about the rock. Strange, deep purple stains noticed by Arturo form a semicircle in form of us - which reminds me of the innate, magical state he detected permeating through the Underdark (the "**Faezress**", manipulated by the Drow for their magic). Debris of rock from walls, some 10-20ft thick, lies around because - worryingly - something seems to have exploded outwards and destroyed them. We detect no magical traces; it seems like simple physical force along time ago, from the inside, pushing out.

There is a door set into the wall break that's 20-odd ft high to our right. And in front of us - very bizarre. Melted rock, that's extended out, melted out into globules, suspended in air. It looks almost organic in shape, but is clearly made of rock. It seems to be protruding out from the rest of the rock. Thorin investigates, this being stonework and rock; double proficiency on history; 14+8->22.

There's obvious difference between the rock of the pillar and the rock of the block work. Something or someone brought a different type of stone up here. The tower to the right is perfectly circular with giant-scale arrow slits. Arturo thinks that the scale is quite large compared to the giants he has seen so far, but we know there are different kinds of giant and some are larger than others.

The stone type is also something that Thorin *knows* cannot be worked into shapes that he sees in the melted area. Actual melting would change the composition of the stone due to temperature - so at first glance, this would seem to be impossible. Arturo points out that some magic users have the ability to meld stone magically. The effect seems to be kept within the purple circle.

Penny casts Detect Magic. She gets up close to the "melted" rock. Magic *is* still present there; but she realises it has been here for hundreds of years. It must have been *very* powerful - it's not transmutation, either; she can't quite figure it out, so she describes it to Arturo; and he thinks it must be something from the far realm. It just doesn't belong in this world. There's a rather maddening, crazy aspect when seen this way. We theorise that this must have something to do with the rift, but Penny's sword - which emanates energy from the Positive Plane - has a signature which matches the rift, so she thinks it might go there and *not* the Far Realm.

It's very confusing!

Penny and the dragon approach the door. She activates Divine Sense. The dragon and her push. Penny ADV ATHL 25. It takes a *lot* of effort - but it does open! Nothing from Divine Sense. There's another big door behind it, but there's a fallen rock section that means she can just walk around it. The others now approach, emboldened by neither Penny or the dragon melting!

Inside, we see the other half of the strange magical circle. The space we're in now looks very like an entrance hall of a giant-scale fortified keep... So suddenly, there is a strange familiarity. The circle continues behind another wall to the left with a big door; Penny and Francesc can't open it, and need the dragon's help again. There's another big room, with the remainder of the circle and the melt-like effect still centred within that, but nothing else.

Penny asks Francesc and Thorin - "if this was a keep, where would you keep your valuables? Where would the treasure be?"

Thorin, insight 29. Well, it won't be only one floor! He looks around and sees a smaller door at an angle; we open it; there are stairs, headed down. OK, so that's one option. But maybe it's up, in the tower. So we check that next. A broken central spiral staircase leads up, but the floor above has collapsed. The stairs do continue down, though, too.

Always a completist, Thorin decides to open more doors on the same floor to see what's here. Through some, a bedroom with adjacent study; more blown out walls, more arrow slits there. Francesc has a poke around in the study - shreds of stone tablets here; a few of them are of a similar shape to the stone tablets for which we are hunting. Francesc understands the language, but the linguistic form is quite different from that with which she is familiar. Basically, it's old. It is a kind of personal account that seems to suggest concern - concepts of disagreement with "what the chaplain is doing", not knowing enough or knowing intentions; "how can one know the intentions of something one cannot understand". One word seems to be probably an equivalent of "far realm". There was some experimentation happening... This was a religious place once... Rites, rituals, consecration...

Arturo wonders if the ring is actually a cylinder, we which we can tell if we change floor. First, we finish investigations on this one. Another bedroom; some giant-scale jewellery of unknown value and dubious resale ability but Thorin bags some anyway! - and finally, downstairs, using the central-ish set we found through the

There's an altar here, to the daughter of Annam; stone steps to possibly a temple complex, but collapsed now; and another door. We still have the dragon. We push in. Via passive insight, Francesc and Thorin get a bad feeling... Something's wrong! Thorin voices concern but the door is now opening...

INT saves all round:

* Francesc 10
* Arturo 14
* Penny 23 (nat 19!)
* Thorin 26

Francesc and Arturo immediately suffer a level of exhaustion and *34* points of psychic damage. They lose a sense of where they are and it feels as if the physical world is melting and vaporising away, in a huge open space, but at the same time they're being compressed and compacted on every inch of their bodies.

Thorin and Penny notice immediately the impact on them! To us, they look almost frozen in time for a moment, blinking and phasing, left to right; then suddenly, they leap forward and move again. It's as if there was a glitch in time; and now, while they move, they move very slowly. It's bizarre. The effect is worsening as we watch.

This all seems tied to a well in the room's centre, which seems to be a portal...

(End of part 37)
