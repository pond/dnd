# RIPA: Part 13
## Session 13 (2023-08-15)
### Day 10, early morning

We've just finished a large battle against aggressors from the Mare Of Dead Men. The party levelled up. Our long rest was interrupted by the fight about 4 hours in.

We head back to the Old Dirty Dwarf.

* We do want to destroy the phylactory
* We believe the lich cannot make a second phylactory while the first exists
* The amulets buy us time, though we can't keep them for too many months!
* Vallin & the kidnapped children are a time sensitive thing
* That trail is back in Neverwinter, but the lich knows our faces there

What about going to Candlekeep for more information? What about the devil/demon that was brought in on the boat *to* Neverwinter?

Thorin insight 18. Well, we could always be stronger before we try to tackle a lich - *and* we could always do with more money. There's the gig board at the tavern near the docks at Neverwinter but, again, the lich knows our face there.

Francesc history 13, Penny history 14. If the people here at Helm's Hold are "Order of The Thing" - Order Of The Gauntlet, whatever - then they have big goals. A bit too big to achieve alone. They might pay and hire people to carry things out.

Francesc knows that dragons sit on enormous hoards... We just saw a dragon...

* Black dragons are conceited
* Highly intelligent but very arrogant about that intelligence
* Usually inherently evil - insofar as any chromatic would be
* Tend to be lone wolves

Undecided, but Inspired (literally) by the battle and our success, we crawl into bed!



### Day 11

We wake up fairly late; noisy outside, lots of activity. Repairs probably. We don't get a lie-in because a persistent, loud hammering starts up just outside the building.

After morning faff, we get down to the main tavern room. It's busy. As we go down, straight CHA rolls - Penny 5(ugh)+4, Francesc 10, Thorin 19 - someone gasps! "That was the bear! So - you were up on the walls!" People clap him on the back but are a bit more distanced with Francesc and Penny - "not being handsy with the ladies"! There are various people thanking us. It's genuine and heartfelt. Some of the regular folk had been close by as they'd grabbed improvised weapons and run up to the wall near us.

A long table is laid out with food along the middle of the room - cured meats, baking and more. It's being put on for all the people helping in the rebuild & we're invited to join in.

"Did you see around town?" one asks - Penny asks if there's much damage. Five houses were very badly damaged by the acid and we already know about the damage to the front wall. Two people were killed by the dragon, too. To continue a conversation, persuasion - 21 Penny, (nat 20-1->)19 Francesc; they get more comfortable talking; they see we are dismayed at the death. "Last time we lost 12 people!" they say.

* We learn more as conversation continues from person to person
* Every few weeks, there's a raid but the dragon doesn't usually show up
* There's a plan to tackle things - in the last decade the Hold has been built up enough for people to return, but more excavations are taking place to help people live deeper into the mountains once the ruins there are rebuilt

Still toying with the idea of tackling the dragon, we wonder what Querria might say about it. We head in the direction of the cathedral. It's *very* busy here - it seems to be a makeshift field hospital, or refugee camp perhaps.

Thorin and Francesc notice 3 young teenagers - maybe 12, 14, 15 y/o - who look distressed. The 14y/o sits with head in hands. The 15y/o girl is trying to console him. The 12y/o boy is running up to people and tugging on their robes. He seems to be moving from person to person. Francesc nudges Penny and Penny heads over - "what is troubling you, child?" "Have you seen our parents? There are five of them! We're not all from the same family." Penny says she'll see what she can find out, and asks the child to stay with the other two so we know where to find them when we have some information.

* **Tomas** 12y/o
* **Melia** 14y/o
* **Brand** 15/yo

Penny asks around - persuasion 19+7->27. Two people point to an older-looking human cleric who seems a bit overwhelmed. Penny brings Francesc along and says to the cleric, Thorin in tow, and asks the cleric. We introduce ourselves, and he's **Lucien**. Normally a quartermaster, but now lumped with logistics. The other senior clerics are nowhere to be found! Penny volunteers Francesc and Thorin to help, then asks if there's anyone still missing - unaccounted for - that he knows of. "Sorry to kind of go back to this but - one of the other senior clerics has the list that we were working on to figure out who is missing! Everyone's quite injured."

We remember that the grumpy cleric had an office in the back. Penny goes and knocks on the door of the office, then without waiting for an answer, tries to open it; but it's locked. No answer. There's a window outside, so Penny heads outside to have a look. Francesc meanwhile asks around other people - same question - anyone missing? Pretty soon they start throwing names at Francesc. Almost everyone there has someone they can't find. But they might simply not have looked around in the busy hall yet.

Penny outside can't quite get a good look in the high window - perception 12 - she tries to pull up, athl 13+6->19 - the old cleric and another younger female cleric are sat on the bed there next to each other drinking out of mugs. Penny ducks backs inside, finds Francesc and asks her to pick the lock.

SOH check, 17+5 - it's easy. A latch on the inside. It's flicked open easily and Penny walks in. They look shocked... Penny says, "Thank goodness! We managed to free the lock. It must have been stuck and you couldn't get out to help!" "We're entitled to a break, you know!" insists the old cleric. Penny asks for the list of people he'd compiled as there are kids missing parents. She's handed a bunch of papers.

"Who's good with this?!" asks Penny looking at three unorganised lists, in different handwriting. Francesc investigates - 16+8->24. The list has several of the names that she'd heard. Francesc returns to the kids and asks for their parents names. Three of the five are on the combined lists, so two are in the church; the other three are missing. Penny asks around - where are they? Persuasion 19+7->26 again. **Fleur** and **Barb** - over in a far corner, tending to a huge pile of dirty sheets. We ask about Tomas, Melia and Brand - Tomas and Melia. Penny brings all *three* kids over so that at least they're with *some* parents and quietly asks if they have any idea where the others might be. Fleur's husband is upon the walls clearing acidic 'goo' away. Barb is Tomas' mother; her husband died years ago.

That leaves the 15y/o Brand's parents, who are on the "missing" list. He's finding it difficult to speak actually, as he's sobbing a lot. He lost his parents last night - he hasn't seen them since then. People back at the tavern knew two had died - but Francesc thinks the senior cleric might know. Nope! News to him that anyone died. Where did we hear about this? The tavern? Maybe start there!

Sigh. Penny runs off to the tavern, well, more of a building site there now. We easily find the people we spoke to earlier. We ask if they know who the two were, showing them the list. **And it is, indeed, Brand's parents.**

Penny heads at speed back to the cathedral with the intention of having a quiet word with Fleur. She fills in party and first, we ask the senior cleric what happens to orphans... They have a chance to become men of the cloth; Penny takes Fleur to one side. "I don't know how to say this... But, Brand's parents were killed. And I know you have a lot on your hands. But prospects for orphans in these parts don't seem to be too good. Would you consider adopting Brand? Or at least being a guardian?"

She's not convinced. He's 14. An adult in just two years. Maybe he'd want to work at the smithy... Penny gives her 5gp and says "whether or not he accepts, this is for you. To make your lives easier."

"I don't know how to break it to him. Why don't you give this to him directly. I'll come with you... Just give me five minutes. I need to talk to my husband. At least Melia and him are very close friends." Penny says, "I'll wait."

A few minutes pass and Fleur returns with her husband **Tanis**. His hat is in his hands; a caring look. "Let's go talk to him".

Deep breath Penny Jones. She leads the way; picks up a bit more from Thorin on the way - 5gp seems a bit light, let's call it 10gp - and kneels on one knee in front of Brand, who looks to her. "Yes?" "I have some bad news..." Adv persuasion 18+7->25 "...I'm sorry but your parents didn't make it. The dragon killed them." She just has to say it, bluntly. A brief emotion flickers past his face... Perception 18+2->20. Francesc 24. She sees his hands clench and shoulders square up. Resolve. He's started on a path of vengeance... He's channeling his grief into anger and hatred at the dragon.

Penny - "A life of vengeance can lead to knighthood. But it can also lead to a missed youth and an early grave yourself. They wouldn't want that. But how about I do you a deal - *we* get the dragon for you. And we bring you proof."

"No. No, I'm old enough to start thinking about the world outside. I'm not a fool. I'm not going to run out there and attack the dragon; but one day. One day it will die by my hand. And it will pay for all the lives that it has taken and all the lives that it has destroyed."

"But why wait. As time passes, more die. Why not command people to carry out that on your behalf? Suppose you met, say, three strangers. And told them you wanted it done... Would that work?" She also hands him the 10gp. "And in the mean time, or if we fail - *this* should help with your training and armour, should you take that path."

There's a coughing behind us. Penny says, "This is Fleur and Tanis. I think you know them. They'd like to offer you a place to stay, and a steady trade."

They move forward to kneel down nearby. Melia realises what's going on and sits down too. Quiet conversations. It seems there is an accord, but we have now made a promise.

Penny says, "Let's see Querria". Without ceremony, we just head up the tower. At the back of the cathedral we can already hear voices above - a lot of conversation. People are stood around a planning table. Someone thumps it, trying to make a point. We head up to that level properly. Querria is there, with Javen across the table from her. A few others, who we don't know.

Querria looks over. "Um. Errr. Are you - what - what are you doing here?"

Penny says, "We'd like to discuss killing a dragon."

"Oh! I see..." - and there's a chuckle from someone else at the table. Perception all round, highest surprisingly Penny 19.

* She recognises the squire from the knight who helped us out early upon our arrival, along with the knight/paladin in question
* Another paladin - female, bronzed skin, black curly hair cropped short, also with a squire
* An unusual-looking human - ? - who has golden skin and eyes that seem to slightly *glow* (an Aasimar, we later learn)
* An older-looking knight, a bit younger than Javen and in better fighting shape; this is the one who chucked.

The knight speaks. "Huh. You're going to go and kill the dragon?!" "No", says Francesc. "We're saying we'd like to *discuss* killing a dragon...!" Persuasion rolls are low. They don't really agree to share info and don't seem to take us too seriously. 

Querria says that their plan, and the discussion at hand, is to speed up the efforts to move the entire city *into* the mountain. It'll protect people from the dragon. That's her primary mandate - protect the people.

Javen points out that it's their holy mission to eliminate evil, though. He wants to have people ride out in a blaze of glory towards the Mare Of Dead Men.

Penny agrees that the mountain is a good place to defend against aggressors - not just the dragon - but also riding out to get the dragon seems a good plan; safety in numbers; but having *some* idea where it might reside would help. The Mare is big.

They don't know the Mare well, though. Their horses can't really cope; they'd be on foot. Querria thinks it is folly - ridiculous - marching into the Mare leaves the entire city defenceless! She'd veto such a decision.

"What about a party?" asks Thorin. Penny adds, "A smaller group. Quieter, able to get closer unnoticed."

The glowing one looks over and says, "And how will you succeed in this task? Do you have experience killing dragons?" Francesc is honest; "Well, no, but you've got to start somewhere!" Thorin adds "And we didn't have experience defending your city before last night either, but we did OK - and sank an arrow into that dragon."

"What happens if you fail to kill the dragon and enrage it? And it decides to mete vengeance on the city?"

"It might be angry already as we killed its priest friend" argues Francesc. And Javen agrees that the necromancer is dead; we did at least achieve that, which they hadn't managed to do prior.

The female knight then decides to introduce people.

* **Zara Delcore** with her squire **Thora**.
* We introduce ourselves.
* Holy Watcher Querria and founder Javen we know.
* **Carant** has the golden skin.
* The older knight we met early on is **Tyrros**.

Zara says, "I know of someone - a druid - slightly crazy druid who likes to camp out in the ruins of **Leilon**, the village nearby." (We saw this on the way in, ruined by the edge of the Mare). "He knows the Mare well; he might know more about the dragon, **Klaugmyathar**". 

(Penny's stories from the war mentioned a famous black dragon in the Mare; she can't quite place its name, but she's pretty sure it's not that - so this must be a different one?)

Zara offers to ride out with us to find the druid, if the Order will give blessings. "Querria, your Holiness? Look into your heart. Do not bar this action. It does not affect your plan." Tyrros laughs - "You going to go ahead with this plan? You haven't asked them their price yet."

Penny says, "Francesc is doing it for nature. I'm on the fence. Sure, Thorin might like the gold - wouldn't we all! But we're not asking you to pay us anything. If there's a hoard, and we're granted part of it, then we'll take what we're allowed."

"Shall we march out then?"

So it's decided. Javen laughs. "At last! Action!" He gives a look to Carant; a knowing nod back; Carant excuses himself from the room.

Penny is trailing the group and, just before leaving, says to Querria: "You must protect your people. I know that. But I just had to tell a 14 year old kid that his parents were dead. That dragon and I are going to have a conversation." "Do you speak dragon?" "You really are..." starts Penny, shaking her head, then leaves.

### Just before midday

We end up walking alongside Zara on her handsome warhorse, the squire walking alongside. We leave the front gates of a town once again rebuilding, trying to return to normality - before it all happens again. Smoke plumes rise from chimneys of smithys and kilns, hard at work.

Zara's squire has a heavy backpack and wears medium scale mail armour. Zara is in full plate, but hasn't got her armour on. She asks as we travel about where we are from, what we believe in and so-on.

It's nice to be back out in nature, but Thorin and Francesc notice issues. Nature magic is being used to try and revive the land, but the Mere is encroaching; an unnatural decay; a rot. Some of the land we cross was marched upon by the undead army, and we see the impact they've had. The druid is perhaps the one casting magic to try and do good here, but it seems like a losing battle. There are lots of spores here - it seems to be taking the rot and trying to decay things around it naturally, to allow for purification of and renewal. A cycle of rot to renewal. Thorin and Francesc haven't seen that kind of magic before; it seems somewhat darker - heavily necrotic - but not in and of itself evil.

Here and there are partial skeletons on the side of the road; undead by the looks of it that have been disembodied or just never made it back to the Mare.

"This is a cheery place" says Francesc. "This is the nice bit!" replies Penny.

### 1pm

We approach Leilon. It's not a small place; two ruined watchtowers, covered in vines and moss and creeping mould covering most things; lots of magical spores in the air. Something that looks like it was once a church. The town might be about five blocks square. It's larger than Helm's Hold but not fortified at all and next to what looks like it was once a natural stream, but has now overflowed and turned boggy.

Animals slither around in the boggy water. Parts of the town are partially submerged; glimpses of lizards and snakes. Thorin nature 15: He sees a crocodile and between that and the warhorse, realises he could change into those!

Zara's squire insists that she dismounts. The horse can't proceed. The squire says she'll stay with the horse; not leave it tied up as it'd just be eaten!

We continue on foot. Zara says, "I know that he's in here! He does spend in this town area even though he's - kind of - feral... But I don't know where exactly. We'll have to look for him."

Penny investigation 17; Francesc 21. She finds tracks. They're a bit unusual, reptilian feet - Zara confirms those are probably his. "He kind of looks like a lizard!"

Francesc sees that the tracks seem to go around a shed mostly. Of all the buildings that might be called "home" here, this strange small stone shed seems to be "it". But it's pretty small! The door is closed; Penny opens the door. Dex save! 17-1->16 luckily; that's enough. As the door opens, a strange flying cloud of long strands of sticky web seem to spring loose, but she dodges them.

Inside the shed is an immense nest full of these sticky strands with large spider eggs inside. "Nope!" says Penny and shuts the door.

Zara gets nervous. Large spider eggs? Giant even? She draws her sword. The tracks head off in four different directions. Thorin survival 23; one set of tracks is newer. It's heading towards the outskirts; we follow. It leads us towards the Mere, into wetter territory. Penny draws her sword too. Francesc prepares her bow.

Francesc (perception 15) sees movement in the swampy area ahead; low down; it's dimmer here due to trees, harder to see. A pair of eyes pop up, then stay still, observing; like a crocodile, but large one if so. Thorin (17) sees it too. One large - almost giant - crocodile.

Penny asks, "What's the name of this druid?" "**Krstjan**". Penny tries calling the name - "is that you?" - persuasion 17. The crocodile starts to move out of the water towards you. It's now on the path. And then it slowly turns into a biped (and at this, Penny sheathes her sword).

The face shortens; it's a Lizardfolk person, or so Zara says! None of us have seen one before. Wears long, swamp-net sort of clothes. "You have me at a disadvantage! What are your names and what are you doing here?"

The usual introductions and explanations follow; the TL;DR is trying to kill the dragon! We find out that the shed of eggs is a rescue; some travellers killed the mother, he's quite proud, they're almost ready to hatch. "They help as a first line of defence against the undead!" he adds. They also act like his eyes and ears in the swamp - not as powerful as Klaugmyathar's, of course. "I do serve my purpose as Helm's Hold's alarm warning system..." "About that!" retorts Zara. "Well there was nothing I could do that time - they marched right through here and by the time I was able to light the fires, the dragon was already upon the town."

Krstjan knows the location of sentries that the dragon commands for scouting and suspects that the dragon is in a location about a day's travel towards the coast, in an underground cave system - old limestone karsts - with a few ways in and out. But we'd be spotted! All of the denizens of that area work for him out of fear. We won't be able to surprise him, unless we can hide ourselves or disguise ourselves somehow.

He is able to give us some information on the Mere and tell us how to get there, but can't take us there - he'd be abandoning his post.

It takes some doing - Francesc with Penny's help persuasion 1, then 0! - Thorin helps Penny; 24. Phew. Everyone's full of excuses about why they can't go! But the druid offers to send an emissary with us. He turns towards the swamp and starts making weird sounds. A bright orange and blue coloured small frog jumps out! Krstjan says, "This here is Chewy. Chewy will lead you to where I last saw Klaugmyathar emerge. And I will lend you this!" and he takes his bow and offers it. Francesc takes it. "I *lend* that to you. If you can kill the dragon, it's yours because I won't need it anymore! But I'll need to swap as I need a weapon. It's a +1 bow; Francesc doesn't seem too emotionally tied to her old weapon and seems very eager to hand it over... But she switches over the recently-purchased bow charms first.

There's one more thing. "If you do not use this *please* bring it back - it was very hard to make..." - it's a potion of acid resistance. He's only made one. The group agrees that Penny is a good candidate.

"There are a few things you need to know..."

* It's a network of unground caves.
* Klaugmyathar is on the cusp of adulthood and has been very aggressive in taking over the lair.
* We're not planning on just marching in there...?! We need a good plan! Klaugmyathar has got eyes and ears everywhere; we'd never get to him.
* His minions - well, there *was* an undead army, but he saw it marching back in tatters and there was an apparently-confused earth elemental in their wake! - that used to guard the lair.
* We say that we took down the necromancer; that helps us - there's a lot less protection for that part of the Mare then.
* There's an old roadhouse, ruined, which we might be able to use to sneak down into the tunnel network.
* Thorin hands over the Cloak Of Elvenkind to help out Penny for the time being.
* Klaugmyathar has been there since the end of the war. He took over a much older black dragon's lair. Maybe that's the one Penny had heard of? But the new occupant has been there long enough to imbue it with his own magic; it's as dangerous as any other lair.
* Sections of it have noxious gas. He's not sure if that's acidic or poisonous.
* Krstjan is aware of a fair bit of disease in the area due to all the dead bodies. "Don't touch anything...".
* One last thing - "Klaugmyathar in his lair loves to play Hide And Ambush!"

Tactics... If we could recon the area and see if coming in and out of the lair it'd help. So for that matter would Arturo! Three against one is not as good as four against one. Perhaps we could flank the dragon by drawing it out to the exit tunnel, two others coming up behind via the lair, so it can't fly but can't also get lair advantage?

We figure that we could head back to town for now to formulate a strategy. The frog will help us get to the lair in only 4 hours, as it knows direct routes that are easier for walking on; Thorin could work on a healing potion; Francesc on arrows; and so-on.

OK, so we might have to try and camp out there to get some recon in, but we'll head out at the start of the day either way to maximise daylight hours. We don't want to be out in the Mere after dark unless we're forced to do so.

### 3pm

We're back in town.

* Thorin works on the healing potion
* Francesc works on arrows and makes a huge number - 66!
* Penny heads to the cathedral and helps out with healing; the hands-on-healing pool and several spell slots are dumped into helping out. Adv D20+prof+CHA->21, this confers a sense of righteousness and renewed faith; Inspiration - but it can also be used in the form of a rousing speech before battle, giving CHA (+4) temp HP to all allies.

(End of part 13)
