# RIPA: Part 46
## Session 46 (2024-08-13)
### Day 45, morning, Waterdeep under attack

We had reached Waterdeep. Our party was to attempt to gain an audience with Lady Laeral Silverhand, Open Lord of Waterdeep and, through her, find a way to reach the extra-planar city of Sigil in search of the second rod segment. A prior experience at Candlekeep led us to believe that a rival party was probably searching for rod segments too, so overnight, Penny switched her sunsword attunement for the scrying orb, thinking she shouldn't need the sword again until we get to the next plane. The scrying confirmed our suspicions that the rival party, who we think are working for Vecna, *are* also looking for the rod; know we have part of it; and are probably looking for us.

We struck a bargain with a Masked Lord of Waterdeep, "Mirt The Moneylender", to be introduced to Lady Silverhand. For our part of that bargain, we found ourselves below the Eastern quarter in an underground refugee camp of thousands of goblins displaced by the dragon war. Just as we were finding common ground and trust, disaster struck - something akin to an earthquake. With tunnels collapsing and surely countless lives lost, Thorin's quick thinking - to conjure giant badgers to help free people and dig direct routes up to the surface - must have saved many lives, including our own.

Now above ground, we see the unthinkable.

The enormous, ancient defence statues of Waterdeep have been mobilised. Vajra Safahr controls them from atop Blackstaff Tower, surrounded by mages throwing spells in all directions. Above the city flies the Griffon Cavalry, more than forty-strong; archers line the city walls below; and countless ad hoc groups of adventurers can be seen fighting both on the ground and in the air. As buildings crumble and fall, here and there groups of priests, clerics and paladins pour out from temples, using whatever magic they can to defend and heal; but largely, panic reigns, voiced through the screams of *thousands* of citizens.

A city-wide arcane shield has been deployed, but it seems to have little effect. Twisted, winged demons pour over the city walls from the North-West. Tentacles, one some 20ft in diameter, from an as-yet unseen giant sea creature appear over Mount Waterdeep. Near-invisible spectres cloud the air. The Eastern quarter and Dwarven town beyond collapse into ruin as strange gorilla-like demon creatures crash through from below. Apparently overseeing it all, riding a wave of thick purple fog, is *Vecna himself*, heading directly towards Vajra and her mages, and obliterating one of the giant statues with just a point of his finger and a ray of destruction.

Thorin is in Quetzalcoatlus form, and riding upon his back the rest of us look on in horror. The wisdom of Arturo saves us from Penny's gut reaction to try and intervene to block Vecna. Instead, we focus on something more attainable and dive down to tackle the creatures in the East. We will try to save as many of the refugee goblins, the dwarves and the other citizens in that heavily damaged sector as we can. As if all this weren't bad enough, Penny receives a Sending message from Mayastan - Candlekeep is also under attack.

We are airborne, diving downwards, and within 500ft of the closest demon. We dive down and end up within 60-70 feet of some aggressors. Initiative:

* Thorin 24
* Arturo 12
* Francesc 11
* Penny 6

We see three (not that we necessarily know their names) Babau demons flying, wingless, skinny and tall, blood-slicked, golem-like, hooks on their heads and barbed tails. There's a Barlgura, one of the huge demon gorilla-like creatures but hairless, except for a red mane - 20ft tall - the one that has reachced over the city wall; and we now see, having crashed up from the ground and jumping onto the wall, some 30ft tall, a truly huge goristro - all mouth, frog-like but a very toothy frog! Teeth are inches long; it's improbably top-heavy looking, massive rams horns; even at our distance we can smell sulphur smells as it spews cinders. Its legs are goat legs. It mostly keeps its hands on the ground for balance, but can rear up and swipe at quite a distance.

As Thorin heads towards the most mobile and, by his assessment, dangerous creature - the gorilla-like one - Francesc and Arturo jump, as he flies low, to keep at range. Francesc almost stumbles but manages to save it on the landing. Thorin continues to get down and close, Penny still on board. Thorin tries to get his beak attack in on fly-by, but he's unfamiliar with this form for attacking (6+4) so it's a miss. He continues flying low... Penny, ATHL 16, (DM -> is allowed to, out of turn, like Francesc and Arturo) jumps off - 20ft drop, it's a loud thump, 6->3 damage; she is next to the creature as Thorin-Quetz continues around.

Flashes of blueish-purple light, almost like fireworks, start exploding above us. More screams, from behind us... Arturo, having dropped on a building, sees the griffons being licensed with lightning; their riders are crying out in terror. Grim.

We hear Goblinoid shouts as they start to try and coordinate an escape, we think, away from the battle we're creating.

Thorin has now turned a corner and sees, as does an Arturo, a rapidly expanding ball of energy coming out of the top of Blackstaff Tower. Some kind of forcefield; a shockwave of air and a dull boom travels across the city and reaches him very soon after. She holds her staff overhead in both hands. Around the tower, a shimmering shield is now forming from below.

The Barlgura ignores Penny, seeming more interested in the creature that just attacked it - it jumps over Penny, staying in melee range, then tries some very strange entanglement. Sinewy muscles and blood vessels reach out - very unpleasant, Tetsuo morphing in Akira! - STR save for Thorin; out of aura range; nat 1! He was facing the other way and just didn't see it coming. It wraps around his feet, body and even grabs some of his wings, so he can't effectively fly. It pulls him back and tries to recklessly bite. Its advantage gives it 24 to hit; hits; 11 piercing - and he's restrained. It's not done yet! It tries to fling him onto the ground. 3d8->7 damage.

Arturo turns back from the strange effects on the tower and looks back. He sees two of us on the Barlgura, so tries to L4 Psychic Lance the Goristro, with Subtle Spell. INT 19 save arising is failed. 28 psychic damage and it's stunned for a moment. It stops, grabs its head and stoops a little. Arturo tries to deflect attack by acting as if he's a scared bystander - Deception 24 - it's very effective. Even his own party is fooled!

Francesc makes a different choice and goes for the Barlgura that's grappling Thorin, with Sharpshooter. ADV because of its prior reckless attack. Hunter's Mark, slugs... 21 to hit with the penalty. Hits; 26 damage; it has to CON save; it holds the entanglement spell on Thorin (its strange behaviour is in fact not a physical ability, but a manifestation of a spell). She fires again - with penalty again, 20. Hits again. A very solid 25 damage. CON save again; it holds.

Bursting out from the horizon formed by nearby buildings appears a glowing, white pegasus, with a fully armoured knight astride it, cape billowing, firey sword. He's headed towards the tower. It's glorious... Penny doesn't see it; she's too close to the Barlgura. A beam of sunlight fires out towards Vecna and pierces the shield, striking him; Vecna spins around and fixes his gaze on the new arrival.

Commoners are scattering in all directions, but fortunately, most have the sense to run away from the oncoming demons. Nobody knows if it's safer deeper into the city, but it certainly isn't safe on the wall! The goblins are more coordinated and continue to head West.

Penny knows her regular sword is a disadvantage. She's seen people ask for divine intervention before and tries to do that, but (REL 15-1 -> 14) she just isn't able to get in touch with Meliki. Well, no other choice; the regular longsword is drawn; as a bonus, she calls up Branding Smite, holding it ready.

A Babau flies up to a Dwarven worker and *shreds* them apart. It's grotesque. Another keeps chasing others, but can't quite make it - gets very close. The Babau seem to be largely ignoring us and going for easy targets... and Arturo's deception turns out to be a bit too convincing - it heads towards him.

One of the Dwarven workers next to the second Babau turns to attack - stands his ground - hits! - deals 8 damage. But it's not a magical weapon and those paying attention notice that the wound inflicted is minor. Other Dwarven workers flee, except one who joins his companion in attack - but misses.

The Goristro starts to shake off its incapacitated state... It can't do much, but is able to walk. It staggers around smashing into buildings, one on each side of the road, but seems very disorientated. The buildings seem to take extraordinary damage from its impacts, for whatever magical or demonic reasons; they look on the very verge of collapse.

Thorin decides he can do more damage as a dwarf, and evade the grapple in the act of shifting from such a large creature into a much smaller one. Then he casts polymorph on *himself*, changing into a giant ape!

Arturo sees the approaching Babau and saw the pegasus flying out; then sees that suddenly the glowing light is snuffed out - a dark-green ray, streaking out from Vecna's hand, has struck the pegasus and its rider. They just drop out of the sky instantly!

Goblin elders start beckoning people along side-streets.

Vajra seems to change what she was going to do a flings her staff sideways, shouting out some words (Arturo sees the mouth movements but it's too far to hear) and a spinning disc of light appears below the falling paladin, lowering them to the ground.

The Barlgura is confused at the change of dwarf to ape; its entanglement is broken; it just starts pummelling - again, recklessly. Both of those attacks hit; and it gets a critical hit on a bite attack. 7, 7 damage from the first two; 18 on the bite. 32 total. He manages to hold his spell despite needing three CON saves from the three attacks!

Arturo flees a short distance from the approaching Babau, jumping to an adjacent building - ACRO 12, just makes it, albeit inelegant and takes twice the movement to pull it off. He summons a L5 Draconic Spirit into the place he was previously stood. He chooses a Chromatic dragon with Lightning breath and resistance for the summoned form. Its breath weapon fans out downwards and outwards in an angle that gets the oncoming Babau *and* the one attacking the two Dwarven folk below. DC 19 DEX or the two; the nearby one does not make the save; the further one does. Damage roll is low - 4 - but only half taken due to resistances anwyay! - 2 and 1 damage taken. It moves in to attack the closer Babau in melee, hitting twice (25, 27); 24 damage total, piercing, but non-magical; 12 taken.

Francesc chooses to defend the Dwarven workers. She fires and would almost miss, but in a moment of inspiration adjusts her aim - crit! - 31 damage to the Babau near the workers. The arrow sinks deep into the strange, oily flesh. It snarls, reaches over and breaks off the arrow... And somehow, seems barely injured. It's going to take a *lot* to take this thing down. **We underestimated these creatures.** Francesc changes aim, going for the Barlgura - ADV since it was reckless - 26, hits; 26 damage. It goes down. Penny, rather disappointed at being unable to contact Meliki, suddenly sees this creature she was all ready to attack disintegrates - a kind of coal in its core shatters and it shreds down into a strange pool of flesh that just melts away, perhaps leaving the plane. Hunters Mark goes to the Goristro.

We hear more yelling and chanting, overlapping languages familiar and unknown, bard song, rallying cries, magic incantations; sounds of people fighting, echos of our own battle, rising sometimes in volume above the background noise, almost tuned out now, of terrified screams. But nobody else is going after Vecna! It seems that the "ray of death" has been seen by all, and is feared by all.

Penny runs up to the Goristro. Very thick hide! But 23 to hit - she gets it. Branding Smite, Divine Smite (L1), total damage - mediocre 25 (3d6, 4d8, +4). She swings again; hits; 33 damage this time, with a bonus-action cast Divine Smite on top and this time a L2 Divine Smite. It looks... Mildly scratched.

The Babau closest to Penny / Eastwards looks around and sees the two Dwarven workers standing their ground. It uses a Weakening Gaze on one; CON save; they succeed! Instead, then, it runs up to attack; the worker is very badly hurt. Up on the roof, the Babau facing down the Draconic Spirit starts casting a spell. Arturo (Arcana 13) recognises the spell only as it finishes; it's Dispel Magic on the spirit... But it fails to make a powerful enough impact against Arturo's L5 magic. Finally, the other one next to the Dwarven workers looks up at Francesc who'd fired at it, locks eyes; WIS save 15; she resists a fear effect, recognising its attempts to tap into her childhood fears. So it changes tactic and attacks - sigh, crit! - against the dwarf closest and kills them.

The injured dwarf turns to their friend and vows to avenge them, attacking in turn but in the heat of emotion swings wide, missing. At the end of their turn, acid continuing to do damage, he collapses.

The Goristro sees the nearby Penny, who caused injury; it tries to swipe her aside with a +13 mod, but 4+13->17 vs AC 20 - she holds her ground. Then it tries an uppercut; 17 again! She dodges again! So it changes tactic, charging at the giant ape, sharp horns down. It hits... Damage is 42 base with 7d10 on top for the charge - **89 damage** piercing damage. That might be some kind of record for our party. Amazingly, Thorin is still in ape form briefly; STR save, DC21, he can't make it and is thrown back 20 feet, prone. The CON save for holding Polymorph would be completely unattainable, so as he lands, he turns back into his Dwarven form.

Thorin considers the risky move of calling an elemental. Religious insight yields no help (REL 9). He tries for an Earth Elemental and retreats to a safer distance!

Up on the roof, Arturo can see Vecna. Vajra is distracted by the falling palladin. He's cleared a path through the air and now flies quickly, shimmering shield around him, directly at her. He uses Thaumatergy to broadcast his voice; he appears to magnify his size too; the voice seems to come from all directions.

*"Waterdeep! Waterdavians. You have suffered for too long! You have been disempowered. Imprisoned! Robbed of the truth." - a strange kind of corruption and decay is emanating out; buildings are crumbling and getting old, too quickly. "You have been forced to surrender your strength, your arms, your livelihoods to those who would hold *secrets*. Your rulers are not your leaders. They are not kings, they are not emperors, they are not you, nor chosen by you. They lie to you. They hide in the shadows!" - and theatrically he lifts out various bodies of dead nobles from the street into the air. "They hide behind masks; behind sham laws and deceitful secrets. They claim to protect you with their taxes, guilds and prohibitions" - the bodies are thrown back down - "...their councils and committees. They claim that a Mithilar shields the city from attack, yet here I am. They claim the statues defend you, yet you see them destroyed. They claim to prohibit dragons and yet... Here we are!" - and with that, he brings his hands together and a strange gold arcane thread starts to wrap around; the ground shakes and opens; a giant crack; and trapped, in some kind of shackles, we see a long, serpentine gold dragon, in magical chains, is pulled out from under the city. "Your masked lords siphon the wealth, and all this time, you sleep above an ancient lair of madness! This exploitation ends now. I will throw off your shackles - I, the god of secrets, am here to free you" (etc., speech to fast to type!). "Or oppose me - and wither with your snivelling, wicked rulers" - he closes the magical chains **and the dragon is ripped apart**.*

The goblins now run the other way. They've not bought into it. But Arturo sees some who seem confused, or thinking perhaps they have no choice, standing and regarding Vecna, whispering, closing their eyes; strange connections start to appear, visibly, between him and other people in the city. Arturo feels the tug of the connection too - he recognises it - **we too have that connection from our earlier encounter**. We have secrets; either our own, or the one shared from Gertrude. But maybe he doesn't know we have a bit of what feels like a two-way connection? Arturo Insight, Arcana or Religion.

* Arturo ADV arcana 21 (as he's looking directly)
* Francesc insight 15
* Thorin insight 12
* Penny insight 10

Arturo alone - who is the only one of us who can see Vecna - realises that we can somehow 'spend' secrets; but people are offering them to Vecna in their mind - he can absorb their power, to increase his own power. For our part, if any one of us "spent" Gertrude's secret, we'd *all* forget that but also *all* get ADV on any d20 roll for a minute.

Vajra is desperate - she tries to get all of the remaining statues to move towards Vecna.

Arturo splits L4 Psychic Lance, twinning it between the Goristro and one of the Southernmost Babau (DISADV applied to the Goristro). Saving throws - Goristro fail, Babau fail too. Both are incapacitated. 25 psychic damage to both. Then his dragon acts, getting in its breath weapon and a few hits. Then Francesc picks up the attack, hitting one of the Babau for 28 damage. The next arrow, though, misses.

Arturo sees a full *barrage* of projections of all kinds flying up from the ground at Vecna. While some Waterdavians might have been convinced, it seems a good many were not. Most just bounce off his protective globe, but some hit; however, he's being strengthened by secrets being given to him. A strange secondary globe of power is slowly spreading out from around him. And that fact that any people are turning *at all* is very confronting.

Penny (flanking adv with elemental) gets another hit with all the toys but only 19 damage; then another attack - CRIT - divine smite, almost out of spells, 35 damage - it's not elegant or grand, she's just slicing as best she can at around the middle. She hits the upper thigh first and it stumbles down, fairly injured now.

We realise the elemental's initiative order wasn't rolled - 13 - would've gone before Arturo, so we roll it now. Flanking with Penny, it gets two solid slam attack hits. 23 total damage; it takes 11, having some resistances to bludgeoning.

The Babau by the draconic spirit decides to go for Arturo. There's a hit of 10 -> 5 taken from the spirit. This throws it off balance and its first attack misses. A shield reaction from Arturo causes the next hit to miss, too. Another Babau runs at Francesc - hit - 11 damage; CON save, Hunter's Mark held; she reacts with Gift Of The Gem Dragon - but it resists the worst; it takes just 2d8->4->2 damage. The Babau's next attempted hit misses. The third Babau is incapacitated from the lance and staggers in a random direction, walking into a wall!

The Goristro has been injured most seriously by Penny - but thanks to Arturo, can't do much! It's incapacitated - it walks Southwards, smashing into a building. Now there are two side by side that are very heavily weakened.

Thorin tries L5 Erupting Earth in an area that'll hit the Babau threatening Francesc. It fails its save; 5d12->25->12 damage taken.

Arturo is again the only witness to Vecna's ongoing actions. Arcana 19. Vecna has started to cast something, within his protection, that is taking a while. He's within 500ft now, having drifted; Arturo shouts down a recommendation to Francesc to try and break Vecna's concentration. Vajra has noticed too - Arturo sees her yelling something - it must be important, as people get even *more* focused on Vecna! She creates a kind of barrage of knives, throwing it directly at Vecna... It flies in, but most of the knives bounce off the shield. A few seem to get stuck in. None make it through.

The earth elemental attacks the Goristro, moving a little first to keep its flanking position with Penny. Neither attack, sadly, exceed the AC, despite advantage.

Arturo tries another twinned Psychic Lance on the Goristro and the Babau near Francesc so she's free to move and get a line of sight on Vecna. Twin spell Disadvantage on the Goristro. Sadly the Babau matches the DC and succeeds. The Goristro doesn't (and with that, Arturo suddenly realises *it never could* - he'd picked the wrong creature for disadvantage). 24 psychic damage; half taken by the Babau. The Goristro is looking pretty rough, at least. His draconic spirit is, too, sent to try and assist Francesc. Potential breath weapon damage is 10; he gets two in the cone, one succeeding one failing on their saves; then there are the two attacks on the one next to Francesc both hit; 11->5, 11->5 damage respectively (DM calls it a total of 11 to allow, this one time, for rounding).

Francesc rises up on her slugs, but suffers a hit from Babau in opportunity attack - 11 damage total; CON save for Hunter's Mark, easily held. Gift Of The Gem Dragon again - STR DC 15, it fails, taking full damage and being pushed back across the difficult terrain created by Thorin's spell. Only 3 damage, sadly! And now, at last, Francesc is the first of our party to get an arrow thrown at Vecna. Range 600ft, he's 580ft away; no Sharpshooter; she goes for a *normal* arrow, having seen many magical things bounce off the shield.

*31* to hit! It flies true, pierces the bubble, and - slows to a stop.

OK, well, next one - magic arrow! 24+1 to hit. It also flies true, pierces the bubble, does *not* slow and *hits Vecna*. Slugs sent too, damage 11+6 on slugs. The slugs burn away on the field around Vecna, but he takes 11 damage. CON save - 21! He holds the spell.

**She's still the first person in our party to injure Vecna.**

He stops for a moment in his chanting and stops to briefly look at the arrow lodged in his side; he flicks it away, then continues the chant.

Penny continues attack. ADV for flanking. Divine smite on a first hit, L1, 27 damage! But despite advantage - the next attack misses. She at least manages to recover a L2 slot via Channel Divinity.

The Babau on Arturo attacks. 11, misses; 12, misses! The one that had been on Francesc moves backwards from the difficult terrain and, after the Gem Dragon push-back, exits quickly; this means it has enough time to get a run up towards Thorin. Before it attacks him, though, it tries to Dispel the earth elemental. The Conjure spell was L5; and it crits - rats! Thorin's spell is dismissed and the Elemental vanishes. For good measure, it claws at Thorin; 19; just below AC. It misses - but the Eastern-most Babau, mostly out of the action until now, runs up and swipes twice. Fortunately, both of those attacks miss too.

The Goristro is - again - incapacitated. Penny is being helped a lot by Arturo today. It staggers away from Penny and she gets in an opportunity attack; it hits; final L1 slot for Divine Smite, 22 damage. In frustration, Penny realises it's moved further away than she can easily reach.

Thorin casts a Wall Of Thorns *through* the two Babaus next to him. One fails its save, one passes; 32 damage (or 16) - piercing - so 16 and 8 taken. That's enough for one! It turns into a pool of blood, which evaporates, leaving a strange dark stain on the street. The remaining Babau is on the wrong side of the wall, so Thorin has at least *some* protection.

Vecna is still casting... The strange sphere that Arturo (and now Francesc) see is growing. Arturo arcana 17 - eight small holes appear - they are some kind of gateway; Francesc perception 15 - strange things in the sky - 8 small holes, that seem to have things spinning around; they start to grow. Vecna appears to be channelling the energy he's connected into those gates.

Vajra is getting very clearly desperate and frightened. She too sees - obviously, much closer than us! - what Vecna is doing. She thrusts the staff down into the tower roof and runes light up on the structure, shifting; the tower itself starts to open, like a portal - and she starts to beckon people in. This looks like a lifeboat.

**She's changed from city defence to saving whoever she can. She thinks the city is lost.**

Arturo has one last twinned Lance to use. He pulls back a L2 in passing. This time he knows to give the Babau to disadvantage. The Goristro fails again, as he knows it now must. 26 damage to both. The dragon manages to get 3 effective damage onto a Babau from the breath and just one other hit, 11->5 extra damage. Both Babaus look kinda equally rough. They're quite low.

Francesc goes for Vecna. One magic arrow left. She drops Hunter's Mark and switches to Favoured Foe for Vecna *if* she hits. Luck point needed! 27 to hit; the magical arrow once again pierces the shield; a solid 25 damage, no slugs (she knows now that they don't work). CON save for Vecna, only needs to beat 12; 3+12->15 - he couldn't have failed. At least we have his attention. Well... There are other targets - she aims at the Babau that isn't incapacitated by Psychic Lance. Hits; 13 damage - it goes down!

Penny is too far to reach the Goristro with a sword so runs up close-ish, then throws two javelins. Both hit, and they might even have taken the creature down, but they're not magical damage - 6->3, 5->2 damage only. It's still up. Thorin tries to finish the job with Erupting Earth; it makes its save, so takes 19->10->5 damage. And that's enough. It turns into a pile of embers that scatter across the ground.

As the Goristro falls, the ground starts to shake. Weakened buildings it had hit collapse. We all get more of a view of the sky. We all see these portals, now clearly expressed as such, getting wider and wider. More and more tendrils are spreading up from Waterdavians who've given up. The globe around Vecna expands at an ever-increasing rate. Arturo can just about see that more and more people are running to the tower, but the tower is shaking and crumbling - the globe around Vecna has hit the ground, which is where the shaking comes from.

All of us roll extremely low on perception or history checks. We don't know what we're seeing through these portals; other worlds, but we don't know what. They generally don't look evil! They look perhaps even almost wondrous; bright sunshine visible in most.

**Penny luck roll D20->3. Higher the better. She gets a Sending message from Mayastan; "Do not come. All is lost! Vecna is here. Has seized control of Candlekeep."** She just about manages to call out a warning, but is in despair.

Saving throws. WIS or Insight check, CHA, or INT saving.

* Francesc insight 25
* Penny CHA 24
* Thorin 23
* Arturo CHA 14

Arturo's not sure what's happening. We all feel like multiple people are calling out; messaging; something terrible. The bubble around Vecna continues to expand. Then there's a feeling as if silence is approaching from it... And then there's a presence? Weird - childlike - yet familiar - **a young emerald dragon**. It connects with the four of us... Warning, yet reassuring.

* Francesc in particular feels a strange connection to her bow (because of who gave it to her). Velindra Shadowmantle is contacting her. "**This world is lost. We have to survive to live another day.**" There's a pull of magic, trying to shield her, *tugging* at her. Francesc needs to find something she owns to sacrifice, to absorb the magic. Francesc reaches for a magical dagger she owns.

* Penny feels a strange druidic presence from the sunsword. It's odd. And there's a strange feeling, pulsation, from her divine amulet. Meliki calls. **Penny interprets this as death.** It is a warm embrace. Then she realises she must sacrifice something to absorb its magic. She's holding her *magical longsword*. It would be no use in the afterlife. She lets it go (later, she realises the Headband Of Intellect would have been a better choice; but in the moment, she is sure it is the end).

* Thorin's staff goes silent. He feels a weightlessness. A lack of gravity; he remembers this from floating through the strange chamber at Vallin's tomb. She said, "This was one future I could not avoid. But I have prepared you. There is a path. There is a way to retake that which was lost; to retake everything that we will yet lose. Trust me. I need you to trust me!" - he feels her "stepping" down from her usual cross-legged position, floating, to reach out and take his hand. He reaches back. He realises he must sacrifice a magic item to absorb its magic. He is wrapped in his *Cloak Of Protection*. That.

* Arturo gets a similar feeling. He's being saved... but he doesn't know how or by whom. He feels adrift and grabs for his *immoveable rod* - he feels like he's falling.

Three of us don't see - with our eyes - what's going on; we're wrapped in our strange fantasies. Arturo alone bears witness to the final moments of the real world. He sees the magical bubble expand quickly from Vecna. Every person it passes, whether or not they gave themselves to Vecna, seem to fall lifeless to the ground; he sees, bizarrely, a beautiful, quiet day within. Arturo realises that Vecna, once he had all the secrets he needed, *didn't need the people*.

**The bubble is speeding up... It moves fast to see now. It will cover the world.**

Arturo feels as if his own life is being lost in that moment.

From our gifts - such as the gem dragon gift, now being spent and stripped away now - and from the connections we have, from whatever is that helps us - time slows. We are weakened but do not die; we are falling, saved, falling a long way from our world, now lost.

We fall separately. We land far apart. Our memories are gone; months will be spent adrift, wandering.

**One day, we will find each other. One day, we will pick up the fight again.**



## LEVEL 11

- We lose Feat Gift Of The Gem Dragon
- We gain a Scion Of The Outer Planes in its place, of our choice:
  * Penny: **Good Outer Plane, plus Righteous Heritor**
  * Arturo: **Chaotic Outer Plane, plus Cohort Of Chaos**
  * Thorin: **The Outlands, plus Outlands Envoy**
  * Francesc: **Lawful Outer Plane, plus Agent Of Order**
- When we finish falling, conscious or otherwise, we will be in the plane indicated by the chosen Scion
- There will be a break in play due to work and travel requirements
- During this time we individually consider and script the way in which our characters regain their memories and meet, taking place over a period of months in game time
