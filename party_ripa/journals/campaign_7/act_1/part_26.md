# RIPA: Part 26
## Session 26 (2024-01-10)
### Day 26, time unknown, inside the All Seeing Eye cube at Saiyadar

It was all going so well, until it wasn't.

* We have used the teleportation helm to jump into some sort of treasure room without permission.
* Arturo had seen an Obscura Forturum by scrying with a True Sight crystal ball we located at the (now clear of evil) scrying pool, but the Obscura gained a hold over him.
* While Francesc was trying to get the Obscura away from him, Arturo ended up spider climbing into the upper corner of the room, and was then entangled there with vines.
* Francesc got hold of the Obscura, but was then *herself* taken over by it, so now they both are under an influence that neither Penny nor Thorin understand.
* For some reason, the incredibly useful True Sight crystal ball has been put on the pedestal where the Obscura - which we can't use at all - once stood.
* Penny and Thorin know what's going on, but don't know what to do about it.

Oh, yeah... And Vallin turned out to be a mummy lord, too.

Penny gets close to Francesc, hoping her aura will help with fighting off the Obscura's effects, casts L2 Bless on everyone, then tries to convince Francesc to put the Obscura back; no good (4+7->11). Thorin tries, with Penny's help; 16,16+1->17.

Arturo and Francesc aren't too impressed. Arturo tries to argue that *two* balls is the right thing to have. He needs to loot everything else in the room to make his Obscura dreams come true! He appeals to Thorin's love of gold... Persuasion 24! Stubborn - and convincing. Even Penny's struggling to anchor herself to her good alignment, to avoid being swayed by the argument.

Francesc insight - 13, and Arturo - 8; we're in so much trouble. They're convinced the orb tells the truth! Thorin - insight 26; realises that they're not behaving rationally (they've constructed a new reality which justifies everything). She has to give up. She drops Bless in favour of Detect Magic, at Thorin's suggestion.

The room is quite magical - the room itself is warded, ah, so, the oracle must surely know we're in here. Even with help, Penny only gets arcana 10-1->9. Many magical items in the room. Penny tries to describe the magic; perception 13; Thorin thinks the room is warded against certain *types* of magic. It's protected, somehow.

Thorin was persuaded to loot the room, in the mean time. Arturo is keen to take anything magical. Three staffs stand out; one ancient, made of wood; one made of maybe platinum, weaving shapes intertwined, and one made of glass. Thorin estimates hundreds of thousands of gold's worth of emeralds too. Penny tries to intervene again - ignoring the obscura, taking this means that we're making an enemy of Vallin and risking the entire plane if her story of the extraplanar incursion creatures & the lich at Neverwinter is true.

Frances agrees *that* part - Obscura aside! - and doesn't care if Penny takes the True Sight ball. She points out we've no escape plan either, for all this loot. Arturo wants to hide as much as we can in the bag of holding, but Francesc is guarding it closely. He tries to break free of the grasping vines - it takes four attempts before he can manage it, partly because Thorin has become distracted by examining the glass staff; Arcana 18. It's a magical staff of force. It can create extensions of things like Mage Hand or walls of force. Then he looks at the wodden staff; Arcana 21. The staff speaks to Thorin in particular - a staff that must be attuned to by a druid or a ranger. It's made out of part of a living tree, the tree still magically alive; staff of woodlands. If planted in the ground it turns into a huge tree; it channels druidic and ranger magic too (gives you kinda spell slots effectively). Finally, metal - Arturo gets this one, 17, staff of power. That and the glass staff require a wizard to attune.

Francesc suggests that we could just leave all of this here until we're done with the lich at Neverwinter & maybe Vallin and anyone else, and come back for it all later. Penny points out - yes, but the same is true of the Obscura!

Then there's the matter of getting out of the room. Penny examines the magic covering the room, warding it; Arcana 20-1->19. Everthing in the room is covered in warding magic. EVERY object. Every gem, every staff, the door itself; it faces "inward". We don't know if teleportation would work; attempting it might be deadly! Penny notes the Orb of True Sight is not covererd in that magic; Thorin wants to use it on the pedestal to see something. He decides to, once again, scry the lich in Neverwinter. No attunement needed; but then again, Arturo didn't need it in the scrying pool either.

A beautiful dressing room. Curtains drawn. A view from up towards the ceiling, looking down to the lich sat at a huge dresser. Three mirrors; her reflection is there but she looks withered and old there, basically - well - an undead lich; the reflections seem to give a 'true' representation of her form. In gloved hands, she holds the same crystal that we've seen before - a shard of night, star above; she mumbles something, a strange language, rant-like though! A swirling of indentured spirits surround her. Ghosts, "chained" to her somehow; she seems to draw strength from them for her incantations. Doesn't seem to notice the scrying - very focused. Thorin, at Arturo's request, moves the 'viewpoint' to through the curtains. It's mid-afternoon; on a hill, outside Baldur's Gate, of all places, which is visible in the distance.

We do our best to sketch the view, to try and figure out - if we go there - what this viewpoint might be. We look in particular for landmarks, **such as the main gate and outer wall** which are prominent and close. We're north of the bridge, on the hill looking back at the city. We move the viewpoint outside and look back at the house for good measure! **Two storey, manor/villa, stood on its own**. Surprisingly it looks poorly kept; once grand, now overgrown.

Before Penny can grab it, Thorin pockets the True Sight orb! 

Francesc thinks that there's more to this than meets the eye. She reckons the orb should need attunement, but the scrying pool *and* the pedestal help with not needing to attune. In a flash, **she puts the Obscura on the pedestal to try and use it!**

WIS saves all round, but within aura.

All of us except Arturo now fall free of influence, but Arturo continues to believe in the orb's power. The Obscura keeps trying to persuade Arturo - and this time, with it on the pedestal, we *all* see the vision it gives. Motes of light explode like a nebula, rapidly create a universe, where Arturo stands in front of the lich Valindra Shadowmantle, looking at her as her armies all moving towards her, on a tower; but Arturo says "no", throws a fireball - the biggest ever - and it all crumbles to dust. He walks away, people are clapping and cheering - including the three of us! His potato bag produces spell gems, we're carrying all his stuff; unlimited wealth, anything he wants - it just keeps going.

Thorin casts Starry Wisp to distract Arturo - 26 to hit! - and moves to swap the orbs again ("No! Don't touch the ball!" shouts Francesc!). Arturo is momentarily distracted by the spell and the 9 damage! Before he gets a chance to swap the balls, Francesc wants to use slugs to move it into the bag of holding... Initiative:

* Francesc 22
* Arturo 18
* Thorin 16
* Penny 8

The slugs take the obscura and put it into the bag of holding. Arturo now sees an empty pedestal. He says, "But I'm on board with the plan of leaving everything here and coming back later, because the obscura told me how to do kill the lich!" - uuuh, insight! Penny 9 (he's telling the truth obviously), Thorin 18 (who thinks he's telling the truth also).

"Fine! Lets get *out* of here!" says Thorin. "Put it back on the pedestal and let's go" - then apologises to Arturo and gives him a Potion of Healing.

Thorin tries to teleport us all out. He's got the pillow from the room outside and two charges left on the helm. Francesc insists that Arturo goes through second! Thorin holds the pillow, and activates the helm. A rip in reality appears, but we don't notice behind us another rip opening - we walk through... ...and step back into the same room.

"OK. Right." says Penny, helpfully.

There's an argument about just opening the door! Penny goes, "Oh for heaven's sake..." - marches up to the door and turns the handle. DEX save - 6. The door is open; it's clear that there's a ward on the door; Penny tries outstretching her hand through the doorway slowly... A moment passes - then there's a voice. "Are you coming out?" - Vallin. Penny says, "OK, don't shoot!" and steps out.

Thorin calls out, "Can we take that staff?!" "Oh, the one you *tried* to take already?!" - cue lots of faux protests! We all file out of the room - naughty kids. Thorin does try to bring the staff, as if to show Vallin, but as he steps out the staff springs back into the room, hurting his hand.

A canopic golem hovers outside, arms crossed, watching, amused apparently.

"Which staff did you want to bargain for?" asks Vallin. Arturo tries to argue that we get this staff now and the other two upon completion of task, persuasion 21! "I can't blame you for trying. But how about I let you take the staff to use as up-front payment, and you get to keep it if you complete the task. Do you want to know what the job is?"

"Go on" says Penny.

"Dispose of Valindra Shadowmantle - neutralise her - and you remove most of the threat, but not all of it. There is an object that she possesses. It is this object which draws the darkness to her. It is not from your plane, it does not belong on your plane and it cannot remain on your plane. I have the power to destroy it." (She means the Shadowfell shard we saw through the orb, of course).

The golem performs some kind of rune ritual to be able to fetch the staff from the treasure room. Before giving it to Thorin, Vallin/golem says - "You are certain you want to agree to this?" "Yes!" we all say, except Francesc who's in the middle of saying "Wait, are we..." - but runes are forming on the golem's arm and travel across the staff, but don't settle on Arturo; Francesc and Thorin briefly discuss who should take it - but it seems clear it's best for Thorin. As he takes it, the runes flow onto Thorin's arm. They lift off, circle around him and disappear into him.

We put the True Sight orb into the bag of holding. Francesc takes the helm, because Thorin needs to attune to the staff.

The golem starts to lead us out. "I trust you have the equipment you need... You've been armed, and armed with knowledge. Is there anything else?"

**Francesc asks if we can come back to ask her to help destroy the phylactory when we're ready to attack the lich? Vallin agrees.**

Vallin notes that the longer we take, the higher the risk that Valindra becomes aware of our plans, or that we've met Vallin, or that the extraplanar beings reach her. She also notes that it would be risky to ever scry her - she could well be aware of it and actively try to block it *or* permit it.

Thorin can't resist it and asks about the Obscura. "It is perhaps a little too powerful for you to control!" she says. "But how do we know it's not controlling you?" "Well, how would you? And what would you, or anyone you know, have anything to do about it?"

...fair. (We realise later that the whole thing was probably a test!)

We're taken through passageways, until we get to the body of Mayastan. "I assume you're taking him?" Penny picks him up - our plan was to try taking him to Candlekeep. The golem leaves.

Alessia walks up. "Vallin tells me you're ready to go?"

After a bit more to-and-fro, we're led to the exit; the invisible walkway at a strange angle. Thorin gives Francesc a helpful push... It's the same queasy experience, but we're a bit more familiar. We touch down; the priest who showed us the way up, says, "A good visit then? We have all been very curious, because the cube was shut while you were in there and nobody has been allowed in."

Penny points to the dead body over her shoulder!

We're asked about Xemru Thal, and we found notes implying he became a golem! "He's become a voice of the oracle..." says Arturo, tactfully.

We're offered a chance to relax at the "pools of meditation" to reflect on our experience (!) - Arturo asks them to at least cast Gentle Repose on the dead body to help it avoid further degredation and Francesc starts to acclimatise to the helm.

(While we rest, Penny asks if Arturo *really* believes that he's goign to destroy the lich with the world's largest fireball after while we'll all carry his stuff for him...? "Yep!")

So, Candlekeep. The tavern or our bastion? Tavern's closer to the library - but we have a dead body - **meh, it'll be funny**. Penny steps through last, carrying the dead body. It's about 6:30-7pm, many people seem drunk; most seem to assume the body is drunk - but then someone calls out, "Is that Mayastan?!" and people start crowding around. "Is he dead? What happened?!" etc. - and suddenly everyone is trying to help us carry the body. It ends up looking like a funeral procession.

At Candlekeep - who let us in immediately! - the Prime Reader comes down. "What's going on?!" - Thorin explains. Little One must have heard the rapidly-spreading rumours, runs out of the tavern, is distressed but then says - rather obviously! - "He needs Resurrection!". Little One carries him towards the chapel. The Prime Reader thanks us and says they'll let us know when he awakens. Francesc says "Oh, and let us know when you've decided what reward we have!"

"I ahave a headache" says Penny, and heads to the tavern; the mood is split - some think it's a wake; some think he's been resurrected. Penny (persuasion 20+7->27!) points out it's the latter; the mood lifts; we get free food and drink.

### 10pm, Bastion

By about 9pm, we decide to traipse back to our keep, arriving before 10am - we're getting good at finding a direct route. We are greeted by the middle-aged (~110) year old engineer gnome who agreed to run the keep for us, who is going by the name of **Alfred** in his role here. There's a goblin **Jave** who runs the kitchen too. Our rooms were:

* Francesc:
  - Library, looked after by a helper from Candlekeep (due to arrive tomorrow - see day 27 - **Mayastan**!)
  - Workshop, which **Alfred** looks after since he's an engineer
* Thorin:
  - Garden, who **Jave** looks after when not cooking
  - Druidic sanctuary, looked after by a female 19-year old werebear called **Maloy**
* Arturo:
  - Arcane Study, looked after by Mayastan (from day 27)
  - Barracks, managed by red-headed dwarf **Vilhamena**
* Penny:
  - Armoury, managed by red-headed dwarf **Vilhamena**
  - Smithy, run by red-headed dwarf **Vilhamena**

We settle in for bed, finally! Francesc and Penny are in the loft. Arturo and Thorin are in the ground floor. Thorin, perception 9; Arturo WIS save - 4... In his dream, his prior vision carries on. After he destroys the lich, "What comes next?!" he is asked by admirers. He's set the world to peace, so wanders into the forest, killing any oppressors, a sort of violet Robin Hood! A free agent, but "benevolent" take-down of what he sees as evil. With a thought, he can open a fey portal at any time to appear in any part of the forest, at peace.



### Day 27

A knock on the trapdoor; a head pops up, gnome head appears; "Oh you're awake!" to Francesc. "I suppose you want breakfast? Jave has made food!" We head downstairs, to find Arturo and Thorin already awake, having smelled the food first.

At around 9am, there's a knock on the door. Alfred opens it. Mayastan is there! Penny makes the terrible joke, "You're looking very good for a dead person!"

"I guess I am. And I believe I have you to thank for that? What happened? Is this something we can talk about openly?"

We learn that Mayastan found it the whole organ swapping thing is a "calling", rather than a "choice"! He didn't get to choose and wasn't happy about it - and then he offers his own services for help in the library and study. **Thorin eagerly gives him the notes to "The Elf That Barely Helped"**.

We spend time looking over the whole keep, giving instructions, helping clean things up and so-on, getting to know them and it.

### 3pm

We finally meet up outside, in the sanctuary. So, what now?

* We set Mayastan on research about the crystal golems; can they be destroyed in ways other than outright battle?
* We'll go to Neverwinter; check on Thorin's armour then investigate more about the whole underdark connections, forest destruction ordered by Velindra and so-on

Francesc teleports us using Penny's armour. It causes great distress when we just appear out of nowhere inside the shop front! Thorin's armour isn't ready yet... "I'm working on it! I would say... Fourteen days away from finishing it. And then a day to buff it and polish it, cleaning it all up."

We sell a few things to Hela before moving on to Tamyo, as Arturo is sure he doesn't need his Pearl Of Power anymore. He gets 220gp for it! Not bad!

Thorin wants to talk to trees where things are being cut down, to see if they can give any information on *why* it's being done. They might've overheard something! His new staff lets him do it. It's a long way from Neverwinter, though, so we'd have risk the helm on a teleport to the familiar location of the tavern we stayed at there.

Francesc gives it a go... 25% chance of it going wrong... D100->22. We land off target; we walk through the portal tear and emerge some 100ft away from a road, a forest distant - but Neverwinter is behind us. We've hardly moved! Oops. At least we're kind of in the right direction; Francesc is about to try again, but the group wonders if we should hold back a charge in case of emergencies since we'll be stuck out in the forest now, and might get attacked. But we realise that we don't know how urgent things are, so we decide to go for it.

We surprise people, yet again, in a tavern! This is the tree tavern from way back. We finally spot a familiar face - the satyr behind the bar. "Oh!" they call, "You're the people who left the kids! You look a little different...".

(Francesc tries to sense for dragons within 5 miles, thinking of the gem dragon. None within 5 miles).

Arturo asks the barkeeper where the loggers have reached - "You'll want to head to the front... If you're headed to the front, could you take some supplies with you?" "Sure!"

"What's your name, by the way?" asks Penny! "**Saipen**". We introduce ourselves. We have a drink before we go! We end up with four pours of freshly-made wild berry mead. Thorin tries to buy a tankard; "No!". After some bartering, Francesc agrees to swap her Southside Ales Neverwinter tankard for a wooden mug - Saipen explains that there are lots of bar brawls, stuff gets broken and they can't just give things away.

* Saipan explains that the reason trees are being cut down is just to do with the rebuild of Neverwinter & to sell, to fund that rebuild.

* Thorin asks a tree; it doesn't have any extra information, but does say that the destruction does seem to be indiscriminate - when logging, usually there's much more careful selection not just razing entire sections. And it's a long way from Neverwinter. The tree says the woods are very specials; there are some trees that only grow here and nowhere else. "I've known them for hundreds of years. They are my closest friends."

This at least is a clue that there's more going on; life is being removed from entire sections. The tree knows there are layers and layers of old civilisations deep under the roots but doesn't know what significance those have to the people that might've lived there once, or the people cutting things down today. The tree thinks that this particular section is being chopped down because it's one of the oldest areas, and was spared be the eruption of the volcano (and is the area next to the river).

In due course, we head out towards the front, using Saipen's directions, carrying the various supplies - three crates and a bag. It's a lot, but we can just about carry it all. It takes about an hour and a half; in the final ten minutes, we know we're close! Camp fires, a change in the air, smoke around; sound ahead; missing trees in places. Thorin and Francesc notice well before Penny and Arturo two people that then drop out of trees and draw rapiers - but then they notice the suppliers and look bashful. They tell us to keep quiet and take us a distance before explaining, "We think they're going to do something tonight! The ranger thinks we should strike preemptively."

The opinion here is that everything is being raised out of spite - that they asked nicely not to cut down the forest, so then they returned and cut down *everything*. These woods are meant to be protected; it's the heart of the wood; they should never have come here - there are managed forests within half a day of Neverwinter!

We figure we really need to try and see inside a tent or similar for the people in charge down below - see if we can get lucky...

...but meanwhile we're being guided up a tree; Arturo bounds up no issue, Penny manages to haul up inelegantly by brute force but Francesc and Thorin have a lot of trouble - falls, takes Francesc down with her. But eventually, we're up the tree. We see a semicircle of barricades around a camp, manned by guards. The camp fires we saw at a distance turn out to all be within the logger camp. **It's devastation here** - much further than we saw last time. Whole new sections are cleared, *razed* completely, as the tree Thorin saw said; it seems to have been burned, too.

Thorin looks closely. There are furrows criss-crossing the ground in most recently cleared areas, and mounds of earth. **They're looking for something**.

We break here, considering options.

(End of part 26)
