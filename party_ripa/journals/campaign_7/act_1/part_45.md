# RIPA: Part 45
## Session 45 (2024-07-16)
### Day 44, late, Waterdeep

After tackling the Drow Priestess and Spider Dragon, we recovered the first rod segment and returned to our Candlekeep bastion. The next day, we went into the Candlekeep library to try and find out more about where the second segment might be.

Our rod segment gave us various visions which led us to understanding it *had* been in Sigil, but was transported away on a galleon called Lambent Zenith. The galleon appeared to have been destroyed in what we *think* is the Astral Sea. We learned - but must never speak of how, to not betray a trust! - a possible way to get to Sigil, involving the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Lady Laeral Silverhand. She has a sister called Alustriel who we think current resides in Sigil. Given this connection, Lady Silverhand might be able to help us get there.

For a helm focus, we decided to see if anyone from Waterdeep was at the Candlekeep tavern. We met a group of four adventurers. Although we were looking for a Helm focus, we found competition! The group turned out to be, as best we could tell, generally lawful but more evil-aligned. The friendliest was half-orc possible druid Kolli, accompanied by Dragonian Vercatus Caramanthus from the world of Krynn and his "pet" drake Vercatus Jr., human paladin Debrah Landers, and Wilim, an undead Red Wizard of Thay. Awkward conversation did at least bear fruit, as Kolli turned out to be something of a souvenir collector and had a Yawning Portal tankard! We traded with a spare one of our own.

Given that we figured we were now in a race, Arturo elected to bribe our rival group's own researcher for additional information. This made us all-but-certain they were after part of the rod too. There was interest in the husks of dead gods, so perhaps the galleon collided with one; we are not sure. We do not know its destination, but think it was being taken to something called the Golden Vault, which is most likely to be a place called the Radiant Citadel (as well as having some kind of presence in Sigil, too).

Once in Waterdeep, we we learned that gaining an audience with Lady Silverhand would be almost impossible... Except the Yawning Portal's barkeep and owner, Durnan - after some persuasion - arranged for an evening meeting with a shady-sounding character called Mirt. Mirt has council connections that are generally kept quiet. If anyone can get us in, he can.

After spending the afternoon trading in Waterdeep. During some downtime, equivalent short rest; Penny switches from Sword to Crystal Ball to be able to try and scry on the opposition in Candlekeep. She also uses her Querria contact method to send a brief message - "Demigorgon trying to break onto this plane; seems centred near Menzobarrazan" - and then the hour is upon us and we return to the Yawning Portal for our meeting.

### Evening

It's much busier! Nearly full, in fact. Loud, lively, some arguments, some games being played and so-on. Durnan seems to be the only person behind the bar; other staff are on the various floors. He sees us and waves. We've got a few minutes spare, so Penny says she'll go to the room to try and try Scrying against the other party. We start going up; on the way, Arturo warns us against it; they must surely have defences. Besides it'll take too long - some 10 minutes to cast; Penny relents.

On our way back, we bump into someone who seems to think that we are people Durnan was looking for. Francesc insight 11, seems legit! Has a tray of drinks and the staff outfit... We're to go to "room 2 at the back". There's a heavy velvet curtain; Penny goes in first, Arturo encouraging her to "make an impression" (!), then Arturo, Francesc and Thorin side by side.

There's a round table, with some food and drink, at which is sat a short, fat human, balding, wearing big gold chains with medallions; a ruffled collar shirt; a jacket with gold brocade and cuffs; a large gem set into the top of a sceptre/cane; and there's an old white dog slumped on the ground, almost a melting puddle of fur. It barely moves to look at us when we come in before slumping back down again.

He asks who we are; Penny gives introductions. The usual general pleasantries for introduction, of course! During this, Francesc, insight 27; he does have some distant past of adventuring in some point, but he's trying to make out that he's a different - presumably better - person now. A strange mix.

He orders lots more food - his shout!

We get to business. Silverhand can get across planes; so can **Vajra**, "**The Blackstaff**". Penny pulls out the Welcome To Waterdeep leaflet and finds out that this person is kind of a chief magic user; a headmistress at something called the Blackstaff Academy. An audience? Well, "Leirol" does visit Sigil to visit her sister. Varja can do it because she simply has the magic to do so.

Arturo points out that having a two-way door, not a one-way casting, might be useful if we ever want to get back! Moreover the casting from Vajra would incur a fee - thousands of gold for such a spell, in fact; do we have a sponsor?!

OK, so, Leirol it is! Mirt will help to get us an audience. He also offers advice, on Arturo's enquiry, on how to best deal with her.

* There's an issue of elf culture.

* Leirol is an elf - but an elf squared! Leirol is to other elves as elves are to the likes of us. She is one of seven maidens who were selected who-knows-how-long-ago as "Mistress Chosen". They're sisters in *magic*, not in biology; the appointed daughters of the Goddess Of Magic.

* She views the word as someone who is essentially immortal; she's seen the rise and fall of civilisations often.

* We need to find out what motivates *her*. She has no fear of death, or need for wealth, or desire of power. She has taken the Open Lord position almost, surprisingly, out of altruism; she had to oust the previous Lord, as he was siphoning the wealth of the city away through corruption to rebuild Neverwinter.

And now - what does Mirt want in return? He runs many companies. One is called **Waterdeep Wards And Districts Construction**. It has encountered some problems into which he wants us to look; slightly sensitive; "I think it could be good because of the unique make-up of your party!". In the East, beyond the City Of The Dead (!), is a vast underground network of Dwarven tunnels, where the Dwarven community lives, extending well beyond and underneath the city walls into the surrounding countryside. Mirt has the contract for all construction work in the city, but finds it confusing and difficult to work over in the East side due to conflict with "other cultural claims" - the Dwarven concept of the boundary of their area extends inside the city walls.

He wants us to speak to them - to be able to work on things above-ground, over their tunnels, but inside the city walls. The trouble is, above-ground works still require things like pipes or foundations below. The dwarves don't have one leader, so it's hard to negotiate; and what's more, a recent war led to a refugee crisis in the city which has never been resolved and a lot of the refugees have ended up hiding underground in the same tunnels that they might need to excavate in order to build new parts of the city.

Arturo asks if he would be willing to accept concessions, e.g. hiring dwarves from that area - and Mirt will, but only for members of the Construction Union.

The food arrives and conversation continues a while but in the end Mirt leaves to give us space to discuss whether or not we want to do this. We don't think we can exactly resolve this! But Arturo suggests we at least offer to try and get people around a table. Negotiate. He can't find a leader, so we have to find representatives with actual authority. That's more attainable.

Mirt comes back and we lay down our proposal. Arturo with Penny's help try to persuade him; ADV persuasion only 22, but could be worse... He counter-offers. A meeting would be a good start. But he specifically wants to find out who has been sabotaging the construction efforts and have it stopped, he'll throw in 10,000gp for us. The offenders would, though, be sent through the Waterdavian courts.

He hands us a (beautiful-looking) business card; "Mirt The Moneylender", with an address. Once we've got something to report, we should go and find him.

We finish the food and Penny decides to try the scrying, despite Arturo's warnings. DC17 + 0 saving throw for their party. She opts to try and scry the strange draconic Ranger, as the one who might, maybe, have the lowest wisdom resilience (Francesc can fall prey to similar effect spells herself sometimes) and be least likely to "notice" / resist the spell.

And... It works!

Inside the crystal ball, Penny sees the draconian feeding some sort of chunk of animal to the "pet" drake. The drake is tied up to a post, within a stables. The ranger stands and walks out; the eye follows; and Penny realises that the drake was being fed part of someone's horse or party! The Draconian then walks into an adjacent inn; it's very dim inside; he sits with the rest of the group. He asks, "Do we wait for it to pass?" Debrah answers that the longer the wait, the more things can change. The information they have might be old. Days or weeks. "We need to make a move." Wilim answers, "It's risky - I've never been before - I don't know what's going to happen..." and Debra says, "I'd rather not be *here* when it happens! I'd rather be somewhere safe. Are you *sure* it's going to start here?" Wilim says "No; we're not the *first* place, but I think it might happen any time. And when it does, I would probably survive! As for the rest of you... I'm not so sure."

Vercatus says, "Why not go to Krynn?" and Wilim scoffs. "Krynn is the wrong place to be! Nothing's happening on Krynn. Sure, there may be _something_ there - we don't know where it is - and **each piece leads to the next**. We need to get one of them first, and I'm telling you! That party has one of those pieces. I sensed it. Are you going to listen to me or do I need to go my own way?" Then Wilim hisses. "Wait!" - he casts something. He's looking for her spell, she thinks... Arcana 20-1. He's casting True Seeing. He looks straight at the arcane scrying censor. Penny drops her scrying spell. The last thing she sees is Wilim looking at the censor, two dots of light in his sunken eye sockets.

It tells us nothing new really, although confirms suspicions. We think the 'starting' reference might be related to all of Toril given the Krynn discussion, not (say) a specific town.

Penny asks if we have Sending. If this party can't scry us, they'll have to do it the old fashioned way - and that would lead the to the bastion. And we can't warn them. Penny suggests one of us remove our amulet, so they *can* find us. Thorin argues against it; he thinks they're too strong. In the end we find out that Waterdeep has pay-for messaging services; we pay 20gp and get a warning message sent to the Bastion. That four might come looking; they *can* say where we went; but they might need to defend themselves.

### 8:30pm

We notice that there are *lots* of businesses still open in Waterdeep. It doesn't sleep! We decide to go and see what we can find out more about the dwarven community. We head to the eastern side of the city, but it takes an hour to get there!

Francesc is very good at that kind of thing - investigation 19 - she finds plenty of dwarves around taverns, walking around generally; Penny with Arturo's help asks random passers-by about where we might find people who know about that wider, underground community. ADV persuasion 22. There's no "guild of dwarves" or similar, but they point out a particular tavern as dwarves there might know more about the 'undercity'.

They're quite suspicious and cautious, though. They don't really want to be associated with the topic.

Well, it's getting late, but we get to the tavern. Very much late-drinks-o-clock. The place is run by dwarves, lots of dwarven patron. Nobody pays much attention to us. Thorin looks around. He spots a few tables where dwarves sound like they have a specific intonation, a dialect, for deep dwarves.

Thorin, knowing the customs, goes to buy drinks for people he might want to talk to! All the ales are dwarven; some have names of other cities above the barrels, while some are locally made. Penny says, "Get me one while you're there"... Thorin sees a barrel from his city. This catches the attention of dwarves on the bar - "Are you from the Sunset Mountains? His cousin is from the Sunset Mountains!" - and so-on.

The rest of us get to observe Thorin awkwardly socialising.

In fairness, he has a good angle - "I'm new to the city and interested in that network of tunnels underneath it!" - ADV persuasion; 3,3+1 -> 4! He uses Inspiration. 18! That's better. The conversation begins to smooth out.

(We're also going through the ales... Penny, CON save 15; Arturo 21; Francesc 18 - thanks to aura).

* They get quite worked up at one point. There are definitely tensions!
* They ask if we've seen construction... "Have you seen what they've tried to do?!"
* This group doesn't agree with it *at all*.
* The Dwarves, however, have **definitely not been sabotaging anyone** - why would they do that?
* So who do *they* think it is? They don't want to "throw anyone under the bus"
* But they mention having 'no representation' - Penny persuasion 21 asks if it's refugees; well, kinda - turns out it is goblins. They're considered vermin! Unwanted. Their villages and encampments were destroyed during the Dragon War too, but they've not been housed, unlike anyone else.

(Penny is surprised - whole *tribes* of goblins that *aren't* just attacking people, stealing stuff and generally fighting!)

(Penny has some thoughts as RP continues; they don't have representatives etc.; they try to use the right channels but get ignored, or it's too slow; so if we can persuade Mirt to persuade Leirol...)

They do mention that the city is run by the "Masked Lords" who are anonymous for safety, as well as the Open Lord. We realise that Mirt must be one such Masked Lord.

Thorin asks who the most respected and senior person in that city. They look surprised - that should be obvious? **Why, the chief brewer, of course!** At this very tavern in fact.

(Penny wonders if, should she go next door, they'd have exactly the same story! Insight is only 8 - nah,  seems legit).

At one point in a misguided attempt at ingratiation, Penny shows them the dark steel sword. It does cause some excitement but Penny is soon being berated for not looking after it properly!

With beer all drunk, we head home very late. We know a representative for the dwarves now. Back at our room in the Yawning Portal, Arturo points out that we also could do with a head of the goblins. We were told they do have tribal leaders. We need to give them some kind of legitimacy.

If the goblins are "brought to the table" without explanation, Mirt would figure out that they probably were the vandals and want legal action; negotiations would fail. So instead, make it seem that the dwarves want to bring them. They have a burden of responsibility and want these goblins to be better represented, so that they can get what they want and gain more independence.

We certainly need to know what the goblins would like as an outcome. Integration with the city? Stay underground, with some reassurances / known areas of residence? Total chaos? Who knows!



## Day 45
### The Yawning Portal, morning

We awake early in a very noisy city!

We don't waste time. We head East. This time, we can use the public transport! "Drays", tall wagons that only cost 1cp per person. It doesn't take too long. Over there, we can see much more evidence of activity below - grates in the streets with steam rising up, chimney stacks that seem to come up from below ground and so-on. We find last night's tavern; and we find the head brewer - **Sigmud Hopcrusher**.

We explain our basic idea and he says we should meet with goblin chieftains **Tupin** and **Morick**. He calls for a guide to take us down and says, "and show them the sights!", so we figure we're getting the full tour down there. Thorin insight 23; it's definitely a "there's something I want them to see" thing.

We're taken down a complex route, past brewing tanks, then store rooms, hallways and more; but eventually, pretty quickly, those store rooms and hallways become conversions to a refugee camp. People huddled in corners, pots over hot stones, lots of goblin women and children. Thorin nudges Arturo and Arturo starts handing out potatoes!

The people here are trying to keep some semblance of dignity and day to day ritual but they look rough; it's clear that everyone is living in very difficult conditions, clustered together. There are a few humans in clerical robs, a bit tattered, handing out food here and there. Must be from the **Temple Of Ilmata** - a name we heard mentioned in relation to soup kitchens, in the tavern late last night.

A woman approaches to speak to our guides. They're very worried about work continuing above; do they have to move? No, not yet; work hasn't restarted. This turns out to be **Morick**. Arturo explains our sympathies and desire to try and effect meaningful change. Some of he words are unusual; it's a hybrid of Common and a Fey language with some overlap with Sylvain.

Their desires? Return home. There are *thousands* of them down here. They've tried sending out scouts, but the scouts never returned. There are only two surviving tribal heads, her and Tupin, but this is still an uneasy alliance of headless tribes. This is why things have been escalating a bit; some people are getting restless and angry, apparently stuck in this stalemate, and have turned to violence. They are from the Triboar Hills, up North; driven out by dragons; it's a month or so of travel; they want to return.

We could certainly help with the scouting, via the Helm to just "pop over there", check it out, then come back here. We can then try to help with their migration. We don't want to promise the world, but we can start with a few steps... Morick does not want to raise false hope herself, but trusts us to take someone to their home grounds. She is too old, she says, but would trust her grandson to go. Now we need to find out who Tupin would like to send. Morick takes us down a hallway and along to a kind of tower; but upon seeing her, they say things like, "There's been no change" - so we immediately realise that he's not doing so well.

An old, ill goblin is there. Penny, medicine check 18. Frail, really just old age. Not something that can be healed. But he has some time left, and a bit of hope might go a long way. And when we explain that we can fast-travel someone to their home grounds to scout it, then back again, he *does* dare to dream and have some hope. So, who would he like to travel? He has two daughters. One of them will go.

We wonder what might work as a helm focus; if a building is destroyed, would a focus work? We know there is a time factor too, and it will have been at least four *years* since they were there.

Luck roll, Arturo -> 3!

### The attack

The ground starts to shake. Debris falls. People take cover. Thorin notices from our dwarf guide a sense of waiting; no, not normal; then the goblins realise too; **and there's a wave of panic**. "We need to move!" But this is *not* construction. The ground shakes more and more things start to fall. Then there is thudding; deep, booming and rumbling. The daughters are trying to help Tupin to safety. Penny ends up covering Tupin and Morick with her shield as best she can; we run with them. A few feet away a tunnel suddenly collapses, lots of goblins we saw down there suddenly lost from view; Thorin starts to try Mould Earth off an arm that sticks out under rock. Penny casts Aid as he does this on Tupin, Morick and our Dwarven guide - how is tugging on her cape, "We need to *leave*!"

Four goblin children are freed by Thorin's spell. People are swarming. More tunnels begin to fail. Thorin thinks quickly; he casts Conjure Animals - giant badgers (about as big as members of our party). *Eight* of them appear and immediately get to work - some tunnelling upwards, to try and get us out quickly; some dig out trapped people from the nearest collapsed sections; our party tries to keep together. ATHL checks, Penny 4+7->11 (she's got the shield up to protect others), Francesc 20, Thorin 18, Arturo 12. We get up.

Above ground, some buildings are collapsing and crumbling. Things are shaking. Then Penny shouts, "Oh no - do you think it's them? Is this the demons coming through?" It isn't her party that answers - it's goblins. "No!" some shout, all pointing in the same direction; as they are doing this, we see a mother with a child drop to her knees in the middle of the street and start praying.

**"The statues!" they call out**.

We see two truly massive statues, at least 60ft high, walking! They're causing a lot of damage as they crash through the city, but these are statues that we thought were *part* of the city. Then another one, near the City Of The Dead with great angel wings, starts moving too. Griffons are flying up above but aren't attacking. The leaflet said that the statues are magical and related to the defence of the city. Penny repeats, *to her party more clearly*, "the demons! The statues are for defence of the city. Is this the demon attack?" - suddenly, fireballs burst out! Arturo senses a huge upwelling of magical energy all around.

We stagger to the middle of a square. The dwarf and two goblins are safer here - we tell them to stay put unless they need to go for any reason; the buildings falling are far away from the centre. Thorin turns into the Quetzalcoatlus form, Arturo jumps on and is about to cast Fly on Francesc and Penny when we realise that we can all be carried.

Once aloft we see that almost everyone is facing West; statues are moving kind of North-West. Arturo shouts "Fly up, but not too high! We don't want to become a target!" - some 40-or-so griffon riders are flying too. A shimmering shield is starting to appear over the city. We see what we know from our leaflet is Blackstaff Tower; people are stood atop, flinging spells towards the Western side of the city. **Something has breached the city protection.** A strange collection of leathery-winged things; a bit like bats, but with long legs, are visible towards the North; then huge tentacles smack down over the city walls on the ocean side at the West. They must be 20ft in diameter each! Something truly vast is emerging from the ocean.

Penny, perception 18; Francesc 9; Arturo 8; Thorin-Quetz DEX save, 15; he *just* avoids some of the incoming griffons. As we swing quickly around, Penny sees the ground over on the Eastern side - where the tunnels collapsed - heave and roil as something starts breaking through from underneath. So much for a safe place. We can see a settlement outside the city walls; the dwarves; chunks of smoke stacks and buildings are being lifted up and thrown aside as strange, armoured, sort of massive gorillas (!) with bloodshot eyes and huge fangs pick up the chunks and throw them at the city walls!

We see groups of heroes taking to the skies, flying. We see some focusing on a demon; it's too far away but Penny throws Scorching Rays from her Circlet of Blasting - even though it is far further than 120ft - to try and signal to the griffon riders that we're on their side. Arturo is using Message to try and tell them the same thing too. Her rays actually hit things! There are spectres, almost invisible, swarming in the air.

Penny has the Clairvoyance Charm from presumed-Vecna. She the sense, somehow, that this could help. She shouts out the plan, uses the Charm and looks - the world seems to "draw in", she focuses her attention - atop Blackstaff Tower, there is a young black woman with shoulder-length curly black hair, pulled back; she looks like the hand-drawn Blackstaff Vajra in the leaflet. She's holding a staff, channeling energy, commanding the statues; but *near* that, only about 500ft away, rising on a swirl of purple fog, is a familiar figure. **Structured robes, a golden metal crown, a metallic arm, one glowing eye, one metallic eye. It's Vecna**.

Vajra throws spell after spell; but a globe around Vecna seems to stop the magic going through.

Penny points forward and shouts, "Get us in between Vajra and Vecna!" but Arturo counters, "No! I was killed at the whim of a lich before... The goblins, we should defend them! They're always forgotten!" Thorin's feeling like a fight with Vecna too, but Penny is forced to agree with Arturo. It would be a suicide run. She shouts, "He's right. It's true. Maybe we can save *someone*. Head East!" - Francesc meanwhile is just firing arrows at spectres. Arturo wants to verify - Thorin-Quetz can't speak - so he uses Message - "You get that?" "Are you sure?" "I don't think we can change the outcome of that fight."

Thorin-Quetz looks down to the beasts flooding through in the East. That's a bit more manageable. Something we can take down. OK then. He takes us in that direction.

As we turn, for all the swarming creatures, we do note that there only seems to be one creature that's coordinating attacks, and that seems to be Vecna. Then we see a sickly green ray extend out from a finger towards a statue. The statue disintegrates into dust!

The noise is extraordinary. Screams from below, roars, crackles of arcane energy, deep thuds and booms, louder cracks of explosions; we see one of the big gorilla-like creatures that's jumping over rubble to try and climb a city wall, smashing archers aside. The loss of life is horrifying. The priests of Ilmata are trying to put up *something* - wards, shields, who knows.

Thorin-Quetz aims for the nearest thing - that great creature. Francesc starts firing. We're about 500ft away.

Suddenly there's a Sending spell in Penny's head. She allows it in. Mayastan! **"We are evacuating - we need to defend Candlekeep! It is under attack!"** - Penny is barely able to figure out a response with everything going on around her, but manages - **"Thank you. Do what you can. Waterdeep is the same. All we can do is fight, and protect one another."**

(End of part 45)
