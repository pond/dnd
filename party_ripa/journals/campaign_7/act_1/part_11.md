# RIPA: Part 11
## Session 11 (2023-08-01)
### Day 8, around midday

We've met crow-people and talked to angry goblins... It's midday, we're at the Driftwood Tavern.

* We should talk to the Harbourmaster. That's probably our next move.
* We could go to the Mask and try to play the brothers with alcohol. Then try a shakedown. Maybe drop Shadowmantle's name, see their reaction.
* 6pm stakeout of the warehouse perhaps less important given the above.

We wrap up at the tavern and head for the Harbourmaster. We could go all the way around town, but there's also a ferry which crosses the harbour to the dock - much faster. It's only 5cp each, 2sp all round - why not.

It's an ungainly, simple, rectangular craft, with some 30 people crammed on board, plus four goats, a couple of crates and other sundry items. Including the wait, it only takes about 8 minutes. We end up at the pier, close to the Harbourmaster's office. Penny tries looking around - perception 3+2 -> 5... She walks confidently into a building and asks if it's the Harbourmaster's Office, but gets rapidly ejected; "You're not allowed in here"... Francesc outside figures out from a sign that it's probably a toilet for men!

Thorin does a *bit* better (perception 12); he sees a building with people queueing; we walk over and ask at the queue - and yes, that's the Harbourmaster's office. "You'd better have your forms filled out!" says someone. A rather confusing conversation about forms ensues... Penny eventually says "We're trying to get information about a recently departed ship which we have reason to believe is involved with criminal activity, and we've been working with 'inspector' Timus of the police to that end".

We eventually get inside. A heavy set woman with thick, wiry, salt & pepper hair pulled back in a bun sits at a desk. Tattoos reach from the sides of her face and down her neck, suggesting to Francesc a northern Reghed tribeswoman. We explain what we want (we're given 6 seconds to do it based on Penny's persuasion roll of 12); "So you want to requisition the departure's list. There's a form for that, but you look like you're in a hurry and that you have means..." - Thorin slides 2sp (!) onto the desk. She looks at it and shouts "next!" - Penny slides on a couple of gold in addition; she shouts "no, nope, never mind, it's alright, they have their forms!"

We're able to explain that it's within 2 days, a caravel and we know the warehouse that provided goods to it. That's just two entries from an otherwise very long list. Two different ship names. **The one from 3 days ago just recently came back into port**. She says, "**Pier 74**". Then, "NEXT!"

We shuffle outside.

* From 2 days ago, the name is **Palm Mongoose**
* From 3 days ago and back at Pier 74, is **Zephyr 3**

We search for Pier 74. It's a fair distance along the quieter, outside edge of the port; a fair distance from the suspect warehouse. Francesc, 17 survival, figures - given our recent Harbourmaster interaction - bribery might have a lot to do with how close ships get to warehouses of interest!

We wander along towards the pier, doing a close equivalent of whistling innocently. It seems the port has 75 docking areas; slot 74 is on the last pier of piers that generally seem to hold about 8 ships each. There are a couple of guards of a sort who stop us. "What do you want?" Penny says "We are going to bring the light of Meliki to those brave soldiers for whom any and all divine help may be of interest". Persuasion 22! They chuckle; "Going to knock on every cabin door, are you? Well, if you insist! Go on through!" - and as we're allowed through and we overhear them whisper, "How long before they realise that all the sailors are in the pubs?!"

Well, we've been practically *given* permission to board the ship. A Caravel, one main deck and a single cargo hold/sleeping area deck below, small twin sails. On board it smells remarkably, well, *clean* - most boats smell like animals - we decide to split up. Francesc and Arutro go for the captain's cabin while Penny and Thorin head down to the cargo deck. Francesc uses her slug-based (!) mage hand; they wriggle inside the keyhole but his arcana (11) isn't enough to get the hand to turn the handle properly when out of view. Arturo has a go. 6. Nope! Francesc tries sleight of hand; 7; nope again... Then they work together and *this* time Francesc figures it out (22).

A small 10ft x 10ft room, a cot in a corner and a small desk pushed up against a window. Francesc, investigation 17; a ledger, a folder containing a manifest and a locked drawer that she gets open using her dagger which has two notes inside along with a small locked box which rattles when shaken and sounds like coins.

* One note catches her eye immediately. **It has today's date and a departure time for tonight**. It's an unusual time; 11:30pm. Very late. Navigating out of harbour in the middle of the night can be very risky. The time is circled!

* The other note is more cryptic. "**Beware prying eyes. News of rumbling upriver. Possibly tracking the network. Do not allow yourself to be discovered**".

She puts them back, as best she can, positioned as they were found - but finds a note in tiny writing on the back of the second note in so doing: "**If the plan unravels, burn it all**".

* Ledger - 8 crew. Docking fees for *Luskan*.

* Manifest - fully cryptic! "6 Roosers. 4 Storks. 3 1/2 Unx Hare" - seems to be in code, which has a familiar ring to the way the network operates, but the code words are unfamiliar. We certainly know there are no animals here given the ship's cleanliness! We'll need a cipher, but there's no cipher here.

Francesc rummages around under the mattress of the cot. A poisoned dagger! She wants to wipe the poison off on the underside of the mattress and puts it back - just in case we end up on the receiving end of the blade - Arturo suggests he use Mage Hand for safety.

They exit. Relocking the door... Hmmm. Francesc examines the lock on the inside first, and with the help of the slugs and matching a DC13 Arcana check, gets the door relocked. Nobody should be any the wiser.

Meanwhile Penny and Thorin are at a trapdoor staircase that's lowered to walk down. Penny unlatches it and we lower it, then head down. It seems empty! Here, there's a slight smell of people; in a corner we find four hammocks and - curiously - makeshift crew quarters; we check that out first. No beds! Penny perception 14; there's a lock in this room, but it is on the *outside*. A bar on the outside of the door. It looks like heavy things have been dragged around in here as the floor has many long scratches. It's dark in here, but Thorin sees that the walls have long scratches as well; they don't look like hand scratches, but curiously, look like something was dragged against the wall as if the wall was a floor too! They're at all angles, too, so it's not as if something was pushed against the wall and scratched it while being dragged on the floor.

There are no animal claw marks or fingernail marks that we can see.

Penny needs more light; she lights the lamp. A strange phosphorescence happens wherever the scratch marks are; she brings the lamp closer to get a better look. A green flame sparks up and burns briefly along nearby scratch marks. There's a strange smell too; Penny doesn't recognise it; Thorin arcana 13, has a rough memory from a while ago of something smelling similar. Flammable! He warns Penny and she backs hastily away from the scratches.

We examine further. *All* of the scratches appear to be 3ft apart and run 3ft in length; almost like squares. We can't figure it out... We'll ask Francesc and Arturo, but meanwhile, we check out the rest of the cargo area. Aside from the four hammocks, there is an area that looks like it is used for eating and a galley of sorts - and an area where there are large, cast-iron D-rings bolted to the floor. That's useful for securing unruly animals. But again - no animal smells! This is at the far end of the boat, near the head (toilet).

We look closer around the D-rings with the lamp, for scratches or other things. Perception both, 20, 21; charcoal marks and little orange-coloured markings around the D-rings that look rather like drawings. Nothing we can particularly decipher; look like really bad attempts at drawings! Sun and forests and mountains. Kids drawings? Definitely not arcane, just bad! There's a consistency though - the same bad artist. So, one creature drawing.

Francesc and Arturo get down the stairs, seeing Thorin and Penny crouched over the floor with a lamp... Penny points behind her towards the strange room without turning around; "Something weird in there. Don't use fire!"

Francesc and Arturo investigate, Arturo taking some scrapings from a scratch but low rolls give few perceptive clues, but Francesc insight dirty 20 - there's a pattern to the scrapes. Where they are on the floor, corresponds to a position on the wall. This wasn't a box. It was something large, with a base and sides that almost reached the wall, so it was bumping around but the force it seems to have had is not just from ship movement. Either it's a box that moves itself - magic - or there was something inside it, moving around. The shape is strange, but we figure that the door and hatch above are only about 4ft wide so it must've been difficult to get anything larger in here. That might've forced a strange shape.

Thorin decides to start on Detect Magic as a ritual. Then we hear footsteps and voices - the guards. Penny runs up. "There's nobody here, is there!" - she accosts them; deception 13. They're suspicious, but not immediately aggressive. They shout down below - "Hey all of you! Off the ship! Right now!"

Well the gig's up. We're marched off the pier. We compare notes afterwards, but few conclusions.

* 8 crew; four beds for four people off shift, the other four on
* Something dangerous locked up in the interior room that moves around and smashes the place up a fair bit
* Something else locked to the D-ring that they want to keep an eye on.

Animal(s) in the locked room, people in the main hold?

Penny suggests we find an alchemist to see if we can figure out what the box in the crew quarters room was made of. Thorin wants to check out the Moonstone Mask. Arturo agrees. So, we split up. Thorin gives 100gp to Francesc and we separate.

Penny with Francesc's help randomly ask around for an alchemist. Persuasion 23; we happen to stumble across the three goblins from before. "You were right!" we're saying. Enthused, they tell us about an alchemist they know - down in The Scar, outside the city wall. We have an address. The guards recognise us (we look unusual for the dock area, after all) and we pass through the outer wall from the dock easily enough; then we get to the gate leading out to The Scar. The gate's not guarded - so, probably safe these days. Penny opens it; we walk through.

A completely different architectural style here. New wood buildings, maybe 2 years old at most, painted, just about no stone except for some low stone walls here and there. All very uniform in style. Recently-cobbled streets, all a bit *too* clean and tidy, shops with that "brand new mall" look. The streets are all named, with well-painted, clear street names on every corner. We quickly find the alley of interest. They're alphabetically named. This one is 'G'. We find, **Not all that burns is phosphorous**. Wait... Phosphorous...? - Well anyway, we go inside.

Sat within, goggles on, greasy-looking hair pulled back, edges singed, is a middle-aged man. He is mixing up some powders in some kind of grinding bowl. As we enter, he shouts, "Oh my goodness! Shut the door!" so we quickly does. He's got his hand over the bowl. He seems panicked but then calms down. "What do you want?" "Advice, I guess?" "Don't train to be an alchemist!" he laughs. Not quite human - small, but big ears and nose.

We launch into a quick description of the scrapes and hand over the sample Arturo had put in a vial. It's an awkward conversation; he wants to know if we're good for the price, but the price depends on how long the identification takes and he doesn't know how long that'll take until he's done it... Sigh.

Eventually he gives us goggles, tells us not to breathe too much (!) and starts tinkering. Quite quickly, he seems to have figure something out. "That'll be 5gp!" "What is it?" "**Dark steel!**" "What's dark steel?" He thinks for a minute, walks to a shelf, and then cranks strange things on his legs - small metal stilts that telescope up! He lifts up to a high shelf and retrieves a book - Penny takes it off him so he has hands free to lower himself back down again.

"Dark steel is a material that is crafted from special ores that are found in..." - and on goes the reading. Crafted in very high heat, best known for being made by Dwarven smiths or forges powered by the Heat Of The Nine Hells (!). It is used for injuring or blocking access to fiends. It's useful against them. "So if we had a fiend that we wanted to capture, we would build a box out of Dark Steel?" "Yes! It would prevent it from being able to use its powers for anything outside the box. But you'd never do that - it would be *incredibly* expensive. It costs some 10,000 gold per pound!"

Penny gives him the rough dimensions she'd figured out. "Well, perhaps a cage; that would be extremely expensive; but that would still contain a fiend. A dark steel cage would cost many tens of thousands of gold. Not to mention, it would emanate such magic that it would attract unwanted attention. Is there anything else? Would you like to buy some potions?!" "What've you got?" "Potions of healing. 50gp each. I have a potion of fire resistance... 150gp." We can't afford that an persuasion rolls of Penny 8, and Francesc 1-1->0, don't help...!

OK, so, that's that. We pay our 5gp and head away. Since we appear to be in a new shopping area, Francesc thinks she'll look for thieve's tools. We find something - "The Professional's Hobby Kit", it says! 25gp though - Francesc helps Penny haggle. Persuasion 18; we get it down to 20.

Meanwhile, at the Moonstone Mask...

Arturo tells Thorin to go ahead and find a table "so we don't look like we're together". It has an ornate, Chinese-style roof, 2 storeys high, with a small tower attached to one side. The whole building has painted slats, mock Tudor style. Intricate paintings of people dancing are on each slat. There are stained glass windows and a beautiful old sign that's been carved and decorated with gold and silver paint illumination, "Moonstone Mask", with an opalescent masquerade mask motif.

Staff inside all wear half masks. A little creepy. They're all women. Thorin is greeted and is asked if he's a sailor. "No, but I'd like to drink with some!" "Ah, sailors? Back room!" - she takes him to a room in the back behind a curtain. There's another bar there; it's a lot more rowdy; smells of spilled drink; no open flames! All the light is in closed lamps - as if they expect things to be knocked over...

People here look like they've been drinking for *hours*. "No table service in here I'm afraid" says the lady to Thorin and points at the bar, where a muscular-looking, no nonsense short-haired woman stands, wearing her half-mask, with a large staff with shepherd's crook on the end leaning on the bar next to her. As Thorin approaches a couple of people start a brawl; she reaches over with her staff, hooks the initiator by the neck and pulls him away, crashing into a nearby table!

She looks to Thorin - "You're new here. Are you in the right place?!"

"I wondered if there were any sailors from that beautiful Zephyr 3 that I see out in the docks there?" - persuasion 8!

She looks at him. "Nosey one aren't you. There might be. There might not be... I'll tell you who *is* here. Lots of really good customers. Are *you* going to be a good customer?"

"Absolutely. I'm keen to buy them *ALL* a round!"

She reaches over to a rope-pull bell and rings it vigorously, swings a lamp above so it points above Thorin's head and the entire bar roars and applauds. She grabs an armful of steins and starts filling them, putting them up on the bar as they get passed out. Thorin receives hearty back slaps by each person as they collect... Con save! 17. He takes 2 bludgeoning damage.

"Huh. You *are* a good customer" says the barmaid. She kicks something under the bar; a strange bar seat pops out in front of her. She sits and invites Thorin to as well. She leans in and says - "that'll be 16 gold". She draws a big stein for Thorin and puts it up. "Who do you work for?" "Nobody. I'm just a traveller." "Why do you want these people?" "We're just trying to work out what they were carrying..." "We? You don't seem to have any friends in here." "They left me to talk to an alchemist!" "You're adventurers?" "Absolutely".

She rolls her sleeve up, revealing a big - but rather bad - tattoo of four people's faces, one of which looks kind of like her. "Six years I travelled with these people. I considered them family?" - she seems very emotional - "Are they your family?" "Yes!" says Thorin, playing into it. She knocks back a full stein of ale. "The thing is... What I wouldn't do for them..." - she claps him on the back - "You're looking for them over there. You didn't hear it from me." (She points). "Thanks!"

No sign of Arturo.

We're on way back to the Moonstone Mask. D20 luck check. Higher the better. Penny 7, Francesc 6. It's been one of those days!

On our way back, there's a change in the weather. Francesc is good at navigation and knows the way well, but after turning a particular corner she's surprised to find nobody on the street. The air feels cold. A mist is around our feet. It's got cloudy and dark, quite quickly. It's very strange - a moment ago it seems like it was just a regular day in Neverwinter. It's deserted, mist swirling around.

Penny shouts, "Fastest way to busy places? Gotta be the lich!" - following Francesc's lead, we turn around to head directly back to where we just were. Perception: Penny 6, Francesc 18. Penny seems to be surrounded by fog and cannot see Francesc. Penny casts Protection From Evil & Good on herself in the moment; a red glow/outline surrounds her; Francesc, dex 18, manages to grab Penny's hand (and hears her casting, and sees the red glow of the spell - and in fact the protection extends to the both of us).

An oppressive change in the air, like the air around us has become heavy. It's gone dark grey. Then it's not cold; it becomes weirdly warm. There's a skittering kind of sound. Pebbles are rolling from one side of the street to another...? Parting around our feet then closing back up. Ah! Not pebbles. Scarabs! The wave passes. Intense heat from in front. Wisps of black, as if a cartoon depiction of wind, fly at us but are repelled by the red protective aura. A voice in front, as the temperature once again falls to a chill, says - "I know you've seen it. Return it to me and live." There's silence for a moment. "Seen what?" says Penny. Gotta give it a try! There's a loud howl.

Strength saving. Francesc 18, but Penny only 9. Penny starts to get thrown over but Francesc holds her; she's not prone but falls to one knee. Carts on the street are thrown around; then bones fly past us, shattering on something behind us - we look back and it seems as if the back of the city has been ripped open, melting stone, lava, magma... Intelligence saving throw. Francesc 13 knows it's not real but Penny 11 is not sure; Francesc seems to not be bothered; it's probably OK.

Bright daylight. Penny on one knee, Francesc gripping her hand. Some walks up. Touches Francesc. "Are you alright?" There are people all round.

"Note to self", says Penny, "Don't goad the lich."

We tell concerned passers-by that we're fine...

...and run towards the Moonstone Mask. We may have to reprioritise the visit to Helm's Hold!

Nobody outside. We run in. "The two of you look you need a drink!" "Yes" answers Francesc. "Have you seen a dwarf?" "Many dwarves! If you want a dwarf we have them upstairs?" Penny adds, "He's probably looking for sailors" "Ah! He's the back room". But then... Penny 16, Francesc 15 perception; **Arturo is perched on the end of a long bench. His eyes are wide. His knuckles are white. He grips his bag.**

Penny heads over. Spell still active; glowing red. "Are you OK?" He does not respond. A far-away look. He looks like he's mouthing words. Looks like he's frightened but trying to appear brave. Penny tries holding his shoulders to see if the aura transfers or helps him at all; persuasion 15. The aura does expand a little, just briefly, enough; she has a sudden sense of retreating mist. He snaps to. Penny immediately "It wasn't real. Well,  some of it. We had the same thing. Lich, right?" "I don't know! I think so. I need to find out more about this lich. About liches!"

Back with Thorin, about 5 minutes ago. He can see the group of sailors. He heads over. "Hi! How're you doing?!" It isn't hard to make friends after buying a round of drinks.

He asks if they've just got in - yes, a few hours ago; after sunrise. "Ah! What are you guys moving around?" Persuasion - only total 3. Ah. "The usual stuff. Merchant stuff. Trade. Whatever the job is that gets us here - whatever the Captain tells us to do. She's the boss!"

He keeps trying, asking about getting into being on crew and so-on. Deception, adv as they're quite drunk; only 11 at the high point. Not terrible, but they're kind of thinking about helping Thorin out... "You can always talk to the Captain! She doesn't approve of the Mask if you know what I mean - a bit more stuck up! Morals and shit like that... She goes to the Inn. Beached Leviathan. Gets a room there. Same shit, different place really, but she doesn't like mingling with the help..." "Mingling's half the fun!" says Thorin, trying to improve the mood. They don't seem to have a good opinion of the Captain; aloof, secretive about plans; but she does at least look after them - pays, keeps them fed.

They ask what he's good at - random banter - DM D20, "Ha! Well, are you good with demons?!" - the others kind of gloss over it with rapid extra banter, but what was said was said.

Penny, Arturo and Francesc walk in, seeing Thorin with 7 sailors plus one passed out on the floor. He looks like he's getting along OK. We head to the bar, keeping an eye on him. Arturo asks, "We're not staying here, are we?" - he's freaked out. "Not for long". He won't drink. He wants his wits about him. Francesc and Penny definitely need a drink! A stein is 8cp. Penny says, "Something stronger?" - the burly bar lady leans forward; "Stronger? What kind? Firey? Cold? Thick?" - thinking about the recent heat, "Cold!" - the bar lady reaches into an unusual chest and opens it. Frosty air condenses out of it. A chest of cooling! Neat. A frosted bottle is withdrawn. "Money up front - 5sp" - Francesc changes her mind and decides to join in - paying for both. Two small glasses are produced and filled. We're told, "Just give it a second or you'll get freezer burn! Frost Salamander." She pours herself a tiny one, lifts as toast - we clink glasses and drink. She's looking over at Thorin. "Yeah. We're with him" says Penny. "Well I hope he's not your party treasurer...!"

The drink is *strong*. Con save Penny 8, sigh - disadvantage on rolls for the next hour except CHA-based, Francesc 20.

Thorin meanwhile is asking about where they've been. "Up north!" - a first time, apparently, too cold; something very important to pick up there - this attracts a glare from someone else and a hasty change of subject. The drunk guy who tends to give away many secrets is sent to the bar; Thorin waves to us to indicate him and Francesc (perception 18) notices.

He reaches the bar and grumbles. "Giving you a hard time?" but he just orders; "7 of your cheapest please. Make them halves!" Penny says, "Allow me!" and pays (3sp, 5cp). "Oh. You're very kind. I heard that paladins and knights are upstanding citizens of Feyrun. And you! You lady are a paragon of virtue!" - meanwhile he's drunk enough to try and carry 7 steins. Penny assists and as she's doing that, says, "Well, I like to think we all know when things are right or wrong, in our hearts, and would try to do the right thing, or reach out to people like paladins if we think maybe we've strayed." Persuasion 5+6->11 (sigh). He answers "Well, I guess so... A moral code... But aren't we taught what's good and bad? Is it actually innate?" - and so-on. Penny argues back, "Well, you wouldn't usually want your parents to be killed, for example. That's where it starts - feels, I guess, something inside us, as well conditioning too, of course." Another persuasion would be 11 but Francesc helps; 21, hoping to find out what they were carrying on the ship.

Penny buys him another drink; tries: "You're carrying a burden brother - you know I have the power to cleanse of sins; to unburden you. To lift this worry!" "Well there is one thing that's been weighing heavily on my mind... I think our captain is involved in something beyond even her wiles... We had to transport this frightening thing. A frightening thing! Back from Luskan. It was the only thing we brought back; none of us could really sleep; it had such an influence on us... One of us went mad and had to be chained away from us! I don't know, it was just the very presence of the thing on the ship. We had nightmares. We brought it here and we were met by an emissary in this strange cult-like robe; then we were all struck blind! We couldn't see anything until it was gone off the ship. We don't know where it was taken. I hope we don't ever do anything like that again." "What did it look like?" "Hard to tell! All eyes and mouths and tongues - a weird, jelly starfish kind of a thing?! I couldn't look at it for long. It was in a cage. We were told not to go near it. Loaded by mages at the other end; all we had to do was sail the ship here. But everyone was so sleep-deprived, it's a miracle we didn't sink the ship." "What happened to the guy who went mad?" "Well he came right after the thing had gone. It's like he forgot who he was." "What did this... Emissary look like?" "Wore this cloak - beautiful looking - had a cowl over their head - guards - I think it was black and blue maybe? They smelled weird. They smelled like burning. Will I be forgiven? Will I be forgiven, please?" Penny says, "The light of Meliki will shine upon you for your confession here today!" (and heals him, essentially of his drunken damage, for 1hp just so he 'feels' something).

We end up eventually bringing the drinks back. Thorin insight 26; the group has moved past this period of leaking information; the guy we spoke to has offloaded the things on his mind. We should probably move on. He makes his excuses.

Outside, Penny and Francesc compare notes with Arturo, though he's withdrawn and not really engaging; thinking about something. Nonetheless, in so doing, we bring Thorin up to speed. We all know about the lich "problem". Intelligence checks all round, 17 for Francesc the only one that's high enough to notice that when talking, and comparing notes with Arturo - is it what we were doing, who we were with, or what... **The only difference was that Thorin was drunk!**

### 3pm

Francesc sees two options.

* Figure out what the ship's doing at 11:30 that's so urgent she'll drag the whole crew on board (drunken; they've not been told of any such plans in advance).
* This ship brought something *in* and not to the warehouse (the goblins said that they
 *never* get something in) but we got that name, because of a warehouse connection. So it's got something to do with them.
* We could stake out the warehouse at 6.
* There's the ship's captain at the Leviathan.
* There's the issue of us now being stalked by a lich!

We figure maybe get temporary anti-scrying at a temple... Then get some sleep, the warehouse will be there tomorrow for 6pm but the *ship* leaves today... Francesc wants to sleep near the ship, rather than going back to Two Left Feet; Arturo won't stay at the Mask for obvious reasons; Francesc looks for a cheap crashpad room near the docks. It's easy to do - and it only counts as a half-day as we're not sleeping overnight. Three beds; Francesc will meditate - 3sp.

Most of us settle down to rest. Thorin doesn't feel he needs to so much, but it helps to stay in sync with the rest of our (now rather odd!) sleep patterns. Francesc offers to go to the temple for anti-scrying. She only needs a few hours to meditate.

Francesc heads over. **There's a loud booming sound as she starts to head on her way. It's thunder - there is a flash of lightning a distance away, behind the castle; people stop and stare.** As she continues, further up, she can see people at the docks below waving their arms wildly! Rowboats and ferries are rushing across the water *away* from the main dock, in the direction of where the flash of light was. She's only about 10-15 minutes away from the temple - but curiosity gets the better of her. She changes direction towards the disturbance.

There's a ripple - a change in the crowd; a rumour passing through quickly. "What? Oh now!" "Oh my god!" "Someone alert the temple!" "We need healers? Is anyone strong?"

Francesc could as - an elf if she doesn't care too much - jump up and over the crowd! Acrobatics 18. She pushes up a stone wall at one side and sees a clear path where she can jump over, using people who look fairly strong as jumping points, or a cow, a donkey and so-on. The whole Legolas thing!

Then she sees it. An entire wing, one whole tower of the Beached Leviathan is completely demolished. Blown out; a wreck. It's the block of rooms where we met the three brothers. The galleon is on fire; people are ineffectively trying to put it out; bodies on the floor. **Francesc tries to get closer. Two charred bodies. One is clutching a staff that she recognises. Another's face is burned off; just a crow skull, more or less.**

It's horrifying. And there's nothing much Francesc can do.

Perception 19. She sees an extremely distressed-looking man wearing a large brown coat with a hood, knelt over the two bodies, laid side-by-side. Francesc makes her way over to talk. He looks up, tears in his eyes. He doesn't recognise her. "I was just talking to them earlier today... Why would this happen?" "What, where?" "In the room" "In our room?" "Yes!" "You were in our room?" "I was!" "Why?"

Francesc tries to explain. The questions about the cult and the phylactory for - maybe - Velindra Shadowmantle. Then she remembers... Arturo did bring the phylactory ring out in their room, even if only briefly. The ring probably saw the two of them. She confesses this to the third brother.

For a moment, anger flares up. "YOU did this!" - but then he regains control. "I'm - I'm sorry, no... They wouldn't want me to say that..." "*We're* sorry - we had no idea what it was." "This has never happened before. We've never taken sides before in such an open way; always worked in the shadows. You haven't had a run-in with anything strange?" and Francesc talks about the fog vision. Barely an hour ago. He answers, "Then things are escalating very rapidly! You need to get out of town. You need to - you - you need to get that *thing* away! **Before it hurts anyone else**."

He reaches to one of the brothers, towards a nick; bits of charred flesh crumble away, just ash. He grabs an amulet. Pulls it away. Says a few words to it. "Don't tell me if you have it", he say, "but put this around the person who has it; it'll only last a day, but it'll give you a day's head start. Make you impossible to find for 24 hours. Do something significant with your time. Don't let this sacrifice be for nothing. They would have given the enemy nothing! And for that, they were killed."

"Thank you. Is there anything we can do for you? Not now, we've only got 24h! But in future."

"Find us. Find the rest of us. We are at **Forlorn Keep** which is down in the South, in the Sword Mountains that lie between here and Waterdeep."

Helm's Hold is two days South. This Keep is probably further. He gives directions. "Please do not bring danger with you!" he says.

Francesc moves with speed back to our sleeping room! "Guys! Guys! Guys!" - and she tells the tale.

Penny is horrified. We were careless and caused death. She should never have broken into that crypt. Not even a short rest. So, she says, "We have no choice. We have to get to Helm's Hold. We move NOW. We sleep, if we must, on the road. We'll have to push as hard as we can. We'll deal with the consequences later."

We hastily discuss options:

* On foot
* Get horses
* Passage by sea?

We try asking the inn keeper. We're told there's no port there. We could *buy* horses, but that could be expensive... A good riding horse is 100gp *each* and we'd be pushing it for 16 hours; that might just kill the horse. Could we ride for 7, gallop for 1, long rest for 8, then repeat? Too close to 24h.

If we travel incautiously, we go faster than our normal walking speed. But we're at risk of ambush.

"On foot then."

Arturo suggests we split up. "This weighs on my consciousness. I need to investigate  liches. I don't have the ring. I don't want to be anywhere near the ring! That offer the lich made - I don't know if I could resist it again..." - so he might not have received quite the same message we did. "If I stay with you, I don't know if I could stop myself from giving the ring back."

We have no choice but to agree. He's going to head to the Tower District to try and find out as much as he can.

Penny says, "Stay at the Two Left Feet. We'll find you there. If we're not back within 6 days... We're dead. Move on."

He'll follow us out, to make sure we're not being watched; he's a plan to get anyone following off our trail.

At a bridge in town as we're headed away, Arturo asks Francesc to briefly pull the ring out and face Arturo but keep the rest of us hidden! With mage hand. Not too close, else he might be overwhelmed and grab it.

Francesc complies. Arturo gives the performance of his life! Yells and screams at us - "I never wanted any of this! It's all your fault, you've ruined my life. I'm always going to be looking over my shoulder!" and he lets off various strange, broken magic spells. He backs away - **and jumps off the bridge**. Francesc 'freaks out' at this, popping the ring back as if we're then running to him. We *do* run, and at the edge we see him winking, with Feather Fall, then he twists into a bit of mist somehow and lands safely a distance away, then climbing back up a steep hill back into town.

He waves goodbye.

And that's that. We're headed out of Neverwinter scarcely a day after we arrived! We walk quickly along a road that's flanked by cliffs.

It's a hollow feeling in the pit of the stomach. But there's no time for contemplation. We turn about and walk as fast as we can South.

* We cover more than half the distance in 8 hours.
* Constitution checks all round are, frankly, dire:

  - Francesc 11
  - Penny 12
  - Thorin 4!

### Day 8->9 some time after midnight

We're over half way but we *must* stop. We're already exhausted. We need a long rest. But Francesc has the ring; she only needs 4 hours. Thorin could turn into a fast creature like a dire wolf or riding horse.

### Day 9, morning

Perception check with disadvantage all round (incautious travel):

- Francesc 14 (travelling alone after 4 hours)

Francesc travels at 30 speed, a bit slower to let the other two catch up; she reaches a strange bit of forest ahead of the rest of the group, a strange feeling. She pushes on.

- Penny 10
- Thorin 15 (travelling together after 8 hours)

In the first two hours, he wildshapes to a Dire Wolf with Penny riding. Thorin senses a deep unease in the forest around us. There's a creeping malaise of some kind. We push on too. After a couple of hours, we catch up with Francesc and we can continue on foot now. We figure we're at worst about 4-5 hours away. That's too close to the wire - 22-23 hours, plus however long it took us to get our act together and leave Neverwinter. If we continue incautiously, we could cut that down to 3.

We discuss the strange forest. It's telling actually that we've not passed any merchants or trading caravans either. Looming to our right out of the sea is a rocky promontory, with a massive tower atop. 8 storeys or thereabouts. Parts at the top are crumbling and some chunks are missing from the side. The coast is choppy; there's a storm in the air and it's cloudy. Then we hear howling side. Eerie cries and moans.

We ignore it! We *must* press on and risk it.

### Around midday

About 2 1/2 hours in, we can see it. We crest a ridge and ahead in the distance is a massive keep in the far distance, built into the side of the Sword Mountains which now loom up, quite close to the coastline - cliffs to the sea, a bit of a level area from slips or similar, then just pure granite - slabs of rock, jagged plate slabs, rising up dramatically into the mountains.

It's still stormy. Another half hour to get to the keep, and we're very tired - but this bolsters our resolve. A surge of energy - we push on hard. We press on downhill over the ridge.

Perception disadv. all round are very low *except* a lucky 19 from Francesc. Emerging from the mountains is a shadow. It's coming at us! As we run down this slope, whatever this is has "seen" us. Not one! Two. Something launched up, then dive-flies down towards us. We can't tell what it is. Not people. They'll intercept us soon. Francesc shouts a warning.

Francesc nature 12. As they get closer, she recognises that these are monstrosities - large elk-like things, with lion bodies and griffon-like wings. They're likely to be hungry! They tend to attack livestock; horses, cows and so-on. Thorin suggests Pass Without A Trace - Penny looks for a hiding place; 4+2->6, nope! Insight is better, 16+2->18. If a predator is that hungry that it's going for dangerous people rather than livestock, it's not going to just give up if we hide... They'll just wait for us.

That's it then. Francesc is very, very good at range... They're some 480ft away still, but she tries for it - fires at one. Incredible - a hit! No Hunter's Mark at this range, but Favoured Foe and the magic slugs are up for it. Well, a hit, but at this range, it's only 15 damage. One loses balance a bit, but then resumes its approach.

420ft. Fire again. NAT 20. That does 25 damage. This injures the creature so badly that it starts to tumble out of the air. The other seems to swoop down to help it; then they turn and flee! Penny surmises they might have been a mating pair or something. It'd be a shame that they might be starving - except these are monstrosities, not of the natural order, but nature will have its say; they have to take their chances, just like their unfortunate prey!

Now we *run* towards Helm's Hold.

Huge banners 20ft long banners hang down various places at the front of a tall, grey, stone fortress wall in front with a large entrance that has a natural sheer cliff around it turning into the greystone walls, a portcullis and stone bridge. The keep rises 20ft above those walls, then towers rise 20ft above that. It kind of steps back into the slopes of the mountain. The banners have a fisted gauntlet with an eye in the middle which cries tears of gold.

We get close. The portculis is still down. The gate is still closed. Guards are watching us from the top. **This place is not friendly! An air of hostility radiates.**
