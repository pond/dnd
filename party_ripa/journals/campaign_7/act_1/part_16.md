# RIPA: Part 16
## Session 16 (2023-09-12)
### Day 14, Neverwinter, around 1pm

We are at Tamyo's tower, searching for items that will help us in battle, for protection, and in our wider quests.

Francesc is also interested in some protection and had been watching keenly when Arturo was investigating the cloaks of protection and displacement. Tamyo notes that Francesc wears leather armour and recommends an Elven fletcher and leatherworker who could well have some much more interesting options.

Penny remembers to ask about darkvision... There *is* something called a Gem Of Seeing. Very expensive though! Might be worth investigation, just in case... But it requires attunement. Duly noted! Thanks.

We head straight for the fletcher/leatherworker. They are brother and sister - **Llewellen** and **Lliandra**. They're happy to meet another elf, who is interested in the rather more expensive magical items!

* Boots of Elvenkind for stealth; interesting, but not that much of a draw...
* ...and a form of Elven studded leather with magical properties.

The latter catches Francesc's eye. The studs are worked under the leather somehow; almost looks like a strange animal skin. It's well made; form fitting rather than bulky. "The High Armour Of Seeming" is the Elven name. 1600gp; glamoured studded leather, which can change its appearance. They do have a step down from that studded leather with some more basic enchantment, for rather less; under 345gp - and would sell the boots together with this for 550gp, which is a tempting deal.

Arrows Of Walloping are also on offer, 10 for 100gp. Those are interesting, but Francesc figures her style of fighting is less "knock someone over" and more "take someone out".

Arturo and Penny start trying to barter! Persuasion 28. We get both for a flat 500gp. Not bad. 22gp + 5sp for the old leather in exchange. Happy with that, and given we have a bit of funds still for free, Francesc decides to return to Tamyo and get the cheaper protection cloak too. Tamyo's very happy to sell another one, and even keeps the previously discounted 540gp price! Once again the various colours are offered; midnight blue is chosen.

### 3pm

We gather at a tavern.

We recall Querria's research that found too many links between Velindra Shadowmantle - who we think is our problem lich - and the connections with the Thay nations is problematic. This might be significant.

There's also the issue of the seer. Vallin, with portals that reach her via the desert or perhaps near Amn. Querria knows her and was surprised we thought she was evil.

Connecting all, the suspicion of a vast underdark network of tunnels that the incursion monsters might be using to spread across the continent.

We still think Vallin is the right course of action. We need to get close if we can; buying something authentic from Baldur's Gate or Amn would help us teleport there. Arturo decides we should go to the Moonstone Mask, to ask the seasoned adventurers there about it. With 5gp of buying drinks of people later, we find about a market where people from Baldur's Gate sell wares; for Amn, we'd probably want to go to Waterdeep.

Market it is. Down south, into Protector's Enclave, a now-familiar area near the infamous cemetery! "**Flaming Fist's Gifts**" catches our eye. Penny history, 19-1->18, Francesc 19+5->23. The Flaming Fist are protectors of the law but technically a mercenary company, who look after law & order in Baldur's Gate. They're a well-known symbol for people who've been there. We want something cheap ("And recent!" adds Arturo - "perishable goods?"). Francesc investigation 18; **Ulder's Uppercrusts** (!), some kind of crusty bread, crispy, definitely perishable. But is it legitimate...? There's also a big glass cabinet, with a large ceramic mug depicting an elven lady leaning over a rock, playing a small harp (this forming the handle); very Gift Shop. "Authentic commemorative mug from Elfsong Tavern" says a sign. Francesc and Penny don't entirely approve of what is a rather lewd female depiction! Thorin and Arturo think, maybe both... They ask about the bread. "Definitely from Baldur's Gate" we're told, but Thorin insight 26; nope. Awww! Oh well. The mug then. Francesc Perception 18, the bottom of the mug has a seal that mentions Elfsong Tavern and has this year's date.

Hmm. We ask the shopkeeper again. There's some contrition after we saw through the deception about the bread, but he seems legit this time. Franesc and Penny both have very low insight checks so they're sure it's fine! Fortunately, Thorin is rather more perceptive and things like heart rate etc. it is definitely legit. 20gp is requested! Arturo suggests 5gp, and we won't mention the bread deception... Intimidation roll nat 20, so even without the modifier, that's slam-dunk.

### 4:30pm

OK, so, we find an alleyway; Thorin gets the mug, dons the helm...

...pop! Aaaaand - another terrified inn, as we all run through the brief rip in reality. We've appeared next to the flappy saloon doors of a kitchen that open into a *very* busy, smoky, very aromatic smelling tavern. Penny shouts, "Nothing to see here!" - persuasion 23. Thorin is holding out the commemorative mug, expecting ale. We start arguing about what to do next, all the while stood in the doorway and Thorin holding out his mug, until staff lose patience and firmly escort us to one side.

This is a bawdy, rough and tumble tavern. Rather lecherous folk around! Some ladies of the night. Probably some men of the night too. Maybe 12 tables, fairly well lit but smoky. There's space at the bar and one table with 3 stools. Arturo walks up to the bar, buys a drink and asks for an Inn recommendation. "What are we, a directory?! 4 coppers..." Arturo pays "...what kind of an Inn? In this part of town?" "A nice part of town!" says Francesc. "Oh, like an *elf* part of town you mean?" - Penny tries to step in, plays the "fragile ladies" card, persuasion 19+7->26. The barman stops himself in the middle of saying "...the Blushing Merm - oh - I think *you're* after the **Blade And Stars**." He gives directions. It's in "this part of town".

Perception 19. Penny looks around to see if she's being eyeballed. An older, 50s human at a nearby table might be eyeing her up - oh - wait, no, he just has a lazy eye. Penny mutters a curse and thinks to herself, "Wait until they seem me in my armour!".

We exit the tavern and stand, realising we don't really know how to navigate... There's some debate. "Oh, fuck it!" exclaims Penny. "This way!" - survival 17. She's winging it. A footpath leads to a somewhat rotted cobblestone street, wet in places. Some rats scurry across the street. Penny dex save 7, Francesc 14. Francesc dodges a greasy, smoky-smelling 30-something old human reaches for us as if to grab us, drunkenly; Penny is unpleasantly grappled. Capybara face; "Can I help you?!" - incoherent noises. Unarmed strike, tries to shove him away; 20 to hit; but contested athletics is only 13. Drunk person's disadvantage roll is only 2! He falls away and we scurry onwards.

We move into a main street. We're cautious; we know of Baldur's Gate's reputation, if not anything else. Perception - Penny and Francesc notice three young people, maybe a teenage female, with a 20-something woman and man, stumbling around as if drunk - but not. They fall into Thorin; make a show of being "sorry". Penny and Francesc already know what this is about! Thorin dex save 6. Stuff goes everywhere.

Arturo starts grabbing belongings. Francesc casts Web, wanting to say something witty about having sticky fingers... "**Feeling sticky, are we?!**"

Dex 14 save - but all three manage to dodge, very dextrous, obviously not drunk; although the web does encase pretty much all of the fallen objects scattered. Thorin dodges; Arturo gets caught! Penny draws her sword and moves to intimidate. Thorin activates his staff. Francesc notches an arrow. Penny adv. intimidation, 2,17+4->21. "Woah! Woah! Hold on a minute... What is wrong with you people?" they say - then turn and try to flee.

Arturo hasn't seen anything and doesn't know if they took anything. Thorin doesn't want to chance it - he casts L3 Charm Person on all of them - and all are charmed! "Come back here" he says. They turn around. "Oh. Have you fallen over?" they ask, all innocent. Legit belly-laugh from Penny. Thorin asks what they were trying to do. "We were trying to get some medicine for grandma!" is the answer. Penny asks, "What's wrong with grandma?" "He's just got a bad temper". "He" - Thorin figures out - probably a code name for a handler. Thorin asks if they stole anything from us? No. From anyone else? Yes. What? They pull out small trinkets and coins. It's all low-key stuff. 

Penny says, "Take this to grandma. You got this from the four of us. You're finished for the night now. No more medicine" and hands them 10 silver pieces. They can always keep a piece for themselves if they don't want to give them to "grandma"... Thorin adds "If we catch you stealing again we won't be so lenient!" "OK. Bye..." - they wander off.

Other people had gathered and are giving us a wide berth. Then two people in split arrive; they complain about 'the mess' of the web - Francesc dispels the web. "We don't want any trouble" they argue "or the Fist will come for you". Arturo bypasses anything else and just asks where the Blade & Stars is - just up the street!

We continue up the street. The sun is getting low; the light plays across rooftops. It gives a sense of orientation. We seem to be on the Eastern half of the city, as the sun dips down on the other side. We're on a slope that faces East, so now in the shade. We walk towards the Inn. Three storeys; hanging above a simple wooden entrance is a large black shield, very shiny; in the middle is a magical illusion of a slender hand holding a scimitar; the scimitar has stars that dance along it. Two windows frame the door - it seems like a narrow building. They're smudged and dirty; we can see that it's illuminated inside but can't see more.

Penny leads the way in. Arturo flanks the rear - perception is, oh dear, 4. Penny approaches a reception desk in a small hallway. There's a small dining room and fireplace to one side of the hall and some kind of office to the right. Penny asks if there's room for four people in the inn. "But there's only 3 of you!" says the old lady, apparently hard of hearing *and* sight. "Don't worry about that... Four of us..."

There are two rooms for two, near each other. Second floor. Francesc figures 2 nights; this seems to then cause some lengthy calculations until the old lady is apparently rescued by a younger guy who emerges from the office and clarifies. "Each room is 4sp, so 16sp please. Just so you're aware - towels are included; I'm assuming you have your own soap; you can _buy_ food down here".

Penny and Francesc take one room; Francesc looks after the key. Arturo and Thorin take the other, with Arturo holding the key. The rooms are nice enough; clean, well made beds and towels; two chairs, a small table with a small ceramic pot and a slightly sad flower and, at the foot of each bed is a small chest. There's one small window in the far wall.

### 6pm

We know Vallin was referred to by Querria as the "Oracle Of Savras"; Penny religion 3, she does't know what churches here might know anything about that. Thorin 22, though; "The Eye Of Fates", with the symbol of a triangle with an eye in the middle. But what might that relate to? She tends to be worshipped by fortune tellers; people who believe in fate, predetermination, a divine plan; or by people unhappy with their lot in life and want to find a way to rewrite their fate - change their future. We can perhaps ask about those relations at a nearby church as that's about as far as our own knowledge goes.

We wander back out into the dangerous streets; dusk; lower city. Three of us notice that the mood has changed somehow; going back outside, we find an air of uncertainty and expectation on the street. We don't know why. Something exciting? Something bad? We don't know. People seem on edge, one way or another, in the way they behave. They either try to take alleys, ducking out of the way; or walk while very obviously looking around for threats.

Arturo looks to the city silhouette. Down a side street, he looks down to harbour full of boats with lamps now illuminated - maybe 40-something ships - the harbour curving around them. There's a tower in the middle; some kind of lighthouse; then there's a big section of the city that's higher up, behind a tall city wall; the Upper City we presume. He spots some spires and thinks one of them could be a church. We follow, fully on our guard; Arturo casts Light on his staff as there seem to be no street lights.

He could take main roads, but it's a long way around, or take more direct side streets. He opts for the wide main roads.

The main roads are patrolled by guards. There isn't that same feeling of nervous anticipation. There are a few horse-drawn carts. We reach a statue of a man with an outstretched arm as if to hold a sword, yelling; it's chipped, moss covered in places and has a suspicious wet patch along one leg. This isn't a good impression of the city.

Upon reaching the building Arturo saw, he does indeed find a church; humble, quite small and unadorned, but a church all the same. Light can be seen through windows, though the church door is closed. There is a symbol with five stars of various sizes over a crescent. We don't recognise it. At Arturo's behest, Penny tries opening the door; it opens; she goes in.

Inside, a young acolyte sweeps the small pace with rows of pews either side of a small aisle. There's a small of incense. The acolyte seems unsure of themselves, but Penny asks about things anyway - Savras, or religions related to fate/predetermination/etc. They say they'll go get someone and dash off!

A short while later, an older-looking woman arrives. She has brownish-red hair with grey streaks and wears a gauze-y sort of open rope with cleric's vestments underneath. She holds a hanging censer. Penny enquires about the church; "**This is the church of the Lady Of Joy - The Mistress Of Revels - Llira! Do you bring joy?**" Arturo says we can offer good beer; she reaches into her robe and pulls out a mug. We produce our Southside Ales mugs in return.

As we drink, Penny asks about Savras. She knows all about them! THey're really fatalistic; they believe everything has been decided. And you would've thought that people who don't feel like they can change the future would just live in the moment. But no! They don't. They just keep telling you that the 'all-seeing eye sees everything'. Yes, I know, it's part of the name!" She doesn't know about the pilgrim's town, but she knows about the **Amnian Trader's Guild** that goes on the southward road to Amn often. We keep drinking and chatting (since that's all we're likely to get).

The lady presses us more about why we're going there so, with ale flowing, Penny just gives a short version of the story - kidnappings, the "demon" in the boat and so-on. She's concerned. "We're here to try and bring joy to some of the people here - we can't improve their lives directly but we can make each day a bit better. We can keep divine joy alive. But if there is anything we can do directly, we *would* intervene. What you're talking about sounds like a bringer of great *pain*. They're directly opposed to that. Is there anything we can do to help directly?"

Arturo asks about an orphanage. Not quite; they rehome people - place children in homes to bring joy to those who cannot have their own. We remember the children we left with the druids - maybe not all of them had their actual parents found - and we might find more. So that's an option.

Arturo asks, carefully, about whether or not they have any kind of militant arm / combat arm. She pauses; insight indicates that she wants to not lie to us, but she can't really say too much without getting into trouble either. So there probably *is* such an arm, but not officially. So Arturo continues, "...because this is quite dangerous, but if we found people in danger of being kidnapped, we could let you know..."

We also know that there were boats that were going from Neverwinter and through Baldur's Gate. Arturo sketches out the mark we found on one for identification, and we have a Vallin medallion too. We show her; "Ah! Interesting. Let me show you something..." - she fetches a book and shows us a page. It's a passage about Savras. The two symbols are *similar* - but do have slight changes. The Savras symbol has additional stars. So there's a discrepancy; either deliberate, or accidental, but either way it does imply a second group.

Vallin is the Oracle Of Savras, so why are these followers purporting to be related to Vallin bearing a symbol that differs from the religion proper?

As we pour a second pint, the discussion turns to futures. Why is this Oracle so hard to find if they have the power to predict the future, we are asked? Perhaps the Oracle is accurate and knowing futures could cause chaos (Penny thinking that bad; the priestess apparently thinking that possibly good). But none of us actually believe that the future *is* fixed or predetermined, so we don't see how the Oracle could be indeed accurate. That's strange, and worries us a little that perhaps Querria's certainty that these two special portals to visit the Oracle do actually exist. It might all be just part of the pomp and circumstance of a religion.

The church sells potions of healing, it transpires in our wandering conversations. Arturo persuasion 26; Penny 23; she thinks the two of us, for some reason, bring joy (high charisma). She says that if we buy one potion of healing - at only 40gp - she'll throw in one for free. In the end, we actually buy 3, for 80gp (which is quite a bargain!).

### 8pm

We've not drunk too quickly, but some of us are hungry! Con saves; Penny and Arturo are fine, while Francesc and Thorin are hungry. We all agree to return to our Inn to buy food. The dining room only has four tables and it's quite late, and in the end we're the only ones being served - so it's fast, and fresh. 8sp all-round. Crusty bread, river fish in a thick, creamy source, slices of cheese and some kind of mixed salad bowl.

There's talk of who holds the helm. General chatter. We've had beer... Penny remembers something. Arturo and Thorin were a bit quiet in the morning and she noticed; it seems a time to ask. "...So are you OK?"

Arturo just unloads! "I've had someone try to kill me every day. I used to live in this idyllic place and now I'm in caves" - and so-on. Thorin piggy-backs on it, and Penny with insight 9 believes his complaints about dragons and giant spiders and so-on. She trusts both responses. Arturo worries her. She sympathises deeply, "and if you felt it was too dangerous and wanted to go your own way, we'd all understand?" "I want to get the job *done*, I'm just saying it's horrifying!"

Thorin asks about equity sharing. We've never talked about this. How do we split wealth? We've distributed things like finds from the dragon hoard very unevenly, but that's based on utility. We figure that we keep doing whatever is best for us as a group; but if someone wanted to leave, we'd have to liquidate what we could, but anything essential for the party would have to stay - most notably the helm or bag of holding. Certainly any free cash is easy; split four ways, but negotiate if need be to e.g. compensate for magic items exchanged.

A strange conversation but an equitable one.

We figure - bed, early start. So much for infamous Baldur's Gate night life!

Penny casts Alarm on Arturo and Thorin's room. We *don't* want to lose the helm or our bag of holding.

CHA or WIS save options as we sleep. Penny - nat 1! Perhaps our conversation about what we've done, the over-dinner talk, plays into dreams... A strange dream about walking through scenes of her life, but she remembers little else. The other three (made saves) have similar dreams, but at some point, all three have a similar experience - they encounter, in some strange impression of future travels, a library, treasure hoard, hollow of a tree, saved village... A beautiful, crystalline book, quite large. Covers and edging seem to be made of cut crystal. In the middle is a large emerald. Along the spine, small emeralds. The book flips to the last page. Whatever is seen there, it shocks all three enough to wake up.

Penny sleeps on; Francesc thinks it's just a weird dream and tries to go back to sleep. Thorin and Arturo wake up together. Arturo has some weird dreams anyway! He sits up; Thorin sees that he's awake too; "Did you just have a weird dream?" "Yeah. Was there a book in yours?" "Yeah! Really cool... Crystalline. Emeralds." - OK, so that's alarm bells; they've just dreamed about the same thing that neither of them saw before. Nobody's been in the room as the alarm is not triggered; nobody can scry given the amulets; Arturo knows we're trying to see some kind of god who sees the future. And they dreamed of the future. Thorin asks "But can they get past our alarms?" "Can a god get past a Level 1 spell? Probably yeah!" retorts Arturo - with appropriate sarcasm.

They head to Francesc & Penny's room & knock quietly. Penny sleeps on. They exchange information; they wonder if Penny is still dreaming of it? Should they wake her up? Arturo felt the book was dangerous. Thorin just wants to know! They shake Penny awake. "What - What the fuck? Did the alarm go off? What's going on?" "Did you read the book?" "What book?" - Penny has no idea what you're talking about.

Eventually, we elect to return to sleep. We can talk about it more in the morning.



## Day 15

Penny gets up early and tries to figure out the armour. Doing it solo isn't simple but it's worth the time spent learning how the straps interact and how everything fits together. Eventually everything is put together, fitted and tidied. Maybe not perfect, but not bad.

Blue and white edging is painted into the shining metal along specially roughened areas to ensure that the paint sticks. The lines are clean and sharp. The rest of the metal has some kind of treatment (anodisation perhaps, though Penny wouldn't know) which is like a white kind of wash, taking the edge off the shine; it gives it a platinum sort of feel. She wears the cloak from Helm's Hold too. She figures it might give off more of "don't fuck with me vibe". She wants to stand out intentionally in this strange city. The cloak of elvenkind has to be tucked away underneath, but with hood at the ready.

The others are down at breakfast and she joins in. Francesc pays (thanks!). Arturo notices a newspaper, "The Lower City Gazetteer" and picks it up.

* "Is this a second refugee crisis?"
* "Rumours that Alder Ravenguard will head to Elturel at head of diplomatic mission"
* Arturo is searching for "Unknown bad of heroes slay dragon"!
  - Investigation 3
  - So that's a "no"...
  - "This thing's broken" says Arturo, handing the paper to Thorin.
* Thorin searches separately for anything that might be about us
  - Investigation 8
  - Lots of stories about missing wagons...
  - "This thing's broken" says Thorin and hands the paper to Francesc.
* Francesc looks
  - Investigation 21
  - A story about a fantastic elven heroine aided by three helpers killed a dragon (!)
  - No idea how *that* got there.

### 9am

So, the Amnian Trader's Guild... Thorin asks the innkeeper. It's in the Upper City. Penny's feeling confident in her new armour! There are plenty of signs to get us to the gates there. Streets are quite steep. We get to a beautiful gate set into the giant wall that splits the city in two, maybe around 350ft above sea level.

There are guards at the gate. A statue in front that needs to be walked around is a knight in shining armour on horseback, holding a large banner; above the gate itself it says, "Balduran Gate". We just try and walk on through like we own the place.

CHA-based checks; Penny only gets 11 Persuasion, Arturo deception 25, Thorin persuasion 16, Francesc deception only 6. Arturo isn't even really glanced at. Thorin likewise; they give him a brief look but he's a dwarf, in dwarven gear, carrying a bag...

Francesc and Penny are challenged. "What's your business in the Upper City?" "Amnian Trader's Guild, looking for information on the roads to the South" we answer, but before things get worse (!) Arturo intervenes, seeing we've been stopped, turning back and saying that we're "his protection" for the Upper City and given his roll - that's an easy win. We're allowed in.

Totally different vibe. Beautiful, smooth flagstones; wide pavements; wrought iron, black-painted street lamps lining both sides of streets; beautiful old trees along one side. Buildings are made of small, uneven stone built up into clean-lined, well constructed walls. There are gardens around and a big building visible that has a very University-like aspect. We can see a large cathedral from here too.

Penny tries to flag someone down but even with Arturo's help, persuasion 1,5+7->12, doesn't do so well. They seem to think she's selling something! Religion maybe. Penny's now rather less confident in her new armour's persuasive abilities.

Thorin (on passive perception) doesn't see any Flaming Fist people here but *does* spy people who look like *some* kind of city watch, standing and watching in a few places. Traders flow in and out. Francesc asks a trader; "I'm headed there myself! Walk with me. Want to help me?" - Penny helps push the cart. He asks if we're traders; we don't seem to have things to sell... Francesc says we're buying. Are we interested in his jars of oil? Francesc finds that he makes them on his farm; he's trying to sell them to the Amnians. He's not from there, so won't know too much about the villages on the road to that city.

We reach the Guild. The front seems to be plastered over and painted beige with white trim. The roof seems to be edged in gold plate. Inside, a mezzanine room with railed balcony looks out over a double-height main entrance with a beautiful painted scene of riders on horses, cresting over waves, all made out of file mosaic on the ceiling, while the floor has small coloured tiles that make a crazy kaleidoscope of patterns and colours. People here seem to wear gold-embroidered clothing, either in sashes or edging.

A man in a white kaftan, with a geometric pattern on the neckline, approaches us. He has a braided gold chain and small hat. "Good morning!" "Good morning", replies Arturo. He explains a story about looking for small religious villages... And so-on. We're asked if we're looking to join a caravan and Arturo says "yes", to keep things moving along. We're take up some stairs to a seating area with people that look quite different, culturally speaking - dress, skin tones of some darker or lighter olive, a few ethnicities perhaps, but none of them look like people we're used to seeing in the likes of Neverwinter or some of the population we've seen, albeit briefly, here in Baldur's Gate.

Arturo asks a few people, talking about the destination, trying to avoid having to pay for information; mentioning at one point, the Oracle of Savras. At this - persuasion rolls are low; theirs match; they become wary. A sudden change in mood; passive insight of Thorin & Francesc - they close ranks a bit. Their interest becomes more withdrawn. They become rather more polite.

Penny tries to use the armour again - mentions that it is a holy thing; finding out more about other religions; persuasion 13+7. One admits that there is *some* kind of city there; but others are more reserved; it's a mirage! A death trap! Other such reactions. "Only those who truly believe will see the gates emerge out of the haze. That's how only true believers will make it there. None of the caravans will travel that way!" But someone else opines that surely it has been mapped; it's all superstition... If we're headed south and looking for company, they could accompany us along the road. They're headed to Amn. But where we decide to split off is up to us! They can offer protection; they have guards.

Penny taps the sword; "We can offer protection too. When do you leave?" Some leave the next day. Others want to sell more things before they go. One asks how we'll find it... Lots of land between here and Amn. It stretches inland for more than 100 miles. Thorin asks if anyone has *claimed* to be there; sure, but the location is another story. Maybe a library (which Penny was about to suggest!). Or perhaps we *find* someone who has actually been - but Francesc isn't sure we could find anyone trustworthy. Surely, many might claim such a thing, especially if they thought we wanted to buy an object from them (for use with the teleportation helm).

A library here... Or there's Candlekeep. We then get distracted by talking about books to get in. Thorin wants to write a book about the dragon attack; "The Elf That Barely Helped", he calls it. Arturo gets swept up in that and the two settle down to write the book...

Penny and Francesc ask for directions to, then head to the library, the other two in tow, to continue writing the book in the library. Francesc struggles to find anything - the library is *big* (investigation 11). Penny tries asking; persuasion is 23; a librarian assists. "Huh. You know, someone else just recently asked about books on Savras! So I remember where they are. Come, I'll show you." As we walk - "Can you remember what they looked like?" "It was - Hmmm. Elven? No. Human? I can't remember. Either human or elf. Male or female?" (it's a DM History roll and only 6). At least we can find the books!

Deities Of Feyrun; classification: Alignment. True Neutral. 3 books. The other person *was* asking about the "oasis in the desert". Suggestion was to head to Candlekeep... **OK, so someone is ahead of us and looking for the same thing**.

* One book describes rituals, histories. These things were predicted! These came true! Praise be to Savras! That's the tone.

* Another book has a name that catches our eye; the Oracle, **"Valinus"**. *She* - described as an elf - "...has been the most powerful of Savras' oracles for many years". It describes some very clear prophecies that were instrumental in saving a great many lives in DR 1147, ~350 years ago. "The prodigy oracle". She must've been quite young then, given references to surprising abilities "for her age".

* Third book: Holy sites. An ancient city in the Anauroch Desert that is the "holiest of sites for the followers of Savras" - known as the House Of The All-Seeing Eye. There is even a location, with a rough map; but it's in the desert so we recognise pretty much nothing. We make a copy just in case. Other holy sites are far towards the East, beyond the Sea Of Falling Stars; or way down in the South, Tethyr. An old holy city, down in the jungles, dedicated to the worship of Savras. No mention of anything in our neck of the woods, though.

* Perception Penny, dirty 20. **There is a page that has been removed**.

Francesc asks if there are any other copies of the book; not in this library, but perhaps elsewhere. We could maybe check in Candlekeep. Penny points out the missing page, so that she knows! She freaks out though. "I have to take this book out of circulation. This is very bad news!"

Penny's a little dejected. We seem roughly as far away as we were a few hours ago *and* we seem to be losing a race we didn't know we were in!

Thorin and Arturo meanwhile continue working on the book. That's going to take a while. She enquires about other libraries - "A few private libraries. This is the only public access library, but there are some beautiful private libraries in the inner city." Francesc asks which is best! The librarian doesn't know; never been allowed in the estates.

* We might investigate traders who sell the books to the private collectors
* Might have to try and work our way into high society (!)
* Or just head to Candlekeep and try to get in.
