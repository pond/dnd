# RIPA: Part 22
## Session 22 (2023-11-14)
### Day 24 (late)

We have set up camp about an hour away from where we think we need to be to see the oasis of Tashluta. We're out in the desert now; our two griffons have already left, starting back on their long journey towards Candlekeep, evidently eager to leave this strange, dry landscape behind as soon as possible.

At campaign day 18, we figured the *first* Trickster moon was around 7 days later, so that'd be tomorrow night.

Long rest in camp. Watch is set.

* Arturo and Penny watch together, assisting each other with Perception: only 11!
    - Penny barely notices as Arturo says he needs to go to the bathroom
    - He wanders off, as if looking for a rock or something to duck behind
    - There's a sudden flash of light!
    - A big glowing hole is in the ground, blue butterflies flying out of it, with streaks of blue light coming out of it, footprints all around...
    - ...and then the hole shuts!

* Thorin: 25
    - It's becoming a very cold night
    - A wide open plain, leading out to foothills of mountains
    - Rocks scattered around, tufts of grass
    - Looks like a frozen sea in the distance - dunes
    - Distant sound of wolves calling, Thorin thinks?
    - Things fly, silhouetted against the sky; the night is otherwise still

* Francesc (double watch - only needs 4 hours sleep): 18
    - The night passes uneventfully
    - Being out in the open is actually quite comforting - the whole sky is visible
    - Lack of trees is a bit disconcerting
    - The mountains to the south are a bit foreboding - very bare, rocky, craggy, stretch as far as the eye can see...
    - The sun rises in a glory of red-reflected light on mountaintops



### Day 25

No Arturo! Well - we hope he'll turn up again, once he's able. We decide to head to the mountains to get a vantage point, just to get a better feel for the lie of the land. We don't want to just rock up to "the spot" for the oasis, as we have a competitor who might be there already - possibly with guards or similar - and there's very little to hide behind out here, so stealth isn't much of an option!

We know that we must be in a quite specific place to see whatever the portal is. Near a mountain pass, standing facing it to see the oasis. We could get fairly close on the mountains and use them as high ground to look outward, to see if we can see any competitors.

* Francesc, investigation only 9 for the map (fortunately it wasn't on Arturo when he vanished!), gives us a rough idea 
* Thorin as a wolf, perception 26, to see potential landmarks that might help find location - and does do so
* Penny, survival 21, to navigate the way there - so we head in the right direction

The pass between the mountains is on a rise - a strange place for an oasis, which would normally be in a bowl - is, as we get closer, actually apparently a cleft that's been man-made or at least widened. We don't see anyone else around so our curiosity gets the better of us and we get closer. The sides look probably carved, 40ft high, straight up. Very weathered. The carvings are not recent. Francesc recognises some Giant runes. As we get near, we see it's kind of misty here but also dark. Thorin-wolf, perception adv 23; the air in the passage way is not stale - it's not actually an entrance to a cave or a crypt.

Thorin starts walking forward; Penny has Blindvision for a short distance so has some confidence and follows; Francesc too.

Francesc notes as we get into it that while it is 40ft, it's only maybe 20ft wide and that'd be quite tight for a giant. About 12ft up, there's a 5ft tall band that runs horizontally along the length as far as we can see. On both sides of the wall, in the middle, is a depiction of what looks like a very grand city surrounded by farms, windmills and bridges (yet, we're in the desert).

Penny, history 18-1->17; from what she remembers reading, this area was never part of a kingdom. Wrong side of the mountains for Amn, maybe small farms once, but this is quite odd. So she thinks it might be a picture of something from far away - then again, if this *is* supposed to turn into a portal or gateway to somewhere else, that might make a lot of sense.

About 120ft later, we've walked the length of the corridor. There are stairs here, shafts of light coming from above which seem breaking over the top of the mountains. So we're within the mountains - 120ft is definitely not far enough to be through to the other side! - but there are stairs here anyway; a series of straight sections and 90 degree bends. It's all giant sized. It heads down to **a giant city in a massive cavern** - totally in ruins. Rock slides, land slips and more have hit things but, even so, we can see at least around 30 massive structures.

Francesc perception 23, Thorin 25, Penny 6 - the first two notice, off to the right on the side where the stairs descend, are carved another *another* set of steps - human sized - to help navigate the giant steps. Stairs upon stairs. Thorin's easily able to see that these are more recent; 150-200 years maybe; the giant stairs are much older, heavily weathered, thousands of years old.

None of us can really figure out if these have been used recently - survival etc. rolls all end up around 13 - but Thorin tries using his wolf senses. Perception 20; he smells life! Very faint. He doesn't want to go down there as a wolf - figures people might not be friendly if an apparently wild wolf appears! - so he turns back into himself and explains what he's been picking up with his senses lately.

We elect to head down and see what we can see. We try not to be super noisy, but don't want to look like we're sneaking in either!

It takes a few minutes to get down the huge stairs to the 'floor' of the ruined city. There's a lot of dust and rubble around - Penny survival 21 looks for signs of travel - she sees not footprints, but evidence of dust moving around; something's move through here; paw prints. More interestingly, though, where you would *expect* people to walk, it's very unusually flat. Penny tries on hands-and-knees patting at it; it's not an illusion. So this is a bit like pass-without-a-trace. Someone skilled has been along here and they don't want their presence known.

There are smaller buildings here amongst the ruins. Smaller blocks... Human-sized. It has a kind of outpost feel on the giant scale, but it *had* been reoccupied. Thorin looks more closely at the stonework. It's not just human *sized*, it is actually human and about the same age as the stairs. These newer buildings though are also now abandoned, though we don't know when.

Penny suggests following the 'suspiciously flat' dust path. It leads to what would seem to have been a kind of town square, with a well - human-sized - a few small buildings around. At this point, Thorin conjures a bunch of animals to try and scout out the area. **Eight cave badgers appear!** Dark vision and tremor-sense. Thorin orders them to try and find signs of life other than ourselves and report back.

We hang out and wait... Perception Penny nat 20+2, Thorin Nat 20+8 (!), Francesc 19. Light seems to bounce around off the cavern walls a fair bit, so it's quite dim light here but not dark. After a while we realise that this may well have been an ejection cavern from an old volcano; some of the more smooth and shiny surfaces are probably from melt. Moonlight could possibly shine in here in a very full moon, but not a Trickster moon. The giants built their dwellings into walls and added a lot of carvings.

There are various runes and, surprisingly, some large panes of glass set into stone circles that help reflect the sunlight. Francesc can read the Giant language, but the runes are not sentences - they're concepts: **Destiny, choice, freedom, fate**. That kind of thing. As we get our eye into it, we see that these are inscribed onto inset-into-walls temples of sorts.

Seven badgers return after 10-15 minutes. Three smell someone else down here but don't know where, didn't see them, just have a rough idea of direction. The place is generally abandoned apart from lots of birds, a few snakes and lizards, but nothing much else - just a probable humanoid. Thorin knows the 8th badger hasn't died, but we suspect the 8th badger went close to the person anyway and head that way - 7 other badgers in town.

We find the 8th badger. It's half way into a hole it's creating in a building, trying to dig under a wall. It can smell a human in the building... There's a door - it's just that badgers can't open them. Thorin knocks on the door! No reply. "Hello? Anyone in there?"

The door is unlocked; Thorin heads in. He can see evidence of what would've been a place someone would sleep but looks like it hasn't been used for a while. Penny investigation 5. Yes. There was a bed roll here. Francesc investigation 16; there was a chamber pot that was used but it clearly hasn't been used for 20 days or so. That would be about long enough for the last Trickster moon... It's quite spartan though. They didn't take their bed roll, blanket or a few other items including a robe, quite worn, with a hastily hand-drawn map of the area with this location marked and a date of 25 days ago written in a piece of paper in a pocket. The robe isn't entirely dissimilar from one that might be worn at Candlekeep. Another pocket has some feather fragments that imply a quill. We wonder if this person left in a hurry, or perhaps was even grabbed by someone.

Could it be Mayastan? "A couple of weeks" (10 day weeks D&D) could perhaps mean just about enough time, but it's unlikely. Francesc notices via investigation that this person didn't come here the same way we did - the path leads off a different way. Perhaps it was Xemru Thal, in a robe similar to or taken from Candlekeep, since he left a little before Mayastan.

This is the only person the badgers smell. They know the person left up the stairs.

Thorin wants to try throwing magical light at the glass "mirrors" but he needs to get up high to do it. There are giant-sized stairs, but they're too tall. He manages find enough loose earth to mould it magically to help with some of the stairs, and can be repeatedly move them to help travel up. It's slow. Meanwhile, Francesc tries to elegantly backflip up to prove a point - acrobatics 12 - it doesn't quite prove the point and she takes a more conventional approach.

Penny's wisdom tells her that full plate armour is best kept on the ground. She watches disapprovingly!

By about 40ft up, the two can see that these glass sort-of-mirrors are angled and it looks like light can be bounced around. Thorin tries a last of moonfire. He hits. The mirror reflects the blast to another side of the cavern. He repositions and tries again. A different part of the wall. There *should* be a way to make the light bounce from one mirror to another. He has to climb *onto* one of the mirrors to get the right angle.

Penny sees him struggling so decides to climb up (athletics nat 20 + 6!) and instead of classing Bless as she'd intended, instead just hoists Thorin up onto the mirror, where he's able to get his footing and stand properly. He tries again with the moon fire. Attack roll is 15, fortunately below Thorin's own AC - because it bounces around all four mirrors, back to him! He sees that if he positions himself *just right*, he could get the light to bounce continuously...

...it requires some athletics; Penny gets up to help (adv athl) -> 2,18 -> he fires. It works! There's a very strange square of light illuminated, more or less constantly reflecting. There must be magic to these glass mirrors, as the light just doesn't seem to fade. Francesc perception, 22. Thorin, 26. Penny - 6. OK. Well the other two notice a few things!

* With the extra light, more details can be seen. It casts shadows.
* The shadows are exactly there the mirrors are on the opposite side, in such a way that the shadows block out parts of the giant runes carved - and this changes the meaning.
* Francesc reads them - **Destiny, choice, freedom, fate** before - **war, entropy, decay, oblivion** now.

Thorin drops into the temple he's closest too from the mirror he was on. Most of it has collapsed. Penny helps lower him down through a hole in the roof, on a rope; Thorin and Francesc get down easily while Penny stays up on top with the rope (it's dark inside, she won't be much use).

There's a lot of iconography inside. Writing in giant, large offering bowls some 10ft wide, effigies. Everything is covered in rubble and dirt. Thorin religion 18, Francesc 6! Some of the runes are similar to Dwarven, but Thorin also knows of Dwarven religion that there is a pantheon of old gods who are worshipped as the gods of righteousness. It's similar to the Elves and Silune - the goddess of moon and light. The gods here appear to be gods of light, linked to the Dwarven gods in some way, but depicted in a very unusual way. The symbolism is *definitely* of the gods of light, but it seems to be *ruling* over a nation in a manner that looks warlike. As if slavery. Above is drawn an indication of sunlight spreading over everything - so this god is ruling in daylight, but ruling as if a tyrant.

They call up to Penny to try and cover the hole int he roof; nothing changes in the depictions as she uses her shield to cut out any light spilling in from above.

It takes a good half hour to make our way around to another temple. A god of smithing - of creation. This one holds a star, as if harnessing its power. **Starforge?** Again though, this god is ruling as if a tyrant. The same story is seen in the other two temples as we take our time to check them out.

All the gods of light or good as we know them, are depicted as evil here, but in a worshipped way - a worship of strength and might. This tends to imply that these four temples were run by people who were themselves aligned evil?

Eventually the magical reflecting light has finally faded nearly out. It lasted an hour or two. Insight:

* Thorin 24
* Penny 18
* Francesc 8

This place seems to be a statement on choice and perspective! Francesc has always wondered if the gods were false; or at least, their common depictions could be misleading. This ties in. These gods can be seen as bad, or good, depending on perspective. Penny thinks it could also be related to predictions; oracle visions; their interpretation is subject to the interpreter's own choices and perspectives.

It's early afternoon. We convene back down near the stairwell base for some food and a bit of a rest.

Francesc, history, 19. The moon had already started to rise *as* the sun set, so she figures we might not have long to get back up and try to find the right location for the portal - or oasis - or whatever it is we'll see. We head up.

Outside, it's very hot. There's a heat shimmer. Temperatures are approaching 40 degrees; fortunately, Penny's full plate is very reflective. Thorin, perception 25. A solitary figure is approaching on some kind of pack animal. We decide to grasp the nettle - try to meet whoever this is, rather than making assumptions. We retreat into the shade from the entrance. At one point, the figure pauses, seems to be looking our way. Penny waves and beckons! After a *long* pause, the traveller starts again, directly towards us. They get off what we now see is a mule on some lower hills underneath the only tree in sight - more of a tall bush - then the figure approaches on foot.

They're swaddled in loose scarfing - some kind of desert clothing? It doesn't quite look right though, not like pictures we saw in some of the books. They've drawn a scimitar.

Penny hails the traveller, "There is no need for weapons - would you by any chance be Mayastan?"

A female voice says, "What? No!" - and lifts goggles. "What are you - there's not meant to be anybody here. What are you doing here?"

"Waiting for the same thing you are, I'll wager."

"The wolf calls out at night?"

"OK, I lost my wager" says Penny. "Wolf?!" - insight 17+2->19. The question was a code and we didn't know the reply. Penny says, "Whoever it is you were meant to meet, it isn't us."

"Evidently" - she looks at the entranceway and moves further along. Penny travels in roughly the same direction; "My name's Penny Jones. What's your name?" (persuasion 16).

Out of patience, Thorin tries Charm Person. It works! We've got about an hour until someone is very pissed off. "Hi. I'm Thorin. What's your name?" "**Evaene**". "What are you doing out here?" "I'm here to meet someone." "A friend?" "No, it's a job".

"What were you employed to do?" asks Francesc. "A series of random things! I was supposed to report them on success and I'd get paid." "You've already done them?" "Yes!" - and we get a list. The list includes...

* Finding a book in Baldur's Gate and ripping out a few pages (!) - but she threw the pages away
* Breaking into a thieve's den in Waterdeep and releasing a young boy who had been captured
* Go through Beregost (the town near Candlekeep) and steal a couple of rings from an innkeeper's bedroom and plant them in another house
* Break every mirror in a particular town just north of this location; the last town along the road.

"How did you meet them?" asks Throin; "Job just came through the network." "Network? Zhentarim?" asks Penny - "No, hiring network - the Yawning Portal." "Huh?" "You don't know the Yawning Portal?! It's a famous portal in Waterdeep."

We find out that "The Light Reflects In The Morning" is the correct response to whoever they're meeting. Francesc, insight 18; she senses that the kind of job would never involve being told why she's doing what she's doing, and just be paid - 500gp! - when they arrive. Francesc thought she might try and impersonate this individual but asking any questions would immediately raise suspicion.

* We tell her that she's under a Charm spell
* We were the people that the book page removal affected
* We'll pay her gold to *not* reveal our presence when she makes her rendezvous
* But we want to see who she meets.

For the rest of the hour she's almost annoyingly friendly and then...! The realisation dawns. "YOU!" she shouts, pointing a scimitar at Thorin. Penny jumps in - "You remember what we said, though? We'll pay you gold. You get that *and* you still get your 500. You just don't tell them we're here..." - persuasion 24. It's enough. We have to be out of sight though! Francesc even offers to cover her in case they try to attack her rather than give the money away.

We can hide in the shadows of the passageway.

We end up giving away 100gp (!) and some water (we remember we still have the cask of beer in the bag of holding and the well we saw below *might* have water in it too). She seems unreasonably happy about all this; insight 27 from Thorin detects *some* lingering effects of the charm spell but she actually kinda can't believe her luck! She shares some rations. Penny warns her about the follies of sudden wealth and spending wisely.

Francesc suddenly realises that the person she's meeting *might be coming from the other side* of the portal, so we can't hide in the passageway. We hastily search for a good place. Penny, 15+5->20. There's a ledge *above* the entranceway to its right hand, which we could hide on. Francesc, survival 24. By the time Penny finds the ledge, Francesc is already sat on it.

The sun starts to set. We can make out a tiny sliver of the moon. The land is totally dark. The last rays of light leave. There's a strange shimmer, almost like light but not quite, on the mist that is now starting to flow out of the passageway. A soft luminescence of sorts. Evaene heads down, thinking that surely the person she's meeting must be here soon. Francesc decides to creep around stealthily... Thorin helps with Pass Without A Trace; stealth 31. She sees that the tunnel is no longer there. Mist flows out from what appears to be a mirage of an oasis at night, with various palm trees and a huge crystalline-like pond with nothing reflecting over it. A number of shadowy figures are walking through the mist that hovers above the oasis.

The figures walk out onto the ledge in front of where the doorway *was*. They look around and Evaene walks up. She says, "The wolf calls out at night" - the response is "The light reflects in the morning". A man's voice. "It is done?" She answers "Yes, it is done." He says, "Describe what you've done". She describes the four things. He responds, "Have you been discovered?" - Evaene pauses for a moment - then says, "Discovered? No! I managed to do all of those things without being caught." "So you have" he answers. "**And yet you betray us!** But it is of no consequence." He pulls out a bag of gold and hands it to her. "You have plans for a life." "I do". "**You have one year.** Enjoy your life!" "What do you mean?!" "Live your fullest life. For in a year, you will be dead." She is shocked - "But I did everything you asked! I didn't betray you!" "That has nothing to do with it. Know this, your fate is written; this is a *gift* I give to you, so you will not waste any time. Get on your horse. Leave." She walks a little, then turns. "I should never have taken this job, should I!" "You would still have died in a year. Except now you have 500 - perhaps more! - gold." She turns, runs to the mule and rides off.

The figure stands for a moment, then says, "You can come out now!"

We don't know if we're detected (but we have the amulets), if it's pure prediction or maybe if it's something he just always says! Francesc stays hidden; Thorin and Penny descend. He looks surprised. "I expected more." Penny says, "How many more?" He thinks for a minute. "I believe... Four are supposed to approach the oracle. Were you more? Have you lost some members of your family along the way?" Penny says "Are you going to take us to the oracle?" "Well I can take you through to the city. The rest is out of my control." Penny says, "Well then, yes, we are three; a fourth has vanished, a magical effect of some kind, unexpected." He responds, "Curious! She was quite clear that there would be four of you." Penny shrugs and say, "Well, whatever strange magic took him away might bring him back. It's happened before."

Thorin asks if we'll be safe inside. "Well, *I* am not going to cause you harm!" Penny calls for Francesc; "We don't know how long until this thing closes. We'd better move. We're not going to find anything out by standing here!"

Two more people appear - carrying very large brooms! We follow the original person and, behind us, the other two start sweeping away our footprints from the whole area around.

We step through.

It's a mirage! The oasis isn't there at all. We walk through the passageway which quickly become long crystal corridors; roofed in; no sky visible. Easily more than the 120ft we saw before. Francesc asks if the portal opens in the other direction (to leave) at the same time here in this land? When the moon phase is correct? We're told that these ancient passages of the All-Seeing Eye can only be traversed when the "tyrants of the light" are not watching. Francesc asks for clarification. "**All of the greater powers who align themselves with the upper planes - those who have stormed the kingdom and seized control. That is what the oracle seeks to set right!**"

*Behind* the crystal walls of the corridor we can see mists swirling, giving visions of other lands, and/or other times. It's very strange.

"Here it is!" announces our guide suddenly. He puts his hand forward; a doorknob appears; he turns it; this makes an attached door appear; he pushes it open. We step through...

...onto the floor of a grotto - a cave; small; almost a hovel. The guide says, "It is good! These old pathways have not been open for a while, but the last few months we have regained access; it's nice to connect with the outside world once more."

He leads us out of the cave to outside. The moon is still a sliver. The stars have shifted. We appear to be far further North-East of where we were. The air feels different, but still a desert; in fact even more of one, if that makes any sense. The grotto is up on a mountain, kinda similar to where we were before, with steps leading down - only now we see an endless expanse of sand, just barely visible in the very dark night, huge stairs in front of us - not giant depth, human depth, but very wide, leading down the front of a hill towards the sand. In the other direction, another entranceway similar to that we saw in the earlier desert, before it became a portal - columns, inscriptions either side, but human-sized and in a language we don't recognise. A long passageway stretches beyond with almost obsidian walls stretching up 50-60ft.

We're invited to walk the passageway - and there's little else to do. We walk.

It's about 150ft long. On the other side, we can see in the dim night braziers in the distance - a town, spreading out below, very geometric buildings, alien writing that we don't recognise at all. Seeing us studying them, the guide asks if we've ever seen them before. "It's Common!" jokes Francesc. "Funny you should say that - it *is* a form of Common; the most commonly used language during the Netherese empire." We've not heard of that (literally; check through campaign notes finds no references).

The broom holders are behind us now, having caught us up. We go down more of the wide but shallow stairs, and end up in the town. He welcomes us there. "This is the town of **Saiyadar**. Make yourselves at home. I stay at the temple. Over *there* is The Watering Hole" (an Inn). "When you are ready - when you have your fourth member returned - meet me at the temple."

**He points towards an impossible thing**. What we are now close enough to see properly in the dim light of the night, is a truly **huge stone cube - floating - one corner facing the ground**, another corner pointing straight up into the sky.

We get to the inn. People inside and outside are sat at round stone tables on cushions, drinking things mostly held in glass decanters. Sweet scents of smoke from pipes. Low fires.

Here at last!

(End of part 22)
