# RIPA: Part 23
## Session 23 (2023-11-21)
### Day 25 (late)

After the sudden disappearance of Arturo in what we presume was some kind of wild magic event, we found the oasis of Tashluta. We explored the ruins of the ancient city, before being brought through the nearby portal under the dim light of the Trickster Moon and reaching the town of Saiyadar, built long ago by a people known as the Netherese. Here, a short distance away from a large temple behind which looms a bizarre, huge, floating stone cube, we stand in front of an inn. We are in need of shelter, hoping that somehow Arturo's magic is able to get him back to us - because we have been told that the Oracle won't see us until our party has all four of its members present.

"**The Bluewater Inn**".

The inn isn't too far from the weird cube, but is still at the edge of town. There's an overhanging second floor and a flat roof. It has a sort of courtyard/verandah terrace in the front with a central pool. There are stairs up a short way to a front door or stairs to the second floor; Penny goes on the lower storey. Inside there's a long bar along a far wall. Fans spin on the roof, presumably powered by some kind of magic. People sit on cushions around small round tables. Someone at the bar greets us and waves.

We sort rooms first; two rooms for two people; just one night; 1gp each! Thorin pays 2gp. We're led up stairs to a second storey, which has a balcony that looks down into the main inn - above the fans, which are on long poles hanging down from the roof in the full-height inn space. The rooms are off to the other side, looking back out to the courtyard and road. Penny and Francesc share. They're pretty decent rooms all-in (and should be for 1gp!)

Back downstairs, Penny tries to strike up conversation. Persuasion 24. Many people are locals, but three - all sat separately, one talking to locals, the others keeping to themselves - are from other areas. Two have come to find out their fortunes and one to change fate.

As Penny is about to talk to one of the loners, something very strange happens with Thorin's sack; an arm pokes out - blue - then another; then Arturo somehow squeezes out of the impossibly-to-small sack, a bunch of potatoes tumbling out after him! He asks Thorin, almost in a panic, "Am I a potato?!" - and says he *could* talk about what happened to him, but won't.

The room, of course, goes silent.

Penny goes, "My goodness! The potato boy! It's just as *our* prophecy foretold!" - and that does it; everyone just goes back to what they were doing.

Flatbreads, spices and mince arrive. While the others eat, Penny keeps talking to the two loners. They both have the same sort of story. They'd heard about the Cult Of Savras - read about it - hints and clues about what your life is going to be; make better decisions. Feeling lost and unguided. It's a kind of pilgrimage, they say, from people who head North-West (*West*, Penny notes) to find out if there's something greater in store for them. They think that it must have some truth to it, given how hard it is to find these people; it's not freely given information; if it was just something you could wander down the street to hear, it might seem more fake. Interestingly, they're not trying to see the oracle - they're just there to visit the House Of The All Seeing Orb (AKA Eye).

The third guy isn't saying too much; insight 13 overhearing the conversation; nothing much to learn. Penny returns, updates the group and starts to eat.

Arturo after food pokes his head out of a window, looks at the curious cube and asks what it is. Persuasion 19. The cube "is off limits"; it's where the Oracle lives. The House Of The All Seeing Eye is the huge temple in front of it (and surrounding it; the cube's lowest point hovers over a courtyard within the temple).

We discuss what we might ask the Oracle. Arturo is in favour of a very forward approach - just lay down our questions - what's the involvement with the trafficking?

Thorin wants to get a "commemorative tankard" and asks the barman (persuasion 11). "What tacky-ass establishment do you think we are?!" - Arturo tries to pocket a coaster; Sleight Of Hand only 13; the bartender gives Arturo a stern look and shakes his head... Then says, "Look, hmm; why do you want something from this particular café, anyway?" Thorin tries to argue that we just "like to get mementos". The barman looks to Arturo; "did you want a souvenir of Saiyadar or something from *my* café that belongs to me?" - turns out there's a gift shop at the temple.

We'll go in the morning. For now, though, we figure we'll have a good look at the crazy cube; see if there are ways out - escape routes - if we need them. It seems all the main roads lead to this central area. The whole area around the temple is paved like a diamond-shaped plaza, with all buildings set back from it. All are trapezoid or square with flat roofs, maybe 2 storey. The exception is some kind of watchtower, square section but narrow and tall - some 50ft or so - that's much closer. The temple itself is also very different; very square, authoratarian stairs lead up to a building that's all trapezoid walls and windows on a grand scale, corner towers slightly above the 30ft walls between, but with a raised 50ft centre section into which is set a giant main door. The cube hovers behind it.

It's dark; we can't see much (dark - distances greater than darkvision range - perception with disadvantage all round); but Francesc's keen eyes see that the cube seems to be perfectly smooth. There aren't even clear joins in the stonework. We guess that each cube edge might be some 50ft long. There's a small indentation that could be an entrance set on one side, about the right size for a doorway, but perhaps with a corridor extending back. It's up in the air, though! No obvious way to reach it. It's too dark to see if that opening lines up with anything in the temple, but it does seem to be too high up - above the roofline.

We figure that *if* we're going into the cube, we'll be conveyed up to the door somehow - or there's another way in. If we need to run out to escape, Arturo has Feather Fall; we could just jump out. We don't know what we'll find in the courtyard below of course; the main doors are currently closed and the plaza is empty.

We start to head back. Arturo is asked for perception; only 6. We continue. Thorin dex save 9. He trips and falls prone because his foot gets caught in a loose tile! It's only about 3x3" - perfect! We bag it - that'll allow us to teleport back here. No need for the gift shop!

We head to bed; we do watches, but compromised by being in separate rooms. Perception disadv (dark):

* Arturo: 13 (scrapes by, keeps awake) first 2h
* Thorin: 10 (falls asleep) next 2h

* Francesc: 21 (no issues) first 6h
* Penny: 12 last 6h - only person awake by then

...initiative!

* Arturo 21
* Francesc 16
* Thorin 16
* Penny 14

Penny sees a duergar has crept into the room - and unbeknownst to her, an *assassin* is in the other room. Arturo (first in initiative order) wakes up in time to see the assassin moving, to hover over Thorin. He is, of course, very surprised by this! (Rolls perception and doesn't beat the assassin's stealth). The assassin attacks Thorin. Since Thorin is asleep, it's a crit hit; 2d4, then, but plus 8d6 for the stealth. **Total damage is 31!** Con save; even with advantage for poison, it's only 9. He's got resistance at least - takes half of 17, a low roll given that's from 7d6, 8 more. He wakes up, just as a second blade flashes down! This hits too; 5 more damage. No poison. He reacts with Gift Of The Gem Dragon, STR save 16; assassin fails and takes 10 force damage, being pushed away. He's thrown upwards and away, as he was hanging over Thorin, and lands *on* Arturo! Dex save 7; he doesn't roll out of the way and is pinned.

In the other room - Francesc perception 16. She sees the grey-skinned duergar who'd come in via the door! He'd made some noise shutting it, which is how come Penny saw him. Francesc calls out, "What are you doing in our room?!" but she's not holding weapons. Bow and swords are both on the side table. She grabs the swords and attacks, hitting first for 16 damage (with slugs and Favoured Foe); then swings again with the off-hand; crit! 7 damage.

Thorin acts. He calls a giant constrictor snake! It pretty much fills the entire room's floor space, making it very hard to room; initiative 22. Then he wildshapes - into a giant frog.

Penny grabs her sword and runs up to the duergar. She can't flank it, it's in the corner of the room; both attacks miss.

The snake tries to constrict the assassin. It grapples, doing 18 damage (but the assassin reacts to dodge half of that). It rotates around, slithering within the room, to shuffle the assassin off the bed and into the middle of the room. Arturo is no longer pinned. He sees the restrained assassin, surrounded by snake. He considers throwing a Firebolt but the snake is essentially providing cover, so he goes for Mind Whip instead. INT 16 save; the assassin saves, just, sadly; half damage, 4. He shuffles around the room past the snake, gets close to the door and barricades it with an Immovable Rod, in case of other assassins!

The assassin attacks the snake, hitting for 8 damage plus 24 poison damage (it fails its con save). The snake is hurt but still up. The assassin strikes again with the other, non-poison blade, hitting for 4 more damage.

The spy acts. It turns invisible! Penny tries to swing at the area it was, but rolls 1,4 with disadv so - that's a definite no. It attacks Francesc, hitting and doing 18 damage, but that reveals its location. Francesc thinks the previous injuries have nearly killed the duergar, and she wants to take it down but not fatally; she attacks with her sword *hilt*, hitting for a total of 12 damage (bludgeoning plus Favoured Foe). That does the trick. **The duergar falls unconscious**.

Thorin frog tries to bite the assassin, thinking he can grapple it that way then *swallow* the assailant. Despite the snake's restraints, the bite misses its mark.

Penny sees that Francesc has things in hand, runs out of the room to next door, but the room won't open; she tries to barge it; ATHL 24; nope. She shouts to ask the people inside what's going on.

The constrictor snake tries to bite the grappled assassin but can't manage it. Arturo tries Mind Whip but once again, the assassin succeeds, but still takes 3 damage. It's not nothing!

The assassin attacks the snake, hitting again; it's a total of 35 damage - the giant snake vanishes. The second attack of the assassin is aimed at Arturo; but it misses.

Francesc starts tying up the duergar. DEX check - 20 - no issues. It's tied to the bed, very quickly; she grabs her bow and runs out into the corridor.

Thorin frog retries his bite, this time flanking with Arturo - advantage attack - 17; it works! The assassin is effectively grappled by the bite and takes 6 damage.

Penny is about to try and break down the door to the room, when a doorway at the end of the hallway is smashed open first. Of all things, a female knight comes charging in; gleaming but dark blue armour; no shield; she swings a greatsword at Penny. The first attack misses. Second just hits (20 vs AC 21), dealing 12 damage. Perception, 5+2. Insight, also 5+2. The knight seems to be looking for Penny in particular.

Penny says, "Hey, you're stealing my look!". She swings, L2 divine smite; 4d8+4 and it's only 14 damage (2,2,3,3 - very unlikely low damage roll). Second attack, crit fail, because of course it is.

Meanwhile, Arturo sees a face appear in the window of his room, on the outside; then in a puff of smoke, a figure appears in the room. Some kind of warlock appears. It looks at Arturo and speaks what sounds like gibberish, but Arturo needs a WIS save. 15 - *just* succeeds, but actually, +4 from Penny's aura - she's behind a wall but within 10ft - takes half psychic damage; only 2 in this case. Then the warlock tries again! It appears to be the same nonsense but in reverse. Same roll and same outcome, but 6 damage this time.

The warlock seems young and is in very colourful robes - very multicoloured - hankerchiefs seem to be stitched to some parts, bright green hair, pompadour-style; magic leaves trails of sparkles behind; it's connected to the Fey, notes Arturo. He reacts with Gift Of The Gem Dragon. It seems the warlock might succeed but Arturo twists a bit of wild magic (d4 -> 2 -> reduces 15 raw roll by 2); he is pushed away; a whopping 15 damage. He hits the far wall, fails a dex save and ends up prone.

Arturo's time to move, too. Forgetting again about the rod stopping anyone getting in, he tries Mind Whip at a higher level, for both targets. 12 damage potential. Once again the assassin saves; takes 6. The warlock takes the full 12 and is stunned.

The grappled assassin tries to wriggle enough free to try a disadvantaged swing at Arturo - and it works; he just hits. He resists the poison too (very high con save); 7 piercing, 23->11 poison. Its second attack misses.

Francesc tries to shoot past Penny at the new arrival, throwing everything at it. Slugs, Favoured Foe, even Hunter's Mark as a bonus action; 30 to hit! Natural 19. Very much hits. Damage is 19. Second attack misses.

Thorin frog bites again, the target being too large to swallow; chomps down successfully; 3 damage and the grapple remains.

The knight attacks Penny again. Hits for 10; second misses. She shouts then *three names* - "What are you doing in there? Get behind me! Why do you guys always run ahead?!"

Penny attacks; both hit despite the knight's parrying; the first hits for 17, L2 smite again; second attack is with the sword *hilt* as the knight is almost down and seems to be the leader given the prior shouting, so this is another one for capture. The hit works, 8 damage; the knight falls unconscious. Penny shouts to Francesc "we need to tie this one up too" then loudly "OPEN THE F*CKING DOOR!"

Inside the room, the warlock tries to charm Arturo. WIS save would be 12 but +4 for aura, 16, saves; the charm fails. Arturo at long last unclicks the immoveable rod. The door was unlatched by Penny earlier but had hit the rod, so now it swings open a bit more. He can see the room beyond, so he steps sideways a bit, still within the assassin's reach, pulls the door open fully and can see the walkway beyond. He Misty Steps to the opposite side of the inn room.

The assassin goes for the frog again. It gets a hit with its poisoned blade. CON save 17 halves the poison; 21 damage total. He drops out of frog form and carries over a point of damage as Thorin. The assassin swings again, but the second hit misses Thorin in his better-armoured and more agile form.

Francesc can see the warlock through the door. Is it hurt? Perception 15. Mildly injured. She moves the Hunters Mark and takes the -5/+10 Sharpshooter risk on the attack - but the arrow misses as a result. Tries again! 30->25->hits. 34 damage - *not quite* enough; he reacts though and *disappears in a puff of smoke*.

Thorin summons a spirit, L2, and a wolf appears alongside him. He tells it to attack the assassin then once again Wildshapes - this time *he* turns into a giant constrictor. The wolf tries to attack the assassin though it's difficult with the room once again filled by the snake (disadvantage attack, negated by pack tactics though). It doesn't manage to get a hit. The snake, meanwhile, can *feel* the warlock in the room but not figure out where - it's a question of invisibility, not e.g. Misty Step.

Penny can't see into the room, it's full of snake; the knight ahead is untied, so all she can do is tie the knight up.

Arturo tries Mind Whip but for a fourth time in a row the assassin makes the save - a high roll though so nonetheless, 7 points damage taken. He then uses a telekinetic shove, but as a *pull*, which drags the assassin towards the door. Penny is in range for the attack - but the assassin is in range too, and tries attacking her. The snake disadvantage, however, means there are two misses; both disadv rolls nat 1!

Francesc tries to shoot the assassin at point-blank range (disadv) and does get the hit; 10 damage. Second attack misses.

Thorin snake now uses blindsight to spot the warlock. There's disadvantage from the cramped condition, but his constriction attempt succeeds; he takes the warlock down to unconscious. Just the assassin left. We've also got a lot of prisoners now and it's not clear what we'll do with them all...

...The land spirit tries to attack the assassin again; 19 to hit; that does it, for 11 damage.

Penny sees that the assassin might need a couple of hits to bring unconscious - since we seem to be taking prisoners today! - but her first hit doesn't make contact. The second hilt attempt does and luckily the d4+4->8 max roll is just enough. The assassin is unconscious too.

We tie everyone.

* Female elven assassin
* Female knight in full plate
* Duergar
* Fey warlock

...well that sounds very like us! Various insight & persuasion rolls; as they wake up, we get information. They were travelling through Bereghost outside Candlekeep, all the way from the greypeak mountains and into the desert *on foot*. They were told they were part of a prophecy - a male dwarf, male fey spellcaster/being of magic, a female elven marksman and a female worshipper of the gods - had a destiny, to come here. But only one group had this destiny. They heard that we'd arrived once we came in, so figured they needed to eliminate us. They wanted to incapacitate us they *claim* (which Francesc does not believe, given the poison daggers) - thinking they'd get to the oracle first (expecting riches and glory).

(Meanwhile, Arturo is trying to convince the bar owner that *these* people summoned the huge snakes that've caused quite a bit of damage!)

They have one of the code sheet lists, like us. That's just descriptions. We saw the book, though, with our actual names; but we don't have a copy of it. Arturo with Penny assisting with bless - persuasion low roll despite advantage, only 18.

Francesc 24, it turns out that the duergar and assassin are quite chaotic. The *knight* wanted to knock us out and convince us to leave, but the other two had a better idea and decided to try to kill us. That's why they were in the room first.

Arturo tries to convince the knight to 'testify' against the other two when guards arrive, else she'll be party to attempted murder. That persuasion 18 roll beats a DM roll for her resistance to the idea; "I had my misgivings about this for a while. Things were not going the way I expected. We've had a number of disagreements but this has really come to a head. I didn't know *you* were going to use poison; no prophecy is worth me losing my soul over. I'm out." She would clearly leave but is tied; Penny gives her 5 points healing and unties. She leaves. Thorin protests - he thinks guards should stop her. But Penny decides that this knight deserves a second chance.

Guards are arriving now. The assassin is being recalcitrant; the duergar silent; but the warlock has had a definite change of heart. He seems more aligned with the knight. "Well. This is all ruined. You guys beat us..." - and he disappears in a puff of smoke. Penny can't see him with blindsight; so he seems to have misty stepped away. Penny spots a faint outline of a blue door in the air outside the room - looks like a dimension door on top.

We hand the duegar and assassin over to the guards (temple guards, hired muscle it seems; I guess some pilgrims don't like their prophecies!).

The guards offer to hold watch over the rest of the night. This lets us finish our sleep after an extra hour or two.
