# RIPA: Part 15
## Session 15 (2023-09-05)
### Day 12, approaching 1pm

The young black dragon Klaugmyathar is slain. We have located its hoard, in caverns lower down previously obscured by poisonous clouds that are now dissipating. There's a mount with a boggy area and atop it, the hoard. Further investigation rolls:

* Penny 1-1 => 0 (third Natural One in a row)
* Thorin 7
* Arturo low, even with Guidance 9
* Francesc with Guidance nat 1+8, D4 4 -> 13.

Penny is distracted by trying to figure out how to lug the heavy dragon head around and seeing how very beaten up Arturo is. Once we all realise that, Thorin groups us together and casts Healing Spirit. That grants 1d6 -> 1 (sigh) +5, 6hp each on the first pulse of healing... But he can hold this spell for a few minute, which is very powerful and we all end up at full health!

It looks perilous with deeper water and there's a possibility of wards or traps, so Penny casts Detect Magic and quickly finds:

* Dust Of Disappearance
* Circlet Of Blasting
* Immovable Rod
* Eversmoking Bottle
* **A Helm of Teleportation**

Thorin checks with his staff and the water isn't acidic. The marshy water around is almost chest-deep on Penny so she puts down her pack and the dragon head on the edge and helps carry Thorin across.

We look closer. Perception:

* 220pp (2200gp!) is found by Francesc, shiny and easily spotted! Thorin stows it away.
* Arturo 21 with Guidance
* Penny 19 with Guidance
* Thorin 17

So:

* Arturo searches for gems. 6d6->19 - 19 gems. D100->31. 5 are small semi-precious gems worth maybe 10gp each. D100->70. The next 5, Arturo estimates are worth 50gp each. D100->65. Another 5 similar to the first few. D100->39 and D100->16. Two more worth 50gp, two more with 10gp. 12 worth 50, 7 worth 10 - some 670gp total!

* Penny looks for art objects. 3D6->11. D100->7, 3 art objects worth 25gp each. Small carvings, dragon themed. D100->81, 3 art objects worth 750gp each. Precious metals, gems; they seem old, artefacts of another time almost. Treasures for sure. D100->75, 3 more, worth 250gp each. Old brass urns or large pots, a similar age, drawings and paintings across them of a battle between giants and dragons. D100->96. The last two finds are pretty special; two tomes. Very old again, not art objects so much as treasures. Huge books, spared from the marsh by being higher up in the hoard. They're massive - some 3ft by 2ft, and maybe 1/2 a foot thick! Metal bindings, illustration gems; writing large and illuminated in a runic language inside. Francesc sees that it's written in Giant. Well, that explains the large writing! 750gp each.

* Thorin D8->4, 4 rolls of D100 -> 67 - a large map of this region before it turned into the Mare Of Dead Men. It shows the lair location in relation to villages and other landmarks now long since completely gone. Would be useful if we ever have to investigate this area for things that people might not know exist - towers, forts and more, entrances to things underground. D100 -> 28. A large drum with an unusual skin that (nature 14) he recognises is giant skin! D100 -> 9. Ten throw pillows, intricately embroidered with dragons! D100 -> 89. As he removes the pillows, he finds a small shrine... Its placement indicates that this might have been how the hoard started, or what it was built around. A brazier, bits of incense that have been burned and a huge statue made of bronze of a five-headed dragon - Tiamat. In front of it, there is a collection of offerings spill out... 1600 silver pieces, 2200 copper.

### 2pm

It takes a while to brush things down and fill up the bag of holding. After a while, we're all done. Looks like it's time to head back to Helm's Hold? Penny is noticing that the dragon's head, roped onto the back of her backpack, is already starting smell.

Thorin checks the smaller upper 'treasure chamber' on the way out - but it's empty. It was just another illusion.

It takes a while to climb up the rope we left, which is still there. Chewy the frog leads us back to Leilon, which takes about 2.5 hours. With the proof that the dragon is dead, the bow is now permanently bequeathed to Francesc by Krstjan the druid. We are grateful to Chewy and return him to Krstjan.

We're slowing down, but start on the trek back to Helm's Hold. We discuss our magic items and wonder who should use our strange magical artefacts. Thorin is a bit conflicted - as a druid he wants to avoid metal, but he thinks it'd make a lot of sense to attune to the helm as he hasn't got other stuff he's needing for that and he's carrying a lot of our gold so (on Arturo's suggestion) could be loaded up with stuff for trade and just teleport it somewhere, if we ever needed that! Arturo could wear it too, but for now Thorin takes it. It's always possible to swap later!

Arturo likes the immovable rod and dust of disappearance, but he might hand it over to Francesc. The circlet of blasting is handed to Penny out what appears to be party sympathy for her lack of ranged attacks! We think that in-the-melee fighters might be able to use the smoke bottle as a last gasp ditch to escape, which means Penny or Thorin - but Thorin might be wildshaped without pockets or hands, so Penny gets that too, at least for now.

### 5:30pm

We reach Helm's Hold. The sun is low, with maybe an hour left before it dips below the horizon. People are running across the parapets excited - the dragon head strapped to the backpack is hardly subtle! The portcullis is raised, people are fetching torches to try and see; some run out of the moat bridge and we're soon surrounded.

We're escorted in the crowd to Helm's Hold. People everywhere, Querria present, Javen too; the priests and many others. We gather Querria and Javen; Penny says, "For what it's worth, it's done." "I can scarcely believe it. Well, this removes the pressure to move deeper and deeper into the excavations. If you're interested, we can show you what we found?" Javen is bullish - "I always knew this would be the way the day would turn out! I had faith..." - etc. Querria more quietly thanks and congratulates us. "I really appreciate that you went ahead and did this even though we couldn't support you and I hope, now that we have a bit of a reprieve from the danger, that we might - well - I might maybe explain to you why we did not rush in. Perhaps we will bring you into the fold; then you might understand."

Tertiary quest inbound? Penny says that we're very interested - but not tonight. We're tired and owe a man in the hills a visit!

We head up, past the inner keep; we're going to visit Durum. Because of all the excitement, we unexpectedly end up with a contingent of following townsfolk. We get to Durum's grotto, but it's getting dark. Penny call out, "Durum - we have a gift for you!"

There are the now-familiar noises of things being shuffled around and kicked out. "What? Are you back already? Or have you not gone?" "Oh we're back!" "How did we escape?"

Arturo casts Light over us all. Francesc approaches, dragon eye extended in her hand.

"That's not - that's not possible! You made good on your promise! Klaug is dead?! I can't believe it..." - Penny turns around to better show the head strapped to her backpack.

There's a conflict on his face... But then years of weariness, age, guilt, self-doubt seem to melt away. Penny approaches and presents, hilt-first, his dragon-slaying sword. He asks about the story. Penny says that it was, indeed, of great use. He'd ever had a chance to use "her" - the sword - before. He never fought it. So now, the blade has actually connected.

(Other spectators are whispering - rumours - Durum's old sword helped kill the dragon?!)

To our surprise, he follows us out a bit. "Are you celebrating?" he asks. Francesc says, "Why not join us in the tavern? Maybe a bath first..." - he dives back into his cave and comes out in *slightly* cleaner clothes.

When we get back down into town we find it's not the tavern - the main square has a big bonfire, some young kids chanting "Roast the head! Roast the head!" - and it's all open air. We look at how the townsfolk are viewing Durum. They're seeing him differently - they never believed his sword was special, or perhaps that he even got that close - we confirm the stories. There's a shift of opinion and he's welcomed.

As the celebrations continue, Thorin wants to talk to Javen to ask about their excavation discoveries. Querria had spoken of them but Thorin's after an alternative opinion! Persuasion: 6, but Arturo joins in and helps - 24. Insight thereafter is 26... At which Thorin realises that Javen doesn't know much at all about the discoveries. He *does* have some idea of the purpose of it. He starts talking a bit, but realises he shouldn't steal Querria's thunder! "I might leave it to her to explain what it is that we're doing - what we fear, what we're afraid is going to happen. The dragon was - well I don't want to say it was a distraction! - but it was, well not less problematic, but it had a solution; move people into the mountain; this other thing, we don't have a solution for. We're just involved in it."

He adds, though, "There's no expectation for you to return the amulets. We owe you that much and what would we use them for, anyway?"

After that - well, we just party. We tell the stories. Each of us, as we drink more, exaggerates a bit more - each of us was the star of the show. Penny does approach Thorin; "That bear was brief - but it was a good move, or we wouldn't be talking to you right now." "Yeah, that was rough!"

The Aasimar, Carant, makes it over. "Well done. I recall maybe conversation of maybe sharing the spoils with the Order? What were you thinking would be the Order's share?" (He's kind of trying it on).

Penny counters with, "What does the Order value? We have some currency of course, gems, art items. And the head itself, which has, for people wit the right skill, a wealth of opportunity in its teeth alone, if not more."

Arturo meanwhile starts a long bluster about how we only took a small amount, plenty more in the hoard if they go to it; Thorin joins in; Snark roll (!) - persuasion - 26. He looks almost ashamed of his presumption and retreats, but graciously; Penny does though say that we don't have skills to deal with the head. Is anyone here skilled? The "Roast the head!" call starts back up, and that's enough to persuade Carant that it should be dealt with properly. The teeth alone should be useful, if nothing else. Well - at least that's taken care of.

Arturo tries to see if anyone's keen to get back to the Mere and skin the dragon - the scales could be useful. But people are too drunk; maybe he'll try again tomorrow.

### 10pm

An opportunity arises over the next few minutes for us to slip away from the adoring, but very much more drunk crowd; we make it back to the inn. "You'll always have a room here whenever you want!" we're told.

Finally - and feeling Inspired - we can rest!



## Day 13 (wrapping up at Helm's Hold)

Arturo makes enquiries about the dragon scales. He's told that their hunters and leatherworkers could do it, but they'd want protection going back to the Mere. We figure it's a good idea; Thorin reminds us about the smaller treasure room, too.

We get to Leilon and see if Krstjan will come along with us. Penny helps Arturo try to persuade him. Arturo persuasion 22. He's a little reluctant; they've not listened to him before, so he decides to come along.

Penny survival 22. She knows the way and remembers it from Chewy's instructions; so she leads. There are already quite a few changes - less "shifty-eyed" animals; less boggy areas, fewer clouds and mist, less evidence of disease, once we're close by. We discuss this and we're told by Krstjan that a lair's magic is tied to how much treasure it has and, after having taken quite a bit, it's pretty much faded. This isn't even a lair anymore.

We lower ourselves down. We do encounter some Lizardfolk; they're sort of bought-in; but their stuff is here; but Krstjan says they can have their own area, their own outdoors, a safer space. They might investigate and look into it. OK - that's on them. We at least get permission properly this time to get through their territory.

The dragon is already hugely bloated and smells bad! That didn't take long. We caution the hunters and leatherworkers; they in turn caution us! They want help; yanking out the scales is difficult and takes strength. To then avoid puncturing the skin, it's more about dexterity - sleight of hand. We need a nature check first to assess overall; adv check Francesc; 20. She can keep us out of danger if she thinks the dragon might burst!

D8s all round - 7, 4, 3; average is just under 5. It takes about 3 hours for us to get this done; we're all very tired and it's almost 4 hours to get back!

* We gather 40lb of good-quality scales, enough for a full scale armour set - *if* we can find someone who knows how to make it! It takes a huge amount of skill; we're told that we'll need a big city. **Neverwinter is famous for craftsmen...**

### 7pm

A good day. We get back around 7pm, just after dark. Now we need to pay the two hunters, leatherworker and their assistance. A day of work for four people. Arturo is considering paying in gold, but they say they're also really interested in keeping a scale! We give away four scales - still enough for armour - and 2.5gp each, 10gp total.

Dinner time at the tavern! Penny realises we never went to see Querria. Let it slip a day, or go after dinner? We decide to go after. 2sp each, no drink this time.

### 8:30pm

We head up to the cathedral. It's fully illuminated and open; we search for Querria. Penny asks Arturo to back her up, but leads the conversation since they've known her longer.

Querria is at the mezzanine standing over the map, with Javen. We explain that we're late as we decided to harvest the dragon. "Waste not want not!" says Querria. "Let's cut to the chase. We have had our hands full. There are things that we really want to focus on - there have been signs - a lot of signs; across this time, over the last few months, we've felt incursions. And our Order is particularly wary of incursions. We consider it our sacred duty under Helm to be the Watchers, to make sure that our plane does not fall under the influence or prey to machinations of extra-planar influences who care not for *anything* that happens to the lives and livelihoods of those that live here. They see us as a transit point, battleground or pawn to be traded in their greater cosmic battles."

This gets Penny's attention. "I know what you mean" she answers, "but I don't know what particular threat you're describing."

"We've been trying to understand that ourselves! And I admit I had taken my eye off the ball, so focused on trying to figure this out that we didn't deal with the dragon problem and it's a point of particular shame to realise it had got out of hand so much. So I thank you. The Order Of The Guilded Eye gives you our official thanks." Arturo asks for a letter to confirm so Querria writes and hands him one!

She continues. "We've been aware of incursions of all kinds for a very long time. Neverwinter has been the site of a number of - well we call them incursions, but incursion *events* - people from other planes who decide to play political games, long-term games. But what we've felt over the last few months was much stronger. It sent ripples and echoes through the Weave; something very powerfully magical that is not of this plane, that doesn't belong here, that doesn't gel or meld with the nature of our Weave has been living on this plane. When you described the lich you described, we did some research; the lich probably is *not* from another plane. But we still think it's connected. We believe the strange activity increases is tied to these incursions. We've sent people to speak to seers - Druids, Clerics, anyone with a sense of the well-being of the world. The portents are not good, of course."

Penny describes the strange demon creature that had been transported in the ship and repeats our story about Vallin and the other things we've seen. Connected?

Querria apologises for seeming aloof - she didn't want to play her hand with people she didn't know she could trust. She does now. "We have researched Vallin. We believe we know who this is, but we are **very surprised that you speak of this Vallin as an agent of evil - for that is not our experience of her!** We have spoken to her before; we can tell you where to find her if you're interested in tracking her down?"

For sure!

"One is out far to the East - into the desert. There is a portal there that will take you to her. She is a seer of Savras. She is often referred to as the Oracle Of Savras. But there is another entrance, far to the South - easier to get to perhaps - a Prophet's Outpost. A town used for pilgrimages, south of Baldur's Gate, just a little bit further than Candlekeep but before the kingdom of Amn. There's an oasis with a library town which holds a temple to the All-Seeing Eye with a portal that takes you to her. She doesn't exist 'here' - she exists somewhere that her visions aren't clouded by the mundane things of everyday life."

There's more. "I don't know that this is the biggest, most pressing thing! This lich that you speak of - the reason we're quite confident that they're not from another plane is because we believe that this particular lich - especially if you think that you think they're female - was tied to Neverwinter. We think she has connections to another force; another pretty evil force, that's seeped into the Sword Coast of late. I can't really tell you more about this as we've only just covered it more ourselves. **I urge you to go to Waterdeep. There's a recent embassy, since the war, for this thoroughly evil force - I don't understand how it happened or why it was permitted - but this lich has ties to the Thay.** We think this all has something to do with the rip, this tear in the weave - this incursion that we feel. If you would be happy to help us out, we would be glad to have you."

She mentions that this tear, this incursion seems to be widespread. It's not local to here; it's probably continent-wide. She's sure somehow all this is connected - the lich, this Vallin character; perhaps they're at odds with each other. How did we get stuck in the middle? That's all she's discovered. "I'm sorry it's not more but it's a little bit of a lead."

The incursions we learn are extra-planar, lower planes, bleeding through. There are some reports that they might be coming from an entirely alien realm, nothing like ours. "Have there been abductions? Murders? What's the issue?" asks Arturo. "Husks let behind. Strange stories of psychic screaming, strange tentacles creeping round corners, people left blank and catatonic. They're not happening on the Sword Coast yet, but are on the fringes of what we consider our civilisation. Scholars have gone to Candlekeep to try and discover more. We have even encountered Drow who were left catatonic! It doesn't just affect surface-dwellers. The Dwarves of the old kingdom must have their own experiences. I'd hate to suggest you speak to the Drow but if you were able to you might be able to find out more. There's definitely things happening very deep underground. We think there are very deep passageways that lead from where they are arriving, up to our part of the world; if they travelled over land they'd be too visible. That's the real reason we're digging into the mountains - this is an ancient kingdom - we think it may have connections to these deep tunnels."

She asks if we want to see what they've found. Sure!

We're led behind the cathedral and into the excavation site. We go about 200ft into a tunnel into the mountain - definitely Dwarven architecture - and arrive at a pulley lift to a shaft that goes deep into the mountain. Arturo casts Light and Feather Fall and just jumps in! Querria is surprised; meanwhile, we're loading onto the lift and starting our way down.

Arturo is far head. Perception 20, he's fallen 300ft as he realises that this is a *deep* shaft and he hasn't much choice but to keep falling to its base. Above the lift is slowly descending now. There's soft glowing deeper down, a bluish-purple bioluminescence. The shaft opens up into a huge cavern, and he looks down onto an almost alien landscape. 100ft tall at least, stalactites, stalagmites, very uneven topology around the base. He tries to steer his fall to land on a higher bit of ground!

Flappy-winged things fly. Bats perhaps; he can't quite see. Things beyond his dark vision sound like they shuffle around on the walls. His curiosity overcomes fear from the unknown things around; some of the guano on the floor is bat, and he collects that for Fireball. But *some* - looks like it comes from something the size of a cow, but from very high up!...

...meanwhile on the lift, Querria explains. The cavern must belong to a network that connect through to the Underdark. A torch is list.

Arturo perception 19 for hearing - fluttering of a dozen pairs of wings; strange high pitched clicking sounds; scratching; he can't see it. Nothing seems to be approaching though! He's a very obvious source of light in a cavern otherwise only lit by faint bioluminescence. Arturo moves Light onto a stone and throws it a short way to see in that direction. He's in the dark but he can see well beyond. Something with big, white milky - probably sightless - eyes and a beak; stretched, leathery wings that end in claws; pterodactyl-like, but not that large. It scrambles away from the sound, jumps up and takes flight, going out of visibility.

At this point, the lift has reached the cavern. Querria tells us to give our eyes time to adjust as the cavern is very large. "Don't be afraid! There are creatures in here but they've generally left us alone as long as we don't antagonise them. As far as we know, this cavern seems to be safe even though it does connect through to the Underdark."

We can see the bright spot from Arturo's pebble but we don't see him at all at first, but as we get lower, Thorin's able to see him. The lift touches the ground and the group is reunited.

"This is where we were going to bring everyone" says Querria. Penny asks if that would be wise - safe enough *now*, but with light and people and noise it might attract all sorts of things. Seems to be a moot point though.

They're trying to find their way to get to the greater network; they've not found that yet. So, their theory about the incursion creatures using that method of travel is still just a theory. The trouble is, the area is so vast and so confusing - it's much bigger than they expected and very hard to navigate around. Even so, they think that pretty much all major cities are connected one way or another, so it could be done via the Underdark - but you'd need to deal with the Drow "threat". That's what makes it interesting to know that the Drow themselves seemed affected. But it *could* be different clans of Drow, perhaps. They aren't sure.

Arturo isn't too convinced necessarily that this could be extraplanar, tho Penny thinks it all adds up and (via her Oath) her "spidey sense" is tingling and it does feel on point. Arturo is right to be sceptical given that this Order is specifically focused on extraplanar incursions so maybe they tend to blame everything on that, but they *can* detect them. So there has definitely a huge incursion but the connection between that and these events is much less clear.

Thorin mentions the gem dragon. Extraplanar. A couple of weeks ago, so too recent, but it seems an unlikely coincidence. He also spends a while looking around in the stones. Over half an hour, he investigates, perception 20; meanwhile Arturo casts Spider Climb and starts climbing away! He figures it's another way to explore at least.

There is very weathered, but unmistakeable evidence of Dwarven activity here. The tunnels above and the shaft down must've been something *they* used and they did explore here. There are runes, carvings, very worn; things might even have been built, but weathered away. Order of 700 years ago, if not longer. There are likely to be tunnels built further - that's just what Dwarves do.

Arturo on the walls finds evidence of long-gone suspended walkways. He encounters are large salamander, which he carefully moves around to avoid annoying it! It's got quite a domed ceiling. Lots of smoothing from water.

It's a forgotten kingdom, long abandoned.

We regather.

* Thay embassy in Waterdeep - we don't know enough to even know what questions to ask.
* Underdark - vast and we lack equipment and skills to navigate it right now.
* Seer - our Vallin may be different, e.g. an impostor or even an entirely different person, or could somehow be this same individual - either way, we can ask the seer to find out!

Looks like the Seer, then, but via Neverwinter. We can trade our stuff, get the armour made and plan out how to get to this portal town. The Helm can teleport us, but we need some focus for the destination.

We're too tired for that now. Back to the tavern, long rest... But first...

* Thorin: Wisdom saving throw - 2+8->10 - inspiration blown - 16. For a moment Thorin is tempted by the *huge* amount of wealth he holds. And he has an extremely rare helm that he can teleport away with at a moment's notice! He's not on that list of names, he thinks, that we found; why is he even *involved* in this? He can just carry on his way... ...but then he realises that's not who he is. That part of him is why he *left* the citadel. The xenophobic, greedy selfishness that he saw as a young dwarf. Jokingly bantered around as the establishment culture of the area, but a real thing all the same. He was going to do something else. He was going to see the world. And now maybe he'll be able to help save it.

* Arturo: Arcana 14. As he's about to jump into bed, he notices small motes of light floating around him. They're a colour that reminds him of the fey wild. They float towards the window and out into the night, whispering his name... "**Arturo. Be careful what path you take. There are many that will lead somewhere without a good end. You are keeping dangerous company! We fear for your safety...**" - but then different voices overlap, disagreeing with each other. This is the first time in a long time he's heard the voices this clearly and loudly.

* Penny: As she comes out of the inn bathroom she sees someone in a hooded cowl at the top of the stairs. The person looks like they're trying to hide from everyone else... She pulls back the hood. **It's Querria!** "Is there somewhere private we can talk?" We find an empty room. "I sense in you much of what we also hold to be sacred. I sense you too are a Watcher. That you guard this realm from others. Am I mistaken?" "You are not mistaken." "You have proven yourself very capable. A person of virtue. Someone with principles that align with ours and clearly not afraid to lay low any threats with extreme prejudice! I am extending an offer to you; an offer to join the Order Of The Guilded Eye. To be a Watcher against the coming darkness. You may choose to keep this to yourself. Your companions need not know - this is your choice. Do not answer now. But think on it." - she hands Penny a small pin, for a cape or cloak, with the Order's symbol. "If you do choose to accept, please wear this with pride. And those in our Order will know." Penny nods, doesn't answer, and heads back to her room. Querria leaves quietly behind.

## Day 14 (back to Neverwinter)
### 8am

We wake up. Thorin and Arturo elect to not discuss what happened last night. Penny insight 16, she's wondering if anyone else got approached or anything? The other two are a bit less jubliant and enthusiastic than yesterday. She's not sure why. File that for another day.

"We should let Querria know that we're headed out" says Penny. "But breakfast first?" - we decide to do that. We're all packed, the room is all clean; so the innkeepers realise we're leaving. "Can't say that I don't feel sad you're leaving - at least for me, and for others in this town, we feel a lot safer with you around!" "We do plan to come back at some point" says Thorin. "You'll always have a room here, as I said."

We stand after breakfast and thank the innkeepers. Penny makes a point of adjusting a new, shiny pin on her cloak.

Up to the cathedral. There's quite a different treatment - the guards, the wariness is gone. People all say hello. We're greeted at the Cathedral and invited up to see Querria. Quite different from our first arrival!

We get to her room. Thorin perception 13, Arturo 4! Oh dear. She seems very friendly. Penny notices her eye fall immediately to the pin. She smiles. "Good morning. Come in! Am I guessing you are leaving town today?" "Yep" "Very well. Where are you headed?" - Arturo suggests we keep that to ourselves, given the unknown spread and nature of the threat; "Very wise!" she says. "Be well and may the blessings and protection of Helm be on you. May his eye watch over you and keep you safe."

* D4 to use whenever we want on a D20 until the next long rest.

"Shall we see you to the gate, or leave quietly?" so we decide to go via the gate - pomp and circumstance, walking out normally, nobody knows we're going to teleport.

On the way out, Querria hands Penny a folded blue and gold cape. It's similar to Javen's. Penny thanks her and stows it in the backpack. "There's a potential conflict of religions, but I will consider it." "It does not have Helm on it!" "Fair enough!"

And so, we walk out. The word has spread; townsfolk are already there to see us off. Some of the kids and young women have made garlands and Arturo, who's leading the way, seems to get them all this time. It's not necessarily good for the ego, but it's fun all the same.

We head up to the ridge; no perytons; we're finally out of sight of the keep.

### 9am

Here goes nothing. Thorin dons the helm. He has a tankard from Southside Ales, so he casts the spell...

...To the surprise of everyone inside Southside Ales, a rip in reality appears in the tavern and four people step through this strange and rather scary thing. People are astonished; people close by back away towards the wall; we all just act like it's totally normal! Arturo persuasion 28 (!) - people look almost like they're not sure they even saw what they saw. Perhaps it's helped by the fact that anyone drinking here at 9am could well have been drinking since last night! A few people put down tankards, pick up hats and head to the door.

The bar staff give us a strange look. "There is a door, you know!" says one. Penny says, "Sorry, but this was faster..." - Thorin is still holding his Southside Ales tankard; it's filled from a jug as he stands there and he flicks over 2cp. Penny joins in with ale from the Southside Ale tankard. Seems rude not too.

Thorin is on extra special guard! He has all the cash, and a lot of expensive items. At least a lot it is in the bag of holding which Francesc carries; we form up around Francesc and Thorin, Arturo at the front, Penny at the back, to keep an eye out.

Arturo investigates a place to get the armour made. Investigation 24. There's a particular artisan here whose name we are given; she is **Hela**. She's a specialist in dealing with exotic natural materials. Her smithy in the Blacklake District is unusually large. The area is set into a high wall, a terraced area; the chimney pumps out smoke and the door is very large, 10ft high.

### 9:30am

We see a very muscular, slightly pale blueish-grey skinned woman, with very intense line tattoos all over her skin and arms, with no hair except a high ponytail of very pale blonde hair tied back. She wears straps of leather holding a thick leather armourer's apron on over her but underneath wears not much. Penny figures a Goliath; so what look like tattoos, if so, would actually be part of the skin itself.

"I'll be with you in just one moment!" she calls as she continues working for a while, then turns to us and says "Good morning! It's morning? Yes! I'm Hela."

Arturo introduces us and asks about the black dragon armour. She's very excited and sweeps a clean area off a workbench with little regard to the things on there. We start to pull them out of the Bag Of Holding. "Black dragons! Oh my goodness. Did you lose anyone? I hate to ask?" Penny says "No, but *almost* that one" - pointing at Arturo.

She's very impressed with the quantity and quality. It can be full scale armour. Thorin raises his hand as the recipient. There are various inevitable questions about fit and finish. He prefers an option for design that's a bit more flexible, a bit more mobile, rather than something more showy and bulky. There are more scales than are needed, and Thorin negotiates a trade where she will buy and use some of the spare scales, e.g. working some of them into leather armour decoratively.

Asking about Arturo - not enough scales left to make him something and he can't do leather armour - Hela recommends someone called **Tamyo** over in the Tower District where she runs a shop. She's an enchantress. A bit quirky, but highly recommended!

We chill out while she measures up Thorin.

It'll take four *weeks* to make. Wow. 28 days to wait. That's a long time, but at least we'll have something pretty special and there's a big discount. 2500gp all-in. Arturo and Thorin immediately launch into bartering. Arturo roles nat 20 + 8 -> 28. "We're just starting out adventuring, which is why we're paying in resources rather than gold..." - and we're happy for her to keep *all* of the remaining scales. That brings the price down to 1500gp, which is a hell of a deal.

Just after encouraging Thorin to go ahead, Penny turns and suddenly sees a very well painted, white and blue accented set of steel plate armour. Oh, now *that* is tempting. Penny can't help up but ask about it.

It's the standard price; 1500gp; Penny tries to negotiate a price and payment method. Francesc pitches in. Even with advantage it's only 5,9+7->16. The price is dropped to 1250, but she'll accept gems at full value in exchange.

That's 2750 in total. We have about 670gp equivalent in gems, which Arturo is happy to part with. We have the option to pay only half of the black dragon scale armour now, and the rest when it's finished. So that's 2000 we owe now. After gems, that's 1330gp. There's not much trade-in value for Penny's rather beaten up armour!

### 10:30am

It takes 2 hours to investigate to find the best places to sell the art objects, which in theory are all worth about 3075 in total. Penny tries to sell the 3x750gp and 3x25gp pieces and gets full price. Arturo at 27 persuasion with Thorin's help gets 10% more for the 3x250 urns. 825gp all-in.

### Around 1pm

We're nearing the Tower District for Tamyo. It's a tower! A strange entrance, going up onto stairs for a landing, then down again to another door and stairs that snake around the outside of the tower. Painted on the tower are little paintings of eyes that seem to follow us as we walk around; and as we reach the door in the tower, which is closed; we knock.

After a pause, the door is yanked abruptly open and there stands a surprised gnome! "Wait. How did you avoid my security system?! It gives me a chance to assess people and I decide whether or not to open the door! Well, you might as well come in..." - and Tamyo introduces herself.

Arturo remembers that our amulets protect us from any magical scrying, and points that out. Tamyo relaxes a bit at this. He then explains that we come here via recommendation of Hela. They get into a conversation. He asks about a Pearl Of Power (D20 roll -> 15), or maybe anything that might make him a bit more hardy? She says we're in luck; she has an empty Pearl - colloquially so; this is actually an amethyst set into a ring. 250gp. We all agree that this is a good idea! Then there's the question of anything else... "I have an amazing thing for you here! It's one of my favourite things to enchant" - she pulls out a beautiful, shimmering black cloak, with two long tassels ending in weird pods with sharp spikes on them. Arturo Arcana 15; he's not seen this in action but he's heard of them. "Let me show you what it does. It's currently attuned to me."

She puts it on. As she does so, she seems to blur, appearing in several places at the same time. A **Cloak Of Displacement** - but it's 3000gp.

We "um" and "ah", so she sees that and shows us another option. Again, a cloak; "I make this every season and it's available in different colours!" - when Arturo touches one, he gets the feeling that he could attune and it would create a general sense of protection. It is in fact a Cloak Of Protection; +1 to AC and saving throws. This is much more affordable; 600gp.

Arturo realises he wants the pearl most of all - but that fills his attunements. Thorin figures he'd like a cloak, though; so Arturo tries to bargain. Penny pitches in to help too. Arturo persuasion 26... She drops the 850gp to 775gp for the two. Great!

* We'll hold there to give Francesc a chance!
* Penny might want to get something to help with Darkvision?
* Put on the new armour *after* next long rest
* Note that **day 42** would have the Neverwinter armour ready to go.
