# RIPA: Part 27
## Session 27 (2024-01-16)
### Day 27, late, at the near-Neverwinter deforestation front lines

We're up a tree, looking at the heavily deforested - razed, burned - forest beyond, with a fortified encampment of sorts protecting the loggers and other people responsible. Thorin has seen are furrows criss-crossing the ground in most recently cleared areas, and mounds of earth; we realise that the logging is just a ruse - really, **they're looking for something**. We don't know what yet.

We considered our options for finding out more:

* Stealth in maybe, as attuning to the orb would take an hour and maybe our camp will be attacked itself in that time.
* Penny could stay behind and attune to the orb in the mean time, since she can't stealth in.

So, the three go for stealth and start to climb down, while Penny begins to attune to the orb. Stealth:

* Arturo: 25
* Francesc: 27
* Thorin: 18

Francesc first; Thorin next; Arturo last. They dart behind bushes wherever they can find them, heading to the camp's edge. There are no trees or plants around the camp, but some cover can be made out of wagons and crates here and there. They get behind the barricade lines. To the left of the camp, looking at it from the front line... Perception checks... Three tents stand out because they look significant - not for sleeping in. Guards are posted in front of the middle sized of the three. A large one looks like it has people eating and there's nobody outside the smallest, but there's light within. The mid-sized one is closest; large tent next; smaller one is further away.

Quiet whispers... The smallest tent seems easier, if further... More stealth:

* Francesc: 33
* Arturo: 33
* Thorin: 13

Up in the tree, concentrating on an orb, Penny is distracted by a very obvious dwarf running between tents.

It's not too hard to get to the large tent, all the same; Francesc stops, listening. Perception! Thorin 26. Arturo and Francesc - not so good. Thorin hears workers complaining, from a bench closest to their side of the tent (seen in shadow). "Bullshit orders! It makes no sense!" and so-on. "I wouldn't mind so much doing some inbred noble's whims, if they actually paid us when they said they would." More complaints. People wind each other up a bit. "We need to confront the foreman about pay!" Tankards are being rattled and slammed.

Arturo wants to get to the next tent but the open-on-two-sides dining tent doesn't provide much cover once they move away from the canvas wall. He decides to set up a minor illusion of a bear as a distraction! "What was that?" "What?" "What was *that*?" shouts - "Bear!" "But there are guards!" "Maybe they've not been paid either!" - it's a successful distraction. More stealth:

* Francesc: 30
* Arturo: 34
* Thorin: 18

Nobody sees the group. The small tent is more or less circular, about 10ft radius. Light inside and moving shadows; they listen for a moment to try and judge how many are inside. Thorin 21, Francesc 25. A flickering lamp casts a looming shadow of one person, hunched over something. There's the sound of metal clinking. Counting coins? Hmm - the drunk workers may well be headed this way soon! While Francesc keeps an eye out, Arturo and Thorin walk in boldly, as if they own the place; Thorin casts Charm Person as the person looks up with a scowl. He's realises quickly that he doesn't know the people there, and is about to yell for guards... WIS 16 save, but the *roll* is 17 (we don't know modifiers). Arturo reacts to interfere; D4->1, it's not enough - he makes the save and isn't charmed. But Francesc is ready too and as the man starts to yell, she casts Silence.

Thorin runs in to grab the (silently) shouting man, Arturo helps by trying to grab his legs; Thorin attack 22, grabs hold, ATHL 19. He's grappled. Arturo ties him up. People position themselves so that Thorin can see in the entrance but be just outside the tent & the Silence zone, then tries once more with Charm Person. Once again, the accountant resists. Then they hear - "HEY!" - Francesc turns around quickly to see the guards at the far tent, who've now clearly seen this small tent with the open door, light spilling out and Thorin stood outside. They start to run in.

(Penny in the tree is laughing so hard she almost drops the orb, DEX save 17, just manages to catch it)

In a split second of panic, Francesc runs into the tent to grab what she can. There's a stack of papers and ledgers and piles of silver and gold coins on the table. A *lot* of money. There's a small open chest with more. There's a small cot bed and some personal effects such as a cloak. She shovels all the papers into the bag of holding, the small chest and all the gold too!

Thorin casts Wall Of Thorns between this tent and the food marquee to block the guards and anyone else who might come. A 60ft wide, 10ft tall rises near-instantly out of the ground, long, evil thorns that almost sparkle in the light from the tents with razor-sharp points.

Francesc runs back outside and now notices Arturo has the tied up accountant in tow. Dropping the Silence spell, there's an unspoken agreement to take the hostage. Thorin wildshapes into a dire wolf and *picks up* the tied accountant with his jaws - carefully - and the group runs. But where? Ideally not in a way that leads everyone to the hidden rebels! Penny suddenly sits upright and stops laughing as they look towards the tree she's in - surely they wouldn't run *that* way, *would they...?!*

The dire wolf heads directly at the edge barricades; at the size of the dire wolf, those wooden barriers won't pose a problem! Francesc and Arturo run after him.

Up in the tree, Penny sees the dire wolf charging directly in her direction. *Yes. Yes they would*.

Dire wolf athl 6! It runs into the barricade and is stopped in its tracks. **THUD**. Penny cheers up at that one. He backs up, then runs and jumps - better strategy - easy. Arturo and Francesc see that the barricades there are quite low and it's a fairly easy jump.

On the other side, the guards from elsewhere in the camp are closing. Five, plus the two who'd been stopped by the thorn wall. Arturo athl 17, Francesc 16, Wolf 14; they're closing on Francesc, but the wolf's fast and Arturo is more agile. They're about 100ft away from Penny so she figures it's time to give up on the orb and starts to climb down the tree. ATHL dirty 20 - she just jumps!

Eloise runs up, waving her hands; "What are you doing?!" - and (insight 20, Francesc) clearly doesn't want us leading the guards to their camp so Penny says, "We'd better lead them away then!" and she starts to run into the forest, away from the rebel camp. Penny sees the man in the jaws of the dire wolf very freaked out and is worried he might literally die of fright that she casts Heroism (L1), persuasion disadv. 22,21 and he allows the spell to take effect. Now he's just angry!

The dire wolf is a fast runner and pulls away. Francesc isn't far behind. Arturo and Penny draw up the rear. Francesc spins round and sends a couple of arrows backwards, unsure if to aim for legs or face (!); gets in a hit; 11 damage. The poor guard is immediately disorientated, clutching at the arrow in his cheek and trying to get slugs off his face! But another guard shouts, "**They've got the gold! Stop them!**"

Penny realises we're running towards the river. We'll reach it in a few seconds. Penny shouts, "I am wearing metal armour. *I will sink!*" (internally, "I should've stayed in the tree").

Thorin sees that nearby is a bend, some 90ft wide. It's narrower a bit further away. Behind him he hears Penny shout, "Drop the guy! Frighten the guards!". Thorin is about 20ft from the bank, turns back into a druid, then casts Conjure Animals into the water, to get four river crocodiles. They start crawling up the bank out of the river. The rest of the party is catching up. We're too heavy for regular sized crocodiles; so Thorin orders them to work together to get the accountant across the river! Three get to work. Arturo casts Fly on himself and Penny, Francesc floats across with slugs - albeit slowly! - and Thorin is heklped by the fourth crocodiles.

At the bank, we see the guards turning up and then, shortly after, a mob from the camp with torches who must've realised their pay was taken. We reach the other side of the river; crossbows are fired but don't have the range; lots of angry shouting... Thorin sends the crocodiles back as a distraction and soon them and the guards are in battle.

We retreat into the trees a distance, Penny carrying the accountant, then Franesc checks on the amount of gold. 480-500gp gold and silver equivalent all-in. She goes back to the river bank, holds up the chest, then shouts, "Here's the money that the guards were withholding from you!" "No we weren't!" "Well, were you paid or not? I'll leave this gold here; the crocodiles will go away eventually; you can come and get it". Francesc persuasion... 4. They don't believe her. She leaves the gold anyway and heads back into the trees.

Looks like we'll be setting up our own camp. We keep moving for a while, to get some distance to the river. Later, Penny tries to persuade the accountant to speak. Nat 3+7 -> 10. No good. He's outraged. He complains about being attacked and Thorin says, "And we'll keep doing it if you don't speak up" - intimidation 18. He has a change of heart. He doesn't know what it's all about and feigns ignorance... He then explains the reason he's not paid everyone was that he was trying to figure out how to make the money appear to stretch. He wasn't given anywhere near enough for the amount of time people have actually been there - the expedition was meant to be 15 days, but it's 19 days already. He paid at days 5 and 10, but then was realisin that things weren't going to plan and started trying to figure out how to delay.

He *does* know that they're looking for *something*, despite having played all innocent a moment earlier. It's taking too long because they can't find it. He says that details were in the papers, he never paid attention. Francesc investigates. **Some locations are there, crossed out; one that's not yet crossed out is "Heart Of The Woods".**

Penny history 14; Francesc with advantage and +8 only 12; Thorin 10; Arturo 6. Penny is the top of the bunch?!

Giant runes, maybe dwarven; describing based on dimensions something that's maybe 8ft long by 5ft wide, probably made of stone. Looks like a tablet? Thorin suggests asking the trees - they might be able to detect something via their roots. Looking at other sheets, one has a rough drawing of something that seems to be the same idea. Apparently there are five. It seems they have found at least one and believe at least one more, if not more than that, are in the woods. It's a **100 mile area**, so they'd be causing horrendous damage to the forest.

Investigation 22, Francesc; deep dive through the papers. Takes about 10 minutes.

* There seems to be the same signature on behalf of a company on all the employment contracts
* The name may be less important than the company - it's the "NNI", New Neverwinter Initiative, so Shadowmantle is involved unsurprisingly

Penny, perception 17, looking at this as Francesc shows things. One contract is signed differently - "Velindra Shadowmantle". That seals it!

The accountant is increasingly angry, telling us to let him go. He does name his boss; **Wallace Mgdonnal** - same name as the signatory on most of the contracts. They were hired to find something missing, an heirloom, they have one, believe the rest of here... That's all he knows.

There is talk about him being let away but Francesc tries to persuade him not to go to the camp. In the end Penny gives up with all the to-and-fro, spins him around, gets Thorin to cast PWAT and come with her; she leads the guy to the river bank, says "follow downstream until you find something interest" and then we turn to return to the camp, knowing we'll leave no trail. Penny survival 16, Thorin survival 18. We get back OK, despite the lack of trails. It does take a long time - some 40 minutes or so.

We decide to rest. Watch:

* Arturo: Perception 12. The firelight is pretty and distracting and makes him sleepy... Thinks there's a sound, checks, no nothing... Wakes Thorin.

* Thorin: Perception 14. Distracted by annoyance at Francesc giving back 500 gold! Natural movement in the forest. A sense of *something* off, but not quite sure what. Investigate the next day? Doesn't want to wander away from camp.

* Francesc: Perception 22. The woods are definitely "not right". Beyond the range of vision, on the edge of hearing... Or edge of imagination? Movement that's not random. It's not an animal, but not coming near us either. To the West maybe.

* Penny wakes for watch and decides to finish attuning to the orb. Perception: 15, while Francesc heads off to investigate.

### Day 28

Francesc heads West, cautiously. Perception 16. Tracks, humanoid, recent - yesterday? Not overnight. We're not the only ones who have been through this area. She knows the way, so wakes up the party once it's morning. We have a quick rations breakfast and get on the trail - Francesc wasn't the only one to feel that something was wrong last night, after all.

Arturo examines the tracks; survival 12. Someone in shoes! The tracks moved around a bit in this area, where we happened to camp in fact (but long before we arrived) then continue away West. Francesc adv survival 21, notes that the tracks some distance away are joined by a second set. Thorin, looking too; survival 19; two sets of boot prints. Look soft - not very heavy creatures - but other marks around that look kind of random, but then he spots a pattern. Large, multi-legged creature, sharp pointy feet, walking alongside the two. They're not in clean rows though, there's a somewhat sporadic arrangement. Arturo wonders if it was the orcish Lightning Boar crew, but the prints are for probably too-small feet, too-light people. Elves? Drow!

We keep tracking. 20 minutes pass. Older and older woods. Less light now. Francesc survival 15. She loses the tracks! Penny (14) can't find the either. Thorin, 21; picks up the creature's tracks and, following that for a while, we realise that the boot prints aren't on the ground now - but he sees scuffs on tree roots and so-on. **They're trying to hide their tracks here**. Penny theorises that we must be close to something they care about.

We elect to become more stealthy.

On passive perception, Thorin notices a slight change in the wind here; a colder air, flowing away from us, in a strange direction. Towards an entrance...? Ugh. Underdark.

2 x D20 rolls requested, highest is: Penny 19, Frances 18, Arturo 20, Thorin 10. Thorin's leading the group on instinct towards the entrance. DEX save needed! Arms waving and he disappears. Arturo leaps after him, while casting a spell - he vanishes too. Arturo diving in sees the patch of shadow, not solid. Falling - having cast light - Arturo is hoping to catch up with Thorin to cast Feather Fall.

Penny and Francesc don't know that and can only watch bemused as Arturo dives in head first too! Francesc approaches cautiously and shouts down the hole, "What's down there?"

Falling, Arturo perception - and given a yelling Thorin, advantage - only 8! - he notes that Thorin's cries carry no echo, implying a dangerously large cavern; he doesn't know which direction to cast it, but has to react and just chances it. Luck roll -> with wild surge advantage -> 4!; luck from Thorin, combined, it's enough; the two now Feather Fall.

(Up top, we get no answer - the other two reached at least 500ft away before the fall slowed).

Thorin and Arturo land a few seconds later. Arturo guesses around 600ft or so of distance. His light (20ft) doesn't reach any walls nearby but Thorin points out that there are some ledges and things (60ft darkvision), rising up more on one side to a wall, at edge of vision...

(Up top, Francesc searches for another way down - handholds, steps or something - nope; a short tree root, nothing else. Penny pulls out the orb. It'll take 10 minutes to work).

...there are sounds coming from the distance, outside range of sight. No bones or signs of struggle, apart from one or two animal bones. Accidental deaths.

Arturo carves an arrow in the stone pointing to a path the decide they'll take, which is one that's at the wall with some shallow steps leading up. It looks like a natural formation that's since been used so much that it's become a full path. A lot of people have gone this way. The path winds through passageways and caverns, mostly looking natural, wind-carved or water-carved. It feels like going deeper into the cave complex, rather than something which climbs significantly...

(Penny asks Francesc, "How long do you think it'll be before they realise they're on their own and we can't get down ourselves?")

...they decide the path isn't safe with just the two of them. Returning to the cavern, Arturo flies the two of them back up. A minute later, they pop up out of the top.

"It's only been about 5 minutes" says Penny, sounding disappointed.

Francesc and Arturo aren't entirely convinced about following them. Persuasion 24; Penny is convinced. Francesc relents, though she's very uncomfortable with underground spaces. "So how are we getting down?" Arturo tells Penny to grab the immovable rod as a safety mechanism, get on his shoulders, piggy back (!) and he floats down, falling slowly (via Fly). She's heavy - 160lb herself and similar carried - 320lb, but he's can carrying 60lb, so he throws his back quickly into the bag of holding - time on the Fly spell is passing! - and that gets it within his abilities (330lb carry). Thorin carries down Francesc with a similar approach.

We kit back up. Francesc notices the arrow in the ground; we can't see it clearly so Penny activates the Sun Blade at full bore. Funnily enough that doesn't help at first! She lifts it right up above her head and we can see a bit of glistening on wet cavern walls above. It's huge.

Various disadvantage perception or insight rolls - Thorin notices just before the sun blade that there are some very dim natural sources of light; bioluminescence. On insight, Arturo has noticed the general worn path, and Francesc sees it too - traffic, and lots of it, walking along the path, but we don't know which way. Thorin describes the way they went before. So, we figure we might go the other way a short distance just to see what the difference is! It's 50:50, really.

This time, we end up near pools, crystallisation happening, strange colours, more glowing. Very large-leaved, very pale, almost translucent plants somehow grow. Bioluminescence from funghi is obvious here. Movement sounds from beyond the light limits seem to be insects and critters scurrying away from the light. They sound on the larger side of normal! The path bends to the left, towards a larger, wind-blown cavern; a new chamber. Walls again seem smoothed by the passage of time and elements, glistening. Almost like a membrane - an alien, overly organic feeling. The path lifts. It reaches a ledge on the left of the cavern, with jagged rocks and fissues to the right. Wind whistles down below.

Wherever we go, the same scurrying sounds of fast-departing creatures follows just ahead.

A land bridge crosses the cavern to a ledge on the other side; heads downwards; we're definitely in the Underdark now. As long as the path doesn't split or become hard to see, we can certainly find our way back - so although we might get attacked by something, we shouldn't get lost.

Thorin decides to talk to one of the big plants. He asks what kind of things pass here. The shiver! "Hunting parties. They leave, and they return with quarry." "What kind of quarry?" "Usually stunned and paralysed quarry. They carry them." "People? Animals?" "What is the difference?" "I am a person!" "Well... Yes, more like you than like us. Like the hunters, but lesser." "Can the quarry speak?" "We don't hear them speak."

Thorin learns that they look a bit like Francesc, only different - that confirms Drow. The plant also mentions that a hunting party came past a few hours ago, heading in the direction we are going, with quarry.

Thorin gets the rest of us up to date. So, it's not necessarily about those tablets or anything! It seems like business as usual for the creatures down here. Francesc and Aruto are keen on finding a way to convince the Drow to speak; they might know about the extraplanar incursion - *hopefully* still a long way away underground! - or the tablets?

It's risky, but we elect to continue.

Penny shuts down the sword. It's less aggravating and Arturo's light is enough for now. Thorin leads, Francesc keeps an eye on the rear.

Up front, Thorin & Arturo (perception 20, 24) see movement up ahead on a ledge, briefly. (Penny, Francesc behind don't see that). Arturo tells Francesc to tell them in Elvish, "We come in peace!" - Penny overhears; "They'll speak Undercommon!" so she shouts "We come in peace!" in that language. An arrow flies out, narrowly missing Thorin. It feels like a warning shot.

Someone on the ledge only about 20ft above and away makes themselves visible. A drow; long white hair tied into a ponytail, hand crossbow ready to fire again; Thorin raises his hands. The drow speaks in Undercommon.

"Who are you? Why are you intruding on our domain? Turn back now or die."

Penny answers, "A catastrophic explanar force invades the underdark, coming from the East. We seek information and to provide a warning" - lucky persuasion; 18+7->25.

The drow jumps down to land in front of us, still aiming the crossbow. "Although I believe you, that doesn't answer why you would risk certain death to encroach upon the Spider Queen's kingdom."

Thorin says - "We didn't know it was the Spider Queen's kingdom - " - and is cut off; "Everything beyond the reach of the light belongs to her!"

Penny says, "Well, we followed some tracks, thought you might know something - and then fell down the hole." Thorin adds, "Is there anyone we could speak to? Your leader?"

The drow looks to the other two. "Are these your slaves? Are they not allowed to speak?"

Penny and Thorin nod and say "yes" in unison.

The drow pivots on his heel and starts walking, but is clearly alert. Penny says "Follow carefully, no funny moves!" as he says, "I will take you as far as the Outpost Of The First Brother".

After a while, he leaves the path we're on and taken to a higher ledge, parallel path. Penny tries to remember where it was, based on any landmarks. He turns around annoyed at one point; "Get your servant to turn that awful thing off!" - Thorin says, "Turn off the light" to Arturo. It takes a moment - but then we realise that there's *just* enough glow here to get by, albeit very dim. The bottom of the cavern is covered in almost a meadow of funghi, other plants, 3ft long centipedes... On the cavern walls, 3 large spiders - some 4ft in diameter - skitter along above us, following.

Up ahead, we eventually see a tower, built into the side of the rock. Some of it is natural, other parts made of stone. It looks Stoneshaped - carved by magic. It rises about 30ft above the cavern floor, but not wide - maybe one room width - a watchtower, probably.

Some spiders drop from the ceiling onto the tower; others jump elsewhere. The guide reaches the door and opens it. Another guard is inside who leaps to attention, draws a scimitar at the sight of us; our guide says, simply, "It is fine, I captured them. They are not a threat. They claim to have valuable information. I believe, that they believe, that they do. Is the Captain in his quarters?" "Yes... You... How lucky do you feel?!" "Let's see how lucky *they* are!"

He turns to us. "Go up the stairs. There's a trap door. The captain is in the room at the top". We explain in Common briefly and head up.

Arturo, Francesc trailing, perception; nat 1 Arturo, nat 20 for 26 Francesc! Light sniggering behind us.

Thorin reaches the trap door, since Penny really can't see much - there's almost no light in the tower. Thorin knocks on the trap door. No names were given, so he shouts, "The guards told us to speak to you! We have important information!"

A cold answer, "Come up. Push the trap door."

Thorin examines it for traps... Pushes it gently - perception 19 - he can see the boots of the captain about 5ft away, facing the trap door. He opens it fully and looks up. The air swooshes past his face as a scimitar *just* grazes the edge of his nose - but doesn't hit him. There's the drow captain. Hair also tied back; quite beautiful, gleaming black metal armour. Fine scale - looks almost like snakeskin. He's sneering, of course. "We come in peace!" says Thorin. "Of course! You were captured by our patrols. How else could you come?" - Thorin walks up; the rest of us follow. Francesc appears last, and at the sight of her, the captain who had relaxed gets fully back to attention, grabs a shortsword as well as his scimitar, crosses them at Francesc's throat and says in a sort of Undercommon/Elvish mix - "The chidlren of the traitor gods!" Francesc shrugs.

"We can speak no further until you disarm yourself" he says, looking at Francesc. Thorin heads over to take the bow... Francesc doesn't give it to him; she puts it on the ground, next to the trapdoor, swords alongside.

The captain steps back. He squints at Arturo, trying to figure out what's going on! Appears to give up and looks at Thorin. "You are a... Surface dwarf? How do you know the language of your bretheren?" - he tries to explain about knowing about nature, surface and below, his history... The captain seems unimpressed. "You speak it poorly. But at least you speak it. Well, you have promised information in exchange for your life?"

Penny repeats the information about the extraplanar creatures. Very dangerous! Surely, word much have reached you by now...

"No. This is not a threat that we..." - and there's a word she doesn't quite recognise; unaware, but implying total disinterest, an inconsequential threat. Beneath them.

"It is unwise to underestimate an enemy. These creatures are not of this world. They threaten all."

"They threaten all *above* the ground."

"They travel below it"

"Then why would we not let them pass through? You've not given me anything of value. I must deliver something of value... Perhaps, your slaves?"

"Again, you underestimate the enemy. They might just pass through or might seek to destroy you. It is an incalculable risk."

"*You* underestimate the power of the priestesses of Loth. Her servants will warn us if something needs our attention."

Thorin asks to speak to a priestess. A creepy, very uncomfortable smile crosses his face. "I can bring you to a priestess, if that's what you wish...!" - an unnatural amount of glee.

"Is it not an affront to the Spider Queen that these entities invade her domain?"

"Invade? They might be servants. They might be fellow agents of her actions. *If* they are a threat to us, surely we would have been told by now."

Francesc whispers about the stone tablets. Penny tries, "Oh also, the people up above are digging for the stone tablets. They'll probably find them soon."

Insight 18 - Penny is at the limit of what she can really do personally here!

Thorin says, "Well, that's all the information we have. We're going to leave!"

"Very well. With what will you buy your freedom?"

Penny draws the Sun Blade and activates it!

(End of part 27)
