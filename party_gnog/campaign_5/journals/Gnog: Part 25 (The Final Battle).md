# Gnog: Part 25 (The Final Battle)
## 7am, day 60 (Ravnica 40, Riglan 97 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Tuesday (7 day week); by 2pm TODAY, Bolas will have run out of (willing) Orzhov souls

Gnog in practice had a bit of a fitful sleep, but wakes up around 7am. He lies in bed but Taz is aware he's awake and activates too. Fee-Ree stirs with Arxcis. We decide to take time over breakfast. Deni is still asleep, but eventually wakes.

We have porridge and tea. There's a tense mood, so Gnog says, "We all know today's the day. We'll do what we do best; play to our strengths, look after each other. If there's a betrayal - one of us, or another - we meet it with love and understanding, not anger and recrimination. There'll be a good reason, and we'll just have to deal with it. We've been in some scrapes before... And we're gonna get out of this one."

### 8am

Eventually we pack up. Arxcis heads below to help coordinate evacuation people from the most dangerous areas below the expected fight zones. A slightly cloudy morning, but the sun is up, hazy, Vitu-Ghazi silhouetted. Not moving yet!

We head for the safehouse, to will wait there and get everyone gathered.

A hive of activity around the labs, as we go past! We leave them to it, not applying more pressure; but very busy.

### 8:30am

We get to the safehouse, get the key out and walk through the barrier. The mood inside is surprisingly lively. Already busy here. We ask around for Jace; conflicting messages about where he is. Someone says upstairs, someone says cellar. We check the cellar first. We didn't know there was one! An apothecary kind of lab has been set up. Jace and a couple of other planeswalkers are here, going through shelves, picking up potions and brewing something.

Jace looks up. "Where did you sleep?" and we explain. He says they've had a busy night, but slept alright. It's the waiting that kills you! 

We excuse ourselves from the Planeswalkers to talk about Ugin and the Eye. Jace concurs with the construct plan to take the Eye to the Ruby Palace, but confirms the risk - the construct could be attacked and the eye stolen. It can't necessarily fight as well as us or be as hardy should it come to that. Timing, as with everything, will be key.

### 9am

Figuring that waiting is annoying, we gather everyone to see if people are on task & on time. Kaya is absent and we don't know yet when the goblins will finish. Nissa checks on the awakening ritual for completeness, and so-on; over the next hour and a half or so, we get word back from all. Tentatively, albeit precariously, things are in place. Not everyone is convinced it will succeed, but people are focused on the parts they individually play.

### 10:30am

By 10:30am, Gnog decides to risk annoying the goblins and heads out to see how they're doing at the lab. The 'bombs' are mostly complete but just need about an hour to complete all the straps and fittings to make them usable. Outstanding; we say, OK, we'll be back around 12 then, comfortably ahead of schedule.

On the way back, we meet Nissa coming the other way, just as a battleforce angel descends towards us. "Ah! Thought I saw you! We've picked up something from the Parhelion. There's a massive dust storm that seems to be moving Southwards towards us through the red wastes. A column of dust, nearly a mile long, moving at speed." Gnog says, "Ah! That could be Boboremos..." and the angel offers that we can come up and look for ourselves, to save a Sending spell. So, we get taken up to the Parhelion.

With spyglass and advantage, Gnog only rolls 2,8+9->17. It's enough to get the gist of it. The dust is narrow and long, a clear visible column. At the front he sees what looks like a vanguard of riders. It's a long column of dust that's kicked up by a smaller set of fast-moving creatures. **At the rate they're going they'll hit the wall in less than an hour.** Gnog's confident that it's Boboremos' forces, so asks the angel to spread the word that these people are to help with clearing Precinct One and need channelling through to that area. They should be allowed to pass. Nissa offers to go to P3 to help with the spells there and can open up part of their wall rather than needing to smash the bulwark - theirs is created magically.

We note that they're quite early! Boboremos is enthusiastic and eager for battle. **"What hell, then;" says Gnog to Nissa, "Let's call that the go signal!** When they start to reach P1, we'll fetch those bombs and kick this whole thing off. In that case, we have a sun to deactivate!"

So Nissa heads off to P3 and we head back to the safehouse. We let people know the new timing. And now for the big party trick - **we need to turn off the Immortal Sun**. We find a quiet room, away from everyone, so that at least it's not obvious we've been carrying this thing around with us the whole time! Vi comes along, to maintain the illusion, since she'd said only she knew where it was. Mu Yanling comes too, with Jace.

We take the box out of the Bag Of Holding and activate it to its full size. We open the box and have to keep our eyes averted!

Jace says, "Right. I can do it - I'm familiar with this..." and starts to weave runes to *magically* operate the rods that activate the sun. Too bright to do it by hand! In a matter of moments there's a sharp "click" and the light goes out.

"Well" says Gnog - "that'll do it! We're on!"

We pack up the sun into the bag of holding again (!) and head back down to the main area, announcing that the sun is off and those planeswalkers who need to leave ASAP should "keep an ear to the ether" so to speak.

We elect to follow in behind the Gruul through P1. That way, safety in numbers; we can keep eyes on the gods and Bolas the whole time and Jace can be in place. Nissa has to help her there with Niv. Deni starts to cast her Telepathy ritual for us. People start leaving the safehouse. We'll probably follow up the rear, letting people know we'll collect and distribute the bombs, but we all end up going there to avoid chasing people down.

The goblins are *ready*, ahead of schedule. Three goblin engineers are each carrying a device, with one goblin guard each. They work in pairs.

* An izzit goblin with an MA-like device crudely strapped together, each with a small visible field in a glass ampule within the device, but with the bulk of it being the resonance device with big horn-like speakers either side of the head pointing forward
* The other is armoured and armed - to protect the carrier goblin - but they also know enough to activate the device if the carrier goblin goes down.
* We don't know if the carrier goblin will be hurt when it fires! They haven't had time to test; we *are* an hour or two early.
* Gibo and Bebe are each a bomb carrier! We didn't expect that.

Onward then, with custom thanks - we owe them many beers. The goblins are hugging and waving goodbye; they say something in Goblin, which could be a war chant, a prayer; we're not sure. We give them space out of respect as they look sombre, before the goblin pairs run to their assigned groups.

We ask if Gibo and Bebe can be in our group; we want to try and protect them. Hell to pay from their mum otherwise!

Now, Oketra is the one with the arrows and is the greatest danger. So we have to run ahead and try to get in front of the main groups. We start moving...

...we hear a low rumble, that is getting louder as the minutes go by. "I hope that's Boboremos!" shouts Gnog. From the North, he can see the dust trail lessening since the column must be onto the city streets now. The rumble turns into more of hooves-on-ground noise. We feel the vibration. Some groups peel off to come at it from P6. We keep diving onwards. Distantly, we see the Verdani moving; parting; we can tell a gap is being opened. "Not long now!" shouts Gnog, as crazy green streaks of magic suddenly appear above Vitu Ghazi - the sky above P3 just lights up; there's no hiding now, it's all out in the open. **Vitu Ghazi *moves*.** The sound is thunderous and terrifying, a thunderous cracking and creaking, as it uproots itself, a giant crater being left behind, rising up and looming even taller, branches moving independently.

Screaming and hollering now. The column is through P3. Riding huge raze/tuskboars and other giant, elephant-sized creatures, are the Gruul. It's a mighty sight! More than 1000 of them, crammed into a frenzied ball of stampeding energy, carrying flaming torches for no reason really, warpainted goblins riding on wolves, horns blown; riding up front, on the back of one of the really large tusk boars, Boboremos himself, running next to him Vyashino, minotaurs, ogres and more. At least 3 hill giants bring up the middle of the column! All run, crashing through P3, breaking through the defending wall which the Selesnyans turn into dry brittle wood at the last minute.

A flash of colour. All dreadhorde in P1 turn in unison to face them. Shields raise. The stamped crashes into them yelling and screaming. Boboremos swinging away with his club, clearing the way. "GRUUL RETAKE PRECINCT ONE TODAY!" he roars.

We're running full tilt towards it all. A shadow above - the Parhelion moves over us. A clarion call sound on warhorns and trumpets blares out and banners unfurl off the bottom. The P4 defenders start to flood into P1. Gates are opened, ropes are dropped.

Gnog shouts, "Just like old times and Skyreach!"

We're able to follow in with the Boros and Gnog starts in this group around us to "command" them - best ex-army-general voice on! - to start clearing the way South to D11.

We are the four of us, Gideon, Mu Yanling flying, Teferi floating on an invisible disk and of course 6 goblins. Then there's a loud whistling sound and a large crash. An Indrick (dinsoaur-like) creature in front of us keels over, a massive golden spear in its side. Gnog shouts "Oketra! Priority, get there fast!" - moments later, another is felled, then a giant. Each takes only a single shot.

It's a terribly long way to P11, especially with the resistance of the Dreadhorde in the way. "Gideon! We need Liliana to pause, even if for a moment. Any distractions you can think of?" He grasps his talisman. "She's not responding! She's not listening to me. I - I think we need to get closer. We need her to see us" - and is interrupted as two of the largest Krasis Gnog has ever seen leap over the bulwark and land in front, crushing Orzhov quarter P1 buildings and Dreadhorde alike. A tower falls. Gnog grasps the pearl to the Speaker. Thinks about her. Shouts as he looks at the scene, "We need those two to cut a path towards..." - and he looks over towards D11 and Oketra - "...that way, but the god there will fire arrows that take them down with a single hit."

Gnog shouts to the group, "We can't get to Liliana without getting to Oketra first so we're just going to have to throw resources at this mess until we're through".

It's a matter of minutes; rages, crazy fast engagements and creatures everywhere. At one point, Fee-Ree asks for a line of sight; Mu Yanling hoists a bunch of us in a wind column. A fireball is thrown in front of the Gruul front lines on the way to the Chamber of the Guild Pact, since all groups we're inadvertently converting on the promenade there. The krasis are sweeping across, but vulnerable to arrow attack. Three smaller have joined the two bigs ones.

Oketra is picking people off. This is no good. The Parhelion moves to engage Kefnet, who is rising; Bolas at least seems to be still concentrating on his spell. As people are falling in battle around us, energy is clearly being siphoned towards him. The strange structure he sits upon is sucking that in. "This is no good, we're too far off" shouts Gnog. "We need to chance it - get underground and get under Oketra, pop up and fight!"

Teferi and Mu Yanling say they'll meet us there, but since they're flying they'll have to take the slower route. Fee-Ree throws another fireball and it is clear that we're doing a lot of good up here, but progress is too slow; Bolas is staying put, which is good to see, the Gods are reacting as anticipated, which is on plan too, but Oketra is too deadly to spend another 10-15 minutes - or more! - trying to get through above.

So Gnog shouts over to the goblins, "any of you know any quick routes down to the tunnels from here? We'll probably have to break through as they'll be defended against the Dreadhorde." They don't know the precinct 1 well! Too posh. Taz investigates. 2+15->17. A building that was toppled by the Krasis has a different style to the lower part and he recognises it from undercity areas. He points and shouts, "there! The Krasis opened one up!" and we run over.

Mu Yanling and Teferei continue flying out. As we change course for the tunnel, they're casting some big spells; huge bolts of arcane energy suddenly come showering down around us from Kefnet, now up and has full wings spread - their span is giant, several times wider than he is tall with metallic, golden wings - and Teferi's big spell shields us. We reach the tunnels and run down, needing to either Kraul ASAP or do the best navigation in the world ever. Old stairs to the side, we run down; a nail-biting 30 seconds or so to descend a few stories to enter a level that shows damage from the shaking above but is otherwise intact. Taz perception 14; it's dark; in the shadows, Kraul eyes peer at us. They are speaking in Kraul. L1 Comprehend, "...very dangerous to be down here! What is happening above!" and Taz "thinks" back - "I am form of Shamen. Huge battle above, a battle for the world. We need your help to get underneath those strange, big gods in District 11, quickly as possible!" - they start chittering, then call for "runner" or "scout" or similar. Gesture for us to follow and we do. They move fast on six legs! We give chase.

Old, brick-lined, round-roof corridors. A smaller Kraul pulls up. "I can take you the fastest way. Is the big one nimble?" and Taz thinks, "Nimble enough." "OK. Please! Follow me!" and we're taken off into a side tunnel. Dex saves - Taz 1+3! He falls over, but Gnog 19+4->23, grabs Taz - because we're jumping out of nowhere over chasms. Taz shouts, "I can use Feather Fall if we need it!" A collapsed skyline of an older city, perhaps? Then Taz follows up with, "PARKOUR!" as we jump.

Fee-Ree feels a bit clumsy and says, "Hold on Taz!" - grabs him and casts Fly for her and him. "Oh that's easier, but less fun..."

A very long-feeling five minutes crossing this strange area, then we head up what seem to be old streets, then the runner stops and points. "That way up! You'll emerge in a cellar. Be careful". Taz thinks back, "Thank you. Very good work. Get to safety." "Good luck! May the spirits of your ancestors guide you!"

We head up - into a cellar. We head up some stairs, cautiously, trying to get a line of sight above ground. An old inn. Stairs lead up to higher floors, windows down here shuttered. Gnog tries to peeking through. Orderly ranks of dreadhorde. Up the stairs we go, to a third floor of this wooden building. Lots of rooms here, and we've no idea what direction we're facing. We split up to check different windows.

Perception 27 - Gnog hears a goblin voice, "I think it might be that way!" and we had to that room. From there, there's a view via a gap between buildings of a familiar location for Oketra. Barely a block and a half away. We can see her lower half in between tall buildings. We can't see above them, so we keep trying to go up further in the building that we're in. Fourth floor, more rooms. Fifth floor says "rooftop gazebo". OK then. We have to creep up there and keep low so we don't get seen by Oketra, hopefully!

We're more or less level with the top of her head. It's not far to go, but there's no direct stealthy route to get next to her. Lots of Dreadhorde, rooftops possibly but risky. Gideon figures there's no other way than the street and we concur. Gideon offers to run first, since he has a connection to Liliana and maybe we're close enough now for her to avoid putting him to harm. Taz and Fee-Ree should try to avoid being vulnerable and keep flying. Deni and Gnog will have to protect the six goblins (!), with air support at least.

The goblins can't clump. If one device explodes it'll take out the other two. They need to be a good 15ft apart. Gideon first, Deni close behind (but on walls, to avoid being too close to undead & being disadvantaged) protecting two goblins; a gap, Gnog, a gap and two more with Fee-Ree and Taz at the rear above, to protect them. Taz can throw down a fortress to block a street off if need be.

Gnog motions to the goblins - "This will be tricky. Stay close to us in your pairs and trust us." To the armoured three, he adds, "Only engage as an absolute last resort; just try to dodge and block.".

Gideon's already headed down. We follow apace. Gnog reassures the goblins. Down below, Gideon takes a deep breath, grasps his talisman, says "OK...!" and throws the doors open, sword and shield drawn. All dreadhoard turn to face him. He steps forward. No movement. Steps again. They start to part. Gnog whispers to the goblins, "remember, 15ft apart, stick with each of us in your pairs".

So, we step away from what we see behind us is a four-storey, quite beautiful wooden inn. The dreadhorde are just staring at us, motionless. They move away from Gideon as he moves forward, shield and sword drawn. Deni keeps close with her two goblins, deciding to walk, after all. Gnog leaves a gap and advances, goblins too. Fee-Ree warns us that the staff is warm but not warning her, and she and Taz drop in at the back. As the last of us move away, a 30+ft column. The dreadhorde stare. Behind us, they close ranks. The parting of ways moves with us.

"This is making me VERY jumpy!" says Deni, eyeing everywhere, looking for exits. Gnog calls to the goblins - shaking in their boots, more or less! - "You doing OK?" and Gibo and Bebe sort of confirm. "Well, I'm alive!" says Bebe.

We get the full block to near Oketra, the Dreadhorde watching. Deni motions at a building to the left. "Gideon, get into there." We can attack from the roof; Oketra is just the other side; and if inside a building, it provides a corral for any Dreadhorde that might come into attack. Gideon kicks open the door and we scurry inside. Deni quickly scouts through. Gideon is holding his talisman and mouthing something we can't hear; he shuts the door.

The mouse is at the stairs. "Seems clear" says Deni - visibly sweating, the first time we've seen that in all these trials we've had. We surmise that it's a 3 storey building. Oketra is visible through shutters on the first floor. A wagon full of the giant arrows! The ground below is swarming; can't do that. The building is fragile and might not take too many hits to come down, from a god anyway, but we figure we need to draw her close - the goblins say *within 10 feet*. Cripes.

No choice. **Gotta get her to come to us.** Gnog tells the goblins to get ready - they should fire when they get the shot, on their initiative and if it works withdraw to safety immediately - cellar, low part of building, anything with cover in case the building comes down. We *WILL* get them out. Deni readies an arrow; she needs a distraction. Gnog runs up to the roof, rages and jumps up to eye level. He roars, throws a javelin - 21 to hit, of course it doesn't - but she turns around. Deni's arrow flies out and it, too, glances off the Lazotep. Behind Gnog, firebolts lance out and impact Oketra too - Fee Ree's on the case. When the flames die down, some of the robes are burned off but the lazotep is (of course) unmarked. "It's not getting through!" shouts Fee-Ree. No shit.

Initiative!

* Gnog 20
* Fee-Ree 19
* Taz 18
* Deni 15
* Gideon 3

Gnog's back on the roof. Fee-Ree was hovering behind. Deni fired from a window on the floor below. Gideon has come up onto the roof. Taz has flown in with Fee-Ree, but keeping a distance at skewed geometry, mindful of prior attacks like straight-line or chained lightning bolts.

* High up above Gnog and to his right, there's a maelestrom of wind swirling around. Kefnet! It hits Gnog that we've been focused on what we're doing and had no sight lines on the other goods for a good 10 or so minutes - a virtual eternity for battles. A brief, jarring moment. Kefnet raises his staff, drawing in clouds that darken and arcs of lightning play across the sky. Gnog then can't help but laugh, almost crazy time, at the absurdity of the scene and the scale of this battle. The Gruul cries stir his blood; his is raging; if nothing else, **this could be a glorious way to die**.

* Then breaking through the clouds, wisps trailing behind it, is the parhelion. Even at this distance the squadrons of angels launching out are easy enough to see, heading out towards Kefnet.

* Rising from Bolas' actually-quite-close obsidian crag a few blocks a way - 400-500ft maybe (Bolas himself still occupied with his spell) - Gnog sees a few of the strange dark angels he'd seen on Amonkhet. Eyes aflame. The rise, apparently to guard Kefnet. Kefnet himself is constantly weaving spells. One Parehelion angel leads the pack to meet them in battle.

Gnog's about 25ft away from Oketra. He can't jump to her without then falling away. He could get just about with 5ft, then try to grab something on the way back; a risky move; but he's raging and more reckless than usual. So he shouts, "FUCK IT" and jumps up, no idea what other resistances she has, so he reaches for his oldest friend - the greataxe.

He swings; 28, it hits but no damage. **Wuuut?!** Lazotep is too hard. Second swing similarly no good, but he hopes he might have her attention. He tries to fall-fly back to the building; just lands on the ledge. Shit. Shouts, "OK, with the Laztoep up, this is a bit of a nightmare!"

As he flies away, Oketra swings with a sentinel reaction. It (very very) hits, 32 to hit. Point blank. 5d10->44->22 damage. The arrow carves straight past him, cutting out a fair chunk, Gideon has to dex save to dodge Gnog and the arrow and it continues to plough into the building across the street behind us, which partially collapses at the impact. And that was just a reaction!

Fee-Ree casts Crown Of Stars. No wild magic surge. She throws a star at Oketra - rolls 19+11 -> 30, *just* matches the armour AC. She hits, for 4d12 radiant damage, a solid 36 but Oketra only takes 18, apparently resistant. "What?" shouts Fee-Ree, "That was right between the eyes! I don't know how much more of this we can do!"

Oketra looks to us (legendary action), eyes turning silver briefly; and the crown around her head flares up brightly. Dex save DC17. Gnog fails; Taz succeeds with inspiration. Fee-Ree is OK, Gideon too. Deni wasn't looking and doesn't even have the problem. Everyone takes 21 radiant damage, Gnog halving that via rage but **he's blinded** and shouts, "Dammit, I screwed up, I'm blinded!"; Fee-Ree holds onto her crown spell.

Taz's turn, says "OK, on it!" and casts via MA L2 Lesser Restoration on Gnog ("...wow, thanks Taz, that was quick!") then gives bardic inspiration to Gideon, who has yet to act. As he's looking over to Gideon, Taz sees - some 1000ft or more away - Bontu has stood tall, a giant scythe raised, which she is swinging wildly, to meet people heading towards her.

Deni runs up onto the roof. "My arrows are not working!" she says; draws again; lets loose anyway; 26, bounces off. Gnog calls back "any damage is good but main thing is to draw her in..."

...and speaking of "her", Oketra acts again. The bow is drawn once more, another giant arrow. She seems to be figuring out who to aim for. She lets loose into the **building under us**. Dex save DC18. Gnog dex save 14+5 - thanks to being close to Gideon, so he misses that. Gideon just makes it, but uses his bardic inspiration. Deni makes it. Fee-Ree and Taz are flying. The building rocks and shudders, the front partly collapsing, but we manage to stay on our feet, Gnog managing to roll back a bit. She's advanced a little to get closer, now 15ft from the rolled-back Gnog but within 10ft of what's left of the front of the building. Oketra throws her hands aside and claws on hands turn into sharp daggers of sorts, the length of shortswords.

She swings at the nearby Gnog, almost no chance of missing after his reckless attack. Hits, for 18->9; hits again, 20->10 (her mod is +23, Gnog's AC is 21, so it's almost impossible for her to miss even if Gnog had a reaction to use his +6 wings). Suddenly, she draws another arrow up towards the parhelion. It hits; big chunks of rock fall from heavy damage. In rubble underneath **us**, meanwhile, a floor or two down, Gnog sees bits of rock being thrown aside; it's the goblins. They're scrambling, some looking hurt, scrambling up. They're getting close to her.

* **Gibo and Bebe call up. "This is what we're here for!" they shout. "Remember us!" - and they, plus the third carrier are thrown toward Oketra by the each of three guard goblins.** 

The ampules behind in their kit are deliberately broken and they are engulfed, as they hit her, in red ruby energy, crackling around. There's a strange very loud crack and very, very loud, deep ringing noise, a shock wave thrown out, and the lazotep on Oketra - and indeed on many Dreadhorde below - simply *shatters* and falls away.

The goblins are gone.

In horror Gnog realises, thinking back to the conversations before, that this was always the plan. They knew some time ago. By the gods. What can he ever tell their mother? The feeling of sorrow is temporarily overwhelming. *No* - not those two - he really thought they'd make it... That there was a way to save them.

Gnog has to try and focus. Below, the Dreadhorde are recovering and starting to swarm. Above, a dark angel flies up above us, headed towards the damaged Parhelion.

Gideon, reeling from the impact of the sonic explosion, takes a fraction of a second to recover, brandishes his sword, and as he's acting **Gnog shouts, in very grim tones, "MAKE IT COUNT."** Gideon shouts, "She's exposed! Take her down!" and does a running jump to try and close the gap from rubble to him. Mimicking the Goblin actions, really. His shield is strapped to his back, two hands on the sword, to try and plough it into her and hang off it as it draws down through her.

He hits, with divine smite on top. Oketra takes 27 damage, for real now. We're exposed though - only Gnog is within 30ft of Gideon and in his aura (along with the 3 goblins below who threw their friends). He's left hanging on his sword, which is still buried in this undead god; just the one attack possible. In Gnog's mind's eye, though, *a memory of the first letter they gave to Gibo and Bebe's mother, her proud tears, "they've got their father's intellect"*.

Above us, Kefnet has summoned meteorites. They streak across the sky, smashing into things. More mayhem. Lighting strikes pound down. People are getting hammered. All Gnog can really think of is that the goblins will be sacrificing themselves to break the lazotep.

Strangely, Gnog then hears a telepathic message. Jace. "I'm bringing him through. He's going to be very exposed. I hope you guys have Oketra under control within the next minute or so..." and Gnog, trying to clarify his thoughts hastily, thinks back, "...we're doing the best we can; lazotep is down, at great cost; engaging properly now" and he jumps in to join Gideon! Same sort of move. He hits via Rage Of The Champion, but only 14 damage; as the axe sinks, in his mind's eye, *Gibo and Bebe standing in front of Ral, nervously holding out a stack of papers with their experimental ideas.*. Hits again, only 16. Low rolls. *A memory of the first letter our party gave to Gibo and Bebe's mother, her proud tears, "they've got their father's intellect"*. Gnog figures, might as well guard my crew, shouts "see you back on the roof!" to Gideon and flies back up. This time he doesn't leave melee range though.

Oketra uses a legendary action, the bow again; lets loose another one into a crowd of angels up in the sky. At least one falls immediately.

Fee-Ree is looking to the Dreadhorde. She shouts, "Gideon, duck *upwards!"* and throws a fireball at Oketra's feet. 37 damage potential. It takes a lot of exposed Dreadhorde out on the ground, if a little close for comfort to Gideon; just 18 to Oketra, who dodges some of it. She flies around a little, to the left, within 30ft of Oketra and within Gideon's protection. Gnog sees it hit. *Gibo and Bebe laughing and happy at the successful test of the resonance principles in a P6 warehouse.*

Taz follows suit, but to the right; then casts - what the hell, worth a try - old friend Psychic Lance, DC20 Int these days. Oketra fails the save! A legendary resistance must be used instead. A weird 7d6 roll with lots of 4s! 27 damage -> 13 taken. Bardic inspiration to Gideon again, who is in a precarious situation, to say the least. Gnog sees the flinch. *Gebo and Bebe nervous but delighted when the test of the disruptor works at the lab*.

Commotion to the right. Bontu is *running* into the front lines. No sign of any more lazotep damage.

Deni takes aim. She hits. "Finally!". 53 damage. That's more like it. Gnog sees it land. *Gibo and Bebe handing Gnog the last letter for their mother, which she never read in front of us.*

Gideon yanks out his sword and as he starts to fall swings it straight back in. He hits, divine smite again, 28 damage (even with radiant being halved). *Gibo and Bebe pouring over fragments of equipment and remaining documentation in the Izzit lab in P5.*

Gnog gets ideas above his station. He reckons he could handle one of those giant "god-killing" arrows in his rage. But in our haste and the confusion we didn't get any out of the bag of holding. Yet, down below, a wagon with some on. What the hell; he drops his axe on the roof, flies down to the wagon and then tries to manhandle one of the arrows as a makeshift spear/javelin, intending to jab it in a melee range. *Gibo and Bebe's exchanged looks - "we'll make it work".*

Recklessly, he charges in and tries to stab with it. 9,9+11 -> miss. Second attack. *Just* scrapes in a hit. What's the damage of a god killing arrow? 8d10+5, apparently. He gets a solid 51 damage (including Great Weapon Master rerolling a 1 and a 2 as a 6 and 10). *Gibo and Bebe shouting up, "Remember us".*

To Gnog's surprise and, almost, shock, Oketra falls. She collapses backwards into a building! Fortunately, not into us or our building. Gnog would really love to grab more of the arrows out of the wagon, *but* there are Dreadhorde everywhere and Gideon, still hanging off his sword, falls with her. The building she hits is crushed, Dreadhorde all around. Fee-Ree and Deni start firing repeatedly, Taz too, and Gnog runs up to Gideon to get him back up. They come down and keep up a defence, but we need a way out of here. The goblins say they can get down into cellars and think they can find a route back.

Gnog checks in with the remaining goblins briefly. He had Gibo and Bebe make a list of the people in the lab - is that... Where is it? It's in the lab. They know where. Taz casts Bless on the three of them for help, while the goblins run off, hiding rapidly amongst rubble and getting lost in the chaos.

Gnog can't think too much about this. No freezing today, not like when the platform fell. Push the feelings aside... *Again. Gibo and Bebe shouting up, "Remember us".*

He coughs, trying to cover up the inadvertent sudden sob as he breathes in. Steadies his voice... "Next closest god is a problem; probably Kefnet, but how do we get up there?". Kefnet is way up high. Two angels on either side. Very difficult. Fee-Ree figures she can fly us up, and we think the goblins would be on the parhelion. Taz says he can use the Dulcimer (since he realises the goblins must have had time to get to the inn cellar and drop down). Gideon says he won't come up - he's going to head towards Bolas and find Mu and Teferi. "Good luck" says gnog. Gideon puts his hand on Gnog's shoulder. "They won't be forgotten." "Damned right." Gideon runs off.

Fee-Ree re-casts Fly, as does Taz; we all fly up as fast as we can - Gnog diverting briefly to fetch his axe off the roof! We need to locate the goblins - perhaps on the parhelion; perhaps being carried by angels; the opposing angel groups up here are already engaged of course. Lots of spectres too.

Gnog, perception 27. Vitu Ghazi. What's left (shit) of the Verdani seem to be making a bee-line to stop Bontu charging. We see an incapacitated but recovering Niv above the Chamber already. Gnog grabs the four-way sending stone. "Everyone. Lazotep devices work. Suicide bombs though. Goblins need to be close. Thrown in. No other way" - and as he says it, there's a now-grimly familiar flash and shockwave around Ronas. Secondary explosions happen shortly afterwards; a shrieking sound as Ronas is injured. His staff strikes down into the ground but the lazotep is already shattering away. The embalmed, cobra-headed god is revealed. Flitting around, a blue and white radiant ball of energy, spells flying off - fire and ice.

As we fly up, Gnog stows his other weapons and draws a cumbersome god-killing arrow out of his bag of holding. A fireman flies past - "good work taking down the cat!" "We need to get the goblins..." "...they're on the parhelion, being loaded into a catapult!" - and we head that way, as that sounds *very* failure-prone. As we get close we see brave goblins standing by trebuchets.

Aurelia is there, on a raised courtyard at the front of the fort, commanding. She hails us. "I was told that you took down the archer" "Yes, but at cost. We need to help the goblins." "Yes... Yes, how? They have asked if they can be loaded into catapults, but I don't see how that would help!" and Gnog has to explain the grim reality. Aurelia understands; "That is the greatest sacrifice anyone can give..." - sombre, after a moment, she adds, "...perhaps a more precision delivery is in order, then" and turns to Feather. Some messenger angels are called from her department. They'll take the goblins by air. "We'll give you cover", we say. Deni asks, "do we really need *all three* to go off?" and the goblins say, "If we can drop precisely, probably only one, but we don't want to risk missing."

They'll fly separate attacks, then. Three tries instead of one big bang.

Unfortunately all this coordination took time. About 6 minutes, the fly spell is running low. Aurelia casts a blessing of flight on the four of us; this gives us spectral wings which we've seen people use before. Wings of light. Fancy. They'll last as long as Aurelia is able to concentrate.

We depart. Feather and the two Messenger angels carrying three engineers, going in three different directions. Us, a running leap off the battlements - they have little runways, made for it! - **and we fly directly towards Kefnet**.

Closer... Closer. Kefnet has turned towards us. The two other angels who split off have turned to face off the God.

Gnog reaches 100ft and rages. "We need to clear a path; draw Kefnet's attention. Same gameplan. Hit him with everything we've got and take the pain, so they don't have to!". In our group, we form up with Feather behind. We're trying to avoid straight lines or being too close, but Taz is using Gnog as a bit of cover; about 30ft behind, just about. Fee-Ree veers off to right to help guard that angel and goblin. Maybe 80ft away. Deni's a bit closer to the left, 50ft maybe, bow drawn to guard the angel there and the goblin.

**Initiative order is held from Oketra's battle.**

Kefnet throws chain lightning, targets Gnog. Taz is within 30ft, nobody else fortunately. Taz scrapes a save with BFS, so 40->20 damage. Gnog fails, taking 40->20 via raging resistance. 

Gnog uses his full turn to get with 20ft of Kefnet... Who flies right up to him (legendary action), closing the gap completely. Eep!

Fee-Ree flies close to her goblin/angel pair. Her crown of stars is still up but the radiant damage we were hoping to be effective against *undead* Gods didn't have the impact she expected. Instead, she casts L6 Globe Of Invulnerability around her and the two people she's protecting. She's able to fly herself so she's about 10ft in front of the angel and goblin, keeping pace.

Kefnet attacks Gnog with its staff. Of course, it hits; 14->7 damage - perhaps rather less than Gnog expected.

Taz casts L4 Psychic Lance - same playbook but we want to get its attention; and if we're lucky it might force a resistance to be burned... But unlike Oketra, this time the God resists. 25->12 psychic damage, all the same. Bardic Inspiration to Feather - unless we get past the Lazotep, we're screwed.

Deni attempts to actually gain insight on the god's fighting style. She succeeds! He's dangerously close to Gnog, Taz and Feather now so she flies up higher to draw attention upwards and attacks. Doesn't do anything - poink, off the armour. AC30 is hard.

Then - and we'd forgotten about these two - are the Amonkhet dark angels. One flies up towards Deni, and gets within melee range. It attacks. Hit, miss. She doesn't burn her reaction with spectral wings. 7 bludgeoning and 18 radiant damage.

It's Kefnet's turn to act fully. He casts Dominate Person on Gnog - and Taz (Arcana insight 26, it's L5) casts L5 Counterspell. Kefnet's attention immediately diverts to Taz!

The other dark angel is heading for Fee-Ree and attacks. She reacts with a shield to deflect it. Then *our* angels move. The one on Deni's side has a clear line of sight to head in - Deni made a gap by drawing the angel away; Taz drew Kefnet's eye; Fee-Ree has the other angel. The angel zooms in; the goblin is frantically pressing buttons, makes eye contact with Gnog, looking terrified; the angel throws the goblin and Gnog sees it smash the glass ampule and press *all* buttons - and vanish. THOOOM. Gnog's right by it, deafening almost. We're thrown back 15ft. The lazotep shatters.

Gnog: Damn. **He was terrified.** *Third time. Gibo and Bebe shouting up, "Remember us".* That's... Gotta focus... 

The angel swoops in to grab the goblin's body. As it tries to fly away, Kefnet reacts and hits with an opportunity attack; the angel is badly injured but keeps flying; Feather behind shouts, "FULL RETREAT!" and the other two pile away.

Gnog is holding his stupidly large javelin thing. So he moves forward and tries to spear, twice; reckless; dirty 30. A hit. A whopping 8d10->64 damage. He tries again. Only 22 but unlike Oketra - another hit and a solid result with a reroll; 55. Action surge! A solid hit for 25. With re-rolls a great 56 damage; and Kefnet starts to fall, yanking the arrow/spear out of Gnog's hands.

Is that it? Is it done?

As it falls, Kefnet's eyes go dark as its head falls backwards and down. The wings, no longer held out by magic, just go limp and collapse. Gnog follows it down, yelling as loudly as he can for people to clear the way underneath! Kefnet falls faster than we can fly; our view of him shrinks; and Gnog realises that he's looking **directly at the crag below** - **we're right on top of Bolas**.

Bolas' spell casting pauses. Runes dissipate. The eyes narrow. He blasts out a wave of dark back gas, or something; the breath weapon? Fuuuuuuck. A huge plume of black is thrown up - Kefnet's body is shredded into dust. Dex saves all round:

* Gnog 19 (dodges)
* Taz 14 with BFS (Fee-Ree reacts to help with another D4) -> 18, he dodges
* Deni dodges
* Fee-Ree's globe prevents anything from hitting her; this particular attack is a necrotic spell, then, not a breath weapon.

No damage at all! L5 necrotic spell with no effect if dodged. Amazing.

Skies above clear. The storm just fades out. Kefnet is truly dead.

Gnog is thinking that we should aid with Bontu, since they seem to be having trouble - its lazotep is still up. Perception 27; a vanguard of artefacts, or constructs, with a couple of Boros legions appear to have made an arrowhead formation and smashed into the Dreadhorde leading to Bolas. Near the rear, Mu is visible. They're making a direct line to two characters, who somehow are much closer to Bolas, and back to back, glowing brightly - paladins - wait - Ajani and Gideon!

Gnog points and shouts, "Ajani and Gideon! Head to them. Mu Yanling close behind!"

Gnog figures that getting to Bolas with Mu from *behind* the spearhead, then it'd be a long slog to meet everyone and get into position with Bolas. So, instead, he figures best bet is to join the two paladins and help the spearhead break through more quickly, then surge on to Bolas and see if we can get our plan there into action. No sign of Teferi though.

About 200ft; takes a few long seconds. On the way down, perception 18; there's shadow moving around us. He looks behind; two Amonkhet angels chasing. Gnog shouts "Watch out, behind!" and turns to meet them, drawing Stormbringer. Still raging; one's in range; he flies in and attacks. 13+11 damage, the lighting taken in full. Good. He strikes again. 16+7 damage. Fee-Ree twins Firebolt. Both hit, for 29 each (with a sorcery point reroll). No resistances help here; these aren't gods.

Taz turns and throws eldritch blasts at the furthest. Unbelievably - *three natural ones* are rolled in succession. Gnog just heres Taz go, "What the actual fuck?!"

Deni meanwhile, rebalances the universe with a nat 20 against the angel in melee with Gnog. 71 damage. It's down. The other one flies up to Gnog and attacks him. The first misses; the second would hit but Gnog reacts with wings - he has two sets briefly! Gnog responds with reckless swings, hits for only 16 damage, hits again for only 19.

Fee-Ree crits with a firebolt! 8d10, 49 damage. Taz tries *again*; this time, he manages to just get in hits, 35 damage - it goes down. Yay.

We continue down to Ajani and Gideon, landing with our fancy wings nearby; now we're all encircled by Dreadhorde. "Why do you guys have wings?" shouts Ajani. "Because we're fabulous!" says Gnog. "Where do *I* get wings?!" "Ask at the Parehelion; there's a special on". "Here to help?" "Hell yes" "OK! Make the circle bigger!"

So Ajani, Gideon and Gnog widen the circle to protect Deni, Fee-Ree and Taz inside.

Gnog attacks the biggest thing nearby. A miss and a hit for 14 (Gnog knows that Stormbringer's lightning is less effective on the Lazotep). The dreadhorde are backing away from Gideon but coming in for Ajani and Gnog. We're using 5-10ft of motion every round to keep our "triangular circle" rotating around, to counter that.

It seems we have Bolas' attention down here too. "Fatal mistake, interrupting my spell!" he states (echoing in our heads) - and then there are terrifying images of death and dead, flooding our minds. Wisdom saving throws all round - were it not for us all being part of Heroes Feast. The fear has no effect; we push it back from our minds. "Pft. Parlour tricks. Very well. Lets see you face your *real* fears."

The dreadhorde parts. Rising, crawling up from under the crag are undead. Not lazotep. **Ravnicans**. *That's where the dead bodies went.* Perception is only 11. A mixture of people... Amongst tattered armour and clothes, one shambling forward half the body charred, Izzit high ranking armour. A gadget on its arm. It's unmistakably Ral. **Gibo and Bebe. "Remember us"**. Yes. *FUCK* this. We *REMEMBER THEM*. Gnog shouts, **"We remember them. We remember them as they were. And now we must set them free of this nightmare."**

Ajani pounces forward with his double axe, swinging rapidly to clear the way, shouting as his axe flares with bright radiant light, casting "Destroy Undead". The Dreadhorde are unaffected, but a lot of the ex-Ravnicans are seared and turned to dust. Bolas then casts Finger Of Death at Ajani; Taz Arcana 22; 7th level. He can't really do anything about it. Ajani doubles over in pain (some 80 necrotic damage in one go), falls to his hands and knees, drops his axe; Gideon runs forward to lay hands on and heal him. Gideon shouts up to Bolas - "This entire world is rising against you. You are not wanted here! You're not wanted *anywhere* Bolas!" but Bolas just laughs; "I don't care what anyone of you wants" - he casts **Power Word Kill** at the stricken Ajani. Gideon flares up; he has a Death Ward ability; a strange shield of arcane invulnerability blocks the spell to prevent death. It shatters as the power word spell impacts, but it has done its job.

Gideon looks to us. "COVER ME!" he shouts. He drops his weapon and pulls out the black blade, then flies directly at Bolas.

Behind us the vanguard of Bolas smash through. Gnog shouts, "MU! ON US, RIGHT NOW!" as loudly as he can "AND GET TEFERI" (a quiet sound in his head - "I'm here") and he looks to his party - Deni saying, "I have no idea what's happening right now" and Gnog says, "This is it. The last bit of plan. Here we go. Follow Gideon in. Good luck."

We run in - well, fly; he's up on a crag, after all.

Artificers in the Boros group come forward and are throwing spells at him; but it all just explodes and bounces off the shell. Bolas laughs. He's enjoying this. Entirely unafraid. He thinks it funny. Gnog is really encouraged by that. He really *is* that arrogant. He really *does not* suspect, yet, what we're up to.

Before we get close, though, his necrotic breath sweeps across. It's grim - at least half the Boros are wiped out, just like the platform. Gnog can only really glance briefly, but can't bring himself to look closer. Bolas then shouts, "Liliana! Bring me the gods!" - and suddenly we realise, standing on a dais in front of him, emerging from shadow, looking perfect and amazing as before, is Liliana. Glowing tattoos on her face. The power of the chain veil shimmers. She raises two hands and calls to the gods and dreadhorde. The two remaining gods and Dreadhorde turn and start to head our way. "Shit", shouts Gnog, "Why are Ronas and Bontu still up?!"

Gideon flies *through* the globe of invulnerability and shoves the Black Blade into Bolas. **It shatters**. Gideon looks shocked... He was expecting to hold onto the blade, so starts to tumble to the ground; Bolas flicks him aside with a wing and he scrapes along the ground close to us. Bolas says "The black blade? You really thought that legend of the Blade being able to kill an Elder Dragon was true? *I* created the Black Blade. You fool! Is *this* your big plan?" and he laughs - out loud. Thunderous and nasty. (No, Bolas. It's not.)

"Insolence. I should have killed you on Amonkhet..." - he starts pulling together necrotic energy, but Liliana runs forward. "NO! THIS WAS THE DEAL! YOU LEAVE HIM ALONE!" - Bolas replies, "No, I think not" - and a lance of pure necrotic energy strikes into Gideon. He withers before our eyes. Liliana is running forwards; Gideon tries to put up defences; Taz is flying straight towards him to try and get in some on-touch healing; it's like rapid ageing, horrible to see; he's weak on the ground. Dying before our eyes. Lilian makes it up to him, picks him up. "No... No!" she says. **"NO! I was going to save the universe for *US*!"** and she turns back to Bolas. The chain veil glows brightly; her eyes burn with rage; Taz hears her muttering, **"There's nothing to live for. Dreadhorde, Gods - KILL BOLAS!"** - and the entire hoarde turns as one.

Bolas of course just responds, "Poultry, meaningless." He pulls onto the power of the chain veil. "You've forgotten. Your soul belongs to *me* - you signed your contract!" - and *rips her soul out of her body*. She falls to the ground, next to Gideon; dead. Both have fallen. **Taz stands there, looking at two dead people.** It's a defining moment for Taz, though we don't know it yet.

Liliana's last act, though, stands. The Dreadhoard and gods are going for Bolas.

Strange. The skies shimmer. We feel it - the Immortal Sun field has collapsed. Gnog calls out, "Ha! It falls!" - ut realises that Bolas will probably cotton on...

...And Bolas, busy with slaying Dreadhorde, stops and actually looks surprised. "No. What?!" - he looks to New Prahv. His eyes narrow. He takes off and flies. Not on the crag now; the gods turn and lumber after him, as do the Dreadhorde, but much slower than he flies of course. He lands on a tower, causing fair damage, reaches down; grabs the fake immortal sun - crushes it. **ROARS IN RAGE**. He takes off (more damage) and heads *straight for all of us, planeswalkers and our group* - Gnog shouts, "BRACE YOURSELVES! THIS WILL BE ROUGH!"

Necrotic breath just carves through, destroying everything in the flight path. We finally get to see him in terrible action, in the open, in full rage. Then out of nowhere, a streak of bright red coming seemingly out of nowhere smashes into his side - Bolas crashes to the ground. Above flies **Niv Mizzet**, raking at him with his claws. We're running in, all chaos around, as fast as we can, Taz (head reeling from what just happened with Gideon and Liliana) thinks to Mu - very calm and polite, almost eerie, detached - "Hello Mu Yanling. Please be ready to take down the Ward on the Eye between his horns. Also please position Teferi appropriately. Thank you."

We can see we need to cause a LOT of damage. We have to make him worried. We need to be either inside the shield or dispel it, but seems too high level for it. Gnog's stowed Stormbringer and is trying to get another arrow at. The two are roaring at each other. "You'll die again!" shouts Bolas; "No!" replies Niv, "Not happening on *my* world!" and Bolas just starts pulling *ridiculous* amounts of magic as Bolas unleashes another necrotic lance. Feeble Mind, Taz thinks; can't help with that; Niv sees it coming and shatters the incoming spell. It's curious - at that moment, we see sigils from the various guilds visibly circling to form a shield. He clearly has the Powers Of The Guildpact.

Niv continues, "No. When you are on Ravnica, *you* obey *my* laws" - and **shatters Bolas' invulnerability shield**. To Gnog's surprise, Nissa is nearby - the Selesnyans had given chase once Bontu turned to get to Niv. She calls out "His shield is down! Fire at will!" and a hail of arrows fly out.

Gnog has his god killing arrow out now. Rage-fly in. He has wings, but gets more distance that way. Perception 26. From his left, emerging out of Deadbridge Chasm, smashing through the roof of Gore House - **a massive demon flies out towards Gnog**. Its eyes make contact with Gnog and Gnog shouts "Rakdos! Nice to see you!" as it flies under  him, **picks him up** on his back, and the demon says, "I can get you to Bolas. His fire causes no harm to me. Hold on tight!" and Gnog replies, "Will do, sorry we didn't see you earlier, we were a bit busy!" "I know - I was watching... This will be *glorious* entertainment!" shouts Rakdos in response. Gnog grips the arrow across his body, pinning it under himself as he grabs onto any number of chains and leather straps around the demon's body.

We hurtle towards Bolas; necrotic breath is released, but Rakdos is immune and the body shields Gnog. He flies *right* up to Bolas. The other two gods, now, have made their way in too; Bolas is having to fight them off; dreadhorde crawl onto him. Bolas, at this, takes off, so the dreadhorde fall away like ants. Rakdos tilts up, giving pursuit. Gnog can fly up to try and get in a melee attack. (Way behind, his party follows). Gnog goes for it - lets go of Rakdos, grabs the arrow and flies in to attack.

Reckless. **CRIT**. Two extra weapon dice, so 8d10 -> 18d10 + 5 (2d10 from Brutal Critical). 104 damage; highest Gnog's ever done. Bolas looks down at Gnog and flings Gnog away, the javelin lost; no second attack. He's only mildly injured! Gnog looks behind, but his party is too far away to hear him. Suddenly Rakdos thumps into him. So Gnog pulls another arrow - the last one - and as Rakdos swings around, tries again. Takes about 12 seconds - two rounds. Planeswalkers are now up here, too, surrounding, attacking. Fire and ice, not doing much, but trying to distract if nothing else. Lightning arcs back towards them, but they're still up. He's beset and being pecked at by a thousand birds. Streaking stars fly out from behind - Gnog realises Fee-Ree is launching everything she has left. Deni is nowhere in sight, but Gnog has to hope that Mu Yanling and Teferi are with her and doing what they need to do.

Gnog perception 16, on the way back in. He can't see much else around. Tunnel vision. He *hates* this thing. Hates it more than he's ever hated before. Unhealthy. The critical hit gave blood lust. **"REMEMBER US"** - hits once for 58. Bolas reacts immediately with Hellish Rebuke. Gnog sees the spell casting coming, fortunately, dex save fail though despite advantage, so Gnog takes 6d10 fire damage. 35->17 fire damage. Gnog pulls out the arrow/spear and goes again, shouting to Bolas as he does it, "THIS IS FOR EVERYONE YOU KILLED". He hits once more, 52 damage.

A voice in his head - from Deni! - "Don't worry. I'm here. I'm just hiding." and Gnog thinks back, "All good. Keep wits about you. Betrayal still possible." "I don't want to give my position away until the last minute." "Very wise. *Godspeed Tumble*."

Jace flies up. Illusions are being weaved. Four versions of himself. He's throwing ice damage of some kind at Bolas; an illusory dragon appears too, rearing up behind. It's just crazy up here; damage upon damage; spells everywhere. Then Gnog sees Taz fly up, *winks* at Gnog and Gnog sees the old friend Psychic Lance cast out. Bolas succeeds his save though (despite only +4 INT - rolled a nat 20, dammit) and Bolas is resistant to that, only 7 damage, but it's damage all the same. Bardic inspiration to Gnog.

Bolas now casts a spell at Gnog, who is up-close and personal and doing fair damage. A green energy, sickly looking, swirls around and slams into Gnog's chest. With inspiration, Gnog gets a 20 save, but DC is 24; 57 damage (after halving). Ouch. Fuck this guy. Yanks out the arrow and stabs it right back in. Hit, for 53 damage; hits again for a solid 60.

Bolas' turn (yeah, that 57 damage was "just" a legendary action). Finger Of Death. Gnog matches the con save DC of 24 to take half damage. 7d8+30 -> 55 -> 27 -> 13. Gnog calls back to Taz, "Ummm, maybe a little help?!" - but Bolas isn't done and tries to grab Gnog with his claw. Would hit for 22; wings; bounces; second attack 24, can't do anything, it hits. 16 slashing -> 8, int save 21 but even with a Nat 20 Gnog couldn't save against 16 psychic damage. Gnog only has 36hp left. Bolas is grappling him.

Another volley from the planeswalkers, and Bontu leaps up to clamp her huge jaws on Bolas' tail; Gnog didn't realise we were so close to the ground. Bolas lets go of Gnog to try and fend her off. Gnog is flying and keeps pace to keep close to the last of the god-killing arrows. Dex save 15, not enough, Gnog gets batted by a wing and is flung away, taking 9->4 damage, 32hp left. Thrown 60ft away - more than a round to get back to Bolas.

Taz's turn. He gets in *three* Eldritch Blast hits on Bolas, for 34 damage, and seeing Gnog being beaten up, burns resources - perhaps unwisely - to try and L6 Healing Word (he can't get close enough for touch). 19hp heal. 51 total for Gnog. 

Fee-Ree continues to throw stars. She's only got about two left now. Firebolt had been tried and didn't work; he seems immune to fire. But she sees Eldritch Blast work after Taz's attack; force damage works. Ah, yes! God, or god-like things! Damage type matters. She casts Bahamut's Claw; no wild magic search. She basically punches him! Hits, for 4d8->27 (very high roll) damage.

Bolas looks over at Taz. **He casts Disintegrate**. Taz can't possibly make the dex save. He takes *65* force damage, seriously fucks him up, shattered glass panels, heavy dents and scoring, some surface parts even melt; 33hp left.

Gnog shouts, "No you fucking don't" and flies in, perception 27. He sees an arrow within reach. Easy. Two reckless attacks. Hit, 52 damage. Again. Hits. 51 damage. Hellish Rebuke reaction again, dex save; 23, needs 24; but Fee-Ree is close by now, sees it, blows 2 sorcery points to add a d4. Only rolls 1, but that's enough to just dodge the worst. Damage is 30->15->7.

OK, so, not too bad - but now Bolas acts in full. Another wave of necrotic damage goes Gnog's way; his last bit of luck saves him from the worst of it. 30->15->7.

Gnog sees that, at least, Bolas does look somewhat injured. There are gashes, frost marks, burn marks from radiant damage; he does finally look a bit battered. Niv Mizzet calls out in everyone's minds suddenly, "GET CLEAR OF HIM NOW!" and Gnog reacts by pushing off Bolas as hard as he can. Adv athl check 21, which is enough. A ray of sun - sunbeam - smashes into Bolas from Niv; Gnog has to shield his eyes. It almost looks like a dragon's head shaped battering ram at the front, some artistry by Niv? Does a huge amount of damage, if Bolas' reaction is anything to go by.

**Another voice in the head. Jace this time. "He's injured enough. We need to take out that eye."**

A small portal opens - a strange flickering line in reality opening horizontally, then drawing upwards into a rectangle. Teferi emerges on a floating platform and starts to cast something... Time Stop.

What *we* all see is normal time - Mu Yanling casting her spell very quickly - but to us, it looks like a mirror around the Eye has shattered; shards of arcane crystal, or something, falling away, apparently physically manifested. Bolas actually looks *horrified* at this. For the first time. "What?!"...

**...and Deni aims, and fires.**

Nat 19. Not quite a crit. That's still enough. The +1 arrow flies true. **The gem shatters!**. **Abject *terror* on Bolas' face** as strange tendrils of contingency magic burst forth.

Gnog grabs the Ruby Eye out of his pocket and shouts "Bolas, you're too important to kill. Here! Sanctuary!"

Almost, given the expression on his face, *against* Bolas' will, tendrils of the magic start to turn and "reach" for Gnog, as Gnog flies forwards, gem in outstretched hand; Taz flying in close behind, Fee-Ree throwing spells, Deni flying in too; all of us going in for the final act. Mu Yanling has her hands aloft, her spell cast; Teferi grabs her to try and pull her away.

Niv throws another blast and many things happen very quickly!

* Jace appears next to us. Reaches out to touch us.
* ANOTHER Jace appears; an illusion of Bolas falling and burning. It's incredible, huge, bewilderingly realistic even though we know it isn't real.
* The spirit of Bolas goes into the gem.
* **The other Jace reaches us, grabs us, and all of us teleport.**

Suddenly, we're at the base of Nivix, in a ruined courtyard. Taz history; 17. Taz says, "This is the place Gnog. You must recognise it?"

Gnog shouts, "Fee-Ree, Deni, form up with me, circle around Taz, protect him at all costs. Jace! Watch your back!"

Jace says, "Right... Do you have the eye?" Gnog answers, "Yes." Jace says - **"We need to protect it. I can hide it."** Gnog answers, taken aback, "**No.** We need to push it out. Taz, construct."

Taz builds a small toy autognome. It looks like him, like a toy version. He starts muttering quiet instructions to it. Gnog looks to Jace. "Perhaps you kill yourself? Do you trust you?" "What? No. That's ridiculous!" he responds.

Taz finishes the construct. The two Jaces are there. We don't know which is which. Gnog asks, "Both have the same memories, Jaces?" No answer, but then, both say in unison, "*I'm* the real Jace!". Gnog asks Fee-Ree - "can *you* counter a counterspell?" "Yes. I can." Gnog asks Taz, "Are you ready to send the construct?" Taz nods, so Gnog hands the construct the gem. But as the construct is about to pick it up, there's a strange flash of illusion; the Jace to Gnog's left is now holding the gem. He says, "It's safer with me" and starts to run. The other Jace goes, "What?! Get him" and Gnog answers "No shit!" and flies after; meanwhile, Taz tries Hold Person and Gnog, at the same time, takes out the goblin's Azorious Charm, that Taz had passed on and does the same. "Bad Jace" escapes Taz's spell, but falls to Gnog's; and Deni has the chance to get her blade right up against its throat. The other Jace comes up behind and skewers the bad Jace with a blade.

Gnog looks down, points and says, "Yep. That's the blade..." - **the precognitive vision from so many days came true, exactly as we were shown.**

"Bad Jace" starts to melt; it turns into melting snow, weird. Taz arcana 34; a Simulcrum is made from ice. "So," says Taz, "did you betray yourself, or are you the betrayer and this was deliberate?!" - Jace picks up the gem and gives it to Taz. "I don't know what happened there... I don't know what happened. But once he was made he was independent... Something... He must have had an interaction with Bolas that I was unaware of at some point. I wasn't keeping an eye on him."

Gnog says, "Well, let's not waste time - if that's the worst of it, if that's the betrayal, we got off lightly!"

It was close though, Jace points out; the simulcrum still had a Teleport spell - (literally) lucky we stopped him so quickly. It wasn't part of the Heroes Feast so had less resistance to our own magic... Ah, so that would've helped us take control, then.

Gnog runs back to the construct, realising in alarm that it stands undefended. "Quick, form up!" he shouts, so the others do. Taz produces the tuning fork and says to the construct, quietly, "You won't be able to come back. I'm really sorry." and the construct nods. Taz casts his spell. The lights on the casing, and within, glow *very* bright, almost painful to look at. Green and blue. Sparkling. A pinhole opens. Then unravels somehow. It takes hold of the construct. Taz calls to it, "Travel well, friend. Goodbye." The tuning fork appears to be pulled in, consumed...

...But all we remember is that we were clustering against Bolas; Niv attacked; Jace came to teleport us away to safety.

Jace looks up. "Are you alright? We made it out just in the nick of time."

Gnog looks back, South, can't see much; Bolas has already fallen. "Is he... Dead? Did we do it?"

We start to walk, but Fee-Ree halts us. "Faster ways to travel" she says; "hey, Gnog. Did you ever take anything from Ajani?" - but he only had the axe, so she has to guess at it. We end up fairly close, anyway. A big area of P11 has been laid waste. The Dreadhorde are motionless; Bontu has fallen; Ronas is the last god standing.

Taz says, "This is strange, I feel sad; a sense of loss?" "We have lost so many today" says Deni. She puts her hand on his shoulder. "But look. Bolas has fallen."

There he lies. People gather. Niv speaks. "There will time to mourn for our fallen. We must take stock of ourselves first." He looks to the Boros gathered around. The Parehelion is lowering, angels flying down. People are checking each other. Aurelia is nearby. Our spectral wings fade as she sees us. "Battle master and Guild master of the Boros, Aurelia - Arrest Dovan Baan at once, under the charge of treason." Aurelia answers, "At once. Angels. Fetch him!"

Gnog approaches Niv. "Perhaps now is not the time... But... I'd like you to agree to something. To promise it'll be done."

Niv leans down. "I agree. What is it?"

"There are names. Of the Izzit goblins that helped us today. I'd like a statue. Something that represents them. Their names, and a mention of the many others. In the courtyard, outside Nivix, so all who enter or leave through its main doors must pass that statue, and never forget." Some nearby angels murmur assent. Feather says, "Yes, I conveyed one. He is still here. Many of his brethren sacrificed themselves for today's victory. We stand here today at the cost of their lives."

Gnog adds, feeling awkward, "It's just that - well the Boros and Selesnyans and others sacrificed more. It's just that the goblins are often overlooked. I'd like them not to be forgotten. I promised."

Niv nods. "Yes. It will be done. There will be many changes. I will have to step down too. I will appoint Ral's most trusted. She will lead the Izzet to a new future... I'm thinking; we should have a college; a college led by goblins, for they are very bright minds indeed. For all of their crazy inventions!"

Gnog says, simply: "Thank you" - holding back tears.

There's a pause. An incredulous moment. Someone breaks the silence. "Wow. Quite a clean-up". Indeed there is. Gnog turns to his party. "I think I'd like to stay a little while, just to see them get back on track; just to say goodbye; but then home, I guess?"

In the skies above, a sound. Faint at first; strange. Clouds parting. Gnog perception 28. Four beings, flying down. As they approach, Gnog recognises them; **it is the four Amonkhet sphinxes**! Gnog shouts out a greeting, "What? How did you get here?!"

"We sensed that access to this world had been restored. We shifted into the clouds above. We thought we could lend a hand, but it appears we are too late."

Gnog says, "Never too late for song and story."

"Perhaps we can help, maybe, to clear some of our own mess? I'm sure Naktamun would welcome the prodigal children home?" and Gnog looks to the Dreadhorde - "ah, yes, there *are* a lot of them, and they *are* your honoured dead." "If you trust us, we would like to open a gate." Gnog turns to Niv, "I trust them implicitly." Niv says, "I'm watching you! But you have my trust for now."

Two start to sing. The Dreadhorde start to gather around. Two more sing differently - "Gate" spell, literally, L9 - small; Ronas will only just be able to squeeze through; but beyond, Naktamun, clearly visible. Standing there, Samut, Manesh and, in the background, Hazaret. Gnog waves at them! They smile and shout, "Looks like good news?" pointing at Bolas. Gnog responds, "Yes. We did it" - and suddenly we hear, spreading like wildfire, a cheer from the other side. "The god pharoah has been killed!"

The sphinxes lead the dreadhorde away. It takes a long time, of course, which at least gives us a chance to rest. Gnog heals; Taz mostly mends; Gnog helps wipe off dust and gore. Soon, all is clear. Before the sphinxes themselves leave, they say, **"I'm glad that there may be a moment of peace and time for song. Things are not as they seem, but don't go chasing a long lost dream."** and Gnog says, "...Huh. OK!" The last one says, "Come and visit us some time. I think you would like Nakatmun in its restored verdant glory" - and the gate closes behind it.

In the midst of things, Kaya calls out "HEY! You guys! Here!" and we head over. "Found them!" she calls. Behind her, Taysa. "I can't believe this has happened" she says. "I can't believe what's happened! Dovan's been arrested. He is to stand trial - in his own guild, with a new Guild Master." "Who's that going to be?" "A sphinx!" "One of ours, or Amonkhet's?!" "One of ours. Not a precog, but a high judge." "Not death I hope? There's been enough..." "No, but it will be a harsh judgement given the crimes."

Taysa breaks even better news. **The spell didn't complete; so the souls were released, instead of consumed** - the Orzhov spirits all returned back and were, of course, freed. She doesn't know if every soul was returned, but Gnog hopes that it's the case.

"Anyone hear from Boboremos? The gruul?" "I think they're still in P1".

We're thinking of heading that way, but then a goblin comes up. We recognise him immediately from earlier - one of our three goblin guards. "We were looking for you!" - another close behind. "Are you very busy, sirs?" - Gnog says, "Oh, we're never too busy for you. And you never need to call me sir." "We wondered if you'd honour us by coming with us? It would be probably an hour." "You have as much of my time as you need."

We start to walk. A long way from D11 towards, we figure, P6. As we walk. More goblins form up as we continue. A few others start to join. Battered, bruised, dusty. A growing group. Pass what's left of Gore House. Into P6, the foundry area. The lead goblin asks us to wait a moment. "There's someone who would like to - we promised her that we'd find you."

Gnog braces for it - yes, it's the mother.

She comes up. Sad. She's been crying. Stands tall and proud though. Comes up to Gnog, smiles weakly, holds up her hand; he holds it. "Please. Walk with me." As we do, goblins part and form in behind us. A marching band - they have instruments. A dirge. Banners have been made. Each bears the name of a goblin that has fallen. Not just the Izzit - many. Two come up. One banner is handed to her - Gibo. One to Gnog - Bebe. She holds hers as high as she can; Fee Ree walks to help. Gnog raises his as high as he can. Deni, a slight loss, comes up to Gnog and they lock arms. Gnog asks Taz to walk in front of him. More and more goblins walk. A funeral march, in remembrance; as the sun sets, the lights across the foundries burning at full brightness in tribute to the brave fallen.

The mother says, "They might have made it to the tallest towers of Izzet. But it is always here, in our lowly origins, that our community is strongest. Where we will always rememeber what they have done to save all of Ravnica - and also, their own people. I am so proud of them. So proud!" Gnog answers "Me too." It's all he can manage to say. There are goblins, eventually, everywhere, holding hats against chests; on roofs, lining the streets, on catwalks, external stairs, everywhere.

We're at the head, with other engineers, but there must be over 100 banners of names stretching back as far as he can see. Many fallen.

The procession leads to the end. Krenko is there. He bows to the mother. "On behalf of all of our people here, we thank you for the sacrifice from your family. You've given all you can give. We will never forget." Then there are yells - "we will never forget!" and Gnog joins in. Drinks start to flow. The mood changes; they try to celebrate, melancholy but in rejoicing of the many names. They adorn warehouse walls at this end of the street. Sometimes goblins walk up and point to ones they know, telling stories to others; never forgotten.

So we don't go anywhere else. We stay here, to celebrate, mourn, and finally, fall asleep surrounded by our goblin friends.

### 32000 XP, but we're allowed to take 30000 each (L19) and give Taz an extra 6000 (L18)

(And Taz, at next long rest to level up, realises he doesn't need L8 Power Word Stun anymore; not his style; he wants L7 Teleport, so learns that instead).
