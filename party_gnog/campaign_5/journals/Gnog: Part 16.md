# Gnog: Part 16
## Day 44 (Ravnica 24, Riglan 81 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week)

We're at **Rainbow Falls**, a hotel-spa-inn-tavern overlooking Zonot Seven. We are due at the Chamber Of The Guildpact at 10am.

We start around 8:30am and head up for breakfast. In the calm, after a night of sleep, Gnog chats to Fee-Ree about the 'spark' that manifested, over adequate breakfast and adequate coffee `:-)` in a busy restaurant-bar-now-breakfast-room. She hadn't noticed anything different herself and is surprised to hear about her eyes changing.

Gnog also points out something we kind of missed in the moment - the Gruul union is great, and talking to the other guilds to start to try and draw them together is great - but that's happening because we did it; we formed the Four. It's happening, and we should catch up somehow with the Dimir to see what their progress is, since we've basically completed that part - so far at least - of our bargain.

After a relaxed breakfast we start to walk towards P1. It's a fairly long walk, but we have time and explore a bit over the interesting waterfall-laden area around us. We do need to buy healing potions but we realise they're more likely to be found in Blistercoils apothecary and we don't really have time to go out there; we might have to come back later. That said, since we're already walking out around all these amazing bridges and spires, Taz keeps his eyes peeled and (Investigation 14+5->19) he spots a herbalist shop that has a sign in the window. We head in to quickly check for what basic healing potions they have. They say they have 3 standard potions - that'll do for a start, though Gnog would feel safer with a few more - if only because sometimes, we need to hand them out!

We take the three, thankful for them, for 150gp. Gnog intends to give one to each other party member, but Fee-Ree points out that she's actually got some quite powerful healing ability now thanks to our "blessing" on the moon, so Taz gets two and Deni gets one.

We head via Smelting Quarter and Bulwark / Tin Street in the general direction of the Orzhova and Vizkopa Bank, hoping to find a way through to the 10th District Plaza beyond. Deni has no trouble. It's busy so takes a while. Gnog perception 15+8->23. He notices that the Boros presence in P6 seems reduced, which we had expected; but **a large Orzhov militia presence** in the warehouse district as we initially glance off the corner Medori Park (significant or not, given Karlov/Tesseret concerns?) to avoid a steep wall climb at the Zonot Seven / Smelting Quarter boundary. Later, **he notices fewer Azorious law mages** than he remembers seeing in Precinct 1 before. Perhaps they're being pulled elsewhere?

We get to the Plaza Avenue with time to spare. It's even more busy. There's a feeling of suspicion or concern, but we did see similar when we booked the appointment yesterday; tensions are high. Inside, there are lots of complaints and demands - they must see the living guild pact, etc. etc. - "*when* are you going to let us...", etc. etc.! We see lots of Azorious outside and in - ah, so, that's where they all are! Some have even decided to camp / sleep in the area outside and others are complaining about the people doing that. It's just a mess. We hope we're actually able to get our 10am meeting, since we get the feeling some people here have been waiting for theirs for a long time. Perhaps things are not as punctual - in the order of days! - as we might hope.

All we can do is try; inside, we head up stairs to the area we know about on the first floor for waiting, weaving between the throngs. An attendant there knows about our appointment and they "will be with us as soon as we can!" - Lavisha is just trying to calm people down, he says; and then we see her, over on the far side of the hall, trying to calm minotaurs who are yelling, dark elves getting involved and trying to get attention and so-on.

Taz moves out roughly into the middle, in fact a bit closer to the group hounding Levisha, and takes out his dulcimer. He starts to play what he hopes is a background, but calming, soothing sort of melody; to distract ears from anger, and towards calm emotions. He doesn't risk trying to *cast* that spell via the Mizzium Apparatus, because the consequences of it going wild in a crowded room would be almost certainly lethal! Instead, he tries to rely on his performance. Only gets a total of 12 even with BFS, due to a ratshit nat 2 on the d20 and nat 1 on the d4. It doesn't really distract anyone, but at least it doesn't make things worse!

Fee-Ree looks uneasy as things get more busy. She asks to go outside; Deni follows; Gnog isn't sure if the attendant will be able to find us; he gains insight that we're not going to be able to see Lavisha any time soon anyway, so gives up. He and Taz head out too.

Outside, even from the elevated viewpoint of the Champer steps, Fee-Ree and Deni are nowhere to be seen (Gnog perception 2+8). It's overwhelmingly busy, even for Ravnica. People are shouting, jostling; it's chaos. It's far too hot, it's far too noisy, it's far too busy. He looks to the sky, wondering about the moon; are people on the station OK? A lot of guilt at taking the only ship. So much to take in... 

Gnog feels Taz's hand on his calf and looks down but can't focus on him somehow. Dizzying, like falling into a whirlpool. Out of nowhere, Gnog feels pulled into a visceral daydream - he simply can't stop it...

### The daydream

...stood in the disruptor chamber with Ral, insisting it's the only option left, the only way to stop Nicol. It'll kill him as the bridge collapses, but they'll have to pull all power from the laylines. We argue back in horror; that could *completely destroy* Ravnica. "What is one planet for a universe?" says Ral, voice breaking and tears in his eyes. His crew stand on the floor below, looking up into the tower, listening silently, patient, grim-faced. We start to argue back - come with us, we'll fly out, we can use your skills, find another way - but he cuts us off; "My place is with my people. Your place is with yours. Thank you; we made it this far. At least, now, we can stop him - *really* stop him, forever. Tell everyone... Tell them what Ravnica did for them... Remember us... Now go. Go!" - and then without hesitation shouts down, "Switch main power to the Decamillenial Platform, set draw to maximum and..." - a brief pause, voice cracking again - "I'm sorry. It's been an honour working with you all..." - he looks at the spyglass set into the device, gasps at something, then shouts, "**Set for maximum power and fire immediately!**"

Fee-Ree and Deni are looking at Gnog, wild-eyed in shock. The tower shudders heavily and a loud whine emanates from over-stressed equipment. Fee-Ree tries to cast Teleport for the ship, but it fails; she cries out in fear, "Gnog! The weave is failing! The power around us? I don't - I can't..." and Gnog interrupts "...can we fly?" - Fee-Ree tries the simpler spell; "Yes!" she exhaults; and we run out to the balcony and jump. "Get further from Nivix!" she shouts, pointing to the District Ten Plaza, which Gnog can see is rapidly emptying as people seem to be fleeing from it in all directions. Looking behind as he flies, Gnog sees the shimmering distorted portal in the sky above, a kind of tunnel, legions of undead swarming along it, and with his keen eyes, makes out a taller character, very different, borne as if a king amidst the madness - Nicol Bolas himself. "It's him! That's why Ral didn't wait, he's here!" shouts Gnog. It doesn't make sense, of course; Bolas is a giant dragon; living creatures can't cross the bridge; it's a strange daydream, but it feels every bit as real as life itself.

As soon as we're on the ground, we can feel the earthquake. Buildings are coming apart. People are running and screaming, aimless, chaos. In the now-distance, of the giant suspended towers of Nivix cracks at the main building attachment point and swings down and inwards, crashing through the roof and scattering glass and debris over the building and streets below. There's a horrifying roar, suddenly; a giant fissure opens up nearby, people and buildings falling into it, then some kind of greatworm of an almost inconceivable scale crashes forth. Fee-Ree is casting Shield as blocks of masonary are thrown up then rain back down; Gnog crouches over Taz as Deni dodges behind Fee-Ree. For a moment we all look around in desperation, feeling the same - Deni starts, "But we have to help them... We..." - but she tails off. We can barely even stand now. More sounds of creatures. Howling and screeching. Destruction everwhere. Suddenly cutting through the din is a tremendous explosion as it looks like at least half of Nivix is consumed in a strange, blue-white fireball, but at the same time the shimmering tunnel shatters into a trillion pieces, glittering in the sun, then intense, red flames tear across its length, incinerating utterly *everything* in their path. In the brief moment he has to witness this extraordinary event, he sees only ash fall from the sky - no bodies - like black snow upon the crumbling city beneath. "THEY DID IT!" yells Gnog, "THEY DID IT!"

We are joining hands; Fee-Ree tries to teleport; and we're suddenly a few feet in the air above the cleared rubble next to the ship, disorientated by the sudden darkness of the tunnel and falling heavily to the ground. Taz brings up dancing lights immediately and Fee-Ree casts Light a moment later, but both of them are flickering strangely. Fee-Ree shouts, "Hurry, it's getting worse!".

We need no encouragement. The tunnel is coming apart. The roof is falling in chunks. Some are already on the ship deck but it looks otherwise undamaged. Taz is already helm-attuned; Gnog recognises this as another daydream inconsistency; he is almost a viewer of this, as if watching a precognitive vision; it is bewildering, why can't he wake up?!; yet also he is himself, seeing things from his perspective at the same time. We race on board. Taz starts up the wings and begins to pilot out. We get around into the main tunnel and for a moment we think we might make it, but a huge section of tunnel ahead collapses right in front of us, with a massive slab of rock crushing down onto the front of the ship. It's thrown to the ground, the front of the ship obliterated. Gnog screams out "TAZ!" in horror but it's far too late; there's just nothing left; Deni behind shouts, "Fee-Ree!" and Gnog whirls around to see her lying on the deck, blood streaming from an ugly head wound. He runs over and kneels down, pulling her onto his lap, cradling her head, telling her it'll be OK, he's there, it'll be all right, but she's unconscious; Deni dodges falling masonry to get alongside, crouching down, puts her arm tight around Gnog, his arm around her, together, for the last seconds; we hear another huge crack as the roof section directly above detaches...

### The awakening

"GNOG! **GNOG**! **GNOG WAKE UP!**" - and Gnog's still stood there, on the Chamber steps. Tazis shaking his leg, looking panicked and stricken, calling his name. "I'm - I'm here - I - What - ..." is about all Gnog can say; he falls to his knees and hugs the terrified Tazythus. "I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry. Something happened. I saw something *awful*. It's just... This place, all these people, it's not real." Starting to gather thoughts again now. "This planet seems to be having an effect, it's just like those dreams I talked about, they're just my imagination..."

They stay embraced for a while, then sit on the steps. "I was very scared", confesses Taz. "Sorry. I'm so sorry. Thanks for staying and helping to wake me." "Where are they?" he asks, presumably about Fee-Ree and Deni; Gnog sighs heavily. "I don't kn -" "- right behind you, what are you talking about?!" says Deni's voice. Gnog nearly jumps out of his skin, stands and spins around, sees Deni stood there, *bursts into tears*, grabs her in an embrace where she can barely even breathe and just says, "**you're alive**, thank the Gods..." - and seeing a very surprised Fee-Ree stood alongside - "**you're both alive**."

An awkward and confused moment for the two, doubtless; Gnog releases Deni, sniffs, clears his throat, wipes his eyes; "I - it's - a story for later - listen, please, we - we *must* fix this. We must make *this* work" (gesturing helplessly to the chaos around). "We must save this place. We must. These people, this planet. We can't let it fall. Whatever it takes. **Whatever** it takes, no matter my personal cost." He takes a deep breath. "I have to give my all now. Not to think of the ship or a teleport as a Plan B, not even to think of Arxcis and escape to find him if all else fails. **If this planet falls, then so will have I**."

He is perhaps going to continue, or the party will respond - but we are interrupted. **The crowd suddenly moves as one, and we are swept with them, pushed together, up the stairs - and we see, out of nowhere, JACE HIMSELF. The crowds have parted. He sweeps past and into the Chamber, people flowing in after; we're just caught in the current.**

People are whispering his name. **Jace! Jace is here!** The penny drops - for all of us, all at once. We aren't the poster boys here! It's not that we have no role or won't give all - it's just we aren't the centre of it. We have to work with many others. Not the heroes; we are part of Niv's plan, not ours. Skarrg and the Gruul felt like us being the victors again, but that's not what this is all about.

We try and push in, doing our best to get closer to Jace and Levisha; we still have to let her know and get the guild meetings sorted and, with Jace arriving, somehow get the "Five" together. Does he know about us? Why is he here now? Etc. etc - a million questions!

The wind taken somewhat out of Gnog's accidentally pompous sails! His plan to just go back in there and *demand* to see Levisha fades. He asks if he can pick up Taz; no problem; Taz starts doing the "excuse me, coming through" etc. thing - Persuasion 20. We make good progress through the crowd. Inside, the crowd have again parted. We're not far behind at all by now and get to the waiting chamber on the first floor, and he's approaching Levisha. She sees him - insight rolls are terrible; max from Taz is ten, max from Gnog is 4; "Welcome back", she says. "Quite crowded in here", he remarks - and the spell breaks. The hall erupts in noise.

We are close, so push further forward - try to catch her eye! - "Maybe now is the time to go somewhere a bit quieter; need an escort?!" shouts Gnog. Constitution-based (SHOUT!) persuasion, total 23. She's just about able to hear him over the noise. She gives me the "I don't have time for this" look. Gnog nods in acknowledgement, realising that there's no way the two of them can possibly leave the room - it'd be a riot - and she tries to get attendants to calm people down. It's not easy. Taz is able to slip between legs and touch Levisha's foot (!) to cast Enhance Ability (Eagle's Splendour), looking up and saying "This should help!" - she looks down and smiles.

Now she starts commanding the room to be quiet. Her presence is obviously more commanding all of a sudden. "Calm down. I need everyone to be quiet. I know you are all excited about Jace's return to the Chamber, but we will get nowhere with chaos. We will approach this in an *orderly fashion!*. We will not be attending to *any* requests until we can *have order back in the Hall*."

This works. Things quieten. More of a murmur of discontent, but no shouting. The message is spreading too, shushing noises and so-on.

"We'll here your concerns in due course. Present your tickets to your closest attendant and we will prioritise those who require decisions to be made binding by Jace in order of urgency. You *will* be seen *today*. Please exercise some restraint and patience as you can see he *is* here."

Jace has walked up to stand next to Levisha and is thus right next to Taz. "Lost control of the city a bit have we?" Taz just says, "Oi! We're supposed to be working with you, y'know, so don't give her any trouble, it's not her fault at all - if anything it's yours!"

He looks down at Taz in surprise. The cowl of his hood on his cloak falls back as he does. He has a boyish, dark-brown side parted short hair, soft, dark brown eyes too; they glow blue for a moment. "Oh. I've seen you before." "Precog. Niv's plan maybe." "Yes. I have seen you before in the future." "Yes. Most likely. Our situation is grave and urgent, well above any trivialities of others in this chamber." "But not really, because *this* is the ripple." He projects into Taz's mind the illusion of a ripple in reality spreading out, hitting all other little things causing chain reactions. "You don't know what tiny event will have the biggest impact. Even the smallest of people or events could be the key." Taz answers, "This is true and your point is well made. I myself stopped a Greatworm just yesterday! It was most unusual. We will present our ticket to an attendant and wait our turn."

Lavisha says, "Wait, what is your ticket?" "We just have a 10am with you!" but then adds, "Jace, the Four are formed! We need to organise a guild meeting!" He says, "Patience, little one. All will happen in its place in time." His eyes glow again. "The time for that is not now. Now..." - he turns to point at the minotaurs - "we have to solve their problem." Taz (gaining no insight of use, nat 1 rolled!) says, "OK. Sorry Levisha! What were you saying?" "Well, yes, um, we can meet! I just need to make sure that this mess is organised before I can take my own meeting." Taz says, "Of course, given what Jace says, we will wait as long as we must wait. Please do not worry about us."

So Taz wanders off to leave them to it and relays to the party. All we can do is submit the ticket, say it's important and would need Jace, but suspect everyone is saying that. We'll wait as long as we need to wait. As we do, we see Jace is engaged in conversation with the minotaurs. They're describing the problem, blaming the Orzhov crowd of overstep and encroachment into their territory - parts of the city / services, duties, authority - that belong to them as Boros. Their private militias go too far. It gives the Orzhov too much power over too many things; surely a contravention of the Guild Pact. Jace asks Orzhovans who stand alongside why they've extended their militia; they argue it's within their power and means. Jace says that it is *not* within the Pact agreement, though; they must cease and only use the militia within Orzhov regions, not in areas outside. As he does this - makes this kind of ruling - a bright blue/silver cord/piece of string appears as an illusion above his head; then it pulls taut over his head, stretching across both sides - Orzhov and Boros - and we can tell that this is some kind of magical binding. We witness for the first time the actual power of the Living Guild Pact.

Lavisha has been speaking with attendants and arranging the tickets. A small pile is handed to another attendant. "These should be for Jace." But Jace says he doesn't need them - he knows who he must see. Taz once again works between legs of the crowd to get alongside her and quietly looks up and asks, "Are you OK? This must be frustrating..." "No. I guess it's fine. He's been away for a while. This is how it should work but we had to use a different system while he was away. I forget that he knows exactly what he needs to do." As Taz is talking, another ruling is made; and a third group is presenting. Then another decision. Then to our surprise, he turns to *us*. "You're next". Taz says, "gotta go!" and runs back hastily.

Jace says, "Private chambers". He turns and walks towards the stairs that lead to the private chamber floor. Levisha grabs our ticket, trying to keep her system going in case he just disappears again. The five of us chase after Jace, Levisha pushing ahead - she has the room key! We go in. Not the same room as before, but similar.

Inside, Jace turns and says, "In this reality, has Niv arrived?" Gnog answers, "We didn't even know you had - the Dimir didn't tell us. It's possible, but we haven't heard direct word from Nivix about that. We can check if you like." He stops, his eyes go blue again, then he says, "He's here. But didn't follow me. Preceded me? Before me. Yet he arrives after. He's injured... We have four days." Gnog says, "Until the attack? The invasion?" "Until the future goes black." He turns to Lavisha, "Issue the Call for a Guild Summit at Noon in two days." Gnog says, "Funny, Lavisha, that's why we were here - the Four thought we needed to call this." Jace says he knows and just saved the time. Gnog confirms, "So I guess you know all about us Four, and perhaps are prepared to work together as The Gatewatch?" but Jace says, "You're not the Four, you're *one* of the Four." Gnog answers, "Oh, yes, we also have met Kaya, Nissa and Ajani, and all of us now work together. They each work on their own matters of import, trying to keep guilds functional." Jace stops and looks up. "Someone is going to betray us."

Gnog's blood runs cold. "Who?"

"I don't know. I can't see it. I do not yet have that memory. But I will soon."

Gnog asks if he knows of the precog vision where Jace is killed. Jace confirms, "You are not a threat to me." A strange answer. Gnog explains a bit more about the weapon appearing out of nowhere. Then using a *past* tense Jace adds, "I was not under threat." Gnog isn't sure what this means, but since he seems unthreatened, says, "Well, I guess that's good?!"

Lavisha walks behind Taz and says, "You'll get the hang of his speech after a while!"

Gnog asks, "We do not know what our next steps are, but with a meeting set, that is a start. Is there any other business or must you now attend to other things?"

Jace answers, "I know where you're headed. It's..." - he stops for a moment - "...but you will go somewhere else along the way. The Golgari have a key part to play. And you've already been to Rix Maadi but you didn't meet the right person. I will see you when we meet at Niv's tower tomorrow night. We are done. I see another door that needs to be closed."

Gnog says, "Thank you Jace. Until we meet tomorrow."

Jace turns to Levisha. "You know I love you very much and appreciate everything you do. I'm sorry I've been away for so long. I hope you understand and that you'll forgive me." He leaves. She's just left there kind of speechless. Gnog clears his throat a little awkwardly and says, "Interesting fellow. For what it's worth, we've come to appreciate you too."

"Well," she says, "it might not be the way you thought it would happen but - job accomplished - we will have a formal guild summit."

We learn that Jace tells Levisha what she needs to know when she needs to know it. Not his assessment; hers. He's somehow ineffably correct in such matters - well, almost in all matters. So we don't debate that; we don't now reveal all about Nicol Bolas, even though some of what we discussed must've seemed enigmatic. So we just thank her, remind her that if ever she needs our assistance, she shouldn't hesitate to call upon us, and leave.

The Dimir kept their bargain too.

As we're walking down the steps outside, Deni says, "Why did nobody ask him where he'd been or what he's done or why he's been away three years?" Gnog says, "Oh. Yeah. I didn't even think of that. Maybe tomorrow?" "But nobody asked. Not even Levisha." "Maybe *they* just accept it. Maybe they have so many immediate problems that those questions seem unimportant for the present. But *we* don't accept that, and *we'll* be looking for answers."

It's about midday.

So, Niv's back but injured. A swift trip to Nivix is in order, tho I'm sure Ral will be busy. We should go anyway. Jace says tomorrow evening, Niv's tower; well, OK, maybe we book that date in right now! Deni and Fee-Ree are also a bit rebellious - why should we go tomorrow night, just because Jace says so.

It's unanimous. We head to Nivix. Gnog perception 23 (on behalf of party). As we walk, the whole party picks up an undercurrent of concern. Under the surface level activities of everyday business, people know things are wrong. Gnog says, "Like last time, yes? Draakhorn? Same unease." "Except this seems to be individually affected, different people have different reasons I think" says Deni. Gnog nods, "Yes, good point, no one source; people are reacting individually to what they're seeing. I guess it's not too surprising, if the idea is for things to be at head when the invasion occurs; which by the sounds of it, might be four days away."

At Nivix, we head directly towards Ral's lab. Taz persuasion 28; he smooth-talks his way right to Ral's main lab door. They're closed. Gnog knocks awkwardly, in case of underway experiment. No reply. Try the door; not locked; peek inside; something's being mounted, trying to build something large. Gnog asks if he can help? Some of it looks heavy. "Sure! Push this bit in here!" and so-on. Gnog Athl; nat 1! Luck point. Another nat 1! Total is 11. People have to rush to help, but he's kind of got it - at least it's not dropped, just inelegant and made people nervous.

Ral's up on a scaffold. He's asking if everything is locked in and there are various checks. There's some kind of test firing apparently - "Just one single pulse to check!" - anbd we watch in anticipation. They activate the device. Around the room we suddenly notice that the entire lab is encircled with red crystals, because they start to glow. A second above it then glows, then strange resonant hums start; in the middle, the device starts to make crackling noises and light up. Goblins are running around wildly, making various quick measurements. A number is called - "14731.8!" - "Are you sure?" asks Ral - "Yes" "Yes I also had a similar reading" says another. Ral says "Good work" and asks them to start to unplug the device from its power source for safety.

He comes down from the scaffold and sees us. He asks if we saw the test; yes; we ask about the resonance; he confirms it was Gibo and Bebe's system and it's working. They can't do a full activation without actually firing it into the ether which could be Bad so all they can do is internal pulses/cycling; it's all working. Between the crystals and the resonance they have enough power and it *seems* to be stable enough. They can blast the disruptor.

That's amazing news, to say the least.

We let him know Jace is here and, in the privacy of his office, that Jace said Niv is back. He says we can go there now to say hello, basically! We head to the teleportation circle and appear in Niv's tower.

There is a creature here, some 40ft tall. Wings are spread out across part of the room. A long tail curls around the teleportation circle itself. This is a very, very large dragon. The scales are iridescent, blue and red crystalline. It's even more impressive a sight in person that it was in our earlier vision. There's almost a metallic look to them, but with a crystalline shine, as if anodised. Gnog clears his throat and says loudly, "Nivm Isset, I presume?"

A very large head whips around to look at us. It's probably 12 feet long. It comes right down to us.

"Ah! Ral! You've kept everything intact." - he actually sounds almost happy. Some kind of gaseous steam, or something, comes out of the sides of his mouth when he talks.

"Who are *you*?" he asks of Gnog. Gnog says, "My party and I are one of the -" but Fee-Ree *pushes* Gnog aside with her horned staff. It crackles with energy. She's **angry**.

"WE are the people YOU *called* here. You destroyed my life and now I'm part of whatever plot you have and I would *like* you to explain **why** we're here and **why** you thought it was alright to do what you did?" - she's trying to control herself but Gnog can see she's trying to convey anger / annoyance, but also control not just rage. Intimidation 18+10, 28! Gnog's almost scared. But Niv - Niv is *not* intimidated, but it gives him pause. "Ah. You are the Fourth", he says, "but where are you actually? It's not one of the four of you?" Gnog answers, "it's *all* of us".

"Hmm. It has been many years. I can't remember exactly what that vision was. But you made it! **Well done** (!)."

Taz looks a bit confused; Gnog, Fee-Ree and Deni bristle.

When he turns more to get a better look at us, we see he has a *bad* wound. A seeping mass of black veins emanate out from a hole in his hide near the shoulder, at the base of his neck. Taz seeing that is alarmed; Arcana with BFS, 18+5+4 -> 27. It is a nasty necrotic wound that won't heal without rest and time. It's not something he can use with a healing spell. Taz says, "I am sorry to see such a terrible wound; it will of course not respond to my lower-level healing magic". Niv looks down. "It speaks! Curious. Is it a... Is it a medical construct?" Gnog answers, "It's a fully sentient and possibly immortal being." "Ah. But is it a construct?" "Technically, yes; Taz was created on the Rock Of Braal by a skilled gnome artificer." "Curious. Fascinating!" and Niv's eyes do something strange; his pupils rotates, almost like facets of a crystal; "Ah. Marvellous! You're marvellous indeed. What is your name?" Taz answers "Tazythas Tablabu, but friends? - call me Taz." "Do you do more besides healing and diagnoses?" Taz says, "Of course, I am reasonably skilled with a dulcimer..." - and before he can continue, Niv asks "Play something for me!"

Taz uses Enhance Ability on himself; doesn't really need the advantage anyway, 14+15 rolled; 24 overall performance check; BFS added too; 3 rolled; 27 total. Taz knocks it out the park, playing *both* dulcimers with skill. Despite the pain, Niv seems delighted, clapping claws and saying, "Marvellous! Marvellous! Ral, thank you for bringing them to me?" (We notice during this that Niv's actually quite skinny for a dragon; and tall.)

Ral asks when Niv returned. "A day. Two days? A day. More than a day." "But you didn't call for us..." "No. I was resting and thinking. Thinking mainly. Plans. And you're busy! You had Thing to build. Have you succeeded?" Ral pauses, curiously; "Um... In principle yes, basically we've built it but we can't fully test it because there's nothing to test it on." Niv answers, "I'd like to see it as soon as it is ready." "Where are we installing it?" Niv suggests leaving it where it is; but Ral points out it's in an exposed location on top of Nivix tower - vulnerable - *and* directly below Niv. Unwise, says Ral. Niv just blusters - "double the security; put up some wards."

Gnog asks, "In view of the forces on Ravnica that have worked hard to stop Thing from being operable, and very nearly successfully, perhaps it would be prudent to not underestimate them...?"

Niv argues that nobody would dare attack now he's back. Gnog asks about Tesseret; his shifting in and out is near-instant. Anti-magic wards, we're told, will prevent that. Niv tells us, "Come. Come down with me."

We go to the side of the lab, where Niv activates some kind of lever and steps appear out of nowhere - the floor falling in sections basically - about 20ft wide. It's strange to see Niv on all-fours scuttling down the stairs - strange to see an intelligent, articulate, hands-using creature switch like that. We have to wait until the tail is clear! Then we can follow. The floor below is a bit smaller than the lab with many large cushions around. Ah, so the high ledge we saw above - the "perch" - must just be observation by the windows; down here seems like a den or sleeping area.

Niv asks us to "bring me up to speed!" - Ral starts, but then hands over. We mention Jace is back; the Four are met; then Tesseret's theft of red crystals is mentioned & Niv is shown by Ral the missing equipment, presumed stolen. "That's all he needs to build his own beacon", says Niv; "Now why would he need to do that?" "To establish the bridge?" "No, the bridge does not require a beacon. You MUST find out where this beacon is. We don't need to destroy it; we just need to take it back."

We're told by Niv that all we really need to do is wound Tesseret to see him off. He "prizes his own life far too much to risk any serious injury for anything or anyone". We start on the guild imbalances; that they're probably being worsened by outside agents; Ral is asked at this point to fetch some plans. While he's away we talk a little more about the guilds; but when Ral is back, we find out that there's a plan of Niv's to position *emitters* at certain key points, which focus via artificial laylines, guild pact powers in the original structure laid down by Azor; they'd transfers the Guild Pact powers *to Niv Mizzet himself* - we express some reservations (!) but Niv is sure Jace will agree; Niv would resign as Parun of the Izzet.

Those artificial laylines, it transpires, are also part of the megafauna bindings.

Niv claims that this is why he was away; he's *been to see Azor* - he claims Azor isn't dead! He found him and went to ask why he left; what happened? Azor had seen the same visions as Niv. He left to try and build something to trap Bolas. Bolas has been Azor's nemesis for - well, forever. When Azor built the "perfect" society of Ravnica, he knew it was only a matter of time before Bolas discovered it and wanted it for himself; to sow disharmony and discontent. Azor has been building a trap - Niv is almost whispering now - but he never got to spring it. Bolas never feel for it; he has instead waited on another world. Azor would use a device - "ingenious really when you think about it!" - called the 'immortal sun', which would stop Bolas being able to travel between planes. He'd become trapped. Azor though gave up the ability to reside concurrently on many planes; he became bound to only one at a time. Ravnica was kept secret for a while but the city grew too great and news of its majesty and achievements had spread. A few centuries ago Bolas learned of it. They *think* that Bolas may have been responsible for the disharmony that destroyed the Guild Pact ~70 years ago; but it could've been anything, really. There are many other destabilising forces.

(Niv talks about Ravnica as perfect; a utopia.)

Niv offers to answer questions. Fee-Ree asks immediately. "Why did you have to do it the way you did, why me - or us - and why that way? Why not just ask us, contact us for help? And I don't understand, why us? You're far more powerful than us and there are many beings here that are far more powerful too. I don't understand why you'd take my husband. And where is he?!"

Niv blusters that it's at least four questions, but concedes he'll answer - Gnog jumps in, "Well start with the last one then. Where's the husband - where's Arxcis?"

"I don't know. I thought he was the one who was meant to be the one to come here; you're both dragonborn, I thought I plucked him, but he never came. But maybe I was supposed to pluck him to make you come? I don't know how this works. I just know that's what I was supposed to do. We targeted him but maybe it's because *you're* supposed to come. Hmm. I must figure out what the pattern is..."

Gnog insists, "You don't know where he is; well theorise! You built the IPB. Where is possible?"

"Any of the six planes connected by the IPB. Sardior's plane, clearly not you own plane though as I take it you've searched there (Fee-Ree had in fact tried all sorts of scrying over the years), Zendica (Nissa's planet), Theros (Ajani's planet), Tovera (Kaya's planet), and of course Ravnica is the sixth."

There wasn't much else about it - the reason for why us, why this method; it's just a question of their precogs and calculations showing that this path was the one with the highest probability of success (Gnog asks what that exact probability is; Niv would have to check his notes; on second thoughts, Gnog isn't sure he wants to know!)

"Next question?"

"What do we do?"

"We play our part. We read the signs and plan. I have big plans. But the first, of course, is to get the Guild Pact transferred to me. Then I will have the ability to stand up to Nicol Bolas with the power of the planet on our side."

On Ravnica Station & the Xaryxians:

* Tesseret is in the employment of Bolas, his "right hand man".
* Tesseret, a couple of decades ago, assassinated the then-leader/chairman of the Infinite Consortium and seized control of it himself. He's the head now, whose main benefactors are the Mercane Society and the Xaryxian Expire.
* This means Niv is confident that the Xaryxian attack on Ravnica Station is likely connected to Bolas, but doesn't know why.

He slumps for a while, his shoulder hurting. He said he'd tell us the whole plan, but he needs rest. "One more question..." he insists, surprisingly. "Where did you get the wound?" "When I went to see Azor I met an assassin; I ate him! Azor has old enemies. It might've been sent by Bolas himself. Who knows." Gnog says, "You need rest." "Thank you. Ral will see you out... Since we're meeting tomorrow night anyway, could you bring the others? I would very much like to meet them" and he rests his head down and appears to fall asleep straight away, before Gnog even has a chance to respond, "Certainly."

Ral shows us out. He's concerned. "It feels like an escalation." Deni turns around. "Ral, who do you think would be the Parun of the Izzet League?" "I don't know..." "Aren't *you* second in command?" "Uh - I - I wouldn't say *that?* I'm close to Niv, but... Um..."

It was interesting how Niv's conversation was understandable. He's spent a lot of time with people. He cares deeply about the planet, it seems; less of an afterthought than his notes might have implied. But it wasn't the inscrutable, curious, hard-to-understand conversation of the ancient Dragon Council all those months ago.

We talk about Fee-Ree and Arxcis; we don't know much more than we did before. Taz, history 27; if he's on the planet Azorious should surely know, unless he's been in hiding or joined the Gruul, neither of which seem likely. GNog says, "Fee-Ree, would you care to accompany me to New Prahv, so we can rule out an entire plane quickly?!"

We get there. Taz, persuasion 20!+13 -> 33. He uses the investigator badge to avoid privacy concerns (!) - he even has the hat - and turns on all the charm. We're asked where we'll be; it might take a day or two to deliver results. It turns out that this information can be left with Levisha's office at the Chamber - we'll be in the guild summit in two days and hopefully the information will have been retrieved by then.

Gnog finally broaches the topic of Arxcis maybe having moved on, since Fee-Ree raises the possibility that he's still dead, after all. She says, "Just seeing him one more time would be enough" - she's wanted to say things to him for years, that's all. She talks about this being an adventure of sorts; we've found more things than we might have never expected, found a new family member, and so-on. Taz realises that she's shielded herself from hope; it would be too devastating to hold out hope. Part of that breakdown in Niv's quarters. It's a bit painful for Taz to see; she's always had an air of hope, a liveliness about her; the blue horizon of possibility. Lately, he's seen this flame flicker and nearly die.

Taz walks up to her and puts his hand up, as if inviting her to hold his hand. "It's OK. I can hope for both of us. Let's go and get some food."

We head back to Griffin Heights, since we'd had some OK food there before. It's approaching 5pm so we find a nice tavern. We could go out and do more, but Golgari after dark isn't much fun. Sleeping over in P6 - but NOT Midori Park! - is suggested; so we have an early evening walk all the way across to Smelting Quarter and see if there's any kind of accommodation here; we find a worker's hostel in a section that has quite a few such places. Short and long-term options. Just overnight for us; they have a small room, almost like a little apartment, that's normally long-term but is between rents; 3 beds can be sorted; they'll all be in the same room though (fine); only a zino. Paid!

Mealtimes in a communal dining area are strictly 6-8 morning and night.

The room surprisingly has a small adjoining bathroom; three beds in one bedroom; a small living room with a table and seating area. That'll do; more than we expected in some regards. 

Given it's late, we take a risk and get Taz to start blowing L3s on Sending. We may be able to get messages passed on. Taz tries Nissa first. He sends, "Jace back on Ravnica. Niv Mizzet too. Meet at Nivix tomorrow evening. Guilds meet noon day after. Can you pass this on?"

Response is, "Will Contact Ajani And Together Figure Out How To Get Into Nivix To Meet You. Either Way I Sense A Convergence. No Contact With Kaya."

Taz messages Kaya. "Jace back on Ravnica. Niv Mizzet too. Meet at Nivix tomorrow evening. Guilds meet noon day after. Nissa And Ajani Aware."

Kaya, "Not Sure What This Has To Do With Me But I Agreed To Help So Will Meet You. Must Point Out Is Inconvenient Tomorrow".

We decide to try and find some little snacks, teas, or some kind of gift for Gibo & Bebe's mum and pay her a visit to let her know what they've done. Taz history 9+11 - he figures out a place to go based on cultural cues. We end up in a beautful old market selling things of goblin culture. A section has little inventions, which we'd seen a few of around the house - the family seems to have a general interest. They're just trinkets; inventions for the sake of inventions. He's seen metal ornaments there too, metal balls, metal carvings and so-on. There's also a beautiful intricate metal bowl made of filigree. Taz figures he could assemble a mobile from one at the shops, modified to have one goblin up high and three below, as if the family, watching out for each other.

Tinkers tools dex/proficiency -> only 15 + BFS only 16, but in fact it's enough and the mobile looks how he expects. It's the cost equivalent of 8 standard silvers.

The other three have just quietly let Taz do this and watched as he worked, answering any questions he has and just letting him lead. It's interesting to see him growing as a person, not a construct - though it's hard to shake some illusions of mechanism when he uses tinkers tools that come out of his own hands directly!

We start to head towards the house, but find little snacks, sweet teas and so-on for us all to share there. 1 zino in all, for the four-plus-tasting-portions of us.

Finally, we get to house and knock. She comes to the door and seems surprised. "The boys aren't here!" she says and we say, "no, just a social call! We thought we'd let you know how they're getting on" - and so it goes on. She hangs the mobile above the bottom of the stairs. We pass on the letters the wrote and tell her all about what the boys have done. She doesn't read the letters there & then - we figure she might be trying not to get too emotional. After a nice half an hour or so, we bid our farewells. "Good night! And thanks for coming to see me again" she says. 

Outside, a group of loud humans are walking up the street, kinda loutish but really just having been drinking and singing a lot. They're dressed in "going out" clothes. They're in front, and join another group they seem to know. About 7 of them now. They're all young - late teens, early 20s. Dressed well, but P6. We hear them talking about it being "the big one", "can't wait to see anyone", "have you got the stuff" etc. - looks like drugs being dispensed! - "is this your first one?" "yes I've never been!" and Gnog can't help himself and calls forward, "sorry everyone, I couldn't help but overhear, there's some kind of - party?" "Yes! Yes, the big one. It's the big party! It's Decadence!" - but, "No, Deca*dance*" says another. Gnog asks, "do you need tickets beforehand or something?" "Of course you need tickets!" "Door sales?" "Don't know. They're not cheap..." - anyway, we continue along, and more join over time. Eventually the wandering band is getting quite big. It's headed towards Gore House. Approaching, we can see that everything is changed up. Brightly lit. Blue and yellow and purple. Huge flags flying, stilt walkers and more. All over in lights - "DECADANCE" several times. Pumping music. A huge throng of young people are converging. Very good spirits, some fluorescent face paintings, all dressed up.

Gnog says quietly to Deni, "Think this is risky given the state of Rakdos right now?" "I don't know... There are a lot of very young people here. But it looks like a very big party."

So we head in. Tickets are being checked. Gnog, perception 12. It's very busy; can't see where to go. But Taz asks to be lifted up by Gnog - darkvision 120ft - perception 19+3! 22. He spots someone looking quite different, kinda shifty, Taz points to him. We head over. It's a ticket scalper. "How much for four?" we ask. "Four! Ha! I'll do you two. Ten gold each." There are sounds of dissent (they're 2.5gp each otherwise). Gnog says, "Four for 50 gold." "DONE!" (The crowd is unimpressed at our gauche display of wealth!)

Apparently they're "golden line" tickets. Whatever THAT means. We see a much shorter queue. The people we were with see us and are shouting at us, it's not ill will, they just seem happy and wave. At the front we're given a fluorescent mark on our faces which seems to be the 'entry approved' mark. Inside, it's all lit in ways that make all that kind of stuff glow - and we see that many outfits outside that just seemed black, light up in here. The floor has been changed to make it basically a huge rave! Just a giant open area, with a raised central dais almost that is where the musicians are based. Various circular platforms almost like terraces have dancers. Must be 1000 people in here! It's mad.

The music fills the space, booming and rhythmic on a huge scale. Taz hasn't heard anything like it before. Dancers tumble down from the roof wrapped in silken cloths to control their descent. Light balls everywhere, and more.

We are allowed into upper terraces and back rooms, with different music. We retreat to a quieter bar area with more chilled, quieter music and fewer people. We realise that in fact this bar is close to the Rix Maadi entrance - albeit redecorated. "I don't want to go back to Rix Maadi", says Gnog, "but he said we met the wrong person. That wasn't helpful. Who's the right person? How could we ever know?" - Taz recalls a name (history 19+11) of someone we never met. Hikara, the blood witch. She was in charge. "If we go back down we'll just fight again or something!" says Gnog, but maybe we have to try. We're missing something here.

Shit. "Deni, is this going to be OK? It was horrendous last time." "We don't even know where she is." "We'd have to ask." "I don't know if tonight's the best idea - look how many people there are here!" "Yeah, I thought maybe, distraction and cover, but it probably doesn't work that way down there." We look through and realise that there are even people flowing down into Rix Maadi chamber down below, probably thousands more. Redecorated too, crazy; all the terraces that were devilish and filled with strange sex acts are all changed to look lush and beautiful and fantastical. It's hard to believe it's the same place. It's everywhere. OK, so not today! It's too busy within the main complex and if there was a battle Deni points out we could kill a lot of people.

Unfortunately, it's trippy AF and wisdom saving is needed:

* Taz 11 (entranced by the music and crazy lights - a Bard's dream come true)
* Gnog 20+9 (not buying into this shit a second time around)
* Fee-Ree 17+7 (with Gnog on that)
* Deni 10+7 (she's a bit persuaded - it's an age thing - so many young people, self-expressive, beautiful... But isn't fully swayed)

(DC it transpires was 17). Gnog says to Taz, "sorry about this, argue with me later..." and picks him up and we make a beeline for the exit... But out of the corner of his eye, he notices a commotion. A slight panic on a terrace. It's hard to see at distance but Gnog's eyes are good. Perception 23, nearby terrace. Young people suddenly look terrified and run towards the edges - two even fall off, but fortunately land on a terrace below (injured perhaps but not killed). A bizarre pulsating flower has emerged on the upper terrace, 6 feet across; standing next to it, a Devkarin elf exuding spores. Golgari! People are running to keep away from the spores. Some people are being affected and are coughing and falling, others pulling them clear. Emerging from behind, a death priest; large, insect-like, clearly up to *something*. Setting up, claiming a space. Injuring people nearby.

Gnog says to the party, "OK, sorry, change of plan, looks like it's our turn again! Taz! Get your shit together!" - taps him sharply on the side of the head with a loud clank. Wisdom saving, only 12. He's still out of it. We'll have to work on him as we go!

We have to get over there. The flower is oozing stuff, people are freaking out and trying to get away, some diving off the terrace, others apparently afflicted by something. Gnog can do it via rage; Fee-Ree can fly her and Deni.

This will be tricky. We can't get too close or risk affliction - only Taz can resist but he's out of it! Fee-Ree can't use area effect spells. Then Deni, just before we leap, pulls out Diderius' Ewer, from way back in the Serpent Hills - Gnog had forgotten all about it. Gnog shouts, "Deni, you're a genius!" - we all drink, for protection against being poisoned (and Fee-Ree, who otherwise had no resistance, gains some).

Gnog rages, and with Taz, jumps; Fee-Ree casts; we all arrive on the adjacent terrace. 

The death priest - same kind of creature that we battled at Clancy's, Ravnica Station - has two warriors with him/her/them, different faces but also large and insectoid. The devkarin elf shaman is here too, tending to this strange pulsating flower; a shambling mound emerging out of it, separating; it looks like two kids have been killed and are being consumed.

Gnog shouts to the priest, "Golgari, stop! You've no business here and you're killing people. You must withdraw!"

The devkarin turns. "No. It *is* the Rakdos that encroach on *our lands*. These are *ours*! This is our world!"

Gnog knows he's got a point but this isn't the time even if it is the place. Gnog shouts, "We'll have to respond with lethal force, *please* withdraw!" - the priest just snarls. "You don't understand. I'm merely returning these wasted lives to a better choice."

Gnog hopes to goodness that the Azorious understand and prepares to fight. Before he can act, the shaman makes some kind of gesture and emerging from the clouds of spores around him are two giant spiders. Gnog shouts, "I don't know where to start, priest first?!". He looks to Taz but Taz (wisdom save 4+5->9) just seems even *more* unaware of what's going on. Dammit. He's normally so reliable!

Initiative rolls are strange!

* Gnog 20!+3 23
* Deni 23
* Taz 17+5 22
* Fee-Ree 7

Gnog goes first because the battle planner software put it that way around, despite Deni's higher dex. For story's sake, she's still trying to wake Taz - yet he's alert and aware given the initiative roll, yet somehow, captivated by the music.

Gnog sees a 3rd Kraul warrior appear; there's no time to waste; he jumps right into the middle of it all. He jumps between the 2 giant spiders and starts swinging at the devkarin priest. He makes a guess at using the maul for lighting damage, since these creatures might not respond at all to poison. (The giant spiders at least won't be affected.) 17 hits, for 18 damage total; 17 again, so hits for only 15 this time.

Deni manages to get insight on the Kraul death priest, but when it comes to the attack, she's distracted by the people she's trying to avoid, and is disturbed by this sudden horrific turn in the otherwise-beautiful-people rave. Nat 1 rolled; it's a miss. Boo.

Taz wisdom saving: 18. He shakes it off and sees Deni just miss the Kraul priest; he hasn't heard Gnog ask for focus on the shaman; he gives Deni bardic inspiration to help her next attack and tries Psychic Lance. Saving fail (9) - yay! Success. 27 psychic damage and the death priest is incapaciated for a few seconds.

The shambling mound continues to try and attack and consume the teenagers (ick!), at which Gnog realises in horror that he maybe picked the wrong primary target; but amazingly, the child is very agile and manages to dodge both of its reaching tendrils. Gnog senses that the corpse flower would've been fed. Target mound, target flower? Gnog can't decide!

The Kraul warriors act (three of them now). One runs up to Taz and just below the still-flying Deni! It attacks Taz... He threw the spell that stunned the priest. It tries to use its spear but Taz dodges (attack 10 vs AC 20). Another runs up to Gnog, who now has the warrior, two spiders and shamen on him; but also misses (17 vs 21); the other runs up and attacks too; crit! But it's only 8 piercing -> 4 in total.

A giant spider attacks Gnog, trying to catch him in a web. It can't quite get him - he dodges. It tries a bite instead; almost gets him (20 vs AC 21) but not quite.

The shaman looks at Gnog in disgust. "You are messing in things you do not understand. Dominion of the undercity was given to the Golgari and *no-one honours it!* We will not honour the boundaries of other guilds." Its eyes cloud over with spores, and three more Kraul warriors appear. They move strangely, as if animated, or constructs or something. Then it tries Blight on Gnog - con save 25; half of the 8d8 necrotic damage (and half again from raging); 37->18->9. Its open mouth causes Gnog to be surrounded by spores; they hit as if an attack (25 vs AC 21) con save huge roll - no ewer advantage even needed here - 18+11 -> 29. 6->3 damage; but 14 -> 7 necrotic on top. Quite an assault.

The three new 'animated' warriors move towards our group; Deni and Taz are pretty much surrounded. Taz says, "Oh dear..." (!)

Fee-Ree is torn - no area effect spells is kind of crippling - all she can think of, without high risk of hitting innocents, is Crown Of Stars - and so, it appears. She flies over inside the circle of fleeing children, uncomfortably close to the main melee, and has a line of sight on the shambling mound now; a star is thrown - but oh no, low roll; it would just have missed (14 vs AC 15) but Tides Of Chaos - and no wild magic surge - turns it into a hit; 25 damage. 

The corpse flower *moves*, slowly, towards the children near the shambling mound. Tentacles fly out towards them. Two dodge, but one unfortunate soul is pulled it. It's... Really not pretty. Gnog is *deeply* sickened, but interestingly, the air is clearing near him as the flower moves away. He coughs up and shouts, "Shit, the flower's on the kids, I'll focus on that instead!"

At this, another spider tries to web Gnog again. *Just* misses (20 vs 21); crit on the bite though. 15->7 piercing, con save for poison 24 no advantage needed; 8->4->2 poison damage.

The kids continue to flee. Many end up backed up against a big drop-off, unable to get near to the 10ft lower terrace drop due to the Kraul warriors next to Deni and Taz. Others further over try to climb up to the terrace from which we came. One near the shambling mound jumps, but the mound takes the opportunity to grab him; at least another is able to escape as a result; another flees the flower and is also grabbed; others manage to flee from it, falling to lower terraces, probably injured - but alive.

Seeing this developing, Gnog shouts, "Maybe keep on the shambling mound, Fee-Ree...?" then flies up and over the head of the shaman to land between it and the flower. Everyone else gets opportunity attacks; the spiders both miss, one Kraul warrior misses, but one does hit for 4->2 damage - a good gamble and Gnog gets away with it. Now he swings at the flower, on the other side from the recently-grabbed child. Hits for 18, 17. Another couple of low damage rolls but the hits are landing.

Deni is next to Taz, in close quarters now with a group of *four* Kraul warriors. She *aims*, rather than dropping her bow, at the one immediately in front of her. She'd miss but for Taz's bardic inspiration, which through his Mote Of Potential and a 6 rolled on the d8 causes three warriors - all failing DC17 con saves - to take 6 thunder damage. The target she's hit takes 16+24 damage and is obliterated.

Taz draws his shortsword, hexblade's curses the warrior to his left and attacks with Booming Blade; 22, hits. With hexblade, 15 on the damage and d8->8 on the booming blade; 23 total. It isn't *quite* taken down. Perhaps should've taken a swipe at the injured one in front!

The shambling mound uses its free arm to try and fully grasp the child it has already got; it succeeds. It engulfs the poor child; there are sounds of choking. It's fucking awful. Gnog is very close to losing whatever he's eaten for the last day or two.

A warrior attacks Taz, with pack advantage, hitting (24 vs AC 20, even the recently-acquired Garren protective wings can't help). Deni uses her protective wings, though, which confer a greater bonus for her; and *this* is enough to give Taz the AC he needs. The attack misses. Taz shouts, "Wow, thanks!". It's quite a spectacular sight - she's flying 5ft up already; huge platinum spectral wings spring forth, one reaching down and wrapping Taz to block the spear.

One of the warriors that was on Gnog moves to continue its attack. Just misses - 20 vs 21 again. The other moves in and does the same; surprisingly, misses again. A giant spider moves around and has a go at attacking, not having its web back yet; but again, Gnog's hardiness saves him; the other spider without web gives up on Gnog and goes for children, biting one. The child looks poisoned.

The shaman looks at Fee-Ree. She's flying high up. His eyes narrow. He sees a fly spell and Crown Of Stars; he tries L4 Dispel Magic. This kills the fly spell immediately, which was L4 itself. The L7 Crown spell, fortunately, isn't taken down - but Fee-Ree falls. She holds concentration for a moment on Deni's own fly magic, but hers is gone. Dex save 17; she lands on her feet; 3d6 -> 17 (extremely high roll!) -> 8 damage; concentration check; 25, easily holds the spell. The Kraul have noticed her landing! On the ground now... In reach...

A warrior near Deni and Taz, but not quite in melee yet as it was behind the other three, immediately goes for Fee-Ree and would hit her with its spear (18 vs AC 17), but she reacts with her newfound wings - she *did* see Deni use them a moment ago! - and they protect her. 

The warriors try to get Taz but his higher AC and shielding via Deni mean he's almost unreachable. No blows hit.

The death priest, who all this time we've almost forgotten about, has now recovered from Taz's earlier attack. It skitters over to Fee-Ree... Reaches out a hand... Weird tendrils of spores start to reach out and try to spread out over her, but she sees it coming and dodges out of the attempted spell attack's way; the spores though are still there, wreathing the priest who is still holding the spell up.

Fee-Ree responds by disengaging (as an action); she steps back near the children and throws a crown star at the priest (bonus action). It hits - for a solid 30 radiant damage. The priest is *very* injured by this, but is still up. She shouts, "The priest is close!"

The corpse flower tries to strangle and consume the child... Its body goes limp. Gnog hasn't felt emotions like this before. All he can do is kind of whisper, in desperation, "no..." - he wasn't quick enough.

The kids keep trying their best. One even hides behind Fee-Ree. One grasped by the flower but not yet consumed manages to break free and flees.

Gnog is too late to save the child in the flower. All he can do is keep going to try and stop it getting anyone else. Hits twice - very high damage on the first, 28 and a solid 20. The flower at least looks damaged... And it turns its attention to Gnog. Gnog thinks. Maybe. It's a flower. It's weird. It's hard to tell. He's breathing spores; but the stench doesn't get to him (con save a whopping 19+11).

Deni moves aside a little - an opportunity attack misses - and studies the shambling mound for a moment, gaining some insight into it; she tries to attack; gets a hit! 36 damage, low roll but OK.

Taz takes a step back, right up against the wall, risking two opportunity attacks from the nearby warriors; both miss. He throws eldritch blasts, one at each, first at the one he'd attacked prior; but low roll 14, BFS on 1; misses. Second blast, crit fail, misses. Dammit! He sees Fee-Ree engaged with the Kraul priest and a warrior and throws bardic inspiration at her.

The shambling mound turns around and starts towards the children near Fee-Ree. A warrior hits Taz for only 3 damage. Another crits against Gnog, 10->5; the other misses; a giant spider near Gnog still has no web, misses the bite.

The shaman acts again, this time casting Animate Dead. It brings back to life a zombie from one of the children's warriors. At this, Gnog feels like he's possibly more likely to lose his sanity up here than he might've all the way down in Rix Maadi. "Grim" isn't even close.

A Kraul warrior near the priest attacks Fee-Ree. It would crit; Taz casts Silvery Barbs. Miss! Advantage to Deni. The other warrior closeish to Taz moves around and tries for Deni, but misses. The Death Priest tries another spore attack against Fee-Ree and this time it succeeds; she's hit with necrotic damage (14) and it seems to heal from this somehow (for 7). Fee-Ree still manages to hold her Fly spell on Deni, just.

Fee-Ree now is in melee with the warrior and death priest. Time for something novel. She breathes fire, catching the warriors on Taz and Deni, and the warrior and death priest on her. 3d10 fire -> 18. This kills the death priest outright. The warrior in front of her also takes full brunt. The one which just attacked Deni takes all damage too and because of previous injuries, falls dead; lastly, the one on Taz has time to see it coming and only takes 9 damage. Fee-Ree isn't done though; she throws a crown star at the Golgari shaman. Despite disadvantage imposed from the nearby Kraul warrior, she gets a hit! 31 radiant damage.

The corpse flower digests the child, healing *20* hit points from that (maximum it could - 2d10). It makes three attacks on Gnog. One would hit, but Gnog *also* uses the new toy - out come the wings!

The giant spider near the kids sees Fee-Ree as a greater meal - and greater threat - gets its web back but she dodges it. The bite, though, just lands. 7 piercing, but the ewer helps her avoid the worst of 2d8->6->3->1 poison damage. The zombie child (!) shambles up to try attacking Fee-Ree as well, but misses.

The child that escaped the corpse flower gets free. Other children on that side, seeing the flower distracted, make a break for it.

Gnog notices that the shaman behind him is quite injured. He spins around and swings recklessly at the shaman first. Hits; 23 damage; not quite down! Damn! He has no choice but to swing again, and another 23. The shaman falls. "I might not understand what I'm doing but I can still kill shit!" - also, the zombie by Fee-Ree falls to the ground. Gnog hopes that the corpse flower's attention isn't wandering... The children that are running away are quite close.

Deni is able to step aside and still have (thanks to Silvery Barbs) advantage on an attack on the shambling mound. She hits for 46 damage. With her bonus action, she flies out to the other side of the terrace for a better view of the battlefield.

Taz sees this, and needs to stop the mound from attacking the kids, so despite the warrior next to him he has one last try at Psychic Lance. The shambling mound needs to make a DC18 INT save, but -3 on the mound which rolled 18 -> 15; win! Average damage at 23, but this stuns the mound. No more kids for you.

A warrior hits Fee-Ree for 10; she holds Fly. Another hits Gnog for 8->4; and same again from a third, 8->4. The giant spider on Gnog gets web but misses; it does get in a bite though. 6->3 piercing. Con save made; 13->6->3 poison.

Unfortunately the warrior crits against Taz; Silvery Barbs, advantage to Fee-Ree; but it crits again! FML! 12 damage. He's a bit banged up but still OK.

Fee-Ree turns to the Mound and throws a star. She's disadvantaged by the nearby warrior so disengages. With Taz's advantage, she only rolls 1 and 5, but that's *just* enough - 24 damage - the Mound is down, decomposing into spores and, well, kind of mouldy shite. The kid inside rolls out onto into the middle of it, unconscious. 

The corpse flower misses, would hit but Gnog uses the wings again, but the third hits too. 9->4 bludgeoning, 10->5 poison.

A giant spider near Fee-Ree goes after her - she's drawn it from the kids at least - it tries its web, but this misses; so does the bite. The kids grab the body of their friend (Taz is like, "No! He was in range!") and run away. The ones near the corpse flower on the far side that had worried Gnog now get clear.

Gnog recklessly pounds at the corpse flower. Great hit! 28 damage. Another one slightly above average; 22 more damage. It's a mess now, but still up; not much else needed though. Deni sees that from new vantage point; she takes aim, draws the bow and **DOUBLE CRITS**, which is so pointless but wonderful showboating and reminiscent of the Scavvers fight from way back. Even with averageish rolls, 82 damage total. The corpse flower *explodes*, splattering half-digested corpse and slime all around. Gnog is coated head to foot. He can't help it; he throws up. 1 point damage.

Taz now focuses on the warrior in front of him; shortsword swing with Booming Blade. Hits for 17 damage. That's enough! It falls. He runs forward next to Fee-Ree and hurriedly casts Healing Word L1 on the unconscious child; maximum 9 points; his friends continue to drag him away as he coughs and splutters into life.

Gnog see this. "Proud of Taz" doesn't come close.

A warrior by Gnog lays into him, but Gnog's tough and the attacks miss. A spider would get a web but Gnog reacts once again with wings, a lovely trick; the web sticks to the wings; the spider bite misses too. Another warrior goes for Fee-Ree but misses; she disengages and throws a crown star at the nearby giant spider. She hits, 20 damage. The spider retaliates, but misses with the web and bite.

Gnog attacks a nearby giant spider, staying reckless. First hits; 25, not quite down; second hits 21; bye bye spider. Meanwhile, Deni aims at Kraul warrior - ANOTHER crit. We don't even roll damage. It's gone.

Taz has ended up in melee with another warrior - shortsword, booming blade. A high 17 damage; that's down too! Vicious little L2 warlock. He notes that Gnog's looking a bit fucked up tho there's not much left to hit now; bardic inspiration his way anyway.

Fee-Ree disengages from the giant spider & throws another star. Crit miss! It comes up to attack her - bite attack - and crits, Taz Silvery Barbs adv. Fee-Ree, CRITS AGAIN!; quite heavy damage, total 20 (with poison resistance) but no poisoned condition. The Fly spell, against the odds, stays up.

Gnog recklessly attacks the last creature next to him - a remaining warrior - hits for 20, insight: 18; this warrior is frightened; he roars at full "covered in rotting child" leather 80s barbarian, "YIELD! THIS IS DONE!" - intimidation 24! It lays down its weapon. Deni, meanwhile, finishes off the spider. She flies down and the group joins near the warrior. Amazingly, around us, we realise the music's still going, people are still dancing, it's amazing how this largely went unnoticed.

Taz says, "Did you see it? Deni's wings!" - and Gnog learns that Fee-Ree had used them too... And Taz... Garren protected us, across unfathomable distances and across planes. Gnog is very teared up and somehow proud, of all of them and of his old friend.

He wasn't quick enough for some of those kids; seeing that kind of death so close was just horrific. His closeness to Taz, a lack of his own children, it's a lot. Another emotional rollercoaster. He's still fully intimidating, very angry, still raging, and looks to the Kraul. "The Golgari. Tell us how to reach them." The kraul hands him something from around his neck; some kind of charm; it gets to the kraul's Hive and from there we can find out more. It says, "All can be explained!" and swears that this is reasonable somehow. Well, tomorrow may indeed tell us. For now, we tell it to flee and not send anyone else here tonight. The Golgari must wait for the noon guild meeting. Off it fucks.

Gnog's kind of grim faced cos of the kids, but kneels and hugs Taz. "You saved on the kids. Thanks for that."He looks around for some kind of exit. With luck point - 5, 5, + 1! Oh dear. But either way, for now Taz is examining the remains. Investigation 14. There are belongings left behind from the corpse flower. We collect those, bags of money and so-on; we'll let Deni look through that to see if there's anything identifying; maybe contact families via the Azorious tomorrow (or tonight). The priest and shaman are interesting. The priest has what Taz recognises as a Periapt Of Health, which Gnog gives this immediately to Deni. The shaman has a Periapt Of Proof, defending against poison; Gnog gives this immediately to Fee-Ree. Taz identifies a potion of invisibility too. So *that* might be how they got in here. Gnog adds it to his collection (!) - well, his one other very rare and as-yet unused potion of invisibility.

Gnog is over it! He shouts, "Enough. LET'S GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW! Deni, you know the way?"

### 2400 XP each, but we distribute to Taz; 1200 each, 6000 to Taz - still L10, but L11 close

Deni leads us up and out. We get back to the hostel and Gnog immediately showers - he has to commend the front desk staff, who raised eyebrows but otherwise kept composure at his horrendous appearance, covered in gore. It takes a while; he knows he's covered in half-digested child, one of whom he saw captured right in front of him. Going to take a while to shake that one, but it is mitigated somewhat by the use of our new Bahamut gifts in battle.

We investigate the belongings from the kids. There are coins and strange charms and things. Our best bet - Feather. **It's late; we'll do that in the morning.**

We head to bed. We do set watch.

* Fee-Ree is asleep!
* Deni moves her to the bed
* Gnog 15
* Taz 15 also

Uneventful.



## Day 45 (Ravnica 25, Riglan 82 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Monday (7 day week)

* We meet at Niv's chambers this evening
* The guild meeting is tomorrow at noon

Taz wakes at 7:30am - he wakes the rest of us, since breakfast is only 6-8. We figure we might as well give it go so quickly pack up and head down. Eggs, bread, mushrooms & sausages, decent food. Gnog, perception 23. There are people here that haven't gone to bed... Remnants of fancy clothes, talking about having a great night. Drunk person philosophical conversations and so-on. Well, at least we know what *that* is all about.

One distressed person talks about someone having died; bad trip, others don't support her; Taz is able to help calm things down (Charisma-based medicine check, dirty 20).

Gnog thinks this is the cue to visit Feather, but Deni reminds us that Kamen Fortress is closer and deals in P6 matters; Feather is internal affairs. It's a good call and we head there directly. Taz is as usual up-front-and-centre for talking our way in; Persuasion 24. We start at the gate house (since this place is huge and we're not sure where to start); we get allowed in and pointed towards a main hall to speak to a lieutenant. Once inside we describe the events. They will do their best; there's not much in the way of identifying kit, so they'll have to wait until a missing persons report is filed and the family will have to check through stuff. It's all a bit grim and sad, but at least it's something.

We're about to leave, but the lieutenant stops us; he asks us to file some formal paperwork, related to the Golgari behaving as they were. We comply and are then surprised to be given 10 Boros coins, equiv. 5 zinos each.

Well, now. We have a map of sorts to the hive. **This leads us down Deadbridge Chasm** - and Kamen Fortress takes us there easily. Steep, but internal stairways descend walls of the fortress and other buildings alongside. There is a sudden change in architectural style; this is an older layer of Ravnica. The lighting changes; soft luminescent green fungi and lichens appear on walls. In due course, we find the hive that the Kraul told us about; on this cliff face, in what looks like a cave carved into the wall, but we realise it's actually some kind of great hall, exposed on one side, reminiscent of things we saw in the Red Wastes but not in ruins.

A group of warriors approach. They eye us wearily, spears drawn and stop us. They speak in broken Common. "You do not belong here". Gnog shows the Golgari token that led us here. "Oh! Who do you seek?" and Gnog says, without a hint of irony, "Take me to your leader".

We are invited to follow them, but - no weapons - it's a no-open-carry zone, just like P1 / 10th District Plaza. Of course we comply. We travel through passageways; old corridors with different scripts/runes along them. Seeing this, Taz casts Comprehend Languages as an L1 spell. Adv. history check: 2,19+11 -> 30! He recognises that the language is a form of Elven but of a very old kind and not one which is similar to Elven spoken on the surface. He tells the party this. Fee-Ree has a look; she knows Elven; it's not similar to Toril Elven at all. It's different enough that she can barely understand any of it. Taz also recognises a second form of runic language interspersed - **not Ravnican at all**. It is very old. He's not seen it before and while the spell helps him understand he doesn't recognise it. It potentially leans into our "everyone here is an immigrant" backstory; the oldest origins. Unexpectedly and rather delightfully, they turn out to be poetry! It talks about cosmic movements, faith, mythology. He does not know the names of the characters mentioned.

We enter a larger chamber that might once have been a conservatory. The Kraul from last night is here. Gnog walks up and says, "thank you for this" and hands back the token. The warrior takes it to a much larger Kraul with different markings, not a priest but more of a leader. They talk quietly to each other. The taller one looks to us and speaks in Kraul. Taz understands; "You have entered our hive. Invited. You are our guests. But the circumstances of your arrival are violent. We have much misunderstanding to clear up." Taz relays and Gnog says, "Apologies; are you able to converse in Common?" another Kraul moves up - a death priest - and ends up acting as an interpreter.

That's great. Gnog says, "We are sorry it came to violence. We seek to understand the Golgari. We know little of you."

The Kraul responds. "Then we shall speak. I am - (clicking noises)" and Gnog goes "...I'm Gnog!" "I am the brood mother of this hive. You seek to speak to the Golgari; to the swarm; we are but part of the swarm. The swarm is fragmented. It does not operate as one. The Kraul look after themselves but we have allies amongst the factions. You -" (he turns to the warrior) "- encountered those who were mislead. It is a danger that we face and we will resolve it..." - and with that the death priest *skewers the warrior* ripping its head off! Fuck.

"We have long watched and waited for traitors in our midst. The Kraul have been slaves and servants; bodies to throw on the funeral pyre; fodder to be used in the squabbles and power plays between the Devkarin liches and the emerging Stone Sisters. We want no part of it!"

Gnog answers, after a pause, "The Guilds are being led astray. Powerful forces are splitting them, pitching them against each other and within, pitching them against themselves. It seems you are caught in this. The Living Guild Pact has returned..." - the kraul laughs - "The living guild pact! Ha! He has never cared. No-one cares what happens down here. No-one cares about the uprising and the betrayals that have happened under the city. They only care when the dead walk the streets. But they do not ask why or ask what has happened. They simply care that it stops. We serve the city, and yet we are unseen. No-one wants anything to do with us. We are essential but shunned and avoided. We represent death yet without us, without death, there could be food; the city would teem with its rotting corpses and is refuse."

Gnog says, "Well, we don't know enough about the Kraul or the Golgari. But we *do* know you're important. And as of round about now, at least four people from the surface *do* care. And we *do* want to ask why."

"The Devkarin have ruled the Golgari for thousands of years. Their liches wield undying power, but they have fallen; the **guild leader Jared is in torpor**. He will not wake. Gnog notes that this sounds a bit like Rakdos. "Ha! Rakdos is Jared's nemesis and mortal enemy. Rakdos is the reason for Jared's lichdom; he became a lich to save his son, who Rakdos desired as a sacrifice. But Jared has not stirred, and that has shifted power to the Stone Sisters. **Vraska** has seized control and commands the swarm. Therefore, we must be loyal to her. You see, what you saw last night, was a last ditch attempt by the Devkarin Elves to wrestle back control; they followed the Stone Sisters up to the surface, desired to ambush them by drawing them out at the celebration of the Decadance. Did you see any of the stone sisters there? You can't miss them - they are gorgons!" "We did not. And the Devkarin were a short distance down inside the descent to Rix Maadi; they did not seem focused on the surface." "Hmmm. We believe the Stone Sisters are trying to broker a truce between the two guilds after centuries of being foes. We believe that's why they were there."

"Do you believe that this is a good path, or do you believe the Devkarin should lead?"

"We believe that regardless of whoever is in power, the Kraul will still be second citizens. They're frightened of us. They're disgusted by us; repulsed by us!" Gnog is surprised - "Why?" "We are very different. The Simic might look bizarre but that is by choice. We are different by birth." Gnog is still surprised; "Yes, you look strange at first glance but many creatures do. Minotaurs, Loxodons; perhaps more familiar in some ways, but strange in their own right. You are correct; it's an injustice; we see the same of goblins above, overlooked and mistreated."

"There will always be races that are subjugated. That is the way of things."

"Yes, it seems that way; I hope though that one day it changes. A guild summit is being called. The guilds will meet. If the Sisters are trying to broker a truce, then" - the Kraul finishes the sentence, "Vraska will be attending." "Yes."

Gnog asks, "I understand, your role may not change regardless. But do you have an opinion? Is working with the other guilds reasonable, or is fighting them right?"

"It is in our nature to consume. We are drawn to death. We have no place amongst the civilised. We work here, with the Golgari as part of the Swarm because we have a place here. We believe that unfettered freedom would be disbalancing and that the Guild Pact creates the necessary balance for all things - not to thrive, but to coexist."

Gnog nods, "Yes, of course, the pact requires almost that certain guilds be opposed. Perhaps if they work together voluntarily, it would indeed run counter to the balance of the pact. It seems hard to say. I cannot see a way to get the Devkarin insight here; unless you of a way to meet them?"

They say they can take us to **Korozda**. This is the guildhall and home of the Devkarin elves. We thank them. That sounds good. For what it's worth, Gnog says he'd happily fight *alongside* them, on the surface or anywhere else, given what he's seen of them in battle prior. He empathises with their concerns. Surely, Ravnicans should have the experience and broadness of mind to do better.

So there are the Devkarin who might lead; numerous, but only a few liches in charge. There are the Stone Sisters, but they are few indeed. The Kraul we learn outnumber the elves 5:1, they're hugely numerous and as such represent a third faction.

"What would you do?" asks Gnog. "If things changed. If you led. What would you have the Golgari factions do?" The Kraul laughs. "We would do what the Golgari are meant to do - they were tasked originally with two things. Maintaining Ravnica's agriculture; recycling its waste. Death had nothing to do with it. That was corrupted by the original Parun, who was alive at the time, but after centuries as the Parun, nearing old age, sought necromancy to cheat death. Only then did the embracing of death become part of the Golgari Swarm's cycle of nature. That happened millennia again."

Gnog sighs and says "I have a favour to ask..." "We are in no position to be trading favours!" "I know. I ask nonetheless, and in turn of course, you may ask something of me, now, or in the future. The guilds meet at noon tomorrow. I would like you to be there." "It is not up to me. Vraska, or if Jared were to awaken, they would represent the guild. It is not our place to do so. We wield power through sheer numbers alone. Were we to step out of line, the Ochran would certainly end us - they are the guild's secret order of assassins." (So Gnog in the end has to let this go).

We briefly learn that the Devkarin were originally from the Selesnyan Conclave, before the Guild Pact was formed. The kraul do not know why they were cast out, or why they left if it was voluntarily. How did they earn the name of "Those that live in the shadows" - Devkarin - originally used as an insult, now claimed as their own.

The brood mother leads us to Korozda (along with about 40 others!). Various passageways; a ridiculously wide, grand staircase; then *palacial* architecture. It would surely have rivalled the Orzhova back in the day. Cathedral ceilings, giant columns, crumbled mosaic. Layers of fungus over everything; a fungus forest ahead. The Kraul skitter over walls and we reach a crumbled "forest" of 15-20ft high mushrooms, giant black leaved ferns, crumbled columns and broken walls; corpse flowers, strange dark michonid creatures; giant spiders. Giant slugs! It has some uncomfortable reminders to the fight yesterday, but on the other hand, there's a scale and consistency to this which has a strange beauty. There's bioluminescence everywhere, dim light; a low mist; a smell that's strange, almost of decay. Then we hear a strange sound and see, in the far distance, sewerage systems ejecting dirty water into pools. Odd creatures skitter over to the pools, consuming, but in so doing, purifying. *That* is harder to describe, at least visually, as beautiful; but the circularity of it, at least, has a logical elegance.

We are led through this strange landscape, eventually getting to some kind of amphitheatre, with circular terraces, that have arches rising above to platforms, walkways and bridges - it must have been some kind of palace or something given the "show-off architecture" and we even spy remnants of planters - an artificially planted / arranged garden must've been here. Then ahead, a fairytale castle - beautiful, grand - except in decay; moss, lichen, some parts crumbled, layers of earth and mud towards the bottom. We see a few Devkarin elves around now.

At the main entrance, the Brood Mother says she will go no further but leaves us a retinue of 6 guards. We thank her and head in. We end up just having to ask around! Persuasion 22 - Jared's sister, Savra has resumed her old post as Head of the Royal Family in his absence.

All the elves here have strange tattoos on their faces - "mood markings" they say - that change to express some of what they feel. When we ask if we can see Savra, they become suspicious and wary. They want to know what we want with her and why we should be let through. We do our best to explain; we're concerned about balance and the Stone Sisters may not be taking the right approach; that perhaps she may be interested in an upcoming guild meeting.

They say, "treat carefully". Gnog gains no insight (with luck, 5,4+3) - the tattoos are unfamiliar, the people are not known to us. They are, at least, clearly a proud race. He tries to be somewhat persuasive to at least see if we can proceed - very good roll for that one, 19+7 -> 26. They open up quite a lot and start to talk more freely. We are taken deeper into the building. There are many other elves as we deeper, along with some strange plant creatures; they almost look gruesome. Devkarin courtiers are around, looking like they might be higher ranking. We learn as we talk.

* Even within this court there are multiple factions - the royalists, the ones who support the Vod Sabo (Jared & Savra's family name) family, as they've the direct children of this guild's founder. Thousands of years old - liches.
* The Mat-Ka, the spiritual leader Izoni, has been gathering more and more power and support. Izoni has been constantly critical of Jared's reign.
* The purists; they want to separate from everything else in the surface world completely and live just down here, isolated.
* There's a Kraul death priest who has taken residence here, Matzirek, who is trying to bring some of the other Kraul factions into alignment with the Devkarin
* Things are quite high-tension today - there is a swarm convergence; the swarm will rise this evening, to choose their emissary for the guild meeting. So they know about it already.

We note the palace is beautiful inside, although there are the various growths covering things, but also *extremely* well defended for some reason - significant fortifications, numerous patrols, war machines stationed at various places, lumbering creatures assisting patrols. They look like they have been / are still repelling invaders. Defensive posture. We ask about that. They repel scores of undead who aren't theirs (Orzhov maybe?), hoards of demons (Rakdos?) and assassins. There have been a slew of assassinations. Jared's torpor is in fact a result of a psychic attack, an attempted assassination. His life-force is recovering; his lich magic will ultimately restore him but it takes time. They suspect the Stone Sisters. We suspect the hand of Nicol Bolas / Tesseret.

They change topic. They ask us questions of philosophy. What is our view on the cycle of life and the role of death? We talk about recycling, what we've seen here and the Kraul; death contrasts life and gives it value. Do cycles of life represent change or stability? Stability is useful. Change is inevitable. We're doing the best we can; trying to be honest. Not to deceive. Gnog, Nature 18+1 -> 19; they believe in stability. Selesnyans view nature as growth. Simic view it as evolution. Orzhov view life as practice for undeath. Can they all exist? Societal change is of fashion, a veneer, but the Golgari provide the stability for the foundation - the stable bedrock upon which this change takes place. Taz persuasion 21+BFS 4!->25.

This works. We're brought in deeper. The "Pools Of Meditation". Savra meditates here. These are old chambers, high columns, arches, again, beautiful architecture but all the usual mushrooms, lichens, vines, inside; if anything it is *verdent* inside this whole place in fact, not decaying. The pools have dark water with things growing. Not putrid! Just not "clear"/pure water. Devkarin elves tend to the pools here. Lotus flowers grow - just the flowers, black. No sunlight here, so the biology is strange. Lotus-like, if nothing else!

The pools are man-made, regular, interconnected. This looks like it was a bathhouse once. The central pool is larger. Floating there on their back, arms extended is a femal Devkarin elf, fully clothed. We realise as we get closer that there are tendrils just under the surface of the water that appear to be the things which detect the movement of our approach - we are told to walk into the pool. The elf rotates in the water to stand, upright. Like the others we've seen - ashy dark green skin. Dark, jet black, wet hair - so not at all Drow-like (white hair, purple skin). Mood markings on her face shift rapidly. Clearly undead!

"I've watched your approach. You're not too careful! Young and somewhat reckless, I would say." - it's a quiet tone, but seems to fill the cavernous bathhouse space somehow. "You have come because you have been deemed an ally. Yet you cannot vote as part of the swarm. What is your purpose here?"

We do our best to explain. They already know about the guild meeting; what do they think of the Stone Sisters plans?

"We - I - my family - has been constant across the ages. We follow the original plans, with minor changes. But what we do, we do to keep things going. We restrict our interactions with the world above. It's a distrustful place. They find us distasteful, yet they need us; an uneasy truce. We have no more desire to integrate with the surface world than they do with us, or seek to understand our perspectives.

She rises out of the water. We see to our surprise that she had been sitting on a large serpent! It slithers along, a little disconcerting as it pushes past us; she disembarks on stairs to the side and asks us to follow. We do so. She removes her wet clothes (Gnog averts his gaze!) and puts on a beautiful, form-fitting dress that looks like it's made from - well, dragonfly wings or something! That kind of consistency and translucency. She adds a mantle that looks like it has the veins and structure of a leaf, though it's not leaf shaped. It has a high collar, almost a short huge-collar jacket once fully on. She ties a vine belt around her waist - well, she puts that vine ends together and it ties *herself*, at which we deduce that probably all her clothes are in some way living, which explains the life-like structures within them.

She's assisted onto a lily pad of sorts, which has roots underneath that convey her along. She doesn't walk - it walks for her; quite strange; she's then a head above everyone else in height - even above Gnog's eye level - and glides eerily along rather than walking. We go along old, damp halls, water trickling and dripping down walls. There are decayed remains of old tapestries. A short distance later there's a chamber, beautiful, but everything in here looks it's never used. Chairs, a bed, all seem unused. She sits on one throne-like chair, that's the only one that gives the impression of being used. It's made of thorny branches.

She reaches to a table by her side and lifts a scroll. It's the invitation to the Chamber Of The Guildpact. They only want their vote - never to hear what the Golgari want. Never to hear what they need. Just to ask for support. Gnog talks about how *all* guilds might be asked to assist this time, but theirs may have more significance than anyone realises yet.

She just laughs. She talks of the Swarm. She invites us to go to a viewing area to see part of it - the congregation at Deadbridge Chasm. Once we've looked, she's interested to hear what we think. We head up a narrow stairway into a tower, all the way to the top - roughly four floors worth. We reach large windows on three sides. It takes a while to get used to the low level of light here. Taz is the first to see a fair way, but even then it's a bit limited.

Taz perception: Nat 1+3 -> 4. He can't really see over the edge well! We're too preoccupied to realise... Oops. Deni looks for a while then hands Gnog her goggles, so he gets his eagle-eye vision without disadvantage. In fact, due to his enhanced vision - advantage. Perception overall 24. The chasm - undulating floor, actually, towering mushroom forests and crumbling constructions that seem to be covered in moving moss. Only it's not.

The entire floor of Deadbridge Chasm is literally *swarming* with creatures. The "Golgari Swarm" is literal. Insects, giant spiders, mobile fungi, michonids, slugs, Kraul, undead, though no skeletons or zombies that we see - more like undead plants, it's a strange form of it. Creatures sitting at the border between life and death almost. Corpses that move. Shambling mounds, corpse flowers; those make sense _here_. There are pools of refuse/waste, but those teen with the swarm, which feed there. Corpse flowers feed on bodies of any dead, for example. It's almost grisly, but at the same time, these creatures seem made for this. It's a frightening ecosystem but one which makes *sense*. At least, *here* it makes sense. Here and there, Gnog sees groups of giant flying insects taking off and flying to towers; then he notices Devkarin elves who appear to be acting as shepherds, commanding clouds of spores, directing them to rapidly compose larger carcasses. We saw that with Lavinia's Verdani. True then; they're only called to clean up. But the Boros are only called when muscle is needed. The Azorious, only when law is needed. The Orzhov choose to interfere. The Dimir hide, but are used for information. The Selesnyans are invited everywhere because they provide food. They're used for that. Otherwise, they tend to isolate in their conclave. It's not so different in some ways.

We go back and Gnog suggest to Savra that perhaps many guilds are only called when requested. She seems intrigued and we expand. In the end, we're invited to the selection of the emissary - 4pm today, conveniently - we will observe as her guest. It's held *here* since this is the ancestral Guildhall; the writings we saw are the original. This building wasn't used by someone else before sinking or being built over - it was *always* theirs, it's just changed as the city around grew and submerged it.

We use the time until 4pm to explore and learn. Gnog decides to get up close to the sewerage pools. In one end is, well, nasty. But the creatures produce soil, ultimately - really good, clean, rich soil. It's transported out, but sometimes there's less sent up than produced and it accumulates. The Selesnyans grow things, but this means air and sunlight are being combined with the soil and water to increase the total biomass. **They recycle so efficiently that they produce more than they use** and millennia of accumulation are evident all around us.

Further, we learn of an *immense* network of tunnels and chambers in the submerged city here. We wouldn't be surprised if the Golgari know underground routes all the way out to where we were in the Red Wastes, or even, to our hidden ship. Cave-ins and sheared planes may block routes, but there are always new ways around. The surface world has a map of streets; the Golgari know of *all* the old streets - now tunnels - a giant, 3D network.

Rix Maadi is a loud, messy, alien invasion that cuts down very deep and far into the heart of all this; the Golgari consider the space theirs.

We ask about that. Rix Maadi was created - well, offered; the other guilds offered a big piece of the Golgari city to The Rakdos by way of appeasement. Rakdos wasn't interested in participating with Guild Pact so they offered him this place, to call his own for his dominion. He could rule it as he saw fit. TL;DR, most guilds say "Here, you can have their stuff!" & the Golgari are, like, "Wait, what?!" and Rakdos be like, "OK, this is mine now!"

4pm arrives surprisingly quickly. This place is very bizarre and at times quite - fragrant! - but it is truly fascinating.

Savra is there with various Devkarin druids of various schools, as well as a number of undead. They take a position up on a main terrace with stairs leading down either side, as if this were their court. A dominant location. Other Devkarin factions turn up, including some with chitinous armour carrying swords with vicious barbed blades. Others arrive on giant scorpions. The Kraul appear, with their Death Priests and more, swarming in along the walls and floors, making no particular distinction - all manner of other creatures appear, clattering along the floor - far more numerous than the Devkarin, including all the other creatures.

Then a bit of a hush falls. Walking in are 8 gorgons, snake-skinned with writhing snake hair, but eerily beautiful. They are by an even more beautiful gorgon, but dressed like a pirate! Think "Black Pearl bodice and ruffles, captain's jacket, wide cuffs and big lapels". She moves differently; she seems to glide across the floor, but the huge bottom of her dress hides whatever might be helping her achieve that. She carries a huge rapier in a scabbard. She's accompanied by two narrow-snouted gharials (long-snouted alligators). The other gorgons are in robes, dresses and so-on; very different style; they walk normally.

The group strides purposefully forward, deliberately drawing attention by arriving late. Taz via passive insight understands the social posturing; the leader of the group is making an unspoken challenge to the Devkarin royalty here. Any etiquette or decorum of court is being ignored as a power play to see how the Devkarin respond. But Taz realises, they can't react; most likely, anything they might do, will just play into one of many plans that the gorgons will have already created by strategy. Savra's millennia of experience must surely means she's well aware. Her mood marks have changed; she conveys amusement, interestingly.

We continue to observe.

The resident Kraul death-priest Matzirek starts to officiate the "Gathering Of The Swarm". He describes the purpose of the gathering, unfurling the scroll of invitation. "An emissary must be chosen". Immediately one of the families call forth and say it must surely be one of them. It's been their from family for 10,000 years. Surely, there's no debate here. Interestingly, at this, all of the Kraul move a bit, almost as one, uneasy it seems. Savra says nothing. One of the Gorgons pipes up, "Of course this is a discussion. This is not your kingdom. We are the swarm. All are equal. You do not represent us anymore. Things have changed. Stagnation is over." Heated arguments inevitably start, often overlapping with each other.

Interestingly the stone sisters don't stick together in a "clump" of presence, they spread more widely, perhaps trying to look larger than they are.

After about maybe ten minutes of this, the leader gorgon steps forward; her hair springs out; "What a mess this guild has become. Since I've returned I've felt nothing but shame! Shame for how far we have fallen." Savra stands and says, "Vraska! I would remind you to watch your tone. You have been away. Your foreign ideas are dangerous and destabilising." Vraska argues back, of course.

Insight and perception at Kraul: The spiritual leader's faction has so far remained silent, but there seems to be some resentment between her and Savra; yet she's not supported Vraska. The other Kraul seem uneasy. Dirty 20 insight from Gnog, distracted by the larger Kraul contingent's unease. They're in fact all talking amongst themselves quietly, clicking away; the leader we met before hasn't seen us or made eye contact; but they scan the room. They look like they're more captivated by Vraska. The loyalists of the royal family seem to be driving them away. They bristle at things the loyalists say.

Savra eventually rises up, as if addressing subjects, as if to invoke her family's authority. Vraska argues that it's Jared who ruled, not the family; the family is not royalty, but there's no kingdom here.

(Gnog to Taz: Message Savra. "The Kraul represent old views that your family established; but have a different opinion of stability. They favour Vraska. They require recognition as equals." Taz is surprised to hear a message back. "The Kraul could never represent the Golgari. They are the mass and the numbers; they are not leadership. They do not know how" - spoken like a true royal! A benevolent dictator, firmly believing in the privilege of her position.)

Gnog can't do much. Savra isn't seeing it - that this entrenched "this is how it's always been" line isn't flying. It's worked for their family only; not for others; the length of time isn't the importance. The gorgons might be wrong, of course, but it's an easy win for popularism, especially when the Kraul are already disenfranchised by being overlooked.

Eventually Izoni, the spiritual leader, steps forward. Everyone goes silent.

Gossamer robes, clerical. There's a staff made of metal, flat not round. Her clothes light up! Perhaps for effect only; it is certainly dramatic. She speaks.

"For a long time now there has been a rot in the heart of the Golgari." (There are gasps; Savra is shooting daggers out of her eyes at this presumed betrayal). "We purify that which comes through. We refresh, we renew; and what we do brings life from death. The gorgons are incapable of bringing life. They bring only death. They petrify and they kill. They cannot give birth to anything. *Why* Vraska, do you think you represent us?" Now the *other* group gasps. Izoni seems to support neither "side" (because, of course, she hasn't).

Izoni's argument is that the only "pure" point is the spirituality of the Golgari. At this, one of the Kraul leaders steps forward. "Iznoi, then why do you not represent *us?*" - she says she cannot - because she says she does not represent the Kraul; she leads. She is the shepherd for the Golgari. She tends the flock. She wishes *nothing* to do with the surface world - doesn't understand the politics and does not want to.

She asks Savra a situational question, asking what she'd do. Almost a riddle; a no-win conundrum. Savra answers as Savra always would. Vrasks is asked the same. Vraska says she wouldn't accept any of those options; she'd demand justice; insist upon it and not leave until that was delivered. Savra laughs at this - she knows nothing of rules of court or negotiations. Vraska argues that they live in filth and shit! In a city that's hidden, scorned. "We used to live in the *sun*!" she exclaims.

At this Izoni glows even brighter. "Yes, we did once live in the sun; as the spiritual leader, I choose Vraska."

The whole room erupts in noise. Vraska walks over the officiate, who is gasping in shock; Savra is trying to get down the stairs to him, but isn't able to get there in time - Vraska grabs the scroll and they walk out. Savra has too much pride to do anything; she turns and walks out, back to her chambers. The swarm just dissipates, spilling out in all directions, heading away.

Deni asks if went well. Gnog explains, given Vraska's answer to the question about negotiation - no, that went **spectacularly badly**. Gnog even gives brief thoughts to trying to take out Vraska, or something; it's hard to imagine tomorrow's meeting going well if someone in the room has that attitude.

Izoni walks up to us. Gnog gives it her with both barrels, but Izoni holds her ground; Vraska has a spark of life, a fire within her that Savra and Jared lack. They've been in the darkness - not alive either - for, well, millennia. Izoni believes that Vraska is a more powerful leader than any gorgon she's seen before; she managed to unify the Stone Sisters and make them a force to be reckoned with. She might be able to find solutions involving creativity and courage that Savra could not.

We learn that Vraska was not on Ravnica until recently. She returned a year ago. Doesn't know where she was prior. It's where she got her dress sense. She tells stories of ancient ziggurats set in lush jungles with wild creatures, giant monsters, and myths - legends - come to life. Quite unlike our own. She's the breath of life that this guild sorely needs. We have stagnated into our own death.

Gnog says, "Some of your argument is certainly persuasive. But I worry that her arrival is timed suspiciously. I hope that whatever it was that brought her back, it wasn't the same thing we're intending to fight. Because if so, she was placed here to disrupt - not to assist."

Izoni says we could always ask her where she'd been. Or ask someone like Niv Mizzet. He'd probably know.

"When sat in darkness, you must walk towards any light you see. I voted because we have to change. We cannot stay here; sinking, dying. I can only pray that I made the right choice." - she departs.

We are considering thanking Savra, but "Lady Savra is in convalescence and is not taking visitors". We say, "Please express our condolances and thanks for this rare insight she has given us into the Golgari. Remind her that we too will be at the meeting, and we are fully aware of her preferences for this guild."

We can't hang around; it's a long walk back to the surface. We start going until Fee-Ree says, "No. Fuck this -" (Gnog is quite surprised!) "- Grab a hold of Taz please" - so Gnog does. She reaches out and casts Fly on the three of us. We fly. Taz chuckles and goes "wheeeee!" as fly up and directly out of Deadbridge Chasm. On the way up, Gnog says, "Truly, fascinating place - one of the most interesting I've ever seen. Fully alien, and surely grotesque yet, I found myself not at all sicked, not by any of it, because it was *right* in that place. It was... Correct."

We fly as far as we can, ending up outside Kamen Fortress as the spell wears off after 10 minutes.

It's about 6pm. Gnog says, "so when exactly is 'tonight' at Niv Mizzet's tower?!" Fee-Ree says that if we hadn't made plans to go, we might be doing so anyway - since we want to ask about Vraska and have info about her being selected.

Gnog says, "True. Funny that. We'd have met at his tower just as he predicted..." - Fee-Ree glares at him! On the way Deni asks if we have time to get food. It's only 6, so sure, and we're in P4, so we know there's decent street food everywhere. That'll do. Fee-Ree's shout! That's nice of her and Gnog apologises for his joke about Niv's prediction for meeting at the tower; he knows it's quite a sore point for her, on many fronts.

We're at Nivix by 7pm, heading the now-familiar way up to Niv's tower via Ral's lab. As we arrive, Jace arrives too. He looks to us and says, "ah, good timing" and Gnog responds, "I think you knew *exactly* when we were going to be here!"

Gibo and Bebe are waiting for us at the lab. We greet them - they're about to go to dinner but "we were told that you were on the way so we thought we'd stick around to say hi". Gnog says, "well that's great, thank you. We delivered your letters to your mum, by the way!" and they head off. Someone else comes out of the lab at that moment, says "Ah! Ral's expecting you." Jace takes us in; we hear behind us, "Wait! Room for one more?!" it's Kaya. We greet her. Jace can use the teleport circle - of course - and we find that Ral, Nissa and Ajani are already there, along with Niv of course. *We're* the late ones. Oops. We awkwardly say hi. They've been there only for about 10 minutes.

* We have news about the Golgari, of course. Anyone else?
* Nissa says that there are nightmares running through the consciousness of the world (the Conclave). Some people have seen some frightening things. They're a bit shaken. Other than that, they're fine. Vigilance is high.
* Kaya says "Well my plan is proceeding apace; separately, I don't think Tesseret's here anymore. If he was, I *would* have found him by now."
* Niv Mizzet contradicts. "No. I'm sure of it. He's still here. But not for long."
* Nothing from Ajani.
* We explain that the Gorgon Stone Sisters have ended up successfully wrestling control of the Golgari. Vraska will attend the meeting. She is fierce and has a fire within her, but she's very stubborn and risks derailing negotiations...
* ...Taz perception 19. As Gnog talks about Vraska, Taz notices that Jace reacts - subtly - to Vraska's name, as if he recognises it; but then - insight 20+5! - notices that he pretends he didn't recognise it. As though, he was hiding his reaction...
* ...Gnog (unaware) asks Niv, what planet she was on a year ago. Niv says, "Hmmm - " and thinks, so Gnog explains, ziggurats, giant animals etc... DEX SAVE ALL ROUND:
  - Taz 16
  - Gnog 22
  - Deni OK
  - Fee-Ree OK
  - NPCs, fine, OK, whatever heh
* Niv has spun around to a bookshelf - his tail, leg and wings whirling around and nearly taking us all out. Telekenesis; pulls a book; flips pages; "Toril. Toril has ziggurats and jungles..." "But megafauna?" "Any language or...?" "No" "But pirates?" "Yes" "Hmm, not Toril then."
* Jace says "What about Ixalan?" - Niv checks - "yes, it could be!"
* Gnog asks if that has a connection to Nicol or the Consortium etc. - no, but... and Niv looks at Jace... and this Taz says, "I already know that Jace recognises the name." "Ixalan. Yes..." "No, Vraska" "No, I don't" he argues. Taz, insight 15, vs Jace 20, but Taz can't read it; but he looks to Deni, and then back to Jace, is clearly distressed at this, and says, "But you reacted. On the name." - and Deni is giving Taz a look of, "I don't know... I can't tell..."

At this, Gnog takes a step back. "Jace, you should know, I'm no longer in a position where I can fully trust you." Jace persuades Gnog otherwise, since the dice gods say so. Taz is quietly now very concerned. Taz realises not that Jace is *lying*, just that he's hiding something perhaps? But not even quite hiding. It's like he's lost something... Forgotten? He hides that he recognises the name, he's persuading people that he doesn't know her.

* Gnog turns back to Niv. "I asked about Ixalan and Nicol or the Consortium." "No, not them, not directly; you see Ixalan is where Azor exiled himself." 
* Gnog says, "Is Vraska the Immortal Sun?" "No. The Immortal Sun is an artefact, meant to trap Nicol Bolas on the plane of Ixalan."
* Gnog says, "We are tasked with working together. We cannot work together effectively with secrets." Jace insists there are no secrets he withholds consciously. Gnog answers, "and you, Niv?" "No secrets"
* Jace says, "It's just that *I* was on Ixalan for about half a year up until about a year ago myself, at least that's what I *think* I remember but I have big gaps in my memory. I know when I arrived there, I could not remember how I got there. And then, I joined a pirate vessel, until I got my memories back; and then I have another gap; and then I remember leaving. I remember meeting Azor, and checking on the Immortal Sun; I don't remember much else... I don't remember a Vraska from there. I know *of* her, I know she's a planeswalker, but I have no memory of her on Ixalan. You must believe me. There may be some other explanation for this."

Gnog answers, "Well, that *has* to be good enough; I can't let my own unease tear apart an alliance we only just formed..."

Niv says, "Well... I have something to say then... When I went to see Azor, he was distraugt; the Immortal Sun is missing." "How long ago?" "Less than a month ago." "Jace, any chance you or Vraska took it and don't remember?" "I don't know where I would've put it! It's quite large!" - and Niv describes it. A globe / sphere made of pure obsidian that is about five feet across. Solid. Very heavy; magic required to move it. It is suspended upon a field that makes it float and rotate. If activated - which it never has been, yet - planar travel on its plane of activation becomes impossible for *anyone*. Even via ship? Niv isn't sure, planar magic is disrupted; planeswalkers can't plane-shift or teleport. Perhaps gateways to the Astral Sea close, but if a ship was propelled by its own magic - not a nautiloid ship or Eberron vessel since those rip holes through planes - just those that go via the Astral Sea. The belief is, though, that Nicol Bolas is too large to be carried by any such vessel even if they could make it out (he's 30,000+ years old).

Azor had hidden it in a ziggurat; the whole thing was ripped out of the earth. Someone or something had planeswalked the *entire thing* away. Niv Mizzet says "...and as far as *I* know, that's impossible." 

What does this mean? Who might have it? Where might it be? Could it be used maliciously, to cripple and isolate a plane?

Jace notes that things on Amonkhet, where he was recently located to "keep an eye on Bolas", are seriously out of balance. The plane is most likely lost. But it's not really Bolas messing with stuff here to cause general distraction and strife - they thought that - but what's really happening is much, much worse. When Jace arrived, it seems like Bolas might have been planning something there for a very long time. Whatever he'd been planning is not far away from completion. Jace went there really, just to see for himself - and what he saw frightened him.

Nissa and Ajani speak up at this; they've both encountered Bolas before. They describe what happened on **Zendikar** (Nissa's planet) and another plane (**Alara**) he ravaged that they managed to save. They argue that he can't have had long-term plans on Amonkhet as he was focused on the attacks at Zendikar only five years ago... But Jace insists, saying that he must run multiple simultaneous plans. Jace suggests that he has several ways to success. He either perhaps cut his losses on those planes, or maybe it's a deliberate loss; precognition - start a fight there, lose it and - something something - win elsewhere. Just like Niv firing the IPB and - something something - we all end up on Ravnica.

Jace hopes that it's not too late to stop him. Niv disagrees. "No. I don't believe there's anything we can do for Amonkhet. I think the plane is lost." Nissa says - "But that's impossible! If it hasn't *already* been lost, surely we have a responsibility to do something!" Ajani agrees though Kaya is disinterested, focused here. Gnog asks if precognition showed anything about that, but Niv says, "I did not see us going to Amonkhet. That's not to say that going there has no merit; I only know that the paths to the slim chance of survival for us, that I can see, does not involve us going there."

Gnog asks about the 'future goes black' 4 days deadline. Jace explains that he can see no future beyond it. Niv disagrees; he recorded precognitive visions of those. Jace *remembers* the future, so to speak, so in Niv's case it's a series of possibilities whereas in Jace's case it's more certain. Gnog says, "A seer, a scryer, predicter of the future on my own world once looked at our futures. They said, 'I cannot see your future. I know not what that means'. It transpires that it meant the future wasn't written - that we had a chance."

Ajani and Nissa insist they should go to Amonkhet. If there's a chance, they must. Niv says they can't go. That's not the future he sees. Fee-Ree argues that he admitted it isn't *without* merit. Niv insists that we must attend the guild meeting. 

Taz tries, on his own volition, to persuade Ajani and Nissa of a greater good; it's callous perhaps, but if we lose on Amonkhet and die, we'll lose *all* planes. Perhaps it should take its chances. Persuasion: 19+13 (32!). Ajani is given pause. Perhaps, they can scry. He asks Nissa if she can take us through the "Dream Of The Blue Veil". She sighs. She'd prefer to be there. But she concedes; caution is wise. She agrees to perform this "dream". The two of them can take part; a third is possible. Taz immediately volunteers.

Niv arranges for everyone to stay at Nivix for the night. He's too nervous of people going off-script to let us out of his sight. Kaya protests. "I have things to do! I have places to be!" Niv argues, "No, I command you to stay." Gnog laughs and says he's surprised an intelligent, ancient dragon would make such a mistake - *commanding* Kaya is a good way to ensure she'll disobey! Gnog instead implores her to stay, for *our* comfort, to learn more about her world and history; and she agrees.

A meditation room is set up - with all kinds of magical dampeners - Nissa starts casting a spell, with Ajani and Taz beside her. All three sleep.

* The three journey through a complex dreamscape.
* Questions, puzzles, paths, mazes of the mind... Each go through this individually.
* There's a distant location, and the three converge. A portal that looks like a window.
* Nissa looks to Ajani and Ajani to Taz. "After you!"
* Nissa opens the window, which expands out and engulfs them.
* They stand in a desert, scorching hot. Two suns - one large, the other smaller and more distant. All around are sand dunes and rocks. No plants.
* We try to get bearings. Nissa says, "I didn't think Amonkhet looked like this?" Ajani says "This reminds me of places on Theros beyond the borders of civilisation."
* Taz: Perception 14+3->17. He sees a shimmer in the distance, like a mirage. He points it out. "That way?" Ajani: "Interesting..."
* Nissa summons worms. And to Taz's surprise, two greatworms emerge; so they are present on this plane too? Or it's just a dream/vision artefact? The worms allow us to ride and we speed towards the mirage.
* We pass ruins. Old cities.
* We reach the edge of a massive sand dune with a shimmer in front of us - it's not a mirage but a shimmering dome, some kind of wall, hundreds of feet high, maybe even thousands, curving away from us. It is cloudy in nature - we cannot see inside.
* There is a large river flowing through the dome, or at least, goes behind the wall.
* We disembark. Ajani walks forward to test the dome; it is a barrier, but we aren't really there; we can pass through. We push our consciousness through.
* Inside is a massive, sprawling, beautiful city with hanging gardens, fountains, canals, plazas and palaces. There is life here. The river flows through.
* We walk through. We are as if spectres - unseen. Markets, pavilions, arenas, ziggurats which look almost like pyramids but carved - temples, huge. Everything is on a grand scale. Intense civic and religious architecture.
* Along the centre line is a particularly huge ziggurat temple. At the top are two curving horns, that bow out, curve back in towards each other, then point upwards. Almost vase-shaped. None of us recognise this. It's on a monumental scale, even by Ravnican standards. Hundreds of feet high, towering over the city.
* We learn that the city is called **Naktamun**.
* We see processions of soldiers, acolytes, viziers, students... It's not hugely prosperous looking. We don't see much in the way of nobles. This is a culture gripped by religious control though - the huge number of temples and number of people dressed as viziers is an indicator.
* Unusual inhabitants. Many humans; cat people; naga-folk (snake people). Jackal-headed people. It's straight-up Stargate SG1 territory.
* We see gladiatorial combat events in arenas. We see worship of gods, part it seems of daily routine. There is one all-mighty, all-powerful above all others - the god Pharoah - who knows all.
* But we see mistreatment. We learn of scriptures and teachings and learn that the religion encourages and teaches violence, self-righteousness, avarice and militarisation. It is a religion that talks of faith and virtue and selflessness but practices the opposite.
* Ajani's insight into this is that it is a corrupted religion.
* Approaching the giant, largest ziggurat we see sculptures that allude to what this god Pharoah is - a huge, all-powerful dragon.
* Ajani says, "This *is* a long game! He has managed to corrupt the core religion of this plane to worship him as the almighty, benevolent god when he in fact a demon. The indoctrination required to pull something like this off is not something that can be achieved in mere years or decades."
* Taz says, "We alone cannot fix that. We can undo what has been done. If it was even possible, it would surely take hundreds of people, over decades of work."
* We witness the gleaming armies of this plane. We see the celebrations of the bloody and violent gladiatorial "Olympics" - fighting to the death. Only the strongest survive, elevated into army positions as heroes.
* There's a huge **workforce of undead** too - pure undead. Wrapped up like mummies. We hear that they are called "The anointed". The have no identity and perform all menial work.
* Armies go out past this city, to other remnant cities and fallen kingdoms; they raid and pillage, bringing back survivors to serve as slaves and sacrifices - in their religion, this is virtuous. It is an attempt to draw the favourable eye of their god.
* Prophecies: **When the 2nd Sun sits in the middle of the horns** on the temple, the **Coming Of The Hours** will begin. A series of divine events meant to exhault and elevate the city and all of its Faithful into the heavens.
* Interestingly, we manage to see that there are other gods on this plane. They have their own grand temples, although nothing of the scale of that main one.
  - A crocodile-headed god
  - An ibis-headed god
  - A cat-head god
  - A jackal-headed god
  - A cobra-headed god
  - (Yes, it's basically a very strong analogue to ancient Egypt, intentionally; this is indeed Stargate).
* We witness one emerge! The ibis-headed god emerges, presiding over "The trial of knowledge", so this God is apparently real, or at least is represented physically here. It's a trial that a hopeful acolyte does in order to raise themselves up in society. Even this is corrupted towards militarisation and selfishness.
* We witness dissenters - crying out, "The god Pharoah is not a real god! The things that they ask of the people cannot be what a god would ask for, because they are evil! It is an evil request! This is no god, it is a demon" - running through streets, pursued; captured; locked away. Silenced.
* **As a side-note: Taz is horrified by what he sees.**
* We feel the spell starting to weaken but before it fails we see, beyond the other side of the river, massive mines. Blueish metal is being taken to large forges, being turned into armour plating. It seems the top-ranking soldiers wear it. The alloy is called "**Lazotep**" and appears to be magical.
* There is the sense that the 2nd sun is a matter of days away from reaching the position described in prophecy. We can see it's almost aligned already.
* Nissa looks to us. "We have to go" - so, we go.

At this, we'll awaken. It'll be the next day.

(END OF PART 16 - Part 17 next)
