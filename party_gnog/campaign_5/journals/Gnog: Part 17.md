# Gnog: Part 17
## Day 46 (Ravnica 26, Riglan 83 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Tuesday (7 day week)

Nissa, Ajani and Taz have been 'dream walking' to see what's happening on Amonkeht. The three awaken - unrested - in the meditation chamber that was set up within Niv's quarters in this tower at Nivix. It is 5am.

Taz says nothing. He looks to the two. They get the impression he's going to speak, but then he just shuts down.

A few hours later, Gnog, Fee-Ree and Deni wake and quickly move to find out what happened. We see Taz stood in the middle of the meditation room, apparently "asleep". Ajani and Nissa are there. They explain that Taz hasn't said anything and just appeared to immediately sleep. They relay what happened, over breakfast and coffee - Ajani persuades Niv Mizzet to allow us out of Nivix to have coffee and ringbread, at Deni's insistence! 

Later, in due course, Niv is also brought up to speed - the corruption, the undead, the alloy and the prophecy. "Well, that very much sounds like Bolas! To fancy himself a god."

Gnog points out that he has planetary resources and the prophecy roughly aligns with our own "missing" future. "The most reasonable conclusion now is that this point it time marks the attack. We have a little under two and a half days."

Niv pulls out a book. He's been there before, but he didn't study the religion. He says there are - or were - *eight* gods on the planet. Nissa and Ajani only saw evidence of five. "The plane itself, according to this, is a dying plane" says Niv. "It suffers from a curse of magic. The original spiritual leaders/clergy/clerics together with the gods, tried to create a utopia where people could enjoy eternal life. "Heaven on earth" - not undeath; eternal life." "It went wrong?" "It succeeded for a time. Their population simply did not die of old age - but the strain on the weave, the magical resources of the plane became so great that it was turning into a hollow shell, drained of all life-giving magic; the spell became corrupted, so that people would die but then *nothing* remain dead - instead of eternal life, it became guaranteed undeath."

Of course. You can't bring life across the bridge so need undead for an army if you want to conquer a planet, but that needs to be a *big* army, so where would you get so many undead? How about a planet where everyone that's died for centuries has already become undead?

Niv agrees except for that being a bit shallow. Magic there is severely limited; it's not a useful plane in any other way. The weave is too drained. Nissa then realises - "yes, but then there would be nobody to stand in the way of a powerful being like Bolas. There wouldn't be other powerful beings." We realise that he couldn't just throw big spells around though - the weave itself had little energy and even though he was the strongest at commanding it, this command had little power behind it - but instead he used his most-powerful-being state to be able to corrupt the world instead, bend its will to him.

But what's he trying to do, in the end?

* Nissa says - on Zendikar, Bolas tried to draw all of the energy and magic that held the Hedrons together, sapping that power, to make it his own. There was no way he could command the creatures he might then release, they are cosmic-level horrors. Was he just trying to sow chaos by releasing them into the multiverse? Ultimately it's the magic that held the hedrons together that he was after. He got *some* of it.
* Ajani - ah, just as he got some of, but not all of the magic on Alara. A few hundred years ago **during the Cataclysm (oh! that happened on a few different worlds, at the same time)** there was a sundering and it split into five shards. Each shard could not access any other. They developed independently. Over time those walls fell, but the planes were still separated. Bolas insinuated himself into each through his agents, brought about a prophecy to bring about the convergence - "The conflux" as he called it - but this process, which did work, released a *massive* amount of magical power. Bolas fed off it. Ajani personally fought him - that's how he lost his eye. "I died! He killed me! But I was immersed in the restorative healing magic of the Shard Of Bant and was resurrected by an angel. That was my redemption."

Gnog says, "Well that's what we've heard. He consumes magic..." and the question then arises of, why Ravnica? It has no special magic, particularly; no more than many other worlds, and can mount a formidable defence. He's *choosing* Ravnica. He could just as well have chosen, say, Toril for a chunk of magic! Gnog asks Niv about "the spark", but it's not anything special about Ravnica. It's the kernel of power that eventually emerges in someone proficient enough in magic to be able to bend reality to the point where they can cross planes. (In technical terms - the ability to cast L7 Teleport or L8, depending on class. It should've emerged in Fee-Ree sooner; perhaps the damage to the weave on Toril from the war interfered. But then Fee-Ree teleported *to the moon* - a huge spell - within the 'verdent' Ravnican weave. Moving between two celestial bodies; pretty much planes-walking. She went beyond the point where any creature could, given enough time, simply fly. Fee-Ree became a planes-walker.

A theory might be regarding laylines that the device Tesseret seemed to have been assembling might be designed to draw *all* power and shatter the field that holds the megafauna. More or less instant chaos, and a good time for an army to invade *after*.

Jace says it's nearly time to leave. It's 11am. Taz is waking up; he comes into the room, walks straight up to Gnog, looks him straight in the eye and says, "We *MUST* stop Bolas. I have seen Amonkhet. We *MUST* stop Bolas. Promise me." Gnog says, "well, yes, that's the plan, I mean, I can promise we're certainly going to try or - I dare say die in the effort... But I can't promise success and you know that." Taz just says, "That will do. We should proceed to the Chamber."

We get ready to go. Deni asks if there's a dress code; nope, we just need to clean up. Niv won't attend. Ral attends in his stead. He's the emissary... this reminds Gnog. He asks Niv for his *word* that he'd resign and hand to the 2ic - emphasis 2ic - and Niv says; yes. Ral would run the League. And Jace would give up the power, freeing him to do what he needs to do. Kaya says, "Hmm, I wonder who the Orzhov ended up choosing last night..." - that's what she had planned to do last night.

We reach the Chamber. Banners everywhere. The "Congress Of The Guilds". This will be the 2,337th Guild Summit (!). There's a special hall for it. Security details are assigned by the Chamber Of The Guildpact alongside the personal security that the Paruns have (so Ral gets this). The Four do not get special security; Jace has Leviasha. We're asked if we're Ral's security - sure, why not. Should we have brought someone? But late now... The Four are now Ral's personal security. The meeting hall is circular, cheese wedges for each guild but with the central area open. Each wedge has ten sending stones - 9 for each of the other guilds, with symbols on them; the 10th for the Chamber itself (the officiator, we guess).

Each Guild is assigned an apartment in the nearby dignitaries hotel. Deni gives Gnog the look of, "see, I told you it was like Waterdeep, these meetings go on forever...". 

**Levisha calls the summit to order.**

Each guild is formally acknowledged.

* **Vraska** is there with a surprisingly light security detail; in a very unusual show of solidarity, she has a **Golgari shaman** and a **Kraul warrior** with her. All three factions are represented. Gnog uses the sending stone to Vraska: "It gives me hope and confidence to see all three major factions of the Golgari represented. Thank you for bringing them."
* Representing the Boros is **Aurelia**, with **Feather** by her side.
* Representing the Orzhov is none other than **Antonio Vuliev.** We wonder what the connection might be between them and Tesseret.
* Selesnya is represented by **Emmera**, a wild elf druid.
* Gruul - yay, **Boboremos**!
* Rakdos - **Hekara** with whom we never had time to speak.

Kaya is with the Orzhov. Nissa is with the Selesnyans. Ajani stands with Jace. We are with Ral.

Order of business:

* Jace is back. Returned from Amonkhet.
* There is a real and present danger to Ravnica. Jace believes that outside forces threaten to invade.
* He is unable to continue fulfilling his duties as the Guild Pact because he believes he will be needed in the days to come in defence of the city... The planet.

Questions, rebuttals, concerns... Everyone gets to say their piece. Despite what they've just heard, people still seem to try and air their grievances in their little speeches. The Orzhov in particular talk about harassment, barriers to trade and lawlessness, damage to their trade network; destruction of the only planetary port in particular. (Good grief).

This goes on for a good *hour*. Jace eventually says, "We need to take stock of our defences. We need to bolster them and to be vigilant. *We must work together*. Now is not the time for us to be in confrontation with each other. Now is the time for you to unite."

**Isperia** (the sphinx and current leader of the Azorious) is there, and he's accompanied by the head of the Liev Column - a blue-skinned precog mage of great power called **Dovan**. He chimes in to say he agrees. Dark times ahead. His precogs have seen frightening things. Dovan describes this.

The Orzhov speak. They challenge the presence of Dovan in the Hall; he's speaking, therefore it is unfair as the Azorious have in effect two representatives. This question is put to Isperia, by Levisha; Isperia says, "No, Dovan is here as my bodyguard. We apologise - he will no longer be speaking." The Orzhov are satisfied.

Gnog notes that surprisingly, the Selesnyans have not spoken despite knowing that they've had "dark dreams" within the Conclave. The Boros and Dimir have also remained silent.

The Gruul pipe up. Boboremos himself steps forward. He says that "there is much happening out in the wilds, the wastes. Things to which the city folk would be wise to pay attention." He explains a powerful contingent - an encampment - of the Gruul are in P4, the largest gathering of tribes at Skarrg that there has been for several millennia. They will listen to what Jace is proposing but "will Jace please be more open and direct with his proposal - what exactly is it that is being proposed?" - if it is an army they posit that the Orzhov private army, the Selesnyan body, the Gruul tribes and the Boros soldiers, they can surely mount a defence. "Where is this invasion coming from? Who is invading us? What are they invading us for? This is what we must know. Can we not preemptively strike to weaken our foe?"

This seems to focus the minds of other guilds too, who forget their squabbles for a moment at these eminently reasonable questions and start asking the same.

Vraska steps up. "Do not forget us! If it is bodies and numbers you need, those who will fall and rise again - there are no allies stronger than the Golgari. You forget us at your own peril." Boboremos nods but Vraska continues. "We must... We must work together. Look towards the old agreements, the old Pact." She looks at Jace; "It is time that the Guild Pact was recreated. Rather than being *invested* in a fallible *person* with their own agenda, their own reasons and motivations." Gasps and murmurs! Jace calms people down; he's not fazed. Vraska continues. "The Golgari have spoken with the Rakdos" - she looks at **Hekara** - "and we *jointly* propose that the rituals to reinstate the power of the Guild Pact should be a priority; to divest its agency from Jace, who spends extended periods of time away from this world, pursuing his own affairs - his own goals. Not ours. I pass the Chair to our allies in the Rakdos."

(This obviously causes a lot of raised eyebrows).

Hekara stands. "I thank my sister in the Golgari for seeing reason and looking past prejudices of old. This is the model of working together. Yes, we support your proposal. We would like to formally put it to this council that the power of the Guild Pact be divested from Jace."

Isperia stands; "I hear you. It is however not so easy as you believe, child! The magic to create the balance of the Guild Pact took Azor and Niv Mizzet *decades* to weave. Do we have decades? Is this really a priority right now?"

(Gnog uses sending stone to Isperia, then to Hekara, then to Vraska and simply says - "We have only two days" to each of them).

Jace responds, "I have no objection to divesting power however we bring a counter-proposal. I would like to hand the Chair to Ral Zarek of the Izzet League."

Ral stands. "I would like to bring in Niv Mizzet to speak of a grand plan that he has crafted; with the agreement of this council we can start on that plan immediately." people start shouting out things about foul play, conspiracy; much suspicion and distrust. Things are splintering. Levinia calls things to order: "I believe it is time for us to take a short recess. Please. Please! Head to your rooms and we will reconvene in 40 minutes when minds are clearer, tempers less flared and calmer discourse can be resumed. I call the summit to recess."

Back at the apartment, before the door has even shut, Gnog says to Ral, somewhat angry, "Look, what did you expect?! You tell them *nothing*, no information, no proof, just a vague threat and a solution that involves taking all power. Why was it so vague?!" Ral is dismissive! He says that we'll get to that in due course; a question is asked of the council - by the Gruul unusually - so questions on the record will be re-read after recess and answered. But Ral insists he needs to present Niv's plan and must have it approved by the end of the day.

Niv is contacted by Ral and agrees to project his presence into the chamber.

Multiple votes are needed, explains Ral:

* Everyone agrees to divest power from Jace
* Agree on where that power goes
* After all evidence shared, vote on working together
* Vote on a plan of action
* Vote on a timeline
* Write a resolution and vote to agree on it
* Vote on assigning people to be part of the plan

Gnog says "OK, and round about half way through that Bolas invades and I won't have to sit through the meeting anymore!"

We're called back down. Time has flown. Questions are, indeed, re-read. Jace asks Ral to put forward evidence and information on what is known (in answer to the Gruul) and asks Isperia if any of it can be corroborated; a fair amount can. The same is put to the Boros who talk about disturbances and the bits that overlap for them. A few other guilds are suspicious - they've not heard or seen any of it - but then Emmera, of Selesnya, finally speaks. "We can confirm. One of our elders - our Vodas - was brutally murdered by a force not of this world. This threat *is* real" - and the Boros then reveal that they were in fact they were involved in the rescue of an airship with a Captain killed by the same means. Mounting evidence that this external threat is indeed real.

Ral says, "With the council's permission, Niv Mizzet would like to speak and propose a solution, but before we do so, are the Council in agreement about the living Guild Pact's powers? That they should be divested?" This is formally put forward as a vote issue and seconded. A ballot is created; conversation continues in the mean time.

Niv appears as an illusion. He explains how he enacted a plan started seven years ago, leading ultimately to this day. If the council does vote to divest power of the Guild Pact from Jace, then he is proposing that Niv himself will step down as founder and Parun of the Izzet League, becoming Guildless, to step into the place of the Living Guild Pact.

The room erupts.

The Rakdos and Vraska fling accusations across the room. Boboremos looks very disappointed. The Simic join in the clamour. Hikara says, "If *anyone* is to hold this power, Rakdos himself is far more suited, for he has no agenda!" and of course many disagree.

Gnog perception 18: The sole representative from the Dimir is not there. She came into the room but seems to have disappeared. Gnog points this out to Ral. He's preoccupied. Deni asks for permission to sneak away to find the Dimir - of course! Gnog sends to Boboremos, "Not my favourite plan either, but have faith; it might be our only hope; it sounds crazy, but I do trust Niv now."

Levisha is trying to call for order. It's not working, but she keeps trying and does, eventually, get the room under control. It is *very* heated of course. They take turns to speak but each one is very firey.

Supporting:

* Azorius
* Boros
* Gruul (technically on the fence)
* Izzet (obviously)
* Orzhov (strangely - Kaya perhaps)

Opposed or wary:

* Selesnya (Nissa is trying to convince them)
* Rakdos
* Golgari
* Simic

Missing:

* Dimir

Eventually Niv says that he'd like to identify those he's called to Ravnica's defence. "There are five. Nissa, Ajani, Gnog, Fee-Ree, Taz" - but not Deni, not Kaya and not Jace. Why's he being deceptive? He implores the council to listen to what we have to say. He'd perhaps realised he couldn't call out Kaya and couldn't see Kaya. Perhaps couldn't reveal Jace was in cahoots. Gnog's still uncomfortable with that.

Permission is given. The council say they'll listen.

Gnog encourages Nissa and Ajani to describe briefly what happened to them regarding Nicol Bolas. They do so. They also call Taz forward to describe Amonkhet. Taz is more passionate than Gnog has *ever* seen him. Taz with BFS -> 30 total, including minor illusions. People are certainly now convinced there is a threat - but of course, not at all convinced that Niv should have the power yet.

Speaker **Zegana** is there, representing the Simic. She asks some questions; she's quite calm, but clearly suspicious and analytical. "What assurances can be given by the Izzet - apologies - Niv Mizzet - what assurances can be given by Niv Mizzet that this power that you're asking for will be divested into the next evolution? You ask for this power to wield the magic of the Guild Pact, of its enforceability, of its raw magic; in defence of the planet. How are we to know that once this threat is over, you will willingly give this power up, instead of hoarding it for yourself?"

Niv says he's willing and, indeed, insists that the resolution states and (magically) binds him to divest the power upon successful defence of Ravnica. Ral Zarek will be caretaker of the Izzet League as its Guildmaster while he wields the power.

Vraska says, "That's nonsense! You're not guildless, you're just putting a puppet in place! You cannot have vested interests in the Izzet League. You're giving up nothing if you step down, only to take the mantle back up later. Lies! Utter lies! How are we to trust you?" She also accuses the Azorius for supporting what she calls an entirely illegal and corrupt power-grab.

Gnog tries to shout through. "I have my doubts too. The manner in which we were brought here by Niv was cruel. It was dispassionate. It was, it seems, required! Ravnica, without a solid plan, will fall; and other planes thereafter. I see no better path. You disagree with this plan; but you must suggest a better one, and show how this will give a better chance of success."

It doesn't work. Vraska even accuses Niv of fabricating it all; Nicol Bolas might not even be real. At least now only the Golgari and Rakdos are holdouts. At this moment Gnog notices that the Dimir rep is back, with Deni in the area! "Under cover". She stands, holds her stone up and waits for her turn; then speaks. "We are willing to play our part in enforcing the return of power from Niv Mizzet, should there be any resistance."

Gnog looks to Niv. "Niv Mizzet, I think there may be little doubt that you would give up the power. The question remaining is perhaps one of your neutrality and sacrifice. I do not believe you can simply temporarily hand over the Izzet League. For your plan to happen, it seems to me that you need to pass it on. As the Golgari have recognised that they must grow and evolve, so too must the Izzet."

Niv isn't in a good space. He goes on a litany. He describes the beginning days. His arrival to the world of Ravnica. The first 6000 years, before the Guild Pact, the megafauna. He speaks of what he and Azor had to accomplish. He talks about forming the Izzet League as experimenters who have created every technological marvel that this world has known. "But I can... I *can* step away from that, for I am more than just the Izzet League. But they are my children. And they will forever be my children. But I see the whole of Ravnica as my children, too, now. I understand this plane and I care for it more than anything else in the multiverse. More than any living being on this planet *I* am its most capable protector. I will devote my existence to the balance, protection and nourishment of Ravnica to be the best that it can be. All I ask is that you invest the power of the Guild Pact in me to defend the plane; and after that, I *will* willingly work with Isperia to uncover the secrets of old that Azor and I created to build the Laylines of this planet and infuse the magic of the Guild Pact into it. I *will* willingly do this. I do trust that my actions between now and then will give you enough faith in me that I *only* hold the best intentions; that I *only* keep what Ravnica needs in the forefront of my mind. I am the most intelligent being on this plane, if not the oldest. This is my role and I will willingly do it. I just need you to have the vision and the faith to allow me to do it. If this cannot turn your heart, I know not what else to do. I will leave it to you, esteemed members of the Council. I wait to hear your decision" - and his illusion fades.

Taz says, "Niv will relinquish power. Niv will let go of the Izzet, after millennia of stewartship. He recognises what you recognise Vraska - the need to be open, honest and to let things evolve. Can you see past your understandable suspicions and doubts, and take that last leap of faith?"

Vraska is smouldering away, since it seems the room is moving away from her position. Isperia stands forward. "Vraska. The Golgari. Where is Savra? Why is she not here?" Vraska is venomous! "*I* was chosen as the emissary. Anything you have to say to the Golgari you have to say to *me!*" "Vraska... The Golgari. Help me to understand your concerns. They've been answered; why do you withhold your support. Now, the Rakdos I understand - they exist only to destroy and sow chaos, so for them not to agree - it is in their nature. But that is not the nature of the Golgari." Vraska argues that nobody should tell her what the Golgari nature is.

Gnog heads to the bottom of the 'wedge' with Vraska in it, Taz by his side. "Vraska. You are honourable. And you were chosen. You have brought wide representation of the Golgari. You are visible and seen. You are not overlooked." - he tries to implore her to support. She says he is very brave to stand so close! Her hair flares up - but she does not attack. "Draw the resolution", she says. "I will not be moved."

It's 8-vs-2 and there's nothing else we seem to be able to do about it.

There are some votes. Jace to be divested of power; the room agrees. The resolution that unites the guilds in defence is largely passed with some details punted to next day. Basically, most of the list that Ral mentioned is covered off.

It's late, at least 6pm. The final resolution to invest power in Niv is read and modified; Vraska just sits silently, not engaging. A little after 7pm it's read for the last time; a vote is called, but Vraska disagrees. She says it should be voted upon in the morning as well. Rakdos seconds it. It gets put to a vote; punted to the next day.

The summit is adjourned. Lavisha is clearly exhausted.

Discussions and private meetings are permitted but we must stay on hotel grounds. Gnog requests a meeting with Vraska - "I want to understand your worries more. I want to understand what you think will happen if the final motion passes." He's quite surprised - she agrees to meet. She's tired and asks that it's done over dinner - certainly! Deni has rejoined us, so we head down to the hotel restaurant. It's a bit awkward as people are mostly staying in their isolated delegations. We all sit down. (Deni tells us that the Dimir rep was passing things up-the-chain; she's just an emissary; so needed authorisation to say that they'd enforce the agreement).

Vraska, in summary, does not trust Niv. "We're exchanging one dragon for another. He's very old. He's also responsible for much of the calamity that's happened here! Even in the short space of time that I've been alive -" (she's only 38) "- I've witnessed some half-dozen calamities for which the Izzet were responsible. Handing the almighty power of the Guild Pact to Niv Mizzet sounds like insanity. What's he going to do with it in defence of the planet? Why does he need it? Is he going to draw on the power of the Laylines? For what, some crazy spell he's going to cast? You've seen what happens when he does stuff like that. He doesn't care about anyone; how many die around him. I know it's irony coming from me - a gorgon! - but I value life; I don't think he does. He thinks he's better than all of us; he said as much. Why would you give someone like that more power. And once he has that power, how are we ever to take it off him? And also, the exit clause for the power is that *he* investigates a way to rebuild the Guild Pact? He can just delay that. Nothing in this smells good! I don't understand why warning bells are not going off for everyone else."

Gnog basically agrees; with candor he explains that he simply sees no better plan. But he too wants answers, and plans to sneak out.

Eventually we wrap up. Vraska is leaving but is intercepted by someone being not-so-stealthy (Gnog perception only 14). Deni is studying them. Vraska changes direction to follow the other person. Deni says, "That was one of the Orzhovians." Gnog says, "Can you follow?" "Yes. On it!" and she sneaks off.

The rest of us head to find Ral, who can open a conduit to talk to Niv; this means we don't have to leave Ral without protection. He pulls out a mirror - a portal mirror. We talk to Niv through it. He wants this power. OK. What's he gonna do with it? Niv argues that Bolas is *very* powerful; Niv needs to harness all latent power captured and channelled into the Laylines by Azor. He wants to use the *planet* against Bolas. The power of the guild pact is a magically enforcing power - part of the 'built-in' authority that lets the Living Guild Pact arbitrate disputes and is why, when decisions / judgements are made, they are enforced. It's tied to the ebb, flow, balance of every guild. Niv will be able to draw on the unity and cooperation of the guilds. Bringing them together in defence.

Gnog asks if anyone else can perform that task. "Not to the ability that I can. I am the worthiest opponent for Bolas. I too am a dragon. I too wield power. And although I'm not as old as he, I'm significantly older than any other being save the undead and demons."

Gnog then asks, "And you have of course accounted for the fact that Bolas, surely, predicted exactly this move and is probably counting on it?" "Yes. Which is why I have plan B and C and ... - all working at the same time."

* Long discussion thereafter, but Niv does agree that there's a risk with the leylines and will ask Isperia to implement a "key", a signature so that in theory only the disruptor will be able to pull power from the Platform. Not whatever Tesseret built. Niv asks us to speak on his behalf; sure!

* OK, so we do that. Isperia up close she is impressive. Large, white sphinx; a white lion with eagle wings and the head of a woman. Dovan is also quite intimidating and looming, but Isperia asks for privacy and he excuses himself. We share our concerns about layline draw and freeing megafauna perhaps just to cause chaos, or to release more energy; Nikya might be able to break the spell. **She agrees that the "key" can be implemented - she can get it done in a day. She says it will be her top priority after the summit.**

She reveals that she *can* force the judgement tomorrow. It only needs 8 out of 10 to pass into law; the only argument though is that something related to the guild pact. *Changing* the guild pact requires unanimous agreement, but there's a reading of the situation that says this is just a temporary transference of the *same* power from one living being to another. But she hopes it doesn't come to doing it.

We finish up. Back at the room, we let Ral know so Niv can be informed. Before bedtime, Deni returns. She witnessed a meeting; a ghost was present with Antonio, who we hadn't seen before; they had a proposal for Vraska that they'd be willing to support her bid but they required the Golgari's support in return for building projects that they have. Vraska did not immediately agree, which is the only saving grace.

Bedtime.



## Day 47 (Ravnica 27, Riglan 84 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Wednesday (7 day week)

Early in the morning there's a blood-curdling scream. We run outside. Guards are running the hallway towards the other end. A hotel attendant is stood outside a door screaming, a tray of breakfast dropped broken on the floor. We run there.

**In the Azorius room, there is Isperia. She's been turned to stone.**

"Fu..." starts Gnog, then - "Taz! Message Vraska please - 'Isperia turned to stone. We think you're being set up. Please be very careful!'"

Next Gnog shouts for "Anyone with Greater Restoration? Find someone, quick!" - but we're told that this can't be used. **Isperia hasn't just been turned to stone; she's been fractured afterwards.** We look closer and see fracture lines throughout. We ask for someone to get Feather of the Azorious but they're already aware. We've shown our investigation badges. Dovan is still here and he's in one piece; he insists that the body be taken *carefully* to New Prahv. Levisha has to release protocol to allow someone to leave. Dovan assumes that the meeting will be postponed or cancelled; Levisha says that "now more than ever" it must be convened. Word will be sent to New Prahv to send another representative.

We learn that Vraska has been arrest. She has pled immunity, but has not claimed innocence. She refuses to make any statements.

The meeting is postponed by only half an hour; Nissa and Ajani find us. Gnog brings them up to speed - keying the leylines; letting 8 vs 2 be enough, but Orzhov maybe swayed to 7 vs 3; if we can't come up with something, Ravnica will fall.

Outside the dining hall there are heated arguments. Some of the guild representatives believe that the meeting must continue. Others threaten to walk out. "Nobody is safe here!" and all that. Gnog and Taz go up and say something like, "We are heartbroken, the loss of Isperia is a bigger blow than you know - devastating - and you are absolutely right to be concerned, but you know the threat and this is the face of it! You can leave this hall but you cannot run or hide anywhere, for all of Ravnica is in peril. You MUST attend."

Levisha is, regarldess, not taking 'no' for an answer. If they want to break protocol, they can propose it and that'll be voted upon - but you don't just walk away.

At 9:30 - and we didn't get breakfast - the meeting reconvenes. More guards are present. We find that guards at Isperia's door were put to sleep by magic and have no recollection.

Hikara (Rakdos) is present. Vraska too, surprisingly, despite arrest - no charges yet (Golgari). Nissa is at Amara's side (Selesnya). Ajani has joined the Boros. Other guilds represented as before. Ral has already brought Niv up to speed; he arrives late. Dovan takes the stand and announces formally the brutal and tragic death of Isperia. "Our very institutions have been attacked within the sanctity of the chambers of the Guild Pact in session. This will be responded to with force. As my first action as the new Guild Leader of the Azorius, I am declaring Martial Law across District 10. As a condition of this, anyone practicing shielding and nondetection magic to hide from my precogs will be in direct contravention of the terms of martial law." Gnog sends (via Chamber sending stone), "We MUST speak to the council urgently". People call for Jace to intervene. It's an overreach. And an overreaction; it wasn't District Ten that did this.

Lavisha gives us leave to approach the stand. Taz and Gnog confer for a while, then Gnog lifts Taz up onto the podium and Taz addresses the guilds. "Honoured guild representatives, we have witnessed a tragedy today of almost incomprehensible scale. *This* is a facet of the treat we face. *This* is the chaos and disention that Bolas sews. It is reasonable to want to respond with force, it is reasonable to want to assert control; but this is an error. This plays into Bolas' hands. He needs us divided. He needs us distracted. He needs us disabled, bowed down, held down by law, or by violence, or by any means. I urge the Azorious, despite their grief, to reconsider that act; whatever happened today happened within the boundaries of the Chamber, not within wider Ravnica or District Ten. We *must work together* to defend against this threat. More now than ever. We've just had a major advantage on our side taken away; we are more exposed than ever. I urge you all to please, look past the emotions, look past the grief, look past your individual fear, and look to the defence of Ravnica."

Taz: Persuasion, nat 20! + 13 -> 33. Holy shit.

Dovan eyes up Taz. Gnog insight 18. Dovan is calculating. He's reading the room; Taz has swayed many. He gives what feels very like a prepared speech which in essence makes him seem terribly magnanimous and so-on; he withdraws the decree of Martial Law; however, he declares Martial Law on the grounds of New Prahv. A screening border will be established.

Jace steps forward. "We have items upon which to vote. Is the council able to proceed? Are there any objections to the vote?" - the Selesnyans step forward; "we propose that the vote continues as planned." The Dimir: "we counter with a proposal that the vote is delayed for we do not have enough information here. We don't believe that a decision can be made with clear minds in light of what has happened." - they're probably trying to prevent the motion from being *defeated* - Hikara and Vraska jump out of their seats to demand it not be delayed. The Orzhov agree it should continue. At this, Gnog and Ral agree that it should be delayed - there's more afoot here - Ral says that he **withdraws the proposal**. The Azorius say it should be continued, but with the proposal withdrawn there's nothing upon which to vote. Out of frustration, Boboremos stands - "So what have we achieved? Nothing! We have achieved nothing! We are worse off after this than we were before. We know more but we do less!"

Gnog just calls over to him, "Patience. Politics are afoot; sculduggery too; there is much to assess before we proceed; with Isperia killed, Ral's plan could not be actioned. None of us have any intention of seeing Ravnica fall."

Hikara stands. She exercises the vote of dissolution. Vraska, Boboremos, Dovan and the Dimir vote in favour. Selesnya, Boros, Izzit, Simic vote against; Levinia says that the Chamber elects to continue. Antonio stands; pauses, then says, "The Orzhov vote to dissolve". So that's that. The chamber erupts; the doors are opened and the summit is disbanded.

### 3000 XP for council meeting, despite failure; we donate 500 each to Taz; he gets 4500 -> LEVEL 11 (BARD 9)

Ajani and Nissa come over. Nissa looks hopeless, Ajani stoic. Jace is inscruitable. Where's Kaya? Nowhere to be seen. Deni goes to find her. Gnog says to Fee-Ree, "If I were you, I'd have a teleport to the ship ready. I mean, there's nowhere to run, but it'd be nice to see Goliath Drinks one more time before Bolas comes for Toril... Does anyone have any ideas? We seem to be, how shall I put this, comprehensively fucked?" Looks to Ral. "Plan B?" "Plan C now. *This* was Plan B" "Wait, what was Plan A?!" "Stopping him on Amonkhet - finding the Immortal Sun and trapping him". "Plan C is the disruptor?" "Yes."

Before we can continue - Kaya arrives with Deni. Kaya is fuming but silent. Gnog says, "The Orzhov and Vraska cut a deal last night." "Yes. Yes, I have been too focussed on Tesseret; I did not see the treacherous snake right in front of my nose - the Obsidat have been plotting this entire time. Plotting to seize control. I need to do what I should've done in the very first place - I can't talk about it here." Gnog says, "You need to nothing of the sort. Taking your eye off the ball for revenge was what caused that mistake - we all make them - don't make it twice." "I think the Obsidat are working with Tesseret; there's no other reason why there are so many links back to the Orzhov... I need your help to do this." "OK, well, at least I should hear what you propose; where can we talk?" Kaya provides a location.

So, we have a disruptor to try and stop the bridge. But what about the Star Moths? Ral says there's "yes. There is a plan". Gnog gets angry - "WE HAVE A DAY AND A HALF! I'm tired of all these secrets. NOW is the time to tell us what's going on." Jace says we need to go P6; we have  a mutual friend there. "Now?" asks Gnog. Nissa says she has to go to Vitu Ghazi to try and calm people down. They just saw another assassination. Ajani needs to go the Boros; Gnog asks him to check with Feather and look *very* closely at Dovan. Ajani agress.

Jace invites us to come with him to P6. As we walk, Kaya communicates with Gnog telepathically. "I'm going to do it. I know how." Gnog thinks back, "Do what?" "Kill the Obsidat! Remove them from the equation; remove them from power. Release that stranglehold they have over the Orzhov and all of its resources. Cut Tesseret off." Gnog says, "But two questions; one, the moral implications if you're wrong about them..." "...They deserve to die regardless! They're pure evil." "So is Rakdos. It's awful, it's how this planet works, I hate it but it's how it works." "They've grown fat off the blood of the people." "Well, question two; what if Tesseret has what he needs already? What if he just activates his device when we activate ours, so ours fails?" She doesn't answer. So Gnog just says, "I understand your plan. I don't know if I agree, but I will think on it."

We get to P6. Up to Foundary Street. Onto catwalks, down fire escapes to a familiar courtyard. Jace opens a portal through the door to Vi's warehouse, just after midday. **Vi is there.** "What is the point of having doors if you're not at least going to use them?!" Jace answers "Vi! Good to see you to." "No time for niceties. We have a world on the bring of collapse. Tea, anyone?" Gnog says, "By Avernus, yes. You must've heard it was a - politely - unmitigated disaster today? The loss of Isperia is... Incalculable." "Yes. Yes, that's right. Niv Mizzet did suggest there was one timeline, one future, where that happened; I thought we'd avoided that one." Gnog says, "My fault perhaps; I think I was persuaded that maybe, just maybe, Vraska might be the wildcard the Golgari needed." Jace turns to us. His eyes turn blue (Vi says "I hate it when he does that...") Jace says, "Vraska is still important. She's one of the key players. We need her." Deni argues back; Gnog says, "Well, at least I'm glad I had Taz warn her, then... She might be friendly." Deni is incredulous.

Vi pours tea for all - even for Taz. "Trade you for a ring?" Taz says, "Ah yes! Thank you! In the end, the Dimir were friendly, but this provided tremendous peace of mind." He hands the ring back.

Vi turns to us. "Word has reached Freedom Station. They will be sending reinforcements once they gather them." Gnog says, "We probably have a day and a half, at most?" "Well they don't make it in a day and a half, but they'll be here. They'll have the skies covered. I'm more worried about what's happening on the ground." She looks to Jace. "I don't know that it's the right decision..." "It's your call. It's not my network, it's yours." "...Hmm. Let me explain..." and she describes the Eberron version of the Catacalysm and how it changed everything there.

* She created a network called The Fixers.
* The Cataclysm created an uneasy truce between warring factions in Eberron; nobody knows who "caused" the cataclysm, each suspecting the other did it, so nobody dares attack anyone else.
* She can send a call out through the network to pull together dozens of planes walkers to come to the defence of Ravnica; the most powerful beings from multiple worlds to face off against Boros.

Gnog asks two question - "One, will Bolas perhaps want and expect that, perhaps this being part of this plan? And two, if not, what kind of damage is that going to do to the weave here?" - on the second question, Vi thinks that they'll be able to largely draw from their own planes; no danger of shattering leylines. Thinking about it, we repeat Niv's postulate; why Ravnica? Perhaps something as petty as - Ravnica is the world Azor built. Ooooh, but *that* is compelling. Bolas and Azor have been rivals for tens of millennia. He's strong enough now; Azor gave up his spark to craft the Immortal Sun; Bolas then obliterates Azor's proudest moment. "OK", says Gnog, "That sounds like it. That's the reason. And now, strangely, I feel like I've personal investment in this. For the first time. A personal reason to fuck over Bolas. Someone who just wants to destroy something someone else is proud of. *That* I hate. That really gets to me, always has. So that's motivated me a little more. So, what the hell do we do? Where's the Immortal Sun; is it useful to us? We shouldn't activate it here anyway; how would we find it?" "If anyone could find it - I bet the Dimir could... But if you need the support of the Fixers, you can't activate it." Gnog says, "No, I wouldn't activate it on Ravnica anyway; it'd *keep Bolas here*, along with everyone else. I just don't want anyone *else* to have it."

Vi mentioned she wasn't sure about bringing them here. Why? What's the downside? The sheer amount of power that they wield - in battle - it is very destructive. Fee-Ree points out that if Bolas attacks, destruction is *guaranteed*. Vi isn't sure. Taz persuasion with BFS, 18; Fee-Ree bends luck; D4->2, gets us to 20. That's enough. Vi is convinced.

* We'll try to take the fight to the Red Wastes
* We want to speak to Vraska - we need to evacuate non-combatants from the upper levels down as deep as they can go... "We must evacuate the surface of all of Ravnica"
* Same for the Simic - Prime Speaker Zegana - evacuate her people from shallow water
* Get to the Dimir - FIND THE IMMORTAL SUN

"OK, here goes nothing!" says Vi and activates her beacon. We just have to hope that this isn't what Bolas wanted us to do.

We finish the tea and thank Vi; she can always message us if she needs to; we will be on the move; we don't know where we will physically be found. We ask Kaya to redouble her efforts to find Tesseret; but Gnog knows and thinks out loud hoping she can hear it that he's on board with her Obizdat plan... If she insists. He'd rather go for Tesseret after all, but the time subtlety is past.

We have very, very little time. We have to push and push hard. First thing; Dimir. They need to get on the hunt. We have to race to the library, it's close. We walk-run there. It's around midday. We go in and talk to the librarian; we have a card or something... Some complex procedure, leaving messages... Deni digs around in a bag and figures it out. The messages stress **most paramount urgency** of time! We book a room and go there, at least just to discuss how on Toril we can get to see Vraska. As we do this, Gnog sees that Deni is getting into that heightened state that she gets to when things are bad. The trauma thing. So he pauses for a moment.

* "Hey Deni, we're together. We have a ship. We can always fly. We are ALL here to support you, every single step of the way. Every battle we have your back." "Yes, but we won the last time - we won and we lost someone. I can't afford... I just don't think..." Gnog just hugs her and then says, "We didn't lose him. He left. He had to go." "Why is it always US? Why does it have to be us? Why do we have to do this?" and Gnog says, "For a friend. We choose it. We do this for Fee-Ree, for all she's done for us. You and I, we owe her. Everything else is a sideshow. This is the long path to finding Arxcis. It's messy, and it's frightening and in the end, I think, somehow we'll muddle through like we always do. Remember. We're not doing this for us, we're doing it for her - because we don't want to lose someone times time. We want to *find* someone."

There's knock on the door. Gnog takes a deep breath and opens it. The librarian is present. She hands us a book; Gnog passes it to Deni. She shakes it! A bit of paper falls out. "Ugh. Fine. Shelf number..." - so, we do the dance...

While this happens, Gnog thinks for a moment and has Taz message Boboremos. "**King. Please prepare the Gruul for war.**" a response; "**We are more alike than you think. I tried politics. It failed. The tribes are in war paint. The Gruul are ready.**"

...and move from shelf to shelf. Deni eventually reaches the important end-of-the-trail book. It's odd. There's an address. "Let's go!" says Gnog. "Do we get a refund for the room?!" asks Deni. "No!" says Gnog and heads off - "quick, we're running out of time." At least it's in P5, not far - the Blistercoils.

We look around, and eventually find it on the ground floor which has a book store above. It's almost a basement, kind of half above and half below the street. It's a club! It's not open. Gnog tries knocking, first. Blinds are shifted. A face peers at us and the door is unlocked; it opens; inside is a small Vedalken. "Come in! Come in!" - we scuttle inside. The door is hastily shut; more looking through blinds. Deni assures them nobody followed us!

The Vedalken turns and we follow her towards the back of the club; she opens a trapdoor and walks down into a cellar. We follow. She's cast Dancing Lights so we can see. We're taken past large barrels full of various alcoholic drinks; walks up to the last one; then tests Gnog's arm! "Please push this out of the way, that way!" she points. He rages for advantage, even so only nat 3,7+10. It's enough. Under the barrel is another trapdoor; we descend. Taz casts Dancing Lights; she's not coming with us.

There's a lower alcove room of some kind, opening into a larger room that has an earth-floored passageway with small lights off to one side but it's dim light. Taz leads the way with Dancing Lights still up. A flight of stone steps take us down; eventually the passage opens out onto a stone landing. Steps from here hug the side of a sheer cliff, in a space that's sort of cube shaped; they go down 20ft or so; there are a few archways at the bottom. We carefully descend the slightly scary cliffside steps. It turns out the three archways all go the same way, so go through the middle one. Colonnades really. This is a very old part of the city, lit by clusters of lights, floating, like dancing lights - like motes - almost like clusters of fireflies, creating a clumped lace-like pattern along the ceiling.

It's remarkably well maintained here. Houses look well kept, even though they've been built atop; columns to support a roof, excavations to dig them out. We're greeted by a beautiful Devkarin elf. Taz history 25. He recognises the elf; he's seen this elf in the Golgari swarm meeting - someone quite high ranking. Taz says, "Ah, you were at the swarm meeting." "Yes, that's right. I remember you - well done for remembering me! Come. You asked to speak to the Dimir and you've definitely captured our interest." Gnog answers, "Thank you. Time is short. Let's go."

She refers to this place as **Nightvale**. We see shadows moving around in alleyways; not shadows of people, but shadows. She turns to us and says, "...this is our own part of the city. Those of us who come back to a community come here when we drop our guises, so to speak." - she sheds part of what appears to be a magical disguise; she's not an elf at all - she's human. "We are assigned different roles. Mine is to keep an eye on the turmoil in the Golgari." she turns to Deni; "I see that you've met someone very powerful and important in the Dimir; I'm going to bring you to see him. When you requested a meeting, it was quite irregular but he - they - intervened and said to organise for you to come down immediately and for you meet them personally."

We are led along the streets of Nightvale. Some people are here, not just shadows. The elite of the Dimir, perhaps? It's a very different side of this guild; we've never seen so many in one place. A certain level of elite congregate here - residences are kept; grouped together. We hear that most of the time they're out on missions. This is one of the few places they can go to get a sense of community and be themselves. We reach a beautiful gothic-style mansion with buttresses; "**Welcome to Duskmantle**".

As we walk in, gargoyles turn to watch us. Winged creatures up on the roof crawl along to keep us in view; leopards with wings, almost; in the darkness, pairs of yellow eyes blink at us. "Don't mind them!" she says. It's got the "homely manor" vibe. Not ostentatious. No huge art, for example. A servant now comes to us - "**Lavaz** is waiting for you upstairs. Follow me" and we go up into a warm, inviting drawing room of sorts, complete with fire in fireplace. There, in a black and dark purple short cape, sits a figure; he stands and we see that the cape has a kind of priest's collar. Looks male, but thin; dusky, purple-coloured skin. Could be human but for skin colour. He walks to us. "Thank you for coming to our home. This also serves as a Guildhall, I guess, if the Dimir have anything resembling one; we never seem to have reason to congregate in any significant numbers, so I get to use it as a residence. Lord Szadek used to keep his crypt here in the lower levels." (We'd read that he was a vampire).

"I am Lavaz. I am the current Guildmaster of the Dimir. A pleasure to see you again" - he smiles and shifts momentarily into the young woman that Gnog had spoken to at the art show; then again into the quiet representative that had been at the guild summit. Then again, to something *similar* to how he looked before but a bit different.

Gnog says, "Ah. Good. You know what happened. Ravnica stands on the bring of destruction. A powerful object has been lost. We need to find it, not to use it, but to make sure nobody else does." "Which object is this?" "The Immortal Sun, created by Azor on Amonkeht." "Well, it's apparently about a 5ft diameter solid ball of obsidian which floats all by itself! Kind of distinctive!" "Interesting... Still, could be easily hidden. Does it emanate any specific magic that might allow me to trace it?" Taz History 18; he recounts verbatim the conversation we'd had with Niv about the object. Lavaz listens carefully. "I think... I think that's enough to go on... Any rough idea where you think it might be? Are you sure it's on this planet?"

Gnog thinks then says, "Hmm, no, but it stands to reason that it would be; and it stands to reason that it was taken by the people who intend to invade; and in that case, District 10 is a strong possibility."

"I must admit, I too am interested in finding this object. But if I may ask a favour in kind?"

"Yes. I know there is always a price."

He looks to the woman who brought us here. "Ilya. Please ensure we are alone." - she steps back and pulls threads of shadow around her; eyes roll back briefly; she's pulling out shadow spirits - shades - that float out, passing through walls, to scan the perimeter. Eventually - "We are alone", she says.

Lavaz continues. "I have - *we* have - a problem that I need your help with. Like what you are asking of me, I believe you too have a vested interest in what I'm about to ask. Bolas's forces have infiltrated the Dimir I believe. I sense rogue elements, inconsistencies in the network. Mistakes are made, which set my mind at unease. Warning signs. Signs of interference. I think Tesseret has infiltrated the organisation or at least part of it. He has not thus far penetrated the inner circle, but he most certainly is aware of Nightvale. I would like you help me root out the withered branch of the Dimir, such that I can cut it away and stop the rot from spreading. I have a mission for you. One which will require quite some subterfuge to pull off."

Gnog says, "Time is very, very short."

"Yes. We will do this concurrently. For if the Dimir are infiltrated, that spells danger for everyone." He hands us a piece of paper with a named contact within the Dimir whom he suspects is an agent of Tesseret. He gives us a scenario; we have to engage with the Dimir because we have uncovered the location of some of the red crystals. They will provide us with them. They are to be planted in a warehouse; we then approach the Dimir contact; reveal the location and hopefully set in motion passing of information that doesn't come to us, but instead goes to Tesseret."

Gnog asks, "Will there be danger for anyone in the warehouse where the crystals are placed?"

"That depends on you."

"We have little choice. We agree."

Ilya is asked to organise the crystals. "I trust that you can find crates of your own?" "We'll figure something out" says Gnog. We are handed five crystals in small containing fields. Gnog says, "You realise of course that these five could've helped greatly to bolster the defence beam constructed at Nivix?" "Yes. But without these there's no way to stop Tessert from taking over the Dimir." Gnog says "Ah. Yes. I see your point!".

We learn that Tesseret seems to be *collecting* the crystals into crates. Not building something, but packing equipment and crystals; moving them around to prevent detection. Sending them somewhere? Not intending to install or build within the city?

So - 5 red crystals, in the bag of holding. We return to the surface. As we walk out, we cross paths with a human male that sends chills down the spine. We realise that they made no sound; they emanated no heat; they did not breathe. Taz nature 14; this is not a natural or living creature. Some form of high functioning undead.

We follow.

Stealth: 12 for Gnog, 13 for Taz; suddenly low rolls. We're unfamiliar with the place; the creature loses us. We give up and return to the surface; no time for this! We get back to the cellar, close the trapdoor, push back the barrel (athl. 16) and head out

It's late - past 7pm, going on 8 - but still, "Nivix, right now" says Gnog and we hurry that way. We head up to Ral's lab. We tell Ral that Tesseret is perhaps planning on sending things away, not using them here. Ral is dismayed; if that's true, the Disruptor won't work; it works by stopping a transmission *from* Ravnica establishing a connection out to elsewhere. That assumes, of course, that Tesseret's device is indeed supposed to start the bridge on this side rather than being something else entirely.

Ral's worried; more feelings of hopelessness; if Nicol has been planning this for - decades...? But we say yeah, sure, but we have Jace and other wildcards. Ral also hands us a letter he found at the front desk of the Chamber hotel, as he'd had to go back to find something. it's a formal letter from New Prahv. "Regarding enquiry 416114; we have located the person that you are looking for." - it gives an address. The address is P4, close by.

We can't remember who this is (ridiculously low History rolls all round - the dice gods speak!). We head there immediately. Other side of Sunhome, under-Transguild-Promenade building. We head to the apartment in question. Tiny apartments; not too different from our old place. We knock. Gnog and Taz side by side, Gnog knocking, Fee-Ree and Deni behind. The door opens - someone wearing a cowl (hood) and a cloak answers. "Yes?" says a male voice. **"What is it? Who..." - there's a pause - "...no! It can't be!" - the hood is pushed back;** - Gnog hears Fee-Ree breathe in sharply, things are almost in slow motion - and Gnog can scarcely believe his eyes, from the pictures he's seen...

***It's Arxcis.***

Gnog, dex save (!) 6 as Fee-Ree pushes in front of everyone, easily moving Gnog aside. They grab each other's shoulders; Fee-Ree pushes the hood back further; they touch each other's faces; they make half-sentence exclamations. "What are - how are you - ..." etc.

"How can this be?!" says Arxcis. "I've been looking for you! I - I thought you died!" "No I didn't - it was - how did you get here?! I'm so happy to see you! I don't understand..." - then from inside the house, someone yells, "Who is the visitor?" and Arxcis responds, "It's - you won't believe this - can I bring them in?" Two voices inside, now; a very old Viashino moves to the door; "Yes, come in. Come into our home."

We head in. Gnog's in a bit of a daze; his brain kinda crashed when Arxcis answered the door. It's an old Viashino couple inside, both female. They are clearing space on a threadbare couch. "**Mela**! Make some tea, we have guests!" - Mela heads off. Arxcis and Fee-Ree are just holding each other the whole time, looking at each other, full of questions. "Who are they? Whose house is this?" asks Fee-Ree. "This is **Grinne** and **Mela**. They found me; they rescued me and nursed me back to life, years ago. Grinne chips in - "Yes! Quite fascinating; you must be from another world; Fee-Ree, his wife?" "That's true, how did you know?!" Arxcis says, "Well I've told them of course!" Grinne says, "Yes, there were many stories of your world. Others would've have believed it but we always knew Arxcis was special."

Eventually Gnog recovers enough to say, "yes, yes we've been through - I mean - Fee-Ree and I met - well - I mean - it's a long..." then Fee-Ree chips in, "Oh I'm so rude! This is Gnog, this is Deni and this is Taz, they're my family". Arxcis steps back for a moment - "Oh, oh my I just assumed... Did you, wait... No she's too old..." and Gnog and Deni simultaneously go, "Oh! No! Nononono!"

Fee-Ree clarifies. "Oh! No, sorry, I meant friends, so close, they're family. But what about you?" "Me? Well.. No. There was briefly, but it was nothing serious; no, no... You see, I didn't know what had happened and I was trapped here" Fee-Ree answers "Well of course! It's OK; I'm glad you had a life..." "Yes - I work at a scribe's office - I copy manuscripts." "Ah! You always did love books." "But wait, how did you get here? Were you looking for me? How did you find this place?"

We explain - the short, still long version.

In turn, Mela describes finding Arxcis. The two of them are foragers - more scavengers perhaps! - "...seven years ago, there was this huge explosion from Nivix; arcs of lighting smashed through in a line from Nivix through into the Red Wastes, where we were. It destroyed part of our encampment. As we were clearing the rubble, we found the most bizarre things - molten rocks not from this world; bits of burned bodies that we didn't recognise; chunks of metal, with strange runes; and pinned beneath one of these metal chunks, was Arxcis. We brought the whole tribe down to help pull him out. He was very dazed, delirious; we thought he was crazy! We nursed him back to health, took him at least a week until he started making sense and asking questions. The tribe was going to eject him but we believed him - I mean it's a crazy story, but we believed him! - so we went into exile, all three of us, wandering the Red Wastes making a living for a few years before Grinne had an injury. We couldn't live that lifestyle anymore. We came to the edge of the Wastes, slowly made our way in and Arxcis has been very kind to work and rents this place. He's very kind to us." "It's the least I could do! You looked after me for years. It's my turn to look after you. I'm sorry... I just - I feel like my worlds have collided; I'm - so many mixed emotions! I don't know what happened! The last thing I remember..." and Fee-Ree turns her head in shame with tears, she interrupts - "I know, I know; I think you must remember me that way" - but he says, "No! No, the last thing I remember was seeing your face before I was pulled - I was *pulled* hundreds of miles in an instant, and all I could try and do was cling onto that picture of you" - he touches her chest - "you kept this; you're wearing it" (the amulet). "I've carried you with me every day."

(Arxcis had originally thought he was from another continent or something; didn't realise it was another planet; he didn't know about them either. It took a while to realise the sky was wrong and then it clicked.)

They talk about the house a bit; how the forest around was destroyed; she thought she'd blown a fireball. But Arxcis said he saw it swirling around, connected to her, but not actually her; he saw her eyes change colour, flaring with a bright yellow light for a brief instant." (We recognise this - so the spark happened *then*, or at least tried to light it, but it didn't work; couldn't control the wild magic back then).

They have so much to catch up on...

...but Arxcis asks where we've been living. Before answering, Gnog thanks Mela and Grinne and says he is *immeasurably* indebted to them. If they EVER need anything, call on him. But then we have to explain about the coming war. Arxcis says he asks because he wanted to take Fee-Ree for a few hours, to show her all the places he loves. She's conflicted. We *insist* she goes. They can find us at the library. He goes quickly and gets changed; comes back in quite smart clothes; he kneels before her, "Lady, my have the honour?" - Fee-Ree turns to us; just says "thank you..." - then they giggle and head out the door.

Mela and Grinne are holding hands. Gnog says, "mind if we stay and chat for a while?" "No please. I made a lot of tea!" "It's very good tea. And, I feel, I need a little while to settle my emotions. Seeing that is something I have waited a LONG time for." "So have we! We always believed that he would find her - well, she found him - heh, same thing!"

We ask about what they might do, if an evacuation order were given. Do Ravnicans tend to rail against such authority, insist on staying with their homes? Or would they head below? Mela and Grinne are afraid of the dangers below - of the Golgari - and say they're very old; their stories should've ended 3 years ago when injured, were it not for Arxcis; but we say we don't want to see their story end just yet either! So in the end, they gather belongings; they are ready to leave; Deni will find them if such a time comes.

We bid them farewell. Gnog has made it very clear how grateful he is. Even so it feels insufficient. They tell us to hurry if we want food - it is nearly 9pm; the markets will soon close. We do so, heading to our old haunt market, once again, meeting familiar faces and chatting as light-heartedly as we can, trying not to think too hard about what might happen tomorrow.

About half an hour in, Gnog just starts crying. It's happy crying, but he can't seem to stop. He's not sure what Deni and Taz think. A lot of emotions are flowing out; it's a strange thing; almost laughing, almost crying, mixed together. He can't quite believe it; they found Arxcis and Fee-Ree is literally on a night on the town right now. It's bizarre in the circumstances, but that just makes it even more wonderful and special. Butterflies in the stomach, a giddiness of the mind; happiness comes in waves, coupled with relief that just explode out of him in these strange physical ways. Goliaths are not built for emotional fortitude. He does eventually manage to try and explain this a bit to Deni and Taz; fortunately, the Precinct 4 regulars around have found it funny, thinking he drank too much!

Eventually, we walk slowly over towards the library. It's about 10:30pm. A soft rain starts to fall, almost like mist. It blurs the city lights into halos.

Gnog feels a bit guilty over the wasted time drinking, but what could we have done... It's the end after all, isn't it? Tomorrow, at about 11am, it'll be exactly four days since Jace's "future goes black" prediction. We haven't had a chance to speak to the Simic to get them down below; we haven't had a chance to speak to Vraska to get permission to evacuate the surface population; there's no time to do it anyway, anymore; we haven't even started on the mission given to us by the Dimir. Our only remaining hope was the disruptor, but if the bridge is built from another plane, it can't work. Niv has no power. The guilds refused to work together.

Gnog sighs. He looks to Deni and Taz, sombre, but centred. "We're out of time. We're out of options. Fee-Ree and Arxcis have this one beautiful evening together. At least they had *that*. And we got one more evening spent eating and drinking amongst people we like. At least we all got something from this. We've seen and done remarkable things... We all did our best... I don't think we could have done more, but..." He pauses, and draws a deep breath.

"**Some time tomorrow, the future goes black; it becomes truly unknown. Perhaps this world will end, taking all of us with it...**"

Gnog doesn't wait long to let that land; they know anyway; what good scaring them? "...but do you think there's time to do some good, still? I mean it's late at night and I don't think we have a chance to evacuate the surface now, but maybe the Simic could be warned? Zonot Seven is close to where we're going anyway. And we need to plant those crystals, too, *tonight*, as our last roll of the dice might be to get the Dimir on Tesseret's trail. I want to give up, and just let it go and accept it, but I won't. Not ever. Not until my last dying breath. If that happens, I'll say Eliastra's name before I fall, knowing that I fall in honor. But I won't just stop now, not after all we've done. There has to be a way. There *has to*."

Deni says that if we're going to achieve anything, we really need to focus on one thing. We can't do everything. Trying to save people on the surface is laudable, but useless if the whole planet falls. Nowhere to hide then!

Evacuation is perhaps a distant dream... While it would be great to try and talk to Vraska now, we can't; we have to deal with Dimir mission. Deni says that she's sure there's no time to contact the Simic either; we change direction and head to Precinct 6.

The question becomes: Where? Which warehouse should we choose? Medori Park for sure; and indeed, we know one warehouse there! We can't cast anti-scrying spells because Dovan's decree means we'd be arrested and we know there are observation devices. 

Taz makes Gnog invisible via his mandolin and Deni stealths to get access. Gnog adv stealth 19; Deni "high" - we get inside; Deni gives Gnog the goggles so he can plant the heavy crates. He places them in a similar location to where we saw crates before. He notices a soft glow to the crystals; something in here is exciting them. He sees a nearby tarp and covers the crystal crates, since he doubts Tesseret would be careless enough to leave glowing crystals around. He returns back to Deni by the door and returns the googles; adv stealth dirty 20 and Deni, of course, is very quiet. We make it out. We sneak over to where Taz is waiting. It took about 10 minutes due to creeping around and being careful. We exit the way we came in, to the smelting quarter, then check the contact address. Precinct 5! Stroke of luck. We head there directly.

There's an alleyway with a small gaming parlour. Taz casts Enhance Ability on himself; he'll do the talking while Deni handles Dimir codes from the notes we have. He gives Gnog and Deni some bardic inspiration. He takes the role of squire, Deni is the facilitator and Gnog is the bodyguard.

Deni gets deception 26 and Taz gets adv. deception 25. They lie effectively! It looks like the contact takes the bait (Gnog insight rolls are bad, he has no idea but Deni is fairly sure) and we high-tail out of there before we make any mistakes. It's late, 11:30pm; direct to the library.

D6 roll requested; 4. Gnog perception, high roll; 24. In the next block over, walking just in front of us through gardens towards the library are two familiar figures. Gnog smiles and shouts, "Behind you!" - it looks like Arxcis was bringing Fee-Ree back to the library. Good timing! Fee-Ree rather shyly suggests that they get another room, to have some private time. Yes, of course! They spend the night together.

Gnog has squee.

Taz has his own bed! He doesn't like beds - ceilings are boring - so he sits on it. Long rests all round; minimum time, hoping to wake at 7:30am. Deni runs Alarm just in case.



## Day 48 (Ravnica 28, Riglan 85 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Thursday (7 day week)

Today is the day that the future goes black, according to Jace.

At around 4am, Deni wakes up. Taz notices. Perception 15. He sees someone sneak into the room. He immediately wakes and raises the alarm. Deni is also awake. The person dashes out, so we give chase! Gnog, even with luck point, only 16 on athletics. This person is running along the corridors; they look small, wearing dark clothing, with a cap of some kind, no cloaks or robes. Taz turns a corner as we run, sees the person within range before darting around another corner and tries Hold Person (Wis 18 saving). It works! They're held. Gnog grapples them and asks Taz to drop the spell so we can talk. He asks, "We don't want to hurt you. Why were you in our room? Why did you run?"

They're looking at us strangely; Deni insight; she's walking slowly around the corner, having intentionally trailed behind and trying to read the situation. We sense we've made a mistake. Back to the room ASAP, carrying this guy. Deni is sighing. She pulls out her daggers. Her eyes are darting around the room, then she slits this person's throat.

"We have to get rid of the body!"

Gnog is frozen for a minute - he's never seen her do anything like that. "We have to cover this up. The Dimir plan will fail if this person reveals that we are not who they think we are..."

Gnog says, "Easy. Get some cultist robes, wrap him up to stop the bleeding, tie them on, dump him in the bag of holding? I'll do it?"

Gnog has the grim task of laying out robes, cutting the person up (!) to fit them in and the grisly task is done. Gnog has no idea what's going on. Deni explains; "We were being checked upon by the other faction of the Dimir, to make sure that the information was good. I think that's what this was. He didn't read our minds, but knows we're magic users and quite powerful from the capture - not what a low-level Dimir contact would be... I..." - she digs through their clothing - "...Taz, I need you to risk a spell on me - I need you to disguise me to look like this person so I can complete their mission!"

But that won't work - even the Mizzium Apparatus can't do more than Disguise Self, which won't work on anyone but Taz. She tries her best to disguise him; puts on everything they wore; tries to style herself as a mimic as best she can; Taz re-casts Enhance Ability for deception and has to hold concentration.

She heads off. We wait (nervously). Before she goes, she insists we hide the body - suggests Deadbride Chasm. Gnog has to risk heading to the back of Gore House and throw the parts over, hoping it looks like another Rakdos mistake. Taz stays in the room to concentrate on the spell.

After a nervous night, we eventually reconvene in the room. Deni thinks she might've got away with it. We are all tired; we didn't get a rest; it's 5:30am. We might have to try and sleep. We put a note on the door, "Fee-Ree: Difficult night, have to sleep in, but realise the planet might be under attack! Please wake us at 11:30am or earlier if circumstances require. Cordially, Gnog." 

We *attempt* to long-rest, since if tomorrow is invasion day, we need to. All plans for an early start and much work to be done have to be abandoned. As it transpires, at least, we are not woken early. At 11:30am on the dot, there's a knock on the door and Taz immediately wakes up and answers. Fee-Ree has coffee and ringbread! Not hot, since it's a long walk from P4, but we are all very appreciative.

We spend few minutes filling Fee-Ree in. She says Arxcis has gone to work - she walked him there and back. Then we say, "well, today is invasion day... Maybe... We don't really know... So, what happened last night? Did you have fun?!" and she says yes, but, well, if today is invasion day we should try to meet everyone. Jace is probably at the Chamber, but of course we don't really have any idea what the others are up to, except Nissa who is probably still at Selesnya. That's a long walk and it's likely to be busy with a lot of obstructions - we're pretty sure Jace will be busy at the Chamber, so we go straight for it.

We get to the edges of P3; it is perhaps unsurprisingly even busier than last time we were here. There's a change though; Gnog perception total 25; people here seem more entrenched. The boundaries that were temporary before around P3 are now more permanent - more watchtowers, fences and so-on are built. People outside seem settled here, as if staying for a while. They're not queueing to get in; they're just living their lives - as if an extension of P3. We approach a guard post; smaller queues this time; focused on flow of goods. We wait our turn; there's no security per se and we don't even need to show the investigation tokens. Instead, the usual questions, then in we go.

We make a beeline for Vitu-Ghazi; best bet for Nissa's location. Gnog, investigation 17+1->18. Someone matching Nissa's description is on the patrol grounds of the Grand Concourse, last seen speaking to animals and dealing with herds, working with shepherds. Using vantage points from Vitu-Ghazi we can easily see where the larger herds are; most of them are near a particular raised section towards the centre of the Concourse; we make our way over. It's busy, slow going, lots of people, a hive of activity. It's much more densely populated than we've seen before; it feels as if perhaps more remote, outer-lying communities have converged here for safety.

It's beyond frustrating that everything is taking so long but it's not surprising given the wider situation.

Finally, we see her - Nissa is within earshot - and Gnog calls her name. She turns but we see that she's busy; trying to calm people and animals; catches our eye; waves; but carries on doing what she's doing. Gnog pushes forward alongside; "Can we help?" "Yes! These animals. We need to... We must move them. There are too many in one place; they're too easily spooked. Over there - off the concourse, onto grass." She's dealing with one thing at a time; distraction. Pulling her weight here, so she feels useful.

We do what we can to help get the animals down to the grass area. Over the time spent, Gnog makes friends with one of the deer. Gnog, insight 17; Nissa is friendly but doesn't really know why we're here. Her concerns aren't really aligned with ours. Taz says, "Nissa, this work is important. But it means little if Bolas is successful. We came here because we need to regroup and form a plan of action."

"Yes... Yes of course; what is the call to action? Who..." - nobody is leading; nobody is giving orders. Gnog says, "Nobody in charge, so we have to take the reins a bit ourselves. I was thinking the four of us could try to group with Jace and then from there, Ral and maybe Niv, see what they have; what to they see for the future in which we now find ourselves?" "Would you like me to come with you?" "Yes please".

Nissa explains that Ajani is off in the Red Wastes. We head across to the Chamber to see if we can pick up Jace. It's very busy; Jace is embroiled in the usual business. He sees us, looks very surprised to see us all there; then looks concerned; he calls Levisha; some kind of argument breaks out as he walks away from a dispute he was resolving.

"What's going on?" he asks. Gnog is confused... He doesn't understand why people are acting kind of if yesterday didn't happen, so he sort of says as much. Jace tasks us aside into a quieter room. Jace says he still has to try and hold the guilds together; things are fracturing at an alarming rate thanks to what happened yesterday. Age-old feuds are erupting, with Jace's power being needed to suppress it. Unprecedented times. In particular the Azorius and Orzhov are off the rails and Jace's attention is fully taken with that. Jace can't see past today; he can't see what might happen; there's no pre-empting or preparing. We could get the Azorius or Boros to order a civic or martial evacuation, but the population can speak for themselves too; but he's not sure how we'd get the word out.

Nissa has been doing something similar. Animal stampedes on a grand scale could not be contained by the walls of P3; they must be contained. Ajani is trying to head off a march of the old druids that are heading for D10. Kaya is at the Orzhova, probably, trying to kill the Ozbidat! She's trying to remove them as a threat, in her mind. That's perhaps the shakiest of all the plans in Gnog's view, but he can't be sure. He has to go on faith. He has no choice.

Thinking about Kaya, then; Vraska in her mind *is* responsible for Isperia's murder, via a power deal with the Orzhov. Gnog is not convinced. So, he has to risk it.

Taz, Sending, Vraska: **"Must evacuate surface population urgently. We do not believe you killed Isperia. Will Golgari accept surface refugees? You could never be overlooked again?"** 

A reply comes quickly. Hard to determine tone using this kind of messaging method. "What madness are you suggesting? To swarm our lands with everyone in the city? Care to explain yourself?"

A reasonable question! Gnog treats this as an invitation; we need to go down below. Nissa offers to come with us. Gnog explains that we probably called her away in error, but we're just guessing at this point. Nissa tries to comfort Gnog; "a loss of faith and direction, that fills you with dread; actions which fail to replace what's missing, a void in mind and heart, carved out by fear. I've seen this in Gideon, I've seen this in Liliana. The best cure is companionship and solidarity. So we shall together."

Gnog just nods in response, and we start to head towards a route down. On the way, we explain that Arxcis has been found - she's happy - but she recognises the difficult timing. It raises the stakes! She looks to Fee-Ree. "I do not envy your position madam; for I fear you may need some time soon to make some difficult decisions where you either have to follow your heart or your head. Things always get complicated when loved ones are involved."

So we carry on and at one point Gnog stops acting as if he needs to adjust his boots or something and asks Fee-Ree to help, waving the others to carry on - we'll catch up. Gnog once there's privacy says to Fee-Ree, "I need you to promise me something." She's silent. "If it comes to it. If it's me versus Arxcis for some reason. Who do you save, something like that. Nissa's hinting. It could happen... I'm just a person you met. You've barely known me more than a year. I need you to promise you'll pick Arxcis." "I picked up on that too, but I don't think that's what she meant. I think she meant one of those choices where I can pick only one - I either save Arxcis from dying or I stop Bolas. I don't think it's a matter of picking between people I save." As we're talking, Nissa has turned around and come back - "Look... it's not my place, I'm sorry, I should never have said that; I know it's hurtful and raises doubt and I'm sorry." Fee-Ree says "It's fine, you speak the truth; there was more besides, but you stopped yourself, we all saw that." "Yes... For we have seen the extent of our foe. You see, it seems somewhat convenient to compromise you in this way. I only hope that this not the hand of Bolas at work. I'm not saying anything about your husband! Please do not misunderstand. I merely hope that the situation is not the result of manipulation and machinations designed to weaken you. Designed to force a difficult decision upon you." Gnog says "Well, my statement does still stand. It might come to the choice you describe Fee-Ree, though we all hope not, but perhaps that only arises if you've saved friends along the way - reached a position where you didn't have to let go of someone else and got backed into a corner. We all care for each other, but if I ever felt that my living was connected to his passing? After meeting him, after seeing you two together? I couldn't live with that."

We reach Deadbridge Chasm. Nissa creates a spiralling staircase of vines, which makes descent easy. As we walk she says:

"Let me tell you of Gideon and Liliana. Two dear friends of mine. We had known each other for a few years. We travelled together. They are... You remind me of us. Chandra, Liliana, Gideon and myself and then Ajani who we picked up a little later. Gideon and Liliana are about as different as you can imagine. She is a necromancer, very powerful, possessing a great artefact, the only thing that counters the demonic pacts that she entered into for power. Not my usual choice of company! But she really grew on me. See, Gideon fell for her and her charms. She allowed herself to be vulnerable with him in a way that she never was with anyone else. We journeyed to Amonkhet. That is how I knew how to reach it in the Dream."

She looks to Taz. "Ajani had never been, but I had. My last memories of that place are painful. We encountered Bolas there, even had a chance to take him down - to topple his religion - but love got in the way. Liliana had fallen under his sway; his control; she did things that I'm sure is not proud of. Gideon was in a position to materially change that, as her betrayal was uncovered, her defection, but he would not slay her. His love would not allow him to. He could not see what she had done, only what she meant to him. He would not fight her. Even though she fought in the name of Bolas, under his control, he would not fight. So he left, crippled by the decision. That is the decision I pray, hope and wish does not befall you. A cruel, cruel fate."

She has to steel herself against the rising emotions for a moment. "We must not let that happen again. But believe me, I will do *everything* in my power to protect your love one. But if it comes to a decision between protecting him or stopping Bolas, I have to stop Bolas. I have to! I can't let him do to this world what he's done to Amonkhet or any other world." Taz says, "I've seen Amonkhet. I said before. We must stop him. I am not powerful. I am unlikely to be the key to taking him down. And that means I can protect. If you have to step aside, I can stand forward. I told you Fee-Ree - I can hope for the both of us."

Nissa turns to Fee-Ree with a pained look. "I hope I haven't ruined things..." but Gnog cuts in and says he knows, it's all true. It's a huge weakness. We never thought about it. We couldn't hold a sword to each other. Nissa's greatest fear is that she has to go through it again.

Gnog says, "So, we face a foe of such evil." "Yes. His plots and schemes know no limits. Nothing is sacred to him, he's the embodiment of the profane." "Well, then, all we have to do is agree. However much we care for each other, we are small against the universe. The only way we can stop Bolas using us this way is to agree. If it comes to it, none of us will hesitate because we know, now that this is what other would want. If I was being used in leverage, if Fee-Ree were to have to kill me and hesitated, and Bolas won, neither she nor I would be happy. If we have to sacrifice a loved one in this endeavour, if there's truly no other choice, then this is the gods decree. And we shall see the in the afterlife. And that will have to be enough. The universe is bigger than us four. Five, with Arxcis."

### Inspiration for all (this was Nissa's secret; her greatest fear)

In the end, it's not so much about power. The Gatewatch was powerful then. It's powerful now. But Bolas disabled them by manipulation; he used weaknesses. Nissa's Gatewatch is scarred, beaten; spiritually defeated in many ways.

The Goliath in Gnog rises. "Every fight you lose but survive is a lesson you learn."

We continue to descend the vine 'stairs', making rapid progress; we're soon at the bottom. We're in the mushroom forest, with the now-kind-of-familiar ruined buildings. We realise we don't know where Vraska is; the castle is Savra's, not hers. 

Perhaps the Kraul can help. We go into a cave; soldiers approach. They look defensive, on the edge of aggressive. Taz says, "We are summed to see Vraska, but do not know where she is. Can you help us?" (Persuasion 11+13->24). They relax a little - "Yes... She is in an emergency swarm gathering." This is indeed been held at the palace. Apparently, Vraska herself has been summoned - to explain her actions, the soldiers say, but they know not why.

As Taz turns to leave, one soldier says "Little one. Do not be drawn into the politics and clashing of the titans. Us small folk always get crushed underfoot for their plans". Taz turns and replies, "Wise words. We hope to find aid from the Golgari, which would be visible to and benefit countless surface dwellers. The Golari - and the Kraul - could never be overlooked after that. But we do not know if Vraska will agree. I bear your words in mind."

It's not hard to navigate towards the castle. We come across another group with hungry, scavenging creatures... Gnog, strength-based intimidation: 19+10! 29. Fee-Ree intimidates too. The scavengers back off; we're not easy prey. **It may not be so safe as we thought to bring people below - at least not this deep**.

We make to the castle and proceed directly to the meeting area. A lot people are already gathered outside; we make our way through the crowd. Loud, angry debating sounds grow clearer as we get closer. At first we choose to just sneak in and observe. **Jared is awake.** Savra is at her side, looking spiteful, or scornful, directing the look at Vraska, standing across the room from them. The two of them are on their raised platform, lording over Vraska or at least attempting to - but Vraska's stance is menacing, intimidating; she is not cowed. A few stone sisters back her, with some kraul and priests too.

"Is this what we have become now? Judgement without trial, without evidence?" asks Vraska. Jared says, slowly and calmly, "We are merely asking questions. You have the opportunity to answer them." Savra venomously throws in, "We ALL know what you did! You bring upon the Golgari the wrath of the surface world! You claim to represent us, a new way. We don't need a new way! The new way will destroy us!" - she is about to continue but Jared puts his hand on her to calm her down. He says, "There is a reason why we have ruled for so long. We know - and we have honed and perfected - the way of the swarm. You have returned from elsewhere, off-world; you bring back with you ideas which can be beneficial to the kingdom! But caution and wisdom must prevail."

Vraska laughs. "You! You Vod Savo's are all the same. You still refer to this as a Kingdom! We are not your subjects and you are not our king. This is voted! We choose who leads us!"

Jared says, "And do you believe that you've been chosen? Is that what you believe?"

"Yes! They have spoken. I have backing. I get to choose on behalf of the Golgari."

Jared laughs. "But it was an illigitimate vote; there were circumstances under which a vote should have been held. Yes, I was asleep. And we needed a representative. You are a *representative*, not a guild leader!"

At this we push down and in, standing in the middle lower section, not far from Vraska. Savra looks surprised. She whispers, "The outsiders", explaining something to him.

Jared says, "We have visitors... Guests? In our court."

Gnog speaks, but it doesn't have much impact. Vraska and Jared are at odds. Inevitably things rise in temper, and unrest grows. The guards step forward to make a cordon. The Captain of the guard insists on order, else people must leave; they form a perimeter around the stairs; snake hair rises up...

Vraska says, "Don't you dare threaten us! Stop this foolishness at once! We should not be here, killing each other. Injuring each other. This is not how we advance!"

Taz glows brightly and amplifies a shout - "STOP THIS! You are being played by Nicol Bolas and made to look like fools."

Vraska steps back, sighing. She looks to Taz as if to acknowledge him. Looking up at Jared, "So, what will it be? Are you charging me? Or not?" she asks. Jared answers, "I haven't decided yet..." and Vraska turns, "...well then, there is nothing more to discuss..." and walks out; we follow. We might have accidentally aligned ourselves with her in Jared and Savra's mind, but we just need to talk to her.

We get alongside. We chat. Vraska says she blacked out - after going to her room, she remembers nothing except waking up in Isperia's chambers, nobody else there, Isperia petrified and fractured, and her snake hair 'awake'. She misty-stepped out. We mention that Dovan had been in the room and she realises that Dovan MUST surely have seen this coming - head of the precogs! - and we say yeah, we think he dunnit!

It's a long way to the palace steps but there, we are stopped by guards. They want us to come with them - not under arrest, of course! - and we bid farewell. Vraska is perhaps now an ally if not a friend (she had one once, she says; but can't remember who!)

We're brought before Savra, in gardens off to the side of the palace.

"Hmm. I was surprised to see you come back. My brother does not know you. But he thinks you may be allies with the Sisters. I told him that was not the case. I trust my judgement in your character has not been in error! I have a proposal for you."

She walks towards an old pavilion. Inside, on a dais is a cloth. On this is a chest. It's filled with gems. She says, "We're willing to pay for the stability of the kingdom. With discretion, we would like a message to be sent to Vraska... To abandon her ambitions. She has two sisters, who she looks after; who are close to her. We would like them... Removed. Permanently. That should send a strong signal to Vraska that you don't rock the boat. In return, we will open the tunnels of the old city for your... Refugees, I believe, would be the term? We would, my brother and I, be willing to embrace an era of change. They would not be allowed in the Golgari lands but we will prepare the old city for them. I trust this is - what do you call it on the surface? - a win, win situation?"

She closes the chest. "Consider our offer. Do not take too long. Please let me know within the hour what your decision is." She looks to the guards; they escort us away, back to the palace steps.

We debate it briefly - not considering doing it, obviously! - more the apparent misjudgement of our character. Nissa was briefly horrified thinking we might be considering it.

We *run* to try and catch up with Vraska. She's at the "pools of rebirth", a wet area that's actually roughly underneath Midori Park. Much more moss here, particularly dense mushrooms, lush black ferns; water dripping and running everywhere. A few medusas here. Vraska is there, her strange trappings of council discarded now, instead in a black/green gauze-y kind of neglige. Gnog calls out her name. After a brief conversation - she's already guessed that we had been asked to kill - first her, then guesses her sisters. They are unfazed; it's how the Vod Savo's work. So Jared and Savra reacted almost with fear, for all their power; yet her is Vraska and her sisters, only two dozen or so medusae left, reacting calmly.

She says she'll speak to the Kraul, for it is *they* who can open and protect people taking refuge in the low city; they *live* there. The Vod Savo's cannot offer Kraul land in exchange for a favour! In return, we offer a favour.

She says, "Something devious... I believe someone's placed a mind block on me. Only the most powerful of the Dimir mind mages are able to lift or break those locks. I want to know what it is I don't remember. I want them to extract the missing time... It's devious because I can't just ask the Dimir to do this; we have to convince them that I have memories that are locked away that are valuable to **them**. And then we have to set it up so they capture me, extract the memories and **then** you'll have to attack them to free me and steal those memories. Unless you've a way of convincing them to do this for us... Which sounds nearly impossible."

She does mention that she never dealt with the Orzhov. Nobody deals with them and comes out on top. "Only the truly desperate would enter agreements with them! Their catacombs are filled with the prophets of such uneven barters."

In due course we finish the conversation and need to exit quickly, before our hour is up. Nissa can fast-ish-travel with vines; Gnog carries Taz and Taz uses the mandolin to fly Gnog; Fee-Ree flies herself and Deni; we fly out, like last time, albeit with slightly different spell balance. Once safely just beyond, near Kamen Fortress, Nissa asks - what next? After some debate:

* Does Ajani need help?
* How's Kaya getting on?
* Speak to Niv?

...we decide on Dimir first, in the end. Nissa comes with. It's actually later than we expected, time has flown; the late start threw us off. The sun has set behind buildings now. Maybe 6pm, 7pm? We're behind the Smelting Quarter - not at the Blistercoils yet.

Gnog perception 19. Deni grabs his hand; she stiffens up; the mouse on her shoulder runs up her sleeve; she pulls out her bow. Crawling out from the sewers are tendrils! Wights coalesce; fog comes together; stepping out is Savra. "Something tells me you've made up your mind. Last chance to change it."

Gnog - "You and Jared both misjudged us. We cannot do what you ask."

Savra - "No. No, we did not misjudge you; you are as weak as we thought you were!"

She steps back. An aura of death and decay starts to spread out from her. She casts Circle Of Death outwards! Nissa gasps in pain... Con saves:

* Taz: 8 fails
* Gnog: 13 fails
* Fee-Ree: 18 (save)
* Deni: 17 (save, just)
* Nissa: fails

32 necrotic damage for those who failed, else half. That's a hell of a dent for Taz, not so bad for Gnog. Taz says, "We are authorised to use lethal force in self defence!" - he looks rough; cracks and mould on the transparent panelling; flickering lights; rust; anodisation falling away. Initiative!

* Gnog: 21
* Nissa: 21
* Deni: 20
* Fee-Fee: 6
* Taz: 6 (rolled nat 1)

Despite Gnog normally moving a bit quicker, Nissa gets the jump this first time, perhaps having seen Deni's reaction quicker than he did. She looks up. One of the moons is clearly visible; she calls a Moonbeam down into the space that Savra occupies. The space around Nissa shimmers for a moment; she summons a spirit bear! We all get 22 temp HP (wait, what? Now high level is Nissa?!). This helps Taz a great deal - "Thank you!" he shouts.

Gnog shouts, "It's very tedious but I think *non*-lethal force for Savra please..." and rages. He jump-flies as far as he can skirting the edges of the moonbeam & unable to reach Savra due to it; recklessly attacks a nearby shaman instead (since he's surrounded here anyway). 19 hits, only 15 damage. Second hit is better, 24 damage.

A wight comes up and attacks Gnog. It's a fucked up rotting fungal affair. A longsword slashes out; glances off. Then it tries a grasp of some kind. Gnog *just* squirms free (AC21 vs 20). It scrapes Gnog's clothes of mending - he wasn't in Gruul today! - rot briefly, before starting to knit themselves back together.

Deni tries to get insight on Savra. It works. She draws the bow and fires; she uses a +1 arrow for this one. It hits easily. 50 total damage to Savra. She moves forward a little, alongside Taz. Savra responds; she sends out a deathly, chilled tendril of fog (chill touch, legendary action) on Deni - but Deni dodges it (quite easily).

A Drow warrior - actually a royal guard - is near Gnog, but since it's next to Savra, it's in the moonbeam. The con save DC for Nissa's spell is 21! It fails, taking 5d10 -> 31 radian damage. Wowsers. It moves in front of Gnog to get out of the way and attacks Gnog. The first misses (a 1 and 2!) and the second too (a 2 and a 5, woah).

A wight makes a break for it and dashes up in between Nissa and Deni, melee range of both.

Gnog perception 23. **He sees someone running towards and behind Fee-Ree, in shadow,** reaching out with a shortsword; it stabs... In horror, Gnog shouts a warning (but there isn't time for anyone to act). Taz is behind Deni and can't see any of this. Some kind of assassin. It hits with 25, beyond shield or the spectral wings, so she takes full assassination critical damage - 10d6+3 -> 41 damage, very high roll, and there would be 14d6 poison damage - but by remarkable fortune, she is wearing the periapt of poison that Gnog gave to her after we found it just the other day after the Decadance battle. "Where did you get that?!" exclaims the assassin.

Gnog sees this. He sees the periapt glow. *Immense* relief at our good fortune and the decision to give that to Fee-Ree.

The shaman that Gnog attacked is inside moonbeam too and takes a full 31 damage. The shaman looks around, then casts Dispel Magic on the moonbeam - it succeeds and Nissa's spell fades.

Another wight attacks Gnog - one that he'd jumped next to, flanking him with the shaman. Its second attack hits, with a life drain attack; 5->2 necrotic; con save 18; no HP max reduction.

The second Drow guard looks over, sees Gnog pretty much surrounded so instead runs towards Taz and Deni. It fires a crossbow, rapid fire, one at each. It misses Teni but crits on Taz; nothing he can do to stop it. 11 piercing, but he's immune to poison.

Another wight attacks Gnog; both attacks miss. Two other wights closer to the party act; one would hit; Taz deploys the spectral wings; the blow is deflected. The hand touch misses too. Another wight that was nearby in response attacks Taz. Fortunately, both of its attacks miss. At this point, Savra looks at Gnog and sprays poisonous spores right at Gnog's face. Gnog con save - 19+11 -> 30! The spores have no effect.

Now it's actually Savra's turn. We see the arrow damage from earlier start to heal; Gnog shouts out a warning to that effect for the rest of the party. She moves forward, next to the guard that fired the crossbow; she points her finger at Nissa and says, "Your pitiful light of the moon is no match for unending death!" - and throws Finger Of Death. Thankfully, she rolls a nat 19->22 on con save and succeeds. She takes half damage - 7d8+30 -> 60 -> 30 damage. Nissa isn't looking great at all. "You've definitely made the wrong choice!" spits Savra.

Fee-Ree retorts, "Well at least we're *making* a choice!"; her eyes light up; that 'spark' again; flames jet out; she casts Immolation on the assassin, but *twins* it to set Savra ablaze too. Five sorcery points blown. Gnog mutters, "huh, she must be fairly angry, we haven't seen that in a while..." - no wild magic surge; DC18 dex saves needed - Savra fails; assassin - succeeds. 8d6 damage -> 34, so the assassin takes 17. Savra takes 34 and would be ablaze, but she wills herself to succeed her save (legendary resistance) so only 17 and not aflame. We see that the fire damage seems to have wilted her healing spores. Gnog shouts, "Oh look! She's like a troll! Get fire on her!"

Fee-Ree isn't done; she uses two more sorcery points to speed up a casting of Shocking Grasp on the assassin; with Tides of Chaos it hits, 3d8->20. Since the assassin is now a little stunned, Fee-Ree is able to retreat to a safe distance without opportunity attacks.

Taz has two wights in front of him; he risks opportunity attacks from both wights and steps back. One would hit, but now Deni uses *her* reaction and sends out the wings to defend him. He's fine. Eldritch blasts are thrown - two at a nearby wight and a third at one who recently attacked him. Both first two hit, but low damage; 7, 8. The third hits as well with lowest possible damage roll of 6.

Taz casts L5 Mass Cure Wounds - 17 healed for himself, Deni, Nissa and Fee-Ree.

Gnog attacks the shamen recklessly; 17 damage; that takes it down. As it fails, it is looking around at wights; but they're all up and it can't siphon life from them. Gnog tries to remember that. Gnog has three wights on him and one drow warrior; he attacks the drow. Hits but a really low 14 damage.

Seeing the shaman go down, Savra screams out the name of the shaman; she looks to us, "ALL OF YOUR LIVES ARE FORFEIT!" and causes a burst around her, the air and ground trembling, as she tries to disrupt life force entirely for creatures around her. Only living creatures are affected. DC17 con save else 6d6 necrotic -> 18.

* Gnog makes it - 18->9->4
* Taz and Fee-Ree out of range
* Deni makes it -> 9
* Nissa fails -> 18

Nissa's turn. She's really getting sick (no pun intended) of the necrotic damage. She's *just* within 60ft of Gnog. Having seen Taz's mass-cure she herself casts Mass Cure Wounds at L5. Everyone heals for 18hp. Taz is up to full! Including temp HP, Gnog has... 199 hp. *So close to the 200!* She uses her bonus action to fey-step away from the assassin, deeper into the melee, on the other side of Savra and closer to Gnog.

A wight attacks Gnog; misses twice.

Deni disengages from nearby wights, moves to get a clear line of sight and attacks Savra using prior insight with another +1 arrow. She hits, for a total of 39 damage.

The Drow warrior crits against Gnog with its shortsword, total of 14->7 damage; 6d6 poison damage -> 23->11. Second attack misses. Another wight on Gnog has a go; misses twice.

The (Drow) assassin runs after Fee-Ree and tries again... But she's ready; both of its attacks miss (rolls nat 1, nat 1!). It disengages and runs closer to some weights, kind of hiding amongst them.

A wight attacks Fee-Ree; both attacks miss; the Drow warrior next to Savra moves to attack the repositioned Nissa; first attack hits for 15 damage including poison, second misses. The wight that'd previously attacked Taz runs up and tries again but misses both times. The other one that'd been on Deni is now up close with Fee-Ree; she blocks its attack with spectral wings. Another attacks Gnog; the life-drain touch hits him; con save -> no ill effects; 5->2 damage.

Savra rus up to Nissa and tries Vampiric Touch. She hits, 5d6 necrotic -> 14, healing herself for that amount.

Fee-Ree throws out a sunbeam, hitting one weight - which surprisingly, despite advantage, succeeds its dodge - and assassin, which fails its save, taking 23 radiant damage and becoming blinded. The wight takes 11.

Taz, seeing the assassin on the ropes, throws a Psychic Lance at him. DC18 int save, 27 potential damage. The assassin is taken down - despite succeeding the save. He sends some bardic inspiration to Nissa, who has been struggling with con saves.

Gnog risk 4 opp attacks from weights to run out and flank Savra with Nissa. One wight hits, only 2 damage. Other miss, but the drow warrior crits yet again, dealing 9->4 piercing and 10->5 poison damage. Non-reckless attacks on Savra; he doesn't want to kill her, but nature check 4+1 he has no insight; he attacks; hits, for a ridiculous *maximum possible damage* on this - 2d6->6, d12->12, 31 damage. This takes her down; Gnog doesn't know if she is down or dead. He moves around to attack the Drow warrior again flanked by Nissa; crit! -> 6d6+2d12+7 -> 37.

Nissa's turn. She raises her hands and begins to draw a sigil above herself with a staff. This summons two large boars. They immediately attack; one charges a wight, hitting for 17 damage; another hits the Drow warrior that'd been attacking Gnog but without charging, doing 11 damage.

Weights near the boars retaliate; one hits twice, doing 18 damage. Deni meanwhile hits a wight for 41 damage and takes it down. The Drow warrior comes for Gnog, though it gets hit by an opp attack from a boar for 10 damage. It attacks Gnog - critically hits on the second attack; the third time it's critted against Gnog. 11->5 piercing, but somehow only 6d6 -> 10->5 poison.

Another wight attacks a boar; it hits twice; 11 damage. Another wight attacks for 11 more damage.

The warrior near Gnog attacks Nissa; Gnog reacts with Sentinel for 21 damage; but the warrior still hits Nissa, with one of its attacks at least. 17 damage.

A wight goes for Fee-Ree. First attack fails; second hits, but she throws up a shield to defect it. Another tries to hit Deni but fails.

OK, so Savra's not dead - she stitches herself back up, 10hp gained and rises. She moves away - Gnog has used his reaction - to move behind Nissa. She casts "Cause Fear" in a cone out at Gnog and Nissa - Wisdom saving; Gnog 17, just makes it. Nissa needs her bardic inspiration and *just* makes it also; gains 9hp in the process. Savra uses Noxious Touch on Nissa, hitting for 14 poison damage. Fortunately she succeeds a con save and is not poisoned.

Fee-Ree shouts, "I'm really sorry guys..." in the direction of Gnog and Nissa and redirects her sunbeam. I mean, *Gnog* has said she's OK with this kind of thing...! 31 radiant. Both Gnog and Nissa succeed their con saves! 15 damage (7 in Gnog's case). A weight is destroyed; the warrior in front of Gnog and Nissa too; Savra makes her con save, though, so only takes 15 damage and is taken down again. She's burned up by the radiant damage; spores on her start to disintegrate; her body turns to dust. Oooooh dear. I guess she's a lich so she'll resurrect, like, eventually...?!

Taz sees a lich nearby and booming-blade attacks a nearby lich. The d8s are low but main damage is OK, 17 overall. That's just enough! The wight falls. He re-inspires Nissa.

Gnog recklessly attacks the remaining Drow warrior; he hits for 19 and it falls. He runs to the nearest wight and continues; hits for 23. The boar that had been assisting over by Fee-Ree and Deni now turns and runs back towards Gnog's group; the boar near Gnog attacks the same wight as Gnog; crit! 17 damage.

It's Nissa's turn (and her boards recover 8 health at that moment). She casts Revivify on Savra! She holds the spell at the edge of operation; "Hold your people back!" commands Nissa; she calls off the wights and combat is over.

### 5000 XP each; everyone including Nissa donates to Taz; 2500 each, 15000 to Taz => LEVEL 12!

Gnog is glancing at Taz to make sure he's OK after all the damage and sees something quite remarkable and unexpected. Bright white light is emanating from inside the casing and all the exterior lights are similarly illuminated; his eyes too; it is perhaps not the same as Fee-Ree's spark, but something extraordinary seems to be happening. It's only a brief moment - a sudden brightening, shift to white and a flare of light, which subsides as quickly as it grew. Taz's eyes widen, his head cocks to one side; he notices Gnog looking and smiles back. He simply says, "I have grown".

Taz has just gained remarkable skills.

As he becomes more distanced from the initial "bootstrap" soul of Garren, his confidence in his abilities grows. He has had little call for his religious proficiency, but has used arcana frequently; his proficiencies are shifting, religion dropping to half, but arcana to full; and further, his adept use of magic raise him to an expert of the arcane. His frequent conversation insights yield a greater command of his senses and skills - his time spent with the party in the various (mis!)adventures gives him greater and greater experience with the subtle mannerisms of others - and here, too, he now gains expertise.

His greater insights and arcane abilities bear fruit in an unusual way; he realises he can cast additional spells; a way to protect people from magical effects (L5 Circle Of Power) and a way to bring people back if they've just recently been taken down (L3 Revivify).

Gnog pulls out a cloth and heads over to clean up the casing. It's fully repaired, but there's a lot of residual dust from rust, spores and so-on. Taz says he can clear it with a cantrip but Gnog confesses that he likes doing this for Taz and Taz confesses in turn that he likes it too. Gnog pauses with the cloth for a moment, briefly hugs Taz (who hugs back) and, with neither of them saying anything, Gnog just carries on cleaning.

Once we're done, we turn our attention to a seething Savra. Taz says, "We won't murder just to get what we want. And I think it was *we* misjudged *you*, thinking you would be a better leader." "I'm not a leader. But I *am* looking after the security of the Golgari." "What is it you fear Vraska will do?" "I do not trust her. There are too many questions she won't answer." "We do not fully either; as we said in the hall, we need the *Golgari* to help, and we work with whoever can achieve that. We align with nobody. But it seems to us that the Kraul are responsible for the undercity."

Savra says that they'd do her bidding; but Vraska might need consent! "We need not have any further quarrel." She turns to Nissa. "You saved me years of waiting, by bringing me back before my physical being had disintegrated. For that, I am... Thankful. And willing to give all of you the benefit of the doubt, and believe you when you say that you're not aligning with her, to unseat us."

In the end, Savra is an uneasy ally of sorts. We want an outcome - we don't care who we deal with to make it happen. But she advises us, that neither the Golgari nor the surface dwellers will move into a undercity unless they have something concrete; proof, a reason. "There are some who see and think; and there are those who merely make up the numbers. That has always been the way of the world. Not lesser or greater - merely how people are."

Savra mists away, back down under the pavement.

Gnog checks in with Fee-Ree. She's not feeling great; although healed, she *was* very injured, is very tired and needs a break. Somewhere to drink? Not had dinner. Nissa (Nissa **Revane**, surname noted at this point), "me neither" - Gnog sees then how injured she is! On my goodness... We get to the nearest north P6 tavern; with permission of the bar staff, Taz plays his song of rest to help with healing. Nissa kindly offers to pay - she's decided she'll head back to Vitu Ghazi after this as it's later and she needs a good sleep. It's 7:30pm; we thank her and off she goes.

So, where were we? Ah yes, Dimir. Blistercoils, Library. Perhaps by now, another room for the night. We follow due process; our primary goal is to see if we can get help with Vraska's mind block; secondary, if they have it, information on the red crystal ploy.

Deni knows how to progress the second part, at least. She can do this in a "safe" way, using contacts that we learned of through Lavaz. It might not be safe to try and help Vraska yet, until Bolas' influence is rooted out. This means we *do not* go to the library; we head to a specific bar. Deni tells us to get booth. She goes to the bar, gets a few drinks; "Now we wait".

Gnog broaches the topic with Deni of the killing of the Dimir agent that had broken into our room. She said she wasn't unduly stressed; she treated it as battle, once he was captured; he was an enemy, could've used a sending spell, judged no peaceful solution. She says, "There is no way to do this with doubt. What I can't do, is wait in hesitation. That might not have been the only solution but we did not have time to debate or discuss."

A server comes over with some food that we didn't order - bread with some not great looking cheese - leans over, giving each of us a plate and says, "The lavatories are downstairs. There are two separate ones - for men and women. They're currently unoccupied. Enjoy your meal" - and walks off. Deni says "I think I should wash my hands before eating!" and heads off, giving us the "follow me but don't get up in one go!" 

With characteristic subtlety, we head down, past the "out of order" sign (!) to a rather manky toilet with a ply board side to each which can be easily moved aside; a dank corridor runs between the two toilets. Taz has to go first - it's dark - dancing lights trail behind.

Taz perception 6 (!) - he doesn't realise until he walks into it, that there's a door at the end of the corridor! KLONK. We open the door. Inside is a small room, damp, smelly, table and someone sat polishing a pair of shoes. Gnog says, "Hello, mine are bit mucky too!" "Come in. Close the door." We comply. There are seats; we are invited to sit and do. "It appears they have taken the bait. I don't know if you had any trouble but I hope nobody was injured and that you're fine." Deni explains our, umm, trouble. We do at least have one thing that Deni didn't discard after impersonating the operative. It's a small key. We leave it with this strange man. He says he'll "look after all the details and make sure this is not noticed".

"There is now movement... We believe there's movement tonight, are you in a fit state to pursue this?" "We have no choice; fit state or otherwise, we go. Where?" He writes down an address - no, more than one? "What we know is that our watches have seen them go in and retrieve crates you planted; we followed the wagon and it was transferred to this location" (the address?) "and we know that this connects to a neighbouring warehouse that has access down into an old tunnel system running under the city. They seem to be using that to transfer things out of sight. Now, on this piece of paper, you'll find *three* addresses. These are entrypoints to the three locations that we know exist along the path, but we don't know which one they've gone to and can't risk following. This information has only just come to our attention; the trail will be fresh. If you're unable to pursue this that's fine, we can watch to see if anything emerges from them and pick this up again tomorrow. That's your call." "I already said. Tonight."

He produces "one of these for each of you" and hands us a small vial with swirling light grey-blue liquid. If we're caught or in danger of it, crush the vial and inhale the vapours. It will clear selective memories related to our meetings so that it will not identify you as working with us. It will independent and with those memories missing they cannot be revealed even with questioning and truth spells."

"Well then. We'd better go."

Taz insight with BFS, 28. This person knows a lot about the original plan so it seems legit; he is who he appears to be - or at least extremely well informed. The vial he mentions will remove memories; the insight of the wording, though, suggests that it might remove memories across a period of time rather than just remove specific memories. There would be an entire blank period - between now and what we do next.

Once we're outside, Taz tells people this thought; says to the party, "I am not happy. We must do nothing else but this plan. No friendship or bonding - I cannot afford to lose that. Just this job. Only then am I prepared to use this vial."

Deni says, "then we should head straight there!" "Where?" "Three places - how do you want to do this?" All three are in P6. 

* One is on the edge of Foundry Street
* Another is behind Kamen Fortress
* The third is just South of that, almost at the Wayport bridges

Gnog suggests Wayport might a way to fence goods? It seems the busiest and easiest to accidentally find but if they're trying to move these things off-word - IF - then perhaps there first, except, we're closest to Foundry Street and on that basis alone - there. Deni reminds us that we have allies.

We go to the factory we helped with cooling units. We can at least ask them. There's a shift on; 24/7 operation, it seems; a few sat outside on crates, others on their shift inside. We say that hey, there's crime, but the kind that Krenko wouldn't like. We're called inside.

They can help listen for movement, but only one one of the three addresses. We suggest the closest and most familiar then - Foundry St itself. So they organise a group to head over to that factory and listen... And we ask if there's a way to identify them? Yeah, they'll glow red if radiant energy is nearby. They actually have a small generator which can do that! So they can help see the red glow - albeit faintly - if it's there.

They scurry off; and we have no way to communicate, so we have to go with them. They're able to use pipes to look down into tunnels rather than storming through below, so we move quite quickly - we have to run to keep up - and we don't need lots of stealth rolls! Gnog carries their radiant energy generator, as it's quite heavy. Eventually we reach a factory at the target address. We check... Nothing there... A goblin from that factory then approaches, they did hear something but it was maybe an hour ago. "OK Thanks!" then "Sorry boss! Was an hour ago! Good luck!"

They head off, with two of them lugging the generator.

We elect to try and overtake them overland - to the farthest address, near Wayport; Deni takes us as directly as she can. Now we need to get down. We find the address; a large storehouse, for one of the markets. Deni picks the lock easily enough; it's dark inside, Taz looks around from the door, perception 16. Nothing unusual. He sees a trap door, like a cellar, with a lift mechanism. We don't risk lights - Gnog and Fee-Ree will have to hold hands and follow behind Deni (with goggles) and Taz until we come across something and need to light up. Down we go.

Gnog athl 16 - he quietly, manually lowers the lift without using its loud mechanism. Taz sees the coast is clear. He guides us, with Deni - mouse Familiar running ahead (30ft darkvision) - the mouse can smell clearly that someone has recently been this way. Taz sees, around the corner, a large underground bunker of some kind, opening out onto a huge cavern. It looks like part of Deadbridge Chasm, an old city area. We're on the edge. Crumbled steps. Reminds us of Nightvale actually, buttresses holding up a natural cavern roof formed originally by collapsed buildings and walls.

**There is a group up ahead with light.**

100ft away, or so. As we watch, **a section of them seem to split away and head off**, the other group heading our way. They haven't seen us. We see:

* Three humanoid shapes
* Taz perception with BFS 22 - hovering above the group is a reasonably large winged creature with a rider on it, gliding our way
* The other group is no longer in sight, seemingly having dropped down somewhere - stairs presumably

**Taz thinks this thing might've seen us.** We can run or jump into combat; that'll be on the ledge near the stairs. If we run, we learn nothing. If we fight, we probably alert the second group, but we might learn something from the battle, or at least be able to search around afterwards.

Initiative:

* Deni: 21
* Fee-Ree: 17
* Taz: 14
* Gnog: 13

They're about about 60ft-70ft away and lower than us (except the flying creature), since we're up on the "landing" with the crumbling stairs down. Deni tucks into a corner, sees the strange flying creature now that Taz has pointed it out, gains insight into how to fight it and, immediately, fires at it with a magic arrow. She just hits, for 13 + 27 -> 40 damage. It's a Flying Gloamwing - not that we know it! - we do notice that as the arrow heads towards it, it seems relatively unbothered; the arrow initially passes through bits of it that seem to be shadow; but there seems to be a core, perhaps because of the magic of the arrow, causing the creature to be surprised by the injury.

One of the humanoids moves forwards; looks female, as far as we can see from the light they carry and shed; we're just within 60ft *except* Fee-Ree, stood behind. The rest of us feel a strange shift in reality, as in our minds we hear strange tendrils reach out. A voice says, "You should not be here. Turn around, leave and forget that you saw anything. This never happened." Wisdom saving:

* Taz 6 -> burns his inspiration -> 20 (phew!) - this is a magical, psionic ability (saves)
* Gnog 23 (saves)
* Deni 17 (just saves)

No effect and no damage - we're not sure what we've avoided but for now at least, we are OK!

The gloamwing and rider fly right up, getting very close to Deni. It seems to be made out of, well, shadow! The head looks like a cross between wyvern and rat; it is undead. The rider is almost skeletal with long spindly limbs. We wonder if the strange moving shadows we saw in Nightvale might have been other examples. It attacks Deni; the first would hit, but she reacts with the spectral wings to deflect it; the second attack misses too. The creature upon its back - some kind of spectre perhaps? - is looking at us; it rears back, holding a scythe; it's wearing a strange white mask, which it takes off and underneath is an horrific screaming face which emits a psychic scream that hits everyone except Taz. More wisdom saves, DC15.

* Gnog 19 (saves)
* Fee-Ree 26 (saves)
* Deni 19 (saves)

We take half damage and aren't stunned - 22 -> 11 psychic. Dammit, Gnog's no good with that (not that he's raging yet anyway). Now the rider swings its scythe towards Deni. It looks like it's going to hit and hit badly; Taz reacts with Silvery Barbs, which distracts the rider, making it miss badly. Advantage to Deni.

Fee-Ree doesn't like this spectre, but she likes what the humanoids below did even less and throws a fireball at them. L3, 8d6 -> 31. As the fireball illuminates the space, we see that there's some kind of additional shadow creature, hiding in what was darkness. It's caught in the blast. The mage that attacked us, the shadow creature, another humanoid nearby *and* the remaining humanoid - who wears more noble, caster-like clothes - take full damage.

The shadow creature moves forward then suddenly - kind of teleports. Lack of light near us; it moves between shadows; we have no lights up. It uses "lashing shadows"; strange cutting shadows are thrown outwards in a wide radius. DC16 dex.

* Gnog perception disadv 24, sees it coming, adv dex, 22 (saves)
* Taz 10, fails badly
* Fee-Ree fails
* Deni succeeds (no damage)

27 necrotic damage. Even rider and gloamwing take full damage (half to Gnog).

Taz starts running Countercharm. As a bonus action, he throws bardic inspiration to Fee-Ree who has struggled with saves.

Gnog rages, and jump-flies attempting to land *on* the gloamwing to attack the rider. Adv athl 29! He's right behind the rider and swings twice with Stormbringer. He has flanking advantage with Deni. He hits, for 19 damage. The gloamwing appears to freak out a bit at this, as if hitting the spectre hurts it and he shouts that down to this party - "spectre damage seems to hurt the flying thing - they're linked!" and swings again. Another hit, but only 15 damage this time.

The humanoid that'd been near the shadow creature flies up and casts Hold Person on Gnog. He rolls 11, 13 with his last luck point; Fee-Ree blows two sorcery points; d4 -> 3, total 16; this is enough to save ("Thanks Fee-Ree!"). He looks around to see what the creature is; it has fangs; Gnog shouts, "Shit, vampire, do we have radiant?!"

It tries to hide in the dim light; but it's in mid air and we kinda can still see (Nat 1 + 6!).

The remaining humanoid moves alongside his companion on the ground, throws back a hood - male, human, apparently a drama queen - crazy painted lines on its face; not Dimir, at least not like we've seen - looks almost more like Rakdos or Gruul? Weird.

It looks at all the party and - Gnog being too close to its presumed-friends of spectre and gloamwing - it hits everyone else with some kind of spell; it's as if it calls out to some being, some ancient-sounding name; opens its mouth which takes a strange large, square shape and a howling weird alien sound projects out into a 20ft cube around is, including in fact the shadow creature - and it has a fear effect; Taz's countercharm bears fruit - advantage DC15 wisdom saving:

* Taz nat 20!->25, half damage 9->4
* Deni OK as well -> 4 damage
* Fee-Ree 22 -> 4 damage

No-one ends up frightened. A strange shadow form of mage armour appears to form around it. Taz recognises that; a warlock.

Deni's up again. She disengages from the mess around her, jumps back behind Fee-Ree and attacks the spectre with her Silvery Barbs advantage - and with sneak attack since Gnog is in melee. Definitely hits, but damage is middling - 37. It's badly injured but still up.

The mage that first attacked us moves closer. It's looking at Gnog; it casts Dominate Person; wisdom saving, with advantage; 21 thanks to Countercharm.

The Gloamwing tries to shake off Gnog. Adv athletics bad rolls, only high total 16, but it's enough to hold on as Gloamwing only rolls 13! It starts to pull away; Taz has no opportunity attack as it has Fly By. It flies back towards the previously-attacking mage, perhaps heading towards the vampire. It tries to bite Gnog; just misses. The claws can't reach. The rider, not having reacquired any special powers, somehow kind of effortlessly stands while staying on the gloamwing and attacks twice with its scythe. The second would hit but Gnog, not wanting to risk any potential weird effects from this strange creature's weapon, uses the spectral wings. The scythe is wicked looking in itself, but as it glances off the wings Gnog sees that it has some kind of trail of screaming apparitions - psychic damage avoided perhaps?

Fee-Ree shouts, "Sorry Gnog!" - and he knows what's coming! - she throws another fireball, right into the middle, catching all the ground crew and flyers. Only the shadow creature near us is missed. L3, 8d6 -> 27. The mage who first attacks fails his save and is incinerated. The gloamwing and spectre both succeed, taking 13 each. The vampire fails, taking the full damage. It falls out of the sky, apparently dead! The warlock fails as well. Unfortunately - so does Gnog, so he takes 27 damage - Fee-Ree's damage resistance bypasses his rage protection. Worse, the spectre was killed by the damage; the gloamwing shrieks and its body starts to disintegrate, so the still-smoking Gnog falls 30ft to the ground. Non-adv dex save high roll, 22 total; takes half of 12->6, halved via rage to 3. He lands on his feet. He laughs and says, "Good spell Fee-Ree!"

Fee-Ree turns to face the shadow creature nearby, knowing an attack is coming - it goes for her three times. The bite lands and Taz isn't able to do much to act; its next attack would critically hit but just in time now Taz casts Silvery Barbs and the distraction is enough for Fee-Ree to be able to throw up a shield. The third attack nonetheless smashes through even that, so she's hit twice - one bite gives 21 piercing damage, the claw gives 13 slashing and needs a wisdom saving throw; frightened, but Taz is still giving advantage for that; she succeeds.

The shadow somehow becomes incorporeal and floats down on the ground below Taz, then starts to move towards Gnog. Taz throws 3 eldritch blasts after it. Hit, very low damage 7; hit, max damage 15; final one just hits, medium damage 10. He also throws Bardic Inspiration at Gnog.

Gnog runs forward and recklessly attacks the remaining warlock, ignoring whatever is going on behind him. He hits for a very high 26 damage; swings again; hits again, 23 more damage; the warlock falls, calling out a name as it falls... Never a good sign! A lantern that was being carried falls to the ground, so Gnog is almost in complete dark.

Deni pulls on her goggles now that it's gone dark - she gets insight on the shadow creature; fires; hits; a very solid 49 damage. The creature screams, close to death - *but not down*. Fee-Ree moves forward; she really can't see this shadow creature in now near total darkness; she hazards a guess and tries a firebolt (disadvantage). Nat 1. Boo.

Now the shadow creature moves... And instead of going for Gnog, it goes for Fee-Ree. The first bite misses; but the next two attacks do find their mark though. Taz has used his reactions and she has nothing that can defend against the unnervingly accurate attacks (23, 25 vs AC 17). The bite is a mercifully low 12 damage, the claw 15, another wisdom saving throw (no adv.), *just* matches DC. No fear.

Taz turns to see the creature. He can see it clearly. He backs away to get some distance, knowing an opportunity attack will happen. AND OF FUCKING COURSE IT IS A CRIT, for fuck's sake. It's a horrendous 44 damage, leaving him with only 19; he's very severely damaged. He throws his eldritch blasts anyway; hits, 8 damage, and that takes it down. Taz had no idea it was that close to death. It dissipates; there's nothing more to hit.

"We must follow the others despite my condition" shouts Taz, and we get the group together; we first use our "free" Cure Wounds from Garren. Fee-Ree gets 7 from Taz; Taz gets 10 from Fee-Ree, 10 from Deni and 9 from Gnog. She recovers 13 via a greater healing potion; again for 10; blows a Superior, for 27 more; Gnog tries a Greater but only gets 12; Deni gives Taz two potions of Greater Healing; it's expensive, but 31 healing gets him close to full. Taz uses the mandolin and brings Fee-Ree exactly to full. Fee-Ree has a little-used L2 slot for Cure Wounds on Gnog bringing him another 17 and while he's a bit down - 171 out of 197. It takes only about 30-ish seconds of actions in parallel but we have to collect together down on the cavern floor and it all adds up.

Gnog D100 by request -> 39; D6 -> 2; a hasty check of bodies. On the vampire, the body now a husk, apparently destroyed by flame, is a medallion and rings that identify it. There's an insignia too. Looks high level. It holds a bag, which inside contains Orzhov platinum coins - 25 of them. We don't pocket the money but we take all these things. The warlock carries a Gruul charm - indeed at closer inspection, the markings look closer to those of Nikya. So there's a connection with her and Tesseret, as well as these Dimir. We find a Potion Of Heroism on the warlock.

### 5000 XP taken equally

We run over to where we last saw the lights from the split-off party. The path opens onto some kind of unusual domed chamber, that seems like it used to control maybe a reservoir or something. It's now empty but there are plenty of trickles and streams. In the middle of dried reservoir area, a glowing blue light hanging maybe 10ft up, it's enough to see a true Drow - not Devkarin - with all the usual trappings, as if from Toril - a Shadowblade; two strange constructs; and some kind of big construct carrying boxes. The area has a number of other boxes all stacked up. **In the middle is a male human, dreadlocks, metallic arm, strange bands of metal spinning around, blueish light from its skin, and around the light up above, a strange design that seems to be forming some kind of gate, tracing a pattern around all the boxes.** ***TESSERET HIMSELF!*** They're apparently about to be portalled away.

We exchange glances, a shared sinking feeling, a knowledge of what we're getting into; Tesseret would be difficult at our best, and we're two battles down, but he's about to leave - it's now or never. Fee-Ree maybe still could portal *us* away if it came to it? Deni has her bow ready. Taz casts Circle of Power. Gnog rages (still holding onto Stormbringer). Fee-Ree is conflicted about what spells to use; she's really low; decides on L5 Fly - on Deni, Taz and herself.

Although we're about 100ft away, Tesseret notices our actions - our spellcasting could not be quiet! - and we'd pretty much stumbled in our haste around the corner to the corridor looking straight through across the old reservoir. He throws chain lightning at us!

Initiative:

* (Tesseret 24)
* Deni 21
* Gnog 18 (NB still has bardic inspiration from prior battle)
* Taz 9
* Fee-Ree 7 (NB still has bardic inspiration from prior battle)

The lightning targets Taz then arcs to the other three of us. Fee-Ree risks Counterspell; she can't cast high enough to outright cancel it, so CHA DC16. Get 12 with Tides of Chaos, so rolls 2d10 (Taz bardic) and gets 10! 22, success! The lighting arcing towards Taz; the mote of potential circling and the Counterspell aura streak out, meeting it mid way; it explodes in mid air.

Tesseret raises one claw and sigils above expand outwards, creating some kind of box around him; he starts to shimmer.

Deni takes aim at Tesseret. She figures she might disrupt what he's doing. No crit but 30 to hit, dealing 42 damage; but the construct next to Tesseret appears to redirect the arrow in a protective act of self-sacrifice and the construct is destroyed by Deni's arrow. Tesseret's spell continues.

The remaining small construct near Tesseret moves forward towards us. The large box-carrying one turns and starts to put out metal legs and claws, moving our way too. They're around half-way or a little over towards us. 

Gnog half runs, half flies over channels and uneven ground to move 40ft forwards, just getting within range for his Rakdos charm. He casts Shatter by Tesseret. The 3d8 damage roll is poor, only 13. Some of the equipment is hit and shattered. Two of the pieces of equipment move! They were constructs. Constructs tend to be hit for full (disadv roll) - and surprisingly (nat 2 roll) Tesseret fails his con save and doesn't seem to deem it worth resisting, taking the 13... But he does decide to throw a lightning claw at Gnog, but surprisingly (another bad roll for Tesseret) wildly misses.

Gnog can now see some kind of golem behind Tesseret, fashioned to look humanoid, arcing with lightning; it moves forward full distance.

The shadowblade Drow now acts. It moves forward into a channel, using its shadow to jump back up right behind Gnog! One attack lands, 7d6+5 necrotic! 27->13. This guy is a heavy-hitter.

Taz shouts, "Try to keep close to stay within the protective circle!" and moves forward a bit to cover Gnog again. He considers Psychic Lance but figures it'll just be resisted and considers the drow, but Tesseret is the issue. He shouts, "Can we get damage onto the crystals or equipment?" and then throws eldritch blasts at Tesseret. Miss, hit for bad damage roll 7, miss. He's rolling like shit. Tesseret looks at him in disgust; holds his spell. Noting that Fee-Ree had to use her inspiration and she's an important caster for us, he throws bardic inspiration back her way again.

Some kind of weird clockwork snake - what *is* it with this guy?! - moves forward 60ft towards us. There is now a cluster of weird constructs getting close to Gnog.

Fee-Ree flies upwards to get a good view of the field of battle. Tesseret appears to now be by himself, inside his strange, ever-strengthening spell cube. She shouts, "Gnog, sorry again!" and spends 2 sorcery points to quicken L4 Fireball (no wild magic surge) right into the middle of the construct and Drow melee, including Gnog; she uses a secondary sorcery points to try and boost damage further, unhappy with how the fireball is developing *as* it bursts. Neat trick. Total damage potential 37. Gnog dex save adv. 20; takes 18 damage (and he's glad he's in his clothes of mending, they can take it!). One construct is destroyed; the Drow sadly dodges the worst of it; the lightning humanoid-like construct takes full damage; the box lifter construct likewise; the cobra despite advantage fails too but is not taken down, surprisingly, by the 37 damage.

Now Fee-Ree has a free action, which she uses to cast Firebolt at Tesseret; she misses sadly. He laughs scornfully.

Tesseret is up again. He shouts, "You are the meddling ones! Yes you are! Are you - do you - ha, do you think you are the new Gate Watch?! You are *far* too late; there are powers beyond your comprehension moving across this universe. I advise you to do the wise thing and submit to our control, but something tells me you're probably a bit too stubborn. Just nod if you -" (Gnog gives him the finger) "- yes, very well then..." - and Tesseret casts Wall Of Force over himself, a 10ft radius dome. "I don't have time for interruptions. I need to get this to Amonkhet!" - he continues with his other hand tracing the other sigils. A gateway is beginning to open. We can see through reality; a desert landscape beyond, shimmering interview as if being revealed from behind a sheet of burning paper. Parts of his body appear to drop off; they make new constructs.

We've not seen this kind of spell before. Deni shouts, "No!", takes aim, pulls a magic arrow and fires at Tesseret. She crits! That's super, super frustrating... It just hits the wall and disintegrates. It's likely impenetrable.

The box carrier construct moves forward a little bit past Gnog, so it's just within 20ft of Taz; it sprays some kind of gel at him. It appears to be a spell of sorts; with advantage from his Circle spell, Taz takes 7 damage but manages to dodge hardening crystal (DC15, gets 16 dex save). Sadly he rolls a 1 on his check and completely loses his expensive Circle spell. The construct then attacks Gnog with metal claws, and gets a miss and a crit. Only 13->6 damage. He's grappled though.

Gnog swings recklessly at the construct twice; it takes 16 damage, but nothing from lightning at all. He swings again; only 12 damage for that one. He shouts, "Anyone able to get a spell *inside* that dome to break equipment or crystals?"

Gnog's in a bit of a mess. The lightning golem walks forward - advantage from flanking, from his recklessness and from him being grappled. Both hit. 10->5 and 8->4 damage. Now the Drow shadowblade acts. It casts Darkness! The only person who can see now is Taz. The Drow attacks 3 times (quadruple advantage! LOL) - miss, miss, hits too hard to block with spectral wings. 26->13 damage, reduced by 9 via Stone's Endurance.

Taz wants to use the mizzium apparatus for Shatter but can't possibly reach within 60ft of the strange dome that Tesseret put up. Instead, then, he opts for Eldritch Blasts at the Drow. He hits all three times, for high damage on the whole - max 15, then 7, then 13 (35 total). The Drow holds the spell up at all times. Taz throws some bardic inspiration at Deni then heads forward, slipping into the edge of the darkness.

The clockwork cobra, no longer able to see Taz, instead heads in Fee-Ree's direction - though she's flying. She tries L4 Dispel Magic at the dome - but it does nothing. It doesn't even seem to have had any chance of success. She alerts the party.

Tesseret laughs. "Oh you're far less of a threat than I thought! You don't even know the basics of magic. Pathetic. Is this really the first time you've encountered a wall of force?! You're no threat at all." Tesseret's spell advances - it seems on the cusp of completion. Fee-Ree flies forward, but as she does, the dome and everything within it seems to just vanish; it portals away. A crackle of lightning arcs around as the dome falls first, and Fee-Ree reacts at the very last moment three eldritch blasts at Tesseret in the last second; two hit, knocking off part of his armour, clattering to the ground outside the domed area; one piece smashes into a box, breaking it open; crystals visible; then it all implodes into a dot as the gate closes with a loud THUMP as air fills the space.

Deni aims at the cobra. Another crit! 19+44 -> 63, the cobra is obliterated.

The drone grasping Gnog only has one free claw so it tries to hit with that, apparently not disadvantaged by the darkness spell. Double crit, FFS. The other claw grapples Gnog; 16->8 and 14->7 damage. Gnog changes tactic and tries for the Drow, recklessly attacking in its direction (negating disadvantage). Misses (nat 1) and would miss (nat 4->16) but for bardic (7 on d10), which means he hits, and he can't see any other creatures but his target ends up with a con save for thunder damage but succeeds; damage roll is also almost minimum, at 13 (Drow holds concentration). Bad turn for Gnog. The Lightning drone hits once, for 16->8 damage; but now the Shadowblade Drow has as go too. Would hit; wings deployed. Then YET ANOTHER CRIT, 57 necrotic -> 28 damage; misses the last one.

Taz casts Psychic Lance at the drow. It works! 26 psychic damage; it is incapacitated until the start of Taz's next turn; and the darkness spell falls too. He throws *another* bit of inspiration back at Gnog. That's his last one.

Fee-Ree *twins* Firebolt, casting one towards the box carrying drone and one towards the lightning golem. Both hit! 16 to the box carrier, 19 to the lightning golem. Deni aims at the box carrier and hits; 35 damage. Doesn't take it down! DAMMIT. The drone is using both claws to grapple Gnog; but it gets the "crystalline spit" back; it tries to get Taz. Nat 17+3! Makes the save; dodges and takes 7 damage.

Gnog's pissed off at the drone still being up and attacks recklessly. Hits for 13; it fails; he changes target to the Drow, hits but crappy 14 damage (1 on the d12, FML).

The lightning golem turns and starts to walk to Taz - Gnog, Sentinel - hits for 15 damage and stops it in its tracks. 10 more from lightning; but it absorbs it and HEALS for 10. It turns and attacks Gnog instead (Gnog shouts, "Don't use lightning on it!"); hits once for 13->6.

The Drow is still stunned, right up until Taz acts. Taz shouts, "Some needs to take out the Drow" and fires Eldritch blasts at the damaged lightning golem, since he'd seen it heading his way. Hits for 13, then 6 (worst possible) but that's enough; it goes down. The third *would've* hit but for another minimum possible damage.

Fee-Ree casts L4 Chromatic Orb (fire) towards the Drow. She hits, for 33 damage, no wild magic surges. The Drow is, as per tradition, still up but almost down. Deni takes aim - but amazingly, misses (2 lots of d20->3). Gnog tries again; recklessly attacks; hits for 20; that takes down the Drow. No need for another swing. ABOUT FUCKING TIME.

Taz is asked to send to Niv. "Tesseret Encountered Below Kamal Fortress. Engaged In Battle. Escaped By Portal To Amonkhet. Some Equipment Destroyed But Most Was Transported. We Are Still Alive." Niv responds; "Interesting. I Will Have To Recalculate What This Means. It May Be Planned. Unclear. I Must Think On It." He also sends that to Lavaz of the Dimir. No response to that one.

We examine what's left, but expect little of interest; we pay particular attention to the bits of armour that fell off Tesseret. We pick it up handling in cloth, wrapping it and putting in a backpack, not the bag of holding. Taz arcana check 30! "Oh my goodness. I know what this is! It is an extremely rare material, found only in very select planes - *not* Amonkhet - this is not the alloy I saw in the dream. This is something available on a few worlds - Kaladesh, Eberron and Torril. This is metallised Etherium." Gnog confirms, "Did you just say Toril?" "Yes. It is *extremely* rare". Gnog says, "Then our world is in greater peril than we realised and the necessity of our success here in Ravnica is duly amplified. Toril must be a world of interest to Tesseret".

There's nothing much else of interest from the shattered constructs, but there are some belongings scattered around; and we examine the Drow. Taz investigates the belongings - 15+5 -> 20 - while Deni looks at the Drow. It has a hat of disguise of sorts; looks more like a scull cap; Deni take that. We also take any clothing it has with identifying marks.

By request: D100 -> only 19. Looking around, we also find an elemental air gem of lighting (blue sapphire). Deni identifies it. Gnog figures he has little use for bonus actions (ahem) so takes the gem as an option for future combat (or we sell it!). We also find - what fortune! - a pair of sending stones; that saves us some money! Speaking of which, the Drow has a bag of money; 5 Orzhovian noble coins!

### 5000XP for the four of us, taken equally

Taz, one more message to Lavaz. "We Have Identifying Artefacts Retrieved From Combatants. Request Urgent Meeting With Trusted Dimir Representative, Now If Possible!" - immediate response, "Come To Duskmantle".

Gnog wraps his knuckles playfully on Taz's casing - winces cos that hurts - and says, "Thanks for saving my ass again!" - Fee-Ree helps him a bit with L2 Cure Wounds, healing for 16. He thanks her but says we should just hasten. Yes, we're messed up but we figure, yes, Duskmantle, right now. We make our way to the surface; from there, it feels like a *long* walk to the Blistercoils and the gaming parlour; we're "expected" and taken straight down below. Once through the trapdoor, a mind drinker vampire (!) takes us further - and of course, we see now many of the things we were just fighting. We recognise the spectres and gloamwings for what they are, now, sat upon rooftops. Lavaz is ready to receive us at Duskmantle.

First, he thanks us. Tesseret clearly did infiltrate. But the drow impersonator, with the disguise, was the problem that they'd failed to root out - some had seen through the disguise but the decentralised nature of the Dimir was a weakness here; it alerted the Dimir but there was no traceable consistently. Others, obviously, were in on it. Every time they'd tried to move against them, agents were taken out. Too powerful (presumably, Tesseret). He even came close himself. We show him:

* Vampire's medallion, rings and identifying high-level insigna
* Vampire's 25 Orzhov coins (each worth 1pp)
* Warlock had Gruul markings, matching Nikya's sect; we still have the charm
* Drow's identifying robes
* Drow's 5 identifying noble insignias - Pontifs - worth 25pp each, very rare

...for evidence, which helps. He takes the identifying material - they carry risk to us. We're allowed to keep the 25 coins, but recommends caution with the 25pp-each insignias. He tells us to take those to the bank; they'll assume we were employed (so we figure - dress appropriately when going). We are even left with some jewellery which he says he can fence for us; sure; he gives us their value, which he estimates at 800gp.

It might be worth keeping the insignia coins for subterfuge, if we don't need them as currency.

**We raise the topic of Vraska's memory gap** with Lavaz. Can he help? He says we look fucked up and should rest! They'll met us tomorrow. He'll be busy with what we've given him today anyway.

We surface. It's really late. Deni suggests staying once more at Rainbow Falls; OK, I mean, Tesseret's *gone*. So we head there and book another room, 1 zino - and use the spa!

We sleep.

(END OF PART 17 - Part 18 next)
