# Gnog: Part 20 (The Infiltration Of Amonkhet Part 1)

We are not on Ravnica. Freshly departed and en route to Amonkhet we hope to reach the Guildspace barrier to the Astral Sea within a day. Vi's chronometer tells us that it is just past 7pm Ravnican time as we jump to fast travel.

Taz says he's happy to fly while the others, exhausted from battle, rest. So, all take a long rest while Taz flies on. After that we'll drop to our usual shifts.

## Day 53 (Ravnica 33, Riglan 89 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Tuesday (7 day week)

The first shift change to relieve Taz with Fee-Ree flying happens early, around 3am. Period 1 runs 3am-11am. Taz is close to exhaustion. We all help him to bed, thanking him repeatedly for all he's done over the course of this very difficult (and for him, very long) day.

While on his break, Gnog realises he's learned a lot from the recent experiences alongside the Boros. Despite the allure of his animal side from the Gruul, being back in the front lines, side by side with army fighters, was a stronger pull; a recognition of another way to further control his rage, channelling it more accurately to be a more effective warrior. Those attacks in the second battle in particular, requiring precision to strike the gems, were a clear indicator that his future probably doesn't lie in brute force alone. It never did, really, but inertia is what it is.

(Technically, Gnog holds L16 Barbarian and now picks up L1 Fighter, Great Weapon Master).

He doesn't know what his family might think. Perhaps they would've been proud to see him rising for the Tiamat war, but he fears they'd have been derisive of his closer emotional awareness since arriving on Ravnica. Consciously stepping away from his Barbarian roots at this point probably would increase that distance further.

Deni is on watch. Gnog heads over and sits next to her. "Wonder what my parents would've thought."

Deni: "...I don't know much about your parents."

"Oh - I know. I never talked about it. Goliaths don't. Death comes easy and your emotions have to be kept in check. It's a *hard life* Deni, small wonder so many of them are seen as aggressive and dangerous by others; but out up in those wilds, it's just - so *beautiful*. Unspoiled, raw nature, just you and the wild, against each other. The blue against the white, or the times when it all went grey, no difference between the sky or the ground, a whirling mass of wind and snow and noise... Adrenaline matching the storm. Honestly, it's breathtaking. But I guess I never did fit in with that, right? And I turned into kind of a mess in Ravnica, as it just brought all of the feelings to the front and for a while, there, I couldn't deal with them. You know all that. But... My parents. Yeah. Never approved. Too much thinking, not enough hitting. Unskilled. I sought approval; that's why I wanted to be Grog all that time. But then news came that he'd fallen from grace and that was the breaking point. So off I went; perhaps a coward. I ran for it? I don't know. Anyway. I thought I was disconnected, but the army looks after its own. We were fighting someone for some reason, some shitty place up north. Days of marching through mush. Knowing a bit more of the area now, I think we'd skirted the Evermoors and it was something to do with Silverymoon though we never went there. Just a canyon in the end. Set up for battle, war camp set down, waited for days, nothing happened - some politics took the fun out of it - but they got news to me while I was there, anyway, somehow."

"Yeah. They... Passed. Avalanche. Took out half the clan. I know I've talked about going back there, to see them. But I meant - them, the *clan*. See what's left. *Who's* left. I probably wouldn't even recognise them; there could be nobody still alive from my time now. I'd turn up and they'd have no idea who I was, but they'd know I wasn't a true Goliath anymore. So much for finding the Prometiia Ogolakamu clan! I have a saviour complex I think - always wanting to fix things; but they don't want it fixing and nobody needs to connect some ancient history with today... I'll have to let all that go, I think. Focus on seeing if we can fix Gideon."

Deni leans against Gnog for a while, quietly. Then she says: "The past - whether we are trying to get away from it or remember it - we can never change it. We can only do what we can with the time we have. That's what my grandma used to say whenever I talked about my parents. I think I know what she means now."

Another quiet moment. Then Deni exclaims - "Oh look - a space guppy!". 

We watch space guppies a while. Gnog asks Deni if she fells different today, waking up; he felt like he learned a few things, a bit more control - from the Boros. Deni thinks she's learned more insight - how to read people/creatures even better now. She thinks she may be so good at it that aiming is less important now.

Gnog chats with Fee-Ree, while flying, on a similar theme. She's seen Bolas pulling rocks from the heavens and knows how he did it now, but has a deeper understanding of the cosmos and the weave, and instead thinks she can just *picture* an outcome and make it happen - bend reality in essence - but not without risk (she took L9 Wish).

At 11am Ravnican on Vi's chronometer, it's another shift change. Before we do, Gnog asks Fee-Ree to put the ship on the drift for a moment. "Let's just take a breath". We What we saw and survived on Ravnica the last few days surely goes beyond anything we experienced with Tiamat - we had a huge army around us then. And this has involved people closer to us.

"It's confusing" says Deni. "We're on a ship in space, technicolour cosmos; it's so easy to forget what's happening down there on that very small scale. At the same time, although we're away from them, we're no less removed from it. We're on a mission to get to Amonkhet, to try and save those people we left on Ravnica. They don't get to stand on a ship, contemplating. They're fighting for their lives and we're in that fight with them, despite the weirdly disorientating calm and peace surrounding us right now".

Gnog didn't like Ravnica to start. And there is much he finds distasteful still. Yet he has come to like it; even love parts of it; and wants fiercely to free it from this peril. As we have found before, more than once - as early as Luskan and getting to know Lerustah and crew, or perhaps sooner than that - it is the people that make the place. You get to love them and, inevitably, you love the place that they call home.

At this point, we drop out of fast travel. We're close to a pod of kindori. Eight of them. On two of the largest, there seem to be small villages! Strange mushroom-like and barnacle-like things, turned into dwellings. These are much bigger settlements than the druid we saw; small creatures living within. Once past, Taz takes the helm and we drop into full speed. Fee-Ree should rotate to sleep but isn't tired enough to so she stays up.

Taz struggles a bit with the orrery - navigation tools intelligence-plus-proficiency check, but low rolls; 4+3+5+BFS 2, 14 only. By about the 6th hour of his shift, we're reaching the Guildspace boundary and Taz slows. **It's around 5pm Ravnican**. "We're about to pass through" he warns. Gnog, perception only 13. Suddenly low rolls for everyone heh. As we approach the boundary, Gnog sees a strange shimmer; a shadow or something; before he knows it, a full size space galleon emerges! Via spyglass - probably 3 decks, two storey buildings atop. It's about a mile away, so plenty of time for Taz to react. He asks Taz to move to an intercept course. Taz history 23. He recognises some of the configuration and markings; ragtag, but unmistakably Alliance. He shouts this recognition up to the crew and heads directly at them.

They come to a stop. Various people are on deck. We move in slowly to merge air bubbles to converse. Very ragtag group! Many Hadozi, some jelly-like creatures, a few astral elves, some humans, thrakun, some octopus people, even an Illithid and a small Beholder. Scary in any other context! "Have you come from Ravnica?"

There's a catch-up. Basically - don't go down unless you're in communication with ground forces and be aware there's no truly safe way to do it. They really can do little to assist other than part of the Ravnica Station humanitarian relief effort. They're able to give us tips on Amonkhet; do not just enter its Wildspace system at the closest point at the Astral Sea. For the planet, aim for the two suns; this actually reduces the distance to the planet itself.

We part ways and push through to the Astral Sea. It's an easy transition this time, surprisingly. It's familiar somehow. In the Sea, the colours - albeit muted in Guildspace - fade to a calm uniform silver. What Gnog once found disconcerting is now somehow familiar and welcoming.

Taz immediately realises he can think about Amonkhet. He latches onto the idea of it and starts to navigate.

Deni asks Gnog, "What did you learn?" "Huh?" "You said you learned from the Boros." "Oh! It was like back in the army and, I guess because there were so many years there, it pulled me stronger than the Gruul. It reminded me that I should be focusing on controlling rage, not letting run riot, and when I was trying to hit those gems in that last battle on the wall, I had to be much more careful with where I aimed. So I guess I've figured out a bit of that."

This will be the hardest part of the journey for Gnog - unavoidably clockwatching, since the Astral Sea is timeless - but having no idea how close or far we are from Amonkhet. Settling into a calm, regimented rotation of watch and rest schedules is difficult too.

At 7pm it's another shift change; Fee-Ree goes on Watch with Deni, while Gnog sleeps. Taz continues to fly. We'd normally run 6-hour shifts but we're doing 8 hours for true long rests and pushing things to the limit for Taz, with 24 hour flying spells. Fee-Ree and Deni get some reading done.

This shift takes us into the next Ravnican day.



## Day 54 (Ravnica 34, Riglan 90 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Wednesday (7 day week)

At 3am, Gnog wakes and takes watch; perception 25; no issues. Fee-Ree comes off watch onto a break; Deni goes to sleep; Taz is in his 3rd 8-hour stretch of flight. Gnog checks in on him - he's very tired but alright.

Gnog reading (while on watch): Int. check 14 (even with Luck). He understands the scroll and can read it, but would lack context but for a 19+1 -> 20 history check which lets him relate the readings to things he's heard about Amonkhet, in no small part from Taz's haunted description of the Amonkhet "waking dream".

At the 11am shift changeover, once Taz disconnects from the helm, she's made some food. She thinks it'd be nice to have a meal together - all four of us. Recipes learned from Ravnica are included - a reminder of Precinct 4. A reminder of why we're doing this, and to be with everyone. "The stone for Arxcis isn't working so I'm worried. But we're going into this together". Gnog says, "Arxcis is extraordinary - he was jettisoned onto an alien world without warning, landing in one of its most hazardous areas, and survived. If anyone's gonna make it through, he will."

There's a sort of stew, a yoghurt-kinda source, our last bread. It's a welcome break.

Technically between this and the earlier "take a breath" break, we end up at midday. Taz sleeps, Fee-Ree flies, Gnog is on a break (he cleans up from the food) and Deni is on Watch. Perception roll is high; no issues. 

Uneventful. High speed, Taz had said, through the Astral Sea. We aren't sure how he judges that! Around us, there's the impression of topography in this area; hunks of rock, or chunks of planet? Probably dead gods based on what we've heard before.

8pm - shift change - Taz returns to flying; Fee-Ree sleeps; Gnog goes on watch (perception only 15) and Deni is on a break.

In between, we do discuss *what* we might do on Amonkhet. Based on what we've been told and the scroll we've now all read - it's an old planet, its magic falling into decay. People often refer to it as "curses" as magic can fail and go awry. The whole planet suffers a magical effect called the "curse of wandering", which seems to be a field of undeath over much of the planet; it doesn't predictably affect everyone immediately, but there are is good evidence that the dead often rise as undead on this plane, spontaneously. Only very rarely does something or something who dies stay dead and pass on. To try and protect and resist this, locals apparently had complex death rituals - embalming and so-on - 'sanctify' the dead. The cities are built around areas known to be oasis of magic where the Curse Of Wandering is weakest. To increase sanctity, massive temples were built to try and divinely resist it.

According to the scroll, there have been numerous epochs in the planetary history. Because of where the planet sits and how it rotates around the sun (the other sun causing a bit of a 'tango' in orbital mechanics), the planet has not had night. At least one sun is always visible. Across that time, the planet became a desert. Seas dried. Only a few of the mighty rivers remain - all other water has retreated underground or evaporated. Numerous great rival nations have existed, but one by one they fell; only one remains, **Naktamun**. The last to fall before that was the greatest rival, **Ifnir**, considered at the time the most advanced city/culture. A centre of learning. Great libraries, universities and academies of research and magic - now lost to the desert. Remnants of the great works of other city states are partially or fully buried across the deserts of the planet. Naktamun is the remaining "shining jewel" that resisted collapse... Not so shining, anymore.

Descriptions of where Naktamun is, plus Taz's dream and conversations with Taz, mean he has a good idea of where to land.

There's a magical shield, making it invisible. Wandering undead in the deserts shouldn't encroach or assault. If one comes too close, city patrols take them out. When undead die there, there's even a chance they'll rise again unless utterly destroyed.

"So how do we kill Tesseret?" asks Gnog. "Even if he dies, he'll probably rise and even if we drop him again, he risks rising again." Fee-Ree posits that killing him within Naktamun is the best chance; the closer to temples - in theory! - the better.

Religions of Amonkhet are very dependent upon the culture of a given nature, but Naktamun's religion is an exception and seems to borrow a lot from the cities that existed before it. They have old stories of 8 animistic old gods - animalistic trait gods, things they could see in nature - this fitted in somewhat with races on the planet; snake-headed, jackal-headed and more. They're just races, not necessarily evil, whatever analogues we might draw between them and similar-looking races on Toril. There are also rare bird people, who can fly, nomadic and thought to be almost extinct. There are two races that live almost nomadically; Scorpion People in the desert and Crocodile People by the river.

Worshipped in the city are five gods:

* Hazoret, the jackal-headed God of zeal (the similar-looking people are the Khenra).
* Rhonas, the Cobra-headed God of strength (the similar-looking people are the Naga).
* Bontu, the Crocodile-headed Goddess of ambition (the similar-looking people are the Amit).
* Ketra, the Cat-headed Goddess of stability, order and protection (there are no similar-looking races on Amonkhet).
* Kefnet, the Ibis-headed God of knowledge and can fly (related to the rare bird-people).

...the scroll saying that all records of the other three Gods disappeared hundreds of years ago. We only know they must've existed because of mentions - not by name - in things recovered from the ancient, buried cities. A locust god, scarab god and scorpion god.

During the shift, the next day rolls around.



## Day 55 (Ravnica 35, Riglan 91 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Thursday (7 day week)

At midnight, Taz recognises that we're now at the boundary to the Amonkhet space. We're in front of this globe, the gateway to Amonkhet and can distinctly see two suns. Taz has to wake Fee-Ree to call us all to figure out *how* we know to get closest to the suns from an Astral Sea boundary. We've never done that before.

The appearance is strange. A sphere of sorts. As we get closer, we get an impression of size; it's very wide; but hard to judge distances. Gnog suggests Taz adopts some orbits, to see if the suns look bigger or smaller as we move around. Taz has a go - intelligence-based perception, nat 1! It's strange. Behaves like a sphere but *looks* like a disc. He's confused and asks Gnog to help. We fly around again, because we don't understand his comment. As we fly around on one particular orbital plane, but we realise it's like looking at a coin - a disc - but the face of it turns to "watch" us wherever we move. Then Deni calls - "wait, look! Is there a way to measure the distance between the two suns?"

Bizarrely, Fee-Ree produces a leek (!) since we don't seem to have string or other measurement tools; Deni holds it at arms length and notches it with a dagger. We figure we were told to "*aim between the suns*" so our best bet is to swing around and find the *widest* point between the suns then aim for the middle, since anything else seems to be too random (e.g. having them aligned - we don't know which of the two we're looking at, so we don't know which is closest to Amonkhet).

Taz is asked to fly around the disc maintaining accurate distance if he can, so that Deni's measurements work. Intelligence-based nav, 18+3+5 -> 26! Good roll. This is of great help. Deni eventually gets us at a point where she believes it's the widest point. She gets both Gnog and Fee-Ree to check and confirm. We all agree. Taz does his best to turn the ship to aim dead between the two suns, says, "OK, here goes!" - and flies straight in.

We push through the boundary.

This is a vivid Wildspace - the opposite of Guildspace. Brighter than Toril. It has a streaked, watercolour look - but curiously, it seems to have areas that look "wrong" - tampered with, artificial. The impression is of age; debris, remnants floating. There's a planet to the left, closer to a brighter, larger - or at least *closer* sun; Gnog says based on the scroll, "That must be it" - somehow, aiming between the two brought us closer in to the larger sun (which otherwise, given unknown distances, we couldn't necessarily tell - the visually larger might just be closer).

Taz checks the orrery. Confirmed. There's another, smaller planet much further out orbiting the other star but it doesn't fit the description of Amonkhet. There's a moon orbiting Amonkhet too - unexpected - along with two asteroid debris fields, one a ring but with one particularly large cluster at one end; the other is a debris field, spread out between the two stars.

Taz is able to plot an avoidance course to avoid the worst of both - we don't want constantly slowing down by gravity plane interference. We *will* need to pass through part of the ring belt but in a thin area. We might have to slow down for that.

Fee-Ree goes back to sleep and Taz continues for four hours at best possible speed to Amonkhet. A little over three hours into this, we drop out of fast travel because we're too close to the asteroids; the orrery indicates maybe 4 hours of fast travel at most to Amonkhet.

Gnog and Deni will have been up for about 16 hours by the end of this shift, so we have to be careful.

Taz asks Gnog if we should fly quickly through, or spend an hour flying around the asteroids. Gnog figures if anyone is out here waiting to pounce on ships, they'd do it in the belt, so recommends the fly-around; we'll have to sleep on arrival. We could risk a fly-through but have no idea what's waiting. Gnog, perception 28. We're past the half way point, then has a moment of panic; a reflection, a glint, clearly metal, in the asteroid field. He looks closer; spyglass; a ship. Small. Wasp perhaps. Curiosity gets the better of him. Asks Taz to direct flight towards it & keeps watching in the spyglass. It's certainly not hidden - just floating next to an asteroid. Closer up, we see some damage, scratches along one side. There's a name; "Intrepid". Sounds like explorers, no visible crew. Drifting. We're a good 800ft away. Feels like bait! Gnog scans other asteroids and we fly a spiral course rather than directly in. Nothing. We get close. No crew, no lights. Gnog decides not to risk air bubble mixing - the air on the ship may be stale - so rage-flies over instead. Just Gnog to start with, Deni watching closely.

The air is indeed stale, but not foul. Smells old. He lands on the weapon deck and pokes his head down into the cargo deck. Some supplies here - odd, not raided. A bed roll! Just the one. There's a bag next to the bed roll. Gnog waves at Deni, to show "it's OK", then drops into the hold to check the bag. Investigation 13. Oops! Forgot to check for traps - but - none. A waterskin, pens and ink, two journals, some old rations, fully rotten now. Gnog takes the journals and leaves the rest behind, but rolls up the bed roll feeling somehow that maybe that's respectful and leaves it rolled, with bag beside, tidily in the cargo hold; he figures he's *just* got time to check the Helm, so looks inside. There's a coffee table! Two chairs, nothing on the table except a small book; grabs that too; the spelljamming helm is present. Small, pretty, tulip-shaped, cushions; a small, well-loved teddy bear.

Perception check of the helm, 17. As Gnog approaches, he notices that where the teddy bear lay is clean underneath but everything else is covered with a layer of dust. The helm is only attached to the ship by a thin stalk that he thinks he could uncouple. It's worth the risk. He pops back up, flies up with rage nearly out, then arranges for Taz to bring the ships to air bubble contact and drop a rope. The air quality drops inevitably but we're OK.

Taz comes over to help. Gnog and he go back on a rope, get the teddy, the book, and detach the helm. With Taz's help, Gnog adv Arcana plus two additional -> 21. Gnog ties the helm to the rope, then uses the helm to anchor the rope base on this gravity plane. Now he and Taz can use the rope as a rail to get back to our ship, then Gnog can pull in the helm - ready to catch it when it "falls" into our plane. Athl nat 20!+11 -> 31. Gnog just grabs it, one handed, and gently lowers it.

He tells and shows Deni what he found. The language in the journals is unknown. Taz will have to translate when he next has time. A strange thing to find; the implication of maybe a father-daughter explorer team, lost somewhere, is distressing. We don't think we should hang around here to find out who did this! Taz guns it to Amonkhet.

We get close. Fee-Ree wakes. "Wow! We're close. Where are we going to land?"

We think a while. Taz knows some of the terrain outside the city, from the dream. If we assume they can see out of the magical barrier but we can't see in, is he able to plot a route to bring us down along the surface, low, landing as close as possible but behind cover; dunes, rocks, or similar?

Taz has to first figure out where things are on the globe. There is some idea of how the city has ruins near it, a river - from the dream, and a sketch on the scroll - nearby; we believe it's close to equatorial. It's very difficult, of course, on the scale we're considering. Taz shows a minor illusion from the dream - the giant dune, the wall against it, shimmering and in particular, the curves of the river as it approached across the landscape. He asks Gnog to help look for that, with the spyglass, while he flies a low-as-he-dares (orbital) course along what he thinks from the orrery and observation is equatorial - but we don't know what N or S would be on that planet yet. Gnog, no advantage, natural 19+9 perception; it takes a good three hours circling but Gnog identifies four possible locations.

It's strange. No dark side. The side close to the orbited sun is of course brighter; the other is a little less bright.

We know there were significant nearby city ruins, which narrows this down to two locations - a bit more guesswork there. Interestingly, the two are not that far apart, probably about a five hour flight time apart. We're at the edge of exhaustion, and we pick one - the closer - and come down in the ruins, a distance away from what *would* be the hidden city, if it's there!

Taz perception 18. He spots a location where he can bring the ship down in between two ruined structures, partly submerged by sand dunes. It's not hidden, but you'd have to be lucky and looking to see us. That'll have to do. Taz brings the ship down. It's on the dimmer side.

It is as brightly lit here, even on the dimmer side, as mid to late evening on Toril. We have no choice but to long rest; Fee-Ree takes first watch, Deni, Gnog and Taz last. At we can sleep in the hold as it's dark - but hot. It's difficult to sleep - we're all "jet lagged" from ship shifts, it's hot and bright outside and we start our shifts at the equivalent of midday on Ravnica time.

2 hour shifts each. Perception:

* Fee-Ree nat 20!
* Deni 15+8 -> 23
* Gnog 19+9 -> 28
* Taz 18+3 -> 21

"Morning" is Ravnican 8pm. We all gather on the top deck. In the sky now are two suns, one low on the horizon, one fairly high - the brighter of the two. Even after 8 hours, despite the dim sun having been low on the horizon before, it's still low on the horizon.

We start off trying to verify the location. We elect to lift off in the ship but fly very low, knowing that there's a huge dune near the hidden wall, a distance from but tracking the river, trying to keep the big dune between us and what *might* be the magical city wall.

Taz navigation 18, he is able to skirt over the dunes, keeping low. Fee-Ree watches away from the river, Deni watches towards it, Gnog uses the spyglass to watch ahead, but doesn't see any telltale "shimmer"; but the big dune is in the way. 40 minutes later we're at its base; it is a large, towering range. Taz scans for a place to set down. Part is very smooth, steep and no good. Another area has what might be a rock outcrop - or a hidden old ruined building? - so he tries to set down on that. There's space on top but it's very exposed to anyone in the desert who might look, so he risks trying the harder landing underneath the outcrop in its partial shadow. Dex-based navigation, Taz, 11+10->21. He slows down and at the last minute spins to strafe it in sideways; it lands with a bit of a scrape and with a lean as the ship settles into some sand on one side. We seem stable, so Gnog asks Fee-Ree and Taz to stay on board and guard the ship for a moment, while he and Deni have to climb to the apex and see what we can see.

Deni's red leather outfit is helping her from the heat. Her Cloak of Elvenkind keeps her hidden well. Nonedescript natural colours.

Gnog has no such benefits. He might have to rely on his constitution rather heavily for the heat. He was in his Gruul kit on the ship and wanted to stay in it for temperature, but Deni points out it's far too obvious - especially the metal buckles - so he finds a light beige blanket in the bag of holding, and uses it as a cape to keep off the sun - from behind, it'll hide him.

As soon as we step out, we realise the sand is hot. Not burning but definitely hot. The air itself is warm. Everything is just hot and dry - it reminds us of the smell and heat when we first got to the beseiged P4 boundary bulwark wall.

We start the climb. Gnog brute-forces it; athl. 19; Deni hops up acrobatically, light and agile. She's ahead and stops now and then to look around. It takes about five minutes to get to the top - less than we expected perhaps - until we're about 20ft from the top, and at that point we drop to hands and knees. It's steep - easier to go up than down perhaps! - feels like the sand here could 'avalanche' easily - quite vertiginous. The wind up there is blowing up the hill; we were on the lee side. We can see sand flicking up off the top of the dune. Deni drops her goggles; Gnog has to shield his eyes and says he'll rely on the spyglass up there to keep one eye shut and one open.

Gnog perception 15. Weird. We can see an alleyway and building. A building and someone in a white tunic and a headdress pushing someone else along, other people running behind another building, hiding in the alleyway. Gnog follows with the spyglass. They run along a second alley and dart into a building, shutting a door. Gnog tries to squint against the sand without the spyglass for a wider field of view. The river stretches out into a bend that looks about right. Low walls in front, **then a city; fully visible; not hidden at all.**

Deni - "wait - isn't - what - shouldn't this be hidden?!"

Gnog can't quite figure out how we missed this from space, even up high. Was it hidden earlier and how revealed? Are we inside its mirror wall on this high dune? Gnog perception adv 28. The colour of the city is the same colour as the sand, more or less. It's quite sympathetic to the curves of the river too, and perhaps that's why we didn't see it? But one small part really stands out as different - a big temple on the river. But this isn't the lush haven that Taz described in his dream. There's vegetation here and there but it all looks dead. Almost no trees. Definitely Naktamun though - that big temple is flanked in an oval almost by 5 smaller temples - and the big one has the Bolas horns atop it. And there is the portal! Gnog gets the spyglass and - unbelievably - **can see right through to Ravnica**. There's a huge assembly ground in front, crawling with undead.

He's suddenly gripped by a sense of disorientation, worry, almost fear and rolls back and down a little, away from the edge. "Fuck. I can see Ravnica. We need to get back to the others and come up with a plan."

Deni suddenly notices a shimmer - the city disappears from view; but there are gaps, especially at the temples; then it comes back. Deni suggests that Bolas is doing here what Niv almost did 7 years ago on Ravnica - pulling all that's left of magic and energy to push the bridge across and either because of that, or because the magic of the bridge interfering, either way, it's caused that invisibility shield to fail. As for the trees - we have to assume the vision of Taz was from some time ago perhaps? Maybe it's died off since?

Gnog gathers himself and rolls back up. The shimmer of the river from up here is quite beautiful but once you look closer, especially around the bend by and through the city, is shimmering not with water but with Lazotep Eternals. There must be hundreds of thousands crammed in. Well - certainly *lots*. Covering at least half the city, once we start looking more closely. The Dreadhorde is everywhere. But we saw some people scurrying around - it seems some non-undead are acting as enforcers; but others are hiding; not everyone here is quite dead yet, it seems.

We have to work on the assumption of some kind of underground, else we'll never make it to the big temple. But how do we even get down there? Invisibility, the river, what? The river, at least, takes us into an almost literal sea of undead but we could peel away early. Or we just climb down and slide, but we'll visible; if we were invisible, we could kick sand ahead and try to make it look like a natural sand slide perhaps.

We retreat to the ship and tell the others. It gives us sand dune descent practice at least! Barely over a minute to get back down. And we realise, too, that thinking positively - if we succeed - we have to escape; and we're parked up on this big hill, hard to get up it on the visible side, hard to get around it and hard to get up to the ship either way. But if we keep a fly or a portal spell. Fee-Ree isn't using the horned staff much so stows it in the bag of holding and says she'll take the helm attunement, so Taz transfers it; and if Taz gets the chance, he'll re-attune to his dulcimer.

600ft dune, roughly; ship at 300ft; so 100m, in metric. And wide, long, only really navigable around the edge at the river, stretching in the other way for at least a mile. So from the city, we either go up and over - probably very visible - the long way around via river, but less visible; or if we're a spare teleport, do that. And then fly out without being shot down!

We get rocks, sand, anything we can find around to cover as much of the ship up as we can and make it look less reflective. Any blankets or tarps in the bag of holding are used for this if dull in colour and held down with rocks; it's an attempt to camoflage it. Risky but we don't have a choice.

So, first thing: Deni can stealth down; Taz can use minor illusion of sand; and he'll use the MA to cast Inv on Fee-Ree and Gnog. He does that now; so stand back everyone... No problem. 

Up we go - climb back to the apex, then make like a small sand avalanche, Gnog describing the place we're aiming for - the alleyways where people were hiding. They didn't seem on board with whatever was going on in their city!

Taz says quietly as we descend, "It looks wrong. Where are the gardens? It is tired, worn down... Fighting, destruction, damage. It wasn't like this."

We make it down almost to the bottom of the dune, but then our descent is stopped by flat roofs of buildings apparently built into the bottom of dunes. Stables? Gnog whispers, "Deni, see what those are - can we drop down in front of them?" - so she lowers herself down to the side - "empty, but they smell. Stables?" and so we drop down too. Many rows of these stables. In front, a city wall. Taz remembers that the shimmering mirage dome; but it's not here. Only remnants are visible here and there. Wisps of colour, like transient aurora.

Gnog elects to climb - the 30ft tall wall has decorations and towers that make tying off the Rope Of Climbing easy enough. In knotted form it's an easy reach. Deni heads up easily. Fee-Ree: Athl adv., OK; Taz looks up at Gnog and clears his throat - football time! - Gnog athl adv 28, no problem. Crouched on top, we see we can drop the rope onto a veranda of a nearby building and so descend there, because the *rope* is not invisible so the less we climb the better.

We quickly drop down.

Parkour! A few short easy jumps on rooftops until we're away from the wall and looking at a main road; cut-throughs to alleyways beyond. Flat roofs everywhere make it easy to keep high. Quite a lot of buildings seem to store things up here, but most houses here seem abandoned. Things left on top but just left. It reminds Gnog of P4 after evacuation, when we emerged into the bakery.

Gnog perception, 19+9 (28), another high roll. We shrink back - a patrol is marching along the streets. Eternals. Looking over the roofs, he sees one accessible via an alleyway ladder; this building does *not* look abandoned. Food is being dried on mats on top. A couple of large jars that are intact. It looks intact and "recent". As his eye gets into it, he spots more of these, dotted around. Infrequent but not all are abandoned.

We have to try and get across the road. We climb down the side here, into the side alley, watch closely and when clear, run across the main street. In doing this we notice more occupied buildings; we're not the only ones sneaking around! We're invisible, or Deni, or Taz looking like bits of wall! We get across to the opposite alleyway and contemplating climbing up the ladder to the "in use" roof when, running along, are four people, very quick; the open a door and run inside, shutting it behind.

There's probably pursuit so we quickly head up the ladder. Gnog pretty much throws Taz up there; but athl check is just 4; he falls and Gnog catches him - dex save 17; Gnog's athl check is 25. Fee-Ree invisible behind is fine. We're *almost* up when we see, around the corner, more people running. Guards in pursuit. These are strange. White, folded headdresses, Eternal armour but white tunics and robes included - and human. They're alive. One has a crook, another a sickle; "Find them! Find those dissidents!" - doors are smashed open; we're up on the ladder; they smash open the door underneath and we hear screaming from inside as more guards appear. "WE FOUND THEIR HIDING PLACE!" shouts the guard.

Gnog says, "If want friends, this is the way - game time!", rages and jumps! Not invisible now. Deni summersaults down. Taz finds himself in the melee as Gnog's holding him! Fee-Ree is up on the ladder still.

**Initiative!**

* Gnog: 21
* Deni: 17
* Fee-Ree: 11
* Taz: 8

Gnog jump-flies over the group of soldiers to try and block their exit - an opportunity attack from one missing (who looks a bit like the undead hoplites Gnog saw before, complete with spear) - landing behind one and recklessly attacking twice, hitting for 18 and 15 damage, realising that Ajani's axe isn't so great against the living; these are *not* undead; he should've considered the claymore! This one is in full plate, rather than just a tunic and shield like the other three.

Another hoplite-like guard, next to the one Gnog just attacked, but has leather armour. He turns and attacks Gnog. It's close, especially with from-reckless-advantage, but both miss. One near Fee-Ree, below her on the ladder, moves to attack Deni and hits twice out of three attacks; 5 and 4 damage.

The armoured guard that was hit by Gnog turns and says, "Why are you attacking the holy army?!" - maul raised - and Gnog says, "There's nothing holy about being fooled by false god Nicol Bolas!" "I know no Nicol Bolas. Yield and get out of our way! We are here to arrest dissidents!" "I think not!" "Then you shall the God Pharoah's holy fire!" - he raises his maul and causes down a blazing flame; DC15 wisdom saving but Gnog feels the axe helping; maybe not such a bad weapon after all! The holiness of the axe helps him resist. Gnog takes 16->8->4; and Gnog is not blinded by this bright holy strike. Yikes. Now the maul is brought to bear; just misses, hit. 7->3 bludgeoning + 10->5 radiant, so 8 overall. Maybe worth wings next time! With a bonus action, the creature touches a huge cartouche on its chest and calls to the God Pharoah for protection - he heals for 12hp.

Deni's boxed into a corner a bit and has to concentrate on the guard immediately in front of her. She pulls out her dirk and tries to get insight on the aggressor, succeeding; she attacks, dealing 11 + 12d6 (!) -> 36 (exactly half) - 47 total; the guard is still up, but very injured. The one adjacent, in front of Taz, turns to attack Deni too. Hit and wings can't save that; miss; hit, and this *can* be saved with wings so alongside, Taz throws up protection. She dodges that first one, only taking 4.

Fee-Ree is still on the ladder. She's still invisible, too. She throws a firebolt (4d10, now), with advantage as nobody has seen her yet. She tries to take out the "hoplite" closest to Deni, hitting for 20 damage. It falls. She uses 2 sorcery points to speed up a spell, too, so she can throw another firebolt, no advantage now but hitting also, the other "hoplite" next to Deni and in front of Taz. 24 damage.

Taz can see the armoured guy and hoplite in front of him, but can't the last one just around a corner of a building. Casts L3 Hold Person on them, Wis 19 saves. Annoyingly the armoured guy saves (with a nat 20 no less), but at least the hoplite in front fails. So, no immediate threat. Taz figures the armoured guy must be some kind of priest - given the radiant damage - so these are holy people? Huh? They are completely fooled by Bolas. Presumably, Bolas is "God Pharoah", given Bolas' faintly ridiculous adornments. Bardic inspiration to Gnog.

Gnog continues his reckless attack - hits twice, 18 and 9 to the priest-armour-guy. Gnog says, "God Pharoah?! That just the dragon, Nicol Bolas - he's no God, but he certainly wants to be!" "BLASPHEMY! You - you are dissidents as well! We shall take you to the sarcophagus and cast out into the desert to your deaths."

The hoplite next to him attacks Gnog once more. Miss, miss. He's having a bad day.

The war priest now acts again. Rather than attacking Gnog, he turns and dispels Taz's Hold Person spell. Gnog is pretty sure he hears a distant muttered "shit" in Taz's voice - is that the first time Taz has sworn? Picking up bad habits from Gnog - then the priest heals that hoplite for 12.

Deni tries for insight on the recently-healed hoplite, succeeding again. She attacks and would crit miss, but uses her (real, advantage) inspiration; a hit! Main damage only 8, but sneak is a whopping 53. 61 damage! The hoplite is very dead. Deni sheaths the Dirk.

Fee-Ree - still on the ladder! - twins firebolt; hit on the war priest, hit on the remaining leather armoured hoplite. 26 to the priest, 22 to the hoplite. The war priest is at least looking at bit beaten up now.

Taz has clear line of sight to the priest and throws eldritch blasts. Miss, hit, miss - rolls a 2, uses real inspiration, rolls another 2 FFS! - but at least the one hit does decent damage, 13. He doesn't want to move much but does throw a bit of bardic inspiration at Deni - she took down two of his hoplites, so might be a target of the priest soon.

Gnog's reckless assault continues. 1 and 1! miss; he hasn't got the hang of this heavy axe, clearly; swears loudly; but hits the second time, for 17.

The hoplite attacks back, but it's another two misses! At least Gnog hasn't had *that* kind of luck.

In desperation, the war priest looks at Deni and Taz and calls down a flame strike; it'll hit Fee-Ree too. Tax dex save 21, Fee-Ree saves too, Deni *just* makes it. 4d6 fire and 4d6 radiant, with Deni and Fee-Ree already resistant to fire; 11->5 fire (so 2 for Deni and Fee-Ree), and 16->8 radiant. Then it tries to run away; Gnog swings for Sentinel with bardic inspiration - he's hit. 4 damage from thunder (fails con save) and a very high 19 damage. The priest falls! The nearby hoplite is the last man standing and also takes 4 thunder damage.

Deni tries for insight on that hoplite - crit! - so, successful; she pulls the longbow and attacks. Hits, 11 + 49 - it falls. The moment it goes down, less than 20 seconds after the fight had started, we see heads poking out of doors and windows; they look at us, looking confused; Gnog says, "A little help hiding these guys maybe?!" "No, we must bring them inside and tie them up!" "Oh! The curse!" - they come out and drag them bodies inside. Some younger people - a woman and a boy come out with rags to clean the blood off the flagstone and Taz helps with Prestidigitation, which surprises them.

We are ushered inside. They ask for our help and open a trap door under a carpet. Gnog is considering chopping them up and putting them into those bigs jars on the roof (!) but they insist - no, we must embalm them.

Below, is an old, weak looking woman in dirty clothing that looks rather like priests clothing. She bears the scars of many old injuries. She starts rituals on the bodies; as she does this Taz continues Prestidigitation on her clothing, cleaning it up.

One of the people approaches Gnog and asks our names. We explain and talk about being from another world; the one being attacked through the gate. They're confused at first - it's not paradise?! - and then realise that their theories of being dissidents were correct, as the conversation continues.

The priestess finishes up and hands over the last of her work. "There is much we must speak of. There is much you know that we do not, and much we know to support what *you* are missing."

We head up into the main building again, the priestess checking carefully first. "Orisa! Is it wise to show yourself above ground?" asks one of the fighters we saw earlier. "Wise? Perhaps not! But necessary." She opens an old, somewhat damaged cupboard and grabs various shawls - off-white linen - hands them to us. "Cover yourselves. We go to the roof". She does the same.

There are internal stone stairs, no need for the ladder. There's a second storey, then a roof. We crouch up there, hiding amongst the big jars. Linen is drying here which helps further.

Orisa says, "Stranger from another world. Look. Look out on here. This used to be paradise. Little did we know that we had our own version here, but so besotted were we with the promise of *eternal* paradise in the afterlife, that Naktamun was lost. Lost, to the teachings of the Five who follow the God Pharoah - this Nicol Bolas that you speak of. Some of us realised, years ago, that the teachings have been corrupted. But it was very difficult for us to comprehend, for you see our Gods walk amongst us. Do yours?" "No. Not usually!" "Yes. So, we do not deny their existence, of course not; and they are powerful; but they call us dissidents - we rejected the Trials, we rejected what we were being told. We denied and doubted that they were just gods. They *were* gods, no denying that, we simply didn't believe they were teaching justice and truth. The Trials were barbaric. They pitted Naktamun against Naktamun - brother against sister - husband against wife - mother against daughter. We knew in our hearts, this could not be right! So we *questioned*. We sought to understand where these teachings were coming from; we would enter their temples; we sought out lost ancient knowledge in the fallen cities of the desert; and we found things. Three years ago, we found things that confirmed our greatest fears... But none would listen to us. None. And although our teachings spread, dissidents are rounded up and shipped out, exiled into the desert, placed into the Tomb of the Unbelievers. Did you come from the desert?"

It turns out we managed to miss this Tomb - hundreds of dissidents still live, having reclaimed the tomb and turned it into a kind of camp. The few that remain are the eyes and ears in the city. "We want Naktamun back - but there are... I never asked you. I apologise. An old woman loses her manners and her ways sometimes! What is it you are here for? I never asked you."

Gnog explains about closing the gate. Part way through, Taz insight 30. She becomes crestfallen. Taz asks, "We do not know why your five gods follow Bolas. But if gate is closed, we intend to defeat him on our world; he could not return here to threaten you further; what troubles you?" "Ah, young friend... I loved Amonkhet. I loved Naktamun. I've lived a good life and I am ready to go. But there are so many of our young that will never know; it seems this world is lost... They believe they are pushing through to paradise; we know that is not the whole truth. We suspected that it wasn't the whole truth. But much has happened since then, which has cemented that, at least for us - but you see - we are doomed. You see, the Eternals - our one hope was that whatever was happening with that gate, that the Eternal army would march through it and we would reclaim our world. But we cannot condemn yours to destruction."

Gnog sinks back onto the ground, deflated. An impossible choice.

She continues. "Our world has been dying for aeons. I'm glad I saw some of its beauty here at the end. But... Those younger than I and with more will to fight, and more strength, may have other thoughts. It is not over yet for them. You should seek them out in the desert, but know that they *will* resist the plan in its raw form - for there are those amongst the dissidents that wish to rescue, to reclaim Naktamun. We have some fortune on our side... I should not speak more of it. We can provide you a guide to get to **Samut** - she will tell you more. She leads us."

Gnog can't give false hope. An impossible choice. Maybe we could return with weapons to help destroy the Eternals; if it works and if it can be moved; but the magic of this plane seems to be failing. How long can they survive?

The shield around the city - the Hekma - is failing; the protectors of it stand steadfast we're told, avowed to protect Naktamun. "They hold the wild undead of the desert at bay. Those lost, who wander the nightless desert. Why the Eternals will not defend us, I don't know; but they are all on the *other* side of the river. They fill the pyramids. They fill *all* the levels under the pyramids within and under.

We learn that five of their gods didn't all fall - one held fast - she's with Samut. **Hazaret** still lives. So we surmise the others are undead Gods now; a strange concept.

She has a sense of great loss, but love. We can see the others are fighters, fighting for survival. Orisa isn't - she's noble and believes what she's saying, she can kinda see the future here. We start to head down.

Gnog can see that. "I cannot really comprehend the scale of your loss. But hundreds have survived in the desert without the Hekma. One God still stands. Where there is life there is hope, though change is inevitable. And if it came to it, if Amonkhet fell, there are other worlds. I would see you live a new life in the paradise of Toril, if you'd have it; or Ravnica; it's not home, but it's a new start, especially for the young - if only they can hold out somewhere, long enough for evacuation ships to arrive, once everything else is done."

Once down, Orisa makes up a story about what we're here for - to attack the God Pharoah's temple - to keep the fighters excited. She gets a book from a shelf. Very well loved, quite large. She opens it. "This is what I would like to remember. Maybe I can take Naktamun with me?" - it's really a kid's picture book, but beautiful - "Naktamun - The Jewel On Luxa". Gnog says, "Again, I cannot comprehend the scale of the loss you must feel; but yes, there are ways - if your people survive, your world survives in their memories and their stories. If you all fall here, it will truly be lost."

It's about 10pm Ravnican equivalent, we're two hours into our waking day. It's the "quiet period" for Amonkhet, since they have always someone awake and tend to measure cycles from the larger sun rising.

**We thank Orisa, try to keep her spirits up because even if Amonkhet falls, she does not need to fall with it; and greet the guide that'll take us to Samut. It's a teenage boy.**

"It is a day's walk into the desert". Deni asks if he can show us the way from the air? Good plan; take up the Navigator. "From the air? Umm... Do you have a carpet?" "Something like that." "Huh! I see. Well, uuh, yes! Yes, I could! Yes, of course, I'm pretty sure..." and one of the older fighters reminds us, "Beware the Avens" - flying, but alive people. "They do not take well to things traversing their realm, especially since the Locust God invaded it."

We explain that our 'carpet' is parked on the other side of the giant dune. "Ah, the giant of the Hekma" - he knows a way under, via old tunnels. We're advised to keep our veils on. Be packs up various things, including a vial; drinks some water; "Right, we're ready to go!" Gnog responds, "Let's do it!"

Taz walks up to Orisa. "Thank you." He holds her hand briefly, then turns quickly, drawing the shawl over so we he hides his face. Gnog knows, though. He heard the quaver in the voice.

Lookouts give us the all-clear and we duck out. A small yellow hankerchief outside flicks back and forth on the ledge of the rooftop. "Right! Across the road, run!" says the boy and we run over. A lookout on the roof has clearly signalled safety. Various alleyways; a building, inside, and we're asked to wait a moment. He runs ahead. Deni sends her mouse along to keep an eye on him. A minute or so later he comes back and ushers us along a corridor, up stairs, another corridor, hacienda-style with open arches on one side, then down stairs again. The boy does more checking (and Deni assists this time with the mouse). We dash out, another alleyway and sharp turn, another, left, right - Gnog hopes Deni is keeping track of this! - to an old shed-like building with rounded sides. A rusted lock, which needs a bit of brute force that the teenager lacks so Gnog helps (athl 25). A square staircase inside headed down; tunnels.

Gnog lights up the axe and keeps at the back to avoid blinding everyone. Taz is up front since he has blindvision so can see well ahead. There's a surprising sense of dampness; are we near the river or something? Doesn't seem like the right location but Gnog's a bit spun around. Stonework eventually changes - walls are no longer lined with stone, becoming packed earth with wood holding up some sections. It angles upwards, scrambling; small collapse, we can work around; then in rock, fissures that have been widened, so a much less straight path but still fast going. We pop out onto a flatter section with some light ahead from a hole higher up. The kid scrambles up, again bit cool and damp here - definitely not the river, then - even some small water pools we think, because we can hear dripping and trickling below. We follow and end up in a small wind-carved cavern, open to the sun outside. Gnog survival 26; it takes eyes a moment to adjust to the brightness. We're on a different section of jutting out rock, not far from where the ship was! 150ft maybe? Gnog leads the way along; these aren't snow-covered rock mountains, they're sand-covered - not all that different from back home!

We reach the Navigator. Still there! Phew. The kid is astonished at this strange contraption. We pull off and stow the various hiding blankets, keeping the rocks on board for reuse, dust of *some* of the sand but not all - good camouflage. Fee-Ree hands the helm back to Taz. Gnog asks the kid to point the way; that done, he pokes he his head down to the helm deck and lets Taz know the landmarks that the kid pointed out. The orrery isn't useful so Taz has to eyeball it. Lift-off is hair raising, in the cramped conditions and slight lean from the soft sand, then spin around and head out.

Taz navigation - excellent roll, 19+10 - Taz is very clear on where to go. It's *much* faster than on foot; we reach there in a little over an hour, not day! Taz hugs the ground; no aerial attacks.

Just after midnight Ravnican.



## Day 56 (Ravnica 36, Riglan 92 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Friday (7 day week)

(Four hours awake).

We're flying to meet Samut. We're reached ruins of a beautiful temple with a cat in the front, kinda like a sphinx but the face is different. There's a hovering pyramid top of sorts, but some bits have topped.

Taz asks where we should put the ship down. "Well they've not been attacked by the Eternals out this way - but we're close to Iphnir - got to be careful about some of the soul stingers, manitcores, occasional demon... Maybe - do you think you could land on *that*?" - he points at part of the top of a tall pyramid nearby that seems to have slid off and landed, providing a flat, raised, defendable surface but we can climb down. It's exposed though. We'll just have to do our best to cover it up. "We can" says Taz "but is there anywhere a bit more hidden?" and the kid suggests flying around to the other side of the temple, where that might be a hall we could slide into. It's there; apparently, a market hall once. Grand stone doorway (faded with age and damage). *Just* big enough to thread into. Navigation 21 - *just* get inside. Easy to land within that; Taz rotates for a quick getaway and sets down. We reuse the rocks and blanks to hide the silver paint etc. - kid helps - and disembark. Takes about 10 minutes.

00:30 Ravnican, 4.5 hours awake.

We're advised to stow weapons. Just like being back in Precinct One! Done.

The kid leads us down to sand; the desert has reclaimed a city here, with maybe a dozen sizeable buildings visible above and presumably many more buried below. We reach an area with a very large opening, sand having poured into it. The kid just slides down the slope, very nimble; we follow. We drop down what must be at least one floor inside before the dune levels out to flatter sand. Shafts of light from huge high windows; sand all over the floor. It would've once been, we think, a very grand, beautiful temple, 30-40 ft high vaulted ceilings. There are even faded remnants of paintings.

We see some armoured people marching up hurriedly as we slide in, weapons in hand. The kid throws back his shawl, says words in a language we don't understand; things are calmed down; he tells them our names (after asking for them again!). Then he switches to Common. "We come from Orisa. I deliver them. They're from the world on the other side of the gate!" and the guard attitude changes immediately.

We are invited to follow and asked why we're here. "We seek Samut, at Orisa's behest."

We reach an area with tents; there are even some small buildings inside this building, all apparently part of this camp now.

(Gnog notes in the back of his mind - wait, yes. Common again. Even on this strange world... How is this possible? Humans too.)

As the word spreads that we're here to see Samut, we seem to pick up people. Much interest is being generated. News spreads quickly! The kid is liking the attention and embellishing the stories of us more and more.

At the back of the temple are old corridors that lead us down to an area without sand, apparently cleared out. We can see the sand above is a good 5 foot deep. Perhaps this cleared out area would've been priest's quarters once. Doorways and walls are trapezoid, varying heights. We reach what looks like it would've been a pool of water, perhaps communal; and there, in that room, is a strong-looking woman in a particularly dark skin tone, almost as dark as Kaya, deep olive, recently-healed scars/gashes visible all over; hair is long and tied back with an impression of "I've no time to deal with this!" - wearing white, apparently proudly, with some of the same beautiful adornments that the Eternal undead priests have. A little confronting in a way. Underneath that though are glimpses of red and khaki tunic.

She turns and greets our guide; speaking in the same unrecognised language as before. He turns to us, says something, then she says, "I'm Samut. You're looking for me, I understand. You're from off-world, yes?" "Yes" "And you carry the spark!" and looks to Fee-Ree. A moment of silence, then "...Yes, yes I do - as do *you!*" - and that catches us all by surprise. Samut says, "Yes, mine ignited during the hours... Ah, you do not know about the Hours." (We assume, capitalised Hours, then.) "No" "Do you have time to listen to this?" "Your history could be important." "Right... This happened in the last tenday; this is what the entire planet was waiting on, well, Naktamun anyway. The Hours of promise. The coming of the second sun, the God Pharoah's return, the opening of the gates to paradise. The Hours. The Hour of Promise is what we were told! I saw through it during my Trials; I was known as Samut The Dissident. These are the people who, like me, have been cast out, for speaking truth to power. But *never* in a thousand lifetimes could we have foreseen the betrayal at the Hours - what should have been a moment of elation, everything that this very pious society has been working towards for decades - maybe longer? - was a lie. The Luxa ran red. The demon Razoketh emerged, released the three Forgotten Gods, who killed our Gods - it became the **Hour Of Devastation**. Five hours, where things progressively got more and more catastrophic. We have names for them - each of those hours. But perhaps I will tell you some other day. Enough about us. WHY have you come to seek me? Why have you come here? How did you know? Has... I have so many questions! I have only met five others with the Spark."

(The original Gatewatch).

We explain. It's a difficult conversation. Their betrayal is hard to fathom; their countrymen, sisters, brothers, convinced to die in Trials for a lie.

She agrees to assemble the Generals. If we feel we are ready, at least; we'll need to speak from the heart - and to do so Gnog will have to not be cold. To touch the emotions he's holding at bay. He's asking them to lay down arms and die... Gnog says that he'd sooner see them evacuated, to a new world; she falls silent and Gnog can't quite figure out what she was trying to convey (insight 2+3).

Deni tugs at Gnog's sleeve. "Yes, Deni? Sorry..." "She doesn't believe you'll succeed. She doesn't believe you'll convince them." "Should we find Gideon first, have him at our side?" "I don't know. She wasn't reacting positively to anything you were saying at all."

Over the next ten minutes or so, four people come together. They gather in one of the larger rooms and Samut introduces us and gives some background.
 
* Gnog tries to explain the history with Ravnica
* Tries to be emotionally open
* Gets to the crux of it
* Not well received! Two are almost immediately out
* We keep talking - it's about knowing *them*
* The other two convince the first to at least explain what they're trying to do
* Raise an army, regain Naktamun, but only possible if most of the Eternals are gone
* In the end Samut steps in, and it helps - she hints at another way - the generals agree to think, perhaps for a day, which is time we can ill afford but have no choice
* After all that is done, we're told Gideon "the hermit" is in the ruins of Ifnir, about 1.5 days walk (so about 1.5-2h flight) but it'd be rude to leave right now; we must wait, help them get to know us, help us to get to know them.

Gnog says to Samut, "Well you were right - we weren't exactly successful - but perhaps between their minds and ours, we might come up with a better plan than either had previously. Who knows. We shall see."

### 2200 XP - gifted half to Taz, so 1100 each + 5500 to Taz -> LEVEL 14

We're eyed up - "probably not used to living like we do!" - they offer a small room, perhaps once an alcove of some kind, but large. Trapezoid door. We can stay there. No closing doors anywhere though. The floor is stone, too; rather than even sand.

We take a moment, to just sort of decompress a bit and set up bed rolls, for sake of something to do before we head out and try to mingle. Almost like at an awkward party. Everyone notices Gnog is moving slower and slower, as if delaying; then he sits heavily on the bed roll, sighs, looks up with a very strange expression.

"I think - I mean - what - You might think I've lost my mind. You might want to part company with me now, or at least, violently disagree. All of that would make sense. But I thought about things and there was this cascade which I could not stop, like an avalanche, which led me to a very difficult conclusion..."

* Gnog realised if it were swapped he might not give up Toril - be unable to see it as lost, hold onto some hope
* Besides are we really THAT sure that Bolas would return here? There's almost nothing left. It might actually just endure, until it finally fades away.
* We are talking about hundreds or thousands of lives for millions. Once, we balked at just one. How have we changed this much? Bolas.
* If our worlds lived, if we defeated him but the cost was sacrificing this world, then Bolas' dark hand would be at the centre of our survival. We would forever have based it on what might be seen an attempt at emotional blackmail or coercion.
* Gnog needs to see Samut / the Generals. If his party disagrees he will not, but otherwise - **he thinks we have to withdraw our request**. He is making a decision on behalf of millions - billions? More? - but even if Bolas prevails, millennia from now, balance will somehow restore; it always does; and new worlds will rise, from purity, not from a dark sacrifice.
* It isn't our place to sacrifice Ravnica or other worlds. But it isn't our place to sacrifice Amonkhet either. We cannot and must not ask this of them, and we must find another way - or fall - at Ravnica.

It's like making a decision on behalf of countless people either way, without the authority to do so, with nobody having chosen you or voted for you for the task; but the decision is to be made anyway, and we're the only ones here.

Deni says she's better at fighting an enemy; but she can also see when things are not right. Us and the Generals are not on good terms, but are acting nobly because they have a moral purpose which is nothing to do with gods. Even in this time of desperation they've not given into savagery. Maybe they can help see a solution we cannot. So, she concurs.

Fee-Ree points out that we're not asking to sacrifice them - to give up on Ravnica. Just because we were given one option, in Ravnica, does not mean that *has* to be the option that we force upon other people. That's what we thought in the absence of *any* knowledge; but we're here now, on another world. It would be foolish - so foolish of us to think that the plan made on Ravnica is still the only plan. We do somehow have to shut that gate... But everything else is up for discussion.

Taz says: "I once asked you not to let what happened here happen on Ravnica. I understand what you say. Perhaps there is a way to save some of Amonkhet first. Or perhaps it is right to save Amonkhet alone."

Gnog just says, "Damn Samut - for telling me to let the emotions in."

We can speak to the generals. They're here, in the complex, so we can see them and learn what they're doing. Who they are. Who is around them. Sincerely, to help... In the way that we got to know Ravnicans.

Gnog stands. "I value your council more than you might ever know" - and heads out the door, assuming the others will follow, looking for any of the generals.

Gnog looks around in the main temple area, initially just to get a feel for what's going on - perception 19. Small groups of people are training with corpeches (scimitars), Samut amongst them, training with them. In another area to the left, large tents where injured and elderly people are - not a hospital tent, but it's a resting place. A large food pit with clay overs provides food for the many people. A high area, too, with water carried up, harvested food carried down - green - we assume elevated gardens with access to sunlight, manually maintained. A microcosm of Natkamun.

One of the generals is visible, with a group of able-bodied but older adults who seem to be building something. They're clearing an area and building something. Some kind of guard posts are set up here and there; another general - one of the less favourable ones - is there, with some patrol people. A patrol comes back, injured; the general drops everything to head over. Taz heads over and is saying something we can't hear - he's offering help; Deni runs to catch up so we follow.

"...have some healing magic, would that be of use?" The general answers: "Oh. You would waste healing magic?" "On the injured - that is what it is for." Medicine 12, one of them has a necrotic wound; it *can* be healed, but if it isn't, it'll worsen. Taz looks closer and says, "yes, especially for that - it will be difficult to heal naturally, likely to worsen, but should respond to magic. Sir, what caused this?" (he asks the injured person). "We wondered past the normal patrol boundaries; we encountered a Soulstinger scorpion - a demon maybe? They seem more numerous since The Hours. Something has brought them out of the desert." The general says, "They'll whittle down our defences if we let them. They must be coming from somewhere nearby..."

Taz casts L1 Healing Word for d4+5 -> 3+5 -> 8 points. Medicine check, higher, 22. The wound has shut but the flesh is diseased - it has been infected by whatever this sting has. He  realises he'll need Lesser Restoration, which he can cast without risk via the mizzium apparatus. It glows LED blue, then Taz channels, mixing his cyan and greens, which forms a kind of halo; the wound closes and heals. The solider stands, astonished. "I am not touched by death!" thanking Taz. "We have no need of the gods!" Taz laughs and says, "Do not consider my meagre skills anything even close to godhood; they have more power than any of us can imagine." "But those who wield these powers have always gotten them from worship of the gods. It's easy to lose hope when your belief in your gods ends". Taz nods, and says, "This is true. But you do have at least one who *is* true - you can trust in Hazaret." "She hasn't been here to see us in a little while."

Gnog says to the general - "I made requests. And those were a mistake. I am very worried about other worlds, but spent nowhere near enough time being worried about this one. We talked, our group, and withdraw our request unconditionally. We would like to help you *here* - perhaps, as  a start, given the lethal nature of this injury without magic, searching for the source of these scorpions may be of help?"

"You would head into a desert you do not know to help strangers? Then perhaps I have misjudged you."

Gnog answers "You listened to us, and despite our crazy requests and strange demands and lack of understanding, even you, one of the most sceptical, still listened. And what's more, you offered us shelter. You are no longer strangers."

"It is our way. We would offer shelter, even to an enemy. In our culture, enemies are not absolute - brother may disagree with brother, but they rarely disagree about everything. There is always common ground. And they are, after all, still brothers. Hatred is a flame that needs fuel. It needs to be stoked. That is our belief."

Gnog laughs, "then I may be enemy or friend! So be it! But *we* have that in common. In our culture, it is often black and white - but not always."

The general advises that we do not travel at peak heat, as Samut did. He offers to come and bring four to show the way. We agree.

The general says, "When the shaft of the crane reaches the far wall, it will be safe to go" (and we can see drawings / etchings on the walls; one is of a crane, near a huge window with a shaft of light). Gnog nods - "I understand." "You can find me here, at the entrance."

We wander off. We think about Hazaret; is it unusual to not see this god for a couple of days? We ask around, ending up chatting in the cooking area, Fee-Ree assisting after a while. In Naktamun, it would be. They live amongst the citizens. Hazaret has a special meaning of the guards - it was her role and duty to assist in maintenance of the Hekma. She looked *outward*, giving a perspective at a time when it mattered. She resisted and managed to break free of influence; dissidents talked to her to ask what was going on, and in the process of that cast enough doubt in her mind. One in particular had come through - a blue wizard - who lifted a broken memory. (That sounds like Jace). That's when Hazaret realised that they (the gods) had been corrupted - someone - the God Pharoah - had implanted fake memories into them, subverted them and convinced them that they were gods of things they were not. Made them neglect their own domains. The original domains were noble, but had been twisted to serve the Trials.

The priests did the embalming, to protect from Curse Of The Wandering. It meant that they rose as Eternals, keeping their skills from life. They're not just zombies! They're powerful, disciplined, regimented; champions of trials, with intelligence and capability. In many ways that's worse. Do they know what they were? Are they aware of what they are doing, or being made to do? Gnog hopes he never finds out.

Where does Hazaret normally reside? Meditates and thinks - in the mountains nearby. Not the sand dune, the actual mountain (a solitary mountain nearby, but not near the city).

"Some say that she is seeking the old sphinxes, asking them for help. They are some of the oldest still living denizens of this world. It is believed some live in that mountain - at least a small colony, but they did not come to help us during the Hours and we do not know why. Some of our people will never forgive them for that; they were once worshipped as the equal of Gods. There are even still some original angels, it is said - not ones corrupted by the God Pharoah's lies."

We check in on the general **Ghariab** who was building something. He was the most calm and understanding seeming. Same thing; apologies and withdrawal of request. Offer of help.

"I am often accused of being the slow one! But by the same token I feel that my fellow generals - especially **Kharras** - are too led by their hearts. Too fast to act. Good in battle but perhaps a bit rash. They judged you too quickly. But their concerns are not unfounded. So I think you for your level head and calm, thoughtful reply."

To help with the clearing and building ("but it's menial work" says the general), Deni starts a ritual to create Tensor's Floating Disk. Gnog strength check nat 19+5, and he can drop all his pack kit to move a great deal of material. Taz plays quiet music. Deni and Fee-Ree help with the magic and cleaning. **It's tiring but rewarding; tangible, permanent, makes a difference Gnog can** *see*. After about 45 minutes, a whole section of the temple floor has been cleared. Everyone is tired but happy.

Taz has had the opportunity to talk and gain insight. Persuasion: 29, insight: 15 (with BFS). Taz is asking good questions and digging quite deeply. The general was *in* Naktamun during the Hours Of Devastation, in between the temples, right in the heart of it. He was one of the later ones to 'defect' - "for my eyes to be opened to the lie". He was part of the royal guard. He had to kill some of his colleagues to escape; they were doing bidding of the God Pharoah, blindly, throwing people to their deaths. The general ended up trying to help some dissidents out of the city and conflict was inevitable, but very sad.

He saw the first of the Eternals emerge from the pyramids and cross the Luxa. They moved as he's never seen an army move - no audible communication yet entirely coordinated. He thinks it all comes down to their general. **Liliana**. She directs and controls the entire army. "Like any army, if you cut the serpent off at the head, the rest will writhe and convulse - but it *will* eventually stop."

**Kharras**, we learn, is in the hanging gardens. She was the first to turn away from us before. So I guess that's our next house call and we start making our way up there. The gardens... Have soil, somehow. There is a meagre amount but soil, nonetheless, in large reed baskets. little packed balls wrapped in husk, with plants growing out of them. They're planted in rows, hanging - tied with string, strung up, so that water can easily be caught and reused if it drips through, rather than disappearing into the sand. Kharras is planting things.

As we approach she looks up and we get a bad look. "This is my happy place" look. Again, the apology; retraction of request. "It is our way of life I seek to protect. It is very fragile. This is a harsh landscape; we have nurtured love and art and music. I am none of those things - I am a fighter. I am strength, I am rage, I am fury - but I do this to protect all of it. The musicians and artists and dancers and growers and painters of our kingdom. Those who make life worth living." Taz plays a single chord; Gnog says, "I also rage. And I also do it to protect. If we have perhaps nothing else in common, we certainly have that."

She talks about being uncertain, except in her rage; Gnog seems so certain and confident. Gnog, of course, is full of doubts. She asks if he's grown things. She recommends he does and gives an impassioned speech showing her deep interest.

We talk about magic and draw. She was on the top of the temple when the Hours started. She wanted to attack and break the Blood Diamonds that were siphoning the magic of the Hekma away and dooming her people. She'd infiltrated in, reached the top; but she could not reach the diamonds to destroy them. The diamonds are what opened the gate. It is what keeps it open. As long as they are active the Hekma has no hope of reestablishing itself and the magic of their world continues to drain. She doesn't know for sure if it could reestablish after, either, but it's got to be worth a try.

More understandings. Perhaps they will fight alongside each other one day. Gnog vows to grow something one day, on Toril.

She's told us of **Manesh**, the vizier general; the last to "open his eyes"; used to be a high priest. He's at the healing tents. We proceed there. An airy structure; soft bedding, the only that we've seen. Goat hides, furs, reeds; mats woven from palm fronds. Scented oils and smelly poultices; liquids of all kinds brewing. Taz medicine check Nat 20+3, all herbal medicines; some ease pain, others fortify; none *heal* though. They do help to purify - stave off further infection, stave off exhaustion, nourish, some counteract poisons.

Manesh is there, dressed the most plainly of the four generals. Very plain clothes, sandy brown linen shirt with a rope belt. Given he used to be a high priest, we were told - this is clearly a reaction. Wispy hair, balding, but long. Various small bags and a satchel hanging off the belt.

Gnog approaches. The same pattern - apology, retraction, offer of help, wanting to understand; he tries to word it differently each time, to avoid sounding trite or practiced. He finishes up what he's doing first, then - "Will you walk with me?" Manesh asks. "Certainly."

We walk. He takes us towards the entrance. "I remember when I arrived here. When Kharras had dragged me, stupified, through the desert; she kept me alive until I got here. I was in a daze. I remember walking in here - or was I carried? - past that threshold, thinking to myself that my whole world had ended." He points around. "In the last week, I have learned - I have learned that this planet, Amonkhet, this land - had many legends and gods. Many beautiful stories. Good cities. We stand in a temple, which was a temple for another city once; and they worshipped the god of cranes and frogs. These gods, we don't know them; where are they? Where have they gone?" He recites the pantheon that he knows. "I was the high priest. I was to lead the ritual. We were elated. Our hearts were filled with joy. All our sages had calculated to that very day. They knew that the second sun would rise, right in the middle, in between the wings of the God Pharoah, arching up into the sky, at the apex of the grandest temple in the land. The procession, the flowers, the dancers, the music; all the people of Naktamun gathered to witness the promised opening of the gates of heaven. Pious, we were; we had done everything that we had been instructed to do. Endured the Trials, broken families; all in the name of good and righteousness and purity and justice - in truth, knowledge, zeal..."

He looks to the floor. "The hour arrived. It was to be *my* hour of absolute glory. I was the leader of the pantheons of the temples; the gods themselves had gathered to witness my proclamation. I still remember as the sun shone upon my face and I invoked the rites, the Hour Of Promise. The ground shook - I thought it was my knees going weak! Then I heard screaming; and.... Fire. Fire erupted through the horns, the horns of the God Pharoah. They weren't wings! A portal opened. Demons crawled forth; beings of pure fire and shadow and darkness; the Luxa ran red; all of the fish in the river floated up dead; pestilence; then the arrival of the Locust God, the Scarab God and the Scorpion God, towering over Kefnet, Ketra, Rhonas; Razzoketh, the demon, bursting through and demolishing the garden pyramids. The marketplace, the march of champions, all of it... I saw my whole world falling into flames. These demons, devouring and ripping apart my people. What was this promise?! I - I... Then I remember Kharras grabbing hold of me as I wept and pulling me away. Why was she there? She was a dissident - *I* am a dissident - maybe we aren't. Maybe we are the only ones who know the truth."

He looks around. "So. Who were these gods? What happened to these people? what will happen to *our* people? I must atone for what I have done. I must not fail this world. Maybe we can find a path together. You wish to save your world. I wish to save mine."

Gnog wipes away tears. "Yes. We save both."

"They believed me. I do not deserve..." - Gnog interrupts, "...No. They believed a false God, Nicol Bolas, the so-called God Pharoah. Decades, possibly centuries of planning and work; likely before you were even born; your life, from start to now, part of his plan and design. Nobody could be blamed for that. Some saw through it. A precious few. Some saw early, some saw late; you saw late, but you still realised it was a lie. There are others, in the city right now, who still follow faith; somehow, despite everything, they fight for Bolas."

"I must overcome my fear and guilt to atone. I must don my robes and my crown again and speak to them - if they will still hear me."

"I think they might. They are probably just scared; leaderless; unsure; relying on dogma in the absence of instruction. And your guilt is strength - we all carry it, greater or lesser, from our mistakes; it's how we learn. It's not pleasant, but it seems to be how it works. What can *we* do, to help you atone?"

"I would follow any assault in, when the army marches to Naktamun. Let me go with the vanguard; let me prepare the city, prepare the city - this time, for something true and honourable and just. Something worth fighting and living and dying for. Not merely walking into sacrifice."

We talk about the pyramids with the Eternal army within.

"Plans for pyramids are in Oketra's Temple; perhaps studying those might provide a way to collapse them or block them - but that is not enough. The army must be made inert or it'll dig its way out. If it could be made inert and left buried, across the Luxa, they would not threaten Naktamun."

A crazy plan?

* Close the gate. Liliana's comms magic can't work without that physical connection. No trans-planar communication spells, right?
* Collapse the pyramids.
* Fight the remainder.

To test this - a pocket dimension? Trap an eternal, see what happens? Gideon or the sphinxes could do it.

Only 02:30 Ravnican, 6.5 hours awake. There's a siesta of sorts; we choose to rest; we estimate 1.5 hours until it's time to tackle scorpions.

We join in with the siesta. Fee-Ree and Taz chat and they decide to head back to the Navigator and exchange the helm attunement; it takes about 30 minutes, so we have an hour. We short-rest. Taz re-attunes to the dulcimer. Fee-Ree is going to have fun flying out of the tight entryway where the Navigator is parked!

Taz plays the Song Of Rest to help us with healing.

### TAZ TO L14, takes Skill Expert on Investigation & Constitution

Gnog is digging around in the bag of holding, trying to remind himself what's in there. He pulls out a clay statue. It's from the art class. "Oh. I guess that place doesn't exist anymore... I wonder what happened to the three precogs?" - we might never know. He finds what he's looking for anyway; a gem encrusted bowl from a long time ago, related to something Taz talked about a while back.

Out of nowhere in this moment, Gnog remembers his silly, strange, but very real-feeling day dream, on the steps of the Chamber just before Jace arrived. Full of errors and inconsistencies. The horror, though, of the moment the front of the ship was crushed by a massive rock slab, killing Taz; Fee-Ree was struck by falling debris and lying, dying, on the deck; trying to shelter Deni as the roof fell. A sharp intake of breath, inadvertent; hands gripping into fists; face twisted in the pain of the memory. It can't go unnoticed. He takes a moment, recovers; "just... Trauma. I know you feel these things too. Moments of bad memory. It will take us a long, long time to heal from this - but heal we shall. Remembering how important you are to me. And I think, these people need to be just as important to me, too. More so, maybe. The last of their kind, from a beautiful, ancient, rich civilisation. We are all worth saving. Anyone who values life, to the last soul. And with you to help guide me, we'll make sure we do not fall prey to Bolas' machinations; we will not sacrifice one for many. We will see through the chaos to solutions that save all. We will see what he cannot. Not because we are wise - because we are *wild*. I think Bolas is so clever that he cannot conceive of just how recklessly stupid a Goliath can be."

Only 04:00 Ravnican, 8 hours awake. It's time to tackle scorpions.

We head to the entrance. The general **Sutesh** and four guides are present, as promised. Greetings all round. We say that if any of us are struck by disease, we should do our best to hang on and get home, as we have magical means to counter such sickness, once the fight is over. As we prepare to leave, one of the guides heads off - then comes back with a giant lizard! "Cute", says Gnog, "what's their name?" - the lizard is to carry packs and bags - "...oh, it doesn't really have one?!" is the response. Over the next while Gnog works on-the-fly with his casting ritual to speak to the lizard. It's a bit fiddly so takes longer than normal but it occupies his mind during the walk.

The lizard tells Gnog that its name is **Binky**. Unexpected, but who knows what's standard for Amonkhet giant lizard names! He tells its handler, as Binky says they - it's one of those neither male-nor-female lizard, the kind that can change - would quite like to be addressed by name. The handler looks sceptical, but Gnog asks Binky what the handler normally gives them for food, then tells the handler back; Gnog says he's obviously not seen the feeding, and presents this as evidence that he really *can* speak to the lizard... Still sceptical LOL

It's very hot, but only a single sun is visible. Gnog thinks we're travelling North, more or less. Con saves for Gnog and Taz with no fire resistance; Gnog is OK. Taz's transparent casing panels just soak up the sun like a greenhouse and he heats up internally, but the shawl we're wearing helps a lot with that and with BFS he *just* scrapes the save, matching the DC (15).

Dideryus' Euer comes in handy. Our own party has various protections but the general and guides don't; we only can protect 4 so the general insists the poison protection is given to the guides.

About 45 minutes out, we past a waypoint. The guides tell us to wait a while; they make some checks to figure out the correct direction to go next, based on the waypoint landmark. The second sun has risen; the first sun is low on the horizon. Shadows are very strange, almost missing from the opposing sun positions. The guides finally figure it out; they point out two dunes that we should head between - Gnog perception 17, he can't quite see them - hard to distinguish one from another! - so we just follow with crossed fingers.

We claim and follow a ridge for another half hour or so; the climb is hard but once on the ridge it's much quicker. In the distance is a shimmer; what looks like the remains of an oasis as we get close. Built around it, remnants of a settlement. Parts are now submerged in sand. There must still be some water; it looks almost boggy - wet sand - in places; things are trying to grow there. The tops of beautiful temples are visible; soon we realise we're looking at the edge of what once must have been a sprawling city, not just some small settlement. It stretches as far as Gnog an see once he has his eye into it, so that's at least a mile, maybe two; beyond that it could be dunes or covered buildings, hard to say.

The guides say that the trackers followed a Soulstinger this far, then turned back. "We believe they are in there. This was one of the trading cities of the Kingdom of Ifnir."

Gnog tries to track. Survival, dirty 20. There is a certain logic to the flow of sand, in the sense of possible pathways; things settled not by wind, not smooth, maybe rutted or indented, as if trodden upon, with some meandering. It looks like it'll descend into a building. That must be it. So he points this out, and with caution we proceed. The guides continue to take the lead - but at this point Gnog says we should have a meat shield up front and takes the lead. The general warns, "keep your eyes and ears open - any disturbance in the sand is a sign of movement. We must walk deliberately slowly; slide if you can; instead of thumping. There are things that hear rhythmic movement through the dunes. Once we're in the temple it might be dark, which we are not used to..." "...we have light..." "...good; once inside keep your eyes on walls and ceiling - things can climb and hang!"

We slither our feet erratically and slowly, following in little sand falls we create. Gnog dex save with luck 3,4+4 (!) so only 8. He's slow, too heavy. Sinks into the sand. Taz *another* nat 1, for 4 total. So he has similar problems - and in the end Gnog carries him, and slowly, we end up behind the others instead of in front at the temple. Deni gets in front, but Fee-Ree isn't doing too well either! Goodness knows what our guides and general are thinking about the clowns that are theoretically here to help them defeat the scorpions...

It takes longer than it should, getting there a minute or so after the others (including Deni). She has her goggles on. Taz puts up dancing lights and Gnog has the axe light up, but this means he has to carry it. A strange temple, with kind of six-sided corridors. Gnog survival 22. Recent activity here. The ground is disturbed - no wind reaching here to hide it.

* Slithering indications
* Large clawed feet
* Conical shaped deep indentation, maybe a foot deep

He quietly points those the guides. The conical - scorpions. Clawed feet? Unusual - only crocodiles have feet like that! We may encounter them - from the water in the oasis maybe? There may be water down here? They get excited at that. The slithering - snakes. *Big* snakes. Other general footprints that are harder to understand. Scouts perhaps? If not, prepare for wandering undead.

Gnog gets a bit paranoid as we proceed slowly - passive perception 19 - skittering sounds; glimpses of shadow on the wall that seem to move; not helped by the movement of the light as we carry the sources. He checks in with Deni and Taz, asking them to keep a particular eye on the roof since he's finding it hard. Taz's 120ft darkvision and high investigation roll - "large scarab beetles", he says, "a little off-putting - large swarms, moving together". At this the guides tell us that if we see things on the *ceiling* we should tell them, so that we can try to avoid them. Individually they are not too dangerous but in swarms they can devour flesh!

We think we're probably going through what was once a grand entrance to some kind of great hall. This doesn't seem to be a temple now, since we've seen no statues, carvings or paintings that we might have expected from the others we've seen on this world. The general speculates that animals and caravans might normally have pulled in here - an entrance to a larger complex - and true enough, soon we get to an amphitheatre style set of steps that descend to an even larger, grander area, a pyramidal shape. Off each side of the square base, walkways on pillars rise. One has totally collapsed with sand. One other is partly filled with sand but on the third, there's a visible hallway that can be accessed.

The walls have writing. The guides say we have two choices. The partly blocked one would lead to the "temple plaza". We could push past the sand but the lizard would need to stay behind. The clearer hallway is to the "pools of learning". Gnog tries to see if different tracks go different places - survival 17. A few of the human-like tracks and slithering seem to go to the temple, but the rest, the pools - so he chooses the route to the pools. The "easy way", hmm.

There's a strangely brightly lit area ahead - a shaft of light has broken through in a crumbled area which has stayed free of sand. It's much easier to see the tracks here and they're definitely the scorpions. We've only been in here about 5-10 minutes; we see a once-beautiful, multi-zoned complex ahead, opening out, some submerged in sand and some not. There are various pools here, some empty and dry, with sand; others further away look more muddy, water and sand - and maybe even soil. About 18 of them stretch out. They're all rectangular with steps. The guides get excited. Water! The general grabs one that starts to rush forward. Gnog says quietly, "If there's water there are monsters hiding!"

Taz is able to swing the lights around in clumps, lighting to left, right and front, at the maximum 120ft away from us; like a searchlight, over the pools. They're in rows of 3, stretching back 6. The first row closest are empty and dry. To the right there's sand mounded from a breach in the walls. Second row similar. At limit of reach, the third row; a bit of water there. On the right, again mixed with sand, a shoreline effect.

We see no immediate threat left/right for a short distance so move forward a way, to get a view of the third row and beyond. Slithering. Things burrowing into the sand. Gnog mentions it. Crabs? Strange. Very obvious snake tracks too. Occasional crocodile prints. No conical prints. So where did the scorpions go? The stone areas make it harder to tell; but this leans Gnog to thinking that the left hand pools deserve the closer scrutiny - sand on the right would give them away.

It's possible to see that the room drops away, falling lower, row by row; the furthest pools look to be completely submerged, just visible by outline under the water and by pillar positions. Closer, at the fourth and fifth set of pools, there's water on the left - but it's strange; dark, black, reflecting the light; on the right, sand, but less of it. The far corner is clear. So Gnog says, "If they're here, they must be close; that dark water would be a good hiding place!" - perception only 15. He *thinks* he sees ripples. Hard to tell. We've moved forward to the second row of pools by now and can see between the 4th and 5th row on the left, the higher ground, there's a large entranceway - truncated pyramidal. Gnog says, "Or in there? That opening? But there's definitely *something* in the water - could be the snakes or crocodiles?" - we have to get closer, bringing the lights closer to the water, to get a better look at the revealed entranceway. Third row. Water in the pools, water to the right as the room slopes off down that way. One pool to the left on the *fourth* row is full but outlined in stone clearly; in the middle, it's overflowing towards the one on the right. Shallow enough in this case to see via lights that some is only about a foot deep in that fourth row.

The entranceway is large. A grand hallway, planters - or decorative urns? - on the side, beginnings of carvings of figures. Must be important. The far end of the pool room is now just in view; muddy and submerged. Whatever used to draw water from the oasis presumably long since failed and now the whole area is submerged at a flat level, rather than once perhaps pumped somehow in cascades.

Gnog perception 20+9. Just in the nick of time, a slight reflection as Taz moves lights over the water to the right hand pools - we have a moment to react. The glinting of pairs of eyes. Hovering at the water's surface. **Crocodiles**. They're about 30ft away, coming at us!

Initiative:

* Taz 21 (his 120ft darkvision and the fact he's moving the lights mean he sees it first)
* Fee-Ree 17
* Gnog adv only 12
* Deni 10 (the googles make the glint harder to spot amongst the gain they provide for other dim light or darkness)

Taz notices further, jumping out of a pool nearby, two other creatures - two Ammits, not crocodiles (not that we know that, until the guides shout the names). They look kind of like *huge* (3x3) bears with dinosaur-style crocodile heads. Taz goes, "Oh dear, they are considerably larger than I expected..." - perception 16; he sees them coming, *not* crocodiles, not people either. He foregoes big spells in favour of Eldritch Blast at the nearest. All three hit - 13, 15 and 10 damage, good to excellent rolls on all counts. He throws bardic inspiration at the General, who is facing down the two crocodiles and retreats a little.

The guides and guard form up to face down the two approaching crocodiles to our right.

The nearby Ammit hit by Taz swims up and launches itself out of the water, ending up right in Taz, Fee-Ree and Gnog's face. Taz didn't retreat far enough. The sand under its feet sinks quickly as water is squeezed out. It attacks - the first is a bit attempt at Taz, but Taz avoids it; the tail whips around, aiming for a guide behind it - hits, and the guide is knocked prone and takes some damage but seems OK for now.

Fee-Ree is in melee with the Ammit along with Taz and Gnog; she tries Shocking Grasp, dealing 4d8->24, high damage; but it seems to be affected less than she expects - "Lightning's not great!" she shouts. It's shocked, at least, so she's able to back away.

Falling from the ceiling to Gnog's left - a long spine, no flesh, a snake - Gnog recognises this, a bone naga. It's blocking the corridor we saw, that goes deeper in. It's been drawn by the noise. It looks at the nearby Deni, Fee-Ree and Gnog. It tries to cast Hold Person - Deni is within Ajani's axe's aura of protection. Adv wisdom saving; 18; makes the save. She resists. The bone naga now calls some kind of sacred flame, a flare of radiant energy flaring out and hitting Deni directly. Dex save, again adv., and although caught off guard (3+11) *just* makes it, taking no damage.

Gnog perception very high, 27. He can see more movement in the water beyond. He shouts, "There are two more; the Ammits; the huge ones. We might need to focus on that doorway out of here and get past the snake thing, we're wasting energy on these others!" and rages. Given that the Ammit nearby is already badly injured he figures it's worth a try to take that down at least and swings; the first hits, the axe flaring with bright radiant light for a big 19 damage plus a bright flare - this must be a fiend or demon? - doing a high additional 16 damage. 35 total. Surprisingly, the Ammit crumbles into dust. "Gotcha!" shouts Gnog and runs over to the bone naga, swinging again. He hits, for 18+9 damage, with another bright radiant flare. It's hard to look at when the weapon strikes - it leaves afterimages. The naga recoils, hissing.

Deni says, "Uuuh, we're not alone! Watch out - the far pool!" and emerging out are four skeletons - ghouls - floating behind, almost invisible, is a spirit. Gnog shouts back over his shoulder, "Everyone, beware that spirit! Possession risk!" and the general shouts back, "We're surrounded by undead!" - we surmise the crocodiles are undead, via the Curse of Wandering. Deni fails to get insight on the naga, so instead just fires without any advantage and *just* hits, for 13 + 31 -> 44. The naga is looking very rough.

The ghouls start to march forward, towards the naga and Gnog. Another Ammit swims up, crashes up and lands behind Gnog too. He's getting a bit surrounded; it tries to bite and grapple him; advantage, but misses. The tail whips around, *just* missing. *Another* comes forward, getting very close to the guides and Taz. Floating through the air, the spectre; Taz religion dirty 20 - "That spectre is some kind of banshee..." - and materialises. Taz wisdom saving, 23; he avoids being frightened, fortunately. "Don't look at it!" he shouts.

The remaining Ammit dashes up and gets *very* close to the general and guides. Taz casts L4 psychic lance at it to try and defend them. Int save DC19, can't possibly make it. Fails. Only 19 damage, low rolls; stunned until Taz's next turn. Throws bardic at Gnog too.

The group of guides and general are now up and engaged with the creatures around them. For a moment, there are just the two undead crocodiles. One is being held down by the general which blocks the other, forcing it to slide around and emerge behind the group. The guides turn to face it, now back-to-back two rows deep, attacking them as best they can.

Fee-Ree shouts, "Sorry everyone, I have to do this... Lightning didn't work but fire might!" and throws a L4 fireball into the middle of the Ammits, leaving the ghouls and spectre alone for now. 9d6. 1 sorcery point blown on a reroll of 1&2 yielding 2&6. A good 37 damage potential, no wild magic surges. With a 19 DC and -1 dex, the Ammits need to roll a 20 to succeed and none do - so all 3 take 37.

The naga is close to falling, but not down yet. It rears back, opens its mouth and some strange fetid air emanates and surrounds Gnog. It's attempted to level a curse. Wisdom saving adv -> 24, the curse doesn't take effect. Lucky as the curse's effect would've been quite debilitating. Gnog responds by swinging recklessly the naga. 20 damage is more than enough; the naga falls. Gnog shouts, "Door's open, if we want it!", turns around and swings at the Ammit behind him. Crit! It's a crazy hit, **57 damage**! Perhaps not top of the pile, but certainly up there as one of the heaviest Gnog's ever dealt. The weapon flare is impossible to look at and Gnog has to look away quickly. The Ammit is seared into dust immediately. He runs up to get close to the ghouls, but has to stop a bit short due to the sinking sand nearby.

Deni sees that the guides and general are quite surrounded. The way out is clear; she shouts, "Gnog, they can't escape! I have to help them!" "Of course! We must!"

She does insightful fighting against the most threatening Ammit, succeeding. She fires; hits for d8+9->11 + 11 + 32 -> 54 damage. That's enough! It falls. She moves closer to Gnog to get within the aura, but still has a good line of sight on the guides and General.

Ghouls surround Gnog. One attacks Deni from behind, rather than Gnog; it hits for 23, Gnog's too far to use wings; 7 slashing, and she risks paralysis; she can't make the con. save and is frozen. Gnog reacts with Sentinel; hits for 26, the ghoul falls, but it's too late for Deni.

Another attacks Gnog, hitting for 8->4, con save 25, no problem; the other ghoul misses.

The banshee screams. Con saves all round, DC13. Deni, Fee-Ree, Gnog, not Taz - immune to it, technically a Construct - one of the guides too, the had been knocked prone earlier. Gnog is fine. Fee-Ree too. Deni fails; she drops to zero hit points and is unconscious. The rest of us take 2 psychic damage, guide included.

(How the fuck do we fight the scorpions now?! Where even *are* they?)

The stunned Ammit can't do anything. Taz sees Deni down but can't both heal and restore from paralysis. He casts L1 Healing Word for 8 points at Deni, shouts "I'll fix the paralysis in a moment" then fires blasts at the banshee. He hits three times, for max 15, max 15 and 10 damage. The general and guides take down both undead crocodiles. An angry Fee-Ree twins Firebolt. One is thrown at banshee, the other at the remaining Ammit. Hits both. 4d10 -> banshee 22. The banshee goes down. The Ammit, a hefty 29 - it drops too.

Gnog swings at the ghoul to his left, recklessly; 22, not a huge hit but the ghoul falls. To his right, same deal; hits for 23, this time, so again, that one drops too. He runs to Deni. Taz uses the mandolin for L3 Cure Wounds, 17hp, it's a start. She tries a Superior potion from her pouch, Gnog helping; 32, she's about half way. She also tries a Greater, for 12. The spectral wings ability gives her 9. Taz does Mass Healing Word for all of the guides and general, plus Deni; 2d4 only rolls 3, total 8 for everyone. Finally, Fee-Ree uses her own healing gift to Cure Wounds Deni, which brings her up almost to full.

That'll do - we elect to get the hell out of here and head into the corridor, dancing lights leading the way.

### 2500XP split to Taz, 1250 each, 6250 for him

As we go, one of the guides starts reading and translating inscriptions on the walls. "Oh! Of course. That makes a lot of sense", he exclaims. What they'd been *told* Ifnir doesn't necessarily hold true. It was once a very pious and thoughtful nation. They'd been told they worshipped demons - but of course, it was all lies. The pools were pools of learning; they studied the heavens. They tracked positions of stars using reflections and pool positions. The pool positions might've looked a little chaotic - 6 rows of 3, but not regular - in fact had celestial meaning. The roof must've been able to be opened somehow to look at the sky.

The tunnel we are in leads towards "halls of study"; sounds like a library; the "temple of knowledge".

We are walking more slowly out of caution, examining ceilings and walls for danger and for inscriptions and other historical items. After 100ft or so, it opens up and there's water flowing along the sides - channels or canals. An *internal* irrigation or water supply system perhaps? A cross-junction arises. Shallow channels again, water flowing, only a few feet deep at most.

Gnog survival to try and figure out where to go - nat 20! + 9, 29. Three directions - ahead, left, right. Some of the stonework - looking very, very carefully - seems to indicate that both ahead, and the right hand tunnel, have small chips and marks that probably indicate scorpion feet. Either way. To the left, nothing. That's also the smallest passage, leading to the "temple of knowledge", apparently. Normally, the most interesting! Not today. The guide thinks from signs and indications that maybe directly in front, from a roof inscription, suggests - unsure - pits? Burrows? An upside down dome, or something. To the right, "halls of learning".

Pits or burrows sound more like something scorpions might hang out in. Halls may lead us deeper and deeper, so for now, we go straight ahead - cautiously and quietly.

This remains the largest passage. It widens a little, in fact, after 100ft or so, in terraces and steps. Each time it widens, there's a small gap between stone slabs, under which we can see water. It's like raised flagstones above water, with gaps. After the stepped, widening section, the slabs carry around the edges of a wide area, water channeling off elsewhere, with a large amphitheatre of sorts in the middle. Gnog perception 17. People would've gathered on the sides, watching something in the middle. He says, maybe fighting; Fee-Ree corrects him - a place of learning, more likely lectures. There's movement down there though. Taz swings the lights up and over.

A writhing mass in the centre... A raised dais in the dead centre *just* rises above the "moat", a sea of scorpions. Rising out of that, a few large stingers. **A nursery.** Worse still, on the centre dais, reacting to the light and turning our way - two things really quite scary. Scorpion-like, but somehow infernal. The upper torso and forearms of ashy, pustule-covered carapaces but in a humanoid-ish shape; head with horns curving up; wearing golden adornments. These aren't just the scorpion folk we learned of from the scroll; these are demonic or fiendish. Corruptions. **This nursery is attended.**

When one of the Soulstinger demons turns, we can see it was devouring a handful of the baby scorpions; the guides behind gasp and recoil; the general holds his ground. **Not a nursery? A farm!** The general says - "Soulstinger *demons*. The stories of nightmares" and holds his spear ready. Four giant scorpions rise and clatter our way. They're Large, 5-6 feet long; the demons are 7-8 feet long and taller, forearms ending in long stabby bones rather than pincers, that allow them to support their bodies upright to around 7ft height. Their stabby bones, though, can open like pincers; it's very strange.

Gnog responds, "it won't be an easy battle, but we'll be *their* nightmare once this is done!" trying to sound confident, while internally thinking, "shit shit shit SHIT".

Initiative:

* Taz 24 (he was guiding the lights and is quick to see the danger)
* Deni 17
* Gnog 13 (asleep at the wheel, Goliath)
* Fee-Ree 9

Taz knows our dance now. Sees the biggest danger, tries for it. Attempts his favourite - L4 Psychic Lance at the left-hand demon. The demon has magic resistance, so advantage on its DC19 saving throw with +5. The space is large and dark - dimly lit - thanks to Dancing Lights and Gnog's axe; not a lot of light. The demon saves with 21, but Fee-Ree tries to bend luck (2 sorcery points) - d4 -> 3 - *just* enough! Taz shouts a "thank you" having seen her intervention; damage is *once again* below half for this (what *is* it with Taz's damage or healing rolls the last while?!) at only 20, but it's incapacitated briefly. The damage, though, doesn't seem to have impacted it much. Hardy creatures. He shouts a warning to that effect. Bardic inspiration to Fee-Ree.

A giant scorpion gets up to Gnog. Its claws both miss. The stinger swings around; *just* misses. Deni looks around past Gnog to get a good look, sees the scorpion and while the demons beyond are tempting they're distant and hard to read in the dim light. She gains insight on the scorption and attacks with advantage, hitting for 34 + 12 + 15 -> 61. Good hit - the scorpion drops, falling away under the sea of smaller creatures. Knowing she'll have got the demon attention with that, she steps back a little.

Another giant scorpion rushes towards us, but can't quite reach at this time. The stinger is up and poised, ready to strike at anything going past (which Gnog will probably have to do in order to charge the demons). Speaking of demons, the uninjured one moves 40ft forward to the pit edge and seems to ready itself.

Gnog rages, giving his best battle roar at an attempt at intimidation and jump-flies over to the lead demon, flying high to avoid the stinger. The demon reacts with an attack. It looks like it'll hit *dead on* so Taz reacts quickly with Silvery Barbs. This deflects the worst of it and Gnog still takes a hit but it's not as bad - 11->5 piercing, 23->11 poison, con save crit! Wasted. 32. No problem from the poison!

Gnog attacks twice with the axe, recklessly. He hits twice - 25, 29, two decent damage rolls. Bright flashes of radiant light from the axe must look very dramatic to onlookers in this dark sapce! *This* visibly makes a difference.

Fee-Ree figures she can get a couple of scorpions and glance the demon engaged with Gnog using a fireball, so throws one at L5. Fancy. Potential damage is 10d6 -> a very high 46 (with four re-rolled via 1 sorcery point). Both of the giant scorpions fail to avoid it taking full damage and are still up, but only just. The demon is magic resistant and quite dexterous, but even that doesn't help; but it is *entirely immune* to fire, unbeknownst to Fee-Ree - her special abilities only bypass magic *resistance*. DAMN! "It's *entirely immune* to fire" she cries. That said, a huge number of the small scorpions in the basin are completely incinerated. The demon that was hit initially seems to laugh - but then in our minds - telepathic laughter! "Foolish mortal, you think you can touch me with fire?!" - but then it sees all the dead scorpions and is *very* angry.

The most distant giant scorpion makes a bee-line for Fee-Ree, but unwisely, it squeezes past its counterpart, right next to Gnog. Sentinel. He hits it, for 12; no radiant flash; that's enough - the fireball did most of the work - it tumbles down into the burning mess in that part of the pit. The other giant scorpion, however, is free to move unimpeded - it gets to Fee-Ree and attacks. WTF - both claws crit. Shit, shit, shit. Taz has used his reaction too. The stinger hits too; and it his too hard for any deflection by shield or wings. The damage will be really bad! Claws are 10, 18 bludgeoning; stinger is the bad part; and she's now grappled too; 10 piercing from the stinger; but she's immune to poison, thank goodness.

The last demon remains stunned. Taz can't waste time on the demon; instead, he throws eldritch blasts - all three on the one on Fee-Ree, because he knows he might well miss, they look naturally well armoured. Hits three times; damage rolls are low - 7, 6, 9 - but it's enough. Fee-Ree is freed. Bonus action, Gnog still is holding bardic inspiration from the last fight, so he gives it to Deni.

Deni reads the remaining giant scorpion; attacks, hits, 8+12+27 -> 47. It's still up. The scorpion comes straight at Deni in response. The claws miss, and even the stinger can't reach her - she twists and turns and avoids it.

The demon on Gnog attacks again. Despite advantage from Gnog's reckless attack both claws miss. The stinger hits. Gnog doesn't react - he's saving *that* for the other demon. 14-7 piercing, 16->8 poison, another nat 20 wasted on the con save. Gnog attacks back, recklessly again. He hits twice but much less damage - 18, but then 27, which is a bit better.

Fee-Ree is next to the scorpion attacking Deni. She's seen Gnog attacking; no radiant flashes from his axe; it's just a big beast. She attacks and hits with Shocking Grasp. 4d8->15 damage. Low, but enough; it falls. She calls, "Gnog - are you in trouble?" and Gnog shouts back a definitive "No", so she takes no further action; her spells would either be somewhat wasted, or cause damage to Gnog as well as the demon.

The most distant demon now finally acts. Gnog was holding a reaction to use Sentinel, but the other demon is cunning and flies slightly wide and high to avoid his reach - it must've seen him attack the other scorpion. Taz sees it and debates Psychic Lance briefly but it was a wing and a prayer last time, so instead, he just throws blasts and gets lucky - 3 good hits for a solid 9+13+11 damage. In turn, Deni gets a good read on the demon and attacks, hitting for 27+13+15 -> 55, not too bad. It looks pretty rough now.

Gnog's demon attacks again. Crit, Taz reacts with Silvery Barbs. Another Crit. Bonkers. 12->6 damage. Second hits for 12->6; the stinger misses. Gnog retaliates, and gets *just enough* to take it down - 28 and 16 damage. It crumples, lifeless, does not disintegrate but seems to smoulder from the inside. Gnog jump-flies to protect Fee-Ree, standing next to her, to be close to the remaining demon. "Oh, hello!" she says - "Told you I was all right ;-)". She can't quite reach the demon, as it's flying high, but realises that this means a ranged spell could work; so tries Chill Touch. Fire didn't work - maybe death will! It hits. 4d8 necrotic -> 1,1,2,7 -> 11 unfortunately. At least it's a hit. She buggers off, shouting "You're doing a great job!" over her shoulder, and Gnog hears Deni chuckling.

So, the demon attacks Gnog. The claws miss, and surprisingly the stinger misses. Taz was encouraged by his last attacks so blasts again. Crit fail, crit fail (FFS) and at last, a hit for 13 damage. Deni takes aim and fires; she hits, doing 14+8+39 -> 61 damage, which is far more than needed - arrow goes through the eye and head, gory - Gnog dex save with advantage, rolls 1 and 4 so only 10. Blood sprays out all over Gnog - it's the ichor - as the creature falls out of the sky and crumples into the pit. The acidic blood dissolves the small scorpions around. Gnog takes 8->4 acid damage. "Fucking hell Deni!"

Gnog looks around. "OK, good job, that surely isn't all of it - the other corridor..."

"Not yet" says Fee-Ree, producing flame - she wants to get rid of the scorpions in the pit. "There may be more hidden!" and of course, they all might grow up to attack the people in the temple. Taz joins in with eldritch blasts. The pit ends up completely clear - well, full of dead stuff, anyway. Gnog asks the guides and general if they'll come back undead. The guides go out and look around, finding oil. We pile the giant scorpions up and set a funeral pyre. They're burned to a crisp, along with the small ones. It takes a while - a good 20 minutes to clear everything completely.

### 3200XP divided 1600XP each and 8000XP to Taz.

We leave and head down the other corridor, which we think lead to the "halls of learning". There were plenty more scorpion marks on the floor going that way.

It reaches a series of smaller chambers that lead up on stairs from one chamber to the next. Many old books here, old and crumbled parchment. Looks like it was a library. Scroll cases, a few intact; we see a few book spines. If we have time, we might check more closely on the way out. A beautiful room up ahead, unusually with doors. Inscribed on the doors: Glyphs stating, "This is the heart of all wisdom and knowledge". It's been scratched through - vandalised - written over it, the guides translate, "Umbra". The heart of Umbra. Corruption, darkness. Gnog asks Deni to check for traps. Taz assists, looking for magical traps specifically; either arcana or investigation yield 27. Deni looks for physical traps; 21; no traps. The scratchings and overpainting are old. A condemnation, then; a statement of old, not recent. The room was perhaps once sealed but over time that's corroded and rotted away. Gnog opens the door.

It's a relatively small room given the other chambers we've been in recently - 30ft across, 40ft deep. Has a feel of "inner sanctum", or special hall for discussion. The walls are adorned with many scroll shelves and high drawings, maps and so-on. The ceiling is a dome with all kinds of drawings of movements of celestial bodies. In the middle, shaped a bit like a star, is a floor; two soulstinger demons turn to look at us; behind is an even more scary looking thing! An imposing, large - *thing*. A demon, a dragon, who knows; the best way to describe it would be, "what the fuck even *is* that"... The guides are gripped with fear. Two back away as if to flee, onecalling, **"It's true! The legend of the Archfiend Of Ifnir! It lives! It is real!"**

Initiative:

* Gnog 20
* Taz 20
* Deni 16
* Fee-Ree 9

Right away, one of the demons dashes forward getting to melee range with Deni, but fortunately she's ready and avoids all three attacks. Gnog rages and counterattacks (not reckless). First swing, crit! 49 damage total, too. Second hits too, for 23 damage. It's actually looking a bit rough already.

Taz sees the big bad. Probably intelligent, probably resistant; but he risks it; L4 psychic lance. A +9 on its roll! Sadly, it makes the save. Does take half damage; only 23 rolled -> 11 damage. In our heads, we hear a strange sound; it sounds kinda like thousands of locust wings; a droning; an abyssal guttural growl, and telepathic thoughts sending images:

- Slumber
- Ravenous hunger
- Glimpses of purity and light being consumed and pulled down to depths as if corrupted
- More hunger, insatiable now
- A glowing orange burning sunset backdrop, the city we're in - unburied, but aflame - the silhouette of Bolas' horns momentarily visible in the flams
- A cackling laughter, shrug, as it bats away the effects of Taz's spell.

Taz sees that Deni doesn't feel she has much choice - exasperated - draws her dirk. Insight on the demon nearby is successful; her attack almost misses; but bardic inspiration gets the win. The demon's constitution stops it taking any thunder damage via Taz's mote of potential, but she deals 9+12+34 -> 55 damage.

Another demon runs in and attacks Deni; the claws miss; the stinger would hit but Gnog reacts to give her a +6 on her AC, which deflects the blow. Gnog, Deni and Fee-Ree are all in melee with this new demon now; Gnog and Deni in melee with the first. The Archfiend is distant and unreachable - but we fear it won't have any trouble reaching *us* shortly. Fee-Ree has to use Shocking Grasp, but unfortunately it misses - even with Tides Of Chaos. Damn.

The Archfiend moves directly in front of Gnog. It rises up, its eyes shut - and in its place, about 400 eyes open in the air around it. Within each eye is a mouth with an eye and a mouth and so-on. Wisdom saving all round, but with advantage thanks to the axe (it's a hypnotic kind of magical emission). Gnog and Taz are OK, Fee-Ree too, Deni OK as well - much of this thanks to the advantages. We resist! It won't be able to affect us this way again.

It goes for a more traditional approach - and bites Gnog. It's a big-ass mouth. Would catch him, but this time Deni uses *her* wings - tit for tat! - and it misses; but now the claws come. Two conclusive hits. 19->9, 18->9.

The first demon continues trying to attack Deni first; a claw hits for 10; then the next goes for Gnog, who is now flanked - but misses; stinger reaches over to snap at Taz, about 10ft back! It misses though.

Gnog swings at the demon; holds his recklessness for now; hits, 23 damage, and that's enough. It burns up. Gnog has to turn attention to, and keep attention focused on himself from, the Archfiend so the next attack is there. Hits, for a middling 22.

Taz gives his last bardic to Deni, who's still quite harried; he then tries, given he's in melee, with his shortsword at the demon but misses (nat 2) sadly. Deni gets insight on that same demon and attacks with the dirk, hitting but for a quite low 9+7+25 -> 41. The demon attacks in turn, claws going to Deni (miss) and Fee-Ree (hit for 8), stinger misses Taz again though.

Fee-Ree knows that fire doesn't do much, but then just shouts, "Well, *fuck* this shit! Watch out Gnog, Deni - stand back!" (Gnog thinks he's teaching Fee-Ree bad language, as well as Taz...) - and then - BLAM! A sunbeam carves through both demon and Archfiend. It's crackling past the right ears of Deni and Gnog, inches away! Damage potential is only 22 for 6d8, bad roll. Con saves are with advantage - magic resistance - demon fails, Archfiend despite its huge constitution and advantage fails too. Shame the damage wasn't higher, but still, 44 total. And better - the demon is blinded; the archfiend has truesight but not blindsight - it *can* be blinded, so both are now disadvantaged on attack.

The disadvantaged, blinded archfiend bites at Gnog, but he deflects with the spectral wings. Both claws miss. Gnog attacks back, advantaged by its blindness. Hits for 26, 22. Gnog starts kinda chuckling. This is nuts and the fiend is super dangerous but he's somehow *enjoying* himself.

Taz tries to back away and risks an opportunity attack from the demon. In fact, he is still within stinger range so no attack is forthcoming; advantage due to demon's blindness; he hexblade's curses it and tries eldritch blasts -> +5 bonus on damage; hits for 15, crit for 20, hits for 16. 51 total!

Deni is still in melee with the demon, so continues the dirk - the demon also still blinded - hitting for a middling 48. That's enough, and the demon falls; the radiant attacks from the axe caused the various fiends Gnog killed off to crumble to dust, but this one's body remains intact - definitely dead though! She (just) gains insight on the Archfiend, for good measure.

Fee-Ree keeps the sunbeam up and blasts at the Archfiend again, which is just regaining its vision. Potential damage this time is 29. It makes the con save, but Fee-Ree risks 2 sorcery points to try and bend luck to fail it (needed 4 on d4), but it still succeeds. 14 damage, not blinded.

The archfiend *does* notice where this magic has been coming from! It moves around, staying in range of Deni and Gnog the whole time, to get in Fee-Ree's face; it attacks with its maw and would hit but Fee-Ree throws up a magic shield. The first claw misses, and the second would hit but Deni once again reacts with spectral wings. All attacks miss.

Gnog moves to flank and attacks with advantage. He hits for a solid 30, then again he hits - crit! - (it's a 19 and 20, too) - he's laughing loudly as he's attacking now - and was aiming dead centre between the eyes. On the second hit he jumps, brings the axe carves into the head, central, there's a blinding flash of radiant light and the head is essentially just blasted apart; too bright to look at; **80** damage through very good rolls (4d12+4d10+8).

When everything is calm, the body lies on the floor - but is not dust. Gnog asks Taz what he thinks; is it dead? Religion, 15+5. Taz figures out that the body here was possessed by a fiend; corrupted; originally, this creature might've been a native inhabitant of this planet - just a creature. Looking closer, Taz thinks it might even once have been a sphinx. The fiend possession is truly gone; the body left behind is no demon, so it does not crumble to dust. But it *does* start to wither as we watch; the magic that had kept it together dissipating.

Gnog calls the general and guides quickly - "Look - see - it falls; just another evil spirit; not immortal."

One guide is distracted - looking around now -  says, "This was an inner sanctum! A temple. A temple to knowledge and experimentation. They were visited by a super-intelligent being, who gifted them knowledge beyond their imagining. But when the being tried to take over control of the city, the people fought back. They rallied behind their Chief Scholar, who invoked a Guardian Sphinx of the city. Look! It's all here, in drawings. It seems there was a ritual, to resist this 'evil angel' - made a deal with an ancient demon of the desert - look, here, this drawing... But it goes on. Even though the drawings finish, there are writings - here, look. In retaliation for the resistance, their entire civilisation was collapsed by earthquakes while the city burned. Because they had allowed the demons to posses the city, they withstood the onslaught and were buried with the city, initially alive, but eventually their minds and bodies faded; I think nothing but the demons were left."

A lot of old scrolls and books are intact. We collect those, stowing them carefully in the bag of holding for travel; not for us, of course. Our Amonkhet "dissident" friends can use it as part of their history. We're thanked - but we're told *we* can take "*that*" - the general points to something the archfiend was sat upon. A pile of jewellery! Treasure. Gnog says, "It seems your late birthday gift has arrived, Deni."

Gnog says, "We saw; in our heads, from the Archfiend. Visions of the city falling. It was Nicol Bolas, of course."

The impact of this is grave. Centuries of planning, not just decades. He picks remote worlds - no spelljamming - little oversight; the people who watch for evil, not watching here. What a terrible, sad situation.

Taz investigation: 17+13 -> 30; d100 -> 76; 2d4 -> 4; d4 -> 3. We find in this room:

* Jewellery trays - display boxes - with:
  - **An ornate and large diadem** made of platinum with small gems worth ~1750*pp* (yes, platinum)
  - **Four cartouches (scarab design)** of different colours, made of gold with decorative precious stones *each* worth about 250gp
* A narrow, needle-like sword - **rapier - of +2**, in an Amonkhet style; plated in silver, made of steel
* In a folded silk box, a pair of **slippers of spider climbing** (!)
* In a stand-alone jewellery display, beautiful silk and lapice mosaic inlays, is a box about 1ft square but shallow and flat. **In the middle is an Ioun Stone!** Taz would have to study it to figure out its properties.
* Finally, a tiny, interesting-looking item - a 1 inch metal ~cube that looks like a tiny tower (like the castle piece in chess). Precious metal of some kind. Intensely magical - Taz Arcana 29. This seems to be preprogrammed knowledge; he's not sure how he would know it. It's "**Daern's Instant Fortress**". Quite a thing.

Taz uses the mizzium apparatus to cast L1 Identify on the Ioun Stone. He notices it start to glow; when it stops glowing, it retains a purple, prismatic sort of colour and appearance - it's the Ioun Stone Of Reserve. It'll store up to 3 levels of spells at a time and currently seems to contain L3 Summon Lesser Demons!

We agree Taz will find the rapier useful. The Ioun Stone is tricky, we'll figure that out. The slippers - well, those require attunement, and Deni has some capacity there, no longer needing her Cloak of Elvenkind - her stealth is already super high. She takes the slippers.

We talk about the fortress. Taz is quiet, just describing what is does. But we look at him, and it's all Puss In Boots eyes - of course, he can have it!

Quite a haul - it's been a while.

### 5000XP taken equally. Taz is close to another level, but not quite; just under 3000 away

Gnog says, "Weird, I enjoyed that - we've not worked as a team in close quarters that way for months. It just hummed along."

Time to go. We spend a few minutes checking alcoves in the halls of learning on the way out; Taz investigation 31, looking for things that are intact enough to be removable and can be stored in the bag of holding for passing on to the Amonkhet dissidents.

We re-check the scorpion pit; still empty. We retreat with great caution, checking the pools carefully, avoiding scarab swarms and so-on, again carefully shuffling over the sand as we exit into the blinding bright daylight, then commence the march back. The large sun has set with only the small sun in the sky, so the heat isn't as scorching as before and we make good time.

**TIME**

8:00am Ravnican when we get back; 12 hours awake.

A crowd gathers. The priest marvels at the scrolls. They've never had access to perspectives from a kingdom outside Naktamun.

We are considering a long rest, but it's not long before everyone is called into a main area. Everyone is gathering and sitting on the sand. Cloths are laid down and food is brought out for everyone from the kitchen tent. It's their one meal a day and we're now invited, which we figure means something pretty good. We thank them and eat. Everything has been made - they can't just buy things here. Puffy soft breads, yoghurt with spices chopped up from their hanging garden apparently, something like cottage cheese, lentils. It's really good, far less simple food than it might first seem.

It takes about 30 minutes. 8:30am Ravnican; 12.5 hours awake.

At least this one general is won over. He's seen what we can do - he describes it as valour, selflessness and a willingness to be open minded. He supports the high-risk plan to assault the gate; he does think a solution can be found.

**The priest has noted that the scrolls contain useful information that might help find the sphinx's nest.** Ifnir had records of locations and tales - poetry / prose, epic songs - that the sphinxes would sing. Always singing, talking, philosophising. The deal in oral histories, apparently. Amazing memories.

We need to rest; that clock is ticking in the back of Gnog's head again, but it's unavoidable. Days seem to be slipping by. We get back to the room with our bed mats and settle to try and sleep.

Gnog can't sleep so talks about the bad timing and embarrassment; he thinks of Eli a lot, but that wasn't what he thought - not a companion, more like a mother, though not quite that. Eli talked about his party being "his moon". But he doesn't think she or he would've ever realised that **Ajani is the sun**.

A quiet moment; the Deni says, "but he's really hairy and you're bald!". Fee-Ree is quiet, listening. We talk about futures; Fee-Ree and Arxcis, Taz's long life ahead and universe to explore, Deni ("I'm still a kid, I'm not thinking about those things!") - she's 17, yes she is, but she'd not talk to us about it and certainly not looking to settle down! - and here's Gnog, picking an impossible choice again. But he's recognised various variants of physical attraction now, from the Rakdos; but also that it's not the body that he's ever cared about. Not for who he loves. It really is the core, the soul.

He liked Ajani from the moment he saw him at Skaarg, acting the fool almost; jumping rashly into battle. But the "click" moment was in the old apartment, as the platform fell, after they had just teleported away. Frozen in horror, staring out the window; a hand on his shoulder, turned around, looking at Ajani. A moment looking at each other, Ajani looking sad but understanding - a surprise moment, a pause - before Ajani calmly but forcefully said, "We have to go now". That steel core, the leadership. Who he truly was.

And now the axe. Gnog thinks this is one-sided. But - you never know.

We sleep.
