# Gnog: Part 23 (Return To Ravnica)

## Continuing Day 58 (Ravnica 38, Riglan 94 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week) - 10:00am Ravnican. 3 hours awake.

We are on the Astral Sea, moments after having left Amonkhet. The planet was successfully taken back from Bolas' forces and the gate to Ravnica closed, but four undead gods, 30ft tall each, clad in Lazotep, made it through before it was shut. Gideon is on board the Navigator. Fee-Ree flies.

The first shift is uneventful. Gnog swapped back with Fee-Ree when she went to pilot the Navigator and stays at Deni's side the whole time. A few hours into her sleep, Gnog not reading or drawing - just thinking, processing - she's twitching and mumbling in her sleep. Maybe she needs privacy, but Gnog's concerned for her health so he listens. Mumbling, then - "But why? Why can't I come why with you? But I'll be good. You were away for so long last time. I want to come with you." Then she rolls over and goes silent. Then later, more. "But that's what you said! But, but grandma is boring. She doesn't do anything all day. You said I could come with you this time!" and she moves around a lot in her sleep. "No! No, you have to promise me. Promise me you'll come back." Then she actually seems to cry in her sleep, which is alarming for Gnog but he figures she needs to process all of it... Whatever it is. Then she finally rests peacefully. Occasionally she mumbles or chuckles and her feet move as if running.

In between, Gnog remembers the journal from the abandoned - we hope! - ship found in the asteroid belt when we approached Amonkhet originally. It's still a mystery, so Gnog tries to read some - with luck point, nat 20! Investigation 21 (he starts just reading but soon gets drawn in and starts flipping through to find out more).

* The author is a (fairly) young gnome, travelling. She has a guardian looking after her.
* She refers to her guardian as a person refers to "he" or "him" but at the same time there are references suggesting this isn't her father; Gnog isn't even sure if it is necessarily even alive. A golem or construct perhaps. "Her Guardian" or "The Guardian" or "Guardian" informally. Perhaps "Guardian" is not a title, but its/their assigned name.
* She has been exploring, looking for clues, scattered across the multiverse; **trying to find her parents**. She has been looking for them for **40 years**.
* She sounds smart, but lonely; often given to bouts of sadness. Discovers beautiful things on the places visited and written down. Fanciful, imagination-filled ideas of what she'd do with them, or how people would live and so-on.
* She often seems to make mistakes and end up running away from someone or something, off-world to another place. Initially the tone is "good to be free of people" but changes soon enough to loneliness. Guardian doesn't talk much, even though Guardian will hold her and hold her close, and sometimes that's how she falls asleep.
* Bouts of paranoia apparently, out in space; "I swear there's someone following us. I know it. We'll hide behind a nearby rock and sneak out once they've gone past" - then later - "They're very sneaky! They managed to avoid my capture". Perhaps there was never anything there to start with!
* Got to the Amonkhet system (obviously) - near the very end of the journal. She's spotted something very large; four or five ships fleeing; she hid in the asteroid belt. That's the last entry.

When Deni wakes, only 6 hours into flight, there are tears in Gnog's eyes and he hugs her close for a moment. "Even a Heroes Feast can't stop a god... Noted, with apologies", is all he says. He realises that he should find out more about her parents, if she'll ever talk about it. She was raised by grandma; that's all he knows; and her mother had some kind of exciting life, since Deni's original daggers were her mum's. He'd never thought about that. Adventurers perhaps. Runs in the blood.

He must smell bad as Deni asks if anyone has Prestidigitation!

There's a catch up for an hour two. We chat about the unknowns of what's going on in Ravnica, the gods and their lazotep - break that *before* firing the arrows, probably? We don't know.

We switch to watch shift 2. Taz is awake but resting in the 12 hour shift alignment that the pilots chose. He awoke with a brainstorm about the arrows - arcana 28. **"Enlarge/Reduce" spell**. It *might* be possible to enlarge Deni and reduce the arrows simultaneously; at around 5ft long they'd fit within the just-under-3ft-doubled-to-6 of the longbow. Trickiest part would be dropping Reduce while the arrow was in flight so that it hit the god at full size, and we don't know if Reduce on the arrow would interfere with or even destroy its magical properties. Could we Enlarge Gnog to 16ft tall - really, can anyone fire a 10ft arrow? Boboremos? Would need a custom bow.

### 10pm Ravnican

Half way through the period the flight crew switch; Fee-Ree sleeps and Taz flies.

Shortly after, Gnog (on watch, top deck) perception 26. Gnog notices some weird activity. Bubbles! There are bubbles in the 'air' around us, even though it's not really air. Then he notices a stream of small silver fish following the ship. On them, strange beings of light; the fish leave blue-silver bubbles in their wake. A couple swim up close, seeming a bit agitated, swimming around him.

Gnog tries to say, "Are we in your way?" - peering at them (Perception 22), they seem to be beckoning and pointing. Gnog looks where they're pointing - back, slightly where we came from but to the right. Gnog confers with Taz, who senses no fish. Gnog asks him to slowly turn the ship and lets him know when we seem to be going in the indicated direction. This settles down the light creatures. Gnog starts on his talk-to-animals ritual for the fish, hoping to be able to converse. He warns Taz that Comprehend Languages might be needed soon. In the distance, Gnog sees something floating in the Astral Sea; a light, glowy figure, part of its arm missing, waving; the fish are speeding towards it. Spyglass - it is the being we've met before. It's the Assistant Apparition; Gnog lets Taz know saying, "OK this could be important!" but Taz still cannot sense or "see" any of this through the ship. Gnog says once we're close he can come up to see for himself as we can "fly" ourselves over to get closer if need be. Strange though. Is this just an illusion? Investigation 16+1; it doesn't *seem* to be an illusion. He's fairly sure it's real.

We get to within 100ft or so, and Gnog asks Taz to put the ship to drift so he can come up himself. He can certainly see it with his own eyes; he confirms they seem to exist. Gnog just sort of "thinks" to the apparition, and it replies! "Ah! I've been looking for you! Come, come! I have to hold the door open!" Gnog asks if we can bring the whole ship. It turns and we realise the arm isn't opening - it's half in a "fold" in the Astral Sea. Looks inside, looks at the ship; "I don't think it'll fit". Gnog says to Taz, "Please let Deni know where I've gone and stop the ship drifting too far from this spot if you can..." and jumps to get to the "door". Thinks, "What's inside?" and realises Taz is alongside. Taz says, "Deni's fine!" so we both go in.

It's very strange. The apparition is "peeling back blankets" almost, wriggling through to the 'other side', holding it open. "Come on in!" and the fish are called to swim against it and hold it open too. We go inside.

Where the Astral Sea had no gravity or atmosphere etc., this area almost like that too but has a well-defined horizon. There is ground - or 6" layer of water maybe, but doesn't feel wet, shimmering and filled with reflected stars and otherwise blueish-purple. The sky above is perpetual aurora, ever-changing. On the water, there's nothing much to see, but floating *above* are little islands that look like chunks of rock - **but all ruby crystals**. Flowing down the sides are waterfalls, trickling away. This must be what feeds the "ocean" around us.

Growing atop the ruby islands, vines. They are pale in colour - made of maybe milk or ivory! - they climb upwards into the sky, weave together in a gravity-defying way and form kind of ribbons, corded and twisted, that lead off to the right. All meet in a vortex, twisting downwards onto a beautiful *palace* that we now see, our eyes led by these vines, made of the same crystal.

"The Ruby Palace?" asks Gnog. The apparition says, "Yes! I found it for you, I said I would" Gnog says, "I don't know how to thank you!" "Ah. Well. Uuuh... What do you believe in?" "Friendship." "Friendship is nice." and it glows a soft orange colour. "Yes. Friendship is great! What else do believe in?" "Balance". "Ah. Balance. Yes! Neutrality. That is right. Between law and chaos or good and evil or both?" Gnog thinks for a moment then, "I suppose yes, both; even good, if nothing but chaos, would presumably collapse; so, there must be chaos for evolution, but law for stability." "So good but balanced" "Ideally!" "Yes. Neutral. Neutral on the side of good. I like that." The apparition takes on a countenance of peacefulness, benevolence; and it looks to us, "But you are a warrior are you not? Or are you in some way..." (looks to Taz) "...a scholar?" Gnog says, "We are all changing, all the time. I was once nothing more than a barbarian. I am I think much more now. And I can see a future end to my warrior days, perhaps not that far away now." "Interesting..." - and it suddenly takes on a breastplate. Shimmering, beautiful; and an armful of scrolls. Gnog says, "Yes, that looks about right!" Then it looks and asks, "What is my name?" Gnog says, "I don't know your actual name. But I know the name of someone who changed a lot. And he was good, and a warrior but also a scholar. He was Garren. Perhaps that is a good name." "Garren sounds like a very good name." "Then, Garren you shall be." "is this Garren strong, or beautiful, or smart, or wise?" Gnog smiles. "All of those things." "Really?!" - and it grows a bit larger, takes on an older looking countenance, male aspects, looks strong, wise, handsome; all of that. "Will you remember me?" Gnog says, "Yes. Without question." "Then that is the greatest gift that you can give me. You have made me real!" "My honour."

Religion checks for Taz 7, Gnog 4! Oh dear. 'New Garren' says it's "Time to test out some new abilities..." and with a thought, creates a road. It is made of light and stretches directly to the palace. Gnog says, "Thank you again. Can my other friends come to this place, or just the two of us? We are five." "Hmmm. Yes. Yes they can. They will be able to visit it. It doesn't have to be now. You will know how to find it." "Ah," says Gnog, "So we can navigate here on the sea beyond the door by thought, now?" "No..." - and pulls out a tuning fork. Hands it to Taz. "You know what to do with this!" Taz says, "I understand!" "You must keep it a secret!" Taz nods sincerely. "I promise." The apparition reaches forward to Taz's chest and pulls at an illusory pocket, dropping the tuning fork into it. Taz says, "Oh. I didn't know I had one of those! That's quite useful." "Right, we must hurry. Time passes very slowly in this place but it still passes and you don't have much time." "Hurry to the palace?" "To the palace. Come."

OK, just us then! We are invited to step on the road and - whoosh! - it reels itself in, as if riding a worm, dragging/pushing us along in a wave as it twists and turns towards the palace. No gravity, so we can't fall! The strange space whizzes past us. It feels very tranquil, almost meditative despite the curiosity. Gnog finds the 'sea' and aurora quite beautiful. As we get closer, we realise that the Ruby Palace is *huge* - yet somehow, it doesn't seem to change visual size as we get closer. It's confusing. We get to it, and it seems only 10ft tall, tiny vines reaching to the top. Gnog says, "OK, so do we shrink now?!" "No. Knock!" and *Taz* knocks as requested. There's a tiny door, which Taz can just about knock upon - Gnog too big and clumsy. The door opens and a tiny person - the size of the fish riders - appears. "Oh! Right!" it says and either we shrink or it grows. A huge shift in size. We're at the door of the 'fairytale' Ruby Palace.

"You have come seeking the eyeless one!" and Gnog gets that straight away. Could it be?! "Yes! Yes we are!" "We have been waiting for some. And we are lucky, there are two of you! And a newborn God! A felicitous day indeed. Come." - and he walks in.

Gnog's head is spinning and his heart races. He follows this creature. Long fluffy ears, but tucked down almost like a haircut. We enter a beautiful, sparse-looking entryway. It's not decorative, but beautiful in its clean lines. The walls are made of a sort of "glamour weave", shifting material, constantly changing scenes, different worlds. Insight, Taz 27 - "I know what these are - these are memories, well, *dreams*" "Dreams? You mean, happening right now?" "Of times long lost. These are forgotten dreams." The Garren-God says, "Yes. The lost twin has always been the refuge for things that the multiverse has forgotten." "That sounds like Jace," says Gnog; "Are they connected? Jace and Ugin?" The question is not understood, but Gnog keeps it in mind.

We walk along halls for a while. It's just incredible. Astonishing beyond words. Fantastical dreams around us. Fragments of people's lives, people who must've passed long ago. We then reach a large garden, overgrown now, all the same marbled-white kinds of branches and vines, but ruby fruit. It's all red and white. In a pool of the same water we saw before, sitting, meditating, a slender, almost dragonborn-like; draconic head. As we get closer, instead of robes we see it has robes, draped over itself. It is almost translucent in colour. It is pale, red, almost washed out, approaching pinkish-blue. **Gnog clears his throat and says, "Umm, are you Ugin?"**

It turns around. It has no eyes. Completely blind. It rises out of the water. It *is* a dragon, but it shrinks down as we get closer, to something more of our size. Gnog then says, "Forgive me, my manners! I am Gnog, this is Taz, and newborn God, Garren." - a response by thought - "Ah, you've given them a name. Garren? That sounds significant?" and Gnog answers, "A friend, who it turns out were themselves..." - Taz finishes the sentence as Gnog struggles - "...an incarnation of the platinum." "Ah. Always righteous, always true, very good. A balance. A balance to my sister. Well, I say that; but I am literally a shadow of what I once was. There were three of us once, well, sort of. There once were three siblings!" Gnog answers, "Ah, we knew only of two." "Yes. Because the third has been erased from the memories of most." "I am sorry to hear that..." "The third was the balance. The third was the duality, that the other two orbited around. Where one was all emotion and power and raw force of the elements, the other was virtue, and righteousness, might and glory. That which had to balance them was philosophy, and thought, and music and art, where all the forces would meet in the swirling chaos to create true beauty out of the balance. For it is the struggle of the light and the dark that creates shadow."

* Note that Gnog misunderstands for a while and only works it out later. The 'three' refers to kinds of dragon - gem, metallic, chromatic. The 'siblings' reference was broader and more universal than Gnog initially realised. Of the gem dragons, one was Sardior, a representation of *all thought* and art and music and creativity. Sardior created all other gem dragons, but this genius mind had many facets and in the end, the Bolas facet consumed the others, becoming dominant, leaving only him and Ugin, until splitting and leaving just Ugin.

Gnog thinks for a moment and then says, "I'm not sure what to do, now I'm here. We need help." "Yes, my twin takes over the world; takes over all worlds. I can sense him doing this." "We were returning to try and continue the fight, in great haste, but we face overwhelming odds." "Yes, I understand. I can see everything that he does... He has my eye." Gnog says, "Yeah, he parades *that* around and I'd be more than happy to get it back!" "I don't need it back, but the two of us were once one; I could have a solution for you; I'm the only one who can bind him. And this is the only place that he can be bound. But he must be *forgotten*. People must believe that he has perished. Only then can I take him and bring him here." Gnog answers, "So would it be safe? It's not that I argue for the murder of another. Despite the evils..." "You cannot. Well, you could *probably* kill him. But I would advise against it. He has many backup plans in the event of his demise. We have to trap him without killing him. Weaken him. But he must appear to have died to everyone else; only then can I take him, because everyone has to believe has died, so they will not look for him." Gnog answers, "Even us, then? After the event?" "Yes. Even you. But *one* person has to bring him here. And that person must leave the world outside. That person has to stay here with me. This is the place where Bolas' powers can be countered, for I am - despite everything that has happened - still his twin! His equal. We are two halves of one whole. **We were Sardior**. Thirty thousand of your years ago, the Bolas persona - the Bolas half of this balance, of intelligence, spun off, on his own and coveted and lusted after more power. We were gods. But during a time - which you would know as the **Spell Plague on your world! - that period was known as The Mending,** for great magics had ripped the fabric of the multiverse apart. People travelling through time, meddling with futures and pasts, drawing upon the magics of stars. It threatened to rip the multiverse apart until The Mending could be completed. That stripped the powers from the mightiest of the planeswalkers, like Bolas; before The Mending he was more powerful than many gods. He's spent the last few centuries since then reconsolidating that power. He trapped me here, in our old home. I am trapped here by the memories of everything that was. I can't leave; if I leave both this place and myself will perish for no-one truly remembers us. They remember Sardior, they know of Ugin, but Bolas and Ugin together will hold this plane and we can exist outside of time. This is not an easy task I am asking of you!"

* **"I am sorry this happened to you. More than I can readily express. So much loss and sorrow for all has arisen. I would gladly bring Bolas here myself, as I wouldn't volunteer anyone else. What must we do?"**

"Here." - he pushes a hand into an eye socket (!) and pulls out a small ruby. "This is all that remains of my other eye. It was destroyed in battle when Bolas split himself from us. You must *destroy* my other eye; Bolas is tuned to the magic of these gems; you will be able to trap him in this gem, but it will only last for a matter of minutes and in that time, the wielder must decide to leave the world **and when they reach here the magic of this plane will erase all memory of them from the world** so nobody will come and find them. That is what this plane does. It is the home of the forgotten. You realise what this means?"

Unfortunately, Gnog does. It takes a moment to catch his breath; "...I do. Makes it even more impossible to ask anyone else to do it. A heavy heart, but this is what must be done. How do we destroy the other eye? He's very powerful!" - Gnog hopes his change of tone and question might hide the *terror* he feels in this moment.

"You must wear him down. But the eye itself is a physical thing. With a keen eye and a true aim it *can* be shattered." "Is there anything else we should know?" "There is a ward that must dispelled on it first. It is a **Ward Of Unbreaking**. Once dispelled, it will be susceptible."

* Bolas is in some ways worse than we thought, then. Just consumes. That's how he exists, and what he does. Worth remembering - consumption of power is his primary driver without any safeguards, morals or limits of any kind. Absolutely anything and everything that he can do to achieve that is fair game. That's not just him being nasty. It's in his most basic nature. It's *literally* how he's built.

In subsequent conversation, Ugin admits that in many ways Bolas is a genius intellect of Sardior thought experiment that went wrong. But eventually, Ugin says, "I can't keep you longer." Gnog replies, "Thank you. A difficult task, but we have a chance and the means to try to make it work... I suppose... I may very well see you again, perhaps quite soon, by Ravnican time."

"Travel well - and stay true to the path." "Ah! Well a wise man called Garren once made sure of that, and I remember his words well - and my friends will always remind me should I forget." The New Garren says "that is my namesake". "Correct. You don't have to be the same as him..." "...but I am created by your belief in me. I can do *anything*." - and realises this is a remnant of a dead god; lost all its followers. So Gnog says, "Well, you are indeed believed in once again. Are you coming with us to Ravnica, or travelling the heavens?" "I don't have enough followers yet to cross into the material plane. But in time, in time I will cross." "I would look forward to the day I see you again, but I guess I'll be *here* - so maybe Taz will. He's going to live a fair length of time!" "Well you believe in me. So if you believe in me, here's where I have to be." Gnog nods and says, "So, can you help us return?" and we are shown back - we step through a door, but in an instant outside the palace, then somehow all the way back at the 'door' instantly; the fish show where the door is; the god/apparition peels back reality again and we all step through.

Garren-God: "You must hurry along now. You're not far away." "Thank you. See you again sometime." "Good fortune."

We re-board the navigator. Deni asks where we were - for two minutes she couldn't find us anywhere. Gnog just clears his throat awkwardly, hoping not to have any quaver or sign of weakness in his voice and states, "We're about 3 or 4 hours to the next shift change when everyone is awake. We need to go on the drift and talk, all of us." "Don't we need to hurry back to Ravnica?" "At least we still drift on the Sea when not flown, but in Guildspace we just stop. This is the best I can do, it's very, *very* important. We all must talk."

At this, Deni simply insists we wake everyone up right now, so we gather on the top deck. And so, without time to really think of prepare, Gnog explains - both the good and the bad. He probably doesn't start well... "Deni, I'll never promise anything for you that I can't deliver. And I can't promise to be coming home with you all anymore..." - the words just tumble out. He tells of how he has to take Bolas back; that he'll be forgotten. Completely, forever, from all of time.

Deni is **furious**, initially storming away but returning - "This ship is too small!". Gnog does his best ("you won't feel sad, you won't even remember I was ever there!") but she's not in a good way. Gnog has to also explain about the Ward, breaking the eye and so-on, while Deni starts obstinately rummaging around in bags, pulling out books and papers, as if hoping to study her way - through sheer will - to another solution.

There's more talk. Gnog mentions being told "You're not far away". Deni is locked on though, digging through books. A look of dogged determination. She wants to find another way. Deni insists that those of us who haven't slept, do so now. She and Taz will watch and pilot. Ship's schedule be damned... She's not somebody with whom to disagree right now. Arrangements are made.

**About 6 hours later, Gnog is woken.**

## Day 59 (Ravnica 39, Riglan 95 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Monday (7 day week) - 4:00am Ravnican

"I'm sorry to wake you" says Deni "but you need to get up now". We go on top deck; Guildspace. "We passed through two hours ago" says Taz. Gnog asks about going back on ship schedule - after all, it's a day to Ravnica. "Not really", says Taz. "Look over there..." - and Deni points; distant, but clear, Ravnica and its moons. We're only an hour away from Ravnica Station!

Impossible. But here we are. Gnog asks Taz to come up briefly to deck so we five are gathered again. He points at the planet and moons.

"Impossible. **Impossible**. I've seen you all do some incredible things, but this... *Good*. *Fucking*. *Job*..." - Gnog takes a deep breath, closes his eyes briefly, tries to find courage. "...Mr Tablabu. Reverse direction on prior escape source, if you please, unless we hear otherwise from the sending stone - if so I'll let you know."

Gnog grabs the all-people sending stone, believing that - I think Feather told us? - it'd work within Guildspace general, but Deni stops him - "Best wait until we're closer - *just in case?* - it's very important" and Gnog agrees.

We get to final approach. "Gideon! You'll need to hold tight onto something once we're dropping into Ravnica." Taz, adv. (due to Orrery) Navigation - 24. He figures he can swing onto the dark side of the planet and approach near-dawn. The red wastes are on the edge of darkness. He calls up on the tube to tell Gnog, since by our chronometer it's 5am Ravnican in District 10, so perhaps hour-for-hour *did* pass in the Astral Sea in this case.

Gnog thinks, takes a deep breath, grabs the sending stone to all four: "Success. Gideon aboard. Amonket now thrives. Gate closed. Couldn't stop four gods but we bring weapons. On final approach. We fear for you. Status please." (25)

Very quickly, separate messages, almost overlapping. A RELIEF.

* Kaya: "About time! Could use help. Gods came through before gate shut. Situation greatly changed on the ground."
* Nissa: An Elvish word; "to bring back into the home", says Taz later, who recognised it. It's a greeting. "(Elvish Word). Not great news to report here unfortunately. Gods broke through. Last four hours have been tough. Front has shifted as a result."
* Jace: "Precinct 4 war zone, but secure. No longer the main assault point. Regroup when you arrive at Sunhome."
* Ajani: "Avoid Districts 11 and 12 at all costs! If flying, watch out for falling debris. See you soon. Hope you have my axe. Ha!"

Fee-Ree suddenly gasps and reaches for her own sending stone - if Gnog's worked, so must hers. She contacts Arxcis - to the relief of all, he's fine and his response gives her an idea of where he can be found, still underground, helping there.

Gnog warns Taz about falling debris, also not to overfly D11 or D12. "Please *power dive* the atmosphere, get us close to the ground *fast* but within the ship's limits and skim the surface to our hiding point outside Precinct 4."

A moment later, Taz calls up on the speaking tube - "All hands, prepare for atmospheric dive". We grab onto railings. The nose of the ship tips down and the Navigator points directly towards the planet, though its gravity plane is still asserted so "down" is towards the deck, a rather unnerving combination mitigated at least a little by the darkness immediately below even if the dawn edge is clearly visible at this altitude. The wings extend but are initially still. We start to see wisps of vapour around the ship as our atmosphere bubble begins to glance the very outside of Ravnica's own air; the wings start to shiver in that thin wind, then a moment later, they power up to full speed. A second later there's a sharp shudder, loud pop and stomach-churning shift as "down" becomes "Ravnica's ground" and the air bubble merges, with a sudden thump of pressure change, howl of wind and sharp jolt of cold. Clouds below get closer very quickly and within seconds we fly into them, the ship shuddering and jumping through the turbulence, howling wind pitch changing, warmer air but wet, a strange variance and beating from the buzz of the wings as all four battle slightly different air pockets in the complex wind stream flowing over the ship. We are thrown around violently for a moment, reminiscent of the Amonkhet sandstorm. The cloud layer is thick but ends abruptly; as quickly as we hit the clouds they part and directly below, darkness, but - distressingly close still, Gnog remembers! - the lights of District 10. Lights! Fires, too, but light, and with light, surely hope. We're actually quite low - no vistas of distant district cities this time; Taz calls "HOLD ON!" loudly through the tube but it's barely audible over the wind and it feels as if we're being pushed forward by deceleration as well as heavily down into the deck, as the ship rapidly pulls up, the nose drawing parallel to the ground. The hull creaks alarmingly; the wings whine in a shrill protest; but the Navigator holds together and just like that, the g-forces release and we're skimming, swaying left and right, shifts up and down, as Taz navigates close to the uneven surface. Gnog finds himself laughing out loud, suddenly, from the sheer exhilaration of it, despite the dangers and circumstances. It's a wild, wild ride.

Gnog sees sections of new damage even within the Wastes and clearly visible in P4 on approach. They must've broken through and been pushed back. Even more fires than usual now, he realises. Nivix, distant, is now very seriously damaged, far worse than before; Sunhome too. He then sees the Parhelion hovering over Sunhome like a sentinel, and thinks he sees - with his very good eyes - angels ring-fencing it and assaulting over the P4 bulwark from there. Despite the extreme Nivix damage, a clear beacon shines up from it, but he doesn't know what that is. Symbolism, perhaps? Or something to do with our P5 friends - with Gibo and Bebe's help - the plan to "disrupt" the Eternal gems. There's a lot more general area visible activity than before we left. He can just about make out P5, brightly lit, surprisingly. Shouldn't people be underground?

Suddenly as Gnog's trying to crane his neck to see more, the ship lurches down and into the tunnel - "subway" - slowing rapidly. Thankfully, despite all the extra damage we've seen, this is intact. Gnog shouts down the tube, "Taz! Just go straight through and park at the Ravnica Station platform, nobody *else* is coming down, after all - it'll be faster!" and Taz acknowledges, so soon, we're halted, parked on the platform, disembarking. There's a brief discussion about protecting the ship, and despite the urgency, we decide to give Deni ten minutes to cast Alarm and Taz further casts Glyph of Warding (as a deterrent) via the MA - we fortunately have the components. Arcana check is dirty 20 -> OK. The glyph is placed on the top deck, so that anyone boarding there will trigger it; explosive properties. Password is "monkeypuzzle" (as one word). While Deni casts, we're able to check our equipment, stow or draw stuff as needed and generally get ready for what we suspect will be a bit of a fight through P4.

"Move out!" says Gnog - he's always wanted to say that.

Up the passageways, to the surface. Clearly a war zone once we're on the ground! The wall must've been breached - not surprising with 4 gods coming through. Bits of the Krasis are visible here. They must have put up a huge fight, but these didn't make it. We get close the bulwark. Filling streets, over a dozen of the large Krasis who had fallen. It looks recent. Nissa did say "last four hours have been rough". We can see people moving between buildings. Citizens - Ravnicans, not underground. Above ground, carrying supplies and wounded, blankets. Gnog laughs, points and shouts (as we run) to the others, "They just won't be kept down! Even the citizens! The spirit of these people is *insane*! Irrepressible!" It's inspiring.

Sunhome is a centre of operations, evidently, as we approach. We can see an entire side of Niviz nearby destroyed, buttresses and wall gone, the interior exposed all the way to the sky lobby. The tower above has crashed into the building but even there it's been cleared enough to set up a beacon. Not inhabited as far as we can see. "Lit as a symbol of the resistance", says Deni. Echos of "Free Krenko" - ripped, hand-made, ad hoc flags of Ravnica or Guild symbols here and there, or "tasteful" stencil graffiti. Some symbols, some slogans; "Our planet our home", "We will endure". It feels different; battered, damaged, injured and on the ropes, yet with more spirit and fight. **A populous that refused to stay scared.** As they lose more, they fear less.

Gnog: "It really *is* their worst, yet finest hour."

We are all (literally) inspired.

Flying above Sunhome, damaged too with masonry missing and a parapet missing, the Parhelion. A massive fortress, 1000ft up. We've not seen it before. As large as four city blocks! Tall, too. Not a chunk of rock or whatever underneath; it's got a tiered, constructed base. Gnog frowns though and says, "Hmm, reminds me. I worry, of course, just what *is* Bolas still waiting for? Impressive though that is, we all saw what he did to the Platform."

The Sunhome gates are open. Field hospitals, logistics centres - multiple points, ad hoc often; aerial bombardment must've happened, or attacks from the air as many roofs are damaged. So Bolas probably *did* fly here and they lived, so he's *not* immediate death in the sky. Why did the "front change" though? We don't know where it's changed too. The sun is rising now, over the big trees on the front. Fewer than we remember from the glances we saw through the gate, when we "risked" looking... Damn. Some of the Verdani didn't make it.

**Must be about 5:30am.** (But it's sunrise, and that's odd, so Gnog suspects *some* shenanigans with time in Astral Sea).

We're on site. Close to chaos. Everyone is tired. Gnog asks a random passer by, "Do you know of Ajani, the big lion guy, or Nissa, the Selesnyan general?" "Um. Yes... Yes! Come with me please..." (Taking a moment to make the context switch and gather thoughts). 

We're led into a long side building, one of the ones with the long colonades. A room, stairs leading down; to a basement; a large room is set up. And there is Jace. Gnog runs up and sort of collides into him with a hug. He allows it for maybe a second, but then pushes Gnog away. He's tensed up - reacting badly - to seeing Gideon. Gnog's surprised. It's just for a moment. He struggles for a moment but then recovers. Nods to Gideon. "Good to see that you are well." - Gideon is also looking awkwardly.

First thing Gnog says is, "What day is it? And what time?!" and Jace says "Huh? Nearly sunrise. Sunday."

* We realise that what we thought was 8:30am on day 58 was in fact *dusk* of day 57. Not stormy, just going dark, when we viewed from the tower on our way to see Manesh preaching. And it's sunrise *now* but only of the next day - not two days later - it's day 58 (Ravnica 38), Sunday.

* We've been away about 5 and a half days.

## Astral Sea time dilation: It is actually day 58 (Ravnica 38, Riglan 95 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week) - around 06:00, not 05:30

Gnog answers Jace's confusion - "Astral Sea; we're a day earlier than we feared. We gained time."

"Huh! Ah. Yes. That is the difficulty of doing it that way instead of Planeswalking! It can be a jolt. You're out of time." Gnog goes a bit pensive then answers, "Yes, and you don't know the half of that... Are we able to gather everyone to regroup as you suggested, or is everyone too busy?" "Your message will probably serve to draw people together. The only one I'm not sure about is Kaya. I hope she will. We can probably get started without Ajani. He's - he's - Ajani. He decided to go to the front." (Gnog winces). "And that's the other thing. The wall is no longer really the front; it's *a* front but not *the* front."

He decides to just show us. We're led out. "It's entirely safe for now, but it *was* under constant assault for the last 3 days. We'll get a much better view from the Parhelion too. There are a few survivors... Most hid... Those who showed themselves, well..." - and he leads us to a tent.  Mu Yanling is there. Gnog says, "Hi. Um. How are you..." "Good. Yes. You're back! You're safe. You're more! You've brought someone." "This is Gideon. We're *extremely* glad he's here." "From Theros! Interesting. Your world is fascinating. The magic and belief systems..." but Jace cuts in. "Time for that later! For now, Yanling, could you please take us to the Parhelion?" "Yes of course". Her fox-dog spirit runs up her arm, sits on her shoulder, coiling around. She has blood on her hands - from looking after people - tells a few people what to do with some of her apparent patients - then walks out of the tent with us. Looks up, looks around, and calls the wind; she's floating as usual, but now we all are. It's not Fly, it's like riding the wind. "This is a fun alternative to a portal!" says Gnog. Mu Yanling and Jace have a stance - they are accustomed to this - we're kind of flapping around wondering what to do with our clothes blowing around.

As we approach, Jace draws some kind of sigil in the air. It seems to be some kind of passcode to observers above.

We can already see that the bulwark is still manned. Extra fortifications and reinforcements. Beyond, there are Eternals of course, but it stretches further than Gnog remembers now. A monument of horns? It's not over the Chamber anymore, it's further away. Far South, in D11. Whatever collapsed when we closed the gate, we figure must've been rebuilt nearby. Bolas is no longer at New Prahv, though the Immortal Sun still shines and some kind of shimmer gives away the presence of protective magic. Gnog asks, "Where's Bolas?!" "At is throne!" says Jace, pointing at the monument. Gnog looks closer - ah, some of the monument isn't monument, it's a very-still Bolas. Jace says, "We've heard very little from the Azorious, but three did make it out -" "Precogs?" "- we're not sure. They're at Sunhome. We can speak later. They asked for you! Ah - more on that later. We're here."

There's an almost-cheesy portcullis, stone jutting out as a kind of docking area. Beautiful glistening white marble through. It bristles with fortifications and armaments. A literal flying fortress; a war machine. Surrounded by angels. "...Wow!" says Gnog. "Yes" responds Jace. "Unsurprisingly, Aurelia has decided to move her seat of power up here." "So what's the view we're looking for, Jace?"

We stand on the platform in front of the Portcullis. He points things out from here. Roads leading out from Wayport lead to the actual port. They've pushed the line back to the wall separating Deadbridge Chasm from Precinct 1, the front moving far further South into D11. The only way to fortify that was moving people over narrow and damaged bridges via Wayport, causing a serious logistics bottleneck. Much harder than the Bulwark.

All of the four undead Gods have moved around where Bolas is, in D11; Liliana is there too. "Dovin however has not been spotted. Ensconced in New Prahv, we think." - so the centre of action has shifted, really, to D11. There are still many forces in P1. They sent Kaya in to establish contact with Taysa, to understand what's going on. It seems like there is some kind of stalemate or truce established there. Mu Yanling adds, "And Jace are you going to tell them or shall I?" "I was getting to that! But go ahead! It's more your area of study." She says, "The Fixers, what remains of them - and I - have been studying the disturbances in the arcane fabric of Ravnica and those disturbances increased in very specific patterns over the last two days. You could feel the change in the flow of power. I'm surprised - well, actually, Bolas has had to move, because whatever you did to shut that gate has damaged the nexus of the laylines, which the Chamber sat upon. That's forced him to move and since then we've been able to confirm that the disturbances we were seeing were caused by him. Bolas is the source of the interference, since the source moved with him. I'm afraid that our worst case scenario might be coming true; the interference - the magic that I can sense, the patterns that he is trying to change - is something that I've only ever read about. I always believed that anything that's been written down has a high probability of being true! But this was always considered a myth... It is written in an ancient language, that pre-dates humanity, predates Common. It is more ancient even than the language of the dragons. **It translates roughly to the Elder Spell** - part of the original long opus of creation itself, which legend has attributed to the three Elder Dragons." Gnog points out that he's a facet of one of those very dragons and that's very bad news... "So that means he probably can pull off casting that spell. It takes days; it was interrupted when he had to move; but he's started again. This suggests that he's absorbed enough Spark to at least begin the casting. He's shifted the front as well, because he was meeting too much resistance at the wall and needs to harvest Spark at a faster rate once the spell casting progresses. He needs to feet it at a constant rate so as not interrupt the casting. When it finishes, he would have consumed the Spark used to cast it, unto himself" - and we discuss it, what we learned; restores his powers as God basically, his lost powers.

* **He wants to use the Elder Spell to undo the effects of The Mending - but The Mending was put in place to stabilise the fabric of the Universe.**

* **"By my calculations, he *could* finish the spell within 5 days."**

It takes him out of the fight, unless things get dire enough that he has to participate. Gnog doesn't get into that.

We should get back and draw the forces together, form a plan - but first Mu Yanling says that Feather & Aurelia would like to meet us. It's not niceties, but more formalities and courtesy. We'll get up to speed in no time! We don't need a briefing. We learn:

* The 4 gods came through and just hovered for a moment
* As soon as the gate closed, they rampaged; 3 verdani lost, wall broken and enraged Bolas razed a huge section to the ground
* They did eventually get things back, in part because Bolas chose to move, distracting him from keeping a wider watch

There's also talk of Liliana. Frosty, as you might imagine. Gideon didn't just save her; he threw another under the bus to do it. There's a blade. The Black Blade; Gideon has it; they took a year finding it and it ended up attuning to Gideon for some reason. He didn't use it on Bolas because he'd have to go *through* Liliana for it. "Legend has it, this is the last known weapon reported to have - or confirmed to have - wounded an elder dragon."

The usual good-byes and inspirational moments; then we are taken to the edge again and Mu Yanling tells us to just step off. "What?!" says Deni - "Just trust me!" - ah, Feather Fall! We float down gently. Lots of time to use the spyglass and see the rather ostentatious temple - no need for Amonkhet architecture, it's all Bolas and very tasteless - Bolas sat in the middle, then at more or less equal positions spaced around, Oketra with her bow, Ronas with a long staff, hovering in the air with huge crazy almost liquid metal wings is Kefnet with a sceptre and finally Bontu - who looks somewhat injured surprisingly - carrying two huge batons with curving blades.

Gnog voices out loud a question about Gibo and Bebe; Jace tells us **yes, the device *does* work but requires a lot of power so it's quite short range.** It's stemmed some of the bleeding of planeswalkers, since they can hide behind the "sonic field". Dreadhorde trying to get close enough have their crystals shattered. It neutralises some of the more powerful planeswalkers though as they're in hiding.

We get back down and make our way to Sunhome. Jace sends a message telepathically to meet at "the secret hideout". That's actually not Sunhome - he means Vi's safehouse, so we make our way across town and into a brightly-lit P5, buzzing with activity. A lot of Izzet goblins, artisans and more are established. There are coffee roasters and bakeries! It's almost bizarre but incredible at the same time. Creature comforts. Taz investigation 19; he spots a ring bread stall, dives off, get us coffee and ringbread specially for Deni. "Oh my god! This is *really* unexpected but good to see that people have their priorities right!"

We get to the pocket dimension and into the now-familiar hallway - Gnog reminding us that it's probably a better "look" to have finished the coffee first rather than sashay in with food and drink, "terribly sorry we're late"! - Nissa is already there. Her reaction is very different. Pulls Gideon into a hug, forehead to forehead, says a silent prayer; asks him, "How fares your heart?" - Jace looks unimpressed and distances himself, sitting at the long table in the kitchen to the side, busying himself looking at things. The relationship with Gideon and Nissa is clearly closer and more caring. Shades of Eliastra. Motherly almost. Everyone around her, as an elf, is practically a child - "a young one". Goodness. **Is that what Gnog might be to Eliastra? Probably.**

We go into the kitchen and wait. Gnog hopes to see Kaya. Vi has big black bags under her eyes. Her hair has grown out. Taz asks if she wants him to cast Restoration; she's been "taking cat naps" and says she's OK. Taz realises it's a spell and says, "That's good Vi - but remember - do try to some real sleep if you can!" "Well now you're back maybe I can" and Gnog chips in, "Well, we have some bad news but a surprising amount of good."

A short while later, Ajani turns up. "You made it!" says Nissa. "Ah!" he responds, "You're back, in the flesh!" - he walks up and holds Gnog's shoulders, pulls Gnog in for a hug. Gnog hugs back, perhaps a little too long, then pushes away, looking a bit awkward as he says, "You looked after my axe?" Gnog answers, "An astonishing weapon. We would have died without it. Here, it is in good condition. It helped slay a god." "A great achievement! Thank you!" and Gnog is given back his axe and Stormbringer. Then Gnog clears his throat awkwardly and says, "That axe... It meant more than just power. It was a reminder of - well of you, and - well it got me through some difficult moments. Reminded friendship, and more." "Ah! Yes. Those things are important. They are the things that sustain us. **I'm glad I could be that for you. You have to find a port in the storm or you'll lose yourself. I can be your port." Gnog answers, "Well, yes to that! And I will try to be yours.** But I have to confess, the time for that might be brief. Much to discuss, but Kaya should be here..."

While we wait, Ajani brings us up to speed with the Front. Everyone's interested as this is new info. Fierce fighting but even that has pulled back. They did a big raid into a D11 Azorious enclave, quite a few people captured there and spark-harvested. Shudder. A desperate rescue attempt; managed to save many, but too late to save everyone.

Jace senses Kaya on the way. Not bad from a pocket dimension! A short while later, to Gnog's relief, she arrives; bursts in; plonks her hand down on the table, and says - "Right! I'm hungry. I'm thirsty! What is there to drink?" and VI answers "Truth, responsibility and bitterness!" and Gnog can't help bursting out laughing. "No. I've had plenty of that! I'm drunk on responsibility - I want something a bit more refreshing..." says Kaya; Vi says "Fine! Well played." and pulls out from her Satchel of Holding a beautiful crystal decanter filled with a bright red liquid. Gnog says, "Nice work Kaya! What's that?!" and Vi pours it out into cups and glasses, handing them around. "A light Brellian red... One that I really like. From Breland in Eberron." Gnog gives Taz a taste and then tries it. It's very light and fresh; he likes it. "Wow! Not bad, thanks!" he says.

Kaya asks what it's about. Gnog says, "Well first, Jace was kind enough with Mu Yanling's help to get us to the Parhelion..." and repeats his apology for the length of time it took. But then he asks about Taysa. She does live; "it's an evolving situation" answers Kaya. "I have done what I can. It's down to someone - perhaps more persuasive, more intimidating, or just more powerful than I - to speak to her. To save the lives of all the remaining occupants of Precinct One and Two, *and* the estates and areas to the South. Taysa is considering a compromise with Bolas' forces..." (Gnog's eyebrows almost go through the roof at that) "...they're taking a lot of losses, can't really hold out much longer but refuse to vacate those four precincts, for their entire wealth lies within. They refuse to give up Orzhova. More importantly, the bank of Viskopa."

It's confusing. Taysa is very intelligent, so Bolas must've promised her that she would get something she doesn't think can be revoked or reneged upon. See Domri, or all of Amonkhet! But P1 must be special; it's not simply destroyed, why? Nobody in the room we're in understands the true situation there.

**They've lost 8 districts to the south. Death toll estimate HALF A MILLION and Ajani mentions that they're losing soldiers at a rate of 1000 an hour, and won't last until Bolas completes his spell**

* We discuss Ugin, Ruby palace etc with Jace holding a spell that will let us all forget.
* Jace must cast an illusion that makes Bolas look dead. Powerful magic. He can then make himself forget it was an illusion.
* This means Jace must be alive! He'll cast a Simalcrum - duplicate. It'll take 24h, which means he's out of commission while he does that.
* Ajani and Gnog will use the god-killing arrows.
* Gideon can walk through Bolas' globe of invulnerability so he can use the knife to distract Bolas.
* **On taking Bolas' "spirit" trapped in the Ruby Eye to the Palace, and Gnog doing it, Kaya practically lambasts him** - she points out that plans are dynamic and we don't know for sure who will be holding what, where or when as this goes down. Gnog isn't asking anyone else to do it - "Well *somebody* has to do it!" - they just might end up doing it anyway.
* Deni would need to be *inside* that globe too, flying, on a stable base for aim, to be able to take a shot at the Eye - which itself *must* have the Ward Of Unbreaking dispelled, failing which someone might need to just go in there and try and smash it up. She looks at Gnog and winks when she talks about that.

Vi sort of turns our tenuous plan into cards. They explain that we cannot remember the details of why, else the plan will fail; it must be on faith. Each card describes things that must happen, like rules in a game. Jace notes that this makes the possibility of betrayal even easier, but we know that's going to happen anyway, so it doesn't really seem to make much difference except for increasing the range of options through which that betrayal might occur. Unsettling, but unavoidable. **We suddenly now cannot question things - the cards says so, so you do. Full trust is required.**

* Jace closes the spell; most forget the details of Ugin, the Ruby Palace and "being forgotten".

* Jace can also help the party forget the whole plan discussed on the ship. Gnog and Taz of course must remember as only they know *how* to get back to the palace and that it must be done. Fee-Ree and Deni choose to remember; Gideon, to forget. Only our core party and Jace know.

When it is cast - the spell is done - Gnog says, "All heavy stuff, but based in a true way to defeat those gods, and defeat Bolas, for real. An actual solid chance and an actual solid plan, however risky it all might be. Kaya! Good news. *Tesseret is dead*. And if you like, I'd be *very* happy to discuss details." "Ha! That is the best news. Next time, open with that!"

Gnog takes Kaya aside and describes it. The best souvenir he can offer is the fragment of his armour. If Bolas is even a fraction as arrogant and sure of success as Tesseret, then that's a weakness. Tesseret could've easily wiped the floor with us given the glimpses of his true magical power to which we bore witness - but for having to try and keep the gate open, distracting him and forcing him to channel his magic elsewhere.

Gnog calls to Jace before he leaves to begin his 24h spell - "The layline damage caused by the gate closure. Does that stop us being able to give Niv the Guildpact powers?" "No. And I have a way to reach him. We'll talk once I've finished with the spell. And... Watch Gideon. If anyone is likely to betray us, it's him. He's done it before." Jace leaves, but Nissa overheard that. She asks where we're going next - "Sunhome first I think, to see the 3 precogs" - and asks us to walk with her.

### 8:30am, day 58 (Ravnica 38, Riglan 95 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week)

We exit the pocket dimension. Gideon stays at the pocket dimension to rest. He's been a lot and there's a lot to absorb. Kaya is with us and tells that we can find her at "the bolthole" (a known location we learn about, in the underground). Ajani wants to head to the wall; there's a renewed assault. He walks with us a while but will peel off once we get to the Bulwark section of interest.

Nissa says as we walk - "You have to forgive Jace. We haven't seen Gideon in a while. The two of boys didn't part on good terms. It's about Liliana as I'm sure you've guessed but more than just Liliana. We... Look, Ajani. You know this. You know - you knew Gideon - the power of righteousness and good and light. I was in the Gatewatch, Jace too. In a sense, I think Niv chose Kaya to replace Liliana and I guess, well, I'm not sure why Kaya in particular or what he was looking for - the qualities of Liliana he was looking to replace - it's not the same magic; Kaya deals with spirits, Liliana dealt with death. Liliana has power over *the* dead. Kaya has power over death itself. And the personalities are quite different. But I guess you must have wondered by now, who in the Gatewatch you replaced? Who was the force of Chaos?" Gnog nods. "I think you heard me mention Chandra. Chandra Nalaar. Chandra had travelled with us for years. Chandra was with us on Kaladesh, on my planet dealing with the Hedrons; she was with us the first time that we went to Amonkhet. **She never left.** Gideon made a choice. Gideon chose Liliana. He chose not to strike her down when, inexplicably, she - I still don't know what happened! - but seemingly she sided with Bolas and chose to go with him, but we had a chance with the Black Blade to strike him down, but Gideon would've had to go through her because she'd put herself in the way and was saying 'You can't kill him - I won't let you'. Chandra, our force of chaos - a pyromancer. You can imagine her temperament! Also an artificer. She remembered how to make the Black Blade work; she had studied it; so when Gideon refused to act, she charged forward and took the blade from him and blazed through Liliana to try and get to Bolas. As she was doing so, Gideon placed himself in the way, to stop her from doing so." "To protect Bolas or to protect Liliana?" "To protect Liliana! But - you see - the Black Blade... It's power... It's not a good power..." (she speaks haltingly) "...Chandra could only hold it for so long and the delay of trying to move around Gideon as he held her with magic... **She burned from within. She fell that day.**" "Fuck..." "Jace and Chandra were very close. They were the original two who recruited the rest of us. I don't think Jace can ever forgive him for choosing as he did. The thing is, Jace loved Chandra; but I also know that he judges Gideon because he would never have allowed his love of Chandra to result in Gideon killing *his* love, Liliana. I don't think those two boys will ever see eye to eye. I don't think Jace will ever forgive him." Gnog says, "Do you think Gideon must've thought that Chandra would surely drop the blade, not let it destroy her?" "I don't know. I can't speak for him. But he left us that day. I know he doesn't take her death lightly. I know he must've been racked by guilt. I don't think he's as worried or feels as much on his conscience as he does for Chandra..."

(Gnog realises that when Gideon said "I failed her" - he didn't mean Liliana after all. He meant Chandra).

"...this is the full extent of what I talk about with Bolas. He didn't actively cause that to happen. He just set the wheels in motion. Jace and Gideon destroyed their friendship - they did that all on their own. They destroyed the Gatewatch."

Ajani, silent the whole time, announces that he must head off. He puts his hand on Gnog's shoulder. "You cannot bear the burdens of the soul of others. That is for them to bear. Let it not weigh heavy on your heart. I think that it is a good thing you have done, bringing him back here."

Gnog puts his hand on Ajani's forewarm. "I understand. The weight, though, reminds me I am still on my true path. Safe fighting, friend; come back to us."

Ajani heads off, glorious again; "Thanks for bringing back my axe... I've missed you, boy" he shouts, waving it and lighting it with radiant energy.

Gnog says to Nissa, "You're right about the guilt. 6 years in a cave. Never got over it. I don't think he still has. We just persuaded him that the Amonkhet people could use his help and that there was still good he could do. When we first managed to corner him - very reluctant to talk, that one! - he first said, 'I failed her'. We all thought he meant Liliana. But we were wrong and his conversation makes more sense now. He meant Chandra. For whatever that's worth." "I know... I know. He was like a brother to me. Unusual for someone so young. I felt I understood the burdens he carried."

"Where now for you, Nissa?" "I'm going to go to Vitu Ghazi. I certainly hope it doesn't come to this, but the Selesnyans and the Trostani - to save this planet - they have awakened Vitu Ghazi..." "Does mean what I think it means?" "Yes" "What would be the consequences if that was... If it was destroyed?" "No worse than if the planet fell. If this plan fails, Vitu Ghazi will only be mobilised to confront the Gods. It is when the Gods came through that they decided they had no choice. There is no force on this planet equal to a God, other than a plant God itself!" Gnog says, "Well, not to seem arrogant or anything, but we might be able to take down one or two ourselves!"

Gnog remembers that we need to divert - Nissa heads on her way - we retrace steps a little and dive into the Blistercoils to look for Gibo and Bebe. We first aim for the laboratory we originally found. It's there, with all sorts of lean-tos and stalls built around it; seems to be a hub of activity. Many Izzet are here. It's bustling; almost could be old Ravnica. A few Planeswalkers are here in plain sight. There are modifications visible where it looks like some buildings have roofs that can open or close with equipment raised or lowered, perhaps even deeper than ground level, in case of aerial attack. Very little Boros presence.

It seems that goblins from Foundry St have decided to join here to help build some of these extra extensions, casings and so-on to set up all this equipment. Izzet can theorise - Goblins can build. Unusual cooperation between precincts, which is good to see. We find Gibo and Bebe - still experimenting; looking for ways to make a portable unit. They can't quite figure it out apparently - it's a question of needing so much power.

They see us and say "Ah! You're about to witness a trial!". They lay Lazotep crystals out; put on goggles; test things; "This one goes 30ft with this portable pack! Only enough for two blasts before it runs out..." - and on they go. Eventually we ask about their mum. She's OK; still below, playing card games, making friends. They've made friends too and are in awe of being able to have things made for them - if it weren't for the circumstances, the precincts working together like this would be really exciting.

We must come back here in a day or two; see how the portable units are going. Deni leaves them with some of Tesseret's Etherium just in case they can figure out how to get that working as a power source.

At last, we get to Sunhome. The wall has a lot of activity again; many people are back on posts, fighting has resumed. The Parhelion is in action. It's moved over the wall and the angels are flying out in squadrons. They've apparently honed their skills in battling these Eternals; techniques are adapted. A popular approach is to fly up with chunks of rubble and drop them on oncoming enemies, back from the wall to slow their advance and give people on the wall time to act - archers; crossbows, ballistae; many more than we saw before. The Parhelion has also descended, so that it is within range for its own weaponry.

Gnog shouts in that direction, "Each one you kill isn't replaced anymore! When they're gone, they're gone, for good!" - it's probably more for his benefit than theirs, an expression of the emotion; most likely nobody up there can hear them. He itches to join the battle, but we have our role and we need to stick to it now. Trust them.

With more on the wall, fewer are in the courtyards and it's easier to find the precogs. It's behind where requisitions used to be, turned into temporary accommodation. There appear to be caretakers here - quartermasters turned hostellers. They lead us to the Precogs room. "We'll give you privacy - these three... We're protecting. Keeping an eye on them. There's a guard posted outside their room. Not because we fear them, but because we fear for their safety. They've been asking for you - waiting to see the four of you. Quite confident you'd come!" - We thank him and head in.

One looks up. "Ah! It's today!" and the other two agree. "You were right!". The one who got it right takes a tray nearby, holding tea and some war-ration-style biscuits and places it on the table. "We've been expecting you!" "Well... There was a 50:50 chance" says another.

They foresee no Bolas in our path tomorrow. One says "we're here because you need to get into New Prahv." Another, "You need to shut down the Immortal Sun, don't you?" They're here to help us get in. "We can't do it ourselves; there are still those..." Another, "doubters! We've been called doubters! There are other doubters in New Prahv. But we have to keep a very low profile." A third, "However, you're here because of the immortal sun. And we are trying to... We are here to help you figure out how to get to it. You have to turn it off, but you also have to steal it."

They can help us steal it, then someone else can help turn it off. Put it in its case while active, to avoid injury! "Here's the problem. We can recreate a rough floor plan of New Prahv for you, and then we can tell you what we know of some of the difficulties - some doubters in side might be able to help, but it's a very large building - but main thing is it is being protected by guards and wards. No magical travel in or out is possible. No messages can pass through. That's why the Dimir can't do what they do. What's more, there are a great many wards and glyphs all over the building designed to prevent intrusion, for surveillance - areas to avoid! - and the tops of all three of the columns, which are the anchor points for the Immortal Sun which hangs in the space between, unfortunately has a very strong anti-magic field in place. No magic will work there. That's why nobody has been able to fly in to grab it." "Oh, so is it physically attached?" "Yes, it's physically attached by wires. One strong metal cord running from an anchor point on each tower to a small platform suspended in the middle. If any of those cords break, the whole thing comes loose, off-balance and tumbles hundreds of feet."

They know about art traders, dealers, counterfeiters! They suggest someone might be able to come up with a passable decoy. We'd swap the two. All it has to do is emit the same light and have some kind of magical signature; nobody checks it, it's hard to get to and the anti-magic field is present. Counterfeiters have escaped P1/2, so they should be reachable elsewhere, but they don't know where. We posit that the Dimir might.

* **"We will warn you this. We see multiple different ways this could go, but don't know which one it is. We do know that it is absolutely imperative that it is done. We don't know why, but this feels like it is not a branch of reality."**

They have a map they'd started to draw. They're going to finish it. A few more hours they think, to put on remaining details. Very complex! We could go up any tower, but it's the Ledev Column that they know; the Ledev with the doubters; but the Ledev with the highest security and with Dovin.

* Sneak into the tower, avoiding all wards and detection glyphs
* Reach the top, high-wire walk, don't - like - fall off and die or whatever
* Somehow close the case on the real thing while swapping it with a counterfeit without so much as a flicker, while balancing on the tiny platform that's probably not intended to take the weight of a person
* Get back and get out somehow, without being seen
* And all of the stuff at the top - without magic, due to the anti-magic field
* And getting out, once away from that field - without portals, due to the wards

We leave Sunhome and figure we should expedite trying to find a counterfeiter. Heading below to see if we can find a Dimir rep seems a good start; Taz could message Lavaz? For expediency - yes. "Hope Dimir are surviving. Need help to find expert counterfeiter to duplicate appearance of active Immortal Sun. Imperative urgency... Isn't everything, sorry."

Immediate response! "Yes. Entirely possible. Understand urgency. Meet Duskmantle at once. You remember the way. Let yourself down."

OK! We know the way and head to P5 and the mystery tavern. Deni leads the way confidently. Some picking of locks - it's not open - but we rapidly reach the cellar, move the the puncheon and down we go. Deni uses the goggles and leads us through below.

Duskmantle is *busy*. A Dimir stronghold now, it seems. People of all shapes and sizes - we initially think they're helping shelter people from other guilds, but quickly realise that no, in fact, they're all Dimir. Before long, we are approached; a strange-looking creature, somewhat amorphous face, a beard of sorts that's made of short tentacles but not an Ilithid. Simic? "Guild leader is expecting you. Please come with me."

We're led to the 'scary mansion'. Gargoyles all around moving and watching, on full alert; occasional high pitched squeaks as echo-locating creatures move about, their calls sometimes low enough for us to hear. Shadows with spectres riding. Unsettling, even though we know what they are are don't feel under threat from them today.

Lavaz is inside with an older gnome who's richly dressed, almost Orzhovian, wearing strange Steampunk-style spectacles raised above his head. "I understand time is of the essence" "I'm afraid so." The gnome steps forward. "I'm Lord Penderworth and I am a, uuh, *architect* of contraptions which I believe is what you need. Something mechanical."

He explains that it'll be quite large and heavy (maybe 10lb) but he can have the *interior* built in 4-6 hours, but the exterior requires a jeweller and detailed drawings. 

Taz warns Gnog that the bag of holding would not function within the anti-magic field; it would appear to be just an empty bag at that point. Anything we want we need to take out first. That includes the fake sun. Gnog says Taz should try and keep a Dancing Light up at all times as a 'canary' so we know the moment that we hit the field, can retreat back outside, get what we need, then proceed.

We get upstairs again, thinking about artists! Best we can figure, Art Class, but that's gone and we don't know if the teachers survived. The precogs though showed some skill. Back to Sunhome! We're pounding pavements today. We get back to the precogs and ask if any of them fancy a drawing task that's a bit different from maps - more about life accuracy. They're happy to do it; "Benoit" is the one who'll do it. First time we've heard a name. We thank Benoit and head up, with spyglass. Parehelion maybe? Too high and busy. We try the wall. Too far. Can we find Levinia, Nissa etc. and try maybe a Verdani near the relocated Selesnyan front?

We head up towards P3 with precog in tow, in disguise. Taz adjusts his investigator's hat. Investigation nat 20! Total 33. He spots a Verdani nearby, moving slowly towards the front line. We try waving at it; then Taz says, "Wait, isn't that Levinia's Verdani?" so we try shouting and Taz "minor illusions" a loud "LEVINIA!"

Someone elephant-head-like is seen poking their head out from a crow's nest on the boughs. Silhouetted, but we hear her shouting and recognise the voice. The Verdani slows to a halt and we run up to it as Levinia climbs down. "Oh my goodness, you guys are already!" and Gnog gives her a big hug as she introduces herself over his shoulder to Benoit. "What are you guys doing?" she asks and Taz explains quickly. "I'm on watch. You can use my crow's nest! How exciting. I'm going to be part of some conspiracy!"

We hurry up the tree, which starts moving. Before long Gnog and Benoit are squeezed into the crow's nest, the Verdani at the battle front. Benoit is visibly uncomfortable being so close. Gnog hands Benoit the spyglass. "Don't worry. Focus on New Prahv. I'll sit here, blocking the view down to D11 and D12; he won't see you." Deni and Fee-Ree take the opportunity to bolster defences below, Taz too. They can keep aerial harrying away and Taz takes pot shots at anything he can reach below.

It takes about 20 minutes but Benoit ends up with about 3 drawings. He shows them to Gnog. Gnog adv perception 26; he points out a couple of minor changes; Benoit checks and concurs; makes the chances; and we have a good drawing. "Thank you. Let's get you back to safety." We descend, but must do so near the front. Gnog reminds his party to protect Benoit as a priority. Levinia gives us each a big hug. "It's scary up here. But what we're fighting for... There's no way we can let them win. We lose everything." "Yes," says Gnog. "Good luck". "Good luck - I hope your plan works."

We swiftly head away, making our away back to distance from the Front, then across to P4 and Sunhome. We drop Benoit off and find the others have completed the map. "Great timing!" says Gnog, and we take the map. We are briefed on what it means - ways in, what the drawings actually mean in practice and so-on.

* We can't teleport but we can fly and/or be invisible on approach
* Don't enter by front doors or gates on any columns (very heavily warded and guarded)
* Scale the walls if we can; go in through a window
* If we can go underwater, use the waterfalls and plunge pools in the centre to reach a service corridor for the waterfall systems via drains
* Patrols around that underground corridor area have two patrols in opposite directions around the circumference of the central circle, off which the three towers stand
* Once we're into that circumference we need to travel around that circumference to reach the Ledev Column and reach the engineering service room
* More patrols of course once inside there
* They've marked a room of a doubter on the circumference if we go that way; they have codes to access service shafts to get up the building
* There are transport rooms either side of service shafts that give access to aerial transports - we were taken in one once - so if we can't get into Ledev initially, we could travel between towers that way (at risk obviously)
* Roof access is only from the Waterfall Room, accessed *from* the topmost *habited* floor. Dangerous! Very heavily guarded. Dovin's quarters, a vault and the Arcane Source powering all the magic there - guards, wards and anti-magic.
* We need the box for the Immortal Sun. That's in the vault. The key to the vault is in Dovin's room. Of course it is... At least it's not on his person.
* Anti-magic field not active there
* Waterfall Room once inside leads up to the top floor where there's roof access and field *is* not (but that floor is uninhabited)
* The field is a sphere centred on the platform, though, so there's a bit of bleeding over into areas of other floors at the building fringes
* The service shaft lets us get all the way up to floor *below* Dovin's floor, but from there the only way up to that higher floor is via stairs on every floor that cut right across the central column - very exposed but unavoidable?
* One other particular floor is drawn out in some detail. There's a guard room with alarm codes and a map of alarm zones, so if we found that it'd help.
* That's also where the main library of the Ledev Column is found. They've seen Dovin put a scroll in there which details how to activate and deactivate the Immortal Sun.
* The key to the library is kept by a judge behind their desk in one of two possible courtrooms in the far other corners of that same floor
* They don't think the courtrooms are in use but we still have to be able to access them without hitting patrols

### Midday

By the time we're done it's about midday and we run yet again back across town and down to get the drawing to Lavaz. It'll be a few more hours until the counterfeit is ready and we figure we'll go in after dark, for all the disadvantages that confers, simply because we're doing too much on the outside or top of the building to get away with it in daylight. Dark clothing would be good; "Ah, Lavaz - You seem like a man who might be a purveyor of dark clothing?!" "Help yourself!" he says and leads us to a collection.

Ninja outfits for all. We promise to return them, but can't guarantee that there might not be a few tears. Or fireball damage, or whatever...

The question arises of course - how do we get *to* New Prahv, or away, at all? P1/P2 have been death zones since the initial attack - a complete no-go. That's changed a little but danger is still extreme. Perhaps underground; in any case, Kaya's been to P1, so that lines up with the idea of maybe trying to see Taysa to gain further insight first hand. Kaya said we could "find her at the bar", so we head to 'the bolthole' that were told about to find her. Some food and drink would not go amiss - we realise we hadn't eaten since the Heroes Feast on Amonkhet, with time in the Astral Sea making us not need food for that part of our journey. While we're resting, Fee-Ree will be able to meet Arcxis in person, too.

The bolthole is best accessed, we're told, from P5 (having pulled back from P4 after the initial encroachment when the gods broke through). At least we don't have to walk all the way back to P4 again - practically recognising our own footprints on the route at this point. Quite the day, only a few hours in.

**As we head down, Fee-Ree is clearly excited about meeting Arcxis. "I'll meet you at the bolthole!" "All good. Take your time!" and she runs off.**

The rest of us hurry onwards. We stumble across what we think used to be an old fortification. Looks like old city walls. There is a huge area of masonry, destroyed, as if it had been punched through by very large artillery. Exposed is a grand courtyard behind, little buildings, a surprisingly intact underground bit of city - a fort - the entire thing converted, now, to something that feels like an outdoor tavern. Tables everywhere. Candles. Furnace running what was probably an old blacksmith; food being made using it; even music. A sign above the huge hole in the wall says, "The Bolthole".

Gnog says, "Oooooooh!" pointing at the sign, as the penny drops.

In we go. Barrels of booze that people are apparently helping themselves to! Nobody serving. It's easy enough to find Kaya on a long table, having a joke and a laugh with someone there. She sees us and calls a greeting. "Pour yourself a drink and come over!" so we go to the tap room, trying to figure it out by watching a person in front. They point out a barrel they think will be "more interesting".

We wonder what's going on, figuring nobody seems to run this. Have Ravnicans become so honourable in the face of adversity that they're decided coin has no value now - what's the point in paying for something, if everything might case to exist tomorrow?

Kaya is talking to someone called "Kriggan" who starts to leave as we arrive. We see he wipes down his table and washes his own dishes before leaving and we make a mental note to do the same.

"What did you get?" asks kaya. "Don't know..." says Gnog, trying it. "Ah!" she says, "That's a better one. Brought down by someone who escaped from P1. It's very popular." "Speak of which, we were wondering - well, we have some time to kill. Got a bit of a job to do tonight..." - and we get into it. Kaya mentions that she might be able to organise a distraction if we can signal. We tell her to watch for shadows on the interior wall at the top of the Ledev column in the light cast by the Immortal Sun - her distraction, then, might help us escape.

As far as Taysa is concerned, Kaya can help us get to P1. Then we can sneak into Vizkopa Bank. Kaya has little insight into why Taysa is refusing to help with evacuations, except to say that Taysa had expressed frustration with Kaya having handed the reigns to Taysa so it was Taysa who was forced to decide.

Fee-Ree rejoins with Arxcis; we eventually finish up, say goodbyes and Kaya leads us to older tunnels. Eventually, Kraul meet us and insist they take over. They indicate a lot of dangers - tunnels that might crumble and break. We're led to a crumbling old cellar, with additional buildings now built on top. We have to push through a trap door covered with newly-fallen rubble into another room, partly submerged under collapsed earth, which leads us a back yard of an estate.

We are in P1.

### 1pm

To Gnog's surprise, it is very quiet. Sounds of fighting are very distant. Kaya motions her finger against her lips - be silent - and while Taz could use telepathy, they couldn't talk back to him. Deni stops us all and decides to take time out to cast Telepathic Bond. Taz recognises this immediately and explains telepathically to Kaya. Ten minutes later, we have communication! Win.

"We go out this way", says Kaya. "Do not be fooled by the silence. We are not alone. We must be very quiet - very stealthy!"

She leads us up to an inner wall of the estate. We look over. Main street below - full of Eternals. Less densely packed but still very numerous. A mixture of different types, including many of the chain wielders. Kaya thinks, "We have to get over to Vizkopa Bank. We have to go along walls and alleyways - we can't risk crossing the main street. Means the long way around."

Adv (since Kaya shows us the way) stealth:

* Taz only 12
* Gnog dirty 20
* Fee-Ree 15
* Deni (auto success)
* Kaya (high enough)

3 successes, 2 failures. We *just* scrape by despite Taz and Fee-Ree being a bit noisy. So, we make it - 5 minutes - we drop into the back of Vizkopa Bank. We have to get into a window on the 3rd floor. Gnog knots the Rope Of Climbing but to be sure it has somewhere to attach, Deni uses her climbing slippers and takes it up the wall herself. Once secured, we can easily climb the knotted rope - except Kaya who "blinks" up directly.

"Most of the danger is past" thinks Kaya. "Nobody in here would be too surprised to see us! They'll assume we're supposed to be here. Put these on just in case..." and some priests vestments (!) are thrown our way. We put them on; Taz looks - well, let's just say it needs tailoring.

We over to the big tower we went up during our "tour" a while ago - the 'very expensive people' region. We do go past a few people who don't seem to pay us any attention. We enter the upper apse and Kaya pushes her hood back. Taysa is there with two bodyguards. She looks over. "Huh. Kaya. What are you after today?" then looks at us. "Wait. Is that... No!" - Gnog pushes down his hood. Kaya says "I've got stuff to do!" and heads out.

### 1:30pm

We all drop our hoods. Taysa stands. She looks tired. She's uninjured and immaculately dressed. She looks, narrows her eyes and waves away the two bodyguards who leave, shutting the doors to guard outside.

Gnog: "You look tired. How are you holding up?"

"I *am* tired. This is a burden, being responsible for all these people - and these souls."

"Probably wasn't what you had in mind with Bolas coming through..."

"No. No shit!" She hardly ever swears. "I wish I didn't have to be here. Kaya put you up to this. I don't know what she's trying to achieve. I can't leave here. I can't leave!"

"We just wanted to understand."

* It turns out that Taysa has a horrible choice. With Kaya, she used the term "currency". Kaya misunderstood.
* It's the souls. Bolas threatened Ravnica with destruction lest he be fed fuel.
* This morning's attack was Taysa, having been hurt by Kaya's words, trying to hold back a "tranche". Bolas raged and attacked at all fronts until he was given what he wanted.
* 1000 per hour. There are about 100,000. The spell will probably need about 120,000 more.
* Gnog suggests we just *ask*. He recognises Taysa's pain and guilt, the impossible choice.
* Taysa agrees, but wants Gnog to come to explain.

We are taken via underground paths to the Orzhova. Gnog comes; he is tasked with explaining. With a luck point, Gnog gets persuasion 21. Taz pitches in, persuasion 25. In the end, it's only enough for about 48,000 souls to agree.

**That means we have two days until the feed to Bolas runs out.**

### At around 2pm on Day 60, Bolas will probably have exhausted all souls and will rage

Contracts will be redeemed to surviving family. All will be looked after. All ancestry in the afterlife will know their sacrifice too.

With heavy hearts, we head back to Taysa's room. Gnog says, "That's two days. That's bought us a lot of time. It's a hell of a sacrifice". "Whatever plan you have, I hope the time we've bought is enough." Gnog responds, "Well if not, we're fighting gods sooner than we thought, but we were always fighting them. Just a question of when. And speaking of fighting, that brings us to P1 and P2. Is there anything we can do, with that - morally difficult, but agreed - sacrifice in place, so help save the living that remain in these districts?" "No. I think he would notice if I tried to evacuate anyone. But as long as the status quo is maintained they're safe within their houses. It's like being in house arrest. Thankfully, most of P1 is very well stocked up! Some have fled; many have died trying to flee. The rest have remained in place, out of fear. And I'm responsible for them."

We agree for Kaya to help spread the word amongst estates. Get them to start moving. There's a fight coming. They need to be ready to evacuate North, via maybe Whitestone, so get as many massed that way. Taysa herself once she formally agrees with Bolas will be watched, and on her own for that period, so we have to act for her.

Kaya writes a message on paper. Hands it to us. "Can you get this to my friends at The Bolthole? It's about tonight." "Social engagement?" "No! It's about what we talked about tonight - since I can't do it myself." "Ah. Thanks. We'll deliver it. Good look, good hunting; see you on the other side." "You too. May the darkness cover your escape!"

We retrace our steps, but this means more difficult adv. stealthing.

* Taz nat 20 -> 25
* Fee-Ree nat 20 too
* Deni auto-success
* Gnog balances the universe - rolls nat 1,2 - he falls through a weakened roof - 300lbs will do that! - but his friends are able to cover it up fortunately with magic.

We get to the Kraul tunnels and make our way to The Bolthole, passing on Kaya's message.

All the machinations, agreements and so-on with Taysa had taken a while. Fee-Ree suggests we go to Arcxis' area to study the map and finalise the plan as she thinks he might have finished his work shift by now.

* Kraul to help reach as close as possible to New Prahv
* Underwater breathing to get inside
* Definitely need the Doubter on the circumference ring to give us the access code for the service tunnel
* Almost certainly need the Guard alarm codes and alarm map from the guard room floor, hoping we don't trigger alarms on the way!
* Deni carries 95lb. Max is 110lb. So if the box isn't too heavy (and she unloads some stuff) then she could theoretically carry. But can she balance the sun and box one in each hand? We can test that with Lavaz later.
* We could get a long rope for Deni to take over (150ft will do it, and we find that down here with surprising ease) then it can reach the platform and double back as a way to increase you chances for balance and not falling if you slip on the metal wire
* Deni suggests we *both* go out. One to hold the box, one to drop in the replacement, so there's no flicker. It's probably the only way to do it. But that's a **lot of weight on that platform**.

We have what amounts to a short rest. Taz attunes back to his mandolin for now, dropping the Helm. Fee-Ree holds onto the staff of warning. We make our way now Lord Penderworth. He shows us the contraption; it has to be turned on and is super bright. We can't have it on while crossing. OK, that settles it - Deni and Gnog must both be there and, well, the support cables had better hold!

Penderworth is even able to give us glasses - he exclaims, "of course, sunglasses! the vampires have them!" - and we get a pair each, so Deni and Gnog won't be blinded by the sun*s* while working near them.

We get back to a cave. Fee-Ree talks about making dinner and we do eat that, but then Taz says, "I think what we had before helped too?" and we agree, and decides to run that at The Bolthole.

### 6pm

* He cheats the universe. He uses Performance Of Creation to make a gem-encrusted bowl worth 1000gp.
* He casts Heroes Feast, consuming the (temporary) bowl.

While Taz prepares that, Deni also does her Water Breathing ritual for the four of us.

Taz's feast is able to help a fair few people.

* All of us
* Two of the people helping with Kaya's distraction (the leaders)
* Nissa (though Ajani is too distant; Gnog is sad)
* Gideon partakes
* Four Boros Captains who are off duty and going on for the night shift soon
* HP max bumps by 15 for everyone (lucky roll on 2d10 -> 9+6)

### 7pm

The dark clothing goes on. Our preparations have understandably caught the eye of people in this relatively busy area and we're helped with face paint, so that we're very hard to spot. We even make a good job of covering up our various bags. Deni suggests to Gnog that he keeps on the Boots Of Elvenkind. No kidding!

We're directed by the Captains helped by the Feast to Kraul, who can help get us close to New Prahv underground and without further ado, he head out. Gideon has been trying to find out at much info as possible about Liliana's location and how to get to her, and needs to continue that research so does not accompany us. Besides, we want a small, quiet group - such as we are!

The Kraul are able to lead us under Griffin Heights, at the Southernmost edge of P2. The hill upon which it has been built includes various tunnels and is the closest they can get us. We thank them at the exit and before emerging, spend a few minutes for Deni to cast Telepathic Bond. Too useful on Amonkhet to miss that one! Fee-Ree suggests that Taz and her could be invisible for now; we each cast that to conserve resources (Taz via the Mandolin).

Cautiously, we quietly emerge. We sneak!

* Fee-Ree stealth 15 (despite invisibility adv)
* Taz 22 (invisibility adv)
* Gnog 26 (boots adv)
* Deni auto-success

It's pretty dark; dim light at best; Taz and Deni (via goggles) are fine for now. We want to find a way up that's not just the main sloping grand entrance road! Taz isn't disadvantaged by the dark so looks. Lucky 19 perception -> 22. He sees stairs that work up walls to at least reduce the distance up to the top; we do that. From there, we can't immediately see much but Deni risks walking up in her "slippers" and is able to drop a rope, but she's not strong enough for Gnog to climb it - he tries to simply jump up! Athl 17+11 -> 28. Easy! Jumps up, grabs hold of a ledge and pulls himself up one-arm. He can then hold the rope - 15ft roughly - for Taz and Fee-Ree. It's weird having invisible people climbing a rope; like opening a door, that level of interaction doesn't reveal them.

We're around the outside of New Prahv, beautiful lamps and a decorative low wall with statues/carvings. We're looking for a way to hide in the water pretty much. We can *see* the Ledev column to the right. Enough light for Gnog to see OK; perception 21; stop and crouch he "thinks"! A patrol. We wait... A felidar, too, which is a problem; it might smell us! They pass. We wait - count - 10, 20, 30... That's enough. We make a break for the central fountain area.

Stealth again:

* Taz 19
* Gnog 26
* Fee-Ree 22
* Deni 36!

This is contested individually against the felidar, on the other side of the fountain; it does not notice us - the wind blows between the buildings, carrying scent away. We make it across just as another patrol emerges, heading in the opposite direction. So they do that on the top level circle area - perhaps in any large ring construction area, so that's something to be aware of.

We slide quietly into the water. The waterfalls and fountains are loud! There are fish here, looking surprised.

We know from the precogs and map that we need to swim around to the drain, which is a distance from the Ledev Column. There's a squeeze there. Taz easy; Gnog acrobatics, nat 2, total of 5! He gets almost stuck, a lot of wriggling around. It takes a while. Taz and Deni are already through, Fee-Ree assists pushing from behind. Eventually, the overflow cistern is reached and we could emerge, but know we must immediately find a way to hide from prying eyes and patrols. We'll be wet and leaving footprints - so Taz says he will lose his invisiblity and prestidigitates. First though, patrols.

Taz while still invisible pops his head up and spends a while timing patrols. Investigation 4+13, 17, it's enough to figure out one goes right, one left, and given the timing he figures they must cross at certain points to left and right. To our left as we look into the main central ring corridor, the map tells us the Doubter's Room is left and happily that's the shorter route to the Ledev Column.

Prestidigitation takes about 30 seconds and we've about 6 minutes before a patrol would encounter us. Seems like enough so we make haste, Gnog carrying Taz so he doesn't clank on the echoey stone floor. The little corridor on the map is easy to find, but has a side door; it opens; we go in, and a person has just come out from the room opposite the one we were looking for. They say, "What's going on?!" and Taz is already casting Detect Thoughts. Wis. *17* save but it fails and Taz can hear the surface thoughts. He's thinking that "are they intruders; will they hurt me? He looks big and scary..." and Taz immediately with telepathy says, "We're here to make things better and we're not here for you and don't want to hurt you. Could you please wait in your room for a few minutes, then we'll be long gone?" - persuasion is only 20 including BFS. He still has some doubt. "I don't want any trouble" he's thinking as he backs into his room, thinking, "this is not good, I wonder if they're going to hurt anyone, should I have gone into the room? But if I alert anyone they'll probably kill me?" and Taz thinks back, "Be calm. We are not here to hurt any Ravnican, no harm at all intended. We are here on an investigation. There is no need to worry!" - a better persuasion; 29. They calm right down. "You can read my thoughts?" "Yes, I'm sorry, we had to know if you were going to try and attack *us*!" "I'm just trying to keep a low profile! I don't want to be dragged up. I don't want to be sent away." "Keep doing what you're doing. Survival is key. Things *will* improve, I promise you. It just takes time."

The Doubter's room is locked. We don't want to make noise knocking so Deni sends in the mouse. *Three* people sat, scared. Gnog asks Taz to tell them we're outside, we're friendly, we're sent by Azorious friendlies who escaped P2 and we need their help. Can they please open the door. So Taz, unable to *see* them, simply knocks very softly and whispers at the door!

The door unlocks. A cautious face. They look around the corridor. Taz immediately "thinks" to them, "We are friends of Benoit." They beckon us in. We go in. Taz "thinks" to them now, they being visible, that he can communicate with them without speech, we can also talk as a group of four but they have to whisper as he can't read their thoughts but he *could* read one person's if they let him, or shift his attention to do so if they indicate who wants to "speak". It's up to them. (Detect Thoughts is still up for almost a minute).

There's a whisper-and-thought conversation. Ultimately, we get 'thought' the code for the access shaft; a *pattern* to draw on the door. Cool. Thanks! Taz is asked to repeat it, and does; it's correct. Fee-Ree is using the chronometer and warns us that we only have 2 minutes before the guards cross - *then* we go for the Ledev Column; four minutes to reach its access shaft, we *think*, best reckoning.

They ask how Benoit and the others are, and what's going on. We fill them in briefly. We remind them that their actions, to lay low and survive, meant that we've been able to get this information; they've done the right thing. Eventually it's time to leave. The person across is looking. Taz thinks a "thank you, we're leaving". He leans forward and takes something off his lapel and hands it to Taz; Taz sees it is a spellcasting charm. "Many thanks friend. This will be helpful." "Good luck!" and we slip away.

Gnog perception, nat 1+9; he's distracted by looking behind for guards. Taz, perception 19; he notices Fee-Ree's staff beginning to glow. That's off. The patrol should not be here. We can either try to sneak into a side room, or run for it to duck into the Ledev room. Taz warns everyone and says we should try to speed up but have Fee-Ree run ahead, in case we're not fast enough, so she could warn us to try side-doors instead!

We *just* make it, Fee-Ree encouraging us hurry as she sees the guards ahead of us. Stealth all round again, adv. due to hiding:

* Fee-Ree invisible so fine
* Taz 20
* Deni automatically fine
* Gnog 25

We can't make it all the way; we have to duck down behind some equipment for the water system. It's a similar cistern to the other before, but this one is locked. So *that's* why we couldn't just come out at the Ledev column. Extra security. Why wasn't the other locked? Quite possibly, Doubters - or the escape route for the Precogs?

The guards pass. We can start breathing again. But this wasn't guards; it was just another group that were walking around here. Detect Thoughts is long gone so Taz can't find out why; we do overhear a bit of conversation, "...room 614. Are you sure?" "Yes I'm certain. We heard them talking the other day..." - sounds like an internal security thing; probably after Doubters. Ugh.

Finally, we are at the service shaft door and Taz isn't sure where to draw the glyph. Arcana check is only 17, but it's enough to see that there *is* a ward on the door rather unsurprisingly, but it's a locking ward. This helps him figure out that he should "draw" the pattern on a space at the top of the door. Gnog has to lift him up to reach! He draws the glyph; the ward falls, the door is open; we go inside and close it quietly. Dark!

Cleaning equipment, ladders, mops and so-on; scrubs, cloths - Taz recites - and amongst it all, **a metal ring ladder leading up.**

Taz picks up a small bucket and hangs a couple of cloths on it. There's a small apron too, small enough for him, so he wears that over his black clothes. It's a strange combination but it might passably make him look like a Service Construct. He can always Minor Illusion his face to look like his face, without the black paint!

We head for the floor with the guard room, and courtrooms with library key. 7th floor. That alone seems like quite a bit climb on the ladder, so the top of the building will be a tough thing to reach. Taz opens the exit door and emerges as if intending to clean. Looks around. Deception is terrible even with advantage for disguise (nat 4,5 only 12) so he hopes he isn't seen closely by many guards! Perception 21, gets a feel for timing but there are random people around too. One calls "Goblin! My trash needs emptying!" so Taz trundles into the room the man came from and gets the trash can. He trundles back to the service column, leans in, whispers, "sorry, heads up" and pours out the trash down the service column, then trundles back to return the bin. Job done.

He returns, closes the column door and describes the timing and what he saw. The guard room is further than the court rooms but those might have alarms and only the guard room can tell us that, so we opt for guard room first. It requires a full 180 degree curve on the circular corridor, which isn't possible with timings in one go. Taz says he noticed that the guy with the trash emptied had been packing up, so Taz watches and sees him leave. He locks the door, but it seems mechanical; it's about 1/3 along; we decide to risk it - time it, head out, pick the lock, hide, time it, exit and Deni will have to try and relock or at least disturb the lock so the door responds to the key and the owner won't know. But Taz thinks, how could you clean the rooms if they're locked? So he investigates - and investigation 23, finds a ring with keys on. "Bingo" he thinks, then things, "wait, what does Bingo mean and why do I know that word?" And Gnog thinks back, "I think it was dog or something? Anyway..." Deni says "You're all amateurs" and takes the keys. Watching the chronometer with Fee-Ree we time it and head out, unlock and get inside; then wait. Gnog listens at the door, perception 23. He hears the guards going past and listens for anyone else. He hears things recede. He says "Good to go, but we'll have to be careful at the guard room itself - surely occupied."

The door to the guard room is closed. Taz uses L2 Detect Thoughts - we have only about a minute - he detects nobody within 30ft. He pulls out his detect magic wand *and* checks the door with arcana. No magic on the door. It is locked, so Deni finds the key. Takes 3 attempts but we get inside and she locks it behind us. Taz keeps scanning for thoughts and two people are coming near, a patrol, but we have to hope they'll pass by - we look for the alarm information. Taz is busy on thoughts, Fee-Ree on staff, so Gnog perception 21, Deni investigation 26.

Gnog notices a shelf by the door with a couple of folders and clipboards. Deni runs up and flips through. She figures out the location of the wards and alarms on the floor and their combinations. It's similar on all floors, but we guess that Dovin's floor/room almost certainly has additional protections.

* Alarm triggers
* Surveillance

They Arcane Eyes are in areas like the courtrooms, the transport rooms but not the internal stairwells. Alarms triggers on all "important doors" - passcode triggers for library, transport rooms and on the two clerk/records rooms coming off either side of the library itself. We learn the password to bypass basic alarm triggers.

We wonder about the courtrooms. Invisibility needed. Deni says that it's OK. She needs Taz, once he's inside - but he's in disguise and as long as he Minor Illusions his face to be a metal construct it's fine - he needs to figure out where the Arcane Eye is. She can evade its gaze once she knows that. Then she can walk up walls, around it and down the other side!

Taz knows which rooms are empty right now. The Records Rooms are empty - either side of the library hallway - and we have the password, so that's a place to go. Fee-Ree and Gnog will hide there. Taz and Deni will make their way back around, evade guards again via the vacant room. Deni, with keys, will wait there while Taz continues to the other courtroom since he can be seen, sort of, and pass as a construct. Apparently, he looks like a goblin!

So we do that. Fee-Ree and Gnog figure they may as well search the records room while they're there, at least, the one they're in, so they work together. Investigation adv dirty 20. There's something from the magisters and architects detailing the layout of the vault level. Dovin's level. The vault, and the arcane source. This tells us where extra guards, wards and traps are on that level. The vault is protected by a very complicated *mechanical* lock as well. There's an extra room in the centre of the vault for the most important things to the Azorious and we figure there's a strong chance the box that can contain the Immortal Sun would qualify!

Meanwhile, Deni and Taz make it to the empty room and Taz continues to the courtroom. On the way along, he passes a goblin who looks at him a little confused. "I thought - why are *you* cleaning this floor?" and Taz says, "Ugh, one of them made a particularly bad mess in the courtroom and they asked me to come in to help back you up." Deception with BFS, 17. Goblin looks more closely. "You're not a goblin" and Taz answers, "I am a construct". "Oh. Interesting. Think my cousin is working on constructs!" and Taz says, "I think I might have been designed by a gnome, but the workmanship might have been better if it was a goblin." "I wish I knew how the rest of my family were doing. They're all outside." He looks sad. Taz says, "Constructs can't know, but if they could, they'd know that Precincts 5 and 6 are doing surprisingly well." The goblin perks up. "Really? So there's - there's life outside?" Taz says, "Yes, life and hope. Hang in there." "Are you going to consider cleaning this floor?" "Yes. Well, I'm going to... Pretend to clean the courtroom..." "Here." says the goblin, handing his proper outfit, complete with hat, for a true cleaner outfit. Means it looks like the same person. "Thank you" says Taz. "Can you get a message out?" Taz grins. "My pleasure! Who do I can contact and what should it say?" 

* **The goblin is called Malvin; his brother is Calvin, working at the forges in P6, he gives details of which company and says, "Tell him that I'm scared but I'm OK and I would've contacted them sooner if there was any way to get messages out".**

Taz says, "I will pass that on. Now, you must go and keep doing what you're doing. Just be a cleaner. Soon, we hope, everyone will be free."

Taz enters the courtroom, in much-improved disguise.He pretends to clean. While he does, he looks for the Arcane Eye. Arcana 24. It's not hard to spot. The Eye is a physical thing, so it's easy to see where it looks - near the entrance but where the 'audience' would sit. It apparently is there to watch them, for security - ordinarily, a benign thing. Taz "thinks" the details to Deni, then heads to the back to enter the judge chamber. The door is not warded in a way we can't get past. He "thinks" to Deni and says "I'm checking the judge chamber". Investigation 16. He says, "Can't figure it out". Deni reaches it. "Neither can I. It's a desk, papers in the drawer. Did you check the drawers?" so Taz digs deeper; nat 1 -> 14 investigation. She has a go. "Um. Do you think *this* might be a code?" and she kind of thinks of the picture. Four glyphs. He automatically recognises it. "That's lucky" he says, "I was getting nowhere - so many papers! Would've taken hours to check. That's the code! Make a copy, then put it back." So Deni does. "Which record room are you in?!" she thinks to Gnog and Fee-Ree - "the side closer to the empty room we hid in, or the other side?" and they respond that they're in one on the empty room side (closest to where Deni was going).

We have to wait for patrols; same thing basically, using rooms to wait out the patrols, and we get to the records room. Taz at least has a much better disguise and it's lucky Deni picked the room with the code. Fee-Ree and Gnog meet us once the patrols are clear and show us their findings. Useful! We don't waste time on the other record's room, happy enough with our unexpected find. We use the glyphs to enter the library and get inside. So that's a start; but now, we need to find the scroll. It's a library. Lots of scrolls.

It's likely to be quite different in style, because it wouldn't have been written on Ravnica or by a Ravnican, might even be from Azor themselves. But Azor founded the Azorious so perhaps it's *identical* in style, ha! There are displays in the room and six rows of shelves. Taz thinks, "Well, Oketra archive playbook; see if we can find the system they use." Taz investigation adv 22. They're by author. "A is for Azor" thinks Taz! First row. There's a section dedicated to Azor's writings but no scrolls, just books. At the far end, display cabinets so on a hunch Taz checks those. Each case contains works, creations, schematics, etc. written by former guildmasters. Azor counts, so we look for his. Pride of place. Four scrolls. We check the display case for traps etc., Deni senses nothing physical but Taz - Arcana 29 - there's something there. Some form of magic. It's an arcane lock. We don't have the glyphs for that. Fee-Ree takes a risk and casts L3 Dispel Magic, hoping that's enough. As she casts, a field around the display case shimmers. It doesn't shatter though. A tunnel appears; she has to hold the spell while we draw out the scrolls, and she has to hold it while we check so we hurry!

Taz investigation 21. One of the scrolls *is* the one we want. Taz asks if anyone has a scroll; reluctantly, Gnog gives up his long-held Scroll of Protection From Undead. Taz swaps it in the case, so it sticks out and looks about the same; then we put all four back as they were, but keep the immortal sun scroll. It goes into the bag of holding, just in case it has any detectable magic signature outside. Fee-Ree drops concentration and the case re-seals.

"Back to the shaft and up to the top!" thinks Gnog. The usual shenanigans to avoid the patrols; and we're back in the service shaft and climbing. A long way! Athl checks:

* Deni 2
* Fee-Ree 12
* Taz 20
* Gnog 26

Deni gives up on the ladder and uses her slippers. Works better. Fee-Ree, well, we help her and just give her the time and breaks she needs. The pauses give us a chance on some floors to hear people inside. It takes about ten minutes to climb up the huge tower. Con saves:

* Taz 15
* Fee-Ree 21
* Gnog 19
* Deni 9

Deni really did struggle and needs help. She's a key player, we can't have her exhausted. Taz casts L5 Greater Restoration and she feels a lot better.

We're at the floor *below* Dovin's room. We'll need the stairs to get up to it. It starts near the access hatch but cuts sort of "north-south" up to the far side. Taz has to repeat his previous schtick to time patrols. Fee-Ree uses a high spell to make the other three invisible but we don't want to tempt fate and want the patrols at the 'E-W' points, sort of. So he heads out to "clean" but decides to Enhance Ability on himself for Charisma advantage since he's visible. Check: 5,20+7 -> 27. Not so much as looked at and gets time to assess patrols, then when the coast is clear, he tells the others to start moving but he heads up the stairs in front, in case he encounters anyone at the top (and assess patrols up there). The others are close behind.

* Gnog adv. 29
* Deni, Fee-Ree also good

Taz asks others to pause on the stairs and checks for patrols first.Investigation, BFS included is 20. Very odd! No patrols! His magic's still up. Strange architecture with metal inlays on the walls. Arcana check, 25. It's *humming* with magical energy up here, but strangely, it's kind of inactive, as if it would be *activated* by something. Something triggers it. A dense concentration of sensors everywhere. Huge number of wards/guards (glyphs). He's thinking the details back to the crew on the stairs below. He can even sense a deadness, on the far side, where the anti-magic field is clipping, so we need to take care on that part of the 'ring' if we go there. The vault's ridiculous number of glyphs, combinations, keys is madness, but at least *that* makes sense. The Arcane Focus room is probably the source of the dormant but pervasive field.

Perception, 18+3->21. He's startled by a section of the metal wall detaching and flying around, with a sensor. It's a sort of metal bird, looking for trouble. It flies what looks like a standard route before folding back into the wall; Taz is relaying all this by thought; he notes that there may be others and he has no way to know when they might fly or what their routes might be. Then he hears a door close nearby. Someone walks out from Dovin's room. Dovin himself! Yikes. He walks along, looks down, "What are you doing up here? You're not allowed up here!" and Taz just nods and trundles back to the stairs and pretends to head down. Deception *another* nat 20, crazy; 27. He 'channels' Goblin! Very deferential and apologetic. "Don't let me catch you up here again! Nobody is allowed up here!" and Dovin continues, reaches into his pocket as he does - "Might as well make yourself useful". He throws some pocket lint into the floor! So Taz actually has been given an *excuse* to briefly stay on the floor.

Dovin walks up to arcane source room; Taz goes just far enough around the corridor; he sees glyphs drawn; he tries to see; perception only 16; charisma-based sleight of hand; only 21. Sees the last three glyphs only as Dovin's body is in the way for the first one. At least he sees *how* to enter the glyphs and the door's mechanism. Each glyph is drawn on a circular area that twists, unlocking something, in sequence until all four unlock and the door opens like an aperture. There's a light above the door - it goes red as Dovin goes in, so it gives away the presence of an occupant.

He gets a glimpse inside. Some huge area in the middle with various floating mechanisms, circular, very strange. Taz keeps watch and thinks out, "I can't see the combination for the arcane room and even if I could I'm not sure what I'd do in there to disable all the magic traps on this floor. Best I can suggest is you try and break into his room, since we're sunk without the box and the box is in the vault."

He cleans up the lint on the way back!

The others "think" to Taz that they're at the door and Taz joins them. We only know how to disable the alarm on this door, assuming the same alarm codes; so we do that and it does work, but that's obviously not all of it. Taz investigation 22. Physically speaking, he sees a series of small glyphs that appear to move around on the door (!) as if a passcode. An *animated* glyph passcode.

After a nerve-wracking moment, we figure there's not much choice but to risk getting inside some other way. Taz can try Dimension Door via the MA, but it's quite a high risk thing. Fee-Ree mentions that she *could* risk Wish, never yet used, but she can't get *out* once she's inside! In the end, Taz has to swap his Enhance Ability for Bless to de-risk using the MA for Dimension Door. He also adds Deni and Fee-Ree to that. He goes for it - MA; L4; actually rolls very high, 31 total Arcana. He isn't sure how far to go into the room and figures - keep close to the door, in case of arcane eyes or whatever inside. So, he gets a couple of feet inside.

Perception 15. He notices something closing down on him! Dex save 22. He slides out of the way just in time! It's a blade, that swung over the door. He still takes 5 damage but that's OK and he holds his Bless concentration. The blade stays swung down. He could reset it but while looking sees two handles that seem to be turned at the same time to unlock the door! Now, he figures first, investigate for other traps. Another huge roll! Investigation 31. Three other triggers and traps. He knows how to avoid them; so he "thinks" about this to the group, pushes back the blade and carefully latches it, then turns both handles carefully. Click-click-click-click... Outside, glyphs rotate to form a pattern (which Deni tries to remember). Double-door, slides open like Star Trek - "quick", thinks Taz, "we don't know how long he'll be gone". Deni lets her mouse into the corridor. It watches the light. If the light goes off, tell her.

Taz points out the location of the traps to Deni once inside. Disabling them makes her visible, inevitably, but he hasn't seen any Arcane Eyes - Dovin doesn't want to be watched inside his own room. Very many traps and Deni is careful to note how she'd re-set them after. Interestingly, all mechanical; perhaps concerns about magic users, anti-magic fields, suppression, who knows.

Chests, drawers, bookshelves; an amazing contraption in the middle of the room that looks almost like an astrolabe that rotates by itself. There's even a sort of bed here; maybe more of a meditation "pod"/egg. Soft lighting - thankfully. Two bookshelves; Fee-Ree immediately warns us about arcane wards on those. There's a huge table that looks almost like it is made of a puddle of mercury; impossibly thin; underneath the astrolabe thing, which floats above. It has gadgets on it, a book and a couple of scrolls. Taz investigates the drawers and chest; not warded. Investigation 26. A small jewellery box with four keys in it is found. That's a start. The astrolabe thingy and table below have no wards but it emanates very powerful magic of an unknown type. An artefact maybe.

Gnog perception (with luck point) while Taz is investigating, so he looks around feeling a bit useless - 23. He observes the weird astrolabe thing. Something clicks after a while. "Hey" he thinks, "do you think that kind of looks like those glyphs on the door of the vault?" and Taz - who's had a better look at the vault - looks; yes; similar; Deni also thinks some are similar, but we don't understand the relationships. There's a piece of this thing that seems to be movable, a handle on it. We decide that we have few options! We agree - Deni pulls the handle, even though it might set alarms off.

The whole thing shifts around. Taz recognises three glyphs from the arcane room (and now recognises a fourth, so draws all four on piece of scrap paper - we *could* get in there now perhaps). Returning the handle, it reconfigures again. So we take note of *those* glyphs, on the assumption that ordering might be the same. But parts of it shift, not just a rotation for display purposes; and at one point, a line on a glyph changes. There's a time factor. It changes. A constantly changing code somehow magically keyed to unlock the doors. Without this magic construct you'd never know the codes. Taz Insight 18 (thanks to Bless d4->4), he realises it changes too quickly. Someone must be present at the vault door to let them know when it changes, then get over there as they unlock the vault.

OK, that's the best we can do. Deni re-sets all traps. Everyone out; Taz re-locks the door inside and waits for the glyph to change, waiting for the party to reach the vault, tells them mentally, Dimension Door there. He burns L1 for another Bless, they run off, he watches, it changes, and he attempts the L4 DD via the MA. Arcana check DC 18 and it takes both Bless (d4->1) and BFS (d4->3) to scrape it with 19. Very close. But it works.

Deni is frantically trying physical keys! The glyphs worked, she says. One works, thankfully; at least some of these keys must be right. We hurry in. The mouse runs to us! The light has gone off! We shut the vault door and hope Dovin doesn't come towards the vault in case *it* has a light too.

We're in the vault - and freeze. Arcane eyes *everywhere*. So Fee-Ree first casts Mage Hand, then burns a higher level Invisibility for *all* of us. L5. This gives her some limited interaction without becoming visible.

* At this point we realise we've made a horrible mistake. **We have no copy of the box itself**. Once we remove it, people will know.

Deni tries other keys - door interaction seems fine for Invisibility - on the inner vault, which we assume is where the box will be. The other three keys for three keyholes, it turns out. Three! Of course. Azorious... A triangle retracts as things click open and the inner vault slides open. Taz thinks, "Well the arcane eyes probably see *that* but not *who* or how it happened. But this leans into the idea of maybe we make it look like theft, since if anyone investigates, they'll see this happened."

* So we smash-and-grab. Expensive stuff into the bag of holding. But most of all we want the box. We start with other things so that it's not the *first* thing which the arcane eyes (presumably) see just kind of float up and vanish!

* Gnog perception 24. Jace had described the box roughly, and he sees three which fit the bill. Fortunately, all look ornate and expensive. He also sees in particular a beautiful diadem and a staff on display. Into the bag. Finally, a crystal ball. He hesitates at that - "Fee-Ree, is this safe to touch?" - "I don't know. Crystal balls can be used as mediums..." and Gnog elects to leave that. Just a ball of glass, after all.

So, done. We can hear Deni's thoughts. She's just astonished at the precious, magical items here. But time is short and we grab enough for it to look like a panicy smash-and-grab, then it's time to head off. We relock the central room and get to the main door. We can't cast anything or we'll be visible so we just have to risk opening the door.

We step outside. The light on the arcane source is still off. We lock the vault. Gnog says, "Gonna lose magic now; we've got to get to that waterfall room and Taz said the anti-magic scrapes it". We need to find a room, because we need to know which box to use. So Taz casts Detect Thoughts; becomes visible; no thoughts in a 30ft radius, and there's a door right in front of us. He thinks to Deni, "can you open that?" - and it's easy, but she becomes visible too in the process. In we go, quietly close the door; it looks like store room. Maybe that's why the lock wasn't too bad. Might've been a bedroom once but not inhabited for a room and just random stuff stored here.

The vault keys? Who knows. Bag of holding for now.

Quietly as we can, we pull out the three boxes and Taz uses his wand to see if what signatures he can find. All three are magical. One is *far* more magical than the other two. One of the weaker ones is Transmutation - changing things. The other two are Conjuration. Bringing things into the plane. Ah. So the box perhaps puts the Immortal Sun into a demiplane, like a bag of holding, But then, it won't work in the anti-magic field. He looks at the other one, then; transmutation; messes around, activates it - arcana 17 - it grows in size. Deni pulls out the scroll for turning off the sun, in case that has a clue. The scroll itself is written in Ravnican, and Taz uses L1 Comprehend Languages via the MA. It has retrieval and storage instructions too. Some of the stuff is magical glyphs he can't understand but the prose around is fine. It mentions that the box can grow or shrink. So the *less* magical one is what we want and we need it in the grown shape so it'll fit the sun. Gnog gets out the counterfeit and slings it under his chest using a tied blanket, like a baby. We put the other two boxes away and Deni asks the mouse to check if the coast is clear, but it does notice some other people have arrived and went to Dovin's room. He'll notice those missing keys sooner or later...

...We dash over into the waterfall room and - pop - visible. All magic drops. Gnog looks into the BOH because he's never seen its inside! Just cloth. Deni's disorientated a bit as all the things we wear and use lose all power. Even the normally-24h effects of Heroes Feast are dispelled.

We climb. There is a short ladder. And that's it - impossibly - the roof. Windy! And inevitably very scary. Deni hates not having the slippers working!

We put everything else down, just the box and Gnog and Deni. The wind whips around. Impossibly bright orb hanging; we put on our sunglasses just to be able to look even close to it. Chains, not wires, taut but not rigid. The platform is wobbly. Gnog says, "At least the chains look thick; solid enough to hold weight" - and investigates the anchor on the tower side. It's built into them - the anchor point must be inside. A winch perhaps, which would be good news if so, means a solid anchor. He *says* - since no telepathy either - "OK, only risk is the anchor at the platform. Can you take the long rope across, please?"

So coils the rope around her like a sash. "Ooookay..." - she's really nervous - Gnog puts his hand on her shoulder, "You know these are strong skills you have and no magic is needed for them. You'll be fine." - and indeed, she is; rolls Acro 28. She has to balance her way across. It's not perfect; wobbly, a few pauses when wind blew particularly strong; in the end almost crouches, almost hand-over-hand and foot-over-foot. She loops the rope so there are two sides and Gnog needs to find an anchor on our end to help himself get over. The rope is longer than we need so that's easy - the roof has the column we came up as a kind of small rooftop room, so he loops it around that.

Gnog's turn for nerves. Rages! Wants to use brute force. Gets the rope, monkey-bars his way over, the chain and rope both helping, athl adv dirty 30. If he falls, his rage might give him some flight (unless that's magic!) - Deni is clinging on as the platform bounces! - it's *very* bright, even with the glasses. Gnog looks over his shoulder and sees our shadows on the inside of the Ledev Column - good. That's the signal.

He'd used a shorter rope to tie the box to his back, and a blanket with the counterfeit slung like a baby. He gingerly undoes the rope, and swings the box around. Deni takes it and gets ready, lined up. Gnog swings out the counterfeit. "Ready?" she says; "Turn it on the moment this goes into the box and I shut the box" Gnog says "OK, count me down, three two one, we go on zero." "3, 2, 1..." - Gnog dex check with last luck point only 17 - almost gets it wrong, there's a very brief dimming, but it's hopefully not noticed. It's a good counterfeit and we have the right one in the box. Gnog slings *this* into the blanket like a baby as that's easier than tying, on this platform.

Now Gnog must return first. He warns Deni it'll be bouncy again; re-rages and goes for it. Athl worse this time - the box is quite cumbersome and he's more nervous given what we're carrying; only 23. It's windier too. And he can't see as clearly - should've taken off the glasses but didn't get the time. He makes it, but it's a bit slow. Deni has trouble as well (only 21 acro) - she's having to re-coil the untied rope as she goes. At least she can't fall! That takes a while too - perhaps a bit more shadow-signalling on the Ledev Column than we had in mind...

...and suddenly, we hear a clamour. It sounds like whistling. Looking down, Gnog sees a spray of flaming arrows! They spring form the Bulkwark and fly towards the P1/P2 boundary, big range. Gnog says, "I'm no expert but I think that's our distraction!" - and then it looks like ants, moving in unison, flickering light of flaming arrows reflecting off Lazotep; really creepy; Eternals moving. We grab our kit.

Gnog says, "Ah shit, OK, feather fall, once we've dropped..." - so we hold hands in a row - 3, 2, 1 - shiiiiiiiit.

Taz tries to cast Feather Fall but can't get the MA to work - too scary, one hand holding Gnog's - con check only 11. He shouts to Fee-Ree, who uses the most ridiculous casting of Wish perhaps ever in history; an L9 spell to cast an L1 effect. Even she is only just able to make it. We're very close to the ground! We drift down into the fountain. We have to swim! Not quiet. So we swim over and try to make our escape. The Felidar almost gets us but we dive under the water at the edge to hide our scent. We can hear people, muffled, saying, "That's suicide! Why would you attack! That's crazy!" and another one arguing, "It's the spirit of Ravnica!" - dissent of opinion, voiced openly. Interesting.

Fee-Ree makes us invisible again. Stealth rolls:

* Gnog nat 20 and a 19, heh, so 29
* Taz 16
* Deni OK
* Fee-Ree OK

We scrape it - wet footprints sadly. We make it over the fence, down the side, to Griffin Heights and into the tunnels.

So we stand just inside for a minute, wide-eyed. "Holy shit" says Taz. Deni laughs, "That's a rush!" and Gnog chuckles back, "Right in your wheelhouse. Fantastic work up to. And thank-you Fee-Ree." Deni asks "What did you get?!" wondering what we stole. Fee-Ree says, "Oh no! We're returning *all* of this stuff once Dovin's gone, including the keys, once the Azorious is back to normal, yes? Right?" Deni Wisdom save. She makes it, and agrees.

The box seems not multiplanar, but we don't risk putting the Immortal Sun into the bag of holding, but we do shrink the box back - Taz knows how now. Only 1ft x 1ft, rather than the huge 3ft box it was before. We do rearrange our kit, shuffle stuff in the bag so properly stowed and not just thrown into a heap, so we know what belongs to the Azorious. Then we hasten back along the Kraul route.

As we walk, Fee-Ree says "I don't think I'll *ever* top that use of a Wish spell!" Taz feels a bit bad about the MA but it was an unfamiliar spell during a death fall! We also are quick to point out his amazing deception as a goblin cleaner, and he's the only one of us that managed to pull the wool over Dovin's eyes.

### 9pm

We get back, tired and low on - almost everything - at around 9pm. Gnog figures we should sleep, but first, SURELY we have earned a drink at The Bolthole!

Fee-Ree sends a (physical) message to Arxcis who comes to join us. He asks if she'd like to spend the night. Then we realise we haven't actually got a sleeping spot - and Arxcis points out that there's room in his area since many went to the surface. So we thank him and agree, but we'll give them space.

Other people are chatty. They know Arxcis well. He encourages people to tell stories. We hear a lot of human level stories, about how people are surviving. Individual acts of heroism, or "just" resilience.

Arxcis leads us back, eventually, to his area and we set up camp.

### 11000XP each (Orzhov and heist) but we split it; 5500, Taz 27500 -> L17!

Gnog voices the concern - **How do we stop anyone from stealing back the Sun?** E.g. betrayal, or a Bolas collaborator. Can we e.g. ward it somehow so it needs a quorum of consensus? Deni suggests that, if nothing else, we can pass the BOH to whoever is on watch and at the start and end of each, check to make sure it is still there. At least we can narrow down a time window if it *does* go missing. We can also do Glyphs & Wards to protect from others even getting that far. Doesn't protect much against *us* betraying, but definitely good for others. We also take note of how heavy the box feels with the sun inside - again, that could be faked, but it all adds barriers.

We finally get to sleep. Very welcome!
