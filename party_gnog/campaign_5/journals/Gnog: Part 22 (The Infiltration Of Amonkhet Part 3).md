# Gnog: Part 22 (The Infiltration Of Amonkhet Part 3)

## Continuing Day 57 (Ravnica 37, Riglan 93 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Saturday (7 day week) - 20:00 Ravnican, awake 9 hours

We are in a perilous situation in Naktamun, accompanied by Samut. We have stolen plans to the Necropolis from Oketra's temple, then used them to determine a key location where special runes can be placed. They facilitate a remote magical activation of an explosive force that *should* collapse the only above-ground entrance to the vast underground complex. All undead therein would be trapped, at least for a while.

Our next move is to try and make our way on foot to an old temple to the side of the main Necropolis entrance, find our way through it, drop into the belly of the large pyramid behind and place the runes on four central chamber walls within. We then need to portal out somehow (noting that magical wards prevented us from doing that earlier, when we stole the temple plans at Oketra's temple), back to the Navigator, to make our escape.

The plan is, to say the least, extremely dangerous!

We have made it across the river via the temple to Kefnet, encountering other frightened dissidents along the way. Samut has vowed to save them all.

On this side of the river the buildings are rather different. The large dam of Kefnet's temple provides channels, canals and pressure to allow for water features (!) on many but it seems heavily damaged here, more than the other side. Samut said that this was where a lot of the main fighting happened - it all started around here. Our first goal is to get to Hazaret's temple, which is on this side of the river. Ronas' temple will be first on the far bank, then the swamp areas, then Hazaret, the final temple of the trials, closest to the Necropolis.

Getting to around Ronas' temple is easy, but beyond that is the marsh. We're travelling through remnants of what seem to be parks, or reserves; marshes from upriver seem to have nearby managed reserves, where more trees were. Samut warns us that there are many trees (dead or otherwise), much undergrowth, general destruction; lots of wandering undead are likely. There are other routes, but this one is where we are the least likely to encounter Eternals.

We must let Samut lead - step where she steps, she says. "This is my terrain". Gnog reaches that "I really like this person" stage, as he often does with people so dedicated, passionate, competent, yet still emotional and understandable. We have to stay within 30ft at one point - she casts Pass Without A Trace. Gnog sees her in her element here; not a dissident rebel leader, not the one trying to hold things together because she must; here, a ranger, trained to look after a small group.

The pace is kept diligently. The dice gods are kind - and our guide is skilled. We encounter no trouble. Gnog notices remnants of what was once a beautiful, lush paradise; we saw some of it from the sphinxes; Taz mentions that he think recognises some of it. There are still intact waterfalls and streams. Occasionally, there is a shock as we turn corners to encounter - ah, just a statue, but huge and of a cobra. Quite a few dead animals - some by battle, some apparently undead! It seems the Curse does not just affect humanoids.

Samut sighs; "Now, my magic is not going to work to protect us in the marsh - it's no match for alligators!" we ask if she recommends going around or through; through, she thinks. She recommends we draw our blades and drag them at our sides in the water, so that things getting near will hit them. Fee-Ree also has her staff. Taz is fine in the depth of water we'll be pushing through - at times, he's under water, but says he's fine it - doesn't need to breathe and has darkvision (blindvision).

Samut, Taz, Gnog, Fee-Ree and Deni in order.

Taz holds his longsword *up*, in the end, so we can see where he is, as it sticks up above the surface. Survival check with adv and PWOT still on:

* Taz 15
* Gnog 19
* Fee-Ree nat 20 + something
* Deni 17 + mod

We're OK (DC 15). Areas of the marsh have walkways and arches. Stone sinkholes in places have water draining down, apparently connecting to the Bontu temple in the middle of the river. A natural gas, rotting smell in places. Smokey, smoggy fires burn in places - as we saw on the way down in the boat.

About half way, Fee-Ree sends a thought out - her staff - "Head's up! Something's coming!" - Taz perception only 3+6 total; Gnog with disadv due to smoke, nat 1 -> 10, so we see nothing! Deni shouts, "To the right!" a moment later; about 15ft away, several big crocodiles converging, one especially large which looks like it's going to attack under the water.

Gnog attacks with disadvantage and hits the big one, and the axe flares with radiant light - ah, it's undead! - with a big 31 damage. The water is lit up briefly and we can see the silhouette of a large, fat crocodile, which must've been taken by the curse. Deni gets the dirk in too; Fee-Ree can't do much except hold out the staff to fend them off; Taz hits too, with Booming Blade under the water, for 18 damage. The crocodile is briefly stunned, but then moves again; there's another boom as the secondary thunder damage hits it; only 12, but it's enough and the creature stops, sinking down to the bottom. Samut is slicing through what we now see to actually be not-undead alligators, but Gnog sees undead nearby and attacks one - another 31 damage - then the second, crit! - for an utterly crazy **79 damage** which is only just below his highest ever. The alligator is eviscerated! It turns to dust. Fee-Ree simply hits the other one over the head with her stick - and that's enough!

There's a pensive moment... Gnog disadv perception 16, Taz 18; no other movement; Fee-Ree's staff is quiet; we think we're clear. Samut thinks to us - "Press on before someone notices! At least these tall reeds help hide us."

The end of the swamp is in sight - and what a welcome sight it is! We do pass near the end, though, a strange almost pagan shrine. Samut thinks, "That's very odd..." They don't have things like this in Naktamun! Deserves investigation. We go over; these are shrines to Ronas, but we are in Bontu's grounds now. They should be crocodiles; or if for Ronas they'd be cobras, but these aren't. There's some fresh blood nearby. "This is very unusual..." thinks Samut, Gnog religion check - nat 20+1 - a flashback; the serpent hills, naga. But - wrong planet. Gnog thinks, "No mistaking it. This is the Toril naga religion. I don't understand and this isn't an archeology mission... We need to leave right now."

* **Fee-Ree thinks back - "Yuan-Ti? But what are they doing here? Are they related?" and Samut thinks, "Oh - could this be a people who have managed to escape unnoticed this entire time by hiding in swamps?" - a common ancestry? Sphinxes indicated that Amonkhet is a very old world; magic has had time to kind of decay here. Perhaps *this* is an origin world, that giants and dragons fled, looking for a more verdant home, finding Ravnica and maybe Toril; or perhaps this is just another in a chain of such worlds. No way to know, and interesting, but Gnog again reminds everyone - "But not friendly people! Fresh blood!"**

Fee-Ree isn't worried about these people given we've had Taz's feast this time, but we should make it through the swamp as quickly as we can. Onward to Hazaret's temple - hopefully less hostile. 

At the swamp exit, after some Prestidigitation to clean up and dry out, there is another city section to cross in order to reach Hazaret's temple, now clearly visible. Samut recommends back streets this time. She hugs backs of buildings, near the river, darting around. We keep close and don't look around much so we don't see many things going on in the surrounding city. We reach the temple grounds really quickly; but the fastest way by far to get beyond this temple is to go across it - through the pyramid, since it's giant if we wanted to go around - but the only way is a main entrance, very exposed up two flights of stairs.

We decide to bluff it. We're quite clean and dry, if a little tattered from battle. Taz minor illusions an amphora again and Gnog carries him, weapons hidden. Hoods are up.

Nobody around. We reach the doorway. Gnog looks over his shoulder... The whole area is quieter. Gnog thinks, "Very quiet here. Not sure I like that." There is activity further back with a glint of Lazotep, amassed, but not nearby. He asks Taz to detect magic on the door, using his wand. There's both a ward and an illusion. The inside of the temple is NOT empty; that's an illusion. There's a ward on this side of the platform too, designed to discourage people from coming in. A subconscious suggestion. Taz asks if Gnog can just "put the amphora on the ground just inside the door". Taz can now see inside. People huddled. Little tents. A stronghold! Some are injured but being tended to; a few guards even; we're being watched. Weapons drawn. Taz thinks to the group, "Get in quickly, don't be seen outside, but as soon as you come in raise your arms" - and he does that, dropping the illusion.

Taz persuasion 28 from his actions. "We don't mean harm! We are in disguise!" - Samut throws back her hood. Once again, gasps. It's her thing! We're hurried away from the entrance.

There is a main grounds area with a water feature that's being used as a water source now. There's almost a tent city around the edges of this huge pyramid. Steps lead up in a central area with an empty seat where we presume Hazaret would've sat normally. A top area has remained clear, out of respect, but the rest is a refugee city of sorts.

Their magic is being exhausted by keeping up the illusion, food is low, we hear; what is going on? Can we help? Only a few days left. They've had weeks to try and think of ways to get everyone out - really, they see the river as their only route. Evacuation via Kefnet's bridges and temple might be possible were it not for the jungle and marsh in the way; people wouldn't make it through. Upriver or away from the river are just more eternals and eventually desert beyond the Hekma, with no direct route back to safety with e.g. Samut's dissidents. A long way around. Less risky perhaps but still a long shot. The best option would be the river, but how do you get this many people across and get them across unnoticed? There are some bridges, but trying to use illusion magic would be unlikely to succeed unless they were only very casually observed and there was a lot of luck, otherwise there'd be a good chance of setting escapees running "through" the illusion (which is only really convincing if viewed from the correct angle anyway; it's like a big painting on a canvas, hanging in front of whatever you want to obscure; from the far side of the river, or very far to the sides - up and down river - it would be ineffective).

What about the Yuan Ti? On Toril, dangerous and unfriendly. Here? Hiding in swamps; unnoticed. They must know the swamps well. Maybe the jungle beyond too? It's less dangerous in any case; but would they help? Can they? Perhaps they hate the Eternals too and an accord could be made, with an agreement perhaps to ensure their future in the marshes?

### It's around 20:30 Ravnican, awake 9.5 hours

Gnog thinks it might be worth going back the short distance to the shrine and spend *some* time trying to find or convince these people to show themselves. Deni points out that there would be issues not just with finding them, but with possibly fighting if they are aggressive, with speaking their language and probably need to be split up if we're going to cover more ground. We're burning resources too.

It is a polite way of saying we should stay on mission. We probably have to choose one thing. And Gnog agrees, if there's one thing that's more important, it's the necropolis.

We have to bid farewell. The temple viziers can contact Samut magically if they have a plan which needs the dissidents to help, e.g. a distraction, resources, whatever.

Beyond the temple, it's mostly ruins - and crawling with Eternals. It's part of the extended assembly grounds, pretty much. We figure it might be possible then, albeit also not without risk, to follow the river bank, hugging buildings to try and keep out of sight from both river and assembled army. Tricky but possible. At least Hazaret's temple extends out in the river so we get good access and it gives more insight into how the people at the temple were planning on maybe making an escape.

River below, Eternals above; our disguises are probably not going to be much use anymore but we keep them on anyway since we're entering an ancient temple outside the Necropolis. Adv stealth all round, with +10 for PWAT

* Gnog 12+9+10 -> 31
* Taz 14+5+10 -> 29
* Fee-Ree 16+2+10 -> 28
* Deni 10+17!+10 -> 37

Not bad! We aren't noticed and leave no trace of our passing. We make it to the edge of the city and now face the giant gates. Again, it's the melancholy of faded beauty. The best way to describe it would've been a beautiful decoration - slabs of rowan, with white ivory, alabaster and marble, scenes of a paradise afterlife - as a symbol of promise... But now, betrayal.

Our option here is to go around the vast anchoring towers - Eternals everywhere - so, no. There's the boat, but we'd be padding upstream and easily spotted. Swimming is an option but dangerous. Instead, Deni has a ritual - water breathing! We can *walk* underneath, with our eyes peeled for undead dangers. Ten minutes later her ritual spell is complete. We walk to the edge and submerge, swimming under the gate, which only extends a short way under the water - we don't even need to make our way around to its open edge. The river is depressingly devoid of any fish. Murky waters. Undead wander around in the murk - we make haste! We have to be wary of crocodiles too, obviously, but encounter none - until Taz spots something *really* large only about 100ft away and urges us towards the bank. We go as fast as we can into the shallows and reed beds. 

The marshes here are similar to those at Bontu's temple, on the outside of the wide sweeping turn in the Luxa, where silt is deposited, before it enters the city via the gates.

We can see the old ruined temple, once Samut points it out. We stay in the reed beds for cover as much as we can. Gnog, perception 27. Another pagan-style altar! Similar to before. Yuan Ti. Samut is alarmed by that - how can there be so many of these things; and it's out here, beyond the Hekma. It looks old too - but in use. Old but revived? We can't dwell, but it raises even more questions. Surely, we are being observed by these hidden people right now.

To get to the old temple, we have to now cut onto land, passing some very unusual looking burial grounds. Samut is again surprised; nobody buries their dead - they don't stay buried! The Curse must only affect things passing from life to death - things already dead didn't just rise up. So, this is ancient; and we look more closely and yes, it's old. It's a cemetery and has familiarity to us, but Samut has never seen anything like this - in her world, you don't bury the dead so they can rise up and attack you!

We move on. We reach a kind of crypt but larger. Looks like a small necropolis. Gnog survival 16. It's enough to realise that someone's been here quite recently - in and out. Deni asks if she should look inside; yes, especially if by mouse! In it goes. Full of jars... Ah! A crematorium. So, someone right now - alive or undead under instruction - is bringing in hopefully-dead things to burn so that they don't rise. It's quite a complex, with stairs leading down to underground caverns. The fact that the front door is in use suggests that there's no risk of a further underground connection to the wider necropolis. Samut has honed in on the tracks of people coming here. "Ha. Definitely naga." - obvious when pointed out, slithering and scale scrape. It could be this world's "known" naga or perhaps that nearby Yuan Ti shrine is in use because they burn their dead to prevent the Curse and use this facility "on the quiet".

Unfortunately, the tracks lead us to the very same old temple that we were hoping to use as a side entrance. Our options are this or the huge gates, so not much of a choice - we have to risk it and enter this old temple, apparently in recent, active use by naga.

Samut shows that the tracks head to a walled courtyard of sorts at the side of the temple. Stone walls, about 15ft high, slight lean in (narrowing at the top); we find a door. This is the entrance *they* use. We keep following around to see if we can find another one. Deni uses her slippers to just walk up the wall and peek over the top. She comes back down and tells us that behind the wall, it opens out into the temple; any other doors in the courtyard wall would be the same anyway. Beyond that we find steps down into some kind of cellar, so we start there.

The door is jammed. Old. Not been used. There's a chain but the lock is rusted up. Gnog considers breaking it but then Deni remembers she has an acid vial from way back. "I've been wanting to try this!" - digs around in her pack but can't find it. Lots of poison. Gnog checks. "Maybe we sold them?" and Taz chips in, "But I can do that! Find me a rock!" so Gnog finds a bit of nearby stone and Taz use Performance Of Creation to turn it into a vial of strong acid. Deni tells Taz to "do the honours" so he pours it on. The rusted corrodes away quickly; the metal itself is clean and bright but isn't melted, so Deni does have to chip away and get at the lock to break its insides. With Gnog's help she's then able to uncoil the chain quietly. She says, "After you!" and Gnog (athl 25) pulls the very stiff door open - cringing at the creaking noises. Stale air blows out; distant smell of fresh air behind, curiously. Taz wanders in and looks around - "coast is clear!" so he puts up dancing lights and in we go. Gnog pulls the door shut (again cringing at the creaking).

Samut is skulking in the rear watching for trouble, a bit like Deni. Taz is in the lead. These low tunnels aren't on the blueprints, but investigation 19+13, 32! He follows that fresh air current. It's like catacombs down here; a series of confusing tunnels, but he walks through them with confidence, as if he'd lived his whole life here and knew them well. Eventually up ahead he sees a flicker of firelight and holds us back, pointing it out. Asks Deni if she can send the mouse (and takes down the dancing lights).

The mouse scuttles forwards. A large, circular room is ahead. We note that the architecture here isn't all pyramids and trapezoids; this is very curvy. Arches, ovals, all that. Large stones appear to have been arranged here in a big circle with a large pit in the middle. The room is maybe 80-90ft in diameter. The pit is 60ft-70ft across. Above, a slightly domed ceiling, with a flat top, very humid air - there's actually damp on the top of the stonework. No holes in the ceiling. The pit below though - when the mouse looks - is full of snakes! It retreats quickly. Back to the group then; looks we have to circumnavigate the snake pit, without them attacking, somehow. We approach cautiously to see how the snakes react. Fee-Ree notices a warning from her staff - *something* in the room. Danger there.

We head in, with weapons drawn. Fee-Ree's staff is glowing brightly. In amongst the pit of writhing snakes, movement and sound; slithering; then rising out, quickly, a number of naga. They appear to be hostile. They speak and Taz takes a few seconds to cast Comprehend Languages. Catches the tail end - "...trespassers in the nursery! Food for the young ones!" so Taz says, "basically, this is a nursery and they've decided we are food. I don't think I can persuade our way out of this..."

We figure we should at least *try* and make a run for it for starters. As we go for it, the naga leap out onto the sides of the pit to block our escape. The ones who leapt out have snake heads but human bodies while the ones below approaching more slowly have a human head and arms but snake bodies - so that's definitely more Yuan Ti. Taz tries, saying - in Common - "if you're the Yuan Ti of the swamps here, we wanted to try and broker a deal, we don't want to fight!" - persuasion 22 + BFS only 23. They do hesitate, briefly; then a larger one in the middle of the pit moves forward. "Lay down your weapons and we will take you to the mother and *she* can decide your fate." We try stowing them in the bag of holding, but they insist we *give* the weapons to them. At least Gnog has a backup or two - *leap of faith* - we hand them over.

We are ushered through tunnels to another larger chamber. Gnog, perception 18. We see more of this complex. There's a room where Gnog hears sounds of people in distress / weakness, but it's dark; all he can hear is the sound. This is *not* good. Another room, big hunks of meat arrayed out - preparing food, and Gnog has a sinking feeling that he knows what that food is.

A larger room. We're told to hand over all belongings and to wait. Gnog refuses - "You've got our weapons. We'll keep what else we have." Persuasion 25. They still insist. Gnog says to the group, "it was worth a punt, but I dunno if you noticed they seem to have captive people, and I think they're eating them? Don't think we're going to find allies here and while I can stand the loss of weapon or two, we can't stand the loss of everything. I think we might have to fight our way out, and it's going to be messy. Sorry."

They draw their weapons in this waiting room area. We're quite heavily screwed, with very few people who can truly fight.

Initiative:

* Deni (no drawn weapons, just hidden daggers) 25
* Samut (no weapons) 23
* Gnog (no greataxe, but longbow and javelin in BoH) 12
* Taz (no weapons) 8
* Fee-Ree (no staff) 6
 
Deni reaches into her boot and pulls a dagger. She tries to get insight on one of the five nearby aggressors which surround us, and succeeds; so she moves around to attack with some flanking advantage and hits, dealing a small amount of non-magical damage from the weapon - but the usual bevy of sneak damage. 43 overall. She stands ready for an opportunity attack.

All Samut can try is an unarmed strike, but is near the Yuan Ti with her weapons so tries to grapple to get them back. She gets a hit (20), grapples - contested athl is 30 - and gets back both of her weapons. With a bonus action, she casts Hunters Mark on that same Yuan Ti.

Gnog rages. He tries to grab Fee-Ree's staff and Taz's rapier from the nearby Yuan Ti - it has his axe too, but he can grab both lighter weapons. Non-reckless unarmed strike was only 16, but it was enough; athl was 22 vs 18. Gnog passes both weapons back to Taz behind and Fee-Ree to his left; he waits for them to take the weapons. The Yuan Ti is of course not grappled now and Gnog can't opportunity attack until at least one hand is free.

That same Yuan Ti attacks - it tries a constrictor attack, trying to coil around Gnog, but he dodges out of the way. But then it casts Suggestion: "Run!" - adv wisdom saving thanks to the Feast; 25, he resists. It speaks in its own language, some kind of snake language; Taz hears - it's calling to its children and Taz says, "It's calling for backup!" and grabs the rapier off Gnog. He mulls Silence but that'd cripple Fee-Ree and besides, it already called out; so he Hexblades Curses it, but *without* booming blade hits with the rapier for only 1+7->8 damage. Bardic inspiration to Fee-Ree in case she gets fucked up by all the Yuan Ti around!

Crawling up from between flagstones, we now see lots of small snakes. A writhing mat forms all around Gnog and Taz. The first cluster of snakes trying to attack Gnog crit hit, surprising him, 14->7 piercing but no poison thanks to the Feast - we're immune. The other goes for Taz but he's seen it coming and they miss him - they almost seem confused too; it's all made of metal, where do you bite?!

Fee-Ree grabs her staff, but decides to breathe fire - Gnog's in the firing line, "Gnog! Jump!" she shouts and out it goes. Gnog makes his dex save. "Thanks Fee-Ree - it was a bit chilly on this desert planet with only two suns, I needed warming up!" 20->10->5 damage. The two big Yuan Ti in the firing line avoid it too, unfortunately, but the swarm of snakes under Gnog bears full brunt.

The Yuan-Ti that Deni had attacked tries to move forward to get Fee-Ree and this triggers Deni's opportunity attack - crit! It falls. "Gnog! One for me! What are you on?" (Gnog just sighs heavily, yearning for his axe!)

The pit master rears up and its hands turn into snakes. It looks at us all and breathes out a wave of some kind of magical attempt to make us sleep. DC13 con saves or fall into a magical sleep! No help from Heroes Feast for that. Gnog, Taz, Fee-Ree all succeed; Deni too - but distressingly, Samut falls. The creature then starts to back away, but some weird spectral fangs spring forth, going for Fee-Ree; it hits, but has no effect (immune to poison). Taz hears it say, "Impossible! They feel no effects of the venom!" - and another now steps forward to try and coil around Fee-Ree, constricting her; it misses (nat 1); she bats it away with the staff. Now it draws two scimitars to attack her - again though both miss.

Now one attacks Gnog intending to bite and would hit but he activates the wings. Now it tries Suggestion again: "Tiredness". Crappy rolls on the adv wisdom save but makes 15 against DC 13.

Deni sneaks around behind the attacker in Fee-Ree's face and tries to read it; she just manages. She attacks with flanking advantage using her dagger still, hitting for a total of 41 (of note - both this and her prior damage total were quite low; no less than 24 d6s have been rolled without a single 6!). She uses the remainder of her movement to get behind the pit master.

Gnog wants his axe back. Hits (30) with unarmed strike, athl roll only 21 - he grabs it (vs 19), both hands. That's his full action. He whispers to the axe "This'll be our little secret, don't tell Ajani that I gave you to the nasty snake man".

Nasty snake man tries two scimitar attacks. Miss, hit; 8->4 damage. It tries to constrict and wings have to be used to stop it. Taz moves out of the pool of snakes a little bit so at least he's not stood in the middle of them, which try but miss an opportunity attack (turns out reach is zero ft) then attacks "nasty snake man" back, hitting but once again only rolls a 1 on the d8 for 8 total damage.

The pool of snakes around Gnog attack but miss; the other pool moves back to around Taz anyway and attack, but they miss.

Fee-Ree goes for Shocking Grasp on the Yuan-Ti Deni attacked recently. Hits. 4d8->just 14 damage. It's still up. The pit master now acts, and becomes invisible! Deni shouts, "It vanished!" More attacks on Fee-Ree now; she has to use wings once, but all attacks ultimately fail. Gnog is next to be assailed; hit - 8->4, miss, bite misses.

Deni can't see the other creature so comes back to attack the one near Fee-Ree; she takes it down; shouts "Gnog, that's two!" then takes her weapons back - bow and dirk. She yells at Samut - "Wake up!" - and throws her dagger hilt-first at Samut's head! It hits and Samut awakens. Samut doesn't waste time - runs near Gnog but this happens to go past the pit master, who blows his invisibility via an attack of opportunity - and it misses. Samut goes for Nasty Snake Man near Gnog, hitting no less than *four* times including an off-hand attack. 13, 9, 13, 11 - 46; it falls. Gnog says, "There, you see? The nasty snake man is gone" to the axe.

Gnog risks opportunity attacks to get into an advantageous flanking position with the pit master. The snakes on the ground miss but the other Yuan Ti hits with a bite, doing 2 piercing and he's immune to any poison. Two attacks on the pit master, with flank advantage. Hits twice; 11 and 17 damage. Second wind - 1d4+1 -> only 5hp gained.

Taz steps away (again) from the snakes which this time manage to get in a bite, 2 piercing, attacks the last lower level Yuan-Ti; all it, for 10+13+11->34 damage. Snakes that were on the ground after Gnog now move to annoy Fee-Ree, but miss; the ones that were on Taz now head to Samut but again miss. Fee-Ree spends a sorcery point to try and Shocking Grasp each of the two snake swarms since they're under foot and within reach. Both grasps work, reaching at least one snake and spreading the electrical damage amongst the swarm. A high 22 damage total to both, leaving none under her but a few are still going for Samut.

The pit master tries Hold Person on Deni. Advantage from both Heroes Feast and being near to Gnog and the axe aura - whichever it was (advantages not stacking up, of course) - the spell fails. Annoyed, the pit master tries to bite her quickly - three times, in quick succession. Crit (sigh) for 7 piercing (no poison as usual); miss; miss. The Yuan-Ti on Samut tries to attack; its swords and bite all miss.

Deni's eyes narrow, recognising that she's reading the pit master - she says, "Let's see you try and eat people without a stomach!" - and with her retrieved dirk, cuts right down through its abdomen. Euw. That's dark, even for Deni. After prior low damage rolls, the universe balances - *57* points of damage. Astonishingly, it stays up - JUST - and she calls, "Gnog! Take it down!". Meanwhile, Samut retaliates, getting another two swift hits on the Yuan-Ti next to her; it falls; the other two are aimed at the snakes around her feet and finish those off, too.

Gnog says, "You should've just heard us out, without any of the bullshit!". He hits twice, 31 damage; the creature falls.

But now, he apologises; he shouldn't have been so trusting. Giving away our weapons was folly. Never again. But worse problem - he heard people in distress. If we rescue them, we might end up taking on the whole temple and besides, where do we take them? If we leave them, we've crossed the line - sacrificing knowingly the few for the many. We go back. Past the room with meat, Samut dispatches two Yuan Ti - butchers - and we can now see clearly that these were people.

Shit. No choice. Gnog looks to Fee-Ree. "Can't lose ourselves, I guess."

We continue retracing steps to where Gnog heard the noises, as quiet as we can, hoping not to meet any more Yuan-Ti. Samut has been collecting weapons to try and arm anyone we rescue. Taz looks into the dark room. Huddled, about a dozen people in cages. He says, "Fuck this" and walks in to cast Dancing Lights, then calling "Deni..." - there's confusion - Gnog says, "please, keep quiet, we're going to try and get the cages open, but escape from this place will be difficult."

Deni picks the locks deftly. These people aren't weak or sick, though two are a bit injured. Samut asks how this happened. They'd fled - ran from the city when the Hekma fell - they saw things they thought were just "normal" Naga, so ran to them for help but were captured. Half of them are already gone. They know what's been happening. They are being kept well-fed. Back, then; the snake pit might have more to kill but most of them were with us, with our weapons, and now gone. So we usher everyone back, Taz in the lead, as quick as we can. One guard; Taz uses Eldritch Blasts, Fee-Ree a firebolt and one arrow from Deni are enough. Fee-Ree has a grim look on her face. "Very well..." she says. She empties an entire flask of lamp oil into the pit and sets it aflame. *Everyone* is dark today. I guess Fee-Ree in particular is very over Yuan-Ti. The lesser evil against Bolas, but evil all the same.

Reopen the side door, show them out and arm them. Samut explains that if they can make it across the river somehow, then they should head to the Northern edge, look for the houses with a particular sign on - which she draws in the sand - and wait for evacuation. They don't think any others are inside, so we wish them luck and head back inside. We leave the side door open - if undead wander in, so much the better.

Taz consults the necropolis map. The connection to the old temple tunnels is shown, at the level we're on. Investigation adv 28. He follows the way it shows - implication is that we can be *underneath* everything to get to the central columns or walls.

Taz, Deni - for mouse, Gnog, Fee-Ree, Samut. We take 10 minutes for Deni's telepathy ritual too.

We stumble across a main corridor that the blueprints show lead to a central chamber of worship in the old temple. Some adjunct chambers appear to connect too. We can either take the main corridor or one of those service corridors. While speed would be good, the words "take you to mother" ringing in the ears would mean that she's probably in that central chamber and walking directly in front-ways would be a bit obvious. We opt for the side chambers.

There's what might be a brood chamber. We can hear slithering and voices in the room. There must be many in there; Deni listens carefully - she thinks that it sounds like at least 6 or 7 distinct voices in there, including - thinks a while, listens more - some louder or deeper sounds. Fee-Ree says, "These are so evil... If we could take them out, it would make..." and Gnog interrupts the thought, "...yes, I know, we just have to make it to those four walls, and don't forget to keep a big spell back for escaping, but why not do some good along the way..." Fee-Ree adds "Garren would want us to stop them" and Gnog says "Low blow! Ouch. But yes. Of course he would. He'd never turn away from a fight with evil no matter what. I say I just push this door open and we run in?" There is agreement. We get prepared.

Gnog opens the door. We burst into the room.

Initiative:

* Gnog 22
* Samut 20
* Taz 16
* Fee-Ree 11
* Deni 6

It's a frightening sight inside. A brood chamber; sloping down, recessed areas, lots of pillows and lounge areas, riches around surprisingly, very humid. Two *large* snake headed - cobra - muscular arms and torsos, 9ft long coiled up but already holding scimitars. Abominations, probably. Sat in the middle, two unusual creatures. Not snake headed, almost human, but snake-like features. Painted eye makeup, Cleopatra-style; coloured hair, dyed with blood by the looks of it. Lounging around. Two guards, by the looks of it; human bodies, snake heads; weapons already drawn. A seventh, as Deni suspected - coiled up cobra, human torso but somewhat shrivelled, also lounging. Bodyguards all round given the already-drawn weapons, perhaps, for the three lounging.

Gnog rages again and rage-flies over the heads 10ft up all the way to the back where the big guys are, attacking one from above at the limit of his range. No opp attacks. He recklessly attacks the big snake at the back, swinging twice; maximum 20 and 17 damage, 37 total, no radiant flares though. He says, "Surprise!"
 
Samut dashes up to a nearer, smaller guard and attacks (3 times since her 4-times thing was down to a feat that required other people nearby and there aren't any right now). All three make it, albeit only just. 14, 13, 9 -> 36 damage. It looks on the edge of death but does still stand.

The other large abomination flanks Gnog and attacks. A scimitar swings close but *just* misses; next misses too; a third hits. No wings, Gnog wants to assess how hard they hit before blowing that kind of resource. 12->6, OK, so not too bad.

The two painted people get up. One tries to cast Fear on everyone in the doorway. But the Feast means we are immune to that, just like poison; no effect at all. This frightens the other one. It casts Darkness, covering the whole area. Only Taz can see now. Taz calls, "It cast darkness, turned into a snake and is heading towards the entrance".

In the dark, the abomination that Gnog went for - cannot see either, so it attacks Gnog flat, recklessness and flanking advantage negated. Constriction is attempted, but as Gnog feels it start to coil he triggers his wings. Now it tries for a bite but that misses.

Taz uses the Mizzium Apparatus to dispel the darkness successfully, then gives Gnog bardic inspiration, the moves into the corner of the room to get a better view.

The injured guard by Samut attacks her back. It hits a couple of times for 11 damage.

"Samut, I hope you can duck" shouts Fee-Ree and throws L4 fireball. It'll get just about every bad guy, actually missing Samut and Gnog *just*, but does miss the abomination that Gnog first tackled, since it is in the farthest corner of the room. Potential damage: 9d6 -> with re-roll, 41. Good rolls. The guard by Samut is hit badly and taken down immediately. The other guard takes full damage and is almost down itself. The abomination behind Gnog also takes 41. The two painted creatures turn out to have magic resistance, one fails, taking 41 again so is very badly injured; the other snake-form one succeeds but the snake form is lost and it returns to its normal shape. The seated cobra-headed creature also only takes 20, dodging the worst. **204 points of damage!**

The second guard looks around - it can't reach Fee-Ree but it spots Taz and recklessly runs in to attack; a bite glances off his casing but a claw does 5 damage and another does 6 damage. And after doing very little, the strange shrivelled cobra-headed creature that was sat down rears up, then starts to cast something very elaborate in the air; the pattern it draws becomes somewhat hypnotic. Wisdom (adv, from Feast) saves for Taz (nat 20 - saves), Fee-Ree saves and Deni just makes it too. So now, it strikes out with the same strange spectral fangs we saw before, going for Samut; misses; so now it turns into a smaller snake itself, trying to escape.

Deni moves forward, reads the escaping snake and attacks; she hits, doing a very solid 59 damage. The snake form collapses and the creature that replaces it is already dead. Deni darts into a corner.

Gnog continues his assault on the abomination, recklessly. He hits twice, for 28.

Samut calls out "Gnog, are you fine?" and Gnog says, "Yeah, no problem" - just two Large hardy creatures flanking! - so she runs up to the two painted people, first attacking the more injured one twice; hits twice but tries Favoured Foe on it to try and finish the job and that's enough - 30 damage. It drops. Her third attack goes to the other one, hitting for 14 damage. She has enough movement to make it to the one next to Taz and her final blow hits that one too, for 13 - it drops as well. She shouts, "Two for one! Beat that everyone!"

The abomination behind Gnog sees this going down and tries to head to Samut, so Gnog reacts with Sentinel - the hit lands true, doing 14 damage and halting it its tracks - so it responds by just attacking Gnog back. It's not technically flanking due to the movement it *did* manage to make, but Gnog was reckless anyway. This huge thing rears up, darkness emanates from it - it casts Fear. Of course, no effect; the Feast protects us. It didn't know that. It looks confused. Taz hears the remaining painted person ("Nightmare Speaker") say in exasperation "I told you! They're not afraid of us!" and it makes him laugh. The abomination looks angrily at Taz, turns to Gnog, then projects words mentally - "You might not fear, but it doesn't mean there's nothing in your nightmares!" and projects an image into Gnog's mind of Amonkhet, falling. Members of the party die around him. There's a vision of the gate with Ravnica beyond crumbling too, as Bolas sweeps through the city demolishing everything. Then he sees Gnog holding a dead Deni, Fee-Ree lying dead alongside, Taz shattered into pieces. Fortunately for Gnog, the axe provides advantage on this magical effect; his saving throw DC13 is 11,20 total, so he makes it. Gnog responds with, "Now *that's* not funny. Once I've finished with this one, *you're next*." He's quite pissed off by that; but the response is surprising - "It has a weakness!" responds the Yuan-Ti, "Attack the young ones! The small ones! Destroy them! That's what it fears!"

The abomination Gnog had been focusing on now rushes up to Deni, Gnog having already used his reaction. It tries to constrict her, and would succeed beyond the ability of even her wings to save her, but Taz throws Silvery Barbs - *just* within range - which makes it miss. He gives Deni the advantage from the spell. It ties to bite, too, but that misses as well because this time her wings block it. Gnog shouts after it - "I might care deeply for 'the small ones' but I wouldn't underestimate them if I were you..."

Thinking it'd help to further reduce the number of opponents in the room, Taz throws eldritch blasts at the remaining Speaker. All three hit, dealing 34 damage. It looks very badly injured. Fee-Ree shouts, "Leave my friends alone!" and casts L3 fireball to catch the three remaining assailants, avoiding everyone else in the process. 8d6 -> with re-roll, 27, just over half way. The nightmare speaker is taken out, failing to avoid the full damage. The large guards both take all damage too; the one by Deni now very injured, close to the edge. And now it's Deni's turn.

Deni gains insight, drops the bow and draws the dirk. She hits, for an OK 48 damage and it falls.

Gnog turns and says, "See? Told you." and attacks recklessly. Hit, crit! He does 11 and 37 damage, which is enough to take it down. Gnog calls to Deni, "That big thing counts as two. But you got one as well, so you're still in the lead."

We look around. All the beautiful furnishings, carpets, throw pillows, even tapestries... They're all burned to a cinder by the fireballs. Fee-Ree says, "Oops." Some metallic objects are left; but we figure it's not time for this, even Deni agrees, so we continue quickly to proceed towards that target room and dash away, Gnog holding his rage for now. Taz asks why we're running and Fee-Ree coughs a bit - Deni says, "Two loud fireballs? Whoever is in this room knows something is up!"

We burst into the main temple. Here is the sanctuary for "mother", or perhaps a better translation might have been "matron".

There are two of the medium sized snake bodies, human torso creatures; and two that are the other way around. Two more abominations. All are guards, flanking a huge-sized coiled serpent with *six* snake heads. A silk and gold-scaled dress covers a human-like upper body, a very large cobra head is central with five other snake heads around it, different kinds of snakes.

"Well, *that's* not one I've seen on Toril" says Gnog, looking to Samut.

Initiative:

* Fee-Ree 22
* Gnog 20
* Taz 18
* Samut 15
* Deni 13

Fee-Ree squeezes past Taz to get through the doorway and sees the room. For once, all the bad guys seem grouped fairly close together around the 'throne' and no other party members are fighting in the middle of it - has this ever happened before?!

L5 fireball o'clock! She speeds up the spell, too, with 2 sorcery points. 10d6 -> with re-roll -> 48 potential, very high. Both abominations take 48, along with both snake-head, human-body naga, both of the human-headed creatures and, finally, the big six-head "mother" or matron succeeds against the spell effect, taking 24. **312 points of damage**

**But there is a wild magic surge** - nat 1 -> wild magic surge table time. She's high enough level to try and steer the outcome a little (rolls twice and chooses preferred option). "Controlled chaos". 38, 22. There's a rip in reality that appears and briefly, four flumphs start to appear through (38), but then it twists - she's seen their magic resistance; 22 means that this is cancelled out, so they'll have to roll flat for saving in the next spell she casts.

Fee-Ree isn't done. She'd quickened the spell. She targets the two constrictor naga (snake lower body) with firebolts, hitting both, 4d10 each time; 29 to one, 32 to the other - very high rolls. That's enough to take them both down.

**373 points of damage** in a single round.

Gnog can see her tire visibly, leaning on her staff, especially from reigning into the wild magic; he's concerned for her, but at the same time, just astonished at the damage dealt. And then in our heads - "NOT MY CHILDREN! How dare you! I'll wipe you off the face of this planet and feed you into a million more!"

It's Gnog's turn. He runs up to face the big one, an abomination and one snake-head creature, which is badly injured - seems like cutting down the numbers might help. So, he swings at that one, and caution be damned, recklessness is chaos - he adds in the bardic, though (looked like 7 TBH but digital roll said 3) gets 3 points extra thunder damage; it's fuck all but at least they all take it. Very low damage rolls on his two hits too, a 13 and a 10. It takes down the creature, leaving only four, but big four!

Taz comes in behind Fee-Ree, just managing to squeeze in. The matron is huge and clearly visible, so he tries his luck with Psychic Lance. It'll be 7d6->26 damage if it works, but she has magic resistance. FUCK. She saves. Only 13 damage. A bit more bardic inspiration to Gnog, at least. Shouts, "Sorry, didn't work!"

The nearby abomination tries to run for Fee-Ree so Gnog uses Sentinel and hits if for 14 damage, stopping it its tracks.

Samut runs all the way in and reaches the "feet" of the matron, next to a remaining human-lower, snake-upper character too. She attacks the matron, hits; 13 damage, marking the matron as a favoured foe; notices the other smaller creature nearby and hits that one, hitting for 12 damage, sees it's almost down so goes for it again, doing 9 damage and dropping it; she moves between the farthest abomination and the matron now, attacking with that fourth attack, just hitting with an extra d8 for favoured foe, doing 15 damage.

Deni chooses to ignore the nearby abomination and instead read the matron, moving near Fee-Ree and Taz to get a good line of sight. She gains insight and fires, but is just about to miss - rolls a 2+13->15; Fee-Ree sees it; burns even more sorcery points to bend luck, d4->3, giving 18; and this corrects the arrow's course and it hits. 46 + 9 -> a very solid 55 points, catching it completely by surprise.

The other abomination moves forward to try and get to Fee-Ree, Deni and Taz. This gives Samut an opportunity attack which hits, tho only for 10 damage; it stops, tries Fear on the party but of course it doesn't work; at this, it changes its mind and tries to block them from seeing the matron instead turning to attack Gnog. It tries constriction first, with advantage from Gnog's prior recklessness, but this too fails (attack roll is only 13).

The matron's six heads rear up and tries a flurry of bites at Gnog. All six heads snap at him. It hits (29, wings won't help) doing 23->11 piercing damage but again, no poison damage. Then, to Gnog's surprise, it polymorphs! It changes into a huge constrictor snake. Instead of six heads, there are now six sets of arms; it tries to claw at Gnog too, hitting for 8->4 damage. Gnog looks up at it, confused, and shouts, "Huh? Is that all you've got?!" (but he realises that it has, of course, just gained a tonne of hit points).

Fee-Ree is up again. She shouts, "Gnog... Umm... You're in the middle..." and Gnog shouts back, "You know the score, I'm all good - DO IT!" - so she casts another L5 fireball right into the middle of all of us, just missing Samut. Gnog rolls 18 on his save but the DC is 19, so he fails. He'd kinda forgotten (like last time) that Fee-Ree has her bypass resistances thing going on so this is going to hurt him a lot more than he expects...! 10d6->43; Gnog takes the lot, shouts, "Ouch! Oh yeah I forgot about that resistance thing" and then kind of can't stop laughing for a while because it's so ridiculous. All the other creatures take the full damage, too! So that's something. No wild magic surge either. For a bonus action, she burns a L2 slot to get back a couple of sorcery points.

Wisdom saving throw because of an aura of fear around the matron: Saves with 28. Immune to that now. Gnog looks around; the abominations are quite injured, both of them, his previous opponent moreso; he attacks it, reckless forever. He hits twice for 13 & 16 points, taking it down. He shouts, "One less to worry about Samut!"

Taz chucks Eldritch Blasts and hits three times. The damage rolls are quite dodgy, coming to 28, but it's enough to take it out. Bardic to Samut.

Samut goes nuts on the matron. She doesn't succeed against the wisdom saving, but it doesn't matter as the fear can't take her. She gets into a flanking position; hits, crits, hits. 13, 17, 14 -> 44. Now Deni carefully aims and fires after the almost-miss last time. She hits, total damage a solid 54.

Now the matron, in snake form, tries to constrict Gnog. Crit. Oh dear, that's not good at all. Taz is too far away for Silvery Barbs. 24 bludgeoning -> 12, 9 -> 4 acid and of course he's grappled. The acid comes from the corrosive acid all over its skin. Gnog shouts, "Umm, I'm OK, but this, uuuh isn't ideal... Stings a bit..."

Fee-Ree throws a firebolt, hitting for a whopping 33 (with a very fortunate re-roll). That drops it out of its form; it's enough to put it back into its six head snake look and Gnog is dropped to the ground; dex save is only 6 and he fumbles the landing, taking 2->1 damage. "Ouch! My foot!" says Gnog. With a bonus action, Fee-Ree blows another L2 to get another couple of sorcery points.

Gnog says "That hurt my foot" and attacks with flanking advantage thanks to Samut. He hits for max 20, then jumps up and carves Ajani's greataxe in an arc tracing under the heads, seeing where Deni had hit it before and the exposed area where it has jewels instead of armour - crits for 33 - all six heads fall separately to the floor. Gnog shouts, "That counts as 6!"

Samut is in a flurry, dispatching other errant guards; we pitch in, checking over places as best we can. There might be some outlying areas that are still occupied but we've done as much as we can.

We also have to spend a while moving things into the big nursery pit. There's too much of a risk of these creatures coming back under the Curse of Wandering. When it comes to the huge matron, we have a grisly task of chopping up in order to be able to move the bulk; Deni takes advantage of that to remove any jewellery - d100 -> only 4. We recover 5 precious pieces of jewellery, which we estimate at around 2500gp value. Not too bad. We check with Samut; is she OK with us taking this? It's not part of their main religions and comes from evil, but the money might be useful for her. She points out that the wealth in Naktamun is far greater.

In the sanctuary tho we do stumble across magical stuff. We'll bag it up for now and at some convenient future point Deni can cast Identify as a ritual and we'll discover that we have found:

* An alchemy jug - this could be useful for water for Samut, or give her the decanter?
* A sentinel shield
* A magical greatsword - a cursed sword; a Greatsword of Vengeance
* In a velvet lined, ivory box, an ornate potion vial - pink with flecks of gold and iridescent swirls - a "philter of love"
* A scimitar of speed

Gnog has been eyeing up stairs behind the throne - blocked and covered poorly, but easily uncovered. We dig them out and get down to some old work tunnels. Taz checks the blueprints - these are on them. We sneak through; they're quite right, Gnog having to crouch down the whole time.

**We see early on from some kind of opening in the tunnel wall, beyond - outside, a courtyard that's in front of the main entrance. Standing there, two giant gods. In Lazotep. The penny drops - oh no. All four were killed. At least two are now raised as Eternals.**

We continue until we're under the pyramid. Deni gets Gnog to lift her up to look through another hole at the side of one tunnel. Kind of air holes, or something. She tenses up immediately; then thinks to bring her down. She thinks - "It's *full* of Eternals. Absolutely *full*." Taz looks too; he can confirm with Minor Illusion. We can see the internal structure of a pyramid; stacked layers, supported on great columns, once intended for burial but now modified. Once the Curse happened there was little use for burial chambers. These mausoleums were mostly empty - until Bolas started filling them with Eternals; under the guise of dying the exalted death in Hazaret's arena. Entire platoons stand motionless.

"That's what we're here to bury" thinks back Gnog and we continue - QUIETLY! - along the tunnels. Down, slightly and deeper and deeper in. Under the main pyramid, by blueprint. Other pyramids are built off it and structurally have a dependence, we believe, on it; but the main thing is that the front pyramid's collapse should at worst block the entrance for everything else but, at best, domino it all and collapse all of it down into these old tunnels, fully burying everything so that even the Eternal army here, if commanded, would take some time to dig itself out.

We reach the giant "reverse diamond", where triangle supports abound, with the four major supporting members clearly visible. Not four walls, really, though these main structures are giant. The whole area is empty - workers long since gone, nobody even probably aware of these basement structures. Taz starts working on the sigils, so needs arcana. He casts Enhance Ability - Fox's Cunning on himself first, to get some advantage to his arcana; check is 29. He ends up covering just about every pillar he can see, even pillars on the tunnel we took; he really goes to town, on all the main members and any others for which we have time.

Fee-Ree asks if we're ready to go. Taz thinks, "hold on" and uses his magic detection wand one more time to see if there might be interference. He detects no interference but the sigil magic he wrote is *very* strong. For caution, then, we retreat a distance into the tunnels before Fee-Ree starts on Teleport. We get close. "All right. Here goes..."

...and she casts it at L8, since L7 was spent trying to get out of Oketra's temple.

Whump!

No wild magic surge... We land just outside the ship, which is covered in half a sand dune by now after the storm. "Ah. That's why we're not inside!" she says and we spend a while digging it out. Fee-Ree says to Taz, "hey, if you need to take a rest, I can pilot us back?" and he agrees since he can reclaim some resources that way and reattune to his dulcimer. He knows she's tired too though, so he decides he'll play Song Of Rest while he's reattuning.

Gnog: "Well then, Ms Jharthraxyn: Please get us the *hell* out of here."

### It's around 21:30 Ravnican, awake 10.5 hours

Fee-Ree flies back without incident in the air. No sandstorms, no glorybringers; her bardic inspiration comes in handy when it comes to the tricky "docking" at the usual parking spot. She makes it in cleanly.

### It's around 22:30 Ravnican, awake 11.5 hours

We get back. Gnog is itching to tackle Tesseret but he already knew, it took too much to get the temple cleared out. Manesh we learn isn't there - he's taken his most loyal people away to preach at Naktamun and start spreading the word. Gnog asks Taz to try and use Sending to Hazaret, to say, "We did it; sigils placed; you can collapse the Necropolis when the time comes." Taz is delighted when there is a response, he just messaged a *god!* - ASMR style - "Well done. I always knew that you would succeed! Thank you. I will gladly lead the forces of the faithful tomorrow."

So, tomorrow it is. An assault, a distraction; an evacuation and our dash to the gate. Taz remembers to practice his resonant frequency sweep illusion a bit. We learn that the generals have been evolving the plan and have got a lot of the details filled in. A mass exodus is planned. We let them know about the few we found, as extra info.

Gnog goes to Samut. She's exhausted. He says, "You're quite something. You'd have made a really good goliath." "I will take that as a compliment, thank you" "Tomorrow's the day. Tomorrow's the day you get back Naktamun." "It will be the start."

### 8000XP each, divided equally.

Gnog asks Fee Ree if she sees "normally". Can she *see* the weave, or fortune/luck, somehow? She says that lately, she can see sometimes multiple realities ahead of her briefly; she can "tug on strings" to pull things towards her desired outcome. "I guess this is what they mean! I've only really understood this since I got to Ravnica; it's a lot clearer there; the interconnectedness of everything and now the future is not one thing, but many. I think this is what Jace sees, but he must've gotten scrambled at some point because he can't seem to tell the difference between what he's seeing, what he remembers and what is happening right now."

We head to our sleeping "room" and try to sleep. Gnog's about half way through saying, "It's going to be really hard to sleep worrying about Ravnica" but he kind of passes out, exhausted, half way through. It's 23:00 Ravnican, awake 12 hours.

## Day 58 (Ravnica 38, Riglan 94 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Sunday (7 day week) - 07:00 Ravnican

We wake up after a full eight hours of rest. Taz does some maths. He thinks we have around ten hours left on the Heroes Feast.

Gnog had dreamed of Garren, Xonthal's tower, Ajani, dragons, Bolas; Sphinxes wronged, but the song, and more. He wakes up kind of rested, but fitful sleep and the anxiety of Ravnica is strong.

* Mentions he was thinking of dancing at the inn Xonthals' Tower. "Happier times!", says Deni.
* Not so. Sure, he's confused feelings about Garren - stronger might've developed after his death, who knows; but bringing him up in the temple before, Gnog felt aggrieved almost but why not? He meant as much to you two as me. I have no monopoly on his memory. But that's the rub.
* The memory is one of many, good moments, beautiful moments captured - amongst horror. In the war against Tiamat. Don't you see? The same happens now. I don't think, truly, I've ever been happier than that moment we opened the door to find Arxcis stood there. Or the time you came back from your studies, arriving at the Goliath Drinks, almost looking like a different person. In all this horror around us, all the incomprehensibly bad, awful things Bolas has done and that all the creatures here have endured - amongst that - what about the sphinxes bursting into song? Truly, one of the most beautiful and moving moments I've ever experienced and something I shall remember forever. And for me personally, there's Ajani. Even if it goes nowhere, I never thought at this age that I'd have that giddy, butterflies feeling again. It's hope, it's reason, it's purpose. We all are, it's what we share. And now we share it with these good people here, on this world that is so strange to us. We learn it isn't a dying plane. It's just one that's waiting for its next birth. And that, too, will be a beautiful thing.

Gnog keeps one thing to himself. He also realised while asleep that he understood a bit about what Fee-Ree had mentioned. He dreams of himself in the Astral Sea. Calm, silvery glow. But he sees threads leading in many directions away. Some loose, some tight; one with a very strong pull, so he follows it. It gets brighter and stronger. He follows on faith; on feel. He reaches his party. "Walks in" on a camp fire in woods he's not seen in a long time. Fee-Ree turns; "Oh there you are!" and Deni has cards out, carving some vegetables onto a piece of wood. "Good thing you came when you came, we weren't going to save you any!" - a small rabbit cooks on the camp fire. Around the corner, a head pops over; "You could have had mine!" - it's Taz. And then from behind the fire light, a rustle of leaves; Cedric pops up his head.

Standing behind in the soft glow of moonlight is a silhouette. Reflection on armour. Garren, in spirit, or perhaps in person? And just around the corner, on another rock; Arcxis, holding Fee-Rees hand. All look to Gnog. "Perfect timing! Don't worry about what Deni said. You arrived at just the right time." Gnog sits at the fire, on a spare seat. Perfectly cooked rabbit divided up. He starts to eat and wakes. He knows why he's here. Friendship.

Maybe he'll tell them about it one day. But now, we have to face probably our most difficult day. But there's a mood anyway; Gnog wonders if we all had similar dreams. Garren perhaps. A sense of family, belonging and caring. Everyone around the fire; people we've chosen.

So he changes his mind and mentions it. We open up. Everyone relaxes - we all had a strange dream, all with Garren, all feeling inspired. Perhaps just because he was mentioned the day before? Who knows. Taz doesn't dream - he doesn't sleep. Gnog says he hopes Taz can dream one day; Taz is inspired by our stories anyway.

Deep breaths. Centred. Steady.

The camp is lively as ever. Warriors are ready. Karras has armed and rallied fighters and rangers. The initiates. Gnog steals a moment to go up to her, places the greataxe kind of diagonally across his front and says, "Today we will get that battle together I think. It will be my honour." "Yes. And this time - this time we're all fighting for something real. For something we have chosen. And we're going to need every bit of help we can get!"

Yes. Those four undead gods - bad enough with the two insect gods.

We ask around for any news of Manesh and his mission in the city. They'd heard that he's been working tirelessly - and in fact think we should fly out, to offer support. Buildings by the "Plaza Of The Five" have become a sermon point, apparently. Troops not sent in yet - a moment of alarm, it takes a day! - but no, a troop marching will get there in 7 hours. To achieve this, the sphinxes are able to help; they know old songs that lift the spirit and make feet light. Helps in the desert in particular. Could even be less than 7. Either way, we'd still have 3 of Heroes Feast left and who knows what we'll get up to before the troops are in anyway. But we can be there in an hour to offer Manesh support. We can take one other; anyone need a lift?

Gideon wants to come. Good call. He seems a different person; beard and hear trimmed, in full armour all repaired and gleaming. He wishes to "fight the cause of righteousness with a good heart". We welcome him to our group. Taz says to the surrounding generals - "We will fly. See you on the battlefield! Today, you take back your home."

As we head to the ship, excitement on the watch towers; Hazaret. Apparently this has been expected; people get into positions to make a special welcome, the sphinxes heading out to greet her mid way. A light wind blows, causing a desert haze of sand low down. Fee-Ree is confident with flight. Gideon thinks we should give them space - Hazaret is their god; nothing we can do but distract.

We figure Fee-Ree has more interesting attunements than Taz for the helm, so she hands it over and we get aboard. Gnog quietly says to the ship - which Taz overhears - "This could be dangerous. Might be our last flight but I hope not. Thanks for everything either way!" Funnily enough, as he's doing this, Deni says to Taz - "hey, how manouverable is the Navigator, do you think?" "Getting in here was close to the limit, but we can turn on a gold piece - we you saw how we dodged the Star Moth" "Nimble enough to fight those gods in the air on a ship, firing the ballista?" "Possibly - hard to say, I don't know their abilities, but yes, it would give us some range and some attack power; we have I think, 18 or 19 bolts left; could be done but if we're hit we'd likely go down like a sack of potatoes; depends how bad the damage is but Fee-Ree might have time to pull us out. Getting back to Ravnica would be a problem, but there's the Giff emergency flare?" but Deni thinks maybe we should hide it in the dune again, then, and walk in; too risky. Taz says we should bear in mind as an option. We might have to do it to beat those gods. If they win, everything else fails and it'll be no use having a ship anyway.

We lift off; it's a shaky start (Navigation 17), almost clips a wing on the door - shouts "Sorry, getting rusty!" but Gideon comments on how manouverable it is. "Reminds me of some of the gods chariots back on my world!" (Theros).

During the hour of flight, Fee-Ree chooses the Staff Of Warning again. Like old times. A bit worn now, but sturdy!

Taz knows the way and flies into the same place. Winds make it a bit harder this time. Visibility is OK but he has to fly high. Navigation only 12 on dunes, he's off course and Deni shouts a warning as we nearly hit the ledge; backs away; tries again; nope - 12 again! - third time lucky? Aces it. Wind dies down, lands cleanly (22). "Sorry again", says Taz, "Too windy!". We do the usual tarps-blankets-and-rocks thing.

While we're doing that Deni does her telepathic bond ritual and soon enough we're all connected, at least for an hour. She knows the way back through the tunnels we used before; we follow.

### 08:30 Ravnican. 1.5 hours awake. 8.5 hours remain on the feast.

We decide to check Orisa's place but keep hidden in case it is being watched. Instead we find excitement, small crowds in the open. Mention of 8+ hours travel. Take everything, but there may be looters - don't leave valuables - all that kind of talk. We gather that this is about evacuation. We get to the building. A fighter at the door recognises us. "This is your doing?!" "Samut, dissidents, others; we just helped. And Hazaret!" "Orisa was right. She sensed purpose in you. She's in her room."

We head inside. We realise that her room isn't the basement, that was just for hiding and she's not anymore. It's on this floor. All the books. She's packing them. Gnog shouts, "Orisa! Good idea, make sure they're safe!" "Yes, we're headed out into the desert. I didn't think that was a journey I'd ever make and I hope it's one I can make in reverse. But just in case..."

Inevitably, a fairly touching conversation. At one point she digs around; she pulls out a book. It's the picture book - "The Story Of Amonkhet". "But this means too much to you!" says Gnog. "I remember every line in my mind"... So Gnog takes this very precious book. He packs it carefully in his backpack - not even the Bag Of Holding - there's always a small chance of that being damaged and collapsing.

Fighters are are amassing. They will escort evacuees but meet the incoming soldiers and join that group to form a war camp back in Naktamun. Sutesh and Karras lead the army.

We run into "building general" - Ghariab - who it turns out came here with Manesh. Manesh insists he'll be the last column to leave, while Ghariab says he'll lead the column out into the desert, with evacuees, until the two columns meet. "There are thousands of us". While most soldiers at the meeting of the two columns will then turn to Naktamun, many will continue onward to defend the evacuees all the way to the safety of dissident camp.

Several blocks in this part of the city have now been secured and is being used as a staging ground; that's how come everyone here is just out in the open.

Manesh is deep south, in the Plaza Of The Five. He has protection - but they think it'd help if we attended, so we head off. Gnog asks if there's a vantage point from which he could see the gate and, in fact, through it?

(He's avoided looking. Intentionally. Didn't want to know. But he has to - the anxiety is too great).

We're directed to a tower; we go up, and Gnog gets the spyglass, steadies it on a wall and has a look. It's an oblique view, to our right. Behind Hazaret's temple, the horns rise; the plaza; the eternal army amassed, still standing still - good sign? - crackling energy around the gate, so it looks like energy must still be poured into it to hold it open; another good sign. Things beyond look almost stormy, which makes it hard to see. There seems to be a city beyond. Huge, really huge trees blocking part of the view! Battle happening... Some kind of front, fought and defended the entire time. They must be *exhausted* beyond imagination. Incredible. **They still stand!**

Gnog drops back from the wall and puts away the spyglass. Looks to his party, says, "I don't believe it. They're still up. They're still fighting. We're not too late and we've got a chance. Let's get to Manesh."

Quite a lot of damage by the plaza. Literal gods toppled here, crushing buildings. Obelisks in some places have fallen. A five-sided pyramid in the middle - wow, that would take some construction skill! - and on each side, one of the Naktamun god heads. In front of it all is the huge plaza with a pentagon shape itself, echoing the pyramid; it's raised, with channels that imply fountains or streams that used to flow off the side. And there, in the middle, in all this space, is Manesh! He's using magic to project his voice. It's thunderous. People are gathered around. Unrest. Guards surround the plaza, stopping people from approaching - nobody too close, but some people might spill over.

It's only about 15ft of a perimeter and the crowd is growing. Many people are obviously angry and within the crowd there is clashing. *Thousands*. Gnog says, "OK, any idea how we get through all of *that* to help hold the line for Manesh?!"

Gideon says "Well, yes!" - looks to Deni - "With your permission, may I take you there?" "Uuuh - sure?!" and he picks her up, like a bridge being carried by a groom! Fee-Ree says to Gnog, "You got Taz?" and Gnog picks up Taz; she casts Fly for the two of us. "OK then!" says Gnog. Off we go, all flying; Gideon has boots that sprout white wings and let him fly! Gnog calls over to Deni and says, "I dunno, maybe that's better than slippers of climbing or boots of stealth!" "But how are those tiny wings keeping us in the air?!"

We fly over a surprised crowd. Manesh is in full flow; spots us; signals to guards to let us descend. We land and take up positions to help with the five sides around him, helping to mimic that five sided motif everywhere, even down here. Symbolic, but that can be important.

Someone has run up and throws up a jar of fire - molotov cocktail - onto the platform which Fee-Ree extinguishes immediately. THAT gets some crowd attention. Taz starts to play music that's calming but related to the sermon, to try and get people on board. He uses Enhance Ability - Eagle's Splendor - and gets Performance 28 with BFS; and Persuasion is a whopping 34. Guidance for Manesh now and again. People nearby, in the sector around him, stop fighting and start listening.

Some of the crowd listening start heading North, dispersing, evacuating - the logic Taz is going for is, debate philosophies and beliefs when you're safe; either way, there's going to be fighting - it'll be dangerous - head away! FOMO helps; people hear there's going to be a kind of caravan, for safety, and they don't want to miss that.

We have to keep going at this for a good half hour. Manesh is rolling through prepared sermons. It's clear as we listen that he's been thinking about this a lot. It's working; more and more are leaving, and as some become convinced, they convince others; the wave he was hoping to create starts to work.

One of his viziers then tentatively starts to suggest we should head to the column. He's spotted one of the dead gods. It's moving, from the Necropolis, slowly, heading towards the city. We don't know if it's the gate, or to attack us - either way, we support the notion and suggest to Manesh that the wave of people convincing other people seems to be spreading and prudence suggests withdrawal, so that we haven't spread our fighting forces unnecessarily.

Manesh says, "Just one last thing to do. We must go to the temple of Kefnet and gather all of those faithful who have hidden there. It has been a hiding place for anyone from across the river." Gnog remembers Samut's promise. Says to Manesh, "Are the five of us enough? These guards here could help continue to encourage others to join the column to the North." He agrees with the guards but insists the viziers come along.

### 09:30 Ravnican. 2.5 hours awake. 7.5 hours remain on the feast.

So, we head with Manesh and the viziers towards Kefnet's temple - the approaching gods suddenly look really quite large and scary! It's busy. A stream of people. Not quite panic; but on the edge of it. At one point, Gnog's arm is grabbed - it's a vizier from Hazaret's temple, that we met earlier. They managed it - when evacuation started, they crossed the river. He thinks they got everyone across but there are so many... He thanks us.

We get across to Kefnet's temple in the middle of the river. With a sinking feeling, Gnog realises that the dead gods aren't heading North to attack the oncoming army - which would be bad, but what we expected - instead they're headed for the gate. Manesh and the Viziers now have what they need and are able to start getting Kefnet's people through, there's a pipeline. Manesh will be the rear column, as he said. He looks to us. "You've given us one last shot at hope and salvation. And for that, for that I thank you immensely. I only pray that what little courage I can lend you will serve as some aid." - and he casts L3 Aid on us all. We thank him in return.

Gideon surprises us. "I know where the generators are" he says. Given the gods are heading for the gate - no time to lose. "OK then" says Gnog, "Let's do it."

It's almost surreal for a moment. This isn't a confrontation with Bolas or even Liliana, yet it feels every bit as signifiant as when Tiamat was being called forth. Undead gods heading for a portal, the terrible worry for Ravnica, the hopes being pinned on this battle's success for the world of Amonkhet - truly, at least one world rests in part on our shoulders right now. Everyone has a part to play. It's time to play ours, and after all the delays and tasks to get here, it is strange that it feels *sudden*.

Gideon is telling us that in the direction of the gate itself (swarming with Eternals and, soon, four undead gods) the generators are within an old pyramid just to one side. We can't see it from where we are; all Gideon can do is indicate its general direction next to the giant, looming curved horns of the gate and huge structure upon which it sits.

We have two options. "That's the fastest way" says Deni from our slight vantage point at the bridge end; the main roads. Swarming with Eternals. Even invisible, it'd only take one mistake to bump into one and we're pretty much dead. The undead gods are approaching quickly, and we want to get there urgently - but getting killed along the way is useless. The dissidents use back alleys and go over buildings - slower but safer - we think we're forced to do that.

Then Gnog is chilled to the bone - perception 22 - in the distance, beyond where the Hekma is, a scorpion god and, *floating* above the city, the scarab god. They don't look like they're on the same course; they have eternals with them; and they're **much larger**. The laztop-clad God Eternals are maybe 30ft tall; these new arrivals are at least 40ft tall. No armour - willing allies of Bolas; alive. They seem to be headed in the direction of the dissident armies, perhaps? It's not clear yet. Too far away.

"Fuck" says Gnog, "Those two are huge - but we have our problem, and the five of us can't fight them. Gate first, gods later..." and we have to keep going on our plan.

Deni wishes we had Samut's illusions (Pass Without A Trace)! - but curiously then we hear in our minds a kind of singsong voice. "How are plans unfolding? It looks like the gods are on the move". Gnog thinks back, "Four undead, in lazotep, headed for the gate. Two larger, insects, not in armour, look more of a threat, unsure of destination." An older, gruffer voice. "The final column has reached the city limits." OK, so most peopel are out. Gnog says, "Good to know; we don't need to fear civilian casualties as much now". "The soldiers are turning around and coming with us. We are perhaps 15 minutes away. We have crested the dunes. The old walls of the city are in sight. We make haste towards the river to cover the final column." Gnog thinks back, "Thank you. Please do take great care. Six gods are nothing to be trifled with!" After a delay - "Don't suppose you can help with stealth for our party at your distance, can you?" "For what purpose?" "We need to get to a pyramid, past all the Eternals" "Start making your way. We have a plan".

We have to trust. Gnog is given the Boots Of Elvenkind from Deni to help; she says he can keep them - she much prefers the slippers. Great! So, we start. Invisibility will help. Gnog picks up Taz and Taz uses the MA to cast it, and the two of them vanish. Deni says she doesn't need help. Fee-Ree and Gideon decide to Fly! Show-off.

Stealth for Gnog (carrying Taz): Adv., 28; everyone else is very high (the fliers being silent, technically). Good progress; not seen; we're just over 1/3 of the way along, and we can see the undead Gods are roughly where Gideon says the old pyramid sits. Distressingly, the two large ones are now almost at the river and *one* is heading North - going for the retreating refugee column or inbound army - the other *might* be heading our way...

It tears Gnog apart to have to just let these awful things pass, knowing the danger, but unable to attack. Another in-head message. "Where are you? Are you safe?" "Just over 1/3 of the way to pyramid. Not been seen yet. Undead gods will reach the gate before we reach the pyramid. Insect gods unsure; one is flying definitely heading North, at the river now, going towards the refugees or the army it seems. The other seems to be heading our way. Maybe not us; maybe for the bridge at Kefnet; perhaps it doesn't want to wade through the river and needs to cross via the bridge?"

We could continue on through buildings, hallways, but that could be infested with undead. The ground is covered in Eternals. Up and over then! Gnog athl (non-adv) dirty 20. He struggles a bit - trying to be quiet and carrying Taz, so Taz turns into more of a metal backpack! - we get onto the first building. Taz whispers into Gnog's ear - "parkour!"

For the next building, a running jump is needed! Athl adv 29. Lands. The boots help deaden the sound. It was *big* jump - almost 20ft; Gnog's quite surprised he made it. Deni of course is fine and Fee-Ree and Gideon are flying, but risk being seen; Fee-Ree stealth 21, Gideon 20, not too bad. They're quiet and an Eternal would need to be looking at the sky!

Gnog perception 26 from this new building.

* There appears to be an obsidian-skinned *angel* hovering over a nearby square, looking around. It is wearing a traditional-looking headdress with Bolas horns; a golden sunburst collar; bracers; golden sandals; it carries a very long staff spear. It has unusually long arms and legs. White, feathery wings. We duck down on the roof.

* Gnog remembers that if we require a distraction, one is incoming... And hears a sound of whirring, then distant harmonious singing. The sphinxes are here. He turns around. A tall staff of Hazaret looms above buildings in the distance. The whirring is dozens of arrows, flying, spears too, coming from across the river. Most of course can't make the distance, but it's capturing attention.

We're stuck between the Bolas gate, too close now, and the angel. The angel is immediately distracted and spreads its wings, taking off; and from a few other buildings, we hadn't noticed two more that take to the sky also. The scorpion God continues to head to the bridge. The scarab god's wings open and a miasma of flying scarabs erupts forth. All Eternals in the square and streets around also turn and start marching towards the river.

Gnog says, "Now's our chance!". But Deni is thinking, "What are they doing? This is suicide!" and Gnog thinks back, "Probably illusion - let's hope so - don't waste it! Let's get moving."

We jump down to street level on a recently-empty street. We run diagonally and reach an area of ramshackle buildings similar to the complex region we first arrived in with the dissidents. This area has few Eternals; we almost run full-tilt into a small group of stragglers that haven't followed the others away to the river; Gnog stealth 23; Deni is high; Fee-Ree not great but as a group we get away with it. The Eternals do stop briefly as they saw Fee-Ree before she disappeared behind another building but they're being commanded it seems, and rapidly resume their march to the river (or bridge).

The undead gods are already on the large monument, climbing the stairs. We race through the maze-like streets towards the target pyramid. There's a crashing noise behind us; falling buildings; the scarab god has now turned and is headed for the gate too.

"Time is short" thinks Gnog, "where's the entrance Gideon? Do you know?" "Yes, on two sides of the pyramid." We want to tackle the gods. But there are five. It's a horrible choice. They're going to get through the gate. We have to try and stop them but if we fought them we'd be maybe able to stop one, but then the rest would be getting through. We have to swallow our fears and just go for it, stay on target, we've got so lucky to get so close now, so we have to keep going for the gate.

Inevitably, after being so lucky and having had such a great distraction, we now encounter *real* resistance. A big group of Eternals notice us inevitably as we exit the cluster of buildings and cover clear ground to the pyramid. Fee-Ree and Gideon are fully visible; Gnog is hidden for the moment, invisible still. Gnog guesses that there are maybe 8-10 Eternals. We're approaching the pyramid corner; a grand entrance to the left, smaller to the right. We're only maybe 80ft from the pyramid corner. Maybe another 80ft along either side. Gnog thinks to the group, "Aim for the right. Draw the Eternal group that's seen us around to that side, so we're not as visible from the gate building; then we'll tackle them and get inside."

Fee-Ree and Gideon immediately veer off to the right as requested; Gnog runs too; he doesn't know where Deni is but hears a brief "fuck" behind him and sees a blur as Deni had been heading the other way. We get around the corner. The Eternals round the edge too. Gnog puts Taz down and thinks to the group "fast, and quiet as you can, but if need to make noise - so be it". Battle! (Meanwhile, Gnog notices behind that Hazaret has reached Kefnet's bridge already - oh dear, were those arrows *not* an illusion...?!)

Initiative:

* Gnog (invisible) nat 20 -> 23
* Fee-Ree 14
* Deni 13
* Gideon 13
* Taz (now visible) 9

"I hope you're getting on with closing that gate", telepath the Sphinxes. "We'll hold them here as long as we can. But we'll take losses quickly". Gnog thinks back, "On it! Best possible speed!" and then thinks to the party, "OK, if noisier is faster, let's do noisier..."

Gnog looks at the approaching Eternal group; goddammit. There's 11. One of them is very large. Gnog rages, jump-flies past some smaller ones at the front and attacks a larger more important looking one - long chains - one of those connecty-ones that power flows through. First swing is while invisible, so with advantage. Hits for 26 damage. Second swing hits for 21. It's badly injured, but the decent hits were not enough to take it down.

A hoplite continues heading out towards Taz. It's about 25ft away from Taz when it stops and throws a spear - at Fee-Ree, surprisingly, flying some distance away. Misses. It pulls another spear from a carrier on its back and tries again; misses again, it's just too far. Another hoplite runs past Gnog, who lets it go - he's more worried about the big guy at the back - and it, too tries for Fee-Ree but the range defeats it and both attacks just miss.

Now the big one moves. Gnog recognises it now, close up. Decorated horns - minotaur, or this world's version? A bit different, larger, but same idea. Very heavily armoured, covered in both golden metal plate and lazotep beneath. Harder to get to the gem. Gnog notices as an aside that none of the gems glow. Not expecting to harvest on this side, perhaps? Nothing to harvest of interest, at least, that's what Bolas expected. Maybe Bolas *didn't* predict this in his calculations of future possibilities. Anyway - the big one charges. It pushes past a smaller one and gets up to Gnog, and he manages to hit with an excellent opportunity attack - 25 to hit, 34 damage! It turns to Gnog and its eyes flare with dark fire as it focuses on Gnog instead... Ah, shit, this is going to hurt... Fuck me, nat 20 on its attack. And it's 3x attack dice for this one, apparently, so *9* D12. Shiiiiit. Taz is a long way away, no Silvery Barbs; wings won't help; Gideon can't help at this range either. A total 66->33 slashing damage. Wowsers. No reaction left for Stone's Endurance. And it's not done. Second attack misses. Despite the terrible hit and damage, Gnog turns and laughs at it - "Welcome to a fight with a Toril Goliath, motherfucker!" (he did 34 damage, took 33 - win!)

One minor Eternal gets into Taz's face but has no time to do more.

Fee-Ree shouts, "Gnog - this should *just* miss, duck to your right!" and casts a L3 fireball very close to him, catching a bunch of Eternals including the minotaur (she can use sorcery points for re-rolls, so L4 or higher is less valuable than it used to be and was always a difficult decision - 8d6 for L3, "only" 1d6 extra for each level above). Damage potential for the fireball is 28, not great but it'll have to do. Two hoplites, two lower level and the big guy in range. The big guy takes full damage, as do both hoplites, and the low levels do too. Good work!

Deni thinks out, "Taz or Gnog?!" and Gnog thinks back "Taz!". Do, Deni gets insight on the Eternal that's in front of Taz and attacks with sneak damage... 53! Completely disintegrated. As it goes down, Deni notices that the crystals / gems seem to have done nothing. She didn't hit it but no evidence of any magical attempt to bring up the Eternal was seen. She mentions it via thought.

An Eternal behind Gnog turns and attacks with flanking advantage. First attack hits for 11->5 damage. Next hits, same.

Gideon flies down to land near Gnog. He carries a weapon that Gnog recognises, he thinks, from Balthors - it was just a hilt, but then becomes a blade of light. A sunsword. Except his doesn't produce a blade; it's a strange, three-tailed whip of sunlight. He attacks the minotaur (the Ravager). Hits (28) dealing 3d8+6 -> 23 damage. Gnog realises that his words back at the camp ("fight the cause of righteousness with a good heart") had a deeper meaning; this aura, this radiance, is reminiscent of Garren - looks like a divine smite. The Ravager falls. Gideon then turns and attacks the chain-holder with what is *definitely* Garren's magic; 6d8+6 -> 38 damage. Gnog thinks to him "You *are* just like one of best friends. Nice to meet *you* Gideon." In response, Gideon says, "COME AND MEET YOUR TRUE AFTERLIFE! Release yourselves! Throw yourselves at me and let me free you!"

Taz sees some nearby hoplites and two lower level soldiers almost down, so throws a spread eldritch blasts out. One at the nearest hoplite and two more at the distant soldiers, one each. Hits the hoplite (11+12) but with a crappy 7 damage to hoplite (nat 2), but misses both soldiers (nat 2 and nat 4 rolled on the d20). He curses (bad habits from Gnog).

Gideon is attacked but is missed twice; Gnog is attacked by a nearby hoplite, the first missing, the second *would* hit but Gideon reacts with a Glorious Defence, and it misses. Gideon even has the chance to turn around and attack back as part of his reaction, hitting and dealing - with another L1 Divine Smite - 39 damage on a reaction attack! Then, though, another runs up, flanking Gnog and attacking - misses, misses again; it tries to bash with its shield; misses. Bad rolls, despite advantage. A lower level one runs in and attacks Gideon, also flanking; misses, then hits; Gnog *would* respond with wings - tit for tat! - but used his reaction earlier. 9-6->reduced by 3->6 damage (Heavily Armoured feat). The shield bash attack hits too, only doing 6->3 damage. One last solider moves to attack Gnog, also flanking, still missing for the first but hitting on the second; 8->4. Heroes Feast poison resistance is great. 

Gnog wants to clear the field quickly now so recklessly attacks an injured nearby solider. Crit! A high damage roll too - wasted damage unfortunately. 58! Very high. Only needed single digits; its down. Hits the other one for 23, taking it out as well.

A hoplite runs up to Taz, attacking twice with its spear; misses twice; shield misses too. Another runs up and can't quite reach Taz so instead throws (apparently endless) spears at Fee-Ree - just the one; it misses.

Fee-Ree twins Firebolt, targeting each of the two nearby hoplites. One crit fails (on the one in melee with Taz), one crit hits (the one closer to Fee-Ree)! 31 damage. It falls. Deni now repeats the "protect Taz" thing from earlier; she aims at the hoplite barely 10ft away, hits and does 47 damage; it falls too (Taz thinks, "Thanks!").

Gideon thinks to Gnog, "How badly hurt are you?" "I'm alright!" "OK then" - so he attacks again the one he reaction-hit a short while ago. 3d8+6->18 damage. Attacks again; just hits; 3d8+6->23 damage. It falls. Taz targets the closest person he can see - hits for 13, again for 13, but the last one misses (nat 3). He starts to run towards the pyramid entrance.

The one Taz hit sees him running and tries to chase, but Gnog reacts with Sentinel and hits for 28, stopping it. Another runs around to flank Gideon and attacks, missing then critting... But Gideon's secret is adamantine armour. Crit hits don't do extra damage. Gnog sees in the corner of his eye this bad hit coming, can't react as he's busy with the other Elemental, but the armour doesn't buckle. Gideon only takes 2 damage. The shield bash attack misses too. The *other* hoplite in the flank now tries its luck; the first attack hits but Gideon reacts to make it a miss and Gideon attacks in response, hitting for 3d8+6->20.

Gnog recklessly swings at the one he just stopped. Hits for 26 - it falls; swings at the more injured of the two flanking Gideon; hits, 22 damage. Not enough! It's still up.

Fee-Ree follows up on the same one with Firebolt, hits with a very high 4d10->33, and it falls. Only one left. Deni reads the remaining Elemental; does it; and attack roll is a crit! This is a waste of a big finish, really; better on Tesseret! Anyway, with the reading, it's 2d8+24d6+modifier. Insane. **100 damage.** Woah. New record, by a distance - and a round number, to boot. "Beat that, Gnog!" she calls in his head. He responds, "No fair, I'm the meat shield not the damage dealer! But *very* good hit!"

### 2000 XP shared equally.

We don't miss a beat. It's been less than 20 seconds. We run inside, but Gideon stops us for a moment. "I know we're in a hurry - but follow me. I know where we're going." He starts to "think" an inspiring speech. He talks about what it means for these people to have come and believe in them. What it means for *him* for us to come to him. The Gatewatch are not so disappointed with him that they would not seek him for help. His loss of faith, his crumbling of sense of self, the corruption of the only love he's ever known and the madness of trying to understand the resulting betrayal; but we managed to pull him through this. Not just him; the sense in the camp; they know this is folly and that there's only the "needle's chance of hitting the eye of the beholder" but that's all they need. Hope cannot be killed as long as an ember survives.

-> 22 temp HP all round.

Gnog and Taz confer and use Garren's wing-heal thingy to give him some healing, while Gideon does hands-on healing to help Gnog too. Gnog's fully healed; he thanks Gideon sincerely.

Gnog reminds everyone of Tesseret's plane shifting abilities, unknown as they are; Taz has a spell but he could defeat it; maybe a psychic lance to help; who knows. Our plan has to be to attack and do what damage we can, but the analogy was given to us; fight in a cage, not in the open. That's our best hope, but it's a thin one and we have little doubt that - as usual! - substantial improvisation will be required.

Fee-Ree agrees and will test his will (saving throw spells) - treat him as a dragon; whittle down his strength. Gideon reminds Taz that him and Gnog should be *inside* that cage if he brings it up as nobody else outside will be able to get spells in either. But they can at least defend against things outside. Taz encourages them to try and keep close in melee in that case.

We quickly reach a junction. Gnog says, "Shit, I really *am* getting old - I can't remember if we usually keep left or right?! Left, I think" - so we turn left. Deni in front, on trap-watch the whole time; Taz behind with lights, Gnog, Fee-Ree, Gideon. A corridor ahead has two doors opposite each other, the corridor then turning right at the end. Right hand door: Deni's mouse is used, but since she can't see while looking through it, Taz squeezes in front for a while. The mouse can't see much but it smells kind of empty / not anything alive inside. Takes about a minute for that, so we decide not to check the left hand door since that's headed back towards the outside wall and press on and check around the right-hand corner up ahead.

Another corridor, more doors, slow going. Taz asks people to wait - he tries to at least get us a bearing, L2 Locate Object via MA for the crystals. This means his concentration cantrip on the lights falls, so Gideon casts Light to compensate and Gnog lights up his axe for good measure. The time for subtlety seems to be passing. Up and to the right - feels like it's nearer the top of the pyramid. We need stairs. We creep ahead - a wider chamber is from the Grand Entrance, which is risky, but - yes! Stairs. Huge statue edifices. We manage to sneak around and get up the stairs - the big statues on the stairs surprisingly *don't* animate and attack us...! There's a huge chamber with many alcoves, with more statues - various gods. 

With only dancing lights it's hard to see. Gnog disad. perception 15, Taz flat 7! He sees what would've been a grand hall. Middle of the chamber here is flat and clear, with tiny bits of rubble around here and there, some cleared, and a layer of dust. The dust is disturbed; people have been through here. The eight statues are all of different Gods. None insects, all animals. A beautiful, glorious room once perhaps; gilding still visible in many places, hieroglyphs carved into golden standstone stonework all over.

Deni hasn't found any *physical* traps. Taz tries his Wand of Magic Detection. Magical glyphs everywhere. We're standing on one! Another at the far end of the room. All eight of the statues are magical and there are other magic glyphs in between some of the carved hieroglyphs. Abjuration on the glyphs and transmutation on the statues. He figures then that the statues will probably animate and move, and the glyphs are warding or warning. We're already stood on one but haven't passed it, so he tries to understand more - Arcana - sadly only 16, but then with inspiration, scrapes 20 (nat 3, nat 7 - he's been rolling D20s very low this session, no higher than 4 the whole time). He can't tell what'll set them off. It's a trap of some sort. They seem to be sequential glyphs; multiple triggers; if we trigger one it's OK but triggering more must cause a problem. There *must* be a way through the room without setting them off.

He's "thinking out loud" with all of this and we're all thinking about the disturbances in the dust; Deni immediately spots a pattern. It's not random for footprint impressions to be scattered along an unusual path rather than straight through. So we realise we have to follow that trail. Gnog survival nat 1 FFS! - Inspiration blown too! - nat 18->27. Bingo. Immediately sees how to navigate around the room. He knows the safe corridor and order and leads us all through the room safely.

By the time we're across, we figure it's been less than four minutes since we entered. Time is incredibly previous but despite our necessary caution we're making reasonable progress we think.

The small room we reach has a door at the end, plus to left and right, stairways. Carved stone, less grand than the ones behind us. Gnog's checking the floor still, for dust disturbance. Perception 21. Disturbances in all three directions, including the door. We take the stairs upwards, deciding to ignore the door for time purposes. We hope that isn't a bad move! The crystals were indicated as above and behind us now, so they're certainly not in that room, whatever else might be. Stairs up. They turn 90 degrees twice in a squared-off spiral.

Another corridor on the level up. The corridor heads back in the direction of the grand entrance (but a level up), widening, rooms off to the side, end alcove with large statue. Gideon senses undead presence below us. Lots! But nothing evil on *this* level. So we choose to ignore the rooms again and take the stairs up. Same deal with the turning stairs, but as we reach the top, Fee-Ree's staff goes nuts. She thinks a strong warning to us all!

(At the same time, Taz feels that he's almost at the crystal level and "thinks" that. They're higher but not much, maybe raised on a dais or table or something.)

In response to Fee-Ree's warning, Gideon thinks out - "Which of you is most vulnerable and important?" Gnog thinks back, "Taz and Fee-Ree. Sorry Fee-Ree!" - and Gideon casts L4 Freedom Of Movement on Taz, lasting for an hour. He can't be paralysed, his speed can't be reduced and he can't be restrained or *non-magically* grappled. Very handy! Taz thinks a thanks.

We move into the room. Surprisingly large; perhaps the pyramid walls are thicker as you get lower down (which would make sense) - despite being near the apex it seems to be around 60ft long and 30ft wide, with the larger chambers and corridors below often being no longer than around 60ft either (though that said, we did see various doors to rooms off those corridors which we did not investigate - there must be much more down there than we saw in our quick dash towards the crystals).

Initiative!

* Gnog (adv 18, another nat 20) -> 23 again
* Gideon 19
* Fee-Ree 18
* Taz (nat 6, sigh) 11
* Deni 9

Gnog rage-flies into the room. As he gets in, he sees Tesseret, preparing a spell, chuckling; "We meet again - you took your time getting here; looking for traps, were we"? - Taz sees the room too. It is in fact the pyramid apex, a sloping roof. The floor has various steps and levels, rising up maybe 10-15 ft in total. In the middle, raised, something draws power and shoots a beam of something up to the apex. We guess that it's powering the gate. On daises 5ft up in each corner, four metal contraptions, looking like stolen parts of the Beacon. Gnog recognises them as probably amplifiers, from Nivix and Ral's lab. Crystals on top - yes, amplification; arcane energy being channelled to the thing in the middle. It's a ball of swirling energy that passes the energy on. Pure energy, crackling, making Gnog's skin tingle. Not something with which to interact physically! As Gnog flies forward, he sees on the left a room with various panels and pieces of equipment, looking mechanical, four humming boxes with Mizzium containment fields, two per side, that seem to be powering that panel and maybe are connected to each of the four emitters. There are crystals in those too.

It takes all of Gnog's turn to get up into Tesseret's face, but uses some of the time to "think" to the group about the four amplifiers but also the four more fragile looking control systems on the left; he then rises up 15ft above Tesseret and falls. Body slam, why not! It's treated as a dex save against Gnog's adv athl, but Gnog rolls badly - 3,5->only 16 DC. Despite the low DC, he doesn't dodge; he takes Gnog's falling damage - 2d6 -> solid 10. He takes 10, Gnog takes 10->5 (since Tesseret broke his fall) ->2 due to rage. Gnog *now* casually answers, "Yeah, we were checking for traps". Tesseret's in-preparation spell stays in place (succeeded concentration check).

At the end of Gnog's turn, Tesseret, angry, explodes - legendary action - with an overload of energy. LOUD bang. DC21 con save but Gnog rolls high, 31. He takes half of 6d8 thunder -> 26 -> 13 -> 6. A nearby construct is pushed away and falls down the stairs, but Gnog notices out of the corner of his eye that the ball of energy in the middle doesn't change at all - perception 23 - he notices a piece of equipment got hit by a shockwave in the room on the left and flickers. Gnog thinks back to the group, "Definitely don't hit the central ball; attack the left room equipment".

Now it's Tesseret's true turn. He stands up and rolls away and up, to stand next to Gnog. A portal opens and an Air Elemental is summoned, appearing next to the energy ball. With a bonus action he activates something on his armour; his hand Etherium armour changes into some kind of big metallic claw, crackling with lightning. "Fool!" he says. "You have followed me to your death. Do you really think you can stop the machinations" - Gnog starts laughing at that, which throws him a bit - "of the **Infinite Consortium?**" Huh - interesting - **he's blaming them for this, is he, not Bolas?** "I gave you a chance to kneel before their galactic might. You chose to defy all grace. You will be destroyed beyond memory this day." And he kicks Gnog's shin with his foot (Gnog's still prone).

Gideon flies over Taz (who's accidentally kind of in everyone's way in the doorway!) and reaches the Air Elemental. He attacks. "I've got this one!" he 'shouts' in thought and casts Compelled Duel on it (bonus action). It fails its save and is compelled to hone in on Gideon. Then Gideon attacks, missing but then hitting with his second attack for 14 damage.

Tesseret acts again at the end of Gideon's turn. *Two* legendary actions. Parts of him reconfigure and fall away to start forming more constructs.

Fee-Ree flies over Taz too, coming close to Gideon and facing the equipment side-room. She wants to attack it but can't figure out what's going to damage it through the mizzium fields; fire might not work, she doesn't have many physical attack damage options. She thinks an enquiry about it. Taz thinks back "Only more mizzium would disturb the field; we don't have that; if all else fails, whittle down Tesseret's resistances". After a bit more thought, Fee-Ree tries L2 Chromatic Orb with Thunder damage, twinned, one to each of the *amplifiers* at the farther end of the main room that she has a clearer line of sight towards. No wild magic surge. Hits both (26, 16). 18 thunder damage each. Both rock with the impact and the central ball fluctuates but recovers. We get the sense that with *enough* damage they should fail, but it'll take quite a bit to disturb the physical structure enough to break the apparently-important alignment of everything.

The air elemental tries to attack Fee-Ree past Gideon, but is disadvantaged by the compelled duel and misses, so tries to attack Gideon but misses (critically) him too. It tries to create a whirlwind to bring people down from the air; it moves forward under Fee-Ree. DC13 str save - with a +5 as she's within 10ft of Gideon (in the aura). Nat 20! Resists trivially easily. No damage, unmoved.

At the end of the elemental's turn, the two constructs that Tesseret was building complete. To Taz's astonishment, the two creatures appear right inside the equipment room as Tesseret shouts "Protect!". That couldn't be better; Taz was planning Shatter into the room. He casts - L2 spells exhausted - L3 Shatter at some risk through the MA. DC 16, gets *exactly* that (nat 3). It works. Damage potential is 4d8. No saving throws for the equipment and disadvantage for the two metal constructs. Good rolls - 3,6,7,8 -> 24 potential. The equipment actually seems vulnerable to the damage type, and cracks appear in the central cabinet. Both constructs fail their saves. Tesseret shrikes, "PROTECT! And REPAIR!". 168 points total damage! Bonus action, bardic to Gnog and thinks to the group, "We do need to knock out this equipment but don't forget about whittling down Tesseret and getting close in case I'm able to bring up a cage!"

One of the hit constructs repairs the cabinet for 15.

Deni thinks, "Who do I go for?" Gnog, "Tesseret - whittle down his resistances". She reads him successfully and tries to attack, +1 arrow. A hit! Damage *would* be a high 60, which he doesn't seem to do anything to resist, surprisingly. Gnog sees from the ground (via passive perception) that it disrupts something within his armour; he winces with pain - but other than the discomfort, it doesn't seem to really affect him. Deni thinks "What the fuck?! I was expecting more of a reaction than *that!*"

Deni positions herself so that the energy ball is between her and Tesseret for cover. At the end of her turn, Tesseret, unable to see her, instead tries to reach up with a magnetic claw and grab Fee-Ree out of the sky. She's *just* within 30ft range and he's trying to pull her closer. Gnog tries Sentinel to counter it, but only rolls 4,5 with disadvantage so only 18, which is a clear miss. Fee-Ree has to make a DC21 str save, which even with +5 is going to be tricky. She blows Tides Of Chaos, and *exactly* resists being pulled.

Two small constructs that were already in the room, one of which had been thrown backwards, move over to the far corner amplifiers and attempt repairs (18, 16 repair). The last Warforged tries to repair the cabinet too, for 12.

Gnog gets up and recklessly attacks Tesseret. He gets 16 damage on the first hit - but there is no radiant extra damage, so Gnog's weapon isn't very useful. He hits again, another 16. Gnog thinks, "My weapon's not much good so aside from all our other troubles with the repairs, we need to whittle this guy down and get some more serious spells on him". At least the weapon's magical nature does seem to be making headway against the Etherium armour.

Tesseret notices that our party in a chain are all less than 30ft away from each other. He casts Chain Lightning. He targets Gideon. Three bolts arc out from him, hitting Gnog, Fee-Ree and Deni. 10d8 (!!) lightning damage potential -> a very high roll, 57. DC21 dex saves, very high. Gnog *just* manages the save, via advantage as he sees it coming. Fee-Ree has advantage thanks to her mantle; makes it; Deni at least has a +5 from being just within Gideon's aura, makes it easily, Gideon blows inspiration - 19 - Fee-Ree adds d4->2 via sorcery points, just enough. 28 damage for Gideon and Fee-Ree, Gnog halving again to 14, Deni avoids any damage due to her Evasion feat. Fee-Ree's con check succeeds so she holds Fly. Gideon loses Compelled Duel though.

Not finished yet, Tesseret uses a bonus action to blink away from Gnog and reappear a distance away, with a clear line of sight of everyone, no energy ball in the way.

Gideon attacks the Air Elemental. He hits twice. The first includes L2 Divine Smite. 29 damage, 13 damage. Still up but rough. He lands on the ground and closer to Deni.

Fee-Ree throws a fireball at Tesseret (She thinks, "A bit of a waste..." but Gnog thinks back, excitedly, "Yes! Nice! Whittle him down!"). She can catch one of the small repair constructs in the corner of the room too, at least. L3, 8d6 -> 33 potential, but she speeds up the spell. DC19 dex save. Tesseret succeeds, no resistances blown; he takes 16 damage. The construct in the corner takes a full 33. It appears to be barely damaged. Fee-Ree now breathes fire on the equipment room and two Warforged nearby. 4d10->27 (DC17 saves). The two Warforged succeed (14 damage). Surprisingly, they both fall. The cabinet and field equipment appear to be fairly resistant to the fire too, so all take some damage. The field apparatus now looks quite unstable.

The air elemental tries to body slam Fee-Ree. It hits and she takes 14 damage. Holds onto Fly. Second attack misses. Now it moves away, heading towards Taz. No opportunity attacks due to being incorporeal.

Taz needs to be clear of that, so takes the opportunity attack and leaves its influence range. It hits and he takes 19 damage. He tries Shatter; it just succeeds; he only gets 14 damage, 4d8 and he's disappointed at the impact, but that's enough apparently to cause the four fields to break - Fee-Ree shouts, **"oooh noooo!"** as she sees them collapsing - they explode! It's a 60ft radius - which hits almost *EVERYTHING* in the room, except for the cornermost amplifiers closest to the equipment room due to the doorway providing a kind of cone-shaped blast. Every single corner and every single creature. It's a con save due to force, DC18. 5d10->23 potential. The cabinet is smashed inwards but not fully destroyed.

* Gnog succeeds easily (11)
* Taz fails, even with +5 and Gideon's BFS (**AGAIN** rolls a fucking 1 on the d4, only needed a 2) (23)
* Fee-Ree succeeds (11)
* Deni succeeds and uncanny dodges (5)
* Gideon fails - only rolls a 2! (23)
* Tesseret succeeds (11) - he's scraped but looks fine basically
* Repair droid takes damage but stays up (23) but at least now is visibly damaged
* Air elemental fails but is still just up (23) 
* Two corner amplifiers are badly damaged (23)

We're all thrown to the far wall of the room. Tesseret reaches out in anger, using a legendary action to try and stabilise the four amplifiers. Now *he* is channelling the energy; it's taking some effort.

Taz is upset, thinks "I'm so sorry, it's all still up and working..." even though we know that there interruptions in the energy flow; the pyramid top shook and small bits of debris fell from the centre, and Tesseret is now having to work to keep things going, but still going they are. He screams "WE NEED THE BACKUP POWER NOW!" - Taz figures that's something that was hidden in one of the rooms we didn't access.

Deni is trying to figure out what to do. She looks distressed; Gnog sees it but before he can act, she draws her bow and aims at Tesseret. Gnog just nods. 25, hits. Her last +1 arrow in the quiver on her back; she has another but it's stowed. 53 damage. He has to roll to hold his spell; DC 26; his con is +12; but he rolls 25 - his concentration is interrupted. The central ball of energy starts to falter again. At the end of Deni's turn, he is forced to try and bring things back up via a Legendary Resistance. Deni shouts in our heads - "RIGHT! That's how we do it! High damage on Tesseret!" and her insight tells her (via Reliable Talent 24) - and she shouts out loud "...huh. You are actually *afraid* of something - if this goes down you're afraid of what's going to happen do you! Not so scary now!"

The far corner repair droid near Gnog gives up repairs and attacks Gnog. It misses once and hits once, Gnog deciding not to react with wings; 14->7 damage, but it's a slam attack so he's prone. Another one moves into a room to try and starts interacting with the beaten-up panel there; it seems to be trying to bring up that power Tesseret asked for? Gnog gets up and tries to run for Tesseret, just in range - an opp attack by the golem would hit but *this* time he uses wings - Gnog jumping up at the last minute and diving in for a grapple. He tries swinging the axe on the way in and does get a hit but it's a shitty 10 damage (2 on the d12, rerolled, 2 again). Gnog then tries to grapple, letting go of the axe with one hand. Nat 20! Automatic grapple success. Gnog tries to hold his arms in, but keep him upright so ranged attacks have no disadvantage - quite the opposite, since he can't move. Tesseret still holds the spell up.

Tesseret can't do much; he's already holding a spell. He decides to take a risk... He looks around, drops the containment spell and the system starts to fail, but then casts L7 Reverse Gravity on the whole room. Fee-Ree sees it coming and blows her last L3 spell on Counterspell to try and counter it. DC17 with +5, 12 or higher needed; rolls a 2, no chance, fails completely. Everyone who isn't flying slams into the ceiling. The corner equipment is conveniently apparently anchored to the ground somehow, not just placed on it. Dex saves DC21. 

* Gnog fails - but this means Tesseret takes damage too as Gnog is grappling him
* Taz fails
* Fee-Ree succeeds
* Gideon succeeds
* Deni is OK, no damage
* The corner construct hits the roof, so can't reach anything to repair anymore
* The equipment room is kept clear of the effect so the construct trying to get backup power working is still kept up
* The air elemental is resistant and takes 6, *still* up

3d8 bludgeoning, 12. Gnog thinks, "Ouch. Weapons on that construct trying to restore power, if you can!" - at this, Gideon, who was still flying and basically just flipped upside down, flies along towards the repair construct at the equipment panel - but does't *quite* need to go through the reversal because Tesseret put the edge right against the room - a mistake, since that makes it easier for Gideon. He attacks twice hitting both times, blowing L3 Divine Smite, 35 damage first, another L3 Divine Smite, 33 damage. The fucking thing is still up. He uses a bonus action to Channel Divinity, recovering a L3 slot.

(As an aside, Taz is thinking out loud that he wants to contact Hazaret to get the runes activated and take down the Necropolis; Gideon suggests prayer; it could be done instead of movement.)

Fee-Ree keeps whittling down Tesseret. She flies so she's hovering 10ft above the actual floor and casts L7 Crown Of Stars - no wild magic surge - and throws one at Tesseret. Crit! 8d12 radiant damage -> 58, decent roll. He fails his con save and blows another resistance to hold the magic up.

The air elemental attacks Taz. Both attacks miss! Tesseret drops the reverse gravity spell though, to use a legendary action to reach out and bring back full power to the failing grid. Another round of dex saves, but DC15 this time. Potential damage is 21.

* Gnog choose to fail - he'll take Tesseret with him! - 21->10 damage
* Taz once again fails horribly (*what* is going on with his D20s!)
* Fee-Ree fails badly too but holds Fly, for what that's worth
* Gideon is fine
* Deni fine as usual
* Corner construct makes its save -> 10 damage
* Air elemental is destroyed!

Taz gets up, fires 3 eldritch blasts at the construct doing repairs. Two hit; 14 and 15 damage, which is enough. The construct fails. He gives bardic inspiration to Fee-Ree and thinks out, "I don't have time, someone needs to contact Hazaret".

Deni doesn't attack Tesseret because he and Gnog are currently prone. Instead, she prays to contact Hazaret. "Fuck, I mean, how do you even pray?!" and starts thinking, then "Oh shit, oh shit!" and we feel a weird rumbling and thumping as the ground shakes. An earthquake - but not - Gnog thinks over the noise, shouting as if it were vocal, "MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I EVER HEARD!" - it's just a shame we don't get to see it. Deni drops her bow, grabs her *dragon bone shortsword* this time and runs to stab Tesseret. She would miss but for prone+grappled advantage; hits, gets a high total damage roll - 57. No poison damage appears to affect him though. We see Tesseret discorporates his armour; starts to pull apart almost; she stabs right into him, but something in the middle of him, a ball of metal, rotates, clicking, opens and fills his *entire* body with some strange burst of energy that pulls all of his pieces back together. Some kind of contingency. "Fucks sake" says Gnog out loud. He's teleported 30ft away - a Misty Step of sorts - near Gideon and the ball.

Gnog thinks, "Taz, its time to lock him down somehow". Taz arcana 17+13->30. He's starting a spell Taz has never seen before but instinctively knows it is Planeswalk; he thinks back, "He's trying to leave the plane. I don't know if we've hit enough resistances for my cage spell to have any chance yet. And you're all a long way away. Time is precious!"

The remaining defender runs over to the still-prone Gnog and would hit but Deni's wings shield it. The next would hit but Gnog does wings too and avoids it.

Gnog's turn. He drop his rage, re-rages and flies to Tesseret; attacks recklessly hitting for 12 damage; then grapples. It'd miss but for bardic inspiration, rolling 10 on the d10. Tesseret makes the con save though. Athl check for grapple is 23 (Luck point used but rolled lower); Tesseret fails; but on his turn, he uses his last Legendary Resistance to escape. Gnog thinks to Taz, "NOW!" and says to Tesseret, "THAT is for the Ranivan voda".

Tesseret tries to move away. Gnog reacts with Sentinel (shouting, "and THAT is for airship pilot"). He hits easily, with a high damage roll of 19. Tesseret can't move away and is injured. Gideon now moves in and flanks. It's perfect; everything by true chance lined up. He attacks but the first misses (it's a very high AC) tho the last does hit. He avoids Divine Smite out of caution; there may be another backup spell or something so we want to *hold* him in this plane. 15 damage.

Fee-Ree throws a star at one of the damaged corner pillars supporting an amplifier, 4d12 radiant damage, 36 damage, it comes crashing down. The ball in the middle starts to completely fail. Tesseret is starting to curse - "No, no, all the plans! He will hunt me, let me go!" and Gnog replies, "And *THAT* was for Kaya!"

Taz tries it. Now's the time. Tesseret might save but he has to give it a go. L7 Force Cage; it encloses the energy ball, Gnog, Gideon and Tesseret. Tesseret **fails his save** and is captured. The planeswalking spell fizzles. Gnog thinks, "Mr Tablabu! I do believe I owe you several beers!"

Deni reads the remaining construct that's now turning to repair the destroyed pillar. She attacks, hitting and taking it down.

Gnog flanks Tesseret and just piles in. Hits, shouting "**THAT** is for Toril!" and does 16 damage and again, hits again - **"and THAT ONE IS FOR ME!"** he shouts, even louder. 20 damage. The first cleave exposes the ball of Etherium in the middle; the second cleave of the axe slams straight into it. The ball cracks and bursts. Tesseret is looking at the two of us, in some kind of panic, trying different magics but the cage stops it, a look of horror and a truly awful look of *anger and disgust* - but then he collapses into the ground in a pile of metal. His last words:

* **"I return to the blind eternities. At least Bolas cannot get me."**

Gnog shouts. The Force Cage lifts... Gnog's face is black as thunder. He kicks the remains, HARD, scattering them, useless broken bits of metal skittering over the flagstones. "Not even a head for Kaya. Just a useless, wasted thing. Good to nothing and nobody... Look, I want to enjoy this victory. I do. But we have saved nothing. The dark gods of this planet still wage war. And in closing the gate, we have both helped and imperilled Ravnica in equal measure. We must finish our job here and leave. *Immediately*. The people of Amonkhet have almost no chance. So we must see to it that they succeed nonetheless. Are you with me?"

The tired party look at each other. Gnog sees that they still have fight in them. "Right. Lead on" says Fee-Ree. Deni says, "Ah, goddammit!" and quickly scoops up a few things from around Tesseret. "Can we take the crystals somehow?"

* We are all inspired by this outcome and the desire to help more
* Gnog looks at the bits of metal on the ground and picks one for Kaya

Gnog answers, "Not without a protection field, not safely. Besides, they're useless really - they were here to protect from... All this. Taz, can you destroy them? That sonic thing?" Taz can. Deni suggests outside - the pyramid roof surprisingly hasn't fallen despite the debris, but Taz apologetically points out that the noise needed to resonate and destroy the crystals is better confined in the space. He suggests we all leave the room while he stands at the threshold with crystals piled up.

Taz, history only 2+13->15. He remembers the principles. DM Fiat: He was inspired by the force cage though, so thinks hard and retries History. 28. The schematics and resonance - he remembers now. He'll use his practiced Minor Illusion to create the sound needed. Adv a rcana, 3,10+13->23. Crystals are piled as far away from his illusion as he thinks he can risk for safety, then steps 30ft further back, casts Minor Illusion at maximum range - casts Bless on himself, Gideon and Fee-Ree; everyone retreats around a corner except Taz with Gideon behind to help with an aura. Taz tries. Too far away. Steps forward a bit. Gideon more. They explode - rather more violently than he expected! Oops. 60ft radius; con save; only 9+2->11, +4 bless, +5 from Gideon for dirty 20. Half damage. 30 points damage! It was a very big bang. The side of the pyramid on the far wall is blown out and some of the apex falls into the room.

Taz says "...well that was exciting... I've made a new door!" - but we can see he's quite fucked up, at 51 of 134, so before we charge into more battles, we have to do a bit of healing - most of us could do with some, even if Taz has taken some of the worst of it. Gideon helps for 16, Fee-Ree for 11, then Taz pitches for everyone with L5 Mass Cure Wounds, getting a decent 22 for everyone. Gideon adds another 17 from the lay-on pool. Fee-Ree drinks a Potion of Greater Healing for 15 as well. We figure that'll do; we head out of Taz's new door and scramble down the pyramid (Deni tucking away all sorts of bits and pieces of Tesseret's remains as she runs past - "You never know, it might come in!"). Gnog carries Taz. Fee-Ree warns that her Fly spell is almost failing.
 
As soon as he's outside, Gnog looks towards the gate. The hole blown in the pyramid was on the side of the main entrance. **The ate is inert** - *but* - **no signs of the four gods**. He has to assume they got through. Some chaos at the gate, though; much of the army is now stuck there and very confused. That reminds Gnog about Liliana's control. The confused army seems to still be trying to go through the gate. It's as if the last command they received is the command they continue to follow.

We see Hazaret locked in battle with the Scarab god. Sphinxes attacking too. The Scorpion God was headed towards the gate too, apparently, but seems now infuriated that it's closed and is taking it out on everything around. Lashing out with a huge stinger. Samut's forces are being besieged. "There" shouts Gnog, "Can we help with that?" - pointing to the closer Scorpion God. He wants to help Hazaret but the people nearby are neither gods nor sphinxes.

Well, at least *that* messy battle is about 300ft away from the this part of the old pyramid. Deni, standing on the pyramid, switches quivers and draws another +1 arrow from the new quiver. She aims. "We need to get its attention" - she fires. Her abilities mean that the distance imposes no disadvantage, so her aim gets advantage - she hits. Gnog says, "Fucking hell, Deni, you just hit a *god* at 300ft... I think you win the points game." Damage roll is good too, 56 total (without the 'reading' bonus, so a very strong roll). Not far behind, Fee-Ree flies in 60ft and long-range (spell sniper) throws a Star at 240ft range. She hits decisively, doing 39 damage, but it seems resistant to some of the radiant damage's properties. Gnog looks to Gideon and says, "Well now they're just showing off, I'm terribly sorry about all this..." - chuckles away as he runs after them, puts Taz down carefully on the pyramid - Gideon asks, "Wait, Gnog, do you mean to *charge* the God?" and Gnog answers, "Yep!" goes into another Rage and makes chase via flight, but Gideon casts Haste shouting, "Godspeed!". Gnog skims close to the ground, covering rage-fly 40+20, + dash 40ft, doubled for Haste, plus the extra Haste extra action for 280ft total movement! Taz shouts Bardic inspiration as Gnog departs. Gideon shouts after Gnog, "I'll go for the other god!" and Gnog shouts back over his shoulder, "Thank you and good luck!"

The scorpion god turns. The insolence! 40ft tall scorpion. It strides our way. Gideon flies up too, with only seconds left on the Fly spells but we're hoping enough. Deni is stood ready, bow raised. Taz waits for Eldritch Blast range. Since Gnog is moving towards the God and it's moving towards us already, he ends up above it and tries to land on its back (only having travelled 260ft in practice).

Initiative rolls:

* Gnog 22
* Taz 22
* Deni 15 
* Fee-Ree 8

Gnog athl 26, he lands on the scorpion head (harder for the sting-in-the-tail to reach). Taz is a long way off; he advances down the pyramid and gives Deni bardic inspiration. He prepares Eldritch Blast, in case the scorpion god gets within range. Unfortunately, athl check is nat 4+5->9 not good enough for speed in his descent. He only gets about 15ft closer to the God.

At the end of Taz's turn, the god *charges* at us. It crashes through everything in its path, directly heading at us. It's 220ft away from Taz and Deni. Deni tries to *read* the God, given the distractions Gnog is providing by riding around on its head! She succeeds and attacks with another +1 arrow. Crit! Wow. 2d8+24d6+10 -> a solid 94 damage.

Fee-Ree throws firebolts (not wanting to destroy even *more* of the city or hit Gnog on its head). She thinks out, "Is it vulnerable to anything?!" and Gnog, being thrown around on the head can only think back, "How the fuck should I know!" so she tries Firebolt to see what happens. Hits, 4d10->25 damage. It does seem to have full effect. "If you weren't on its head I could target that" she 'thinks' at Gnog.

Now the God acts. It heals a fair bit, for 20. Then it tries to dislodge Gnog. Athl adv Gnog 25, God 21, so Gnog holds on. Now it tries with the stinger. 34 to hit LOL, yeah that hits! 28->14 piercing and 12d8 poison damage - but Heroes Feast, immunity? *No* - this is a God, it bypasses immunity. Gnog takes *54* poison damage which can't be reduced or resisted in any way (and max hit points would've been reduced by half of the damage), but he makes the DC21 con save and, amazingly, takes none because of Heroes Feast. It would've been but with resistances bypassed, so he's OK. He thinks out "FUCK!" loudly and then "Watch the stinger, it can bypass our immunities!"

The God now eyes up Deni. It picks up a nearby lump of masonry and throws it at her. It's a disadvantage, long range and she's agile, but it has **+17** - so gets 23 to hit - 24 bludgeoning damage dodged to 12, can't possibly save against the DC25 strength save and is knocked prone, starts sliding off the pyramid; dex save to try and arrest that; main inspiration blown on that, but makes the save. Now the God raises a claw to try and grapple at Gnog on its head but can't see him, so has disadvantage, and would grapple but Gnog uses the wings to bat it away. It continues charging, another 40ft; it is now at 180ft from Deni and Taz.

Gnog, per Fee-Ree's request fly-runs down its back then swings in the mid-back with the axe twice. 14 main damage, 13->6 radiant on a first hit; hits a second time, 19 main, 7->3 radiant; then he swings the axe down into one hand, reaches up, grabs the javelin of lighting from the quiver and throws it at the back of the neck. Despite range attack disadvantage from being in melee, it just hits! Piercing damage, 9; 17 lightning. The javelin disappears into the body of the God!

At the end of Gnog's turn, the God sees Deni is sliding down. It charges again. 140ft. That means it's 125ft from Taz - still out of range.

Taz's turn; prepared blasts wasted but he moves forward another careful 15ft and is now within 110ft of the God. He risks it, and tries Psychic Lance. L4. DC19 intelligence save, Taz figuring a God might be smart; but it's not! But it blows a Legendary Resistance and saves. Damage is 26->13 then. Taz thinks to the group, "Oh, it's strong, but it's quite dumb! And psychic damage hurts it!"

Deni stands and stages a strategic withdrawal (!) by running up the side of the pyramid again. She attacks, but without any advantage. Another +1 arrow, no advantage on this one but she'll get sneak damage if it's a hit thanks to Gnog being in melee. Unbelievable - another crit. Amazing. Gnog sees it coming and thinks quickly, "Nice shot, but you might be drawing too *much* of its attention...!" This time it's a **huge 114 damage**, so she breaks another personal record. The scorpion god is enraged and closes another 40ft towards Deni. 100ft away from where we started, but 80ft from her after her slide and 85ft from Taz. At least we can see that it's pretty badly injured. Can we actually do this? Can we take down a *God*?

Fee-Ree throws a L4 fireball at the head. "Don't go after her! Come and get *me*!" 9d6->41, a very high roll. It takes all of it. Its head swings and looks at Fee-Ree *and* Deni; the tail starts to swing around; Fee-Ree starts flying backwards, trying to draw it away, give it two targets. "Leave that girl alone! You are a bully!".

The god regenerates another 20, but still looks rough. It eyes up both Fee-Ree and Deni, but decides Deni is the bigger threat; charges that way. It uses its full movement to close the gap - 40ft, down to 40ft from Deni and 45ft from Taz. Flings rock again, hits again, nothing she can do about it. 4d10+10 -> 35 -> 17 uncanny dodge, str save to not be knocked down DC25, fails, gets knocked down and slides yet again, but makes the dex save to stop herself falling. She's slid 15ft so is now within 25ft of the huge god.

The God is unable to sting Gnog because he's too close to its tail, but instead it tries to swing the tail to dislodge him. 25 from Gnog again, and once again the god doesn't match this so he stays on; it tries to grapple him again with hits pincers. It'd hit but, once again, wings deflect. Only one of those left now! In response Gnog attacks back with the axe, the javelin no longer being available. He looks for the stinger, thinking maybe he can damage that or chop it off. He flies up to attack, figures "fuck it" and goes reckless, hits for 24 (18 and 12->6 damage), then again for 13+7->3, tries a third time via Haste, does get a hit but for crap damage, 9 (rerolled a 2 and got a 1 FFS)+8->4. 

The god gets to melee range of Deni, 5ft gap to Taz. It charges her, slamming into the side of the pyramid. DC21 dex save, even Gnog on the back. Gnog and Taz fail this very badly. Deni succeeds, but Gnog and Taz take 17 bludgeoning from the impact and both are knocked prone. Taz then is sliding and has to blow both Bless and BFS to make that save to avoid sliding further. Concentration check, he does at least hold Bless.

Taz stands. Nothing he can do; the creature's reach is huge, but he's uncomfortable being this close so he backs away a bit, 15ft max, still within its range and since he's disadvantaged figures he'll force it to blow a save hopefully and once again casts L4 Psychic Lance. It has to use a resistance again, taking 31->15 damage. It slumps against the side of the building... But then rises again, recovering with 20hp.

Deni disengages thinking "What the fuck *is* this?!" (Gnog says, "It's a god, keeps coming back, maybe if we hit it hard enough?") so she retreats and fires an arrow, hitting. A very solid 55 damage. Goes down, but on Fee-Ree's turn rises again, 20 hit points.

OK, this is a problem.

Taz arcana 21, with bless 25. Its wounds are automatically healing with innate abilities. It's a question of a nature of the damage. We need to find a damage type to which it is vulnerable. It's like trolls being killed with fire. He thinks that to the group; "It's a question of damage *type* like trolls with fire."

We've tried fire, psychic, piercing from the arrow, radiant, slashing, lightning, poison clearly shouldn't work, what's left? "OK, I'll try necrotic" says Fee-Ree, trying Chill Touch. She hits, dealing 4d8 -> a lucky 22 roll. But it only takes 11. "It's not necrotic!" and she backs away.

The god is within range of Deni; the stinger comes straight for her. Taz silvery barbs. It hits regardless. 4d6+10 piercing -> 23, dodged to 11. DC21 save despite using bardic (only a 1 on the d10, 6 temp HP via Mote Of Potential) and bless (4 on the d4) she only gets a total of 20, so fails, so is very badly fucked up - fully poisoned and takes 12d8 -> a high 57 damage. It then once again tries to grab Gnog, advantage this time because of his prior recklessness. Last use of wings deflects it one final time.

Gnog thinks out, "All I can think of is cold or acid, maybe force but seems less likely, I don't have any of that..." and keeps trying with the axe on the stinger. Three attacks again. Not reckless this time, since we're in the weeds now. Deni thinks "I have lots of cold daggers" and we realise thanks to Haste that Gnog can fly to her. So he tries something crazy - and reckless - tries to embed the axe in the scorpion! - hits, total 22 damage; leaves the axe in it; flies to her, grabs a weapon she points to at her boot (she's still prone), flies back at limit of haste motion; realises he's holding the white dragonfang dirk, and has two more attacks; it'd be a +13 to hit, 1d6+7 piercing and 2d4 cold. Hits for 9+6 cold. It takes 6 and *12* cold damage - Gnog sees it and shouts, "That's it!" as he hits. The freezing cold starts to cause a frostbitten, necrotic kind of effect, inner fire chilled like rapidly cooling lava. He strikes again. Hits for 11 slashing and another 6 cold, which it takes as 12. 24 cold in total. He's kind of mid-body, back near where the axe was.

The god slumps forward, falling onto the pyramid; but this time, it starts sliding down. From Gnog's position on its back, Gnog sees that part of its body are turning into ash and blowing away - it looks like it is disintegrating! There's a rising a cheer we realise around us; the archers and people around us had been trying to hit it, we hadn't even realised, but it was immune to non-magic damage. The scarab god in the distance turns, shrieks; the body turns into a sea of scorpions that scurry away. Dissidents all around try to squish them. Fee-Ree starts throwing out fire. Gnog runs to grab the axe and looks for the javelin; it's there too, covered in scorpions. He stomps around for a while! We're at least immune to poison. He gets the javelin back too and stows it.

Suddenly, there's a very loud shriek from behind him. Gnog whirls around. Hazaret has been pierced by one of the Scarab god's spikes. Then there's a glowing aura, in the air; it is Gideon, flying over, severing the spike with a weapon. Lots of scarabs around are flying almost as a miasma; undead all around, risen not Eternals are being pulled up under the god's control; Hazaret pulls herself off the impalement, picks up her staff and swings it; the sphinxes behind are singing; the song seems to hit with force against the scarab god to stop it advancing; the head is sliced right off by the staff! And then, impossibly, bursting out from inside - Samut, bursting out, she must've jumped *into* its mouth, korpeches swinging. Hazaret limps forward; the Scarab god though turns into a big hill of scarabs that start to disperse as the scorpions did. The sphinx songs changes into a wave of thunder, that disintegrates out and destroys the remaining body. The undead that were risen collapse back down.

There are lots of stragglers of Eternals, but most are on the platform, still trying to enter the gate.

Deni is a mess. Poisoned. Taz knows Greater Restoration won't work but gathers everyone and tries Mass Healing to help a bit. 29 for all. Deni urgently needs rest though. Gnog runs up to her, arm around waist, supporting her. She's clearly poisoned and sickly, breathing heavily. He reassures her as best he can. Hazaret is limping our way. The rest of the army is now dealing with stray Eternals. Sphinxes manage to form a perimeter to help. We all meet up in a middle area. Samut, Manesh, some getting healing from Sphinxes. Gideon performs some mass healing too. He's messed up. Samut, even moreso. Very dirty and dusty, covered in blood and ichor.

Samut says haltingly, "We were too late to stop them..." - Hazaret continues - "...my brothers and sisters are lost to the eternities. They have lost their minds. They attack your world. You must go, but your valour has saved this world."

The sphinxes speak a long sentence, taking turns for parts of it. Strange sound. "To think in a land of unending sun, that we were so blind we did not know we walked in pure darkenss; and it took a challenge, a heart and fire in the soul to ignite the spirit of a world that didn't even know it had died. You have brought back the songs and the stories to Amonkhet. We believe we have crossed the threshold. Our path to renewal has begun. We promise to look after this plane."

Hazaret says, "Samut. Do you have the arrows?" and Samut looks around; "...the warriors have them..." and a wagon is pulled up. Hazaret grabs them and hands them to us. "These are the last of my sister's arrows. The arrows of Ketra. The most powerful weapon for the defence of Naktamun. *You* have defended Naktamun. I only hope that they help in the battle to save your planet. These arrows can take down a god."

They're 10ft long! Only 3, for four gods. It'll have to do and it's a lot better than none. Although they're in a (beautiful) case, Gnog just has to tie up with some rope and try to sling them over his shoulder like a very awkward long, long plank. We have no idea how to fire them; we'll have to figure that out.

Samut says "I saw a bow on your ship". Well, yes the ballista... "Perhaps fired from that?" "It might work" says Gnog, "we'll have to see. If we're going to crash the ship anywhere, it might as well be on Ranvica."

Manesh thanks us, too. "Thank you for keeping the faith for us. I promise to lead the faithful down the path of righteousness, understanding and love. We will always remember the curious folk who fell out of the sky!"

Gnog turns to Hazaret and says "I know you're injured, and I very much appreciate the gift of arrows. But is there anything you can do to help speed our journey back?" She looks to us. "The Hekma was a magic that crossed planes. There is something that we can do, but I will require power. And that power only comes from belief. I will need people to worship me! But I could only hold it for so long. You must get in your ship."

Gnog turns to Samut. "Well, looks like this is goodbye..." - and Samut runs up to give him a deep hug. Hazaret turns to one of the sphinxes. "Take me to my temple. I have the most power there. I can open a tear, straight through to the Eternities - to the silver void." Gnog says, "Thanks, that'll save quite a few hours and a lot of danger." "It can only happen directly in the sky above my temple!" "Understood." "Hurry now... But you will come back and visit me some day, I hope, and see a flourishing city? I would love for you to see Naktamun the way I remember it."

* **Gnog thinks for a moment. He looks at Deni. Then at Samut. "Adults are always making promises they can't keep. But should I survive and Bolas be defeated, one way or another, before my final passing, I shall return. This I promise."**

* Taz says to Samut, "On that note, please can you find Orisa and tell her that we hope she gets to see the city she remembers reborn again. And we'll return her book as soon as we can, so that she can use it to teach the children what Naktamun can become".

The sphinxes add - "And we grant you one final gift." They turn to Taz. "You reignited the sphinxes song. We believe you know what to do with this.". They sing a note. A pure note of creation. Taz gains the **feat of telepathy**. "Now you must all hurry", the say.

Gideon comes up. "I am ready." Gnog shouts to Samut "Look after the planet for us!" just as Fee-Ree casts Teleport and just like that, we're back at the ship. The dust blankets come off and Taz gets into the helm immediately - we almost fall over - Deni lies down below, Gnog at her side. Fee-Ree and Gideon are up top. Fee-Ree comes down after a moment; "You're needed on deck for your eyes. I'll stay with her." Gnog stands, leaves, resting his hand on Fee-Ree's shoulder as he goes.

Navigation Taz 21 with BFS. Gnog perception adv 28. The city below already looks different - apart from the obvious, crazed army that just keeps walking at the gate pointlessly - he can see throngs now headed towards Hazaret's temple. That must've been what it looked like years ago. People kneeling. Some heads bowed. Some heads up, arms raised in prayer. Sphinxes sat on platforms around. Hazaret at the top of the pyramid, opened, sat atop a huge lounge chair of sorts (!) with people all around in full worship. She reaches up a hand. The corona around her head lights up. A beam of light shines straight up, into the sky above. A hole opens. A silver void below. Gnog shouts, "Hit it Taz!" and we dive into it.

There's the strange sense of self as we abruptly transition into the Astral Sea.

(Back on Amonkeht, a yellow canary perched atop a spire watches as the beam of light flickers out and the portal closes behind the ship).

Astonishingly, we realise that after leaving Manesh, it was a blur - everything took only around half an hour!

### Only 10:00 Ravnican. 3 hours awake. 7 hours remain on the feast.

Deni falls asleep below, very much more tired than the rest of us due to her injuries.

### 20000 XP (!) each - TAZ TO L16, ALL OTHERS TO L18

* Taz takes Counterspell (Magical Secrets) and, for his future, Plane Shift (Magical Secrets)
* Taz also forgets Comprehend Languages as he can use the MA at any time for that; instead, realises he understands the Teleportation Circle he tried once and learns it fully, realising that he can target a location on the Rock Of Braal provided he's in the Wildspace plane (Toril), or one on Amonkhet. **He secretly holds that one, so that Gnog is better able to keep his promise to revisit one day.**

Gnog figures he can sometimes maybe attack more often, getting the idea from Haste (he takes L2 Fighter for Action Surge). Gnog has a conversation briefly with Gideon; he's reminded of the end of the Tiamat war, very clearly and worries that Gideon might also just 'depart'. Not so. Gideon asks about the Astral Sea; not seen it before; Gnog gives him the chronometer as a loan to help keep track of time.

Gideon offers to take the watch (and the watch, har har) since Gnog is clearly very tired after Haste etc; Fee-Ree takes the helm, so Taz can sleep. She is *very* certain she knows where she's going - the place she wants to be more than anywhere. She's desperately worried about Arxcis; feels we've been away too long; worried about the gods that went through. For sure. "He'll be all right; he's very resourceful". Taz stays a while, playing music.

Since we've 5, we come up with a different rotation.

```
Period   1  2 (12 hours each)
PILOTS  TS TF
        FF FS

Period   1  2  3 (8 hours each)
OTHERS  GB GW GS
        gW gS gb  
        DS DB DW
```

We note that it's technically not allowed to long rest / sleep so soon after the last one; we assume there would be shuffling of pilot schedule etc. in the first few hours until people got to be tired enough for it.
