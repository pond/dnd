# Gnog: Part 21 (The Infiltration Of Amonkhet Part 2)

## Continuing day 56 (Ravnica 36, Riglan 92 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Friday (7 day week) - after a long rest - 30 mins prior rest with food plus 7.5 hours sleep

Day 56, 4pm Ravnican, Ravnica day 36 - Friday. Taz wakes us up.

We step out into the main area. A fair amount of activity. We find **Manesh** and ask if there have been any sign of Hazaret yet - still nothing. We ask about the location of the sphinxes; on the Sacred Mount, he's never been; 1-3 days travel. We'd have to fly. We ask if there's anything he needs *here*, if we were not to head off; much with the sick, old and tired. "Endless work, but gratifying" he says. Insight 21; he'd like help, but it'd be permanent help. All we can really do is make sympathetic noises.

Kharras might have ranged wider perhaps, so we go to see her. The Sacred Mount location? She knows *of* it but had really considered sphinxes mostly a myth. And if we were to help with things? There just isn't the garden capacity to feed everyone. **Food will run out in as little as ten days**. There might be ways to round up animals, extend farming, but that requires planning... She goes on at some length about vague ideas, but it's all survival stuff and they lack the resources. Trying rebuild some kind of settlement. There may be places nearby that they could clear and convert, perhaps; turn them into ways to grow food and places to have animals. Would take weeks and they might not have time for that.

* On the subject of fighters and an army, she thinks there may be as many as 350 able bodied fighters. That's what they'd have to take the city with.

We finally check in on Ghariab. His new project is with the soldiers, a changed rotation. There is discussion we overhear - being supportive, keeping up morale. A future exists and is worth living for. We bring up the idea of sphinxes - would they be useful for the fight? Of course, but that said, their plans have never involved any of that. Any urgent defensive issues, a bit like the scorpions? Always! Wandering undead, humans or monsters - marauders. This is how they lose patrols. Hazards abound.

Finally, we seek Samut to see how she's getting on. We saw her out in the dunes, from the hanging gardens, with a patrol. Not too far away, so we head out and try to locate her - being cautious because we don't know the desert and have no guide. It's over by a neighbouring building, about 600ft away from the place we exited. She's finding out the lie of the land - the guards are their eyes and ears for the dangers of the desert; when living in Naktamun, you never had to care. The Hekma protected everyone.

We mention the sphinxes. The Mount, yes, is a good chance. Samut points to a pyramid, distant, hard to see; Gnog perception 28, his eyes clearly see it; a guard reported a shape flying that way - thought it was Hazaret. Tales and myths do exist in fair number that the sphinxes gather out that way. On the crazy plans we have, there are elements of hope but would need more investigations.

As an example, she points out that we'd need to get across the Luxa to reach the pyramids enclosing the undead, in order to collapse them (if that were possible). It's a major river - *up to a mile wide* with embankments and constructions that are almost cliff-like, with channels, waterfalls and epic constructions to divert part it in places. Under the river's surface, the giant mausoleums were where embalming happened - so believed, crammed with the undead army. In the banks, giant constructions provide access both above and below through huge openings in vast artificial walls that channel the great river.

We decide we will seek Gideon. Hubris to try and help a god with sphinxes! Samut insists on coming. She's met Gideon before.

It would be an 8 hour walk along the paths she knows. We consider flying. There's also wormriding... But we lack the ability to summon them as Nissa could. The plan is to get the ship, in the end. We come with her, we gather what we need, wrap up against the sun and we lead Samut up to the hidden-ish Navigator.

We decide to give Fee-Ree a go at the exit. Taz helps with Guidance. Deni looks unconvinced - Taz gives Fee-Ree some bardic inspiration too. Everyone aboard; Fee-Ree lifts off and carefully tries to navigate out of the narrow exit. Thanks to all that, she's able to get out cleanly - 22 total, with a 8 on the d10 bardic - and we head off, following Samut's course. She's wide-eyed at the experience. "For all of our advancements, we've never had anything like this! I've never seen anything like this... What do you call this thing?" - and over the course of the journey, we explain as much as we can. She'd found old, hidden books - now considered heretical by Bolas - which discussed such concepts.

Suddenly, Fee-Ree yells out - "HEADS UP! Get on deck!"

Huge *dragons* are coming our way - a crocodile head, though. They're about the size of an adult red dragon; there are two of them coming from different directions. Samut tells us they're savage, primal beings of the desert, hiding in the deep, deep mountains; they are rare; "Glorybringers". It would be an awesome sight but for potential death.

Fee-Ree starts to bring us down, in case we need an emergency landing and we're drawing weapons; Samut asks if we can reach the ruins; Taz nav 29 figures it's possible but tricky and goes to assist at the helm. He drops in to touch her for Guidance, but has to jump out to see and give directions. He has to yell! No Message cantrip anymore. The rest of us have weapons readied. Deni is trying with the ballista; Samut helps effortlessly! Gnog draws back; strength 23; Deni aims but holds fire for now. Fee-Ree is trying to head down. She's doing OK but it's not her forte for sure. Intelligence-based insight for Taz; dirty 20; primal beasts, maybe he could do something to distract them... He gets the MA ready to issue L1 Command with the word "Challenge!", hoping it'll see each other as a competitor for us as the price.

Getting close to the ground but also within 60ft of both creatures! He targets one at random and tries his spell. It isn't wise enough to withhold; it swings to try and cut the other off immediately. The other breaks free and trying to get away, but does this by coming at us! Taz casts again on this second one; "Defend!" - despite what turns out to be a +8, it fails its save too and turns to defend - well, us or itself, we don't know and don't care!

Fee-Ree is able to take the moment distraction to find a plaza and comes in hot, half crashing us down and sliding heavily along the sand and flagstones. We jump out and see the two creatures fighting each other. Best Taz can do is quickly cast as large a Minor Illusion as he can to make us look like sand from their position; but in fact the two are kind of really getting into it, crashing into a nearby pyramid, the ground shaking; it feels like forever but probably only a few minutes and they head away. Quickly, we grab all the various brown blankets we had to try and hide the shine of the hull etc., best we can do in this open plaza - then turn to Samut - "Well, that was exciting! Where now?!"

Gnog perception 17. It looks like some kind of parade ground. A large temple in the distance, via an old promenade. Behind, in the other direction, a large pyramid with some kind of once-floating hedron above that's crashed down and ruined. Pitted metal underneath, with stone on top. Taz religion 21. The temple is where the living go. A place of worship. The pyramid is probably for the dead. A grand sarcophagus. Samut tells us that he was a pious person, in awe of Naktamun when first arrived - she recalls some of his words, trying to convince the others that he'd found a perfect society, where the gods walked amongst their people on a daily basis and how awe-inspiring and affirming that must be for a person of faith. Faith becomes faith in the gods being benign, rather than faith in their existence.

Gnog says, "Well then - if he was looking for answers, he'd look in a temple. And he'd probably find the biggest one. Which is - if I'm not mistaken - *that* way!" - pointing down the old promenade.

Closer, we can see the head of the temple. The head of a hawk; that's not one of the five. It's not Kefnet - an ibis. Another Ifnir old god not known to modern Naktamun, perhaps. The Avan people, Samut confirms, have hawk-like heads. As we get closer, we see movement - up, behind the crest of the hawk's head. Gnog tries to look closer - perception 28 - he's sure he saw the flutter of cloth, but it's gone now. We proceed forward, with caution!

A submerged entrance, buried in sand. We can't even get in that way; at least 10-15ft of the building must be under sand, barely a foot gap to the door top. We need to find a window; 10ft up; big drop down; we use the Rope Of Climbing to assist - it's a 25 foot drop inside! Knotted, the rope reaches easily. Deni climbs up the wall easily thanks to her new slippers, holding the rope, pulls on her goggles, but can't see anywhere to knot it. Gnog clambers up, using the rope a bit to help but not so much that he pulls down Deni! After that, he anchors the rope for others to come up, then drop down inside; athl 24; and then finally, he jumps down - a long way... Athletics nat 1, 4 total! He doesn't drop so much as slip on sand and lands on his ass, prone - very embarrassed - dex save 21 - he rolls out, so "only" takes 5 damage. Sits up, looks at Samut, and says, "No, really, I'm a professional".

"There!" shouts Deni, pointing. A window on the far side; something moving, running past. Gnog calls out, "If you're this Gideon fellow, we were hoping for a chat..." - Samut sighs, "We'll have to chase" - and Samut and Deni (at Gnog's request) go left; the rest go right. We turn a corner, entering some kind of upstairs room. It looks like it has a table, maybe a communing room of some kind; another doorway leading in the direction the person ran; looking at the windows, but can't see any glimpses. We keep chasing to the back room. A few steps down, almost stumbling as we drop down, another room with stairs falling further at the back. Now we can just see that the person has jumped into the building at a lower level and run into the next section. Humanoid, seems medium to large, burly, covered in cloth; running; Gnog shouts as we run, "Honestly, we're just here to chat!" "Stop following me!" - we continue the chase - Gnog shouting, "I'm really sorry, we wanted to hear what happened..." and so-on. Down more stairs. They run through a room with beautiful decorated coffins, gold gilded (and Gnog's now continuous attempts to end the chase are interrupted "...wow, these are really beautiful coffins! Anyway...") - **and then one of the coffins in front opens!**

The coffins have jackal faces, we realise. Some of the statues we saw on the way down do too. In fact there were lots. Not just hawks. In fact, there were others too. A pantheon. Three other coffins open now too. Four mummies appear and lurch towards us. The person we're chasing is well gone. We shout after, "Hey, are we supposed to like not hurt these things? They seem like historical artefacts...?" but he's not listening.

No Deni. Oh well. Just us chickens.

Initiative:

* Gnog 22
* Taz 9
* Fee-Ree 3

Gnog rages and dives forward at the most ornate looking one at the end of the room, hoping to attract at least one other nearby, but there are two more behind him after that. Swings twice, recklessly; 2 & 2! Miss, 1 & 7 (wow) - at least that's a hit, for an average 24 damage. It hisses. Suddenly a swirl of sand appears around it! Con save; a very solid 30. He manages to not get all the sand in his eyes, but it's harder to see the guy now.

The other one nearest Gnog comes up to attack, flanking; but it misses. It turns to stare at Fee-Ree, opens its mouth really wide - far wider than it should go - and a swarm of flies emerges. "Dreadful Glare". Wisdom saving. Mantle of spell resistance helps - it's a magical effect - she succeeds and is not afraid. Another mummy closer to her does the same; she resists again; it runs up and uses a rotting fist attack. It'd hit; Taz, Silvery Barbs, adv to Fee-Ree. Now the hit misses.

Arcana check for Taz; 17; he sees her dodge it after the distraction, and can see that this mummy is just filled with the Curse Of Wandering. The curse seems to be a *tangible* thing, infecting and infesting the body with rot. This curse can be transferred. He shouts, "Oh dear, they can *infect us* with the Curse Of Wandering if they hit us!" - at which point, the one nearest Taz tries to scare him. Wis save 16 not frightened, but now it moves to hit; at least not quite flanked; misses. Taz repeats, "You've really got to *not* let them hit you!"

Taz attacks this latest one with his rapier and Booming Blade, doing 15+7 damage total. Bardic to Fee-Ree.

Speaking of Fee-Ree, she moves alongside Taz and breathes fire on her closest mummy, and the one that attacked Gnog second of all, but just missing Gnog himself. 4d10 potential -> 24. Both fail to dodge and take full damage. Interestingly, they seem to be hurt way more than Fee-Ree expected; **48 damage**. The bandages catch fire! Gnog sees it and shouts over his shoulder, "Oh this is *way* better than those Scorpion Demons!"

A Legendary Action dampens his mood quickly enough... The 'fancy' mummy rears up somehow and *transforms*, polymorphing into a grand, golden figure of a mighty priest, at the height of their powers; levels a finger towards Fee-Ree and commands "FLEE!" - but she is not influenced. "Flee? There'll be no fleeing happening here except for the *fleas* on your body!" - Gnog remembers that for later. That's not going to go without comment when there's a moment.

The mummy now glares at Gnog. Thanks to his axe - he's really starting to like this axe! - which glows, he feels Ajani's presence almost and it also reminds him of Garren, which is at once comforting and distressing - and this gives him the advantage to avoid being scared (nat 1, nat 12 -> 22). The mummy changes its glance to look at us all. Its mouth opens and another barrage of insects fly out, but these seem to be a plague rather than just an attempt to scare us. The room is filled! Everything becomes somewhat obscured, difficult to move; con saves all round - Gnog 28, Taz 6 (ouch), Fee-Ree 19. Total damage 13 piercing damage. 13->6->3 for Gnog, 13->6 for Fee-Ree, 13 for Taz.

Gnog continues his reckless assault on the big bad. Hits for a very low 16, con save held so spell up, and a second hit for a solid 28 damage. Con save held again but it's looking a bit rough. The second mummy behind Gnog attacks now, but misses surprisingly; but then tries another dreadful glare, but this fails, because of all the insects - Gnog can't see it properly! Con save since still in insects - oh, *NOW* he gets the nat fucking 20! 21->10->5 damage taken.

Fee-Ree's mummy tries to attack but the insects hamper them as much as us. It misses. Taz's one has the same problem. (Everyone is +2 to AC basically).

Taz turns and goes for the mummy Fee-Ree burned nearby; hits for 22. This takes down the burned mummy. He saves against the worst of the insects; 10 damage.'

Fee-Ree twins firebolt, hitting the big guy attacking Gnog and the mummy near Taz; both hit; total 26 damage, doubled for the one near Taz which burns up. The one behind Gnog only takes the 26 - *almost* down! - she spends more resources to throw another firebolt, which works; it is taken down. The insect spell fails.

Gnog turns, recklessly attacking the remaining mummy. His first hit for 21 takes it down. Gnog shouts, "OK, fucks sake, that was pointless, they suck, let's go!" and runs into the next room, the others following. Nobody there, but another door. We run through, and a lot of "up". Some kind of sanctum? We think we might be at the other end of a temple, perhaps into the inside of  a head on the other side? An injured Deni and Samut inside - look like they've been fighting too - a knee on the person who ran and a knife out. "Do not even think about moving! We just had to battle some smelly scary fuckers to get here and..." - then she sees us - and the state we're in. We warn them about the Curse being more of a sickness. They battled snake mummies of some sort. Sounds nasty.

Muffled sounds below. Gnog convinces Deni to let him go. He stands and spits out a gag. He protests a lot; who are we, why did Samut bring us, etc. "THIS!" shouts Gnog and slams down the axe. He is confused for a moment then two emotions... Insight 14; not a great roll but a confused mix of fear and anger. Gnog says, "I did NOT steal it!" - more confusion - and Gnog continues, "We just want to talk. I've made a lot of mistakes with a lot of people making silly requests or demands when I don't know about them or who they really are. We wanted to hear what happened. I got this off Ajani." "Why?" "He gave it to me. We're part of the new Gatewatch."

A look of rejection. Almost jealousy. Gnog says, "Not our choice. Niv Mizzet's design. We were we all pulled by accident."

Samut leaves us to talk. She's hot-blooded and wants to get Gideon to help. She decides to wait outside (Gnog said, "Don't make the mistake I made with your generals").

We start talking. Gideon's shawl is removed; armour of someone who used to take pride in their uniform. A greek warrior almost. Copper-bronze hair, long, pulled back; coppery skin too from the sun; quite handsome in his heyday, but now quite old; wiry build, old, weathered skin; a uniform with beautiful, fine, scale mail, almost silvery. Each individual scale is painted with white and an outline of blue. Gnog looks closer and says, "Fine armour." "Yes. Yes, a hero's parting gift from my world. The world of Theros. We are supposed to be legends who live in myth, whose belief sustains and creates the divine." "On your world it does." "Yes. But I've lost all faith. There cannot be some supreme good in this world; everything that has happened can only be attributed to evil."

We try to get him to talk more, Taz eventually asking, "What happened?" - persuasion 25. The conversation goes on; gradually, bit by bit he opens up. Taz tries to offer sympathy and understanding, but an element of hope or at least revenge. We will stand beside him if he tries again to release Liliana. We won't abandon him.

Eventually, he starts to talk a little about our plan. There's a rising engagement. Eventually, he calls back in Samut. She sees his change immediately.

"Welcome back, warrior. Shed the mantle of the warrior. Come - there are many whose hearts and spirits will be lifted to see you walk amongst us."

He shows us a walkway - he travels the building on the *outside* because of the coffins. They don't stay down! A garnet heart - they reanimate after about 30 days.

We get back to the ship. We can't fit 6 for space flight but we can make it work for atmosphere. Taz mostly stays below. We're about to ask Fee-Ree if she's confident flying into the narrow parking space back "home" but she's already lifting off - "I want to get out of here!" she says, pointing to shambling undead that are heading towards the landing site.

Flying low, we fortunately avoid catching the attention of any of the dragon-sized monsters!

### 2750XP each for the battle (Deni included via RP of sorts) plus 1000XP each for Gideon; Taz to LEVEL 15

In the hour long flight, we're able to short rest and heal - except Fee-Ree, busy flying! - and Taz realises he understands a L7 spell that might trap Tezzeret. He quietly lets Gnog know, away from the others, thinking that such a high risk piece of information might be best not shared too widely.

Fee-Ree does an excellent job of threading the ship back into the "parking space" through the entranceway.

It's 7:30pm Ravnican. We have been awake for 3.5 hours.

Once back at the encampment, there's a degree of elation. Samut was right - he lifts their spirits. Two more generals are on-side. Just Manesh remains... So we go to him and say, "We were planning on a little excursion and Samut said you might be interested. Care to go and try to convince some unusually quiet sphinxes to talk?!"

"If you are seeking the sphinxes of myth - I feel I am *compelled* by duty and bound by honour to come with you!" Gnog replies, "Then I certain won't stand in your way. Gather what you need. We will travel by air, but it will still be a few hours there and back."

Waiting for Manesh gives Fee-Ree a chance to rest too.

By 8:30pm Ravnican (we have been awake for 4.5 hours), Manesh is ready, we're all rested up and we head back to the ship. Fee-Ree is enjoying flying and confident in navigation with Taz's ongoing help, so he once again throws in some Guidance and we head off, expecting quite a long flight time, keeping low and keeping a sharp eye out for any distant airborne threats.

It's the hotter part of the day, with the big sun having risen. Gnog is on watch on deck, with one of the blankets hooked over the ballista for a bit of shade. Deni's red dragon armour means she's unconcerned with the heat and joins him, but Manesh and Taz keep below in the shade, chatting and learning about each other. Manesh has many regrets and much guilt. Taz offers a shoulder to cry on, but a balance of understanding and consolation - Bolas' ruse was centuries in the making. Guilt is inevitable, but *blame* is hard to assign to anyone but Bolas himself.

There are, in the dunes, remnants here and there of oases. Small settlements, abandoned. The distant mountain, slowly getting bigger; visible from the whole region, so it must be really huge. Some way into the third hour of flight, we're close enough to see details.

It's the highest peak of a range, hidden by the shimmer and dunes in the lower peaks which are dwarfed by this astounding, old, jagged - towards the top - rock. It's pale in colour, with a yellow-orange kind of cast to the rock itself. Gnog is more used to mountains covered in vegetation at least on lower slopes but here, none; layers of sand and loess covering bare rock, worn smooth by sand and wind over millennia.

The mountain is several thousand feet high. The lower slopes are not visible, covered by lower hills and mountains of the range that shimmer hid previously as well as dunes.

There are two distinct faces given our approach; one left and one right, diagonally away from the way we've arrived. Various deep chasms runs down in between and across. Gnog leans to Deni - "Just like old times, let's try keeping left!" and shouts down to Fee-Ree. "Let's try looking at the left race, see if we can spot any openings". She brings the ship around and gets into a hovering point. We set up a relay with Taz and Deni to pass messages to and from the ballista deck down to or up from the helm.

It's taken about 3 hours of flight now so far, to get here and start having a good look. Disav perception 1,19 -> 1+9 -> 10; luck point blown; another natural 1; sigh. The telescope helps for detail but it only lets Gnog see a small area of mountain. He *does* spot the strange Glorybringers, a few of them flying around, so it seems like we have little choice but to head lower, towards the foothills and crevasses to try and keep low and out of sight, or at least, out of their area of concern.

We change tack, since we're down here. Gideon walked up to this place and while the dunes always move around, there must be *something* he saw some way up. But not as high as we were, it'd be too high to climb. Investigation (with another luck point blown) 20+1. There's an entrance about 20% of the way up. We bring the ship in closer, but very cautiously; there's no idea of what might actually be in there - sphinxes, dragons, anything!

Close up, it looks to us that it might be man made - given away by a flat plaza-like area around it. We fly in with Fee-Ree asked to set down and quickly see *ten* statues framing the entrance. We set down and all disembark to look at the statues.

Manesh thinks there's a religious feel, ten *different* statues with different animal heads; a kingdom? A realm, ancient? Naktamun never ventured this far - as far as records go. And we know about the records. He does point out all five of the Naktamun gods present. There's also we see the hawk god, which we point out to him. There's a wolf, a bear, some kind of amphibian says Manesh but isn't sure what, and the last is surprisingly a duck. Mallard perhaps! We note, no insects - no locust.

"Whoever this kingdom was, they had water" points out Manesh, given the duck. Looking closer we see channels cut around places that might've been for that; Taz nature 20+5, "oh, wow" - he realises that this is engineering and throws out some minor illusions. In his mind, beautiful; old urns where things would've grown. Trees in the plaza. Channels for irrigation, diverting water from rivers that used to flow down the mountain. An aqueduct over the door, pretty much, waterfalls cascading down over the statues. He thinks that possibly the whole area we're parked upon was once a shallow pool.

Gideon had given us some vague notions of where he came when he saw the sphinxes, but he didn't mention *this*, which seems a pretty big omission - but it was a long time ago and much regret since. Or we're in completely the wrong place...

...but we're here, and we've nothing else going on right now and if we did find another door or entranceway, it'd be no more or less viable than this. We do know that the sanctuary of the sphinxes story was *high* up on the sacred mount; they fly.

In we go. Taz uses dancing lights and Gnog lights up the axe once inside, Deni with the goggles. Manesh is looking around in awe. 25ft wide entranceway, 20ft statues, and more statues now *inside*. But these are all of Kenra - jackal headed. Very weathered on the side facing the door, from presumably blown in sand. It looks like mosaics were here; some remnants, that Taz figures are of a jungle city, lush. The more intact ones all show in every scene two suns in the sky at the same time, every time.

Moving in, stepping stones - if we imagine that there was water here - and different gods in statues here. And a revelation in this part; mosaics showing *nighttime*. Taz starts figuring out the orbital mechanics given his time with the orrery. The two suns are on slightly different cycles. Over hundreds, or perhaps more like *thousands* of years, they go through overlapping periods. When this city was alive, they had days and nights.

The coming of the 2nd sun was a sign for Nicol Bolas; it appears between the horns of the temple, we were told, while the other is still visible. There's some overlap again. Perhaps in a few hundred or thousand years, there'll be nights again and maybe some chance of recovery for things in the coolness of dark.

Manesh scurries ahead to see something - but then freezes, steps back and says - "We're not alone. I can sense... Undead."

We've gone in about 180ft, no more. Taz tries sending the lights forward; this passage - gallery? - just continues into the mountain, at 300ft being the limit of the lights and vision. "I think we have to press on", says Gnog, "until we find out if this goes up at all, or figure out what it's about." 

Manesh is afraid and hanging back. In front, we finally reach it - a range of shambling undead. They start to move in our direction. 20-odd, so that's more than we really want to deal with. "Strategic withdrawal" suggests Gnog and we scurry back, speeding up as the undead are too! Hasty retreat, Manesh leading the charge. So jump onto the ship, but the undead don't come out into the sun. They stop inside and hang back. This gives us a chance to look at them. They're wearing a different kind of thing. Not mummies; soldiers once perhaps, but wasted away, dessiccated like mummies but without wrappings. Headdresses, breastplates, shoulder pads; one sword in each hand. Not human - a mixture of Kenra and *something else* which Gnog can't quite figure out.

"Not too friendly" says Gnog. "Grave robbers not welcome. No bad thing!" 

Curse Of Wandering. The temple's priests and guards, risen again. We decide to try navigating up these chasms - actually, river valleys - to give us some cover as we lift and search again for more entrances, but higher up. A river to left and right. Keep left. Close up it's more obviously a dried waterway; rapids areas, waterfalls, rock outcrops that would've been islands. Exposed faces are wind-and-sand smoothed but the chasms are more protected and more jagged.

Movement! In the shadows, up ahead. A large head, crocodile, large claws, perching. Glorybringer. Any caves in this area are probably a favourite of theirs. We know from Gideon that the Sphinxes within the mountain rather than in any natural depressions or open areas. Gideon said he'd spent weeks searching on foot, and so perhaps we have two options; set down and spend weeks searching as well, since he can't be specific about what path he took since he spent weeks wandering until happening upon the right place; or we have to risk it and fly up to try and spot it from the air, up high, knowing we'll attract the Glorybringers. Since we don't have weeks, we have to do that!

Taz perception, 17; Gnog survival 17; flat d20 roll 19. We're on the way up, getting high risk but Taz spots a ledge in the top 30-40% of the mountain and figure we can try maybe on foot from there. The ship is disguised with tarps. Gnog's survival roll finds some old tracks - well, more just worn patches in the rock - not much sand way up here; we follow, with Fee-Ree using a couple of L5 Fly spells to help and be a safety net in a few places that are very sketchy. We're moving around to the right-hand face as we travel. With sorcery points she can extend each to 20 minutes and in the second spell, about ten minutes in with some fly remaining, Gnog spots an entrance ahead. There is definitely a path here, now we've got to it. The ledge we parked on maybe was a camp area?

The path before the entrance has in places some carved out stairs, but now wind-worn and smoothed off. We're on the ground and haven't encountered the Glorybringers. The entrance has nowhere nearby we could've set down the ship. It's carved, sort of, into the side of the mountain where there's a bit of an overhang. 15ft wide, 12-15ft high, in shadow. We walk in. The walls inside are shaped, but the opposite of just about everything we've seen elsewhere - not wide at the bottom and looking like a truncated pyramid; these are narrow at the base, sloping up and out, then a kind of diamond chisel top (3 sided). It's smooth sided, but doesn't look *constructed* in a man-made way, but more *engineered* - shaped out of the rock directly, somehow.

With just dancing lights up for now, we follow along. A short distance in it stops; the floor just drops away! A large cavern. Taz sends the lights down; we can see the walls and floor but it's within the edges of the 120ft range and vision; it's big; same shape on a grand scale as the corridors. Then the lights go out! Taz is surprised. He tries recasting over his head; then slowly puts the lights down; Gnog perception 17; the light goes out. Gnog almost sees something. Deni spots something too and points. Taz looks with his long range dark vision; *something* down there; and it is moving a bit. It's a platform of some sort. It seems to be rising and moving sideways, towards the *left* hand wall. No way around there.

The lights go over there again, Gnog perception 11 (rolls a 2), he almost sees something, but crap roll; the lights go out; tries again; Gnog perception 15 (rolls a 6), still can't make it out, then it looks like something *on* the platform maybe has flown off; we hear some wing beats and something landing gently. Taz suggests that the thing on the platform has flown away maybe and sends the lights slowly back to the platform, to see if they stay on this time. They do, and *now* we can finally see this hexagon-shape platform. It's thin and made of stone. It's just floating; some can still fly; Taz and Gnog can't, but Taz estimates by lights that it's only about 80ft, Gnog can max fly about 100 when raging, so he grabs Taz, rages, and runs for it.

Now we're on the platform and look around from here. It's just next to a wall; no corridor; a few other platforms, perhaps, one with movement thinks Taz? Way up on an opposite side is one moving towards us - the far wall is too far away, more than 120ft, but perhaps not *that* much more and this platform has come into view. It stops about 100ft away. Taz tells us that there's a sphinx on it. It just stands observing us. Taz says its head movements imply some confusion or at least, a quizzical nature; then the platform withdraws.

Taz calls out, "Hello. You look like a sphinx. We were looking for sphinxes. My name is Taz, what's your name?" - he notes they all have heads that face-on seem shaped almost like the corridor, with manes that seem almost geometric, as if collars or clothing rather than hair.

Flapping of wing sounds. Another one, slightly different. It has more rounded features, female looking perhaps; the mane is more diamond-shaped, with some variations. Again, the quizzical look. Taz asks if the manes are styled deliberately, or how they're born? He sees they're different? No response. But she leans forward, so the head protrudes past the mane, it fanning back a bit as she does, making the ears more visible. She looks and for the first time, blinks; Taz blinks back, slowly. She looks up. Another has flown down. And another platform. Taz says "OK, there's four now everyone". They're all just watching.

The first brings the platform closer. Taz can see now that this one is clearly bigger, but it's all in black and white sadly. He says, "There are five of us. We don't mean any harm. It would help if they were allowed to see you. May I put up some gently lighting? I can see in the dark but most of them cannot."

The large one sits down and folds its wings. Taz hopes that's a "yes" and starts with one, small glowing orb that he lifts just above us to cast some light. One of the other sphinxes immediately shield their eyes. Taz apologises if it's too bright. But they look at the big one, then relax; surprised, perhaps? Maybe they can't understand him, but the big one seems to.

Taz sees colours now. The big one is blueish grey. The closer female is a golden colour. One that covered its face is white. The other is a dark, purple-black. Taz exclaims to the others, "Do you see? They're quite marvellous! Very beautiful! I have never seen anything like them!"

The main platform and brings itself closer. Only 15 feet away, 10ft up. The sphinx just sits, tail hanging and swishing a bit. It raises a paw, which hangs in front and above. It opens and closes the paw a bit, as if stretching it. Padding like cat, then puts it back down again. Taz mimics with his fingers. Quizzical look. It repeats the padding. Taz says, "I'm sorry I am not really sure how I should respond. I am Taz, this is Gnog, Fee-Ree, Deni and Manesh."

The female's tail starts to twitch faster and it makes some gestures with its paw. The main one responds with paws too. Another huffs.

Taz realises it's language. Insight with BFS only 15. Rudimentary though. Deni comes up. "It's not a sign language; they are trying to communicate with each other and they're trying to communicate with us but it's frustrating for them."

The purple-black one is patiently hanging back and watching. Taz says to them, "If you can at least understand my words, please raise your paw again." All raise a paw! Taz says "Ah, thank you. So you cannot speak and must use those gestures to communicate" - all raise paws - "but it is slow and frustrating for you. I understand."

The purple one - no mane actually - brings the platform forward and leans in and nods. The other paw is raised, towards Taz; stretches out, touches its head and brings it around its face. Taz asks, "Magic or other effect prevents you from speaking and singing?" - all nod. Some raise paws. Taz says, "Oh my, that must be terrible for sphinxes! I don't know if we can help but we will certainly try, if you wish?"

Deni chips in. "Is it just speech that you are prevented from?" - paws raise. Deni says, "I'll try something then... Taz I need you in on this! Can you communicate to tell them that she's going to need some time and please patient" so he communicates the concept - spell, ritual, will take a while.

She's cast Telepathic Bond on Taz and the four sphinxes, Fee-Ree, Deni and Gnog. Taz realises immediately. He says to Manesh, "Please bear with us - we may be quiet for a while - I will explain everything as soon as I can. I apologise".

We can hear each other and the sphinxes and the pictures and sounds and songs of the sphinxes. Glorious!

"You can hear! We can hear!" - and they converse - "Oh, I've missed your voice and thoughts! My mate!"

They introduce themselves. The big one is **Akroa**, a warrior. The purple, **Sheth-Heppat** - the leader, we hear. He's the oldest.

Gnog introduces us - as they must realise, not from their world. They welcome us - if only we could've seen it at the zenith. They ask permission (yes) and show us visions of a lush, beautiful world full of song when the sphinxes were worshipped for knowledge and wisdom. The whole mountain was set up for them, the sanctuary just the pinnacle. Not necessarily benevolent! Trials, riddles, they delighted in pushing civilisations forward. Their magic, the magic of song, carved mazes and puzzles into the mountain itself. The temple at the bottom we learn was the old entranceway and *would* have led up here, but only on old, now probably very dangerous open stairs, possibly with mazes and certainly with a lot of undead.

Then a dark vision. Sheth-Heppat pushes his thoughts. We are shown their awareness of a "serpent", flying serpent - we see a vision of **Nicol Bolas - arriving about 400 years ago**. He passed all of their tests; they marvelled at his intellect and skill; he used to sit where we sit now; they'd debate philosophies and thought experiments... Fascinating. There were more sphinxes back then - **there are only four left now!** - but it became clear that his intellect had constructed a plan, that they played along with initially thinking it was just a thought experiment, but then realised with horror that he intended to implement it. "How do you know what is good and what is evil? If you could change the perspective of everyone to the point that they viewed everything you did as good, that you could corner them, logically, into accepting that your words were the truth - could you not change what is evil into good, and good into evil?" He argued it's all constructed and not absolute.

The penny dropped. They saw that he had been talking to other gods and infiltrated their inner circles; their very minds; he *killed* the insect gods and the other gods didn't really react or stop him; the insect gods were the "evil" gods. But then he killed "in the middle" gods and there was some dissent. Then the sphinxes noticed he had discovered a way to change the gods' memories, and he'd given them new memories where they forgot their old lives. He'd wiped out Ifnir, who'd tried to resist him and harness demonic powers in the process - but that made it even easier for Bolas to get Gods on his side, since he pretended to oppose evil. He wiped out traces of the past, constructing a new history for Naktamun. "Only" a few hundred years ago.

The sphinxes met and decided this was not something they wanted on this world. Went to confront him; he used magic to silence them and stop them from being able to ever tell anyone had happened. They couldn't warn people of Naktamun. They couldn't use their magic either. They've been hiding, helpless and silent ever since, as the world crumbled around them.

Gnog "thinks" to them - "I didn't think there were many more ways I could find to hate Nicol Bolas, but there we have it."

They share what they know. He's harnessing the Curse of Wandering to build his army; the curse itself a corruption of a planet-wide magic that they have a word for and we recognise the concept - a worldwide spell. When the planet started to desertify from the changes of the suns, the civilisations tried to use magic to reverse this, trying to infuse life; stop plants etc. from death; but it went wrong. *Nothing* would truly die - things died, but rose as undead. The plants failed anyway, unable to come back as undead.

The sphinxes had tried to explain that it was cyclical but the civilisations there couldn't survive in a few hundred years of desert so proceeded anyway.

Lazotep had been intended to be used for vision quests; protect you when you cross into the etherial and higher - or lower - planes. If guided and protected, your personality remains intact. Not "shredded by the solar winds of the blind eternities".

Gnog asks if they understand the nature of the magic that silenced them and have any idea how to reverse it? They send images - almost algorithms - Taz, arcana thankfully very high. 31. It's a sort of permanent Silence spell, cast on the sphinxes themselves, not in an area. Very high level so very difficult to dispel and they can't anyway as they have no casting. They had no way to tell anyone either. Taz thinks it could be as high as L7. He has L7. Dispel Magic at L7! He casts that on Sheth-Heppat - Charisma check with BFS 21, he realises there was L9 Wish spell sitting on top locking things in. He breaks that spell instead and is surprised - says "Oh, that was something else..." - tries again on Sheth-Heppat. L3, since he needs the charisma check anyway. Cha check - exactly 17, precisely the DC.

The spell shatters and because of the L9 lock *all* are released. There's a roar! The sphinxes rise up, and it turns louder and into harmony, and this turns into sing and the whole cavern lights up. Beautiful decorations! Blue, pink, bright lights, covering the walls everywhere. It's incredible. The platforms light, everything. Taz turns to Manesh, laughing, and says, "See! That's why we were quiet, yet managed to help. The sphinxes sing on Amonkhet once more!"

The song is almost unbearably moving. Triumphant initially, deep sorrow, rising up to hope, finishing anger and righteousness; then gratitude, love and unity with them all ending on the same note.

They speak in a language Taz doesn't understand so he hastily casts Comprehend Languages - it's Celestial - "You have broken our curse. There are only four of us left, but each is the equivalent of an army. **We will rise once more and lend our voices to yours**. We too wish to drive this dragon from this world. Do you require a plan?"

Gnog finishes crying his eyes out after the song, Taz tells him the question, and Gnog relays what we have - the idea of collapsing the pyramids to trap much of the army, wipe the others out after the gate is closed, to at least try and experiment to make sure Liliana's connection will be severed. They ask if we have an army, then? Manesh speaks Celestial; he rises. "Yes! Yes we have the beginnings. We have just one got, Hazaret..." The sphinxes say she came but did not understand their lack of speech.

"This army. Where is it?" - we explain - "Shall we go there?" "Fuck yes!" and in the end they give us a lift down the mountain to get to the ship. They go out the corridor to the ledge edge, launch out wings spreading and circle over the ship. The Glorybringers look up, see us, then suddenly retreat! We land by the ship and thank them; we will guide them in the ship, a bit slow but I'm sure they won't mind. The female sphinx veers off to find Hazaret.

We can take a higher and straight flight path. Fee-Ree has us on final approach within about 2 hours and 15 minutes. We land with 3 sphinxes outside the camp. Holy shit. People outside are running outside because the scouts are obviously telling them what was approaching! **There is elation. Disbelief. The sphinxes are singing and talking**. These people have *never* seen them; many didn't believe; Manesh moves amongst them excitedly talking. They're invited inside and duck inside to find a small corner they can make comfortable.

We just sort of sit back and let this happen. It's their moment, not ours. Karras is the last to descend from the gardens, wary; but then sees what's happening and gives us a surprised look - with respect - speaks to us; "you *did* come through; you have done more than we thought possible; you *do* are about our struggle - not just empty words. That I can respect. And that I think is worth fighting alongside you for, because we are fighting alongside. Not for each other - alongside." Gnog says, "For sure. Wouldn't miss it for the world!"

The sphinxes spend a while sharing the *true* history of the world. The dissidents knew things were wrong; but the sphinxes fill in the gap of what's *right*.

With knowledge comes power.

### 2500XP shared equally.

## Day 57 (Ravnica 37, Riglan 93 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Saturday (7 day week)

We were out for about 5.5 hours. After an hour of the initial catching up and surprise, there is food and song. About an hour into that, we realise how tired we are. It's 04:00am Ravnican - we've been awake for 12 hours and are getting very tired. We'll have to sleep. (7 hours needed for a long rest, after an hour of the relaxing with food and song - DM fiat allowing two such rests within a technical 24h period, which is prohibited by strict rules).

It's 11am Ravnican when we awaken.

* **Gnog checks the time, looks at some notes and figures out how many days have elapsed on Ravnica, but Taz reminds him that while we saw the time on the Astral Sea as being 30-31 hours on the chronometer, time passes differently there and it might've been longer or shorter for Ravnica. We won't know until we get back.**

A moment of disorientation, because - well, what now?

Figure we'll see what everyone is up to - sphinxes, generals, Gideon - especially Gideon - and Samut. Gnog's still kind of reeling (in a good way) from yesterday, because when the sphinxes started to sing and knowing that they'd been silenced - even the two that were mates - for centuries, really hideous, the song was one of the most moving things he'd ever experienced. If not *the* most.

We find the sphinxes first. They're talking to dissidents, including the builder general guy, Samut and Gideon. They're telling them that there are other allies - we walk into, "...who we would count as allies still, out in the deserts. Those who have kept their distance from Naktamun, those who would still answer - well, those who *may* answer a call - to arms." Sheth-Heppat says she'll go and see if she remembers the old ways, to find these allies.

Gideon is listening. Gnog thinks he's there for many reasons, not all of which Gnog understands. That he's there at all is something to be grateful for. What drives him to stay? Gnog does not know. Taz and Gnog together note that he's going through familiar motions but we don't know his motivations or heart. A practiced, habitual behaviour hiding what's actually going on. Perhaps we ought to try and talk.

Deni sees us doing this and distances herself a bit. She'll let us do that. But she's not sure it's worth trying to reopen and repeat the conversation before. She's not sure what we might achieve. Getting to know him comes with time, not with pressure. We agree; we need to let that relationship develop on its own.

Instead, we head up to the gardens to see how Karras is doing. She's not there; nobody is. So we come back down and ask around. "All of them went to the building *over there* with the sphinx who returned" - ah! Of course. Hazaret. OK, we cover up with our shawls and head over.

It's not too far. The interior of this rather large building, a slanted roof, light reflected by mirrors, still mostly unbroken, along the underside of the ceiling. Karras is here with the female sphinx and a few of the other gardeners. We learn that they've been spending time, planting a farm. Magic aid. Gnog runs up, looks around and shouts to Karras, "...But this is wonderful! I went up to the hanging garden to ask how things were with the food. And this here is what you were dreaming of!" She answers "It's still tenuous but we'll be better equipped to deal with things here because of the angle and slant with the mirrors. They do better if there isn't sunlight all the time. The water situation is probably the hardest thing, but we'll figure that out. Thankfully, the flow of air here lets out less moisture." The floor here is above the sand level so it's stone and doesn't just leak water.

There is talk of the sphinxes and their past; the beauty of their song; and how this has meant we really *do* know some of what this place was like. She invites us to a meeting of elders later; they'll be considering the "future of living here" and implies that we should raise the question of a plan to secure that future, perhaps in Naktamun.

She thinks it'll be in about 3-4 hours time (there's a reference to having sheltered from the heat of the big sun and rolled dough for the evening bread).

Gideon is asked about the plan to isolate an eternal. There are elements he can help with but recommends we do get other perspectives.

We talk to the sphinx Akroa, the warrior. A difficult conversation - helpful outwardly, but riddles! What do we know; what don't we. We're focused too much on what we don't know and trying to answer a hundred questions. In the end we figure - and this rolls over into the meeting which actually is called earlier than we expect, taking place at **13:00 Ravnican (awake 2 hours)**:

* Gate closed, gate open; the army doesn't know where the dissidents are to march if controlled; and if it goes wild, it won't reach them other by accident after a while
* Manesh is *convinced* that Liliana does control the army and it's her chain mail that's the magical artefact providing much of the power needed to do that - that's where her demonic pact powers lie now...
* ...Gideon adds that Liliana had 3 demonic pacts to extend her life and gain massive magical power, but she's been killing off those demons since to break all of those contracts - including killing the one here on Amonhet that appeared in the first of the Hours (and Manesh can attest to that demon being killed)
* Whatever happens if the gate is closed, collapsing the pyramids to bury the majority stored there is a good plan anyway, if it can be achieved
* A key tho is to evacuate now as many living as possible from the city; both the dissidents "eyes and ears" and anyone Manesh can convince
* Then the leap of faith - help us close the gate; we'll get back to Ravnica and "defuse" Lillian.

One step at a time...

* Get us a path to Oketra's temple so we can get plans for the three pyramids
* Find a way across the river so we can get to the God Pharoah's temple
* Get hold of people who know the way to shut down the gate
* Prepare Manesh to do some industrial strength preaching
* Pull everyone out

...then in quick succession:

* Collapse the pyramids if we can
* Shut down the gate
* Get off-world.

The meeting is winding up after around 2 hours (**15:00 Ravnican, awake 4 hours**). The word is sent out to see if anyone has a way to get to Oketra's temple. We just have to wait on that front.

The heat of the afternoon; many people taking siesta; the bread is rising; suddenly, signalling from outside. "Wake up! Wake up! She approaches!" - we think, hmm, **Hazaret**! So we head out, quite excited. We can see a silhouette in the desert, headed our way. Very tall - maybe 30, 35ft. Walking; gleaming countenance, skin jet black with the jackal head clear once she's close enough but with a huge kind of crown that looks almost sun-like around her head.

30-35ft looks a lot bigger up close than we expect. She's huge. Twice as big, almost, as giants we've fought and befriended on Toril.

First, the sphinxes sing to her. She knees down on both knees to get closer to everyone. Turns her head down and lays down a 40ft long staff/spear she carries; her face is strange. Not that it's a jackal; but because it looks like almost a funeral mask, apparently made of pure gold. When she speaks it does not move the mouth, yet it is *not* a mask; it might be *like* one but is clearly nonetheless her actual face. It isn't fixed and static, it has expression - liquid gold, then! - but the voice is projected out somehow. Not telepathy either. Just an "omnisound"!

"I see you have grown in strength and number, but most importantly you have grown in spirit and bravery. You are joined by magical beings and are building an army. Are you preparing to march under my banner to face my brothers and sister? To reclaim the city?"

The group says, "We have council..." - and introduces us. Hazaret continues, "Ah! Your new allies, your champions! Of course, Samut; Samut the indomitable champion..." (Samut bows) "...I greet you. I see the wanderer has found his heart once more and donned his mantle of courage again to stand in the sun." Gideon looks a bit sheepish and sort-of-bows. "And more beings from other worlds. Beings from *three* other worlds, in fact."

* We're thinking, huh, Taz is Rock Of Braal. Deni is definitely from Toril. Fee-Ree or Gnog? **Hazaret seems to be looking at Gnog** - and the penny drops. He was right, he must have been right?! His clan *WAS* **descended from the Prometiia Goliaths**?

"I am Hazaret. First of the second-borns of Amonkhet. And you are?"

We each introduce ourselves, Gnog using his full formal name first.

"Are you the fire that now burns in the hearts of my people? You have found and freed the sphinxes and brought this song back to our world, which in itself is a deed worthy of story. But your path does not end there."

She asks where our path goes - so she might bless it. We figure she means the plans at Oketra. That's the cat God; we're told that her temple is a maze - a puzzle. We must be tenacious and curious. To get to it? Reach the Monument Of The Five. From there, there are underground passages to each of the five temples. Or if we don't fear heights, there's a way to descend down to the entrance of Oketra's temple, for hers is set into banks of the Luxa (oh, *fuck*, I mean of *course* it is - right in the middle of a sea of Eternals). There may even be a possible river approach, but we'd have to pull ashore before hitting waterfalls.

Ugh. Well, we *do* have a foldable boat. But the *Luxa*, full of undead?!

"Once you have the plans, you can get across the Luxa to the pyramid complex, to the City Of The Dead" (where the huge mausoleums are) "and the entrance to that city is through one of Ronas's acolyte training grounds; a small temple to Ronas, filled with her naga".

Cripes.

"You can use runes - symbols - you may have to kill your way to get past the temple (!) but once inside the City Of The Dead, you can place the runes upon the supports of a pyramid and silently leave, and nobody will be the wiser; the symbols can be activated at a certain time..." - and Hazaret produces a long scroll, which has basically got instructions; Deni can read it. We won't know what supports those are, or how many, until we get the plans. She also says "...and if you wish you can add this other symbol to allow me to set them off at a time of my choosing". (We go for that!)

"I would do anything for my people. They showed me the truth before it was too late."

Gnog says, "Funny thing - they kind of did the same thing for us too."

"It is ironic that Kefnet was a god of knowledge yet nobody was protecting the truth. We had allowed a stranger into our midst and trusted him. I will warn you however - there are *two* of the insect gods that yet live. I managed to fell one."

Gnog responds, "I was afraid of that. One step at a time though."

"I will do my best to keep them off you should a battle break out - but it is two on one!"

Gnog laughs and says "yes, those aren't ever fun odds - but I keep finding myself saying this kind of thing to people - please try not to push too far, to fight too hard; if you fall, these people have no God left. You're their last. Look after yourself."

She stands. A younger woman has come forward with an offering. "Thank you - but this is no longer the time for offerings. Maybe soon, when we are safe and the farms are producing again, I will accept your kind offerings. For now, we need everything that we have. Your trust in me is worth more."

As things move on, Gnog asks around if there's a high place he can go. Hazaret overhears and next minute, she's lifted Gnog onto her crown! Not quite what he had in mind; he gets the axe, **closes his eyes and talks to Garren**. "Don't know if you'd like this or if it'd freak you out. But I'm sat here on the head of an *actual God*. But then, I suppose you are part of a god yourself, now, right? So maybe this would be fine. Anyway... Wish you were here. But I guess you know about Ajani too." **A while later, a small yellow canary lands on the axe. Gnog remembers one from before the Tiamat battle**. Gold dragon? Maybe. No canaries meant to be left on Amonkhet. He watches it a while. Says hello. Then he stands, the canary flying off and Hazaret puts him down.

Before she leaves, Hazaret makes a comment to Gnog along the lines of his friends being from a place and then, makes a reference Gnog that indicates a different origin world. It's done in such a casual, matter-of-fact way; "your friends will want to get back to their world, and your home". With a sudden shock, Gnog realises this means something he suspected - his surname - **his lineage may well date back off-world, to the goliaths of Prometiia, after all!**

Hazaret heads back into the desert to avoid drawing more attention here.

Back with his party, Gnog says, "It really was something, you know, the three of you with the sphinxes. Don't know what I'd do without you. And for all the terrible shit we've seen lately, that was something truly beautiful. And now, we start to feel more hope. I wonder - we know we have huge trials ahead - but is this a corner we're now turning? It feels like it might be."

We focus on Oketra's temple. We're told there's a farm we could boat from; 30 minutes to the city, 10 minutes maybe to the place we get out. Banks swarming with eternals, so that's an issue; we'd need a disguise. Taz is confident he could e.g. performance-of-creation-up a hollow dead palm tree log; boat in the middle, us hidden, float with the current. Fly to the farm, hope the ship's safe, make the log, unfold the boat, sail down, get out, fold it up, figure out the temple and teleport back to the farm and ship. Uuuuh - simple?!

Taz tugs at Gnog's trousers in the way he sometimes does and says, "I think it might be time for it." And Gnog goes, "Ah, the bowl?" "Yes, the bowl!" and Gnog goes into the bag of holding to draw out the thing he'd searched for a while ago - an ornate gem encrusted bowl. Deni is surprised - "Wait, we didn't sell that?!" Gnog's, like, "No, we saved it - for the nagas that time, serpent hills; never used it though; and worse, we're about to eat it!".

Manesh knows where there are many more, if wanted them in future! Sure. Middle of the city though. Maybe a holiday to Amonkhet when this is all over. Or we might find some in the temples. In the mean time, Taz goes for **Heroes Feast**. Up to 12 people...

* Us
* Gideon
* The four generals
* Samut
* A couple of guides, one of whom is taking us to the farm

Taz points out that he isn't sure if he can actually benefit. He can taste food and swallow it but only small amounts; he hopes that's enough. It transpires that it is; he benefits too. It seems to be more a matter of taking part in the feast than consuming much of the food.

**17:00 Ravnican, awake 6 hours**. The party joins the guide to be taken to the farm from which we can boat, but then we realise that the guide expects to come with us into the city. That's far too dangerous, and the farm itself we learn isn't a working farm - it's fallen, overtaken by undead, so the guide can't stay there either. In the end, we can't bring the guide along because they can't get back again safely by themselves and don't have time to spend a full day hiking out there with a defensive group; we need to take the Navigator. In the end, Samut says she knows the way and the guide can describe the area they both know well enough for her to get detailed information. And she will take the risk to come in with us.

To our surprise, we're given disguises, even Samut - Manesh is able to help kit us out with scavenged or brought-in-on-refugees vizier adornments which will stand up to at least casual, if not close scrutiny. So we get dressed up. Taz doesn't fit anything, he'll have to try and Minor Illusion his way, or Invisibility, or hide under the a-bit-too-tall Gnog's robes.

Up to the Navigator and away. Taz drops his attunement to the Dulcimer as he and Fee-Ree are worried about how tricky the piloting is. Fee-Ree can choose something else for attunement during the flight. She chooses her old Quarterstaff Of Warning - a good choice in a stealth mission with danger likely to be literally around darkened corners.

Taz navigation out, 10+18, very easy. Gnog, perception 13; he sees building in the distance a wall of sound and cloud heading towards us. He points it out, calls to Samut, "Sandstorm?" "Oh, god, yes, a pretty big one too... I think it's headed our way... How fast can this thing go?" Taz answers, "Should be able to make Naktamun in an hour" "It's going to be close then. We can't go around it." Taz's response is, without asking, to just gun it - he flies at maximum possible speed on his original course, in reverse, towards Naktamun. Eventually the course diverges somewhat at Samut's direction.

During the flight, Gnog reminds everyone that this is going to be one of the most dangerous places we've ever visited, right up there with Tiamat's lair. We're going to have to be at our very best to survive it. Samut warns us about what we're going to see when we land - it'll be outside where the Hekma was, as we walk into the farms; we should be prepared for a significant level of destruction in those unprotected areas.

Deni wants us to be able to communicate silently, so she's going to use her telepathic bond ritual. She'll do it twice - for the boat trip and once we're getting near the temple. She also, surprisingly, casts Water Breathing on all of us too - her ritual abilities are quite exciting.

**Taz d6->4, 40 minutes into the journey the sandstorm catches us.** It slams into the ship, the others taking refuge below deck; after some debate, we figure we can't really walk through this shit anyway, so probably should bring it down into a landing. But navigation 19+10; the lightweight navigator is thrown around but he can bring it into pockets where the storm is less intense, actually flying higher rather than lower where the sand is lighter and less abrasive, but more charged air - lighting flashes around. He shouts over, "I've still got control, so I'll try to bring us down as close as I can to the original landing site" - and he does manage it; we travel with the storm, coming down outside the was-Hekma, alongside the base of a rock outcrop on some low hills, close to the Luxa. We intend to walk over the dune and sneak towards the Hekma boundary, then sneak to the farms and onto the river.

We can't really hide the ship with blankets due to the wind, but we give it a go with heavier rocks to pin things and using the wind direction to try and be an advantage. Sandstorm though - con save Gnog 29; at least we have a telepathic bond and don't need to yell over the wind; he and Samut can cover their mouths and noses completely, Deni has her goggles on. Samut thinks, "This is the kind of weather that Naktamun's never had to face because the Hekma kept these dangers out of the city" and Gnog thinks back, "It's strange, but this couldn't be better - the best cover we could hope for!" "As long as someone can *see* in this" she says. Gnog responds, "Deni and Taz will have it covered - trust in their skill."

**18:00 Ravnican, awake 7 hours**

So, we proceed. We make it over the hill and we're onto the leeward side. The Luxa and Naktamun are beyond. In the distance, just visible through the haze, we can see large dune we first landed on, several miles away.

Deni asks why we don't set down into the Luxa at the closest point, since that seems easier than walking to the farm. Samut points in a direction - "hard to make out, but can you see that silhouette?" - Gnog disav perception 17, a mountain range across the river, it's a wide river, we're still only on the edge of the storm; the mountains seems strangely geometric... "That's *not* a mountain range" 'says' Samut. "That's the Necropolis. Those are the pyramids of the dead, immediately on the other side of the Luxa. If we were to set our boat into the Luxa there, we'd be setting it down immediately in front of the necropolis and the Elemental army". And now we appreciate the scale - difficult to see in the storm, but it looks at least as big of all of Waterdeep; tiered pyramids, a massive front area with what we thought were stone pillars but we realise are statues. Samut is able to visualise the Hour Of Devastation when the locusts and insect gods broke out of the necropolis, and the eternals rose and marched out - "...and *that* is why we shouldn't set down there. We must make it past the Eternal Gates and set down on the other side."

We head towards where the Hekma would've been with Samut guiding. Sand and desert then, suddenly, buildings and what would've been pools, planters and so-on, all destroyed now. A few damaged trees in the farmland. The river is maybe a mile wide here. Once-lush vegetation along the river now dying and faded, but irrigated, carved canals are still there to provide water, so some survives. We walk past a towering gate with beautiful but now crumbling, slightly destroyed pillars, 30ft tall, ziggurat-like buildings really more than pillars and in the middle, open, in the river itself are huge stone alabaster and ceramic mosaic gates, opened over the river, extending into it. Huge! 1/3 mile wide each, maybe.

Samut points out that the Hekma used to provide security around the edges, stopping things getting in not out. Now, we can just walk around it! In the strange twilight of the storm we can see amazing hieroglyphs and runs, iconography of gods, after life - and Bolas inscriptions and horns. "Those were known as the Gates Of The Afterlife. They were shut, it's the headwaters of the Luxa; they'd only be opened for funeray barges of the glorified - warriors perishing in the last of the Trials, the Trial of Zeal, the most glorious where they sacrificed themselves in pure combat. Hazaret's trial. A glorious frenzy of divine battle. They'd then be embalmed decorated and put on funerary barges, sailing upriver through these gates, to await the Hour Of Promise. We didn't know they were just being sailed into the Necropolis and embalmed in Lazotep."

Gnog feels kind of sick to the stomach at the thought of combat and glory being twisted in this way.

We reach the farm. Devastation all around; scarred by sand, most crops failed. The odd animal runs around, wild now. Many fallen trees, many blocking irritation canals - which lead to the river. We can pick one of those and float out like any other dead tree. We figure we might not even need Taz to use a spell; we unfold the boat in its smaller configuration and we last together *real* clumps of real trees and other foliage, so we just look like a large drifting chunk. The boat is only 10ft long, it'll fit four comfortably but Taz is small and uncomfortable is OK for a short journey - he sits with Gnog. Dead palm leaves and so-on are used to build up the side a bit. It takes a while due to the storm, given that we have to secure things as best we can against the wind. We can punt our way out of the canal using a long branch and then drop that once we're in the current, and just use the tiller and one paddle that we have created some space for between the hull and a tree.

The river flows from right to left, the necropolis upstream and across river on the South bank; we enter on the North bank and are swept leftwards, turning so our port side is close to that North bank. We're aiming for Oketra's temple, which is on this same side, so that makes life easier. We know it'll be about 30 minutes to get to the point where we need to get out of the water for waterfall risks so Gnog keeps an eye on the chronometer, though Samut knows where we are anyway.

The storm begins to pass (damn) and we can see more than a few feet in front of us at last. Stealth checks for those on board:

* Gnog 17
* Fee-Ree 22
* Deni 27
* Samut 18
* Taz - actually, he goes Deception as he's piloting - also 17

We manage to pass ourselves off at first as floating vegetation.

Very imposing, grand buildings at the side of the river - but now clearly damaged from the storm (and maybe others before it). Pools and waterfalls damaged. Statues destroyed, plants and gardens ruined.

Movement in the water. Wights and zombies! Just aimlessly shuffling around. Citizens that died during The Hours, suggests Samut; no Hekma, no embalming to protect them. Gnog perception 28 (!) - across the river, stretching out into it, is a beautiful pyramid. Buildings extend out into the water in several locations, and this is one of the really big ones - 80ft high, a huge head, maybe 30ft more height added, of a jackal; beautiful crown; **the monument and temple of Hazaret**. Circling around it, some drakes. Unusual. Undead? Alive? Don't know. Things crawling around on the courtyards and balconies too. Fairly heavily infested with *something*. Samut sees Gnog looking and thinks "...yes, that's where they had the final stand - the showdown - she was the last of the five Gods in the trials, which is why her temple is closest to the Gates of the Afterlife. Now we must be careful - the next one is Bontu (crocodile), and she has always been the treacherous god. Even in the old pantheon. A god of ambition."

A few minutes in, maybe 10, boggy, swamp-like areas extend out - not as built up here, with all those big pyramids extending into the water. Here, Bontu's temple is the *middle* of the river. We have to be careful with navigation here. More movement in the water here - *swarming* with undead. We have to push off against clumps of swampy vegetation sometimes to avoid getting stuck. Samut says that the water is purified somewhat by flowing through this; it flows clean on the other side.

Mystery d20->19. We manage to see ahead movement - reptilian - crocodiles coming in from the shores heading our way. They're about 30-40ft away. We figure that if the crocodiles catch us, we have to fight and that'll draw attention for sure. So we risk trying to propel the boat more quickly, which *might* draw attention but less likely to do so than a fight. We paddle - Gnog and Samut; Gnog athl 28 (scraping the paddle between trunks and boat on his side, we didn't leave a gap there), Samut athl 25; we do carve through well, the crocodiles, 4-5 converging, don't catch up. They stop. Eyes looking at us. "Not worth it", Gnog thinks they're thinking. They swim away and we stop paddling immediately. We don't seem to have been spotted.

Swamp gas perhaps has caught fire in places, unnerving! Behind us, the pyramid and head look downstream, towards us; casting a huge shadow. Stone groins (buttresses) channel the river into canals and small waterfalls in the middle behind the temple. Various braziers are lit, surprisingly, perhaps because the temple itself is always in shadow of this huge crocodile head extending 40-50ft forwards.

Another 10 minutes or so; Deni starts re-casting Telepathic Bond. Gnog / Taz perception 17 / 12. It isn't until we get close that Gnog notices - on "our" side (northern bank) is a huge structure, almost ziggurat rather than pyramid shaped but with a hugely outsized cobra head - Ronas monument. The cobra head seems to have glass on the outside, looking almost like a huge aviary. This is a very large enclosed space - the largest we've seen so far in terms of floor space; as much as 400ft x 400ft. Looks like a jungle inside. Probably full of snakes. Even some of the surrounding grounds still have quite a lot of pools and lush vegetation that seems to have survived somehow. Within the jungle aviary, there seem to be large creatures moving, disturbing the trees.

Not far to the place we stop now. 

Kefnet, the ibis, is next. It sticks out further than most, almost into the middle of the Luxa, but not swamp; as if someone built a dam across the Luxa here, of elegant towers and obelisks, some floating impossibly, some fallen - whatever presumed-magic held them aloft, failed? - in the middle, a beautiful, elegant, slightly slimmer pyramid structure with a more proportioned ibis head, not so oversized. Raised platforms are above, perhaps for observation; small towers again up there. Water is channelled and controlled here into small waterfalls. On the other side the Luxa is much lower. We have to get out here. We have been carried along more quickly than expected, helped in part by having to risk pushing quickly through the marshes earlier.

**18:30 Ravnican, awake 7.5 hours**

We try to get to the bank. Taz asks Gnog for help steering - Athl only 1+11 but Samut helps to give advantage, now gets 7+11->18. We manage to slide into a dock area, crashing in really, so Gnog cuts the ropes for the vegetation which quickly get pulled down over the too-close-for-comfort-now waterfall. The boat is shrunk and put away. We adjust our disguises (!) and look to Samut. "Follow me", she thinks.

We ascend and reach a raised platform near a wall. We have to keep our eyes peeled as we're in the open and easily visible. We walk as if we belong here, not running and not skulking. We go over various stone walkways, about 5ft wide, no railings, over river water beneath in places with waterfalls - we pulled in at the side but there many more channels to cross. It feels quite hazardous; would it have hurt to put in handrails?!

We get to the built-up banks of the Luxa and turn right, beginning to descend alongside the waterfalls. The Luxa falls almost 30-40ft here, with a mist at the bottom. The temple and monument look particularly beautiful from here. That smaller head we saw before, more proportioned, was just a statue - in fact if anything this temple is even more *out* of proportion, a *massive* ibis head arcing over the top of the pyramid and descending down.

This boundary, a two-step fall of waterfall, keeps waters high above it for irrigation but has created all manner of more sheltered spaces in the banks of the lower waters below. It's almost like a hidden city. Aqueducts and channels coming off the top flow down into everything below for pools and even just decorative water features. This still-lush area is apparently where the viziers (essentially the royalty here) used to live. Power and wealth. Not an equal society either. Just like home, just like Ravnica.

Ahead, rising up and above, sloping down into the river with many stairs, a large cat head; that's our target. Oketra's temple. This is the first of the five trial temples. Group deception, with Taz helping Gnog with Guidance, before keeping up castings of Minor Illusion to keep himself looking like an amphora being carried by Gnog.

* Deni 28
* Gnog 14 + 4 -> 18 via Guidance from Taz
* Fee-Ree 18
* Taz 18
* Samut 20

Good enough, apparently, to get onto what looks like a main plaza. Roads and promenades along the edge. Some people walk by, notice us, seem unconcerned.

"This is the heart of it", thinks Samut. "We must cross that plaza". A patrol of Eternals is clearly visible, just standing, watching. "Do not look at them. Don't draw attention to yourself." And if they see us, then Liliana sees us - probably wouldn't remember us, but do we want to risk *that*?

We walk through the plaza. Gnog perception only 13. Avoiding eye contact insofar as just looking forwards, ahead, to where we're going. But if we walk in a straight line, we'll come close to the patrol as they're talking across now. If we deviate, it'll be noticeable. Gnog thinks, "Slow down, let the patrol move past us" - we try to casually saunter a little bit, Samut in front, deception 15; Gnog & Taz next, deception 17 for Gnog. They don't turn to look at us; they just carry on walking, right by in front of us. They're barely 10ft away at our closest point... Harrowing... "Just keep walking..." we get behind them; nothing happens; reach the far side of the plaza; sigh of relief; but then realise Deni is missing!

Gnog thinks, "Deni! Are you OK?" "I'll be there in a moment, I just went around... I didn't want to walk that close to them." We see her drop down from a nearby balcony. This hasn't helped Gnog's blood pressure.

A long road; a promenade; we keep to the sides, hugging buildings. Once-beautiful palm trees and flowering trees line it - all now dead. Some burned, some broken, some sand damaged. Evidence of much battle here, as if titans fought. It leads to the temple entrance.

Samut leads us along to a side entrance; don't want to walk straight into the front door. She finds one behind a side building on a narrow ledge with balcony, balustrades; she points down from this balcony to a level about 20ft below, a wide area behind a bit of a small artificial waterfall between the building and temple.

Gnog puts down amphora Taz, ties off the knotted-mode rope of climbing on the balustrade, drops it down and tries to swing until he's able to drop over the landing area holding the other end. Athl 19+11! Easy. He's landed, holding the other end. Conveniently there are many columns in this large space so he can tie off the other end. He thinks, "It's tied - climb down." We all make it down on athletics checks, but Fee-Ree does take a bit longer as part of her outfit snags for a while. The rope is commanded to untie and stowed.

Nobody around in this space. We can hear the faint sounds of footsteps in multiple directions. Gnog thinks, "Any idea where now?" "Nope! This is as far as my knowledge goes". We know from Manesh that the plans are stored in administrative archives, which is tricky. Oketra's domain includes order & civic works (city planning). Samut thinks the Vizier's quarters are probably beyond a sign that says "Private", but we don't know if that's the right area. Quarters, not offices. There's another area that is where Trials are held - not there either. There's a third way via stairs - process of elimination suggests that.

We try to stay high, along the side where the waterfall is rather than down into lower areas below, a parade guide. Movement along the other side of the waterfall - flying things, perhaps drakes? - but we're inside in comparative dark and we don't think they can see us. We keep walking, as if we're meant to be there. About 30ft from the stairs, a group of 2 in viziers clothing and 2 fully mummified attendants (Samut tells us, "The anointed"). Those who fail in the trials or perish early, if law abiding non-dissenters, are brought to be mummified and anointed so that the Curse Of Wandering doesn't take them. They're imbued with small cartouches (Lazotep) which are assigned to each so they rise as servants, not crazed undead. They run the city - doing all the work. Gnog keeps the moral issues he has with *that* to himself. Samut does voice a thought that this might be something the God Pharoah brought to the world... "Likely, yes" thinks Gnog, *hoping* that's true. Gnog senses some despair that Samut's pushing away; are these undead really going to be led to an afterlife? It all seems like lies.

Gnog thinks back, "Whether the afterlife is true or not, that afterlife we see before us is surely better than the Curse. So either way, they're better off. The rest of it, well, that's for Hazaret to figure out." "Maybe if they didn't have those cartouches? I wonder if there's a way to protect people so they come back not crazed, but not servants either. It'd take a bit of adjusting... The dissident settlement has already proven that we don't need servants. The people of Naktamun are more than capable of doing their own work."

Ah, of course; Karras, just being a farmer. Manesh helping with the kitchens and tending to the old. The builder. These were jobs for the anointed once.

The four move on and out of the way, moving down into the main area below (some kind of assembly ground), heading towards the private area. Close enough to talk to them. Too risky. Don't want to reveal we don't know where things are. We let them pass.

We enter a kind of foyer. There are plants here. Lightwells, stairs in various directions. Signs on two are for street names. One has another name which Samut isn't sure about. We could split up but decide to stick together, going up the 3rd unsure name street. We're trying to investigate; Taz is being carried with little else to do than pretend to be an amphora so he can spend a lot of time looking. Adv investigation: 1,18+13 -> 31! A bit aimless for a while but we get to a corridor with a bit of a long hall. It's quite messy. More corridors, rooms off to the side, stairs up and down to mezzanine levels - ah, *that* kind of maze. Administrative, just for people who know where things are. No living quarters; just lots of what seem to be offices and store rooms. We figure archives are typically lower rather than up on higher floors, perhaps because of all the weight of the stored documents. And we find ourselves in a room, long columned hall. Samut reads, "'Civic works archives' - we're here! This is it!"

**18:45 Ravnican, awake 7.75 hours**

Deni checks for traps and locks. No problem. We go inside. Gnog puts down Taz (an amphora next to the door). Now the penny drops. Rows and rows of shelves, 120ft long room, countless scrolls. Each row has about 4 shelves, each shelf is stacked full of scrolls, journals, books and so-on - but mostly scrolls. Blueprints, edicts, laws and so-on. A series of hieroglyphs are written on shelf ends. We figure "Necromicon" perhaps but Samut thinks that this wasn't something people were meant to know about, so if the plans were in the public eye they'd need a different name. "Afterlife" perhaps, after the Gates? We decide to each take a row, find out what's there and map it to the hieroglyphs. Investigation all round:

* Taz 18
* Gnog 8 (with luck point) - scrolls with lists of names, no idea what they are!
* Deni 24 (via Reliable Talent)
* Fee-Ree, Samut - etc. etc.

...but between all of us, Samut thinks after a few minutes that the symbols on the shelves relate to the subject matter. So we figure we'll try Blueprints, which is surprising as we'd expect relatively few such categories but there are many different hieroglyphs. Samut takes us where she thinks; se points down a shelving unit row; maybe, four shelves here. Hmm.

Taz investigation 19 + 3 BFS, trying to see if shelves have any further classifications. Chooses things at random; Comprehend Languages; they seem related to epochs and domains; we figure the pyramids of interest are middle aged, not young but not the oldest buildings, so we're down to two sets of shelves, with the extreme ends of age omitted. The "domain" is akin to a district. OK, so if these pyramids are outside, it's kind of unclassified, so this time we're after the extreme ends of the shelves - we'd expect that to be listed first or last. Gnog perception 23 is noticing patterns in the hieroglyphs, but one shelf stands out that's quite different. About 20 scrolls here. We decide to have a quick look to see if any of them seem to show the necromicon plans. So we just pull, look, pull, look... Five at a time. Mystery D20 roll all round.

* Samut 1
* Deni 4
* Taz 9
* Fee-Ree 14
* Gnog 17

Nope. Again: Nothing. Third set: Nothing. Fourth: ...well, no Nat 20s. But DM fiat, D10 is rolled to determine that Taz finds it. It's a huge scroll as he draws it out, three sheets layered. **Bag it!**

Gnog thinks to Fee-Ree: "Teleport?" - she prepares it, casts it and nothing happens. Gnog thinks, "Well, that's just about our luck... Something suppressing?" Fee-Ree realises that the spell didn't work because something here that suppresses magic. So we need to perhaps get out of the temple, or even the city; Samut has no idea what's happening. She's very surprised. Gnog suggests that it's an anti-theft thing; we should try and see if there are wards on the door that might stop us removing scrolls? Taz Arcana 29, he sees that the door **does** have glyphs, etched into it with an arcane aura. But he doesn't know them. It looks like something that wards an area against infiltration. It's perhaps more to stop people teleporting *in* than out, but also you can't cast a fireball or similar. Nothing specifically about not removing scrolls. We risk it and try to exit the room, especially with the scroll in a pocket dimension, but then **we hear a high-pitched tone that sounds like some kind of alarm**.

Around us, we see statues start to move. Statues start to cast something, some kind of stasis magic? Hold Person like. Wisdom saving, adv all from Heroes Feast:

* Fee-Ree 28
* Deni 28
* Gnog 22
* Samut is OK
* Taz only 9! He freezes and Gnog has to pick him up.

We try to run for it. These statues look more like ivory golems now they move. Rays aiming at us out of sapphire eyes. Fee-Ree turns and throws some firebolts, but the sapphire ray is anti-magic. We keep running, trying to dodge the relatively slow golems. They don't move far from where they are. Maybe if we run out of range it'll be OK? But as we move along the corridor, from the other end, running around, are people alerted by the alarm:

* One person dressed like a vizier
* Next to them an armoured humanoid with an almost minotaur-like head, different horn shape; similar to the war priest we encountered when we first came into town
* Two Anointed holding weapons

To get out of the anti-magic range we have to go through them. No spells for this battle. Gnog shouts, "Keep back if you rely on magic!", tosses Taz to Fee-Ree (!) and rages just ahead of entering initiative.

Initiative:

* Gnog 23
* Deni 17
* Fee-Ree 17
* Taz 17
* Samut 3

Gnog runs up. Mummies in the way of the big guys. No choice; swings at the first, hits for 27; it falls, crumbling to dust; he attacks the other; 27 again (originally rolled a 1 on the d12, but reroll was a 10). He moves to stare down the vizier and war priest. The vizier stares at Gnog, pulls its khopesh, holds its staff forward and casts something - Gnog feels himself being *pushed* into another plane... CHA saving. Adv from axe - 22; fortunately the spell fails. The khopesh flames out and flame juts at Gnog; 20 -> saves; 16->8->4 damage. There's also 11->5->2 necrotic, which catches Gnog by surprise.

Deni moves forward around some rubble, tucks in and tries to gain insight on the war priest and manages it (but this one is a close call, the priest rolling a 20, but only +1 to Deni's overall 9->10+14 -> 24). She fires the bow and hits for a middling-for-Deni-but-decent 48. Fee-Ree runs as far as she can to get away from the anti-magic field; but she ends up still on the edge of it. She puts Taz down in front of her - "Taz, move!". That's all she can do without magic.

Taz tries to shake off the hold spell. 23, he breaks it; Bardic inspiration to Gnog as he calls, "That sucked - I'm back now!"

The war priest summons a creature. A large guardian filling the corridor appears behind in Gnog, indistinct but visible. The guardian swings at Gnog with a maul; hits; 14->7 bludgeoning damage and 12->6 radiant; 13 total. Probably worth using the wings next time. Stone's endurance -> 6+5, so only takes 2 overall.

Samut runs up to the golems to try and stop them from advancing further.

Gnog attacks the war priest recklessly. First attack 1,2 rolled so miss, try bardic, another 1 rolled, fucking hell, total miss. The war priest and vizier do both take a whopping 1 thunder damage. It's almost insulting. But apparently the vizier is pissed by this and says something in a foreign language; con save fine; 4d10 -> 22->11->5 damage. Gnog tries again. No radiant damage for these guys but a solid 20 from the axe. The summoned creature stays present.

The vizier throws a khopesh flame at Gnog; Gnog dodges; 16->8->4, 11->5->2 damage. Then it says a strange word; a Word Of Power. Gripping pain; but that's all; it seems to have no more effect. Gnog isn't sure what's going on. Never seen *whatever* that was tried before.

Deni aims at the War Priest and tries to fire through the incorporeal guardian to hit him. She succeeds. 48 damage, taking down the War Priest; but its summoned guardian stays up. Fee-Ree steps into the guardian's threatened area to escape the anti-magic field, but the guardian hits her for 20 radiant damage. She doesn't miss a beat from that, and throws a firebolt at the vizier, twinning it for another at the guardian. Both hit, but the guardian takes *no* damage, apparently entirely immune. 4d10->24 to the vizier. She speeds up the spell to cast again against the vizier, crit! 8d10->45. It's messed up, but not down.

Taz tries Eldritch Blasts against the guardian. Some hit, one doing maximum damage - it does nothing either. Taz shouts, "No magic works on it *at all* - Gnog, Deni, you've got to take it down!"

Samut attacks the lead golem. She's aiming for the sapphire eyes to dislodge them, and succeeds!

Gnog moves to attack the vizier and is affected by the guardian's aura, dex save DC 15 -> only 14, so takes 20->10 radiant. Attacks recklessly. Hits for 19; the vizier falls; he turns and moves (no ill effects!) to swing at the guardian; he thinks he has a hit, but his axe passes through it; Gnog shouts, "Even *weapons* don't work; how the hell do we take it down, dispel magic or banish or something?!"

Deni thinks, "fuck it", and has a go anyway. Nothing. Gnog shouts, "Told you!"

Fee-Ree tries Dispel Magic. She casts at L3, but needs an ability check; looks rough, blows a Tides of Chaos; dispels the magic; no wild magic surge; it vanishes! Samut comes running up, "Yeah, let's go!" and as we're running Gnog shouting, "Good work Fee-Ree". She's not sure if we're clear of spells. She has no way of knowing if the suppression effect would cover the whole temple, and we can't risk blowing L8 on a failed Teleport, so we have to risk running full tilt to the waterfall exit and hoping that having sky above is enough.

"Are we going to the ship?" she shouts as we run, and Gnog suddenly halts - everyone kind of runs into his back! - Deni, "What the fuck?!" and Gnog says - "We've got the plans - if we were to try and get there on foot - how would we do it?" to Samut, continuing, "I mean, from here? Is it possible or too risky?" Samut answers "We'd have to cross the river" Gnog, "Options for that - any bridges?" As we talk, we start to run again, retracing our prior steps. Samut replies, "There's something that spans the river quite close to here... Kefnet's temple. It is possible. Or go to ground; find somewhere to hide and see if we have what we need." Gnog says, "OK then, let's find a safehouse or something, or just a hiding hole. Look at the plans, see if we can figure it out and if it's worth doing while we're out here." "OK. If we're going to try to do anything, maybe we should do it soon, before they realise what's missing..." Gnog says, "ugh, even worse. Yes. Run faster!"

We successfully reach the waterfall area. We look to drop *down*, since Gnog had noticed drakes earlier. A balcony below could lead us into an interior and from there to ledges. It's a 20ft drop. Gnog ties off the rope of climbing onto a column and ushers people down; then once they'd down he unties it and jumps for speed - athl 29. Nice. Three point landing. He sees out of the corner of his eye as he jumps more temple staff. Pointing and shouting. Not very stealthy; we dive inside and keep going fast. Samut suggests back alleyways; if anyone is "on our side" they'll tend to skulk around there. We end up close to the water and end up on low docks with a boardwalk along the side for people who live down there. There are a few wandering undead - "The Accursed" - we have to dispatch them, conserving resources as best we can, the axe doing good work; eventually we're back at the bottom of the waterfalls. "Find a way to get up them!" 'thinks' Samut.

Gnog perception 24; he sees behind a waterfall closest to us an apparent ladder going at least half way, some 30ft to a ledge. One step at a time - he points and runs to it; we climb up. A bit wet. Samut stops for a moment to appreciate the water! Slippery steps lead behind the waterfall into the structure itself. Interesting; let's try that he says, but careful, slippery! Slow place. Fee-Ree asks Taz if we can use Prestidigitation to dry us off so we don't leave wet footprints, so we do that. We sneak inside.

We're inside the arched bridges; this seems to be maintenance access stuff. We open a door; a bit of old equipment, perhaps a store room? Samut points out that this means the living would never come here - Anointed mummies only. If we stay out of their way they should ignore us.

So, we find a corner and unfurl plans. Deni starts to recast Telepathic Bond again as we do so.

Gnog frowns and sighs. "Garren would've been good at this..." - Gnog can't make head or tail of it (perception 1+9). Taz makes a hand motion that Gnog chuckles at - it's as if he adjusted his investigator's hat! - and gets investigation total 26; he asks Samut about certain symbols or drawings and she's able to help out; repeat investigation total 30. Matches DC! He manages to decipher them enough to call everyone around and explain them. He thinks he knows where the core structural members are, and if he's right, thinks we only really need to collapse the entrance pyramid - the entirety of necropolis is connected underground, but the *only* overground entrance is that main front large pyramid opening onto an old temple at the side. That's a bonus; the old temple isn't the main grand entrance, less defended we hope, and it's "just" the one pyramid. We have to somehow get through the big temple in front, get to the back of it and climb up and over into a hollow area in the middle of the pyramid. Then we'd need to put the destruction glyph on all four sides of the interior. That'd blow out those walls and the pyramid *should* collapse in on itself.

OK, so what does our route look like there. Samut doesn't know that temple but says the design looks familiar, interesting; like an old... "Look at this, don't you think this looks familiar? It's not a Naktamun design - a much, much older structure, already there?" - we see some similarity with Ifnir, but also with things we saw at the Sacred Mount. It's kinda "old Amonkhet", back when there were nights and days. Samut doesn't know the city on the other side of the river well, but figures she can at least navigate within a presumably similar kind of style of street and building design; but after that, beyond the Hekma, "All bets are off".

It's stupidly risky, but the thought of the missing plans being discovered and our plan inferred is too risky as well, so we have to cross the river and figure it out. We can cross up the top, or we can try to keep low. We figure low to start with - ... - and **in walk four Anointed**. They stand awkwardly as Fee-Ree is in the way; she moves to one side; they get some tools and a stone block in a cart; and start to move along out of the room.

We figure we might follow them, a distance behind, watching them. The walk along a walkway, push open a stone door and follow along in narrow servant's passageways, that seem to be how they're moving around without "being seen" and getting in the way. A little claustrophobic. We pop out on the other side of one of the two huge stone groins/buttresses. Eventually they stop to fix something and we continue, behind the waterfalls, looking for those doors that are set into the infrastructure.

Gnog tries, but can't see them (nat 1), so he asks Deni for help! She asks him to push on a bit of wall; clunk, wall moves back, door slides aside. Another corridor. We agree that if we meet Anointed coming towards us we'll have no choice but to back out until they're through, then retry. In practice, that doesn't happen and we get to the middle. We figure it might be safer to move up now and pretend we're priests again, rather than skulking around as living-who-should-not-be-there in the infrastructure. We're a distance away from Oketra's temple now. There are wide stairs heading up.

Samut and Taz (Comprehend Languages still up) notice that all the temple walls here, *all* of them, and these are truly giant walls, are covered in hieroglyphs. Seems to trace a chronicle, a story detailing every day of life in Naktamun. "Kefnet's Chronicle" says Samut - "every day when the second reaches the horizon, Kefnet records all significant happenings of that day onto the side of this temple. I've never been this close to it before, or been close enough to read it... This would have been such a beautiful thing. I wonder if Kefnet had always done this, or if it was a quirk that developed after the God Pharoah erased their memories?" Gnog says, "Some subconscious suspicion perhaps, which Kefnet thought etching in stone might defeat - possible, but apparently, wasn't enough to detect anything nefarious and rise against Bolas." "So I wonder if any of them had suspicions but didn't tell each other, and if they had that things would be different?" but then she seems to focus back again.

We proceed on our route across the river, this time on top. This takes us through the temple, a maze-like array of mirrors and crystals, stairs and water; a group of viziers are nearby; Taz insight 16, Gnog perception 19. They're dressed similarly to us, but one of them is an Avan. Their reaction is one of, "Oh, fuck, we've run into people" - they look momentarily look nervous. One almost nods to us, then the other says something. They move away from us a bit. Taz thinks they're nervous and possibly conspiring. Taz thinks, we're chaos, right? And says to them, **"Wait for Manesh. He will return, enlightened"**. One turns to us. "Manesh was killed. There is no hope" and gets hit by another. Gnog speaks up. "Do not fear us. We understand." and Samut lifts her cowl - one looks and sees her - "...no... Samut?! But you lead the diss - why are you in here? They will catch you! You can't be in here!" Gnog says, "We need safe passage to the far bank. Is there a better way?" "Yes! You must come with us now!" and they lead us off and down into a different area, less out in the open. Some scout ahead sometimes, checking to see if anyone else is there, then call us along.

There is talk perhaps of other enclaves, places where people made it out safely. Out there, somewhere. Samut asks, but they don't know how to contact them. But they'll make it happen. She says, "We will live. Naktamun will live. There *is* hope. Hazaret lives. Her eyes are open", but while happy about that, the give us grim portents about what was done to the other gods - if we're going to the necropolis, we'll see, we're told.

We reach a side door. A high causeway, we can walk straight across. "You're nearly there. Straight through. Don't look back. Don't talk to anyone."

Gnog thanks them - hold on - keep cautious - a distraction will come soon. Samut adds, "I promise we'll come back for you. We're leaving nobody behind." Deni accidentally thinks out loud - forgetting about the telapathy - "Why did you make that promise?!" "I can hear that!" "Well... You just promised something you can't be sure you're going to deliver. It's one of my pet peeves!" And Gnog adds, "And of course, we're certainly going to help you try and keep it."

We make it across the river.
