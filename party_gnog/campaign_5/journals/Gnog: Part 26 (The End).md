# Gnog: Part 26 (The End)
## 7am, day 61 (Ravnica 41, Riglan 98 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Wednesday (7 day week)

The day after. Victory, at cost; we awake in P6, amongst goblin friends. Arxcis joined us during the night. We are tired, all the same; remembrances continued into the early hours. Foundry Street, it seems, never sleeps and already seems to be returning to its normal hum and rhythm.

Gnog seeks Krenko. He tries to persuade people around to give him a brief audience. Persuasion, 23. Yes. We are all brought to some kind of office building. Krenko is sat in a bath, in a barrel! He tells us to wait outside. He eventually returns in a bath robe, and hat. "Come in!" he calls, from the door.

"Will she be looked after? The mother has nothing; her husband and children are gone now. She is probably not the only one either..."

Gnog is interrupted. "Nonsense! She is a goblin. She is one of us. We will always be here for her. She will always be looked after! She is a mother of heroes - one of the highest honours. She will want for nothing. It is simply our way. I am glad it brings you comfort; but it is just our way. Outsiders tend to care little for our ways."

"Thank you Krenko. Is there anything we can do for you?"

"No. you have done much! We ask little of others, for we have very few needs. A goblin is happy with friends and family and a full belly, and a heart full of laughter and meaningful work."

"You are not so different from us."

"It is easy to get lost - lost being told and shown all that you need and require, when in fact you require very little but each other, honesty and respect."

"Very true. Thank you for your words. I think we should leave you in peace."

"You are always welcome here. We have many hard days ahead of us - the city will be relying on this street! These boys and girls here, to bring things back up. You are friends with the Boros, are you not?"

"Yes"

"Well, there is one friendly thing you could ask them."

"Anything!"

"You could ask them to turn a blind eye and focus on things happening elsewhere. We welcome them here, but we could do with less of their... Interjections! Less of their overly zealous surveillance of our every action."

"I think that with Bolas gone, some 7 decades or more of imbalance will be corrected. But I will ask, in the strongest terms I can."

"It does't have to be strong - merely a reassurance to them that we - it is not that they're unwelcome here. We welcome them. We welcome a police force, of course! It is just that they seem fixated on our goings on! They are suspicious of us, as if they expect the worst."

We head away, and Gnog wonders if he can spot the mother for one last thing in the crowds. Perception 27. Easy! Much further up the street now, standing in front of the large warehouse with all the banners hanging off it. We head over.

"There's one last thing" says Gnog.

She doesn't notice us arriving; she's just looking at the banners, holding a basket. It's empty. Gnog clears his throat and asks about the basket? "Oh, for flowers." - she's laid some out.

Gnog talks bout the spirits rising, of the last few goblins born on angel's wings, literally.

She agrees that they'll be there, waiting in the afterlife; and says: "You know, I don't think I've ever felt braver. I don't fear death! When it comes, I shall welcome it with open arms and a smile. But that is for another day!"

We move on. Head towards the library but then stop, because Fee-Ree reminds Gnog that Niv will probably call a guild summit if we want to speak to *them* and we should invite ourselves! Gnog checks in with his party; they feel the loss too. Fee-Ree's OK; we didn't lose anyone in our little circle, at least. That is something for which to be thankful. Deni is withdrawn; she's really over the city now and wants some quiet! A holiday - elsewhere.

Gnog uses the four-way sending stone. "What say you all; one last meeting. Gatewatch and planeswalkers, safehouse kitchen, as soon as you're all awake?"

* Ajani immediately: "Yes! Let the party continue! I will see you there soon. I am with the city watch at Sunhome. Be there in 20."
* About five minutes later, Kaya: "Sure."

We reach the safehouse quickly; it's not far, we were already headed towards P5 out of P6 thinking about going to the library. Quite a few people are gathered, in the main room this time. Not the kitchen! The kitchen is a mess... Celebrations evident inside the safehouse too. Maybe we have to help with cleaning!

A gnome runs up. Artificer. "We were wondering where you were. We figured there were people you needed to be around..." "Goblins" "...ah yes!" "Look! Look!" he says and casts a spell. "It's back! We got our sparks back." Gnog is taken aback; overjoyed; tears in his eyes, takes a minute then picks up the gnome for a giant hug.

Like the souls. The sparks were not consumed, they were being gathered. It took a while, he says; but it came back in the evening.

Nissa arrives. Gnog runs up and hugs her. We learn that Vitu Ghazi stands; a third was withered away, but she's back and alive and will recover. Nissa thinks it was only a minute or two before a complete loss but Bontu just turned and ran. We explain it was Liliana. "Where's Gideon?" she asks. Ah.

Jace comes down. "Nissa. I was wondering when I would see you... We are the last of the original Gatewatch, you and I. Everyone else is gone."

Nissa takes a moment.

We tell our side of the story, being so close to the two as we were at the time. Jace produces the Chain Veil; it's a problem. It cannot be destroyed. It is incredibly powerful, and probably evil, though Liliana always disagreed with Jace on that. We don't know what to do with it!

Ajani stumbles into the room. "Hmm, lame party isn't it? Where's all the drink?" - goodness. Still partying. We talk about what do with the veil. "Ah! Sounds like a mission! What are you all doing now? This sounds like a mission for the Gatewatch."

Fee-Ree nervously explains that it's been an honour, but her and Arxcis want to spend time together. Not really compatible with world-saving habits of the Gatewatch!

Nissa explains that it's not so bad, actually. It was more a sentinel, originally. Being vigilant against corruption - like Bolas. Long periods of peace. "Hopefully, the sun rises on such a period now." She asks if we might consider at least being "on call".

Out of nowhere, Taz speaks up.

"I had been worrying. I worried of my future. Could I bear to lose you all? Should I just leave, and distance myself? I hear that many elves choose such a path. Dragons even more so. It would be easier, yes?"

"But then I stood there, in that awful battle, with Gideon and Liliana dead at my feet. I could not save them. But in the end, all that they had done which lead them to that moment, was born of their love for each other. And they knew that. There, at the end, they knew. We helped give them that. We did not bring Gideon from Amonkhet to face his death. We brought him back to see his true love."

"*Goliath, Dragonborns, Human* - however short your lives may be, those lives have given and will each give birth again to love. You have explained this before and I now finally understand; such love will endure. In time, there must always be passing and there will always be pain. It may fade, but still lives within us forever - and if that pain is there, so too must be the love from which it is derived. It cannot exist otherwise. And so, the love must always have lasted longer. The pain must always be lesser."

"I think that Gibo and Bebe's mother would not choose the emptiness of never knowing her children over the pain of their passing. I mean no disrespect, or to cause you all more pain; quite the opposite. *Boboremos was wrong*. I hope he learns that and gets to experience bonds such as those we ourselves have, for it would otherwise seem such an empty way to spend such brief moments as you all have on these mortal planes."

"The differences in the lengths of times we might live only serve to make the time spent all the more important. Some day I *shall* travel amongst the stars and the gods. I shall explore all I can explore, to help where I am needed and able, but to learn *everywhere*. For this, if I am lucky, I might have centuries; maybe even millennia. There is *no rush*, my friends. Steady yourselves. There will be no grand departure. You need not bid farewell to another companion. We may all be apart from time to time, as life takes us on our various separate journies, but you and I shall always come back together. I shall stay with you all until your ends and, however many years it might be later, I shall one day hope to ascend and meet you in the After, wherever and whatever that might be. For our friendship is love. And love is eternal."

Nissa is smiling, and leaning in, but suddenly leaps back. **A bright light emanates from Taz suddenly, whirls around him, a faintest memory of a construct he sent away, leaving the barest imprint of a memory**... "Oh!" Nissa says. "Oh wow! I've never witnessed that before!" Jace: "Oh, that's wonderful! Taz! Your spark just ignited!" (The universe made him forget his first planeshift spell; it seems as if those rules were bent, just a tiny bit).

The gnome artificer has seen it. "So it is true! It is possible! It is possible for a construct to be a planeswalker! That is marvellous!" - and people crowd around Taz. All are respectful, but impressed and eager to learn more about Taz. We back away, giving him his space, but letting him know we're nearby.

Taz asks one of them, "I understand the concept of walking between planes now. But I think I need something, an anchor. What do I need?" "There are many ways. But there are also some ways that require no anchor at all. In time you'll discover them."

Gnog leans into Fee-Ree and whispers, "If Rerdian and Zorbu could see him now!" Fee-Ree is amazed; she's never seen anyone or anything acquire skill and power so swiftly.

There is more talk. Gnog asks for forgiveness for convincing Vi to activate the Beacon without being able to warn the Planeswalkers, and without realising that it was a trap of Bolas. Teferi speaks, to reassure Gnog. There will be much to analyse... But in the end... "The river of time flows the way it must. We cannot understand all the pebbles and rocks that the river flows over; but at any one time, it might seem like catastrophe, yet everything happens as it must and as it should. If only we could look far enough along the river, it would make sense. That is what I find."

More talk. The Immortal Sun is brought up. Vi wants to keep a hold of it.

We learn of ships in the sky; Ravnica Station, of course. The word must've got out that it was safe to land. The ships descend with aid. The gig is up, then; Spelljamming will be known to Ravnicans far and wide.

We talk about the Infinite Consortium and Xaryxians. The designs they might have on Torril; their destruction of worlds. We will stay with Gatewatch, yes, but only if we can *all* come; our strength is on our party. We need to figure out what's going on with the Xarxyians and solve that somehow... **Mu Yanling gives us a strange beautiful polyhedral crystal - a Lore Crystal.** (And Taz returns his Thought Crystal that she'd given him). We will find it useful if we ever are to pursue that thread of enquiry! "If you ever need more information, you can find me at the Archives." "Thank you."

Since Mu wants to get back to the archives to start writing this incredible Story, Gnog asks for the assembled crowd to indulge him with one more.

"Of course there is mourning, too. On this, I want you to learn that once upon a time, not too long ago, I knew two young goblins. Children, really. We helped them find a way into Nivix, eventually experimenting in a lab, working under Ral Zarek himself. Their father had been killed in this same place seven years ago when the IPB overloaded, but now they felt they were making him proud, getting the recognition themselves that their father had always deserved but never received. They wrote letters to their mum, and she would cry with joy and pride when she read them. She made us tea. I asked them for help; pushed them hard; we knew their skills and they were instrumental in bringing up the barrier that protected the Planeswalkers as well as the devices that shattered the Lazotep armour of the *Gods*. They said they wouldn't let me down. *They did not.* The last thing they did, before ensuring our victory against Oketra, was to ask me to remember them. I always will."

"I tell you this so you remember them too. It's one small story, very dear to me, very difficult to bear, but exists amongst what must be countless thousands of other such stories. Hundreds of thousands dead, incomprehensible; Ravnicans, mostly, but many losses among our own, too. And so there is a network of remembrance, definining a generation and defining a world. When you leave this place, please, spread the word of the valour and resilience of the Ravnican people. Should you find yourselves with ears for your stories, let others know what they did here. We helped, but without the sacrifice of thousands, there would have been no victory. At least we are confident that the souls, once thought trapped and consumed by Bolas, were ultimately released. If there is an After, then they are all, now, shining stars above us."

People exchange 'addresses'. Trinkets, to tune to and planeswalk. They collect things and label them to understand what goes where!

**Gnog finds Ajani and gets to a quiet corner. Is there a future? We are willing to try. Ajani: "We can make a promise that we'll give it a try. That when we have the time that we'll spend some time together, somewhere where we're not trying to save the world!" But how shall we contact each other? We'd have to leave messages for each other somewhere we can both find. We agree that Luigi at The Happy Beholder will be our messenger on the Rock Of Braal. Or come and see him on either his adopted home of Theros, or he might return to his birth world and see how it's doing. He was born on the Shard Of Nya, part of what is now the reunited world of Alara. That's where his people was born. The jungles there. The open plains of Theros, ah! He thinks Gnog would like them.**

Before he leaves, Ajani gives Gnog a small figurine of *himself* - the last world they were on, they were on for a while. He thinks he must've made an impression. They had a whole production of these figurines made! He liked them and took a few with him. Ajani in return takes one of Gnog's many necklaces.

He departs.

Gnog returns to the group. Kaya's want for vengeance has been scuppered; in a sense, it has been enacted by the killing of Tesseret and Bolas, who were together responsible for the death of her family. She says she's leaving the Gatewatch. "It was never really for me. I was happy to play a role here, but it has only raised more questions than answers. So I shall go seeking. I shall hunt the Infinite Consortium to its source." We say that if she's ever near Toril, she will always have a place to stay at the Goliath Drinks. Free food and drink! She has no idea where her path will take her but the universe seems to have a habit of interweaving threads. We're certainly interested in the Infinite Consortium ourselves and we all have the sending stones, so, if she's on that plane, she can get in touch. She doesn't need Mu's Lore Crystal - she has more "direct" sources...!

More are leaving. The room gets quiet and Vi catches our eye. We end up taken to a side room. She has the Immortal Sun. "Well, I know some people; and I might give it to them to safeguard and hide away until we can figure out what to do with it or how to deactivate it for good - or dismantle it - or *something*! Someone has to find Azor and find out what to do with it. It needs to be somewhere very, very safe. I happen to have a high level contact in the Golden Vault." "The Golden Vault?" "There are many world-spanning organisations - like the Fixers, the Infinite Consortium, the Vault - people who have designs or watch them, or work against those would try and seize power that ends worlds. Groups of heroes too like the Gatewatch, but also quiet organisations."

Gnog has been digging around in the bag of holding for gifts and stuff but finds the Mizzium Bomb made by Gibo and Bebe... Ah. Now, that's something perhaps for their mother. He asks Vi if she can make it safe; it takes her a matter of seconds to tinker with it and extract the mizzium. We also ask if *we* will ever need to hear the Fixer beacon, but she simply says that - if we do, we'll hear it; we'll just know.

We thank Vi - for everything. "Just my job. But it was very, very nice to get that letter. She didn't need to write it as a letter! But if you see her, tell her, point taken - I'll visit."

She wants to shrink down the safehouse. Takes a lot of energy. We give her back her key, and head out. It's strange to step outside the safehouse and realise we can't get back in.

Gnog says, "Well, almost there. Niv, I guess, to invite ourselves to a guild meeting. Deni, we'll have you somewhere quiet soon. Just hang in there!"

We've said goodbye to Gibo & Bebe's mum but awkwardly if she wants it, we have the safe bomb so we just pass by to ask if she wants it, now safe. She says she'll keep anything of theirs - she can keep it in the room. We leave it with her, thank her - but she asks if we want to have tea. "I'm afraid I won't be the best company..." "We'd love to, if that's OK?" "Yes, I think some tea and some company." "Well then! Let's head over to the house."

At the house, damage and shaking from the war has made various things fall over, so we help with cleaning up. She says one day she'll pack things up - too many memories here - "time to make new memories of my own".

We finish up the tea, hugs all round; she knows she can always reach us via Niv. She sees us to the door. "I remember the first day you came here. You made my boys very happy. And you helped them to be more than they thought they could be, and that has made me very proud. Journey safe. And I hope you, too, will find pride and love the way I have. I consider myself very lucky." And off we go.

Nivix.

Much rebuilding is underway; that's what happens when you have a lot of powerful mages, I guess! A new campus seems to be being constructed using walls of stone extended from a collapsed area. There is already a sign. "The Gibo And Bebe School Of Residence." The first act of the new Guildmaster, Mareka Destin. She's there in person, giving instructions. We head over. Gnog points and says "Thank you for that. They were important to us." "Yes, they were important to our world! Thankfully we have quite a few of those who worked in the war lab in P5 who can now head up this school - Izzit engineers who, I have to say, were probably overlooked by the other schools as their studies didn't neatly fit into the curricula of other departments. But resonance and sound; it's time we had a school dedicated to it. And really, Gibo and Bebe founded this line of study - at least within the Izzet." They're waiting for the right time to tell the mother; heard she might be moving, and if so might buy the old house to turn it into a kind of museum. Time to start remembering contributions of *all* the Izzet.

We ask after Niv. Kicked off campus! Not part of the Izzit now. Awww. His tower isn't even rebuilt; his stuff has been moved to P1, where a new Hall will be built. It won't be over the old hall. There'll be a meeting; she's surprised we haven't heard about it - it'll be held at Orzhova. Only area big enough. We should head there.

"Wait! Before you go. I think he would've wanted you to have this..." - she pulls out a small locket. It has a smiling spinning hologram when you open it, of Ral casting a spell. "Does he not want this?" "He has others. I have one that he gave me as well. But I recovered this from this office." "Yeah... OK, thank you." "We were there together, all of us, at the end. I'll have a hologram of him put next to him in the Hall. He was never named Guildmaster, so has no place in the Hall of Guildmasters in theory, but I think he deserves to be remembered. Anyone arriving by air will be greeted by his hologram. I thought that might be a nice touch, since he made that my job for so long! You'd better get going."

We rush off.

The area is a mess. Much activity, once again; no time wasted, rebuilding everywhere. It's interesting to see the full might of Ravnica's construction magic in play. Many Izzet helping here too, Selesnyans too. We work through the groups towards Orzhova. It seems to be largely unscathed. Very tight security! We are, fortunately, recognised by someone. "They're known to Taysa. I recognise them. Allow them through." We are escorted to the meeting - downstairs, to a large Orzhov chamber. Ah, slightly embarrassing - this is where we killed the Ozbidat!

Taysa waves and beckons us over. We head to her. She's allocated us seats! We thank her and consider ourselves honoured non-Ravnican guests. We take our seats and Gnog closes his eyes; starts to think about New Garren. "Not sure when would be a good time or if you're nearby but if you wanted to bolster a following, Ravnica right now is a good place for it - we told them all about you..."

Within about 20 minutes, others have arrived, full room, it starts. Taysa stands and welcomes everyone to the makeshift first new era summit of the Guildpact. A new living Guildpact. "There will be much rebuilding but I'll hand over now to Niv, who is the new Living Guildpact." (Murmurings, some not fully happy!)

Niv takes (and fills) the floor, thanking everyone and assuring them that he's removed entirely from the Izzit - he's basically kicked out! - no more allegiance or loyalty to them as any other guild, he swears.

His first order of business is to thank people who have given so much. He pulls an illusory scroll and starts reading a litany of the fallen, with contributions. "As each Guildmaster provides me with names of their fallen, they will be added to this scroll and the scrolls themselves will be etched onto the walls of the new Chamber Of The Guildpact so that people can honour those who protected this world, and all we stand for. Which brings me to - what we stand for. What we seek to protect. What all these sacrifices, all the unfulfilled potential, what that *cost* has bought for us. What future has this price paid for? I cannot answer that. No-one in this room can answer that. I believe we must return to our original purpose - in *service* of the people of Ravnica, so it is to *them* to decide, for *them* to determine, the path that we walk and it is our duty to guide, to enable, to protect, to discover, to remember, to build. We are here for them and not the other way around."

He proposes that the laylines are anchored over the old Hall where a will memorial be built, and from Augustin Station (or any station) there will be free air travel to a *new* platform. The *platform* of the Guild Pact. We shall move the Hall up into the air. Makes it more accessible for everyone - you don't need to walk to P1, D10. You can take airships for free.

Concerns are raised, as things become more political. The Boros Parehelion. The Simic Guardian Project. The Gruul - under an injured, but present and wiser-looking Boboremos - threaten to walk out, again! "What of our sacrifices? We claim tracts of the Red Wastes" - but this time, the Boros hold their objections. Less to patrol! Surely, of any guild, it makes the most sense for them to hold it. There is a vote. Objections: Azorious, Orzhov object; Izzit abstain; Dimir are not present, surprisingly. Others agree, so it is passed easily.

Selesnyans talk about food resources. They've taken stock. It'll require mass transfer of food stocks around to balance reserves but it can be done quite quickly. Many farms and food stores in D10-D12 are heavily depleted, but not an immediate humanitarian crisis.

Some raise a concern about the off-worlders to ostensibly offer aid. A vote is taken, and the decision is 5:4 to allow them to stay and help.

* The floor is opened. We get to thank Ravnica for their welcome when we arrived, hope that their less helpful differences - e.g. the invisibility of the Kraul - are seen past for a stronger future, and assure them that they need fear nothing from off-worlders in terms of security. *Nobody* is going to fuck with Ravnica now.

* The new Azorious Guildmaster, sphinx **Quinlin** is there - with the 3 precogs we know. We are introduced. We return the vault keys and "borrowed" artefacts. We get in return, on request, a platinum rod - Taz can use this as a Planeshift focus.

* To Aurelia and Feather, we can return the investigator pins, but do ask if we might keep them as a souvenir? That's considered fine. Gnog has to ask - as gently as he can, of Aurelia - his army side needs to know. How many did we lose in the end, of the Boros? They took the bulk; pulled in reinforcements from around the planet. Around 80,000 fell. Less than expected - the Orzhov souls that sacrificed themselves made a huge difference. Twice more than that injured, but they'll recover. "If it's any consolation, I have seen bravery and valour often in war; but the Boros taught me new lessons in just what a shining example that could be... This world looks up to you. But they do perhaps ask if you might be *little* less enthusiastic in P6?!" "Ha! We'll have a word with Krenko. Perhaps he can police his own district."

* We catch up with Boboremos. Pyres will be built as they recover bodies of their dead. They'll celebrate their glorious deaths. They have a nation of their own now. A difficult challenge ahead. Boboremos confesses - "from one old warrior to another... I feel that this war and the founding of the Gruul nation is my Magnus Opus. And I shall hereafter fade, such that a younger, more firey soul can rise. But you didn't hear that from me!" **He tells us that if we leave, "don't forget to look down".**

  - We also learn that Greena and Mela's flat was destroyed, but they have their belongings.
  - They are keen to be part of a new Gruul nation and Boboremos won't let them take any shit either, so they should be safe.
  - Arxcis has said goodbye.

* Nissa arrives. "You're not planning on staying for second half, are you?" "Is it boring?!" "I've been told it is". "You think you'll duck out?" "I was going to head over to Vitu Ghazi." "Mind if we come along?" "I was going to ask. There's an old friend of ours who would like to see you."

* Gnog walks to a shadowy side of the chamber, to call into the darkness, but hears someone saying "No! NO! Don't pee here!" and Gnog laughs and calls, "If anyone from the Dimir were hear, which of course they are not, then I would like to offer my thanks, say that i think we're hopefully pretty much equal..." and a whisper, "The ledger has been balanced!" "...hope we can work again together sometime. Also, my strongest commendations for a certain Lord P., whose work was exemplary, and even fooled the gods." A chuckle in the dark... "There is *no* Lord Penderworth. He doesn't actually exist." "Who did we meet?" "Who knows." "Well a commendation to the mystery, then! Farewell."

* We return the "pearl of seeing" to Speaker Zegana. We're sorry they took such heavy losses but without the Krasis we'd have been done for. She hopes that it might bring the two parts of the guild back together (holdfasts, etc.) in time. She asks if we have oceans on our world. Gnog describes their beauty. She says "Maybe I will come, when everything is settled. I will travel the worlds in search of the oceans." She produces a tiger-striped conch shell. "This is for you." "Thank you." "It will allow you to breathe and speak in water environments, should you ever come back and visit us, or if you have any such desire to do so in your own oceans".

* Rakdos himself is here. The hot breath down Gnog's neck - "I trust I was sufficient entertainment in the end?" asks Gnog. "Yes. The whole time, actually. I had a dream, well a nightmare, a waking dream? I had been put to sleep." "The hand of Bolas?" "No, I think it was our Golgari friends, actually! But in that dream I sensed a disturbance, and that disturbance led me to you. I know you have perused our services and wares..." "I did enjoy the Hellfire Club!" "...and I wonder if you understand what the Rakdos are about; but I suspect there are things in your conscience that will always hold you apart from our purpose. We aligned when it was important for it to be so. Well met. At least we did not find ourselves on opposite sides."

* Vraska's here, with the brother Jared. We go over. "Ah, good to see you Vraska; Jared..." We ask what's going on - Jared is the Guildmaster. Where's Savra? Down below. She's OK. Jared has decided to open embassies; to mingle more with the surface, for those who want it. Vraska will lead efforts on the surface - the first of the Golgari emissaries. "That is good to hear. I hope it works out." An exodus out of the tunnels as people leave; the Kraul will be honoured and compensated for their help.

* Taysa is in an intense discussion with some people. She's complaining about the wine. We ask if she might look after the Amonkhet diadem. It'd be wasted hanging on a wall in a tavern. A museum, perhaps? She tries it on, in fact, and likes it! It's a bit much for our tastes but - Orzhov. She even pays us - 3 rubies, 3 emeralds (18,000gp!) - she thinks it is very beautiful and wanted something to signify her new status as Guildmaster. We bid her thanks and goodbye; "May your years be plentiful and prosperous!" she says. "Yours too, I guess!"

We sneak out. Rakdos hasn't stuck around either! We find Nissa. She's talking to a squirrel. "OK! Let's go." - the squirrel is put into her pocket. We head to P3 where huge movements of food supplies are already underway, but before we leave, Gnog hurries over to the old Chamber rubble and grabs a small stone of it. "Souvenir", he says. "I'm sure they won't mind!"

Vitu Ghazi is there. The withering damage is obvious. "I might like to have a chat wit her before we go" says Gnog. Many tent cities too, around parts of the concourse that are still intact. Much rubble is being cleared manually - lots of damage here from when the Platform fell (P3 and P4 badly hit by that). Tired, but high spirits. Today they are free! They can honour their dead, start replanting, think about the future.

We're taken to one of the remaining Verdani. There are only about four left, but the rest of the planet will be contributing more in time. Nissa calls down some vines and we're pulled up into what seems to be a food distribution centre up in the tree. She calls out - and there is Levinia. She sees us and shouts over. "Did you see? I fired arrows at the dragon!" "Did they hit?" "Yes, I think! How are you?" "Good, thanks; all things considered. You?" She met someone, in the midst of it all. **Quintorious**. Before the world, a historian - very unusual for a Selesnyan, writing things down instead of telling them verbally. "He says it's the future. I don't know about that but he's very cute!" - we meet him. A loxodon, too; wearing glasses, holding a clipboard, directing things. It's good to see that they've found each other. "Thank you. For believing in me." "Always, from the start." "Wherever you go, I hope the sun will shine, the rain will nourish and your family will flourish. I'm glad you find your heart's desire!" she says to Fee-Ree. "Likewise. I hope we meet you again sometime."

Another departure.

Nissa will head back, speak to Jace and return to her home world. Hugs all round. Not many words left.

**A last look. A last moment in the strange, but wild, connected world of the Selesnyans.**

We seek out Greena and Mela. We talk about the Gruul; they are delighted! "I never thought I'd see the day that we'd have a nation of our own. We'll most definitely want to be part of that!" We walk them up to Skarrg. As we go, they're reminiscing with Arxcis. Gnog has a hard time keeping his shit together, really, with the emotional overload of it all.

Much activity at Skarrg. From the parapets we hear a shout. "You're still here!" - Ajani! Gnog is surprised - "Ha! Hello! What are you doing here?!" "Well, to be honest I followed the booze... I always liked being up here actually. Reminds me of abandoned forts back home. Always had a sense that there were significant things afoot!"

Gnog uses the sending stone. "Hey, anyone still on-world, Ajani has a massive keg of beer up at Skarrg. Come party!" - but he's not really expecting an answer.

**We hang out for a while, drinking together and telling stories. Greena and Mela, Arxcis, Fee-Ree and Deni, Taz, Gnog and Ajani. Gnog takes this moment in, trying to capture it in his mind forever somehow. It seems to precious to ever forget.**

The big funeral pyres have been set up around Skarrg. Areas around it have been more or less flattened, providing lots of space. As the sun begins to set, the now-familiar drum beat music of the Gruul starts. From the vantage point up on the wall, we can see processions beginning - not sombre or respectful, but drunken, jostling, spontaneous little fights and general revelry. One by one, Viashino ready bows with flaming arrows; the goblins throw bottles of spirits onto the pyres, smashing as the arrows hand. A line of the pyres light up, stretching into the red wastes.

Gnog looks to Ajani, "This is quite a first date!" "Yes. The smell of baking...(!)" - joke of the year right there. Toooooo soooooon. He'll be headed back to his world though, soon; responsibilities there that he's been avoiding. He asks if we're leaving tonight? Deni says, "It's kind of poetic, don't you think? Leaving as we arrived." "In the dark?" "Yeah!"

Difficult, but true. It'd be too easy to linger - to hold the feelings of friendship, camaraderie and belonging; but the Gatewatch are dispersed, the Planeswalkers travel home and the Ravnicans have no need for us outsiders as they heal their planet and their communities.

Time to go - rip off the plaster quickly.

We reach the tunnel entrance. An apparition appears next to us at the tunnel entrance; it's Jace, projecting. He's not here to say goodbye. "I'm here to say thank you. Thank you for coming. Thank you fur trusting me." "What's next for you?" "I want to chase a memory. I want to chase a memory to find it... I believe there was a time when I was happy. I want to find it; find that time, understand it, understand what it is and wrap myself in it. I'm going to retrace my steps; head to Ixalan first. That's the last time I remember being happy, or at least I have a memory of that..." - and he shows the vial of the memory with Vraska. "I'll go back to where this was and see if I can understand why... Who knows. Maybe it was Vraska, maybe the place, maybe because I didn't remember and had nothing to worry about. Until I'm needed again, honestly, I can't wait to get off this world! I never wanted to be the living Guild Pact. I never wanted this kind of responsibility. Don't much like people to be honest! When I had amnesia, living as a pirate on a ship, was probably the happiest I've ever been that I can remember." He figures he won't call us, if he is in need; he wouldn't want to intrude. We shouldn't call him either! But he is sure we will meet again anyway - he has foreseen it.

**"So long" says Gnog. Jace answers, "Fly safe". "Heh. Thanks. Taz always does!" - and Jace fades away.**

The goblin lady is still here, "Tickets please!" she says as a joke and laughs - but then takes on a firey aura. We recognise the firemind. "We're heading away Niv." "Yes. All things come to an end. This has been a long time coming. Even I could not have foreseen the way that these things panned out! This was not the future I was shown, but I dare say it is better than the one I could have imagined." He talks of the guilt he carries - desperate times, desperate measures. He sees how it could seem callous... But Gnog saw how much he cared, that first time that Bolas broke through and attacked Ravnica.

**"Farewell, Niv Mizzet. We'll see you again."**

**"If you come back to this world, you will always be welcome."**

...and the goblin is back. "Did you want your cart back?" "Consider it our gift. The least we could do for services rendered". "Hurry along now! Ships are coming back. They want the space!"

So we head down to the Navigator and Taz says "Well this is a buzzkill - you'll have to wait an hour!"

We kill time. It's fully dark above, we think. As the others are on deck, Gnog pokes his head down into the pilot cabin. "I know you did something big. Something good... Because I have a sense of debt I can't explain ever since Bolas fell. And you have a sense of loss, which isn't quite what Deni thought."

Taz thinks, then says (Keen Mind Feat) - "Some of the minutes don't add up. It is related to those cards we had. Things were left unwritten. We forgot because we had to, so that Bolas could not discover our plans. Even Jace would need to make himself forget such things completely... Perhaps he does this often; and of course, he could by definition never know the answer to that. Although this feels emotionally unsatisfactory, it is likely that we should pursue it no further, for fear of rediscovering something which should remain undiscovered. Did you hear the sphinxes?"

"Yes, that's what made me think of this.

"We should not go chasing long lost dreams...! It shall always be the missing minute. Oh! Your timing is good. We are ready to fly."

Gnog says, "Would you mind a bit of a fly by - let's cruise over Skarrg, look down, then have a proper look at this world we saved."

And so, we ascend. We head of the Red Wastes. Looking down, funeral pyres stretch out in their row, lighting up camps full of revelry. The Gruul are in force. 

We fly past the huge bonfire at Skarrg. Taz used Sending to Boboremos - "We are looking down. Haunting beauty. The pyres burn so brightly that even the Gods must see them!". At this, Gnog asks Taz to send one last message. Boboremos again. "One last thing. We fight the passing of years as we fight any enemy. Wisdom is wise, but do not grow old gracefully, honoured king!" (25)

Then, a bright flash, a sunbeam, spinning around. Ajani's axe. Gnog shouts down, "Goodbye!" as loudly as he can, but probably isn't heard. Taz dips the ship's wings; left, right, left, right, then steadies us. The lights of Vitu Ghazi hang like a thousand glow-worms in a cave and we pass over the Blistercoils, glowing below the streets, with a familiar bioluminescent glow clearly visible from Zonot 7. Deadbridge Chasm, dark. P1, D11, D12 as we start to lift, lit up a rebuilding goes into the night.

Ascending higher, we see the lights like necklaces around the planet, most of which we never got to see. The odd remnanant forest is visible. A few ships are headed down and we pass them, as they carry supplies. We chase the edge of night and day, the sun sparkling and gleaming as it appears over the globe.

Gnog: "*Thank you* Mr Tablabu... That's *very beautiful*..." - another pause, just taking in the view, then a sigh, it's time to leave - "...I think we should drop in at Ravnica Station, check with Alliance to make sure there aren't any other dangers beyond those we know of, then best speed to Rock Of Bral. So first - Ravnica Station, please, at your leisure."

Out, up, away.

About half an hour later, we're at Ravnica Station. Teeming with life. Docked, waiting to dock, patrolling. Three beautiful shrike ships are there; a bombard, a couple of space galleons. "Wow", says Gnog, "Never seen so many ships!" and we queue for docking. Ignominious arrival! Dockmasters apologise; unless we can just land on the surface there's an hour wait, but we're happy to land on a crater so long as there's air. So we touch down smoothly and disembark.

Gnog remarks, "I hope New Garren's OK. Maybe busy making himself known to new followers below!" and we head over, trying to find our way on foot - much destruction, the docks being rebuilt and much not operational yet - to the market area.

We're surprised to find that Redani has reopened Pieces Of Limbo! He's there in person. He thinks the Xaryxians won't dare attack again; the Alliance guard ships are stationed permanently. Ravnica is too important. They're sticking around to help with the relief effort. He says that the Alliance would be happy to escort us to the edge of Guildspace; some are heading that way anyway. Plenty of new recruits now that Ravnica knows about other worlds! We thank him for that and ask when they depart. Any time really - we say, half an hour? Sure!

So we check on the plant we'd seen all those weeks ago. Sold! To someone else! Lots of new trade. Dammit. Never mind - someone else will get more out of is.

### 9pm

We're ready to depart; we get on board, Arxcis is fine in the cramped conditions and even wants to help with watch cycles. We lift off and join up with a Flying Fish ship, which follows us out. Taz waits until both our ship and theirs are free of influence then calls to tell us to get ready but Gnog holds him for a minute and gets Deni on deck and points at the planet.

"After all we've been through, it's strange, isn't it. You don't just get *this* world at your fingertips. You get *all* of them."

We talk more as we go to full speed. Deni asks Gnog if he's keeping secrets - she saw him talk to Taz and had a funny feeling about the battle too. "Even Rath Modar had contingencies for if he fell. How come Bolas just *died*?" So Gnog talks about his brief conversation with Taz and the issue of memories. Unsettling though it is, this seems like something we should leave alone. Deni isn't sure if we should trust Jace - she doesn't, really - and Gnog agrees, but points out that we all agreed in the planning, including Gatewatch and Fixers alike, that we would let Jace have us magically forget things that would threaten the plan's success if discovered later. So, it seems we all trusted him that much - which seems enough. Secrets breed distrust; it seems missing memories, likewise; but we should not fall prey to paranoia. Nobody seemed to give any indication of fear that Bolas may have somehow escaped - it seems, this time, that whatever the forgotten details are, we really did just... Win.

We briefly slow for a small pod of kindori. Gnog says, "This is what I mean about things out here - perhaps it doesn't match my favourite parts of Toril, but there's definitely beauty and wonder in all all this, in large amounts. Just look at them!"

They pass, we continue and eventually reach the edge of Guildspace. It's about 8 hours of travel.

## 5am, day 62 (Ravnica 42, Riglan 99, met Riglan on 122 - 6 hours shifted forward)

We slow down at asteroids clustered near the edge. A small debris field; Gnog perception 24. Recognises bits of wing, parts of a ceramic hull; it looks like parts of a Star Moth. He points it out and says "well I don't know if the good guys won but the bad guys definitely lost!" - we can see (but not hear) cheering and celebration on the Flying Fish as they see it too.

We reach the Astral Sea. One of the crew flies to us. They're headed to Freedom Station. We can go there, or could peel off.

We thank them and say that perhaps we'll go directly to our destination. The air bubbles touch for us to say goodbyes properly.

**As they dart off, a small apparition coalesces out of motes of starlight. New Garren!** It floats over to the ship. Gnog says "hi". "Hello!". It knew of Gnog calling, but couldn't "materialise". Appearing on any Prime Material plane is "naughty god" territory, he says! And he's still gathering followers; he noticed the Ravnica uplift. "But I feel more like a philosophy at the moment!". He will accompany us to the boundary to Wildspace, though, which he says will take about 2 days. We can exchange stories.

And so, for two days, we rotate watches and share stories with New Garren.

* Gnog chats to Arxcis when alone on watch and rest. "I hope you don't *mind* us 'rescuing' you like this - just appearing, pulling you off Ravnica." "No. No, of course not! Of course I would want to go home. It was... You know. I was trying to make the best of the situation I was put in. And I made connections, of course, but I never thought that I would ever be able to go home, so... Of course not. I thought about Fee-Ree all the time."

* We also talk of futures. Gnog is surprised to learn that Arxcis is in his 50s, and he thinks Fee-Ree must be too by now. They don't know for sure, but believe the oldest of their kind might live to the mid 70s. So Gnog learns that they really don't have as long as he hoped. Arxcis also talks about philosophies. He thinks we should avoid the "what if", the what Niv did, the what if he didn't... We have but one life. One "run around the sun". We should make it count; not "lose yourself in the fake world of what could have been".

* Later Arxcis prepares food. He always used to cook!

## Day 63 (Ravnica 43, Riglan 100, met Riglan on 122 - 6 hours shifted forward)

* Gnog also chats to Deni when alone on watch and rest. "I was thinking about what you said about Bolas, and Rath Modar. I think perhaps it was a question of numbers. With Rath Modar, it was just us. We weren't so powerful, then, either. With Bolas, well, he was swarmed with Planeswalkers. I have no idea what spells, or counter-spells, they were casting to keep things in check. That must be why he seemed to fall easily - really, he was beset and distracted - realising at the end that there was perhaps a danger, previously inconceivable; but whittled down, unable to plan a course of action." Deni hmms. "I feel like this is something I would have a nightmare of. That somehow, he didn't die. That he'd fooled us all. Hiding somewhere, biding his time to come back. Well after our time is over. Way in the distant future. I suppose we shouldn't really care? It's just that anxiety. That feeling of dread - that we hadn't really finished the job."

* Gnog suggests Deni talk to Vajra when we get back. She talks about her past; she's had nightmares, it transpires. About people in her past - she thinks she hasn't done right by them, that they might not think she cares. "I don't want to be one of those young people that one day dreams of leaving home, and never looking back. I owe so much to the people in my past."

We resolve to definitely expedite getting up north, after arrival on Toril, to get up to see her grandmother, ASAP.

Much chatting with the god. So many stories to share!

## Day 64 (Ravnica 44, Riglan 101, met Riglan on 122 - 6 hours shifted forward)

At around 7am we reach the strange, mirror-like boundary to Wildspace. It's striking how different each system looks. This one is distinctly "ours". It's something about the sun sun(s), mostly, it seems.

Gnog talks to New Garren. How can a religion be started? The God can grant his - currently meagre - powers to an agent on the world, he gains power. When people do things in his name, hopefully good!, then he gains meaning and from that, power. Taz has come on deck for this. Gnog says he will spread this word where he can. If a god is called to in order to help save a loved one and it seems to *work* - when prayers are answered - that faith begins. The Ravnicans believed in the story, but they didn't have *faith* per se, so that's why New Garren felt like a philosophy, not a religion.

Taz simply says, "There will be times in my long life when I need aid. At least I know I have someone I can always call to. I shall live, I hope, a very long time; so you shall not be forgotten for at least that long and, if I can help it, for much longer beyond."

New Garren answers. "I will wander the Astral Sea. If you call to me when you are here, I can come to you. If you tell me your needs when you are on a world, I will do my best to grant you what power I have."

Taz says, "Thank you. That's more than I hoped and more than I ever could have asked for."

Gnog says, "Goodbye, New Garren. I hope we meet again."

"Do not be afraid. I will always be watching."

**Gnog smiles and asks Taz to head back down and pilot us in. He watches the god as we pass through - his vision shimmers, and we're in Wildspace suddenly.**

The sense of self and weight return. Wildspace is brighter than Gnog remembers, more colourful. "Wow!"

Taz navigation with BFS and orrery for advantage, 27 total. He was aiming for Rock Of Braal and has done quite well; we're about half way between the sun and system edge already. We're only a few hours away - maybe only 8 hours or so, he thinks. Gnog says, "I've really no idea how you keep breaking the rules like this, Taz!"... And on we fly.

We are quickly reminded that Wildspace - specifically, Realmspace - while big, is also busy. There are a few slowdowns for other ships, so it takes a fair bit longer than 8 hours. We even encounter *space clowns* (!) - Taz tells us - who are essentially pirates who've spent waaaaay too long in Wildspace and gone somewhat crazy. Our small ship looked like easy pickings, but they learned quickly of their error. Taz was piloting; Fee-Ree and Deni went up top for ranged attacks and Gnog didn't even need to use the ballista as they did enough damage between them to make the pirates turn tail. Fee-Ree singed their bow badly and Deni put an arrow through the ear of their First Mate!

A bombard is another one - full of Giff. All very proper. We greet them formally and are invited on board for tea. Arxcis has never done that and the tea was good last time, so we gratefully accept. Tea, cake and biscuits dipped in the tea. Gnog loses half of his first biscuit immediately - he's new to it. But we learn the proper way. We're given news of the comings and goings of Realmspace, as well as tidings on the Rock Of Braal.

Eventually, we reach the Rock Of Braal. Everyone is one deck except Fee-Ree, who is flying; but she asks if Taz is OK to take the ship in. It's very busy! Taz is delighted to be back and knows his home well - his built-records of this are detailed. Taz tries to navigate in. We're contacted by their traffic control; we try to get dry dock, but it's full - it'd be another day. A mooring in half an hour, though; and we'll be in queue for dry dock. So we wait the mooring.

### 5:30pm (assuming the Astral Sea 1:1) Rock time, 6 hours ahead of Toril - but on day 63 (Ravnica 43, Riglan 100)

We finally dock at the Rock Of Braal. Arxcis gets to experience weird gravity plane shenanigans. After docking, we learn it's actually 6:30pm; Taz checks a few things and figures out we're actually jolted a day earlier - not 1 hour late, the Astral Sea can't "run slow" compared to elsewhere - so it must be 23 hours fast. It'd be just after midday on Toril.

Deni yelps! "Oh my god! I was just going to change. AND LOOK. Look! We have a stowaway!" - below is a little space guppy, hiding. Taz checks with it. Does it need to get back to its group?! It holds up art! It's made tiny portraits of all of us. It explains that it loves to draw and paint but the astral sea is mostly empty. It snuck on board! Had a good time painting all of us. It *really* wants to go to the Rock Of Braal!

We are each given a portrait! Except Gnog. "I already made you one!" - it's the *same Chwinga* that we encountered all that time ago. We thank the Chwinga and wish him well; he will go to the market and set up a stall.

* We pay for 2gp docking fees. We tell them we'll be at the Park Grand again - hoping that there's a room there! - and they'll move it to Dry Dock when available. An engineer comes over to assess damage and repair requirements. We have to pay half up front - much paint missing on one side; lots of sand in places sand shouldn't be. The old name a little visible... We have to pay extra for "no questions asked"! Repaint, clean up... A full overhaul. 200gp up front, 200gp later. Huh. Uuuh, OK, *fine*. Paid.

* We head over to the Park Grand. We have to take everything off the ship for repairs. They have a family room which Fee-Ree suggests we take, 2 bedrooms. 2 nights. 10gp.

Gnog considers leaving Taz's parents until the next morning, for a full day, but Taz is keen to go straight away. Arxcis packs some things in the Bag Of Holding to make them dinner. We head to the workshop in the alley, and Gnog knocks. Gnog feels surprisingly nervous. A voice calls "Coming, coming!" and footfalls; looks through some spy hole the the door... "Oh! Oh my goodness!" - various locks open - "Oh! You should have told us you were coming!" - it's Rerdian. Hugs all round. Introduces himself to Arxcis. "Zorbu would come to the door, but he's had an accident! Come in!"

"Well, wasn't quite an accident. We had a scuffle with someone who took issue with his craftsmanship. He's fine, just resting. Our schedule has been completely thrown since this happened. It was four days ago. He just needs to heal."

Gnog realises that Taz isn't even listening - he's long gone. He's run to Zorbu's room. "Tazythus! Oh! My boy!" - he tries to get up, but is in pain. Taz runs over as Zorbu sits up in bed. "Goodness. You haven't changed at all!" "Apart from the hat". "It's a very good hat. I used to have a hat like this!" - Taz medicine check 18+4, 22. Zorbu is healing but has a cracked rib. Taz immediately casts a healing spell. This is the first time Zorbu has seen Taz cast. "Is that better?" "Huh! Yes! It is. That's miraculous. Wow. Well... I didn't teach you that!" "My friends helped me learn. They'll be here in a minute." "Did you go far? Did you get - to the edge?" "Yes! And beyond!" - Zorbu struggles out of bed, stiff, gets a cane and is the middle of it when Taz just calls, "Father?" "Yes?" "It's good to see you..." - and hugs Zorbu.

They walk back to the group, hand in hand.

Arxcis is asking about food! They haven't eaten too recently. Arxcis asks if he can cook; yeah, that would be great.

Taz is surprisingly quiet. The others are in the kitchen and Deni and Gnog are awkwardly sort of waiting in the lounge. Deni goes in to see if they need help - comes out a moment later. Gnog says, "hey are you OK?" "I'm very happy..."

Zorbu sits in a rocking chair. Rerdian sits besides. They're eager for stories.

We start at the start. Taz leads the stories. Illusions, music, breaks for excited chatter as he just has words tumbling out. About 45 minutes in, all the food turns up. It's amazing! All sorts of things, shared food, a bowl of flatbreads and various dips. Deni eggs on the stories - "oh! Tell them about this!" and so-on. Gnog realises that Taz hasn't had a drawn out vowel or stutter *once*. Just fluid, fast, enthusiastic speaking. Fee-Ree mostly sits happily next to Arxcis listening, chipping in now and again. Gnog sits back, almost prouder than he can bear, just watching this all happen.

We get to a point in the story where Rerdian taps Zorbu's hand. He's fallen asleep! He wakes immediately - "Oh! Yes! Tell me more!" but we've kept him up very late and he's healed, but still tired. "Come on love, let's you get back to bed" says Rerdian. Gnog checks the chronometer - 11:30pm!

As we're helping them to bed, we talk of meeting them tomorrow. Beevi was targeted too -  "us gnomes, apparently!" - claiming faulty merchandise, but it wasn't. We're going to look into that.

Deni has a determined look. Gnog's on that page. "We won't rock the boat, don't worry. We'll just have a chat with them, encourage them not to do that again..."

(We end up leaving them with some healing potions, for future use!)

So Zorbu heads to bed. He mentions to Taz, in confidence, that he's thinking of taking Rerdian somewhere that he'll be better suited to. He's from Limbo, but that's a very strange place; perhaps the Astral Sea. Zorbu says he's got "a good couple of hundred of years left yet", but Rerdian might not if he stays on this plane. Taz in turn confides about his spark having lit, 

Rerdian waves at the door as we leave. Gnog, perception 18. Deni is distracted, looking towards one of the dark parts of the alley. Gnog says to her, "OK so we'll keep walking like nothing's happened, but what do you see?" "Hold on" she says, walks towards the corner; a glint of metal; a young man emerges, his hands up. "I don't mean anything by it! I was told to be on lookout, and all you people turned up!" Deni asks, "Who for? Are you the people who injured Zorbu... Because if you are...?!" "No! Nonono! I was sent by the artificer! The woman!" "Oh. Beevi?" "Eh, one of those names, I can't ever remember. She paid me to come and keep an eye out. And if there was any trouble to let her know right away." Deni assesses and lowers the knife. "Right. Well, you're doing a shit job of hiding!"

We smooth things over and head back to the room. After a brief discussion about tomorrow, we head to sleep.

Taz just sits in a corner for a while, glowing orange from within, thinking... How can he protect them?

## Day 64, Rock Of Bral (Riglan 101, met Riglan on 122 - 6 hours shifted forward)

We wake up around 8:30am, well-rested. Gnog finds it strange somehow to see trees out of the window. It's not something that happened much outside of P3 on Ravnica.

We wonder if we should involve "the law" but Arxcis points out that if they were effective, surely they'd already have been told. Why not ask Beevi? So we figure we'll have a quick breakfast then head to the market.

Around 9:15-9:30am, we wonder out and head across to the market. It's starting to ramp up. Early morning food stalls are packing up but vendors are appearing. Beevi and her uncle are there, with a big bowl of rags and some paint thinner, washing off graffiti!

We head up, Gnog calls to them from a bit away. "Beevi! Hi!" The uncle answers, looking flustered, "Oh, we are open..." but then Beevi recognises us. "Oh it's you!" - she asks if we're well and if we passed on the letter. We pass on the message in return - her words were, "Point taken, I'll visit!" There's some smalltalk; Beevi doesn't tend to travel with Vi because of mum's great, complicated, convoluted, world-saving important plans. "I learned a while ago that she can save the world on her own with other people. It doesn't have to be me."

We get into the conversation about graffiti and so-on. "It was just a shake-down, but they went a bit far with Zorbu... We're not supposed to sell magical things here, you see. We don't see what we sell as magical; they're not potions or scrolls or wands. It's technology. It's not usually an issue, but there are some more... Conservative forces. Luddites I guess. They view anything like this as magic. So, you know; they tell us that what we're doing is illegal and that we can't be selling this stuff. But it's in our blood! Gnomes tinker. We make things. We make wonderous things! Things that are for all intents and purposes *not* magical; it's technology. Invention. Engineering, albeit at a small scale. They don't see it that way. Now and then, things come to a head."

The Guild of Hedgemages are implicated, she thinks. They make the rules; we'd have to petition the Pirate Prince, a whole different circle of people. She doesn't want to risk drawing his attention - he might side with them. If you can get an autognome to help out around the house, for example, why would you need a Hedgemage to cast Continual Flame, or Prestidigitation, or cast Unseen Servant once a day. They're threatened by it. But that's progress! The Guild hires ruffians - urchins - perhaps that's an angle; if we manage to make the cheap hires afraid of us, or we can persuade them there's a better paid option, then the Guild would have to do their own dirty work and probably don't want to be seen being destructive in public. Not good for the image of 'friendly household mage'.

We'll have to figure that out. Meanwhile, a tuning fork! We'd have to buy an ore, so that Beevi could smelt it and cast it. She gives us details of how to buy.

We recall the person who tried to steal our money. People get stuck here; wanting onward passage, but unable to pay for it. Beevi knows where they hang out; a clubhouse off an alley in the Edge; she gives us directions.

The ore is nearby; we fetch it first and bring it, so that gets underway quickly. Beevi thinks it can be cast into a tuning fork, ready by tomorrow morning.

Next up, it being early; we figure, urchins probably just getting up, getting ready for a fun day of criming. So we go to the clubhouse place and scope it out. Gnog perception 19, Taz investigation 28 (he knows exactly where it is - built-in map, thank you Zorbu!). Gnog notices eyes peering at us, up on the roofline and around corners. They look and dart away, quickly. Lookouts. Deni's keeping an eye on our stuff! We know there's a chance of things being stolen.

We get to the alley. Up some steps up the side of a narrow building sandwiched between two others close by. A door on the second level. Small place. Gnog politely knocks, and waits. The door surprisingly opens! A small face appears. Scraggy hair. Tall, though, up to Gnog's chest - 6ft or so. "We need to talk" says Gnog. "No. We don't want trouble. Go away!" and tries to close the door. "You're already in trouble" says Taz; "the question is how deep you want to go" and tries to push the door open. Athl nat 1+3, oops, but Gnog quietly helps - 23. The door flies open again. Lots of people crammed inside. Smelly. Crates with bed rolls. Lots of small, dirty people, of all ages. Nobody *too* young - Gnog thinks teenagers, to young adult - maybe 13 to 22 or thereabouts, at least, the humans.

A bigger guy stands. Half orc? Starts to move forward aggressively. Gnog shouts, "Stand down son, we're here to talk"; intimidation 19. This half-orc comes forward and is in Gnog's face. He's trying to put himself in between our party and the others.

"Ah, I'm sorry. I misjudged you. I thought you were here to attack, but you're here to protect, I see. We are *not* here to hurt anyone. If we wanted to hurt anyone - " (draws the greataxe) "- we would've done so already. But we don't." (Axe is put away).

A girl, tiefling, fiery eyes, frosty skin, stands. "You can't just barge into people's homes."

True enough. We say that friends of ours were hurt. "You can't prove it!" - and so-on; we say we know they're just acting on deals they can't refuse. We hope to provide a better offer. Things escalate, Taz stepping in, seeing that they feel intruded upon; a safe space invaded. Taz says, "I apologise for intruding in your home. It is true, we have no proof and were rash to make assumptions" - but with Telepathy *thinks* to this girl, "You seem frightened. This is perhaps not the place to talk. We truly do want to help. Is there somewhere you wish to meet?"

The girl thinks. She says out loud, "Come. If you're looking for a business conversation, let's take this somewhere more appropriate". She gets 'Bruce' - the half-orc - "Bruce, you're with me!" - and turns to the taller door-opening guy, "We're going to sort out some more work". Turns to the young ones. "Don't you worry. We'll get some work. There'll be food. You just stay here. Don't fret." To us - "Come. Come, let's go up to the roof."

Beside the external stairs are metal handholds, like a fire escape, that leads to a roof. Gnog says, "Damn it, I'm sorry. I'm an idiot; of course, there may be all sorts of people watching and I didn't mean to put you in danger. We mean no harm but we can't have you harming our own, either."

She apologises - basically it was a panic thing. It got out of control.

We learn about them. They're desperate; she finds people who have fallen through the cracks and tries to look after them. We offer essentially a foundation; the girl says that it'd need someone to anchor it, make it official; Arxcis mentions a legal concept of reconciliation and suggests that to humanize everyone. Zorbu and Rerdian could underwrite this. We can make sure money flows. Taz is long-lived; he is willing to be the baseline for it all, over a long period.

"I am Oona."

We end up giving 5gp - they need food, but also medicine. It has to be weighed out as 100 coppers and 40 silvers. Soon enough, people are running out on errands. We bid Oona fairwell and say we'll be back hopefully later today but either way - she'll hear from us.

As we leave, Deni says, "Wow. They really were - sort of - all ages in there. They weren't all kids. Some were older than me. That could have been me, stuck in Duskhollow. If granny had had an accident..." - ouch. Yes. Life is fragile.

Arxcis points out that it's a question of skills. We realise that education is needed. This organisation we're creating can't just be a safehouse accumulating more and more kids! It needs to become a guild, or apprenticeship, or school, or *something* that helps them move on. Gives them skills in whatever they need.

We wander around, mulling ideas. Gnog has to ask if we can help Rerdian and Zorbu; Rerdian ages quickly here. Taz confesses in secrecy that Zorbu had talked of going to the Astral Sea. Fee-Ree suggests the Fey Wild; it wouldn't help their different (possibly) rates of ageing but would give them both longer together, they'd perceive time passing the same but it actually would age far slower and it's neither as boring nor as dangerous as the Astral Sea. Once things are established with safehouse/flophouse - really a matter of only a few days to get it solidified in law - and once they're ready, we can offer them a route to the Fey should they want it.

Since we're not too sure how that's going to work we first decide to visit Miken before going back to pick up Zorbu and Rerdian. We head across to the academy.

The usual lectures going on - time, metaphysics, planes, relativity (whatever *that* is) - we ask around; he's not a lectures right now, but in a common room. We head over and find him. He's surprised! "You're back! Where have you been? What have you been doing?"

We just say Ravnica and Amonkhet. He's not "done outer planes yet" so hasn't heard of those. We say that whatever he might learn about Amonkhet is probably wrong, but about Ravnica, probably right! On the back of a discussion about the Mercane, we get into a debate about opening up Toril to space flight again, heh; Gnog suggests he learns all he can, gets facts and could in time offer that political suggestion on Toril backed up by that education. It's strange that the Mercane seemed to want to isolate Toril further, but then again, opening it up wider is risky. Perhaps they wanted to isolate it and take everything for themselves - control the Etherium supply, keep the population in the dark. We don't know if the disruption caused by the removal of Tesseret is enough to make them park that plan; other things to worry about. Fingers crossed. **It's something we might need to look into, or hire someone to look into.**

We have coffee with Miken and then bid farewell. It's time to get back to Zorbu and Rerdian and ask about this reconciliation idea of Arxcis'. Understandably, there is initial hesitance. "Is it safe?" he asks - concerned for Zorbu. Taz speaks for them; he thinks this is safe; he'd never put either of them in harm's way, he cares about them both very deeply. Arxcis is quite factual with stories about how he's seen it work; Fee-Ree adds in some more heartfelt things, that helps it seems less factual. Zorbu is quite keen but Rerdian remains cautious. Taz persuasion 27. Well yeah, that's enough! "Alright, alright, I trust you" says Rerdian. "It's worth a try. Besides. It's probably so much better to have them on our side than against us."

Over the rest of the day, we get lunch at the market, keep storytelling to finish after last night and in the end, reach The Edge and get the meeting. A nervous moment.

Oona and the kids are there. They've made a big effort - the place has been cleaned up a *lot*. A big pot of stew is on the go; some of yesterday's bread, cheap from the bakery; all gathered around, little bowls and dipping the bread.

Two very sheepish boys do their best to apologise. Zorbu forgives them; people are getting along, more or less.

Later, Zorbu and Rerdian say, "You know what? How many of you like to read?" A few can read. A few say they're not so good. "Well I have a lot of books. Lots of books! I used to read them to Taz, every night and day when I was filling his head with knowledge. Why don't we bring some books to the market, to our stand? You could pick them up if you wanted to read it. And we could hire some of you, to help perhaps. We have to be there all day and it gets tiring; you could watch the store and most of the time, there's no business anyway, so you could read?" - and Oona agrees.

"Little beginnings" says Gnog, "grow to great things... I think?". Taz giggles and says, "I think it's - from tiny acorns do mighty oaks grow!"

(As a side-note, we later give a substantial float for the new 'flophouse' via an account at the Bank Of Bral that Arxcis opens and helps them understand).

Once we're wrapped up there, Deni suggests we go to dinner. There's a place she saw that she wants to try. Her treat! She confesses that she slid Oona a few more coins - how are they protecting themselves? What do they have for defence? Get some weapons!

It's not a fancy restaurant. A discussion inevitably about how much we're spending vs Oona; we don't want to be saviour complex bunch who just drip-feed cash, but we can't just dump a tonne of gold on them as *we* don't know what we'd do with it, never mind them. It has to scale up. Evolve and learn. That's our plan.

The restaurant is in the Dwarven quarter. Deni says she's really missed dwarves... She is remembering Greenside Tavern. The help they gave her; a job, lodging. She sees parallels with people here. "There are many people out there like that. They might not be killing gods, saving worlds; the impact they have on a young girl with no parents making her way on the small town on the edge of the woods - who knows what that girl could be, or what would've happened if they'd never taken her in."

It's autumn on Toril. We realise it's been two years.

We have good dwarven ale and stew. Gnog reminisces. Our wealth, power, friendships; the privilege is extraordinary. He raises a glass. **"To Ral Zarek, Aurelio, Gibo, Bebe and all those others who gave their lives on Ravnica so that we could sit here today, *safe*."**

The stories continue. Now Rerdian and Zorbu talk - about how they met, why they came to the Rock; where do they go, where next, we ask? "Oh, it's ages away. And there's so much good work we can do here now!" Zorbu is quite animated. Rerdian is looking on with love. That's why he chooses to be here.

Later, Rerdian and Gnog are at the bar. Gnog jumps in both feet. How long does Rerdian have left? He doesn't know. He figures he was the equivalent of, maybe, 30-something when they met; 25 years together since. He figures he's 60. His people? He has no idea; in Limbo they don't age. Old age for a Gith? Maybe, 70s, 80 if lucky.

Gnog mentions the Fey Wild. It's just there as an option, for the future, should they ever want it.

We walk home, along the starry streets. We drop off Zorbu and Rerdian. There's a message left for us at the hotel; the ship as at the dry dock; pick it up 5pm "at the next cycle" (tomorrow). OK, then, Toril tomorrow.

Gnog assures Taz that we'll get the "tuning fork" before we go. And we'll get one on Toril; he'll be able to move freely.

We head to bed.

In the main room, Taz replays the "movie" - his strange sort of minor illusion, like a low frame-rate movie, of the first seconds after activation - Zorbu's up-close face, then turning his head to see the three of us and Rerdian stood behind.



## Day 65, Rock Of Bral (Riglan 102, met Riglan on 122 - 6 hours shifted forward)

We wake up 7am, bright and early. Gnog and Deni in one bedroom, Taz in the main room, Fee-Ree and Arxcis in the other bedroom. The Rock has rotated more towards the sun - simulated dawn. He potters about a while, but there's no way to make tea etc. here so in the end he goes into Deni and Gnog's room and pounces on Gnog's bed, saying "wake up! Let's get breakfast at the market".

Gnog goes, "AAAAGH!" and then, "Oh. It's you!"

Everyone stumbles a bit bleary-eyed into the main room. Taz says, "They might have coffee and they might have ringbread. Worth a try."

We pack up our things, thank the inn operator - "it was nice to have you back! We'll see you on your next trip to the Rock Of Bral" and Taz says, "yes, I'll be back."

So, market.

The early food stalls are there, as hoped. Taz investigation 25. No ringbread! "Sorry Deni, but there is coffee and a bakery." Strange cakes, so we try some unusual things and buy a couple for Barry & Gerri. A stall slices sausages; Gnog tries some; Arxcis too. Not bad! 2gp spent all in.

Gnog wonders if the guppie is around; did he set up a stall? We ask a few people - yes, he did, but it's in the Low City. Nice to know he's all set!

We wander about browsing. At around 8:30am Beevi turns up with her uncle. "Ah! I've something for you!" - she gives Taz the "tuning fork" for the Rock. He hugs her and thanks her, "This gives me a way to see my parents, thank you." "I've also made it useful!" she says. At the end of the tips of the prong is a different screw head fitting! It's both a plane shift focus, and a screwdriver. "Neat!" says Taz.

Gnog suggests that we try something a bit different. New Garren needs followers, but can help if people "pray" or make requests, but only if they believe. So why not see if the kids in the flophouse are interested in divine intervention? The group decides it's a bit too "set up a charity, now sell religion". Bah. Maybe at least Zorbu or Rerdian might try it some time.

Deni suggests one of the interdenominational temples, though; set up a shrine? Why not! OK, so we head that way. We speak to a ministrant there, and that is in fact why this particular church exists. So many people pass through, that you can set up shrines, so we do that. There is a fee, and Gnog adds a donation. We're asked for descriptions - drawings are done - they can even commission an effigy. Taz is able to produce a Minor Illusion, so they end up with accurate drawings. "How long til it's set up?" The shrine, right away. The statue takes a couple of days. Gives us an excuse to come back soon to have a look. The fee for the statue is 40gp, for the story and shrine, 50gp, plus Gnog donates 50gp from his personal pot. 140gp all-in.

The questions they ask are detailed and leading. We answer as best we can. Astral Sea sea links, Torril roots; a god of redemption, people who are travelling, perhaps adrift. "What about calling them Garren The Redeemer?" they suggest. "Perfect!" says Gnog. Strength and knowledge; balance; connections and friendships. Not solitary. They go the extra mile, thanks to the donation. Not the intention but a nice outcome.

In the end, we thank them and head out. Outside, Gnog gives a Deni a huge hug. "Thank you! I was sceptical, but that was amazing and just what I wanted. I had no idea. What a great thought! Thank you again."

(Side-note: We see that the water lake is now very high; a recent delivery, then).

Gnog asks for his party's indulgence once more; Happy Beholder, for the Ajani messaging service!

On the way, we pass the "Lesser Market". Set atop a barrel, with "Portraits" written - slightly askew, hard to write so large when you're so small! - is the Chwinga, with a little easel. Gnog greets him - "Good to see you're set up!" - and it waves. Looking closely, Gnog notices no eyes. Strange; it can still see. He's had one bit of trade - one portrait. Asks if we can find him; no problem. We ask in return if we can help with anything? He feeds on sunlight and adulation. All good.

### 11:30am (6 hours ahead of Toril)

At the Beholder, it's very busy. Close to lunch time. Perhaps not the best time to ask. A Tabaxi comes over and greets us. "A table for five?" "Yes please" "On the floor, the mezzanine or the top floor?" "Floor please!" "Great, OK! Come this way!". We get a table and are invited to order with Luigi directly if we want. Sure!

We all head to the bar, except Deni, who holds the table for us. "Just get me a cider!"

At the bar, we wait our turn. Luigi smiles at us, speaks telepathically. "I recognise you! Oh. You have accomplished much. I can sense it. You have accomplished great things in the interim. A hero's drink perhaps?" "Perhaps not heroes, many others on Ravnica take that title. But drinks for sure." Luigi already knows about Deni's Cider, of course. Spiced mead for Fee-Ree and Arxcis. Dwarven ale for Gnog. Taz is asked; he doesn't drink, but tastes things. Anything good? Luigi answers, "How about a mug of chaos?!" - a mug of swirling liquid. "Every sip is different!"

Luigi has already read Gnog's mind too - he does the messaging service for others too. Sending spells are 25gp Per message. So Gnog is about to hand over 250gp, like ten paper birds. Luigi suggests, "You know, sometimes meeting in the middle makes a relationship stronger... You shouldn't necessarily pay for *all* his messages! Pay for just a couple. If he wants more, he can pay for them." "OK, 50gp! Plus the drinks?" "...Yes. 2gp for the drinks." Gnog says, "Well, you already know, but much obliged Luigi. This means a lot. Thanks!" 52gp handed over.

We retreat to our table and drink. Taz gets Deni to try the drink - two bad tastes, heh, that's why she has cider! He hums and hahs as he tries his drink and gets some good, some bad, but it's an adventure. Most interesting drink he's had.

We kill time talking. Still lots to learn about Arxcis and he doesn't know so much about us either. After a while we just go wondering. We end up outside the Mercane travel agency. Gnog says, "Taz, with me - rest of you, up to you, I'm going to make some sensitive enquiries..." and heads inside. TL;DR, with the mercane card we have, we're sent to the actual Mercane Agency proper. High level trades there; just travel here.

OK, what the hell. We give it a go - head to the Mercane Agency.

Outside is largely unmarked and unremarkable. Inside is conspicuously busy. Lots of desks, cubicles with glass "enclosure" walls; much quiet business being done. In the middle, a huge Mercane statue.

Gnog realises that he's never changed out of his P6 leather "intimidation" outfit. Gotta change before Waterdeep, heh. Funny looks.

TL;DR is we end up with a rep saying they'll organise a meeting with a mercane here, and will contact us - 50gp for the messaging service - on Toril, Feyrun, to let us know when. At best, several weeks. Footnote is: That, if anything, is another campaign hook or remains unresolved.

We do try to track down the Dohar. After a while, we realise we don't really have the time to pursue this on this trip. They're an underground group and hidden away; not where they were before. Some other time.

**Around 4pm Gnog takes Taz over to Zorbu and Rerdian, since we'll be leaving soon so he can say goodbye. It's quite a tearful thing, and Taz tells them both - "watch the skies above for when we leave. You'll see us."**

Not long after that, it's time for drydock. Taz is very quiet. Gnog is not surprised; gives him space. We meet the dockmaster and an administrator. There's some security and documentation rigmarole but it's all signed off, with a final inspection before the last bit of signing happens. We're taken to the ship.

It's looking good. All damage repaired, shiny new paint job, name redrawn on the sandstorm-damaged side. The interior was checked and the overall structure is considered sound. We sign the paperwork and receive a scroll with a 30 days guarantee. 30 whole days.

No time like the present. Time to go.

Dry dock clamps are released and the ship is moved manually to a position that's safer for lift-off. It's on the drydock edge. We jump on board.

Taz says, "I can use the orrery for Toril, but I'll need help when we're nearby to find wherever it is you want to land."

We're about to leave but someone outside is shouting "wait, wait!" on the dock. Gnog hangs outside. "What's up?" "These people won't leave until they get to see you!" It's Zorbu and Rerdian. Taz heads down to the ground. "It didn't feel right after the last time for us not to see you off. And also! And also, I wanted to bring you this" - says Zorbu. He pulls a book out of a bag. **"Articulated Histories Of The Gnomish Inventors"**. "This was a book I used to read to you. It's the closest thing I have of my family history. An explanation of who we are. I thought you might like to keep it." "I will treasure this. I will miss you! But I will be back soon."

"Don't let me hold you back. Safe travels." Zorbu gives Taz a hug and a kiss on his head. Rerdian too. Taz hugs Rerdian back. The dockmaster insists that they leave the platform now.

Everyone's back on board. Gnog uses the speaking tube to call down to Taz. "OK, Mr Tablabu. Time to leave. Don't fret. We'll be back."

Taz lifts off. He does a flash, fly-by spinny thing to make the silver paint glitter. Almost gets us in trouble with traffic control! We can see Zorbu and Rerdian waving. Then he heads under the Rock, towards Torril. It takes a while to clear traffic, then we're clear for fast speed, Taz calls up - "Fee-Ree, would you mind taking the helm for  a moment?" so she swaps over. Confirms the orrery location, then starts flying.

Taz comes up as we jump to fast travel and walks up to Gnog and just holds his hand. "It's harder than I thought. Leaving."

Deni walks up. "Well, I'm sorry it's hard. But look at it this way. You're the only one, out of all of us, who still has parents. You're quite lucky. And it's very sweet how much they care about you."

Taz says, "Yes, I know. I never really understood why Gnog was so sad about Gibo and Bebe at first. They were the same as me, I didn't see them as children or anything other than equals. But then Liliana and Gideon fell, I felt some responsibility as I couldn't get to them, and I think that helped me understand how Gnog felt. And now I understand a bit more about how you all feel when things leave. How you must have felt, Deni, when you were alone." "Well that's a *very* long time ago." "Yes, and time helps. This is all new to me. But it doesn't change my mind about what I said, about wanting to stick around. It just makes me appreciate the time we have more."

So we fly on and have to fall into shifts. It took two days to get here, but Taz says the Orrery helps and is showing that orbital changes mean it'll only be about 1.5 days even though the Navigator is a slightly slower ship.

It's a bit jarring to start. In the first 8-hour shift we drop out of fast travel no less than 3 times as it's so busy. Deni suggests taking a curved route, longer but further from traffic and hopefully faster. Taz goes on shift and navigation 27, plots a course. Fee-Ree apologises but Taz says no apologies needed, it was perfect, the line was good; the flight path was straight as an arrow, we just never accounted for all this traffic. She comments that it's odd, as we'd expect pretty much - none. We'll be ready to message Mert once we're close to Toril. We could probably message from here but may as well wait until closer.



## Day 66, Wildpsace (Riglan 103, met Riglan on 122)

We've moved the chronometer to Toril time. By midnight on that clock, it's been about 12-13 hours since we left the Rock. About a day left, then.

By about midday on Toril, Fee-Ree and Gnog confer about messaging Mert. Taz doesn't know Mert so can't do it. Fee-Ree can abuse L9 Wish again! She wants to figure out what to send, so write it down:

**"Gnog and party returning from wildspace. Requesting permission to land at academy, small wasp ship. Why so much traffic between Toril and Rock?"**

Fee-Ree is confident that we're close enough and sends the message. She's due to go to bed soon anyway. There's an answer back.

**"Ah! Welcome back. We'll have beacon active. Traffic is latest set of graduates! Joyous indeed. Will explain more on arrival. All is well."**

Gnog can't help but feel excited now, about being near home. The party talks about the strange melancholy of it; this is the adventure's end. But home is home.

At one point, Deni checks in with Taz. He's never been there. Is he nervous? It's not his home, it's ours. She tells him a story. "When I first went to live with my grandma, I think I was a little shit! It wasn't my home. I wanted to go back to *my* home." - she explains that she knew she *should* be grateful; but that took time.

Taz thinks, from Gnog, that home is where your family is. And Toril is new - vast oceans, forests, and more. He can't wait. Deni is probably more worried than Taz; she's worried about prejudice; how he'll be treated. He thinks it's just a question of letting people know you. He's aware of the risks.

Later, Fee-Ree calls to people - "get up on deck". We see a distant pearl. It grows fast. Soon, we slow. We're close to the moon. Taz remarks that, at a distance, it looks quite like Ravnica's. As for the planet, he says, "Surely, all that blue isn't *water* is it?! I mean, I know you said there were big seas - but that's most of the planet!"

It's a question of angles and a major ocean. A big continent on the right we recognise as Feyrun. It's on the dark side - the chronometer showing nearly midnight. Mert's beacon isn't showing on the orrery so we think it must be visual. There's a lot of sea, but Taz and Gnog quickly fetch a chart and Gnog and Deni show Taz where they thought that Sehanine's Bow had sailed, so we have a rough idea of where in the sea to look. Taz navigation 26, figures out where we should head for and lets Fee-Ree know details.

Gnog tries without the spyglass first - too small a field of view - and just tries using his 'eagle eyes' first. Perception roll is very high - 28 total. There's a cloud that looks too bright. Lit up from underneath! And he knows the tower tends to shroud itself in cloud. He describes it to Fee-Ree and she can see it enough, once she knows what she's looking for, through the "ship's eyes" to get closer. As we clear below the clouds, we see the very bright beacon. Not subtle!

As the ship comes in, Taz gets distracted by just the size of the ocean and more and more details revealed as we fly lower; sees waves glittering in moonlight and the vague traces of a distant shoreline - the kingdom of Am" says Gnog, who goes on to describe what would be in daylight sparkling azure seas, distant yellow-golden haze of desert, a green line of trees before it, a faint jagged outline North for the great mountains there.

As we get close, the cloud gets thicker and thicker - until it dissipates as we pass through the illusion. "Woah!" says Taz. "That's quite impressive, even by Ravnican standards!" - 2000ft tall after all.

There are people waving flags down below. Fee-Ree does her best to pilot in - she's never done any fine landings before and this is a tricky hovering tunnel descent. She's not sure as we get in what the hand-waving signs mean; Taz insight 28; he reckons they're pointing at a particular platform - getting a bit impatient in fact! - so Fee-Ree heads in the indicated direction. A small platform jutting out a bit about 3 "layers" down from the top. "It would've been so much easier to land on the bigger one above it!" complains Fee-Ree; Taz says, "you can do it!" - bardic inspiration. Fee-Ree's landing is beautiful, in practice.

Gnog hastily gets changed below into his clothes of mending. Arxcis helps Deni with bed rolls. We pack up quickly; the ship should be secure, but we take our stuff as usual.

### 11:30pm

We disembark. Tarto is here! He greets us. "Hello! Well met!" says Gnog. "Thanks for giving us a landing position." "No problem. I heard from Mert that you were coming in."

He talks about the heavy traffic we encountered, giving us more background on how the graduates head out on their first commission. About 9 ships had left in rapid succession; would've been 10 but one of the graduates decided at the last minute that they didn't want to pursue the lifestyle.

Gnog introduces Taz. "Ah! I've only met a few of your kind before. Maybe, six. Everyone of you is different." Taz is delighted to hear that there are others of his kind! Tarto says he even served with one on a galleon, before being at the academy. The **Hyperion Magestic**. "He was the most skilled tracker and ranger I've ever met."

Tarto tells us that Mert's awake in his quarters. He'll take us there. We have a bit of paperwork first; they can store the ship for now.

We reach his quarters. Tarto's shift is done but we're around in the morning, we can catch up a bit more. "It falls to me, I guess, to say - welcome home; and to Tazythus, welcome to Toril."

Mert welcomes us. Has a bit of wine left - opened the bottle too early!

**Mert gives Taz a teleportation circle note, so he can come here directly. Fee-Ree can use her wilder teleport to get here if need be.**

We catch up briefly with Mert. Miken doing well; Infinite Consortium probably looking for Etherium rights, so keep an eye out. Xaryxian threats - hopefully distant. Others looking into it. He isn't too interested in stuff (Taz insight 27) outside of things that relate to the school and student safety.

Our ship will be stored. If we need it, it'll be brought out of storage. Takes a few hours to get it sorted and onto a launch pad. Means we don't have fast access - no good for fleeing Toril! - but we'd use magic if we were in a hurry. It can't be flown to Waterdeep because that particular city's protocols require spelljamming helms to be brought in via the harbour, and our ship can't float.

The party is OK with staying overnight, but keen to return too; and the tavern is probably still serving, or at least tidying up. We decide to portal today.

Fee-Ree knows the teleportation circle for the Harpers, and Taz has the spell. She gives him the runes. They have a room where they prefer people to cast Teleport. We bid farewell to Mert; we draw the runes; Taz casts the spell...



## Day 67, Waterdeep (Riglan 104, met Riglan on 122)

...harper safe house, a little after midnight.

Surreal. Empty as usual, so Gnog walks to the door opens it - running sounds from the stairs, of course, as the teleportation alarm must've gone off. The butler arrives - the same one we've seen before every time! - he reminds us to **use Sending next time**, please, for a warning!

We're told "She's not here I'm afraid" - but he'll sort us a carriage; too late for Drays. We head down to the lobby. Then the housekeeper arrives offering cookies and tea! But the carriage is coming; just time for cookies.

A knock at the door; a carriage; we give the address. "5 silvers, please!" so Gnog hands him 6, but gets change! It's only 5. No tips, it seems.

We clatter over mostly empty streets. Taz's eyes are wide, looking out. "Those floating lights are cool!" - the driftglobes are out, of course.

We're dropped off outside Golaith Drinks. Lights and music!

Gnog tells Arxcis and Taz - this is the tavern, that's the cart... Deni's already at the door. "Barry! Gerri!" she calls. Music stops. Yelling out! Clash and clatter, pattering of feet. She's just beyond the foyer into the tavern, us close behind now, as the two halflings arrive.

More people arrive. Charlin. "Oh my goodness! Deni! You've grown! Welcome back - oh, everyone! Welcome back" - and he turns into the room, "They're back everyone!" - some confused patrons until they see "the goliath".

A swarthy-looking handsome human on stage was playing music. He capitalises on the moment and starts an improv - on the goliath being back, "he's got a big sack" - which accidentally sets the tone and it gets cruder from there but the crowd are into it.

Gnog perception only 12, he's a bit overwhelmed. It's busy. Deni hasn't waited; she's already got the chest of preserving off Fee-Ree and pulled out two ringbreads, one each for Barry and Gerri. It's quite large for a halfling and they're predictably excited! Some people invite her to a table. We follow along. A slightly unfriendly looking person; dressed like a barbarian, huh. Tall - 6.5ft - woman, long blackish-brown hair, rough skin. Uthgardt tribe. A massive battleaxe nearby, eyeing up. Gnog says "Uthgardt! This tavern is honoured by your presence. What brings you this way?" "...Oh!" a stuttering reply. She slams a hand down! "Friends! I protect him. I protect Edgin..." - Charlin says that this is the person playing. The barbarian is Holga, his friend, companion, bodyguard maybe? She notices Gnog's axe. She must be able to read it - "You are a giantslayer?" "I have been yes" "Then you have my respect!" "It is mutual. A drink?" "Yes!"

We drink and talk. Gnog learns that Cedric is over with Vajra, but most likely asleep by now. We'll catch up tomorrow. After half an hour so the bard winds down - it's late. One last rousing song. Much applause. "If you'd like to show your appreciation in tangible means, here is my hat!" - Gnog throws in a gold. We got a custom song, after all. He starts his after-work drink with Holga as we chat; Taz insight 21, we pick up that Edgin is quite charming; he recognises Edgin employing the same techniques that *he* uses. Edgin is a true bard. We answer honestly as best we can, but can't get too far into it! The whole offworld thing - too complex; not right for Toril.

He's a dreamer, actually. Seeking fame and fortune. Eventually - "Shall we, Lady Kilgor?!" "Ha!" she says, "*Lady* Kilgor? You kill *me*. Our last night was a success!". Just before they leave, Gnog shouts, "Catch!" to Edgin, and throws a vial which he catches deftly. "If you're needing a bit of liquid heroism, that potion should help!" "Thank you! Magical? Yes. Well. This has made the last week really the best week ever! If ever you're in need of a sharp wit, a sharp mind - a mastermind, even I could say - look me up! **Edgin Darvis**." He winks, turns and off they go.

As they leave, we hear him asking "where do you think Simon is?" "Probably got his nose buried in a book somewhere."

We reckon Fee-Ree and Arxcis will fit in the tower room. Deni and Gnog can fit in theirs as usual, with Taz on a couch. Druana fusses over fresh linens but Fee-Ree insists on doing that, since we've dropped in unannounced.

Fee-Ree calls Taz into the tower room. "You really must have a look!" - she draws the curtains and we all crowd in, to look over Waterdeep at night. The moonlight glistens on the harbour sea. The castle rises up. Driftglobes hover, moving slowly, a floating carpet of light. Dock ward lights; the odd bit of activity on a street here and there.

After a while, Taz goes, "This is a nice town. I can see why you like it."

Fee-Ree and Arxcis are standing close, arms around waists. Arxcis kisses Fee-Ree. "Thank you - everyone. Thank you for coming to get me and bringing me here into your family. This is a beautiful, beautiful place. I can see so much warmth here - so much love throughout every stone in this building. What a wonderful place to be."

Deni lets down her guard, just for a moment. Leans against Gnog, Taz leaning against the other side. Gnog says, "Right then. Let's leave these two in peace, shall we?" so we head down to our floor and get into the room. Druana is changing *our* sheets! Deni helps. When it's quiet, Gnog says, "Feeling OK, Tumble?"

"Yeah - well - I - thanks for letting us come back tonight. I know it's late. I just... I missed home so much, I just really wanted to get here and see everyone."

She flops down onto the bed. "Good night. See you in the morning..." - she mutters, already falling asleep.

### 9am

Gnog is awoken by someone yelling in his face. "GNOG! GNOG! GNOG! OH MY GOD YOU'RE BACK!" - before he even opens his eyes - he shouts "CEDRIC!" - opens his eyes, Cedric's on the bed *right* in his face. Gnog grabs him into a hug, then stands up and whirls him around. "Cedric! It's *so* good to see you. I missed you so much. And there's someone I'd like you to meet..."

Taz and Cedric meet. A shake of hands. "We can be like brothers! I'm the one made of wood and you're the one made of metal."

As Gnog watches this taking place, he shakes part of a strange feeling of detachment he'd had since teleporting back to the Harpers chapter house. Last night seemed surreal; he didn't emotionally connect, somehow. Just felt like he was walking through a dream, rather than real life. Cedric's strange wake-up call, and seeing him and Taz meet, helps; but there is still distance there. Very strange...

...but the feelings for Cedric aren't. Although thoughts of Gibo and Bebe come rushing back at the same time, all those feelings of love and protection for Cedric are just as strong as ever.

Deni's obviously awake so we get dressed and head downstairs. Druana has already started breakfast ("thank you!") and Arxcis and Fee-Ree have emerged too. He remarks that Waterdeep is quite grand, now that he's seen it from the tower in daylight. "A bit more hilly than I imagined".

We talk about things to do - check in with Vajra and thank her; make sure it's OK to fly and if so, take a leap up above Mt Waterdeep; but first Gnog wants to head (since it's not far) to Helm's Hall. He has some explaining to do!

We take our time through South Ward, taking in Caravan Court as a bit of a diversion - the sugar sheep place is there - Gnog to Taz and Arxcis, "Oh, you *have* to try these!" - then eventually cut across The Way Of The Dragon, to get to Helm's Hall. In we go! Sunlight streaming in (as it always seems to do in daytime) through stained glass windows. Quite busy, in its usual quiet way. We're met by an attendant cleric. He's not sure about our enquiries - it's his 3rd day! - and fetches an older priest, who recognises us.

We donate 10pp to each of the Hall and the orphanage, with the older priest treating it as a bequest. "Who should I say this is from?" A head-scratcher; The Goliath Drinks maybe, but Deni points out that doesn't really match Taz. We decide, then, upon the rather abstract "The Silver Navigator". All five of us are its crew, after all.

We're taken back to the orphanage. The kids are in class. The "headmaster" (as she is introduced) says that really she's just one of two teachers here. Storytellers are always welcome. Can we teach? Arxcis says he can teach maths; Taz can teach music; Gnog can teach fighting! Deni can teach stealth, acrobatics, elegance; Fee-Ree can teach about magic. We spend an hour or two with the kids telling stories and become "known" so we can take future classes and give contact details in case they ever do want to actually do something structured rather than ad hoc.

Next, we get to the room of remembrance. Garren's stuff is here, still. We have a 15 minute slot.Gnog takes a deep breath and says to the party, "OK, this is awkward..." Taz religion: 20!+7. 27. Immediately feels familiar with the room for some reason; he's intimately acquainted with the items here. A presence is comforting and known. It's nothing frightening or scary. He feels the presence in his - well, not mind; his being. He simply says, "Ah, I see. This was Garren..." - corrects himself - "...This *is* Garren." At that, we all feel the warmth of that connection too. Arxcis doesn't, inevitably, since we have the personal history with Garren that he lacks.

Gnog says, "Arxcis, I hope you can reach out and feel maybe some of the spirit here. Don't feel bad if not - you never knew him, of course." "It is a peaceful place, at least; it feels hallowed. It has a gravity and a calm about it."

Gnog takes a deep breath. He says, "I know you were watching over us on Ravnica and Amonkhet. Thank you. I know I made some mistakes and did things of which you might not have approved; but I hope my actions - *our* actions - overall made up for it."

*Taz* speaks - he feels compelled to. "I have been with you the whole time. I'm here still and I've never left. Like all things, the form changes but the spirit remains."

Gnog jumps at this and looks at Taz... Taz speaks differently; "...I see. It was a conscience. I'm my own person, but he was guiding, still."

Gnog speaks of the strange new God. The new "orphanage" (flop house) on the Rock. And of Ajani. There's no acrimony in the feeling of response; it's one of nobody being able to see the future, it will play out as it must; he's proud of what we have achieved and that his gifts have been useful. "You've been in a big journey. Made some very big decisions. Those are never easy. I had to make some big decisions when I left you, so perhaps you might forgive me a bit more. I know you carried a resentment in your heart at my departure when the wound was fresh, but I see you have had to put yourself in the same situation. You perhaps understand more."

Gnog goes bright red. "I didn't know anyone saw that. I kept that hidden." Deni laughs. "No you didn't!" "Oh. Well. It was true, I guess I did a bit, but not a lot; it was a struggle, I think, figuring out - were we deceived, of course no, and we were used, of course, again no, and other things. But in the end - I don't know if I understand more, or just accept this now. Either way, I have acquired, I must say, a faith. Not in the gods I have seen, because I saw them. Not in life after death, because I have walked amongst spirits. It is in the After. Something beyond. And I hope that when my time comes, we might meet again."

Garren answers: "In my time amongst the mortals, including the years I have lost, despite everything that I witnessed and experienced - misfortune, misunderstandings, misery; the downtrodden and injustice - what became ever-clearer to me was that there's an innate goodness in people. There is much that can stand in its way, but at their heart, people are good. And they deserve a chance. They deserve a chance to fulfil that goodness - free from interference, free from control. I think that's why I have always seen the goodness and want to nurture it in the young before they have a chance to be led astray. You would think that what had happened to my earthly, adopted parents could have shaken that belief, but what is important to remember is that *they* believed. They believed enough to rescue all of the children that they looked after. And the outcome of that far outweighs the tragedy of their death. It doesn't make it any less tragic, but it gives it meaning and legacy. It makes them eternal."

Gnog says, "I know *exactly* what you mean."

"What will you do now. Do you know? Have you thought?"

We don't really know. The future is unknown - and that is a good thing. We'll take it as it comes and mould it if we can. Our private time is almost up. We bid farewell; we will of course be back.

We head out, thanking people as we go, assuring them of our return, and outside Gnog checks with Arxcis, "I hope that wasn't too much..." - he's fine. Our attention turns to Vajra. Cedric tells us she's not at the tower. It's her day off! She was at home when he last saw her. We figure we'll try the house - if she's not there, never mind. We get nearby, but the apartment is high up. Gnog tries the sending stone to Vajra - "Hi, we are in town. If you are not busy and would like company, we could meet for a picnic or something!"

A reply. "Welcome back! Quite busy with developments abroad. Perhaps briefly at Harpers, before we sail?" - oh wow. So that sounds imminent and we head to the Chapterhouse quickly. We knock, some fluster as usual, eventually we're ushered to the dining room. There are already lots of people there - it's a squeeze in there now. Turns out we're gatecrashing a meeting, oops! Vajra says they're nearly done. Some wrapping up happens and eventually people filter out. It sounds pretty serious - "May the wind be at your back and the shadows keep you safe", she says before they go. Vajra is packing a travelling chest and is in her travelling robes. One other senior Harper is here, though we don't know directly but we've seen him around before. High up in the organisation. 

We learn of trouble in Neverwinter. Neverember has disappeared and there is jostling for control in his stead. A character called **Forge Fitzwilliam** is looking prominent in that, seemingly rising out of nowhere. Seems linked to a new Viceroy, she's called **Sofina** who is a red wizard from Thay! That connection is the main reason Vajra is heading that way. There's a bard, ex-Harper who lost their wife then daughter - lost as in *missing*, not dead! - becoming disillusioned, who Varja knows is connected to Forge Fitzwilliam and has had dealings with him. She asks, if we're staying in Waterdeep, if we can track him down - he's believed to be here - but is a tricky character. Find out what he knows. Gnog agrees - hardly likely to refuse, after all.

She ruffles Cerdic's leaves, as if hair. "I'll see you when I'm back, little one." She heads to the door. Sighs at the guard. "Do we *have* to travel by boat?!" "Yes... I'm afraid so Blackstaff... It would be inappropriate for us to simply, 'show up', because it's part of a diplomatic mission." "Harumph. Fine. I might - I apologise ahead of time - possibly speed it along magically. We don't have much time to spare."

The head into a carriage and ride away.

Gnog sighs and sinks heavily into a dining chair. Looks ruefully at his party. "Eh, by the gods. Sorry. Have I dragged us into something without so much as a *day* of rest?!" "Not necessarily. We've not been given a mission, just been asked to keep an eye out for someone... And it was very 'in passing'" says Deni.

At least we should talk to the harpers to get more info on this character, as suggested by Vajra. The older high-up harper is still here, so Gnog introduces himself, and he says he saw us at the front lines in the war. He's **Poco**. On the 'errant' Harper, they're pretty sure he won't be able to be brought back into the fold; he's too angry and alienated now. They're annoyed with themselves for not having him watched because when people leave, they take knowledge of secrets and ways with them. But the Harpers are not the Zhentarim, so they don't "take care" (ahem!) of loose ends.

The housekeeper has fond memories of this guy and his daughter from a few years ago, when they were members. She talks about them. The father was handsome; the daughter, **Kira**, very beautiful and a sweet child. They travelled with an adopted mother, she thinks from the Northern Tribes maybe? Very tall, brusque, rough skin, black hair, beautiful though. The housekeeper asks why; we say that he's gone missing and we wanted to find him. "Oh. I heard he'd been in prison for a while, but I don't keep up with the news too much... What's Edgin got himself into this time? It's been years. Last I saw him and Kira, Kira was - a beautiful 16 year old I think - she must be 20 now."

Penny drops.

We talk about meeting Edgin and Holga at the tavern "last night" (well, early this morning, technically) and that he was interested in places of treasure. We'd assumed they were a hand-to-mouth kind of group that were looking for a break, but Poco corrects us. Edgin's actually linked to thefts of a few high-profile artefacts, one of which he was caught for and imprisoned. We couldn't get him out, not that he would have accepted our help anyway. Something you should know about him - our records show that he is the pragmatic sort. He's only idealistic to a point. He's not motivated by any organisations; he looks out for his own, with a personal moral compass. He might not be motivated by money, either. I can't say. Within our organisation he was a capable spy, but he always had ambitions for more - to be one of the masterminds; the one pulling the strings behind the scenes. He's quite smart."

We'll follow up with the Mage's Guild, as their companion Simon might have registered there and we want to go anyway; and we'll check with Charlin to see if he had any contact details.

Via lunch in The Market - to show Taz & Arxcis - Taz loves it, lots here. He even says, "Oh. Waterdeep is not a backward place at all! It's not a 'provincial fishing village'..." - Gnog is *sure* he never said that?!" "...there's lots to buy here and some of it's quite good!" We have a weird one most of us end up with grilled eel on sticks, in some kind of smokey sauce, while Arxcis has a skewer of grilled frogs! Deni dives off and comes back with a couple of sticks with caramelised crabapples as a desert.

We queue at the mage's guild, awkwardly... Eventually we register Taz, who gets a licence number. 150gp! FML. Annual renewal for "only" 50gp. We learn that we *can* cast magic now, like Fly, without prior permission. We also get a form (in duplicate) to request access to the registration records to try and find "Simon". We're kind of eye-rolling about the slow processes but Taz is unfamiliar with it all and is finding it fascinating! So he fills in the forms and we take them to an office we were told to go to (64B). Simon... 31 records. Male, because we heard "he". 12 hits. We make a guess at "within the last month". 2 records. **Simon Josnod**, a half-giant, "a storm sorcerer"; or **Simon Aumar**, claims to be a descendant of **Elminster** - one of the most famous mages in all of Feyrun. "That's the one". "Surely not?" asks the attendant. "This one's a child - relatively - a half-elf... Early forties. Huh. This can't be right? Says here he's a sorcerer without any control..." "Wild magic?" "Maybe. We've had multiple reports... Well... This person had to be registered against their will, after releasing a flock of burning birds from some other plane. Caused quite a commotion down in the Dock Ward!"

40s half-elf, would look early 20s human. Dark skin, curly black short hair. Quite short. There's an address too - "Location: The Goliath Drinks, Winter's Lane".

So we leave, heads spinning a bit!

Randomly, Taz gets excited and tries his sending stone. "I am on a world called Toril. It is nice. Are you OK?" - DM fiat, 150 million km range is OK, but technically another plane; D20->5; there is no response for a while and Taz is looking disappointing, but then, "Good morning! We are fine. We are with the kids and it's a good day here. We love you very much. I miss you!" - it sounds strange, a bit high pitched and quiet, but it works.

We figure we'll try the tavern, to see if Charlin knows anything else. We catch a Dray for that and it's late lunch service, but quietening down. He's looking worried though - tonight is the Festival Of The Flowing Water and likely to be busy, but their barding act cancelled at the last minute and now they're short of one. We suggest Edgin, ulterior motive declared; Charlin met him by accident, in an altercation he saw at Caravan Court and thinks he might be staying nearby. Only a few inns nearby, maybe 4. We can ask around. Also, we can help tonight! Taz can play his two dulcimers and cast illusions; Fee-Ree is asked to help in the kitchen; Arxcis with books; Gnog can be a bouncer; Deni offers to help behind the bar.

It turns out there are 5 barrels of ale we need to fetch too. We know the supplier, near Caravan Court - kill 2 birds with one stone. We head out and get to Caravan Court and start asking around after Edgin. We start in the market, to see if traders might have seen them and be able to direct us to them. Taz with BFS persuasion a whopping 32! Talking to a pottery salesperson - "You don't mean *them*?" - Gnog turns and sees three people. Running! One is clearly Holga, one holding a lute. They're being chased. We shout "thanks!" and pursue. The City Watch are after them.

Gnog ath 20 in chase. Taz gets close enough and tries Hold Person at L4 on all 3. Wisdom saves all round, DC 20.

* Edgin is held
* Holga succeeds (20 total, matching DC)
* Simon is held

Gnog continues after Holga while Taz and the others approach. Gnog shouts after Holga, "wait, your friends are held!" - and to his surprise, she rages! She brings out axes. Gnog tries to de-escalate; dex save fail, so he's hit as she flails around; Gnog athl 15, trying to grab the weapon; she matches. We lock grip. Gnog says, "This is Waterdeep. I know your rage. I know your fire. You can't fight here. Put it in a place for later. Save the rage for later. I'm here to help" - persuasion nat 20! + 8. Good timing. She lets go of the weapon. Gnog places it carefully on the ground.

Taz is persuading the City Watch to stand down. Another decent roll, 29 total. The Watch say they were called to a disturbance. The White Horse tab was not paid! They ran out! Gnog tries to deceive - "I'm so sorry, we're the bodyguards, I have the money!" - and we pay in full on their behalf (27gp! Quite the bar tab). The barman is unhappy - "You're not welcome back!" but paid.

So, an accord is struck. They have nowhere to stay now, but Fee-Ree offers bed rolls on the main floor after we close. Gnog says we'll put food and drinks on the house. We fetch the barrels and everyone rolls them back. At the tavern, Edgin negotiates not having free food & drink but instead being paid for the gig with the "usual" 20% festival markup. Charlin agrees.

Preparations continue, everyone pitching in. Mid-way, Gnog gives an excited Barry and Gerri their giant Rock Of Bral lollipops!

At one point, a chair is knocked over with Edgin's bag on it; Gnog (perception with luck point, 18) spots a scroll falling out, opening onto a map. Lots of white painted on it. Looks like multiple levels of a building; "**Revel's End**" written on there. Deni asks what it is; the other party dodge the question. Gnog remembers the name vaguely (history check adv. only 13 total) - a location Up North. North of the Spine, in fact.

Later, as things are starting to warm up, Gnog's been plying Edgin with ale. He's acting very merry - Gnog insight a high 22 - his mug's not really decreasing. Holga's drinking happily. Gnog says to him "so I said there was thing I wanted to talk about."

He talks about the Harpers and trouble "up north" at which Edgin says they're headed that way - far North, not Neverwinter - beyond the Spine, Icewind Dale. "Ah, Revel's End" says Gnog, brief discussion about the map & Edgin tries Suggestion to make Gnog forget! Wisdom saving 19, he makes it. Taz says, "THAT was not friendly. Please do not try that again or I will retaliate."

Some frank speaking. They're not disclosing information because they don't want to embroil us in stuff. On Fitzwilliam - he's kind of their patron. Do they trust him? Not sure. Do they need him? Yes. He claims "whatever we did wrong, we set right; and the person it hurt more than anyone else on this world is me." "Your daughter?" "I don't want to get into it." Fair enough.

The conversation is closed down. We'll try and get the harpers off their tail - not that they care. They'll be out of here tomorrow; happy enough to play the gig - a bit of money and levity.

The sun is beginning to set. Do we have time to get to Mt Waterdeep? Maybe we fly? Fee-Ree says "no, let's go now!" and teleports us!

We're on the peak. The sun is visible well above the sea from up here but the mountain shades the tavern - now quite a distance away. Taz has never seen a sunset over an ocean. Gnog says, "Yeah, this is one of the better things in life. Have a fly up, get a good look around. Forests, mountains, rivers, plains - it's quite spectacular."

The Sword Mountains, lit orange now in the low sun, cast shadows far over the moors and plains behind. The High Forest is visible long distant. Waterdeep lies below, tiny specks of light floating out in the ocean as ships light lanterns. He spends a while taking it in then comes down to sit with us.

As the sun finally sets, people stand up and toast "to everflowing waters" - we do the same. People begin to descend, excited as "the festival has begun!" - we can see a procession walking around the Market & starting to head down into the Way Of The Dragon. There are lots of people with blue lanterns which have soft tissue covers over them that lifts in the breeze as people walk, so in total it looks like a river floating towards Dock Ward.

Fee-Ree helps us all fly back to the Goliath Drinks. Lets us see the procession. It's not too busy yet; at this stage in the festival, everyone is outside. Taz shows the people inside via Minor Illusion what he saw. Outside, at Dock Ward, lanterns are set into the sea to float off; then people hit the taverns!

Edgin's repertoire kicks off. It's all water and rivers. Very relevant. The crowd love it. We take up our various roles, as agreed with Charlin. It's a good atmosphere and nice to be part of "staff". Good money is made! There's a meal in the evening; they join us to break bread, have some stew but at 12:30am, say they want to head away - take advantage of the quietness of night after the festival to head away. The bid us all good luck. Us likewise. "We might see you again soon". "I hope everything goes well. Sincerely." "Yes. I need to find my daughter." - and at the threshold of the door - **"I understand that you've had run-ins with the Red Wizards of Thay. You know you can never trust one. You never should."** - and he leaves.



## Day 68, Wildpsace (Riglan 105, met Riglan on 122)

In the morning, after breakfast, we figure we'll update the harpers, sort some stuff at Balthors and head to Duskhollow.

Balthors is on the way so we go first. One reason is for Taz and Arxcis to see what's there, but also for a few healing potions and for Taz to get or commission a Planeshift focus for Waterdeep/Toril. They can't make one here, but suggest we go to a metalsmith. We'd bring precious metal and get them to fashion it.

Since we're headed West, we pass on all we know to Poco at the harpers - and encourage them that maybe, Edgin knows what he's doing on this one and they should focus their efforts on the politics at hand in Neverwinter! Poco says, "Well, our notes disagree, but I'll take it under advisement and pass it on! His heart is in the right place, but he can make bad decisions."

We know dwarves from the War that helped with the weapons for Skyreach - we head over and they say they can get all that sorted. 250gp for them to source the material and make the 'tuning fork', so that with labour, it's all worth 250gp. Apparently that's enough for the spell to work. It'll take a couple of days.

We say our goodbyes at the tavern. We know we'll back soon. Druana offers us some food to pack up, for their mother - we thank her; Fee-Ree and Druana pack the chest. Druana even makes a big bag of winter drapes and blankets for her mother. Much hugging and "back soon"-ing. It wasn't going to be tearful but Barry and Gerri are hugging Cedric and asking if he wants to stay for winter. He's had enough of the city - he's told the city just gets wet and muddy. Besides, it'll be colder Up North and he knows that he needs that - and he misses the kids. He knows their time as children is short. The time with Vajra shows on him - wisdom indeed.

### Just after midday

Where exactly, wonders Fee-Ree? We try for Duskhollow - we'll get Cedric set up in the cottage then head to Deni's grandmother straight away. No wild magic surges and - pop! There we go. We're *directly* inside the cottage, as Cedric still collects silver things and had a shiny spoon from the kitchen. "Ah! Ah! We're home!" he says excited, but then, "THE PLACE SMELLS TERRIBLE!" - opens all doors and windows. Noticeably colder and more crisp; yellow-orange-red leaves in deciduous trees amongst the evergreens. Bright outside, just past midday. A light dusting of snow on the hills, blue skies. Beautiful.

Cedric is suddenly distressed. He's seen that plants outside are not doing so well. He's suddenly very busy with trying to rescue them - it seems things were too dry. He's happy for us to leave him to it while we figure out what's next. He gives us a list of things we need to get for him when we're back.

We know it's a day of travel (8 hours or so) to granny's, but we can speed it up with horses. Deni tries at the stables and there are plenty of horses, even a warhorse for Gnog - so we hire four horses (Taz will sit with Deni) and that'll save us some time. It'll be dark once we get there, most likely, but we'll head off immediately.

The town wasn't busy, but wasn't quiet either. It was OK. We of course stop by at Greenside Tavern. Deni has some personal things there, to let them know how much they mean to her. She gives them a bottle of Dwarven Brandy from Waterdeep as a gift. They say that trade is good; they've even had a small extension, to build some rooms onto the tavern and turn it into a small inn.

Off we go.

Groups of merchants on the road, now and again; fortune seekers too, probably headed via Duskhollow to the Long Road down South. A caravan of Hobgoblins, half-orcs and so-on reminds Gnog of his obligations with the Hobgoblins on the road further south, from our days long ago in the caravan. Deni remarks - "How the world has changed! We'd not normally ever have seen goblinfolk and orcfolk travelling openly. Maybe things are improving?"

As the sun stars to set, Deni persuades us to gallop. Deni is nervous, Gnog can tell, as we gallop. She's in the lead and Taz struggles to keep the lights ahead. It gets to dusk. Taz playfully moves dancing lights around over us as we travel, but it's not long until we reach Grandma's - 6:30pm or so.

### 6:30pm

Deni relaxes as we get near - a thin wisp of smoke just visible against the deep blue dusk sky. We turn a bend and can now see lights from a distant farmhouse. Deni is visibly relieved but, if anything, pushes us even faster!

As she arrives, she dismounts and runs to the door (leaving Taz to figure out how to dismount!)

"Grandma! Grandma! It's Deni!"

A soft voice from inside - "Deni?" - and a can thunking on a wooden floor. The door unlocks and opens. Grandma is framed by the door, backlit by a fire inside the house. A huge hug and kiss from Deni. "Oh. Come in! You brought all your friends as always... I didn't know you were coming..." - she worries about food, but we say we come bearing gifts. She talks about having a good harvest; she'd had two men come by and worried that they might be a problem, but in fact were good - probably running from the law, but happy for shelter! - and helped with harvest in the end, stayed a while.

And so it goes on. She's an almost unbearably sweet lady!

Deni enjoys bringing out the various gifts and things we've bought. She's particularly appreciative of the sheets from Goliath Drinks - "I've not had new sheets in, I don't know, maybe 40 years?!"

We while away some hours telling stories, but by around 9pm, grandma falls fast asleep in her rocking chair. Gnog helps Deni move her to the bed, with new blankets. We could camp on the floor, but it's a bit cramped and Taz has the idea of bringing up the fortress. We could do it closer the main road to avoid crushing crops and provide some ad hoc security. We leave a note for granny to say we're just outside and give it a try.

Taz with BFS Arcana 26. He sees various inscriptions and glyphs; he runs through various combinations as command words in Amonkhet. It transpires that "**Baphomet**" is the word - the fortress suddenly starts doing a strange unfolding, over and over, getting bigger and bigger until it's some 20ft by 20ft wide and 30ft high.

Taz says "Open" in Common, hoping that'll work - and it does. It seems he can command it any way he wants. We head inside. It's just a stone fortress. Strange; it feels like a real building. 3 floors too, with battlements. There's even a hearth and table down here! There's more room for bed rolls on the 2nd level so we set up there. Taz asks if it's OK if he spends the night on the roof. He's curious about the stars and the night here in Toril. We climbs all the way up.

We set up to sleep; we don't even need to set up watch, because the cottage is warded - Deni ritual-cast Alarm on that - and the keep can't be opened by anyone else. Cool!



## Day 69, Waterdeep (Riglan 106, met Riglan on 122)

Taz wakes up first, hearing the sound of people talking. Confused. "It's not on the map at all... I don't understand..." - he looks down from the roof. A wagon and four people, looking lost. He runs down, waking up the party on the way past, and heads outside, "Hello there! My name is Taz" (Deni close behind). Four very surprised humans, who've never seen an Autognome before. Taz does his best to explain that they *are* (based on the map they point out) where they think they are and the keep is magical and temporary. In the end, they head on (towards Duskhollow).

We all pack up and exit. Taz speaks the command word; it folds back into a small cube, which he puts in his pocket.

Grandma is already up. She'd seen the keep and Taz shows her the small version. We spend the morning, until maybe 11am, and all is well. We say goodbye and promise to visit rather more often now that things are looking to be a bit more settled for a while and the roads are safer. We pass on the "hello" from Greenside Tavern too.

Eventually we depart and make for the woods, since at the edge, we can use fey paths to fast-travel to The Sacred Woods druid grove. We get there about 2pm and it's only about 15-30 minutes on the Fey paths - Gnog finding them immediately, with our little 'fey path guide', given to Gnog by Sanstra, so long ago now - to pop out into the circle. Gnog's telling Taz all about it. Gnog's turn to be excited, as Deni was for Granny.

After a thicket, we push through and it's there - all Fey colours. Different skies, everything colourful and bright. Taz has never seen this kind of magic before. Gnog says, "This is a kind of toned down, easier version of a full Fey wild - it's the sort of place we thought Rerdian might one day want to stay, if he and Zorbu ever want to leave the Rock." "It's quite colourful!" "It is. And time here is roughly the same, but time in the full Fey Wild passes differently and they'd have longer together. Now, let's see if Eliastra is around."

Gnog perception 19. Before he sees anything, he hears a sound of grunting and pushing and things slamming on the ground. Strange. Looking ahead - people carrying, or dragging rather, large sleds. One turns - it's Destin, Adwyn's son. "Oh hi!" shouts Gnog - "Need a hand?" "Sure! Wait. Where did you just come from?" "Fey paths." "Ah. Eliastra is gonna want to know you're here..." "Yes, we were on our way to see her!" "Help me get this over to the great hall." We do. Huge preparations underway! "What's the festival?" asks Gnog. "Well it's pretty rare that we'd have an equinox in the same night as a full moon. So as you can imagine, for were-druids, kind of a big deal..."

We learn that Janvair has been spending time at The Veil "spending time trying to corral a crazy old wizard that way..." "Stellarin?!" "Yes! How did you know? Both of us had to subdue him." "Oh. Was he OK...? I mean we weren't exactly friends, but..." "Nah. He's completely lost his marbles! You'd better talk to Janvair for more but go to Eliastra first or she'll never forgive you. She's at her house, making food."

Deni notices Gnog is nervous. With her insight, observing more keenly, she realises that he's been hiding a lot of emotions and they're now only just barely being kept under the surface.

We get to the cottage and there's a hive of activity! Lots of people around. It doesn't take long before Gnog sees Eliastra - she sniffs the air (ouch!) - then turns quickly. "Gnog! Gnog, I recognise that smell anywhere!" "...But I had a shower..." "I know your scent." "Oh. It's nearly full moon. I get it."

Eli notices a change in Gnog. That he's not really followed a Druidic path; that his wild nature is understood and changed. It's true, through circumstances; but this overwhelms Gnog. The emotions bubble up. He and Eli walk to a private area and Gnog barely gets through a sentence before losing his shit and crying in her arms for a while.

A heart-to-heart and more understanding.

- Gnog does not have a monopoly on sorrow so had been bottling it all up
- Eliastra points out (again!) that life is all about cycles, coming and going
- She enjoys their relationship for as long as he does; his life may be shorter, but they will both enjoy their time together just as much
- Taz is hard for the druids (metal) but Eli realises, as Gnog talks, that he's truly alive
- She worries that Gnog is so focused on the setting sun, that he doesn't feel its warmth - he doesn't metaphorically smell the cooking or just enjoy sitting by the fire
- He responds that it is it true he had that issue once, but now sees more road between now and that sun than he ever had - he's incredibly lucky, to have the circle and his friends
- He does feel though that the power and abilities he has are rare in the world and it's not so much that he feels a responsibility, more that he *wants* to use those to help as long as he can
- There is still overthinking and emotional burden, but time helps heal that

In part because of this conversation, we are all invited to the festivities tonight. Not just to watch, but to be *part* of it. To run wild, to embrace our wild selves. Fey paths will be magically rerouted so all routes lead back to the Circle, since things will get pretty crazy and it's important to make sure that nobody outside of The Sacred Woods could be hurt.

Gnog thinks of Boboremos; Gnog thinks of Blagothkus. Yes. **Be wild, goliath!** Let the emotions go.

When returning to the party, Gnog thanks them for giving him and Eli some space. He explains the brief heart-to-heart and we pitch in, helping as best we can. More about what will take place tonight is explained.

As the sun starts to set, Janvair says, "There's going to be things that happen tonight that, if ever you feel unsafe, you can always head in this direction, here - " (and points to a tree) "- there is a line around it that we cannot pass. If you feel unsafe, you can always retreat up here. But nothing will be held against you! It is a night to be free. To unleash the beast. To confront the beast; your past; your fears; and everything you're afraid of about yourself and what might become. A cathartic release and acknowledgement that there is much we cannot control. All we can do is channel it. After the ceremonies, all is forgiven. We start afresh."

Drums are playing. We eat, then start to drink - more and more and more drink. One by one, people leave. We hear roars. It seems being drunk enough helps! We head out and witness it. Dancing, wild. Many are in werebear form, some full bear, some part way. It's pretty mad - too wild to be controllable. It does feel a bit like the Rakdos in their reverie. The spirit of the moment, unbound. Destin is a werewolf, running, chasing, frothing at the mouth. Before Eli turns - she says to Deni, seeing unease, "Remember. If you feel at all threatened, head to the tree. Head *up* the tree if you wish. Just look after yourself. Allow yourself to explore things you might have been afraid to let out. Let go."

Taz mostly observes. He's not seen anything like this. Some howl at the moon. Some wrestle/fight - we learn that they're vying for the same woman. Gnog sees the party uneasy. He says, "OK, so why don't we drop you off at the tree, get you climbed up, you can all see what's going on, and then I'll I think jump back in?" - but Fee-Ree though is unloading a bit. She's had a lot to drink. She's explaining a lot to Arxcis, eyes wild, as she talks about how lost she felt. "I didn't choose to go!" he says. "I don't blame you at all. I'm not saying you left. I'm saying I thought I *killed* you and I had to live with that, for years. Do you know what that does to someone?" - all the emotion is pouring out. Deni has also been drinking though and just starts talking to Gnog. Unloading too. "What is the future? Are you - you're going to leave. At one point you said you were going to leave? I expected that. I've always known that people will leave at some point. I don't have anyone. I have grandma and I think she's not long for this world. I don't have anyone else. I don't have family. I don't have anyone who is bound to me by blood. I don't have a lover! I don't have a teacher. I don't belong to a school or guild... I'm not anybody's responsibility. Ultimately people are going to leave me. There are always connections and ties that are more important. Arxcis and Fee-Ree aren't going to stick around. Arxcis won't want Fee-Ree out putting her life at risk"... And so-on. All the anxieties.

Gnog responds after a while... "But I risk your life. The choices I make get us in trouble. They got the goblins killed, and Aurelio, and perhaps Ral and all those soldiers that I asked the Boros to put up there. And more besides, in the army..." but Deni interrupts. "That's nonsense. That's bullshit. So not what happened. We gave them a fighting chance. It's not even our war or our world. We were just there to help, this story isn't even from our perspective. They were the heroes of their world. They fought to save everyone and everything they loved. They sacrificed it all because that is their home."

And so it goes on. The to and fro. Pretty much drunken arguing, but for all the right reasons. We care too much, but Deni is terrified she'll be left alone.

Really it's Deni realising she will be flying the nest. She needs to get out and experience the world - everything. But doesn't want to leave us; be alone; she'll be homesick. We can't come on that journey.

We're deep in convo - dex save, nat 1! Total 5. Two huge werebears crash into us. Deni dodges, Gnog gets squished and rages to break free. Melee nonsense for a while. By the time he's done, fully raged and running around, Deni a bit bruised and bloodied having got involved too - she says "fuck it, I'm going up the tree!" As she runs, she calls, "Where's Arxcis? Where's Fee-Ree? *Where's Taz?*" Gnog looks and sees Arxcis and Fee-Ree not around; he shouts, "probably up the tree!" and then looks around and sees, on the edge of the roof of the hall, Taz. He is sat calmly, with an array of cups of different drinks, tasting them and enjoying the view! Gnog rage-flies up, asks Taz if it's time to go? "Yeah, why not" he laughs, "but you go first, I'll fly up in a minute".

Gnog rage-flies back to the safety tree. It's a bit of a tree-house - quite a climb, some 150ft in total. A short while later (via Fly through the dulcimer) Taz joins us, bringing all his taster drinks with him!

Taz shares out the drinks. We sit, relaxed. Deni is back to herself, having unloaded and fought. Fee-Ree and Arxcis are happy, issues aired and deeper understanding forged. We are at peace; future anxieties remain, but we feel settled now, confident that we'll meet the challenges ahead.

**We have *everything* we could possibly want or need.** 

We can see over much of the canopy as well as witness the ongoing, curious madness below. And - **there it is...** The blueish-white reflection of the Spine, and the mountain where Gnog first teleported in, in the moonlight. He points it out. "There! That's where it really started. **That's where I found you all.**"

We each feel presence around us. Even Arxcis. It's like a favourite, warm blanket. "Hi Garren, welcome to the madhouse!" says Gnog.

We while away the hours, drinking and chatting, one by one falling asleep as the chaos continues below - the snarling, racing, chasing, drum playing, the meeting hall hearth roaring. Eventually Taz and Gnog are just holding awake. Gnog says to Taz, "I think I'll sleep too. If you're able, watch for the sunrise over the forest. It's beautiful..." - he tails off, falling asleep.



## Day 70, Waterdeep (Riglan 107, met Riglan on 122)

Taz stays awake. The sun peeks over the trees, orange and red fire on the mountains. With the others still asleep, Taz quietly says, "**The future is ours. *All* of us.**"

**The End**



## Epilogue

* For the most part, their future is their own. We do not predict it for them.
* At least we know that they get the Waterdeep "tuning fork". Helm's Hall is a regular place for storytelling and teaching. Granny is visited more often.
* Gnog and Ajani have a curious relationship that's always at distance, but they put in the work, and it grows into something beautiful.
* Amonkhet is returned to in due course. Taz makes sure he gets a Planeshift focus made at Amonkhet so he can return more easily. Orisa's book is returned just a few months, it transpires before her passing; but she has lived to see Naktamun's restoration well underway, with a future assured.
* Ravnica is an occasional haunt. They do well. It will always be a strange place. Levinia and Quintorious are still together, living in a young Verdani.
* Holiays at Xonthal's Tower are always nice and it's good to catch up with Yarrow.



# Unsorted additional notes

**Perhaps this new god might one day search the space around Amonkhet for a once-small child, accompanied by a construct, looking for her parents.**

* We must return to the Veil and seek out the old seller in the woods that used to speak to Cedric, if he still lives. I think he might like to know where people ended up and what happened.
* Return to Amonkhet one day. And Ravnica, for that matter. Get "tuning forks."
* what of the Mercane, the Xarixyans, the teddy bear and the drifting ship?
* Maybe we can find out if the Mercane called Vocath is due to ever come to the Rock Of Bral and arrange to be on the Rock at the same time. We've tried to arrange a meeting, and have to wait to be contacted about it.
* **VERY IMPORTANT** - the mystery of the girl in the asteroid belt. We were tasked with going back to Amonkhet, after all; but many months or years had passed since that last journal entry.
* **What of the Hobgoblins on the Long Road out of Triboar - the Urshani. Gnog vowed to one day see if things could be done to right some wrongs there**. Gnog wonders who, since it's on his mind, he might speak to so that the ball might start rolling on the politics for the Hobgoblins. Red Larch or Triboar would probably be needed, or speak to the Hobgoblins directly; what would reparations look like?
* Arrin "Giantslayer" Ogolakanu - Gnog should visit Una-Dankor at the appointed time.

"Attention. This is a Ravnican Civil Defence announcement. A planetary emergency has developed. All civilians *must* proceed immediately *but calmly* to underground shelters. Boros Legion and Selesnyan Conclave members are available in all districts to assist. Within shelter locations, *Kraul Warriors* will direct you onward to safe locations in the undercity. Please respect our Kraul hosts and follow their directions carefully. This is *not* a drill."

## The thickening plot
### Debts accrued

* Serafina may call upon Gnog. If she does, he must respond, no matter the cost.
* We might owe the Dimir, though they say that they've called it even.
* Gnog has offered his services to Boboremos, if called upon.

### Xaryxians and Toril

* Who was responsible for directing Miken to try and compromise the Toril Academy and will they try again?
* Xaryxians are destroying planets and there's a beam of energy that goes back to their home world when it happens; what is that and why have they been doing it
* There is a gap about 7 years ago where no survivors were found from such an attack, and this seems curiously coincidental with our own "event" 7 years ago

### Vi

* Vi is from Eberron but has a home on Sigil
* She has set up The Fixers, essentially adventurers in Precinct Six, Krenko's mob are in with her and know about other planes

### Ruby Palace

* The only person we know of who ever found it was a demigod from forbidden world Theros, which is unique because people's faith causes gods to manifest; the demigod believed Bahamut was evil serpent Sardior, went in search via the Ruby Palace, realised his error and we think subsequently returned. Theros may need visiting but is out of bounds to travellers.
* Eberron has closed its borders. Vi is originally from that world. So is, of course, Morgan. They plane-travel by crashing through planes rather than necessarily sailing the Astral Sea.
* Krynn is the only world with a creation myth related to the shattered gem dragon Sardior, whom some believe the Ruby palace is constructed to bring back.

## Currency

Of our big set of currency:

* 80gp is in Universal
* 100gp is Ravnican common currency (not church currency) - that is, 100 zinos / gold Azorius coins
  -> NOW 25 Orzhov platinum, 19 zinos, 1 silver, 10 zibs, 10 Boros coins (50 zino equiv)

* 1 zib -> 1 copper
* 1 silver / silver Azorius coin -> 25 coppers
* 1 electrum / electrum Azorius coin -> 50 coppers
* 1 zino -> 100 coppers

## Purchases

* We need suits for air (tho we have the air collars)
* We need a good book about the Astral Sea creatures and hazards

## Silver Navigator crew rotation
