# Gnog: Part 11
## Day 31 (Riglan 68 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Monday (7 day week)
### 1000XP - but usual donation to Taz, so 500XP each and 2500XP to Taz

We awake late in the library in P5, D10, after the extraordinary experience with the Gruul. It's about 10:30-11am. Over brunch (very posh) at the library canteen, we share various musings and thoughts. Deni points out that Boboremos managed to avoid telling us specifically what his message was; perhaps he leaves that to chaos!

We remember that we have some things to return to the Boros. We elect to take the items direct to Sunhome. Deni reminds Gnog about the library book; but the Orzhov have been waiting longer and are first in the queue, so with regret, we take it with us.

It takes a while to get to Sunhome. We approach the gate as usual, walking in and noting that security is high. More guards. The statue is clean and the lawn repaired. Angels patrol as usual, but in greater numbers. Fee-Ree is visibly nervous. Deni holds her hand. Gnog says, "I'll never send you into danger like that again. It was careless." Fee-Ree says, "It's OK; it's just changed what I think about angels". Gnog spends a moment watching them go past, then says, "Huh. Yeah. They're not hot after all, don't know why I thought that..." - he sees them somehow differently now.

Deni tries to figure out from the map where we should go. We don't want to just return these; we want an "in". She suggests going **straight into Sunhome**. Sure... We've had bunch already, so why not? She turns to Taz - "Taz, you need to back us up on this - we might need some charm and support..." - at this, Taz casts Nondetection on Deni. If she needs to go sneaking off, the precogs won't be able to see her. He has Guidance or Protection from Evil & Good in the back pocket, and thinks of some inspiring melodies! Then he thinks for a moment, says "You too!" and does the same to both Fee-Ree and Gnog, blowing all his L3 spells and good deal of diamond dust, but now, **the party - except for the "construct" - are invisible to sensors and scrying**.

We head in. It's a citadel; many angels, inhabiting many levels, flying in and out. The doors are 20ft high to a beautiful, tall entranceway, all straight lines and squared-off edges. Directly in front is a row of vertically-hung banners with the Boros insignia. Light floods in through Art Deco style stained glass, colouring the inside of the space. It has that pre-Bahuaus, German turn-of-century early concrete feel. Straight lines and severity, but at once somehow decorative.

There's a central raised area - a circular help desk, more or less - above it are flipping-over signs, magically driven we assume, that change periodically to show various things-going-on. A huge clock with several faces shows the time in all directions. Patrols everywhere. Deni looks at Taz, then marches up to the desk and says "Hi! Who do we speak to about these?" she produces the sun blade hilt and Sword Of The Paruns on the desk (but not the bracelet charm). The person at the desk is understandably surprised. Deni plainly states where they came from - loudly - including the name 'Azazael' - which causes a gasp and other people approach, curious. She gives Taz the eye again. Taz isn't great with body language so far, but he gets it.

Taz starts talking, saying things like, "yes, it was strange fight, we think Azazael might have been under the influence of some sort of curse... Who can we talk to?"

People go running off to find others to help. There is much confusion and general unsettled behaviour. We're given back the artefacts and taken to some random chairs. "Can I get you a glass of water or coffee or..." - and we say coffee, perhaps more to put this nervous person at ease. He heads off and returns surprisingly swiftly with a tray of actually rather good, hot coffee. We thank him. He asks if we were injured... Well, we're fine now... Deni, not one for tact, says, "Well, one of them did nearly kill me - I'm pretty sure I was dead" Taz corrects her to "unconscious and *almost* dead" and that just makes the poor guy gets really nervous again. At this Taz says, "Please, it is fine, it was not your fault, and we're not even sure if it was even Azazael's fault."

He's let off the hook as people are coming back, and Gnog starts blowing furiously on his coffee to try and cool it as clearly remaining drinking time is short... The human and minotaur guards reach us, the other nervous man in tow and invite us to follow them upstairs. We are warned that things might take some time. That's fine. We're told we can bring the coffee!

We reach a bubble lift that rises up a possibly decorative left-right central column, which is up against the back wall of the space we're in. There are three columns for lifts; we're in the middle. It rises up through the ceiling space; offices opening onto internal balconies with wide lightwells in the middle; then we rise further, as the exterior walls step inwards (the central building narrower now). The floor at this point is covered in gardens and planters, as if to give the illusion of having reappeared at ground level in a new building. We continue up. Once again, the building eventually narrows - the other two bubble lifts stop before this section. Here, the floor is mosaic set into marble. We start to see the walls towards the roofline arching in. The lift finally stops, on a raised platform on the second floor of this top section. We exit and are brought to a hall on the left, which seems to lead to a large office full of desks (open plan). Gnog has a sudden moment of self consciousness - he didn't even undress last night, just fell into bed. At least he looks - and smells - like Gruul, if that's useful...!

We are brought through the open office - gaining a fair few stares along the way - to some kind of meeting room. The minotaur knocks and introduces us as the "people with information about Azazeal". On the door, is a word: "**Feather**". We aren't familiar with the term but assume in context that it is some sort of title of authority.

We take seats. "I am Feather", says the (female) angel in the room. Gnog asks for clarification - we are told it is a bit of both; a name and a title. "Feather" was the name of one of the important angels in the Boros history, and at this Taz says, "Ah yes! Of course! I read about this in the library just recently." "Well, yes, Feather is no longer with us. It's become kind of a title, but I've adopted the name because I continue her work."

It's interesting. She's an angel but has a sort of 1920s detective outfit. Taz has already started casting Minor Illusion to bring back a magical version of his prior 3-hour physically instantiated hat.

We tell the story. The sunblade is examined; she says, "**Ramasen**", she says. She takes the other sword - "Ah, yes, this is definitely Azazael's. Given to them by **Razia** herself." She now reveals a map hidden behind blackboards on the wall. Asks for the location; we can be quite specific; she puts a pin in there. Other pins are present. There seems to be a pattern. She says she was trying to predict where they might go and keep people out of their way. She points at a number of pins heading in the same direction, a long way, but our pin is distant from that; the goblins could not have easily pulled her from such a distance and besides, Feather tells us that Azazael would never normally bother with petty crimes. She seeks great injustice (in her eyes); great crimes. Why such random encounters, with such disproportionate acts of fury? We weren't the only ones randomly attacked as such - there are other examples.

Taz says, "there is more to this story, and it is why we are so concerned and why we came here..." - and Deni produces the bracelet, giving it to Taz - "...ah, and I wasn't sure if I could speak of it, but now I can." He explains about the curse and the vow, and that it should still be visible from magic traces remaining in the items.

Feather takes out a glass box and asks to keep the bracelet. We ask how we can trust her, given what we've experienced; she struggles to answer... And that struggle is the answer we need. She talks of the "Death Pact". Azazael is the most powerful so far to fall to it, but there are others before; they talk of being "shown the truth" and gained - she struggles for the words to explain a concept she can't really understand. "They claim to have gained free will, except free will appears to be the same for all of them."

She is confused; Death Pact angels are nothing to do with Rakdos. They've been found in the service of the Orzhov. We discuss that this is probably a ruse. The same has happened with other guilds. The hypothesised unseen third party of 70+ years ago. We believe it's still happening. We mention; we fouled precognition the moment we arrived. We're a wildcard. We're not trusted because even we don't know what we'll do - "Ah! Free will!" says Feather - that is our power. Be the chaos.

We are handed a strange card, made with a curious multicolour ink, thrown into a fire and pulled from the ashes. "For immediate attention to Lavisha." - "If you were to walk into the Hall of the Guild Pact, you'd be queueing for days. Go and see her. Open with your theory that there is another force at work, so she knows that you are allied to hers. As for interference from the Azorious - remember, it is not us Boros getting in your way! - ..." - she pulls out four Boros emblems that have insignias matching her office. "I'm making the four of you Customary Investigators of my office. This places you free of Azorious interference, so long as you're not openly flouting the law. This doesn't give you the ability to do *anything* you please, but it gives you some wriggle room."

We're given another item - a card - to take to Reclamations And Returns, saying it's all above board, to which we take the hilt and blade. "If you ever need to come and speak to me here, I don't suppose you have means of transport vertically?" "We can fly" "Ah, well, you can always come and see me by flying onto this balcony!" "OK then!"

We head out; get directions to Reclamations; head there, they take the card and items and we're given 4,500gp in return (!). Woah. That's very useful. The artefacts, after all, are technically priceless, but that'll do for us.

Given the late brunch, we skip lunch - it's some time after midday, probably even beyond 1pm - and head for the Chamber Of The Guildpact via the Transguild Promenade, accessed through Sunhome. Azorious guards once again remind us not to open-carry as we enter P1, so like last time, we stow everything. We follow the plaza as before; we are reminded how huge and monolithic the Orzhova church and Vizkopa bank here are.

Taz is on the lookout for a hat. P1 is too expensive and fancy. He tries to remember for when we're back in P4.

We realise as we get near to the chamber that the huge retaining wall and archways just at the edge of Plaza West, forming the junction to Plaza South, is actually a giant, squat building - with many others built alongside and even on top, but the archways from Plaza South are actually entrances; this is the Boros garrison building for this precinct.

We get to the circular walkway/courtyard that has the nine great supporting buttresses for the chamber; we'd thought ten at some point but, counting now, it's nine - they didn't know (or at least specifically acknowledge) the Dimir when this was built. We choose an entrance - there are many - and head in. There are various attendants and desks that filter the people coming in, but it seems that the main "ground floor" - the level we're on, anyway - is public space; a sort of educational museum, with plaques educating about the Guild Pact and a walk-around timeline including the nine, now ten, Paruns who were involved. In the centre, suspended floating inside a glass case, is displayed the shattered original Guild Pact.

* From the circular timeline, we see for the first time a picture of Nivm Izzet.
* The Sphinx Azor, of Azorious, was in fact the architect of the Guild Pact; it was *not* Nivm Izzet.
* The act of creation was from all nine paruns (plus a secret tenth built in from the start as a check & balance, that the others, at the time, didn't know of). This was meant to help people be unable to find a loophole in the balance of the nine guilds - because there were ten, so they'd never get the right answer.
* Now all ten are known, so this protection no longer exists.
* There's a picture of Rakdos, too. Large, threatening, muscular, but demonic; Gnog is definitely *not* in that!
* Razia (of the Boros) is depicted; she is the original angel that followed Rakdos to this plane, in order to oppose him.

We need to find Lavisha. It looks like administrative areas - the "business end" - are up on the next level, so we ascend. Many groups and many individuals appear to be in a large kind of holding/waiting area. Most stand but a few sit on bench seats around the edges. It's not a queue, but we can tell that they're waiting nonetheless. Various clerical assistants circulate; interestingly, most seem dressed in an Azorious style. It's our first up-close view of some Simic, performers aside. They're a varied bunch, thanks to their strange enhancements.

Some minotaurs draw attention - they're angry and loud, demanding to be seen. A matter of planet-wide security, great injustice, etc. etc. - eventually we find a cleric, show them our investigative badges and apologetically ask for an audience with Levisha if possible. It's of course disruptive and we try to be as nice about it as we can! We don't mind waiting if necessary... But anyway, the cleric heads off after asking us to wait a short while. It only takes about 5 minutes. She returns with a long tassel attached to a key and hands it to us; we're told to head to head up another level, turn left and go into room 73. We might have to wait a while!

We do as we're told. Up there is a corridor that looks like it probably wraps all around the building. We head left to 73; it's not far. The key works and we enter; the door latches shut again behind us, the key apparently always needed to open it. The room is about 30x20ft. There are some chairs, a low small table with some cups and hot water along with some leaves so Gnog sets to making some tea. There's a small outward-facing window in the middle of the wall. Time passes as we discuss within our group what we might say to Levisha.

Half an hour or so later, we hear a key in the lock. A human woman enters and asks what it's all about. We lead with our "unseen third party" theory, as instructed. Taz fills in details as he always does. Adv. persuasion arising, 28.

Levisha motions that we should be quiet. She goes to the door, checks the corridor, closes the door then closes the curtains; she then casts a spell we've never seen. It forms a tiny dome around us all which muffles sounds. At this Gnog says, "neat trick - oh - and the three of us are currently protected against scrying and divination, in case that matters." "That's helpful but there sensors all over the building that could hear me or your metal friend here."

She asks who we've spoken to about this.

* Feather
* Aurelio
* ...oh. That's all.

We talk about what we can. She asks to be told nothing she does not *need* to know.

* Niv Mizzet's staying-in-his-room and the disappearance of Jace are not linked
* Before Jace left he tried to invest in Levisha some of the innate power of the Guild Pact that he held; Levisha refused
* She's been trying to contact him, increasingly urgently. He's never been gone this long before

She notes that we have some key missing pieces of information, but she might be able to fill in gaps.

* When the guild pact broke, we know of the Azorious and Lord Szadek story. But there are many examples of that kind of story from the time. Every guild pushed beyond and became extreme versions of themselves, elbowing in on neighbouring territory.
* This went on for two *decades*. The world was starting to unravel; chaos and turmoil, rampant crime, but draconian systems put in place by lawmakers to try and contain it, ever-more extreme forms of justice for ever more extreme kinds of crime. Nothing seemed to balance it.
* There were other off-world entities who'd taken advantage of this turmoil to try and claim part of the plantary power and resources for themselves. **The Xaryxians tried to establish a secret embassy**.
* Nivm Izzet appealed to Jace to come back to Ravnica to help - but we ask, why Jace? He's one of the true enigmas to history, we're told; he has amnesia and remembers nothing beyond about 300 years ago. He only has fragments of memory of what happened in the first 100 years or so of that; but he's far older than that. The unique thing is that universe itself seems to have amnesia about him too. **There's no record of what he is or has done - yet it works both ways. If he remembers it, so do others; and vice versa.**
* So Nimv Izzet had been studying the Implicit Maze every since the Guild Pact was destroyed. It's something **built into the planetary laylines**. It held the promise of rebuilding the Guild Pact, which itself drew upon the connection of all elements of the planet - society, spirituality, its magical wave, its land, everything - to bind everything into the Pact agreement. A marvel of arcane architecture.
* Solving the Maze might allow this, so for the next 15 years, as Jace came and went, Nivm would involve him in very drawn-out plots to convince all of the Guilds to put forward a champion to solve the Maze. The promise was - whoever can solve the maze would be imbued with some of the authority held in the Guild Pact. Every guild sought that, of course!
* Be it fate, luck or circumstance, Nivm could not participate in the Maze himself. He had to send another representative from the Izzet. He also persuaded Jace to be an independent judge, or referee for the process. His lack of identity to the universe and his independence meant that all guilds agreed.
* The Maze almost ripped some of the best minds in the planet apart. It is a combination of a traditional physical maze and a mental challenge; understanding the physical connections of the laylines, but also solving conundrums of logic related to each of those physical connections. **Nobody solved it**. All guilds solved *part* of it though.
* Jace, as the moderator, persuaded each one to provide their solution - and that was the whole point; it required each guild to provide their own skills and provide their own tenth of the solution. Proof that the guilds need each other to survive. In so proving, this forced a second Guild Pact.
* None could agree how the power of that should be divided, however. Individually they voted for who they thought should have it. It was expected that they'd vote for themselves, but in a twist of fate, **every guild voted for Jace**. It was against his will; but also, we think, it was **not what Nivm Izzet had in mind**.

We flag the information on Xaryxians. Jace believes that they're the only society that could rival Ravnica or Eberron for technical advancement. And they're the only ones who are expansionist in nature.

We are warned that Nivm Izzet has a habit of rubbing people up the wrong way - because he really doesn't care. He has nothing to fear from anyone.

* Selesnyans represent nearly 20% of the entire population of Ravnica
* All the other guilds combined represent about 5%
* So only 1 out of every 4 people are aligned to any guild - much less than we thought

Lavisha theorises that perhaps most people find they're built from the cloth of multiple guilds. Only those who are very singular in purpose might find themselves drawn sufficiently closely to one guild to become part of it.

We ask if there's anything we can do to help make her life easier.

She points out that we can leave the planet. That's where Jace is. Somewhere else. **There may come a time - probably soon - when she might need to call in favour from us**. We point out that it wouldn't even be a favour. We're happy to help.

She drops the bubble - then immediately looks alarmed. "Oh no!" "What's happened?!" "Oh no, this is not good at all..." - she unlocks the door - "Please come with me and we'll talk on the way" and we hurry out. "My attendants just informed me - there's nothing I could've done in the 15 minutes we've talked - the **Obsidat have just placed Taysa Karlov under house arrest**." "That's unfortunate, we were hoping to speak to here, if you understand me - which is probably why she's been arrested." "This is going to make a right mess for us! Taysa was the only moderate voice left in the Orzhov and she was was pushing for... Look, I'm sorry, I have to go, I have to figure out how to undo this mess! This is going to have wide-ranging repercussions. There were very many guilds in negotiations with her..." and she hurries off with attendants in tow. As we get down to level 1, we see a whole new mob of people who've come in and clamour in petition. We slip past it all to ground level and hurry onto the plaza, where we see dozens of people heading toward the Chamber.

We have an address for the Orzhov we were meant to spend 5 days with. We head there directly. It's about 2:30pm we think.

Taz tries to find the address: Investigation 14. He asks some people, persuasion 15. We find it's not far - behind the Orzhova; slightly south, behind the Vizkopa bank. Sort of in Plaza West. The address is a building marked, "**Seventh Karlov Estate**". There's a gatehouse with guards and a sort of chateau. There are many guards. More are arriving. Gnog and Taz approach a guard at the gatehouse, who of course is standoffish. We try to explain. Taz insight 18. These are low-level guards; they fetch a higher level guard; he considers the timing "opportune" and asks if we can come back at another time. We think they're actually not estate guards - they're part of the retinue that locked up Taysa.

Taz tries to persuade them. He explains that we are already a day or two late due to unavoidable delays, we recognise the timing is bad, but the court order was clear and we do feel that regardless of other unfortunate events, we should proceed as we were legally instructed. They ask if we owe them a debt. We answer "yes". Their attitude changes in our favour; Orzhov consider debts (usually involving the undead soul!) of particular importance.

We agree on condition of going to the gatehouse for sensor scrying to determine that we're not reporters or journalists - that is, they're checking that *we* don't have sensors. It takes a very long time - we have to empty the bags (yes, really, all of them!) - and are eventually, somewhat begrudgingly, allowed in. We're warned that it's a sensitive political situation. "Do not cause trouble for me!" says the Captain.

We head in. Different guards are inside. They're just watching and seem unsure what to do. It's quite beautiful; fountains, sculptures, beautiful gardens, mature trees in bloom. There are even some woodland animals, including a fawn. Gnog things of Precinct 6... Different planet, same old shit. Inequality seems to be a universal constant.

Only a handful of spirits, notes Taz. Unusual for Orzhov. There are 3 buildings, with one obviously larger main one which we approach. A door attendant, after we apologetically explain why we're here, asks us if we want to wait in the chapel or drawing room; the latter, given our non-aligned religious state. We're offered wine - Gnog accepts, purely to be polite of course.

The Advocist arrives - we recognise him from the courthouse. Gnog tries to explain why we're decided to visit now; we know Taysa from a particular reference and perspective - not what the Advocist might expect. We learn that she's under literal *house arrest* and this is *her estate* - the Advocist represents her, but this is her house. The Seventh Estate belongs to the *living* arm of the Karlov family. Realising this, we have some choices. Can we try to talk to her right now? That's not why we're here - it's supposed to be about the court order.

We try to be persuasive. Taz assists with Guidance and bardic inspiration. Gnog's rolls aren't great but thanks to a +7 modifier and a d4->3 on Guidance he gets 23. This softens up the Advocist enough to show us to Taysa. As we walk he explains more.

* This is the 7th estate. It belongs to Taysa. Her father has retired and no longer lives here, but is still "somewhat alive" (LOL). He hasn't been told about this; he's not entirely lucid and probably doesn't know that **his ancestors have moved against his daughter**.
* The Obsidat ordered the house arrest (so, "tell me more about the Obsidat"). The Obsidat is ruled by the 5 oldest and most powerful members of the Ghost Council, including the oldest of Taysa's known ancestors.
* Several generations of Karlovs sit on the greater Ghost Council and hold positions of office within both the Bank and Orzhova.
* They are the most powerful of the Orzhov families - some might argue, but if measured by pure wealth the Karlov family as a whole is by far the most powerful. **They own about 15% of the wealth of this planet**.
* Taysa was, until a few hours ago, the special envoy of the Orzhov Syndicate. She represented the Orzhov in all guild matters involving people outside. We ask about the Implicit Maze. She was alive when the Implicit Maze happened, but didn't take part in that.

We note as we move through the building that it's very old - the architectural style is quite different from newer Ravnican buildings. It's very ostentatious; we figure that this was probably considered the height of style once upon a time! We pass through various rooms and wings, *many* paintings hung on various corridors. We eventually get to "The gallery", a long room that runs along the entire outside of one face of the "H" shaped chateau. It has floor-to-ceiling ~15ft high grand windows with curtains drawn back; the other wall is pretty much completely covered in artwork. We're asked to walk on the narrow carpet and not on the marble floor, which is polished to within an inch of its life! It's almost mirror-like in finish.

We reach the far end; all curtains are drawn here. **A woman - Taysa - stands studying a painting**. She turns to face us. Pale skin, dark eyes, sleek black hair, beautiful, young-looking woman - early to mid 30s max, but we know she must be much older - 40-50 years, if alive when there were the investigations of the Implicit Maze. She holds an ornate thin metal staff of sorts, that seems to be flattened in profile rather than cylindrical. There's a winding pattern effect at the top. Taz rolls well for Arcana - 16+3 -> 19; he recognises the item somehow; it is a **Staff Of The Magi**, something it seems is in his preloaded knowledge. It is an *extremely* powerful magic item that can only be attuned to by a pure magic caster.

Taz goes, "Wow! A Staff Of The Magi! You must be extremely powerful!"

Curiously, this seems to break some tension. Taysa even laughs a little, as if caught off guard. "Oh! Yes, I guess it is... But, as to power, well, that's relative. What can I do for you?"

We explain our Orzhov debt but do confess we wanted to see her for other reasons. She says it's good timing! She'd normally be too busy. She offers to take us somewhere less gloomy; we head to the greenhouse. We talk about the planes, the guild imbalance, the experiment at Nivix. She even asks if we've "spoken to Niv about that". Taz (insight 21) notices that she's not flinching at *any* of this. She not only knows all this but knows more. Gnog has that feeling too, but isn't as sure. Taz also notes that at a point when she mentioned Jace being a "plane walker", was from context an indication that she can do it too - walk from one plane to another. She really is *very* powerful.

We mention the Xaryxian planet destruction and the "missing planet" 7 years ago. The IPB (it *is* the Inter Planar Beacon) fired around then; chance or attack or defence? She knows something of this and will explain later. We continue and the conversation goes back and forth; in the end we change topic; it's a lot of information and much is supposition.

To try and do something else without having to go back to the stresses of the main house, Taysa spends time telling Gnog about some of the plants she has in the greenhouse and garden. They're Ravnican and Gnog won't know some of them. Taz is soaking up the information too. Gnog is fascinated. He has so much to tell Eliastra!

Gnog asks about her, her interests, the Orzhov in general; it's sort of smalltalk but there is purpose. Her thinking is high level - an affectation of her privilege, though she is unaware - the mundane things of life are of no worry to her. She thinks about grand schemes. The wider world of politics. She's a deep, considered thinker and does seem caring, but she's detached, which is perhaps inevitable. Gnog is reminded somewhat of the dragon council. Intelligent and in a way caring, but somehow aloof; almost dispassionate. Gnog finds himself liking, and trusting this person, in a qualified way; if push came to shove, he wonders if she might put herself first.

**She's mentioned a few times that we should talk to Niv. She might be able to facilitate it.**

We're taken back to the house and up to its fourth level. It is a library. It confirms Taz's suspicions - a full wall of spell books, scrolls, charts, arcana diagrams and more. Taz realises now that she's definitely a wizard. He compliments her on the collection.

She looks for a particular book, related to the Niv's experiment - the IPB...

* It was designed to reach out
* It does pierce through into other planes
* It has been used before, not just 7 years ago; it has been refined over time
* On that particular time 7 years ago, Taysa was told - when Niv was placing orders from the Orzhov for the components he needed - he was trying to get hold of Jace
* Technically the IPB shouldn't be able to destroy anything; the power it draws is used to simply piece through the fabric of planes
* (Fee-Ree explains just what the side effects of that piercing can mean!)
* Taysa posits that if Niv is doing what she thinks, he's smarter than she thought...
* **Fee-Ree's husband was taken. The clues left were red crystal. This led us to trace a path to Ravnica.** _**That's what he wanted**_. The IPB was defensive - against some predicted future calamity on Ravnica.
* Niv Mizzet wanted Fee-Ree to realise her power, to become stronger, to travel here... **It has been his design all along.**
* Fee-Ree is asked if she is a plane walker... Fee-Ree can teleport? But she's been to multiple planes - Taysa says that she can therefore at least *try* to teleport, plane walk or even plane shift (though Fee-Ree doesn't have that spell)
* Taysa says she is pretty sure the husband is fine but we "just need to find out what Niv has done with him". Gnog can't quite believe what he heard!
* We mention the Ruby Palace; the crystals we've found are from people paid to harvest them from there. Fee-Ree's husband isn't necessarily there; she believes Niv left them as a breadcrumb to draw us here.
* Vi's departure is probably related to her fetching other people that are part of Niv's plan.

After a while she mentions that Niv plans ahead - he cheats! - he uses precogs. This reminds us about the precog visions; we mention the mass murderer one and also the more worrying one, where we were battling Jace. She's interested in the Dirk. Taz shows a minor illusion but it's not enough to identify; she asks if we get "the original", so it sounds like we need a visit with the precogs.

So why does she stay captive? She could leave at any time. "I need to be sure that there's nothing else that I can do to unravel this web that I've flown into and I can't leave Ravnica because this is my home. I'm needed here for the same reason that I think you've been brought here."

Speaking to Niv. How does that even happen? He's been locked in his tower for 3 years! Her magic can't reach him due to House Arrest. No token can be used to find him because he's very paranoid and would consider any such thing to be an obvious ruse. He values innovation and invention. To get his attention, do something new! Only thing is, everyone in the Izzet is trying too. Taz backs away a couple of paces and Gnog looks to him and says, "Tazythus, under *no circumstances* are you to become an Izzet experiment. Have no fear."

We remind her to chase the justification for Niv's current coolant & crystal orders. She thanks us and will do so; in the mean time we're welcome to take a room, food is on tap and so-on.

We go and find the Advocist. He confesses that they don't really have 5 days of things they can show us when it's literally five days of nothing else but this estate! He was going to show us Orzhova, Bank and more. He thinks we should perhaps visit these things, but using a letter of recommendation that means others will show us around. So, he writes us the letter.

We figure we'll try leaving the polite way first and, after thanking the Advocist, head out to try and find the same guards as before saying that we've got the letter we needed and would like to leave if that's OK. Taz persuasion 11+11->22, reminding them that this is why we went in and the lockdown was for people *already* there, etc. - fortunately they are convinced and we don't need to teleport. Fee-Ree is relieved as there was some anti-magic stopping Taysa from being able to "dial out" so it might have stopped us too.

It's quite late by now, after all we've done - around 6:30pm. 

Remembering our lapsed apartment in P4, we head back to see if it's been taken or if we can get the room back.

We've not been here before at dusk. It's very beautiful - big trees and all of the big buildings have soft, warm-sun like uplights to highlight the beauty. People are very well dressed; some carriages are around, also lit within, with a similar tone of light. There are some beautiful-looking restaurants, but expensive. Taz somewhat nervously asks if it's OK if we try to find a hat - he's got one in mind, the one he created before - and we are deputised investigators, after all. Nobody minds - we see the city changing in character at this time, we talk of how it reminds us of Waterdeep and Fee-Ree remarks how much she likes to watch the drift globes rising out of the City Of The Dead from the Goliath Drinks tower at this time of night. We're happy to explore more.

We start cutting across to P2. Street lights are illuminating. The weather is calm and clear, part from Nivix's omnipresent cloud cover. A few fluffy clouds are pink, catching the last of the light. Airships above become more noticeable, as they carry light beacons as well, conveying people towards the floating platform and - presumably - its famed restaurant. We pass by old cafés, well-dressed people drinking wine outside, chatting; very few children; the contrast from P4 is stark. There are some clubs with bouncers outside, with very well-dressed people going in. Taz simply says, "Orzhov" as we pass them. Azorious (not Boros) are never far away. It feels Waterdeep-safe, but affluent; privileged; not mixed.

We reach P2 and Paris-style apartments set above commercial units below. Taz asks Deni if she might help him find what looks like a solid quality, but not excessively expensive hat shop. They find two - "**The Guild Of Milliners**" and "**Chapeau And Chaps**". Fortunately, despite the late hour, both are open. Gnog is torn - he's a sucker for pun names and here are two of them. Taz on balance decides that the second pun is worse and therefore selects Chapeau And Chaps.

There are three bearded gnomes with big moustaches working inside. There's a human too, with a longer silver chin-beard. None of them are wearing hats. Taz approaches the strange group. "Ah! Oh! Oh my. Ah! Marvellous. Marvellous!" - they're clustered around looking him up and down. "What is your name?" "Tazythas!" "You are marvellous!" Taz explains he's an autognome created by artificer Zorbu Tablabu. "Can we touch you?!" "...yes!" and also draws their attention to the transparent panels showing his internal workings. The gnomes seem very excited. The human literally shoos them away - "Rude! Very rude! Leave the poor man alone!"

He introduces himself as "Monseur Chapeau". TL;DR, Taz minor-illusion's the hat he has in mind - "Something like this please!" - and there's a flurry of activity. We're taken to a room that's octagon shaped, mirrors on all sides with a round seat in the middle. Each of the 8 mirrors has a different frame, with a strange magical illusion on each to look like you're stood in a different setting - one is a garden, another is a Ravnican street, one's in a restaurant and so-on. A trolley is wheeled in, with 6 hats, similar to Taz's description.

They're trilby-style hats - 1920s detective-style. All have a small dimples on top, left and right; a stiff, wideish brim, and a sash / ribbon around the circumference just above the brim. One is grey, another brown, one is more felted, one is much more stiff - some kind of starched fine cotton; one is a finely-spun wool; and one is black. The textural contrast of the black catches his eye, as do the fabrics, but he was thinking more a dark grey. He asks if they can do the exact hat that way - yes! They can work to order, no problem - but they measure his head after thinking for a moment and measure his head; they show him a different hat, but in the colour they think he's after - it's the correct grey for sure - then head off into another room. Mysterious sounds of busy activity go on while the Mr Chapeau makes smalltalk. There is discussion of philosophies and futures.

After a while, the gnomes return. They have the exact hat! They warn Taz to adjust the hat only by the top, and never by the brim; pulling it will likely tear it free or turn into more of a bonnet than a hat (!). Taz is delighted. It's exactly what he wanted and he's very happy. He treats the gnomes to various illusions and dancing lights. The price is 6 zinos, which is we suppose a lot for a hat, but less than we feared and we pay without bartering. It comes with a hat box! Taz is given lots of information about hat care - cleaning, how it should be kept when not worn, what happens if it gets wet and suchlike.

In good spirits we depart. It's dark outside and we make a beeline for the apartment block in P4. Gnog side-eyes the Orzhov clubs, unsure what's inside, wondering if it's like Rakdos but without, y'know, the hideous evil at the core.

Gnog perception (with luck) 23. There's no problem in the direction we're heading, but there's quite a queue due to some kind of issue with people headed the other way - towards P1 or P2. Taz enquires about this with a random Azorious lawkeeper. Apparently there is "heightened risk of unrest", not something that usually happens. They want to maintain peace. Gnog adv. insight 17, they're checking people; not questioning them; certain kinds of people are being pulled aside - male humans with darker skin. Curious. We overhear "...doesn't match the description..." Taz tries to persuade this individual to open up a bit. 22. Remembers to show his investigator badge -> adv roll -> 27 this time. They are on the lookout for troublemakers believed to be in P4 who are believed to be going to do something bad in P1. We realise it's based on precognition - but we learn further that it's not mere troublemakers; it would be a very violent crime. We're even shown, on asking, a picture from the precog vision.

Taz thanks them, says it's good to know that they are using a balanced response and keeping P1 safe, we will keep our eyes open, etc...

Gnog perception 18. He notices (luck point, 11 and 11) - but fractionally too late - that the sheet has other words on it. Deni tugs at his leather skirt (!). Gnog steps back; Deni saw it.

...and Taz says we'll proceed through now to P4. As soon as we're in, we have a conversation! Deni saw a number of sheets but only the top one seemed to be the one they were acting on. It had drawings of dark-skinned, human males, quite hard to identify from the drawings alone; dressed quite generically; not face-on, so the precog vision was limited. Side-only. The writing that Deni managed to read said "Threat Level: Very High, Certainty: Very High" and underneath, "Successful detonation Monday night".

Seems unlikely that the house arrest happened and this is then foreseen.

This is a problem. We don't have much to go on; we lack the tools to find someone based on such a nebulous piece of information. Deni points out that it's pointless anyway; people can just use disguising magic. Angels aren't there - probably don't want to get involved with precognition. We're discussing this as we decide to head to Sunhome. As we get close, Fee-Ree casts Fly so that we can get straight up to Feather's office. She can fly us all up, but Taz might need to use his dulcimer to fly back down after. Taz suggests that Gnog carry him - Gnog and Taz's combined weight is still light enough and Gnog is easily strong enough. Taz is a little heavy for his height due to the metal, but not as heavy as all that really - it's not like he's a solid mass. There are plenty of air spaces and lighter components.

We are lucky! We arrive just as Feather is turning off the lights. "Feather! Really sorry...!" - she's unimpressed. We describe the situation. She things for a while before inviting us to walk with her as she thinks what we need is "on the way". She takes us outside Sunhome, to a garrison on the way to her home in P3. We know it well - it's Aurelio's location. She speaks to a couple of angels and the garrison head - asking to "borrow" one angel for just the one night. Lend a helping hand to Azorious border control, that kind of thing. There's some disagreement about overreach and suchlike. In the end, reluctantly - "just this once!" - they agree.

One of the minor angels is dispatched. We hope it's enough.

We thank Feather, and we know it's a long shot either way, but that's all we can do. Now, we finally get to P4 and the apartment block. The owner greets us enthusiastically - we're back sooner than expected apparently. We pay for two weeks - 8 zino. We can see he's a little nervous - we wonder if he's worried about whether or not it's clean, so someone else perhaps stayed in between - but it's fine (not that we'd have cared either way).

It's all sorted. Gnog is surprised at how relieved he feels. Deni is checking every part of the room. Gnog asks, "Find anything Dimir?!" She's just being careful and Gnog appreciates it. Eventually we head back out - we've not eaten. Deni seems a little paranoid; she's set up a thread trigger so she'll know if the room has been entered. Gnog quietly checks in with her; is she OK? She sort of is OK - but it reminds him of the time at Elturel, on the way to Boreskir Bridge, when she became similarly worried and paranoid. She does this.

Gnog says, "fuck it, I don't care if you squirm" and hoists her up onto his shoulders like last time. She's grown but he's strong and he says, "You'll get a much better view of everyone around us from up there."

Gnog is surprised again, too, by stepping onto the street and seeing the usual chaos. The chaos is comforting. It's familiar now. After a while, you recognise a flow. Patterns of sort. The patterns and schedules and routines that lie within and the true, pure chaos around that; random actions; we are more confident now that we'd see people "faking it". We go to our now-favourite food street and Deni is put back down to avoid tangling in the bunting! It's late - 8:30pm - just enough time to get some food. Again, there is familiarity and comfort here. We recognise people. Old conversations get picked back up. It feels friendly. Vendors remember us. We eat and drink well - a couple of Azorious silvers.

In the general conversations, adv. persuasion 27, we're told the usual chatter and gossip about recent changes while we've been away. News of the dying Verdani has spread. People have been brought from far and wide to pay respects. Gnog talks about how the generations of people having to move would've been traumatised, but they had community support. People paying respects would provide comfort. There's ribbing inevitably - "Ah, gone all Selesnyan have we?!" and so-on. There's a feeling amongst the Guildless here that joining a Guild - career aside - seems somehow unbalanced; to believe in something so completely.

Were we to take anything away from that conversation that evening, it would be a change of mood. There has been an awareness, a moment where people en masse got the sense that something is changing. It's not just individual pieces of gossip. It's part of something bigger; a tide is rising; they don't know what it means, but it's unsettling. "Common folk" are very sensitive to this since "when titans clash, it's always the common folk that get trampled underfoot" as one says. It had been a warm, good thing to meet up with these people again, but that unsettling reminder of the Draakhorn does hit us again in that moment, just as it did after the stampede, just before Vitu Ghazi was closed. 

Eventually we head back to the apartment and rest. This has been one of the busiest, yet shorter (due to the late start) days that we've ever had. We're (not quite literally) exhausted.



## Day 32 (Riglan 69 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Tuesday (7 day week)

We head down and check as usual to see if Aurelio has left any posters - nothing there. Coffee and ringbread, and a beeline for the Orzhova. There's no unusual checkpoint or other security activity as we get to the now-familiar P4->p1 junction so we figure, no bomb. Hopefully.

It's all pomp and circumstances - big impressive stairs, huge statues, that kind of thing. Interesting, there's usually a depiction of a deity in any cathedral we've seen - but not here, or not that we can identify. There's no angel imagery here either - that's all in Sunhome. It's not a theist church - very strange. The main gates are inlaid with gold, pearl, platinum and with an archway inset with sapphires. Within, many Orzhov priests in their white robes with black designs, various kinds of hats, but in all of their full-on religious trappings. Big censers hang from the ceiling; huge bowls of incense burn, filling the giant space with a faint smoke low down and deeper mist higher up; many indentured spirits flit around performing menial tasks. The stained glass windows here are truly immense. We enter initially a foyer of sorts with stairs leading in all directions before opening out into the main church.

We get to choose to stay on this floor, or descend lower. It's like a colosseum, descending maybe 30ft, rising maybe 40. We descend. Huge Orzhov insignia banners hang, but drape down in curves, pinned up off to the sides, decorative. A huge chandelier of candles, lit and dripping with trays beneath to catch the wax, is elevated high above - flying spirits are a must, here, clearly. Again, it's entirely a decorative aspect as the candles would shed more light and be easier to maintain if spread around at ground level.

We figure the hierarchy of importance is (with it being accidentally amusing) based on height of hat! There's soft chanting coming from somewhere; numerous marble bowls are dotted around, apparently for donations; there are many coins within. There are giant 20ft high beautiful tapestries - but not of angels or deities or suchlike; they depict now-deceased heads of various Orzhov families. An attendant approaches asking how he can help; we show him the letter. It's not just a "tell us about yourself", it's deeper than the usual tourism stuff!

The attendant frowns and has to go and fetch someone else. We are assigned to someone not dressed as a pontif; it's a lady that, well, is in just a kind of regular work-like uniform; it doesn't seem religious. She says she can show us a few things before handing us over to a minister who can show us the rest.

She explains about the religion and explains who the tapestries are about (the oligarchs). The religion is about people contributing to society, being good citizens. Their view is that what makes the world go around is trade. Goods, services, building healthy, stable communities; keeping the flow of the lifeblood of society circulating. The oligarchs have, she says, provided most of the companies and business that provide Ravnican society with pretty much anything they take for granted.

* She claims that the Orzhov fund the Izzet experiments. They fund monumental public infrastructure like the Blistercoils. They provide funding to excavate beneath the city for the Golgari undercity.
* The oligarchs utilise and maximise the wealth of the planet, directing it where they think it's needed.
* The Vizkopa Bank is where they look after the financial well-being of society. The Orzhova looks after the spiritual well-being. They provide them with an understanding and certainty - a contentment with the afterlife - it's real, you can see it around you.
* She takes us to a different section of Orzhova where we're met by a nun. This is the "Halls Of The Dead". Sister Rayna will show us.
* There's a whole lot more - catacombs below, huge galleries, floor after floor after floor of 2-3 storey high, bannistered galleries lit by ever-burning heatless candles, containing throngs of spirits.
* The Orzhov say they do look after and control - that is, have beholden to them - an entire society of recently-deceased spirits - ghosts - indentured spirits, working off their debts, thereafter ushered into the afterlife.
* They argue that after their mortal life, someone can go beyond, providing for their families and, in paying off debts, themselves; their families can come and see them and communicate, well beyond the span of their mortal life.

It turns out, there's a third part of this facility. We're led to the High Priesthood. We'd never have seen this without the Advocist's letter. We're taken up to the highest non-decorative section of the building - the *upper* cathedral. Of course it is beautiful and grand; huge rose windows, pillars of white and black-streaked marble; and after a time, we realise that the particular clarity and saturation of these stained glass windows is because **they're not glass. They're gems** - OK, so *that* is impressive. Donation bowls and boxes here are full of the Orzhov currency or gems and the like - much more valuable things than the mixed "common" currencies of the donation bowls and boxes down below. We learn:

* All members of the church, those who consider themselves pious, pay tithes.
* They're given amount of protection and an elevated status in return.
* Their spirits when they pass are taken elsewhere - not with the common spirits!
* The upper cathedral is only visited by those who seek the favour of the Orzhov - who ask for the oligarchs' prayers, trying to influence the outcome of their afterlives. It's almost a form of bribery in exchange for a better after-death experience.
* People can also ask for the Orzhov to influence living matters... And it all comes down to how much you pay most of the time. Only the wealthiest, therefore, bother to come up here.

From a Toril perspective, well, the whole thing is just fully corrupt. Pay for outcome, that's it. No religion; just money. But that's hot the society perspective *here* - it's a 10,000 year old society. And while the Orzhov might talk in religious terms - "divine prospect" and so-on, but there's no deity - they explain, if pressed, that their divine references point to the Orzhov council. They're essentially immortal; so how is that any different from a god? They make the wishes of the common population come true. We raise the issue of it not really being "common people", more "rich people"! They counter that it's relative, a question of scale, and point to people such as Boros soldiers that have a literal direct connection to their actual deities (angels) but which can only be influenced at a certain level of privilege or affluence.

Since they have so much control over trade, the use of the term "oligarchs" is actually reasonable and accurate.

Next, we get taken to Vizkopa Bank and handed over for another tour of sorts. Surprisingly, we are offered quarters here so we can stay and study longer, or whatever. Gnog soon realises that this is largely a reference to him being able to look less Gruul and more Waterdeep, so we pop up, clean up, and Gnog changes into his adventuring clothes; all weapons are stowed; and we come back down.

It's not church-like; it's just basically a huge, grand bank. Nobody much seems to wear church attire either, but Orzhov symbols are all over the place. In fact, if anything, the bank is even more extravagant - almost gaudy - e.g. marble pillars are coated in hammered gold. People who we think are staff wear long, fur-trimmed, flowing coats and hanging chains adorned with gems. There are many cashiers and private rooms and, of course, many levels.

We are shown deposit sections, private areas away from the main public area; valuers, money exchange, some kind of, well, pawn shop of sorts; an entire arm of the bank is called "loans". The middle section has a huge open space with a massive marble table, chandelier above and, around it, the same pictures on large tapestries as the Orzhova -celebrating the oligarchs. A book on the table extols the virtues of the oligarchs via the companies they've run and all the things they've given to the city/planet.

In terms of how things work:

* Security. We are taken into a zone of truth and asked if we have an intentions of stealing anything. After laughing out loud with a glance at Deni, Gnog answers 'no' - we all do, of course; truthfully, according to the magic.
* We are basically given a primer in banking - savings and loans, interest payments; we know some of these things from Waterdeep and this feels like an idealised sales pitch but this is a more formal and rigorous approach than we've heard before.
* We learn about collateral - "Grandfather Karlov" had devised ways for folks with "lesser means" to get things above their normal means, levelling society - they claim.

We hear again about how the Orzhov fund the Izzet; also the great civic works like the Transguild Promenade, along with the aqueducts, trains, airships and more. The topic of the Blistercoils arises too. Curiously, at this - and Zonot 7 - we're asked if we've seen "true wealth" before? We consider perhaps the hoard of Tiamat. Maybe just once. We're taken through various magically warded doors and corridors, to a vault; it's one of a network; and we're take onto a catwalk.

"This is the true engine of Ravnican society".

It's a *sea* of gold and, in a few places, platinum bars. A vast vault stretching in all directions, pillars holding up a huge high roof, catwalks above, just filled with the metal. As huge as Tiamat's hoard was, this dwarfs it. Gnog says, "It seems, in fact, we had *not* seen true wealth." "This is required for this world to run as smoothly as it does!" "But if there's this much gold and platinum, surely, it's not rare; and if it's not rare, it's not valuable..." "No, but we *set* the value. It's a fiction." "You choose how much to release?" "Yes. The entire economy is set upon this. Besides, the gold isn't for us - that's really for the Boros and Azorious. We don't deal in gold; *our* coins are platinum, which is much more rare. This is the 'reserve' - most isn't owned by people outside of the Orzhov." He admits that via the bank, they control almost all monetary wealth of Ravnica, *but* the Orzhov families themselves own more than *three quarters* of the planetary true wealth personally. There's a sense or pride, or is it hubris?, here.

"Nothing happens unless the Orzhov and Vizkopa bank says it happens. Nobody would dare challenge us; we could cut off this financial lifeline. Therein lies the balance required to keep society going."

The tour is more or less done. He signs off on our writ, but there's a third entry on there we hadn't really registered. Deni asks, "But what else is Orzhov?" "The economic engine of Orzhov itself. The bank stores and distributes wealth but it doesn't *generate* it..." - he checks a timepiece - "...time is probably about right. You probably want to dress in something a bit more fancy! You're about to witness the change that happens in Orzhov society when the sun sets."

We're given time to go up to the quarters. We find "fancy clothes" already there, and somehow, they fit; a bit tight on Gnog, which he likes (!). So we get into our finest, feeling a little silly, and head back to where we'd been told to meet. Many areas of the bank are closing, various (heavily decorated, inevitably) security doors and shutters lowered. We are taken to a carriage; we've seen these around but never been in them.

We are conveyed to a restaurant. The writ, we're told, shows us these things, but we have to pay our way. While we can observe, the spirit of the writ we think is better served by trying to participate, albeit doubtless an expensive purpose.

The destination is a particularly high-end part of P1; a beautiful, palace-like building, an Orzhovan high-society entertainment venue. Various bell-boys, servants, spirits and so-on. It's all dripping with wealth and while impressive it's super over-the-top. Interpersonal conversations that we overhear are smalltalk and seem to be a little fake - it's all about making the guests feel super important. We are shown to a main room; a string quartet plays (at least we like *that* bit - Taz claims they're very good). There are grand tables, overlooking a central area that seems to be some kind of indoor garden, complete with big trees. It's beautiful. Birds are present, but tethered to trees by long fine gold chains; some cages contain songbirds too. Gnog doesn't say anything but is *not* impressed.

We're asked if we have a reservation - we show the writ! The table *we* get isn't the one overlooking the garden area, inevitably, but does have a good view out of the window; we deduce that those central tables are all about visibility - to see and be seen - it's a social structure.

Wine is served and menus are placed. Things are priced in platinum (!) in 3 tiers.

* Entry level: 2 platinum pp. - 4 courses
* Next up: 15 platinum pp. - 9 courses
* Top: 25 platinum pp. - 15 courses

Gnog's keen to go all-in, but Deni and Fee-Ree give him a look. He asks if mid-tier is OK? No! Too many courses! 6pp it is. The wait staff don't blink at it. I mean, we're spending stupid money that they'd take weeks or months to earn. If they do look down on wealth, we'd be the least of the worries; and we're not here to impress anyone.

The more conspicuous tables, we note as the first course arrives, but in between are additional little bites of stuff or various drinks that seem to just be included (in addition to anything crazy we could get off drinks menus - we don't!) we note that the most loud and visible tables seem to not actually eat much of what they receive. It really is all about appearances.

Dinner is punctuated by strange things, such as an opera performance, a huge harp played on a hanging platform that descends from the ceiling and so-on. Over the course of tRake night the group (adv.perception Gnog, 22) we notice people sometimes leaving their tables, almost at random, heading up stairs to another level; or to the back; different locations - not to a bathroom, say. They tend to take things with them and often go in pairs or trios. Eventually, at some point, the wait staff ask if we want a "break to peruse the other rooms". We explain that we're very new and don't know what they are!

A "hostess" is fetched. She invites us to join her (and the wait staff have paused our course servings for the time). We're told to bring drinks. Up some stairs is a beautiful terrace with couches in the open area. Different music plays. We overhear strange discussions; one is an over-the-top philosophical discussion; two Orzhova priests seem to be doing rounds between groups; we see deals being done, hand shakes and furtive looks.

We keep going. We're taken down a level this time to a room in the back with tall glass windows overlooking an outside courtyard garden, illuminated with various soft lights. The entrance overlooks a casino. It's huge! Larger than the restaurant. Next, we're taken to "entertainers" - personal intimate kinds - they don't usually do "mixed groups!". Rakdos with money.

We're told there's one more thing to see on this particular day, we've picked a good day we're told, but not for another 45 minutes or so - in the mean time we're taken back to the table for another course. During it, Deni, with usual insight, sums it up - **not far off organised crime** from a Toril perspective... But this isn't Toril.

The host in due course returns, handing us four copies of a beautifully-bound catalogue of the "special collections" for tonight. An auction, then - various treasures - even, sadly, rare animals. Flipping through as a group, Taz's eyes go wide (adv. history 23) at a few items that are clearly off-world. **Not Ravnican**. It's even stated as a "rarity from another world".

We investigate further. What about our goblin artificer friends, who we are relying upon to make something interesting for the Izzet (not that they know it yet)? There's a very ornate astrolabe that purports to show an accurate model of Guildspace. Whether or not that that's of use to them, is not entirely clear. There's also a claimed very-old Mizzium containment field canister - 250 years old! - we signal interest to the hostess in both.

The hostess now takes us to a gallery to view the items. There are separate glass display cases for each. The astrolabe is beautiful, very ornate; it has a clockwork mechanism and it's easy to see how it would work. There's a lot of utility, perhaps practical, except we have a magical one in the Silver Navigator helm. On the canister, we stall for time while Taz spends a 1 min casting (not ritual) Identify (deception dirty 20) - nobody notices. It *is* magical. Clearly so. It's metal of the canister itself is *made* of Mizzium. Ah! It's a containment field made of Mizzium, not a containment field *for* Mizzium. We don't know what it is meant to contain, though. Despite evident age, the magic is very strong - abjuration (a protective magic). At the heart of the canister, dead centre, is conjuration of some kind - something related to different planes, or realities, perhaps? **This is very, very interesting to us**. Visually, it's quite steampunk.

Nonchalantly (!) we enquire about the process for the presumed-auction. The hostess becomes far more engaged at this - we're not just browsing after all, clearly - we're given details of how it works; and TL;DR we're assigned a bidder on our behalf to ensure protocol is followed. We're told we can continue to take dinner but our table will be moved to an auction room. We agree and proceed.

So, we end up on a table overlooking an auction floor; all food and drink is fetched and located here. Our bidder arrives. Eventually things commence. It's very quiet and civilised, with a musical interlude every ten items or so.

Gnog and Fee-Ree finally have a heart to heart, at this strange moment. In the end, we are at consensus - we are motivated more than all to meet and confront Niv Mizzet. He needs to answer for what he's done. Gnog is choked up. He holds Fee-Ree's hand. He holds Deni's hand. Taz puts his hand on top! Gnog only has the three. "We've been through a lot. But we've gained a lot. Many friends. A ship. A tavern. Wealth, status even if don't want it - " "- memories", interjects Deni - "yes, of Garren - and many more. And I doubt Niv had antyhign to do with the dragon cult, that'd been brewing for centuries, but either way, we helped save our own world. Arxis is out there. *We'll confront Niv. We'll find Arxis. We'll ave this stupid planet, somehow, because it seems we must. And I think that perhaps, unfortunately, whatever the cost, we're going to need cylinder*".

**Gnog notices Taz is glowing from within, like the time he was casting numerous illusions during our reconnection at the apartment a few days ago. It worries Gnog; it could be an overheat, or a fault. He needs to check with Taz later.**

There's mead with deserts, and tea. Is Niv organising dinner in Fee-Ree's favour?! Then our bidder leans in - it's time. Our lot is up. Internal estimates place the value estimate at 50-60 platinum. It could go much higher if others are interested. Opening bid is high already - 40pp, increments of 2pp. At 50, increments of 5pp. At 100, increments of 10pp. Understood. We're asked about the maximum bid. After checking in with Deni quietly on our funds, Gnog whispers that while we don't want to go anywhere near it - check in at 1000pp (!) else bid freely.

Deni looks very surprised - why is Gnog so smitten by this thing?! Gnog is bidding the farm on this being the differentiator, in the correct goblin hands, to get us into the Izzet... **To get us to Niv.** The auctioneer refers to it as a "Mizzium apparatus", used by the "mad scientists and wizards of the Izzet league" - this causes laughter - "and these rarely ever, ever leave the laboratories or halls of the Izzet. It's been many years since we got our hands on one of these. They're unpredictable, containing raw essence of magic; unexpected in their use, they can be wondrous or dangerous."

Bidding commences. 40. 50. 60... 65 (that's us). It pauses. The auctioneer tries harder. 67 and a half? It's taken. We say 70... A heart stopping pause... **70 it is! We win!** - and for substantially less than Gnog feared. The hostess turns up and congratulates us, asking if we want to watch the rest of the auction or go to an upstairs table in the night air with brandy. We opt for brandy (and Gnog tips the bidder 1pp). **In response he gives us a card with his name on it in case we want to ever acquire anything else that's rare or special**.

We get up to the outdoor table. Gnog just straight-up asks if we're supposed to tip the hostess too! ("It's probably rude, for which I apologise, but we won't know if we don't ask"). The view is spectacular, even taking in the glistening waterfalls of New Prahv in P2, the silhouette of Vitu Ghazi in P3 and the clouds clinging to Nivix in P4. The hostess assures us that it's not needed, albeit appreciated - it's rare. Gnog points out that the auction went for less than we expected and it seems poor form to tip the bidder not the hostess, so one more platinum there. The (very good) brandy is probably loosening Gnog's grip on money!

**(Taz looks after the Mizzium Apparatus in his chest. It's very odd - a canister, but with pipes that could connect to a gauntlet or some kind of headpiece - see Inventory).**

We have inevitably a deep conversation about inequality. Deni in particular. We know this isn't Toril. But we just can't shake it. The inequality is almost unbearable, bordering on truly grotesque.

As we're winding up the conversation and preparing to leave, we're approached by a strange looking well-dressed fellow who introduces himself as **Ernest**, a "purveyor of goods for those with eclectic and specific needs". He wears an Orzhov pin. TL;DR - he's part of **The Orzhovian Network** very good at finding things that are hard-to-find in quantities we might not expect to exist.

Gnog asks directly about Neogi eggs and supply to the Mercane via Ravnica, if that happened. A long shot, but we'll pay for the effort even if it comes to nothing - we're told that he might have info or might put us onto the Dimir. Very handy. We also ask about anything inter-planar, communication, location, disruption; devices; he deduces that we're looking for things to catch the eye of the Izzet. The guy is quick - he knows we want to see Niv. He can use his contacts for that. We also learn, to our surprise, **that scrying and precog visibility of the venue we are in is very limited - by design** - we hadn't even thought of that.

We're given a card. We can check in on him "from time to time" - the card is actually a sort of booklet that contains addresses of Orzhov "protected" clubs, where we can meet people. His name on the back means we will be able to get hold of someone who knows what's going on.

It's almost 11pm. Hometime, perhaps overdue. The casino is getting more lively. We don't want to know about the private rooms. As we're leaving we're offered a carriage but they can't go beyond P1 so we walk. As we walk we talk, Gnog pointing out that he deals with Orzhov in the same frame of mind as he dealt with Thay. It's grey. It's not what we want but it's probably what we have to do.

We make it back to P4 after a long, but largely uneventful walk. As we get close to home, we go through our usual laneways and get ribbed by locals - most in bed, just a few left - we remember what we're wearing! Oops. We'd better take that back to the bank in the morning. We're encouraged to buy a round of drinks for the locals - we do so. Back at the apartment, we check for posters in the hallway; none. We figure Aurelio probably has his hands full. Gnog comments that after all the fancy stuff in P1 he *really* feels like going to the Hellfire Club to see the incubus and succubus but Deni tells him no! Another time, perhaps.

It's late and we're tired and we're quite drunk and Gnog wants, hmm - maybe a run - Taz is fast - how fast? Taz thinks. Taz goes light blue and says "parkour...". Taz then goes bright green and shouts, "PARKOUR! Yay!" Deni reluctantly agrees to join in and Fee-Ree says she can adjudicate via flight, rescuing people in case of falls. We sketch out a rough idea of rooftops and walls heading North towards the precinct edge.

We head to the apartment roof and it begins! Acrobatics rolls throughout. First wall:

* Gnog: 16+3 -> 19
* Taz: Uses Song Of Creation to create springy boots! He has advantages on jumps -> 15
* Deni: Automatically scales the wall with ease -> 20

Gnog and Taz exchange glances as Deni is already fucking off over the wall before the two of us have really taken more than a step or two! Next jump:

* Gnog: 8+3 -> only 11, he doesn't make the jump! Dex save 3+4 -> 7, eek. He starts to fall so rages and uses flight - he hears Deni shout, "Look who's cheating!"
* Taz: 3,1+3 -> dex save 17, lands on the bouncy boots, performance check to get back up - 13+8, 21, bounces around and gets back up
* Deni: Toying with us basically and just making sure we don't kill ourselves

Third jump is a small one:

* Gnog: He gives up on finesse and just goes for run-hard-and-long-jump, so athl. 8+10->18
* Taz: 13+4 -> 17, makes it too
* Deni: Somersaults over

The last jump is the decider. It involves a few hops and Gnog can't just use brute force.

* Gnog: 16+3 -> 19, not quite enough! Almost makes it but not quite; hangs on and needs to pull himself up from the edge of a building - rage adv strength saving 16+11 -> 27 (!) - his fingers actually dig into the stone and he hauls himself up, but it's inelegeant
* Taz: 8,10+4 -> 14, falters at the last springy jump but Fee-Ree sees it and bends luck! This adds 4, needing built for success but that adds only 1, so he gets 19 too. Just like Gnog he *almost* makes it, but hasn't got the strength to haul himself up and Fee-Ree flies in to help.
* Deni: 28. Easy. She's already on top watching us dangling off the edge.

In terms of Gnog vs Taz, it's an unexpected dead heat since Gnog did need to throw strength at it with the long run-up and they both *just* missed the last one, it's just that Gnog was stronger - and this was a question of speed and agility, not strength. We're quite impressed with Taz, who definitely held his own and did himself proud.

As we catch our breath on the final roof, it's actually now not so scary and almost fun to see the chaos of the northern edge of P4 happening beneath.

We drop down, get back to the apartment and head to bed.



## Day 33 (Riglan 70 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Wednesday (7 day week)

After coffee and ringbread, we take the fancy clothes back to Vizkopa bank; we head there via Tin Street. It's easy enough to return the clothes. We're asked if we saw what we set out to see; yes, indeed we even took part in an auction. We're living like Ravnicans, we're told! An account is offered, but we don't think we want to necessarily be tied down right now.

Surprisingly, we're told that they have affiliated services off-world. An account can be accessed from other places - but fees may be quite high! Noted.

**Our writ is signed; our duty is done. It could be taken to the advocist for sign-off.**

OK, one last thing though - speaking to higher-ups in Orzhova. Ask about the house arrest. Just domestic politics, or examples of overreach? We head to the Orzhova and track down the person who originally showed us around - Taz does some fast talking, to see what we might find out; what do they know, or who might we speak to about Taysa. Persuasion 23. 

We - via Taz's persuasive manner - learn that she's not just being detained, but her title is being stripped. The decision came down directly not only from the Obsedat but from the Council Of Five themselves, which includes the original Karlov. And he's the most senior, so unanimous or not, his will is what usually happens. An audience with *them* cannot be granted... Unless we were to make a show of wealth... A "grand contribution" to the tune of, say, a **million gold pieces** could do it. Something large enough to catch their attention! Taz insight 19, built for success scrapes that to 20. Taz notices that the Chamberlain to whom we are speaking wants to say something that will help us, but can't quite do it - it seems he might necessarily not agree with all such decisions. Taz tries to persuade; 18, built for success, still only 19 **YET ANOTHER 1 ON THE D4**, FFS that's a very great number of 1s in a row now. All we get told, then - missing the magic 20 - try to talk to someone at the **Vuliev** or **Fautomni** Estates. They're "not hard to find". Vuliev is in the South of P1, Fautomni is outside D10.

Despite our intentions today to see the goblins in P6, we decide to follow this thread and head to Plaza South. The Chamberlain is right - not hard to find - a grand area, bounded by an old red stone, stands out immediately in this area. A church seems to stand on the grounds itself too - not just a chapel, a full church. There's almost a castle in there too. Guards at the gate ask our business. We state that we're hoping for an audience with the Vuliev Heir, in regards to the pressing matter of Taysa Karlov. We show our Boros investigation pins as a form of identification. The guard tenses up. Taz says, "oh, these just tend to open doors, but we're not affiliated with Boros directly nor do we intend to in any way usurp your authority here; it's just all we really have in terms of formal Ravnican identification, resident bracelets aside" - 9+11 -> 20 persuasion. They ask if we have anything that might indicate a trading history! In a flash of insight, Deni elbows Gnog in the ribs and says - "Ernest's card!" - and she fishes it out of his pocket. *Trading history* - the auction.

That does it. We're led in. It's not grand, manicured gardens like the Karlov estate; here there are old trees, a few flowerbeds and stone stables with some horses, some of whom are in small grass areas being managed by trainers. Gravel paths lead to a central roundabout of sorts, but with a tree rather than fountain in its centre. This is clearly an older estate than Karlov; wealthy, but displaying it in a different way. We are led to a smaller manor next to what looks like the main palace - the manor looks more lived-in, so we figure the palace is for 'events'. We're introduced to the personal assistant to the Vuliev heir. We explain why we're here, a bit more forthcoming regarding our "side of the fence" re Taysa.

Gnog focuses on watching what's going on - perception 19+7. The Castallan in front of us holds her composure very well, dispassionate and business-like. Even with perception 26 there's no read on the political leanings. She says, "Hmm, I'll see what I can do... See if I can get the young master's schedule cleared slightly... I can see you've possibly travelled some distance. And it sounds like you might have actually spoken to Taysa *after* her house arrest?" (We try not to be drawn). We're taken to a room that is very "hunting lodge", with a lit fire, various trophies and weapons on the walls, maps, tapestries, that kind of thing. There are unnecessarily large armchairs which sort of swallow us a bit as we wait.

In due course, we get told we have no more than 20 minutes. We must be brief and to the point.

Some hot food and drink is brought in; and the Heir enters. He is **Antonio Vuliev**. Despite the Castellan referring to him as "the young master", he looks early-50s. Human, pale, slightly olive skin tone; a smart coat, with a kind of hunting gear practical vibe. We greet him and thank him for making time. He asks who we are and there are introductions; then we explain our position.

* His responses indicate no interest in stuff about us being off-world or whatever.
* When we talk about guilds and imbalance, he gets more animated.
* In the matter of Taysa, he ends up explaining why her title was stripped.

**He says that, apparently, she was stripped of her title to try and stop her achieving a particular goal.** The Orzhov are both living and dead - almost like two factions, generally aligned but certain things the elder (dead) Orzhov oligarchs wish to preserve are almost xenophobic. Outsiders are not trusted. They're secretive. The Ravnican laws have over the centuries / millennia adapted and modernised to encompass most Orzhov activities, the Oligarchs still act as if it's all secret and underground. Taysa is new generation ("like myself") who think energies can be best spent elsewhere; they're very aware of the interconnectedness of Ravnican society. Yes, they're the financial engine of Ravnica. But there's more than that. Taysa departs even from Antonio's progressive thinking here - she believes the Orzhov can't possibly survive without entering into agreements - deals, contracts, working relatinoships, partnerships - with other guilds. Expanding but creating, potentially vulnerabilities in our system, which had been honed over thousands of years to be self-sufficient and self-affirming. Orzhovian ownership of companies might be opened to outsiders. She would dismantle the "fortress" of the Orzhov, believing that the money needs to flow and that this would improve everyone's lot and generate greater wealth, prosperity and stability - very counter to most Orzhovan thinking, especially amongst the Ozbidat and Council of Five. They believe the Orzhov should own as much of society's apparatus as possible.

We recognise this; the implicit maze, the need for guilds to co-operate; vs the idea of making one guild all-powerful, inward looking.

Taysa was starting to see success. The arrival of **Kaya** - a prodigious talent who has risen at an unprecedented rate in the ranks of the Orzhov, though nobody knows where she's come from - is where it went wrong. Kaya holds the ear of the Ozbidat themselves and achieved that in less than a year. Taysa's greatest rival, perhaps; but also the one who uncovered evidence - that Taysa does not refute - that led to Taysa's downfall. Without authorisation and against the will of the Council Of Five, Taysa had entered into power-sharing agreements with other guilds.

Nobody knows where Kaya came from; she doesn't even have a last name. She's a *gifted* assassin, apparently and has served the council extremely well. *(Is this a manifestation of our "third party"? Would one interfere with a single guild so closely?)*

He notes that being under house arrest is a big deal:

* Once a decision like this has been made, it's very unlikely to ever be lifted.
* She's probably going to be held captive on her estate for the rest of her life.

He voted with the house, as an act of self-protection but it's also rather pragmatic. He's sure they would _both_ have been arrested, which helps nobody and besides, his vote as a living person isn't worth much to the Orzhov and might've made little difference either way.

If we're going to "pull that thread" we're told to be *very* careful. "Kaya does not leave witnesses. She is a formidable assassin and works beyond the physical. She's able to pull off some confounding assassinations of people who were previously thought to be untouchable."

He talks about self-preservation. When we die it doesn't matter. Nobody cares. When *he* dies, everything he's done in life determines his comfort for the next few thousand years. He clearly thinks everything he does is being watched and calculated. Gnog chuckles. "Well, you're certainly right about *some* of that. Again, thanks for your time. If we can help Taysa we will, but clearly in this instance, a rather exceptional level of caution is required."

Wrapping up, we start to head out. We're talked towards the door; he leans in, and says quietly, **"You know, I do mean it. I envy that you get to have an end. That what you do in life ultimately doesn't matter when you die. That must be a nice feeling - to be that free."**

The Castellan before we leave hands each of us a wrapped bottle, each in a small leather bag. It's wine from the estate. Very kind.

We head up and back around - we almost go via Wayport but ultimately decide Tin Street will be quicker - to reach P6 and the Foundry Street area. The overcast day turns to rain as we arrive. We get to Gibo & Bebe's workshop door, knock and it opens - mum as usual! - "You're soaked! Get inside, oh my goodness..." - she hands us all towels and insists we dry off by the tower. "The boys" are called down. Rattling and clanking sounds happen from the kitchen and hot drinks are brought out - she's very concerned we'll catch a cold. It's very sweet.

The boys come down carrying a box between them. They lay it carefully on the ground. "We've been studying your crystal and we're ready to run bigger tests - but we can't do it if its raining!" "What's with the box?" "Well this is one way we can test it..." - it's a contraption that sends various kinds of power into the crystal to see what happens. Measuring equipment within is fragile and can't get wet. They've discovered:

* The crystal is very sensitive. It amplifies things. Last time, Taz mentioned sound. Yes, it does! It reacts strangely to different tones.
* It amplifies anything, in fact. Tones, energy, anything. It is an amplification crystal.
* Somehow, whatever energy goes in results in more coming out. That seems to break all energy laws of which the goblins are familiar, especially because it doesn't seem to be innately magical.
* We suggest that perhaps it's inter-planar; the energy might be not *created* so much as drawn from other places.
* They get worried that this means energy might be being drawn from other places without people realising.
* We wonder if the crystals draw from a nearest source. Is Nivix close to or on top of leylines? The Selesnyans would have charts; the library perhaps too. The mother doesn't think Nivix is *on* one but there's a node nearby.

We show them the auction cylinder, too. They basically swarm over it, figuring out what it is - "It's a Mizzium Aparatus of some kind! It looks highly unstable..." - they're elated by that! The downside is the weather. It looks like it might rain for a while, and unfortunately we don't have Druidcraft. We're told to come back as soon as it stops raining! They'll take out the device for the next round of tests then.

The mother encourages us to keep out of the rain - they seem very 'scared' of it, must hate the rain! - via the floating platform, which should be above the clouds. Well, we could try and have a late lunch there... Augustin Station is over in P2 and, given the rain, Fee-Ree offers a teleport! We head outside - but wouldn't you know it - the rain seems to have abated already, though the clouds remain heavy. Excitedly we rush back inside to let the goblins know.

They take us to their warehouse. Looks like it used to be some kind of gallery once. A power source is brought; they need help setting up; we assist. Taz in particular seems skilled, but Gnog helped carry the heavy things! The red crystal is taken from its containment and placed into the equipment that has been assembled. Gibo says, "Right! I'm recording! You run the tests" - there's some debate inevitably from Bebe about who's actually running it or recording, at the end of which they swap; Bebe recording, Gibo running tests.

We watch from a hopefully-safe distance! Taz has got Identify up in case he can recognise any magical emanations while tests run.

* When the power is at "4" they say - doesn't mean much to us but does to them - we notice that instruments are starting to register; they have needles that move to indicate things on dials. "These readings are unusual!" - at 2, nothing; back to 4; readings. They try 5.
* After, there's a pause while they confer to look at readings. Numbers don't make sense, they say; the three sets they have should show a relationship, but seem to not do so. They decide that they need more data.
* They try again, this time at higher power levels; all the way up to 8, safely; then 10. At 10, things change markedly, they claim. They realise that there are jumps at certain increments.
* They need more power, but think that it might be unsafe; instruments are reaching the limits of their scales. They do try carefully testing with a second power unit but Bebe eventually raises the alarm as the instruments have reached their limits, so they stop.
* At this limit, the crystal does start to emit interesting hums and Taz sees magic - he sees transmutation, conjuration and evocation. Energy and trans-dimensional magic. He lets them know.

That's all we can do for now. The crystal, while erratic and strange, is behaving broadly as expected in terms of its amplification and magical qualities, it's just that it's hard to accurately predict or quantify exactly how it will respond. More power in equals more power out, but the relationship isn't clear - it's not like doubling input doubles output.

We help take things back to the house. They're very wrapped up in what they're doing so we leave them to it and thank their mother; this reminds us to ask about the sky platform and whether or not you need to book tables and if so, how. You have to book both table and transport; each precinct has an office to do it.

In thanks for their continued help, friendship and hospitality, we leave them with one of the bottles of estate wine. It's the very least we can do.

The P6 office is over in Kamen Fortress so we head there. Gnog perception 13+7->20; we find it easily; when being asked about number of seats, just 3, Taz talks about how he can stand and we won't be any trouble... Persuasion 16+11->27. A sending stone is used to check on something and we're told - we're in luck! There's a cancellation for tonight and room for three. We are very lucky, apparently. We book for the flight and restaurant immediately - 1 Azorious silver each - *each* way - so that works out as 2 gold for a "free" meal. We are told to be at the station by 6:30pm for a reservation at 7 (and Gnog makes sure Beevi's timepiece is accurate - it is; a very solid piece of machinery). We are given a list of rules - "do" and "don't" - for the platform.

It's about 3pm. **We figure - leylines. We take the long walk across D10 to get to the Selesnyans** - it takes over half an hour. We don't want to impose on Levinia just with more things we want from her, so instead we head to Vitu-Ghazi. There are large crowds; some kind of seasonal cycle which culminates today. Many pilgrims. People are leaving food - crops, harvest - and leaving it in a central place, via handing over to attendants. We flag down an attendant, apologise for the imposition, say we're not with the pilgrims and ask if there's anyone we can speak to about leylines and nodes. We're directed to the 17th level of the tree and head up - it's apparently a kind of library (their 'keepers of wisdom'). As we head out, we realise that the delivered food is being packaged and redistributed out into the city on carts.

We witness on the 17th level a ritualistic kind of handing down of knowledge. There are books and writings, but they seem to prefer to pass on stories - the elder keepers to the understudies. We get into a conversation, asking about the leyline and node positions relative to major constructions like Sunhome and Nivix - are they close? Did one influence construction of another? They have diagrams showing leylines but not in map form; there is cross-referencing with our cloth maps. We need to help match up. Gnog: Perception 1, luck point - the map is upside down! - then 17 + 7 - 1 for Intelligence vs Wisdom on this check, 23 total.

There's some disparity in records on positions of these things but it's accurate *enough* to get some idea of the situation. There *is* a layline passing near Nivix, and a cluster that head towards Vitu Ghazi - naturally. It's not the centre of all things but is an intersection. Zonot Seven likewise. One runs under the Hall Of The Guildpact more or less and one runs under where "old" Prahv used to be. Some of the district junctions seem to have them too surprisingly - P1, P2, P3 and P4 connect in a wide area encircled (sort of) in a rough junction which has a number of leylines that anchor there. The line near Nivix runs roughly North-South, closer to Nivix than Sunhome, which terminates at that junction of the four districts.

They ask permission to annotate our cloth maps which we gladly give, so we've some rough ideas of where these things are. There's no question, though; Nivix is not directly on one, nor on a node. That said, D10 has a very unusually high concentration of leylines - the presence of Vitu Ghazi is presumed to be the reason. At least 7 separate leylines cross each other, terminate or merge across the district, but usually only one of them would be found in an area the size of D10.

We thank them for all their help, and say that it's definitely interesting and has been useful. We realise it's probably time to get dressed for the platform. We decide we don't need to go back to the apartment, we have our belongings so we find a bit of disused building to get changed in. Fee-Ree choses her 'fancy' clothes (but keeps on her mantle of spell resistance); Deni wears things over her armour and does not wear her cloak, along with more formal shoes that she still has, rather than the boots of elvenkind. Gnog sees them making an effort and just puts on his clothes of mending. It's not supposed to be dangerous; hard to justify the leather barbarian look!

It's busy as we head to P2, accessed by dropping in through the Whitestone district. We've not seen that up close before. The houses are unsurprisingly quite beautiful, 3-4 stories; Gnog perception only 13, so he just sees a kind of ebb and flow but not much more. That said, he spots a shop owner giving a bag of money to someone in the shop who looks like a solider. Gnog watches more closely now. The soldier takes the money out to a compatriot outside. They both wear polished, clean splint mail armour. Orzhov security? Yes, looking closer - on the shoulder hangs a sort of bandana with an Orzhov symbol. More banking! We see them move to another shop; it seems friendly enough, but the shop owner is counting out things carefully. Deni thinks it might be some kind of protection money thing, rather than storing a day's takings at the bank.

Finally, we're at Augustin Station. It is *very* busy, more than we expected. It's about 6:20, so we have a good amount of time left - in theory - but it's going to take a bit of time to get through the crowds. Deni points at a queue with a sign, "Decamillennial Platform". Fortunately it doesn't take long until people are brought on board.

It's a big airship, a large dirigible; there are three ramps being used for boarding. We're in the larger middle section, with what we think is a first class section up front and a cargo section to the rear being loaded with crates. We hear that it only takes about 20 minutes to get up there.

Gnog makes excuses to find an outdoor area or similar to see the sunset, taking Deni to help; Fee-Ree and Taz stay at the seats chatting. We get outside and Gnog lays it on the line. How we've kind of had it easy, all-in. He feels for them as he feels for Garren and they know what that is now. But Fee-Ree was wronged. He is furious. An ice cold anger at Niv, not a hot anger, a cold, steely resolve. He does not know what to do with that emotion. Where to put it... He doesn't know how to help. Deni listens quietly, hair moving in the breeze. There's a heart-to-heart. In the end, Deni agrees; we have few answers, but gaining more information is the key. It's a complex place. Hard to trust. Yes, she knows they are his moon! He's said it many times. At least the "investigation pins" we have let us act a bit more like ourselves; less afraid of legal entanglement. Sigh. It is what it is. We do our best... Deni goes to fetch Fee-Ree and Taz; it's quite beautiful out here as the sun is going down. One of the moons is visible - we don't know if it's the one with Ravnica Station.

We quietly stand stand by side together, taking it all in. Taz glows softly from within.

Gnog, perception adv. 23. He can see the platform, through the clouds. We can see the huge spire of Nivix above the clouds too - he never realised how high it went; certainly the tallest building in the district by a fair margin. Through gaps in cloud, the main walls and pathways of the city below are easy to see from here, with long, low-sun-cast shadows. He can also easily see the vast chains hanging down in between P3, 4 and 1, keeping the platform in place. Other dirigibles are moving around here, including one on our course, not far behind; others seem to be from other districts. The sun dips over the horizon, even from our elevated position. Since we're above the clouds, the sky is turning a deep and clear violet/purple. The platform, Gnog sees as we get closer, has many buildings, not just a restaurant; beautiful hanging gardens around the edge; landing platforms too - we're headed towards one, lining it up. It docks on the side we're on, other people having come up onto the outside area with us to watch. People enthusiastically start to disembark but we hold back to let the rush go by.

The other dirigible that was following behind has docked and their first class starts to disembark before ours. Planks were laid out and unloading happened quickly; ours has taken longer and people in first class start getting quite vocal and impatient. It seems the cargo section is unloading, but not much else. Gnog has a sinking feeling; he's trying his best to like Ravnica, but my goodness, the people can be hard to love sometimes.

Some covered carts arrive and some covered crates that we can't see are taken out. Two cart loads, before anything else. Finally, other gangplanks for passengers arrive and other cargo starts unloading. Gnog says, "Deni, you were just talking about going and poking our noses in where we're not supposed to..." and before he can say more, Deni has *jumped* off the edge of the viewing balcony and landed on the first class boarding planking, to the chagrin of others who wanted to be first! Gnog briefly explains to Fee-Ree that yes, we were talking about her as we're worried but then we were talking about how the investigation pins let us do more or less anything and maybe we should follow? So Gnog grabs Taz, rages and flies down with Fee-Ree in pursuit flying also; more angry passengers; we push past and give chase. Taz says, "Parour?" - Gnog says, "Hmm, no parkour right now...!"

We catch up. Deni's pressed against the side of a building. "They went in there!" - an older style construction, a weather station meets warehouse? Gnog sighs and says, "well, let's try not to kill anyone..." but Deni tells him to wait. Workers come out with the two carts, now empty, and move them into an adjacent store room. They leave and Deni says we should sneak in now.

Stealth: Gnog 23, Fee-Ree 5 (!) -> magical self-guidance -> 13, Deni 25, Taz 18.

For once, we're actually surprisinMagly quiet but our technique is more "walk around like we're supposed to be there"; we confidently approach, stand around to hide Deni's opening of the padlock and chains and then try to gently slide the doors open with Gnog's help. Taz checks the room (darkvision) - it seems OK - we creep inside and slide the doors shut. Only Taz can see; Deni puts down her goggles. They tell Gnog and Fee-Ree to wait while they check the room to see if it's safe to put on a light. Taz: Investigation 15, Deni likewise rolls (but of course always rolls high via reliable talent and high modifiers). It's a small warehouse and *is* a weather station, in fact, just with a lot of space for storage. No windows. There's a stack of crates in the corner - more than what we just saw brought in. Maybe 30 crates.

We suspect the outermost crates are the new arrivals but it's a bit of a guessing game. Taz casts Dancing Lights, so Fee-Ree and Gnog come over. Gnog, perception 19. It's a sinking feeling, he's seen these before - red crystals. **We open one; yes, that's what we expected. These aren't glowing though, they seem more inert. Each crate we check has one glass canister containing a growth of red crystals.**

Why are those *here?*

Deni points out that we won't find that out right now and here, so we'd better go have dinner! We nail back down the crates, push them back into position, creep out, relock the door and head to the restaurant - a little late, but nobody seems to mind. Others have been wandering the gardens and suchlike so are a bit late too.

It's a big place. There's a beautiful entranceway with music playing and a bar area; a bit hall, columns, no tables though; but we're all being ushered to lifts that *lower* down several floors - we estimate 40-50ft maybe - which exit to ramps and gentle curving stairs that open to the dining room proper, in a kind of 'reverse wedding cake' affair inside here. Around the edges at each level, windows. The restaurant hangs under the platform. While dining, we view Ravnica; while in the gardens, we can view the stars. It's almost enough to distract Gnog from being preoccupied about the red crystals.

We are seated and only then are we asked for the tokens, which we hand over. At this, our attendant welcomes us to the Pavilion Restaurant on the Decamillenial Platform. Drink orders are taken and we don't really have any have time to talk before some canapes arrive, but after that, we can confer.

* Why are these red crystals even here. Part of the levitation magic?
* Who could we talk to about that here?
* What is that weather station? Is it part of the restaurant or something else? Who owns those crystals anyway?
* These crystals were not glowing. They usually do not. So why were the ones in Midori Park glowing?
* Can we get a manifest of that warehouse - was it something else in there that made them do it, or something environmental?

We're interrupted by wait staff bringing a fourth chair, apparently uneasy about Taz standing. They even bring the canapes, but he points out he doesn't eat; but they can have the chef give him little tasting portions.

Food is a cultural amalgam. Varied and good but not pretentious. We are very pleasantly surprised. The food provides a prompt for us to discuss how we all 'feel' about Ravnica; rather than facts. Catch up with each other. At one point a server comes to ask if all is well - it certainly is! - but Gnog asks if there's a place afterwards to find out more about the platform (thinking - that warehouse). There is a main pavilion with a map and historical info, but also caretakers and even within the restaurant, tonight's maitre de is by chance on the operations team of the Foundation that looks after the platform. So we say, that sounds like a good place to start, and ask when might be a good time to ask without interrupting service. On the way out, we're told; or he can be told and if he has time he can come over.

In fact it's only five minutes later that he comes by. We make general enquiries about the wider platform and buildings, there's more about the levitation magic in the pavilion; the chains are important, we're told, due to wind; they're anchored within the city. We're told that the Foundation tries to hire people from all strata and backgrounds - "equal opportunities". Of the caretakers - their cottages are on the North side of the platform, on the edge of the gardens.

**The Foundation sounds very progressive.** People who established it were harking back to Ravnica of old - there are some who believe that the Guilds were only meant to be training wheels, not millennia of constraint that holds society in stasis. The Foundation thought that there could be a better future, a more egalitarian and progressive society in general. "The Guild Pact is there until and only until we can control ourselves without magical rules to enforce peace. It forces us to play along until we can do so ourselves."

Couses continue, our conversations about Ravnica, its origins - are in fact all modern Ravnicans invaders, who subjugated the megafauna 10,000-ish years ago via magic and the Guild Pact? Was there any civilisation *before* that? By about 10pm, the dinner is finally over and we are bid goodnight. They certainly do make an effort to make sure that people get a long and varied experience for their once-a-year token.

We learn that the airships descend at the half hour and on the hour, but the last one is at 11pm, so if we want to return today we'll have to be quick. Perhaps we might camp up here! We get to the pavilion, with others around too. There is information on the Foundation's dream, its progressive ideas started nearly 100 years ago; how it was funded, the levitation testing from the Izzet and so-on. On that front, the magic is impressive but in the end just Mizzium-based with recharging required; no red crystals mentioned. Surprisingly, by the time it came to construction there were only 8 years. The first version met with disaster, in fact but despite the inevitable adversity and naysayers that arose from this, more resources were put in personally by the Founders to bring Ravnica together and they rose above. It was only completed on the year of the Decamil celebration itself. It is rather sad, though; because of the disasters that occurred during that time, the remarkable achievement of the platform and the dreams they had were all overshadowed. The foundation never got to introduce people to the 'great leap forward'; all their excitement and hope, instead replaced by near-cataclysm as the Ravnican city started to fall apart beneath them.

Two founders, a husband and wife, are buried behind a small chapel in a garden that they planted. It's up here. Gnog asks if people mind if we visit that, so we head there. There's a caretaker, checking the grounds. We find the graves. Gnog asks Taz to come up and says, "to me, these people are how I could understand and like this place. They did things for others, hoping for a better future. I'm going to try and reach Garren..." and Gnog just sort of tries to reach out in his head.

**He doesn't know if Garren can hear, but in his head, eventually, says, "I don't know if the influence of Bahamut reaches this far, or if you, or other facets of your being, can interact with those that may have passed. But if you can, and if you're willing, perhaps let these two know that it wasn't for nothing, that it might have felt like such a disappointment, but the lesson is there, and people are hearing it, it just might take a little while longer than they hoped."**

Gnog gets a sense, a feeling, he hasn't had in a while. Companionship; the now-very-abstract spiritual presence of Garren. It's a response; a reassurance. No questions; just a feeling of care and concern. He's being checked in on. Gnog says, "I'll be OK, I just hope I have the skills to protect them here." Gnog feels a hand hold his and almost jumps; it's Deni. She's standing next to him, looking at the graves like he is and we just stand for a while. Then she lets go and leans down and places a flower on the woman's grave and stands. Gnog realises she left a flower in his hand, so he lays that on the man's grave too.

**Lucien** and **Nova**.

"Just imagine. Imagine what it must have been like to pull something like this off. Greater people than I could ever hope to be. They inspire, even after passing. What they did in life *did* matter after death. Antonio might never understand that."

Gnog clears his throat and heads to the caretaker and apologises for interrupting. He'd seen what we'd done. Gnog isn't intending to bother him now and was going to ask about camping permission (!) but the caretaker encourages us to ask him now, so we ask about the weather station / warehouse. It was important during construction - but it hasn't been used for many years since, now that the platform is aloft and chained into place. He doesn't know about any ownership - everything up here belongs to the Foundation - doesn't think it's in any kind of use though. We do mention seeing a couple of carts unloaded as priority from the airship and sent that way, but he seems confused and we defuse it by saying we're probably mistaken about the cart destinations. Izzet energy cartridges do get brought up by are taken to another part of the platform.

The caretaker **Ptolomy** is interested in seeing inside and so we show the investigation pins; he's a little nervous but basically OK with us opening the door without the key (!) since he's a caretaker so can give permission for this. He lights a lantern; the stack of crates is there. He heads that way and pulls back some cloth that's covering it. He notes that it's recent; we say that there are more crates than we'd seen unloaded from our airship. He asks us to leave it unlocked and he'll look into things tomorrow. We eventually convince him to let us re-lock it (so that tampering is not evident, just in case!) and we head back to his cottage, so he can get out of work clothes but then lead us to the "night engineer" that monitors the levitation system, so we can see if there are any planned changes to e.g. run it with a different kind of energy source - the red crystals. A long shot but you never know.

We enter a small building which is really just a weatherproof cover for the entrance of a spiral staircase that heads down a fair way to a control room of some kind which is suspended below the platform, similar to the restaurant (albeit much smaller). A single goblin is seated in a windowless instrumentation room illuminated only by various dials and a lamp. We explain what it's all about - red crystals, etc. - and he does seem to have heard of those, so starts leafing through various papers, checking some folders, seeing if there's any record of "amplification crystals". He can't find any notes or memos about changes to "the propulsions system". In the end - he's quite sure. No, there's no record of that and there's no need for more power up here anyway; it has all it needs. Amplification is not required.

That would be expected in Nivix. Big project in down there, really big! Headed up by **Ral Zarek**.

He writes a note for the day crew to check into it. We thank him and head out, thanking Ptolomy too for his time and efforts and ask if we should reconvene in the morning to talk to the day crew - he says sure, around 6:30am is when his shift ends. He doesn't usually go to bed until 7:30am. He asks if we're sure we want to camp rather than take a room; definitely camp! It's been too long. There's an older (relatively!) grove of trees near the pavilion, so we set up there. It's about 11:30pm now, so we decide to quickly run back to the warehouse to re-check. It seems light sources are not a problem.

Taz: Investigation, 17+b-f-s-4, 21. Looking for paperwork. Nothing at all. No paperwork of any kind in the room and nothing printed on any of the crates. No guild symbols, nothing. Gnog perception 24, the area in the corner where the crates are is cleaner; it's been swept for the crates to live there, it seems? Dust and dirt is disturbed in that area but not near any of the old weather station equipment. However - dust is disturbed and handrails are clear on a short stair that leads up to the second level / mezzanine.

Gnog and Taz head up to look. A metal door is latched up here and opens into a raised floor/roof above the main weather station, with additional instrumentation equipment here and a railing around. It's only maybe 15x15ft internally. It's cleaner just because it's outside, Taz: Investigation 18 (no more BFS left). Modifications have been made to some equipment, he notes. We can see where things have been removed to make space - bolt holes, changes in paint brightness from weathering; scratchings as if things have been moved or measured. There's much more space made here than a crate from below would need, so that's not it. The space has been cleared to around 10x10ft.

* Gnog says, "wild hypothesis, but suppose there's something that might be related to the IPB, but connected somehow, that benefits from altitude, or position up here, and they're putting crystals up here to power whatever it is, that got dropped in and moved around and maybe tested, probably by air, before being lifted out and taken back to Nivix - if it's the Izzet - so they're stockpiling power amplifiers to run whatever it is.

* Taysa might be able to tell us more. If she can't say for sure that she knows exactly who is being sold these, that there's *no* chance of anyone else doing it, then we might need to involve the Dimir - pay for information - we do also have **Earnest**, if need be!

We head back, putting everything back as it was, and return to camp for well-earned rest. We have to wing it on watch - Taz is as usual a sort of sentry, and we hope that this is going to be good enough. He rolls 19+2 on perception for the duration, which is a lucky roll; he sees nobody approach during our night.
