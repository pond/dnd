# Gnog: Part 15
## Day 41 (Ravnica 21, Riglan 78 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Thursday (7 day week)

* Ajani is due in two more sunrises after this one at Skarrg.

We wake up. The familiar envelope is under the door; breakfast invitation. We head down and have the usual. Once done, we check out; two nights in a row is probably enough to risk for now. We've enjoyed our stay; those top floor rooms are expensive but *very* good. We'd stay again! Trip Advisor 5 stars.

We wander out and figure, magic shops; floating disk. There's our "usual" (ish) place, but P2 has plenty around this area, catering in fact to spells largely to help nobles do things more easily - so unseen servant and, inevitably, floating disc. Perfect. The one we've picked has a guild logo, "The Mage Wrights Association" and is called **The Tidy Shelf**. We head in and ask for a floating disk spell - there's a full row of such scrolls. 50gp each; we pay. Deni has to purchase an additional 50gp of inks, chalks and so-on for the transcription that we'll do once Taz is on the Silver Navigator attuning to the Helm.

We decide to head to P3, via Aurelio's barracks - pure social call. Then we can spend time wandering parts of previously-unexplored P3 until midday.

Gnog perception 18. There's a lot of activity; busier than we've seen it. We ask, "Trouble with the Gruul?" "What? No, I mean yes but no trouble!" We ask about Aurelio. He's on duty, doing drills. They should be nearly done; we wait. We're sent to mess hall.

In due course, there are the sounds of many footsteps and chatter. Various soldiers file into the mess hall, Aurelio amongst them. They fetch themselves various drinks, mostly. Aurelio excuses himself, upon seeing us, and greets us. We chat a little - The Boros have been very busy for sure, "feels like it's reaching boiling point" he says - and he invites us to walk with him. After cleaning up - stripping off armour and shirt; Gnog's new appreciation for both male and female form admires the view - he asks if we can, by any chance, get anything up to the Station? He's in luck! So, he gives us a big stack of scrolls and papers - his reports. We stow them in the bag of holding for now, for passing on.

We mention that we're meeting people at midday at Vitu Ghazi; he says he'd better give us an escort. The military restrictions are getting worse and there are very long queues. They seem to be hunkering down and closing the perimeter. Food isn't getting out as much and that's causing issues. PTSD about the camps outside Waterdeep; only P3 is Waterdeep and we're in the camps! He says, "Right, let's go!" and files a route with the administrator of the Legion. He's talked into taking a partner with him - the barracks believe it's too unsafe to let Boros head out solo - but there's nobody spare; so Aurelio insists, but they Captain says that he must be back in 2 hours or they'll send a search party.

From up on the wall, the line of people queueing to get past the Selesnyan militia is easy to see. We have to work our way through the front, Aurelio needing to flash a Boros insignia now and then to be able to get past. Finally, we get to the gate and we're prioritised to be checked off to the side in a tent - even Aurelio - before being let in. Same as before, the "are you going to do bad things" kind of questions, under magic.

It's much busier behind the lines. More Selesnyan drills. We even see people making weapons and repairing armour. Watch towers have been built. None of this is good! We do see people trying to also *leave* with carts of food and animals, but they're held up at the boundary line just as much as anyone. Selesnya is trying to pull all of its people in; from what we overhear, they are increasingly paranoid about safety outside.

In fairness, they're more aware that something's up as they witnessed the airship crash first hand and knew what happened to the pilot - people saw him and recognised the same form of death as the voda. And they're all connected.

We update Aurelio briefly on the things we think it's safe to retrieve. In the end, he goes as far as he can; we're past the Concordance and on the edge of the main raised section of the Great Concourse. We bid him farewell; he salutes and withdraws.

Gnog perception 20+8. The Selesnyan guards are watching Aurelio. They are not unfriendly, but there's an air of being cautious and on edge - why is the Boros here?! - and seem much more relaxed once he turns and leaves. **It's very strange and not how P3 ever used to feel**.

Instead of a nice wander around, learning more about general Selesnya - which isn't present right now! - we think about going directly to Vitu Ghazi. Where we are right now, though, our attention is captured; upon the Great Concourse, we see a great gathering of people listening to choral singing. Group worship. People are packing food; there is some kind of mobilised effort - looks like storing in preparation for a siege in some cases, or supporting troops in others. It seems that in their case, at least, this isn't directly selfish - it's not stored just for them, it's stored in case it's needed because of this expected "great disturbance" which might mean anyone around in Ravnica / D10 needs that food.

The strange thing is that the worry within Selesnya is planetary. They're all connected. D10 is the seat of power with very powerful people who know more about what's going on and are doing all they can to stabilise guilds and tackle the *real* threat from another plane. Other districts are probably in worse condition. And then, in turn, the restriction of food here - the gathering and storing - causes worry in other precincts and it ripples out. And again, if that's rippling out here, it's rippling out in other districts too.

Now we make our way to Vitu Ghazi. There are numerous strange small and large creatures, some beautiful some less so, that seem to be taking refuge here. Tended to by druids and shepherds. Just as the livestock in P3 were stampeding, and just as now it seems the people here are on the verge of the same, wild animals are *coming* here, thinking perhaps that it is safe. We don't if they were called or just came. So, we ask! Apparently, they're just arriving. Some we raised here, but some are truly wild.

Gnog eventually just withdraws to let them get on with it and spends 10 minutes on his Talk To Animals ritual. Why not ask? So, in due course he tries to find a relatively large and hopefully intelligent creature - and there's a bear, with a family. Gnog tempts the bear over with food; it's indifferent. The shepherd tells him that they prefer fish, so Gnog changes and tries the fish. This gets attention. Cubs amble up. Gnog says to the bear, "Hello, I can understand you." "Thank you for the fish. I will give it to my cubs." "They look strong. You are raising them well." "I have brought them here to be safe." "That is why I wished to talk. We wondered, what brought you here?" "The ground. The ground shakes." "Shakes?" "The large things. They are moving. The big worms are moving. They do not come to our part of the forest but they have come close. It is not safe to be out there right now. Here, we are protected. Here we are amongst those who will defend us and feed us - and feed my young, giving them a chance to grow." "That was clever." "It is the wisdom of the old. It is in my bones. We know this instinctively. When the ground shakes, when the shadows pass over the midday sun, seek higher ground and shelter."

Scritches behind the ear. Gnog says, "Stay close, under the branches of this great tree, if you can. Safety will be greatest near it, because its roots are strong, deep and very hard for things like worms to break through." He hopes that's true!

Deni remembers the great walkways on Vitu Ghazi up to the library and we follow her up there. We're quite early but spend time browsing, while listening to stories. Disturbing, the news from below. It is relaxing to be up here listening to stories and history instead. This feels more normal. Gnog notices there's a lower lookout nearby; he thinks it might be worth chatting to people on watch so him and Taz head over to one. He greets the watchman and says, "Unusual times; I was wondering if, beyond the obvious strangeness of having to withdraw somewhat into Selesnya in preparation for possible future problems, you had noticed other strange things? A bear talked of vibrations in the ground - great worms on the move - have you noticed other unusual patterns?"

"That's what we are watching for. Watching for anything that might seem unusual out there. We have many eyes and ears working together to keep an eye on things. *Something* feels afoot. We watch with interest what happens within P4." "The Gruul?" "Yes. The angels seem to have it under control for now, but should they break past Sunhome, they'll be at our border. And Selesnya is ready to defend itself." He gestures below.

*Now* we see it, from up here. War elephants, armoured rhinos, many "siege survival" creatures, all large, numerous, corralled out of easy view from lower down but visible from here. They're mobilised much more than we realised.

**This is getting really, really serious.**

Back inside, Gnog quietly says to Fee-Ree and Deni - "they've got *much* more going on with the mobilisation that we'd seen before. It's bigger than we thought. Things are getting very, very serious indeed. I once said I didn't know if we had days, weeks or months. I'm now fairly sure that it's more like hours or days." Deni gives Gnog the "you're being a drama queen" look.

It occurs to us that we don't actually know where Nissa is; Gnog heads back out and describes here and names her for the scout he'd spoken to before, to see if he has any idea about this to-them-rather-strange new arrival, who we believe has been living up in the tree for a couple of days. She's well known! She's in the main hall - the Trostani have been talking to her. Most irregular, he says. **She's the reason they've suddenly withdrawn and escalated**.

Well that's annoying, because it complicates things if she's making people scared. We've got time before midday so (cursing slightly for not having done this sooner) we head back down and into the great hall. We find an internal way that brings us into an upper gallery, so we walk down the various vines and roots that from routes within the chamber. And there's Nissa, surrounded by animals. "Hi" says Gnog, "can we have a moment?"

"Of course!" says - the Trostani speak in unison to her in a language he doesn't understand and she sings back. We explain about Kaya. Nissa is happy to come up to the library. We start to climb. A few animals follow and some tiny saprolings are hanging off her. She has to turn around and tell them to stay. "They're kind of cute, aren't they?" says Gnog. "And the bears here are very well spoken, too. They like fish and ear scritches."

Gnog broaches the topic of P3 being alerted. Nissa says she connected with the consciousness and told them what happened on their world. Before the conversation finishes, Kaya finds us. She's overheard what were talking about; we should find somewhere better to talk. Nissa recommends that we head over to the animal pens - those elephants and so-on - which Kaya is distasteful of; but she agrees. Nissa heads there by growing a kind of a vine bridge; Kaya looks at that, says "nope" and does a swan dive to release her wings. We just stand up there like lemons - Fee-Ree just gets Gnog to hold Taz and flies us down so we can keep up.

Gnog: Insight adv. 18. Kaya and Nissa argue a bit. Kaya hasn't agreed about anything like The Gatewatch! Their worldviews are so different. Nissa is all about saving as many lives as possible. How can I preserve nature and life. Defence. That's why she focused on the Selesnyans. It's a mistake, but it makes sense anyway. Kaka is about eliminating the threat so it never happens. She wants people to help her achieve that goal.

We talk more. The issue of all Five needing to be together. Kaya favours the three of us getting the guilds together to discuss defence. We mention that Jace is on his way, found; under a telepathic link we reveal it is Amonkhet. This causes shock; they'd looked there before; Bolas must be back there, it's where the army is coming from, why is Jace there? **Attack considered now very imminent**.

Kaya and Nissa are an interesting dynamic - almost hilarious - often talking at the same time, but in opposites; at one point, Kaya says, "A group is only as strong as its weakest member" while Nissa is saying "A group is as strong as the sum of its parts". It reflects world views; both technically correct but different viewpoints. Kaya is not always the pessimistic one. Deni at one point tells them off for talking over each other!

Perhaps the threat being imminent, perhaps the news of Jace, perhaps the almost comical interactions and Deni's interventions helped, but ice breaks; the conversation becomes more constructive. It just sort of happens and we feel it. It seems we are working together. Kaya will find Tesseret and do her best to not try and kill him (!). We tell Nissa we just need to wait to see the moon and we can get on with our off-planet brief chore. At this, she takes us to the top of the tree. It's a cloudy day; she casts something and it takes a while, but suddenly the clouds all burn off and it ends up beautifully clear.

We now see things we've never seen before - even the spire of Nivix. We realise with shock why teleportation is needed. Its topmost section *levitates* what must be a good 40ft above a lower section. No stairs, no bricks, no nothing!

Gnog, perception adv. 21; surprisingly, despite it being around 1pm, *both* moons are visible. One is very low on the horizon, the other higher up. The one higher up is smaller. Gnog checks with Taz - points at the low one - "Ravnica Station?" he asks. Taz navigation 26. "Definitely. I recognise distinct marks on the side which always faces Ravnica. The other moon rotates."

Fee-Ree asks for the spyglass we got from Beevi's on the Rock Of Braal. Kind of poetic - Beevi and Vi are why we chose Ravnica all those weeks ago. She can see the moon clearly with this. "Do we have anything from the ship? Or the station?" We can't think of anything; but then Taz pulls out the docking contract for ship storage. Genius! "Will this do?" "It's worth a try!"

We thank Nissa. She takes a step back. Good idea with the whole wild magic, chaos thing! We all hold hands. Gnog is in the middle of shouting "See you later!" to Nissa - but we're already gone.

It works. No misdirection, no surges. We appear to the sound of a shocked shout! Two goblins jump back. We've appeared *in their office*. Coffee spilt everywhere. Deni catches a sandwich that was dropped mid-air. Gnog says, "Very sorry, sorry, teleport, sorry, ummm, I think we owe docking fees..." "...no, you're fine. You paid for two months! We'll show you to your ship." "Thanks. Sorry again." Before we go, they ask why we need a ship if we can teleport; because we're going back with cargo. "Ah! Do you need a cart?" - damn, but these goblins are helpful. We also ask about the passenger ship flight plan to D10; they do have that, and we need to log or own flight plan with them. We can either leave an hour before it, too, or wait until a bit over an hour after to make sure that the flight path and landing zones are clear on both sides. We don't truthfully know and ask if it's OK to file the plan for the hour before, but if need be, come to modify that later should we not be able to depart then? That's OK. (Otherwise, if it comes to it, we'll have to wait a full Ravnican day).

We're taken to the ship. Gnog is surprisingly emotional to see it. It's *our* ship.

It's been kept safe in an airtight hangar. We ask if we need to refile for docking should we return within the two month period; well we've paid for it, so there's a new clearance fee for takeoff/landing but otherwise, we'd be fine. We only need to pay docking fees if outside the 2 months. We don't ask for a refund and keep the hangar space - just in case.

Taz unattunes from his dulcimer. Its spells are more protective and we're expecting trouble. The drum and mizzium apparatus are more useful for combat. He starts attuning to the helm. Deni starts transcribing the levitating disc spell. The goblins have been warning us that we can't sleep on the ship - some people do, because it's cheaper than accommodation! - and then ask, in fact, how it works on smaller ships. No bathroom or shower. We remember that on the astral sea you don't need one and Guildspace was small enough to "hold it", but we did use the ship "facilities" for Wildspace. Gnog has a container to empty. Lovely. So he busies himself with that while Fee-Ree checks everything, mends anything that looks like it might need it and generally cleans up.

An hour later, it's about 2pm Ravnica time we think, and we reckon that surely the party we're after must be imminent. But first, we have something potentially more urgent. We get to the transport, take it to the main hub and head over to Ridani's workshop, Pieces Of Limbo. Deni has led the way so we get there quickly. An autognome is inside working away; it nods to Taz and they speak Gnomish briefly. The autognome points at Ridani's office. "Be careful of the people welding!" and we head (carefully) to the office. We knock politely and Gnog opens the door.

He's surrounded by paperwork. He looks tired. He asks the time. All we can do is guess at around 2:30pm Ravnica time. He needs coffee! He takes us "to the back" - the hidden space below.

We get to the rear dry dock. Interestingly we see that the ship is finished. "Impressive", says Gnog. It's an old design, he says; a Shrike vessel. "Old design but fast and maneouvrable. Cheap to produce too. You can pretty much build one from scratch in four months!"

The conversation turns to the threat. Not just the guilds. That's the least of it. It's about Nicol Bolas and the invasion. We don't know what's going to happen exactly; we're going to try to stop it; but we don't know what the collateral damage might be.

Taz, history 28: Reminds us that an "army of undead swarming across a planar bridge" was written by Niv. Nicol Bolas "and his forces" arriving as well; Deni interpreted this as a planet-wide invasion including probably hundreds or thousands of space-faring vessels too. It would require a planetary-scale armada to fight back. If the rebellion has that to bring to bear, it should sail here. If not...

The rest of the afternoon ends up being spent on this. We have to spend time with various people who will attempt to convey what's going on to the main base; Taz helps with illusions and history, we all pitch in (Taz adv. persuasion 27). Deni scribes and so-on. We need something *tangible* so Ridani doesn't just go to them with some "goliath said something bad would happen". We sign various statements; a kind of dossier is created; Aurelio's reports help a bit, even though Aurelio's perspectives were limited by his role within the Boros; they are going to try to persuade home base that their armada shouldn't fight the Xaryxians - it is needed to fight Nicol Bolas' forces.

Ridani eventually breathes a heavy sigh. He walks to the wall and presses a button on the wall. Red/orange lights start to blink slowly on all walls in the dry dock. We hear people chattering in surprise about an "evacuation order". It's quite orderly - some people come up to confirm. Some Dohar amongst them. Final checks on the ship, fill all tanks and food, get attuned to the help and prepare for departure, taking *all* evidence from the dry dock. Strip it out. Anything at all that can link back to the Alliance.

They intend to depart once they have clearance. They send someone off to get that sorted.

We pitch in to help, mindful of time. It gets into the early evening, then at around 8pm, we suddenly realise we *really* have to leave and find our party with the crystals so that we can get ship loaded and head out - 10pm flight schedule. Just before we leave, we hear that departure clearance for the Alliance ship has been given for tomorrow. Hopefully soon enough. We ask what the most dive bar "in town" might be. Sort of place mercenaries would hang out! In the market, there's a bar there apparently. "The Dark Side". Very Pink Floyd.

We are somewhat apologetic at the tearing up of this station, but sooner or later, it was always going to come to this - fight or flee, Xaryxians or other.

We head up and out (with Ridani's assistance up top) - seeing people already stripping out the workshop; it's kind of sad (impression of closing down, or at least extended leave; "Closed until further notice") - and get down into the market looking for the bar. Easy to find. A low, wide bar building. Inside it's dark but strip lighting recessed in the ceiling. We approach the bartender and ask about the two Hadozee and the plasmoid. The answer is simply, "What would you like to drink?" Gnog says, "Your more expensive ale, the kind which comes with a heavy tip." "Then forget the ale. You've got try this new stuff! White Spirit. It's all the rage." Four pours. "It takes colour amazingly" - he puts a dropper of something in it; it spreads like ink, bright purple. "8 silvers!" - Gnog pays two gold. "So. About the hadozee and plasmoid." The bartender shrugs. "Hadozee come, hadzoee go. Plasmoid on the other hand; you might want to wait a little while - perhaps take those drinks to that corner over there..." - so we do.

Interesting, we note that the bartender gave us 3 extra drinks on a tray.

Gnog, flat perception 11+8->19. There's a table with three hadozee; another with two hadozee and an insectoid creature. Gnog whispers to Taz, "can plasmoids change shape?!" - Taz isn't sure. Deni uses an unerring eye... "Huh. Interesting" she says. "Gnog - both those tables there have *two* Hadozee". "The third hadozee is something else?" "Yeah. Can't tell what though. Pretty clever though. I'd have bet the two-plus-one table."

So we've got an obvious rogue, a massive goliath and basically a dragon. Taz is up. He has the rune key. He takes the tray of three drinks - a clever bartender, that one! - and plays table-server. With BFS, performance 4+9+2 -> 15. Just enough. He's put the rune key on the tray too; they see that when he drops it. They make a show of asking him what the drinks are. He says they're very interesting, repeating the bartender's words about them as handing them out. Taz points to the rune key and says, "I can things from here - can't be fun lugging heavy things around all over the place..." "Alright, hmm, we'll finish our drinks and wait for a minute before leaving. Keep right."

Taz perception 19+3 (!) -> 22, people aren't watching; so he doesn't need to keep playing server fortunately! He returns the tray to the barman and comes back us, explains briefly and we wait nervously, trying not to pay obvious attention.

The table stands to leave and walks out. A moment later, we do too; we thank the barman on the way out, interesting drink - "you have a good day now, I'll see you next time!" - and head out the door, turning right. We walk between two buildings down a small street. A hadozee appears to be at the end - but then it shimmers and a pseudopod appears above its head with a light on it that blinks softly. It turns and ducks around a corner. We follow. Another corner. We proceed with caution, expecting to be jumped pretty much. At that next corner, the creature is stood next to a doorway. It ducks in. Gnog asks Deni - mouse? - she checks; just the three in there. We enter.

The plasmoid is a full plasmoid now. It has a backpack and various belts holding all kinds of tools and other materials. The two Hadozee have weapons drawn, in defence. The plasmoid has the rune key. "Right. You need to unlock this. We understand you won't until you have the goods." "Correct." "We need to know you didn't steal this!" So we try to explain all we know, hopefully only us being able to know that if it was "real" and not stolen. Taz persuasion 24.

They ask if we have a means to convey the crates. Yep, we have a cart. They write down a dock number. "Get your cart. We travel separately. Meet there as soon as possible." OK then. We part company, we get the cart which we'd left outside the pub having been dragging it around since the dock and head to the new dock location provided.

We're relieved to see one of the hadozee there. It's a small, old looking ship. Flying fish type. Beaten up though. The cargo hold is open; we bring up the cart. They show us a pile of crates in which they've done their best to safely package red crystals (as if delicate objects rather than magic - wrapped in cloth, placed in hay - without really understanding what they are; no suspension fields, but they seem quiescent enough - no glowing, no undue heat or other signs of activity - hopefully that's enough!) - there were some size requirements they'd been given apparently, so they've filtered them. About 5 look pretty small; 8 look definitely too small; but around 17 look large enough. It takes up seven crates. 30 total, as instructed, even if some are small! We unlock the key.

Gnog can't help but ask - how much was the payment? 500gp each; not bad. Gnog adds in 30pp - 10pp each - from our personal fund, because it was an honourable trade and their ship is nice, but needs a bit of TLC. For this the help us load the crates onto the cart. One of them also hands us a bag, since we'd paid more - it has lots of small shards that they'd scavenged but filtered. Probably not useful but you never know what Gibo and Bebe might come up with!

In a moment of paranoia, Gnog asks Taz to use his magic detection wand to check the crystals. Same signature. Seems legit.

We depart with the cart, heading directly towards our own dock, on full alert. Gnog has the claymore drawn. Deni asks if Taz can disguise it at all? He uses Minor Illusion to make it look like other carts he sees around; different style crates, smaller ones, rather covered with a tarp.

We are surprised to get to our ship without attack. We have to figure out how to get the stuff up at this point and on board; Deni helps Gnog get the crates off the cart, then he lifts them overhead (Athletics 16+10->26) and is just about able to slide them onto a deck for Fee-Ree to then push them down into the cargo hold. It takes a while but we get there. We lock the ship and let Deni spend 10 minutes running an alarm ritual from her copied scroll in her spellbook.

We return the cart. It's still only around 9pm, and Fee-Ree thinks we should help more with the Alliance. She thinks we should not just shift our flight a couple of hours; shift it the full day, so we know they're safely away. Tricky choice; increased risk of theft or interference, but once it's said, it's true; we can't just leave them and we can help. We take the "chamber pot" that Gnog had cleaned up and stow that in the bag of holding. It's an object linked to the ship. Should we get an alarm, we can teleport directly back reliably - in theory! We modify our flight plan to 8pm next-day with the dock control goblins. Turns out that we can leave as early as that, despite the regular later 11pm passenger flight, because of the time of year & moon dynamics. Handy.

Back to Pieces Of Limbo. We work with Ridani and his crew until midnight. The ship is already tested and ready to work. Quite a few people are taking moments out to say goodbyes, return things that have been repaired and finished; it's a leave of absence for the workshop, to make it look more like a planned shutdown and keep the whole Alliance front secret. Their departure slot is just before ours; we'll be able to see them off and then immediately leave ourselves.



## Day 42 (Ravnica 22, Riglan 79 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Friday (7 day week)

* Ajani is due in one more sunrise after this one at Skarrg.

The day continues with more cleaning up and emptying of the warehouse. They are going to turn off lights at 4pm - that's their call. 4pm, and not turn them on again until they're back here one day to reopen properly. Supplies are needed - somehow overlooked - so we head out to the market.

Gnog, perception 18+8 -> 26. We find a supply shop easily. However, the shopkeeper is a bit distracted. Everyone is looking up. We look up. We're on the moon dark side but right now the Ravnican sun illuminates things in the space around us. **Silhouetted against the light are shapes appearing in the sky. Are we too late?** The Alliance members start to get really worried - they recognise them. **"We have to go! We have to go right now!"**

**It's Star Moths. At least four, and one other ship that we've never seen before. Mercane.** So, not a full invasion? One Star Moth heads to the dock, but others stay in space, guarding exit. People in the market seem curious about it, not worried, since Star Moths are allowed to be here even if it's rare. 

We quickly get back with the supplies and bring everything down to the ship. Can their flight plan bring them out without being seen? A conference is held. They *think*, since they're not in the docks here, that they can get a course away which, even if spotted, would let them outpace the Star Moths. They won't wait for their 8pm slot - they'll gun it as soon as they can. We wish them good luck. They wish us farewell. As we start to head up, we can see them powering up the ship already. Deni turns and waves from the stairs.

For our own part, we now need to make a run for our ship. At the workshop, we formulate a quick plan. Taz can be seen easily, he's an autognome; Deni can hide easily. Taz tries his Mizzium Aparatus to cast Invisibilty - DC 16 - arcana 14+4, so it works! Gnog and Fee-Ree are hidden. Deni slinks into the shadows - and not a moment too soon. The front doors are blown open with a loud bang. Two clockwork creatures crawl in, followed by something wheeling itself in; some kind of ballista or mechanised cannon. Three astral elves follow. One in the middle looks quite regal; two guards either side, one more armoured than the other; they wear their strange mirror masks so their faces are hidden.

Taz freezes; he pretends to be inactive - deception 13+7 -> 20, lucky roll. "Are you *sure* this is the right place?" asks the regal one. "Yes. We know this is a rebel base". "Ha! It's an abandoned body shop. Inactive machines. How reliable is your information?" (We hear a slight shudder - the ship in dry dock - oh dear!) "What was that?" they say - and run to the door. They get to the back of the shop - "Where's the dry dock? Here! Blow that down! I want to see behind that wall" - the wall disintegrates as the cannon destroys it. We can see the ship departing. "Told you!" says the one guard, but the regal one just shouts, "They're getting away, fool! Alert the ships!" and they start to run out. We follow.

Outside, a single mercane. First we've seen for real. A blue giant in mercantile robes, tall hat; 12ft tall or so. "What *is* that commotion?" he asks. "They have a ship and they're getting away!" "What? Alert the ships! Alert them to keep an eye out!"

We sneak past and make a break for the transport to the dock. Taz makes a show of having trouble at the transport door; Deni makes out that it's her malfunctioning autognome - this gives the invisibles time to get on board. We still have no idea if the Alliance will make it. Deni is clearly very nervous.

At the dock, we disembark the transport; the goblins there are freaking out - airspace above is a complete mess. What's going on? There's an unauthorised launch. **Suddenly we feel a huge shake and the goblins scream; pieces of ceiling fall; another crew run past shouting, "Run! They're attacking the dock!".** Moments later, there's a huge explosion nearby as a searing beam of radiant energy carves through a series of parked ships in the open dock area, destroying them outright. We can see Star Moths in formation above, directly attacking Ravnica Station.

Gnog shouts at the goblins, "Come with us! Run! No questions! Run for your lives! We'll take our ship!" - we can't risk teleport, the goblins are panicked and running all over so we can't really get hold of them and besides, we've no idea what kind of damage the Star Moth beams do to the local weave.

**We're almost at our ship, when between us and our ship, space appears to distort; it twists; in a searing burst of life, we see the regal elf again. "I *knew* there was someone sneaking around behind us..." - and the three elves, the Mercane and their three mechanical 'servants' - not the heavy artillery, the creepy mechanised spider-like things - all come through a portal.**

Gnog curses and calls to the goblins, "lay low, try and stay behind us, we'll do this as quickly as we can!" then shouts to the aggressors, "You've attacked a civilian port, destroyed civilian ships and murdered innocents. Do we LOOK like pirates or bandits? We're here on official investigation business from the Boros of Ravnica, and there will be hell for you to pay for your crimes here today!"

The mercane just laughs. "If you think ANY authority has jurisdiction here, you are sorely mistaken. *This* is the territory of the Infinite Consortium!" The elves respond, "**All will bow to the Xaryxian empire!"**

Initiative:

* Deni: 19
* Taz: 13+5 -> 18
* Gnog: 11+3 -> 14
* Fee-Ree: 10

Deni is quick off the mark. She aims straight for the Mercane. She hits, for 37 damage. Strange dark blue/purple blood leaks from the wound. It roars and in response seems to be preparing something. Taz sees this and tries something new. He throws Psychic Lance at the Mercane (DC18 int saving throw) - it fails a decent 25 psychic damage and is on its knees; the area around it starts to shimmer and shake strangely, uncontrolled. He sees that Fee-Ree seems distracted and worrying about the goblins, so throws her some bardic inspiration.

The astral elf guards respond together. The first runs forward, sees Taz and throws two radiant rays at him. The seem to emanate from the strange mirrored mask, which produces the blasts that he guard channels through his sword. Taz is hit (24, AC 18, so even Shield won't help with that) but Fee-Ree tries to bend luck and reduces the hit by 4, to 20; Taz sees the aim falter a bit and reacts with a shield straight away. For the second ray, the elf noticed Fee-Ree's intervention and with 17 AC and 17 attack, manages the hit. 4d10 -> 16 damage. That stings. Almost simultaneously the other guard is targeting Taz too, hit 19 which misses thanks to shield, but likewise targets Fee-Ree on the second but misses fortunately; she just has a fraction of a second to dodge after the first hit.

To our surprise an autognome appears from behind the mercane. It uses an action to bring through the cannon we saw earlier, directly in front of the group.

Gnog rages and flies up. He's able to reach the cannon, just avoiding opportunity attacks from the astral elves. He uses Stormbringer, hits, 18 damage, plus 5 lightning which is to have full effect. He swings again, again just hits, 17 total damage all-in. He moves sideways a little so he's not staring straight down the barrel!

The strange spider-like hooked creatures shudder and head towards Gnog. One gets close and pulls out *two rotating swords* (holy crap) and strange snapping metal jaws go for him. He's able to dodge the bite and the first sword; the second hits but obliquely, skating off his thick skin without damage. Another one moves around but stays at a bit of a distance. It has three arms that it brings together; a glowing ball of energy forms and a lightning bolt springs forth. He dodges the first, doesn't expect the second and again it hits but it glances off, apparently channelling down Stormbringer - no damage, but a close call. The third one does the same trick but is over on the other side from Gnog and instead attacks Deni. It hits her for 8, and the second would but she dodges the worst, taking only 10->5 damage. Gnog shouts, "If you spend a bit of time with the Rakdos they'll teach you how to make that feel like a good time!"

Fee-Ree runs forward and squares up (from a distance) with the two astral guards; shouting, "I knew you were bad news! I'll give you something to *reflect* upon!" (good grief, and it's all Gnog's fault, he started this kind of thing). She realises that radiant energy isn't going to be much use so instead uses sorcery points to twin a level 3 chromatic orb, throwing one at each guard; she tries acid orbs (twisted!) to tarnish those masks. Tides of Chaos aids the attack. Both hit; no surges; Tides of Chaos is regained. 16 and 21 damage respectively. She even adds in a Firebolt cantrip, hitting the first guard for 18.

There's another loud bang and shudder as Star Moth attacks continue nearby; rubble and dust falls from the ceiling onto the raised walkway around us. Our ship is in the recessed dock, so seems safe for now, but we worry about a direct hit onto the bridging rock wall or just damage from roof collapse.

The cannon whirs into action. An explosive bolt is fired - just past Gnog's face! - into the middle of the whole of the rest of the party, goblins included. DC15 dex saves all round. Taz fails badly, caught completely by surprise. Fee-Ree too. Deni completely dodges any damage. The goblins - success, success, fail, success. The goblins are a bit like rogues and take no damage on success. 5d6->19 fire damage for Taz, halved for Fee-Ree. The one goblin is in bad shape. Fee-Ree's OK still, Deni is fine as are the other goblins. Taz's casing has charring marks and some overheating damage has occurred internally.

The regal elf, who we think we recognise now as some sort of priest from the attire and manner, turns to the Mercane and heals him with an *eighth level* Cure Wounds; 8d6 -> 33. Then there's some kind of additional spell; she looks up, hair lifts up, something like starlight seems to expand out and she teleports. She turns, looks directly at Gnog and with some similar starlight effect, this time some kind of rain of radiant sparks start to fall from the ceiling. Gnog sees it coming and thanks to advantage on the dex saving throw (DC16) -> 22, takes half damage halved again via rage to 5.

The goblins finally gather enough of themselves to scatter sideways.

(New round) The shimmering around the Mercane intensifies and suddenly, stepping out through it - another portal - is a really strange creature; some kind of slabs of stone attached to a mechanical skeleton, acting as if it a defender with the stone slabs a shields, standing in front of the Mercane. The shimmering stops.

Deni can't easily see the Mercane now, so instead switches attention to the cannon. It seemed quite easy for Gnog to hit even with what were quite wild swings, moves to get a clearer line of sight and attacks. She hits. 39 damage total. Thinking ahead to her next move, shje tries to get some insight on the priest and thinks she's successful - she can attack sneakily with ease. She moves a bit further back to help line everyone up and draw fire from the group.

Taz tries to use the mizzium aparatus to cast Heat Metal on the cannon, moving forward a little to get into range; L2 -> DC 14; but rolls 10 on the arcana check + 1 BFS, fails, d6->2. Instead, he gets Gust Of Wind! Not helpful, really. The cannon, defender and one guard are in the breeze. He's annoyed and best he can do from there is throw bardic inspiration at Gnog, who's in the thick of things; Deni is doing OK and is quite wide-of-field, and Fee-Ree still has inspiration from earlier.

The dazed mercane finally recovers and looks ready to flee.

The guards now once again act as a pair. The first throws two rays at Fee-Ree. One misses; one would hit, but Taz tries to distract with Silvery Barbs. It's a bit wasted as Fee-Ree was throwing up a shield at the same time. In fact, it would've hit Fee-Ree but for her shield; Silvery Barbs; but he gives Fee-Ree an advantage for whatever she does next. Meanwhile, the blast of wind from Taz's accidental spell pushes the second one back 15ft (DC18 strength save failed); it rolls sideways so that it isn't in front of the cannon barrel. It throws a radiant blast at Taz which hits for 25, causing serious damage; Taz detects several cascading internal failures and tries to compensate but isn't sure how much longer he can remain functional. He has to assess his risk taking and start to consider a more defensive posture. Deni is hit for 24, which she dodges a bit, taking 12.

The autognome from earlier now tries to shock Gnog; he dodges ones and the other just doesn't affect him. Gnog acts, and figures what the hell, the cannon remains a serious threat; he goes full barbarian and recklessly attacks. Despite the recklessness, he'd almost miss (1,3+12) but he uses his inspiration. He rolls a maximum 8! The hit will make it - and damage there is 24 - but he realises that there's additional damage spreading out. The cannon and the spider-like creature both take additional 8, but the defender seems unharmed. He swings again; 24 to hit; the stone defender tries to help but it's not enough; the hit lands. Total damage is 23 - the cannon is destroyed! It is smashed into pieces.

The "clockwork horrors" (spider things) continue their assault. The one in melee with Gnog repeats its prior attacks. This time, it has advantage after Gnog's reckless (but successful) attack on the cannon. The bite misses but the first saw blade is a crit hit, though it only deals 10->5 damage; the second blade also bites in too, but only 1 damage on that. The next one tries its lighting bolts but both miss, the aim wild. The third one can see that Gnog was distracted by his attack and joins its companions in their attack too; it misses, albeit only just. A bad round for them.

Fee-Ree decides the classics are best - a level 4 fireball is the way forward. It can't get all the enemies, but it gets close, clipping the Mercane, defender, two of the clockwork horrors, one guard and the elf priest. 9d6 -> 37 damage (one of the D6 was a 1, but Fire Elemental Adept lifts it to a 2; and fire resistances will be overcome and ignored). DC18 dex saves. The defender, both clockwork horrors and Mercane all fail taking full damage. The guard and priest succeed, taking half -> 18.

The priest now acts. She calls out, "On me!" (presumably, we think, to the guards?) and casts her raining radiant damage down towards Deni (22 -> dex save DC16 made -> no damage). The priest looks angry but to her credit does *not* curse, then teleports over to the first guard's side.

The Mercane opens a dimension door to escape, but throws 3 psychic blasts out first - DC15 Wisdom saving - one to Deni (who is hit) and two to Gnog (but only one hits). Gnog makes it, taking equivalent of 10 slashing -> 5 damage. But Deni is caught off guard, taking 10 damage and becoming frightened of the Mercane. At this, he fucks off through his door; Gnog was too busy being psychic lanced to shout "Counter that!" to Fee-Ree who is, anyway, out of range (and otherwise well aware without prompting!).

The defender is left behind and now seems to become an attacker. It misses and moves away; Gnog tries an opportunity attack as a sentinel; 27 hits. It stops moving and takes an OK-to-low-ish 17 damage.

Deni takes aim to attack the second guard, who was hit by the fireball and looks about ready to advance towards Fee-Ree and/or Taz. **Crit!** 17+30+26 -> 73 damage; the guard drops like a stone.

Taz has to choose to either move his gust spell or self-heal; he's forced to the latter, else he can't pilot the ship. So he drops the spell and casts L3 healing word on self, but only rolls *three ones* so it's almost useless; he only heals 8. He has to decide who to hit with Eldritch Blast; hard choice, they'll all retaliate; priestess is squishiest. He withdraws as far as he can, then fires the spells. First hits for a solid 14. Second is nat 1 therefore missing completely.

The guard stood next to the priestess sees this attack and of course responds, as Taz feared; astonishingly, both miss (one at 17 vs AC 18) - well, that at least is some good luck! The autognome advances and ends up within 60ft of Taz; he attacks Taz as well with arcs of lightning. Attacks were 11 and a Crit! Doh. At the last moment he remembers Silvery Barbs can be used for self; this takes the attack to 14 -> misses. Fee-Ree gets advantage.

Gnog decides to stop toying with the little guys. He jump-flies behind priest and guard, taking opportunity attacks from the defender and clockwork horror; both miss. He swings at the guard twice recklessly. First hits, total 20 damage; the second hit is stronger, 24. Guard's badly injured - but still up. The clockwork horrors once again go for Gnog given his recklessness. (Quietly, Gnog was depending on it - his party is tiring, but he's got a heap of headroom still). The first misses; the second *only just* misses, but a miss nonetheless; even the third misses. AC 21 for the win.

Fee-Ree uses her Silvery Barbs advantage and Tides Of Chaos to twin lightning damage through the Lennithon staff, into a chromatic orb. She uses three charges on the staff to try and get more out of it (leads to 5d8 for one attack but 8d8 for the other). The guard is hit with the higher damage spell; 8d8->38; this takes them down. The priest(ess) is hit too, 5d8->25. The priest is starting to look a bit panicked; puts a hand on the autognome; says a holy word and in a burst of starlight they both vanish.

This still leaves the nonsense of the defender and three clockwork horrors. The defender attacks Gnog with post-recklessness advantage - but still misses. Deni aims at it and manages to hit, 10+34->44 total. That's just enough to tip its total damage over the edge; gears and cogs shatter, joints fail under load and the creature crumbles to the ground.

Taz throws Eldritch Blasts at the clockwork horror caught in a fireball earlier. Both miss my miles (rolled a 2 and 6). He considers bardic inspiration but Gnog doesn't need it and Fee-Ree works on areas; he self-heals instead, L1, rolls a 4 for 9 - more healing than he got from his L3 earlier. Such is life and magic.

Gnog runs up to the least damaged clockwork creature on the edge of field to keep the middle area clear for possible area effect spells and recklessly attacks it, hitting twice. It has lightning resistance; 17 total damage, then 18. In return Gnog is hit with a lightning jolt for 3 damage. Second misses. Further hits from the others via range and melee are a crit each; total taken damage is 10 (11->5 + 10->5).

Fee-Ree twins Firebolt at the two others. One is a crit, one a hit. The crit does 43 damage (6d10!) destroying it; the other takes 13 (3d10). Deni aims and fires at the one that Fee-Ree had hit; it is also destroyed. Finally, Taz tries again with Eldritch Blast, moving to get a better view of the last one on Gnog; hits for 7, but misses for the second. Self-heals (accidentally, I clicked on the wrong roll button!) for a maximum L1 -> 9 again.

Gnog shouts "Thanks!" to Taz and swings twice recklessly. Total 17 on first hit (accounting for lightning resistance), then a high 21. It's crushed and fried.

**The goblins run back in. We don't bother to loot.** One goblin is heavily injured, but standing. Star Moth blasts continue to shake the area and cause rubble to fall; we run for the ship. Gnog jumps up on deck, grabs Taz, and almost *throws* him down into the helm (knowing that the gravity plane will flip him "upside down" and he'll essentially land nicely). Taz shouts, "Please clear moorings and open the dock; lifting off immediately!". We can hear the ship start thrum as he engages the helm and warms up the wing motors for the brief atmospheric flight within the dock air bubble; wings start to extend. The goblins run around, shouting instructions to each other, untying safety ropes, throwing other ropes to each other and apparently to try and pull a side door open directly, a sturdy hinged affair built from the rock, which would give us a direct exit without needing to fly out to the damaged platform from which we just came. Gnog jumps down again to help, still holding his rage and using limited flight; the ship begins to lift as they manage to get the doors swung out, so Gnog grabs the goblin, throws them up on deck one by one quickly, then jumps up after it, just making the edge and pulling up onto deck as Taz starts to head out.

We know we need an evasion course. Stealth or commuter pilot runs be damned. It's too early to come into Ravnica at dark. No choice, no time; Gnog shouts "Gun it! Best speed, power dive into Ravnica's atmosphere and directly at the landing zone by District 10. If you can make us look out of control, do it, they might ignore us if they think we're crashing!" Taz shouts back, "OK! Once in atmosphere, I'll try to use the cloud layer for cover".

First, clear the Star Moths. The hangar door is open but narrow. Intelligence-based acrobatics with proficiency and advantage as the goblins are helping. We rock us sideways abruptly and violently as we exit, as light beams are carving across the landing zone, destroying ships, one passing just feet away from our bow as we emerge. We see people running, screaming; some are stood frozen in horror; at least it looks like the attack is focused on the ships and landing zones, not the main base and not people, but there must surely be injuries and deaths. Fires everywhere - smoke pooling up at the top of the air bubble in places - very strange.

Gnog and Deni are on top deck with Gnog ready by the weapon (more for peace of mind). Fully clear of the hangar, he looks up - perception with luck point - 9, 9 again, total 17. It's enough to see a Star Moth pulling out to try and intercept the Alliance ship - it's not even got clear! Everyone sees the danger. Gnog hopes that we can distract it if we fire with the ballista. He shouts instructions quickly, letting Taz know to point the ship at the Star Moth, we aim. The goblins are heroes here, assisting with everything as if they'd been part of our crew for years. They just know what to do.

It's perhaps a bit more successful than expected. Gnog channels inspiration from a while ago from Taz, firing with advantage. 14 and a crit! 6d10 damage also rolls high; 41. **The bolt goes straight through the wing-sails on either side of the ship** tearing through and pulling the ship around from the force; Gnog roars triumphantly at the sight, "GOT 'EM!". The radiant bolt shots off-aim, tracing a wide arc across space. The Alliance ship is really moving now; then it must have finally got clear of the station's gravitation influence and we see it suddenly just shrink and vanish. Taz shouts, sounding exhaulted, "The Shrike is away!" and a cheer goes up among our small crew.

We, on the other hand, are *not* away. The three other Star Moths are still attacking landing zones, as well as taking out ships that attempt to take off - murdering their crews - but ignoring us for now. The Mercane ship, we see, is fleeing... But we have very much got the attention of the damaged fourth Star Moth. It swings about to bring us into aiming range of its main weapon, but is too slow. Taz is pulling away from the station, listing heavily to port as he swings in a tight arc around and down to try and evade; the ship pitches over and we're looking at ground rather than sky. At this, the goblins shout excitedly at a gulley, a narrow twisting canyon in which we can lose the Star Moth - we're smaller and more agile. Taz tips the ship steeply down towards the canyon; as he makes his move, the wings slow, fold back and lock into place for fast flight; we're out of the station atmosphere bubble and our speed increases.

What happens next amounts to a performance for Taz - a dance, in tune with the ship. The rest of us just hold on as best we can as Taz plunges the ship into the canyon! It's a wild, wild ride.

* The first performance/navigation check is 8+9+BFS only 1, which gets him to 18. (It amounts to ship AC for the round in our mechanics; its baseline is otherwise AC 15). The Star Moth is closing and, apparently, now in weapons range; it fires but misses thanks to the dodging (rolled a 15). The Star Moth's oblique inbound course flattens out into a level pursuit, so we begin to pull away.
* The next turn is very difficult - nat 1 rolled; BFS +4, though, total 14. Fortunately, the Star Moth gets no clear line of sight (very low attack roll) and a beam sears the canyon wall to starboard.
* A little better on the next one; 16; but the Star Moth gets a glancing hit, carving along the side of the ship's hull as we're turning. 5d10->30 damage. The ship shudders heavily but there's no fire we can see and the wings look functional. We're drawing to long range now.
* Fourth difficult dodge, still rolling low; 17. Star Moth's disadvantaged by distance; misses (rolled 16).
* We're nearly clear - one more - another low roll; 15. The Star Moth hits again. 28 damage. Something metal is sheared off the ship, narrowly missing Gnog's head as it tumbles away. Taz detects wing damage and hopes it won't affect Ravnica landing.
* In shock, after that turn, all we can see is a wall of rock - the goblins shout to warn Taz of a sharp dive straight ahead - straight down! With that warning, he navigates in time (14+9->23, DC was 20) spinning upside down and arcing down sharply; we end up down in a sharp tunnel directly below this canyon.

The Star Moth tries to follow. We sees it smash straight into the cliff - there's an almighty explosion. We don't know if it's fully destroyed, but it'll certainly be disabled if not. Gnog whirls around and asks, "Where does this go?" - "Turn the lights on!" say the goblins - "We don't *have* any lights!" - so quick-thinking Fee-Ree runs to the bow and casts Sunbeam. It actually sears the tunnel walls where it hits, but it's certainly good enough to navigate! We're led out, emerging out of the moon quite some distance away.

It looks like the remaining three Star Moths are withdrawing; then we see them jump away; but we can see a field of debris glittering in the dark above the stricken station.

The goblins say, "We must go back and help!". Gnog replies, "No argument; without the Star Moths we're fine" - so we spin and return.

It's horrifying. There's wreckage everywhere. We can see from a distance that the dock's destroyed and it looks like all hangars are destroyed too. No ship is left on the ground or in dock; the air is thick with debris. We check to see if there are any people floating to save... All we see are dead bodies.

This is an image that will stay with us all for some time.

As the ship approaches the station air bubble the wings move to atmosphere flight position but only three of the four deploy, the other staying locked in fast flight position. Taz warns us of a bumpy landing. With less control on one side and the asymmetric drag, the ship comes down in an increasingly rapid spin, and Taz has to set down on bare rock; it's a sharp thump, skidding and scraping a circle in the dirt, but we're in one piece. The goblins say they must leave to help. Before he goes, Taz tries to heal our injured goblin, L2, but rolls two 1s again, only 7; better than nothing. We chase out, towards injured all around the ruined landing zone. Gnog sees a healer at work and offers a Greater healing potion, but the healer really wants needs ones. Taz has just one. He gives that away. Deni has a couple. Fee-Ree has two as well; five in all.

Then Deni says, tentatively... "If Garren were here, he would be able to mass-heal... Can we try to contact him?" It could be worth a go. Taz looks to the party; he uses his intrinsic Bless for all three, throws bardic inspiration at them; we all try straight-up wisdom checks, plus d4, plus d8 rolled as advantage.

* Deni 16 with bless->21 with bardic
* Fee-Ree 19 with bless->27 with bardic
* Gnog only 14 with bless->22

Fee-Ree's connection is strong. We see an actual, strange, literal spark in her eyes; and then they glow. We'd only seen this in Kaya and Nissa. Then they glow a brilliant, bright white; the colour of Garren's magic; there's a wash of calm and peace, a feeling of protection, that ripples out from us. It is Garren, and Bahamut, and all his other incarnations, descended here on Ravnica. A wave of healing energy shoots out. It seems to all be channelled through Taz. After the effect passes, Taz is clearly heavily drained by the effort; he falls to the floor, awake and conscious, but damaged.

"Thank you, old friend" whispers Gnog to the sky, while running over to help lift up Taz. "*Thank you*, old friend", he says again - this time to Taz directly.

Everyone is taking stock. Only small ships could ever land here for now, on bare rock; there's no dock to use otherwise. It doesn't take long for people at the station to determine that there are *no ships left at all* other than ours. They take stock of food, breaking into long-term station stores; a few days worth, maybe a week, but more if able to use stock in taverns and inns within the station. Of course, they will help; the market keepers will all open stores and distribute whatever they have. People pull together. The people trapped here have enough to live for a fair while - but they're still stranded.

Taz uses Sending to Ridani on the still-this-plane Alliance ship. "Star Moths withdrawn. One destroyed. No ships left for evacuation. Star dock destroyed. Please send alliance assistance in small craft, with food to station." (24) The reply, "Copy that. Glad you're Fine. Message Understood. Will mobilise Alliance to rescue of evacuees. Infinite Consortium must pay for crimes against multiverse. This is war!" (25) - Taz relays so people know they just need to hang on for maybe 3-4 days for travel out of Guildspace, to the Astral Sea and back.

We have to short-rest. It allows for some healing for ourselves.

There's no way to send word down to Ravnica. We can at least wait now, until dark; no need for a power dive into the atmosphere, or hiding in clouds. That, at least, is a relief; given the wing damage, it would probably have been fatal if we'd been forced into Ravnican atmosphere after the Star Moth chase. Either way, once down, we'll need to hustle to make sure we meet Ajani in time. 

The goblins help with repairs; the wing damage is prioritised; damage is patched, if not pretty. The ship is mended and safe to take down. Those guys are quite simply *legends*.

The time comes when we have to return. It feels almost callous, to take the one working ship and leave, but we have no choice. We ask if any one medium, or two small people might want to return with us? An emissary from the station will come. "We need to tell them that they're on their own. All the ships that could take people outside of Ravnica without magic have been destroyed. Anyone on Ravnica without plane walking is stuck there."

The five of us clamber aboard and follow the original, safe flight plan around 8pm. We get down to the tunnel we prepared; thanks to repairs navigation is easy and we land safely in our hidden spot. Between the cart left with the goblin lady down the tunnel and the floating disk, by about 9pm we're on the surface, everything loaded and just outside P4. We escort the station emissary. Deni says en route, "Isn't it ridiculous, that we even care about those now? After what happened up there. But I know this is important. What was that even about, up there?!" The emissary thinks there was more going on that just "finding the alliance". "It was a surgical, precise attack. They targeted *every* ship and the dock infrastructure, specifically. That's why I had to come down here. I had to let Levisha know - one single attack, taking just a few minutes, has cut Ravnica off from the rest of the multiverse."

We insist on being an escort, given the import of all this. From the P4 Northern edge, we pretty much have to go past Nivix anyway, to carry on down to Tenth District Plaza in P1 and reach the Chamber Of The Guildpact. So, we drop the crystals off, using the paperwork to make sure they get up to Ral; we don't stop to chat; we head straight down with the emissary to the Chamber. We have to *demand* to see Levisha, using our investigation powers. Taz persuasion 26; she's there, but essentially "off duty" and at home in her personal chambers. We're taken there directly. We bring her up to speed. The emissary doing most of the talking. She starts saying, "We need Jace!" and continues, but we stop her and ask to go a room like last time; in fact, she can activate Non-Detection on her chambers. Before we can speak, she says to us all, "Look, I'll speak plainly. You're very lucky to have escaped." The emissary responds, "Yes, that wasn't part of the Consortium's plans." he looks to us; "Your arrival and insistence that Ridani prep the ship is the only thing that saved them too. If you hadn't been there, *everything* would be gone and nobody would have got word out. People on the station would've starved and Ranvica would stay cut off. Now, at least, there is hope. Also - *you* have the last remaining planar ship on this world..."

We thank him for his words, ask if he has anywhere he can stay; Levisha says "he'll be staying here". We warn the emissary that if he overhears the next thing he'd be at risk and he's happy to leave, apparently already knowing where Levisha meant for him to go. Once we have privacy, we let Levisha know Jace is found, on Amonkeht. She's surprised; they'd looked there; we don't go into details about Nicol Bolas as she doesn't know about it and we don't want to burden her. Even as-is, she reckons she won't get more sleep!

She insists we stay at the same place as the emissary for safety. It turns out to be a hotel right next to the Chamber. It is a heavily-guarded place for visiting dignitaries (hilarious, in our case). "**Parun's Repose**". So, we get to the room; a diplomat room, no less, beautiful perhaps, but Gnog doesn't really notice; Gnog just sits heavily in a chair, taking a moment, not saying much. The others behave the same. Deni says, "Um. I'm going to have a shower...?" "Good idea". Gnog checks over Taz carefully, exterior casing despite mending is dented and scratched, Fee-Ree's helping with that and Gnog gets to polishing. Choking up a bit on his words with emotion, Gnog just says, "Brave fight today, little friend. And damn good flying."

There's a knock at the door. Six guards! Gnog almost jumps for his weapon. They introduce themselves. They insist we can sleep safe and sound. They're appointed by the Hall Of The Guild Pact to defend us with their lives. "I hope it doesn't come to that!" says Gnog. It's an honour guard; independent of the Guilds. Gnog asks that in the unlikely event anyone does come for us, they are to awaken us to join the fight immediately and not tackle them alone - they might not be prepared for the power of the enemies we face. It is agreed. They'll be stationed outside on a watch rotation of no more than three hours each.

We realise there's food already in the room - that's welcome! We eat, we shower, and we collapse into bed.

### A Feat! We all get Gift Of The Metallic Dragon. XP 3000; 1500 with gifting, Taz 7500 => TAZ LEVEL 10 (he takes Bard again, so Warlock 2, Bard 8)

The gift of a feat arises from our connection with Bahamut.

* Gnog ties it to Wisdom, +3
* Taz ties it to Charisma, +5
* Deni ties it to Intelligence, +2
* Fee-Ree ties it to Charisma, +5



## Day 43 (Ravnica 23, Riglan 80 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Saturday (7 day week)

* Ajani is due *today* after sunrise, at Skarrg.

We awaken, kinda sore and a bit fucked up, at the strange (and grand!) diplomatic quarters in P1. Gnog appreciates the amazing room rather more in the light of day after his sleep.

Taz looks surprisingly chipper; he's reattuned to his Dulcimer, instead of the helm; says he's got some new spell ideas and feels stronger than ever. But he thinks that maybe his shield isn't working so well for him and he keeps getting dented - he wonders, if it might be possible to find some kind of lightweight armour?

We're given breakfast and bid farewell, thanking Levinia. We head out to P1 and ask at a few shops about armour. We end up buying a breastplate +1 for 800gp, but they say it'll need special fitting for an autognome. Taz persuasion 31, that manages to get right down to 720gp. It's one that they hadn't finished repairing and has a few issues, but we're going to be needing mods anyway. Interestingly, there's also a +1 shield, slightly beaten up but still sturdy, which our bargaining powers get down to 225gp, but after a bit more to and fro, they agree on 900gp (with the old shield in exchange).

They recommend maybe P6 or Nivix for adjustments. We know we need to get to Skarrg, but P6 sounds like a less experimental and explode-y option. We hurry over to P6 and track down the factory that we'd helped, since we know people there and after asking around we end up finding people that can help. They say it'll take an hour - which seems quick - lots of welding and melding and measuring, but one hour and only 25gp later, Taz is fitted with his shiny new breastplate and his slightly cleaned up and customised (especially the handle) shield.

He's very happy! His AC isn't far off Gnog now.

Without further ado we set off East towards the Transguild Promenade, as an access to Skarrg. On our way through P4, there's a lot of activity. A quite serious-looking war party is coming back in and headed towards Sunhome, carrying injured on stretchers.

We drop off the Promenade and onto the Wastes just outside. We have to come off about a little over a block away, but then we're halted by large throngs of people. We've not seen it busy like this before; it's a thick, large crowd of impassable bodies. We go back up to the Promenade to try and see what's going on! There are numerous encampments. The Gruul have taken over several city blocks here, with some areas - such as the one we descended to - particularly densely populated. After watching a while, we start to see 'rivers' of people in areas moving through and realise we can get by, just very slowly. As it happens, even the Transguild Promenade here is busy and slow, with lots of security checks.

The trouble is, we don't know where to go. We were thinking we could scout around and get a feel for it outside, but we don't understand *why* it's this busy. Gnog figures, ask someone! So we dive back into the fray and Gnog sort of picks someone at random who seems to be standing around. Persuasion only 7+7->14. The response makes no sense at all, as if they were answering a completely different question from the one we asked. It's kind of chaos really, and since people aren't working coherently to get somewhere, they're kind of bouncing around off each other. Gnog tries one more time. He has to push into the crowd - telling the others to wait - athletics 25, to find a taller person that might know what they're doing. A minotaur. Gnog calls, "Warrior! What is it you seek in Skarrg? And why should you get there before someone as mighty as myself?" - intimidation 25. Gnog overhears chatter of "they've arrived! They arrived last night" while this happens. The Minotaur actually yields to one side; "If you must, you may have this space. But we will eventually *all* reach the centre. Once the gates to Skarrg open. Today there will be a challenge. The first time in the open for many years!" He overhears things about "he will not come, he will yield his strength!" - Gnog takes a punt. He shouts, "Boboremos would yield to noone!" and there are cries of agreement. Viashino start to argue back; "Power of the old ways" is mentioned; that's enough for Gnog to get a fair idea. He pulls back and gets to his party and explains - it's Boboremos and Nikya.

Or at least (perception 12+8->20) he *would* explain except Deni's not there. "Where's Deni?!" - and Gnog looking up, sees that Deni has scaled a nearby building - she's beckoning. Gnog points and says, "Up there!" and we head that way. She points down to stairs - sort of; they're crumbled and risky but we make it. At the top, Fee-Ree has a hasty wardrobe change (!) from a gown into pants. She'd worn the wrong thing today...

Deni shows a rooftop route. Gnog's not keen but before he gets much of a chance to object, she says to Taz "Parkour?!" and of course it's all over after that. Off we go. Deni makes the first jump; "Yep, safe!" she says. Well, she would.

* Taz Acro 15 -> OK
* Gnog Athl 20 -> OK
* Fee-Ree misses - and has to fly. "...I think I'll just do this!"

Next one. We take Deni's lead from hop to hop. Fortunately, quite often we can just do short runs and jumps, but we do then get to a wide road between two buildings - a tricky one (DC20).

* Taz Acro 18 + BFS 2 -> exactly 20 -> OK
* Gnog rages, Athl adv. 4,16+10 -> OK

There's one last big leap to Skarrg. Gnog grabs Taz at Deni's request and does a 40ft jump-fly to get onto a wall at the edge. Taz gives him inspiration - he's nervous!

* Gnog Athl adv. 18 total + inspiration D8->8 fortunately, 26, DC 25 -> OK
* Deni just scrapes it too
* Fee-Ree is already there, looking at us kind of unimpressed

We're on an exterior wall of Skarrg. "Fair enough Deni, sketchy but fast!"

We can see inside. There are more encampments in there and a huge tent. Various minotaurs stand guard at interior gates to the main palace, seemingly at a stand-off against groups outside in the courtyard within the walls of Skarrg but outside the main palace. Centaurs, giants, minotaurs and more are camped there. Beyond the walls, we can see numerous groups of all kinds some of whom are fighting; goblins have started a fire of course; and so-on.

With a spyglass, we try to search the crowd for more. Gnog, perception 27, Taz with spyglass investigation 17. Just at the edge of view, just above some large tents, is a smaller, different style one built onto where a defensive wall once would have been but it's crumbled now. He sees a brief glimpse of a person with a mass of white fur or hair, maybe a mane - could be Ajani. More, he sees Nikya, in the main compound surrounded by at least four druids of the old ways; they are dressed in deep red wastes clothing and have huge beasts of burden with them. A long journey, clearly.

He points her out and asks if Ajani has white fur? Saw a white furry creature in a distant tent. Deni thinks so. Right then, best we've got; head for that tent. More of a lean-to really. We make our way over. Fee-Ree asks how Kaya and Nissa would ever find us! We'll have to do something like using Message and then rearranging the meeting point. It's slow going and we have to dodge around the odd look-out, but our clothes and purposeful movements seem to work as a bluff that we're meant to be here (we are, after a fashion!). It's a good spot he's found - quite elevated and easily defended.

Deni up front, Gnog helping Taz, Fee-Ree. Gnog turns a corner to see Deni with her hands up, as if to say "I'm not a threat". He sees a huge weapon first; it's like his greataxe, only twice as long and with blades at either end. Gnog calls, "I hope you're Ajani" - a huge, 7.5" tall, hyper-muscular albino leonin. Far larger than Theranos (of Eberron) - "because if not, you're way bigger and more scary than any *other* Leonin I've seen." "That is I. Ajani Goldmane." "My name is Gnog, that there is Deni - " and so-on. Gnog introduces us, contracts Deni who's trying to say "I'm not armed!" "No, she's armed to the teeth, we all are! Honesty Deni..." - and mentions Nissa. At this the weapon is immediately withdrawn and he pulls Deni up.

We talk about why we're here, waiting for Nissa and Kaya; he casts some kind of spell that'll help Nissa find her. It throws up a bright, glorious beacon, illuminating the clouds. There are even god rays. Oh lordy. "Ah. We said Skarrg for a low profi - oh, never mind!"

He stands there, gazing into the mid distance, cloak and male flowing in the breeze, beam of light above his head illuminating the clouds; "Nissa will find us".

Gnog turns to his party, "he's almost tediously glorious, I'm not sure how to deal with it" - and Gnog looks down into Skarrg - "but we do seem to have attracted considerable attention, I think the assembled crowds might be aware we're not necessarily with the Gruul." He thinks he'll blend in (!). People are gathering below, intrigued. Two centaurs start to trot towards the wall. One calls up. "You up there! Who are you with? Do you bow to the old ways or are you the children disconnected from the songs of the world, lost." Gnog calls back, "Your question is loaded. We have no allegiance beyond that of the wilds and of Ravnica. I wonder, though, if Boboremos would lower himself to such a grotesque, public spectacle as this?" "Authority must be challenged in the open. Strength laid bare for all to judge." Gnog shouts down, "Very true. And challenging Nikya's authority but not even deigning to waste time on her challenge - did he not already defeat her champions just a few weeks ago?" "Yes. Her champions - but not herself." We see Nikya herself emerge from the tent and trot towards the palace to call for Boboremos and challenge him to meet her.

Gnog asks Taz to message Boboremos - "I'm no expert but based on the shit going on, I'm unsure your absence is going how you wanted. You might want to change plan!" (25)

Taz after a pause says - "No answer."

The shit-talking from the Nikya crowd continues. She's yelling into the palace and actually does seem angry. His minotaurs, from within, say it's "not time" yet, but Nikya really seems to think he's in the palace.

Gnog's trying to convince Ajani that it's time to head away. But he's talking about being here "for a reason" and so-on. Then suddenly, he shouts, "WE ARE NEEDED" and just jumps down into the fray. "Holy shit, no. Fuck fuck fuck!" says Deni as he does it. Three-point landing, of course. He stands up and shouts, "BACK!" and swings his weapon. "You must stop fighting NOW. There's no need for bloodshed" - and at *that* Gnog facepalms, "oh, shit, you'd think after all that time in the red wastes that he'd know SOMETHING about the Gruul..." - and Gnog rages and fly-jumps down after him, landing alongside. He shouts, "It is not time yet. Shout not at walls and doors."

Nikya turns. "No. It IS time. We've waited too long. The PLANET has waited too long!" - she plants her staff into the ground. Green and red energy bursts out from her, shaking all of Skarrg. "I CALL THEE!" - the ground rumbles - "Boboremos! Answer to your masters!" and a *huge* greatworm bursts out of the ground, crashing through a wall and rubble at the side of Skarrg. Chaos all around, inevitably. Etins had been holding the main external gatesG but the force behind is too great now and the gate collapses fully inwards. The etins and minotaurs are pushed back as the crowd roars into the compound outside the palace. A small group of her defenders, including a druid, seem to have got an eye on us and are heading towards us with some *huge* beasts at their side. Boars - the mammoth sized ones.

Dozens of minotaurs and centaurs clash in the middle of the courtyard as the greatworm rears around and starts to dive in our direction.

"Well, I guess this isn't *too* different from the dream I had, just at Skarrg instead of Precinct One..." thinks Gnog. Fee-Ree flies in and lands nearby. Taz and Deni are staying at range.

Theatre of mind for this one. Initiative:

* Gnog: 19
* Taz: 18
* Deni: 17
* Ajani: 9
* Fee-Ree: 8

Fee-Ree and Gnog feel the emanating aura of courage from Ajani. A little disconcerting for Gnog; it's Garren's aura, yet feels different.

A Vyashino berserker near the druids runs in, wielding a greataxe. He runs towards Ajani and Swings, recklessly; but Ajani dodges. An old-ways druid uses a bone staff and calls forth a fire elemental. A presence seems to emanate; another aura; it seems to be self-protection of some kind. Gnog eyes up the druid - a powerful spellcaster - and the vyashino - a warrior of note - but the Batterboars charging are formidable and, most of all, the greatworm is lethal. Gnog shouts to Fee-Ree "hold things together if you can, I have to tackle that worm!" and draws his greataxe; he charges, jump/flies and tries to land on the worm axe-first, hoping the momentum might give extra damage if he hits. It's a reckless attack. 26 to hit (otherwise 15 without advantage, so reckless was worth it). He gets 23 damage (14+9) from the greataxe (this creature is huge, so it's stronger damage takes). Now Gnog tries to use the momentum to help tear down with the axe; he gets 21 damage, which doesn't seem to be more than he might've got from a normal attack, but it means he's now hanging onto the worm via his weapon, still embedded in it, just about on its back, but it's going to be hard to stay there!

The worm reacts; it tries to throw Gnog off. Contested strength check; not a great roll; Gnog is thrown off (18 vs 22). Dex save fail to land, only 8. Takes 8->4 bludgeoning damage and is prone. The worm moves towards the palace and slams into it.

A Batterboar has swung around a little and is trampling towards Ajani (DC18 strength saving). It tries to gore him but his weapon blocks across its tusks and he makes his save, not being pushed backwards.

Taz is able to Bless his party, but can't reach Ajani; he throws the prone Gnog some bardic inspiration, holding position next to Deni. Deni sees the engaged Batterboar and the worm next to Gnog; but she sees the threatening fire elemental and tries to gain insight on it. She succeeds. She hits. It's alright damage; 40 overall. In response the fire elemental bursts out into flame in all directions, then moves up towards Deni. As it moves, everything its path burns. It can't fly, though, so it can't quite her.

The other Batterboar sees Gnog on the ground and charges at him. It hits (badly). 25->12 piercing. Strength saving 24; he still has a good grip on his axe and the axe is in the worm. He isn't pushed away. It tries to stomp on him but fortunately misses (rolls a 1 and 2!).

A second Berserker sees that Deni attacked the fire elemental and throws a javelin. Taz tries to distract but it still hits. At least he gives her advantage, so she has a better attempt at hitting the elemental next time & can still retreat (rather than needing to take aim). She takes 7 damage.

Ajani sees the general chaos and creates a 50ft wide, 20ft high wall of some kind of blocking force to block off Gnog's part of the battlefield; trying to stop the worm from being able to collapse the palace and kill whoever is inside. It cuts us off from the other side of the battlefield, so others are unlikely to now join our fray. He uses his Daunting Roar; the engaged Battleboar and the berserker near him, along with two others that haven't yet had a chance to engage but are nearby, might become frightened. All of them are too unwise to avoid its effects.

Fee-Ree casts Crown Of Stars. One is sent out at the Fire Elemental; it hits, in fact, technically crits - but out of nowhere, there's a **wild magic surge**! She struggles to control it; the effect is very different from intended; three bolts of lightning crash down from the sky, striking not just the elemental and the two not-yet-moved berserker. The crit 8d12 radiant blast *still* goes out to the fire elemental - 48 damage. Just on the low side of the exact half, but a lot of damage anyway. The lightning then does 22 damage to it; this kills it. One of the berserkers gets hit for 22 as well, while the last berserker is hit for 17.

The first of those two whirls around and throws a spear at her; the first misses. The second does the same and this hits, dealing 6 damage. She's actually still holding concentration on Fly and *just* hold onto the spell.

The now-frightened berserker on Ajani tries to flee. Ajani does not take an opportunity attack. It seems to be trying to be trying to hide from him and cowers behind some rubble. It then recovers, once it can't see him.

The druid looks up at Fee-Ree and throws some kind of blast of nullifying magic at her (Dispel Magic) to throw her out of the sky and possibly dispel the crown too. It would work for both, too, but Fee-Ree reacts quickly; she bends luck, which is enough to stop the effect from working on the crown. Her fly spell is gone along with Taz's lingering effects of Bless, though and she plummets a full 30ft to the rubble below. She just about makes it OK, taking only 3 points of damage.

Gnog stands, runs to try and get within Ajani's aura by running alongside it then resumes his reckless attack on the worm, even though it's cut off from the palace, because it's not cut off from the rest of District 10! He's headed towards its head. The first hits for 16 damage. The second is a *double* critical but the damage roll - despite being 4d6 + 4d12 + 6 - is only 24 (out of 72) + 6.

Unfortunately, this gets the worm's attention. It tries to bite him. The mouth makes the giant Scavver look small! It hits; 24->12 damage, DC 20 dex to avoid being swallowed - 17, but Ajani's aura adds 5, so he makes it. Buildings around are shaking and crumbling, because the worm's disruptions are causing basically a local earthquake. It makes it hard to stand (DC20 dex saves on all creatures for all rounds; buildings start taking 10 force damage).

The Batterboar engaged with Ajani is knocked prone by the quake; it takes damage; it starts to retreat from Ajani, who tries an opportunity attack. He hits for 1d12+6->12 damage. It continues to retreat a bit.

Taz sees the damage and has to risk it - L4 psychic lance on the worm. Intelligence save, DC18; it can't succeed! -4 on int. It takes 28 psychic damage and is stunned. The earthquake movement temporarily stops. Win. He throws bardic inspiration at Ajani. He needs him on our side! Ajani seems delighted.

Deni uses her Silvery Barbs advantage and insightful fighting on the druid. She succeeds, so future attacks she'll still do sneak. With the current advantage anyway, she attacks - and crits. Lowish damage rolls but 65 overall. Deni moves, getting to within 30ft of Ajani - we're all about the aura. She's alongside Taz now.

The other Batterboar - no longer struggling with the wormquake - attacks Gnog. It can't get a full charge. It still has advantage as Gnog's prior attacks were reckless. It gets in a gore attack, dealing 26->13 damage. Another beserker is running, frightened from Ajani. Now it's Ajani's turn (and his fear effect is about to wear off). He looks around and shouts, "I will join you! Together we will take it down!" - and runs towards Gnog (ah, "it" is the worm) to attack the worm. The first requires the inspiration from Taz, but then does hit; the mote of potential from Taz helps give an additional 5 thunder damage (bardic d8 roll was 5). 1d12->1+6, 7 damage, but he also does L3 "improved" divine smite, giving it 7, 7, 6, 7 -> 27 extra radiant damage. Second attack. Another hit. 17 additional damage. He uses the underside of the weapon on the backstroke, but misses that one - it bounces off the tough skin. The worm is looking rough. He smiles at Gnog. "Ah! Sometimes, the redemption is not in pacifying your foe, but in subduing them!"

Fee-Ree dusts herself off and throws one of the crown stars at the druid. Crit! 8d12 -> 50 damage. That wipes out the druid. She then uses two sorcery points to cast Fly again. She takes off, positioning herself close to Gnog and Ajani - in the aura - about 20ft up, 5-ish ft sideways.

The berserkers aren't frightened anymore. The first starts to run towards Gnog and Ajani to attack. It swings a greataxe at Gnog, hitting for 4->2 damage. A second one quickly scrambles up the wall towards Deni and Taz, and swings at Deni - but she dodges. Seeing this, the last one joins; it gets to Taz and attacks him with an axe too. 19 to hit. Clang! Bounces off the new breastplate - AC20! Saved by this morning's purchase. What are the odds!

Gnog shouts back to Ajani, or possibly nobody in particular, "I'll say this about the Gruul - they sure know how to throw a good party" and swings twice at the worm (with ROTC, so no reckless but with advantage). Hits for 18, then crits! Better damage roll; 44; cleaves it so hard, the head is severed. It was still incapacitated by Taz so couldn't do anything.

Before we celebrate too early, the scared Batterboar isn't scared and *is* quite pissed off. It charges at Gnog. It matches AC but Taz holds his Silvery Barbs because there are aggressors very close to both him and Deni. Gnog takes 25->12 damage. Thanks to Ajani's aura yet again, his low roll on the strength save is still success - he isn't moved or knocked prone. The Batterboar can't stomp on him!

Taz is up. He's in melee now. He draws the shortsword with his free hand, hexblades curses the berserker, uses Booming Blade and swings. 24, hit. 1d6+6, +1d8, +4 -> he gets 22 damage, this little autognome, in a single swing! Deni's turn; her and Taz are back-to-back, both facing berserker aggressors in melee range. She drops her longbow, draws her green dragonfang shortsword, tries to gain insight on the berserker - succeeds - and melee attacks. She hits, catching him off guard with her insight knowing just how to get the best out of that hit; 11 from the weapon; fails a con save so is poisoned with 8 poison damage; and takes a further 24 from the sneak damage - 43.

Meanwhile, Gnog gets gored by the other Batterboar because why not; 23->11 damage. Ajani sees the attack land and in reaction channels divinity to rebuke the violent. He calls down a huge blast of radiant fire that slams into the creature, which fails a wisdom saving throw taking the damage it just dealt - so it *dealt* 11. Ajani perhaps expected the 23, not realising how hardy Gnog can be.

The other berserker sees the other two getting almost immediately quite fucked up by Taz and Deni, so instead runs to throw a spear at Fee-Ree in the air. It hits, but only deals 4 damage. She holds Fly.

Ajani attacks the Battleboar, hitting 3 times all with divine smites, for a total of 38 on the first, 28 on the second and 33 on the last. It's still up but on its last legs. Even Gnog has to be impressed by *that* display of fighting prowess.

Fee-Ree throws a star at the Berserker that's on Taz. It hits, dealing 4d12->20 damage. She shouts, "Deni, looks like you've got it under control?" "Maybe a bit of help?!" so she twins a level 2 Chromatic Orb at each of the two Berserkers, again for the one on Taz and the one on Deni. Both hit, 3d8 each time; 17 for the one on Taz, and 17 again felling the one on Deni outright.

The berserker on the ground once again throws another spear; but it misses. The berserker on Taz attacks, but again the new armour deflects.

There's a very injured Batterboars next to Gnog - he recklessly attacks it to try and take it down. Hits, 21 damage, it falls. He moves to attack the other now, and does hit but only for 15 damage on this one.

Taz continues attacking the berserker, again with booming blade. Hit.  1d6+6, +1d8, +4 -> he gets 22 damage, same as last time! Exact same rolls. Loud boom; the berserker dies. He sheathes the weapon - with a bit of a flourish! With a bonus action, he inspires Deni to take down whomever she might choose.

There are actually two berserkers left (yeah, I've not really got that right in the notes above). She drops her shortsword, grabs the longbow, aims at the injured of the two and attacks. She hits for 39 damage. It's nearly down, but not quite.

The remaining Battleboar goes for Gnog, hitting for what would be 24->12 damage, but Ajani uses Aura Of The Guardian in reaction and takes the damage instead. Gnog calls out, "Wow, thanks, but no need, honestly, I'm fine". Ajani has actually taken *no* damage until now, "No, you are injured - I am not - share the burden, friend."

Coming kind of out of nowhere, suddenly the uninjured berserker runs in, pulling a greataxe and charges at Gnog, but it misses wildly. Ajani responds, hitting all three times; 13, 23, 11 damage. Fee-Ree joins in too, throwing a star - the crown now running a bit low - hitting for another 13 damage. She throws an Eldritch Blast, but only one of the three beams hits - the same one, who is attacking Gnog; 8 damage - and that takes him down.

The remaining berserker runs over towards Gnog and Ajani, but once it's within 10ft of Ajani he uses some kind of opportunity attack and hits it for 17, dropping the guy before he even reaches us.

One Batterboar left. Gnog is a little sad to kill all the creatures, but they're enraged. He is about to swing, but then thinks he'll take a punt. **Animal handling** - 17+8 -> 25. Ajani's aura is helping too. The boar calms. He tries to communicate via his animal handling check - he's spoken to beasts often enough, the ways of some in body language are more familiar now; he encourages it to return to the wild. It turns; he smacks it with the flat of his axe; it charges back out, away from Skarrg, to its home in the wastes. He doesn't know if any other Gruul saw that, but hopes so. In fact, Ajani was dropping the wall of force as it calmed, so some must've seen.

Gnog calls to Taz. "Can you amplify my voice? Going to shout 'Nikya', just that will do!" - Taz users Minor Illusion to try and aid Gnog's shout. His voice rings loud and clear over the chaos around.

With his party around, he hollers "NIKYA!"

He stands, pointing in fury at the dead worm.

"Nikya. Look! See! Witness! You and your followers. **This** is what happens! We were forced to kill that beautiful, innocent creature lest it consume all of us here and all around it, and in the city beyond. It was just following its nature - but you lured it here - and now it is dead. What a waste! This did not need to happen. Why must you follow this path of self-destruction? You kill not only yourself and your followers, but by consequence of your actions, you kill the very creatures you purport to save. The old ways are valuable, but only in the lessons they teach us - we learn and evolve, we do not mindlessly repeat mistakes of the past!"

Persuasion, flat roll, is good; 21, +4 bless for 25. Some of them are swayed and stops. Nikya is of course not swayed. "You once again fail to understand the old ways. You try to tame the chaos and shackle the spirit, dull the fire, quench the passion of this world. You will never understand. And YOU!" She points at the others. "You sheep! You follow false gods. Forsake the old ways. You condemn to death these creatures of greatness, instead of letting them rule this world which rightfully belongs TO THEM. **This is not the end!**" - she sticks her staff in the ground; it opens up and the hydra emerges; she rides it, "Borboremos. You are a coward. You have lost your people today. You have lost your way. There is only one future. There is only way one path. Freedom. FREEDOM!" and as the hydra pulls back down into the portal, she continues repeating the word. It rings in the air, but all around is just carnage.

Piles of dead. Destruction everywhere.

In the midst, badly injured but standing, is Boboremos himself. We learn later that he appeared once his people were being attacked. We approach.

A huge wild growth of trees and shrubs and flowers are visible. At this, Gnog shouts, "Nissa?!" - in the midst of it all, a shining beacon of life energy, healing all those around her, she stands. "Nissa! Wow. You're here! And you're OK!" - Kaya stands atop a giant with a boar next to her, cleaning off a blade, her eyes returning to normal colour. "Kaya too! I'm so glad to see you're OK!"

Ajani walks forward, calm, shining with radiant light. A pulse of healing emanates out, helping injured further. He heads to revive a few people, those who are not beyond it.

Gnog approaches Boboremos. He knees. "I can't choose a guild, and I shouldn't take sides. But while Nikya's heart is true, her methods are not. We are aligned with you, king." Boboremos says "Rise, small giant". Gnog stands. "We bow to noone. It means a lot to me and to us that you would come to the aid of the Gruul and push back against those who would seek to lead us astray. I know not the path that you take, but you can have the wildness and strength of the Gruul at your side. We pledge to walk over the fires together, in the same direction, to the same firey setting sun."

The suriving Gruul raise weapons and cheer; it ripples out, like wildfire, *thousands* of Gruul, dozens of tribes. United. The sound is incredible.

Nissa is beaming with pride. "I have seen this before!" she says. "This is people coming together. Not because of a shared belief or blood, but because of a shared conviction in what is right - in those who cannot defend themselves..." - Kaya is a bit salty but admits was fun.

Gnog says, "I'm sorry, we had no idea this was going to happen, but it seems a good outcome. This is Ajaji, everyone!" Ajani says, "This is clearly what was meant to be. An act of the heavens. The sacrifice must not be in vain. We will tend to those are wounded. We will remember their fallen." He raises his weapon and another beam of light shoots up. "Let us fight no more today." Weapons are laid down on both sides.

Taz blows remaining spells on mass healings and so-forth to help. The whole party use their feat Cure Wounds, too, and help with mundane things like bandages, repairing weapons, anything we can do.

The Gruul decide to fortify around Skarrg. They've never come together like this before. But their very clan fabric was threatened - the madness that took them is evidenced in the piles of dead that have been - respectfully, as far as possible, piled to the sides - and are galvanised. Boboremos says, "Send word that they are to bring food for themselves. We most not further burden this district and its land. It grows nothing here. What has happened today, this news will spread. The tribes will come. Clear out the rubble. We will need more space for those who arrive!"

Later quietly to Gnog, "There is much you have done but one thing more I must ask of you. My people seek shelter here, to band together in a way we have not done for centuries. Could you perhaps speak to the Boros, such that they will stop harassing us? As more clans arrive, the tensions too will rise with the Boros nearby." Gnog answers, "Give me your word, as best you can, that you will not allow attacks into P4." Boboremos pledges that they will not cross boundary roads to P3 or P4, filling the wastes instead. Gnog says, "Then that word is enough. I shall speak for you." Nissa says she'll speak to the Selesnyans, too; this is not an army at their doorstep - if anything it's the first sign of stability we've seen in months. Ajani will speak to Aurelia. He heads off. Nissa too. But just before departing they look to each other, then to Gnog. "Was this the purpose, in some way, that you called us together? Where shall we meet again?"

The best guess we can make is Skarrg; our only known safe ground, remarkably. Just as Nissa is leaving, Gnog quickly runs up and quietly just says to her, "I hate to break the mood, but you need to know - Ravnica station was attacked by Star Moths, all ships and docks destroyed. The station will receive aid from the Alliance soon, but we have the only functioning starship on this planet right now. Until any of that can be fixed, we're on our own."

Kaya says that she'd support a meeting, if Lavisha called one - perhaps now is the time for that. Gnog agrees. He'll speak. He also tells Kaya what he told Nissa. Later he spends some time bringing Ajani up to speed about Gatewatch and so-on as we're walking off as a group towards Sunhome - we'll catch up with Feather, we need to break the news to Aurelio, then see Levinia.

### 4500 XP each. After some discussion, we can't deny how invaluable Taz is being. 2250 each and 11250 to Taz.

We reach Sunhome. Ajani heads off his way and we head up to see Feather, using the 'front door' route with our investigation pins. We bring her up to speed briefly on pretty much everything - Nicol, Tesseret, Disruptor, guild disturbances but Gruul settling, Selesenya hopefully close behind, Jace found & hopefully inbound, but invasion imminent. The TL;DR is to continue to try and keep things together *internally* with the Boros, and especially try to avoid skirmishes with the Gruul.

Feather has one significant piece of information - she thinks she has a lead on the location of Tesseret. She's seen patterns in movements. For some reason, whatever it might mean, he's entering and exiting various warehouses in P6 a lot. The pattern is that **all the warehouses belong to House Karlov**. Now, they do own a disproportionate number of them, but even so, he seems to be using them as places to hide things. Don't know if it's with permission, or even if it's a deliberate pattern established as a trap.

We cut across next to find Aurelio and break the news about Ravnica Station but also mention that his reports were instrumental in part in the evacuation which saved the Alliance cruiser. We bid mutual farewells.

It's very busy. Almost shrill; an air of desperation. The people officiating are doing the best they can to stop it getting totally out of hand here. It's thankless. We don't insist on seeing Levisha now; there's a slot we can book tomorrow, which is early enough; 10am, perfect. We book that in and thank them, then get out of their way.

Taz has no spells left after all the healing, so we'll have to message Kaya tomorrow with information on Tesseret found by Feather. She's probably neck-deep in tasks with the Orzhov anyway and their own parts they have to play.

Gnog feels at a loss for a while, but we're tired. The party is run down. It's been a very intense 24 hours or so. We've been through worse but that doesn't mean we keep driving; it seems we are almost forced to take time out. It's late afternoon. Gnog says, "Anyone got a favourite tavern or bar, a place to just hang out a while? Get some drinks, maybe food?"

In the end we decide on south of Zonot Seven; touristy perhaps, but unbeatable views! We meander in that direction, via Merodi Park in practice, eventually finding a quaint, small, tucked-away part amidst the great bridges; there's a smaller, cheaper place and one more upmarket. Gnog enquires about the cheap place; "**Rainbow Falls**". They have bathrooms *per floor* which is perhaps what Deni is starting to like, but there's just something about the manner of the desk clerk which is endearing and we end up going for a 3-bed room. We ask about the best views! All roughly the same; but to look to the Zonot an upper floor is better. There's a room on sixth floor - downwards. Great! Thanks. 

A restaurant and communal area with a bar is all above ground, with all rooms underneath. The higher ones look over bridges and the lower ones look *underneath* them to the Zonot. We can see the various falls on either side clearly. The spray creates a permanent rainbow. Not bad for a night, for sure. The mist in the air and movement from the waterfalls makes it a bit cooler, which Gnog appreciates. The white noise in practice isn't intrusive or too loud; more just restful.

We set up in the room. Deni has to slum it in shared bathrooms on the floor, but of course it's fine. There are rows of toilets in a shared area, with communal baths fed from the main rivers which are crystal clear and constantly renewed. It ends up feeling like a spa of sorts! Just not fancy - Deni actually really likes it. There are various holidaymakers here, and occasionally we meet students who have saved up and are splashing out, no pun intended.

We while away the hours in the bar area, trying to relax. Gnog finds that it's not the Gruul fight in his head - the thing he can't shake is a snapshot, of the first thing he saw on return to the station as we went through the debris field and he just saw bodies floating by in space. Wisdom saving for all:

* Taz 22 - relaxes
* Gnog 25 - relaxes
* Deni 20+ - relaxes
* Fee-Ree 20+ - relaxes

Amazing rolls and consistent dice. It seems that this is the place to heal us. We are able to push worries away for a little while and actually unwind. Taz gets the dulcimer after a while - the bar has no musician - and just idly strums as we relax, chat and drink. We end up spending about a Zino across the three of us; cheap food and drink here, but all pretty decent. All drinks come with little paper umbrellas on sticks, even the ale! Must just be a thing they do - the students mentioned it, too. The bar is brightly painted, doubling down on the rainbow theme it seems.

Eventually, the sun sets. There's a beautiful display of colours changing in the mists and reflections. The tracking motion of the rainbows becomes, we fancy, even actually visible to the eye while watching - though probably it's a bit too slow for that. The light sources switch over, as the lights from Zonot Seven become more visible. It's a beautiful transition.

It gets more lively. We learn why the tavern is up top, above the sleeping floors! It gets quite lively and loud. We just sort of sit quietly soaking it in and eventually return to the room to crash out. Deni puts an alarm up and Taz is on standby watch as usual, so we figure we can sleep without watch.
