# Gnog: Part 12
## Day 34 (Riglan 71 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Thursday (7 day week)

We wake up early on the elevated platform in tents, quickly pack up and head to the garden and nearby cottages of the caretakers to catch up with Ptolomy at the end of his shift. His friend is in the cottage - Ptolomy isn't back yet - so we head out to find Ptolomy. Taz (+ Gnog) adv. investigation 22. Can't find him. Sinking feeling.

We make haste to the warehouse; still locked; check inside; crates are still there. Lock back up, back to the cottage. He's not there still. Gnog finds a willing bird and spends a while on the whole Speak With Animals / Beast Sense thing. It turns out that it's easier to just go straight to Animal Handling (26) and not spend time on SWA. Some staff are already arriving at the restaurant, we note; the first shift is coming in. The bird flies around, covering quite a lot of ground at some altitude; Gnog perception 23; some people from the restaurant are *running* towards a small building where someone is standing, waving in distress. Gnog disengages and we run immediately in that direction. It's the entrance to Engineering.

A goblin we don't recognise is there, yelling in distress; "Something's happened! It's not me! It's not me!" - we run down the stairs without waiting for more. Streaks of blood over the equipment. A half-eaten sandwich on the ground. Perception 24; there was an altercation, a struggle. Things are pulled onto the ground. Hasty. There's enough blood to indicate stabbing and a drag mark. A pin with a scrap of paper is on the notice board where the day shift note would have been. The drag heads up stairs. So we run back up. Gnog shows the investigation pins to the staff. Reassures the goblin that we know it wasn't him and are very sorry that he's witnessed this. We ask the staff to call for Boros assistance immediately; the goblin and one of the restaurant staff - so the goblin isn't alone - head down to make sure the platform is kept stable.

The Azorious, in fact, have been alerted by the restaurant staff. Taz uses Message to alert Feather, ending, "urgent please assist". Message response is "On my way with help. If you're there, I'll find you, if not, we'll catch up later." With that, we run for the airship. An assailant might've tried to escape on the first ship down.

Gnog gets 24 athl, Taz much lower so Gnog carries him! Taz is shouting to the airship to get it to hold (persuasion 28). Deni's far ahead, running full tilt; Fee-Ree has to use a fly spell. We make it, just! The crew try to calm us down, but we show the investigation pin, "We need to see the captain immediately." We're taken to the helm, which is sort of in front of and below the forward first class section. We explain, quickly. We want to search the ship. Nobody turned up that was meant to today - well, no, because of what we just saw... There was someone. A woman. Tall, beautiful, dark skin, but the conductor can't remember if she came on board... She came up, with the other staff. But she didn't come back on board. Just cargo. We ask to see the cargo, cursing, because **Kaya** might well be up on the platform right now covering tracks.

We see the cargo; lots of normal stuff - and yes, familiar crates. But we saw them in the weather station! A switch? Or were they hastily moved while we searched?

**Dex save!** Gnog 23, Taz 7; the ship lurches. He is thrown sideways. The crew grab things; Deni and Fee-Ree hold their grip. Gnog says, "I do believe we should return to the helm at pace!" - we try but it's difficult, the ship is pitched down so violently. We're sliding downhill essentially. Gnog almost falls and slips (athl nat 1+10) trying to grab Taz, who is rolling around like a tin can but with luck manages to catch a chair leg just in time (athl 27). Back at the helm, the captain's face is ashen, looking in horror but *dead* - as if he saw something so horrible that it killed him. We have to pull out of the crash dive. Taz has to try a Navigation roll with BFS 1, scrapes 17 but Fee-Ree bends luck and a +4 on the d4 gives 21. He manages to pull out of the nose dive. Something's wrong though, it's damaged or resisting; in fact if anything, the bow is now trying to pitch *up* as if we're being dragged at the stern.

Gnog asks Fee-Ree if she has enough Fly left to take a look. A minute later, she returns having gone onto the balcony. The whole of the back of the balloon is ruptured, gas escaping rapidly. Gnog asks the crew how many are aboard. Two crew, one engineer and the four of us. Fee-Ree - how many can you teleport. 8. We can do that as a last resort. Gnog shouts to Taz to Send again to Feather - "Airship sabotaged, crashing to south Precinct 3. Captain dead. Clear ground beneath if you can; we have Teleport to save crew as last resort." No answer.

We're well below cloud cover now, more or less falling at this point. We think we're going to be crashing down into the boundary between P3 and P2. Gnog asks Taz to focus if he can pulling us more into the lower section of P3 with a lower population. He does his best; navigation: only 15, which is enough now he knows the controls, but we're heavier and heavier as gas escapes and forward momentum is slowing, lessening the effectiveness of its control surfaces. We are falling fast vertically now, with Taz increasingly unable to exert any significant control. Our speed now becomes frightening, with a high pitched whisle of wind around the balcony railings and control surfaces - we have to shout to hear each other. In an inspired moment, Fee-Ree casts L5 Bigby's Hand to try and keep underneath the stern, to turn our vertical movement into diagonal, slowing descent and give us a bit more coasting distance to Precinct 3. There's a lurch as the bow dips and stern lifts somewhat, Taz has a moment to shout, "Yes, thats working!", but shortly after there is a loud crack and juddering sideways slew; Taz says he's lost any control on the port side; he thinks that the speed must have torn off one of the attitude fins. The ship is slewing to starboard and rotating slightly as the relatively higher drag on that side pulls it. The situation is dire.

Gnog perception 16, something in the corner of his eye; something flying away from the ship. A figure, very fast. They've jumped. At the same time, in the opposite direction, **angels**, headed our way - with felidar too. We have a chance! Gnog runs onto the port helm balcony to try and see who jumped. A woman, slim, big hair, sounds like the person the conductor described. She turns her head back to the dirigible, sees Gnog, lifts a hand to wave, then power dives straight down. At the last minute, spectral wings appear around her and she soars and glide out in amongst the dense buildings of P2, out of sight. That's one for the precogs! There's a face now, etched into Gnog's memory.

There's a loud thump and a shudder; the Felidar are gripping the dirigible. Gnog shouts down to the angels underneath, asking if they are strong enough to drop us down into a plaza on P3? A familiar voice answers - it's Feather! - "No problem!" and, along with Bigby's Hand, we're slowed and lowered eventually onto the Create Concourse of all things, having travelled further than expected horizontally due to the thrust of the gas escaping out of the back and Bigby's Hand. We scrape along the concrete a short distance but there wasn't much of an impact and the main structure seems intact.

Incredibly, we're down and safe, with no ground casualties.

After a quiet moment, Deni says - "Wow. It's been a while since someone tried to kill us".

We bring Feather up to speed. We take her straight to the cargo hold and - FFS, the crates are missing. Feather describes Kaya; that's who Gnog saw, but we'll need the Dimir to pull the memory. At that point an angel comes along and looks *scared*. What frightens an angel?! He says that Feather should come immediately. We run to the helm. An angel is cradelling the captain. He's saying, "this is very wrong" and crying. The captain, who had initially had a look of fear, looks different now - his eyes had sunken in and there are just hollows, the cheeks are sucked in. Feather leans in and looks. "This, wait, no - this can't be? This is a conflagration..." - same as the Voda.

Gnog tries commune with nature, like last time; extraplanar links again? You never know. Insight is only 9+2, even with a last luck point. He can't get a good read. Besides, the captain died elsewhere; the dirigible was moving... Even so - there is extraplanar presence. The shadow of one - throughout the ship - several places. In the helm there's a strange trace, but also there are flashes of it between the cargo hold and balcony, centred where the captain is. Gnog comes back in and describes this, saying it's of course more leaps of supposition, but seems like one person could do all this very quickly if they could move very quickly via another plane without detection. Distance limit though - else why come up on the ship first? We ask Feather if she can contact the Azorious on the platform and check the weather station; they do; it's empty. No surprise.

Feather insists we don't talk here anymore; we are taken to the office on the Felidar. It's scrying-protected. Once safely in her Sunhome office, Gnog asks about the spell, or whatever it was, that caused the spirit to be killed. She pulls out a book; it's a myth, Feather explains. Like the boogie man. It's something that is referred to in ancient history. No contemporary records of this act exist. It is outlawed, always was pretty much - for so long that some people think it's just a myth. There is just one being that they know of with that kind of power; the **Firemind** - **Niv Mizzet - is rumoured to have this ability**.

Kaya, Taysa, the Orzhov, Niv, conflagration... Feather says we're going well beyond her jursidiction and risk putting ourselves in severe peril. Gnog's back to being full of pent up anger and sorrow. He'd almost lost the feeling. Now it lights a fire under him. Kaya is lethal. We're no match for her. **But If that's how he dies, so be it!** ***He is not stopping***. This won't stand.

We confirm that it was Kaya via a photo on file from Feather. After some discussion, Feather offers us coffee - nudge, wink - and happens to leave the open file as she goes to fetch it. Deni & Taz read it quickly (Taz adv investigation dirty 20).

* Kaya may have been around for years before, but certainly wasn't registered if so.
* She was "found" just under a year ago because she committed a crime, so became registered then.
* The Orzhov took her under their wing & bailed her, giving her "penance", to relieve her of her sentence.
* She was registered as a member of the Orzhov and given status and position, **but all of that was done by Taysa Karlov**.

So Taysa knows much more than she's let on there. Possible irony that Kaya was then the person to sell her out.

Lots of "might be her" links to crimes, she's nearby, or even there, but no proof. Sounds just like today - she was on an airship with a valid ticket and sure, she dove off, but it was crashing so who wouldn't! Would be easy to make up a convincing explanation. No proof of murder. There is also the note of a removal of two Azorious lawmakers who were moving against Orzhovian interests of expansion. We'll query that with Feather since it's cross-guild overreach. We learn that this was ultimately attributed to the Rakdos. Surprise, surprise. They are a popular choice of fall guy.

Over coffee, we're asked, what's next. The TL;DR is, well, maybe the (hey, this place is scrying safe right?) - the friendly precogs. But also, Taysa.

**We're handed four pins.** They can be used only once. They're for emergencies when your own identity might be landing you in peril, it provides a means of disguise. It amounts to Disguise Self for an hour. Angels and devils can see through that - **but precogs cannot**.

We wrap up. As we leave, Deni mentions that we never had breakfast. "Maybe it would help with my anger issues" agrees Gnog. We're in P4, so coffee & ringbread. Ringbread is sold out. *END OF DAYS.* They have savoury pancakes instead, so we enjoy those. It's a nice change. We bring things back as a takeaway to get home for a shower and so-on.

### 2500XP all round. This time not shared; we need to level everyone up ASAP. Taz still goes L9.

Gnog raises a coffee in a toast to Taz and Fee-Ree, without whom - through excellent navigation and quick-thinking use of spells - the frame of the airship would've crashed down into the heavily populated city beneath, even if the crew might've been evacuated by teleport. They held their nerve and were remarkable, even by their own high standards.

Shortly after, there's a knock on the door. Gnog opens it. "We need to talk". **A beautiful, slender, dark-skinned woman with an afro.**

*Gnog should listen.* This is important. She's right - we should talk. Battle-hardened layers of self-control are present within him. The trouble is, the cold fury at the actions of Niv Mizzet are present too, along with the white heat of anger and guilt from the murders on the platform and airship; the adrenaline and fear of the crash; barely a moment to take stock, just a glimpse of a way to start to process things in their morning coffee, now suddenly interrupted by the person responsible for so much sorry.

Gnog is, in the end, a Goliath barbarian. He doesn't even hear her speak - Fee-Ree and Deni tell him later. He opens the door, sees that face so clearly etched into his memory, mocking him as she made her escape from the dirigible **and snaps**.

**He roars** - I mean, he really fucking ***ROARS***. The whole building probably hears. It's almost comic - crockery rattles, alleyway birdsong stops... Behind him, Fee-Ree and Deni jump up in surprise; Taz takes a surprised and almost fearful step backwards and bangs into the far wall. Fee-Ree and Deni have know him a long time and never heard anything even close to this, not even with Tiamat. As Gnog roars - a sound of pure anguish and fury and violence - he rages; he recklessly launches himself bodily at this evil creature before him, one hand extended to grab her throat, the other reaching behind him to draw a weapon, ANY weapon, from his quiver. Thankfully, Deni's first dibs on the shower mean that he's still wearing all of his clothes and kit from the platform.

Unarmed strike roll with advantage 23; his hand would've closed on her throat but it's somehow not there. He closes his fist in empty space. It's as if she shifted to the side without moving. Off balance and surprised, he twists in mid air to try again; worse rolls, only 17; she steps to one side normally this time, so he misses wildly and collides with the corridor wall with a loud thump. Solid stone rather than plaster, fortunately, else we'd have a repair bill to pay. Kaya ducks to run past him. Opp attack. No luck points left, more bad rolls, max 20, but really it makes sense as he's now so off-balance and so clouded by fury. Gnog just shouts "FOR FUCK'S SAKE STAND STILL!". It's not that she seems hardy - no shields, no nothing - just impossibly fast. She's getting into the room. Now Gnog shouts in panic, "Everyone! Watch out! It's her!"

Deni has no weapon; she's just showered. Taz tries L3 Hold Person. The spell is visible; it reaches her, but she just shrugs it off. "Naughty!" she says. "We need to just *stop*. Everybody *STOP*" - but Fee-Ree is trying Banishment; again it *does hit* yet has no effect. Deni's diving for her pack but Kaya just *shifts* again, Gnog seeing it from outside in the hallway clearly; Kaya grabs the back first, holding it aloft and out of reach.

Gnog runs inside, snapped out of things a bit by the absurdity of asking her to stand still (!) and seeing the situation, shouts, his voice full of frustration and anguish but also resignation - "Stand down. We have stand down... *What the fuck do you want?*"

She turns to Fee-Ree. "Madam, I'm Kaya. Can you please get your bodyguards to calm down!" "No no, these aren't my bodyguards! These are my family!" "But you cast the spell that slowed down the airship?" Gnog shouts, "It didn't *try*, it *did* slow it down so you only managed to kill half the people on the platform and one on the airship but didn't also kill a bunch of people on the ground you arsehole!" - quick as a flash she slaps him (!) for 1pt damage.

We're basically ordered by her to sit. Deni's given her pack. She asks about the murder comment and says "I didn't manage to kill him. He got away." Taz insight dirty 20. Taz says, "Wait, you didn't kill the goblin, the caretaker, and the captain?" "Oh, the enginee... - Oh, no, I mean, there was blood everywhere!" She wouldn't make a mess.

She tells us we need to go further back. "So. I'm Kaya. You know of the Orzhov, of course. I'm not from here - it seems neither are you? I ended up here following a trail... And yes I am an assassin, that's what I do, but I'm not some murderous messy incompetent. My targets are surgical. Why were you on the airship?"

Gnog sighs. He has to put his feelings to one side. He explains it all.

She tells her perspective. She thinks we have different halves of a story. She says she was following someone of interest. Been following for a good month. She'd seen them showing up in places trying to interfere with *her* plans. An attempt was made on the life of a (sort of) friend of hers, such that they had to put her under magical protection. Gnog says, "Taysa?" "Oh. You know her? Yes. She's safe for now."

She followed this creature. She thinks it's **Tezzeret**. A planeswalker. A powerful one too. Confirms our suspicions on that front. The creature has been hidden from both memory and view for quite a while. She lost sigh of him for a while, but eventually saw that in the early morning he was headed up to the platform. She only had the choice of the airship so knew she'd be late up compared to him. Upon docking she jumped - she can do short trans-planar jumps to move quickly within this plane - to try and give chase. The creature leaves a stronger trace in the spirit world (and she kind of shimmers - she exists in both, it turns out) and that's how she followed him. She thinks that his ethereal plane traces were a trump card but now he knows that's how she's tracking.

She doesn't know about the caretaker, but she got to Engineering a bit late - the engineer had already been killed. She gave chase; the body was flung off the platform. She nearly caught him but couldn't do it. Slid into the spirit plane to follow but he'd already made it to the ship. That's why she followed back there. They fought as he emerged in the helm; he was trying to take control; it was a very short encounter, but he'd already killed the captain. Sucked out his soul. She followed him ultimately up on top of the ship; she threw a dagger up there; it punctured the balloon and the tear rapidly expanded. He'd fallen back into the cargo hold via the opening rip and levitated a bunch of crates, flying away with them. She can't fly - she can only dive and glide to avoid a bad fall.

She didn't know anything about the crystals, so we've filled in that; whatever this creature is doing, he was trying to erase knowledge of those. We don't know why he'd do that. Kaya knows what the crates were now anyway. She lost trace, but realised there was another planeswalker there - Fee-Ree in fact - lost us in Sunhome (scrying protection) but we emerged, she found us again and got us back here.

Unfortunately Tezzeret is now aware of her after all this.

We explain as best we can about red crystals; her interest gradually wanes; we try talking about the guild schisms; she gets less interested again. He asks what she's interested in - she says she's not sure. Maybe we're not who she thought we were. Perception 23, she's coming to the conclusion that we're the wrong people or it's too soon.

Gnog says, "Plans involving complexity, planes and precognition are hard to predict and, more than that, hard to time. We are probably the people - or at least, Fee-Ree is the person - you need, but perhaps, just not quite yet. What information do *you* seek?"

"I need to know who our allies are. Who *my* allies are, when this comes together." She's nearly at the door but stops and turns. "I know Jace is part of it. I know **Ajani** is part of it. And I *think* you're part of it. But I can't figure out why... You are, well, mainly interested in settling these things in Ravnican society and we're not. We're trying to stop Tezzeret and the Infinite Consoritum from completing whatever nefarious plan they have."

Gnog says, "Ah. Yes. Our interest in Ravnican politics is strictly a matter of a means to an end. We seek Fee-Ree's husband. This requires, it seems, Niv, which causes a cascade. However, of the Infinite Consortium - are you aware that the Xarixians are destroying entire planets, and did try to infiltrate this one but were unable to?" "Yes. They're doing **Nicol Bolas's** bidding. You don't know about him? We think he ties it all together. I don't think I have time to explain... You need to talk to Ajani. He'll fill you in. I think Tezzeret is close to completing whatever he's trying to do, so I need to find him; now I know those red crystals from my room are part of it..."

Taz insight: 16+5, 21. Our group has no idea why she's here. Or even on this planet. So Taz asks. "You follow Tezzeret, but only for a month. You said you followed a trail here. Why Ravnica? What brought you here?"

The Orzhov. **Seven years** ago, my entire village was destroyed - murdered - in the most horrific way. All their souls were burned, by a huge bright explosion that ripped through reality. We work in the mines, mining these red amplification crystals. They draw from the power of our plane, to enhance and magnify energy and magic that flow through them. They're a precious commodity and something that our world had been - well, we were enslaved, I now realise - for them. Enslaved by the Xarxyians to mine and extract them. I was not anything like I am now; I was just a young woman who was getting ready to leave home and start a family. The disaster happened the night before my wedding. I don't know why I was spared. But I burned with a fury... I blamed the Xarxyians for allowing this to happen, thinking it was some sort of industrial accident. I made it off-world. Over the next few years I had the most crazy encounters off my planet. I thought the Xarxyians were elves living in the great cities, but what I didn't realise was that they lived on floating platforms out in space. I learned..." - and there's a moment of guilt? - "...I slaughtered an entire platform of Xarxyians elves in revenge. That ignited my spark. I gained the ability to see *through* worlds. The mass amount of death I caused tore down the barrier between living and dead for me. It's why I have double-sight and exist half in each world; I carry that much weight of their death. I realised they were selling these crystals; selling them at the time in mass quantities, to an organisation the Mercanes. I tracked them - I nearly died in the process, you don't want to mess with them! - but discovered they were selling them to the Orzhov. I believed I'd found my place; the Orzhov are responsible for the death of my clan. The Obzidat in their greed for hunger and power and wealth callously doomed my planet to slavery and the 'industrial accident' that wiped out any hope I had of a happy life. I'd make them pay. I'd make every last one of them pay. So I found my way here. I needed to get the attention of Taysa, so I committed a series of crimes, escalating until I had her attention. She bailed me out and we hatched a plan which I think you already know... Well, part of it. It's her story to tell. That's why I'm here but there's something that doesn't sit right with me now. I need to ask Ajani about his story again."

"Have you meet **Nissa Revane**? She lives with the Selesnyans but detests civilisation, so she's in one of the wilder nurseries. She's also not from this plane... I think we're all here for a reason. I never thought about this before, but I'm going to ask her the story again now that I have these two pieces."

We obviously express (sincere) sympathies about her village. "I've done many things I regret."

We say, perhaps 3 - the mysterious missing Xarxyian planet that was attacked. We don't know if related, but 7 years comes up a lot.

* Nissa Revane - speak to urgently
* Ajani - speak to urgently 
* Tezzeret - bad guy
* Nicol Bolas - super-bad guy

Vi had mentioned "waiting for the five" - Nissa, Ajani, Kaya, maybe Fee-Ree? If so, who is the fifth?

Gnog says, "no way to know, but we've an 'in' with Dimir and want to pursue that, so maybe they can help find information." 

"Unless the 5th is Jace himself. Or if Jace is the fourth and you're the fifth... Anyway!" she says. "I need to go. I don't want to freak you out, but if *I* can follow you, anyone who's tracking you knows you are here. If you are part of this plan, you need to be more careful." Kaya is constantly on the move; doesn't keep fixed locations. Nissa is in a hard-to-find nursery, and Ajani is in the Red Wastes with a Boros patrol to stay mobile. She thinks Tezzeret is aware of us; if he was trying to wipe out evidence from the platform, we're part of that. She interfered on the airship, but she's not interfering down here. "I hope you're not too attached to this place! You can't keep staying here... People like us don't have the luxury of living normal lives."

She leaves. Gnog shouts *up* the stairs after her - she's headed for the roof - "almost nothing is truly unforgivable..." but Kaya calls back, softly yet clearly, "Respectfully, we have to agree to disagree."

Back in the apartment, Deni says, "Well I'm having a shower!" and heads in - with her backpack.

Fee-Ree pulls up a chair. She sits down. "Gnog. How are you". Gnog knows, she's just like that; whatever she's going through, it gets put aside for others. She is an incredible person.

Gnog says, "honestly, actually, quite a bit better for letting that out, even if it adds a bit of guilt because it was the wrong person. And it seems you indeed *are* the important one, not us bodyguards..."

Fee-Ree: "At least the picture gets clearer, even if there are more questions. We know more pieces and can see through more of the layers."

Gnog: "Yes. Either way, though, sadly, I do like this place - it's where we come to heal - I have good memories - but we have to thank the landlord and leave. Pretty much straight away."

Deni comes out of the shower. "As long as it's got a good bathroom!" - we brainstorm locations.

* We rule out Sunhome - we don't want to draw trouble there, we already got the goblin & caretaker killed by not thinking enough about who we might be putting in danger
* We rule out the library - the Dimir found us on the very first night
* Seraph's Rest again, at least for a night? Or next door, "At her feet" or whatever it was called?
* Hellfire Club or Gore House? Magically very noisy, unexpected, busy, but murders would probably be easily pulled off.
* Deni suggests P1. Opposite of Rakdos places. Full of Azorious and Precogs. Angels to see through illusion, precogs to see danger; hard to sneak in and do murders, even if interplanar. Just expensive, is all.

Gnog checks in on Fee-Ree, Deni and Taz too. Fee-Ree is OK. Deni is annoyed at having been caught without bow. Taz is a bit dented but OK, so Fee-Ree helps with mending and Gnog gives him a good polish. Taz glows inside again during this and Gnog finally asks. Taz looks, well, as much as his metal face can - embarrassed? He confesses he did not know it was visible. It is - he apologises if it is cheesy! - love. His love for the party. He has grown very close. Not because of Garren's soul and that initial connection; this is *him*. This is his core emotion.

We are complete, now. If there was any doubt before. We worked as a team today. We're whole.

Gnog figures intimidation is definitely back on the menu and dresses back in his Gruul-inspired leather kit. He makes the straps tight. The more sexual attraction, or the more intimidation, or just the more he draws looks - the more doubt - the better. Have people notice, but have them misjudge. This is the key. They'll see us everywhere. There will be too many trails to follow. We cover too much ground.

We head down and thank the landlord. Gnog gives him a couple of zino as thanks for helping and because we're leaving a bit early. We'll miss Precinct 4. We can't say where we're going. If anyone comes looking, he should say that we'd told him they might and that's why we specifically said we weren't going to tell him. Truth is, we've not even decided ourselves yet - it's probably going to be a roll of dice every day; intentionally, keep it random. Even we won't know.

As we head out it feels suddenly a bit strange - a little adrift again; no home now. Streets can't become familiar anymore and we can't let them become so. It feels a bit like being cheated of one of the few good things we'd found here, in that small community of late-night diners and drinkers at the small food court. No matter; things are as they must be.

Apropos nothing, Gnog has a visceral mental image, suddenly, of the bodies of the gnome and caretaker plunging lifeless through the sky before hitting the ground far below with a sickening wet thud. They wouldn't be known. Probably not even recognisable. No funerals, no closure. It makes him sick to his stomach. He has to stop to catch his breath a moment; it feels uncharacteristic to feel so affected by death, but this all happened through events we personally set in motion. Feather is right that we cannot be consumed by guilt, but wrong to say that none of it can be attributed to us. That's not the lesson. The lesson is to be more careful. Don't get to know people. Don't get them involved.

**"People like us don't have the luxury of living normal lives", Kaya had said.**

We head across towards Aurelio's barracks. Under the guides of drinking buddies that have to move home, we get to see him and let him know that we'll have to send him messages periodically, by magic, as even we don't know where we'll be. We fill him in, and warn him to perhaps keep his head down - make sure Ravnica Station is clear and safe; keep people off planet if at all possible; and now we know some of what we're up against, don't dig too deep.

We carry on to the Concourse. The ship is still there, but under repair. Looks like they'll try to fly it out, but at least its salvageable. Since we have time to kill until Nude Art Class, we head north and figure we'll make a social call to Levinia - not wanting anything. Just catching up.

Inevitably we talk about the Voda, and it's a difficult conversation, but we made a promise. We have to be vague to avoid endangering her.

She talks later about her new life in the new Verdani. Seems to be doing well. The Golgari have been engaged with to properly reclaim the dying Verdani, and we're invited to see the process. We accept. A few of the pale-skinned elves that we've seen before are there. Rituals are being cast. Large insectoid and fungal-like golem creatures are present - no undead, apparently by agreement - are bringing down parts of the tree, carefully, with these "super fungi" being used to rapidly decompose the tree but in a controlled way. It is being returned quite literally to the earth. It works via spores - the area around is cordoned off and there are a few barriers up to stop things blowing around. We have to cover our mouths and noses on approach - due to the number of spores that cloud the air. The elf-druids control them, we see, in due course; swarms of spores in clouds land on branches brought down by the larger golems. It's a strange real-life time lapse of decomposition. Rather than decades - even perhaps centuries, given the size of this tree, of slow decay - with possible hazards from things falling, it's done in a more controlled way.

These things are huge, Gnog notes. If the planetary megafauna were large too, that explains something. He asks Levinia of her opinions. She knows some creation stories. They're recited to younglings in song. We can visit nurseries and creches, where it happens; Levinia takes us up Vitu Ghazi to one of the big ones. A wide array of different kinds of young fauna and flora are here. A dryad leads a song.

It tells of a primordial world with seas of deep blue and green, alongside seas of lava, churning and conflicting, forming a world. There are huge beasts of fire on the land, of rock and scale, chewing through mountains as they solidifying; deep oceans and underground rivers are populated by giant serpents and turtles (dinosaur size, if not larger). They talk of the ebb and flow of them as they clash and vie for position. They create canyons and gorges, caves, push up mountains out of the oceans and so-on. It's in line with the vision of the Gruul.

Startlingly, the emergence of the first of the civilised races mimics tales from Toril. Here it's told as the "arrival of the humanoids". *Arrival*. They were giants, with their age-old-allies turned foes, the "flying wyrms" (dragons). The only things that might have survived on a hostile world (however much the stories are alliterative, the existence of those huge native creatures is likely true). They created the avians, reptilians, lizard-folk, snake-folk and so-on; the dragons and giants *dreamed them* into being.

The next steps sound familiar too. Elves arrived from the sky in their "winged ships". Wow. They started to tame certain areas and create the first cities - floating in the sky, in fact, above the churning earth. Reminds us of the ancient Netherese floating cities and so-on we were told about by the dragon council. From there things gradually settle. But the greatest of the giants and dragons would "wrestle" the greatest of wild beasts into submission to give space for their children to learn and grow. Walled cities and agriculture subsequently arise and expand. Then there was a betrayal between giants and dragons that nearly wiped out the early settlements, but things were brought under control by a deal with new arrival - **Rakdos**. He reigned over the land until **Razia** arrived, who'd followed him. From there, the first of demons and angels, bringing the start of cycle of balance; order and chaos, good and evil. Eventually there is, perhaps inevitably, an almighty war - the dragons vs "gods of nature", the megafauna pushing back, which drove away or killed almost all dragons. Only one was left standing. Niv.

It hits Gnog like a train. It's true. This is a planet of colonists. They're not actually native to it. But - ***the same is true of Toril***. He is not technically of his own world. None of his party are. None of his friends. Nobody.

Fee-Ree points out that Dwarves are not here. Maybe they were native to Toril? A quieter world, no megafauna. More tumultuous through magical cataclysms, but that was at the behest of "man" (humanoids), so *post*-dates colonisation.

The creation myth continues. Apparently, civilisation went to far. It brings not far off present day a world "crying out" to the likes of Gruul and Selesnyans. Four guilds, really; in their nascent form. What became the Simic, who would modify nature. The Gruul who would free it, but too wildly. Those who would succumb to the endless cycle and become morbid, losing their way; the Golgari. The "correct" ones are inevitably the Selesnyans. The guild leaders were brought together (the Paruns) eventually by the most dispassionate and intellectual of them all - Azor, the sphinx - who, with Niv Mizzet's help, set out to craft the original rules of the Guild Pact.

Levinia brings us to communal areas to have a Selesnyan lunch, which is very kind. We eat well; very good, simple fresh food. Reminds us of home. Gnog apologises about the trouble on the concourse, almost at random - bit of trouble with an airship, but at least we managed to get it down without actually crashing and hurting anyone.

As we're finishing up and readying to leave, Deni asks something. "Did I remember this correctly or did Kaya give something away earlier? Did she say she *came* here and hatched a grant plot together with Taysa to enact revenge upon the Ozbidat? What does that look like?"

Gnog says, "I hadn't seen it like that - I figured it was Kaya, alone, but Taysa was a means to an end. But perhaps you're right. Maybe that's why Taysa is trying to ally with other guilds - weaken the Ozbidat - perhaps, since they're already dead, the way to defeat them is to bypass them. Make their power worthless. You could be right; it could just be more political crap, I guess... Curiously then, the Ozbidat would be right. **Taysa would be the one overreaching** and throwing out of balance, not the other way around; she'd be the one in that guild who's trying to gain control of everything."

Deni says, "I hate it when I don't know if I can trust someone. When they're just a bit too clever. When you don't know their intentions."

"She held a lot back," agrees Gnog. "She said it was for our safety but I'm starting to think that was just a convenient excuse since we're anything but safe."

After hanging out for a while in the area, we say goodbye to Lavinia and start - in no hurry - making our way down to P2 for the nude art class, but we've got an hour to kill really either way. We wander through Whitestone, seeing the usual high-end - but not super-high-end - Precinct 2 shops and looking more closely at the architecture. It's an older neighbourhood and very orderly. Gnog says, "Fee-Ree, Taz, we'd have crashed here; you saved this." It has more impact down here on the ground, in the narrow busy streets. It would've made quite a mess.

Continuing down, we reach Griffin Heights. There are cloisters here - various schools. Music, arts, language; also collectors, various galleries. It has very interesting streets in the area running up and down hills. We wander around until it's roughly time and get over to the art class area. Someone comes out - they've seen us wandering past a few times. We're invited in; they mistake our delay for uncertainty. "**The Academy Of Figure Life Drawing**"; they specialise in this. Inside are rooms with groups of mixed age students, painting and drawing. Many rooms have nude models, but they're also of many different ages and body types.

We're allowed to wander around, to find the precogs - they don't ask occupations and they don't recognise a description of the robes so they must be here in normal clothes. We're also invited to join a class, so we sign up one each. 2 zino total. They offer materials and we accept. Gnog ends up being offered charcoal, Deni chooses pencils, Fee-Ree oil and Taz goes for pencils too. But then the idea of Gnog working in clay - due to his evident size and strength - to try working in clay instead. He thinks he'll give it a go. It's actually a pretty huge lump, since they think he'll want to work at that scale. Quite a few bits and bobs going with it all - Deni pays - we carry it all and start checking room.

Adv. perception Gnog 21. We find it quite easily. There is a middle-aged guy modelling, looks like he was athletic when younger and has some of that still, though age has softened the lines. He holds a pose as if in the middle of moving something - a working pose, rather than, say, thinking or flexing. A labourer. We set up behind the precogs. They catch our eye but don't say anything until we're in place. They make a show of moving a little to get 'a better angle'; one moves to the door and flips a sign on it to say "full".

We converse without facing each other. We talk in general terms about things that they might find of interest, trying to avoid - at their request - specifics. The main purpose of meeting them was that they had things to tell us back at New Prahv but couldn't do so then. Now, though, they say that we seem to have found our own path. They didn't see the airship crash; nobody did; but they saw this meeting - all futures led to us meeting here; there was no death in our future regardless. They think our future is now fixed; a path has been fixed; them giving us new information now might cause us to change and they think that is not a good idea.

Taz insight 15; they think that we have *chosen* an interpretation of facts and don't want to interfere. They would be guiding us then.

We ask how they found us originally. They reiterate; it was from a bright thread in possible future threads. No connection to their knowledge of Niv's involvement. On the issue of us fighting Jace - they didn't find out more about when it might be, but **believe it happened in Precinct 1 of this very district**. That future, however, is highly uncertain.

All the things we briefly told them about having done Was really wasting their time; it did confirm some of their precog visions. They follow us closely and watching our futures coalesce into the path we now describe confirms what they're doing. They continue to do this to try and basically hide our future from other precogs. 

In terms of safety (of them), a passing remark we make means that they inadvertently confirm Deni's theory. The Orzhov, of all people, insist that the precogs pay a very close eye on P1, because it has the most wealth. It's very heavily scried, predicted and guarded. Getting away with murder ought to be difficult.

In the end, there's nothing left for them to tell us. We've told them as much as we can, remembering, albeit a bit late in the day, to focus more on the "why" we think people are doing stuff, so they can help interpret the "what" in future visions. That, at least, is something.

We pack up. The precogs head up to the model and stand in front, writing on a note, holding it up to show him. We can't see what it says. They put the note down on the table and we see that it is a "thank you" note. Wonder why they didn't just *say* that.

We also, on reflection, aren't sure quite what it means when they said that there was never any death for us in any future when on the airship. Sure, Fee-Ree's portal spell was on standby, but if Tezzeret - we understand now that this is a name, not a race! - had decided to confront, say, Fee-Ree instead of the captain, surely she'd be dead and nothing we could about it. So, that was never a possibility. Interesting, but hard to know what to do with the information; there are only three of them and they don't see *all* possible futures after all.

It's about 6pm - time flies. As we're finishing up and trying to make final touches, Taz sings a song of inspiration to Deni and Fee-Ree. Gnog's probably a lost cause!

* Taz: performance but dex-based, 21. His pencil drawing is uncannily good. 
* Gnog: performance but strength-based, 13. That's not as bad as it sounds. It's a likeness without finess and is stylised, but it's certainly recognisable. Somewhat exaggerated throughout. The instructor gives him a few tips for improvement, which via that help brings it up to 15 total. He says it could be fired and turned into a real sculpture. Sure, why not! No fee, too. It'll take only about an hour to fire.
* Fee-Ree: performance but dex-based, with inspiration gets 15. That's also a decent effort.
* Deni: performance but dex-based, a remarkable 28 with inspiration. Her pencil expression is surprisingly emotional. It has expression and emotion in the face and is shaded in a way that feels like it is *her* emotion, not his. Frustrated, a little scared, stoic.

The instructor heads up to the model and uses sign language to tell him he can take some time off. Ah! Deaf! That explains it - and explains the precogs' choice of room. He signs back to the four of us - we're told it's a thank you and is asking to look at the work. He is surprised and pleased, but particularly taken - if somewhat puzzled - by Deni's expression. There is a moment of silent empathy between them. He likes Taz's drawing but seems more interested in Taz than the drawing! He thanks us, we mimic the gesture; he gets a robe and heads away for a break.

Gnog has a scroll case so we are able to put the artwork in there. We can return in an hour or so for the statue.

We could get dinner, but it's a bit early and we ate well at lunch. Fee-Ree suggests the gardens of New Prahv to watch the sunset. It's a good idea - Gnog wasn't paying attention to it on the airship up and Fee-Ree was inside with Taz, so we haven't done something like that for a while together.

We ascend to the New Prahv gardens and sit quietly together, listening to the waterfalls and watching the golden hour progress. The sun hits first two, then all three of the huge columns. Beautiful flowering trees and low bushes, dark green, broad-leaved flowering plants and tall populars whisper together in a light breeze. A handful of others are scattered around in calm repose. There is a shift change; workers leave New Prahv more or less as the sun is setting, perhaps by coincidence of time of year; lights within the column windows illuminate, but only in a few. Mostly, the towers are dark monoliths silhouetted against the gradient of the sky as the last twilight reflects off the water.

The moon has long since risen. It's high in the sky. To himself, Gnog looks at it and says, "Hi, Eliastra!". He thinks he may be getting soft in his older age, but *that* aspect of ageing, if true, he welcomes.

"I won't always be able to hit things with sticks you know. Strange future ahead. I was thinking one day I might just wander off, north, back to the mountains, finish there somehow; rather than growing old. It seemed easier and I didn't want people to see me frail. And I didn't want to risk perhaps outliving any of you."

"But that's so far away!" says Deni.

"Not so far for me as you," says Gnog, "but I'm wrong. It's strange how a day can change your outlook. I should've trusted you all to not mind, to be there, if I was frail, or whatever. It's what Fee-Ree said this morning - we're a family, and sometimes I'm so focused on all the stuff going on that I forget what that actually means. It doesn't mean we're a party of adventurers that stuff. It means we have each other forever. Still, strange future ahead. I think my statue should be done..."

We head back to the school and pick it up. It actually looks decent when fired! There is talk of what we got out of things. If there's a "next time", they offer maybe carving or stone work. Always room to explore potential new hobbies. **We're handed a small pamphlet with a schedule which tell us what kind of materials and workings are done on which days.**

It's about 7:30pm, but not so late, we think, that we don't have the energy for a little visit to Taysa.

Deni knows the exact way. She's got that way with cities. We arrive at the front gate at the end of the shift there, and, surprisingly, it's the same people. They say they checked on the writ which is OK, but stress that it's irregular and this must be the last time. The usual inspections take place and we're allowed in, eventually ending up at the Advocist's quarters. We talk briefly about what we've done and he's more than happy to sign it off.

We also do explain that we have an ulterior motive, and he agrees that we can see the manifest. He says he should have it... Digs around a while, since it's one of their warehouses and finds it. We start to search.

* Gnog: Perception 8+7 -> 15.
* Fee-Ree: Nature 19+7 -> 26. 
* Taz: Arcana 20+4 -> 24.
* Deni: Investigation total 31.

Even Gnog's low roll is still OK but the others are high and we find significance quickly. **The list of animals**. There was one **newly-hatched solar dragon!** It was only going to be in transit on Ravnica proper because it was too dangerous to keep on Ravnica station but has since been transferred back up for onward sale. Baby solar dragons emit very strong radiant energy - even if not on the visible spectrum - and this must have been exciting the crystals. Gnog is almost lost for words on it all, and the best he can do is politely suggest to the Advocist that they endeavour to avoid storing crystals near strong energy sources lest a large crater arise! He was surprised himself to see the item and agrees strongly. "It's very irregular that they brought this down to planet-side... It's very risky. Dragons can usually sense the presence of other dragons." "Well then, I suspect Niv knew but I guess didn't care."

The signed writ can be handed to any arrester station or New Prahv to fulfil the judgement requirements and fulfil any remaining legal obligations.

He preempts our request and says we should see Lady Karlov - she's been asking when we might be back. He'd suggested 5 days, so we are maybe a day early but it's not like she's doing anywhere! She's having dinner, we're told; we are taken once again to the large manor adjacent to the huge main house. We're invited in. She's sat at a table. "Good timing! Are you hungry?" "Are you *sure* you're not precognitive?! Yes please!" We are invited to sit.

We lay things on the line then. We know about Kaya and what's happening. We talk about the platform and the crystals. The Tezzeret creature can move between planes, after all - we're getting into the story about the platform when the attendants return with food; without missing  a beat Gnog carries on talking as he was before, but he's now talking about what we saw at the pavilion and information. Taysa asks her to find a book which 'she needs for the conversation' to give us more space.

At one point, Teysa writes down the name of a place we should visit for great magical items - it's a P1 address for a magic shop. Noted, thanks.

We continue; various interruptions of course; we learn that the 30 crates is a huge number. She thought they were the only people able to bring this stuff in, and yet they've done only a little over 100 for the Orzhov. 30 is therefore a very large number, especially to have apparently been imported somehow in secret. The attendant brings back the book Taysa asked for and a while later, once we once again have privacy, she shows us a drawing. "You didn't see this".

It's a picture of Tezzeret. Looks male, twisted and fearsome, glowing in the well-drawn illustration, surrounded by some kind of almost skeletal, armoured, metal guards or soldiers. It's a sobering sight.

"Vi furnished us with this picture so we could keep an eye out. It's from another world."

We talk more about the encounter and how Kaya is now known to him as are we, but we think still not Taysa. She urges us to spend the night here, but then seek Niv tomorrow.

She has a MOU made by **Ral Zarek** (Niv's 2ic sorta) which was one of the alliances that she had made with the Izzit. It should get us somewhere through the door, but we need to hide it. A Bag Of Holding is not sufficient. We will be searched on exit. Gnog looks at Taz and says, "I have a very difficult question which I fear might treat you more as object than a person", but Taz says, "of course you can, it's the obvious solution - the panel on my left hand side is probably the easist to access; Zorbu always seemed to start there for access when I was being commissioned. Deni is easily dextrous enough and hides the paper inside, closing the panel.

More food. Very good of course.

On the subject of what Taysa wants - taking over guilds etc - she will do what she wants to do within her guild. That's up to her. But she'd do anything to protect Ravnica from the vision that Niv and Jace shared. He never told her details; just the gist of pure destruction. Niv saw this in a very early version of precog techniques and it was enough to scare him into a multi-year plan, including building the IPB. Ral is building something new - it's not the IPB though. He's doing something else, and does not believe that the power draw will impact upon the planet the same way. In fact, last time, it did nearly rip the containment field apart - this time, he's using the crystals to amplify power and avoid that. He didn't have anywhere near as many before - either none, or only one or two shards - but this time, he has plenty, well, relative to whatever it is he's trying to do anyway.

Taysa talks about Bolas and the Infinite Consortium. Bolas is an ancient dragon, like Niv; he might be beating Niv at his own game. Bolas has seized control of the consortium. She wishes Jace were here; he apparently knows / understands Bolas quite well. She thinks it all leads here; that Ravnica may be the battleground and it might be Niv's fault. Tezzeret might not be the only agent here. Apparently he's already organised mass destabilising on the planet **Amonkhet**. We distantly recall the people we fought after the disagreement at Clancy's on Ravnica Station; the warlock was from Amonkhet. We sent her home via Banishment. Perhaps it was not such a happy place.

Dinner is finished. "Was there anything else you wanted to know?"

"If Jace was going to hide anywhere, where would he hide?"

"Wish I knew! Who knows what goes on in that boy's head." They've tried various planets, no luck. All the worlds they know he has previously visited. They seem to be one step behind all the time. She's sure he's up to something! Just hopes he can pull it off fast enough to make a difference, because things are moving very quickly now. Wouldn't be an issue so much except he takes the power of the Guild Pact with him.

(Amongst the other concerns, Gnog finds he's scared. It's something *else* to process. Not the "I'm scared of you being hurt", kind of thing; he's actually frightened of the enemy. Of Tezzeret. That's not unheard of for him, but it's rare and it gets his attention - and his respect. The picture got him into his head a bit. His barbarian heart helps him turn that fear into motivation, while his experience tempers a tendency to rash action. He has come a long way.)

We retire to the main house. A large room is set for us. "Deni! It's a nice bathroom!" says Gnog. Even Taz has a bed, which he says he might try, just for novelty. There's a view over the back lawn and some trees behind at the edge of the grounds. We settle in for the night. It seems kind of safe, I guess? In the end, we decide we just have to trust things and don't take watch. It's been a long day.



## Day 35 (Riglan 72 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Friday (7 day week)

Next morning we awake feeling a fair bit better. Taz says beds are interesting, but chairs are fine. It's easier to see the room. It's a sunny day. We wash up and get ready for the day. As we leave the room we see that an attendant had placed a note on a side table. It says, "When you're ready, breakfast is served in the conservatory". OK then! We go there. A table is set up inside with table cloth, chairs, juices, teas, coffee and so-on. Taysa's sat in the sun enjoying the morning (and a cup of tea). "Ah. It's so strange, not being able to read the news in the morning."

There's all sorts of fresh baking too. Deni asks how many we can have? As many as we want! It seems a waste. Taysa says that anything not eaten here is taken to the kitchen and the staff have their breakfast. We bag a small selection for the Chest Of Preserving, just so Barri & Jerri can get a taste of Ravnican high society bakery. We all have only a light breakfast in practice. Fruit, tea, a shared pastry; that kind of thing.

Then she says, "You've been very kind and generous with us Taysa, but if there's nothing else we can help you with we might make a move and get on with the list of things we have to do... It's always hard to know if we've done enough, knowing that we won't be able to come back. I just have this sinking feeling that we'll walk out past those guards and realise there's something we forgot to ask, or mention."

Taysa answers, "Well, can't help you there really! But it's better to do something than be paralysed with the inaction of the 'what if'."

She stands and accompanies us a distance, not to the front door, but does wave us goodbye before heading to finish breakfast. Gnog says, "Brave heart, Fee-Ree; today is an important day and it's like she said - we can't worry about what we missed. We just have to make it work with what we have."

We're searched thoroughly at the front gates; the writ is noted; the Advocist actually walking us to the front gate to aid veracity. We thank people and head away. Deni realises that our path to Nivix takes us close to the magic shop Taysa mentioned. No time like the present for bolstering abilities; we divert a little to get there.

It is called "**The Arcana Majoris**".

We go inside. It's small but beautifully laid out. Magic objects abound. In context of our discussion with Taysa, it seems that things which might help us with investigation could be of value, so Taz asks if there are any objects may detect magic or suchlike. We also are interested in some kind of alarm.

The first seems easy! "Very well, I have what you need." He goes to a glass display case and pulls out a wand. It's thin, beautiful polished silver with a short handle. There seems to be a glass ampule set along its length. "This is a wand of magic detection. It would be 15 Orzhovian coins (platinum)". That sounds great.

Our other enquiry is something akin to the Alarm spell, or a ward of defence; something to alert us to approach by people when we're asleep. He thinks a while then takes us to a display wall of boxes, each containing a single gem stone. He shows us a dark blue rhomboid stone. "This is an Ioun Stone of Awareness. It will ensure that you can never be surprised. Is this what you were thinking? It's a form of protection but it does require atunement. There are also warning charms, that can be attached to another object such as a weapon, shield or necklace but it's the same issue - atunement is required. The charms are 30pp each, while the Ioun stone is 100pp. There are, though, scrolls of the Alarm spell; but we realise we don't know how to cast that. Taz asks about Tiny Hut, a spell of which he knows, but has not been able to memorise - it would give us what amounts to a portable bolthole with a degree of safety against entry. The scroll is 15pp.

30pp for wand and scrolls. He's happy to take weighable platinum - no need to head up to Vizkopa to exchange. He weighs them up and takes payment.

That's that! We thank him and head out, continuing towards Nivix. The building looms in the distance; there is a feeling of nervous anticipation.

We've been building up to this for some time. Deni asks if we're going to get the goblins. Gnog hadn't figured they were ready; but it makes sense to at least try. And if nothing else, we can tell them what we learned about the crystals and their origins. Deni points out that the goblins know the building layout whether or not they have anything inventive with them, besides themselves.

We redirect, then, under Tin Street, around Kamen Fortress and down, past the Gore House and to Foundry Street, then on from there to the goblins' house. They're eager to come along, but do pack up a couple of trunks of stuff. Mum tells them to be very careful if heading into Nivix. They're keen to go - "let's head in!" - hoist chests onto their backs and onto some carts, but Gnog says he can carry that and save them the bother. So, now we are group of six. We inadvertently walk in order of height, smallest to tallest. They're excitedly chattering away at the front, leading the way.

At the outskirts of Nivix we have a conversation with them and investigate / decipher the right way to get what we're hoping to get (the note is taken from Taz and they've looked at it). Taz investigation - middle-of-road, 10+4 -> 14, together we figure out who this note should probably go to and the goblins then know which door to find. It is, after all, a giant building with a great many doors and we've no idea of its internal layout.

Gibo and Bebe lead us to the entrance of what, above the door, says is the "Laboratory Of Pyrology", which Gnog guesses is *something* to do with fire. That's a place where they have a contact - their father worked here - and once inside, there's a hallway from that laboratory through towards the central building where the Laboratory Of Alchemy will in turn lead us into Main Hall, and within the Main Hall, they know how to take us to the base of the Laboratory Of Storms & Electricity, which is where Ral Zarek is most likely to be found. While Nivix does not hold all possible campuses, the **Izmundi** are here - those are heads of laboratories, who form a Board Of Directors Of Research; apparently in reality they just end up trying to outdo each other with ever-more elaborate and extreme experiments. Gibo and Bebe don't see a point to it since they each research very different fields of study, without overlap; that said, some have more status than others and perhaps that's what it's about.

We are let in - via a side entrance, not the main entrance - by goblins that know Gibo and Bebe through their father. We follow their lead. We arrive in a large hallway that's being used as a store room, but it seems to have a warren of little rooms off it that the goblins use as, well, kind of student digs. We end up in a common room where a few other goblins play games of dice and having some food. Grilled meat on sticks! Hopefully it's as good as the stuff in P6. Crates are pulled up for us to sit upon. They can't find anything big enough for Gnog and instead offer an old piece of what looks like the front of a train or something; it's fine and Gnog sits. We're offered meat sticks - sure! They are indeed very good. Rivalling P6. Goblins are great at this stuff.

They chat to Gibo and Bebe. Taz gets a lot of interest. Taz does his best to explain how he works and points out the transparent panels and things like that so they can get a good look. We're asked if he's alive and explain (yes, he is) and the goblins apologise for being so hands-on, but Taz explains he's quite happy for people to see; he's proud of his creator's (father's) skill. He's given a crate to sit and offered a meat stick to taste.

Gibo and Bebe explain that we're here to see Ral. This causes surprise as he's very "high up" in the ranks, but we explain in abstract terms - trying not to be too specific - that it's about Jace, albeit indirectly - and so-on. A conversation develops about ways to get to his laboratory. It ends up being agreed that the Laboratory Of Alchemy is a good way to go - but first, we need to get through the pyro lab. We're asked if we have heat resistant clothing! We're given goggles and strange oilskin-like lab coats, which apparently help against fire. Taz says he should be fine, but they give him one anyway - it's silver and reflective. "You shouldn't get hot! You're made of metal!"

Four goblins are assigned to come with us. We thank the group overall with the four ration's worth of P6 smokehouse food we had from earlier. It's appreciated.

A stone staircase that seems to fit between an outer wall and the inside decorative room walls lead upwards; a service stairwell. We can hear activity in rooms behind doors along the way. Eventually we reach the door they were looking for; they check inside, think it's clear and head in. People ignore them until *we* come along, not goblins; they ask what's happening and Gibo and Bebe do the whole "nothing to see here, we're just coming through!"

Nozzles of blue gas-like flame shoot out from an experiment, which seems to be superheating something. It's warm but not too bad. We get to the other side, through a door, into a small corridor which leads us to another room. Once again they check ahead. The door is very hot - as it opens, we feel a big wave of heat too. It is literally like a baker's oven! Heat shimmers in the air. We are told to run. "Do not get distracted! Head directly across the room. There are two doors. The one on the left is locked. The one on the right is open. Do not delay! This is the lower furnace room. Be quick!"

3... 2... 1... And we dash! "Whoever's last, remember to shut the door!" Athletics:

* Taz: only 11, but since was in front, Gnog sweeps him up along the way - the ol' football trick again
* Fee-Ree: Resistant to fire and has no issues
* Deni: She rolls a 1, has -1 on athletics and no proficiency, and almost trips; but thankfully her red dragon armour is of course heat resistant too, plus the goblin cloaks they gave us, so she realises she can just walk.
* Gnog: 18 (who closes the door, runs and on the way, picks up Taz)

Gnog puts down Taz who even in that short spell is uncomfortably warm. We're in another hallway after a short flight of stairs. It seems fairly disused, unsurprisingly. It hangs underneath (!) one of the skybridges that links to a tower. A service hatch is popped up to get us onto the skybridge proper. We hadn't realised how many stairs we'd climbed - we're maybe 70ft up. It's less scary now we're on the skybridge; it's enclosed with glassless windows of a sort. A fairly spectacular view, with the wind blowing through - a welcome way to cool down. It's around a 50ft stretch before reaching a fairly major hallway with stairs leading up and down, around a central stone landing.

The four guide goblins take their leave of us here; we've reached the main building. Gibo and Bebe remember the way from here. We thank the guides again and give back our oilskins and goggles. "We'll see you guys later or something, I guess? If you need somewhere to crash you can always come down and join us!"

In practice, there's an inevitable debate between the two of them and in the end they open a random door and ask someone to confirm the way! In the end, we proceed as, with a bit of help to get started. they remember how to get there.

Suddenly, we reach a rather formal and decorative entrance. It seems strange that the "main entrance" to the Laboratory Of Alchemy is inside in a building 8 floors up - you'd have to certainly know how to find it, at which point the decorative entrance does seem a bit redundant! There are two other things going off to, sort of, 2 and 10 o'clock; 10 o'clock is the "Laboratory Of Continuism" and 2am is the "Laboratory Of Mimeography"; Alchemy sits at 12 o'clock and we go straight on to enter. We're greeted inside by a gnome and a human at a kind of front desk. We're asked for proposals - presumably for alchemy studies - Taz persuasion 22, explains that we're just passing through - keeping it honest. The gnome thinks about it; it's the shortest path, it's true. We're told to not go *into* the laboratory but instead go through the common room, then the dorms, then from there the courtyard to the main building.

(We accidentally cut out a bunch of potentially interesting DM-researched things inside the Alchemy lab! Oh well)

Quite a few people are hanging out in the common room; a few humans, a couple of earth Genasi, a few other races. We get through and end up on a long corridor that connects dorms. The dorms are dark but the corridor has windows on one side and once again we can see clearly how high up we are in this huge building. In due course we reach a courtyard that seems to connect a few other corridors to more dorms. A staircase at the far end - sort of a squared-off spiral staircase - leads *up* to what feels like it would be a main building entrance, were it not for its strange location. That said, there are what we think are some kinds of parking or landing bays all around. Various contraptions are parked up - mizzium jet packs, winged flying vehicles and so-on. This forms a concourse leading to the entrance and it's busy up here. Ahead on the left is the Laboratory Of Storms & Electricity; on the right, Laboratory Of Orientation. To the left, then.

Gibo and Bebe be say, "well, we've taken you to the one you're looking for, we think. Ral Zarek is the the head of this laboratory as far as we know." We ask if they want to proceed? Yes! Their equipment in fact forms a proposal for that lab. They've been telling us about Mizzium - can be a solid, liquid naturally, or be excited into a plasma; they believe that it's a plasma state reactor which keeps Taz going.

We get the letter ready and head in. Inside, it's not a college; it really is a lab. A main area has notice boards or job boards and what look like booking slots for maybe experiments, or equipment or something. One person is nearby doing some sort of coordination. There are numerous hallways and doors leading to experiment rooms. We approach the coordinator guy and as Gnog shows the letter, Taz politely asks if it is possible to get to see Ral Zarek. At first there's a look of "of course not", but then they see the letter and the attitude changes a little. Taz persuasion 18, not great but enough to get them to take us where we need to go.

Before he proceeds though he wants to see proposals. That's Gibo and Bebe. With trepidation, but a sense of pride, they pull out a stack of schematics and diagrams. They start to explain. We have all the equipment (including our red crystal) but they say they've experimented as far as they can on their own; they need the resources within the laboratory (and mention their father working at the Pyromancy lab, giving his name just in case that helps).

The attendant thinks it looks maybe promising. He invites us to follow and takes us onto a platform that rises the central column of a central space. It's reminiscent of Balthor's - a floating disc, albeit square here. It rises steadily through about four floors. We leave the 'lift' and go up a short ramp to a number of laboratory doors. The coordinator knocks on one with a huge **"DO NOT DISTURB"** sign on it. "Ral? Mr Zarek? Mr Zarek, um, may I come in? It's urgent, quite important... These people have a letter from *Taysa Karlov* and it has your signature on it..." - footsteps from inside. The door opens. "WHAT? What are you talking about?" - Taz offers the letter, while saying in his most charming manner, "Very nice to meet you Mr Zarek, my name is Tazythus. You don't know us, but we know Taysa and she insisted we come and see you right away. We know that you and her have had certain dealings - this is in relation to those dealings."

Ral thanks the coordinator - calling him **Elison** - and says "I'll take it from here", but before he leaves, the coordinator says, "Sir, these two goblins here have got actually quite an interesting proposal that really belongs in our laboratory I think..." Ral answers, "Well that's your call - if you want to give them a lab, you can. Who's their lead, out of the two?" "They both are! It is their own experiment; they're not assistants." "Well then sure, up to you, carry on!"

Gibo and Bebe are escorted away by Elison, and they seem quite excited. Gnog says he'll leave their equipment up here, but they end up dragging it away with Elison's help (some of the chests have little wheels anyway).

The four of us go inside with Ral. Ral Zarek is human; only about 5'9", messy locks of medium-length black hair, thick black eyebrows just short of bushy and a goatee/chinstrap beard. He almost looks suave. He wears a red and blue (many people in the lab are, in fact) working coat. It seems thicker than a lab coat; padded in parts and belted, not shapeless. On the table is something that resembles the Mizzium Aparatus that were purchased. Numerous desks have various complex looking experiments. There are some half-dozen goblin assistants here tending to machinery and two blue, hairless Vedalken taking readings.

"Come into my office", he says, leading us into a very messy office space - piles and piles of notes all over; slate boards covered in calculations and writing all around. The door is closed. "OK. Why don't you tell me what this is really about?"

We explain about the IPB and being here basically at Niv's behest. Taz adv persuasion 12+13 -> 25. Ral cleans a bit of space on a table and leans against it. "You seem to have quite a few of the facts already. I was an assistant. Just a young assistant at the time. You are correct; Niv fired the IPB and I helped. You probably know also that the power module overloaded shortly after the beacon." We say yes; we know why they're now using red crystals and coolant, but know that it's not for the same purposes as the IPB. Ral says, "yes, that's the project I'm on now" - he lowers his office blinds.

"We're making pretty good headway but I don't think we're going fast enough. Niv left very strict, very clear instructions on the specifications that we'd need to meet and I haven't been able to get them. It has something to do with the way the crystals interact." He hesitates - Taz via passive insight picks up, as does Deni, that he doesn't know how much of the rest we know. More about whether what he says would make any sense.

Seeing this, Taz says, "How about we briefly say what we know, at least of the important stuff, so you know if we have context for understanding?" We explain about the red crystals, Tesseret - and we find out that his crystals were in fact stolen from the Izzit, not shipped separately; and not just 30 - he's stolen 60 in total. That's something which is really holding back Ral's work. They need those crystals.

"Niv set me on the task of a plan B. What we're building here isn't the main plan - what we're building is a contingency. I hope we'll never need what we're building..." - we ask what it is. He says he'll show us. He takes a moment, clears his face of worry - that's why he closed the blinds - and opens them. We say he's not alone; we're here to help... He says that unless we can make miracles or we're very good at finding people... Jace? No. **Niv**. **Niv Mizzet is missing!**

He sets that aside. The door is opened, he checks something about "The emitter", nobody there, then says he's going to test-fire it; he heads up with us in tow. "Alright. So we need this - this is based on the technology of the IPB, but it much more advanced. We've had years to refine and stabilise it. The IPB is like a tendril of a plant; searching around; we know roughly where to send it, but the way it reacts is beyond our control. In some cases it grabs something and yanks it; in other cases it cradles it; in some cases it punctures. We had to use it before we had fully understood how to control that part of it. Now, *this* is a much finer weapon - because that's what we'll have to use it as. This can disrupt an inter-planar beam, be it a tunnel, some kind of gateway, anything that cuts across the planes; this can intersect it with surgical precision - at least that's what we're hoping and disrupt it". Gnog asks, "Bit of a reach, but this wouldn't be to interrupt the Xarxyian energy beam after harvesting a planet?" "It could but that's not what it's designed for - since by that stage it's too late. No, this is a way to deny the opening of a conduit. We think that's where things are headed." "Ah, they're going to open a tunnel to here and send something through?" "Well, yes, but not some *thing*. I'll show you something Niv left behind. Maybe it might make sense to you. But first, a demonstration of how this is supposed to work - I really do need to run a test!"

He powers it, warns the room below that he's going to test it and activates the device. A pulse is emitted; he can aim it, hoping to disrupt whatever inter-planar connection is being established. It needs careful aim though. "It's too weak to do anything right now though. We need, based on my calculations, we're going to need all 100 crystals - we've only 40".

So, what did Niv leave?

Ral makes excuses with his lab staff - instructs them to keep working on the efficiency improvements to get more out of the crystals - and we head out of the room. We're taken to a teleportation circle and stand well within it. Ral teleports us. We appear in a very large room - a cavern - dragon scale. It's beautiful, with huge tall windows on all sizes, with crystal panes; bookshelves lining the walls, stuffed full of books and scrolls; numerous work benches; a roost up high; this is clearly Niv's room.

We are led to a large table (amongst the other very large tables - it's all dragon-scale). He points at a chart on a wall; it has a picture of a female dragonborn on the chart. Fee-Ree. She's not the only person; there are three more. Interesting - the five; of which we only know four; and here, a chart with four:

* A female elf painted all in green
* In bronze, outlined in red, a female dragonborn surrounded by fire
* In white, a Leonin (very muscular humanoid with lion's head)
* Outlined in black, a human woman, dark-skinned with an afro

So it's all true. We were brought here.

When Gnog talks about it, the issue of "the fifth person" being Jace. No, we're told. It's Niv himself.

"This is as far as the precogs could get; they pinpointed a time for the IPB to target and had a rough idea of how long it would take for the plans to coalesce. We didn't know how long we'd have - we had no idea how long for the four of you (the four on the chart) to turn up. We just knew who to target, because that's who the precogs saw. I was there and helped with some of the calculations. Niv did all of it really, he doesn't trust others, but I was part of a working group to interpret the - well, quite incoherent babblings - of Niv's precogs."

Interestingly, it's taken seven years or so - give or take - for all four of us to arrive. When Kaya arrived was when Niv started to get nervous because to him, it proved that the visions were right which means the bad stuff was underway too.

It comes up by chance in conversation that we found a cloud of crystals floating out in Guildspace - Ral gets excited; we could harvest them perhaps. If we can find them, we can try. We also mention that our goblin friends have an interest in resonances and unexpected power jumps; he'll look into it.

We have to clamber up on a table, because we're getting to the "not some*thing*" part of the earlier conversation. Taz casts Comprehend Languages, because the writings are in a language none of us know (so, not Draconic, for example). It's almost like scratchings of a madman, but it's a sort of cipher, a language of his own; it's not a code, it's just something only he can understand - unless you have magical comprehension, which apparently, is enough to make some sense of it. He's had 10,000 years or more to get the hang of that kind of thing.

It reads as if paranoid! Taz explains that it's strange due to the tonality more than the collection of original languages and entirely new words from which it seems to be assembled. It's hugely egotistic, almost egomanaical, as well as hugely paranoid. There are some circled planet names - Theros, Amonkhet, "troubling, can't trust his news", all in relation to Jace going on trips "gallivanting". "Hoard? Who is between this? Dead gods? Why should someone care? Powerful figures going missing, underground? Some secret perhaps?" and heavily circled, "Secret society?" then "Infinite Consortium! What do they want?" "Tesseret spotted? Who's he working for now?"; lines connect words to "Nicol Bolas, but why and why now?" Elsewhere, "Raising an undead army on a planet-wide scale, but how will he transport them?" "Possible planar bridge, but how? That would take huge energy" - elsewhere, "Is this why the four have been called, to fight this? Where are they? Why only Kaya?"

Ajani, the Leonin gets mentioned once arrived; the writings show more confidence now that the visions were right but, then, so is the undead plan. Elsewhere, "How much energy can I draw? Perhaps laylines can provide enough?" in a few places, perhaps from earlier IPB designs. Quite scattered.

As Taz explains this, Deni says, "You know how it feels like there are so many layers and half-plots and half-stories and nuggets of information we're trying to make sense out of, as though we can't see how they're all connected? It's because this whole story, this whole plot, was written by a mad man, or a genius, I don't know which."

So, someone is perhaps going to march a planetary-scale army of undead onto Ravnica via some kind of bridge between planes. Why? Invasion, but of undead. What for?

On Niv, around 2-3 weeks ago he went missing. Ral can't be sure exactly when.

Ral has no idea what Niv was up to, but he's happy to leave us here to read as many notes as we can. He'll have to fetch us later, since we can't teleport without the circle (magical warding) and we don't have that spell, nor the runes for the laboratory circle anyway.

Fee-Ree is stood looking at the wall. She's sad, disappointed; distressed almost. "That picture, there, that's me. Not him. Not Arxis. It's like he was never really part of this. Maybe Niv doesn't even know where he is. I was hoping we could get here and I could just *ask* him if my husband was here, or still alive. But nobody knows. It sounds like nobody even knew what would happen when they fired the IPB. Maybe the IPB was meant to take me, directly. But because we were fighting and I pushed him it - he was in the wrong place - he..."

Gnog pulls her into a hug and tries to explain no, it was seven years for everyone; she had to gain power. Fee-Ree is getting hotter. The flood gates are opening; she starts getting angry; it all comes out. "What gives him the right? He just wants me, look! Look at the picture, he just wants me for my fire..." - eventually she just slumps onto the ground, sitting in a heap. Deni runs over. She's cooling a little, but the air around her, no longer shimmering with heat, almost has light snowflakes; the opposite.

Gnog knees down and takes her hand, and says, "Fee-Ree, come back to us. We're here together. We'll figure it out, for all the frustrations. And there will be justice. Somehow."

She leans against him, almost falling. "I don't want revenge... I don't want revenge. I just need to understand. I mean, I think I do. They need our help. They need our help and they had no way of asking except this shitty, shitty way. They had no way of finding us. They... I guess... He needed to ask *us* for help, but didn't know where we were. Even, who we were. So he threw a question into space itself, seven years ago, to start a chain of events that would take us here, now. It's just, like everything, it's all innocent people that we lose on the way. He's probably gone... He's probably gone..." (and she breaks down in tears). "Why did I allow myself to believe that he would be alive?"

Gnog says, "Because Taysa said he is. He's somewhere. Ral doesn't know, but Ral didn't know much really, Niv kept it to himself. And if anyone has the tools to find him it'd be Niv. Moreover, the more we hear about all this, the more familiar certain planet names become. Certain places. Ruby palace. I still think that's in our future somehow. I know it seems hopeless; and, it's such a disappointment; and perhaps I'm wrong to encourage you to hold onto hope. But - yes, it's what we do. We see problems and we help. It's how we got here, on our own world, it's why you left your home, it's why the cult caught you. We help, and we put ourselves in danger, and I'm not sure why, it's just how we're built." "It's our nature, like the guilds." "Yes, like that." "So we must play this game. Let's play the game. Let's help this planet out." "Thing is - imagine if someone told you after the war when were back home and healing, that a billion souls on a world just like ours - good, bad, lovers, enemies, all of them - were going to be exterminated, and we could help, but it'd cost you a loved one. I don't know if any of us could rightly have refused. However much we'd hate it. And I think if Arxis had known, had been told what was about to happen and why, I think he'd have probably agreed too. I don't think any of us could condemn these people. We couldn't live with it. It's shit. But like you say, we play the game, because that's how we find him. We help them to help ourselves."

Fee-Ree gathers herself. Holds Deni and Gnog's hand, pats it and says thanks. She looks up at Taz. Taz feels awkward; he isn't that close. Taz says "I'm sorry I couldn't help, I feel I didn't know you enough to understand..." Fee-Ree answers, "Oh, you are enough! Come on, let's solve this." She lifts him back up onto the table. We all clamber up.

Deni says, "Gnog, we have all the pieces now."

"Yeah. Looks like! I guess... I guess this is it. This is where things turn around."

"OK - let's figure this out."
