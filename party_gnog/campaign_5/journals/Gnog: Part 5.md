# Gnog: Part 5
## DAY 13 (Riglan 50)

We awaken. Taz detects movement and with a soft click fully activates, and stands up. "Good morning!" Fee-Ree and Gnog wakes up. Deni is still asleep. "How was your first night's - uuh - sleep? Rest?" asks Fee-Ree.

Taz tries to explain. Gnog recognises the story and agrees. We didn't expect that, it was meant to be an emotional connection rather than memories. Interesting - the amulet has never been something we fully understood.

Our conversation wakes up Deni. We head down, have one last breakfast on our room budget and figure we can always try to re-hire a room if we need to, so don't just book another night on the off-chance. We eat well - Deni has three full plates! Taz sits watching, though we give him bits of things to taste.

We have some time to kill before our library meeting. Gnog remembers seeing something called "Gaspar's Reclamations" on Elaina's map, but it's not one he wrote down. Deni saw it when we went to the Great Market - it's on the edge - not far. She leads us there. It has a big illuminated sign, including the tagline, "You lose it, we find it!"

Inside are various pictures of presumed-famous people with someone else stood next to them, proudly holding an item - each one different. We're approached by a sales assistant who asks if there's anything they need to find. They're actually an investigative outfit, we learn; on the Rock, things "go missing" (i.e. get stolen!) and they track them down, for people who really want to find their original item and retrieve it. They operate off-rock if need be to find things. Almost as a joke, Gnog mentions the Ruby Palace - hilarious - though of course that's not ours to find. She does mention that there's an older, uncommon-now way to navigate; **proximity chain**. If you any close-by planes, dead gods (!), even shards of a reality; **if you know the thing you're looking for is close to the palace then you can create a chain by navigating from the first thing, then the next, and so-on to create a path that takes you closest to the thing you're interested in.** At each stage in the chain, you have a chance of finding people who are more familiar with the nearby things that let you move along to the next link, and so-on.

We thank her. If we ever lose anything on the Rock, we know where to come.

Still got more time, so we go to the nearby Sindiath Line - Deni had already spotted it in earlier wanderings and takes us straight there. It's tucked in amongst residential buildings, very heavily decorated, with bunting in green, gold and black; but it's not that big, 2 stories, but that said there's a high 15ft door on the ground floor so the 2nd floor does start quite high up.

Inside is a ~6ft tall, blue-skinned person, no hair or eyebrows; big, oval shaped eyes; ears; so humanoid in that respect, but humanoid. They wear a flowy, oversized shirt and stand behind a countertop. There seems to be some sort of queue, though there is another counter with nobody at it - we try our luck and walk up there. Gnog, Perception 11+7; he can just see, over the desk, something moving; Gnog leans forward and says, "hello there?" - a head pops up. It's an insect head. It makes some clicking noises, but then we hear, telepathically it seems, "Sorry! One moment please!" and it re-emerges wearing a small cap. It (telepathically) asks what we want.

We enquire about destination options and passage cost for the four of us. Four? Three? Taz is asked if he needs a bed or seat - technically neither! A seat only, it's cheaper. We ask about Ravnica or Krynn. Krynn we learn is off-limits - no lines go to Krynn. Recent troubles! Will resume in near-future, but uncertain when. Ravnica then... A book is opened, full of tables of numbers, and flipped through by the insectoid clerk. A ship is departing *tonight* at 11pm. One person, travelling dormitory-style, 300gp per person! At least that's a return trip. Private room for 3 people - with 4 seats! - 1500gp for the room, return. We learn that a smaller charter will depart in 6 days, also, with only a single class; only one room dormitory-style room, same price.

After regarding us for a moment, we're told there is also a more private "special service". Interested? Yes, we think?! "**Tomo**! Tomo to front desk!" is called and a well-dressed halfling with a jaunty cap appears; a collared, button-up long sleeve shirt, a tweed jacket, pressed pants and shiny boots. "Yes? Tomo at your service!" - the clerk clicks a while and we're beckoned into a back room. We're offered seats and sit (Taz a little awkwardly, after a delay, seeing that it's "the done thing"). We are shown three ships. They can be hired with a spelljammer and a basic crew on a daily basis. If we land on a planet with a Sindiath Line branch we don't keep paying, but if we land on another world, the hire charges continue. There's a returnable deposit if the ship is in good condition. The three ships:

* Similar to Elaina's (Mert's) ship, a sort of wasp-like or damsel fly design - Spelljammer and 1 crew - 85gp per day; we know that the space there is very tight
* A beautiful ship with flowing fins for wings and a tail - we saw a similar model taking off from the Toril academy - Spelljammer, captain, bosun and chef - 300gp per day; everyone could have their own room
* For people who need extra protection - an older design, metal, looks a bit like a scorpion; many armaments for defence - Spelljammer, captain and a security team of 6 - 140gp per day; the four of us would be in a single room shared

The ships all travel at similar speeds once clear of obstacles, though the damsel fly is somewhat faster. The average across all ships would be 5-7 days. It takes two days to clear the system we're in, then astral sea. Ravnica is a small system so it doesn't even take a full day to get into Ravnica Station once back in Wildspace.

He does mention that if we want ships, there are smaller ones - look at The Edge and the Mercane Agency. They have authority and contacts. He does point out that the galleon has many facilities and a private room is almost as good as charter for privacy, but with the benefit of many more on-board services during the voyage.

It's been a helpful conversation and surprisingly free of "hard sell". He gives us a card.

Library o'clock - we head over. There's some kind of lecture happening at the forum. Three people seem to be debating each other on the floor, with many students sat around on the terraced seats encircling. We walk "up and around" rather than "through". It's a discussion about interactions with "developing worlds". Gnog notices (perception 21) Miken and is going to ask Fee-Ree and Deni if we should say "hi", only to see that Deni has already dropped down next to him! We see them chatting; she gives him a bit of a hug; then gets back up to us. Miken turns and waves, a bit red in the cheeks, so we wave back. We see that either side of him are two girls about his age. The three are attending the lecture together.

We only have a short time listening but Taz is intrigued, as he's not heard live debates before. "There has been much written on this!" he says. But we have to scuttle along to our appointment. We're greeted by the assistant to the archivist. He says that it's fascinating - we realise, not the lecture, but the reactions of the people watching. Apparently, Taz would really like tomorrow's lecture - it's about the "autonomy and independence of created life" - Autognomes - and others. There are something called Warforged, from the closed-off system of Eberron. A few made it out, but it's a difficult world to get to as the system is closed to the rest of the Astral Sea. You can get to the system, but it's then hard to enter. (**We remember that this is where Morgan is from, so that's another problems they'll have to solve**). Warforged were only first created around 15 years ago, so none are older; and they hear that since then, creation has been banned, so they're young and finite. One will speak at the lecture tomorrow.

We get to the archivist's room. The other academics are there drinking tea; the archivist is fetched - she was making some last notes. Everyone ends up in the room and we are presented with a scroll detailing the findings.

* (1st scholar) Various aspects of the crystal make them quite sure that the shard is material found in Sardior's plane...
* (2nd scholar) ...or a simply a material never encountered before from elsewhere, which behaves in a way that aligns with the mythology of Sardior.
* (1st scholar)  There are references to Sardior and Sardior's children (gem dragons) in many cultures and planes...
* (2nd scholar) ...but the only one that one of the scholars considers *reliable* is in Krynn's archives. They have no means of contacting anyone on there.
* (1st scholar) ...but we think there's no need, as the existence of the Ruby Palace is in too many cultures to be a myth or coincidence...
* (2nd scholar) ...and we think there are other things you might find interesting

(they start drawing things on the board). They've tried to trace the 7-years-ago event. We handed a sheet of paper in unusual writing which I can't understand - 6 seconds later, Taz is translating. It's in Breland, a scientific/technical language of a nation of Eberron. They're correlating dates...

(...Gnog has a strange feeling. Surely... This can't be related to Morgan's chase...)

...it's all educated guesswork, within order-of-months at best but not even down to an exact week. It's too difficult to figure out planetary and Astral Sea time passage. There was apparently a cataclysm on **Eberron** 7 years ago which **wiped out a nation called Syre** at the height of a war, which had pulled all major nations together. (The assistant chips in - the Warforged were created a few years prior specifically to take part in this war). There is peace, of some kind; a treaty; an uneasy cease-fire if anything; because of the complete destruction of an entire nation, the area covered with such wild magic that it is completely uninhabitable. Nobody on Eberron apparently knows what happens, though; that world is putting in considerable effort for study, but has yet to find a cause. Since nobody knew why it occurred, it ended the war - fear of it happening "to me", for each nation.

The timing is about right for Fee-Ree's incident and, as best we can determine, there was the cascade explosion in the Izzet League laboratory. We still don't know if any of these are causes or effects, but they were interested to note that it was in **Niv-Mizzet's laboratory** - a gem dragon himself, who founded the Izzet League.

There's a 3rd theory. It's a little sensitive. It's not a suggestion to travel to the world involved due to rules being in place about travel there. If we felt compelled to go there, we'd need to do so without revealing our origins at all - Toril, Bral, anything. It's the **world of Theros**. That's the world which created gods through power of belief. It is believed to have strong evidence for the existence of Sardior, outside of Krynn. They do though have a belief in a great crystal serpent, which would be an archaic word to describe a dragon (and their language's alternative translation might be 'wyrm'). Crystals can be any colour, too; could be ruby. Apparently, about 7 years ago, one of the great heroes of that plane - one of their demigods - the one who escaped, in fact - vanquished (defeated) this serpent and banished it back to its nether realm. The demigod then went on search to find the Ruby Palace and, apparently, did so. He didn't know that the Sardior of the greater universe is not necessarily the evil crystal serpent of his world; he intended to kill the creature. Upon finding Sardior - it is believed - he realised his error. They believe the demigod went back to Theros upon discovering this.

Finally they give us a chart that makes a reasonable guess at placing Ravnica, Theros, Krynn, Eberron and Toril relative. It's more of an indication that despite planar difficulties but gives us an idea of which systems are closer and whether we might be passing by one if going on the way to another. It doesn't need to be precise or accurate; it's just based on days of drift on the astral sea and a good enough yardstick (but it'll only be even that accurate for a few years).

We thank them and say, if we're able to, that we'll come back this way to let them know what happened.

We figure we'll try to find Beevi again. Fortunately, it being morning, she is at the market on the same stall as last time. She looks almost nervous and starts to bring out tools. We explain there's nothing wrong with the timepiece. We ask about the Izzet League and she laughs, thinking we're joking. We have to explain that we are unfortunately entirely serious.

* Niv-Mizzet is a *very* temperamental, formidably intelligent being that most people have not met.
* He is a recluse. There are probably ways to see him; Beevi doesn't know. He uncle might.

We ask if it's possible to see him; we point out that we're happy (indeed, feel almost obliged) to pay for any information and not here to waste anyone's time. Beevi calls out - "**Beena! There are some people here!**" - and an older male gnome pops his head out. Explanations all round. Beena says, there's only one person who might be able to help - his sister, who is on Ravnica, at least for the moment. She travels a lot. "The best of the artificers." Her name is **Vi**. We learn that the Sindiath Line's station is not on the surface, it's in space, like a small moon; they shuttle people down to the surface occasionally but most people there don't know about travel between the planes (so, perhaps not so different from Toril) - even though the Izzet League is heavily involved with the organisation that formed the Spelljammer League.

We're given a workshop address.

I think this kind of makes our minds up... Ravnica it is, we think. Beevi on hearing this digs around in a bag and asks us to pass on something to Vi - she hands us a letter. Absolutely! We give it to Taz for safe keeping, hoping that they perhaps trust autognomes more than people.

We figure we'll investigate ships. Ravnica is easy, but Theros is the opposite. We go to the Mercane Agency first. We're taken to a room and we explain that we're interested in a ship. A human salesperson tells us:

* Spelljamming helm including installation, if we have a spaceworthy frame, is **8000gp**.
* In this conversation Taz suddenly pipes up - "**I can operate a spelljamming helm!**" - he's accessing information as need arises.
* There are three ships available right now, but one is quite high-end. Glorious in fact, but we know it'll be beyond our price range!
* There is a flying fish ship. We've seen that before. It can take up to 10 people. It *can* float and, in fact, cannot be kept on land. It's also made of wood. One of the most common vessels in Wildspace. This particular one is ex-Sindiath Line, so it's configured for passengers rather than work. Weapons have been removed except for a single ballista. It would be 25,000gp.
* There's also a wasp ship. It's a bit like the damsel fly, but made of wood and smaller; it is light and fast, though not quite as fast as the damsel; it'll only take 5 crew. We see to our surprise that it looks almost like a familiar-to-us normal ship, but with metal extensions. It's not seaworthy, though, but the metal extensions are supporting legs that let it land on the ground. The tail of the wasp ship is small, hollow and mostly used for just a water store. There's only a single top-mounted weapon. It's in good condition, better than the flying fish ship, sold by a private aristocrat. It's configured as a pleasure craft - its cargo hold is a room. It's 27,000gp.

We get another card from this salesperson. We are interested in the fish ship perhaps, but might also see if we can get a salvage hull or similar. He whispers at us - we should perhaps **speak to the Matron at The Edge**. Gnog gives him a gold piece for the tip.

On the way out we see a big picture of a blue giant. There's a name: **Vocath**. Looks abut 14ft tall.

Later, Deni reminds us that Vocath might be behind *this* specific agency. Mercanes are, says Taz, an aloof and reclusive race of blue giants with no scruples about what they buy or sell. They'll even buy and sell people if need be. Deni says it sounds like there are few of them around and this particular agency is just an agency of his merchant empire. He is unlikely to be here himself. It was Vocath that seemed to have instigated the business at the Toril Academy. He clearly has designs on our world; perhaps for trade, perhaps for worse.

Maybe we can find out if Vocath is due to ever come here and arrange to be on the Rock at the same time.

Early lunch time at The Edge. It's a noisy, busy place. Apparently it is prized for balcony seats which look over the edge of the rock - umm, maybe not! It is a large building, with 3 storeys. The street-level is the top floor, actually, with two floors beneath street level. Each floor seems to have different music. We ask an enthusiastic greeter - quietly! - if we can have a conversation with The Matron. It doesn't seem a secret! Head down to the next floor, as behind the bar will be this Matron person. Indeed, behind a beautiful carving bar with views out over the balconies behind it for the benefit of customers seated there, with bottles hanging above on ropes, is who we overhead is called **Vikka** - the Matron - another insectoid person, making drinks easily with her four arms.

Drinks are made and we're welcomed to take a seat. Gnog orders - a longshot perhaps? - dwarven ale. "Of course! No problem!" - a handle is cranked and a barrel and tap rotate into view. When they're being "spoken" to, Gnog realises he can't hear what she says - the telepathy seems private. She draws 3 ales, then a fourth and puts it in front of Taz. He can taste it. It turns out he'd been asked, telepathically, and had said yes (but he was expecting Gnog to drink most of it). It's actually pretty good and Gnog lets Taz know that.

Telepathically, things get more interesting. There might be a good price for one which... Needs to be moved off the rock quickly. And if it came back, it'd need to have been refitted / repainted in another space port first. At this we're given four drinks (one each) and told to take them down to the ice room. Deni pays, which is kind.

We walk down some stairs to a door behind an insulated wall with a carpet draped over it. We go in. It's very cold. There are magical cubes of cold, or something like them, some slushy snow on the floor and a bench. It smells a bit of fish. Three heads pop up above the bench. A fourth appears, with a fish. Penguins. One looks at Gnog and draws a dagger. Gnog proffers the drink! They get excited and flop over to us. We have to give them a "slushie" each, eagerly slurped. These four penguins look like they might be pirates or something! "You give us slushies. Vikka sent you!" "Ship for sale" "Who are you? Were you followed?" Deni is sure we aren't.

They talk about the ship. They're paranoid, but (Gnog insight 15) it actually doesn't sound like the ship is actually stolen. So we're not sure why it has to go off the rock so quickly, but that's not the reason. Taz pipes up. "Oh! Well, four **Dohwar** owning a ship." There was a change of circumstance in a family group... So that's something related to it. It's apparently a wasp in good condition. *Quite* good condition. Deni asks if it has a helm! Yes. It is spaceworthy they insist. Maybe needs some work inside. Configured for cargo. Price? All four speak at the same time citing different numbers. I ask Taz what the four numbers were.

Taz hears three of the four numbers (Perception 13+2). 15,000; 20,000; 16,000. The fourth said something else. Gnog helps with negotiations - Taz persuasion, 2 then 20! + 10 -> 30. They can fit a ballista and we get the 16,000 price. How much without? 15,000. Taz realises that they might not be quite capable of finding or fitting a ballista - they don't have one yet. Taz says 15,000 will be fine but he would like to see the ship first. They ask about money; we show them that we have it. They give us an address.

We head to the Smith's Coster, intending to get a ballista and trade in the Dragonfang Spear. We get the previously arranged 12,000gp equivalent in emeralds and are able to swap other currency since we also do buy from them the ballista for 100gp. It comes with 5 bolts. Gnog prefers caution and pays 50gp for a further 5 bolts, 10 in total, which he can just about carry and we ask if we can borrow a cart to tow the ballista; but it is rollable anyway so we can just push it along. We trundle our slow way along to the address which is in Low City, not far from the Drydock. A furtive Dohwar leads us to a side alley that the ballista *just* fits through and we get into a warehouse. Deni is running around all over the place checking for safety. There's a big lift of sorts, which we all fit onto, including the ballista. There are quite a few Dohwar here. The lift is cranked out - it actually extends sideways off the side of the rock, then drops down about 100ft. We're taken to a platform that's in front of a cave; there, behind a tarp painted to look like the rock, is the ship. It is fine, but for a few scorch marks; signs of battle. We realise the ballista was destroyed as we can see some remains in a corner. They have winches on the cave and they help us out to lift it up and get it in position; then we take off the wheels. They offer to fit it for us, for 50gp - hah. Fine. A group of Dohwar descend and hammer away, fitting it.

They ask for the emeralds - 15. We show them. They're very excited! We are given a tour of the tiny ship. It's a bit smelly inside! But it's in decent condition. The entrance has a glyph of warding, and we're told the "passcode":

* **Sardines**

...and Gnog realises we have some of the great smoked fish from Waterdeep and explain where it's from. That goes down well.

(The ship has around 175 of 250hp equivalent).

One grabs Taz's hand and grabs him to the spelljamming helm. Taz sits and thinks. He will need to attune to this, but then a Dohwar who is currently attuned arrives and transfers the attunement. With that done, he potters around casting Mending on scorch marks and suchlike.

Meanwhile, Gnog, Deni and Fee-Ree get to the question of the name, the ship has one but it mustn't be used anymore. They confess to having a run-in with the Xaryxian Empire (planet Xaryxis, tyrannical astral elves), because they stole some documents that were needed by an alliance fighting against tyranny. They used this ship for the heist, sneaking into a base. It means the ship is known to them and we're encouraged to scrub off identifying marks when we get a chance! Get it repainted; "make it our own" as much as possible. Give it a new name.

We're a bit concerned about provisions, but the Dowhar point out that we can do fishing! They even give us two fishing rods. They insist on giving us a barrel of water (at least it lets us store stuff from Deni's bottle more conveniently) and a sack of vegetables. Gnog over-pays 10gp.

Everything to our satisfaction? Yep! We get on board and Taz asks if he can use the sending stone. Of course. He says, "Zorbu And Rerdian, Parents, A Very Interesting Group! I Am Learning A Lot. We Are Flying To Ravnica On Our Own Ship! Farewell. Back Soon."

The tarp is being rolled up and Gnog shouts down, "Say thanks to Vikka for us". The assembled Dowhar are waving - Gnog won't forget the sight of waving penguins for a long time.

Taz feels like he has what he thinks would be called pins & needles for other people suddenly; and then, he can sense the ship itself, as an extension of himself. The wasp wings start to beat as he concentrates on moving and he gently moves forwards, a little unsteady at first; we clear the cave safely and hear cheering behind from the Dowhar, we're waving back of course; the ship rounds the rock and starts to pick up speed.

We're away.

### In flight, late afternoon day 13

Taz has proficiency in navigation tools, so has an advantage when it comes to the spelljamming helm. It works out as spellcasting modifier, plus proficiency modifier, with advantage (D20+7).

First roll 21; Taz navigates cleanly away from the Rock and on course for Ravnica. Gnog's on the weapons deck, checking over the ballista. A large ship is flying in, dragging behind in a huge net chunks of ice asteroids. He shouts down to Fee-Ree and Deni so they can come and look. Other ships fly up and surprisingly, fire ballistae at the large asteroid; this breaks off chunks which they drag down into the lake.

After about 10 minutes (5.5-ish mph) we've cleared the air bubble of the Rock and our own gravity plane asserts; we see we have our own air bubble, extending 100ft beyond the extents of the ship lengthwise and 20 feet either side width/depthwise (so 300-350ft long, 60-70ft wide). We pick up speed dramatically once clear of the Rock's influence. The wings extend even further, extending the air bubble with them - more of a disc than a sausage! - and Taz feels as if space around him is moving past quickly (100m miles in 24h).

We figure we three will need to run watch shifts while Taz flies; something like 8 hours on, 8 hours break (but in practice, the two awake people will share watch) and 8 hours sleep. It means two of us awake at any time. Taz is able to speak while flying, especially in the easier "cruising" phase, and we agree that we can take watch on the top deck above the spelljamming helm so we can chat with him from time to time.

Gnog notices a few lights floating around, following the ship, within the air bubble. Perception 18. 3 will-o-wisps. Hmm. They don't seem to be doing much other than hitching a ride. Fee-Ree on watch, Deni is asleep.

```
Period   1  2  3
Fee-Ree FW FB FS
        DS DW DB
        GB GS GW
```

On her break, Fee-Ree chats to Taz and realises that she can't navigate the ship but could fly it to give Taz breaks for recharging. They'd transfer atunements at the switchover.

D100->73 => Taz finds the ship sluggish, and has to slow right down. He realises that to the starboard, about a mile away, is a large object that has exerted influence and caused us to drop out of fast travel. Perception: Nat 20+2. It's a ship, roughly the shape of a scorpion. He recalls the ship for hire with the security crew of similar shape so is not immediately alarmed but does call up to Fee-Ree to point it out. Gnog hears too; he comes down, gives Fee-Ree the sypglass and looks with his own literal eagle eyes. The ship is clearly visible. Shapes are moving around on the deck. Fee-Ree gives him the spyglass back so see if he can tell what it is - perception Nat 20+7. Hobgoblins and a bugbear! They're in uniform, so his alarm is tempered by that; pressed, white and green uniforms tend to indicate that these are legitimate crew. Fee-Ree asks if we should wake Deni, but Gnog thinks we'll wait and see. We maintain our heading and after about a minute, it definitely looks like the scorpion ship is also maintaining. Taz (intelligence check nat 1!) uses Built For Success, lucky 4, so with proficiency and intelligence he just scrapes to 10. He calculates that we'll be within 100 feet of each other. If the air bubbles touch then we'd be able to speak.

Gnog gets up to the weapons deck and readies the ballista just in case. Gnog sees that people on deck have a spyglass, so Gnog waves. They look around at each other and one hesitantly waves back. The bugbear leaves deck and goes down below. It seems they might have relaxed. 3 hobgoblins are on deck. As it gets closer, Gnog sees the ballista they have isn't loaded, so stops trying to figure out how to load his.

As we get very close, the bugbear reappears. Gnog asks Taz if they can just graze the air bubbles to say hello; Taz slows a little to make that happen. The people on board look a bit more surprised but the bugbear seems to try and calm them, and calls up someone from below who is dressed like a priest. Suddenly, we can hear them. It's the Message spell. "What are you doing? Why are you slowing down? You can reply to this message" Gnog replies, "We are new to Spelljamming and you are the first ship we have met. We just wanted to say hello." Another message. "Right... We have you just departed from?" "Rock of Bral" "How long ago?" "About 5 hours" - and then the air bubbles merge. Smelly air. Gnog shouts, "Long voyage? Not far now!" "Yes, we might pull into the Rock of Bral - we are only a few days out from our air turning foul. We've been out for 100 days on patrol. Word of advice! Don't touch the air bubbles of vessels you don't know, it can be seen as a hostile act - that's how ships steal air" Gnog says "Thank you, we didn't know - but hopefully this actually helps clear your air up a bit because ours is new. But I apologise for the alarm caused and we'll be more careful in future."

As we sail past, Gnog reads "Claws Of Huraj" and just before the air bubbles separate Gnog shouts back, "Safe sailing!" - the Priest asks what the name of our ship is! - Gnog shouts, "Oh, repaint underway, it's Tazythas The First".

A little while later, we're free of influence and return to full speed. The rest of Fee-Ree's watch passes uneventfully.



## DAY 14 (Riglan 51)

Deni goes on watch, Gnog sleeps and Fee-Ree goes on break, chatting to Taz a little about flying the ship. Deni's watch is good. Perception 24. Towards the very end of Deni's Watch, in Taz's 15th hour of flying, we drop down slow again. Taz sees something - Deni confirms a shipwreck. We sail closer to see what it is. A galleon is in two pieces. Debris floats around in the space between. There seem to be no bodies. There is cargo; food, other things, water mist, but no bodies at all. Taz suggests that the presence of valuables and the absence of bodies might, if he were to risk being paranoid, look like a rather obvious trap.

We try at least to rope in a crate. Deni ties the rope to an arrow and tries to hit one. 28! Hits easily. She and Fee-Ree reel it in. It contains trade goods; jars of preserved vegetables. Was this a pirate attack? Slavers? It's too high risk. We can ask at Ravinca Station. We fly on, and a mile out, we pick up speed.

Gnog's watch is on. Taz mentions he's getting a bit tired and Gnog realises we may have to change our watch approach! Perception: 18. D20->19, D100->74 => Gnog hears cursing sounds or similar coming from the helm. Wut? "Not again!" says Taz, as the ship slows once more. Another ship. Gnog perception adv. due to spyglass -> 17 -> a damsel fly ship is going very, very fast; it has changed course and is flying towards us. Waving, on board, he sees a person next to the ballista which is pointing down. The mangonel is fully extended, so not primed. The smallish form is waving. Another head pops up and waves too. A flag too! Colourful and striped. Gnog shouts down to Taz, "yeah, another one, they're not ready to fight and seem harmless, they're signalling us; can we slow to intercept?" - and Taz within a few minutes is slowing almost to a stop. As they get close, their ship moves up above us. They put something on their heads - they're hadozee - they leap off their ship and glide out - between the bubbles, and the things they put on give them little air bubbles - then they land on our forward deck, so Gnog comes down. They shake his hand. "How we can we help?" "I am **King Kalu**." "An honour, your majesty!" "Oh, it's not a title, it's a name. I'm an explorer. We are explorers. This is the **Mystic Voyage**." At this, Gnog sees a fourth person asking to come over; Gnog beckons them down; they launch from a hand crossbow a rope with attachment shouting, "Catch!" - one of the Hadozee leap and catch it. We're asked permission to tie it to the ship. It's a drow! Female, braided hair; introduces herself, "Hi, I'm with King. We're a crew of explorers out and about. What brings you out into the far reaches of the system?"

Gnog explains we're on our way to Ravnica trying to explain a strange magic surge 7 years ago, but on a path that might lead us to needing to find the Ruby Palace.

"Don't suppose you want to trade?!" - and they open a backpack. There's all kinds of stuff. They ask if we want to buy devices that provide an air bubble for 24h, but only once, then it's spent. They have two spare. 60gp each. They have various art artefacts; one seems to be a statue of a cross-legged seated elephant man. 50gp. Gnog is considering the 170gp purchase when Taz pipes up from down below, trying to be persuasive from the spelljammer seat, including warning them about the dodgy-looking wreck along this course that we saw a while ago. Only 2+10! Not much effect. So Gnog aggress and buys the three items.

Before they head off, they give us a bowl of desert flowers. They seem to not decay - they'll last for months.

They also warn us that a Star Moth is on patrol in the Astral Sea just outside Realm Space. Taz later mentions that it's an Astral Elf ship - so our visitors must have recognised our scorch marks and figured we might want to avoid those kinds of ships. Which is true! They tell us where they saw it most recently and advise on a slightly longer but safer path to avoid it. We thank them and they depart (through complicated means of gravity and geometry).

We are finally able to pick up speed again and are on our way. Towards the end of Gnog's watch Taz mentions that he's getting low on energy and should ideally rest. Con save: only 3+4. He would get a point of exhaustion but to avoid that, at Fee-Ree's watch, Gnog suggests a switch-up and Fee-Ree takes the helm for the first time, allowing Taz to sleep. Gnog goes on a 6 hour break, Deni wakes onto a now-shorter 6 hour watch.

```

Fee-Ree is unsure if she's flown correctly but when Taz finally wakes back up he checks and it's all fine. We slow down though as a pod of Kindori is coming by.

By the 3rd 6-hour period, we seem to be reaching the edge of the system. Colours "thin out" in a particular direction. It gets darker and darker. The ship starts to slow down and approaching the system boundary, there is a 3 mile ish range where we go at normal slow speed. It takes about 30-40 minutes. Wispy trails of silver become visible, almost like an oil slick, across otherwise empty sky. Rocks seem to have accumulated here, asteroids and debris in clumps. Our course takes us quite close to one.

Taz (perception 13) senses movement in the asteroid clump - it's moving towards us quickly. He shouts a warning and Deni raises the spyglass. A very small, very black ship, hiding. She shouts for Fee-Ree to wake Gnog. She yells down at the hatch and he comes up to the weapons deck. The ship is closer now. It looks like a blueish-black spider, with some purple hints on a shiny carapace. There is webbing attached to its legs! A sharp prow is pointed at us. It's travelling faster than our maximum speed, aiming for us.

Gnog shouts down to Taz to ask if he can avoid the impact. Taz tries to move but spell check is only nat 1 + 7, so no good. There are too many rocks around and it's Taz's first rodeo. The ship is closing fast, perhaps only 1000ft away. Still too far for the ballista, Gnog perception 19, Gnog notices that the ship has rotated and a red glass back has retracted and two ballistas and a mangonel are present. The mangonel is being wound. We're massively outgunned. Gnog shouts to Taz, "No pressure but we're a bit outgunned here so if there are any inventive courses you can plot, now's the time!" and gets the ballista loaded. (Gnog's strength is high enough to not need a check for that).

Taz knows a range of 200-800ft for a mangonel and Gnog knows it from Mert's ship. We think our ship is faster in a straight line than theirs, it was only approaching fast because of an oblique course that combined our speeds and caught us unawares. As Taz is thinking this, Gnog shouts, "Can we make a run for it in a straight line for the barrier?" and Taz gives it ago. Via Built For Success, 16 total, he rotates and tilts slightly, straightens out and gets fairly close to full speed while avoiding asteroids. The course correction inevitably means we get within 800ft of the other ship. They get ready to fire.

Initiative:

* Deni: 22
* Fee-Ree: 22
* Taz: 19
* Gnog: 9

Deni gains insight for fighting, 22 against a nat 1+whatever-doesn't-matter on the enemy ship. She realises that the ballista has a range of 480; she pulls out her longbow. 600ft at disadvantage range, but she has skills that can negate some of that.

Fee-Ree casts Crown Of Stars on herself. The last time we saw *that* from her, we were fighting Tiamat.

Skittering creatures are on the open deck; Neogi, alive this time, last seen in pieces after trying to take out Mert. Gnog shouts, "not wanting to freak anyone out but those are the lay-eggs-in-you things, we don't want them on board". The mangonel now fires. Despite disadvantage of range they strike the ship (5d10 -> 34). "I only just fixed that!" shouts Fee-Ree, who'd been doing Mending in down-time.

Taz gets the hang of his manoeuvers (navigation check total 25), turning the ship to rotate the damaged side away and turning to bring some distance at full possible speed. It's strafing to force them to re-aim and reposition weapons, while bringing us in within limit of range. Gnog brings out his longbow too. As he's swinging around he doesn't have much of a plan (intelligence check 1+2!) but Deni tells us to keep circling and spiralling around on a side of them that biases towards only one ballista, the other being unable to point our way. We're about 700ft out. Deni now uses her insight on the crew, rather than the ship. She wants to thin crowd and focuses on a smaller one, getting some insight into their behaviour.

Fee-Ree keeps ready. She says, "should we board them?" and Gnog says, "it might be strangely safer than firing at this kind of range!" "I can cast fly... But we'll need to be closer." so Gnog, torn between staying on mission and fleeing or getting in there and taking them all out... But it seems we're agreeing on the angry path as it's been too long since we had a good fight so he agrees and Fee-Ree cast three of us, once Taz has moved us in close enough; Taz needs to stay piloting the ship, else the enemy ship could simply fly away and leave us stranded on it.

Another rock is thrown from the mangonel. Creatures are loading a ballista bolt too.

Taz as requested flies in, getting within 600ft; Fee-Ree releases the spell. Aaaand, an umber hulk appears. As if it wasn't annoying enough already. Two swarms of hatchlings appear.

Gnog looks for the biggest Negoi (perception nat 20+7) and fires twice with disadvantage, luckily letting two hits for a total of 17 damage. He doesn't jump and fly for fear of the attackers turning their ship and flying away, leaving him adrift without air.

The attacker ship now turns and moves in towards us. This means the distances are much shorter - about 520ft. It leaves the mangonel at the wrong angle but their ballista fires (disadvantage) and misses, the bolt going wide. A second umber hulk appears. The deck is crowded. Perhaps a fireball might work.

Deni aims and attacks a smaller Neogi. It's an easy hit and a sneak hit due to insight for fighting. 13 + 8d6 -> 48 (wut?! All 6s on digital roll - for real - we took a screenshot!) - 61 damage. This obliterates the Negoi! Gnog goes, "huh, show-off ;-)"

Fee-Ree prepares a firebolt.

The aggressors load the ballista again. A bigger Negoi grabs a hold of a nearby Negoi and casts something which appears to be - yep; they appear above us; it's Dimension Door. They land on the weapons deck. A strange psychic attack tries to charm Gnog. DC 14, 7 is rolled, luck point, makes it - 22. Fee-Ree near-simultaneously reacts, releasing her firebolt at the nearest, which is the smaller of the two. It hits, doing 3d10->20 damage.

Taz continues the avoidances and we're now 420ft away.

An umber hulk seems to be signalling to the small Negoi swarms which and up arrayed together, a 5x10ft mass.

Gnog rages, drops the longbow, draws the Stormbringer Maul and tries a crushing blow on the bigger Neogi. It's a hit (16+12) for 16 (including rage) damage, plus a DC18 con save (fail) for 2d12 -> an additional 7 damage (but suffers various disadvantages until the end of its next turn.

The other ship is closing on us, too; we're at 340ft range.

The small pirate on our boat attacks Gnog, trying to bite and claw twice. The bite is 21, matching AC to hit; there's 11 damage including poison; DC12 con save is impossible for Gnog to fail. A claw finds its mark too, for 3 more damage, but the other misses. Meanwhile, on their ship, another pirate aims their ballista.

Deni figures she can only get an advantage over people on board; she's over by the ballista from aiming it, probably unseen; she fires at the large Neogi. She misses, but she's at least able to spend some time focusing on gaining more insight on the crew of the other ship, and gains good insight on one of the umber hulks.

Fee-Ree uses her crown to attack the larger Neogi. 29 more damage. Fee-Ree tries to finish it off with 3 eldritch blasts, hitting twice; it only does 7 damage but that takes the creature down.

The ballista is fired and *just* manages to get a hit. It's a high 22 damage, too.

Taz hears the impact but he hears people still shouting about range and distance above so keeps his pattern going.

We get within 240ft range.

The umber hulks look like they might be getting ready to pounce. Each swarm starts to climb up each hulk.

Gnog attacks the remaining on-board Neogi, hitting once and taking it down. With his remaining part of his action he manages to retrieve the longbow and stows it in the quiver before taking flight and heading directly towards the ballista Neogi. He travels 60ft, so is still within the air bubble.

Their ship is still closing at fast rate. The ships are only 160ft apart - leaving Gnog only 100ft away.

On board their ship, the Neogi pirate once again loads the ballista. Both umber hulks are now covered in their swarms.

Deni flies 120ft, using her dash action, getting within 40ft of the umber hulk upon which she had insightful fighting earlier. No advantage, but sneak due to the prior insight. Crit! 2d8+9 -> 14 and 16d6 (!) -> 55 -> 69 damage.

Fee-Ree sees everyone else flies off and shouts back to Taz, "We're boarding their ship!" and Taz knows he has to keep the ships from colliding but also keep them close enough for his crew to be able to return. She flies towards the enemy and casts L5 fireball into the middle of the enemy fray. She's aiming on deck at everything - the ballistae, mangonel, umber hulks with their swarms and the last Neogi pirate. 44 damage to the ship and weaponry. Dex saving - Neogi pirate fails, 44 damage -> killed outright; uninjured umber hulk succeeds, 22 damage; its swarm, fails, 44 damage -> most is burned away, only a few skittering creatures left; the next swarm, same deal; a final Neogi pirate succeeds, taking 22 damage; the injured umber hulk takes full damage and is killed. Fee-Ree also has her stars crown and releases a star at the remaining umber hulk, it looks like it'd miss (16) so she reacts to bend luck with 2 sorcery points (2) -> just gets a hit (18). 24 damage.

Taz starts to rotate and match course on the Neogi ship, close enough for air bubbles; he gets within 60 feet. He prepares to potentially disconnect and come up to the foredeck, but is worried that the enemy ship has its own spelljammer who might try to flee.

On deck, enemies move in preparation for boarders.

Gnog tries to do a hadozee, flying in high over the ship and trying to figure out how to fall. It's 40ft but fuck it. Athl.check with advantage (raging) 3,6+10 -> 16. He does figure out how to fall and does land on the ship - with a dex save total 21, which surprises even himself at being relatively light-footed, especially in such an unfamiliar and disorientating environment, doing a potential 6 damage but for raging. Only 3. He ends up right in the face of the umber hulk, next to the other pirate. He recklessly attacks the umber hulk twice, doing 30 damage total.

Suddenly the ship halts completely and there is skittering noise as, Gnog assumes, the spelljammer leaves the seat and comes our way.

The pirate attacks Gnog, gaining advantage from Gnog's recklessness. The bite does 4+9 damage; the claws both miss.

Deni is flying, but in range of the umber hulk; she sees it is now engaged in melee; she aims and fires, hitting for 15+26 -> 41 damage. The umber hulk falls. Fee-Ree moves in and throws a firebolt at the remaining Neogi pirate, but it critically misses; so she blows another crown star, which fortunately hits and with 29 damage it kills the pirate.

Taz matches speed and in due course the half of the other ship, he disengages from the helm and flips up onto the foredeck. He can see most creatures dead, shouts a warning that their spelljammer must be coming and then fires an eldritch blast at some of the skittering spider creatures, one at each cluster. 11 damage on one; its gone; 12 damage on the other; both clusters are gone. There's a shout from below - "NO! MY BABIES!"

Gnog runs sideways and can see down a corridor; there is the creature. Swinging his maul down with one hand he reaches back to pull and throw his remaining Javelin Of Lightning. It hits, doing 20 damage including lightning (5d6+5). In response the creature yanks out the javelin, casts it aside and uses an enslaving psychic charm again. Wisdom save 18; Gnog resists (and he's raging anyway). Now it throws Hunger of Hadar. Pretty much the whole deck becomes a kind of portal into a void; blackness and bitter cold expands out. There are all sorts of strange whispers and sloshing sounds. Gnog is blinded there; his party can't see anything; but Taz can see through. The creature moves around behind Gnog, but he can't see it.

Taz shouts, "I can see them. It's like a spell of darkness but more painful!"; Deni can't do much - she flies around to maybe get a better angle on the ship if the darkness does drop; Fee-Ree makes a guess and casts Dispel Magic at L4. Luckily, it's an L3 spell; it falls and the deck is once again clearly visible. Gnog sees the Neogi.

Taz sees the danger from this caster and casts Silence (L2) over the deck, calling out to warn people what he's done.

Gnog runs up and recklessly attacks the remaining Neogi. He hits twice; 31 total damage. It retaliates - opening its mouth to try and speak but then realises it cannot do so due to the magical spell. Gnog hears it speaking in his head, instead; "There is no escaping from the Neogi! You may take us down, one ship, but the swarm will always win in the dark recesses of space. You will have to watch over your shoulder at every move!" - intimidation 19. Gnog 11 insight. He blows both insight and luck, but rolls a 1 and 3 for those! Perhaps we shouldn't have attacked them? Maybe they contacted their kin somehow? Yet, we're in too deep now anyway. The Neogi meanwhile bites for 3+3 damage and makes claw attack, which Gnog manages to just dodge.

Deni takes aim and fires; she hits, for 15+34 -> 49 damage. The Neogi falls.

Taz drops his spell and says he'll bring the ship closer. He goes back to the helm, comes up and over, flips the ship over and throws up - and then down (!) - a rope, which we tie off to keep the ships together. He climbs on board. Fee-Ree and Deni land; we check out the ship. It's dark, but the crown sheds light. It's a pretty huge ship! There is some damage where the fireball hit but little else.

Deni and Gnog investigate (Deni, investigation 24). We seem to be on a battle deck. There are two big kind of pens which we think the umber hulks would've been in. There is an armoury and two more front-facing ballistas. We descend a ramp, which leads to the bridge and spelljamming helm. There's a chart room, some quarters, a mess hall, galley, panty and two storage rooms, more quarters further back and there's something that looks like perhaps a 3rd umber hulk pen, but it's unused. At the back is a huge hold. Below is a 3rd deck with more quarters, a toilet and store room full of dead humanoid bodies prepared as food (!). Another cargo hold is present with quite a lot of 'stuff' in it. There's some kind of prison at the back too. **Within the prison cell we find two people alive**!

We call everyone down and check them out. Taz administers healing - he recognises them as two Githyanki, related to Rerdian's species, albeit a more militaristic branch of the Gith. Taz heals them both for 5. We give them some rations and Deni can give them water. Taz has to persuade them to talk - via Built For Success, total persuasion 21. He can speak in Gith, which helps. An entire group of them were on patrol and were captured, the rest since slaughtered.

* They recover artefacts from their companions from the various rooms
* We remove the helm (it takes a lot of effort) and stow it in our ship
* We'll burn the ship - the air bubble will support the flames enough until all is consumed, it's an appropriate sendoff for their warrios
* They will say prayers for their companions

We manage to find a strange thing; a Wildspace Orrery, which Taz is extremely excited about and hurries to install it in front of his helm seat. The Githyanki recover their weapons and armour in addition to their more personal belongings. They show us a treasure chest - with a combined equivalent of a pillaged 240pp present! That refills the coffers considerably.

Some lamp oil and even a barrel of pitch (used for blackening bright surfaces, apparently) is spread around, ensuring it trails all the way up to the top deck. We climb-descend the rope back to our ship, Githyanki too; Fee-Ree flies up, then throws a fireball - a good sendoff for their warriors - at level 4, for maximum effect. The ship goes up very quickly, burning with an ever-quickening, blazing hot fire which burns in a very strange way as the air bubble is consumed; the ship crumbles and breaks strangely as its gravity plane fails. Eventually the fire extinguishes abruptly, all air consumed. The two Githyanki say a blessing (prayer) for bringing their spirits back to the astral sea.

This was a huge learning experience for Taz; it's a strange form of training...

### (2500XP for everyone, but apprentice rules - 1250XP for most of us, 6250XP for Taz)

Taz reconnects to the helm. He's guided by the Githyanki, Fee-Ree listening intently. It's very important to know who you are, or you can lose yourself in the Astral Sea, apparently; at this, Taz disconnects from the helm, pulls out his family picture and attaches it to the inner hull to the side of the orrery, so he can see that as the last thing he looks at before reconnecting. He then prepares to transfer through.

We all have to focus that way, but it's easier perhaps for the experienced Toril crew. We pass through. It's like a strange membrane (like the gateways in The Expanse). The Githyanki seem almost meditative. We emerge into a quiet, calm, silver void. Behind we see strange reflections of silver and translucency; the wildspace can be seen through it. As the ship moves, the perspective is strange and we realise that it's a weird, 2D portal, just a kind of doorway. It's not like we're seeing some vast membrane encapsulating an entire system. It does seem more like inter-planar travel.

The Githyanki thank us and just sort of jump off the ship; they push off and float out. We notice at that point that there's no air. We aren't even breathing. Or are we? Somehow, we're not sure! Oh - right, we don't need more food after all... It's confusing.

Taz continues the flight throughout those two periods. Intelligence-based survival check: Only 5! He finds himself adrift; uncertain of the geometry of this plane. He does what he thinks would halt the ship and disconnects, then pops up up the hatch above the foredeck. He hears that the Githyanki had left. He confesses to being very confused by the region and unsure what to do. We show him the system map for Ravnica and remind him that it's all about remembering "who you are". Everyone on intelligence perception check:

* Gnog: 17. As Gnog starts to think about Ravnica, where we want to go - and he starts to float off the ship! He travels at 60ft speed (his innate higher speed in "normal" space does not seem to apply here). At this, Gnog gets confused and angry, rages and flies back using his 1/2 + full movement of weird eagle rage-fly. He recommends people be careful and maybe hold onto something when the think about destinations.

* Gnog has an idea. He drops his rage, thinks specifically "I want to go to Ravnica" and indeed starts to drift again; then thinks "I want to go to the ship" and comes back. He has a bit of an epiphany and realises he even knows "where", FSVO "where" the system is and has an impression of distance - about 4 24h equivalent periods. He conveys this information to the group.

* Deni it turns out is smart and was miles ahead, but she's happy to hear Gnog confirm what she thought was going on. In fact, she finds she can fly a fair bit faster than Gnog (70ft).

* Fee-Ree explains that this sounds like the way that she casts magic. Think about it and it just happens. She's a bit faster than Gnog but not as fast as Deni (65ft).

* Taz now tries. It works! He and Deni race each other for a bit.

We spend a bit of time looking around. The temperature isn't cold; it's somehow neutral. Neither cold nor warm. Perhaps this is how undead feel? Gnog gets brave and tries flying a long way. He gets beyond where he'd expect the gravity of the ship to be asserted and (house rule!) he feels the downward pull disappear, with the unpleasant "falling" stomach sensation. He has a think and suddenly feels a downward pull... Wow. He can actually control it. It's not clear how he might use it, since he apparently can fly freely here; could be useful for projective weapons in battle.

Ah! That's how breathing works, too. He can breathe if he wants to. He can eat if he wants to, but doesn't have to. It's how _everything_ works. He can fly because gravity is just kinda not asserting, or he's counteracting it.

We all share ideas; Taz returns to the helm, tries it out and is delighted to find he can control the ship actually, in many ways, more easily than in Wildspace, which is what he'd read and what his teachings had suggested but not what he'd initially found when he entered this unfamiliar realm. Over-thinking it!

We repeat "period 3" of the day, so Gnog gets a full rest. It makes our "day" long; perhaps this realigns us with Toril, after the Rock of Bral's "later" time. Next, Fee-Ree goes on a break, Deni sleeps and Gnog is on watch.

Gnog perception: 23.

Taz chats. He doesn't know if we're moving fast or slow. It doesn't seem Wildspace-fast, but we're going quickly enough. Gnog sees small astral fish of some kind, collecting around the ship. The light is strange. The horizon - and there seems to be something analogous to one - looks like the sun might rise, but all around, 360 degrees and it never does rise.

Later, with his spyglass, Gnog spots something that might be wrecks of ships, or natural, it's not clear. Taz can't see or detect it. Gnog tries to describe the rough direction relative to the ship's orientation, wanting to get a closer look. Taz manages to steer. Getting closer - two lumps. One about 5 times our ship, one similar size. Grey, pitted rock; almost like marble but full of pits/holes. Parts look smooth or carved but two surfaces are jagged. We try to move around to look at the smoother surfaces but we can't make any sense of it - close or far. It's like it's a small chunk of a VERY big statue. Fee-Ree can't figure it out either. It's almost shift change, so Fee-Ree takes the helm and we return to our Ravnica course.



## DAY 15 (Riglan 52)

Taz gets to rest. Fee-Ree flies; Deni is on watch and Gnog is on a break. Deni sees something she can't make out with the spyglass. Gnog's eyes get a clearer look. A distant shape, moving fluidly; 4-5 miles away. Gnog, perception 25: The rough shape is distinctly that of a dragon. It's not flying towards us and we don't know if it is metallic or chromatic or, indeed, gem. We can't risk approach, which is a shame.

Fee-Ree drops off shift and everyone is awake. She asks if we'd like to share a meal as a family. Of course! It's a great idea. Taz can have a plate of tasting portions. Taz asks, "family? I'm - my family is on the Rock of Bral?" and Deni points out that our group has bonded as a family would, with many extended family members. Taz has become part of it, and now we've been in battle together, that's sealed it! It's official. We are not his core family, we suppose; we buy he is *our* core family and we are his extended family.

Fee-Ree makes food. It's only a small amount; we don't *need* to eat. It's social bonding. We chat. Gnog does gesture to the strange environment around and taps the deck. "It's just incredible; barely a week ago we didn't know any of this existed at all. No idea, no concept, no imagination would have told us that there were such things. And here we are, with a new friend and a - a ship of the astral sea, of our own. It's... What's the word?" Deni says, "New! Oooh, novel. I heard that at university. It's novel."

We resume course with Taz at the helm. Fee-Ree sleeps, Gnog is on watch and Deni on break. Gnog perception 18 (via a luck point! else 10).

Gnog - wisdom saving - 18+3->21. He initially feels perturbed; he's not sure how he feels about the lack of any change in the light, the timelessness. He takes out Beevi's chromometer, which helps him at least have a reference. It helps him keep grounded. Then suddenly he sees, off to the port side (left), flashes of light. With the spyglass he sees two ships! One pursues the other, the chasing ship shooting out rays of searing bright light. It has gossamer wings, relatively large. The other looks more like a flat-topped ship with kite-like fins at the side and a swallow tail.

Gnog calls up Deni and shows her. He says, "I want to help, but I reckon that's the astral elves and we're no match for that firepower." New perception roll; 24. The other ship is quite manoeuvrable and is darting around, trying to escape. It seems to be gaining distance. We can stay our course, or angle away to perhaps avoid being seen. There's nowhere to hide out here, so Gnog "flies" down to the foredeck and shouts down to Taz a rough indication of a change of direction and we veer off, trying to maintain maximum distance; it's more or less ass-to-elves, minimising visible cross section. We keep that up until Gnog can't really see it anymore with the spyglass, which takes about 45 minutes, then return to course.

Third period. Fee-Ree and Deni are on watch; Gnog sleeps; Taz flies. At the watch's end, Deni points out to Gnog that we're being followed by something that is keeping its distance.

Fourth period: Gnog checks out our follower while Deni sleeps and Fee-Ree is on a break. Taz is in his last flying period. It seems to be an apparition, made of starlight; like looking at starts from a distance. Gnog asks Taz, but Taz is having to temporarily focus on navigation (rolls Nat 1 on history!). Gnog waves at it. It still follows but its stance changes and then it waves back! Over time, as Gnog has become used to it, he's realised he can see what appear to be starlike things in the Astral Sea; but they're actually portals, the lights from their systems beyond shining through. This creature's appearance reminds Gnog of a starry night on Toril, but with the stars coalesced into a shape.

The shape stays about 1000ft away. Meanwhile, Gnog perception: 16. Taz yells! "Are you seeing what I'm seeing?" and Gnog, no longer distracted by the strange creature, sees a really large ship appearing, crossing our path, about a mile away. It looks like a huge cannon! Just with a ship built around the back part of it. The cannon is ornate. There is a large flag; decorative, with a crest and a two lions. Gnog recognises the canon and firearms, it rings a bell and despite a terrible history check, pulls out his Giff Brought Guns To Galaxy book and looks inside the front cover. The flag is there, or close enough. This is a Giff ship - hopefully not hostile. Gnog shouts down to Taz to make sure we don't hit it but it should be safe.

A flare goes up from the ship and bursts. It's blue. Gnog asks Taz if blue flare significant? Taz history 24: From memory, blue is a sign of peace. Gnog asks if Taz can make any kind of blue flare illusion while in the helm, but Fee-Ree as been overhearing it all and runs up to see if she can help with spells. She creates a blue Chromatic Orb, throwing it into the sky to burst above us. Gnog asks Taz to navigate "towards" the Giff ship, intending to come alongside at or above their deck level.

A few uniformed Giff stand on deck, dressed in blue white and gold. They wave a blue banner. One yells, "Ahoy there! What brings you to the Astral Sea on this fine - day? Day!"

Gnog yells back, "Ahoy there, valiant Giff crew! We are explorers en route to Ravnica."

"We are on a patrol keeping the peace. Will you join us for a spot of tea? It is tea time!" - that's an offer we can't refuse. We follow instructions to pull alongside and they invite us aboard. Taz can leave the ship; Deni stays on board, sleeping. We compliment them on their smart uniforms and there is smalltalk about the book that Gnog is still holding.

We are invited to the Captain's Galley. "**Welcome aboard the Lionheart Crest**". Gnog says, "We're on the Navigator. This is Tazythas, or Taz for short, I'm Gnog and this is Fee-Ree."

We are introduced to **Captain Brunhilda**. We thank her for her hospitality as a round of tea is poured. We talk about our journey in response to questions and Gnog mentions the starlight creature, which Deni originally saw. A deckhand is sent - comes back, "It's merely a Starlight Apparition, sir." Fee-Ree enquires. We're told that there are various legends about what they might be; there is a theory that they're people who lost themselves in the Astral Sea, or their physical bodies perished here, probably by accident or violence (since diseases and age don't apply here). Souls of those righteous and helpful, those with no faith and no divine realm that they believe they go to when they die, remain here. They stay to help. There are legends of them appearing at times of need, to give directions or lend a helping hand. Old sailor's tails perhaps, but they do seem harmless. Consider it an omen of good luck!

As we share stories, Fee-Ree talks about Arxcis. The first mate is moved by this and presents to her **a small box of tea**, which is a very kind gesture.

We learn that the Giff patrol as a show of force, in part, that can help keep bullies at bay. We are offered a tour! This ship is a Bombard class vessel, fourth generation. The Captain is proud - the best-made generation, we're told, as these were the last to be built entirely on their home world, rather than on colonies. The ship is large, beautiful and impressive. We provide appropriate (genuine) compliments and, in due course as ready to leave, thank them for helping to keep the Astral Sea safe. We're given a **purple flare**; "if ever you find yourself at the jaws of defeat, about to lose all and perish, use this and fire it straight up - we will find you and come to your aid". Thank you again!

(We're also told to keep our eyes to starboard as we get near Ravnica. There's an **old Dominion**, easily seen with a spyglass; the long-petrified remains of one of the dead gods - which happens when a non-Theros God no longer has any followers at all; Theros gods, if ever truly forgotten, would simply disappear).

Near the end of his watch, Gnog tries again to get the attention of the Starlight Apparition, beckoning it closer; it just copies him. Gnog does a dance. The apparition copies. Gnog fetches an apple from the preserving chest; he holds it up, points at it, points at his mouth, points at the apparition; the apparition holds up its hand which extends to an apple shape, mimicking again. Deni is getting up - she comes on deck and says she tried all that. Gnog tries thinking to it, asking it if it is OK in his head. Surprisingly, he feels a thought coming back! "Things are as they are. Are you OK?" "Yes, thank you." "Where are you going?" "We hope to visit the Ruby Palace one day, but right now, we are travelling to Ravnica." "Oh, you seek the Ruby Palace?" "Yes" "I shall find it for you!" - and the apparition flies away.

Something might come of it!



## DAY 16 (Riglan 53)

Back to period 1. Taz gets to rest. Fee-Ree flies; Deni is on watch and Gnog is on a break. He tries to read Giff Brought Guns, but there are too many surrounding concepts with which he has no familiarity (the galaxy in general!) and he gets nowhere, unfortunately (even with luck point, rolls 7 then 8 + 1 -> 9 -> failure). Deni on watch D20 -> 20, then rolling for encounter, D20 -> 20 again!

Deni calls down to Gnog, urgently. He rushes up to the weapon deck. "What's *that*?" - Gnog looks, his eyes letting him see clearly. A straight line about a mile away cuts across, parallel to the horizon, which seems to be made of up individually moving objects, like a caravan or linear flock. It's very long and very straight. Gnog borrows the spyglass, perception: 19+7 -> 26; it's a line of probably thousands of squares with limbs that march. They are carrying things. In between, above at regular but widely-spaced intervals, are things shaped like five-pointed stars which seem to be directing them. They look like they might be metal. Every few squares, one of them is bigger - regular again, but more frequent than stars. Oscillating between each star shape creature pair is a circular winged creature. As we get closer, it becomes clear that they're orbiting.

"I'll be right back!" says Gnog and "flies" down above the foredeck to shout down to Fee-Ree, asking if she can lift up a fair distance so that we might eventually fly above this strange line. As we do this, we notice a star shape flying towards us. It is making "scloob!" noises repeatedly. Gnog doesn't speak Scloob. Gnog shouts, "Do you speak or think in common?" - it turns out it's asking us to halt. The "**Modron great march**" must not be impeded. Gnog asks Fee-Ree to come to a stop, and we have to wait. It thanks us "for complying". The delivery is modern terms robotic and stilted, rigid and geometric, but these seem to be creatures. The squares march in perfect unison, we note, now we are closer. The stars and circles also all move in unison and are exact replicas of each other. It takes an hour! Gnog can only guess at their numbers; perhaps a million? They weren't single file - there were many of them and we'd been sat on the entrypoint gravity plane the whole time, which they seem aligned on, so we were seeing it end-on. 

After an hour, then - during which we inevitably have tea - we get to continue.

Deni tells us after that they are from the "perfectly ordered plane of **Mechanis**" - she studied this plane in university. This march happens at some exact periodicity, some unlikely and complicated number of several million seconds.

Period 2 - Taz flies (and we tell him about the encounter), Fee-Ree sleeps, Gnog is on watch and Deni is on a break. Gnog perception, only 11. He's still a bit freaked out by the lack of changing light, which makes it hard to judge the passing of time and quite hard to even get a sensation of movement sometimes. Occasionally strange objects / debris floating nearby help give more of an impression of progression. While looking for these, Gnog notices a flash of light off to his right and elevated; he looks closer and sees that there are actually 3 of them; two humanoid creatures and one that looks a bit like a snowy tiger. The lights trail behind them on a silver thread. Astral travellers - they think that the place we are is a magical construct, designed to help them move between planes.

Gnog sees that they notice us and their stance changes to cautious; a bow is drawn. Gnog asks Taz if he can create a blue orb effect via Minor Illusion and he does, but there's no reaction. Gnog once again tries his old standby and waves. They continue to regard us with caution, but do seem to start have some kind of discussion. They retreat. We do not pursue. We were close enough to see that one was a wizard and the other, with the snow tiger, seemed like a half-elven ranger.

Period 3 - Fee-Ree on watch, Gnog sleeps, Deni assisting on Watch. It's uneventful.

Period 4 - Fee-Ree on break, Gnog on watch and Deni sleeps. Gnog Perception 17. It's also uneventful.



## DAY 17 (Riglan 54)

Back to period 1. Taz gets to rest. Fee-Ree flies; Deni is on watch and Gnog is on a break. Deni comes down to the lower deck and calls him up. Fee-Ree shouts up that she can sense it too. We go up to the weapon deck. About two miles away is what seems to be part of really huge statue. It has a humanoid kind of face and head, no hair broken off ears and big hole in the side - perhaps this is where the piece of rock we saw a while ago was from. One hand touches the side of the face and the other is outstretched. Much of it is broken and crumbled but just hangs nearby in what we assume is roughly the original shape.

As we get close, the size of it becomes even more apparent. We're going to get within maybe a mile so Gnog asks Fee-Ree to divert a bit to get a closer look, just out of curiosity.

It seems our entry plane and reference for our ship's perspective would be at the statue's shoulder. We realise with astonishment that the top of the head must be **a full mile** above us, with it continuing in its crumbled form about 2 miles below; the rest, from about the hip down, seems to have long since drifted off. As we get close, Gnog (perception 14) realises it's not abandoned and desolate. There are what seem to be flying creatures flying around in small flocks. Like an island in an ocean, it seems to have its own ecosystem. Looking closer and 'getting our eye in' we see big schools of what look rather like manta rays, except with long feathery tails that fan our and elongated necks between the body and head. With the spyglass Gnog is able to see a large number of other creatures. *Most* are ignoring us but there appear to be a couple of grey, shark-like creatures that are "swimming" in circles but seem to be eyeing us to see what we're doing. As we approach closer they seem startled and "swim" away.

There are other shark-body-like creatures only with large wings extending where fins would be and narwhal-like extruded faces rather than the blunt noses of many shark species. Suddenly, there's a thump as a huge ballista bolt goes flying across the prow of the ship! Gnog shouts to Fee-Ree to break left to turn away and try to immediately get to full speed (insofar as one can in the astral see) and looks in the direction from which the bolt came, while trying to figure out what's going on (insight 16). He sees a space galleon hidden in a hollowed out section of the statue with many weapons aimed - yet this was a warning shot. He lets Fee-Ree pull back a little then asks her stop and asks if she can send up a blue flare / orb, but before that happens, four shapes fly towards us; they are humanoids, floating our way. They're not in uniform. One is a burly looking dwarf, two others seem to be human and one looks like a kind of, well, blob. One of the 'water that has taken human shape' things (later we learn - a Plasmoid). Then behind, a fifth member; a hadozee. A ragtag group and Gnog lets Fee-Ree know what's going on, says they don't look threatening and we're expecting hopefully friendly company.

They aren't bearing arms but do have strange weapons which Gnog thinks are the same as he saw the Giff using, "muskets", very like pictures in the Giff book he made so little headway on earlier. They hover about 50ft away - a respectful distance - and apologise for the warning shot! "Do you mean to be here?" 

Gnog explains that we're on our way to Ravnica and were indulging our curiosity with the statue (meanwhile, perception 16; they don't look antagonistic but do look guarded). Gnog looks to the dwarf and says, "perhaps this might help assuage your doubts - if it has any meaning beyond my home world of Toril, that is", and draws his great axe but lays it on the deck. This makes them jump, until he puts it down! The dwarf asks for permission to come board. Three land, the Plasmoid and hadozee staying distant. The dwarf examines the axe. "You're from Toril" "Yes, Feyrun." "My ancestors are dwarves from Toril" "The most talented metalworkers I know", replies Gnog. "Know many metalworkers on other worlds, do we?" counters one ("Be nice, **Melvin**!" replies the dwarf) Gnog laughs and says "A fair point, my views are doubtless parochial but I've met a good few dwarves from all across our little continent and many other metal workers besides and I know whose weapons I'd trust every time." The other humanoid - actually golden-skinned half-elf - apologises for **Melvin** (!) and asks why we approached? We explain that it's basically curiosity. Deni meanwhile has fetched Taz, since last time he was a bit downtrodden to have slept through the strange geometric creature March.

The half-elf, **Lana**, explains that these are the remnants of ancient long-dead gods, forgotten so thoroughly that nobody even knows who they were; their culture, their world, anything. Apparently they act a bit like coral reefs. Gnog recalls that the Giff mentioned the "old Dominion" and asks if this is that? The Hadozee lands. It's another day towards Ravnica, but we are warned that while impressive, **it's been taken over by a Xaryxian patrol**. Gnog insight 18, they're telling the truth; they're not apparently hiding anything; they seem more at ease. Perception 16, now they're up close; the Hadozee has an air of being in charge, the others being a little deferential. He only landed when the others had already done so - once it was proven safe. Gnog spots an embroidered insignia on his scarf, but Gnog can't remember and he asks Taz. Taz heads over to part of the weapon cowling and rubs off the paint - it reveals the same paint! This causes a degree of confusion, obviously...

Melvin pulls weapons. "Where did you get this ship?!"

Gnog just explains exactly - Taz joining in with a minor illusion now and again, pointing out un-repaired radiant damage and including what are apparently, key bits of things the penguins specifically said, seems to have worked (persuasion including Built For Success 22). This convinces them. The Hadozee believes we share a common enemy. If we're headed for Ravnica, there's no way we can avoid the patrol - but they can help, if we'll have a chat about how we might help in return. The plasmoid extends a pseudopod up into the air and waves it in some kind of signalling pattern; the galleon moves out of the statue and behind it, pulls some kind of huge tarp which had an illusion cast to look like part of the statue. Behind is darker, but there are lights and other ships. It's a rebel base!

They say "OK, let's make your ship look like another ship!" - so looks like we can do some proper repairs *without* having to make it to Ravnica station.

Fee-Ree takes us in. The hollow is huge. A city would fit inside the shoulder and neck cavity inside this strange, dead god. Multiple layers of structures have been built out of the sides. Many ships are docked against platforms strung together with makeshift shelters. I suppose in a place where food and air are not needed and disease cannot take hold, you can build anywhere. There are many ships, lots of designs, not military; mostly mid sized or small, with a couple of galleons. Fee-Ree shouts up to ask where we should dock. They fly and head us in, so Fee-Ree just follows. We get "parked up" next to a hanging walkway.

We're welcomed to **Independence Station**.

There isn't a mess hall, since food isn't needed. There's a lounge and gaming area - where people often drink. It's possible to get drunk in the astral sea, we learn. Gnog has no idea how that could possibly work when there's no disease and no progression of time and bodily function to flush out the alcohol - well, he can see how one might become drunk, but not how they might become sober thereafter!

(It's explained later; we can sleep; we get tired; time does pass, after a fashion; it's like everything - you think about it or you expect it, so it happens.)

A table of lizardfolk and tabaxi play a game of cards. Accusations of cheating, but it seems somehow good natured. Gnog is taken aback. He's reminded of the war camp outside Elturel - a sense of camaraderie and mixing of different peoples, but it's actually amplified, because there are creatures mixed here that would usually never mix in Feyrun and many who he might have battled. It gives him a strange, immediate and very strong emotional bond to the place. This is something he was sure he'd never feel again.

In a brief moment of quiet and privacy, Deni points out that Lana looks like she might be part Astral Elf? Lana overhears (facepalm) but is not offended. Astral Elves are not all Xaryxian - an expansionist, tyrannical group. Lana explains that there are other factions (and as we're walking and talking, being shown things, getting repair parts and so-on we see many different races and one or two full Astral Elves are amongst them). "Elves are famously known in every plane for being the 'nope, we have had enough, off we go!' types - and Astral Elves were the very first elves to leave. They left the prime material planes so long ago that they have acclimatised entirely to living in Wildspace, but the true elves live in the Astral Sea where they live forever."

The Xaryxian Empire is becoming quite a big problem. Nobody is sure why, but they're now harassing the spacelanes in general. She looks to the Hadozee, who she addresses as **Captain Marmoset**, "...should we fill them in? Shall we bring them to see the general?" Apparently it'll take a while to get the ship in order, so it's agreed. The **dwarf we met is Damen** who will stay behind to work on the ship - he's an engineer.

A journey that's as much horizontal as vertical takes us through various parts of this strange city. The dwarf is staying back with the ship, stripping it back to make it more distinctly different than just a simple painted-over job. We are led to an area with some kind of meeting room, a donut shaped wooden room with iron framing and beyond, the general. An older, wise looking Loxodon. We are invited into his office, or quarters, or whatever the adjacent room actually is - it's hard to tell. This is **General Quillon**.

We repeat our story and situation, with Taz repeating the accurate key points that seemed to have an impact before. Deni just observes and assesses. Gnog notices she seems calm and he's not alerted by anything. We know each other that well, now, it seems... Gnog finds himself grinning at his internal thoughts.

There is a window area with closed shutters, which he opens. There is a commanding view over the space within this strange statue. They're all that remain of "the resistance" - societies and worlds that the Xaryxians had annexed; most of the rest of their peoples have long since retreated to the Radiant Citadel, home to many displaced cultures and worlds. The pain of this is evident in his eyes. "They are destroyers of worlds. I don't use that phrase likely. They have technology that we think harvests the life force of thriving planets; to what end, we don't know. They rule from Xaryxis space, an impenetrable fortress - at least for now. We are trying to find ways to overcome their security and defences. The ship you have - those were very brave Dowhar who had a very long plan of infiltration in the space docks where Xaryxian would occasionally resupply and, well, bully people. They found a way to time things right and hid in the wake of a Star Moth patrol to a Xaryxian base on the edge of Xaryxis space to steal access codes - the command words for the energy field that bars entry into their home system. Some day soon we'll be able get eyes and ears in there; how and why they're doing this but most of all, how to stop another world from falling."

Melvin is asked to describe what happens. His was, they think, the most recent world to fall. They seek out places with lots of life and magic, dropping thousands of crystal seeds onto the planet that grow into strange vines that dig deep into the planet's physical and magical structure, eventually consuming it (they managed to send a beacon that tracked back to the source and this was the world, after so many others had fallen, where it became incontrovertible that Xaryxians were responsible). Things withered and died until a huge beam of radiant light jetted out to Xaryxian space for a few minutes until the remnants of the planet just shattered, killing anyone left on the planet.

Gnog looks to Fee-Ree, Deni and Taz.

"This is a lot to ask. Out here, there is strange interest amongst the places we've been, in our own world of Toril. We have some skill with weapons and magic; it might not mean much here, I don't know, but how can we have fought so hard to save Feyrun, only to sit by and do nothing when we hear tales such as these? It might not be right to get involved. But it doesn't feel right to just leave."

Deni: "I was afraid you'd say that." Fee-Ree: "We must follow our hearts and conscience. I don't know what we can do but of course I'll come along, wholeheartedly, whichever direction we go. You've agreed to follow me all the way out here on a whisper and a hope, so how could I deny your reasonable and conscience driven request?" - she turns to the General and Captain - "tell us how we can help."

Marmoset shows us a long, wide chart. He says something is being planned. Every 3.5-4.5 years, varying a bit, a world is harvested. Melvin's was 3 years ago, so we fear another is quite close - as short as half a year, but maybe as much as 18 months. We don't know which world was harvested prior, but we know of one from eleven years ago and one from 15 years ago. Quillon's own world was destroyed about 19 years ago. "We need more information. We need allies! We need people willing to join the cause, work with us; we need skilled bodies and organisations who can work quietly, without drawing attention, while gathering the resources, the skill and the information that we need to figure out all the 'blank spots' we have." - he wants to find survivors from the "missing world", to find out what it was; they've never yet found any survivors from that ~6-7 years ago event.

Scholars, wizards; people in libraries; to help fill in information. People who look to the stars, observation towers, that kind of thing; what's with the energy being beamed back, what's it for and what's it doing; has anyone got any measurements?

Gnog says "...wait, 3 years ago, 11 years ago, so 6-8 years ago is missing. So could be 7 years." Deni says, "No, that's too obvious, it can't be related. Not everything - no, it can't all be linked." As we start to kick that around, the others obviously get curious. They fetch a scientist. A gnome - Taz is delighted. We explain in as much detail as we can how it all started, from the top, 7 years ago, wild magic, shards, astral sea, ruby palace, the works. The gnome proudly tells us that he used to be an archivist at his own world's equivalent of the Library Of The Spheres - until ejected for political reasons!

This group has little extra information here, but they have many people out there gathering more information. Just finding a survivor from the missing planet would help.

He has a look at the shards. He's never seen them before.

Ravnica Station is on the dark side of the larger of Ravnica's two moons, keeping it out of sight of the planet. It's one of this group's secret forward stations, with agents who try to carefully assess and watch people who turn up saying they're interested in joining. They only get brought here if they can prove themselves. If we found anyone on Ravnica we can send them up to the Station for assessment, or even from nearby systems as Ravnica Station is a bit of hub. They tell people that this is where the actual base is, as that hides the true size of the operation and keeps eyes away from the true heart of things - the dead god in which we currently reside.

(We also learn that sending stones work on the Astral Sea as it's all one plane, but their range is limited - 'only about 100 million miles' (!) - enough for a reasonable sized system, but in terms of the scope of the astral sea, not far at all. They use the same magical pathways as teleportation spells, too, so that ought to work with similar constraints).

We're told that if we go to Ravnica Station, there is a **contact we can seek**. It's a Githzerai called **Ridani Ravoguul**. We're told about a particular tattoo (or other strange mark, they're unsure) he has under and behind his right ear, which has part missing - Deni and Taz are probably taking particular note. Githzerai can't go down to the planet as they are unaware of the species. We're mostly OK - Taz would just be seen as a construct - however Fee-Ree might have issues. Dragons are very, very rare on Ravnica and Dragonborn therefore even less so. However, she could pass herself off as other races on that world with a similar. We're given information about what to do.

We're next shown a shipyard where ships are being torn down and rebuilt with retrofits; it seems they're trying to build a military of sorts. Otherwise, their tactics can only ever consist of "run and try not to die" in any armed conflict at all.

The next few hours are spent being slowly shown around and introduced to all sorts of different people from different worlds. There is a lot of frustration - the Xaryxian should not be able to get away with this, but they've become too big and powerful to challenge. Eventually, we're interrupted by the engineer dwarf **Damen** - quicker than we thought - and we hurry back to see the ship on his invitation. "We took some liberties with the name that you gave us..."

It has been painted in a way that makes it look like much more of the structure is metal. There is silver with steel grey accents and blueish highlights. The name:

  Silver Navigator
  
...is painted on the side. "Because you are navigating the silver void," explains **Damen**. We thank them and say that we surely should pay for this, since money does have meaning in this universe and would surely help the cause? We're told to speak to Ridani at Ravnica and offer to assist there. Money isn't as important at the base because there's not really any trading anyway - they harvest what materials they can from the Astral Sea.

It's been about 6 hours; we'd head into our second watch period, but Taz never got to sleep so agree to reset our clock back to the first period and say this is just a long day.

As we're preparing to depart, **Marmoset asks us to deliver some correspondence to Ridani**. He pulls out a jar, with silver threads floating in liquid - it reminds us of Serphina and Fee-Ree's relived vision; are those memories? Apparently, similar; they are thought strands. If we're compromised, we should destroy them - drink the contents! OK then.

We board the ship and detach with the customary waves and thank-yous. Fee-Ree agree is navigating and starts to bring us down. A small craft follows to help guide us through the appropriate path inside. The illusion/tarp is lowered and we leave the large 'statue'. The ship follows us to the main space lanes for a while, before eventually veering off - a way of avoiding suspicion if we had been observed.

Period 1 is restarted. Fee-Ree flies her shift, Gnog reads once more - he gets some modest progress on the Giff book now. Taz rests and Deni has uneventful watch.

Period 2 - Taz back to piloting; Fee-Ree finally sleeps - Deni rests while Gnog is on watch. Perception nat 20 + 7. Gnog's mood has improved; we're past half-way. There is so much more to discover, but we feel like we know more about where we're going and might have a friend there in Ridani. During the shift we pass through a debris field that looks like the remnants of a battle - and that's all we can tell.

Period 3 - Gnog sleeps, Fee-Ree on watch with Deni helping.

Period 4 - Deni sleeps, Fee-Ree rests; about an hour into his watch, perception 19, Gnog sees a large structure to starboard. It's visible from a long way out. An hour later, it's close enough to see more clearly - a massive, floating city! There are spires and towers and buildings facing in two directions, presumably bisected by a gravity plane. Strange curving, arching paths connect towers up high. There are grand domes and amphitheater and what looks like might have been gardens once - but, sadly, all is ruined. It is in disrepair. The "bottom" section looks more intact; the top is in poor shape. Taz suggests this is the "old Dominion", so we've made good progress! Best not approach though.

Gnog perception 17 - he sees scattered, big chunks of debris around the city, spreading out for a distance of around a mile from its core in an ovoid disk. There are even the remains of ships, some almost fully intact, others only in fragments. Around one of the wrecks closest to us, movement... Spyglass - can't get a good angle but there are things moving inside the ship. There are brief flashes of blueish black and what looks like dark brown, but it's all in shadow. Organic though - someone raiding the ship, or a surviving crew? A few, larger creatures, moving independently of each other in any case. We're likely to pass within 1000ft on our current course, so Gnog keeps observing through the spyglass, occasionally looking around for general watch, waiting for the closest approach point, but the view of the inside of the ship is lost as we travel. Some small fish are swimming in a shoal under the boat. Gnog asks Taz to reverse direction a while, get a view inside again, then strafe around on an arc so we approach while maintaining sight line on the open side part of the ship.

It seems the brown shapes are just fish. They're shark-like again, but aren't the winged, spike-face ones. There's just one big eye though and a big mouth. Arcana (or Nature) 17+1 -> 18, good roll... Wait, what? This was in his book. He flicks through the Giff book, finding a picture he'd seen on his first unsuccessful attempt to read it, when he'd taken to flipping pages. They're called Scavvers and apparently quite common. Various colours. They can be quite vicious, it's hard to tell, but the Giff book says that they'd fire scatter pellets to keep them away from ships. We don't have those, so we start to withdraw, but we see the Scavvers following us at a distance. Four brown, two dark blue; almost purple. Gnog alerts Fee-Ree to a possible fight and asks Taz to slow down. The creatures start to fan out, probably to encircle us. They still keep distance though. Gnog indicates a rough direction towards one of the blue ones and asks Taz to basically charge at it with the ship. He brings us about and darts towards them. They scatter into two groups which flank the ship and start to come in towards us.

They're at 500ft. Initiative for the group, rolled as Gnog: 17. Gnog asks Fee-Ree to wake Deni. The one blue and two brown creatures closer to us, that were aiming at, turn and swim straight towards us. They're now at 420ft. We keep flying at them - 320ft. Gnog tries a pot shot with the longbow at a smaller brown one, but misses wildly on the first shot; the second hits for 10; Gnog rages as it may be useful (!) and asks Taz to slow to half speed (Taz initiative 14).

Deni, now awake, takes aim at the same one and hits, doing a maximum 17 damage. It leaves a trail of brownish blood but keeps moving in. This just seems to drive the others to a frenzy! Fee-Ree prepares to release a firebolt at whichever one gets close enough first. On the other side, the other group of three has swung about and is now coming at us at an angle, but they're further away; 450ft.

Proper initiative order now, game mechanics meaning we're still at 320ft. Deni aims and fires, crits, but it's a terrible damage roll - only 12, less than the previous hit. The nearest creature reaches 240ft, triggering Fee-Ree's reaction to release the firebolt; it hits for a further 17 damage. We've all been hitting the same one and this last hit takes it down.

The big blue closer scavver continues heading straight in. It reaches 240ft too. The other brown one on that side is still at 320ft; Gnog tries for that again, hitting twice for a total of 16 damage. He stows his longbow. He can see the blue scavver on the other side is trying for a pincer movement, bringing it to 370ft. The brown one Gnog just hit closes to 240ft.

Taz brings us to 140ft of the lead sharks via full movement, then halts and calls up to Gnog saying, "This should give you some better range! I'm coming up!" and he detaches from the helm.

Fee-Ree tries to hit the blue one with a lightning chromatic orb - but it misses! Nat 1. Astral sea fighting is disorientating, for both direction, relative movement and understanding where you're headed on the featureless nearby sea. Frustrated, she uses two sorcery points and uses Chill Touch, which hits for 14 necrotic damage.

The other two brown Scavvers on the flanking group are now also drawing to 370ft away.

Top of round. Deni aims at the nearby blue Scavver, attacking with her longbow with advantage. She hits, doing a big 45 damage. The Scavver isn't deterred and keeps straight ahead - gets to 60ft. Gnog tries out his Astral Sea "flying" and wills himself into the face of the blue lead creature, getting a little closer than he might've liked - right in front. Drawing his claymore he attacks; he hits twice. 15 damage + 4 poison (8 rolled but con save succeed), the second attack doing 18 slashing and again 4 poison (again con save succeed).

(The blue scavver behind is at 350ft, due to angles, but closing fast now that we've stopped.)

The closer brown scavver gets to within 25ft of Gnog and 60-65 of the boat. It attacks Gnog! A huge mouth tries to bite him; it hits, 7 piercing halved, 3 - but there's a grapple issue... He has to dex save, DC13. Rage helps - advantage roll is 24; it does not engulf him (other dice roll was a nat 1!).

Taz gets onto the foredeck. He says, "Oh look! Scavvers! They're very common you know, and these have got very close..." - he's a little alarmed, these are huge creatures to him and clearly on attack, so he casts L2 Armour. He flies up to the weapon deck between Fee-Ree and Deni. "Hello!"

Fee-Ree sees the creature almost eating Gnog. Wow. BIG mouths. Fee-Ree tries another orb, which this time hits, doing 18 lightning damage; she uses two charges of the Lennithon staff to do additional damage - 14 - that's enough to kill the brown one. Fee-Ree 2, rest of us nil.

(The two brown ones behind get within 350ft as well, catching up with their blue counterpart.)

Deni aims at the more distant blue scavver, hoping to whittle them down before they're upon us in a single group. She hits for 13 damage.

The big blue scavver on Gnog attacks him. 19 vs AC 21 -> he dodges and just avoids the bite. Gnog attacks back! He hits, dealing 10 damage + 7 poison and it's poisoned - but it also dies. That was all it took. He turns around and flies back at full speed, so he gets past the ship and about 10ft beyond towards the approaching other three, facing down the second blue scavver, which gets within 260ft of Gnog.

Taz sees an opportunity. He flies out 70ft, past Gnog, calling back "preparing some magic!" to Fee-Ree, Deni and Gnog, then estimates distance to the 80ft-speed blue scavver - 200ft - so he prepares Eldritch Blast for when it gets within range.

Fee-Ree is at too great a range as well and flies out, at 65 speed; gets to 240ft from the closest Scavver and throws a firebolt at it. It *just* hits for 11 damage. She then advances to maximum range (65ft speed) just behind Taz, telling him to get behind her when he's finished!

The two brown close in to 270ft of the boat (260ft of Gnog, etc.)

Deni voices discontent at our rash flying actions! She aims and fires at the blue Scavver, hitting for 15. Gnog calls back, "Sorry Deni, been hoping to try out weird flying fighting out here!" and uses his full turn to travel 140ft, bringing him to 120ft of the lead blue Scavver. He's exactly 150ft from the boat, so Deni would be *just* out of range but he intends to engage in melee. The scavver approaches - 70ft from Gnog, 120ft from Taz - triggering Taz's reaction. Two eldritch blasts. He hits twice - for 14 and 8 - albeit with Built For Success to get the first one on target.

Now it's Taz's turn proper, so he sustains his attack. He does hit twice, but for very low damage rolls; 7 and 6 (nat 2 and nat 1). He ducks behind Fee-Ree. "That went well! This is exciting!"

Fee-Ree is 125ft away from the lead scavver. She moves forward her full 65ft, bringing her to 60ft of the Scavver (130ft from the boat, or 140ft from the two brown scavvers). She throws a fireball at the two brown Scavvers. Both take 24 damage. They continue forward, 80ft, towards Fee-Ree; so all three are within 60ft of her now.

Deni's 190ft away from the creatures, so she decides to just give it a go - she flies out, 70ft forward, so she's ~120ft away from the group. She tries to gain insight on the blue Scavver. It succeeds, so she gets sneak damage; and it's a crit hit! 21 damage + 32 + 37 - **90** damage! The blue scavver is obliterated - it's cleaved in half. "No fair, that was my one!" says Gnog. "There are two more, Gnog! Don't let them get past you!"

So Gnog flies up in front of both brown scavvers and attacks each once. A hit and a crit! 21 damage on the crit, only 11 on the other. It's Taz's turn. He can see one is very badly injured and the other not so bad, so flies forward a little and uses another two Eldritch Blasts. He fires at the more injured one first, the less injured one next. He hits both - 14 for the first, which kills it, 12 for the second. "I got one!"

Fee-Ree hits the remaining Scavver with a firebolt, dealing 9 damage and killing it - another one for Fee-Ree! That's it. They're all down; we fly back towards the ship. "What do they taste like?" says Gnog, towing one half of the blue one that Deni cleaved. He ties it to the side of the ship - bloody-side-out. That'll be a good one for the Xaryxian patrol to see. Deni asks for a brown one too, so Gnog fetches one. She guts it - inside, she finds bits of armour. It had eaten someone... We gut them all to see if there's anything interesting inside any of them. One of them has eaten a vial; it's a healing potion, just regular, but a surprising find nonetheless. There's also a small gold ring we estimate to be worth about 50gp... Taz likes it as a memento, because it was in the one he'd killed, so he wears it.
