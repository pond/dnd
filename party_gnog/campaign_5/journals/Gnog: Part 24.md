# Gnog: Part 24
## 7am, day 59 (Ravnica 39, Riglan 96 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Monday (7 day week); by 2pm on Day 60, Bolas will have run out of (willing) Orzhov souls

We wake up underground in Arxcis' area, after a stressful and risky but remarkably successful heist, in which we stole the Immortal Sun from New Prahv and substituted in a copy. We fought nobody, never failing a deception or persuasion check, thanks to a bevy of other supporting spells or a few times, just good luck.

* We could of course not hide the fact the Immortal Sun box was gone, nor could we get the vault keys back into Dovin's room; their disappearance will surely be noticed fairly quickly
* We took "things that looked valuable" from the inner vault instead, including *three* boxes of which only one turned out to be the one we needed, to try and make it look like a crazy theft
* We still have the vault keys and the Azorious-owned goods and will return them once Bolas is gone and Dovin dealt with
* The Immortal Sun remains active, in its (shrunken) box, so that Bolas is not immediately aware of the problem
* We hope that our time up on the Immortal Sun's suspended platform - casting shadows on the inner wall of the Ledev column - was not noticed, nor the very brief moment of slight dimming as Gnog almost fumbled the switchover
* **Bolas' Elder Spell will complete in a little over four days, but he'll run out of the spirits being supplied by the Orzhov in less than two.**

Taz moved to L17. He's much more powerful thanks to a proficiency bonus bump, being able to cast up to L3 via the MA with complete reliability now. With this, he drops See Invisibility to make room for two new spells he learns for the L8 slot he just acquired; Mind Blank and Power Word Stun.

Taz wakes first, and wakes the rest of us. He's quite excited because he's detected via arcana that his Heroes Feast is still active! The anti-magic field didn't kill it off - just suppressed it. We'll continue to benefit until 6-7pm ish tonight.

Gnog says it's been bonkers stressful for us all. No letup. No travel time on trails where we could clean our heads - even the flight back to Ravnica was fraught with anxiety. He figures maybe we take some time for tea and breakfast, for a change, just to collect ourselves - to reconnect. Deni says, "What about coffee and ringbread? We have to go that way!" - and Fee-Ree is keen, Arxcis wanting to come along too before work. So the five of us make our way across to P5. As we go, Taz asks the group if we've any ideas about finding Calvin, the brother of the goblin Malvin. Works at a foundry. The suggestion is to ask goblin folk - at the risk of sounding racist! - at P5 when we're there? So while paying for coffee & ringbread, we do that.

It's easier than expected. The ringbread goblin knows - it's an unusual pair of similar names, so that helps. We're directed to an encampment and head there with our coffee and ringbread, after saying goodbye to Arxcis who heads off to work. The encampment is near a generator pen and quite warm. Taz (persuasion 21) gets a tip-off quickly and before we know it, we've tracked down Calvin.

Taz is delighted to deliver the good news!

It transpires that Malvin is not just anyone - he's actually a spy; a plant, for about 3 years, for Krenko. Helps Krenko to an eye on the Azorious in case the lawmakers plan to move against him.

We're recognised, during the convo, as people who helped get them cooling units. They say that if we want anything, just ask. We do at least think to ask for any red crystals; who knows what might have been overlooked. They say they'll do some scouting in Midori Park. We thank them and tell them where to drop them off if found (Gibo & Bebe).

Then we continue on, heading towards the safe house. We get to the safehouse and wait around a little, until Jace emerges from his spellcasting. After about half an hour or so of idle chat and general theorising about random plans, Jace emerges from a room upstairs. He looks very tired. He sees us and calls down; "Ah. Right. OK. I'm off to bed. What are you - all right. I'll catch you..." and he heads off towards a bedroom. Gnog calls up, "I know you're really tired, but have you got just a few minutes, we'll be quick as we can?" "What is it about?" "Niv."

Jace comes downstairs. "I've detected his presence. I know that he's alright. I have access to that dimension and I'm able to communicate, let's just say. Rest assured he is fine." "And you mentioned that the Guild Pact Powers plan is still a thing, despite the layline damage?" "Yes, that can still be done. I will require Nissa. She knows how to repair and manipulate the laylines. I will need to focus on Niv to get him out, but I'm not quite sure what the plan is? Theoretically, yes I can do all of that. I can convey a message to him to let him know. One message a day." Gnog says "OK, we don't have that plan yet but you'll be amongst the first to know. Thanks, there were other things but nothing important, you can head to bed - just thought you might wanna see this to cheer you up..." and opens the BOH to partly withdraw the box. "Ah! Right! Well you've been busy. That's good. How many people know about this?" "At the moment, just you." "Let's not broadcast this. We don't know who to trust."

There's a brief discussion about that being against Nissa's wishes, but we do agree that the more people who know stuff, the more at risk the plan becomes.

We do ask about the Ward Of Unbreaking, but that would require research. Niv's library is gone. He'll look into it independently. Soon we're done and he heads to bed.

We find a random room - Jace tells us there are 80 to choose from! - to read the scroll to see how to turn on or off the Immortal Sun. All red; walls, furniture; same shade of red. Strange desk lamps that are turned on and off as if connected to the Blistercoils energy, but this is an entirely magical domain. Just for show, we guess!

* Taz: Comprehend Languages L1 via MA to read the Ancient Ravnican.
* The language is classic Sphinx - all riddles. A scroll of puzzles!
* Activation: Ritualistic and spell-like aspects with some quite esoteric components required; even knowing what to do, in theory, we'd actually find this thing hard to turn on, as we'd be unsure what the components are.
* Deactivation: Oh. Wow. Very simple. Two rods on either side need to be withdrawn a short distance, turned and then removed fully. **This is quick to perform, but the effect of the Sun fades over time**. It "shrinks" back to the Sun, having spread out originally.
* Taz investigation only 5+15, he has a rough idea of rate, kind of. Half as long to fade as it does to grow; that's all we have. We're guessing after that.

We ask around in the mansion to see if anyone is good with numbers! We find an interesting mathematician planeswalker. He is able to ask us for more information and after some time has calculated a **likely range of 1 hour to 1.5 hours for the field to fade to within 100ft or so of the Sun**. It's not precise but it's based on various magical principles we don't understand, coupled with observations after its initial investigation and Planeswalkers being unable to leave the Wall.

Next, we catch up with Vi and after some smalltalk - in which she has little interest, more interested in what she can do to help us (a Fixer, after all) - and we ask about Gideon. It takes a while to remember, but it turns out he's gone below, apparently seeking Vraska and a route to D11 - presumably to reach Liliana.

It takes a while, but it's not too hard to find a route down; takes about an hour. We're in Deadbridge Chasm on the main floor.

### 9:30am

Vraska isn't in her normal locations, such as the 'grotto' of all the water pools - unsurprisingly - but we get directions and make our way there. It's a sort of conclave of underground denizens, in a repurposed space. Shades of The Bolthole.

* Vraska is busy - a delegation from other districts; trying to find out what's going on in D11/D12
* She sent Gideon with translators that way to find a way through
* It's messy that way - not free of Eternals, take care
* If we know a rough plan in future, do keep her in mind; she wants to know how *she* can help, as a Planeswalker

It takes a good half an hour going through the Deadbridge Chasm base alone, from one side of the precinct to another, diagonally, through the mushroom forest. Gnog survival 19+9->28.

* On the journey, much RP
* What is the plan? Gnog doesn't know
* Deni points out - we have no way to formulate it. We don't know enough. Others must make the plan. It's gods, and things more powerful than gods! The Planeswalkers must do this. We just play our part
* Bolas hopefully overlooks us in calculations much of the time - we're not as powerful as many others that he knows
* Perhaps our role is to heal. To help Gideon; to help mend wounds in the Gatewatch.

We have various scares on the way - disinterested shambling mounds, giant snakes or whatever; things that spook us but nothing that's actually an aggressor. No glowing of Fee-Ree's staff.

We get to the caves where the D11 Kraul clans are. They see us, start clicking - dammit, Vraska didn't gives us an interpreter! - another L1 Comprehend from Taz. "Stop! You're leaving District 10! You're going the wrong way. It is dangerous past here. You must turn back. They don't understand us! Jerry, they don't understand us..."

Taz has his telepathy ability, and "thinks" to Jerry - "My group cannot understand but by magical means, I can understand your words and 'think' to you with responses." They are surprised. "You're a shaman!" "Of sorts." "I apologise shaman. I did not know." He starts to make ritualistic respectful movements. Taz says, "Thank you, but the apology is mine; we entered your domain unannounced. We are aware of the danger and thank you of your warnings. We seek one like us, who passed this way soon." They recognise who we mean. Having trouble with communication, despite the interpreter. Different clan dialects, Taz recognises. We're taken to their leader `:-)` with Taz being treated as *our* leader, as a Shaman.

They lead us to a large cavern. Low glowing embers in dug-out holes; makeshift braziers. It feels like a place of contemplation and negotiation. Kraul soldiers stand all around in various exit tunnels and nooks. It looks like this was perhaps once a very large, domed reservoir maybe; walls have some kind of tiles that would hold wall back. The numerous tunnels were perhaps pipes once?

Gideon is in the middle of the space, gathered with some elders, interpreter at his side. A Devkarin elf, surprisingly - Taz expected another Kraul. We head over and greet them. It turns out the Devkarin's first language is Undercommon, so translating Kraul to Undercommon to Common for Gideon is tricky. Persuasion 27; he's able to insert himself into the discussion since he is using Comprehend Languages (lasts an hour) plus telepathy to "speak" clearly. He's again as a shaman and elevated above the others by the Kraul in their eyes.

The Kraul explain that communication kept breaking down because they're trying to understand the spiritual wellbeing of Gideon's people; they understand *where* he wants to go, but not *why*. They'd need to lead him through old burial grounds. That's not something they do lightly. It desecrates the sanctity of Kraul burial grounds if someone is led through who is not "spiritually well". This is causing frustration; it's very important to them. It's not just burial; for them it's a form of ascension, a spirituality where the area must be kept 'clean' for spirits to ascend properly to the afterlife. This is a richer, more important culture than Taz had expected.

Imagine if surface dwellers had come down here exploring - just our old city, some ruins! - and wandered into such a place without understanding. Irreparable damage.

Taz explains that he thinks the four of the party are OK, but Gideon is of pure heart, yet torn. He carries guilt. They already detected that; they are quite empathic; this is why negotiations stalled. They offer us a room and space to tend to Gideon's well being. Shed the shroud of guilt. If we can do that, they'll lead us themselves, with guides, through the burial grounds and the dangerous tunnels to the place Gideon wants to visit.

Taz thanks them and asks them to lead us to the room; he explains to the others what's going on (at least in terms of the room). He then explains; Gideon's turmoil is the issue. Gideon concurs - he talks at length about his anxieties.

TL;DR, Taz persuasion 27 (with BFS) contested against a Wisdom roll of 21, so he calms down. He really wants to see her. He's sure Liliana is here; they have a connection - a holy symbol around his neck is in fact not what we thought. Gideon tends to grasp it, like Garren did with his; but when we look up close, it's actually quite alarming! A gold circle and tied with *claws* made of gold, a crystal vial/ampule that seems to be filled with blood. A soft glow to it. A jarring visual on Gideon, the paladin!

"This is our talisman - *her* talisman. We have one each. She created it with a piece of her power. It's... When we are on the same plane, we can sense each other."

He would like our company if we go to her. But he needs to speak to her alone.

Taz: Insight, dirty 20. He's less conflicted; calmer. This might be as good as it gets. He clearly doesn't want to go back to the Gatewatch right now. 

Taz says to the group, "I think we can proceed; hopefully, the Elders will sense the change I sense" - and indeed as we head back into the big chamber, the Elders remark on it immediately. They agree; we may pass. They will provide us with an escort. Old catacombs, below D11. Taz thanks the Devkarin Elf for holding things together as long as he did! Taz says it's OK now we have an escort, he can return to safety.

He asks us to tell Vraska he did well! Well, in many ways - he did. 

The rest of us are led to a very beautiful place. Rises up with stairs, what look like old garden walls in concentric walls, gazebos, raised areas; at the top, the remains of an old observatory. Burial areas are built into the hill that this forms. We follow old paths, meandering a little, probably old garden walkways, past the observatory and down; then we go past a toppled tower, now serving as a strange connection across a chasm to another area; a bridge. We reach an old cliff face, where, on a sheared face, old (human) catacombs are visible. They seem to have been looted! Many sarcophagi have been moved and opened.

Our guides indicate a route. We head in; at the middle of what we think is a wheel-like set of catacombs is a circular stairwell up. They say they will wait, but we say we'll probably head back a different way, using magical means; we can only do that to familiar locations, which is why we couldn't come here using that same approach. So we thank them and say they, too, can get to safety. They bid Taz a formal farewell and wish him luck on his quest.

### 11am

At the top, there's what seems to be a quite grand mausoleum/temple. We need to be quiet; Taz uses his Dulcimer to make himself invisible; Fee-Ree makes herself and Gideon invisible too.

* Gnog 21
* Taz 13
* Fee-Ree 18
* Deni (auto success)
* Gideon 9

We scrape by as a group; not hiding from anyone in particular. We are able to look out to the district around... Patrols of Eternals. Not swarming, but still, very busy. We'll need to be *very* careful moving between buildings. "She's close" says Gideon, closing his eyes; "I think... She's... There?" and points to a building outside, beautiful, white marble, decorative. Could be a church, but a sign says, "Fine art and rare jewels". Gideon start saying, "I understand if this is as far as you want to go..." but then Gideon stops himself, and says, "Oh. Shit!" - Fee-Ree looks confused as her staff isn't glowing; but all Eternal patrols around our building simply turn in unison and walk away, parting so that the road between us and the museum is empty.

Deni is *very* nervous. "We're surely not just going to walk across the road between hundreds of Eternals barely 20ft away?!" - yep! Gotta trust. Worked well with the Yuan Ti... (!)

As we approach the gallery, the doors just open. Upright-standing Dreadhorde are holding the doors open. In we go, borderline suicide really. "Where from here Gideon? We'll stop anywhere you want us to." We look around. It's crazy beautiful. Inevitable beautiful sculptures, vases and so-on. Amazing paintings; even one that's *very* old, ships thrown about by waves on a stormy ocean! That's either done by imagination or it really is an extremely ancient piece of art. A super-delicate vines, leaves and gossamer wings designed staircase curves up. As we walk up, invisibility fades - we'd spent a while debating. A dreadhorde Vizier steps forward. It points at the four of us and motions that we must stop. Gideon must go on alone, but Taz gives him some bardic inspiration.

We just stand and wait, in silence. Half a dozen inert Dreadhorde around us, motionless.

Deni tries moving a bit. No response. So she shrugs and starts looking at display cases. At one, she motions for Gnog to look. A crown, crusted in sapphires. It's pretty ridiculous, as with most crowns! There's a piece of writing giving information on it. It, too, is quite old. We look at other things, to pass the time.

Gnog, perception 20. The Dreadhorde appear to flinch! Then we hear a loud strange laugh, from upstairs. It's hard to tell if it is a derisory laugh or mirthful; it's not joy; well, anyway, it's something. And a strange reaction from the Dreadhorde though. If we listen very quietly we can hear words, but can't hear what they're saying clearly. At least it's a two-way conversation, not one-sided. It's louder than it was initially anyway. Eventually it gets quieter. Another laugh; no Dreadhorde reaction though.

Footsteps, across the floor above. Louder voices get close to earshot, two of them. We go back to the base of the stairs. Looking up, we see Liliana and Gideon at the top. Gideon is slightly behind her. She has a panther next to her! She's dressed in black and purple, same as we saw before. Closer, though, we can see it is some kind of velvet gown; lace-up leather boots, long black lace gloves, a *lot* of jewellery, the chain veil around her face, but not across it; immaculate hair. Beautiful, almost flawless; light olive skin tone.

Immaculate all-round, as Gideon said.

Hard to tell her mood. Doesn't seem happy; but not angry either; not cold/evil. Certainly not crazed, as she looked when we first saw her in battle - as if drunk on power. Gnog (perception 27) sees that she's concentrating on something; he's seen that enough from other spellcasters, including Fee-Ree. A bit of strain. She seems very practiced at holding it. Could be the Dreadhorde control - could be controlling Gideon! We don't know. Gideon himself doesn't look jubilant; but not defeated or angry. Less than satisfied though.

Liliana does not come down the stairs, facing him and talking. The panther flops down. He says, "Well I don't know what I was expecting..." "Well I thought you were just here to see me really - you know I can't - you just don't understand. There's a lot more afoot. I stand to lose a *lot*. I stand to lose everything." "Yes but *we* stand to lose everything - I mean *everything* everything." "My mind will not be changed. But at least you understand, now; you *do* understand, don't you?" "I don't know - maybe..." "Alright. I'll take that..." - and she touches his shoulder gently, briefly; "...it's good to see you again. If only things had worked out differently." "They still can!" "No, Gideon; stop." He walks down the stairs.

Liliana turns momentarily to us. She flashes us a beautiful, but practiced smile; not emotionless or sinister though. Neutral, possibly even friendly. She calls down, "Gideon. Come back and see me some time. You'll always be safe around me." - he stops on the stairs, turns, "You know I still love you. And I always will." "And you know I love you - but sometimes the world gets in the way. It doesn't make me love you any less. You just need to *let* me love you. You'd better be heading on now. It will become pretty obvious soon if I keep this street empty much longer!" and she chuckles; her demeanour breaking just for a moment.

We all head back across the road, into the mausoleum. The doors shut; we head down the stairs just to get some cover from being visible or heard on the street.

"What happened?" asks Gnog, as gently as he can. Gideon answers, "Let's go somewhere we can talk. Would that be alright?" "I'd like that. Perhaps - teleport?" "I thought you'd never ask!" responds Fee-Ree, grabs everyone's hands and - pop - we're back in P4. In the apartment!

Gnog is astonished. "It still stands!" he says, in wonder. "Yes, it's *in* the bulwark" responds Fee-Ree. Gnog sees if he can get the stove going for tea, in that case! No Tesseret chasing us any more. We can hear activity outside - soldiers mostly. Eventually, tea is made. We sit. Gnog just looks at Gideon, waiting for him to want to speak. Eventually he does.

"It could've gone worse. We got out unscathed, she didn't raise the alarm..." - he's trying to list the positives - "...I - I didn't get the answers I wanted. Yeah. She wouldn't explain *why* - I tried - I think it'd be easier for me if it was obvious there was nothing left there, but that's not true. So *why*?! I don't understand. What *does* he have over her? He has something over her. He must. There's nothing in it for her to do this. If it's power she wants, the chain veil is enormously powerful; if she wanted to control an undead army she could've done so anywhere - and then it'd be *her* control, not just the general for someone else. There's no future under Bolas! She's not an idiot; she knows that; so it must be something else, but she wouldn't say. She just kept repeating herself - 'you know why I have to do this' - no, I don't! I told her to explain it to me. She laughed! I don't know. I mean, I'm worried that I've fucked up and I've failed... I mean I tried asking her outright, 'if we asked you to, would you pull the Dreadhorde back? What is the Dreadhorde here for?' - and she at least explained that; some of the Dreadhorde were equipped with harvesting crystals."

"That, we saw" says Gnog.

"And they're an expendable force. Entirely. That's how Bolas sees them. And they're obedient. They'll do *exactly* as she tells them." "But she wouldn't withdraw them?" "She said she couldn't. What would be the point, it's not going to stop the death. It's not going to stop the war. She asked me how I could believe there was any hope of defeating Bolas at all?"

So Gnog asks, "Well is it as simple as fear, then?"

"She asked me the same question she asked me the last time - 'the offer still stands; join me, join me and we can be together again. You say you love me; show it. Join me. Be by my side. The world has gone to shit! At least we'll be together.' She repeated things she'd said on Amonkhet; like, 'I am doing this for us'. I countered with things like, 'Then stop this, we can go far away!' but she asked if there was anywhere in the multiverse he would not find us and reach. 'I am doing this *for us* so we can survive. Why can't you see that?' but I can't. I can't believe she's doing something this *evil*. I just said to her 'this is not you!' but she said 'of course it is me; you've always known - you just choose to look the other way' and I guess she's right. What do I expect of someone who is a necromancer, who deals with controlling the dead, using the kind of magic she uses? But how do I reconcile that with the amazing, beautiful, incredibly bright and talented person that I know? She's capable of so much love and beauty. I see it all the time. How could that same person... I just can't accept that the *same* person could, of her *own* will, do this. I just can't!" - and he finishes his tea... "This is very good by the way."

Gnog sighs, "I'm sorry you didn't get the answers you wanted."

"At least I tried. And I'm not giving up."

We acknowledge that there's still something to save there. She's not lost her mind, or her heart, not entirely. A change of heart is possible, because there's a heart to change. He still wants to try more. He wants to defeat Bolas; his personal reason now.

To do that, we need to pull out some knives that Bolas put into Gatewatch. Time to call everyone.

### 12pm

Gnog uses the sending stone. "Hello all! Requesting group meet at safehouse as soon as possible please. Closest additional allies attending also if available. Planning, information sharing and more."

* Ajani, right away: "On my way. Will take a little while as I cannot fly there, but will make good speed. See you in an hour."

We start to make our way across to P5.

* We don't near from Kaya or Nissa but we know they're busy and will be there if we can.

We swing by Gibo and Bebe on the way, to let them know that some goblins are going to be doing tests in Midori Park just in case there are any other red crystals left. They didn't expect that. They can adapt the equipment should any be found. They figure they might also send people to the wreckage of the Platform, which is now in a moderately safe area. We know the power unit was hit by Bolas but the explosion was nothing like the size of that we saw in Amonkhet, so perhaps *some* crystals remain.

(Some touching RP. Gibo and Bebe are worried. It's dangerous and there's no time. But they won't let us down, etc.; it's very touching. Gnog fears for them. They are amazing.)

**(POST SCRIPT: After the events of Part 25, well, the conversation in hindsight makes more sense. They knew all along. They just didn't tell Gnog. He'll probably never know why - perhaps they figured he'd have refused to let them do it - and they'd have been right about that - but were certain there was just no other way, so kept it all to themselves.)**

About 45 minutes after leaving the P4 apartment we get to the safehouse. Nissa and Kaya are already there. In the end, a group of about 30 have drawn together. Ajani arrives, Vi, Jace, the whole gang plus many.

### Day 59, 1pm

- Some powerless planeswalkers can still help. The artificer we saw lose his powers from when we were on the wall, can still help; he'll check the platform wreckage. 
- Some planeswalkers are needed on other worlds if we succeed so intend to leave if the immortal sun is disabled; that's very reasonable!
- Mu Yanling can find a way to get down the Ward on the Eye, but she needs to be within 60ft and only has a single shot
- Jace wants us to find a way to get the Dreadhorde "off our backs" and get the gods far enough away that Jace can access the ruins of the Chamber Of The Guildpact. Bring Niv back, transfer power, then Niv can "distract" Bolas.
- Focus on the cat god first, since she has a bow that fires the same arrows we have; that's what took a chunk out of Sunhome
- Lazotop armour for the gods does need to be taken down first
- We need to engage the gods in D11 to keep them away
- Our own experience notes that immunity to damage may not matter with gods, so we put things in place to resist better, or bolster our healing or whatever
- **Will** and **Rowan Kenrith**, twins, Planeswalkers, volunteer for one of the gods; chain with fire and ice - it is decided that they'll deal with Ronas, the Cobra - Vi and a couple of artificers will go along as they can bring constructs unaffected by poison
- Vitu Ghazi is almost awoken; it's decided that it will deal with Bontu, the injured Crocodile; Nissa will be with her ("her" -> Vitu Ghazi), along with people who can tackle the necrotic kinds of damage it's likely to deal; Kaya will attend - fight fire with fire - or in the case of undeath and shadow, to fight it with spirits and shadow
- Ajani will speak with Aurelia, to meet Kefnet (stork - wings) in the air, hoping radiant damage will have more effect on these undead
- We'll tackle the cat with the god-killing arrows and if there are any left over, we'll move onto whoever is next!
- We note that opposites are good - fire and ice; *one* should work! Likewise, radiance and death. Nissa accordingly also pulls in clerics and a monk of the Sunsoul.
- Kaya decides that she's going to try and *occupy* Liliana to weaken her control of the Dreadhorde.

Mu Yanling's uncomfortably close 60ft range for the Ward Of Unbreaking is actually too far. Bolas's Globe Of Invulnerability is more like 30ft. Jace says that's another reason to get Niv back; he thinks Niv could break the Globe and Mu won't need to be 20-30ft, more like 60ft. She needs about 12 seconds though - a long time, without broken concentration. OK, noted.

- The way it actually works is that if Bolas is injured enough to be worried, but not enough to planeswalk away, then he could use a "Plan B" approach to hide in the Eye and reincarnate later
- So, we need to have the eye broken *close* to that moment so that he suddenly has to search for an alternative quickly, without much time to think
- That's where Ugin's other eye comes in
- It's possible Bolas won't even quite understand that his gem is broken and he's going into the "wrong one"

There's some question of why the Sun needs to be shut down! Taz and Gnog only get Deception 11 each, even with a Luck point, so Jace steps in and makes up a theory on the spot - not terribly convincing but *three* of us are sure so the group goes with it! Gnog does also point out that if *we* all need to escape if things go wrong, then we don't want to wait a full hour to do it!

**Teferi**, a cleric, steps forward. He claims he's partly responsible for The Mending as his own prior actions involved time travel, which is part of why The Mending was needed; and Bolas acts like he acts because The Mending stripped him of many powers. Teferi feels he needs to atone. His magic deals with time. We agree that he could shadow Mu Yanling and her 12 second spell - an eternity in battle! - can be dilated so that it takes only a tenth (!) of that time (essentially, one action, instant cast). It will be so quick that there's not even a reaction time to Counterspell.

And guilt brings us to the topic of this being a social call. Interpersonal relationships. Fight for each other, not an abstract giant concept of 'saving a universe' or similar. Gideon speaks up for a while; he ends with:

* "We will have the instinct to protect each other at the cost of the goal. But keep the goal in sight and charge towards it. He will try anything to weaken any part of us, such that it causes the entire formation to crumble. The only way to counter it is to keep driving forward even as others fall around you. *We* need to establish that right now. I think each and every one of us can quite honestly say that if we were to fall, we would want those around us to keep going, so that our loss gives them a chance to complete the task; for it to mean something. If we are all to fail because a few of us fall, then it will have been for nothing."

So it's a pact, of sorts.

"OK everyone. You have your marching orders! You have your jobs. We have 24 hours. In 24 hours, we will meet back here, check in, and anything that must be done, must have been done. We will shut down the Immortal Sun - I have it, it is somewhere safe - and by around 2pm, we will be fighting."

(Vi threatens that the Sun is in the Safehouse and if anyone but her tries to tamper with it, the entire dimension will collapse - with them in it!).

Eventually everyone is left, but us, Vi and Kaya notices we're staying. Gnog therefore must be evasive about the real location of the Sun, but thanks Vi for her expedient and unexpected deception.

Later, he excuses himself and Fee-Ree from Taz and Deni. We go into a side room. Gnog says he can't see anyone to "throw the ball to". Wants a hug! Gets one. "If this is the last day we have", says Fee-Ree, "I'd like to spend it with Arxcis. But... We had a thought..." To Gnog's surprise - and his horror - Fee-Ree suggests, even perhaps *requests* that she and Arxcis go in his stead. Taz could teach her the spell & they could go - maybe they'll live forever; gain back the time they had stolen from them. Gnog doesn't quite know what to say except "No", but at the same time, her argument is heart-breaking yet compelling, if she really wants that time with Arxcis. But we would all forget them completely - this entire quest. Even the reason for seeing Seraphina and the debt Gnog has there. Moreover, how did she know about the spell?! She saw Taz fiddle with the tuning fork from a strange invisible pocket, asked where he got it and without asking Taz answered "Ugin" before looking horrified. Fee-Ree is no stranger to planeswalking magic and knew immediately!

We go back to the others but Gnog kinda looks like death at this point, but thanks the other two, and says, "yeah, personal conversation, sorry, not quite what I expected but good to have it... Fee-Ree thinks she'll spend the day we have to wait, pretty much, with Arxcis. We give her the chronometer and say we'll see her back here at 1pm tomorrow, or thereabouts. Gnog hugs her again. "I hope you two have an amazing time - despite these very weird circumstances! It'll be strange having the day here without you, but for all the right reasons."

We all walk with her to get down to where Arxcis stays, then make ourselves scarce. After a chat - when Deni, who'd also seen the tuning fork, finds out about the Planeshift spell - we decide to help with the crystal hunt at Midori Park. Deni (good investigation skills) and Gnog (good eyes) help Taz - adv investigation only a 1,3! + 15, sigh, + BFS 2, so scrapes a dirty 20. Frustratingly low. We spend a couple of hours doing our best; starting at the warehouse we know (what's left of it) and eventually cross paths with Krenko's crew. They have boxes; they found one stash. Two crystals. Pretty good ones though. So that's great! And we thank them; we follow them back to P5, but then figure, well then - platform wreckage. But there are already people from that back here too; we piece things together. They figure they do have enough for the 12 devices they'd planned - but they're more like bombs. One-shot blasts of energy that damage or destroy the lazotep. They think just one going off in the right place should be powerful enough to take out one of the undead Gods, but they have two backups - one for each God - just in case (the "right place" is tricky!).

Gnog asks Bebe to write down the names of their full crew. We didn't have that on the platform. We want everyone to know who did this. They also decide to see Ma - they'll be working through the night; "if anyone wants to see loved ones, now is the time!". They'll meet back an hour before sunset, rested and fed, then by 1pm tomorrow (if not sooner) all will be ready.

* Gnog learns from the artificer there - **Lazaapz** - upon asking, that there were no bodies *at all*. It's a trend they've seen, a strange one. They don't know what it means. Could be Bolas; Gnog wonders, perhaps Golgari.

* He mentions that we should take it easy - in war we don't often appreciate the quiet times enough. Gnog's being selfish! What about Taz and Deni? Lazaapz recommends P3, the forests.

So, we bid farewell. Gnog takes us through coffee & ringbread and we head a fair way north, towards the P3 safe zone. On the way, he asks if Taz minds burning some message spells. "We haven't kept in touch!" he says. "How is Boboremos? And we should thank Zegana for the Krasis." So Taz uses Sending.

* "Speaker Zegana. My sincere thanks for the Krasis. Quite wonderful. How fare things?" - we learn that people from the surface have been taken in. Safety in the water.

* "Boboremos! We expect much fun by this time tomorrow, if you catch my drift. How are the Gruul faring?" - tribes are scattered, but beginning to reunite against the common enemy. If we require spear, fang and claw, the Gruul clans are spoiling for a fight. So Gnog risks it and Sending again; **"A fight you shall have. Please clear the Dreadhorde from Precinct 1 - clear path to Guildpact Hall. We start tomorrow at 1pm." - response, "Ha! Yes, that is good news. The tribes will head South with the setting sun. We have been in the Red Wastes too long."**

We eventually get to Precinct 3, looking for forest in which to chill. We find ourselves in a muster area for the Selesnyans. The armies are kept quite separate, it seems; no Boros here. We think for stress relief after a rest that maybe we'll help kick some ass on the front line! A long way away, but there are other boundaries, and thinning the way for Boboremos a bit can't hurt.

We reach a forested area near Vitu-Ghazi. Many people; just gathered, outdoors. Today, there is little singing. Groups tend to animals and look after the land, by and large. There are caravan-like sets of herd animals shipping in food. For a while, instead of just sitting around, we randomly pitch in, the three of us; why not? Just help where it looks like we can help, in a low key, not-battle-for-once kind of way.

As we work, Gnog says, "so, I don't know you very well. It occurred to me, I mean, I have to be careful out in the open talking about our plans. But if I was asked by someone about you, even with all the time we've spent, I don't know much about, well, your parents, for example." Deni says she herself only has scattered memories. "I know my mother was very beautiful - I can see her face - but the last time I saw her, I must have been - six, maybe? Maybe seven? I can't remember. My father was older. He was - well, I remember he had strong hands, and worn skin, and long grey hair, dark grey. He was softly spoken. He was always with an axe and he smelled like wood smoke and animals and tobacco. My mother was strong too. She would always lead the way while my father held me." "So you grew up in Duskhollow?" "No! I can't remember. We were on the road quite a bit. Travelled from place to place. My mother would go out during the day. I know I always saw her leave and always begged her to take me with her. Sometimes, both of them would go and that was when they'd start to leave me with my grandma outside of Duskhollow. Sometimes they were gone for weeks! They'd bring things back for us. I know now, they were providing for grandma and me. Grandma would grow things, but they would bring gold. We never spent that much time together in the end - mum always promised that they only had to do it a little bit more, and then we'd be set. We could live wherever we wanted and I could be with them always... And then one night they were called away, and I don't know if I knew at the time - but I know now, obviously - and I remember thinking this one was different - that I *had* to be with them, that I *had* to go with them, but they didn't understand... But they left. And mum and dad promised like they always do that they'd come back. I begged them to take me. But they didn't, and they never came back. We waited weeks! I don't know when grandma realised that they weren't coming back, and that's when things started to get difficult. What gold we had - it didn't last. We ran out within a year. I couldn't stay in school. But mum had a lot of books, so I read. I taught myself. A lot of stories had been written - stories *she* wrote - I wonder if they were stories about what they did? Investigations and crimes they solved. Mysteries they uncovered. Dangerous secret places that they discovered. I thought they were just the most fantastic stories! I think that's why I want to see the world. I want to see and understand what it was that was out there, that drew them away every time. That, maybe, I could find something out there that was so compelling that I could not resist its draw. I haven't found it? I haven't." "Not even the sea? Aboard the ship?" "There are beautiful, wondrous things out there. But I don't know if they mean more to me than the people I care about. I'm not my mother." 

Gnog theorises that perhaps their search was different. It wasn't the draw of the adventuring that was greater than the draw of family; it was the *need* to support a family that forced their choice.

"You know what the worst part of it is? I don't know where they went or what happened to them. Are they alive? Are they out there? Do they have a new family? Did they get trapped and want to get back to me? Did one die? I don't know. **I don't even know their names.**" Gnog just hugs her at that. "My last name is my nickname! They used to call me Tumble."

### 4pm

After a couple of hours we find a quiet spot. The Concourse is damaged, especially on upper walkways, but mostly intact and we walk some areas there. A little unnerving to see, clearly big things crashed around here.

We stand quietly, looking around. Then he gets very excited! (FULL RP NOT CAPTURED - VERY INTENSE...) - an epiphany. He explains to Deni his theory that any entity can carry the Eye through to the Ruby Palace, and Taz can create Constructs. Could it be so simple? Could he cheat his fate and ask Taz to create a Construct to convey the temporary prison of Bolas to that realm?

OK then; Jace later, to ask about the Construct idea! Taz will do a Feast tonight, too:

* Us four plus Arxcis
* Gatewatch five (Nissa, Kaya, Jace, Ajani, Gideon)
* Teferi
* Mu Yanling

### 5pm

We head to the nearer front line at the P2/P3 boundary and see if we can help out with fighting. Interestingly - no actual fighting. A standoff. Bolas doesn't want to waste his now-finite resources, perhaps. We can see the immortal sun shining away! Gnog perception only 2+9, 11. New Prahv is in the way of any good views. So we move along the wall to get a better look, since there's no fighting to join into anyway (the main front is a long way into D11/D12 and we don't have a clear idea of the safe pathways there, since Ajani always did that himself and hasn't shown us).

On the bulwark, we can see clearly to the plaza and what used to be the chamber. The army is there, spread out, but definitely thinner than we remember. Easier to see (Gnog perception 15+9). The evening sun lights things clearly. Four looming gods in the distance, around a plaza in D11. Kefnet hovers, quite high up, the other three close to triangle points, rather than a square as before. All face the Parehelion near us - a clear stand-off. Bolas there, perched upon his strange twisting obsidian monument. It is obvious that he is weaving magic. In fact we see him tracing dozens of glyphs, sequence after sequence, all in a strange purple wisp that looks similar to the way that stolen souls travel through the air. Ugh! He's shaping the spell from that energy directly. Horrible.

We talk a while. The future; possible other adventures, whatever. After downtime, of course! Deni then asks for Gnog and Taz to recite the full story at the Ruby Palace, so for security we go to the safehouse and find a room.

Gnog and Taz relay everything, step by step, Taz mostly correcting Gnog's memory but sometimes the reverse, Taz using illusions. From arrival, the God creation - Deni's very interested in that - and we tell the whole story. Deni cycles back to the God. We talk about it; the God needs belief, so it can't step through the portal on our behalf, but if there's any mileage in the Construct idea, it might be able to help with that. Or anything, who knows, it's a god! It needs more believers and after some conversation Deni suggests taking its story down to the Undercity. Taz has the idea of doing a Feast tonight, held at The Bolthole to draw a crowd, start performing and walk it out from there into the caverns. See if the messages spreads. Once the immortal sun is down, we could call upon this entity - New Garren - and see what it thinks.

Taz uses L4 for Sending to Nissa, "Big feast before big battle. All Gatewatch old and new, Mu and Teferi at Bolthole, 7pm please. Can you pass on?"

We head out of the safehouse and over to the Bolthole. We get there around 6pm, so we have a drink or two or three to pass the time. Taz constructs another bowl ready to prepare the feast. Eventually people start turning up.

* Ajani and Nissa are first. Things are quiet on the front, in fact; like we saw, no fighting. A stalemate, with Bolas busy on his spell. Gnog asks if Ajani wants to sit next to him. "Sure! Of course. Normally I'd say 'no' because it looks like you eat a lot and *I* like to eat a lot, but that's fine! I think we should just put *these big plates* in front of us..." and he moves a fair bit of food. Gnog fetches him a drink.

* Kaya arrives and Jace. Jace looks like he's just woken up! He says it's him, not the simulcrum. But that's what the simulcrum would say...

Nissa asks if there's another bowl. Taz can't make one, but says any expensive bowl will do. Kaya says "I'll be back" and darts away!

* Fee-Ree and Arxcis arrive! She knows us well, figured we'd do something like this and guessed at the time. The two ladies Grinne and Mela are with him too! It's good to see them.

* More arrive. Not just the people we expected - everyone risks it. Even the planeswalkers. They feel confident that Bolas has what he needs right now and isn't paying too much attention. Vi is here, and others. We certainly have the crowd we hoped for.

* Kaya returns swiftly. She has two expensive bowls! Nissa picks one and both her and Taz start on their respective Heroes Feast spell.

  - We can add Rowan and Will, the fire and ice twins
  - Ren, a Selesnyan druid and Jamyu a young boy with a magical dog (!) who is another planeswalker
  - And so-on; Vi uses her planning brain and figures out who will benefit most given the risk at hand.

Annoyingly Taz's 2d10 is a dreadful 6 so our party and all of gatewatch only get 6hp out of it. Nissa fares better, gifting 13 to the various people under her spell. At least we do all get all the other benefits.

All these unusual and powerful people get attention. Someone drags up *six cases* of liberated Vuliev Estate wine! Fee-Ree gets to helping with the real kitchen and cranking out food. The Bolthole starts to get crowded! People even gather outside, putting temporary tables out there.

### 8pm

The Heroes Feast spells are completed. Taz, without warning, jumps up on a table and - with a bit of Prestidigitation assistance - calls, "ATTENTION, FINE LADIES, GENTLEMEN AND GENTLEBEINGS OF THE UNIVERSE! Let me tell you a tale of wonder!"

The fine dulcimer comes out and he plays, casting illusions. He tells the story of the formation of a god. As he gets into it, he starts to make it clear that this is something he personally witnessed - the illusions they see have detail and realism that could only occur from having seen these things for real. Someone calls, "What is the name of this piece, minstrel?!" and Taz replies, "This is the story of the creation of Garren The Second. Birth of a God!"

Enhance Ability, BFS, bend luck... Bad rolls continue today. The core roll is a disappointing 22, plus 1 for BFS, bend luck is better with 3, a lot of resources for a total of only 26.

Free food, free story, free music... People are into it at least. Taz performs for a good half hour, reinforcing the idea of the story's veracity, citing Ajani and Gideon from Theros and on how their world, belief creates deities; there are other places in the multiverse where this happens it seems, for he has witnessed this! And so-on.

By 8:30, more people and more food are arriving. They ask for another performance. They ask for Amonkhet! Weird - exactly the same rolls; a 2,11+11 on the adv perf check, then BFS only 1. Fee-Ree doesn't burn resources on this one! 23 total. There was a lot to cover, though, so he just keeps going - it takes an hour.

9:30pm! Taz's performance finishes. It's gone down well!

More booze, more people. Gnog, perception 21. Wait a minute... He's seen these people before, he thinks? A group of quite beautiful looking people, dressed differently. They start wheeling out some musical equipment, big drums. Large long horn instruments, zithers and so-on. As Taz finishes, they start. The drums first, which captures attention. The drum echoes around the caverns, drawing even more people from around the area. It builds. A primal beat, people start dancing. The penny drops for Gnog - oh wow, they were musicians at the Hellfire Club! Fine fucking time for Rakdos to turn up... But still, the vibe is good, and the moral lift is useful.

This party is spreading. Our group makes its way out through the throngs of the now-definitely-not-within-fire-regulations Bolthole, and we start hearing sounds from caverns beyond. The Rakdos or other people are joining in. We feel it - everyone knows that there is a big battle tomorrow. Word has spread. It's a chance to have one last release, to connect with each other, with the planet; the Selesnyans dancing with Rakdos, Boros; Gnog sees some Kraul nearby. He and Taz approach. They gesture, to try and get them to join; persuasion 26. They don't mingle, keep to the edges, but they emerge and don't hide. They dance! People aren't frightened by them. People don't keep away; they are happy to be close. The mood changes. It's not just people afraid of Kraul, it's Kraul afraid of people; the unconscious distance that people used to keep. It's been days now, people have been mixed down here this whole time. Maybe ten days or so. The barrier has broken down.

Slowly, through adversity, the planet finds ways to grow.

"To think", says Taz, "a society 10,000 years old can still change". The party is no longer ours - it's Ravnica's and we leave them to it. We make sure the planeswalkers get safely back to the safehouse, behind the protection of the screen; and as we exit back to the surface, even up there, we can hear the sound beneath us. A few others have come up for air! "Fresh air -" says one "- feels good on the skin and in the lungs!". A memory of life before the war, some joy found. Some younger ones head back down. We'll rest up.

We wander under the moonlit sky; Gnog asks Fee-Ree if she and Arxcis want to carry on, having their day together. We can find anywhere they like to sleep. They say they'd like to stay with us now. So, we figure - the old apartment building still stands. So yes! We'll do that. We get up onto the Bulwark. There's a strange calm tonight. No fighting - wary soldiers on patrol, but that curious stalemate persists.

### 10:30pm

We reach the old apartment. The building seems empty, but we do see a couple of windows with light - that's all, in this huge place, though. Stepping inside, it still feels familiar. No wonder Fee-Ree teleports here in a push - that time we reconnected here bound us to it a bit. In RP, we note that Fee-Ree and Arxcis just want a quiet life and it seems that much of what she suggested about them going to the Ruby Palace really was just to get Gnog out of trouble.

And so, with that, knowing the trial that lies ahead, but somehow centred now because all the preparation we can do is done and the day is finally almost upon us, the waiting over - we go to sleep.

(END OF PART 24 - Part 25 next)
