# Gnog: Part 1.2
## SKYREACH
### Skyreach: Day 1 (Hunting Lodge)

We awaken and debate our next move. Gnog is keen to somehow tackle the lodge. We've seen people in there via the eyes of birds, one of whom is a strange fellow; older, white haired, maybe elven, certainly slight, but looked like he'd be a powerful wizard given the chance. We've seen enough of them lately! No weapons or armour; a staff. Must surely be important to the cult; and this is a strange nexus, I mean, _five_ teleportation circles.

But Fee-Ree brings Gnog back to earth. Naerytar was _rough_. A horrible body count and that fireball was just awful. She's very upset and reminds us: "What are we even doing here? All we were asked to do was follow a caravan South and report on it, but suddenly we're chasing _something_ along the coast, become embroiled in the castle battle... This isn't our business. We're not supposed to do this by ourselves. We need to find a way home, tell people what we observed and get help."

There's a heart-to-heart for a while. The confusion and intensity of what went on at the castle made it easy to forget how it had personally affected Fee-Ree, how close we'd come to being killed and - while we're glad and very fortunate to have found a way out of there - it's true that we probably had no business being _in_ there in the first place. And Fee-Ree doesn't want more death and destruction without us understanding, truly, **why we are doing it and what it is all for**.

Well, then, here we are. Gnog says, "Yes, perhaps down the road. I wonder if I can find a bird to help us find a safe way?"

It takes a while, but he finds an eagle. He's never flown with one before.

And my, how it *soars!* It's glorious; Gnog's speechless. It flies high, and through its astonishing vision, it feels like Gnog can see the whole world in an early, crisp, sunny morning. The mountains, rivers, a giant forest of some sort to the West, a strange marsh region to the East with something shimmering beyond that is brown and dry looking. After a while, the eagle circles back and we see the lodge; a disorientating view of himself and the party for a moment, then the road. The bird flies down. Nothing in sight, then eventually a village or town...

...And something impossible. There is a castle, out of place, too big, next to the village; but the village is set next to some kind of sharp drop, a cliff or chasm. The castle is ringed by cloud and _floats_. It just hangs there, a short distance away from the edge, incongruous. Just *there*.

Gnog sincerely thanks the eagle. He's narrated what he saw as it happens. When he gets back to his "own eyes", he sees incredulous faces - almost unbelieving; "a *floating castle?!*" asks Deni - yep! For real.



### Skyreach: Day 2 (Lodge To Town)

After a nervous night on watch we head into town. We quickly notice lots of cult activity on approach and elect to wear our cult robes as a poor, but at least at-a-glance passable disguise.

The TL;DR is that we briefly spend time in a tavern, but find the barman very gruff and withdrawn; there is an undertone of hating the cult - but - they're _everywhere_ and it's clear that people are too frightened to speak against them.

We make our way over to the side of town closest to the castle. A big warehouse is being used as a staging ground. We narrowly avoid being seen by a carriage arriving containing, it transpires, none other than **Rezmir herself**. News of Naerytar thus arrives in town. She has told "**Talis The White at the Lodge**" to be on full alert - OK, so we suspect we have a name for the strange person we saw through a window there. Deni infiltrates - _wyverns_ are being ridden, loaded up with all manner of treasures, heading in groups to the castle. Overhearing Rezmir, Deni learns that transfer of most treasure is complete anyway and Rezmir orders these flights to be the last as the castle antics have forced plans to advance.

Some key knowledge is obtained - passwords! Very old-school... We overhear instructions to a rider for "Tiamat Our Mother & Strength" or "Hail Blagothkus". We don't know what the second one means or which we should use and under what circumstances.

We bide our time, hidden. Rezmir departs for the castle. At a point where there are the fewest guards we've seen and only two wyverns left, we make a show of helping carry a few last crates to be transferred to the great baskets strapped to the beasts and use surprise to start an attack. The battle is difficult, but a Slow spell from Fee-Ree proves critical in stopping one of the wyverns escaping while we focus on another. Neither its rider nor the beast have enough time to get off the ground.

A bit of luck and Gnog's affinity for animals gives us enough Animal Handling to persuade the two wyverns to let us ride them. And with that...

...we're flying. Flying astride wyverns, straight off a cliff edge, castle floating on the clouds up ahead. It's incredible. A huge rush - we can scarcely believe the turn of events and it's a moment of joy and excitement in stack contrast to the stresses of the previous few days.

As we get closer, though, we start to spot difficulties! How will we get in undetected? Two main levels seem to be available for landing but they're busy and we don't know which password to use, or if we'll be able to bluff our way in in any event. A lucky perception roll however spots a curious hole on the lower side of the castle, barely visible through the shifting clouds around the castle base. It looks like somewhere we could land and, just barely (Wyverb acrobatics coupled with animal handling rolls) **we manage to land there**.

The wyverns are really restless here and, what's more - it's ice. This isn't rock. The tunnel leads back a short way and terminates in an area that can be used as a temporary stable for the wyverns, with a wide, low side-tunnel offset on one side. Back towards the exit/entrance, there are deep scratches in the ice and scuffs all along as if something very big dragged itself out of here and/or clawed in. Very disconcerting indeed. We start to share some of the wyverns' nerves!

We take a short rest. While we're doing that, the castle starts to move. We watch out of our bolthole tunnel as the clouds swirl, giving brief views of the land dropping away. We seem to be going very, very high up and moving quite quickly.

There of course follows a period of investigation. We discover something truly terrifying - an adult white dragon lies in the bowels of this castle. This explains the ice and, we realise, the exit/entrance tunnel markings we saw before and the disposition of the wyverns. Through the assistance of a small family of friendly rats, Gnog is able to determine the location of a giant larder, clearly intended for the dragon, along with a schedule through which cultists feed the dragon. We find an opportunity to sneak out some meat from that to keep the wyverns happy for a while and, in addition, decide to risk it; we have to know what the dragon's deal is - we echo the behaviour and deference we see in the cultists at feeding time.

A conversation ensues. We realise pretty quickly that this dragon is maybe not the brightest, but that said, it probably knows we're not cult members, or at least that _something_ is odd because it's not the scheduled feeding time. Even so, it appears to be spectacularly arrogant and clearly does not believe any sort of thread exists so it talks anyway.

* It is Glazhael, a male which we judge to be probably quite young given the shortness of its name and its stature - to us, giant, but really not that big compared to sizes we've heard described for older dragons.
* It seems arrogant and vain, but the vanity is understandable. While this chromatic dragon reeks of evil, it is undeniably a truly spectacular creature. Terrifying yet somehow handsome, a shining, brilliant thing to behold.
* It seems that Glazhael expects Tiamat to grant him domain over Arauthater's realm (another, older white dragon) in return for guarding her hoard - and in that, we realise that Tiamat's hoard is in part - or perhaps even in full - present at this very castle.

The dragon bores of us quickly and we make a hasty retreat.



### Skyreach: Day 3 (investigations)

More investigations. For a while, Gnog uses a strange spell that turns him into a cloud! He finds on the upper level a strange tower with, in Giant - which Gnog speaks and reads - "**Esclarota Forever**". We've already deduced that this **Blagothkus** name is the giant who owns the castle, apparently calling himself a king but it might be a matter of some debate. The tower and implied (to Gnog's cultural view) femininity of Esclarota leads us to think they might be a couple. Observations in corridors reveal at least one red wizard staying in a room at the end of a corridor with Rezmir staying somewhere nearer the main stairwell on the same corridor.

The rats have given us information on two stone giant seers, that look for visions in a great cauldron from a small (for giants) room off the lower courtyard. They are **Wiglof and Hulda**. We further learn that the rats are nervous in corridors, especially at night, because of a *vampire* (yes, a vampire - well, there's also a more plausible theory of an undead elf) that stalks the hallways. Ogres and cobalts are present in some barracks. Across the courtyard from Wiglof and Hulda are more barracks with 10-14 various black, blue and red Dragonwing cultist human defenders. There is a mysterious empty "human scale" room and three empty giant rooms; this place isn't full despite the number of creatures we've seen.

In the end, we have to risk it and at night end up in a conversation with Wiglof and Hulda by sneaking into their room - they're out, actually, but return to find us little folk. They don't feel threatened by our small stature but at least Gnog's goliath ability to speak in Giant gives a tiny sliver of trust and, through a reasonable persuasion roll, it's enough. Besides - it turns out they've seen visions of our party and an uncertain, shifting future for Blagothkus, who we learn is a cloud giant.

* It transpires that giant society is fractured; different giants arguing over resources and territory, despite their affinity for quite different landscapes/environments; they are too few in number to afford such battles and admonishments.
* Blagothkus seeks to reunite, so calls himself a king for those that follow him, though traditional cloud giant society has its own king. The giants here do follow, though, but they fear for him.
* It turns out that he'd been persuaded to assist the cult on a promise of riches that would assist his campaign to reunite his kind. However, things have since gone bad. More and more cultists arrived, including a vampire (eeek, confirmed!) called **Sandesyl** and of course the dragon itself. Blagothkus is trapped; unwilling to admit a mistake, but in any event unable to rectify it, since the dragon if riled could destroy the castle.
* Blagothkus does not leave because of Esclarota. She is in fact deceased, but was his wife. Her spirit lives on in the magical fabric of the castle and is how it actually flies and is piloted. Blagothkus speaks to her and controls the castle's flight from the tower Gnog saw in during his strange gas cloud period. Magical wards mean that only he may enter.

We are conflicted. If giant society unites, it could be bad news for everyone else. But the enemy of my enemy... Gnog also feels a strange pang of sadness and empathy for this strange cloud giant; a desire to reunite in order to stop death and decline, yet staying in this strange castle because his lost love is locked here forever. Gnog thinks he understands these days how deeply that must hurt. A truce is agreed with the stone giants. They think we have a role to play. Who are we to argue. They will try to convince Blagothkus to give us an audience.

We retreat to our bolthole in the ice tunnel and take stock. From all we've seen and learned, it's a very difficult situation.

* At least one cloud giant
* The two stone giants
* A vampire
* Ogre and cobalt barracks
* 10-14 dragonwings
* Rezmir
* The red wizard we saw is **Rath Modar** and there is a second one here, too. Apparently they might be traitors to Thay? The red wizard cult leader **Severin**, whom they consider an ally, is apparently an outcast.
* A white dragon, Glazhael
* One mysterious "human scale" large room, empty
* Three empty giant size rooms

(A side-note: At some point in all of this, Gnog used a potion or similar that turned him into a fog cloud for an hour. He got a good look at the vampire's tower and some of the upper levels previously inaccessible, even to the rates, due to the open ground or wide open courtyards).

With the assistance of the two stone giants Wiglof and Hulda, we gain an audience with Blagothkus. In turn, it takes some convincing, but we end up in an uneasy alliance. The unlikely alliance's chances were bolstered by Blagothkus himself already having had second thoughts. He finally opens up about being trapped into things as the dragon cult gradually strengthened their position to a point where they could start ignoring parts or all of certain previously agreed conditions; Blagothkus faced a political situation where he had to save face and appear to be willing to continue to service their wishes, along with an inability to act in the face of the forces they have to bear. We are sufficiently powerful that, combined with Blagothkus' forces, can offer him a way to regain his castle and his independence.

* The castle holds a lot of treasure for sure, but it's only a fraction of the hoard. This is load number 13, with 12 loads carried prior!
* As a result, they're flying straight for the **Well Of Dragons** - which would mean certain death for us.
* The vampire is called **Sandesyl**.



### Skyreach: Day 4 (The Attack)

We have organised a plan. Blagothkus has a prearranged meeting with Rezmir at a known time today. He will keep Rezmir preoccupied for as long as possible. In that time, we will try to acquire the black dragon mask.

Battle will then be inevitable with Rezmir and the two red wizards. We will just have to be as prepared as we can be. We'll then try and get a during-day long rest, fight the vampire before the daylight is gone and before it's had a chance to wake, realise what's gone on and rouse the dragon, long rest, fight the dragon...

It begins. We break into Rezmir's room without much trouble but the setup is strange. A carpet, with only a thin area around the edges to move, a chest on a table in the centre. It smells like a trap. We try to stand either side on the stone floor edges of the room and throw a rope between two of us to hook the table and drag it off the carpet; but it turns out that the carpet is alive in some magical sense and at this action it attacks.

So we start our day battling a carpet! It has a nasty habit of trying to wrap and smother you and, if someone tries to attack it, weaponry tends to pass through and injure the person inside too. Nonetheless we prevail and to our astonishment *a person appears from the tattered remains*. We have inadvertently rescued **Sarqarim**, a bard who was on the same trail as us, but further ahead. He tried to get to the black mask but fell prey to the carpet.

Sarqarim and Deni attempt to unlock the chest. Thanks to the advantage conferred by their combined efforts, this high difficulty task is achieved; we learn through magical inspections that the chest had a trap that would have teleported the contents away if triggered. We have avoided this. **The black dragon mask is ours!**

We lay in wait for Rezmir, flanking the door; Sarqarim stands at the end of the room, facing the door. As Rezmir enters, he gets a chance to say a few choice words before we get into battle. We have the upper hand from the start. Between the five of us, **we defeat her** and the two drakes she had with her as guards. This is no small victory but there is no time to lose. We run down the corridor and burst into the room with the two red wizards. We manage to focus on a nearer one and take him down, but the other has thrown up an arcane shield while we focused on the first; we are unable to get through. We do finally get in some hits, but the wizard runs to the balcony and flies away, shouting warnings about how much we'll regret it... **This is, indeed, Rath Modar - but he has escaped!**

Despite this disappointment, we find a *lot* of information in the two rooms about cultist activities. Rezmir is gone and the dragon mask is ours. This is a significant victory, but more work remains.

We rest, until it's nearing the end of the day. The castle ascends to the maximum possible altitude to maintain sunlight. It strikes at a low angle, the vampire tower creating long shadows; it'll have to do. The plan involves Garren being able to fly up to a crumbling balcony near the top where we've seen the vampire reside, drop a rope and Gnog climbing, while Deni and Fee-Ree wait below - Sarquarim helping with Fee-Ree for spells and Deni to be a sniper in case the vampire flees. Gnog gets onto the tower roof and manages to smash through a side which causes enough sunlight to come into the room that some of it illuminates the tail end of the "crypt" - really, a kind of stone coffin - that we find inside. We drop inside intending to push the crypt out and over the edge of the balcony in an attempt to smash it.

As we do this, we are set upon by two other vampires. We realise there are *three* here! We make many mistakes in combat, but manage to use the small amount of sunlight to vanquish two; it seems they're lower level. Sandesyl himself is fearsome and eventually turns into a bat and flies out of the tower. Deni manages to get in a good sneak attack hit and the bat drops, the nearby stone giants smash a killing blow - poetic - knocking the bat into the sunlight. The vampire is truly gone. For good measure, the crypt is finally pushed out and smashed, its earth scattered over the edge of the castle into the skies beyond.



### Skyreach: Day 4 (Glazhael)

One more rest, then to battle. Our plan is to put poison into the body of one of several deer that hang in the freezer room, then masquerade as cultists feeding the dragon, copying what we saw in the hour or so after we'd first arrived here.

Glazhael eats, but detects the poison immediately taking no ill effects and is very, very angry. Gnog and Garren take full blast from frost breath, but Sarquarim is now aiding us in resisting the worst of its effect and Garren helps us avoid fear. We battle on. **Fee-Ree is able to cast a L4 storm in the part of the lair that's near the main exit** which would lead to where we'd left our wyverns. The dragon fights for a while but eventually starts to turn to flee, yet the storm slows it and continues to injure it. We almost go down, but ultimately, through no small amount of luck and in no small part thanks to Fee-Ree's very useful spell, the dragon is killed.

This is by far our biggest battle and our first dragon. We know we can take one down now, but this was not a true lair for this creature and it was very constrained by the size and shape of the cavern and its exits. Luck was on our side and really, it was this younger white dragon's arrogance and assumption of protection from the giants and cultists that led to its demise.

It is a strange, sombre moment, too. While evil and terrible, this dragon is - was - undeniably a beautiful creature, spectacular in every physical aspect. We harvest things that Fee-Ree is sure will be very useful, but try to be, somehow, respectful.

Later, we come up to the lower courtyard to find a fierce battle between the giants and the various cultists that were stationed there. We join in, with Fee-Ree letting off a fireball that takes out a good few of the airborne Draognwings.

With that, finally, it is done.

The giants, it must be said, are less respectful. The ogres and other smaller helpers on the castle waste no time in starting to chop up the creature. Frozen treasure starts to be thawed. We are offered a piece each as victors, and take what we think may be valuable or useful in future endeavours. **The mood is jubilant - the castle is free and (largely!) intact.**

Offering to set us down where we might choose, but noting that the preference is to head North back towards the Spine of the World, we decide to be set down near Nesmé (Nesmay). We know it and the faster pathways from there to elsewhere.

This is quite dramatic. Some distance from the city, rolling green hills of swaying grass descend lazily towards its walls but, on the far side, they are cut abruptly by a valley that's in part steep-walled enough to perhaps be called a chasm. Wreathed in cloud, the castle slows its approach and, as if part of a low-lying early morning mist, settles into the valley. A long drawbridge is lowered and we bid our farewells.

**"May we meet again, Blagothkus", says Gnog.**

Before we exit the drawbridge, we see stone giant to Wiglof nodding Hulda, who calls Gnog to wait one moment. Hulda approaches, bends down and - surprisingly quietly, so that only Gnog can hear - says:

**"We can no longer see your future. We know not what that means..."**

Gnog hopes it is a sign that they still have a chance to succeed - or fail - but at least their fate does not seem to be set. We step onto the grass and the drawbridge rises; the clouds form up over the entrance and the castle starts to rise away.

**"Farewell, little giant!" shouts Blagothkus in the distance as it departs.**

The early morning sun hangs low in a clear blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds - it is a picturesque, crisp morning. One of the clouds is moving up away from the valley, looking to a casual observer like rising early mist. Snow capped mountains line the horizon and rolling hills of long green grass surround the party. A gentle wind makes the grass sway in ripples that look like waves on a green sea. In the far distance, just barely visible, are the walls of Nesmé.

"Come on," says Gnog, and the party starts the long walk towards the city. "I think we've still got plenty more work to do."
