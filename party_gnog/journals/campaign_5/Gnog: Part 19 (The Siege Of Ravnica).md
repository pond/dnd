# Gnog: Part 19 (The Siege Of Ravnica)

Lost amongst crowds of terrified civilians, we are led down to caverns. Habitable, as promised; huge amounts of hoarded siege food is here. The Selesnyans have played their part perfectly.

But... It feels so wrong. We're not civilians. We shouldn't be here, we should be fighting. And yet here we *all* are - Nissa, somewhere; Ajani, Jace, Kaya, and the exhausted four of us.

A sudden other thought jumps to front of mind for Gnog: ***Arxcis***. As he thinks that, Fee-Ree exclaims, simultaneously, "Oh! Where is Arxcis! Is he here? Where is he?!" and she digs for the stone. "Where are you? We're down with the Kraul. Where are you? How do I find you? Tell me you're OK!" and thankfully, an answer - "We are here. Me, Mela, Grinna. We've been evacuated. We are in... Uhhh. Sector? D? G! Where are you?" - but won't be able to answer until dawn.

Gnog rallies a little, even if still afraid. He asks the Boros soldier for his name; "Mikhail" is the nervous answer; Gnog clears his throat; channels his old officer mannerisms from the army; the soldier stands taller and answers again - "Private Mikhail Onduin". He's a minotaur. Then he adds, "My company... They're all gone... Are we lost?" Gnog says, "No survivor guilt, soldier. Your bravery will be remembered. We gave Ravnica time - almost two days." The solider salutes. He starts moving to help others; to give himself something to do. And Gnog calls after him - "and remember the fallen, soldier! You alone are left to tell their story."

He turns to his party. Focuses on Deni. "You OK?" "Should we not be up there?" "My feelings too. But... OK, so I've redefined what it means to be afraid today..." Fee-Ree looks exhausted. At least she's figured out that we're in a neighbouring sector - she goes to find Arxcis. After about 15 minutes, while the rest of us talk, she returns with the three including Arxcis.

Gnog looks for the highest-apparent ranking Kraul, but they're not around. Just the Selesnyans. So Gnog looks for the highest-ranking Selesnyan! A solider. "Soldier, thank you. Where are the Kraul?" "I don't know - we haven't encountered any... They must have prepared this area and vacated it for us..." Gnog sends a paper bird to Vraska. "You must know by now, situation is dire. And yet, we live. Please encourage Kraul to be seen. Ravnica must know who helped them."

Kaya says, "Wow. A far cry from the manor. But that won't be the safest place to be!" and another pit-of-stomach feeling - Gnog thinks of Taysa; but instead of focusing on that, he says to Kaya, "...You're what we call Shadar-Kai, in part. Shaowfell." "How do you know?" "We have visited them. They helped us. Never be ashamed of that. Be proud of it; it's a big deal where we come from, misunderstood, but very important and, I dare say, in a way noble." "The worship of the Raven Queen is not something of which most people are very forgiving, for nobody understands her and we fear that which we don't understand." Gnog answers, "Yes. As with Ravnicans and the Kraul. I don't know how we win this. But if I gave into despair, I may as well be dead; so I have to assume success, somehow, however improbable and I want things to be better, not worse, after the troubles ahead. *I* understand the Raven Queen - a bit. Others do too. As with Kraul, never be ashamed of who you are. You're important."

Ajani has been busy rallying people he thinks have skills to help here. He comes to us. "We're at the beginning of a long campaign. We must be wise with our resources. It's going to be a guerrilla operation, I feel, if we cannot resist the invasion; we must hold their forces back to get civilians to safety. We're no use if tired and weakened. We must trust in our brothers and sisters on the surface tonight to hold their own. We must rest to relieve them of their duties when dawn breaks. I urge all of you, think of it one step at a time. One skirmish, one battle, one defeat, one victory at a time. We will piece small victories into something bigger. I know it is not easy, but you must try to sleep."

Whatever our feelings about joining the battle, we know we're tired. Exhausted, even. We must sleep. And we try.



## Day 52 (Ravnica 32, Riglan 88 - 6 hours shifted forward) - local day Monday (7 day week)

Taz's internal clock (and Gnog's chronometer) tell us it's morning, but it's hard to tell in the caverns. Lighting here is soft, not quite dim, but perpetual. Netting with phosphorescent moss, mostly.

People are of course very scared. A lot of effort is being put into trying to calm people down, settle them, get through today, get through tomorrow; address immediate concerns.

* Deni's birthday! 
* Gives her ice carving
* Shows her portrait - full of hope back then
* She's very brave
* We're going to make things hopeful again - Ajani overhears. "Hope has never left us. In fact if it is hope upon which we thrive, hope is stronger now than it ever has been. Hope is a flower that grows in adversity; in the absence of trouble there is no need for it. It is the fruit and labour of pain, hardship and difficulty."
* Gnog is so sorry that he's put her through so many bad things
* She has to be even more brave now

Gnog perception 27. Taz is present. Fee-Ree is not there. Taz saw her walk down the tunnels towards one of the main areas, and we assume Arxcis.

Taz, unexpectedly, confronts Gnog, looking angry. "I asked you to promise to defeat Bolas." Gnog regretfully acknowledges; "And I could not promise. But have faith. That's why we are gathering." Fee-Ree returns shortly, with Arxcis.

Fee-Ree tells us stuff. Apparently we learn that Nissa is giving people routines; jobs. Water duties, water stations, rosters that kind of thing. Some Selesnyans are even running classes. There's a food warehouse! It's great - distracting people.

We go to find Nissa, following where Ajani headed off. We catch up. Jase is a distance away. Kaya is sat against a wall looking bored and angry. Nissa is still assigning jobs, but she's able to hand that off. She reminds us that whatever *we* are going through - Kaya is pissed off! - that's not for the general population. They have to be OK.

Jace says the surface isn't looking good. Gnog asks how many came through the gate; Jace isn't sure; the Bulwark has been shored up to try and contain them. On the Immortal Sun, Jace thinks the barrier would be unbreakable, even if Bolas did consume all of Ravnica.

* Bolas has no preognition - but he has the Azorius. Surely, many now must disagree, but there's Dovan... Can we take out Dovan?

* Jace confesses something worse. **"It's gone" - the power of the Guild Pact is gone!** We never activated our plan where he'd be challenged; what happened? Surely not the destruction of the Chamber, that wouldn't do it?

* Nissa goes to a wall and performs some sort of spell. She becomes translucent; roots extend from her into the walls and ground; eventually it fails. She says, "The leylines are severed. They converged in the Chamber and that must have been one of the things holding the Guild Pact together. It was no accident that he opened the portal over it."

* We figure there must somehow still be enough power in the megafauna spell to hold it in place, but this means it is vulnerable. Nikya? Domri? Ajani says he sent Domri running - but dead - out into the wastes. Nikya is probably smart enough. Domri? A worry. But probably not much we can do.

* One more thing, Jace confesses. Niv, Ral, his assistant and a few others in Nivix "kind of went ahead with all the necessary steps to prepare Niv to receive the Power Of The Guild Pact". He was the last one to have a connection with it. He left the plane; did he leave with an echo of the blueprint? A way to restore it somehow?

So Kaya starts scraping in the earth with her shadow blade - a plan - terrible noise while she does it. She says:

* We must help shore up defences on the bulwark so that the undead army can only head South, P1/P2 and beyond; North of that we might be relatively safe.
* She thinks we'll need the Verdani for that. But we have to get to the surface for druids to activate the ritual for that.
* Jace is *pretty* sure that Niv has enough of an imprint of the Pact to be able to regain it at the Chamber site - but we must shut the gate too.
* That means the planeswalker Amonkhet infiltration plan is back on the able.

On Vi, Jace when he popped his consciousness up to the surface found that the planeswalkers were just about holding the line. They're alive, but fighting - he suggests we should just get to the surface.

- Kaya needs to find a way behind enemy lines. She needs to find Taysa. She'll come up with us and then we part at the surface.
- Ajani - Insight Taz 17 - is brave but uncertain about going to the surface; Taz talks him into coming with us and we'll try to get to P4 / Sunhome.
- Jace needs to find Vi, but because she's shielded so he has to go there physically. He wants to check on Nivix too; check Niv's chamber, see if there are any clues.

We start on our way - Jace headed one way, the rest of us another. On the way, we see some Kraul, lurking just out of reach of light. Gnog asks the others to wait a moment and approaches with Taz. They retreat as we get closer. Gnog says it's OK, we know we look strange.

One leans in, making clicking sounds of their language. Taz casts Comprehend Languages. "Oh. No. We didn't think we were visible." (Gnog realises they are younger). "We saw some of the fleshling children playing. They are very close to the broken corridors - they would fall and die. We are here to make sure they don't."

Gnog thanks them; and in the ensuing discussion, we are offered two guides. Jace will head to Nivix and Kaya to Sunhome with the rest of us. We split up. Nissa has made her own way to get to P3 and the Verdani because of course they already know the routes well now.

We are left at the "closest exit" to Sunhome. There's a trapdoor. The guide leaves us. We're in the cellar (of what turns out to be an old bakery - see below). We are asked to mark the building when we exit, so we know how to get back. We check with Kaya and Ajani, they don't intend to use this and Deni can find it easily, so we don't risk marking it at this time - others might see our mark.

Kaya and Deni check above the cellar. It's empty. We move up. It looks like it was abandoned in a hurry, looks like things were grabbed as people ran, other stuff left - dough that would have probably have been baked today, measured ingredients and so-on, all left behind. We bid farewell to Kaya and sneak out, watching the skies carefully.

Gnog: Perception only 2+8! 10! Kaya is distracting; "watch out for that!" - a dead body of a Boros soldier leaning against the wall. Looks like he's died of wounds. "Fuck", says Gnog. We look around more. Gnog's military training kicks in. Signs everywhere of struggle and battle. What did they fight *here*? Did they fight them back behind the Bulwark? Ajani believes some undead made it through before the wall closed. There may be breaches. Then Ajani's ears pick up. "I hear the sound of battle!" - Gnog can hear it distantly. It's not a skirmish, but a constant big battle. It's the wall. Ajani thinks a while... "I don't think you need me at Sunhome...?" - 

Ajani starts to run off - Gnog shouts "give 'em hell!" - but as he runs, Gnog can train his eyes on the distant horizon. As he tries to see what it's about, he talks idly to try and keep his party distracted.

* Friends could die in the tribe - you move on
* Open to emotions now
* Had been an interference; made him lose focus, question decisions, even freeze - like last night
* Gone from being the rock and rope holding down the tent, to the canvas of the tent itself, threatening to fly off in a storm, relying upon others
* But not now. Rage. Hatred. Channeling this - is the goliath way.

He can see the Bulwalk edge from here, not a great view but it's visible, so Gnog finds a vantage point to get a look up. The others follow; we end up via an apartment block with a good clear view over it.

Oh dear.

The wall is *heavily* patrolled and armed, defended, crawling with Boros guards. Constant battle on there - trying to push invaders back. There are a few on the streets of P4, too, engaging with undead who "leak through". But it's beyond that which takes the breath away. Undead swarm beyond.

The gate is clearly visible. The looming archways, the horns, on the gate temple, standing where the Chamber once did. Taz is hiding behind Gnog. So Gnog reaches down, and says, "we most confront the fear. That's our enemy. We'll probably go with others to Amonkhet; I know you're afraid; you won't be alone, and..." but then Gnog - Wisdom saving 13 - sees what Taz is actually hiding from. Perched on top of New Prahv, sits Nicol Bolas himself. Broad daylight this time, towering over P2, looking out over his spreading armies.

Gnog says to Taz, "Oh, right, *THAT!* Well, yes, we'll go to Amonkhet and try to close that bridge and get rid of that temple but *that* is another story. You could try and do what I do. Turn the fear into cold hatred. That's working for me."

Deni wonders where the planeswalkers are. And then fear grips her too. That distant ground looks strange, odd shadows; but then we realise that *all* of the distant ground there, isn't a black shadow. It's blueish black, with glints in the sunlight occasionally. It's *carpeted* with undead. Not just swarming, it's teeming with the armoured undead. It appears to be so densely filled with them that entire batalions arrayed on the *other* side of the gate portal just waiting; there's no more space for them.

"We're going to need to get a better warning to districts South of here..." says Gnog, but he figures the Selesnyans are on it. Perhaps that's why they seem a bit bottled up here - defenses in a Southern district that's confining them.

Deni says, "I don't like this one bit. Bolas looks like he's waiting..." - and she descends the wall. Fee-Ree is surprised and follows, to check on her. Taz and Gnog stay up for a moment.

* **Gnog assesses. Bolas we have a plan for, but it depends on the gate closing. But that means we need to get Niv to the ex-Chamber area, without Bolas seeing *and* through an army of undead. Perhaps we evacuate fully a Southern District, then allow that army to flood that way, as a distraction?** He asks Taz to think on that as a plan option, if only to keep himself distracted.

We get back down. Fee-Ree is holding Deni's hand and we walk along - then they tense up. Around the corner marches a group of what eventually call Eternals. **Armoured as described, almost like scarab beetles in appearance; jackal-headed; blades drawn, fresh blood on them. Four here, but maybe more beyond.** Taz quietly says, "Obviously, it's *them*."

Their heads turn and they see us.

Gnog shouts, "Remember, we have to destroy the armour *first* before you can get to the undead inside!"

**Initiative!**

* Deni 22
* Gnog 20
* Fee-Ree 20
* Taz 14

Deni immediately takes aim at the leader. Crit! Against the armour, of course. 67 damage total; the arrow strikes the Eternal's armour right in the chest, and the armour splinters, shattering at the centre. The eternal took the damage and its armour we think is meant to keep it up, con save DC 5 + damage - or no save, for a critical hit. A gem set behind the armour, in the middle of the chest, is skewered in this particular Eternal's case. It drops, apparently properly dead. The way it shuts down makes it look more like a construct than an undead.

Taz, intelligence-based perception check, 19 total + BFS 4 -> 23. "Ah! That gem! The gem in the middle is important, it kept that thing's life force going somehow!" - and he also noticed that the gem had a kind of "it's supposed to glow" look about it and shattering it shattered whatever magic was holding the eternal together. It's strange. He can see the others, those gems aren't glowing either. Is this what Bolas is waiting for? Something else to come through the gate to power the army to a greater strength? He shouts, "We need to get this over with and get to Feather urgently!"

* At least he's noted a vulnerability. The gem is exposed for whatever reason and breaking it causes serious, possibly fatal damage to this strange undead, or construct. The gem itself is not armoured. Deni hit by chance and Taz got the insight. The armour as the creature fails could be ripped off if you were strong enough, in melee.

As the armour breaks, around the corner, we see a strange miasma envelop the area; and an undead-looking vizier of some kind turns the corner, apparently the source of this effect. It seems to have released a cloud, dust, poison or something, as it appeared in response. Lifeless eyes. He looks towards us, levels his a long sceptre/staff towards Fee-Ree and Deni and throws some kind of very long range poison spray.

Fee-Ree sees this as a strange poison version of magic missile; she's immune to poison - her amulet glows as it splashes on her. Deni is resistant - only 2 poison damage.

The strange poison cloud appears to soak into the armour of the other three Eternals, but it spreads out behind the building, beyond what Gnog can see.

Gnog rages - and this time, it's a strange, welcome feeling. He shouts, "The poison went further - there are probably more of them!" as he rage-runs and manages to *just* scrape into melee range with the nearest Eternal. With Stormbringer he swings twice. He's aiming for the gem. He's reckless in his attacks; letting all the emotions out. Sadly his first attack isn't enough to hit the armour (1,6->18 highest), but the second attack hits much better - 29 total - adv. athl check is dirty 20, strike damage 13, lightning 9 -> 22. **The armour is not cracked.** Gnog sees two more around a corner and, accordingly, shouts, "Two more around the corner!"

The Elemental Gnog attacked strikes back twice. Miss, hit. 9->4 damage; there's additional poison damage thanks to the Vizier now, which would be 1, but halves to 0.

An Elemental behind that one attacks twice - first is a Crit; 22->11, 6->3 poison. Second attack hits too. 11->5, 3->1. Hmm. A *third* comes and flanks (though with reckless, doesn't make much difference) and hits twice, halving down to 8 and 6 damage. **And a fourth!** Misses twice.

Fee-Ree's turn. She moves forward, but of course Gnog is in the middle of things and a bit in the way. She casts a twinned Firebolt at the Vizier. Only the first hits, its armour deflecting the other. 3d10 -> 19 damage. The armour is undamaged, but the Vizier is hurt. She uses sorcery points to send a Sphere Of Chaos, which hits as fire damage for 4d8->18 damage. The Vizier falls; the armour tries to raise it, but it doesn't work (DC 23, Con save 20). The poison mist dissipates.

Gnog perception adv. 20 (damn, why wasn't that my next attack roll? Annoying!) + 8 -> 28; things are getting much worse. Another five Elementals and some taller, bigger, other character. Some kind of captain? Gnog shouts, "We're in the shit, there's six more!"

Taz can't do much except try Eldritch Blast. A decisive hit and two that just scrape in - but all three hit - the Eternal that most recently attacked Gnog. The damage roll is quite high - a total of 32. Surprisingly, it falls at this - 32 was just enough apparently! - and the attacks are considered to land simultaneously, so it can't make a con save of 32+5 and is also downed. He sends bardic inspiration to the besieged Gnog.

The new arrival, the taller, Captain-like creature, runs sideways to get a clear view of our party spread down the street, pulls out a longbow and fires twice at Fee-Ree. The first misses and the second is deflected by Fee-Ree's spectral wings. It drops its longbow to the side and points its finger at Fee-Ree. All the other Eternals turn to look at her. Gnog says, "Uuuh, I think the ones around the corner are all looking at someone...?!" Fee-Ree says, "Yeah, they're looking at *me!*"

As one goes past Gnog to try and get to her, he takes an opportunity attack. He hits, for 18 damage, which isn't great but thanks to Sentinel, it's stopped. This is making it harder for the others to reach Fee-Ree as there Gnog and some Eternals are blocking the way.

Deni aims at the closest of the newly-arrived, uninjured Eternals. She hits, dealing 40 damage. That takes it down immediately.

Gnog's up; DM fiat; he can use his entire attack action to do a full roundhouse swing, recklessly, but he's potentially going to hit all four around him, but it's a flat roll. Attack is a dirty 30! Damage is very low though, only 16. Two that are hit were already injured and fall, DC 21 con save; both fail, so they fully go down. Two others are still up - and those two now attack back. Miss, hit from the first for 15->7 damage. Likewise for second one, for 10->5 damage.

Fee-Ree is in range of the three recent arrivals and fire-breaths them - 3d10 damage is a very high 29! *All three* take full damage; they're all still up, but very close to falling. Taz sees this and aims an eldritch blast, one each. He misses, hits one but it bounces up via armour, this another and it falls. He doesn't do anything with his bonus action for now.

The Captain opens its mouth, still saying nothing, points and draws its bow, firing twice again at Fee-Ree; but both miss. "Did it say something?!" she says, a little confused. It throws down the longbow, draws its Longsword and marches towards her. The other two Eternals now get right up into melee with Fee-Ree but don't have time to attack just yet.

Even though the Captain is still up, Deni wants to protect Fee-Ree. She drops her longbow, runs up to the nearest Elemental by Fee-Ree and stabs it with her dirk. She hits the one that Taz had missed - it still has its armour. Hits for 35; it falls. She spins around backwards behind Fee-Ree to reach the other one, with the armour gone thanks to Taz's attack and tries a backhand attack with her dagger; she manages to hit, dealing 1d4+1->2 damage. It falls.

Gnog takes two opp attacks from the Eternals nearby to run around get into the Captain's face. Both miss, and he swings recklessly twice at the Captain. Hits for low 16 and a bordering on statistically unlikely 15. Crap damage, but at least it's two hits. Of course, the two Eternal soldiers now come up to continue their attacks. The first hits for 8->4 and 12->6 damage; the second misses twice, fortunately for Gnog.

Fee-Ree can't clearly see the Captain even if she moves for a better view, so instead tries for a twinned firebolt, hitting each of the two Eternals that she can more clearly see by Gnog, each taking 15 damage; that's enough to take each of them down; both fail their con save and fall.

Taz steps right a bit to see the Captain more clearly and throws 3 blasts. He hits twice but the damage rolls are poor (d10, 3 and 3) for only 16 total.

Gnog sees that the gem in the Captain's chest is beginning to glow. A tendril of strange light is running down its arm to the sword. It attacks Gnog. Hits, for 1d10+2->12->6; it regains 6hp itself though; the gem lights up even more. No max HP effects (DC13 con save made). The second attack hits too, for 8->4 damage; it regains 4 too; again, Gnog makes the con save. Taz sees the glowing and shouts, "The glowing gem is draining life!".

The Captain starts to move towards Fee-Ree and Gnog uses his saved-up reaction for an opp attack; hitting for 31! (19+12); aiming straight for the gem; he deals 23 damage and this is enough to take the Captain down and it can't make a con save. It falls - permanently. The light from the gem starts to lift up and head towards New Prahv, but fizzles out.

Taz recoils in horror and says "That must be it! That's how he harvests the planet - it was sending the life to Bolas..."

So that's a sombre brief moment, before Gnog runs around asking for help as we collect everything we can, focusing on the gems but also any intact or broken armour for study, **then we *run* towards Sunhome.**

As we're running, Gnog shouts, "I don't how the hell the Boros are suriving those things, they're hard to hit and they hit hard". Fee-Ree responds, "I could help them! I can definitely help them! If you can get me to the wall in a defensible position, I know how to seriously damage large groups - they're vulnerable to my fire and when clustered together, I can get a lot of them!"

Gnog - group sending stone - "Ajani! Undead army, aim for gem centre chest; life drain if glowing, sends life force to Bolas!"

### 1000 XP shared equally.

Gnog also as we run shouts, "Taz! Message Boboremos! Let him know!" and Taz messages "Bolas and undead army attacking. Undead weakness - destroy gem at centre of chest. Beware poison attack of Viziers! What is the status of the Gruul?" (25) - the response arrives quickly - "We defend the precinct! Guild divisions meaningless now. **News of impending assault from the North; Domri leading.**" Fuck's sake. Should've messaged Boboremos before Ajani!

Before we reach Sunhome, Gnog notices that Sunhome itself has been quite badly damaged. It looks like Bolas didn't waste time in attacking here. Big sections of damaged walls and roof are evident, though the walls and roofs are mostly up. Big chunks of rock lie around outside, some looking like they bounced off and damaged neighbouring buildings. Rows of soldiers move in and out, carrying injured, and so-on.

Inside, the statue is still standing but most of the gardens are destroyed from the Bolas rock strikes. Some has been cleared but larger rocks have been taken advantage of to help prop up tents - the area has become a field hospital. Angels are patrolling; many are here also, though, injured. Scorch marks and extensive extra damage are evident on one particular side of the main fortress inside - Bolas seems to have focused there. We fear for Aurelia.

We try to head for Feather, because she might be OK and know more about the armour - and we have information on that too. We head inside, and it's relatively intact here - some fallen tiles, cracks visible in interior walls and so-on but generally intact. Soldiers acknowledge people - not much security - things seem to have been simplified: Undead? Enemy. Else not.

Up at the higher levels, damage is more evident; some walls have open-air holes in them. Up some stairs, Feather's office is quieter - maybe 1/5th of the people expected here. She's not in her office; as we approach someone hails us - "She's not there - she'll be down probably at Requisitions or Intensive Care to help."

We ask if anyone is in charge of the armour investigation; we're told that's what's happening in Requisitions. So we head there - it's been repurposed; there's not much left to requisition! It turns out that "Intensive Care" is a wing off here - store rooms reused. We try to find Feather; a medical officer tells us that Feather is busy with an officer but the research about armour is down a hallway and, given that's our main interest, we head there. A human and a loxodon are present in charge here. The Boros loxodon appears to be both researcher and medic. They're still studying and trying to figure out what it's about.

Loxodon **Quintorious** introduces himself. The human is **Freddy**. We explain about what we know about the gems; they might even be dangerous; they thought they were decorative. The decision is made to relocate the research away from the hospital area! They'll pack up then we'll return here soon and help them shift all the material. Meanwhile, we go to find Feather.

Feather is with an officer, holding their hand; the officer looks too far gone - Taz approaches the bed immediately, realises and backs away a little. Gnog can read his sadness. Taz arcana 19+13 -> 32! - he's seen this before; this human can't be saved, because their life force has been completely drained. "Max HP is zero or 1" kind of thing. They can't heal. We give them some space. Taz plays some soft music, which he hopes might be something of comfort. After a while Feather puts the hand down.

"Too many friends, fellows and comrades have we said farewell to today. But I fear this is only be beginning."

We learn that they're taking heavy losses; really need to find a way to stop more things coming through the gate. Reinforcements are urgently needed - Aurelia is indeed alive and travelling to D18 to fetch their own "weapon of last resort", never mind the Immortal Sun! - the **Second Parhelion**. But that'll take a day to get here and they're not sure they can last that long. The Verdani will help but Feather is pretty sure it's a one-way trip (and so are we). Other guild warriors aren't best at this kind of fight, but maybe e.g. shock troops from ?Simic might be led via underground tunnels to infiltrate and attack behind the wall.

We need to advance the Amonkhet trip ASAP. That partly depends on Vi, but we have no contact yet; more of her planeswalkers *are* arriving. We might try the safehouse key. We also need to get to the Simic, in that case. We figure P6 is on the way to Zonot 7, so we take a punt and activate the safehouse key hoping that we might find wherever that is, be able to get the Amonkhet plan underway, then onto Zonot Seven.

The key leads us to the Blistercoils, thankfully still intact; but there *are* signs of damage here. Not structural; it looks like some of the army made it this far and messed things up here. Evidence of bloodshed and battle. All non-essential functions of the district *have* been evacuated, it seems. "Skeleton crew" remaining, we assume. We travel through empty streets, until (D20 roll -> 6) we encounter an in-progress battle. A small group of Izzit are engaged with a patrol, trying to defend a building. We rush to assist.

Similar setup. A vizier, captain and about a dozen soldiers; these aren't jackal-headed though (whatever that means) - they look like ghouls or something. Gnog doesn't waste time. "Fee-Ree, Deni: Captain. Taz, with me: Vizier." He also shouts to the Izzit: "Try to destroy the gem in the centre of the chest!".

We summarise this battle for brevity using dice rolls. Taz uses 2d6 -> 4 points of spells and inspiration (1 inspiration point & L3 Mass Cure Wounds for the Izzit). Gnog takes 14->7, 9->4 three times over - 19 damage plus 16->8 poison damage (but con save is good). Fee-Ree blows 5 level's worth of spells and takes some damage too. All-in, we take down the bad guys.

We learn that the Izzit are doing research that seems to be drawing these creatures; it's research on the gems in their chest. We give them all the info we have. In return, they say that they know the capacity; they're similar to spell storing gems, storing magical energy, but don't respond to magic, and we tell them about the life force thing; they don't consider that to be a "real" quantifiable thing, but we have direct experience. They ask about how we can make one get life force - only the Captains can do that, we think - they want to capture one and use that to get a real example of a glowing gem. They predict a weapon, able to destroy the gems. They've fought four patrols so all they really want is some "muscle" to help protect here. They normally have a few hours between attacks.

**We say we'll try and get some defence to them, so that they can work on their plan.**

They also ask if there's any way we can get hold of **Mareka Destin** - that's Ral's assistant - or the original researchers?! - their plan and theory would benefit from equipment or research notes of the frequency amplifiers and resonance equipment used for the Disruptor.

**That's Gibo and Bebe, whatever notes we can get from Nivix if Jace tells us the lab's intact, and tell Mareka that she's guild leader now (!).**

We figure Vi's our best chance for defence. We get to the safehouse. It's a shack! A lean-to, on the back of a stone building. It's made of wood with a door that's almost as big as the wall of the shack into which it is set; 4ft square only. We try the key. Gnog, perception 19+8->27; he's not used all that many doors with locks and keys to be honest, but it doesn't "feel" right. The key goes in with no resistance, as if pushed into open space. Gnog pushes his hand at the door and it goes through. With the key hovering there, he tells the other three to go through, then ducks through himself.

It's the foyer of a beautiful mansion. It has a feeling of Magnificent Mansion, like we saw at the battle camp for the war; but this appears to be permanent, a solidified reality. Extraplanar. Gnog turns back and can't put his hand through the door, unless the key is "pretending to be in the lock".

"Well. Shit. How do we find anyone here?" but then we see some people. We ask for Vi, urgently - Kitchen! - they point. We turn left into a huge entertainer's kitchen. Four people sat around. Three look fucked up, the other looks fine, maybe? (they're made of air!), but it's the Cantina bar. The VIP room of a cosplay event. It's every kind of strange dress, typically quite extravagant. Different 'genres'! Vi is stood on a stool at the head of a table with huge maps; it's a makeshift war room. 

There's some convo and eventually some introductions. During that, Taz receives a contact. It's Mu Yanling! She's injured but alive and on the 3rd floor.

We mention the Immortal Sun. Doesn't go down well. Taz, insight 15. Vi's face darkens, as if she wishes we hadn't brought this up. Various discussions happen. Taz hears from Mu Yanling; she points out that the Immortal Sun must stay on the same plane as the creature it traps. Azor thought himself strong enough to resist any attempt by Bolas to take over and defeat him to deactivate the Immortal Sun; but in practice, **Bolas consumed all the energy on Amonkhet in the end, Azor wouldn't have been his match by then anyway, and *nobody* on Ravnica is - especially if he were left to consume the entire planet. He'd just deactivate it and leave.**

* We exchange details on the Izzit location for a Captain to be captured. Vi sends four Fixers onto that.
* Vi can't contact people that are arriving anew and they could be encountering Bolas directly, being very surprised. She can only spare the odd key or so per group; we give her details of our hiding location in P4 which she will try to use as a rendezvous point, though getting that location out into the ether will be tricky.
* She assigns the 'air' Fixer to Bulwark P4 defence, to gather more forces.
* She will look into people that know about Amonkhet to try and get the ball rolling on the infiltration plan. She does know someone that she thinks is still there... But we'd be served better if we were given an introduction by one of the members of the Gate Watch. She thinks Gideon is still there, waiting, out of despair.

More thanks, more reassurances, more support. We head up to Mu Yanling.

She's injured and lying in bed but otherwise OK. Looks like she was badly fucked up in that initial skirmish with Bolas. We ask about the breath weapon. It's akin to black dragon, but isn't; it's necrotic. Resistance to necrotic damage and anti-life might give some measure of protection; radiant shielding did not (she tried it). Angels, celestials etc. are particularly susceptible.

We posit asking the Golgari. It's possible they might have some protection against necrotic energies since they deal in them. The devkarin and liches of the royal family especially.

She does recognise the spells Bolas used in combat and we learn about them from us. It might come in handy in battle. Meteor Shower, Ice Storm, Prismatic Ray; "Power Words", highly controversial spells. Gnog asks about the gem floating between his horns. When she asks for her satchel and reaches to take it, we see a lot of scarring on one side of her - pock-marked, almost like acid burns - but healing isn't possible for that; it's necrotic and just takes time. Before she gets to the gem, we're told that Bolas in particular can assault the mind directly; one of his attacks tries to **permanently** reduce mental statistics. Gnog double-checks that. **It's permanent.** "He consumes one's spark".

On the gem - she checks notes - it's his "symbol of greatest offence", a rude "fuck you" to the cosmos! It's a soul and spark of his twin Ugin, his equal and withstood and opposed him for tens of millennia. Through very long lasting trickery and schemes, Bolas bested him, reduced his very essence down into this opal - "The Eye Of Ugin" - which he now proudly wears on his "crown" to show everyone what happens to those would dare stand in his way. He harnesses that power. Ugin was in opposition as a good being - "two sides of the same egg!" - his precise opposite, his balance. The problem was that Ugin had limits, things he wouldn't do. Bolas had no such limits.

**"There is a rumour... Out in the astral sea... That Ugin is not *entirely* gone. But it is a fleeting rumour, that I have only heard whispered a handful of times. I do not know the truth of it, or where one might even find this Ugin; but it is said that Ugin is being hidden by Sardior himself."**

Perhaps all roads once again lead to the Ruby Palace.

We bid farewell and head out, trying to reach the Simic. As soon we're out of the door, Gnog turns to the party.

"You have to go. The three of you. Get Arxcis, get to the Navigator and get the hell out of here. Fly a direct course away from P1. And don't stop."

There is the inevitable discussion; the short answer is "no". But Gnog had to give them an 'out'. Bolas is darker than we expected. Taz (history 15) remembers something about the planar bridge; a permanent physical connection; the Immortal Sun might not close it. **So why not activate the Immortal Sun immediately?** perhaps Bolas is **waiting for other living creatures to come through - e.g. Tesseret?**

There's way down to Zonot Seven needs us to get near to the water. We try the library, thinking we could use the passageways; also speak to the Dimir. But the library is empty! Nobody at all. No Dimir. Nobody. So instead we make our way around to the tourist trap we were in before, where we got into the submersible. It'd be easier than swimming to have *some* kind of vehicle that can move us quickly underwater. But there's nobody there either.

Deni starts to set up for her underwater breathing spell - we'll just have to swim for it! But we'd ruin our kit, we realise - the bag of holding might flood and so-on. We search for a submarine. Taz, investigation 18+5 lucky roll -> 23; he finds the bay where they're kept, remembering our prior journey and investigating around in that area. There are three "parked" in a dock. Taz investigation 11+5; he finds levers that let it lower down. Taz finds a nearby hat stand (!) and uses Animating Performance, so it can pull the lever for us. He doesn't need to breathe, so boards the sub and checks the controls. Deni helps; adv. investigation with BFS total 20. He figures out the controls and gets us to board. Deni casts Water Breathing, finally, for safety - on the three of the party.

When we're settled, he says "where to?"

We'll fly past the "tourist hotel" and see what's up there, but otherwise proceed deep into the place where we met the diva; it had "real" Simic there and is all we know. We can investigate from that.

The hat stand pulls the lever and we descend to the water's surface. Taz releases clamps and practices a bit with the controls. He's initially quite worried at being submerged but there seem to be no issues. He commences the descent, and the surface world lights above start to dim. Gnog asks Taz to make best possible speed - no tourist pace today! - past that strange "underwater hotel", so we can at least see if it's occupied on the way past. As we descend we're on constant look-out for anyone who might be a Simic contact.

Early on, only 150-200ft down, we immediately see beings around, not just creatures. They seem unsurprised to see us. Eventually Taz slows and stops near one and hails them, calls them over. He asks - should they not be in shelter? They seem unconcerned. Confused, even at the question. The *surface* is under attack. This, they know. They feel safe under the water! They've all retreated here. Taz asks for Zegana. **"Oh! You want Prime Speaker Zegana?!"** We are advised to look for Zemec, Taz politely asks for location - persuasion 24 - and after a moment's hesitation when they almost look like they'll say "no", they agree to guide us. Taz follows in the submarine.

We descend deep into the Zonot, reaching and descending below the layer where the underwater lights become the dominant light source. Several underground rivers empty here, and we're taken down one specific passage. Taz is keeping a close eye on the course and noting any landmarks that he can. We end up in large underground chambers, which we assume don't reach the surface but they're certainly big. One leads to another, to another... Eventually we emerge into what looks like a sea, fully submerged; this isn't like the Zonot or the chambers, confined. We can't see edges anymore. It just looks like an endless expanse of water, without boundaries.

It isn't featureless - there are creatures of all sizes. We follow our guide past what strange floating jellyfish-like structures, free-floating, that softly glow, sometimes with lights that seem to blink in sequence around the circumference; they look like a reasonably big building in size, perhaps 3 stories if they were on the surface. Seem to be a combination of constructed structure and biology - such as carvings of bone, but long kelp-like tendrils and so-on. Their forms are varied, including tall, narrow towers 80-90ft fall. **It's extraordinary.**

We start to see what looks like, perhaps, an underwater volcano? Growing on top is a *huge* structure; again it has a very jellyfish like feel, but layer upon layer of ovoid constructs. Growing off the side are things that look almost like huge mushrooms, but these, too, are buildings - well, structures of some sort, either built or grown.

We approach what seems to be a main structure, the largest. It has attached, floating, flexible arms of some sort, that end in small pods that seem partly glass - translucent - some bony structure; small pod-like rooms, perhaps, with these strange tube corridors. We're directed towards one and head that way, Taz thanking our guide as we head away. We aren't sure how to get in! The pod is maybe 3 times larger than the submarine. There's something inside, encased within this strange gel and bone sac. Taz looks underneath, but there is no opening below; it is fully encased. The membrane, up close, seems to have faint veins. Like a thin leaf.

Taz, nature 17, trying to investigate. The membrane seems to be living. There seem to be healing scars in places, faint. Taz very slowly aims for a longer horizontal scar, and gently nudges the nose into the membrane, as carefully as he can. The membrane parts and starts to envelop the submarine. He pushes forward, seeing the veins pulsing with energy, that seems to be causing the membrane to knit together. Taz isn't sure whether to leave the sub half in and out, or push forward and have it fall to the chamber base. In practice, it just sort of happens - we slide in and find the submarine is slotting into a coral platform. It "just works" and he completes this strange docking.

Taz turns to us. "I think this is it!" - Taz turns to wave at the Simic who guided us, who we can see blurily through the membrane waving back.

Strange bony plates slide into place in front of the submarine, forming a sort of walkway to the pod centre. At the side of the pod, a wall draws back and we can see the strange tube corridor. It's almost like a spine that you would walk along - it should be gory, but it isn't somehow!

Gnog is almost entranced by this. It's nothing like he's ever seen before, or even imagined. He disembarks and helps Taz off the bow. Bioluminescence seems to gather near where we are, lighting around our location, dimmer where we are not. It's like being followed by drift globes. The whole party follows the strange connecting 'corridor'. It has a flexibility, a little unsettling, like being on a single rope bridge. We get to the end and reach the first of a series of larger, well, rooms? It has a kind of foyer feel? Gnog can't figure out if it's a living thing - the largest central "blob" (mochi!) had smaller ones around, then more and more beyond, each smaller; fractal. In the absence of any other information or instruction we keep heading for the larger section. It's easy enough to judge direction here.

The structure stability increases - that is, the water-influenced movement decreases - as we proceed deeper in. There are more bony structures, clamshell-like grooves, buttress style things in places; they arch up and back in, as if being inside a sea urchin skeleton. We encounter our first Simic here; two are walking towards us from a larger hallway. They're dressed in form-fitting, slightly iridescent, fish-scale like clothing a decorative frill behind the neck. We saw similar on Speaker Zegana at the guild meeting. One has a second pair of eyes towards the top of their head and both have gills. The one with extra eyes carries a staff - "Welcome to Zemec; curious, we weren't expecting visitors, but you don't look like you mean us harm. You do look you're in a hurry!"

Gnog explains that we're here because the surface is under attack and we're hoping for assistance. He asks our names! Oops. Apologies. Gnog introduces the party. We recognise this first person as male now; behind, the other one, is female but *heavily* modified. She doesn't seem to have *any* eyes now we see her close. She holds a small globe that seems to be made of water; she holds it up; Taz Arcana 20(!)+13. Arcane Eye spell. So he says, "Cool! An arcane eye! I've not seen one before!"

A misty, blurry vision of Speaker Zegana appears. The female says, "The Prime Speaker has identified them as those she has deemed safe. She expects their arrival. They are to be treated with respect. Please come with us if you may."

Gnog says, "The honour is ours" and we follow.

We follow up into an even bigger section but then off to a side into a strange nodule, connected to a tube with a strange gel below; the gel solidifies as we approach; they climb on and we follow on this spongey kind of surface, and this then moves of its own accord. It's like a squishy Balthor's lift, but moving (sort-of) horizontally (in this strange, no-straight-lines place).

Fairly quickly we reach some kind of central nexus, a repository of travel. Lots of people here that all seem to be going places and know where they're going. Nobody lingers. Imagine the diagram of an atom with layers and orbits.

We've seen quite a few things that look like laboratories / research centres along the way. We've also seen a lot of strange, liquid-filled, egg-sack like constructs with things growing (or being modified?) within. That's pretty weird.

Seeing this, Gnog has a heart-stopping moment. The Selesnyans. When the IPB fired, they had deaths in the nurseries due to the laylines losing some power. But the gate *destroyed* the laylines. The Selesnyans never said a thing as they helped Ravnicans down to the caves - but surely, **every nursery, everywhere, must have died, all at once**. Overhearing this, one of the Simic escorts tries to comfort us - "That is true. But they do know, that nature finds a way; life restablishes; after the flood, the tidal wave, the currents destroy; but they also bring nourishment and new life, an upwelling".

Gnog agrees but it's hard to accept. A cycle of life, says the guide. But Bolas seeks to end that? Yes, agrees the Simic. An affront to life. They'll resist him to their very last...

"Cell", says a voice from a chamber to one side. It's Speaker Zegana.

"Yes. We know this, which is why we backed your play. We have known this was coming... The world told us; there are creatures with long memories who can see the patterns - the portents and the signs. They are creatures who can see into the past and the future at the same time. Do you know about precognition?"

A discussion occurs. Zegana believes this is unique to this world. We agree; Bolas lacked it; but now he has the Azorius. They have "usurped" the power of precognition, she says; that belongs to the original creatures of the planet; the megafauna. The Speaker says the Simic are doing their part to keep the spell intact; Deni notes this is spoken with pain and enquires. "The life force required to maintain the spell is -" says the male Simic "guide" then catches himself; but Zegana gives him a look of "it's OK" and finishes - "- the magic required is being taken from our growth chambers."

"Ah. So Ravnica knows you a debt it wouldn't recognise. You sacrifice as the Selesnyans did, only they had no choice; you do so willingly" says Gnog.

"The Selesnyans know it; there is a finite resource, this magic, this energy that flows through the laylines. It has to be recycled, which is why the Golgari play such an important role."

Gnog points out that Bolas isn't recycling anything! "Yes", says the speaker; "A parasite. Intending to drain every living thing... I don't understand why he waits..."

Gnog says, "wait, what?" and she repeats the "wait" but he winds her back "every living thing".

**Gnog goes pale... "I've made an appalling mistake." He turns to his party. "The spark. This was in our faces the whole time, it wasn't even hidden. He wants the spark. Planewalking. That's the spark. And I told Vi to activate the beacon - some of the multiverse's most powerful planewalkers are here. And Vi said it - they're still arriving - that's what they're waiting for! He's going to activate the sun! He's going to activate the sun and trap them!"**

"What would you have us do?"

Gnog discusses the Boros; lets slip the 2nd Parhelion, which she's horrified at; he mentions the Guardian Project. Taz insight 30 - something's gone wrong; there's some "should we tell them" thing in the air. Taz says, "Or the - forgive me, I only heard it once? - is it, Kraj?" - and there is relief at this.

"Yes", says Zegana. "The Guardian Project was... Stage one. It was our learning. **The Kraj** are another thing altogether! You do not have much time. So perhaps it will be easiest to show you."

We start to walk.

Gnog answers, "I know we ask a lot. And you are already sacrificing much. But it seems you are aware of the stakes."

"We've always had an insurance policy of sorts" (and we're being led down, now, deep into the volcano, onto some kind of observation project). "The Kraj Project..." - and we see an amazing light display, a network of strings of light. It's perhaps what Gnog might have pictured in his mind as the thing that holds the megafauna in place. This blanket of strings of light covers *massive* creatures, of shapes and forms that have familiar components but are very unfamiliar in totality. The closest one to us Gnog estimates maybe 70-100ft tall. Kaiju. The seem to sleep, in cocoons, as if young.

Zagana says, "This is our legacy. The legacy of a civil war that was averted. A civil war between the Holdfasts and the Upwelling. These were the warriors and the guardians that we never needed to activate. The project *has* been shut down, but we did not kill our children - our creations... **We call them The Krasis**. They are our tribute to the original inhabitants of this planet. It would take us millennia more to come close to the real thing, but as you can see, these are no meek children! It will take us some time and effort to awaken them; we will need to teach them in their slumber, before we do so; we don't control them - they are their own beings. We can merely reason with them."

Gnog is forced to discuss tactics. They'd swim out of the Zonot. They'll cause damage where they travel simply due to size. They'll need to head South - we cannot risk damage to the Blistercoils - we'll try to ride the line. Out of the Eastern corner of Zonot Seven, riding the line between Blistercoils and Smelting Quarter. Damage to edges of both, but a direct line to Nivix and the Bulwark. An alternative is suggested - they can climb walls. Climb them *well* - climb out of Zonot Seven, underneath the Souther Towers, to the wall below Foundry Street - Deadbridge Chasm - keep on the wall, work around to Kamen Fortress and directly into battle.

We agree on that.

Gnog apologetically asks - how long? The Boros need something to aim for. The Speaker will direct all their efforts to the Dreaming - the teaching of these sleeping Krasis. Imbue them with principles and an understanding of the situation. Calm them and ready them. It will take many hours - but hours, not days.

We hear that the creatures below, sleeping, the megafauna, saw us; the Simic saw us in the Dreaming. Zegana says that she was always the one we needed to convince the *least* because of this. The megafauna saw us as the fire.

She will take us back to the surface. "You're not squeamish, are you?!" - nah! - "Do you trust me?" - yeah! - and we're taken to a neighbouring room. Strange fleshy wall. A slit in the middle. Kind of - well - to be blunt it looks like an anus. "Just - Just close your eyes and push through" says Zegana. Deni goes "Well, fine...!" and pushes through. Fee-Ree next, then Taz. Gnog remains, turns and says, "Sincerely, thank you." - Zegana presses a pearl into his hand - "if you keep this on you and you focus on me, I will be able to see through it. I can't speak to you, but I will be able to look."

And Gnog goes through the anus.

He realises why she checked if we're squeamish. It's not a portal. We push through a noticeable depth of fleshy tube, squishy and cloying, somewhat slimy. He has his eyes closed; eventually after 15-30ft he emerges. He has to wipe mucus off his face and sees Deni looking very unimpressed. We're all covered in slime. "I think I just found my least favourite portal!" says Deni. "That is *disgusting*! There is surely no reason for them to design it that way!"

"Well I have a way to dry out - we need to run flat-out to the safehouse!" So we run, and we enter, still a bit sticky and obviously slimy and beaten up from battle. Gnog looks into the kitchen - lots of funny looks - leaving a trail of slime; an unseen servant, we assume, is responsible for cloths appearing behind us clearing up!

Vi is in the kitchen, head in arms, asleep. Gnog curses softly, but has to wake her. "What time is it?" "Not many hours since we left you, sorry..."

Gnog asks for privacy but Vi says we should have no secrets. Gnog explains. Vi is horrified. She runs out and fetches a box. The beacon. There is a *tense* discussion. Gnog ends up using Niv as a reason for letting more through. We were brought here without choice; why not more? He catches himself; and realises, that's not a good reason. Vi presses the button - the beacon shuts down. She runs off to contact the we-are-told-4-dozen-ish Fixers who've come through already and tell them, so they're properly informed. Fee-Ree and Gnog have a heart-to-heart; this is a difficult decision and may be wrong, but we are **not** losing ourselves (it would've been great to have caught the transcript of quite beautiful RP, but it would've completely killed the flow). We are not going to become Niv. But we recognise his dilemma more now, his pain; he had nobody to whom to turn. What must he be thinking, now, injured in his demi-plane?

It's 2:30pm. We realise that if Vi tells her Fixers and *any* choose to leave, Bolas will probably activate the Immortal Sun and escalate. We have little time. So, forget Dovan and New Prahv. Too late.

* Precinct 4 - try to find Ajani - send him to the Gruul
* Find Mareka, Gibo, Bebe; paperwork, if we can, via Jace? - and get that to Blistercoils
* Amonkeht.

We make our way to the last place we saw Ajani. The buildings are easy to find. Field clinics are set up; it's very hot and sunny, so makeshift tents are set up to provide shade. An awful smell - sweat, blood, death. This side of the wall and the other. A constant hot desert wind; it is blowing from the gate. It increases the sense of helplessness and oppression.

Taz considers using the Mizzium Apparatus to help with Motivational Speech - but there's no lack of spirit here. It's a war of attrition.

We have to let it wash over us. There's nothing we can do. We expedite finding Ajani. A flash, bright radiant light is seen a distance away along the wall. We hear a familiar voice - "BACK YOU FOUL BEASTS OF UNDEATH! ARMIES WITH NO SOUL AND NO HONOUR!" and we run towards it. "Turn Undead" - a big spell, he surely doesn't have too many of those! - a wave of righteous energy spreads out in a wide radius, knocking many undead back onto the ground. Gnog says to Fee-Ree - "If you want to feel a bit better, there's always time for fireballs!" "That's what I was thinking!" - and she points to the Horn Of Lennithon deep into the crowd and a fireball explodes forth, incinerating a chunk.

Gnog tells Ajani about the Gruul being led by Domri. "Oh! Yes! He's reached Precinct 3! He's not going for Skarrg at all!" - messages passed along the wall; we don't know if they are true or heresay. We don't know the veracity. Then someone is calling out "look! The Selesnyans! They have arrived!" - and we can start to see that Verdani are moving. "That's your cue", says Gnog to Ajani. The trees move to the P3/P2 Selesnyan defence line. Ajani grabs Gnog's wrist - "We have need of your strength!" - and Gnog has to choose. He asks Taz to blow a L3 spell for Jace to try and get what we need to Blistercoils.

Taz says he could try the telepathic bond - Nivix isn't *too* far. Taz tries thinking - "Izzit in Blistercoils at ("address") have plan to break Bolas's army's armour gems via Disruptor-based weapon. Require Gibo and Bebe for resonance specialism and Mareka as project; any paperwork in Ral's lab also appreciated; can you assist?"

Taz sense a Jace-like presence. "A little busy but I'll see what I can do! I'll let you know if there are problems. What are *you* doing?" Taz responds, "Thank you - we can all only do our best - Izzit weapon could be very important. We have Simic assistance, to help Boros in a few hours; we now go to help Ajani fight for the Gruul against Domri." "Sounds important. Good luck. Hold on there. Can confirm Niv Mizzet is alive." "Good to hear. Good luck to you too." Jace adds after a pause - "There's something you should see that I found in his laboratory. Talk later." Taz signs off with, "We'll sleep in the same place in the caverns tonight, so can reconvene there."

We are rushing off with Ajani - Taz is a bit behind and has to hurry to catch up, Gnog looking over his shoulder now and then to see if he's in town. Ajani is bounding. Occasionally he throws magic bolts off the wall, or swings his axe, or pushes away climbing Eternals - we follow his lead as best we can! - running on the wall all the while. We get a true sense of scale of the problem now. Shoulder-to-shoulder Boros soldiers are fighting, holding the line. Backing each other up. It's closer than Gnog's ever been to the front lines of a true army war than Gnog has been since before Amh. Clerics and generals try to focus them on the foreground. Don't look at the sea of undead. Gnog tries to shout things like, "Destroy the gems! We'll be moving to close the gate soon! Just hold the line!" - impressive but heartbreaking to see the bravery and the stubbornness. They'll hold the line, even though they know they *cannot* defeat the enemy.

Gnog can remember what it's like to be in that position. It feels like at least one lifetime ago.

Up ahead, the Selesnyan line is clearer. Conjured walls of thorns and stone. Tangled vines, gnarled tree trunks and more, trying to make an impassable mass; but the undead claw their way up all the same. There is an unsettling unhurried character to them - not crazed or rabid; methodical, disciplined.

That's even worse for Gnog - it is *very* strongly reminiscent of the Thayan army. Only he's not in control of them this time.

Underneath the armour, a lot of these creatures are mummified - covered in a strange shell that makes them look uniform, even though they probably aren't. We see more forms of undead now - large bull-like undead covered in armour, siege animals. Everything from the gate seems to be covered in this stuff. It starts to feel less like armour and more like a shell. They're - infused in it; *embalmed* in it. There are some giants here too, almost as big as Orzhovian giants, holding chains. A few look like priests. Strangely, they stand idle. They just do nothing. There's just the slow push at the edge, not seriously attacking, just causing pressure to wear down our forces.

It's all irrelevant, thinks Gnog. As soon as Bolas is minded, a single fly-by along the wall with his breath weapon would kill absolutely everyone in matter of a few seconds.

A stampede of Razeboars and other creatures come crashing in from the north. **Domri**. The Selesnyans *are* fighting on two sides here - they turn to defend. We're surrounded by battle to our right, Eternals slowly climb the wall to push defenders away. On the left, Domri's stampede. Ajani runs towards the stampede and we follow.

* We summarise this rather than play a battle turn by turn.

The force of the stampede as we approach is frightening. The animals aren't all angry, they're *crazed*. Some are scared. It's a true stampede; pure instinct. This has been built up as it comes from the North; creatures from the wastes whipped into a frenzy. Gnog sees Domri himself, riding a giant tuskboar; firey read eyes, spit coming from its mouth, looks rabid, or frenzied. Domri holds something less sophisticated than an axe; a massive hatchet perhaps, one in each hand. He is covered in streaks of red paint, hair pulled back, spreading out in wild dreadlocks behind him, white paint around his eyes - war paint. No armour; leather straps, bones, teeth, necklaces adorned with bones of (presumed) defeated enemies. Gnog sees it as theatre.

Domri is young; in his 30s at best. Insanely good shape; dark skin from the sun; he grew up in the wild, a poster boy for the Gruul.

He's a good 100ft or so away and not headed for us, but following the stampede. Hard to get to him since he's surrounded by those animals. Gnog hesitates for a fraction of a second; he's at half health, 100 out of 197... but Ajani can't get over the animals. Gnog can.

Gnog rages and *flies* directly at Domri when Domri reaches his nearest point.

**We use sheer force; trading hugely powerful blows, Domri not yielding. Gnog does everything he can, getting in good hits bit of course being hit hard back. It's a huge battle, the two of them; we get to a point where we're even wrestling, at one point our two weapons are locked; Ajani can't catch up as we're all being carried by the stampede, crashing against the Selesnyan defences; more crashing in behind; the Selesnyan line buckles and collapses.**

The stampede didn't attack the wall; it broke through the wall; Gnog is carried through and, suddenly, is surrounded by Eternals. The party realises; Deni is shouting, "Gnog, get out of there!" and Fee-Ree flies in, tries to grab Gnog; Gnog wisdom saving 18+9 -> 27; he *wants* to keep fighting, he *wants* to win, the rage is extreme, Gnog's at his limit; but his brain manages to take over; he pulls back, screaming in frustration. He's taken 64->32 of damage in the fight (DM-rolled), leaving him at 68 of 197.

**What is Domri up to?!**

A handful of Gruul and giants ride on the back of this crazed stampede, crashing deep into the Eternal army. The Selesnyans give up trying to stop them; this crazy stampede just crashes through, swiping at people as it goes, but largely doing nothing much. The Eternals can't even come back through due to the 'current' of bodies and Selesnyans quickly close ranks behind to keep the line shut. "Are they on our side? They even mowed down the Eternals!"

The stampede comes to a rest at the base of New Prahv, a trail of destruction carved through the Eternal army. Emerging out of the mass which we hadn't seen is a forest Greatworm. Domri stands on its neck, just behind the head. He raises a head in his hand. "**I am the leader of the clan now.**" - the throws down Nikya's head. He killed her and took the faction. We can hear clearly, somehow, at this distance, as he demands with bravado - yelling loudly at Nicol Bolas - "**I have done your bidding! I come for my payment, dragon! Give what you promised!**"

Bolas lifts off from the top of New Prahv. Everyone shudders at the sight. Bolas flies a tight circle around the nearest tower and lands with a loud thud in front of Domri. He rears up to his full height, which looks down on Domri despite Domri being astride a Greatworm. We all hear Bolas speak; it's in our heads again. Broadcast, intentionally we presume.

"You have done your part. Yes. But that head is meaningless to me. What is this show? Does it amuse you? Does it bring you joy or mirth? You want payment? What is it you think you were promised? What do you think you deserve?"

Domri responds "POWER! I want it all! I am the strongest. I have proven it! I have defeated the Chieftan of this clan. *I* wield the power to release the Razeboar! And I *will* do it. And I will set him against you, unless you pay me what I am due. I command the masters of this world. Haha!".

Gnog just feels a terrible sadness.

Bolas looks down. "You will be paid what you are due in time."

"I want it now! No more waiting, no more lies, no more delays, *dragon*! I don't play your games. You come to *my* world and you toy - you toy with us? How dare you!"

Bolas is calm. Clearly he is waiting for something, even now. Nearby, Gnog sees all the Eternals that had been flattened by the stampede revive; almost as if one; they begin to stand. Near the statue of Agros Kos a swirl of purple and black energy starts to appear and Ajani, next to Gnog stiffens visible. Gnog looks at him - and sees horror and *fear* and **despair**. Ajani just says, "No.. No..."

The swirl grows. A cape, a cloak, a headdress; the shadows take form; a beautiful woman, as best Gnog can see at this distance; regal, amazing, high-collared, long-sleeved, intricate, ornate silver embroidery dress and bodice, wide flowing black and purple velvet skirt, gothic horror; a diadem on the head, an ornate crown of sorts with a veil but purple tattoos are visible on her face and her purple glowing eyes are clearly visible; black hair; Ajani whispers, "...**Liliana**."

She lifts her hand. A mist of purple flows out from her sleeve and as it does, all fallen undead in the area rise fully, including all those near near the wall, even those that Fee-Ree's fireball had taken out. They all rise. **She points at Ajani**. Every eternal does the same. They all point to him. A hint of purple, *her* magic, has spread out as mist as far as we can see, across the entire army. Gnog sees Ajani gripped with fear; wisdom saving for fear for the rest of us:

* Gnog with luck point dirty 20
* Taz 24, tries to snap Ajani out of it with BFS persuasion still only 22 (low roll)

Ajani repeats, "It's... It's Liliana; wait, no... Bolas..." then he yells out, "Liliana! What has he done to you?!" and somehow, despite the distance, she hears; she responds, and it's just a loud whisper yet we all hear, "Done to me?! You mean what he has *given* me. He has given me an army the size of a world! **Dread hoarde! Attack!**"

**The entire army turns and charges.**

It's slow motion for a moment, for Gnog. His sharp eyes give him a wide view, not just a long distance one. In the periphery, tired, battle-worn Boros have just seen all their kills reanimated and now charge - but he sees them gripping swords tighter, gritting teeth, leaning in, bracing. No hope, but no quarter given.

Time speeding up to normal now. The army in front starts to march; big creatures further away start to charge forward. He truly understands that now; he is one of them; and he finds that same reserve. Around the wall, captains, paladins, leaders, anyone with fire in their hearts instinctively rise to the challenge; "HOLD THE LINE!".

It's right there, gleaming in his heart, something he didn't know about before; not consciously. And suddenly he's not afraid anymore. And he's right there with them.

Unified. Across the whole line, spirits, impossibly, *rise*.

Leaping from the closest Verdani, distant, is Nissa, cloak billowing behind her. Ajani is calling upon the righteousness of his cause; (essentially casting Aid); Gnog's shouting; "AJANI! THIS IS WHERE WE RISE AND LEAD! PUSH EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE AND *FIGHT*! FIGHT WITH ME! FIGHT WITH *US*!".

Nissa casts down a wave of healing. It washes out visibly from her, touching the most injured on the wall. 3d6+5->19. Gnog is helped with it too; and Ajani, through Aid, has added 15 more, both HP and boosting max HP, not that the latter is likely to be hit any time soon given Gnog's sitting now at 102 of 212!

Roll for initiative:

* Deni 19
* Fee-Ree 16
* Gnog 12
* Taz 7

The front of the army crashes against the wall, their striding changing into a last minute charge and surprisingly athletic leap. We're at the Selesnyan line still, after the stampede, and see that they climb up the roots, spikes and thorns, crashing through it all and apparently being totally unharmed. One of the recognisable Eternal Captains is pointing; it's creepy since, as usual, there's no yelling or talking and just *communicate* somehow, acting in unison. The Captain pulls a longbow and fires at Ajani, hitting and there's some kind of force explosion, pushing Ajani away from us a distance (> 30ft). The other Eternals have now nearly reached the top of the wall and start to crest over. Five are close by.

Deni aims and fires, taking out the one she can see that is closest. It's an Arrow Of Walloping (!) which hits the Elemental, throwing it 20ft back, flying off the wall and crashing to the ground. It'll be back of course, but not for a little while. She notches another arrow.

Fee-Ree leans forward and throws a fireball right into the midst of the wave of creatures coming up. A few are taken down; it slows them a little. The place of those that crumple is quickly replaced by another five, meaning we'll have 9 over the wall soon (with one of the first five thrown back by Deni).

A new thing. Gnog perception only 11 doesn't see where it came from, but sees now a larger, but not Large (medium size technically) 6.5ft tall, very threatening looking, rising above the others with long chains attached to its forearms, whirling them around. A purple mist emanates out as they hit a couple of fallen Eternals on the ground, who are pulled up and forced back to their feet and brought back to the fray. This creature is re-raising the dead, but Gnog has no doubt that these could be weapons too.

Gnog assesses quickly. Anyone high level is a significant threat. Anyone *raising* fallen enemy is a critical threat. He rages, and flies down the 20-ish ft wall, charging at the chain bearer, attacking. With so many enemies imminently rising to potentially flank, and believing that survivability of the battle is almost certainly low at best, he attacks recklessly. Beside, battle tactics be damned; Fee-Ree as no shortage of unobscured wide area targets.

He swings and the rolls are bad - 4,3 for 16, missing the first time; then 6,6 for 18, just hitting and getting a decent damage roll of 23. It looks at Gnog and kind of growls - the first time he's ever heard these things make a noise. It's injured - but only mildly.

Gnog can see Ajani, once again trying to turn undead in the distance. *Nothing*. Something's changed and Gnog's pretty sure that Liliana is the something. A short distance away, Gnog sees the dark mist of the venemous Viziers; they're spreading their poison; maybe 10-15ft away, one on the left and one on the right with maybe 2-3 soldiers in the way of each. Suddenly the soldiers around Gnog turn from the wall and look at him instead... Gnog braces for it. The attacks come thick and fast. A hit, deflected by wings; the second misses. A miss, a hit for 11->5 + 3 poison; hit for 10->5 + 1, in the rest of the attacks, only one more hit, for 9->4 and 2 poison (all poision pre-halved).

Taz's turn. He's seen Gnog jump. And briefly, he feels guilty; because *now* he understands why Gnog couldn't promise to stop what happened at Amonkhet, but sees Gnog definitely following his promise to do everything he can. He tries a psychic lance at the chain bearer (L4, int. save DC 19). Despite advantage (magic resistance) it fails the save. It takes 25 damage and becomes incapacitated until Taz next acts. His pragmatism wins over his emotion and he looks to Ajani, who is in quite some danger; probably too far for bardic inspiration; so instead, he looks to Gnog and grants it to him instead. It's his last one.

The Captain has reached the wall and draws his bow once again, towards Fee-Ree this time - but both miss, surprisingly.

The first four Eternals are now in melee range with Taz, Deni and Fee-Ree. The Captain is close behind and the next set of five behind him.

Taz is attacked first; he's hit (forgetting to use the protective wings!) for 11 and 3->1 poison. The second attack misses. Fee-Ree dodges a first attack and uses a shield to deflect the second. A third Eternal misses Fee-Ree and Taz. One on Deni misses then hits; the uncannily dodges for a total of only 6 damage.

Deni drops her bow and pulls her dirk. She hits the Eternal for max 17+29 -> 46 damage; it's destroyed outright, its armour unable to save it.

Fee-Ree twins Shocking Grasp and hits both of the nearby Elementals that had attacked her and (for one of its two swings) Taz. 14 damage to each. She steps back, now that they can't react; sorcery points are used to cast L6 radiant Sunbeam, ploughing a 60ft long line of energy carving through the army ahead. 32 damage to each and every one in the line. That's enough to take *all* of them down. Both the first and second wave are taken out, but not the ones hidden below on the ground. The Captain avoids it.

Gnog sees it from the ground - perception 23 - almost synchronised, he sees a whole other company behind turn to look at Fee-Ree. He shouts a warning but doesn't know if she can hear. The chains guy - Taskmaster - in front of Gnog is stunned and Gnog uses this to his advantage to attack. He hits for 24 damage, then again, for 24 (via different numbers). 48's not bad for Gnog in one round! He's looking a bit more fucked up... Good. The first hit is done with Taz's last bardic inspiration, d10->7, leading to 7 thunder damage to Eternals immediately to Gnog's left and right; another four resist, along with the Task Master.

The Viziers around Gnog have seen this and throw four magic missiles at him - each. There's no hiding from them. 12 damage after halving. Gnog hears, strangely, changing in Elvish! Above him, suddenly, massive storm clouds start to swirl and gather. Lightning crackles then crashes down, right into the middle of a group of undead to Gnog's left. A few fall; only two are left near Gnog able to attack, doing so without advantage; the first hits for 6 damage after halving, the others miss.

Taz, perception 16; the Task Master near Gnog is quite injured but shaking off the psychic lance spell. Taz throws 3 eldritch blasts. Two hit, dealing 14 and 11 damage respectively. The Task Manager is taken down; he fails to utilise his armour to bounce back and collapses! As it does, Gnog (passive perception 18) notices that the purple lines that looked like a web of chains that had spread out from it are severed from those immediately around and the raised/healed - risen - undead, collapse back down as their connection is broken. The kernel of an idea forms in Gnog's head - incapacitate Liliana, and all the raised undead might fall. 

Gnog looks over to her - perception 20(!)+8. She's connected to a lot of undead, running her power through them as conduits. She's hovering; she's surrounded by a swirling mist of spirits - he recognises from long ago, at Castle Nareatar, Spirit Guardians. She's a puppet master! Take her out and they fall. But she's *clearly* very, very strong. The tattoos on her skin and face almost seem like they might be a source of power; they're connected somehow to the veil over her face. Is the veil important? An artefact of note? Is taking that enough? He shouts up, "If Liliana falls, the undead fall with her; taking that veil of hers *might* be enough?"

At this, emerging from behind the wall above, flying over the hoarde towards Liliana, Gnog sees a planeswalker. The one of air, from the kitchen in the safe house, in fact. It carries another planeswalker, who holds a huge spear and seems to be preparing to throw it. Liliana looks over and sees it coming; tendrils of her shadow energy whip out and in an instant the carried planeswalker screams out in pain, its arm and side of body withering, dropping the spear. It's a horrible sight. The air planeswalker aborts, swinging wide. Liliana follows them with her gaze.

The hoarde is pushing in again, climbing up the wall.

It's funny, thinks Gnog; you think you're making progress, but it's easy to forget that there are thousands more to replace them all.

Deni moves forward to stab once more. She takes one down and injures another.

Fee-Ree moves forward to see down the wall, throws the sunbeam down and across the battlefield, carving a swathe, but she's getting noticed.

Another set of Eternals are now emerging, surrounding Gnog, filling the gap that had been briefly created. He's lucky - only hit twice out of no less than ten different attacks! - and one of those is deflected by the spectral wings. 6 damage after halving.

Gnog's turn. He jumps up, flying up the wall back to his companions. Opportunity attacks all round - and he knows it - not so lucky; four of the five, this time, hit; he uses wings to deflect one - goes well with the rage flying thing! 15 damage after halving - and no poison from these, the Viziers having not yet had a chance to spread the poison to these new arrivals. He lands amongst his party; fumbling almost, he fetches the Selesnyan charm, from some time ago, from his pouch and activates it - Fee-Ree, Deni and Taz have temporary resistance to bludeoning, piercing and slashing damage until the end of his next turn. The Selesnyan wall actually extends a kind of strange temporary bark skin to them. He puts himself in front, on the wall edge, facing the oncoming Eternals, his party behind (Deni directly).

The Viziers were preparing to throw missiles at Deni and Fee-Ree; but he's in the way; so they target him instead. Fee-Ree blocks with a shield. The other four hit Gnog for 12->6 damage. Gnog's at 37. A front-line (with poison) Eternal makes its way up the wall and attacks Deni. Gnog's used his reaction so can't use Sentinel. Both hit Deni. She dodges one, and at least all the damage is halved too; only ends up taking 10 from the two attacks. Another runs forward to attack Fee-Ree, but runs directly into the sunbeam! It's incinerated. Gnog notes that this is surprising; they don't seem to be dumb or rash normally; so this looks like they're mindlessly, obediently attacking, regardless of danger.

Taz aims at the Captain and fires blasts again. Two hit, total 23 damage. He also throws L2 Healing Word at Gnog for a good roll of 12 healing, bringing Gnog up to a less perilous 49.

The Captain in response climbs the wall and tries a life drain attack on the first person it sees - Gnog. It misses (17), though; Gnog dodges; so it tries with its sword now; that bounces off Gnog's stoney skin (18). Eternals rise behind, flanking the Captain and two attack Gnog; miss, miss; hit, miss. Halved damage is total 9. Another attacks Taz, missing twice; a second attacks, which would hit once but Taz remembers this time to use his wings, *just* defeating that attack. The fifth of this wave comes up and does attack Taz too; it hits, but the bark skin halves damage to 5 and poison is halved to 1 as Taz is resistant.

Deni stabs one of Taz's attackers. She takes it down. She deals a whopping 1 damage (!) on the offhand attack to another. She shouts, "I need you to keep them off me! I can't get to the Viziers!" - seeing what's going on, Fee-Ree sweeps the sunbeam straight through the Captain and one behind; it's not an efficient use, more emotional, but at least it takes down the Captain.

Gnog's still got one Eternal on him, so attacks - recklessly - dodgy damage rolls; 13 and 16. It's injured but unfortunately not quite down.

Speaking of the Viziers, they once again shoot magic missiles - all 8 at Gnog. 24->12 damage.

Three more Eternals emerge behind the fallen Captain, filling the gap and moving to attack. The first three attacks hit. Gnog is very low - 28hp left - so is forced to use his fourth wings of five to deflect the first. The other two hit and he can't do anything about it. 9->4 + 1->0, 10->5 + 2->1. Gnog's at 18.

Taz sees Gnog is in real trouble and tries his best to heal him with *L5* cure wounds, but the roll is awful - 1,1,2,3,4 + 5 -> only 16 healing (out of a potential 45). Four more Eternals appear, blocking the view for Deni; she can't do much with her bow; she takes one down, again, but there are more and more appearing all the time. Fee-Ree takes out four with the Sunbeam; but **8 more** rise and attack.

Fee-Ree is hit for 11->5 and 13->6 damage. Another attacks Taz; one hit, but he deflects with wings. One more is within range and it attacks Taz too; one hit, 10->5 + 2->1. After this, two more Eternals appear, but aren't within range.

Gnog is surrounded, with 5 eternals in melee range. None are injured. One on the left threatens Taz; Gnog attacks, flanked by 2 of the 5 so foregoing recklessness given he has only 34hp. He does 16 and 26 damage; and that takes the Eternal down. Gnog has his back to the party still; he looks to the right to see the Boros line; he can see the same thing happening to us is, of course, happening all along the wall. Defenders are holding the ground but being overwhelmed by the endless sea of poison-empowered Eternals. The rear lines of the hoarde have also moved forward some distance - large size creatures, giants and horned bulls, making it through ranks towards the area not that far in front of us. Nobody's withdrawing. Gnog shouts to Ajani, "Ajani! It's been fun!" (and focuses on the pearl and Speaker Zegana). Gnog's temporary barkskin falls from his companions.

The viziers throw missiles again, two to Taz (6 damage), four to Gnog (12->6 damage) and two to Fee-Ree (who shields).

Eternals attack Gnog. Three attacks hit. Taz uses his reaction to use his wings to deflect for Gnog. Gnog deflects a second one. Deni deflects a third! We're desperate and it's a bid for time, in the tiny hope of some strange salvation.

Taz has an Eternal 10ft away and throws blasts. Only one hits, for 11 damage. Bonus action, L4 Healing Word for 14 to Gnog, taking him to 42.

Of course, there's another wave of Eternals; it crests either side of us, but is far enough back this time that Deni can this time drops the dirk, grabs the bow and aims, then takes down a Vizier. Poison mist falters on the Eternals in front of us, but some to the right, by the Boros, are still being assisted by the second Vizier. Fee-Ree wastes no time; she points the sunbeam at the other Vizier; one Eternal in front of her, the Vizier and one behind are taken down. Gnog is surprised to hear the Boros rally at this - vocalisations of an increase in morale; all these tiny wins, somehow, are keeping people up. The Selesnyans and Boros are by now intermingled, some having run to each other's wall areas, side by side, fighting together. Boros have taken shields to Selesnyans to push back; a Selesnyan cleric runs the other way, healing fallen Boros at their wall.

Something necrotic starts to damage part of the Selesnyan wall and it crumbles further as the druid holding it falls. Others step in to try and repair the patch. Just, *just* hanging on. It's not a victory, but it's not a defeat.

We're fast forwarding the battle to the one minute point. Gnog's rage falters and he feels the weight of the fatigue and injury. The Sunbeam falters. People behind Gnog encourage him to step away from the front; a Selesnyan Loxodon cleric wants him to step back; "let us bear the burden for a moment"; and Gnog's not going to argue with *that*. We sort of stagger back a little, as a cleric comes forward, pushing a wall of force that slams down the bramble wall, crushing the Eternal army trying to rise below; but magic missiles hit the cleric at the same time.

There's a strange, comforting feeling; a touch; Gnog almost jumps when he sees Nissa by his side, casting Cure Wounds. 23 healing. He's at 65. He uses the metallic dragon gift to d8+5 heal himself; but only rolls 2, so gets 5 healing. Fee-Ree does the same, rolling better; another 11. He's looking a bit less marginal! 81.

Rising up behind us (from "our side"), suddenly, we see a very large construct of some kind. Almost like a golem. It is climbing up over the wall, stomping onto the undead army. Stone and metal, gorilla-like. Looking closer, Gnog sees to his amazement that sitting in some kind of caged seat is a small goggled, slightly crazed-looking artificer planeswalker that Gnog hasn't seen before. Green and silver hair, a strange one-sided cape, pulling levers to apparently operate what seems to be a machine. Attacks against the golem seem to mostly just annoy it but no damage. The tide of battle there seems to shift a bit, as the Eternals seem to have no way to counter its attacks. In the wake, a small drake carrying a halfling, carrying a bow of light, throwing magical radiant arrows at targets. Another planeswalker.

For the first time, we see a small breach in the front of the oncoming army. The ad hoc assembly of fighters here have been developing strategies on the fly and targeting of Task Masters to break Lilian's control over small but important pockets is bearing fruit. As Gnog looks more closely, this sea of undead has small pockets burning away that aren't rising as fast as they were. Injured can be pulled away as replacements start to arrive and fill the gaps, taking over the front line. In a strange mix of astonishment and relief, Gnog feels a odd glimmer of hope; it's impossible, but somehow, perhaps this battle might have a different outcome than defeat.

We have a few brief, but vital minutes of rest. Ajani even runs past at one point, "Are you OK?! Hang in there!" - a paw on the shoulder - running off, still being glorious.

The DM fiat here is that in this brief moment, this short time is the equivalent of a true short rest for everyone. A minute of battle felt more like an hour, after all - mechanically, we're out of battle for 10 minutes and it's like the Cat Nap spell. Gnog blows a whopping 12 (of 16) hit die to end up at 211 of 212 with his temporarily raised max. Taz is full, Fee-Ree is full, Deni too. We're itching to get back into the fight - we return to the front line, actually enthusiastic for battle! We are (literally, in mechanics) inspired.

### Simic and big battle today XP: 4750 each - *LEVEL 17* (but Gnog *multiclass*) and Taz half way to 14

(We don't bump levels mid battle of course. That'll have to wait).

Initiative:

* Deni 17
* Taz 17
* Fee-Ree 14
* Gnog 9 (even with advantage, sigh)

We make our way back to the wall, following the ebb and flow of replacements to slot in at the front line. It looks like the nick of time; the front line by now is beleagured. The larger creatures have reached the front and are pummelling the Selesnyan wall in particular. The druids are starting to falter. One of the Verdani is under heavy attack. The Selesnyans are focusing on that, so we elect to defend the wall that they have been forced to leave exposed.

The formation has Fee-Ree, then Taz, then stood forward to attract front-line attacks as before Gnog, then Deni, keeping back as far as she can to try and maintain ranged attack ability better this time around.

(First round of combat). Arrayed in front of us - eight Eternal soldiers, making it up on the top of the wall. They pull weapons and get ready to attack, eyeing up us and other nearby defenders - picking a target. The closest looks like he's holding an attack to strike as soon as someone is in range, but the other seven are not quite that prepared. Deni sees this, so aims and fires at this lead creature. She hits (30!) 34 damage total; the creature falls.

Taz throws blasts at one of the creatures that looks likely (insight 19) to attack a squishy - hits twice for 19 total. He throws Gnog some bardic inspiration as it looks like Gnog might be surrounded by attackers pretty soon and could perhaps find it useful.

Two more creatures make it to the top of the wall - a now-familiar-looking Captain, who draws a sword; and levitating up, a venomous vizier, beginning to cast the poison spell. We were thinking we might be tackling those big guys, but for now, we're just back in the meat grinder.

Fee-Ree uses a different attack, something we've seen maybe just once or twice before - a breath weapon, but not fire. A ~15ft cone of repulsion pushes the enemies back (DC17 str, or 20ft push back and knocked prone). All soldiers, the Captain and the Vizier are all caught in the effect; on saving throws, she gets 4 of the 7 soldiers, who are pushed off the wall and fall; the Captain holds fast, but the Vizier is pushed back and "falls prone", in mid air. A strange sight. Then she quickens a spell; L7, Crown Of Stars. No wild magic surge.

On the edge of the wall, rising up, is another Eternal; but this one seems to be wearing robes and a scorpion-adorned circlet of some kind. Holds a golden staff. Its armour crystal looks different; bigger, a luminescence at the heart of it, not shining but there's light within. Taz, Arcana 18+13 -> 31; he feels an oppressive presence; a magic dampening field; Taz shouts, "That thing is try to suppress magic!". It looks around, then casts Slow; we feel it start to take effect, but Fee-Ree quickly reacts with Counterspell - a reaction + L4 (to be safe) blown.

As if that weren't enough, crashing over the top of the wall and ripping part of it out - two Eternals standing there actually fall backwards off it! - is a large minotaur-like, armoured creature, large bull horns (almost longhorn cow style) adorned with jewellery (well, that's just impractical!) - as a side note, Gnog thinks it's strange how the whole army look decorated as if in ceremonial dress, or burial; for their *own* burial? - nasty thought. The new arrival - a **Ravager** - has even larger crystal which also seems to have a bit of light inside it. It looks around and focuses on Fee-Ree. It pulls a massive greataxe, maybe 9ft long and looks set to attack!

Gnog shouts, "someone else deal with that fucking mage!" ("On it!" shouts Deni) and rages, and charges at the minotaur. Two swipes with Stormbringer, acting recklessly, but aiming for the gem. First hits for a very good 26, second for a high 22. The first hit connects with the gem directly; it's very strong, but looks like it was weakened; so he aims again and the 48 total damage is enough - the gem shatters. Gnog is confident that he has this creature's attention; although it seems uninjured, its gem is destroyed. The little light that was inside the gem floats up and away, in the direction of Bolas.

Gnog notes also that destroying the gem was usually enough to take down the creature before; but this one is unharmed. "Those lit-up gems are a lot tougher! Aim for those first! They're not injured until the gem's down". Perception 24 - as he's saying this he notes several Boros engaging with another Ravager further along the wall. They'd been attacking conventionally and it goes down, but the light in the gem flares - the ravager gets back up. Gnog "Spread the word! Destroy the gems first!"

Two of the Dreadhorde do a very nimble jump up - they have a beautiful shield and long, ornate spear each. If we live long enough, we'd make a fortune selling some of this kit back on Torril! Their armour is lighter, so they've very agile. They dash towards Gnog to attack. They have crystals, but plates of armour seem to be protecting it. The first - hit, miss, and a shield bash crit. Gnog takes 6->3 from the spear and 9->4 from the shield. DC14 Str save; no problem; he's not pushed. The second - miss, miss, miss.

Soliders pushed off by Fee-Ree's spell emerge again and head towards her. Gnog shouts, "Taz! Defend!" but as it happens, one attacks Deni first, hitting once; uncanny dodge; 6 damage. Taz is hit twice; the first would bounce off the protective wings but he holds that for now. Damage is 11 and 10.

Deni disengages and rolls back a short distance. She fires at the one attacking Taz; she hits for 43, taking it down. Taz shouts, "Thanks, but, mage!" and knowing there's a risk for dampening, he at least tries to attack the mage - L4 Psychic Lance. Intelligence saving throw. 21. He *just* makes it past the field. Int 19 save for the mage - brain versus brain! - and despite spell resistance, fails. 23 damage and incapacitated for a short while. That *had* to be at the mage not its gem. Incapacitated, it falls, its levitation failing. Taz shouts, "No gem damage, it'll be back!" - bardic inspiration to Fee-Ree, who is getting a lot of attention.

The Captain sees Taz's act and charges at him. Fortunately, both the longsword and life drain effects miss, deflected by shield and, to a degree, the small size that Taz presents as a target.

The Vizier gets back upright in the air and throws three magic missiles at Fee-Ree. 7 damage (no reaction left for Shield - used for Counterspell). Fee-Ree responds. She can't see the mage/arcanist anymore, but can see the Vizier. She releases a Star from the Crown. Hits! 4d12 radiant -> 22, on the low side; so for good measure she hits with a Firebolt, dealing an additional 18, which takes it down; its armour fails to recover it.

The arcanist is out of sight and doesn't act this turn (incapacitated). The Ravager next to Gnog certainly does; it swings, but its attention is still on Fee-Ree and has a d4 subtracted; so it hits. Gnog takes 25->12 damage. Now it tries to move towards Fee-Ree and Gnog uses Sentinel. He thinks he might miss so uses Taz's inspiration to attack for 19+10 -> hits; while it takes no thunder damage, two adjacent creatures take the full 10. Gnog does just 17 damage to the Ravager; not huge damage, but it's stopped. Not just that - the ravager's armour disintegrates and it collapses. Gnog goes, "uuuh, I swear I didn't hit it that hard!?" - the ones with gems that keep them from being harmed, end up very frail? "Definitely take out the gems first!"

Gnog realises that this is what Feather's team originally described for how the gems work - you need to take out the armour first, then take out the creature. The "unlit" gem creatures behaved differently we found, so there are at least two different kinds of magic here.

Gnog shouts, "I'll be back!" and fly-jumps off the wall, aiming at the arcanist that must be down here somewhere. Two opp attacks from the adjacent hoplites; one hits for 6->3. The mage is just 10ft below the wall, stunned, floating; the gem is protected by a small plate of armour, but it's accessible from the right angle, Gnog thinks; Atl 19 - he manages to fly and rotate, while kicking the body, so that the gem is more accessible and exposed. Gnog attacks it. First attack is a crit. 42 total (with improved brutal critical - 6d6 + 2d12 + 7). The gem shatters and a bright lance of light shoots out towards Bolas. Perception 16; as the light leaves, golden tracing edges on the Lazotep armour dulls; it looks drained somehow overall. He attacks the mage directly now. Hits with 18; the Lazotep shatters and he can see underneath a mummy, fully bound in bandages, embalmed like a priest, just for a moment the tiniest spark of light in the eyes snuff out.

He gets back up onto the wall, landing next to the Captain and shouts "Mage is down!". Gnog focuses on the Captain, readying himself for when the Captain tries to attack Fee-Ree.

The two hoplites, with Gnog out of the way, go for Taz. The first misses completely on all three attacks. The second hits (for 5), misses and would hit with the shield but Deni reacts with her own spectral wings to defend ("Thanks!" he shouts).

More Eternal soldiers are making it up on the wall, heading for Deni, Taz and and trying to go past Gnog. Taz: two attacks, one hits (for 9), Deni: four attacks, one hits (for 7); so Deni is once again forced to disengage, roll behind Fee-Ree and attacks a soldier, hitting for 12+32->44, so it goes down.

Taz is forced into melee, so draws the shortsword and attacks - he uses Hexblade's Curse, adds in Booming Blade and swings. Rolls 14, but gets max +4 on BFS so hits; but the damage rolls are really low, the 2d8 is only 4 and the 1d6+6 is minimum possible for 7, plus 5 for Hexblade.

The Captain attacks Fee-Ree and Gnog reacts with Sentinel. He hits, but rolls no less than 3 1s for damage - 10, minimum possible. A little frustrating all the same. The first attack of the Captain on Fee-Ree just misses anyway, the second hits and Gnog can't react to protect against that. It's a life drain attack too; she takes 5 damage, but resists life drain max HP effects; the Captain does heal a bit from his drain though.

Fee-Ree disengages, takes a couple of steps back and throws a Star at the Captain. She hits, dealing 25 radiant damage. It's badly injured but still up. Gnog has the Captain between him and Fee-Ree; two Hoplites, closest 5 in melee, other two far. One swing at the Captain; 19 damage. Gnog Athl check: 25. He positions himself so he can smash straight into the gem on the Captain; this is enough to take down the Captain and shatter the gem. He continues to swing around and the athletics check means gets to connect with the front of the hoplite (yells "Duck!" to Taz). CRIT! And decent damage roll, 46; the hoplite's gem is shattered, the armour shatters too, and the hoplite collapses (and this had Hexblade's Curse on it, so Taz heals for 7). Gnog shouts, "Now I *did* hit that one that hard" and he moves to get into melee with the other hoplite.

That hoplite now attacks Gnog with a spear, then Taz with a spear, then tries with the shield on Taz. First it attacks Gnog; it misses; just misses with the spear, misses with the shield. Gnog reacts with Sentinel, hitting the hoplite for 20 total. Athl check for the gem - nat 20! + 11 -> 31. It cracks but doesn't shatter.

The relentless onslaught of more soldiers continues. Four make it up onto the wall and attack. Gnog's kind of in front of the party again; he's a natural target to start with. Miss, just miss; miss, hit for 10->5; Gnog notes that these don't seem to be hitting quite as hard, and that vizier only had 3 magic missiles not 4. Another solider - miss, hit; 11->5 damage; the fourth goes for Taz and Gnog's blown his reaction. Miss, crit! Taz reacts with Silvery barbs; this forces a miss. Advantage Deni. She uses that right away, not needing to risk aiming & being unable to move - she goes for one of the uninjured soldiers. She destroys it entirely, then moves to behind Taz with bow drawn.

Taz is in melee with the cracked gem hoplite and attacks with booming blade, hitting (21) for a slightly better than last time 18. The gem shatters and the hoplite collapses. He throws bardic inspiration to Gnog, who's likely to end up in the middle of a bunch of Eternal soldiers again.

Fee-Ree breathes fire at the group of recent arrival Eternals. A bunch are burned.

Gnog: Perception 23. He notices a cry from the Selesnyan side. He looks over, One of the Ravagers has speared a druid, impaling him and lifting him off the ground; then flings him backwards into the army. As the body flies over, he sees Domri; Domri is raging, animals surrounding him; he's looking back at the wall, having sent his Stampede back to crash into it to support Bolas. There is glee in his eyes. Behind him, above New Prahv, a golden orb starts to flare with light. Gnog isn't sure when that appeared. It's hovering in between the three towers. It seems to be spinning. A field forming around it. Gnog shouts a warning to his party to draw their attention. Bolas flies up from behind the furthest tower, over the orb which is now glowing too brightly to look at directly and the gems on the larger creatures of the army change colour. They go from the dull bluish white glow to a dark orange/amber, almost in unison, sweeping out very quickly in a wave from the closest to New Prahv first.

Bolas lands behind Domri. Picks him up. We hear Domri shouting, as if enraged or confused; but then Bolas just crushes the body; Domri screams horribly. A strange dripping essence falls down Bolas' hand, it's not blood it's something else, then drawn into gems of the nearest of the Dreadhorde. The gems glow very bright at this, a bright, hot-looking orange. Domri is dropped, falling to the ground still in pain, apparently very injured but also - unpleasantly - still alive. We hear "No, what, no!" and he tries to pull magic to against Bolas; the stampede frenzy breaking as the control fails; but there seems to be no magic left. Bolas picks up one of the Dreadhorde soldiers with the now-bright gems and devours it! Bolas' eyes light up the same as the gem. **"Let the harvest begin!" he shouts.**

Bolas throws a spike of lightning. It arcs across the battlefield, hitting the planeswalker golem still in the battlefield; it shatters; the artificer holding his head and screaming, lighting and smoke blasting out of his body as he falls off the wrecked machine onto the ground. Bolas throws some kind of dark lance to the halfling planeswalker on the drake, both writing in agony as apparently they are "harvested" - the Dreadhorde around are absorbing energy as, horrifyingly, our stricken, fallen allies still live.

The air elemental is nearby. "Fuck this - we can't beat *that* - I'm not risking my life to fight *this* thing!" - and he tries to planeswalk away. It doesn't work. He looks confused and with a terrible, sinking feeling, Gnog knows what this is.

**The Immortal Sun is activated**.

Chaos breaks out amongst the planeswalker ranks. Some start throwing spells in desperation. Others try to pull people away - Ajani has to be restrained by Nissa and one other planeswalker, to stop him charging Bolas. "We have to retreat! We must retreat!" she shouts; some start to fly or run away. Bolas is scanning around, looking for planeswalkers to strike next. A fleeing Planeswalker nearby is caught in some strange bolt of shadow and is torn asunder. Gnog looks in horror to Fee-Ree and shouts, "Fee-Ree! Get down! Get back, off the wall! Take cover!"

**She reaches out and grabs Deni and Taz. Bolas is now looking at us. Gnog sees it, grabs onto Taz. Nissa sees it, is holding Ajani, grabs Gnog; Gnog sees sections of wall start to fall off to the Selesnyan side but then - WHOMP. Fee-Ree panics. Teleport.**

We are outside the safehouse. Chaos on the battlefield, of course. Gnog says, "We... We must go back; we must help them hold the line - Fee-Ree can help here, at the safehouse, but we have to get back there!" but the others argue - it's too late already. Deni is freaking out. Taz is relatively calm, but scared. Fee-Ree has panicked. "What have I done?!" she laments, but Gnog calms; apologises; "No, you're right, it was already too late, the wall was already falling, I'm wrong... It's just so hard to take, we were doing OK, but we knew this was coming... You saved us. Taz, warn the Kraul and alert Aurelia immediately please!"

Nissa's still catching her breath - "...wait...". Her eyes briefly turn white. Takes about 10 seconds. She looks to us; "They're retreated; the Selesnyans have retreated to Vitu Ghazi. The rest has fallen. Precinct 3 is mostly lost. The Precinct 4 wall holds."

Taz: Sending, L3 to one of the Kraul guides we had; and same to Aurelia. **"Precinct 3 wall fallen, Bolas harvest begins, P4 and beyond imminently unsafe, prepare to withdraw and regroup."**

Gnog sees movement coming from Zonot 7. Gnog looks closer. Perception 23. Large shadows, just off the edges. He chuckles, darkly. "Well, faster than we expected, even if perhaps a too late - the Simic creatures are moving." We head closer, towards the waterfall edges at the Blistercoil boundary. Six at least, really large creatures that we can see, scuttling almost along the walls. It's a strange sight as it appears to defy gravity without being a fly spell. They're headed for Kamen Fortress as arranged. We hope that they can help hold the P4 line a little longer - perhaps even until the Parehelion arrives.

Gnog turns to Nissa. "How can they last in Vitu Ghazi?" "If they've retreated, then that is the stronghold; the Verdani have been pulled back. They will not let the Sacred Tree fall."

The influx into P3 is making room for more undead from the gate. They'll be flooding in again. Gnog dives into the Safehouse, letting others in through the key door first. Other planeswalkers are arriving. Some are injured, in some cases badly. Inside it's a mess. A couple are very distressed - they've lost their powers. It's... Very, very bad.

Vi runs up, completely distraught. "You were right... You were right all along... I've - I've condemned them to death! W... Look... I know you're just as shocked - as soon as you're able - we need to meet upstairs in the main library, we need a plan!". Taz tries to help; "We must not assign blame. Prediction of Bolas' intellect and intent was impossible, even eluding the combined powers of Jace and Niv. Now we must plan. We will head up immediately. Steady yourself." Persuasion 21. It's enough to get attention. He also casts Mass Cure Wounds in the main area of injured planeswalkers; ratshit rolls again, just 14 but it's better than nothing.

In the library, Mu Yanling joins us. She doesn't know what's happened; overlapping voices clamour to answer. They're very focused on what Bolas did. She asks very specific questions in return, as if trying to correlate evidence. We pitch in as best we can, with the different gem behaviours and so-on.

**Then, in walks Jace!**

On his shoulder, he's helping a heavily injured Kaya to walk. Neither seem to be suffering the planeswalker power drain injures, though.

There's commotion and confusion about what's happened. Vi says, "Jace! You *have* to tell them!" so he steps forward and with Taz's help, gets everyone gathered around and quietened down.

He pulls out a huge scroll he'd fetched from Niv's library. Mu Yanling assists at times as she has a Satchel Of Holding with information too. Yes. The immortal sun can temporarily suppress any magic that pierces inter-planar barriers. Pocket dimensions within a plane appear to be unaffected - as we can see, from where we are! Teleports likewise, but portals to *other* planes are simply won't work. We ask about physical flight in a spelljamming hull; Mu Yanling is sure that this won't be affected as the Astral Sea barrier is crossed without use of magic. But there are no ships except ours, which would be vulnerable on ascent since it would be clearly visible from New Prahv.

Jace explains about something called the Elder Spell. "Almost a legend" says Mu Yanling. "We have old documents about this; the Elder Spell requires so many components that it hasn't been used - probably *can't* really be used..." so Jace asks for Mu to recite the components if she can remember, and say what it does.

* Very old magic, from another era, magic tracing back to the days of creation
* A form or a corruption of the kind of magic that created the Gods
* Pure, raw, magical essence is required - very rare in most planes - most planes don't contain enough to power the spell (so that's why Bolas is harvesting sparks in particular)
* It is possible to gather the spark through the lives of millions sacrificed - a few powerful beings, or a massive number of lesser beings
* The second component though is belief; it's not just harvesting; millions must believe you - reverence, love or fear, which means not Ravnica. The Dreadhorde don't count as they've had free will removed, they're not technically sentient anymore.
* But if it were possible, this spell would turn him into a God.
* So Bolas can harvest the spark of planeswalkers here, but can't harvest the people in that way because he'd never have the reverence he requires - he needs *believers* and after his attack here that'd never happen

The spark must be used during the spell. It can't just be consumed. Mu thinks that the gems are being stored in the crystals. Once broken, those are released. The army is a big battery.

Jace says, "So, we could mount a desperate defence of this planet to try and stop what's going on. We can't really risk the kind of assault that we would've liked with the planeswalkers anymore, so probably our most powerful tool has been turned against us. But we can defend against his army - but not an endless one. We need..."

"...yes, Amonkhet. Shut the gate." interrupts Gnog.

"But how are we gonna get there? We should've done this before!" says one planeswalker. "We were forming the plan" says Gnog; "but he was just too quick".

There's kerfuffle. Why talk about this plan? We can't travel. Gnog asks about travel time and there's more confusion... No ships! We remind them - we have one. It can take 5 people. Against Tesseret and the Bolas Gods on that side.

We also raise Ugin. Bolas might have not predicted this one thing, since he seems sure Ugin is dead. We ask Vi if the planeswalkers can work on that angle while we're gone. Mu Yanling steps forward.

We've blown all communication. Kaya can contact Lavaz - the Dimir will assist Jace and anyone who wants to help with the Immortal Sun problem. She agrees, sighs, and heads away to clean up a bit. But Nissa, Kaya and Ajani have all offered to go to Amonkhet. Kaya wants revenge on Tesseret. Nissa knows the plane. Ajani wants to get hold of Gideon - a personal reason.

Kaya's stealth is valuable. Nissa's knowledge is valuable. But as Fee-Ree told us; stay true to ourselves. The old Gatewatch has unresolved business. Ajani would come - but then we can't bring back Gideon; there's just no way to fit 6 on the Navigator.

The penny drops. The four of us must go. We fetch Gideon and bring him back.

Ajani draws his double-headed battleaxe. He asks Gnog for a weapon; Gnog gives him Stormbringer. His greataxe is less powerful and besides, he says, he's not parting with that, it means too much! But then - Ajani gives Gnog his axe and says, "This has never left my side."

"But we might not return. It might be a one-way trip.

"No. This has been in my pride and blessed by my Gods. It has been in our pride for centuries, passed down from warrior to warrior. So I *know* that you will return."

Gnog says, "You remind me strongly of someone very dear to me. I'll see you in a few days. With your axe, and with Gideon, and with another reason." - Gnog gives Ajani his greataxe in turn. "This isn't something necessarily to fight with, though it can be good against larger foes; but usually, Stormbringer is more powerful. I give this instead as a symbol of commitment."

**Gnog un-equips his greataxe for the first time since we ever started playing.**

Gnog has the **Axe of Heavenly Fire** - he examines it. "Huh. Attunement I think? I'll have to cheat on the greataxe!" - and after a minute or two more - "Hmm. You might have to fight me to get this back, y'know..." - Ajani laughs and thumps Gnog's shoulder (hard!). Gnog quietly says, "Seriously, though. You're quite something. And so is this weapon. I think I do fully understand what this means to you and I'll treat it accordingly." Ajani: "Well - this is the closest that you'll get to having me come with you. Gideon will trust the bearer of this axe completely."

Fortunately, Jace has a "picture" of Gideon! He conjures a minor illusion.

Kaya returns and Gnog breaks the bad news - for Reasons, just the four of us. The rest needed to defend Ravnica. We have to chance it alone. Ship too small. She's OK, kinda; at least no favouritism, nobody else taken instead of her.

"Promise me one thing, will you? Make sure that Tesseret does not go easily into the night. He has a lot to answer for."

Gnog answers, "Given his strength, I don't think *anyone* is going easy in that battle! But noted. And we'll you a souvenir."

One last thing - Jace; he did manage to find the two kids. Holed up in P6, in their mother's house. Quite a few goblins refused to go down to the tunnels and were mounting their own defence. (Gnog feels a strange sense of pride in that). Vi concurs! "Yep! Independent thinking lot, they are! They can look after themselves; a few tricks up their sleeves."

"Thanks Jace. Let's hope they can help build a defence against those gems."

If it does work, they'll need a "duck and cover" plan because it'll rapidly piss Bolas right off should we weaken that "battery" he wants for his spell. They're also concerned about Liliana and cutting of her power supply from both the gate and via Taskmasters is key.

Nissa offers one last word of warning. "Gideon refused to lift a weapon to Liliana. He stayed on Amonkhet because he believed he'd find a way of winning her back. It could go either way - he could come back with you because he hasn't given up on that - or not."

So that's it.

"See you soon, brother" says Ajani. "Make him pay" says Kaya. "We will hold the planet for as long as we can." says Nissa.

We head out. Just before we leave the building, Mu floats hurriedly down. "Here! Just in case!" - she hands us a scroll. "This is what I had with me, about Amonkhet. It might come in helpful." "Thank you! It will!"

As we cautiously walk, heading towards P4, looking out for defences and the state of the Boros soldiers. Krasis are now visible in the fight, which is an awesome sight. The Boros haven't given up. Holy crap. Gnog's never seen anything like it, in any army. "Taz, while you're attuning to the help, figure out an escape course to get us away from Bolas without being blasted out of the sky." It's sunset. We'll be taking off near dusk, which will help.

"Fee-Ree. Do you need to see Arxcis before we go?" "No... I... I will just tell him that I'll see him soon. We have to go. We cannot let that wall fall." Gnog just hugs, nods, says "...I'm sorry." and we hasten down into the tunnels that lead to the old "subway". We don't encounter Boboremos' Gruul; we don't know how he's doing and hope he's OK. We do encounter a ragtag group of 3 Eternals and mow them down.

At the ship, we have to clear some of debris - the planet's been pounded a bit - the ship is fine and Taz starts attuning; Gnog attunes to his sword. He looks around. Deni is shaken but holding on. She's busied herself with setting up and checking the ship. Fee-Ree is drained, tired, it's been a long fight for her. She's contemplative, trying to think what she's going to say to Arxcis on the stone so Gnog leaves her in peace. Gnog falls alongside Deni "faux checking". "Hang in there - we have a plan and a chance, and against *all reason* that wall stands today. We did not fall today. I *really* thought it was our last stand. Yet here we are."

Taz completes attunement and shouts, "...ah! Got it! We can fly."

Gnog understands more of Ajani now. Tyr, the God; like Helm, but a bit more glorious and gung-ho! Gnog wonders about Garren. What was their relationship anyway? Why did Garren's ascension hit him so hard? Ravnica is a confusing place.

Fee-Ree comes to the helm. She's sent her message. "Ready?" says Gnog; "Ready", she answers. She can attune to the helm when she needs to, so they can work shifts as usual. "No time like the present!" says Gnog. "Mr Tablabu - execute your escape course, please".

The wings whir up. He wobbles a bit as we exit the tunnel but gains confidence quickly. We pop out the hole in the cliff side. Looking back, Gnog sees the sun setting over a very different Ravnica and, close to District 10, fires and damage are easily visible; but quickly, as Taz follows his escape course skimming the Red Wastes, it doesn't look any different. Once comfortably far into the dark, Taz angles sharply up and climbs perpendicular to the surface. Up high, a lot of the planet can be seen; Bolas may well have us in sight now, but is surely too far to do anything. We know he can't fly beyond the planet and we're seconds away from the gravity envelope boundary. There are certainly fewer lights visible across the planet than he remembers seeing on the dark side previously; perhaps they really *did* all evacuate below, even if many outside District 10 are surely confused about the reasons.

We are close to the gravity envelope edge and the whole planet is in view. Gnog pulls out the spyglass and scans around, hoping against hope that maybe the moon with Ravnica Station might be in sight, rather than blocked by the planet. Perception 21. He finds a moon, and sees something, little glints of reflected light, specs in the dark, around it, clustered off to one side. Best guess? That's Ravnica Station, and there *are* ships assisting. He lets the others know.

We clear the gravity envelope. Taz calls, "hold on!" and guns the Navigator to maximum possible speed. We watch Ravnica suddenly dwindle, shrinking to a distant dot in the expanse of Guildspace - and us, speeding through, even smaller and more insignificant, a tiny ship with a tiny crew on a vast ocean, facing an uncertain future.

### Next big battle and assigning tasks: 3250 each, granted to Taz - 1625 each with 8125 to Taz

(END OF PART 19 - Part 20 next)
