# Gnog: Part 6

We are on our way to Ravnica, passing the Old Dominion, having just finished a battle with six Scavvers. We were in the fourth period.

Near the end of that period, we get signalled to stop with a crazy light display that shoots out over the bow of our ship. Taz halts us and comes on deck. A large Star Moth heads towards us, masked elves aboard. They hold long spears, almost javelins, with platinum and gold tips. They have ornate head-gear with a kind of gold filigree crest coming out from behind helmets which have a strange golden mirror effect on the front, hiding their faces. We assume they can see us just fine, even if we can't see them. They have impeccable, undamaged gold scale mail.

The Star Moth gets to within 50ft. Thaumaturgy is used to loudly shout: "SILVER NAVIGATOR. We have never encountered you before. Where have you come from?"

"New boat we purchased from the Rock Of Bral, after successful adventuring made us a fortune in Torril." "What are Torril people doing out here?!" "Exploring and looking for more fortune!" - Taz insight 18 - he notices that Deni hasn't cleaned up all of the Scavver carcasses off the deck of the ship, so it looks like we've been Scavver hunting - game fishing. So he shouts, "It's my first time, and look at the big game we caught! That big blue one especially!" - deception (adv.) 21. The elves respond, "Ugh, nasty business. At least *someone* is doing something about these creatures - they breed so prolifically, ugh. Hideous creatures. Well. Stick to your lanes! Where is your next port of call?" "Ravnica station" - we're pointed at a line that we need to follow to avoid entering "newly established Xaryxian space".

Off the fuck, and this is the first time Gnog has been very glad to be free of the company of elves. These are just trumped-up bullies.

Deni says, "That was very quick thinking" to Taz. "Thanks, it's good thing we're slow at cleaning!" - we figure we might as well keep up the ruse; get to Ravnica Station and find a place to sell them. They're all split open and gutted as it is... Gnog suddenly realises that for some reason he hadn't noticed the smell until now. Ah - no air. Ah - there's air at Ravnica. Oh. He warns everyone.

We fly on.



## DAY 18 (Riglan 55 - a little late in our offset here)

The watch periods are uneventful; Gnog gets a bit further in his book; by the end of the third period, Taz is flying and we reach our exit for Ravnica and Guildspace - a dark swirling portal, the colour of Wildspace, with a star at the centre, its light spilling out. Deni wakes Gnog as we're entering the fourth period anyway. This confirms for Gnog that all "stars" we see in the Astral Sea are all probably portals to other systems... That's a lot of systems.

We enter Guildspace. Con saves all round!

* Gnog: nat 20 -> 31
* Taz: nat 1 -> 2 (oh no!) - and he's piloting
* Fee-Ree: 23 
* Deni: 12

So we're all fine, but on entering Guildspace we hear a yelp from the helm and the ship starts to spin. Fee-Ree runs down to the helm and Taz is there looking very distressed, his magical plating lights flickering erratically. He was suddenly flooded with an awareness of all his biomechanical functions that he'd not even realised were suspended prior; as a construct he had assumed they'd continue normally, but not so - this is part of why he can use healing potions and suchlike. Fee-Ree swaps and stabilises the ship while Gnog sits with Taz until he feels better. Taz eventually comes down to read the now-active orrery and guide Fee-Ree on the start of fast travel in Wildspace towards Ravnica Station; navigation check: with built for success, he gets 17 and knows the correct path and approach for the dark side of the moon at Ravnica Station. The map indicates that the flight should take about 24 hours, so this Guildspace system is smaller than Torril's Realmspace where even the shortest path was about 36 hours.

It does, indeed, smell. We clean up the guts and use the water bottle of Deni's to wash things down, then Gnog figures out using borrowed rope how to string out the carcasses on the sides. We have the gutted four brown, the gutted blue and half of the other blue.



## DAY 19 (Riglan 56 - a little late in our offset here)

Taz sleeps, Fee-Ree flies, Gnog reads and gets a bit further, and Deni is on Watch.

We note that Ravnica's space - so-called Guildspace - is a little darker than Realmspace. The star is different; there aren't as many planets; the orrery shows only two, that we can easily see, both with two moons. There is less colour in the sky. It's more empty overall.

Period 2, Gnog's on watch. Perception 23. We drop to a slow speed briefly, Taz saying that there are asteroids nearby exerting an influence. He sees - and for a moment tries to fly there, but we're not in the Astral Sea anymore! - something glinting about 500ft from the ship. Something reflecting. He tries the spyglass. Still can't tell. Deni has a try. Looks like glass. Gnog asks Taz to fly a cautious approach, below full speed and ready to reverse course quickly if need be.

Closer, it looks like crystalline shards. They slowly rotate, glinting in the sunlight. There's a slight red look. Hmm. Same as our shards? We get closer. Much of the material is just dust, but some pieces are larger. They're red crystals. They do look similar; did something happen here, too? We could try grazing the cloud with the bubble, perhaps wrapping cloth over our mouths to avoid breathing in the dust; or get just below and Gnog could try boost Deni, throwing her upwards, then she can land on deck? "If only we had a net", says Deni; a few seconds later, a net shimmers into existence on the deck. "Will that do?" shouts Taz from down below. "Where did you find that?" "I made it! But it only lasts a few hours."

So, we get close, but not so close as to grazing the air bubble with the cloud. The net counts as a dexterity marshal weapon, but to be thrown in requires strength. Gnog -> Strength check plus proficiency bonus; 21. It catches a few bigger pieces and we reel them in. We have four big chunks. Taz backs the ship away and once clear of the asteroid influence resumes full speed flight to Ravnica Station. Gnog puts the shards in his component pouch, to keep them separate from Fee-Ree's shards.

Period 3 - Fee-Ree goes on watch with Deni assisting, Gnog sleeps, Taz flies. It's an unevenful period with no interruptions, so we are able to proceed at full speed.

Period 4 - at the switch over of watch we drop suddenly down to normal speed. "We're here!" shouts up Taz, excitedly. There is a moon nearby and a station - a town, of sorts - built onto the side facing away from the planet. A handful of ships are approaching. It is not as busy-looking as the Rock of Bral.

Taz doesn't know where he's supposed to down there; it seems confusing. Do we just approach and land? Gnog uses the spyglass - he sees a small pod of kindori, too - he watches as another ship appears, slowing rapidly; it moves wide around the kindori, which must have made it slow down early; but this means we can watch. Deni relays their actions and Taz attempts to do similar things with our craft. Gnog sees balls of light floating out in Wildspace that remind of driftglobes, but a soft blue; he suggests to Deni that they might light the way, like the lights on the fey paths we followed to Fee-Ree's hollow. We follow them like a path. We are behind but not too close to the ship we are mimicking. It reaches a sort of quarry of some kind a short distance away from the buildings, ducking in and landing in a crater. Ships just seem to park up anywhere pretty much; a few seem properly docked, but they have keels and we can stand on land, so Gnog tells Taz to pick his favourite spot.

He sets us down. Gnog turns to Deni - "Wow. We made it!"

A small shape is hurrying our way along the ground. In fact, two, one in front of another. They look like they're maybe engineers - small, with goggles, helmet and work gloves - goblins! They wave; we wave back. They stand and wait. Gnog calls down - "We're new, we don't know what we're meant to do!" "You're all good. We just need to..." - they look for the ship name and write it down. They beckon us down. So we disembark - Gnog cuts the Scavvers free. Taz turns to the ship and whispers quietly:

  **Sardines**

...and the ship seals itself. One of the goblins goes to fetch a cart, which is kind and Gnog thanks him. While he's doing that we're asked if we're visiting. We say we've got some business with the cargo, an old acquaintance on the station to visit and possibly we might try to transfer down, as we have a friend who asked us to deliver a letter to her mother (Beevi's mother, Vi). Gnog: Flat charisma: 15. They seem fairly chipper. The goblin engineer explains - on the station there's food, lodging, shops - all that. The cart arrives and Gnog starts loading Scavvers, so Taz takes over conversation. For Ravnica, we'd need a shuttle - strict rules about ships, we can't take ours down. We're in "short term parking" so Taz agrees to re-board with one goblin to be directed to long-term parking; Deni goes along; Fee-Ree and Gnog follow the other goblin, with the cart.

The ship is parked and Deni pays up-front for what amount to dock fees; it's a deposit and we might get money back if we're not here for long. A month is apparently typical, so that's what she does (30gp).

Meanwhile, we're taken with the cart to a concourse which intersects with the exit from the long-term hangers, so we wait and eventually the party is reunited. We thank the goblins and ask if tipping is traditional here; no; honest! They get paid by the guilds - they can't take money on the side "or we might as well be **Orzhov**". We don't know what means but let it slide. We ask about selling the Scavvers - the market; the goblin finishes the paperwork first, takes only a minute or two and hands Taz a token with an insignia, a number and a letter; it identifies the hanger and gives us access. It's linked to the deposit Deni paid.

We're given directions to the market. There is some kind of transport - train pods - "have a good day!" - and the goblin hurries off.

We head off to the market, following the signs we'd been told were there. It's not a complicated route. Two humans and a half-orc arrive as we're getting to the travel pod. Gnog overhears one of the humans hoping that we don't go in the same pod because of the smell! The half-orc says he likes it. A pod arrives. Gnog says to the other few, "We'd better go separately - ..." but the half-orc interrupts, "Don't be silly! There's room for all of us!" and helps us bring on the cart. The 2nd human doesn't care, but the 1st one is trying to be polite but obviously doesn't like it. Taz sets down his chest, rattles around inside and pulls out a vial. He hands it to the human and says "just take off the stopper for the journey" - it's a vial of perfume. The male human dabs a bit on. "That's very kind of you - ..." "My name's Taz!" "I'm **Kennar**" - the half-Orc says "I'm **Bratley**" - and the other female human is **Juno**. We introduce ourselves. We chat a bit during travel. They're attending a trading meeting to organise a large shipment of goods to the station and find people to forward it on to the planet. Deni asks straight-up where we might find someone called Ridani - Gnog cringes! - but the answer is, "Oh yes, no problem! He's at the old - well, closest we can call it - body shop; a mechanic." He's assumed the question was related to ship maintenance. We thank him.

They get off the pod early, as they're going to "The Hub". We're told we need to continue to the Market for the Cold Storage Warehouse; it's a short walk to the upper level to Ridani's workshop. Thanks again!

We eventually get to the market and alight. It's busier here. We're standing on the platform, in front of a market that's fairly sizeable, if not as big as Bral's Great Market. 20 or so stalls and a few warehouses built into rock structures or standalone. Various ramps and walkways make it very clear where the upper level is.

Gnog looks for the Cold Storage Warehouse - perception 24. His height allows him to see across and there is a sign, so he tows the cart that way. Some stalls, on the way, sell food; others sell essentials (clothing, backpacks, that kind of thing). We note an interesting looking astral herbalist - the **Astral Garden** - we'll come back here. The warehouse is a very large open space, and it seems to be a general fishmarket - cold and frozen goods - quite busy in here. We're approached by someone who can see why we are here and we are directed towards the "wet floor" area that has weighing scales. The Scavvers are hoisted and assessed. We designate Taz as our bookkeeper - he's very persuasive! We're told that 3 are in good condition, 2 less so, but the half has to be treated as just "parts" (cuts of meat).

A number is shown to Taz. Persuasion: Only 17 (even with Built For Success) due to dodgy rolls, but still, 17 is OK. Fee-Ree chimes in talking about how fresh they are, so Taz gets advantage. The roll is still a bit low but the total just comes up to 20. Deni had noted that the price was actually fair (via insight) but we were pointing out that some were in very good condition (killed via magic), fully gutted, only a day old etc. etc.! So he agrees to give us 180gp. We thank him and accept. We take a script to a cashier of some kind who offers us different currencies; we split into a Universal currency and some Ravnican trading currency (rather than their church currency). We have to learn the conversion rates and names.

We're told we can leave the cart at the warehouse as they send them back to the docks in batches. We ask if there's a concept of relative time and length of day in comparison with the Rock of Bral. We're told that here, the days are considered a reference 24h long but there's no day-night cycle. People do whatever they want. On Ravnica, day-time varies as it would on Torril but their 10th District is considered their reference (like Earth's UTC).

Gnog's curious about the herbalist but it's late and we could do with a rest. We look for an inn to crash for 6 hours or so. Gnog perception 25 -> no problem. We don't really want a dorm room but otherwise basic is good. On the upper levels a bit further away from the market, quieter, but within walking distance is a great spot. "**The Rapid Transit**". Check-in is quick and efficient; there's an arcane ward on the door with a "pass code". It's just a place to sleep. No windows, but maybe you wouldn't want any depending on the moon's position.

We finally get to bed.

## DAY 20 (Riglan 57)

We wake up at our best guess of 9am rough Torril equivalent. We clean up, check out feeling much better and Gnog is eager to visit the herbalist this morning.

The herbalist shop walls are wooden inside, with wooden shelves. A female Astral Elf tends to the shop. We look around, but a bit uncertain - the shop assistant says, "Yell out if you need anything!" and goes back to reading a book. Gnog sees names on the shelf but doesn't know what they are, so he asks. There's a tincture that be used to can make a tea, which amounts to a potion of psychic resistance - a lot of Astral Sea creatures use psyonic attacks. It's made from desert plants on the world **Athas** which has a lot of similar attack style creatures there. 250gp each.

On plants, there is discussion of their requirements and limitations; but we're also shown a strange plant with some kind of butterfly wings that flap, with branches spreading out from pink and purple air sacs or similar. Apparently, these are very rare and accordingly, expensive; 2,500gp.

We head out and make our way to Ridani workshop. It's called "**Pieces Of Limbo**"! It's a full bodyshop/workshop inside, even with a small drydock area extending out the back, opening towards a crater. There are four people inside working on things. There are grinding and clanking sounds; not too dissimilar to smithing. No Githzerai is visible here at present - two goblins, a half-orc and a human. Gnog approaches the half-orc and asks, "excuse me, sorry to interrupt your work, we were looking for Ridani...?" - the half-orc points to a shack attached to an upper wall. We head that way, passing more people at work as we go; more humans, even a hadozee. Metal stairs and a metal mesh walkway with metal railings lead to the shack. Gnog knocks politely. He hears "Yes, what is it?"

Looking in through a glass window set into the door, Gnog sees, sat cross-legged as if in meditation, is a Githzerai. "We can come back later if you're meditating..." "It's fine, come in" so we enter. Wisdom saving (Gnog). With luck point, 23. A psyonic wave is probing his thoughts; Gnog consciously elects to allow that to happen. At this, he asks us to close the door; we do. He looks out a little furtively. Who saw us come in? We answer as best we can. He goes outside, calls down to someone saying he's "just going to pop out for a moment", closes the door again and heads to a bookshelf. Ridani looks like he's slim and old/weak; but he pushes the bookshelf aside with apparently no effort at all. Behind is a wall - but he turns some invisible, illusory knob, to reveal a door. We are asked to enter first and we do. He comes through and we see him move the bookshelf without touching it - ah, so that's it - telekenesis.

It's dark, but he casts a Light spell through a small pen he holds. He takes us along a corridor and a zig-zag metal staircase that leads to a series of caverns, which have people in; during which there's basically a catch-up chat. It feels like a base. So this must be the forward station.

* We ask - If we find potential allies down on Ravnica, what's the protocol? We're told that it's up to us to know their intentions before sending anyone. That said, Xaryxian spies on Ravnica are rare as they just always tend to be quite haughty and give themselves away! They do have a few allies though, so care is needed.

* We give Ridani the jar of messages that Marmoset gave to us.

Ravnica's having trouble presently. The local Guildspace is going through some strange extremes - from much quieter than usual, to much more chaotic. The red crystals we encountered are part of a much larger debris field that just appeared out of nowhere; people are investigating it, but it's not clear. It was first noticed about 3 years ago, and it *might* be related to the planet destruction there but it was a different system a long way away; we explain that while it's entirely speculative at this point, we believe there may have been a multi-system event around 7 years ago which *might* have been connected to the "missing planet" from that time.

Not only is space messed up, but Ravinca has trouble on land too. The "common folk" are getting uneasy; those with means or connections, or within nothing to lose, are joining the cause; Ravnicans have little reason to get involved as it seems to not concern their world. People from the **Boros Legion** especially - they have a contact, an enforcer in the Legion called **Aurelio** down there, **based in the 10th District**. "He's our eyes and ears down there". The unrest in the public is believed to be caused by a shift in the balance of power affecting not just a continent but the entire planet. At this, Ridani realises that we are embarrassingly low on knowledge about Ravnica. He takes us to a common room and hands us a battered old book - "The Guild Pact" - and tells us to read that before we go down. Ridani has to go back up to his workshop and we as a group will read it in the mean time - it'll take about an hour. There are two copies, letting us share knowledge.

We just about scrape through (!) and manage to read the book together, with a little help from Bardic Inspiration.

* Ravnica is an old culture and civilisation - millennia of strife and development, wars and so-on
* About 10,000 years ago (!) things came together in one grand experiment - the Great Sphinx called **Azor** who founded the Azorius state classified Guilds into what they did, wanted to do and spheres of influence and created a governance structure where these guilds were responsible for different functions of society.
* Not all of it is on the lawful side. Some guilds are intentionally chaotic - they might undo the work of others - it encourages interconnectivity and promotes balance.
* There were 10 of these guilds originally, fragmented; he got the original ten **Paruns** (leaders) of these guilds to sign the magically-binding **Guild Pact** and this has allowed the world to flourish for more than 1000 years.
* Gnog can best draw an analogy to Waterdeep on a planetary scale, except the guilds are more complex than e.g. a guild of actors.
* The **Azorius Senate guild**, for example, is responsible for the creation and application of laws and the smooth functioning of justice; they also chart the path of society - where they think it should go in future - but they don't enforce this; that's up to another guild.
* The **Boros Legion** is the application of the Azorius Senate laws; they police it but also act with their own discretion to achieve justice where they perceive injustice to have occurred.

We learn about the various guilds. It's a lot to remember. Ridani, upon return, points out that the intended balance is currently out of whack; there is strife. There had been trouble before, when things were eventually tied back together via transfer of the Guild Pact to a living creature - the **Living Guild Pact** - a planar traveller, Ridani thinks, perhaps a demigod. This creature spends a lot of time away from Ravnica normally; but has been away, now, for *years*. We'd need to speak to people on the surface to find out more.

That done, we return the books. We're shown the rest of the base along with the various kinds of training that go on. We'll have to organise travel down to the planet; options are physical or by magic. Physical is cheaper but on a strict schedule and to specific locations on the planet, at night.

Fee-Ree asks about magical ways to get down there - are there magical ways to get back? "Simple" teleportation would work - the moon is well within range. At this, Ridani takes a book and hands it to Fee-Ree - she can use this an anchor to get back, even if we do down via a ship. In an emergency we can try to teleport at any time, but ideally do it when the moon is visible in the sky - it reduces the margin of error (because the errors grow with distance).

This all done, we leave the way we came to avoid arousing suspicion on the workshop floor.

We ask around about travel. We have to take a pod back to the hub, which is in fact so-named because the transfer facility to the planet is located here. We arrive around midday. There are travel options of:

* Teleportation, leaving any time; costs 100gp per person, autognomes included
* A small boat down, with three departures per day, each to a different point on the planet; costs 25gp per person

The locations for landing are:

* 10th District
* 42nd District
* 71st District

The 10th sounds good enough to us, so we ask about time of departure in reference to the time now. It departs in 6 hours. Local time on landing would be around half past midnight. Since departure would be around 6pm Torril, we jump forward about 6 hours which isn't the worst. Almost everything would still be open at that time, at least for food, entertainment, transport and lodging.

We decide that this is the good option and book. We're given four tokens and instructions on where to go, and exactly when to be there - Gnog calculates the time that his Chronometer will be showing then. We're also told that there are three taverns, if we want to use any:

* **The Burning Bower**
* **Night Sky**
* **Clancy's**

Clancy's sounds bad, so we enthusiastically head there. It's rustic! It's also surprisingly busy, but there's only one person at the bar and one person wiping down tables. We're invited to grab a seat and come up to order when ready. We choose table near another, smaller table, not far from the entrance, which has 5 people on it. Another free table was very isolated and a second was between two loud groups at the bar - harder to hear. We're interested in the nature of conversations here, so pick the table with just one smaller group. (Gnog, perception 15).

The table includes an insectoid, but not one of the smaller, 4-arm ones we've seen before; this looks much more scary, with a big abdomen, six arms along it, two more hear the head, big mandibles - it looks like a warrior, and quite intimidating even for Gnog. There's also a halfling wearing black leather with a dark green hooded cloak; a burly half-orc, but quite scarred and might even be a small full-orc - it wears a kind of leather harness with spiked shoulder pads with a large double axe; a red-skinned female with an ornate headdress covered in horns and bones, the skin looking almost aflame; finally, an older woman (50s?) wearing full plate. They're talking about being bored! It leads to some bickering.

Gnog notices lots of empty uncleared mugs and a plate of food that the half-orc picks at, but they're not in a good mood. The half-orc in particular is keeping out of it. Gnog gets noticed looking and is called-out by the halfling.

Gnog pulls out his greataxe but holds it by the blade so obviously not brandishing it, and heads over and kinda tries to make friends. It doesn't go very well (persuasion 10) -> luck point, Gnog tries a different tactic, persuasion 22 -> half-orc says, "Mine's bigger!" and it is. They're very drunk... As conversation goes on - insight 18 - Gnog senses that at least the Halfling and the plate armour woman are being very guarded in what they say, so Gnog apologises for intruding, offers to buy them a drink if they later decide the might want to join us to swap stories, but we'll otherwise mind our own business (in a nice way).

We all go to the bar, where **Clancy** himself is working. They have ale, Gruul Fire Brandy, and a wildflower mead along with basic food - ribs and grilled Scavver stakes. Gnog orders some steaks - two would do for the three of us because they're big - we'll get potatoes too. Gnog tries the Fire Brandy. Fee-Ree will go for the mead and Deni wants something non-alcoholic - our ship shifts means that she's really only been awake a few hours - so she gets coffee. The total is 14sp.

We head over to the corner table now, to honour our promise to give the others space. We bring the drinks along with us. Shortly after the table server - and we figure from the way she talks to Clancy, must be his wife - brings the food. She's actually quite proud of the potato recipe - they're a family thing, cooked in duck fat until crispy but soft on the inside. She tells us to eat with our hands! Some vials of sauces are brought for the Scavver steaks. Scavver is strange, but good. It doesn't taste all that fishy; it's thick and meaty perhaps like tuna, but not very lean or too gamey. It's pretty good. Not too much flavour on its own, maybe, which explains the sauces.

As she's heading back the halfling on the table Gnog spoke to shouts out, "Woman! Is it your job to clear the tables or not?!" "I'll be right there!" As she's clearing the tables, Gnog sees her tripping and the mugs flying - Gnog is pretty sure the halfling tripped her (perception 16). Clancy comes around to help her up. We here him refer to her as **Peggy**.

Gnog says to his party, "Sorry about this, but you know me well enough by now..." and heads over to the table with the halfling ignoring everyone else and stares down the halfling and says "You and I need to have a chat outside." The halfling stands on his chair. "You got a problem?" Gnog answers, "When you trip up hard working folks for fun, yes I do. Outside." The halfling doubles down all indignant - and drunk. He's just drunk. The plate armour person tries to calm it down. Gnog addresses her - "I think you're bored, you're drunk, and it's time to find somewhere to sleep it off." Intimidation, only 17 (with a luck point!) The halfling is triggered even more and mouthing off, picking a fight. Gnog says "I'm not looking for a fight, but your friend here is looking for one with your own party, or anyone else he can get to react here. He's happy now. You're not. This doesn't have to come to blows, but it's your call" and Taz comes up to say, "We'll all be gone from here soon enough, so perhaps we all should find another place to drink?" (blowing inspiration, he gets 24 persuasion).

The red-skinned woman actually has flames flickering across her skin. Her eyes blaze red. "Enough!" she says to her own party, grabs the halfling and yanks him towards the door. "I've had it with you! We can't go anywhere! And I'm not paying for damages from another bar brawl!" - the half-orc says, "Finally!" - apparently happy to leave! - and heads out of the door. The plate armour woman looks confused, realises everone's leaving, says "I have to pay" and Gnog says "We all have bad days. I reacted to his goading too. How about this - no hard feelings, we'll cover it, you just head out and try to enjoy the rest of your day." She hisses "I don't need your charity!" and slams some gold coins on the table, clumsily knocking a chair open on the way in anger (which Gnog picks up).

The insect warrior looks at us, noticing Fee-Ree whose hands are aglow with magic, looks around and realising he can't see Deni, looks at Gnog and clicks a fair bit then leaves. Taz casts Comprehend Languages fast enough to catch part of it - "...probably didn't want to do that after all, besides, I look forward to it. Death comes for us all." As he leaves, a strange, whispy shadow trails behind him. Taz tries to read it but only rolls a 3, so Religion check is only 8; built for success, still only 9. He notices Fee-Ree looking quizzical and casts Guidance on her. She gets 13 on her check, which just scrapes enough to recognise chained spirits, dragged in his wake, like spectres. She sensed a deep and ancient evil about that particular warrior. Taz says that the language was **Kraul** which he explains is a particular warrior death-worshipping humanoid insect race. It's in the book, actually; they're one of the subterrannean Ravnica races. Violent, cannibalistic.

"Chaotic evil customers for the win" says Gnog, and heads back to his Scavver steaks.

Peggy comes over and gives us a second round of drinks - apparently for free. We thank her. A few other patrons had been arming themselves, but now others help pick up mugs and so-on. The food's good and we spend a while longer here hanging out. Gnog figures we might need to take care on our remaining stay at the station in case of ambush from a disgruntled group.

Unfortunately we don't pick up any other information during our stay - perception rolls are universally low. Bit of a waste of Comprehend Languages.

An hour has gone by and we're all finished so we head to what Taz tells us is closer - the Night Sky. Gnog keeps on alert, keeping an eye out of for the people from the bar. Dex save with advantage! 21. A dagger flies his way but just misses him as he dodges. We're in between two buildings and there's inevitably a dark alleyway. Roll for initiative!

* Deni: 23
* Gnog: 20
* Taz: 19
* Fee-Ree: 18

Deni sees the dagger fly past Gnog and runs to the edge of the alleyway; she sees the rogue Halfling immediately and tries to gain insight about his fighting style -> 22 -> this is enough for her to figure things out; she draws her longbow and attacks. 30! That hits. She deals 49 damage, but the rogue uncannily dodges -> 24. She ducks back behind the wall.

Gnog sees, stepping forward, the red skinned woman, aflame. Gnog hazards a guess at a warlock - and a powerful one at that. She looks at Gnog and says, "Throw your weapons into the square!" - Wisdom saving throw. Gnog only rolls an nat 8, for 11 total; Fee-Ree doesn't see the spell being cast but sees Gnog reeling from something in his head and she takes a risk, burning two sorcery points to bend luck; only a 1, so Gnog fails. Gnog casts aside his greataxe. Strength check: 4+5! He does not throw it far; it falls 45ft away. He can't figure out why he did it. Flames burst up around her for a moment too, which is probably some kind of armour; she doesn't move from inside the alley, though.

Gnog rages, runs up and sees around the corner all of the five from earlier. Closest is the orc, he swings twice after drawing the claymore, but completely misses (rolls a 5 then 4). FFS. The Halfling attacks, throwing three daggers. One hits, dealing all-in 33 damage, halved to 16 by rage. He then jumps onto the back of the Kraul then onto a nearby roof, out of view.

Taz can see the halfling - he's hidden in the dark, but Taz can see through that and being further back has a better angle. He gives bardic inspiration to Gnog through a brief tune, then warns the party that they won't be able to hear Gnog and casts Silence over the battle area in alley (a note from the song of creation appears to be circling around Gnog's head as a sort of bright mote of light). He moves temporarily behind Fee-Ree and Deni to keep out of weapons range. He stays where he is.

Fee-Ree moves forward and casts Crown Of Stars. She has the angle to see the halfling but not the darkvision - but a Nat 20 perception roll means that she makes out his position and attacks. She hits, doing 19 radiant damage; he dodges again, taking only 9.

The armoured lady comes forward and Gnog things she'll attack, but she keeps going - Gnog tries an opportunity attack. He *just* hits - she holds no shield, so his awful roll (yes, more, nat 6 this time -> 18) does hit. It's only 17 damage due to dodgy rolls and a good save from her, but Sentinel stops her advance towards Fee-Ree. She's got a great sword and swings twice, two-handed; one attack hits, dealing 14->7 damage. In a surge of action, she attacks twice more; a crit miss and then a nat 20 - but Taz reacts with Silvery Barbs. Gnog is seeing this blade coming *right* at him a fourth time, looking really bad, then a strange flashing light appears between them and the blade misses. He doesn't know what it was. (Taz gives Gnog advantage too).

The gladiator orc attacks. Gnog's about to be on the receiving end of a large greataxe! Two attacks are recklessly made. Both hit. 14->7 and 25->12 damage.

Now the Kraul moves. It skitters up walls and onto a roof until, presumably, it is able to hear itself - it is out of the silence zone. It looks at Gnog and casts some kind of spell in Gnog's direction. The waves of spectres and darkness that had trailed behind it come twisting and jetting forward (technically, it's casting Blight), but Fee-Ree casts Counterspell at L3, which appears to succeed in stopping the effect. Annoyed, the Kraul leaps off the building and ends up right next to Fee-Ree.

Deni aims the Kraul (technically, a death priest) that's trying to attack Fee-Ree. The aim gives her the advantage she needs to hit (other dice was a nat 1). 38 damage total. It looks quite badly injured, surprisingly.

The red-skinned warlock acts again. She's stuck in the silence zone. She drops her Suggestion spell, which she'd been holding on Gnog unbeknownst to him. She moves out of the silent zone, towards the Kraul, which gives her a line of sight on Deni. Eldritch Blasts shoot out, two hitting. Fortunately the damage is low - two ones rolled! - for 12 total. Then she Misty Steps, appearing behind Fee-Ree, flanking her against the Kraul.

Gnog, fortunately not quite flanked by the plate armour lady, swings once at her (with advantage from Silvery Barbs) and once at the half-orc (with advantage due to Reckless). The plate lady is hit but for only 15 damage with no poisoning. The half-orc is hit for a more respectable 17+4 total damage, except the barbarian is raging so the slashing has less effect - it only takes 12 total (17->8+4).

Now the halfling has another go at attacking Gnog, with advantage due to being hidden. That's three attacks, for three daggers but - astonishingly - the highest roll is a 12, leading to 19 that's below the 21 AC and all three attacks miss / bounce off / whatever; the daggers disappear after impact. The halfling repositions.

Taz drops Silence. He can see the halfling but knows it's nimble and sees the plate lady almost flanking Gnog, but also the red skinned warlock lady actually flanking Fee-Ree with the Kraul; so tries something new. He risks trying L2 Charm Person on the Kraul and warlock (DC16 wisdom save); the Kraul saves, but the warlock is charmed. He shouts to Fee-Ree "I've got control of the warlock, don't attack!" then suggests that perhaps she comes over to stand behind him, to get a good view of the fight and observe how he works. Persuasion 23. The warlock says, "Oh OK, I'll come over there!". Taz also gives Bardic Inspiration to Fee-Ree.

Fee-Ree walks over around the Kraul - no opp attacks from the charmed warlock - and casts Shocking Grasp. Nat 20! 6d8 damage -> 28; she uses three charges from her staff too, for 3d8 more -> a maximum 24 damage. Total 52! Huge. The Kraul is incinerated!

The veteran lady in plate is astonished - "Impossible!" - and starts to run that way; Gnog once again hits with an opportunity attack, stopping her in her tracks, doing 16 + 2d6->3 damage, having failed her con save and although that 3 damage was a low roll, she's poisoned. She attacks Gnog but is feeling ill and with the disadvantages this gives her, she misses twice. She heals up a bit (7) with a second wind.

The gladiator is equally angry and runs over - knowing Gnog's already reacted - to administer a healing potion (apparently that's a thing on fully fried Kraul now). He falls out of his rage having not attacked. The kraul comes back up with 7hp. It reaches up and grabs a hold of Fee-Ree's leg; strange black spectral energy runs off its body and onto her. She takes 10 necrotic damage and it heals for another 5, taking it to 12.

Deni aims at the Kraul, since it just attacked Fee-Ree and seemed to have come back from the dead so she'd like to send it back to being that way! She hits, killing it.

The warlock walks calmly over to Taz and hangs out. "Hi!" says Taz. She asks if we're doing well. Taz says, "I'm quite new to this but I think so." She says she never liked the 'deathly one'.

Gnog runs around to reach the half-orc again and recklessly attacks the half-orc. The half-orc takes 15+8 damage and is also now poisoned. Seeing this, Gnog risks a short *flight* up to get alongside the halfling on the roof and continues his reckless assault. He hits for 17+4 damage, 21 total and reacts to half the slashing to 8 (12 total) - not poisoned. The half-orc and plate lady try opportunity attacks, their poison state negating their advantage from Gnog's reckless attacks; but both miss.

The halfling wants to get away - it disengages and runs back, then throws daggers. No advantages or sneak though. All three miss. Cursing, it tries to make run for it, jumping off the roof and heading away. Gnog shouts, "Deni! Halfling's running!"

Taz says to the warlock, "OK, I'll try something just quite simple" - and throws two eldritch blasts at the halfling. Surprisingly, he gets two decisive hits; the first hits for 12, halved by a dodge to 6; the second is only 8. Taz says "not much damage, you see, but the range is good and it does sting!" and as a bonus action, he inspires Deni.

Fee-Ree sees the halfling running too - "Oh no you don't!" - and via Tides Of Chaos, hits with another crown star, doing 35 damage. The thief, having unwisely dodged the eldrtich blast earlier, can't do anything to avoid taking the full force, and falls. She then walks forward and breathes fire over the orc and plate lady! The half orc easily succeeds but the plate lady takes full force. 19 for the veteran, 9 for the half-orc. Fee-Ree now backs away towards Deni and Taz.

The veteran runs up in pursuit and attacks Fee-Ree. The first misses, the second about to hit but Fee-Ree reacts with Shield (and behind her, hears Taz say, "Oh! That's an interesting trick!") - but now the half-orc rages and recklessly attacks; the first would hit but this time, Taz does stop it via Silvery Barbs; but the second attack hits, dealing Fee-Ree 18 damage.

Deni shouts, "Gnog! Stop playing on the roof and get down and help us!", then aims and fires at the veteran; she hits, dealing 46 damage; the veteran falls.

The warlock says, "but how's Gnog going to reach **Mort** (the half-orc) from way over there?! As for *her*, she was always very surly and I swear she wasn't dividing up our gold evenly. We never seemed to have as much gold as I thought we should."

Gnog answers by flying 40ft to just get within reach of the half-orc - but up in the air - and then falls, ath check 29, landing perfectly and recklessly attacking twice. He hits for 14->7 + 6 poison damage, redoubling the poisoning; he tries again, and would parry the blow but Gnog remembers Taz's inspiring song and manages to change his angle of attack at the last minute to hit. Gnog is surprised by a thunderous blast that accompanies his hit (Mote Of Potential, DC16 con save was failed -> 6 thunder damage), plus 14->7 slashing and once again fails the con save, taking a further 6 damage.

Taz throws a couple of Eldritch Blasts. The first hits but only does 6 damage (nat 1 on damage die). The second misses. He gives another brief inspiring song for Gnog.

Fee-Ree uses Shocking Grasp since the gladiator half-orc is in melee range, but she doesn't manage to get a hold of him. As a last resort she tries a ranged attack at disadvantage from the crown, which doesn't work but her inspiration from Taz helps her and she manages to hit with the star. There's no additional thunder damage this time, but it takes 27 damage from the star. In return, it attacks Fee-Ree, recklessly; Taz gets ready; the second would hit, Taz tries to deflect with Silvery Barbs but this time it's not enough to deflect and Fee-Ree is heavily hit for 21.

Deni runs up alongside Fee-Ree to melee range of the half-orc and stabs! She hits. The total damage was 44 (halved via rage to 22), which brings the half-orc to zero; a con save brings him back up with 1hp. Deni only has the one weapon in her hand, so she can't attack again.

The warlock says "Oh, yeah! I forgot. He does that!"

Gnog attacks the half-orc, with advantage due poisoning, the reckless half-orc and now, flanking by Deni. He hits and this takes the half-orc down for good. Gnog looks to Fee-Ree and to the warlock and says, "Any ideas?"

Taz asks the warlock, "Where are you from?" and the answer is, "Me? Oh, I am originally from **Amonkhet**" and Taz replies, "Oh, that's another world - well, your party seems to be down and you didn't really like them, would you like to go home instead?" "To Amonkhet? Yeah, I guess? I'm not sure how?" Fee-Ree says, "I could do it but someone will need to keep an eye on me for a minute..." - and we understand now - Gnog knows the drill, as does Deni - this is going to be a banishment spell, since the other world is technically a different plane.

Fee-Ree goes to the warlock and says, "before you go, what's your name?" "It's **Kefereti**." Taz says, "Nice to meet you Kefereti! Have a safe journey home!" and Fee-Ree stacks things to help power her spell. 3 sorcery points heighten L4 Banishment, but the warlock is charismatic; there's a saving through, albeit with disadvantage; two high rolls mean a total of 21; the DC is 18; so in reaction, Fee-Ree blows two more sorcery points to bend luck and try to add a penalty to the roll, so that brings it down to 18; it still saves.

Taz says "sorry, looks like some technical difficulties - we'll try one more time!"

Fee-Ree has enough to try the spell in the same way once more. The con save rolls are 16 and 20. That's ridiculous. Fee-Ree tries once more without sorcery points now, so no disadvantage on that charisma save; but this time a 3 is rolled and the warlock is sent back to her plane.

### (2200XP each redistributed as 1100 for most but 5500 for Taz -> LEVEL UP 6->7)

The bodies are pulled into the alley; Gnog retrieves his axe; Deni investigates the bodies with Taz's help. The veteran has about 200gp - looks like she really was hoarding. There's nothing else too interesting except for the thief; Taz, arcana 19; two things are magical he thinks:

* A pair of bracers that the halfling wore
* One dagger which is magical

We don't know much more and Deni wants us to rest. We find a short-stay inn and rest there until about time to leave for the transport to Ravnica. During that time, Taz becomes aware of a new spell and spends a while identifying the two objects.

* Bracers of Flying Daggers
* A Cursed ShortSword of Vengeance

Fee-Ree casts Banishment on the spirit, removing its curse. It's just a Shortsword +1 after that. Taz holds onto it just in case. We put the bracers into the bag of holding.

The chronometer eventually shows us that it's time to head to the boat down to Ravnica. It's a bit like a longboat, with a single row of seats on either side of a small isle. It'll seat only 12 people. We hand over the tokens and get on board.

We lift off from the dark side of the moon.
